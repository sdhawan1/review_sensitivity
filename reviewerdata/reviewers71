Title
Review for Truman Show, The (1998)
First, let us now praise Peter Weir and Scott Rudin for producing a film 
rated PG, one suitable for my daughter on her tenth birthday.  THE 
TRUMAN SHOW had two profanities I can recall, no sex scenes, no 
gratuitous violence, and a lot of ideas.
All these elements make me like Jim Carrey more than I used to.  
Although my students have talked about them for years, I have never seen 
the Ace Ventura movies.  I'll admit I rented THE MASK, and got quite a 
few laughs out of it.  And a student teacher in my film literature class 
showed LIAR LIAR.  These are solid but minor comedies, thrust into 
prominence by our culture's demand for vulgar slapstick.  (From what 
I've heard about THE CABLE GUY, it's not worth my time even to rent, 
though I do like to claim that, as a teacher of film, I am aware of 
popular trends.)
What causes me to admire THE TRUMAN SHOW even more is that it's not 
being hyped as purely a comedy.
Think back to 48 HOURS.  (I might better use THE CABLE GUY here, but 
haven't seen it!)  Wasn't this Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte flick 
advertised as a comedy?  But didn't its conflict revolve around one of 
the most ruthless killers in any film of that year?  I remember sitting 
in the dark and almost shivering at his heartless violence;  I was 
unable even to chuckle at the one-liners Murphy lobbed during the more 
tense parts of the plot.
Well, THE TRUMAN SHOW is not a comedy, but a heady satire of the 
American consciousness, a send-up of the voyeuristic media addicts that 
we've become.  When the picture opens with a close-up of Truman Burbank 
gazing at himself in the mirror of his medicine cabinet, we are pulled 
in by the wild imagination of his private monologues.  But here's the 
rub:  we also realize that moments like this are prized, quirky products 
of our privacy.  One of the reasons this film succeeds is that we are 
reminded to hate ourselves, however mildly, whenever we see Truman 
photographed through a "button-cam," or through the console of his 
sedan.  (This is done cleverly, by the way, through lenses with edges 
resembling coke bottles.)  The eaves-droppers ogling the oblivious 
Truman as he proceeds innocently with his life  the waitresses, the two 
cops, the guy whose life is lived in his tub  these people are us.  
This is one type of "winking" the film does.
Another type involves the placement of products.  No, these are not real 
products, like the Reese's Pieces used in E.T.  Instead, they are 
fictional kitchen devices and powdered drinks that Truman's sunny-faced 
wife is forever pitching in the direction of one of the hundreds of 
cameras hidden around their house.  These are self-reflexive winks, 
reminding us of the ever-present products that are advertised within the 
very texts of our films (not to mention in the fictions of writers 
striving for verisimilitude). That these endorsements have nothing to do 
with our real lives is stressed in a powerful scene that has Truman 
desperately confronting the actress playing his wife.
"It's a life," says the director of this television institution, in the 
opening moments of the film.  The way in which writer Andrew Niccol and 
director Peter Weir make Truman's life realistic is similar to the way 
writers make their fantasies seem true.  Gabriel Garcia Marquez uses 
minute details in his stories.  This is the secret of magical realism.  
THE TRUMAN SHOW drops in on the title character rummaging through a 
trunk containing boyhood memories.   We see photos of young Truman with 
his father, now supposedly dead.  We see Truman burying his nose in a 
sweater left behind by a girl named Sylvia (whose cast name is Lauren;  
there are endless double and deceitful images at work here).  We witness 
countless traces of Truman's past, even through flashbacks on the 
screens of the world's viewers. In the end, we realize the sanctity that 
should be accorded Truman's life, and perhaps feel assured that no, our 
society really would not stand by, letting a corporation adopt a baby 
and permitting the construction of a set the size of a city, just to 
broadcast every second of his life.
One weakness is the superficial handling of Truman's wife when Truman is 
truly on to something.  Pushed beyond what she deems "professional," the 
actress shrieks "Do something!" and soon disappears from the scene.  
Another actress is conveniently inserted as a possible love interest.  
But wouldn't it have been more realistic to show the small scenes of 
loneliness (or maybe relief) felt by Truman as he roamed the house after 
his "wife's" desertion?
One test I often apply to comedies is, if it gets a belly-laugh out of 
me, the film is a decent comedy.  This test is subjective, of course, 
but it's just as valid as saying that a short story is good if it makes 
you cry, a comment I overheard from a creative writing professor.  
Although I only guffawed during THE TRUMAN SHOW, I relished the frequent 
funny moments and absolutely loved their intelligence.  
>From his sickbed, his voice played over a still shot of himself, Gene 
Siskel said this may be a "watershed" movie for Jim Carrey.  I agree.  
Carrey is no longer just another rubber face.  It's the first film of 
his that I would show as a solid part of a high school film curriculum.  
My daughter is grateful, too, that it is not among the majority of 
talked-about films, the PG-13s and Rs which, for the next couple of 
years, her parents will not permit her to see.

Review for Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
In time for Christmas we have the ninth 'Star Trek' feature, 
Insurrection, a picture that succeeds largely because of the risks it 
takes.  
In the opening shots we see the idyllic lifestyle of the Bak'u, a people 
who are dead ringers for Homo Sapiens, and who choose to exclude their 
advanced technology from their everyday existence.  (Have you noticed, 
by the way, that intermittent apostrophes in names give them a foreign 
smack?)  Thus there are blacksmiths and bakers and other artisans who 
wear costumes and live in a village reminiscent of the late Middle Ages.  
The set decoration resembles a resort, in fact, a place one might reach 
by a small craft across a man-made bay from Epcot Center.  It is the 
quaintest part of the movie.  Another aspect of the set that accents the 
film's action is the beauty of the planet;  similar to the forests in 
Return of the Jedi, these landscapes provide a natural backdrop in which 
the story unfolds.  The few deep space shots look wonderfully luminous, 
like the multi-colored photographs of gaseous formations sent back by 
the Hubble telescope.
A sudden intrusion on the simple routines of the Bak'u tells us trouble 
is afoot.  Data (Brent Spiner) has gone haywire, and anyone who knows 
'Trek' lore knows Data is an android with the strength of a backhoe.  
Quickly he thwarts the Federation lackeys who pursue him, and then 
uncloaks the spy-post occupied by none other than Starfleet Admiral 
Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) and some loose-skinned species with whom 
Dougherty is in cahoots.  Soon we witness the re-assembly of the crew of 
the enterprise, whose mission is at first to capture Data.  When matters 
become more complicated, a restored Data, Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick 
Stewart) and a comely Bak'u woman named Anij (Donna Murphy) discover a 
holographic double of the Bak'u village.  It seems that this Admiral 
Dougherty has wheedled the leaders of the Federation into approving the 
evacuation of the Bak'u to another planet, in order to exploit a most 
unusual natural resource.  If carried out, these orders would of course 
violate the Prime Directive.  Will the principled Jean-Luc Picard permit 
these peaceable people to be displaced?
In the tradition of the best episodes of the series, Insurrection floats 
some worthwhile political ideas - a plotting strategy right out of Gene 
Roddenberry's notebooks.  The agenda of this installment attacks the 
relocation of native populations;  at no point does Picard mention 
Stalinist Russia or Nazi Germany, though the comparison comes across.  
So the central conflict of the film springs from a trusty, if 
unoriginal, premise, and director Jonathan Frakes - Cmdr. William T. 
Riker, the loyal 'Number One,' - moves the story engagingly while 
staging variations on familiar themes.  Michael Piller's screenplay is 
well edited, with punchy scene-closings and a few hearty chuckles, nods 
to comic relief generated by Worf's revisted puberty and Data's 
misinterpretation of references to boobs.  Pretty standard stuff, this, 
but it works again.
The villain's seat is occupied by F. Murray Abraham as Ru'afo, an angry 
alien who looks like a mummy with a steel plate in his head.  Abraham's 
makeup is actually a throwback to his Academy Award-winning role of 
Salieri in Amadeus, skin sagging in even greater folds and pouches.  
Ru'afo is moderately effective as a baddie;  it's just that he's mostly 
bark, the script not giving him the menacing bite given Christopher 
Plummer as a Klingon general in an earlier flick.  Not until we discover 
Ru'afo's history with the Bak'u does his character take on more mythical 
proportions of evil.
Once again Patrick Stewart plays a brave and noble captain.  His acting 
is probably the most transparent among the cast.  He makes us believe a 
60-ish action hero whose ethics and actions are beyond question.  Picard 
even gets a love interest in this episode - Anij, whose beauty belies 
her 300-plus age.  Unfortunately, the Captain gets no farther than 
hand-holding, though he promises to spend an upcoming 318-day leave with 
her.  Hints of a rekindled romance turn up repeatedly between Riker and 
the buxom Counselor Deanna Troi, though we do not see much consummation 
in this relationship, either.  (The dearth of affection is probably one 
cause for the PG rating, for which I am thankful;  my 10 year-old was 
able to attend with us when usually she misses 'Star Trek' 
installments.)
Music in Insurrection nicely compliments scenes that require it, giving 
the audience cues for climactic moments.  As I believe the makers of the 
'first' episode of 'Star Wars' are doing with John Williams' theme, the 
'Star Trek' people reuse the famous 'Next Generation' main theme, big on 
horns, at the end.
All the baloney about numerology aside, this odd-numbered 'Star Trek' is 
a solid entry in the series.  It is not as riveting as the last, First 
Contact, which featured the Borg, the worst cross you could imagine 
between zombies and vampires, and which was very heavy on technology and 
space exteriors.  By leaving this trend at least momentarily behind, 
Insurrection takes a chance on a slower pace and more character 
development.  Two decisions that, for my three and a half dollars, make 
for good entertainment.


Title
Review for High Art (1998)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Whatever we get ourselves into, we have to pay for.  This theme seems to 
echo in the our heads at the end of Lisa Cholodenko's "High Art."
Syd, the central character, played by Radha Mitchell, is an assistant 
editor at 'Frame' magazine, an important publication in the world of 
photography.  One problem she's experiencing is that, despite her recent 
promotion, she's still treated like an errand-running editorial 
assistant by her boss Harry (David Thornton).  Syd's other problem is 
that her life with boyfriend James (Gabriel Mann), has come to a 
standstill of boredom.  James seems like he's more interested in the 
attractiveness of a blue shirt than in saying anything exciting or witty 
to Syd.  Not that she tries hard, either.
What opens Syd's eyes to alternatives is a visit to the apartment above 
her, ostensibly to inquire about a plumbing problem.  As she lies on the 
floor of the stranger's bathroom, we see the neighbor - Lucy Berliner, 
played by Ally Sheedy - glance at Syd's exposed side, a hint of 
attraction in her eyes.  It so happens that Lucy is a once-celebrated 
photographer who still practices her art privately; portraits of her 
friends, many caught in erotic candids, hang around the apartment and 
around Syd's memory.  Returning to Lucy's digs, Syd meets Lucy's 
drug-addled friends, herself does a line of heroine, and becomes part of 
Lucy's inner circle.  As she returns downstairs to James, Syd is unable 
to complete the hot session of sex she had awakened him for.  This marks 
the beginning of Syd's ventures outside the routines formed the last few 
years, and the end of any positive involvement with her boyfriend.
The bulk of the plot concerns the developing romance between Syd and 
Lucy.  It is marked by solid acting by both actresses, and the portrayal 
of serious emotions with no easy escapes or solutions, a plotting 
strategy for which Lisa Cholodenko, as writer and director, is to be 
admired.  Indeed, the story travels beyond realism into the edges of 
naturalism, as we see the seamy world that makes up a large part of 
Lucy's history - a world with which Syd will slowly become conversant.  
Cholodenko depicts the world as a place of utter nonchalance, where 
drugs of whatever form are shared between friends, where sex is casual 
and commitments uncertain.  As one of Syd's few male friends, Arnie 
(Bill Sage) is almost a comic example of an accommodating burn-out.
As Lucy's lover Greta, a German actress who is obviously too strung out 
to act, Patricia Clarkson makes her character disturbingly real.  
Imagine Greta Garbo's voice spoken even more slowly and lethargically - 
we know this character's soul has begun already to leave her body, and 
we realize with dread that misery loves all the company it can get.  
Greta calls Syd a "teenager," even though Syd saves her life by 
administering CPR after Greta overdoses.  Perhaps verisimilitude would 
have been satisfied had Greta screamed and thrown objects (a camera, 
maybe?) at Syd, but then again Greta's influence still manages to ruin 
any promise of happiness between Lucy and Syd.
It's good to watch Ally Sheedy in a vehicle so much the opposite of 
"Maid to Order."  In her mid-thirties, Sheedy is striking as ever, if 
fashionably underweight.  Her stringy muscles and tendons only help her 
sketching of the starving soul of Lucy.  We care most about her when she 
reveals her drug problem to her wealthy mother (Tammy Grimes), and 
especially when she complies with Syd's request to swear off the white 
powder for their weekend together.  Their professional lives 
intertwining with their personal ones, Lucy and Syd collaborate on a 
shoot for the cover of 'Frame.'  It's a touchy situation, and brings up 
nuances that can be applied to the mixing of anyone's job and home 
lives.  
I suspect personal tastes will be much involved in any viewer's 
reception of "High Art."  I found the love scenes between Lucy and her 
lovers to be realistic without being too graphic.  There is no nudity 
below the waist.  The scenes portraying recreational drug-taking, 
though, were too frequent and frankly revolting.  Cholodenko is building 
a sordid atmosphere that could engender what happens at the end, I 
suppose.  But the communal amorality of her characters certainly does 
not lessen our distance toward them.  We could care more about what 
happens to Syd and Lucy.  But we don't give a hang about Arnie, for 
example, when he's sitting in Lucy's age-worn Mercedes at the far end of 
the story, staring ahead in terror at what's facing him.


Title
Review for Tarzan (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
I recommend Disney's Tarzan for a number of reasons.
First, my family liked it a lot.  My wife and kids and I all sat fascinated 
by the animation.  The computer-assists grow sharper by the movie:  here we 
have a startlingly three-dimensional jungle, limbs and vines passing the 
camera with fresh realism.  Many of the characters - Wayne Knight's Tantor, 
for instance - are drawn as charming throwbacks to traditional animation;  
the elephants are reminiscent of the military marchers in The Jungle Book.  
What's most exciting is the way the camera follows Tarzan's agile ranging 
among the trees.  He zips and zooms, cuts and caroms, surfs and slides.  
American amusement parks are always trying to build a better roller coaster, 
and Disney has built the ultimate (as of the last year of the century) ape 
man.  Tarzan is always likable and, even though his hi-jinks defy physics, 
he always keeps the eye occupied.
Edgar Rice Burroughs' story moves smoothly at the start.  We watch a 
husband, wife and baby abandoning a burning ship.  They land on some part of 
the African coast, where they build an extensive tree dwelling and, 
presumably, the parents die by the claws and teeth of a large cat.  
Discovered by a compassionate and large-eyed gorilla (Kala, voiced by Glenn 
Close), the English baby becomes part of the extended clan.  Although the 
silver-backed leader Kerchak (Lance Henrickson) is against keeping the 
child, as he is not of their kind, the boy grows and becomes friends with 
most of the surrounding animals, especially his two pals, this film's 
versions of sidekicks.  They are Tantor, done with a slightly silly, 
adenoidal voice by Wayne Knight, and Terk, a young female gorilla with a Don 
King 'do and a Brooklyn attitude (supplied ably by Rosie O'Donnell).  Both 
of these voices are delightfully distinguishable, by the way, as is the 
threatening rasp of Henrickson as Kerchak.
Something else we loved was the human side to Tarzan.  We are attracted to 
his character mostly, I think, because he is an outcast,  fully accepted 
neither in the world of the jungle, nor in the less civilized society of 
humankind.  Tarzan frequently feels excluded from his clan, and is thrilled 
to find Jane (Minnie Driver), the English woman who has accompanied her 
father, Professor Porter (Nigel Hawthorne), and the hunter Clayton (Brian 
Blessed).  Of course the main conflict is supplied by the white man's 
encroachment upon the natural habitat of the apes.  What's rather 
predictable here is that Professor Porter himself has come merely to observe 
gorillas, whereas Clayton - and his boatload of mercenary thugs - are armed 
with rifles and the cages that will transport as many apes as possible back 
to the zoos and laboratories of Western civilization.
Small moments make most of the difference.  Directors Chris Buck and Kevin 
Lima cause Tarzan's basic conflicts to evoke our sympathy again and again.  
There's one scene in which the jungle hero has heard the reports of rifles 
and gone to investigate.  We watch as he picks up a shell casing, sniffs and 
then tastes it.  It's foreign and unsavory, of course, and a fine example of 
the main fight going on in the narrative.  Another moving scene occurs when 
Tarzan places his palm against Jane's - and sees that hers is a 
comparably-sized, human hand.  These brief moments sketch character without 
using speech, a feat difficult to do even when using live actors.
As the voice of Tarzan, Tony Goldwyn performs well.  He's heroic without 
showing off - his job the equivalent of a good writer telling a story with a 
transparent prose style.  Minnie Driver is very expressive, especially in 
the frantically-paced scenes in which Tarzan rescues her from vicious 
baboons.  Finally, the voice of Phil Collins is quite pleasing in the 
background.  It's a pleasure that none of the animals themselves breaks into 
song:  the story relies on the musicianship of a proven soft-rock star.  
Another aspect of language handled cleverly is the English spoken by Tarzan 
while he is with the gorillas, versus the English he learns from Jane and 
her father.  It's more believeable than the scenes in which Pocahantas 
suddenly speaks fluent English to John Smith;  it also makes good use of 
linguistic jokes, as when Tarzan connects the name "Clayton" with the 
gunshots intruding upon the quiet jungle.
Only The Lion King used a story original to Disney writers.  I find it 
ironic, therefore, that their Renaissance continues with reliable stories 
like Tarzan.  I hope they keep doing it, though, because there are not 
enough good G-rated movies around, and because it makes good sense, after 
all, to go with a good thing.


Title
Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
Naming a film or book for its protagonist is often a simple but ingenious 
tactic.
It's a strategy used by writers from Charles Dickens and Honore de Balzac to 
Muriel Spark and Saul Bellow.  What we look for in these namesake titles is 
strong characterization: what else are they but focused character studies?  
A work should, after all, be about what it is called.
So ERIN BROCKOVICH serves as a good title, as its heroine seems to have two 
sides - the tender loveliness of a mother to match her first name, and the 
assaulting harshness of a fullback to match her last name.  Julia Roberts 
does a strong job displaying these sides, sometimes within the same extended 
shot.  As she is driving late at night, for instance, she calls home to talk 
with her lover, George (Aaron Eckhart).  After days of legal legwork she is 
exhausted and bitter, and just hearing his voice cheers her;  but what 
should confront her but that she has missed the first words of her infant 
daughter!  On a cell phone in a car, alone late at night, Roberts mixes her 
emotions wonderfully.
One flaw in the characterization is the lack of background.  We are told 
that Erin Brockovich has been married and divorced twice, that she had been 
badly used.  But her only behavior that reflects this history is her caution 
around men.  She is hesitant to get close to George too fast - or at least 
she claims she is hesitant - but we see no real evidence of past trauma.  
Couldn't director Steven Soderbergh have shot snippets of old fights, or at 
least provided family photographs of Brockovich's three children with their 
respective fathers?  The film spends more time showing the woman's futile 
job search than it does explaining why she is the way she is now.
What proves the salvation of Erin Brockovich is the job into which she 
insinuates herself.  Unsuccessful in a lawsuit against a doctor whose Jaguar 
plowed into her jalopy, Brockovich appears in the office of her lawyer Ed 
Masry (Albert Finney).  Again and again showing her abrasive attitudes, this 
determined mother becomes a top-notch legal assistant, sharpening her skills 
on a case that actually becomes too large for Masry's firm to handle by 
itself.  It's a suit against the multi-billion dollar corporation Pacific 
Gas and Electric, a company that has committed crimes against local 
populations by contaminating groundwater for decades.
Of course this whole situation reeks of cliché, and the players even refer 
repeatedly to David and Goliath.  But the acting lifts the premise out of 
the mundane and into the human: we see frailties and platitudes and motives 
that are believable, and we end up liking all of the main players, even 
though we might not want them as close friends.
As Ed Masry, Albert Finney may be a bit old, but his facility as an actor 
convinces us completely.  He plays a good foil to Brockovich, rolling with 
her ego-deflating punches, learning some tact himself from her tactless 
chidings.  Like the other focus characters, Masry's life before the action 
of the film - and outside the office as well - is kept uncomplicated.  We 
only hear him say, "But I'm married," yet we never meet his wife.  Such 
simplification is not always good, but it does create an emphasis on the 
action at hand, and evokes chemistry between Roberts and the masterful 
British actor.
Aaron Eckhart is underused in the picture.  George's relationship with Erin 
causes a certain ambivalence:  we want to see more of him, yet we admire the 
decisions made by screenwriter Susannah Grant, decisions that remove George 
from the scenes that lead up to the climax.  In any case, Eckhart has a sure 
screen presence, and is certainly cut from the cloth of young leading men.
Do we know enough about the problem that is causing various cancers and 
other illnesses among the people living near the gas and electric plant?  It 
is explained to us a few times, and thankfully, the explanations do not 
treat viewers as idiots, as does the scene in ARMAGEDDON in which Billy Bob 
Thornton moves a space shuttle model around a moon model.  Reservations:  
the business with the trump card, involving Charles Embry, comes too easily; 
and though it sounds unlikely, the story actually has too few courtroom 
scenes.
Julia Roberts is a sort of working person's actress.  She has created for 
herself a public persona that is slick and smart, that banters almost 
spitefully with the press yet offers pleasant interviews.  At 32, she's 
received the highest paycheck for a female lead, a reported $20 million for 
this outing.  That this information is common public knowledge attests to 
the coverage with which Julia Roberts is swarmed.  Like her or not, she is 
an important force in entertainment; fortunately for the public, her agendas 
are mature and decent and compassionate.  ERIN BROCKVICH shows that she can 
inhabit a character who is larger than life.


Title
Review for Cookie's Fortune (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Robert Altman's latest begins with the free-floating point of view sometimes 
employed by the novelist Sinclair Lewis.  We first see a black man inside a 
dark bar, Theo's Place.  He's drinking heavily, and when he leaves he spots 
a cruiser passing in the street.  The drunken Willis Richland (Charles S. 
Dutton) drops his pint of Wild Turkey, returns to the bar and steals 
another.
Meanwhile, across the town of Holly Springs, Mississippi, we are shown a 
rehearsal of an Easter pageant, Camilla Dixon's (Glenn Close) version of 
Oscar Wilde's 'Salome'.  Camilla is bossing around the players, including 
her sheepish and slow-witted sister Cora (Julianne Moore) and a young 
sheriff's deputy, Jason Brown (Chris O'Donnell).
Thus Altman establishes the arena in which his story unfolds.  He adds 
dashes of other characters to the recipe, and somehow manages quite a 
successful result:  a small movie with a large cast, an art film that is in 
no way snooty or snotty, the kind of picture that stars worth their salt 
give up scads of cash to be in.
These threads of plot keep crossing as the narrative gets passed among the 
many eccentric and convincing characters.  Willis appears to be breaking 
into a house through a kitchen window.  He stumbles upon a cabinet and 
begins to remove several handguns, just as an old woman descends the steps 
and surprises him.  We discover they are friends, and the woman (Patricia 
Neal) - the Cookie of the title, Jewel Mae "Cookie" Orcutt, beloved widow of 
Buck Orcutt - treats this man like a son.  The two keep a running count of 
wrongs they've done each other, and Cookie has been wronged more often:  
it's a playful and endearing piece of characterization.
We find out that Cookie's relatives have abandoned her.  Nieces Camilla and 
Cora are not on good terms with her (rather, Camilla is not, and Cora 
blindly follows any direction coming from Camilla).  Niece Emma Duvall 
(apparently Cora's daughter, played by Liv Tyler) has just returned to town 
from a life of alleged decadence.  She hasn't had the chance to see Great 
Aunt  Cookie before the old woman, in a state aggravated by loneliness, 
senility, and some heavenly descriptions she got from Willis, uses one of 
Buck's old pistols to blow out her brains.  What keeps our interest is the 
filmmaker's handling of the body's discovery.  Again the camera seems to be 
floating:  Altman is wisely unafraid to sustain a shot when very little is 
happening.  Hence we see Camilla searching the house in real time, and we 
are treated to a masterful scene when she finds the body in bed, a ruined 
feather pillow covering the head, pistol dangling from a dead finger.  
Thinking quickly, Camilla reveals her true colors:  she begins to gather any 
traces of Cookie's crime against the family name; knocking over jewelry 
boxes to simulate a robbery; stuffing the suicide note, which is addressed 
to Willis, into her mouth, to hide it from the approaching Cora;  finally 
lifting the pistol out of the peaceful grip of Cookie's hand.  In short, 
Camilla flagrantly violates the crime scene.
Needless to say, Camilla's actions hold serious repercussions for most of 
the characters.  What is very impressive is Altman's sense of humor - a 
refined dark comedy that also functions as social satire.  This director is 
experienced in manipulating the large cast, as he did in 'Mash', 
'Nashville', 'Short Cuts' and others.  We watch brilliant spurts of 
characterization followed by astounding revelations about human nature.  
Viewers can tell Altman is always on task, whether it's coaxing crazy 
expressions out of the actors, timing the implications of a lingering shot, 
or even including a couple of visual jokes other directors would shun (such 
as Close's Camilla getting caught with her hand in Cookie's cookie jar!).
The acting is thoroughly solid in this piece.  Close shows her mastery of 
megalomania:  she plays Camilla as an aging Southern belle more concerned 
with appearances than with family relations.  Sister Cora, who sleeps in the 
same room with Camilla, and kneels dutifully during Camilla's self-righteous 
prayers, is a classic example of a dominated adult.  Sometimes Moore's 
expressions are hilarious in their simple-mindedness, as when she sucks in 
her lips, as though they are zipped, when one of the cops comments about the 
terrible scene in the bedroom upstairs.  Moore has worked with Altman 
before, in 'Short Cuts', the adaptation of Raymond Carver's superb short 
stories, and she shows a marvelous range here.  Cora is so plain she's 
almost unattractive, and some of the most funny and subtle moments are given 
to her, as when she incorporates Biblical-sounding poetry from 'Salome' in 
her everyday speech.  Just as good is Patricia Neal, the title character, as 
she shows her attachment to Willis, and especially to her dead husband Buck. 
  Finally, Charles S. Dutton seems to be the main character - he links the 
other characters with strands of plot that many times display their foibles 
and his virtue (as when he buys a pint of bourbon and returns it to the 
shelf in Theo's bar).
Supporting roles are jewels as well.  Chris O'Donnell as Jason Brown is a 
green but over-confident deputy, and receives with telling ignorance the 
condescension of Camilla and his superior officers.  Jason is in lust with 
Emma, played with low-key loyalty by Liv Tyler.  Ned Beatty plays Lester 
Boyle, another deputy, who is not afraid to point out the incompetence of 
senior investigators on the case of Cookie's death.  I don't know if Beatty 
has the most acting credits among the cast members, but he's certainly one 
of the more natural-acting veterans Altman has ever found.  In a smallish 
role, Lyle Lovett's Manny Hood is quietly obsessed with Emma, employing her 
in his catfish business and refurbishing a caboose in which he is hoping she 
will live.
My sole complaint is the convolutions that come in late.  Yes, some of them 
are crucial and well-explained, but others seem like they're included out of 
respect for the novel from which Anne Rapp developed her screenplay.  A few 
details are crammed in and possibly expendable.
Another of Altman's recent films, 'Gingerbread Man', is set in the South, 
and 'Cookie's Fortune' furthers the director's exploration of things 
American and gothic.  There are wonderful depictions here of manses and 
gardens, gentility and jealousy.  It would take me awhile to come up with a 
director comparable to Altman;  if he were purely a writer he would be 
called literary, sprawling but coherent, sarcastic but touching.  At last, 
he's an original, big-name independent whose small masterworks should be 
included in any canon


Title
Review for Hilary and Jackie (1998)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
'Hilary and Jackie' is a film very full of ideas, a film whose every 
shot is fascinating to watch.  There are enough ideas to fill a 
discussion twice as long as the 121- minute running time.  And best of 
all, it's a film that takes risks and turns out mostly successful.
One of the many genres 'Hilary and Jackie' fits is biography;  
specifically, it's the biography of the noted English cellist Jacqueline 
du Pre (Emily Watson), a story that also traces the life of Jackie's 
sister Hilary (Rachel Griffiths).  It begins with the sisters on a 
girlhood lark at the beach, chasing each other across dunes in a 
make-believe world that surfaces later in the film.  We learn soon that 
it is Hilary du Pre who is the child prodigy, a flautist who performs in 
Leopold Mozart's 'Toy Symphony' over the BBC.  Rather pushy Mother 
(Celia Imrie) browbeats the younger Jackie into practicing more: "If you 
want to stay together, you have to be as good as each other."  In a 
smooth telescoping of time, we observe 'Jacks' working on her fingering 
during breakfast, during lessons at school - until at a competition she 
wins best strings soloist to match Hilary's best woodwinds soloist, an 
achievement that ignites a first spark of jealousy in Hilary.  Keely 
Flanders and Auriol Evans do stupendous work as the young Hilary and 
Jackie.  Both are very expressive and natural before the camera.  Only 
one area of Evans' performance called my attention, and that was her 
vibrato.  Apparently most of the cast were occupied constantly with 
music lessons, but when Evans and, later, Watson, work with the cello, 
there are hints of phoniness.  It's an easy element to overlook, 
however, as you have to love a film gutsy enough to show actors' hands 
while they play!
Before long, we see Griffiths and Watson in the title roles.  
Ironically, Jackie is far ahead of her sister in musical prowess, and as 
Hilary stays at home to begin a romance with Kiffer Finzi (David 
Morrissey), Jackie embarks on a tour of Europe.  The conflict created by 
this situation is one of the more conventional aspects of the film.  The 
more 'domestic' one loves her husband and adorable children, while the 
more artistic - and unstable - one marries another artist and continues 
to hop from city to city.  It's not a weakness, though, as the story 
takes an almost mythical spin when Jackie, exhausted by years of her 
whirlwind lifestyle, visits her sister and her family in the English 
countryside.  When Jackie makes an unthinkable request of her sister and 
brother-in-law, we glimpse the first signs of an illness that invades 
Jackie's personal life and threatens her very ability to play the cello.
At one point the film ceases being a typical biopic and takes a chance 
with an unusual narrative device, the word 'Hilary' appearing on a black 
screen.  In the following segment we witness events from Hilary's point 
of view, tracing her failure at a flute exam, her relationship with 
Kiffer, and her oddly close attachment to her sister.  Later 'Jackie' 
appears on the screen.  To locate us, the director, Anand Tucker, 
briefly repeats a few scenes, but now focuses on Jackie's worldview, a 
narrow one damaged by a lonesome concert schedule in world capitals.  
(What surprised me is that no one traveled with one so young;  Jackie in 
the film languishes at her own receptions, places her cello outside in 
the rain, she is so wearied of playing it.)  But the two-edged 
storytelling compliments the twin imagery used in other places.  It's 
really what causes the narrative to resonate, to build a momentum that 
not only sustains our interest but engages our sympathy.  Jackie's 
depression is lessened somewhat by her marriage to Argentinian-born 
pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim (James Frain).  But her condition 
seems bearable only when she is with Hilary.
There are moments that seem derivative of 'Shine,' especially when the 
motion slows and Jackie fails to negotiate her bowings, the sound going 
screechy and dissonant.  But the comparisons stop here.  Jacqueline du 
Pre's malady is certainly very different from David Helfgott's.  What's 
gripping is people's reactions to each performer.  I would give 'Hilary 
and Jackie' the edge in overall quality, though it seems that it will 
not attain the level of hype that surrounded 'Shine' two years ago.
David Johnson's photography adds much to the dramatic tension. We see 
everything from a classy circling of the young Jackie, frantically 
dancing with her body in an early show of her flamboyant style, to the 
thick, watery world perceived by Jackie in the later stages of her 
disease.  Interiors are also portrayed particularly well, many shots 
showing the wide foyers of music academies.
Emily Watson is a delight to watch.  Like Jacqueline du Pre herself, 
Watson seems to have a maturity beyond her years - she's a precocious 
actress.  Because of the facility with which she depicts complex 
emotional and psychological extremes, her performance deserves 
recognition;  it should pull down many nominations.  As her sister, 
Rachel Griffiths also creates a sympathetic role, her face at once 
natural and intense.  When we witness her cradling Jackie, we are moved 
equally by deep love and the story's inertia - moving inexorably to a 
realistic conclusion.
Frank Cottrell Boyce has written a screenplay that is smart and 
fast-moving.  He and Tucker apparently informed the du Pres (Hilary and 
brother Piers penned a book about their sister) that they wished to 
dramatize Jackie's story in an uncharacteristically expressive manner.  
They have succeeded.  Of course we have to remember the license used by 
the storytellers here, especially when the plot comes full circle and 
takes a decidedly expressionistic direction.  Bravo for the takers of 
risks!
I recommend 'Hilary and Jackie' to any music lover, but also to lovers 
of untraditional plotting, and moviegoers who derive pleasure from heady 
conversation over ice cream when the movie's done.  It's a bold step by 
filmmaker Anand Tucker, and a tribute to Jackie du Pre, a good soul who 
loved music.


Title
Review for Dudley Do-Right (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
It's difficult to name more than a few successful live-action adaptations of 
cartoons.
Try it.  If you said "The Flintstones" or "Dick Tracy," try again.  They may 
have brought in the change at the box office, but they are not good movies.  
Don't even think about "Mr. Magoo" or "Dennis the Menace."
Hugh Wilson's "Dudley Do-Right" belongs on the long-list of mediocre film 
fare, a mostly failed and random collection of hopeful plot turns and 
clichés.  Because of the premise, which is the inane exploits of Jay Ward's 
dull-witted Canadian Mountie, the story is lightly entertaining.  And in a 
few places we get to belly laugh at twists that have finally gone over the 
top.
The lonesome mounted policeman (Brendan Fraser) is sure his love, Nell 
Fenwick, will never return.  So Dudley busies himself with his duties.  One 
night he spots his childhood companion and nemesis, Snidely Whiplash (Alfred 
Molina).  Snidely is "salting" rocks with gold dust loaded into shotgun 
shells.  Why?  Well, because he wants to create a fake gold rush to this 
part of northern Canada, of course.
Meanwhile, Nell (Sarah Jessica Parker) has returned with her multiple 
graduate degrees.  It seems she and Dudley will resume their relationship, 
until Snidely captures her attention.  This seems all wrong, of course;  as 
a watcher of the original in my childhood, I was expecting Snidely to be 
nothing but the bad guy - a sentiment Snidely himself mentions several times 
in self-reflexive asides.  (I also wanted Nell to kiss Horse, Dudley's 
mount, but no luck!)  What's more odd is that Hugh Wilson shows us an 
opening sequence in which the three main characters assume their roles in 
childhood, Snidely as a boy wearing a black cape and stovepipe hat, already 
sniping at Dudley for Nell's affections.
It turns out that Snidely is successful in his quest for  prospectors:  
Semi-Happy Valley is flooded with their money, and in a wink at marketing 
savvy, we see all types of merchandise with Snidely's image --  a self-hype 
that dives to the depths of money-grubbing.  What will stop Snidely's taking 
over the town  -- which is redubbed "Whiplash City"?  Certainly not Dudley, 
as he has been drummed out of the service by his idol, Inspector Fenwick 
(Robert Prosky).  We really have no idea why Dudley loses his job, except 
that Snidely has connections in Ottawa, and the Inspector never had much use 
for the square-jawed boob anyway.
Enter Eric Idle as a grimy prospector, only slightly removed from a grungy 
Gumby character on "Monty Python."  Kim Darling prospects for gold and finds 
a sizable nugget planted by Snidely.  Although he is catapulted into the 
front of the news about the gold discoveries, Darling serves as a sort of 
goofy mentor to Dudley, training him in the proper ways to fight Snidely's 
brand of evil.  What is original here is that Dudley attempts to be good by 
being bad - namely, by stealing gold from the thieves employed by Snidely!  
Will our hero prevail in his circuitous search for good?
The acting in "Dudley Do-Right" is superior to the plot.  Brendan Fraser is 
passable as the title character, but he was better in Jay Ward's "George of 
the Jungle."  This actor is good at looking surprised and duped, another 
feat he pulled off rather well in Wilson's "Blast From the Past."  (I would 
add that his role in "The Mummy" this past May did not particularly 
distinguish him as an action hero; he was much better as the gardener 
tempted by the fictionalized version of director James Whale in "Gods and 
Monsters.")  Although Fraser's hair should have been died to resemble the 
cartoon character's frizzy locks, he turns in a passing performance.
Underused is a good word to describe the roles of a few other characters.  
First, Robert Prosky is an old pro who is woefully absent from the film.  He 
appears but briefly and speaks in a British accent, his white mustache 
obscuring the British curve of his lips.  What a missed opportunity, having 
such a veteran actor on the set and using him merely as decoration!
Sarah Jessica Parker's part is also underwritten.  She could appear in more 
scenes, although she does a fine job in the ones that made the final cut.
Eric Idle is the one indispensable presence here.  He knows instinctively 
just how much exaggeration to give a comic support role.  His Kim Darling is 
a hilarious blend of silliness and incongruity, especially at the end when 
he meets a sublime fate.
Some of the more pleasurable moments of viewing involve the actual cartoon 
short "The Phox, the Box, and the Lox."  It's a fractured fairy tale, a lot 
like the olds ones narrated by the ivory-voiced Edward Everett Horton.  The 
tale of a wise-cracking, greedy fox and his quest for treasure, the story 
shows some of the same twisted moralizing as its 1960's precursors - except 
that the originals were more comically arch.
On the whole, it would be better to rent "Dudley Do-Right," except if no 
better offerings were available on the weekend for the kiddies.  The 
self-aware jokes - that trademark of Jay Ward's post-modern sense of humor - 
are present to a small degree, and the ending is much more promising than 
what leads to it.  Now, let's hope that Ward's main success, the ingenious 
'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle," falls into the hands of a more 
wildly creative producer.

Review for Flying Leathernecks (1951)
It's hard to watch John Wayne without remembering it's John Wayne.  He's 
not a bad actor;  it's just that he's so famous that his face is an 
icon.  The face and the booming voice and the swaying gait.  And most of 
all, the toughness.  In FLYING LEATHERNECKS        Wayne plays Major Dan Kirby, 
an officer called in to command a squadron of American pilots just 
before the Battle of Guadalcanal.  Wayne plays Kirby with classic 
American stoicism.  He has a job to do and cannot waste time on 
sentiment or guilt over giving orders.  When his squadron loses men, 
Kirby cannot let it get to him.
It's Kirby's second in command, Capt. Griffin, who is a bit too 
sensitive in the line of battle.  That's why "Griff" was not recommended 
for the command post in the first place - why the brass imported Kirby.  
As Griffin, Robert Ryan delivers a performance at least as strong as 
Wayne's.  No, you cannot have an interesting story without conflict, and 
one conflict in LEATHERNECKS is Griffin's resentment of Kirby's 
by-the-book attitude.  At one a pilot peels off to pursue, and 
eventually destroy, a small Japanese plane.  But the American loses his 
plane in the process.  When the pilot returns to base, everyone except 
Major Kirby is ecstatic to see him.  But Kirby orders his arrest pending 
court-martial.  Clearly the men are disgruntled with the discipline, 
especially because qualified pilots are scarce.
Griffin and Kirby have many run-ins.  But eventually we see Kirby was 
using the tough façade to work his men into condition.  He cancels the 
court-martial.  We also watch as Kirby plays a recording he received, as 
a Christmas gift, from his young son back in the States.  So Kirby is 
human after all!  Eventually, Griffin completes the formula by paying 
his respect to Kirby.  Kirby, of course, earns this respect through 
several command decisions and successful missions.  We see more of the 
human side of Kirby when, between assignments, he makes an unannounced 
visit home.  His wife is overwhelmed, of course, and his son receives 
both his father's love and a Japanese sword he can show off to his 
friends.
What's fascinating about the script is that it portrays the historical 
controversy over strategic bombing.  In the film, Kirby is a staunch 
advocate of low-flying support: you receive precise coordinates from 
officers on the ground, and then send your Wildcats in to bomb enemy 
positions, which are just yards away from friendly troops.  During the 
Second World War, this type of support had not been developed, and 
crediting officers like Kirby adds interest as well as historical value 
to the story.
Also of historical interest are the scenes of actual battle.  Compared 
to modern films, with special effects and huge budgets, LEATHERNECKS 
does not supply viewers with extended and breath-taking dogfights;  but 
what we see is pieces of real air combat, even shot in color to match 
the color of the movie - tracer bullets hitting their targets, Zeros 
spinning to crash into the ground.  Considering that directors in the 
1990s still intersperse real footage with their fictionalized narrative, 
the makers of LEATHERNECKS were ahead of their time.
First-rate comic relief is supplied by Jay C. Flippen, the character 
actor's character actor.  He plays a figure similar to Jamie Farr's 
Corporal Klinger from MASH - a finagler, a petty thief who looks after 
his men and keeps the squadron's planes in the air.  When an amused 
Major Kirby looks the other way at Clancy's pilfering, we witness 
another endearing point of characterization.  And it's funny as hell 
when Clancy is busted to PFC.
Released six years after the Second World War ended, FLYING LEATHERNECKS 
does not contain the all-out, gung-ho heroism of movies made during the 
war.  But it certainly praises the American armed forces, and men like 
Kirby and Griffin who were among its front-line fighters.  It makes no 
mistake about its patriotism.  Having John Wayne, the reddest-blooded 
American film hero, as its star does not hurt its impact.  For a film of 
its time, it's a winner.


Title
Review for Limey, The (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Riddle me this:  when does a crime drama become an art film?  Answer:  when 
it's directed by Steven Soderbergh.
Soderbergh's direction of "The Limey" is both quiet and stunning.  It's the 
story of a career criminal named Wilson, portrayed by Terence Stamp.  Wilson 
leaves England for Los Angeles with the intent to investigate and possibly 
to avenge his daughter Jennifer's death.  So what we have is a revenge 
story, and when we see Wilson's method of operation, we know it's going to 
be a violent one.  In scene after scene, Soderbergh has this aging bloke 
step right into the rhythm of a seedy Southern California atmosphere;  
Wilson contacts a former friend of Jennifer's, an ex-con named Ed, who is 
now trying to stay clean.  Wilson is shown purchasing a pistol and several 
rounds from a couple of bike-riding bangers.  Next he follows a lead to a 
warehouse where he asks about a man named Valentine.  When Wilson mashes a 
man's face and steals Valentine's address from a Rolodex, things heat up on 
both sides.  The director shows admirable taste when he keeps the key 
violence off-scene.
Another dimension of the script kicks in when Wilson contacts another of his 
daughter's friends, an acting coach named Elaine (Leslie Ann Warren).  She 
does not seem to think the circumstances of Jennifer's death are suspicious, 
but she seems to understand Wilson's need to discover the truth.  Although 
the scenes leading to friendship between Wilson and Elaine are too few, we 
totally believe the connection between them.  Warren is nicely cast for the 
role, and she plays a sophisticated foil to Wilson's Cockney-accented 
plainness.  Guzman's Ed is also pals with Wilson.  His role is to leaven the 
Brit's hot-headedness, or at least to help his friend to avoid prison.
What's so original about Soderbergh's method is camera work.  Director of 
Photography Ed Lachman assists Soderbergh's vision with a series of 
flash-forwards:  we frequently view shots from scenes that take place 
several minutes later.  In a type of forecasting montage, the frame often 
slows down, cross-cuts or repeats key images.  Soderbergh has always shown a 
fascination with multiple facets, and his narrative technique here is a 
successful experiment.  Occasionally he resorts to holding his subject in 
the corner of the frame instead of in the center - a trend popular in 80's 
commercials.  But the storytelling intelligence outweighs this cliché.
In depicting the different sides of Wilson's life - husband and father and 
sociopath - Soderbergh also employs various flashbacks.  We see Jennifer as 
a child, galloping across a beach or peering through a doorway at her 
parents.  When we watch her-a cute little girl threatening to turn her dad 
into the police should he go astray again -- we become closer to her and 
perhaps feel more acutely her father's loss.  In a bizarre and original 
effort on the part of the filmmakers, clips from the 1967 film "Poor Cow" 
show a dark-haired Terence Stamp playing a thief named "Wilson."  He 
interacts with a bubble-haired woman, and even plays a song on a guitar, and 
we can tell it's Stamp.  What an effect!  Stamp is a long-shot for 
nominations for major awards, but if "The Limey" gets the attention it 
deserves, this almost 40-year veteran of the screen will have even more 
roles in which to show his superior talents.
The action in "The Limey" is sudden and striking.  First in the warehouse, 
and several times as Wilson closes in on Valentine, we see almost unexpected 
escalation into violence.  As Valentine, Peter Fonda seems to reprise many 
of the roles he played in the 60's.  He does seem rather Eastwood-like with 
his hoarse whisper;  but Fonda has perfected an understated acting style 
that works well here, in his role of hunted man.  It's fascinating to watch 
the touches of characterization that tell us of Valentine's underworld 
connections, which he tries to rationalize away.  Because Valentine is not 
himself a violent man, he has hired the smooth and ruthless Avery (played by 
another veteran of many television and film outings, Barry Newman).  Avery 
in turn hires a couple of street toughs to rub out Wilson, but is not afraid 
himself to pump a shotgun if necessary.  Newman is a reliable actor who 
sketches here a sophisticated killer, completely efficient and amoral.
As much as the action of this film is well-done, it is the characterization 
that strengthens the story.  We end up knowing so many sides of Wilson, and 
end up liking him, even after we see him killing one of Valentine's henchman 
in cold blood.  The henchman is also not guiltless.  So all of these 
characters have taints of badness, and the result is a modern naturalism, an 
updated revenge film with style, slickly directed and watchable more than 
once.


Title
Review for Vertigo (1958)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://ofcs.org
Why does Alfred Hitchcock's picture 'Vertigo' endure as such an 
important piece, more than forty years after it was made?
Universal recently committed more than $1 million for its restoration, a 
process that gives modern moviegoers outstanding clarity of image and 
sound.  According to the experts in charge of the restoration, audiences 
for the next 200 years should be able to enjoy their restored version.
Then there are the ardent fans of Hitchcock's - the ones who claim this 
is his masterpiece, one of the very best films.  How talk was started 
that 'Vertigo' is a personal film I don't know;  but there is an odd, 
desultory tone to 'Vertigo', a slow sadness that punctuates the 
passionate emotions and intense action scenes.
Finally, I know first hand that 'Vertigo' is watchable by contemporary 
youngsters:  my 14 year-old son and ten year-old daughter were glued to 
our television while the tape played.
Like many of the stories selected by the meticulous Hitchcock, the plot 
of 'Vertigo' is difficult to describe.  It's nearly like putting into 
words the bizarre images from an MTV video or a commercial with 
fast-paced digitized figures.  Here goes:  John "Scottie" Ferguson 
(James Stewart) has imposed retirement on himself because he suffers 
attacks of anxiety and dizziness when he looks down from great heights.  
Another dimension of his uneasiness is guilt.  John had been a 
detective, and when he'd fallen during a chase and hung from the gutter 
of a building, he'd watched a police officer trying to help him fall to 
his death.
Where the story starts to writhe with originality is when a college 
buddy of the aging Ferguson contacts him with a request.  The 
ship-building executive Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) apparently has a 
young wife who is preoccupied with living the life - and perhaps the 
death - of Carlotta Valdez, her great-grandmother.  Elster wants 
Ferguson to follow Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) and note her wanderings 
- and protect her from herself, if necessary.  In the following 
sequences we watch Scottie Ferguson trail Madeleine to a flower market, 
a museum, a boarding hotel, and the farthest destination, 100 miles 
south of San Francisco, a Spanish mission.  In these places Madeleine 
seems to assume a trace-like state in which she patterns her behavior 
after Carlotta, a woman who took her life after a period of depression 
and distraction brought on by losing custody of her daughter.
What the husband, Elster, had not counted on was his friend's falling in 
love with Madeleine.  For awhile Ferguson follows her undetected.  But 
when he witnesses her jump into San Francisco Bay, he dives in and 
brings her back to his own apartment.  Though at first it seems 
Madeleine wants nothing to do with Ferguson, she returns to drop off a 
thank-you note.  Ferguson happens to follow her to his own apartment, 
where he expresses tentative affections that she returns.  Later, in a 
stunning scene back at the mission, their relationship ends, sending 
Ferguson into a mute depression, an acute "melancholia" from which he 
emerges, after a year, as a man obsessed with regaining what he's lost.  
Novak returns in a brilliant double role as Judy Barton, a woman who 
looks just like Madeleine Elster. Enough said that the two fall in 
complicated love, and relive crucial and compelling scenes.
The literary elements in Hitchcock's films are always remarkable.  That 
his plots resemble finely written stories is no mistake.  In 'Vertigo' 
we see the director's fascination with heights, first of all, 
illustrating the terror felt by Ferguson as he glances from high-rise 
windows or simply down a flight of steps.  The part of the body featured 
in this film seems to be the eyes.  From the swirling vortex in Saul 
Bass' title design, to extreme close-ups of the eyes of the main 
players, we catch glimpses of troubled souls.  Other leit motifs include 
jewelry, paintings, water, and lurid lighting.  Hitchcock also expertly 
uses dramatic irony, given to us in a sudden sequence late in the story, 
just before we need to know it.  Finally, the master of suspense is not 
above using even animation, in a dream scene, to assist in showing the 
deteriorating psyche of the beleaguered detective Ferguson.
Jimmy Stewart is as impressive as ever in the leading role.  Stewart is 
the ultra-rare combination of modest looks and supreme composure.  The 
best thing is, oddly enough, that when he loses this composure, he is 
completely convincing, his acting completely transparent.  Occasionally 
in the story Ferguson acts flippant and nonchalant, as in many scenes 
with his old pal "Midge" Wood, an artist to whom he was engaged briefly 
several years before.  (Midge is played by the wonderful stage and film 
character actress Barbara Bel Geddes.)  Soon Ferguson displays a 
tortured affliction that surprises the viewer.  This actor depicts an 
astonishing range - always natural and sympathetic.  At first feeling 
sorry for the psychologically troubled Madeleine, Ferguson dabbles in 
attempted cure;  a failed healer, he tries later to cure himself.  What 
a paradoxical role this one, vastly different from the others he played 
for Hitchcock.
Kim Novak's character was originally given to Vera Miles.  But when 
production was delayed by Hitchcock's gall bladder operation, Miles 
announced she was pregnant and could not play this challenging role.  
Hence the glamorous Novak's selection as the troubled blonde Madeleine 
Elster, and as her doppelganger, the less sophisticated Judy Barton.  
Novak's acting is never over-stated;  it seems natural without the 
wooden façade many of her contemporaries practiced - like Miles, for 
instance, practices in 'Psycho.'
Another reason this story endures is its universal contradictions.  It 
is at once a mystery and a romance, with loads of forbidden behaviors 
that must have struck audiences of the late '50s as terribly risqué.  
Why does Scottie Ferguson pursue the damaged (and married) femme fatale, 
instead of the comfortable, mothering Midge?  Sinister schemes, trauma, 
searches for redemption - all of these themes commingle in Hitchcock's 
agenda.
In service of his "pure cinema" philosophy, Hitchcock crafts long 
establishing shots (remember the opening of 'Psycho'?), and paces some 
scenes slowly.  For a thriller, 'Vertigo' has relatively few frenetic 
scenes.  Modern audiences will yawn during a few of the characters' 
conversations, even though their dialogue was approved by the stamp of 
Hitchcock's wit.  If 'Vertigo' were to be remade, as Gus Van Sant remade 
'Psycho,' the newer text would be comparably inferior.  Certainly, 
though, a few plot elements could be borrowed, as it's hard to think of 
a film with such a stunning and thematically unified conclusion.
The rock band Harvey Danger demonstrates the lasting impact of 'Vertigo' 
in their song 'Carlotta Valdez.'  My son spotted the allusion 
immediately, and played the track from the CD 'Where Have All the 
Merrymakers Gone?'
One thing that is reinforced to me weekly, as I view modern movies:  the 
past is in no way inferior to the present.  Many of us have constructed 
borders around ourselves, and are convinced we do not like black and 
white films, or anything older than we are, or anything with subtitles.  
The list goes on.  For sure, Alfred Hitchcock is an original voice who 
takes his place in the canon of great directors, whether or not 
'Vertigo' makes everyone's short lists of the best films ever made.

Review for Mission: Impossible II (2000)
Watching John Woo's Mission Impossible II, I took note of a good deal of the 
fascinating images and remembered again why visual texts are taking the 
place of written ones.  These violent shots are so well choreographed and 
slick that it is hard not to feast on them as if they were the most tempting 
of junk foods.  The scenes of chasing and fighting in this film are nearly 
as ballet-like as many scenes in The Matrix;  as a matter of fact, in an odd 
nod, the hero and villain in MI2 actually go airborne, their bodies 
colliding like those of Neo and his nemesis.
What this is leading up to is not a lecture but an observation:  a picture 
is not worth a thousand words; it is not worth even one.
What's the foundation to this argument?  We are discussing entertainment 
here.  And the images in modern action flicks move too quickly to digest and 
assimilate while we are watching the flick in the theater for probably the 
first and only time.  There are even gaping holes in the exposition: what is 
the IMF agency and what are Ethan Hunt's incentives to be such a big part of 
it?  Does he have a personal life, and what else does he do for relaxation 
beside the extremest of extreme sports?  Clearly the only scenes of 
character development are the briefest of glimpses of personalities, and all 
of these come second to the all-important fast pace of the plot.
Director John Woo and screenwriter Robert Towne include some nice variations 
on the premise of the old television series.  This time Hunt sees and hears 
about his mission from a pair of high-tech sunglasses, which he pitches away 
just as they `self-destruct.'  Recruiting a key member of his team for the 
mission is very difficult as well.  Hunt's boss Swanbeck (played by Anthony 
Hopkins) has stipulated that it must be the expert thief (but non-spy) Nyah 
Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton).  What they are after is the ruthless thieves 
who have stolen the anti-virus for a synthetic monster bug.  Led by sometime 
IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), these men have murdered hundreds of 
people by crashing a jetliner in the Rockies.  The setup for Hunt and Nyah 
is that they must find out and steal back whatever they can.
Tom Cruise is the co-star of this film.  The other star is the action.  
Cruise's Ethan Hunt is even more polished and buffed than he was in Brian 
DePalma's Mission Impossible.  Cruise's acting is not really different than 
his previous films.  He gets better at it the more times he tries it, but 
the man's range is not wide; he mostly reacts.  What makes his performance 
strong here is his physicality: leaps and kicks and last-second recoveries 
that are a pleasure to watch. Again, thanks to Woo, Cruise has been told 
exactly what to do, and the magic men of dubbing and editing and special 
effects do the rest.
One dimension of  Hunt's character that viewers find endearing is his 
compassion.  Whereas the agent-gone-evil Sean Ambrose takes lives with 
impunity, Hunt hesitates `to harm a hair on a security guard's head.'  For 
putting a value on human life, Hunt acts ironically, beating up on enough of 
Ambrose's men to qualify him as a one-man army.  A cool aspect of Cruise's 
acrobatics is his dead-on marksmanship, his bullets finding their mark even 
when they are fired at the last millisecond, Hunt's body in mid-flip, upside 
down or just off the ground.
The other star?  This stuff is purely eye-candy, as impossible in real life 
as any James Bond stunt.  But when we see Ethan Hunt on his motorcycle, 
jumping and flying down a ramp and through the traces of flame left by an 
enemy's destroyed car, we are enrapt.  Simple fight scenes now require 
expertise in martial arts, and often it's like watching an aggressive dance 
in which the combatants come off the floor without bruises or even 
exhaustion.  Why can't we see at least one tooth being spat out of a bloody 
mouth?
As Nyah Nordoff-Hall, the professional thief, Thandie Newton plays it a 
little too simply.  After initial stubbornness and even an attack (by car) 
on Hunt, Nyah quickly goes down to Hunt's charm, and she smiles widely 
whenever he holds her in his arms.  Newton does, however, show spurts of 
very solid acting.
A motif we hear early  from the scientist who created the monster virus  
is that for every hero, there has to be a villain, and this is clever not 
just because it is self-reflexive.  The sentiment calls up what we hold as 
important values in people: namely, Ethan Hunt's loyalty versus Sean 
Ambrose's betrayal.  Dougray Scott is very good at playing this baddie.  He 
adopts such nonchalance that we hate him without effort.  In a particularly 
suspenseful sequence, Ambrose anticipates Hunt's moves and motivations, 
attempting to thwart Hunt's destruction of the virus.  In a quietly menacing 
performance, Scott leads us to the inevitable confrontation between the two 
super-spies.  (One small problem I may as well mention here is that Ambrose 
-- as well as the movie -- employs too many uncannily accurate masks.)
Ving Rhames is back as the techie, Luther Stickell.  His is purely a support 
role, as he sits in the van with the computers, or fires shoulder-held 
rockets from a chopper piloted by an Australian helper, Billy.  Rhames is 
not given many lines, but his appearance is still authoritative and sure.
The score is mostly transparent.  There are some nice modernizations of the 
Mission: Impossible theme song.  But it's hard to tell if Hans Zimmer 
arranged them or composed variations, along with the original music.
I came out of the theater last night pleased with what I had seen.  But the 
more I think about it, the more I notice the dumbing down of movies.  
Anthony Hopkins must have noticed it when he had to read the line, `Her 
criminal record will be expunged, wiped out.'  This is just a small example 
of a lack of subtlety that, snowballing, will create outright insults to the 
intelligence.  Like books, movies come in various types; let's call them 
heavy watching and light watching.  What we are demanding from Hollywood is 
a large number of light watches  since this is late May, the equivalent of 
fluffy novels that can be read under a beach umbrella, books that require 
little if any real thought.  This is fine, of course.  It's just that I 
don't like a steady diet of junk.

Review for Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season (1999)
It's a sure bet the family will enjoy 'Shiloh 2', the film based Phyllis 
Reynolds Naylor's 'Shiloh Season', the second book of the 'Shiloh' trilogy.
Young Marty Preston (Zachary Browne) has saved the beagle Shiloh from the 
clutches of a ne'er-do-well neighbor, Judd Travers (Scott Wilson).  But Judd 
resurfaces, his drunkenness and bad temper escalating.  Marty's father Ray 
(Michael Moriarty) believes Judd is hunting without permission on Preston 
land, and to make things worse, Judd makes overtures toward reclaiming 
Shiloh.  At one point Judd's dogs run loose, and one of Marty's sisters is 
bitten on the leg.  Clearly, Judd is a threatening presence.
Then something happens to Judd Travers.  Lassie-like, Shiloh leads Marty to 
Judd's overturned truck, saving the man's life.  Will Judd ever lose his 
apparent hatred?  Marty sets out trying to befriend him, following the 
example of his loving dog Shiloh.
As Marty, Zachary Browne is mostly convincing;  he is even endearing during 
his confrontations with Judd Travers, Browne's eyes full of sincerity and 
fear.
As Ray Preston, Michael Moriarty turns in an average performance.  His 
acting skills are apparent, yet he plays the role with little or no 
expression:  too low-key are his replies and  warnings in conversations with 
other characters.  His wife Louise, played by Ann Dowd, is much stronger in 
her portrayal of a concerned parent.  In one scene, protecting her daughter 
and other children from the vicious dog, Mrs. Preston swings a broom with 
frantic protectiveness.  Just as she is believable in her disdain of Judd, 
her husband Ray acts unbelievably laid-back toward the main who seems to 
pose a threat to the family.
Rod Steiger plays Doc Wallace, the wise mentor to many of the area children. 
  Steiger's experience is visible in his natural manner, even in his expert 
blocking:  the scenes in which he appears are very watchable and 
well-directed.
Scott Wilson sketches Judd Travers with convincing hatefulness.  His drunken 
staggers are not overdone (although his frequent drunk driving without a 
sheriff giving chase is inexcusable).  Even when the script gives him too 
little to say, Judd maintains a sour face and convinces us he is a hard nut 
to crack.
What is not so well done is the portrayal of seventh graders.  One scene has 
all the children on a school bus, talking civilly and woodenly about the dog 
attack.  The kids in Marty's class are entirely too quiet and cooperative 
with their new teacher, Miss Talbot.
As one might expect, there are many opportunities for sentiment in the 
story.  But in general, director Dale Rosenbloom keeps the tone from 
becoming too sickly sweet.
Music by Joel Goldsmith assists the story unobtrusively, and a theme song by 
Rita Coolidge does a nice job of closing the narrative.
A warm-hearted story with an all-important message, 'Shiloh 2: Shiloh 
Season' will capture the fondness of any viewer.  With a story that only 
seems simple, the film is a solid bet for family enjoyment.  In an age in 
which so many filmmakers refuse to target children, 'Shiloh 2' captivates 
with a mixture of fun and intelligence.


Title
Review for Psycho (1998)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Why remake "Psycho," the grand-daddy of thrillers?  Alfred Hitchcock did 
it so well 38 and a half years ago.  The script by Joseph Stefano (from 
Robert Bloch's novel) was a classic, the music and even the credits were 
works of art, and the direction was artistic.
The most compelling reason I can think of is to reach modern audiences.  
I am reminded weekly that young people are turned off by black and white 
films.  Their very mention rankles the students in my high school film 
literature classes.  I might as well threaten to show art films with 
subtitles.  Or some of the filmstrips still stowed away in our library's 
cabinets, titles from 38 years ago like "Weaning Pigs" or "Why Go To the 
Moon?"  Or play an audio tape narrated by a dead British actor.
So director Gus Van Sant has given youth a chance.  They will see for 
the first time Hitchcock's captivating vision of pure film - even if 
it's done by an American nearly half a century later.  They will  see 
clever techniques worked seamlessly into a smart narrative.  Several 
kids, I'm sure, will rent or borrow copies of the source on videotape.  
Even if they have seen the original, they will witness subtle updates 
and intricate spins that will knock around in their memories for awhile.  
We showed Hitchcock's "Psycho" this past semester, and many students did 
not grumble, but realized its importance as a groundbreaking work.  
These students have all the more reason to see this recreation.  So Van 
Sant's homage will mean that the original film and its director will 
live even longer in our personal filmgoing histories.
Another reason for a remake is the acting (and a few of the preachier 
scenes) of the original.  Let's face it - Hitchcock's cast smacks of 
stiffness today, with no puns intended.  Granted, perhaps it was stylish 
to be wooden, just as it is stylish today to wear tacky polyester 
jackets and pseudo-70's rayon blouses.  (Can you tell I don't give much 
credit to the costumers of this latest incarnation?  I know they meant 
the wardrobes to be throwbacks to the kitsch of postwar America, as well 
as echoes of angst-filled grunge, but c'mon!)  Many of the performances 
of the new "Psycho" seem more natural and casual than their forebears.  
I think Anthony Perkins and Martin Balsam, that character actor's 
character actor, were among the highlights of the oldie.  This new one 
has stalwart performances from almost everyone.
Vince Vaughn plays Norman Bates, the mama's-boy-gone-way-wrong.  Norman 
runs a small motel made obsolete by the superhighway that bypasses it.  
He lives in an imposing house up the hill from the cabins, a house also 
apparently occupied by his mother.  When a lone young woman - Marion 
Crane, played by Anne Heche - stops to get out of a rainy night, 
Norman's psychosis kicks in, and Marion is the victim of a terrible 
punishment.  (For what is she being punished?  Stealing the $400,000?  
Sleeping with Sam Loomis without being his wife?  The latter would seem 
absurd in terms of 1990's values.)  When Marion's sister Lila fails to 
locate Marion, she panics and leaves Phoenix for California, where Sam 
lives.  There's also a private detective involved, one Milton Arbogast 
(the ubiquitous William H. Macy).  The bulk of the plot traces the 
attempts of this trio in locating Marion, ostensibly at the last place 
she was seen - the Bates' place.
In his reprise of the Bates role, Vaughn is more menacing than Anthony 
Perkins.  Vaughn wears shorter hair and longer sideburns, and 
occasionally glowers like a leering devil.  His performance is strong, 
but considering Perkins' ownership of the role, a comparison would 
benefit no one.  Vaughn is good with the nervous candy-eating habit, but 
weak with the awkward chuckle.  Heche's version of Marion Crane is very 
expressive.  Her face reacts variously:  she's a cold customer at first, 
but in Norman's "parlor" she is compassionate, smiling, horrified.  
Julianne Moore is fitting as the equally cold sister.  In a brief comic 
relief bit, she shakes off Sam Loomis' arm as they enter one of Norman's 
cabins.  No matter who plays the Cranes, the script virtually 
predetermines our lack of concern for them.  Viggo Mortensen, as Sam 
Loomis, continues the slovenly hipness established by the wardrobe and 
sets;  perhaps our  distance from him, Marion and Lila shifts our 
sympathy from the ruination of their lives to the oddly compelling 
predicaments of Norman Bates.
Now for what Van Sant saw fit to change.  This is his "re-creation" of 
"Psycho," so he shot the same number of scenes on each day of the same 
six-week period used by Hitchcock.  The dialogue is mostly intact, and 
the music and cinematography have been only slightly tweaked.  What I 
liked includes some of the striking shots in the stabbing scenes.  
Again, the shower scenes should not even be compared.  For its time, 
Hitchcock's was unique and shocking; for any time, it was superior.  And 
I don't think Van Sant was out to one-up the master.  But this new 
showering does catch and sustain attention.  Particularly impressive is 
an extreme close-up in which Marion's pupil dilates as she is dying.  
Characters in this film also seem to have flitting hallucinations as the 
life force leaves them.  There are infrequent updates, as when Lila 
says, "Let me get my Walkman."  We witness at least one distasteful 
scene with Norman peeping at Marion - though I wonder if "Hitch" 
wouldn't have included it himself, had the censors and the country's 
milieu permitted.  A final nice touch is mysterious murmuring inside the 
house of Bates, a little aural stimulation that might make himself 
chuckle politely.  Applause to Van Sant for retaining the set 
decoration, especially in the parlor, where Marion, positioned beside 
the rounded shapes of a lamp and a pitcher, is surrounded by the beaks 
and talons of Norman's stuffed birds, not to mention the sharp triangle 
of the sandwich half she never eats.
One scene that could not be improved upon - because it was blatant and 
talky to begin with - is the explanation of Norman's illness.  It's 
delivered by Robert Forster instead of Simon Oakland, but it still rings 
false.  At least Van Sant edited out the ineffectual line, "He's a 
transvestite."
A good purpose "Psycho" could serve would be interesting young people in 
its predecessor.  After watching both, viewers could think critically 
for themselves.  And as long as they don't give lame reasons like, "It 
was better because it was in color," I  wouldn't blame them for liking 
either one.  
One question I have wasn't answered because the movie was not released 
for critics to pre-screen:  outside the real estate office, is that 
Hitchcock in a final, computer-generated cameo?


Title
Review for Smoke Signals (1998)
"Do you want lies, or do you want the truth?" Suzy Song asks Thomas 
Builds-the-Fire.
"I want both," Thomas (Evan Adams) replies.
This is one of the layers of meaning in Chris Eyre's film SMOKE SIGNALS.  
As much as anything, it's about the thrill of a good story, the 
importance of stories in our lives and especially in our individual 
pasts.  As Thomas tells his stories he holds very still, eyes closed, 
head tilted toward the heavens.  For him it's a religion of narrative, 
telling tales about his life and friends, not bothering to separate out 
the threads of falsehood from the fabric of his accounts.  Evan Adams 
delivers probably the strongest performance in the work, his voice full 
of inflection and poetry, his tone the perfect mix of seer and nerd.
His friend Victor Joseph is the only one who complains about Thomas' 
stories.  Victor (Adam Beach) has lived on the Idaho reservation all his 
life, growing up with Thomas, hearing the same stories endlessly.  What 
bothers Victor the most is that Thomas idolizes Victor's father Arnold, 
who deserted the family when the boys were ten.  It was Arnold (Gary 
Farmer) who saved the infant Thomas from the fire that killed Thomas' 
parents; Arnold who took the orphan to Denny's and bought him the Grand 
Slam breakfast.  But it was Victor who had to live through his father's 
alcoholic flights of fancy and through the dark days of abuse.
The main premise turns the film into a travelogue in which the adult 
Victor and Thomas ride a bus to Arizona to retrieve the ashes of Arnold.  
On the journey there and back they meet people and situations that 
change them, and show the viewer much about contemporary attitudes 
toward Native Americans.
When William Faulkner said, "The past isn't dead.  It's not even past," 
he was talking about the kind of suffering Victor and his mother, Arlene 
Joseph, have been undergoing.  Using flashbacks that melt instantly into 
scenes of the present, the film takes the type of risks that ensure the 
success of stories.  Victor displays an appropriate anger toward his 
now-dead father, and we even excuse his unfair treatment of the lovable, 
eccentric Thomas.  A straight-talker, Victor is aware of the prejudices 
that still stalk Native Americans, especially two long-haired young men    
venturing off the reservation and into the "foreign" country of the 
United States.  In a scene in which unshaven white men take Victor's and 
Thomas' seats on the bus, we are shown traces of hate in even the most 
common experience.  Perhaps Victor learned a modicum of hate himself 
from his father, who wished to make the white man disappear.  In a 
fascinating motif involving magic, it is Arnold who makes himself 
vanish, accomplishing yet another feat that he "didn't mean to."
SMOKE SIGNALS is weak in its overuse of things Indian.  Although Thomas' 
voice-over at the start and finish is well-written, it sets a tone that 
touches upon countless cliches.  We hear allusions to the oral tradition 
(Thomas's storytelling), to George Armstrong Custer, John Wayne and Tom 
Mix, to the stoic face a Native American must turn to his troubles.  
Yes, these elements are part of the culture, and some very humorous use 
is made of them.  But the film's greatness does not hinge upon their 
repetition.  Rather, the human elements cause the success:  Victor's 
long journey and change of heart, Thomas' unfailing friendship and goofy 
smile, Suzy Song (Irene Bedard's) decency and determination to help.
Touted as the first major film written, produced and directed by Native 
Americans, SMOKE SIGNALS came away a favorite at the Sundance Film 
Festival.  With a screenplay by Sherman Alexie (based on his book of 
stories THE LONE RANGER AND TONTO FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN), the film acts 
ultimately as an ode to the relationships between fathers and sons, as 
well as to the love visible in acts of kindness.  
I was grateful to have the chance to see SMOKE SIGNALS in the only 
cinema in our small midwestern city.  It seems the university is 
requiring all incoming freshman to read Alexie's book, and is sponsoring 
a visit by Alexie in just a few days.  Now I do not have to worry about 
finding a video store that carries independent art films.  Now my son 
and I have been enriched by witnessing a part of the world different 
than ours.


Title
Review for Edtv (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Ron Howard's 'EDtv' is full of ideas that double back upon their own 
trails, like tricky raccoons on the run.
Where else but in Hollywood would you find a work that indicts 
television, made by people whose roots are in television?  Ron Howard 
starred in 'The Andy Griffith Show' and 'Happy Days.'  Rob Reiner, who 
plays Mr. Whitaker the network honcho, was the meathead Michael Stivic 
in 'All in the Family.'  Woody Harrelson, the title character's brother 
Ray, attained major airtime in 'Cheers.'  Even Clint Howard, a fixture 
in all of his brother's movies, played a couple of seasons in 'Gentle 
Ben.'
Their experience certainly serves them well in 'EDtv,' as we see 
realistic treatments of what goes on behind the camera.  It seems that 
each character in the film has an agenda, a collection of motives that 
are always self-serving and selfish.  In the end the film is a dead-on 
satire that entertains but, paradoxically, contradicts itself with a 
Hollywood ending.
A producer at a floundering cable television network, Cynthia (Ellen 
DeGeneres) conceives a risky scheme intended to boost ratings.  She runs 
a contest in which countless average citizens audition to have their 
daily lives put on the air.  What is Cynthia's hope?  That she'll save 
her own career as well as the careers of her staff.  It's a last-ditch 
attempt, and it succeeds.  Though at first the life of Ed (Matthew 
McConnaughey) appears boring (how long can viewers be captivated by 
tours of Ed's apartment and by the flavor of his down-home stories?), 
the program soon becomes as exciting as the juiciest soap opera.
When does the ho-hum documentary become drama?  When the camera crew 
follows Ed to his brother Ray's apartment, 'EDtv' watchers discover Ray 
has spent the night with a woman who is not his girlfriend.  Said 
girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman, TV's Dharma) phones immediately to 
confront Ray.  The nastiness escalates when Ed takes the crew to the 
digs of the offended Shari, his purpose to plead Ray's case.  Passionate 
whims take over, however, and we witness an unwitting kiss as Ed and 
Shari fall for each other.  What follows is not as down and dirty as 
'The Jerry Springer Show,' but still vile and savage.
As the title character, Matthew McConnaughey turns in his best 
performance in memory.  Ron Howard directs well the sequences in which 
we see Ed's Texas charm.  Ed is a 31 year-old under-achiever, a video 
store clerk who is unremarkable but nevertheless likable.  In previous 
roles McConnaughey seemed two-dimensional at best, but here we care 
about his character when the television show begins to make off with his 
dignity.  Sure, Ed has fun for awhile;  McConnaughey elicits our 
sympathy for Ed when things start to go really wrong.
Woody Harrelson has no trouble being the most flamboyant presence in the 
film.  His Ray is passionate, rascally, vindictive.  We can imagine this 
guy writing a book called 'My Brother Pissed On Me,' though he has never 
even read a book.  It's unfortunate that Harrelson's screen time 
dwindles as the film progresses.
Jenna Elfman is fine as Shari;  she plays well the part of being 
embarrassed by the ever-present cameras.  Shari is a driver for UPS, and 
of course becomes the object of national scrutiny as her budding, 
somewhat forbidden romance with Ed appears in every living room.  Her 
wounded act becomes stale after awhile, though.  As Ed and Ray's 
stepfather Al, Martin Landau delivers another memorable supporting 
performance.  Too bad this movie appears too early in the year to be 
remembered for the Oscars.  In a small role, Clint Howard is convincing 
as the man faced with following Ed's footsteps, coordinating the 
broadcast from the television truck.  This outing brings some 
characterization, as Clint Howard's technician has hair plugs:  "I've 
stopped payment on the plugs.  You gave me doll hair!" he rages into a 
phone at one point.  Perhaps this Howard deserves a bigger part next 
movie - his face is certainly sharp and intriguing in middle age.
An unusual motif is noticeable in the way characters spend their spare 
time.  As they watch television - which is always on, in homes and bars 
- these people seem constantly to be exercising.  They peddle curious 
stationary bikes, lift weights, all in pursuit of the slimness and 
fitness that the filmmakers suggest are included in the goals of average 
Americans.  Even more curious is Ed's status as blue-collar hero:  in 
fact he's a chameleon with his accent, switching from a neutral 
middle-American diction to an East Texas twang at will.  The result for 
the viewer carries a disappointing, Roseanne-like effect.  This guy's 
posing as a good old boy but embraces the same materialistic and 
romantic ends as the rest of us.
Another of the film's agendas is to meet the standards of political 
correctness.  In portraying the audience of Whitaker's network, the 
writers show the gamut of races and preferences:  a homosexual couple, 
an African-American couple, even a group of factory workers.  Although 
the device of highlighting these viewers' responses is right out of 'The 
Truman Show,' it serves as a fascinating sort of subplot.  Many of the 
responses themselves are hilarious, but their ultimate purpose is a 
self-reflexive parody.  Let's face it - we American viewers are the 
targets of Howard's double-edged satire.  Yes, the movie attacks the 
executive schlumps, but it also assaults the mind-sets that demand the 
type of programming of which EDtv is a sleazy example.  What you have to 
love about the film is that it pokes so much fun not only at the average 
Joe - represented by Ed Pekurney and his family - but at the average 
jerk who tunes in. 
There's no question Ron Howard knows the formula for a slick and 
successful Hollywood movie.  In 'EDtv' he and his screenwriters, 
veterans Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, depict life's hard knocks and 
nuances;  but the last quarter of the film neatly fits back into the 
mold of happy and romantic closure.  The film is generally pleasing, 
especially in its treatment of Americans' obsession with media in all 
its crafty forms.  Ideas flow freely here, and fans can only hope that 
at least one of the films in his future will buttress Howard's headiness 
with a risky and less mainstream ending.

Review for 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics at http:/www.ofcs.org
Shakespeare is spinning in his grave.
Picture this figure of speech.  It's not so much poetic as graceless and 
gross, much like Gil Junger's 10 Things I Hate About You, a film loosely 
based on the Bard's The Taming of the Shrew.
Here's the premise:  two beautiful sisters living in Washington state 
stand for opposite worldviews  one superficial and pleasure-seeking, 
the other feminist and intelligent.  The position of Bianca Stratford 
(Larisa Oleynik), peeved that she is not allowed to date boys, worsens 
when her obstetrician father changes the rule.  Now Bianca can date only 
when Kat dates!  This seems unlikely, as Kat is the shrew of 
Shakespeare's title, a determined little termagant who shuns guys only 
after she has mentally outshone them. Here now  complications.  At 
wit's end, Bianca exploits a boy with a crush on her, a new kid in 
school named Cameron (Joseph Gordon Levitt).  In a convoluted series of 
schemes, a handsome bad boy (Patrick Verona, played by Heath Ledger) is 
paid to woo Kat.  Hence Bianca is free to date the slimy Joey Donner 
(Andrew Keegan), although she had suggested she'd be dating Cameron in 
return for his favor.
Still with it?  The basic love stories are promising, especially a minor 
one involving a friend of Cameron's and a friend of Kat's.  But the 
turns of romantic plot are too predictable, and the resulting 
relationships fall flat.  How can viewers believe a repulsive young man 
like Verona can become a desirable, even noble character?  Does Bianca 
truly overcome her shallowness and attain a mantle of decency?  And most 
crucially, why is the shrew tamed so relatively easily?  Heaps of 
questions occur to the watcher of this film.
Julia Stiles is the most striking cast member, and does a strong job 
portraying Kat's feminist bent.  Karen McCullah Lutz's screenplay, 
though, casts Kat as a closet Barbie, ready to comply when she is 
pleased.  A strong facial resemblance helps Oleynik in being convincing 
as the sister.  Oleynik is fine as Bianca, especially in portraying the 
occasional shallowness that is such a strong contrast to Kat's cultural 
politics.
Larry Miller plays the father of Kat and Bianca as an overprotective 
buffoon.  He's an undeveloped caricature about whom we ultimately care 
very little.  Let it be enough to say that the writing has him telling 
us about his character, when real characters show themselves.  Needless 
to say, his wife is missing from the scene.  The result does not make us 
sympathize for the plight of his single parenthood, as much as it makes 
us wonder if screenwriters don't kill parents off just to have less 
characters to flesh out fully.
In a couple of small roles, David Leisure and Daryl Mitchell play 
teachers who add funny moments to the film.  But the tones of their 
characterization again intrude, and the viewer wonders if she is 
watching realism or over-the-top camp.  The filthy language and personal 
insults used by Mr. Morgan (Mitchell's teacher) are downright 
unbelievable.  It's almost as though the film is trying to exaggerate in 
the same way the situations in Clueless were exaggerated  but 10 Things 
is much less successful.
The film's faults are many.  For one, Budweiser must have paid dearly 
for product placement.  How advisable is it, however, to place your 
product in the hands of hundreds of actors playing underage drinkers?  
Another, larger flaw is the sense of irresponsibility.  Again and again 
the youngsters peopling the film do nasty things to  each other and fail 
to pay for them.  From silly schtick  Bianca shooting her coach with an 
arrow  to major deception, 10 Things I Hate About You reinforces the 
notion that horrible behaviors often don't carry consequences.  Yes, 
there are the conventions of teen movies:  references to sex, scanty 
clothing (enough navels, already!) and endless sight gags.  Not that a 
film must be politically correct, but this one also points out several 
cliques, poking fun at each of them.  The satire is done nicely, but in 
the end the tone is less than tolerant.  Oh, besides Mitchell, there is 
one African-American actress, Gabrielle Union, as one of Bianca's 
shallow friends.  The lack of diversity is one shortcoming, but it's the 
film's careless accenting of reckless attitudes that crosses the line 
from harmless fluff to become offensive drivel.  In the current flood of  
teen-oriented films, when is a director going to respect this line?
The tie-in with Shakespeare is what drew my attention.  No similar 
relation exists with the spate of new teen flicks.  So for the millions 
of moviegoers not targeted by filmmakers exploiting this genre, do not 
hesitate to miss them.  Even the use of Good Will could not add weight 
to this piece;  come on, how much more lightness do the young people of 
the world need?

Review for Lilies of the Field (1963)
Search the Archives at http://www.movie-page.com
"Lilies of the Field" was a small, good novel made into a small, good movie.
Think of the book and film versions of Glendon Swarthout's "Bless the Beasts 
and Children," or even Charles Portis' "True Grit."  These are not major 
works of twentieth-century literature, but they are solid and typically 
American in their strong, independent characters and distinctive human 
interaction.  Ralph Nelson's film takes William E. Barrett's book and turns 
it into a plain, intriguing tale.
Homer Smith (Sidney Poitier), the novel tells us, is and ex-GI.  (The movie 
is sparer than the book in this area, telling us very little about his 
background;  we know only that he is Southern Baptist, and that he is 
traveling in his station wagon/home through the American Southwest.)  
Stopping at a desolate mission in the desert, Homer asks a nun for water for 
his overheating car.  Moments later he examines his skinny wallet and 
decides to do a few chores for the nuns, before he moves on to whatever city 
happens to come next.
But a few chores turn into a hot and cold relationship of several months' 
duration.  Mother Maria (Lilia Skala) puts off Homer's requests for payment, 
but looks heavenward gratefully for the "big, strong man He has sent" to 
build a chapel in the convent compound.  At first reluctant to undertake 
this daunting task, Homer tangles with a big-time builder named Ashton, in 
town, and ends up driving Ashton's bulldozers two days a week.  So some cash 
is coming in while Homer struggles with constructing a modest adobe church 
in the torrid sun - that is, until he runs out of bricks.
Sidney Poitier is masterful as Homer Smith; this is one of the roles that 
Poitier will be remembered for.  His subtle humor fills the plot, even 
becoming hilarious at times.  In one scene Homer is teaching the German nuns 
English, and he cannot help himself from modeling for them some Southern 
black dialect: Instead of "I stand up," he grins as the sisters follow his 
"Ah stands up, y'all"!  Homer is so likable because he is good-natured, but 
Poitier lends texture to his character mainly through his interaction with 
his foil, the Mother Superior who will not thank him for all of his labors.  
Watch for strong muscial scenes from Poitier as well, in which he 
intermingles his own religious background with the nun's East Germany 
Catholicism.
Lilia Skala is appropriately stern and commanding as Mother Maria.  We know 
the sisters have come a long way, even over the Berlin Wall, to get to this 
inherited property in the American desert.  The broken English spoken by her 
and her charges serves to endear the nuns to us.  They are all humble but 
fiercely devoted people.
As Juan, Stanley Adams does nice work.  Although his accent and diction 
smack of falseness - this man seems to want to revert to a Bronx twang - 
Adams musters a rascally nonchalance that bonds him with Homer.  Juan also 
functions as a template for the modern age:  Catholic-born, this agnostic 
now serves meals in his restaurant while the traveling priest says mass for 
the people who have come from far and wide.
Dan Frazer does well as Father Murphy, the priest whose prayers for a 
massive cathedral were answered with a trailer with bald tires.  And 
director Ralph Nelson ( who made many films beside this one, notably 
"Requiem for a Heavyweight," "Father Goose" and "Charly) acquits himself 
well as Mr. Ashton, the slightly racist builder who employs Homer and who is 
the victim of Mother Maria's constant pleas for donations.
Jerry Goldsmith's score lends light-hearted fun to many scenes.  The 
segueways are particularly interesting, with folksy harmonica swipes 
accompanying Homer's station wagon on the dusty hills.
If you are looking for a small but thought-provoking work, a film that 
covers tolerance and faith and friendship through its exploration of a most 
unlikely relationship, watch "Lilies of the Field."

Review for Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, The (2000)
The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2000)
I don't think you would turn over in your grave if you saw the new 
incarnation of your 1960's cartoon.  The actor Robert DeNiro and a friend of 
his produced The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, and they did a pretty 
good job.  DeNiro took the role of Fearless Leader for himself, and he 
brings it off well.  Why?  Because he does it with a lot of humor and is not 
afraid to send up even himself (in a `You talking to me?' takeoff of his 
Travis Bickle role in Taxi Driver).  Funny stuff
I like that Des McAnuff, the director, makes the humans play second fiddle 
to the animated stars.  The rounded, smooth, balloon-like skin of the 
animated flying squirrel and the bird-brained moose adds a very watchable 
dimension.  You would be glad to hear that June Foray is back as Rock's 
voice, that unique, thinly hoarse touch intact.  And since you can't do the 
moose, Australian Keith Scott is a great second choice; he also does the 
narrator, with a flair just short of the talent of William Conrad.  Anyhoo, 
the `Moose and Skvorl!' were the funniest and noblest characters in the 
piece.
I don't understand.  Why would that Minnie Mogul (Janeane Garofalo) the 
movie producer want to deal with Fearless Leader and his gang anyway?  She 
surely wouldn't do it for the money!  Suddenly Fearless Leader is real 
(played by Bobby DeNiro, I think), and Boris Badenov (Jason Alexander) and 
Natasha Fatale (Rene Russo) are out to turn the television viewers of 
American into mindless zombies!  What a silly idea, losing the ability to 
think because you watch too much television!  Rocky and I were just 
wandering around Frostbite Falls Minnesota, where all the trees were cut 
down and the cartoon population were all out of work, our cartoon 
`messterpiece' canceled back in 1964.  So something really realistic had to 
happen, and sure enough, this nice-looking blond FBI agents (the FBI has a 
lot like her, I'd wager!) named Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) magically gets 
Rock and me to appear in Hollywood.  What she wants us to do is get to New 
York City in time to stop Fearless Leader from making his final broadcast, 
in which he plans to zombify the whole country, and get them to vote for him 
for President!  What a ride (car ride, that is) Rock and I have ahead of us 
 although I still can't figure out why we couldn't have gotten ahold or a 
plane or something else.  After all, Boris and Natasha steal a helicopter 
and almost succeed in reducing me and Rock to Internet images with that 
teeny satellite computer thingy.
We'll find out today if America remembers this goofy duo.  Will it be a hit, 
like George of the Jungle, or a miss, like The Adventures of Dudley Doright? 
  (At least we don't have to pay Bredan Fraser's salary again!)  Although I 
wonder about getting really talented actors like Rene Russo and Jason 
Alexander, and then underusing them.  After all, who did you see more of in 
the cartoon  here Fearless Leader gets more lines than Boris and Natasha 
combined!  And what about this side plot in which the agent and our heroes 
go on trial.  It's not a bad punch line with the moose, but the whole arrest 
things drags just a bit, I think.  In a sequel, if we get the box office to 
pitch one, it'll be more action and even more bad puns.  So I brought my own 
kids to the preview, and they loved it.  We saw every age from babies to 
baby boomers in the theater.  I just hope not all theaters keep jacking up 
the prices: our neighborhood multiplex (is that an oxymoron?) raised 
admission to $4.50 for matinees!


Title
Review for Snow Falling on Cedars (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
The opening shot of SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS shows a white miasma:  it's hard 
to tell if we are in a dream sequence, underwater, or in a thick fog.  It 
turns out to be the fog, and we see many other striking shots filmed in the 
same artful and patient manner.  The film is beautifully photographed by 
cinematographer Robert Richardson:  in fact, the imagery, along with the 
roundabout storytelling by director Scott Hicks, helps to make a rather 
ordinary story into a very appealing one.
The order of Hicks's narrative is all out of whack;  it's on purpose, of 
course, as Hicks takes chances with flashbacks and brief memories.  One 
advantage is that we escape a long, uninterrupted courtroom scene:  instead, 
we are able to watch segments blended well with the background tales that 
led to the trial.  A second plus is discovering the motivations of various 
characters, the timing acting most of the time as an engaging surprise.
The action takes place in the fictional county of San Piedro, on an island 
off Washington state, between the years 1941 and 1951.  A Japanese-American 
fisherman, Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), is on trial for the murder of a 
fellow fisherman.  Kazuo has an ancient but brilliant defense lawyer, Nels 
Gudmundsson (Max Von Sydow); the other side however, has a cagey prosecutor, 
Alvin Hooks (James Rebhouse), as well as the collective prejudice of the 
jury and white community.  Who will prevail?  The trial ends up occupying 
our interest less than the stories that engendered it.
Up in the courtroom balcony the editor of the "Island Review" newspaper, 
Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), is observing the trial.  Even more closely, 
he observes Kazuo's wife Hatsue.  A backstory shows us how they grew up 
together, fell in love, and separated tragically.  Again, prejudice results 
in family and community rejecting any type of mixed marriage;  the theme 
carries farther with the internment of Japanese-Americans in camps for the 
duration of the Second World War.
Some of the most affecting scenes in the film show these citizens, many of 
them residents of the area for years, uprooted and loaded into army trucks 
bound for California.  A drumbeat with spare accompaniment plays as these 
people leave their lives and belongings, and march into an exile imposed by 
the United States government.  Hatsue has refused Ishmael's proposal of 
marriage, and leaves with her family.  In shots used in the movie trailer, 
we see Ishmael's face in a car window, Hatsue's reflected from the outside.  
They are separated.
Clearly his love for Hatsue has consumed much of his attention, turning into 
an obsession.  The plot gains some complication from Ishmael's stumbling 
upon evidence important to the trial.  It's here that the plausibility 
weakens, as the situation dictates that Ishmael must have adequate 
motivation for withholding material that could exonerate a man of a murder 
charge.  Ethan Hawke has never struck me as an actor who could play 
vindictive: all the more reason why the script, by Hicks and veteran 
screenwriter Ron Bass, should give his character stronger incentive to think 
about behavior so drastic.
Hawke is fine in all other scenes, wistful and pensive and lovesick. 
Ishmael's parents, Arthur and Helen, are portrayed by Sam Shepard and 
Caroline Kava, and they supply very strong support.  Arthur Chambers is the 
newspaperman with integrity, refusing to back down when townspeople cancel 
their ads and subscriptions, and deliver telephone threats, because they 
hate the editor's support of the Japanese-American community.  Shepard 
sports thin wire-rimmed spectacles, giving him a wise and avuncular look.  
In the film's later time setting, 1951, Arthur is dead and Ishmael's mother 
takes a bigger role.  As a matter of fact, she is aware of her son's 
preoccupation with Hatsue, and tells him what he must ultimately do:  Forget 
her, she's a married woman.
Max Von Sydow delivers a deceptively simple performance.  Though he makes 
his role seem effortless, one can imagine the thought the actor put into his 
speech and body language.  As I watched him I could not help but think:  
what if the casting director and Hicks had switched the actors playing the 
lawyers?  What could Von Sydow have done in the role of the prosecutor 
trying to convict the hapless fisherman?  James Rebhorn, after all, was 
typecast as this slightly slippery, pencil-mustache-wearing attorney.
As the object of Ishmael's love, Youki Kudoh plays Hatsue with a nice 
understatement.  Here the script helps in clarifying the way a woman of 
Japanese descent must act: "You wouldn't understand," a young Hatsue tells a 
teenage Ishmael.  Kudoh often appears wide-eyed and stunned, but this 
expression is usually part of the cultural mores that dictated her 
behaviors.
Between sequences of non-linear narration, the visual storytelling is often 
inspired.  True to the title, snow falls on tall, shred-barked cedars, as 
well as on a breathtaking and rugged countryside.  The set is also decorated 
with countless vintage vehicles.  But the most striking visuals include 
strangely beautiful underwater images:  the drowned fisherman sinking, the 
soupy fog, even Ishmael in full combat gear floating downward in his attempt 
to participate in an assault on an enemy beach.  To an extent, most of the 
main characters seem at some point to be suffocating, oppressed by the 
closeness of ignorance and hate and injustice.  Whereas what we see often 
inspires awe, the filmmakers went out their way to simulate a period mood by 
using sepia-tinted film throughout much of the story.  In many scenes this 
aura of brown grew distracting:  why not just use black and white, or a miz 
of color and non-color, instead of a fake tinge of age?
The film is rated PG-13 for one instance of strong language, love-making 
scenes, and images of battle carnage and corpses.  Parents would feel 
comfortable taking most 12 year-olds to view with them.


Title
Review for Bulworth (1998)
I can remember my teenage movie-going and the stars that shone the 
brightest.  Clint Eastwood could always be counted on for a good two 
hours.  Jack Nicholson won Best Actor for 1975 as Randal Patrick 
McMurphy in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," a film that aroused my 
young hate of injustice.  Warren Beatty (along with Julie Christie) was 
cool in "Heaven Can Wait."
The fact that all of these professionals are not only still working, in 
late-middle-age, but winning awards and nominations (Eastwood's Oscar 
for "Unforgiven," Nicholson's for "As Good As It Gets," Christie's nod 
for "Afterglow," Beatty's statuette for "Bugsy") says a lot.
Mostly it tells of the importance of social issues in movies.  Beatty 
especially has been taking jabs at human foibles for a long time.  I 
wasn't a teen any longer when "Reds" was released;  I was an English 
major who appreciated the rendering of journalist Jack Reed (and the 
featuring of Eugene O'Neill!), and who admired, with heady idealism, the 
importance of historical drama.
In "Bulworth," Beatty's attempts at satire are broad.  His targets, his 
methods, his humor  all are as broad as the mouth of the caricature of 
Beatty used to advertise the film.
Jay Billington Bulworth, Democratic senator from California, is a cliché 
of a politician.  Estranged wife.  Businessmen buying his interests.  At 
film's start we see him locked in his office, depression bearing down 
hard on him, surrounded by photographs from his career (one with Beatty 
from his "Shampoo" days is superimposed in a shot with Bobby Kennedy).  
What Bulworth does to emerge from the jaded funk is even more cliched  
he commissions a hit on himself.  
The bigger chunks of the film are more original, though.  Of course the 
self-ordered murder motif surfaces throughout, but Beatty's handling of 
the falling and rising of Jay Bulworth makes for superior satire.
Beatty supposedly had full creative control  no studio honchos lurking 
on the set.  This advantage seems to have made all the difference.  Not 
many groups escape Bulworth's desperate, liberated tongue.  Rushing 
through Los Angeles on a bid for re-election, he alienates 
African-Americans, Jews, the entire insurance industry.  But it's 
refreshing, and as one might guess, his candor wins him votes.
Venturing into the world of three young African American women, Bulworth 
risks all respectability.  Here Beatty succeeds:  he has Bulworth go 
back to his political boyhood tricks, reading people's backgrounds and 
delivering on their wishes.  Bulworth's knack for picking up on black 
slang and, Zelig-like, using it for his own survival, serves as one of 
the film's funnier running jokes.  It was also chancy for Beatty to 
explore the underworld of rap, once again assuming the language and even 
the dress of a "homie."  The result is a brilliant rendition of the 
contrasts of Americans who are black and white.
Halle Berry turns in a solid performance as Nina, one of the women the 
couldn't-care-less senator invites into his stretch limo.  Berry almost 
underplays her character, a nice counterpoint to some of the 
conventional histrionics portrayed by other African American actresses.  
I wonder if Beatty will garner more controversy for his interracial 
relationship in the film, or for his winning a much younger woman.  
(Didn't Nicholson raise hackles when he won Helen Hunt in "As Good"?)
As Bulworth's chief of staff, Dennis Murphy (Oliver Platt) provides a 
good foil.  Not in the evil sense, but in the politically advisable one.  
He is appalled when Bulworth self-destructs;  yet he rallies and 
compensates hilariously.  Platt delivers a biting send-up of 
behind-the-scenes hyposcrisy when, railing against his boss's 
tendencies, he snorts cocaine with another toady.
Can an actor direct the subtleties of his own performance as well as he 
can the performances of others?  Mostly, Beatty's instincts take over 
and enable him to create a convincing character.  Occasionally, however, 
Bulworth seems too silent, his eyes hooded in confusion.  Granted, the 
man has neither eaten nor slept in three days, and he throws back a 
large dose of jetliner liquor;  but even at his physical worst, Bulworth 
should be played as exhausted, not empty-headed.
Lately Americans have been treated to "Wag the Dog" and "Primary 
Colors," films as well-made and funny as "Being There," which I saw with 
my dad when I was in high school.  Bulworth reminds us how important it 
is to hate injustice and inequality, as well as to embrace tolerance.  
In short, it reminds us of the important role of satire.


Title
Review for Haunting, The (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
If you've read Shirley Jackson's short story "The Lottery," you know the 
woman can spin a tale.  Her 1959 novel THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE is the 
basis for Jan De Bont's film, a mostly successful adaptation with 
state-of-the-art special effects and even some of the psychology handed down 
from Jackson's disturbing narrative.
The opening sequence brings us into the apartment and the life of Eleanor 
Vance (Lili Taylor), an early middle-aged woman whose mother has just died.  
Eleanor had cared for the woman for the last several years, and Eleanor's 
sister, her husband and bratty son are now making sure Eleanor gets the 
short end of the stick.  She will inherit her mother's old Gremlin 
automobile, and get evicted from the apartment.  Because she has not much to 
lose, Eleanor decides to take a break of sorts, and after a telephone 
solicitation, decides to take part in a study of sleep disorders.
Dr. Jeffrey Marrow - an excellent name - is running the study.  Marrow (Liam 
Neeson) is in fact a behavioral scientist seeking to assemble a controlled 
study group, for the purpose of examining his subjects' reactions to fear.  
That his actions are unethical doesn't motivate him to inform the sleep 
deprived trio of the true nature of the study.  He says, "You don't tell the 
rats they're really in a maze."
Thus we sit through the convention of the group assembling at a remote 
country house - Hill House - the estate of the textile magnate Hugh Crane.  
The three insomniacs arrive separately, a nice way for director De Bont to 
characterize them.  After Eleanor is shown to her room by the mysterious, 
taciturn wife of the caretaker, we meet the second of the group, Theo 
(Catherine Zeta-Jones).  Then Luke Sanderson (Owen Wilson) comes in, and we 
get to see more of the house.  Although this exposition goes rather slowly 
for modern audiences, it is backed up well by the old house itself.  In 
reality a school in England, the mansion seems to be overdecorated in every 
room, gothic touches and rococo flares everywhere.  Eleanor's bedroom has 
the feel of a deconsecrated chapel, filigreed trim leaking from the ceilings 
and walls.  A definite motif is the statues of children, their carved 
likenesses covering mantels throughout the house.  Marrow later explains 
that the builder of the house was childless, his wife having had many 
stillborn children before her suicide.
Where does the haunting come in?  Well, the interesting premise is that Dr. 
Marrow believes he is witnessing fictions and myths latent in the 
imaginations of his subjects.  Let their minds work in the night, he 
figures, and they will fall victim to fears they themselves haven woven.  So 
it is not until far into Eleanor's ordeals with the supernatural that Marrow 
begins to lend any credence to her behaviors.
It turns out of course that the long-dead Crane took a terrible secret to 
his grave, a secret still kept prisoner in the house.  The rest of the 
narrative follows Eleanor's quest to expose the momentous truth and to free 
the restless souls held captive.
The biggest performance here is Lili Taylor's.  This actress casts an 
amazing emotive truth upon her expressions, shedding tears or grimacing or 
acting blankly shocked, just this side of insanity.  An Academy Award 
nomination for Best Supporting Actress might be in order here.
Catherine Zeta-Jones does a nice job in a rather different role for her.  
Here Theodora is full of zest and guts, a switch-hitting and aggressive 
female who dares you to tell her she dresses sluttishly.  (At only one point 
does Zeta-Jones' Scottish accent, unfamiliar to most American movie-goers, 
slip through, when she shouts in anger at Dr. Marrow for his scientific 
remoteness.)  Theo makes for a nice contrast with the plainer Eleanor, 
without seeming superior.  And she's a great foil for Owen Wilson's 
fast-talking, rather hypochondriacal Luke.  Wilson lends the most comic 
relief to the story, appearing sometimes like a spacey clown;  nevertheless, 
he is protective of Eleanor when she begins to make claims about the 
horrendous history of the house.
Always reliable, Liam Neeson has a way in this film of making his presence 
strong yet quiet.  He's the doctor in charge of the study, watching from the 
background and recording his observations on a mini-recorder that Eleanor 
actually finds and plays once.  But Neeson is also careful not to overact, 
especially during one sequence in which he convinces his superior that it is 
necessary to set up the study by keeping the subjects in ignorance.  After a 
few more movies, Neeson will have the reputation of being as consistent and 
reliable as the best actors in the history of film.  Traces of slight brogue 
are just enough to fascinate American fans, giving the big man an edge over 
actors with more familiar dialects.
The bottom line is that "The Haunting" is solid but not outstanding.  Three 
stars out of four, a B+ -- whatever your rating, the film will supply you 
with some nifty visual thrills, and best of all, some delicious 
psychological ones.  Long after her death, Shirley Jackson is still an 
American writer with a talent for the fright-tale.


Title
Review for Perfect Storm, The (2000)
It's been  few days since I've seen Wolfgang Petersen's THE PERFECT STORM, 
and I don't like it as well as I did while I watched it.
I don't usually take this much time to percolate, to ponder over a film, 
before reviewing it.
Here's what I still think is very good:  The images of the hurricane itself, 
foreshadowed from early in the narrative, and climaxing at the end, are 
marvelous.  Much of this footage is computer generated, the waves as tall as 
buildings dwarfing the rather large swordfishing boat.  Often it is easy to 
pick out computerized work, especially when it involves water (think of the 
fake-y scenes in DEEP BLUE SEA),  but here the ocean appears real and 
threatening, a truly awesome natural force.  As the crew of the `Andrea 
Gail' valiantly fight to batten the windows and buck the waves, we 
understand somewhat the futility they must feel.
The acting is for the most part very strong.  I have always liked George 
Clooney, even though I thought he acted too much with those smiley eyes of 
his;  but in several scenes in STORM, Clooney seals the performance so far 
of his career.  He plays Captain Billy Tyne, who has brought his crew out on 
an extra fishing run, a result of a poor run from which they have just 
returned.  Tyne is a complicated man;  Clooney plays him as quiet yet 
fiercely proud and competitive.  When his crew suggests the `Andrea Gail' 
turn about, Tyne reveals his plans to venture even farther, halfway across 
the Atlantic even, to the `Finnish Cap,' where the real fish are.  This plot 
twist leads to the main conflict.  Will the men on the boat be able to 
navigate their way back home through the storm that has been ravaging the 
coast?  Where Clooney comes in is the scene in which Billy Tyne exerts his 
will over the crew.  It is a mixture of pep talk and threatening lecture, 
and Clooney's eyes are narrowed and dead serious.  Clooney proves himself a 
leading man, even more clearly than in another strong performance, in THREE 
KINGS.
We see good work from the supporting cast as well.  Mark Wahlberg is 
convincing as Bobby Shatford, who has cut bait and pack ships before, but 
who is a rookie in the actual fishing game.  The story follows his 
relationship with Christina Cotter (Diane Lane); this subplot serves as the 
romantic interest, as Tyne is divorced and living far from his family.  As 
`Murph,' John C. Reilly is always reliable, even though we don't know the 
full history of his hatred for another crew member, `Sully,' played by 
William Fichtner (remember him, the kooky SEAL from THE ABYSS, as well as 
the kooky astronaut from ARMAGEDDON?).  John Hawkes also plays an 
interesting, though sketchily developed character, in Michael `Bugsy' Moran.
What I think, upon second thought, is weak:  Petersen and screenwriter 
William D. Wittliff (from the non-fiction book by Sebastian Junger) work too 
hard at trying to build up the combination of cold fronts and hurricane that 
births this perfect natural disaster.  We watch rather disconnected scenes 
at a television news set in Boston, the meteorologist following the storm 
readouts as though he's witnessing the chance of his career.  There's no 
connection between this subplot and the main characters, and there is only a 
tenuous connection to a small craft, piloted by a rich man (Bob Gunton, the 
kooky warden in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION), and carrying two female 
passengers.  About to be swamped by the storm, the three are rescued at 
great risk by the crew of a Coast Guard chopper.  While the three shaken 
victims wait aboard the Guard cutter, the crew leave on another mission, to 
try and rescue the men of the `Andrea Gail.'
Actually, some of the scenes involving the trouble experienced by the 
chopper crew are some of the best in the film.  This suggests to me, though, 
that we need stronger connections between all of the subplots:  Petersen 
needs to work on his connectors.
My other major complaint concerns the ending.  Without spoiling it with 
specific revelations, I judge the closing now as too sentimental.  Perhaps 
one or even two scenes at the very end could be cut  then we would not have 
to sit through a couple of moments that try but fail to earn our tears.  It 
seems as though the director simply refused to end with the outcome of the 
sea story, and had to return to the women who waited faithfully on land.
So, the sea story works well on its own, the men battling each other and 
then the storm.  This microcosmic representation of the world is 
particularly interesting, as it calls up the madness of some scenes in 
Mellville's  MOBY DICK, the quintessential American novel.  What I'm 
thinking of is the pattern of bad omens that convinces the crew the voyage 
is doomed.  However, when the other subplots surface occasionally  the 
weatherman and the rich, bad sailor and the worried women back at home  
they give thin support to the main story.
On the whole, THE PERFECT STORM offers very solid summer entertainment, with 
some of the most gripping hurricane shots on film.  With a few reservations, 
I would recommend watching the film  particularly for the performances of 
Clooney, Wahlberg and Lane. But you may wish to wait for the video.


Title
Review for Toy Story 2 (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Q:  I've heard that "Toy Story 2" is better than the original.  Is this 
true?
A:  "Better" is relative.  The first edition did the work of establishing 
the characters, and the score was more solid.  "2" takes risks like adding 
new characters and sending nearly the whole cast on the road to rescue 
Woody.  The sequel has more action scenes, probably because Hollywood 
believes we viewers will surely be satisfied by more action.  On the whole, 
it's a very impressive film, and I wouldn't think an Oscar nomination would 
be far-fetched.
Q:  What was your favorite part?
A:  The animation never fails to amaze me.  I think the pioneers of cartoons 
would be fascinated by this technology.  Sometimes it's like seeing an 
exhibit of photorealist paintings:  you have to keep reminding yourself 
these images have been created!  I also like all the material put in for 
Boomers.  My wife was particularly impressed by the detail given to the old 
"Woody's Roundup" show - lunchboxes and record players and novelty toys, 
everything resembling kid stuff from 40 years ago.  So hype is not new.  My 
11 year-old daughter liked Woody's sidekick Jessie, the strong-willed 
cowgirl voiced by Joan Cusack.  And both my children liked the "Star Wars" 
and "Jurassic Park" allusions.  (When Mr. Potato Head - voiced by Don 
Rickles - threw his hat, I wasn't the only one to think "Oddjob.")
Q:  So what's the plot, basically?
A:  While he's rescuing a rubber penguin named "Wheezy" from a yard sale, 
Woody (Tom Hanks) accidentally ends up in the hands of a toy collector and 
dealer.  This slimy character, Al (voiced ably by Wayne Knight), actually 
steals Woody, after Andy's mom pulls the sheriff doll from the sale.  To sum 
up, the main plot consists of the main characters Buzz Lightyear (Tim 
Allen), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and Rickles as the 
potato, trying to locate and retrieve Woody.  The complications include 
Woody's discovery that he's a classic doll from the Howdy Doody era, worth 
much money to a toy museum in Japan, which is willing to pay the wily Al 
generously.  His reunion with Jessie, a sister-like pal, Bullseye the loyal 
and fleet horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammer) is 
intriguing, especially the grainy segments of the television show featuring 
the marionette-like dolls doing routines as simple as the ones Andy does 
with his dolls.  At one point Woody can't decide whether 'tis nobler to wear 
out in the hands of a loving child, or be preserved with his old-time 
buddies behind museum glass.
Q:  How about the non-animation aspects of the movie?
A:  The script is better written than many live-action movie scripts.  The 
dialogue is snappy and quirky, developing the characters easily.  It's a 
very kid-friendly film, a fact welcome in these days when most offerings in 
a mutiplex are R ratings.  There are probably fewer jokes per minute in this 
film, but as I've said, a little more action.  The music is still strong, 
but the two reprises of "You've Got a Friend" (one by Robert Goulet as 
Wheezy!) suggest the original movie has the edge in score.  Camera - or 
computer - angles are inventive and consistently clever, using the best 
options of the medium.
Q:  Tom Hanks or Tim Allen?
A:  Again, relative.  Whoever you like.  They are both so well cast!  Hanks' 
Woody seems natural with virtually any character he encounters;  there's a 
charming scene in which he puts Andy's real puppy through a series of 
tricks, and rubs the dog's belly until its leg waves in scratching.  Tim 
Allen is expert at Buzz's bravado;  the spaceman realizes he's a toy, and 
it's hilarious when he meets another Buzz doll, with the same voice, who has 
not been informed of the truth.
Q:  Here's an important question.  Will you buy the video?
A:  A sure thing.  It will be a great one to watch again and again, 
especially if you have kids.  It's as good as any Disney except, perhaps, 
"Beauty and the Beast."  John Lasseter and his co-directors have put scads 
of care and work into this production, and the jokes and cultural references 
alone are enough to qualify it as a classic.  Recommended for all ages, this 
movie is a sure bet to entertain parents and kids out for a nice afternoon, 
teens on a group date, or seniors, who will love a cameo by Geri of the 
chess cartoon "Geri's Game."


Title
Review for Primary Colors (1998)
I have not read the novel by "Anonymous" Joe Klein, and I wouldn't have 
picked the film "Primary Colors" as my first choice of the weekend, but 
I was pleasantly engaged.
First, John Travolta is right-on as Jack Stanton -- the Clintonesque 
quiet yet raspy drawl, the gut, the "tell me your pain" empathy. Emma 
Thompson is almost as strong as first lady-to-be Susan Stanton. In one 
scene in which this stolidly patient wife discovers another dalliance, 
Thompson snaps magnificently: it's as if her soul is slipping out of 
her. Her anger and then her grief are stunning to watch.
She'll probably be forgotten by the end of the year, but Kathy Bates 
should get nominated for supporting actress. As Libby the "Dust Buster," 
her character protects (as much as possible) the name of Jack Stanton, a 
friend from the 70's. Bates brings a literally crazy abandon to Libby, 
who is one of the few characters who is even concerned about taking and 
passing a morality test.
I've read in other reviews about a flaw in narration. Henry is the 
campaign worker through whose eyes we see most of the action. The 
trouble is that Adrian Lester turns in a performance that is solid but 
not dynamic. Sure, no one wants to try to out-act Bates and Travolta and 
Thornton, but Henry never shows us the passion that he claims to hold in 
his heart; he keeps it in his head. What causes him to stop working for 
one politician, to forfeit his relationship with a beautiful woman, to 
change his mind so easily when Jack Stanton asks him to?
"Primary Colors" sports a superb cast, down to the extras. Mike Nichols' 
last few efforts have been strong and solid, and this adds to the 
string. 


Title
Review for Elizabeth (1998)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
What provides 'Elizabeth' with a good deal of tension? As a viewer, it 
is not being sure that the woman who lends her name to the period will 
survive.  
We know she flourished, of course, but the early days of her reign were 
assailed by divers types of intrigues:  social, political, even sexual.  
And it is always fascinating to follow a figure when failure is not yet 
an impossibility.
We are quickly introduced to the religious persecution that went on in 
Great Britain in the 1550's.  Three Protestants are brutally shaved and 
tied to a mammoth stake, the square filled with onlookers.  A bishop of 
the Roman Church presides at the spectacle, and his very words, directed 
to the victims of the impending auto-de-fe, show the terrible results of 
politics mixing with religion.
Princess Elizabeth appears first outdoors, dancing with her ladies in 
waiting.  But she soon suffers the wrath of her half sister, Mary Tudor, 
the ailing Queen.  Imprisoned and then released, Elizabeth is warned not 
to consort with anyone perceived as dangerous to the Crown.  Various 
factions form, a Catholic one led by the Duke of Norfolk (Christopher 
Eccleston), a Protestant one led by Sir William Cecil (Sir Richard 
Attenborough) and Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).  There are 
other players in the political intrigue, such as Mary of Guise (Fanny 
Ardant), and various ambassadors and underlings. After Elizabeth ascends 
the throne, she continues her affair of the heart with Sir Robert Dudley 
(Joseph Fiennes), but the reality of ruling sobers her attitude 
considerably.  The realm's coffers are depleted, its army and navy 
ineffectual.  France and Spain are enemies waiting for a chance to 
consume the entire island.  Does she have it in her to transform her 
callow and impish demeanor?  She is the daughter of Henry VIII, after 
all.
Already the recipient of a Best Actress Award from the Online Film 
Critics Society (OFCS), Cate Blanchett is riveting in the role of the 
Virgin Queen (the film's slightly sarcastic subtitle).  Blanchett's 
Elizabeth is vibrant and principled, spirited and sharp, beautiful and 
bitter.  In a very demanding role, Blanchett is able to assume an air of 
originality, a quiet determination to find or create the inspiration she 
will need to preserve the traditions and power of the monarchy.  Look 
for Blanchett's face on the big screen for years to come, and her name 
on many nomination lists.
Geoffrey Rush is just as strong.  As Francis Walsingham, a man returning 
to court after a period of exile, Rush depicts consummate dedication to 
Queen Elizabeth I.  Walsingham is charged with protecting the Queen, and 
he immerses himself in the arduous task of security.  There's a slight 
resemblance between Walsingham and Inspector Javert, whom Rush played in 
the recent remake of 'Les Miserables.'  Javert is nearly psychotic in 
his pursuit of the quasi-saint, Jean Valjean;  Walsingham's hunting of 
those disloyal to the Crown is almost as obsessive.  Much is implied by 
the script, perhaps a weak point:  perhaps we could have seen more of 
this early Renaissance knight commanding his forces.  We see him only 
once giving orders to a spy.  Still, Rush assists in a steady building 
of plot, until the film resonates with the overtones of power and 
ambition and love of country.
As Sir Robert Dudley, Joseph Fiennes gives a sturdy performance.  His 
part demands him to be first a sincere lover and later a treasonous 
outcast.  Fiennes plays the range well, except that at times he seems 
too arch, his chin beard and cocked brow the harbingers of cliché.  He 
is good here, but better as the Bard of Stratford in 'Shakespeare in 
Love', a fortuitous companion piece whose humor compliments the 
historical tone of 'Elizabeth'.
'Sumptuous' is an apt word for the costumes and cinematography.  They 
function in tandem to create a visual banquet of images.  The few 
peasants we see are appropriately scruffy.  More noticeably, the 
noblemen who are the focus of 'Elizabeth' are outfitted expertly.  The 
retinues of Queens Mary and Elizabeth are stunningly coordinated, and 
all the accoutrements worn by Blanchett are painstaking in their detail.  
My only criticism is the black leather look of the traitors, 
particularly the garb of the main villain, Norfolk.  But the look of the 
film is memorable, to say the least.  Like the momentum of the plot, the 
beauty of the photography causes the viewer a degree of awe;  toward the 
end there is a retrospective montage, almost a collage of greatest 
visual hits, that summarizes the rise and, more importantly, the growth 
of Elizabeth into a mature head of state.
Shekhar Kapur has accomplished a remarkable feat for a director with 
only a few films behind him.  The scenes are well shot, especially ones 
that exploit the mood of such a period piece - bishops held in a dingy 
cell, Walsingham looking down on them from a low-angle vantage.  And at 
the end, as Elizabeth assumes the aspect of born-again virgin, she 
becomes an icon of power and pallor, her servants applying the lead and 
arsenic to her skin.  As the undisputed ruler she crosses a roomful of 
admiring subjects, and for an instant she gets almost too close to the 
camera.  For an instant we are too close to this monarch.  Then we cut 
away to see the young but stern Elizabeth more distantly, and we glimpse 
the bright future of the British Empire.


Title
Review for Sands of Iwo Jima (1949)
SANDS OF IWO JIMA ranks as one of John Wayne's finest films, including 
his Westerns.  It's story follows a tough platoon commander and his men 
through some of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific theater, including 
Tarawa and Iwo Jima.
Wayne's performance is a classic.  I'm fairly sure it was my 10 year-old 
daughter's first exposure to Wayne, and I'm glad she saw him in a 
representative role.  When you first see Wayne, he should be doing his 
best tough-guy act, like he does with Sergeant John M. Stryker.  What a 
hard-as-nails name!  (Isn't there a professional wrestler named Sergeant 
Striker?)  To give a fictional character a middle initial is another nod 
to realism.  Anyway, your first time seeing "The Duke" should be when 
he's unsentimental, doing a difficult job and shunning credit, all the 
while using his one-of-a-kind talk and walk.  
Here his character was more challenging than many of his typical roles.  
Stryker is hard-nosed almost beyond tolerance, to the point that many of 
his men complain and begin the rumblings of mutiny.  But when we find 
out that Stryker's wife has left him and taken their child, and that the 
boy does not write to his father, we see some of the motivation behind 
his behaviors.  We understand better - though not completely - why he 
goes on drunken binges. Although the subplot concerning Stryker's 
personal life follows the formula of many war films, it certainly makes 
for good psychological study, and contributes a freshness to the film.  
Two of Stryker's men take his treatment personally.  As Corporal Thomas, 
Forrest Tucker hates Stryker's guts because Stryker beat him in a 
divisional boxing match some time earlier.  The old grudge surfaces 
until they are, once again, engaged in fisticuffs.  Only this time a 
colonel spots the sergeant beating up on his own man, and we watch one 
Marine show his loyalty to another Marine, when Thomas claims Stryker 
was only instructing him in combat judo.  In Thomas' confession to 
Stryker just after their make-up, we see the effects of a very sticky 
moral situation, a scene that would hold its own with any ethical 
dilemma I can think of in movies.  Pfc. Peter Conway's hatred of Stryker 
is more complicated.  He is a Harvard-educated businessman, an amateur 
soldier here to fight the war and then return home.  When Conrad marries 
and later receives a letter from his wife, telling of their newborn 
baby, we see Stryker's jealousy.  The only question at this point is how 
will Conway (played by John Agar) come to terms with his sergeant?
Real footage from Pacific campaigns is used convincingly in the film.  
When we see flame-throwing tanks igniting the battle-scarred hills of 
the islands, we form at least an idea of how devastating war can be.  
The smoothness of the film clips is pleasing too: the battlefields of 
the movie set match the real battlefields closely.  And the difference 
in film quality is not much.  Most remarkable is the planting of the 
flag atop Mount Suribachi.  Director Alan Dwan uses an almost corny 
method of drawing our attention to the scene immortalized in the Iwo 
Jima Memorial - Marines struggling to raise the Stars and Stripes.  But 
the effect caps the film nicely.
A recent trend in movie-making takes another look at standard genres and 
revises their supposed goals.  Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN showed us a 
Western whose hero was a gun-toting murderer.  Steven Spielberg made 
perhaps the finest war movie ever in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  My point is 
that RYAN has been advertised not as a war movie, but an "anti-war" 
movie.  Taking a look at John Wayne's efforts in SANDS OF IWO JIMA, I 
cannot see how he or the film praises war.  I cannot see, especially 
with the anti-climatic ending, how this narrative uses war for the 
mindless support of political causes.  
I would recommend anyone watch this John Wayne film.  And if you are 
watching with Wayne  first-timers, withhold your comments about this 
grand old actor, and let them form their own opinions.  The man is 
impressive enough to leave his mark on many generations.


Title
Review for Nobody's Fool (1994)
It's been five years since Robert Benton adapted Richard Russo's long novel 
Nobody's Fool and directed Paul Newman as its title character Donald 
Sullivan, the irascible Sully.  It's June of 1999 now and I just finished my 
yearly viewing of it, and the film plays just as good each time.  It's 
almost therapeutic for me to view it, to watch Russo's true American 
character, as much hero as sad sack, a man who's made scads of mistakes but 
has hit a streak of luck that makes us love him.
It's pure pleasure to watch Newman as Sully.  Throughout the performance he 
inhabits the role with a mix of weariness and comfort.  With his long 
experience, Newman has mastered what might be called under-acting, his 
manner natural, his voice gruff, his blue eyes gleaming with assurance.  A 
70 year-old playing a man 10 years younger, Newman gets Sully's limp 
perfect, and creates a very believable crust on the outside of a man who has 
begun to discover he can do this living the right way after all.
Upstate New York is the setting - the decaying town of Bath, closed 
factories overlooking the once prosperous streets.  Benton's camera touches 
upon the locales and characters that make up Sully's world.  There's the 
huge two-story house owned by Miss Beryl (Jessica Tandy in her last role, 
the film dedicated to her);  Sully rents the top floor from the old woman, 
who decades before taught him in the eighth grade.  There's Carl Roebuck 
(Bruce Willis), owner of the Tiptop Construction Company.  Sully's in the 
midst of a lawsuit against Roebuck after a fall from a scaffold wrecked 
Sully's knee.  (Yet the two still interact, Sully throwing caustic humor 
Carl's way, Carl throwing piecemeal work Sully's.)  Carl's wife Toby 
(Melanie Griffith) is another of Sully's pals, the victim of her husband's 
countless affairs, a beautiful woman with a crush on Sully, who is old 
enough at least to be her dad.  As Sully's sidekick, Rub Squeers (Pruitt 
Taylor Vince) is a poor man suffering from ingrown dreams ("You know what I 
wisht, Sully?" is Rub's slogan;  Russo has Rub saying it hundreds of times 
in the book).  Sully's ineffectual lawyer is Wirf (Gene Saks), a one-legged 
crony who can be counted on to play cards and drink in the chair to Sully's 
right.
Even though the action doesn't leave Bath, the plot is picaresque, following 
Sully's adventures as he lives a few weeks in a snowy winter.  It's worth 
mentioning that Sully's son Peter (Dylan Walsh) calls Rub "Sancho," 
reminiscent of Sancho Panza, the chum of the aging but noble Don Quixote!  
Accordingly, Sully rescues Miss Beryl after she has a mini-stroke; Hatty - 
the senile mother of the woman who runs the diner Sully frequents, after she 
wanders out in the snowy streets, intending to walk to Albany; grandson Will 
(Alexander Goodwin) after he gets in a painful fight with little brother 
Whacker (Carl J. Matusovich).  Sully also offers comforting words to Toby, 
boosts Rub's confidence, and even counsels his son after Peter and his wife 
separate.  Time after time Sully plays the under-rated hero.
A hilarious subplot involves Sully's determination to get what's coming to 
him, compensation for his knee injury.  Hence Sully steals Carl Roebuck's 
new snowblower, uses it on Miss Beryl's sidewalk, and loses it when Carl 
takes it back.  In a humorously tense scene, Sully enlists Peter's help to 
pinch the machine again, this time from the fenced, Doberman-guarded yard of 
Tiptop.  Another story has Sully dealing with an overzealous police officer. 
  This subplot is set up when Sully is stopped for a broken tail-light, 
Officer Raymer (Philip Seymour Hoffman) cutting off Sully's truck with his 
cruiser.  It is brought to a climax typical of dark humor, when Sully drives 
his pick-up along the sidewalk in an attempt to win the attention and 
forgiveness of Rub.  Raymer once again cuts off the F-150, and when Sully 
keeps coming, the inept cop fires a warning shot, inviting Sully's knockout 
punch to the nose.  The climax of the film actually unwinds around Sully's 
short jail term for this assault, as Sully and the town discover just how 
much the old ne'er-do-well is worth to their lives.
So Sully's personality has many sides, most of them contradictory.  "If you 
can be a grandfather to him (Will), why can't you be a father to me?" is 
what Peter intones resentfully, supplying one of the few predictable parts 
of the plot, weak because of its repetition.  A touching part of the story 
comes when we learn that Sully's father was a hopeless alcoholic, a man who 
knocked his wife across the room and pounded his son Donald when he stood up 
once for his mother.  The empty Sullivan house stands as a bleak reminder of 
Sully's grudge against his long-dead father;  all these years Sully has 
refused to refurbish or even to pay taxes on the property, haunted as it is 
with memories of dysfunction.
Robert Benton picks and chooses parts of Benton's novel carefully.  He has 
included the elements needed, of course, to ensure a rather smooth and 
comprehensible plot.  A film is no novel, though, and Benton knows better 
than to include too much detail from Russo's Dickensian storyline.  Hence we 
never meet Rub's wife, who in the book steals daily from her job at the 
five-and-dime; we never see the darker, adulterous side of Peter, in his 
affair with a girl from West Virginia (where he has been laid off from a 
teaching job at the university), and later with a revenge-seeking Toby.  But 
the story flows well - certainly more character- than plot-driven.  In all 
the film has an admirable lack of sentimentality, even though it uses 
moments both bitter and sweet to evoke responses in the viewer.
The casting is masterful.  I've written enough about Newman already.  The 
rest of the cast is also flawless.  The way in which Rub acts the born 
loser, his eyes darting around as Peter takes the jelly donut off his plate 
and gives it to the boy Will;  the way Wirf and the police chief sit 
nonchalantly around the table as the group plays strip poker, Carl and his 
latest bimbo buck naked - these veteran actors all seem to portray character 
parts with expertise and relish.
Though at times the pace of the film is slow, the story builds a momentum as 
its threads are brought together.  The character of Donald Sullivan is not 
new to American literature.  In recent years John Updike mined the same 
material in four books, his man Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom, an adolescent 
sports hero, irresponsibly deserting his young family and seeing the 
consequences years later.  In Nobody's Fool, there is something about the 
way Russo and Benton have drawn Sully that makes the viewer feel sympathy.  
We want the guy to succeed, and I would submit that we enjoy watching the 
gritty and frustrating and absolutely charming rogue over and over for years 
to come.


Title
Review for Mummy, The (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Sociey at http://www.ofcs.org
This is not your grandfather's "The Mummy."
Not to be misunderstood, Boris Karloff as the ancient priest Imhotep was 
quite menacing - face crinkled in leathery evil, stare capable of sending 
chills clear from the early 1930's.
But this is the turn of another century, and modern audiences would yawn at 
all but two minutes of the original "Mummy."  The new incarnation is a 
supercharged 127 -minute melee, most of it successful in mixing a decent 
plot with flatly amazing special effects.  The best element, though, is the 
fun.
You want to hear about the monster, don't you?  It's a hybrid of booger-men 
from various mythologies:  it's a good thing, I think, that there's 
originality here.  The producers would not have won had they gone with a 
Karloff-esque copy.  Anyhow, this Imhotep is a viscid corpse, suddenly 
animated through the most unfortunate of coincidences.  It's a manifestation 
out of Anne Rice, not only stable but agile, nimble despite parts of its 
anatomy skeletal or missing.  Its heritage is traceable to the vampire, as 
it somehow drains the vital liquids from its victims, enabling itself to 
regenerate.  Once it is whole (and the men who opened the forbidden book are 
grotesque husks), Imhotep is supposedly invincible, inflicting upon the 
modern world (the mid-1920's) the plagues of ancient Egypt.
The forces charged with stopping him include the mercenary Rick O'Connell 
(Brendan Frasur), who a few years previously was accosted by the evil forces 
lurking about Imhotep's desert tomb.  His help is enlisted by the pretty 
English Egyptologist Evie (Rachel Weisz), and her sometimes sober brother 
Jonathan (John Hannah).  Their caravan just happens to converge with another 
Egyptologist (the wonderful Jonathan Hyde) leading a band of greedy cowboys. 
  Their guide is the despicable Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor) who, along with 
O'Connor, happens to know the location of the legendary City of the Dead.    
After these expeditions simultaneously uncover different parts of the 
pernicious burial chambers, the mummy is awakened, members of the parties 
are hunted like bugs - and at times by bugs - and the "beginning of the end" 
commences, the horizon blackened by locusts and other harbingers of doom.
Possibly the most watchable moments involve close combat between the heroes 
and legions of re-animated mummies, the bodyguards of the condemned assassin 
Imhotep.  These shuddering soldiers appear as rapidly as the bony marauders 
from "Jason and the Argonauts," attacking O'Connell and losing their heads 
to his swift broadsword.  It's over-the-top and delicious footage, causing 
more chuckling than gasping.  We're also treated to the super-hero-like 
antics of fleet, shield- and spear-wielding mummies.  At once scary, gross 
and humorous, these scenes are a typical use of state-of-the-art technology. 
  They're cool, and they do the job of helping to tell an incredible story.
There are other complications of plot, of course.  A secret society, 
descendants of the guardians of the murdered pharaoh, is endeavoring to 
scare away the tomb raiders.  Before the mummy and his bedraggled ghouls, 
these black-clad preservers of order serve as the main baddies;  their role 
changes soon, as their tattooed leader sports a heavy machine gun to fight 
on O'Connell's side.  Legions of supernatural scarabs, by the way, 
contribute mayhem whenever they can, skittering around and de-fleshing 
whatever's in their way.
The imagery in the film is also cool.  Early on, O'Connell is cornered by 
enemy soldiers on horseback.  Suddenly the attackers retreat, and the sands 
around O'Connell stir violently, leaving the impression of a horrible face, 
mouth gaping in agony.  Later we see the face in the awesome wall of a 
sandstorm, as well as on the slack-jawed mummy himself.
Brendan Frasur is passable as an action hero.  Of course the premise is very 
different here than in "George of the Jungle."  What's in large part 
responsible for Frasur's success is the surplus of action scenes.  The guy 
is still very muscular from the George role, and seems practiced in running 
and handling firearms, many times blasting pistols in both hands.  At a 
couple of points Frasur is even allowed to deliver self-reflexive humor, 
commenting, "That happens a lot around here," when a sudden breeze 
foreshadows the presence of evil.  Frasur does not have the comic timing of 
Harrison Ford, and does not convince us in O'Connell's stubborn refusal to 
deliver more than his mercenary services are paid for.
The brother and sister team gets the job done.  John Hannah plays a good 
drunk, his Jonathan a wily rascal who seems cowardly but is ultimately 
dependable.  Rachel Weisz as Evelyn is good-looking in an unusual way, and 
gains our sympathy especially after the reanimated priest kidnaps her in 
order to raise from the dead his love from long ago.
Character roles are well-cast.  Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni is terrifically 
snake-like, betraying his friends at the least monetary provocation, and 
even working for the mummy, which holds out gold jewelry in the exposed 
cartilage of its hand.  The venerable Bernard Cox, veteran of countless film 
and television forays, plays a Royal Air Force officer looking for the 
danger he never quite found in war.  Arnold Vosloo, the South African actor 
who portrays Imhotep, is appropriately menacing, the ethnicity of his visage 
indistinguishable, like Anthony Quinn's.
One reason I hope the film engenders sequels is that the ones that followed 
the original "The Mummy" were so full of campy fun.  I'll be honest:  I 
wouldn't want to watch films like this every week, but on a spring evening, 
after a long day's work in the office or in the sun, there's nothing like 
the formulaic spectacle of a sharp "B" film.
"The Mummy" is rated PG-13 for excessive violence and partial nudity.  It's 
the stuff of nightmares for any viewers with vivid imaginations, a likable 
throwback in a genre I'm glad has been brought back to life!


Title
Review for Mummy, The (1932)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://ofcs.org
Karl Freund's The Mummy is part of the triad of great horror classics 
of the early 1930's.  Along with Frankenstein and Dracula, The Mummy 
terrified early generations of movie-goers, and parts of it are still 
terrifying today.
A measure of the film's importance comes from its originality.  
Screenwriters of this time were not pestered with avoiding so many 
clichés;  so when The Mummy begins at the site of a spooky 
archaeological dig in Egypt, viewers saw an early treatment of 
discoveries that had been in the news for decades.  It had to be 
dramatic and scary to watch the mummified guardian Imhotep (Boris 
Karloff) commence to stir, break his arms free of their bonds, and 
send into madness one of the archaeologists who had invaded his tomb.
Years pass, and the plot alights on the life of another member of the 
ill-fated expedition, Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron).  His friend 
Dr. Muller is concerned that a young woman, Helen Grosvenor (Zita 
Johann), is in danger of being controlled by a tall, thin, mysterious 
Egyptian, who gives the name Ardeth Bey (Karloff).  While Helen is in 
a disturbed state, Frank Whemple is charged with calming her.  Quickly 
the two fall in love.  Heightening the tension,  Bey begins to pursue 
Helen, as he is convinced her body holds the reincarnated soul of the 
Egyptian princess Anckesen-Amon.  In an agitated fit of telepathic 
rage, Bey kills Dr. Muller.  Meanwhile, the Whemples are on to Bey, 
realizing he is Imhotep.  What's more horrific is their realization 
that Bey is invincible - he cannot be defeated without the 
intervention of the ancient Egyptian gods, the same gods that Imhotep 
offended so many years before.
The ending of The Mummy is also the forerunner of countless showdowns 
between mortals and immortals.  For its time the special effects are 
stunning, their power vitiated only by an abrupt cut to the ending 
credits.
Boris Karloff gets top billing, and rightly so.  His body is excellent 
in its attenuation, his square shoulders giving his character a 
striking ascetic quality.  Somehow we almost believe this man is a 
living mummy, his face crinkled by the ages.  Certainly one of the 
creepiest shots in the film is a close-up used many times:  the 
fez-wearing Imhotep/Bey glaring wide-eyed to a point just above the 
camera, in what seems like a still photograph.  No music accompanies 
this shot;  it is the character's intense concentration -- and the 
viewer's knowledge of his evil intentions - that lend the image its 
terrifying power.  Further, Karloff's subtle and masterful body 
language conveys a manner that takes its time in building menace.  The 
actor's demeanor was doubtless as singular at the time as it is nearly 
70 years later:  as we listen to his distinguished British lisp, we 
shiver in mute understanding.
An important issue is raised in the film - the idea that it is wrong 
for Egyptian artifacts to leave the country of their origin and appear 
in, say, an English museum.  At the time of the film's setting, the 
laws have been changed and all artifacts remain in the Cairo museum.  
The filmmakers are to be praised for nodding to this correct method of 
showcasing history.
Much of the film is slow, particularly when Karloff is offscreen.  
When his Bey is luring Helen to his side, or disabling her guardians 
with his lethal mind powers, the tension makes the film very 
watchable.  But the dialogue sags when the men are talking, or even 
when Frank is romancing Helen.  One scene, in which Bey explains to 
the semi-hypnotized Helen the reason for his cursed state, is 
riveting.  A flashback beginning in a pool of fog, the scene shows 
Imhotep, in love with the dead princess, trying to revive her body.  
Caught in his unholy deed, Imhotep is wrapped alive, and placed as a 
guard to the royal tomb.  Many modern viewers would deem the flashback 
tacky, but it is a risk in narration for which the director should be 
commended.  And the period costumes worn by the ancient Egyptians do 
lend a corny realism.  We feel Imhotep's pain, especially the spasms 
in the eyes of the expressive Mr. Karloff as the bandages are wrapped 
about his head.
The sequels to this film are easier to watch.  Though they are more 
Americanized, with the swaddled creature traipsing around, dragging 
his dusty leg, one arm still trapped in its rotting sling, sometimes 
an unconscious beauty in his arm, these follow-up films helped to set 
the patterns used in many "B" horror movies to come.  But the simply 
titled The Mummy was the first, and no matter how many times its 
themes are remade and re-invoked, its ground-breaking status is beyond 
question.


Title
Review for Planet of the Apes (2001)
The ending of Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES is one that I like. Because I
enjoy pondering the details of almost any film I've seen, this original
divergence from Pierre Boulle's novel  as well as from the 1968 Charlton Heston
vehicle  is fascinating, if rather unpopular among many American viewers.
Although the quality of Tim Burton's films is uneven, each one of his works is
an event. Craftsmanship and vision showing in each one, Burton's movies are
steadily building him the reputation of an American master. In his dark
imaginings Burton reminds me of the writer T. C. Boyle, who began publishing his
stories and in little magazines and then progressed to putting out novels with
major publishers. Likewise, Burton paid his dues early in his career, and has
been fortunate enough to be able to impose brilliant originality on his films 
even though the movie machines of Hollywood expect many dollars in return. Don't
know about you, but I'll admit to a willingness to see a film just because
Burton's name is the last one in the opening credits.
What's cool about PLANET? Perhaps the setting is not as visually stunning as in
BATMAN, but it is just as dark. In fact, most of the piece has received the
criticism of being rather lightless. The symbolism works well, though: the dark
heart of man has engineered this chaotic hell, and man is suffering the just
deserts. The simian beings that rule the planet  and there many races of apes,
as well as many forms of racism  occupy quarters that appear comfortable.
Structures sit among huge trees and hills that must be difficult to navigate for
mere humans. No doubt the set's magic is aided through painted backdrops and
canvases sketched upon the computer.
The film really does move. Not many subplots divert our attention. When Leo
Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), in an attempt to rescue a space pod piloted by a
chimp, flies into an electromagnetic storm, he is flung far into the future.
Crashing through the forest of this seemingly alien planet, he sinks in a murky
pool, reminiscent of the creepy swamp where Luke Skywalker is mentored by Yoda.
But Davidson has no familiar faces around. The humans he spies seem somehow
subhuman. After the apes round them up, the stage is set for an escape
engineered by Davidson, the American Air Force officer who is not willing to
accept this world turned on its ear. The escape attempt takes up much of the
running time, with the band of humans accepting aid from a female ape named Ari
(Helena Bonham Carter) and exploring the forbidden desert where, according to
mythology, the ape civilization began.
Apes caging humans? The irony is delicious, and the moral is as clear as it was
in the 1968 version. How should we treat animals? What role will evolution play
in the future? When will the world finally be free of slavery? Gladly, Burton's
version presents these questions while refraining from clearly answering them.
Unfortunately, the film's agenda also includes an oblique attack upon
Christianity, specifically, the idea that a being will return to spread
salvation upon his people. It certainly seems as though this founding father is
imbued with more superhuman traits than a mere Arthurian figure.
As Davidson, Mark Wahlberg is competent but not outstanding. His goal is to get
himself off the planet, and we like him only mildly because his character is
developed too quickly. His decision to steal a pod and try to rescue the chimp
has consequences that reverberate throughout universal history: here's what
would really happen if Star Trek's Prime Directive were breached! Wahlberg is a
decent action hero, though the script perhaps could have given him more
personality.
Carter is very good as the sympathetic ape Ari. She is actually a human rights
activist who is not human! Rick Baker's makeup people have given her comparably
little facial hair, so it is easier for us to accept a slight romantic interest
between her and Davidson. Bonham Carter's performance proves again that a good
actor can shine through the heaviest disguise.
The strongest acting is turned in by the baddie. If I might continue the
comparison to STAR WARS, what Darth Vader is to Luke, General Thade (Tim Roth)
is to Davidson. The perfect rival and foil  a simian Machiavelli. Roth must
relish the role of a "heavy," as he grows delirious with all-too-human hatred
and vengeance in PLANET. Along with Gary Oldman, Tim Roth is setting the
standards for villains in the modern cinema.
Paul Giamatti is buried under the guise of a slave-trading orangutan, but his
performance is solid. He's very funny; part of the irony here is the
personification that shines through this supposedly non-person. What a strong
character actor Giamatti is.
Estella Warren as Daena, the comely human woman who is part of the escaping
band, is underused. In this area the script is unsure what to do. Should
Davidson grow more attached to Daena or to Ari? We can't decide either. Michael
Clarke Duncan is barely recognizable as General Thane's protégé, General Attar.
This mammoth actor again turns in a rather quiet but solid job, though Attar's
character seems occasionally conflicted. Finally, Kris Kristofferson is vastly
underused. His craggy face just begins to add a rounder dimension to the plight
of the humans on this terrifying planet, when he is plucked from the story.
In a wise and witty appearance, Charlton Heston wears the ape latex in this
revisiting. He's Thade's father, whose dying words reveal some of the mysterious
history behind the race reversal. Look for some clever references in this
sequence.
In a season that is rather bare of well-made films, PLANET OF THE APES is
competent if not spectacular. It's full of action and engaging special effects,
and the appearance of the apes is, probably for the first time, believable,
thanks to Mr. Baker and his crew. What makes the film better than average is the
risks taken by Burton, especially with that heady ending.

Title
Review for Insider, The (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
"What was broken up here doesn't get put back together again."
This is Al Pacino speaking as "60 Minutes" segment producer Lowell Bergman 
in Michael Mann's new "The Insider."  What he's talking about is the serious 
consequences that go down when politics and greed assault integrity.  What 
we see is a well-paced portrait of investigative journalists, and of the 
effects of decisions:  some of them easy and some of them wrenching.
The content here doesn't fit the mold of the American suspense movie.  There 
are no serial killers or occult goings-on.  There are not even any car 
chases.  But in a similar way that "All the President's Men" functioned as 
an expose of Washington politics surrounding the 1972 election, "The 
Insider" functions as an eye-opener to mid-1990's capitalistic depravity.  
Mann has chosen much different fare here than he covered in his superior 
period drama "The Last of the Mohicans";  his success, though, is every bit 
as certain.
Lowell Bergman is a top-of-the-line producer.  The film's opening sequences 
take place in a country very much like Iran, where Bergman and a crew member 
are blindfolded and driven to meet with a Hezbollah leader.  Will the sheik 
trust the reputation of "60 Minutes" and, specifically, of its 78 year-old 
icon, Mike Wallace?  Yes.  We watch as the interview is staged a couple of 
days later, and Wallace gets in the face of a ranting disciple of the 
sheik's.  Wallace's first question is "Are you a terrorist?  No beating 
around the bush with Wallace, of course, and Bergman is one of the main 
preservers of this dogged honesty.
Enter Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, a scientist formerly employed by health companies 
like Johnson and Johnson, but who until recently made a lot of money by 
selling his services to a major tobacco company.  It seems Wigand has been 
terminated rather suddenly.  That he doesn't tell his wife immediately about 
losing his job displays his emotional unevenness, a behavioral pattern that 
surfaces several times.   Wigand's wife seems most concerned with losing the 
money for the house payments and the for health benefits that assist with 
their elder daughter's asthma.
So how does Wigand meet up with Bergman?  As a corporate executive and 
respected scientist, Wigand is called upon to interpret some dirt about the 
Phillip Morris Company that someone dropped in Bergman's lap.  Although this 
piece work does not surface again, we are introduced to some real dirt, a 
crisis of Wigand's conscience that affects all of American public health.  
Simply said, Wigand cannot make up his mind to reveal or keep confidential 
the fact that cigarettes are a delivery device for nicotine.  Worse, tobacco 
companies are enhancing the power of the nicotine by adding chemicals that 
enable the addictive substance to pass more easily from the lungs to the 
brain.  Wigand's big problem is that part of his severance package is 
signing an addendum to his confidentiality agreement.  Because of this, he 
cannot communicate any information about his research, as this research is 
owned by the company.
Circumstances happen that push Wigand to fess up.  It seems he is being 
followed and even harrassed at his home - at the modest rancher he and his 
wife and young daughters occupied after moving out of their mansion.  
Bergman gets Wigand a role in a lawsuit being brought by the state of 
Mississippi again the tobacco industry;  the reasoning is that a deposition 
under oath will make the information public record and let Wigand sidestep 
his confidentiality pact.  The complications surrounding this dilemma are 
what Mann concerns himself with exploring.
>From the start we sense an edgy tone, the camera catching odd venues, the 
shot slowing down while the score goes to discordant jazz.  Mann has a knack 
akin to a good fiction writer's for keeping a narrative engaging, almost 
jumpy.  Again, considering the premise for the film does not carry with it 
the possibility for much physical action, Mann does an amazing job with 
editing and pacing.  The result is a story with several dimensions.  There's 
the story of Wigand's degeneration, tracing his separation from his family 
and his struggle to start a new career as a teacher of high school chemistry 
and Japanese.  Will he defy a Kentucky court order and offer his damning 
deposition?  What's equally riveting is the conflict among the makers of "60 
Minutes," the legal arm of CBS, and various other media - such as the "New 
York Times" - about whether Wigand's words and face should be aired.
As Jeffrey Wigand, Russell Crowe is masterful.  He carries about him a hint 
of quiet impotence, a rage against all the players of the game, Big Tobacco, 
the FBI, "60 Minutes" and Lowell Bergman himself.  Apparently Crow gained 
some weight for the role, and the result is a meaty middle-aged man who 
wants desperately to be a good father and husband, a man of science who let 
himself be drawn just a little too deeply into the financial and moral 
morass stirred up by the marketing culture of cigarette peddlers.  For 
Crowe, look for a nomination for best actor in a supporting role.
As Mike Wallace, Christopher Plummer is perfect.  His is an American accent 
and an American aggressiveness.  Smart and compassionate, he is nevertheless 
ruthless when it comes to getting a story.  In every scene he's in, Plummer 
shows his experience and wisdom about the subtlest of actions.
Viewers should make no mistake:  this is Al Pacino's movie.  It opens and 
closes with him in our sights, and enables him to display his intense 
talents in almost every scene.  The best part of his performance has him 
depicting moral ambivalence.  He takes it personally when he's accused of 
betraying sources, and does all he can to expose the tactics taken by the 
tobacco company to smear Dr. Wigand.  Surprisingly, he's not even about to 
kowtow to the great and powerful Wallace.  In role after role, Pacino takes 
his task seriously; here he helps to bring out the dramatic aspects in this 
important, factual narrative.
One weakness lies in the story's failure to put faces behind the people 
harassing Wigand.  We see a muscular man in a business suit, hitting golf 
balls and pausing to watch the scientist.  And there are the boot prints in 
the tomato patch that was worked by Wigand and his girls.  Okay, we know 
it's important to include the threats Wigand experienced, but the most 
compelling ones come from identifiable perpetrators.  Further, what is this 
habit of Wigand's of talking with Bergman over a pay phone in the crowded 
halls of the high school in which he is trying to establish himself as a 
teacher?
"The Insider" will probably bring in a decent box office, but not an 
outstanding one.  The reason?  It's a thinking-person's movie, a 
behind-the-scenes look at a call for social reform, a story too true to be 
sensational.  It's also a darn good effort by a veteran of both television 
and film.  Its acting is solid, its plot engaging.  I'd recommend it for 
anyone 14 and up; the only reason for the R rating is too many appearances 
of a single, vulgar adjective.


Title
Review for Stuart Little (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Here's how E,B. White's sharply written yet slightly surreal "Stuart Little" 
starts:  "When Mrs. Frederick C. Little's second son arrived, everybody 
noticed that he was not much bigger than a mouse."
Director Rob Minkoff's film of the same name preserves the premise of a 
mouse being raised as part of a human family (though the movie Littles get 
their Stuart from an orphanage).  This premise, by the way, is virtually the 
only aspect of the novel that viewers will spot.  We are treated to assorted 
amusing adventures starring a very likable and cute computer-made mouse, but 
it is not E.B. White's story.
The Whites (Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie) bring home the striking addition to 
their family, only to discover that their real son George (Jonathan 
Lipnicki) rejects Stuart as his brother.  To make the mouse's new situation 
worse, the family cat Snowbell (voice of Nathan Lane) would relish killing 
him;  Snowbell is especially put off by the idea that he is the pet of a 
mouse who has become a member of the family.  Of course the humans have no 
clue about the conflict involving their jealous cat - and the unsavory cats 
that Snowbell involves himself with.  Mr. and Mrs. Little are caught up in 
Stuart's failure to adjust to their home life.  That is, until Stuart 
commences to encourage George to finish building a model boat, and to enter 
the boat in the Central Park race.
Bearing probably the closest resemblance to White's plot, the boat race 
scene sports some of the best action in the picture.  When the remote 
control for George's boat is broken, Stuart appoints himself pilot of the 
"Wasp," and goes against the boats controlled by several other little boys, 
particularly a dirty-playing snob who rams his "Lillian B. Womrath" against 
the boats of unsuspecting competitors.  This is the scene that brings Stuart 
and George into the bonds of brotherhood.
The main conflict reverts to the cat.  He enlists the help of the 
freeloading Monty, who in turn enlists a wicked city cat named Smoky (voice 
of Chazz Palminteri). Their object?  To "scratch out" Stuart.  The action 
engendered by this subplot occupies most of the second half of the film, and 
succeeds largely because of the mix of likable characters and top-notch 
computer animation.
One thing that does appear is White's sudden, lovable absurdity.  We accept 
that this mouse can carry on a cultured conversation, just as we accept that 
humans suspend their disbelief whenever they are around Stuart.  The film 
moves at a rapid clip, in the same way that E. B. White's prose style skips 
along fluently, albeit a bit absent-mindedly.
I say "absent-mindedly" because White's "Little" cannot hold a candle to his 
"Charlotte's Web"; both books are full of whimsy and character - which one 
can't say about most children's movies - but "Web" has a much more linear 
(and recognizable) plot.  So screenwriters Greg Brooker and M. Night 
Shyamalan had precious little to go on as they set out to convert this 
beloved, quirky story into what they hope is a popular money-making film.  
What they left out includes a major narrative catalyst:  the bird Margalo, 
who is saved by Stuart and who in turn saves Stuart, is gone from the story. 
  Instead Stuart spends more time with the family, mostly with "brother" 
George, and with the cats that are trying to tear him apart.
Oddly, the film succeeds despite its mixing of old and new plotting.  A lot 
of White's charm is still there, with the slight flavor of 1945 New York, 
the setting for the original.  This is not a literal 1940's background, but 
a mythical one, represented by Mr. White's tweed clothing, by the Little's 
tiny gingerbread house dwarfed by skyscrapers, and by the scent of gentility 
and manners that tints the characters' interaction.  The film is set in the 
present but not really.  And the elements added by Brooker and Shyamalan, 
along with director Minkoff (one half of the directorial team that crafted 
Disney's "The Lion King") serve as nifty twists and engaging - though 
frequently sentimental - spin.
As the voice of the mouse, Michael J. Fox gives a winning edge of character. 
  Stories about the making of the film tell how difficult it was to imbue 
Stuart with emotions - considering that mice do not have pupils!  Well, Fox 
lends wonderful inflection, while the computer animators construct amazing 
subtlety in all of the mouse's doings.  His facial muscles shape his eyes 
and smile with amazing emotive traits, while a computerized "skeleton" 
conveys life-like movements.
Jonathan Lipnicki is fine as the boy George.  He fulfills his role 
convincingly, though he occasionally seems to be waiting for cues.  As his 
mother, Geena Davis creates a typically protective mom, her face drawing 
tight into smiles or collapsing into tears at command.  Davis still has her 
off-center beauty, though it is tempered here by a modest hairstyle.  In 
many ways, Hugh Laurie resembles the father of "Dennis the Menace," both in 
his prim garb and in the rascally charges for whom he must provide a 
fatherly example.  Laurie again proves himself a dependable character actor.
Other voices include Chazz Palminteri as Smoky, the cat that commands a 
feline underground.  Bruno Kirby's mild raspiness flows smoothly from the 
lips of Mr. Stout, Stuart's fake father-mouse, while Jennifer Tilly does 
wonders for the big-hearted mouse floozy posing as Stuart's mother.  Nathan 
Lane loads any role with character, and his Snowbell brims with conflicted 
compassion.  Further, a band of familiar character actors playing Little 
relatives give the background a plush lining.
Bringing "Stuart Little" to the screen was a bold move, and the special 
effects are much of what make the film so watchable.  Who would not smile to 
see Stuart's broad smile?  It's like seeing a padded version of Garth 
Williams' masterly illustrations.  My eleven year-old read the book 
recently, and encouraged me to reread it:  this is another plus, by the way, 
of Hollywood adaptations of classic books - it gives them renewed life.  Who 
would enjoy this film?  Kids, first of all.  Then anyone else who enjoys 
classic conflicts and the latest in computer animation, down to amazing 
shadows, reflections and indentations caused by weight.  But if you are out 
for a strict interpretation of E. B. White, this film may not leave you 
pleased.


Title
Review for Small Soldiers (1998)
At the cineplex on Sunday, the sexes were segregated.
My wife took our ten year-old daughter to see MADELINE, while I 
accompanied our 13 year-old son into the theater showing SMALL SOLDIERS.  
The separation was as predictable as Happy Meals:  who would want the 
mini-Barbie, and who got the slick Hot Wheels?
The film does have parts interesting to boys and girls alike.  The early 
teen Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) develops a fast infatuation with 
Christy Fimple, the girl next door who happens to be dating another, 
older boy with a motorcycle.  The boy-meets-and-then-rescues-girl 
scenario is one of the more engaging subplots in the film.  Dunst 
delivers a smooth performance, whether she is watching her little 
brother or fighting off her own "Gwendy" dolls, which have been 
transmogrified into half-melted, hair-raising drones.  Smith is also 
very likable in his role, especially when he is careful not to overact 
when an action figure he's brought home begins impossibly to interact 
with him.  Characterization is the aspect in which Alan Abernathy falls 
short.  The writers decided to add to his character a dimension that 
does not work.  Alan has a questionable history;  he's been expelled 
from two schools and his parents apparently have moved here to escape 
the ignominy.  But we see no motivation for the boy's past behavior;  we 
never understand what has caused his mischievous history, so the honor 
and bravery he ultimately shows never change the viewer's mind about 
Alan.  We always like him.
My son had the most fun watching the "Elite Commandos," the grotesquely 
grinning grunts hopped up on Defense Department microchips, the gimmicky 
toys that Dreamworks SKG hopes will sell well in stores and fast-food 
joints.  In the film the figures come alive at their owner's voice. We 
first meet the intelligent toys when Alan cons his friendly delivery man 
to leave a complete set (six Commandos, six "Gorgonites") at his absent 
father's toy store.  Not until he brings home Archer does he realize 
that, when you play with these toys, they play back.  Soon the Gorgonite 
leader Archer, speaking in Frank Langella's deep and gentle voice, shows 
us that these monsters have been cast against type.  They may be 
hideous, but they are also goofy and lovable, rascally and noble.  And 
they are the targets of the programmed wrath of the soldiers.
Chip Hazard (voice of Tommy Lee Jones) leads with an amoral abandon I 
have not seen since Robert Duvall's army officer in APOCALYPSE NOW.  
What is interesting in the depiction of these G. I. Joes for the new 
century is their dual nature.  They seem like cool, all-time exciting 
toys, while they also subtly attack the sensibilities of violence.  If 
the movie makes any political statement, it is that our culture demands 
entertainment (including toys and movies) that glorifies violence, while 
we simultaneously admire justice and gentleness.  But I give too much 
credit.  The special effects are seamless, as good as those in TOY STORY 
because of the added facet of live action.  They work because they bring 
off the wonderful exaggeration of the plot:  playthings turned bad, 
searching Dad's workbench for weapons, adapting Black and Decker and 
Craftsman into war machines.  The voices under Lee's command are 
masterful, albeit part of an inside joke.  Ernest Borgnine, Jim Brown, 
Clint Walker, George Kennedy - fragments of "The Dirty Dozen"!  If only 
we got to hear them more!
As Gil Mars, owner of Globotech, Denis Leary is cold but not sinister 
enough.  His company has gobbled up Heartland Toys and caused the 
creation of the Commandos and Gorgonites, along with the conflicts that 
will no doubt affect the humans around them.  What Mr. Mars teaches 
young viewers is that, if you cut a big enough check, you can appease 
the anger even of decent people, including Alan's father.  Director Joe 
Dante should have instructed Leary to act more menacing and less 
indifferent.  Or cast one of the original "Dozen" in person to show us 
how badness is done.  Perhaps Borgnine could have reprised his role in 
FROM HERE TO ETERNITY.
When Joe Dante worked on GREMLINS in the early 80's, he oversaw one of 
the early films rated PG-13.  I can recall seeing a need for the rating 
when I noticed too many small children in the theater.  They loved the 
violence, the frenetic action and irreverent potty jokes.  It was easy 
to notice the way the movie, before our very eyes, desensitized the 
children to these examples of crudeness.  It was probably then that my 
wife and I recognized the rating system meant what it said about age.  
The darkness of many scenes in SMALL SOLDIERS, paired with the violence 
and a few obscene phrases, makes the film unsuitable for a ten year-old, 
male or female.  Unfortunately, it is easier to shush loud movie-goers 
than it is to scold parents who have dragged their twin four year-olds 
to a PG-13.


Title
Review for Lost in Space (1998)
Ever since my wife bought me a toy "B-9" Robot for our anniversary, I 
had wanted to see the newest incarnation of "Lost in Space."
Aside from the characters, it's not much like the campy 60's series. (Of 
course, I didn't exactly recognize the campiness at the time; I was too 
busy hiding my eyes during the alien scenes. "Lost in Space" was the 
only TV show scarier than the monster scenes in "Voyage to the Bottom of 
the Sea"!) 
Following the premise of the series occupied much of the running time. 
But it's a good premise: the Robinson family's animation is suspended 
while the Jupiter 2 cruises to a planet ten years away. Their journey is 
interrupted by a 90's version of B-9 -- only slicker, butch; but the 
booming voice is the same. Anyway, the adventures the family encounters 
after they are lost are worth watching: mostly smooth computer-generated 
critters, and a version of the vile Doctor Smith that made me and my 12 
year-old son shiver. (No, I'm still not de-sensitized to the horror that 
monsters are supposed to instill!)
Though I like William Hurt immensely (no one could have played the 
reluctant travel writer in "The Accidental Tourist" better), he is 
miscast as John Robinson. OK -- the head of the family is a heady 
scientist, but Hurt I can't see as action hero. The rest of the cast is 
solid -- the ubiquitous Gary Oldman (is he British, or what?) is 
eminently dislikable -- though not nearly as goofy as his television 
counterpart. 
Get ready for another franchise. "Lost in Space" is entertaining. I'd 
pay to see a sequel, especially with the chance it might have just a 
shade more camp and self-reflexive humor.


Title
Review for Dinosaur (2000)
I read a review of the latest Disney animated film DINOSAUR in which the 
writer stated the faces of the animals were amazingly expressive without 
seeming human.
The whole conceit of almost any animated fare starring animals is that they 
must be humanized.  Personification is the name of the game.  In this film 
we do see compelling animation, the sad and happy expressions of the lemurs 
who adopt a baby herbivore (Aladar, voiced by D. B. Sweeney), and even the 
fierce grimaces of the leaders of the herd (Kron, done by Samuel E. Wright, 
and Kron's right-hand man Bruton, voice of Peter Siragusa).  Wonderful 
animation  computer-generated images superimposed upon enhanced backgrounds 
filmed at real places around the globe.  But these creatures talk and laugh 
and play: there's an ugly/cute anklyosaur that plays a doggie-like role.  
And Aladar's Modern-age thinking goes against the theories of most 
behavioral scientists:  how many dinos do you think disregarded their 
survival instincts to help out differently-abled brachiosaurs and 
triceratops?
So, we have to suspend just as much disbelief as we do in watching other 
animated adventures.
This adventure starts with a carnivorous dinosaur, horned and fierce, 
charging into the nesting ground of herbivores.  Dinosaurs of various 
species scatter, and Aladar's egg is the only one not crushed from his 
mother's particular nest.  We watch the egg change hands a few times,  from 
an egg-sucking thief who drops it in the water, to the pterodactyl that 
drops it into the forest over an island far out into the sea.
On this island Aladar hatches and grows up among a family of lemurs  
animals that did not actually exist during the Mesozoic era.  We witness the 
typical shenanigans that go on among the young ones  the playful 
monkey-like lemurs as well as the huge Aladar.  It's not hard to tell that 
the newest animation techniques are the only original element in this film.  
Clearly, we have seen the plot many times.  Think THE LAND BEFORE TIME, or 
even the TARZAN films for their themes of exile, selflessness and personal 
redemption.  Disney was firing on all pistons when they produced THE JUNGLE 
BOOK; here they have let go another film that is pleasing to look upon but 
not very deep, another JUMANJI.
The meteor shower is quite an accomplishment, the gigantic and fiery rocks 
slamming into the sea around the island, causing the animals to flee to the 
mainland for their lives.  Also eye-catching are the vistas through which 
Aladar and his small, shaggy family travel  moonscapes as well as lovely 
meadows and ranges of real mountains.  When they meet up with the herd led 
by the grouchy Kron, the characters trudge through what looks like the Old 
West, plains cracked by dryness, canyons and rocks everywhere.
Perhaps the film would be more compelling with stronger conflicts.  What's 
going on here is that a couple of cousins of the T-rex are stalking the 
herd, which consists of an amalgam of dinos, the rear brought up by Joan 
Plowright's Baylene and Della Reese's Eema, a couple of aged but still game 
beasts who appreciate Aladar's kind and gentle approach toward migration.  
Will the herd, and particularly the crusty but lovable oldsters, elude the 
drooling, evil carnosaurs?  Secondarily, will Aladar survive threats from 
the leader of his own pack, Kron, whose sister he seems to be falling in 
love with?  The sister, Neera, by the way, is voiced by Julianna Marguiles, 
in a competent but unremarkable performance.
Music is also unremarkable, from the pen of James Newton Howard.  Most of it 
seemed transparent, accompanying the action scenes well enough.
The actors do wonders in this thinly-plotted work.  Besides the main 
characters listed above, Max Casella does a nice comic turn as a lemur 
called Zinni.  Ossie Davis plays a cantankerous grandfather lemur, Yar, his 
raspy voice imbued with character.
Who is the most likely audience for DINOSAUR?  Children.  It is rated PG for 
some scenes of violence, but these are used to suggest the realities of 
living in a world dominated by carnivores.  Nowhere do we glimpse anything 
too graphic  only one long-range killing, a couple of fight scenes, the 
skeletal remains of a fallen dinosaur.  Modern kids will not be scared.  
This film has gotten a lot of hype, and indeed its trailers looked slick and 
awesome.  But the movie as a whole is a collection of clichés bound together 
by some very nice animation (though even some of this looks plastic and 
fake-y).  Disney's best bet was releasing it now, in May, so that it would 
not be buried by the hopeful blockbusters of summer.


Title
Review for Petrified Forest, The (1936)
Who reads plays by Robert Sherwood anymore?  Or watches movies starring a 
young Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis?
About the only thing corny about the film is that use of period slang, a mix 
of tough-guy talk and early-century cuteness.
Otherwise THE PETRIFIED FOREST is a heavyweight.  One thing a viewer cannot 
miss is Sherwood's themes.  Modern man stranded in a lonely world that is 
reverting to savagery.  Intellectuals being cursed by endless 
self-reflection.  American individualism, the hallmark of settlers of North 
America since the Puritans, disappearing.  The worship of big-name 
criminals.  These topics surface again and again, and the director, Archie 
L. Mayo, manages to keep the focus on the action:  ideas do not overshadow 
plot.
The man mostly likely to be named protagonist is Alan Squier, played by 
British actor Leslie Howard.  He's hiking along the vast Arizona desert as 
the action begins, cars passing him in the dust.  Meanwhile the exposition 
shows us a forsaken service station and diner in far-out-of-the-way Black 
Mesa.  Gabrielle (Bette Davis) waits tables here for her father, the owner, 
and a young, brash gas attendant Boze (Dick Foran) tries hard to make her 
fall in love with him.  In short order, the hiker shows up.  He's a writer, 
a novelist manqué, a man made cynical by the world but refreshed by the 
innocence of a pretty waitress who reads Francois Villon and craves to visit 
France, where her mother traveled after abandoning the family.
Though it takes awhile for action to start, we get plenty of it when Duke 
Mantee and his gang arrive at the isolated café.  We have heard 
foreshadowing radio reports that Mantee has escaped, so when he appears, he 
is larger than life.  Gaby's grandpa  a talky geezer who supplies much 
comic relief  has talked about being one of the first to settle the 
territory 56 years before.  Billy the Kid was an acquaintance of his, and we 
understand Americans' fascination with infamous names.  We don't know if 
Mantee's character will escape, or get gunned down like the outlaw William 
Bonney, but Mantee does keep our attention while he stirs our repulsion.
What's at the heart of the story is human courage.  Alan Squier has the 
courage  called insanity by fellow characters  to make a large sacrifice 
for Gabrielle, who he has met only hours before.  And Duke Mantee, though he 
hides behind his guns for much of the movie, shows a kind of courage at the 
climax.  It's good to have convictions, Sherwood is preaching to us, but 
it's better to act upon them.   The catalyst for all this bravery is human 
love and decency.
Bogart scored a large success for the Mantee role.  He and Howard were 
reprising the same roles from Broadway (Sherwood's play garnered the 1935 
Pulitzer Prize), and Bogart sealed his reputation with a naturalistic 
performance as a tough but still likable gangster.
Bette Davis is excellent as well.  The beauty of youth is upon her here, and 
the performance is believable and strong  as good or better than actor of 
her time.
Howard is a natural as the disillusioned writer.  He's a sort of washed up, 
world-weary youngster  in his mid-thirties, as he states that he was just 
too young to have fought in the Great War.  (Another theme here: the war was 
something glorious to have fought in, and those too young missed out on the 
opportunity to become real men)  Like Davis, Howard knew when to understate 
his character, and the result is a noble if misguided drifter.
The screenplay by Charles Kenyon and Delmer Daves is talky, but at least the 
writers have preserved Robert Emmet Sherwood's magnificent and satirical 
ideas.  Between the World Wars was  a tough time, and the coverage of ideas 
in THE PETRIFIED FOREST explains clearly the political and social 
controversies of the day.
So it's a darn good watch for two reasons  the playwright's agenda and the 
actors' top-notch performances.
83 minutes, Black and White, not rating, though a modern PG, probably.


Title
Review for Mystery Men (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Sociey at http://www.ofcs.org
I'd say the studios needlessly delayed the release of many movies, out of 
fear of losing money to George Lucas' institution back in May.  There's a 
spate of above-average and solid ones out now, too many for me to justifying 
paying to see!  The one we shelled out for last night is "Mystery Men."
You know the premise if you go to movies regularly.  Or perhaps you know it 
because of hype that permeates other media.  Skip the next paragraph if you 
don't need it.
Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) is such an efficient superhero that he has 
virtually cleared the gothic streets of Champion City.  Because he is 
commercial-minded, he wears sponsorship patches, a la race car drivers, 
plastered across his rubber armored suit.  The problem is he's lost the big 
account, the Pepsi endorsement, so he decides to finagle the early parole of 
his nemesis, Cassanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush).  This way he'll have an 
arch-villain to quash again, and his name will stay in the news.  Well, 
Frankenstein captures Amazing rather easily.  So it's up to a group of 
clumsy vigilantes to protect the city from Frankenstein and the group of 
disco-themed henchmen that surround him.  The original trio is comprised of  
Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), The Shoveler (William H. Macy) and the Blue Raja 
(Hank Azaria).  Because their numbers and skills are not a match for the 
insanely bad Frankenstein, the eccentric crimefighters begin to interview.  
With whom do they end up?  A revolting, zit-covered schmendrick called the 
Spleen (Paul Reubens), Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) and The Bowler (Janeane 
Garofalo).  Faced with the task of rescuing Captain Amazing and stopping 
Frankenstein from destroying Champion City with his souped-up death ray, the 
team of wannbe superheroes goes under the tutelage of the "terribly 
mysterious" Sphinx (Wes Studi).  They also enlist the help of Dr. Heller 
(Tom Waits), a brilliant but grizzled scientist who specializes in creating 
non-lethal weapons.  Will they prevail?
What's funniest is the self-reflexive jokes.  The film works best as a 
send-up of all the cliches and conventions of superhero stories you've read 
and heard and watched.  The premise turns post-modern in the sense that so 
many elements are parodied -there's so much subtlety.  When Mr. Furious, 
tired of the Sphinx's trite Yogi-isms, beats him to the punch line, we see 
also the off-center skepticism that marks so many works that recognize 
viewers-have-seen-this-before- so-let's-do-it-a-different-way.  Ben 
Stiller's humor functions so well here because of his style, at once deadpan 
and dumb, seems funnier when it fails the first time; like a Letterman 
monologue, Stiller's jokes plod on until they become self-conscious and 
hilarious.  Any character who holds his breath and pushes and talks in 
stilted phrases like "rage building, blood pressure climbing" gets laughs 
out of the sheer stupidity of his shtick.  Mr. Furious is also the most 
well-rounded of the team, Stiller causing us to like his character because 
he is the neglected underdog.
William H. Macy is even more droll as the Shoveler, the self-effacing 
crimefighter whose wife threatens to leave him.  This guy wears leather work 
clothes and a catcher's chest protector and a lighted hard-hat, and carries 
a chrome shovel that he uses deftly as a weapon. "I shovel," he says.  
Macy's sincerity comes across perfectly;  he's perhaps the most humorous one 
of the bunch because we don't think of him as a comedian.
The Blue Raja is "an effete British superhero" who dresses in cape and 
turban (with no hint of blue) and throws forks and an occasional spoon.  
Never knives, though.  As with the personal life of The Shoveler, we get to 
see behind-the-scenes with Raja, and watch his officious mother ask what is 
going on in her grown son's room.  In a turn-about that's good for several 
chuckles, she ends up proud of him, giving him heirloom flatware to throw 
and asking him to do his British accent again.  Hank Azaria' voice and eyes, 
full of exaggeration, are also perfect in the role.
A casting coup was done with Geoffrey Rush.  This Academy Award winner goes 
just enough over-the-top with the fiendish Frankenstein, who dresses like a 
gothic transvestite and makes his ridiculous pronouncements in a German 
accent.  Too bad not many comic roles are nominated for Best Supporting 
Actor!
Worthy of mention is the vehicle used by the team - which is not called by 
the title epithet until very late - in their assault on the gates of 
Cassanova Frankenstein.  It's a Herkimer Battle Jitney, a half-sized bus 
that Mr. Furious pinches from the scrap yard where he works.  What a great 
name for a vehicle that looks both silly and awesome.
It's only in a couple of places that the film falls into the same potholes 
of cliché we've been fed by other stories.  There's a half-hearted romance 
between Mr. Furious and a waitress at a diner where the heroes eat and 
schmooze.  Claire Forlani is woefully underused as Monica the waitress, 
giving Mr. Furious first scowls and then looks of longing.  Further, for 
ordinary people who dress up in outlandish outfits, a couple of them 
actually seem to have super powers!  The Bowler, for instance, pulls out a 
Lucite ball in which the skull of her father is entombed.  She throws the 
ball with near-deadly effect, but many times the lurid-looking thing floats 
around by itself.  And you tell me:  doesn't Invisible Boy actually 
disappear, even though no one is watching?
Director Kinka Usher paces the film well, and the comic timing is what seals 
the success of the film.  Based on the Dark Horse comic, "Mystery Men" 
blends action and satire so smartly that it reaches a very wide audience.  
It's the kind of movie that piles up one-liners and visual jokes one on top 
of the next, so that a belly laugh is followed by a series of chuckles 
before the next belly laugh.  And it's surely a tribute to say there's not 
much laugh down-time.  If you want to see a knock-down funny film, you must 
be willing to knock down a film with funniness!


Title
Review for Waking Ned Devine (1998)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
During our vacation to Ireland, we toured the grounds of a castle and 
had tea and brown bread in a white-washed, thatched cottage.  At one bed 
and breakfast, I discovered that the 'presence at the lake' mentioned in 
the travel book was a story trumped up for tourists.
What I'm suggesting is the Irish can be very conscious of the stereotype 
that names their country a quaint place and their culture a constant 
source of charm.  I can think of a dozen films shot in Ireland, films 
whose stories are enhanced by the natural beauty.
One might go into 'Waking Ned Devine' skeptical about another narrative 
recording the adventures of colorful townspeople outwitting a more 
powerful force.  It's been done, hasn't it now?
The thing is, "Waking Ned Devine' does it so well that I forgot clichés 
and lost myself in laughter.
Jackie O'Shea (Ian Bannen) and Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly) have 
maps of Ireland all over their faces and aging bodies.  In one of the 
funniest touches of farce in recent film, we see them on speeding 
motorcycles - one completely naked and the other almost there.  This gag 
is only one in a series of quirky moments.  Whether the pair is involved 
with inserting a dead man's dentures or eulogizing one still among the 
living, these actors are natural and believably human.  Bannen perfects 
his expressions as a man who can be crafty or wise.  Kelly is cast well 
as the mild Michael who never tells a lie but must utter one the size of 
the Ring of Kerry.
The early episodes of the film lightheartedly follow the exploits of the 
friends as they attempt to find the winner of the Irish lottery.  From 
the newspaper they know someone in their hamlet of Tullymore has  won.  
In a few delicious and cynical sequences we observe Jackie and wife 
Annie (Fionnula Flanagan) cozying up to neighbors they think might be 
the new millionaire.  Annie bakes a meat pie, while Jackie treats the 
drinkers at Fitzgerald's to 50 pounds worth of rounds.  All this for 
nothing, as Jackie discovers it is Ned Devine who has the lucky numbers.
If we were face to face, I'd lean toward you with this detail, me finger 
in yer buttonhole:  Ned Devine is dead!
Here's the genesis of the elaborate ruse, as Jackie and Michael scheme 
to claim the money for themselves.  So we see the nude dashes on a 
motorcycle, Michael's whiskey-induced courage, Jackie's temporary exile 
from his own house, all in the name of duplicity.  The comedy becomes 
even broader when the lottery official (Brendan F. Dempsey) must verify 
Ned Devine's identity - he will return to the town and question some of 
its 52 residents.  Will it work when the old liars attempt to lure the 
entire population into collusion?
It's not only in scenes with the two old friends that director Kirk 
Jones displays solid comic timing.  It's also when he's directing what 
amounts to an ensemble cast of fine actors.  There's a boy who has 
precocious discussions with a priest.  A pub owner/appliance repairman 
who won't return a toaster to the biddy who won't pay for it.  And in 
the subplot dealing with love, Pig Finn (James Nesbitt) is continually 
pleading with raven-haired Maggie (Susan Lynch) to ignore the stench of 
pigs on him, refuse the attentions of another suitor, and marry the one 
she really loves.  
The characters and the ways they are developed enlarge the quality of 
the film.  Sketching in secondary characters - in addition to extras to 
flesh out the 52 residents - is risky by successful.  
Music accompanies many scenes appropriately.  Flutes and whistles extend 
the cultural trademark of instruments.  A scene in which a lone 
recorder-player precedes four pall bearers, their arms joined under the 
real Ned Devine's coffin, smacks of self-parody.  To tell the truth, I 
wouldn't mind adding the soundtrack of this film to the slot beside my 
Chieftains CDs.
A slight problem with tone arises at the end.  Foreshadowing frequently 
lets us know that these characters are capable of wacky behaviors.  But 
one bit of dark humor - although unchallenged in its hilarity -goes 
somewhat too far over-the-top.
If you are fond of things Irish, you'll love 'Waking Ned Devine.'  It's 
being hyped as a small, brilliant film, but its narrative devices and 
focused acting make it more than a bit of blarney and brogue.


Title
Review for Parent Trap, The (1998)
It's been too long since I've seen the original 1961 THE PARENT TRAP to 
make comparisons.  Let it be enough to say that I watched the remake 
with four boys, ages 11-13, and not one of them griped that it was corny 
or a "chick flick."
First-time director Nancy Meyers summons first-rate performances from 
most of the cast.  Lindsay Lohan stands out in the role of twins Hallie 
Parker, the Napa Valley native who loves her single father, and Annie 
James, the skillfully accented Londoner who meets her sister at summer 
camp.  It must have taken planning and patience to keep the girls' 
manners straight and separate - not to mention to shoot around a 
stand-in;  the result is seamless and uncanny.  There's even a scene in 
which the girls play poker, one of them - we think the stand-in - 
holding her face away from the camera.  But suddenly she turns and we 
see Lohan again.  In fact there are very few scenes, in which the girls 
appear together, that have not been carefully executed.  As an actress, 
Lohan is poised and confident, and her red hair and freckles make 
viewers forget Hayley Mills.
Much of the lightness of tone - and it is a welcome lightness - comes 
from Simon Kunz's portrayal of Annie's butler.  At once a father figure 
and fun-loving pal, the loyal Martin gets many of the laughs in the 
picture.  And he comes by them honestly;  it does not even seem cheap 
when he dresses in leather or in nothing but a Speedo.  Martin is not 
afraid to cry, and meets a sympathetic counterpart in Chessy (Lisa Ann 
Walter), employee of Nick Parker (Dennis Quaid) and nanny to Hallie.  A 
budding romance between the servants actually adds charm to the film, 
though the idea of it sounds sappy and cliched.  As the twins' father, 
Quaid turns in a solid but not an outstanding job.  Natasha Richardson 
is a bit more flamboyant, especially in scenes that have her 
straight-laced Elizabeth swallowing too much airline booze.  No, along 
with the dual main role, it is the supporting roles of the servants, 
along with a little help from Elaine Hendrix as gold-digging Meredith, 
that propels the story into an above-average film.
Pace is very important in this film, especially since Meyers and 
co-writer Charles Shyer avoid fart jokes and crotch kicks.  The 
slapstick humor at camp comes across well, and the very premise of the 
girls switching roles so that their parents would be forced to see each 
other lends unity of plot.  Once again the acting makes for some 
touching reunions, with each 11 year-old never having seen one parent.  
I think what moves the story along so quickly is the editing.  The 
scenes are only as long as they need to be, no fillers stretching them 
out.  For instance, Annie and Hallie offer each other extensive 
coaching:  each must duplicate the other's knowledge and lifestyle.  
These scenes are properly summarized.  
On the whole, THE PARENT TRAP appeals to such a wide audience - 
including adolescent boys - because it tells a story of human triumph.  
It is also intelligent and innocent,  a double threat to most movies 
that ooze or explode out of the huge conglomerates that happen to own 
studios.


Title
Review for A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)
The tone of Steven Spielberg's AI is uneven because of his collaboration 
with the late director Stanley Kubrick  but a mediocre work from either of 
these masters is still superior to fare offered by most other filmmakers.
Apparently Mr. Kubrick had been developing the project for years, and 
requested Mr. Spielberg to take it over.  Based on a short story by Brian 
Aldiss, as well as the screen story by Ian Watson, AI is the first 
screenplay written by Speilberg since his CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD 
KIND.  The piece opens with a speech by Dr. Hobby (William Hurt) to his 
colleagues, a proclamation that even more human-like robots should be 
developed and marketed by his company.  Switch to the home of one of the 
company's employees, Henry Swinton (Sam Robards) and his wife Monica 
(Frances O'Connor), whose son Martin is in cryogenic suspension because of a 
disease beyond current science.  Dr. Hobby and the company place a prototype 
of a robot designed to mimic a human child  David, played by Haley Joel 
Osment, with the Swintons.  For several sequences we are treated to mildly 
creepy scenes, but the real rub begins when Monica commences the ritualistic 
activation of David's special programming  he is designed to love the one 
on whom he imprints, and even more intensely, to seek love from him or her.
What engaging questions Spielberg is raising here.  First (and I heard this 
idea recently on a radio interview unrelated to the movie), why should 
humans strive to create machines in their own images?  Why not make them 
functional in the ways an auto manufacturer engineers a welding robot, 
without legs or a minutely mimetic face?  Just because we might at some time 
have the technology to make a completely plausible copy of a human, does 
that mean we should?  Most importantly  and this idea hearkens back to many 
other films, such as WESTWORLD or the less well-known ZPG (ZERO POPULATION 
GROWTH)  should we interact with these super toys just as we interact with 
other humans  as objects and sources of passion and love?  Can a `mecha' 
(the mechanistic versus the organic, or `orga,' by the way) assume the full 
role of homo sapien?
The grist of the film is the social hierarchy you would expect from Stanley 
Kubrick.  The `mechas' are the quite literally disposable underclass, the 
target of the hatred of the `orgas,' and a marginalized and easily 
persecuted subculture.  In some of the most gripping scenes, the robots are 
rounded up and finally held in a cage.  Reminding us of ancient Christians 
awaiting slaughter by lions, the various generations of personified machines 
are destroyed by different perverse methods, the center of a spectacle known 
as the `Flesh Fair.'  After some very powerful scenes in the upset lives of 
the Swinton family, David is discarded, and falls in with another mecha on 
the run, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a love-slave robot framed for murder.  In 
this central section of the film, David and Joe become both fugitives and 
adventurers, as David pursues his quest of finding the Blue Fairy, the 
character with whom he has become obsessed since hearing that she turned 
Pinocchio into a real boy; David reasons, of course, that after he becomes 
human, his mother would love him more than ever, and accept him back into 
her life.
Haley Joel Osment pulls off his robot act extremely well.  His David is 
supposed to be seamless in his movements  and that's probably not hard to 
act out.  But Osment excels with the emotional infancy that David must 
suffer through.  He's a boy of eleven or so and suddenly must bond closely 
with his `Mommy,' a woman whom he called Monica just seconds before his 
activation.   What a young age to be capable of such consistently strong 
performances!
Spielberg certainly deserves credit for surrounding his main player with 
such capable supporting actors.  The parents, Robards and O'Connor, turn in 
fine performances, and Jude Law is strangely accurate in his portrayal of 
this empathetic yet egotistical automaton.   There's a certain likable 
cheesiness about his personality, especially when he cocks his head and 
early twentieth-century romantic tunes come from his body.  A great make-up 
job too.
The special effects are wonderful, as one would expect from a science 
fiction film with Steven Spielberg at the helm.  Animatronic effects are 
done by the master himself, Stan Winston.  I especially like the little bear 
named Teddy, voiced by the veteran of many animated outings, Jack Angel.  He 
is at once gruff and cute.
I have heard that AI differs from anything Spielberg has done so far.  I 
would agree, though many scenes inevitably evoke memories of portions of his 
work.  There's the confusion of Shanghai streets in EMPIRE OF THE SUN; there 
are the intimate familial relationships (and the moon) from ET; there are 
several images straight from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS.  It is when the story returns 
to David's quest for the Fairy  and for the all-important mother love  
that the momentum slows.  It is fair to say that the third and final act is 
effective enough, though it does not seem to realize its parentage.  What 
comes before it is not exactly adequate foreshadowing for a brutally 
realistic Kubrickian climax; nor is it the comfy Spielbergian rising action. 
  Nevertheless, the film takes big risks, and even though they are not all 
successful, we come away with amazement and thoughts to keep us busy for 
several hours and conversations.


Title
Review for True Grit (1969)
I first saw 'True Grit' at the Westmont Theater in Westmont, New Jersey 
in the summer of 1969.  I was ten years old.  My father got caught in 
traffic on the way there, and we entered the theater ten minutes late, a 
situation the both of us hated.  This was before ushers ejected you if 
you tried to sit through more than one showing, so we stayed for the 
down time and for the cartoon and finally for the first part of the 
film, finding out that Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), the man who killed 
Mattie's father Frank, worked for the family.  We left during the 
rooming house dinner, just when La Boeuf (Glen Campbell) meets Mattie 
Ross (Kim Darby) and commences to flirt with her.
That's how big an impression this film left on me.  I've carried the 
story around for nearly 30 years.  Of course I have a talent for 
recalling rather unimportant details, such as some of the finer points 
of the viewing experience.  Heck, the old Westmont Theater on Haddon 
Avenue was still much more impressive than any of the multiplexes that 
were beginning to pop up in the nearest malls, which were then all the 
way in Cherry Hill and up in Moorestown.
But now 'True Grit.'  Based on a novel by a very solid American 
novelist, Charles Portis (also author of 'Norwood' and 'Gringoes'), the 
movie is a close and successful adaptation.  The screenplay is by 
Marguerite Roberts.
La Boeuf is a Texas Ranger who, just like Mattie, has set out to catch 
the murderer Tom Chaney - one of several apparent aliases adopted by the 
powder-burned, shifty-eyed man who gunned down his boss, Frank Ross, 
outside a saloon.  The gutsy Mattie comes into the town a few days later 
with another ranch hand, and they claim the body.  But Mattie inquires 
about lawmen who might do some bounty hunting for her, and ends up 
walking into the life of one Federal Marshall Reuben J. Cogburn, 
"Rooster" (John Wayne).  Even though no one in the town can say a kind 
word about Rooster, Mattie has heard he has 'true grit,' and pays him 
$25 retainer to plan the hunting down of the scoundrel Tom Chaney.  
Meanwhile, Mattie runs up against La Boeuf, a Ranger paid to bring 
Chaney back to Texas for the killing of a state senator and his dog.  
The Ranger doesn't care for Mattie's honest but "saucy" tongue, just 
like she doesn't care for his bragging and intended waylaying of her 
father's killer.  After various complications, the unlikely trio sets 
out to find Chaney, who has allegedly joined up with a gang led by Ned 
Pepper (Robert Duvall).  They enter a lawless part of the territory, 
where Rooster's toughness and several weapons take hold of the plot.
One strength the film has is its range of conflicts.  Portis knows how 
to structure a conflict so that his readers don't want any part of 
putting down the book.  In fact he builds many conflicts within the main 
one.  Wherever Mattie goes she raises people's hackles, especially those 
of Gen. G. Stonehill (Strother Martin, the quintessential character 
actor who immortalized the line, "What we have here is a failure to 
communicate," in 'Cool Hand Luke').  Stonehill is the horse dealer, and 
he is clearly hornswaggled by the waif-like Mattie.  She not only gets 
from him the money for the ponies purchased by her father just before 
his death, but she threatens him into paying restitution for her 
father's horse, which was stolen by Chaney out of Stonehill's very 
stable.  Needless to say, the teenager Mattie Ross leaves many 
characters nonplused when she walks out of a scene, their brows knit in 
consternation.  
So the film is driven as much by character as it is by action and 
conflict.  We see sonething of Cogburn's personal life, his home the 
back room of a Chinaman's store, his companion an orange tabby named 
General Sterling Price.  Cogburn lost an eye in a Civil War skirmish, 
and he is a heavy drinker.  Indeed he falls from his horse once and, 
unable to climb to his feet, orders Mattie and La Boeuf to camp right on 
the spot for the night.  The 60-ish Wayne plays Cogburn naturally;  no 
one else could own the part.  (He did a reprise in "Rooster Cogburn,' in 
which the character meets his match in an irascible female played by 
Katherine Hepburn.)  Because of his long experience, Wayne has no 
trouble commanding our attention in any scene he's in.  Wayne is also a 
master of the subtle glance, as when he furtively looks at Mattie as he 
tends her snakebite, to see if the incision bothered her.  Always larger 
than life, Wayne shows here that his acting transcends Westerns and 
would qualify him in any genre.
I'm not sure where the casting director conceived the idea of a country 
singer for the part of the ornery Texan, but Glen Campbell works well in 
the part.  His youth and attitude make him a good foil for Wayne, sort 
of in the same way as David Bowie was a good foil for Bing Crosby in 
their duet of "The Little Drummer Boy."  Kim Darby looks much younger 
than her age, a fact that makes her perfect for Portis' strong-willed 
teenager.  She delivers most of her lines with a flavor that mixes 
old-fashioned formalism with Quaker plainness.  Not many contractions 
appear in her conversation.  She occasionally comes across as very 
stiff, though, making it seem as if the characters around her are not 
reacting quite properly to her lines.  In a small but key role, Robert 
Duvall plays a straight-talking outlaw, the gang leader Ned Pepper.  "I 
call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man," is a line of dialogue I 
remember every time I see characters facing off in a movie.  Who hasn't 
Duvall worked with during his illustrious career?
A quarrel I have with the film is the soundtrack.  OK - the song playing 
over the opening credits is sung by Campbell (who is the seventh son of 
a seventh son, but that's only part of my trivial memory!) and it's 
fine, though no Frankie Laine.  Much of the background music 
accompanying the scenes smacks of 1960's and 1970's television schmaltz, 
stuff rejected by 'Gunsmoke' or 'Bonanza.'  And a lot of dialogue has no 
doubt been cut from the novel, causing the film to seem in some places 
minimalistic.  The ending scene, for instance, could be more fleshed out 
before getting anywhere near the danger line for wordiness.
If you are a John Wayne fan, you need to watch this movie again.  It's 
not as strong as 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' or 'Stagecoach' 
perhaps, but I believe it better than his last film, the strong 'The 
Shootist.'  If you are not a Wayne buff, you should still watch it and 
give the old man a second chance.  He has aged well.  As with great 
writers like Hemingway, actors are often regarded differently by 
different decades of viewers.  I hope John Wayne does not go unwatched 
by us and our children.

Review for Antz (1998)
>From the first scenes of the cavern where the ants carry on their busy 
lives, we see that Antz is a movie full of action and ideas.  Too 
cerebral for young children, it has a pace and a charm that will attract 
everyone else.  The film spends much of its 77 minutes looking at the 
worth of the individual and his place in society.  
One indicator of popular culture in Antz is the struggle of the 
individual.  Z, voiced by Woody Allen, plays the worker ant in analysis 
- just one item of Allen's schtick carried over into this, his first 
appearance in animation.  Despite his small stature and relative 
shyness, Z carries through with actions that demonstrate his beliefs.  
>From refusing to stomp mindlessly in a massive line dance, to leaving 
the colony at one point, Z proves himself the ultimate democratic 
insect.  Viewers surely enjoy rooting for the underdog, and Z serves 
well in the role of an inconsequential creature acquiring a voice.  The 
only trouble is that we have to keep our disbelief suspended throughout 
the non-stop anthropomorphism:  isn't it natural for ants to work as a 
collective, for the good of the colony?
Class is another theme explored in Antz.  Along with pulling for the 
weak, we also obsess over royalty - and this plot allows for a real 
queen (Anne Bancroft) and her daughter Princess Bala (Sharon Stone).  
The only plot better than the triumph of an underdog occurs when the 
underdog pursues the heart of a princess.  Z is irresistible when he 
schemes to meet Bala a second time, and stumbles into trouble with the 
princess' fiancé, the square-jawed Mandible (Gene Hackman) and his 
henchman.  Though outrageous, Z's plight is everyman's:  a peasant 
worker aspiring to a higher station - soldier - and what's worse, daring 
to dance with the daughter of the colony's birth-mother.  We love seeing 
it stuck to the powerful and arrogant.
Aside from the university, Hollywood is a staunch promoter of 
correctness.  In Antz, Dreamworks SKG has succeeded in portraying a 
rather pluralistic society;  according to this story, no one should be 
able to say, "All ants look the same."  (We can transfer this sentiment 
to a political context, and see that we are being taught gentle lessons 
in tolerance.)  In any case, directors Eric Darnell and Lawrence 
Guterman adopted techniques from conventional animation, and used much 
of the actor's personality and appearance in the cartoon image.  These 
representations are delightful, as in the case of Christopher Walken's 
long face to match the suave and menacing voice of Colonel Cutter.  
Sylvester Stallone delivers a smart self-parody as Weaver, a huge 
soldier ant with a smallish head but a thorax like a Vick's cough drop.  
So these ants really look nothing like each other, and the animation 
imitates the differences of real life - whether in body type or racial 
features or philosophical views.  Finally, we observe other species of 
insects, including a reunion of Jane Curtin and Dan Ackroyd, as a pair 
of snobby yellow jackets.
Layering conflict upon conflict, the film suggests that we like old and 
busy plots;  here old does not mean stale, as the movie wraps the plot 
in new paper.  Heavy-duty digitized animation is clearly another ware we 
pay our money for.  Antz is just as well-plotted and -animated as Toy 
Story but not as nice to look at.  Its duller earth-tones fit its 
serious themes, though, and the mood is lightened by humor and by 
occasional ventures outside the colony to a land known as "Insectopia."  
Antz mirrors our society in the way it promotes the value and dignity of 
each person.  In an increasingly technological world, viewers like to 
see positive portrayals of common people and of their roles.  Love 
stories and laughs don't hurt, either.

Review for You've Got Mail (1998)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
Visit Online Movie Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
"Those are powerful words," Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) tells Kathleen Kelly 
(Meg Ryan).
He's talking about people falling in love over the Internet, and the 
familiar electronic icon - and voice - that slightly endears itself by 
imitating the real world.  Not getting mail has always made one feel 
neglected or forgotten, as shown in Kathleen's disappointment when she 
fails to receive e-mail at a crucial time from "ny152," the AOL handle 
of the person with whom she has been having an online experience.  Parts 
of "You've Got Mail" are peppered with references to correspondence, 
with paper and stamps and envelopes and messages sent via a breathing 
mail carrier.  This film reminds us that, electrons notwithstanding, 
communication is essential to human life, and it will find a way.
One reason "You've Got Mail" is so pleasant is because of its settings.  
First, New York City is portrayed as a place in bloom, the camera easing 
up through apple blossoms before it enters the windows of its attractive 
characters.  In fact we witness the changes of a few seasons, throughout 
which New York shops, parks and streets come off as charming and safe.  
The dwellings are also very desirable:  we see the opulent digs of  Joe 
Fox and the hypertense editor (Patricia Eden, played by Parker Posey) 
with whom he is shacked up.  Likewise, Kathleen stays in a wonderfully 
maintained and furnished flat with the politically outspoken columnist 
Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear).  All over the apartments we see burnished 
desks, loads of books (mostly hardback, probably purchased by the inch 
by set designers!), and hosts of other belongings that give a cozy feel.  
This story, after all, is not "The Gift of the Magi."
Then there are the all-important computers. Joe and Kathleen use 
laptops, and in an enchanting (director/co-writer Nora Ephron likes that 
word, "enchanting") sequence we watch them watching their live-ins go 
off to work, clearing the coast for more romantic chatting.  The scenes 
involving sending and receiving mail are quite well done, with plenty of 
voice-overs, nice cross-cutting, and even some interior monologues that 
find their ways into words.  Nice modern touches here on the source 
story, "The Shop Around the Corner."  
It's a modern trend that drives the premise too:  Joe is the grandson of 
old Schuyler Fox (John Randolph, always a pleasure to watch), founder of 
Fox and Sons Books, a company that in the 1990's has swallowed up the 
profits of many a small independent bookshop.  When Joe first meets 
Kathleen, he is watching the young children of his father and 
grandfather (another wink at modern lifestyles), and he takes them into 
the rival bookstore to hear the story lady.  This is Kathleen in a 
damsel's conical hat and veil, reading to the enthralled kids gathered 
around the reading nook.  We hear some of her background - her 
now-deceased mother started the store in the 1950's, and started 
Kathleen working there at age six.  Her mother did things like giving a 
box of tissues to a little girl purchasing  "Anne of Green Gables";  
this customer shows up as a grown woman at the closing of Kathleen's 
shop.  Aside from a few shots of Ryan with teary eyes as she touches the 
empty counters of the vacant shop, the filmmakers should be 
congratulated for not ending this subplot happily.  Kathleen asks a wise 
employee of hers (Jean Stapleton in a too-small role), "What would my 
mother do?"  The answer is that her dead, revered mother would have no 
idea.
Of course the closing of the quaint bookshop has everything to do with 
the conflict that arises between Joe and Kathleen.  It's inevitable that 
they become acquainted, flirting subtly until she discovers his 
identity.  The feuding that starts at this point continues throughout 
most of the film, turning out delicious ironies.  When "shopgirl" takes 
up "ny152" on his offer for business advice, "ny152" tells her go "go to 
the mattresses," a line from "The Godfather" signifying a fight to the 
death.  Naturally, the advice resurfaces in a vigorous campaign that 
generates all kinds of bad publicity for the pastry-baking, discount 
book-peddling superstore owner.  The sentiment, "It's not personal, it's 
business," takes on new resonance by the end of the story.
Tom Hanks, already the owner of two Academy Awards for Best Actor, 
surely deserves another nomination for his work.  Probably it will come 
for his Captain John Miller in "Saving Private Ryan."  Hanks continues 
to earn his comparisons to Jimmy Stewart, as a leading man accomplished 
in romantic comedy as well as in heavy-themed drama.  In his tiniest 
expressions we observe how he develops his characters.  What makes Hanks 
a good deal of his money is the muscles in his face.
Similar to Joe, Kathleen also experiences a change.  She is dynamic 
because she first learns to say precisely what she wants to say, when 
she wants to say it;  then she learns that this new eloquence only makes 
her hurtful.  Ryan is best in her playful and hateful scenes with Hanks.  
Unlike Ephron's "Sleepless in Seattle," there are no children caught up 
in the flawed lives of the main characters. (The supporting characters 
do the job here.)  Much of the plot, however, relies on cliches and even 
sly approval of betrayals of trust.  We know what's going to happen by 
the end of the picture, and we know we want it to happen.  What redeems 
the narrative is risk-taking.  Scenes in which Ryan sees herself as a 
girl dancing with her mother in the bookstore, and a touchy business of 
extreme dramatic irony, are powerful storytelling devices.
Thanks again to the filmmakers for keeping the situations suitable for a 
PG rating.  It's not crucial, Hollywood, to attract bigger audiences by 
dirtying your releases!  Take the family along over the holidays, but a 
huge, free-refilled bag of popcorn, and enjoy "You've Got Mail."


Title
Review for My Dog Skip (2000)
Jay Russell's MY DOG SKIP is a charming small film for family members of all 
ages, but it is no HUCKLEBERRY FINN.
We see images of Mark Twain's masterwork in several segments of SKIP.  It 
appears behind the opening credits, in shots of period objects - furnishings 
from kids' rooms of the 1920's and '30's.  Then the protagonist Willie 
Morris (Frankie Muniz) receives a hardback copy from his grandfather.  
Mostly the filmmaker crafts images that are supposed to be from a lost age 
in America - shots you might find in a catalog from a Norman Rockwell show.  
In one sequence, Willie and his Becky Thatcher-like friend Rivers Applewhite 
(Caitlin Wachs) tramp along a path, and later they paddle down a sleepy 
creek in a canoe.  It doesn't matter that the film is set during the Second 
World War, almost 60 years after HUCK FINN was published.  Russell is out to 
evoke a mood of nostalgia, an emotional tone of innocence mixed with 
virtually any genuine American ethic you can think of: hard work, 
independence, freedom, and so on.
The only problem is, these elements combine to create a batch of clichés, 
and they end up taking undue attention from the plot elements that are 
trying their hardest to hang together as a story.  Even the set decoration 
is overdone, from the vintage baseball and football gear to the product 
advertisements cluttering the main street or painted on brick walls.  The 
actors playing the parents of Willie's hero, next-door neighbor Dink Jenkins 
(Luke Wilson), are shown pausing (a real Rockwell moment) after they hang a 
small service banner from the porch ceiling.  (Weren't these star flags hung 
in windows, by the way?)  It may have been more appropriate to suggest a 
hint of the '40's, instead of flavoring the film so strongly.
The coming-of-age story is good enough.  Loner Willie's only guests at his 
birthday party are elderly relatives and his own parents.  Against her 
husband's wishes, Mrs. Morris (Diane Lane) gives Willie a dog, an "only dog" 
for an only child.  What follows is a series of episodes typical of growing 
up stories.  We watch Willie in various stages of happiness and sadness in 
the town of Yazoo, Mississippi.  At times both Willie and his pooch fall 
into jeopardy - scenes mainly involving a couple of bootleggers hiding their 
hooch in a cemetery.  These scenes are also reminiscent of Twain: Tom Sawyer 
this time.  And the head bootlegger Junior might be compared to either Injun 
Joe or Huck's Pap.
The boy-and-his-dog story is engaging.  Frankie Muniz (from the television 
series "Malcolm in the Middle") is a pleasant discovery, his face expressive 
and boyish enough to play a few years younger than his actual age.  Muniz 
has a way of crinkling his smallish mouth to show anger or frustration, and 
he's also convincing in his onscreen crying.
His dog - the title character - is played by the Jack Russell terrier Moose, 
who also portrays the rascally Eddie on the t.v. show "Frasier."  Excepting 
the brief shots in which you can see Moose staring off-camera at his 
trainer, this dog is wonderfully photogenic and clever.  And he seems to 
have a true bond with Willie.  He's the reason the film tips the scales more 
toward success than failure.
Willie has three enemies that become friends, and unfortunately these boys 
do not act their roles as comfortably as many other child actors would.  
Perhaps this is also a result of stereotypical characterization:  the dim 
follower, the dirty towheaded sidekick, the suspender-wearing, loutish 
bully.  None of these young actors can match Muniz's air of ease.
As Willie's father, Kevin Bacon tries valiantly to be a gruff but loving 
presence.  His character lost his lower leg in combat in the Spanish Civil 
War, and now rides out his work life as an accountant, hiding his injury 
behind a desk.  A small snag is that Bacon is not as old as the character 
he's playing, and he does not display a convincing Mississippi accent.  
(Most characters don't, if you want the truth, with the possible exception 
of Rivers.)
It's admirable that one of the film's agendas is to promote tolerance.  
Willie talks briefly with an African-American boy, who brags about a black 
athlete named Waldo Grace in the same way Willie brags about Dink Jenkins.  
We see blacks occupying the balcony seats in the town movie palace, and 
black families sitting around their part of town; at the end we even spot 
Willie and his friends watching Grace pitch and hit the horsehide at the 
Negro ball ground.
MY DOG SKIP is a mixed bag of pleasures and conventions.  I would recommend 
it for both children and adults, though adults may find a few of its minutes 
taken up by sentimentality.  It's worthwhile for its PG rating as well: my 
11 year-old daughter liked the scenes featuring Willie and Rivers (or should 
I say Huck and Becky, or even Forrest and Jenny?)


Title
Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
In this often-advertised sequel to 'Austin Powers,' there's a scene in which 
Scott Evil (Seth Green), son of Dr. Evil, pretends to sneeze, emitting the 
word "Ripoff!"  Oddly enough, it's the self-reflexive catchword of the film, 
from the opening moments with the James Bond theme and 'Star Wars' narrative 
script, to the wide-open-for-sequel ending.  Worse, all kinds of products 
are forced upon the script and our eyes.
There's also no doubt the film will do well at the box office.  A theater 
full of kids 12 through 18 or so - the buck-spending target audience - made 
this no secret.  Clearly, what we demand is gross-out humor, and "The Spy 
Who Shagged Me' does this best.  I have to hand it to Mike Meyers:  some of 
the grossest moments in comedy appear in this flick.  Meyers' alter-ego "Fat 
Bastard" is involved in fat jokes and poop jokes that had the audience 
roaring.  And the part that made me laugh the loudest was a scatological 
tour-de-force.
The premise:  not much of one.  Austin Powers (Meyers)  is single and 
swinging again, but his nemesis Dr. Evil is out to thwart him however he 
can.  Evil has a tiny clone he calls "Mini Me" (Verne Troyer), and the two 
of them time-travel back to 1969, their motive to steal the "mojo" - the 
sexual life-force - from the cryogenically-frozen Austin Powers.  A minor 
drawback to this premise is that we miss Robert Wagner's excellent henchman, 
Number 2, for the rest of the film.  Rob Lowe, however, does play a right-on 
imitation as Number 2 30 years younger.
You guessed it:  Powers follows the evil-doers back to the stereotypical 
psychedelic decade.  There he runs into Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), 
an agent on Austin's side.  The trouble is, even though Felicity 
inexplicably falls for the crooked-toothed Don Juan, there can't be any 
"shagging," as Powers' mojo has been stolen.  What complicates the plot is 
Evil's plan to deploy a phallic-shaped laser to wipe out Washington D. C.  
Will Austin save the world?  Beat Dr. Evil?  Most importantly, will he get 
the girl?
As the title character, Mike Meyers delivers on the flat-out silliness we've 
come to expect of him.  He has a knack of making even badly written dialogue 
funny.  The way he holds his mouth, the way he points his gaze  And 
portraying the Scottish "Fat Bastard" as well as Dr. Evil gets him triple 
the giggles.  Something I found annoying, though, was how easy it is for 
Meyers to get laughs;  he's like the class clown who gets the attention he 
wants by making the stupidest and grossest comments imaginable!
Heather Graham performs well enough as Felicity Shagwell, though she does 
not distinguish herself.  Part of the mediocrity is the way her character is 
written:  she is far too compliant, a 'Laugh-In " dancer with lines.  (A 
pointless motif takes the form of Austin dancing with these 
vibrantly-dressed  groovers, by the way.)
Early on we see a schtick with Jerry Springer, in which Scott reveals his 
plight as the son of a madman bent on world domination.  One of the film's 
funnier bits of satire, this scene shows off the conflict between father and 
son.  It helps that Scott comes along on the time machine;  the film is 
better for Seth Green's presence.
What makes "Austin Powers:  The Spy Who Shagged Me" an average film at best? 
  It's that we are able to predict too much.  Sure, movies always rely on 
viewers' knowledge of culture and clichés;  but there's just not enough 
originality here to work with.  And when the film tries to get heady, we 
actually hear explanations of allusions that flew over the heads of most 
young viewers.  The bottom line is ambivalence.  If I believe that a film is 
worthwhile if it gives me a belly laugh, then I should recommend this 
'Austin Powers' sequel.  But I can't.  Not that it matters, as I heard a 
teenager a few rows in back of me quip, "We have to buy this on video."


Title
Review for Anna and the King (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Andy Tennant's Anna and the King is so full of ideas that it doesn't need 
all of the gripping action.  But the action doesn't hurt.
In 1862 a widowed Englishwoman named Anna Leonowens brings her son Louis 
from India to Siam (now Thailand).  Already we have a white woman fending 
for herself in a culture in which men are all-powerful, and the king is a 
god.  Mrs. Leonowens (Jody Foster) is charged with educating the fifty-odd 
children of the King of Siam (Chow Yun-Fat);  she is a Bible-reading 
Christian bent on preserving the Western traditions that shape her life.  
Although the king is open-minded enough to know his children need to know 
about Western ways in order to carry Siam into the modern world, he is 
firmly grounded in his world:  Buddhism, polygamy, slave-owning, monarchy.  
Nothing but conflict could result from his meeting a strong-minded woman who 
refuses to touch her forehead to the ground before his feet.
Heard this story before?  Yes, it's the same source material used in the 
Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I, the king's role made famous 
by Yul Brynner, and played recently by Lou Diamond Phillips.  This film is 
no musical, though its score is indeed well done (save for the forgettable 
pop song that runs over the early closing credits).  The king's large family 
and the clash between cultures remain central here, and even the motif of 
dancing has survived, a metaphorical substitution for passion, perhaps.  But 
what helps this modern adaptation of Anna Leonowens' memoirs is the 
political and military intrigue.
Like a terrible news item from a contemporary Third World country, death 
squads are killing innocent Siamese women and children, and hanging their 
bodies as warnings to peasants.  These Burmese squads appear to be under the 
distant protection of English interests, as trading and other commercial 
ventures have resulted in British presence around the globe.  So King 
Mongkut of Siam is forced to dispatch a regiment to deal with these 
black-clothed marauders.  Deceit and betrayal quickly enter the picture, and 
the very existence of the dynasty is threatened.  Thus the stage is set for 
war, the ultimate backdrop to highlight the personal stories that make up 
the subplots.
As Anna Leonowens, Jody Foster would seem to be the wrong pick.  An American 
to play such a British character?  But Foster pulls it off admirably, with 
the understated acting that only a veteran could deliver.  At times her 
voice is almost too quiet, even raspy, as she converses with her son, 
reinforcing lessons the boy's father would have liked.  It's rather a 
pleasure to see such a human portrayal, instead of the bucking-up, 
bearing-down façade that has become a stereotype for any Englishman faced 
with oppression.  And her dialect works as well - I did not detect one 
slippage, one American pronunciation.
Foster's performance is outshone only by the performance of Chow Yun-Fat as 
the King.  His acting is understated as well, buttressed by a smooth 
confidence that convinces us in every scene we watch.  Clearly Chow is 
expert in mixing the conflicting elements of real characters, in this case a 
domineering mien blended with bemused tolerance.  Look for him to be 
nominated for several awards for this solid portrayal.
The other cast members turn in strong support.  As the young heir to the 
throne, Prince Chulalongkorn, Keith Chin is very convincing.  Director Andy 
Tennant makes full use of the Prince's position, as a short voice-over tells 
us how the future ruler was influenced by his father and the foreign woman 
who touched their lives.  Randall Duk Kim is perfectly cast as General Alak, 
a soldier and indefatigable politician, his grimaces and pronouncements 
memorable.
Another star of this film is the costumes.  Remarkable Victorian dresses 
adorn Anna and the Siamese women during the banquet staged to impress 
English visitors.  Further, the colorful native garb is wonderfully 
designed.  The word "sumptuous" comes to mind, almost too much so, 
considering that the 1860's setting.  Similar applause goes to the set 
decoration, such an important aspect in a period drama.
The main message of the film can be interpreted as a simple statement:  
personal freedom is paramount.  In this film we can trace the ideas upon 
which much of Western civilization was founded - especially the emergence of 
the importance of the individual, and the realization that love is the food 
without which the human soul starves.  It's ironic that the king of the 
Siamese Empire, whose most trusted general hates imperialistic influences, 
ends up admitting that he can understand how a man could love just one 
woman, a way of life widespread in the West.  Of course this theme is very 
bankable, and happens here to tie in perfectly with the film's sources of 
conflict:  a society dominated by males, predicated on slavery, and steeped 
in the methods of a feudal past.
So the reason Anna and the King succeeds is clear:  its director uses an 
epic frame but highlights a very intimate story.  It's the same with any 
good story - within the span of history we are fascinated by well-drawn 
characters.  It's also clear that the tendencies of Hollywood resemble those 
of human nature:  a short memory never learns a lesson.
This film needs to be as long as it is, 140 minutes, occupying its length 
with meaningful scenes and a climax reminiscent of mid-century war films.  
The few scenes of violence remind us of the differences inherent in cultures 
distant in both miles and time.  There is no nudity or vulgar language, 
although the word "concubine" surfaces now and again.  Viewers 10 and over 
will enjoy the action and learn from the history.


Title
Review for Cradle Will Rock (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
The opening scene of Tim Robbins' historical fiction CRADLE WILL ROCK shows 
a moment that sets the tone for the entire sprawling piece.  Emily Watson's 
character, Olive Stanton, awakens on the stage behind the screen of a 1930's 
movie palace.  She's homeless, and as she puts on her stockings and shoes to 
skedaddle before the manager catches her, we watch the backward images up on 
the screen.  Quickly the social milieu is clear, and Robbins has done his 
job of making history accessible:  he has shown the place of an individual 
within the roiling span of history.  The Great Depression is on, and the 
lives of countless Americans are in fact backwards.
What stands at the center of the narrative is the play "The Cradle Will 
Rock" by Marc Blitzstein.  It is a musical with a political bent, a 
pro-union diatribe against the exploitative capitalists who are scrambling 
to protect their interests from what they perceive as a very serious 
Communist threat.  As part of the Federal Theater Project - a division of 
the Works Progress Administration - the play is being produced by John 
Houseman (Cary Elwes) and directed by Orson Welles (Angus MacFadyen).  
Following the production of the play, the main plot takes us through 
rehearsals - including a few tantrums thrown by Welles - all the way through 
opening day, the day after the Federal Theater Project has been closed by 
the government.
With painstaking research and risk-taking that is quite creative, Tim 
Robbins holds our interest through the entire piece.  CRADLE WILL ROCK 
(though I don't care for the title) is a film full of ideas, inspired 
directing, and political messages that are still fresh.  There is a great 
deal of talk about prostitution, in both literal and figurative senses.  Is 
it selling out when Olive sings a song for a nickel on the street corner?  
When an artist paints a mural for a commission, or when a writer curtails 
her script to match the wishes of benefactors?  What comes first, survival 
or artistic integrity?  Robbins is to be admired for addressing these 
questions and many more.
One risk the director takes is in the strangeness of the playwright 
Blitzstein.  Hank Azaria plays the tortured writer, whom we see early in the 
film, working in his cramped apartment on the script to CRADLE.  Because 
he's not slept in two days, he seems to be hallucinating, the figures of his 
deceased wife and of the German dramatist Bertolt Brecht appearing to him 
frequently.  Later, after his arrest for being in the midst of a labor 
rally, Blitzstein composes large parts of his play from a jail cell, the 
apparitions acting as a sort of chorus.  Azaria does a nice transparent job 
with his character;  he is never obtrusive, but captures well the generous 
nature of the socially aware playwright.
Emily Watson, doing a very effective American accent, is fine as Olive 
Stanton.  After life hands her a hard time, she suddenly lands one of the 
lead roles in the Welles-directed vehicle, and her dreams proceed to come 
true.  One is reminded of Drieser's novel SISTER CARRIE, in which a young 
and vulnerable woman makes good on the stage.  Olive was selected by the 
producers because of her innocence;  even Watson's singing voice is plain 
and sincere.
As Orson Welles and John Houseman ( adults will remember Houseman from the 
television series "The Paper Chase"  and Smith Barney commercials, and 
perhaps Welles from wine commercials and appearances on the "Tonight Show" 
with his magic tricks), are done adequately by MacFadyen and Elwes.  In 
parts, though, MacFadyen overacts, and Elwes slips into pompous caricature.  
Their function in the plot is fulfilled well, however.
Robbins's wife Susan Saradon plays Margherita Sarfatti, an agent of the 
fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.  She's in the states to raise money for 
the building of an Italian war machine.  The relevance of the politics hits 
us cleverly, as we watch wealthy magnates like Gray Mathers (Philip Baker 
Hall) and William Randolph Hearst obtain masterpieces of Italian art in 
exchange for large cash stakes.  Again, art being sold out, this time in the 
most pathetic of senses, to be used by Mussolini and his ally, Hitler.  
Sarandon is best when she lets the character's politics hang all the way 
out, as when she scolds artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) for his political 
idealism and how he worked it into a mural commissioned by Nelson 
Rockefeller (John Cusack) to decorate a wall inside Rockefeller Center.
This political theme is explored further through the subplot involving 
Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones), the administrator of the Federal Theater 
Project.  Jones gives Flanagan a sincerely mature and open-minded point of 
view; without hesitation she funds a worthwhile children's play, only to 
hear later some scandalous rumors about how the play encourages rebellious 
behavior!  In a scene out of countless movies set two decades later, we 
watch as Flanagan is grilled by misguided politicians with witch-hunting 
agendas.  Quiet but assertive, Jones tries to refute as well as she can the 
lurid assumptions surrounding her agency.  One hopes to see Jones  as a 
featured actress in many films to come.
Bill Murray, as Tommy Crickshaw the ventriloquist, and Joan Cusack, as Hazel 
Hoffman, work well together and serve as would-be love interest.  Although 
she works as a clerk in the WPA agency that hires the artists for the 
programs, Hoffman's politics eventually send her to testify against what she 
perceives as politically and racially dangerous topics.  Murray has a crush 
on the younger Hoffman, and seems to take up her torch merely because of his 
attraction.  Both actors have such sadly expressive faces as they discover 
their respective truths.
Robbins' directing chores must have kept him quite busy.  It is difficult to 
create a semblance of confusion, and the irony is that Robbins had to be 
supremely organized to make his action seem so chaotic.  In one of the most 
moving segments toward the end, Robbins employs canny cross-cutting that 
builds momentum among the subplots.  One smallish problem is that it is hard 
to tell if some scenes are meant as tour-de-force or as serious satire; but 
the sheer power of the premiere of "The Cradle Will Rock" offsets these 
concerns, with its unconventional staging and strong socio-political 
undercurrents.
The film is rated R for occasional strong language, some nudity - among 
artist Diego Rivera's models - and brief sexuality.  It would be fine for 
children 15 and above, and would definitely engage viewers who like to learn 
about history and drama.

Review for City of Angels (1998)
My wife said it best as we left the theater, It was uneven.
What's charming about the film are its engaging takes on life -- city, 
human, celestial.  When we first look upon the angels Seth (Nicolas 
Cage) and Cassiel (Andre Braugher) sitting atop superhighway signs, we 
know the narrative will be pleasantly slanted and watchable.  Their 
wings and halos replaced by black overcoats, these messengers from God 
patrol streets, construction sites, and especially libraries.  It is in 
the library that Seth and mortal Dr. Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) meet in two 
emotional scenes, one beginning their relationship and the other 
determining if it will end.
I found the angels' ability to read humans' thoughts not so much 
original as fascinating.  As the camera moves among the cars in a 
traffic jam or among carrels in the library,  we are permitted to 
mind-surf, catching glimpses of what life is like in this very human, 
"naked city."  It is gritty yet beautiful, from the scenes in the 
hospital in which Meg tries to prolong life, to the scenes in which the 
angels  seen only by us and by those they choose  give humans small 
embraces of protection.  John Seale's cinematography paints Los Angeles 
in colors Maxfield Parrish would use:  glowing and clean;  even shots of 
seaminess are uncluttered and objectified.  
The major roles are indeed well-acted.  Cage, his hair meticulously in 
place, even his eyebrows handsomely trimmed, casts his big, 
compassionate eyes upon human suffering.  Unlike most of his fellow 
celestials (who at times look alarmingly remote and agent-like), Seth 
pursues a human.  (Isn't it a breach of the ethics of invisibility to 
watch a woman as she bathes, or kisses her boyfriend?)  On her part, Meg 
Ryan is appropriately tentative in dealing with Seth.  Where another 
might think him an odd preacher or even a stalker, Maggie eventually 
realizes his gentleness, and soon harbors amorous thoughts that Seth 
intercepts.  Her performance is most riveting when she discovers Seth's 
corporeal form is bloodless;  her mix of fear, bafflement and anger 
alerts us to the crux of her emotional predicament.
The minor roles in this picture function like confidants in a good play, 
enabling the leading roles to succeed.  Dennis Franz does a most 
convincing job as Nathaniel Messinger, a gluttonous, life-loving patient 
of Maggie's.  It's not far-fetched that Franz will get a nod as Best 
Supporting Actor nominee.  One of the hard-to-believe sequences has 
Nathaniel leaving the hospital to chow down at a diner (while Seth, who 
has manifested himself to another mortal, eats nothing).  But 
Nathaniel's gusto, along with Maggie's mutual feelings, causes Seth to 
take a fall into the grimy pleasures of humanity.  In his role as 
Cassiel, Andre Braugher (say it ain't so, Andre, that you're leaving 
Homicide!) is underused.  Further, some of his banter with Seth is not 
transparent enough.
Just as Braugher does a masterful job with average lines, Cage admirably 
juggles a handful of clichés.  Are we to believe that Seth, formerly an 
immortal who for ages has observed humans, is not cagey enough to avoid 
hitch-hiking, in the rain, outside a nude-dancing palace, and then 
benevolently greeting a carload of scumbags who mug him?  Would he 
really act so child-like at the strong scent from a bottle of perfume?  
And possibly the most unforgivable piece of writing has Seth making no 
direct communication with his Maker.  It is stated in the film that "No 
one believes in us (angels) anymore";  a big problem is that the movie 
contradicts this claim by further popularizing all things angel.  What 
we wind up with is another New-Agey, secular treatment of religious 
themes.  
Let me end by commending the sequence in which Seth falls to earthiness.  
Director Silberling's black-and-white montage is dramatically brilliant, 
evoking the precious and intimate side of humanity remembered by the 
deceased characters in Our Town.  I also liked that the ending of City 
of Angels would not please followers of Disney.  I only wish the ending 
sustained the emotional power of what comes just before it.  And I'm an 
easier critic than my wife.


Title
Review for Prince of Egypt, The (1998)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Important stories have a way of getting themselves retold.  As part of 
the greatest story ever told, the story of Moses is done up with amazing 
technical skill and a good amount of interest in DreamWorks' 'The Prince 
of Egypt.'
In a wonderfully poetic opening sequence, we watch Moses' mother place 
him in a basket.  But he does not float serenely through the bulrushes;  
instead the infant is nearly ruined by crocodiles, hippopotami, and 
several boats.  Finally he is rescued by the Queen (voice of Helen 
Mirren).  So much for background, as the action jumps twenty or so years 
to show an unrealistic but hilarious chariot race between the two sons 
of Pharoah - Rameses (Ralph Fiennes) and the adopted Moses (Val Kilmer).  
There is a bond between the brothers that gives the very story mythic 
overtones, as we know the bond must eventually be shattered.
The meat of the story covers Moses' transformation from prince to Hebrew 
prophet.  In one scene Moses runs upon his real sister, Miriam (Sandra 
Bullock), and brother, Aaron (Jeff Goldblum).  Of course he rejects any 
notion of being related to these lowly slaves.  The movie does a nice 
job of portraying the subtle reckonings of memory:  Moses somehow 
recovers familiarity with Miriam's song, the one his mother sang to him 
in his infancy.  But this is only the first in a series of revelations.  
After Moses irrevocably severs his connections with the Egyptian court, 
he takes to living with desert people, serving the priest of Midian, 
Jethro (Danny Glover).  Moses and Jethro's daughter Tzipporah (Michelle 
Pfeiffer) marry, and after a time Moses (as a pre-Christ figure) gives 
up his private life as a shepherd and fulfills God's will.
'The Prince of Egypt' would not benefit from comparison to Cecil B. De 
Mille's classic 'The Ten Commandments.'  'Commandments' has the length 
and expanse of an epic - three hours of human struggle with no songs or 
animated whimsicality to lighten the subject matter.  Yes, it is dated 
by the time in which it was made, but 'dated' does not mean 'bad.'  The 
scope of the narrative in De Mille's movie is breath-taking and, 
besides, Charlton Heston's voice has it all over Val Kilmer's.  'Prince' 
probably benefits from it shortness, considering its main audience is 
children.  The most remarkable miraculous events are touched upon - the 
infestations of frogs and locusts, pestilence, and a scary sequence - 
the origin of Passover, in which the first-born of Egypt (except those 
whose lintels are marked with the blood of the lamb) die with the most 
forlorn of exhalations.  This animated feature does fair justice to 
these serious events.
The most striking, I think, is the Red Sea parting.  This was my 
favorite scene, and my son's.  It has been broadcast far that DreamWorks 
spent countless human hours depicting the attempt of Moses and the Jews 
to leave Egypt, only to be blocked by the sea.  Rameses' legions are 
bearing down upon them, creating an almost perfect dramatic moment.  
Executive producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and his entire staff have 
accomplished a magnificent task, a five-plus minute sequence of terror 
and wonder that is as fascinating to watch as any moments filmed.  What 
an idea - to show the ocean life as the fleeing people stumble under the 
vast curtains of parted water!
Other strong parts of the production include music and original 
storytelling.  My wife and daughter - both very able musicians - liked 
the songs.  Ten-year-old Kristin claims to have almost cried during 
"Deliver Us" and "All I Ever Wanted."  I was struck by the layered 
texture of the song during which Hotep and Huy (voices of Martin Short 
and Steve Martin) are trying to upstage Moses and his 'trick' with his 
staff.  We hear the names of Egyptian gods, voices chanting in the 
background, over top of which Short and Martin sing the main lyrics.  
(The lyrics themselves - "You're playing with the big boys now" - are 
not as strong as those in other songs, though.) Another fabulous 
sequence was a dream in which Moses continues to realize his Hebrew 
heritage.  Although the sequence is not sung, it is dramatized through 
animated hieroglyphic-like figures.  Moses as pictograph flees from 
legions of soldiers.  Then in a stunning epiphany, Moses awakens and 
runs to the actual wall on which this verse from the book of Exodus is 
recorded (1:22): "Pharaoh then commanded all his subjects, 'Throw into 
the river every boy that is born to the Hebrews, but you may let all the 
girls live'."  All his adoptive father can utter in explanation is, 
"They were only slaves."
The animation style is original and well-drawn.  Many of the characters 
seem attenuated, rather Barbie-like in shape, but this is in keeping 
with the Egyptian imagery of the pictographs -dogs and gods of graceful 
slimness.  Pharoah is done with kingly splendor, like the sphinxes and 
other likenesses modeled after him.  Patrick Stewart lends an 
appropriately regal voice to this character.  Most of the other actors 
perform admirably in their voice roles.  They are, if nothing else, 
transparently efficient.  Ones that draw positive attention to 
themselves include Stewart, Jeff Goldblum (you can see his cerebral 
fussiness in Aaron's mannerisms, too), Ralph Fiennes, and, in a tiny 
role, Danny Glover.
In all, 'The Prince of Egypt' is not to be missed.  Forgo other holiday 
films for this one, regardless of your age.  It is destined to be 
included in the canon of filmed Biblical literature and, besides, it's a 
lot of fun.


Title
Review for Rushmore (1998)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
When you decide you don't like a film while you are still watching it, 
it is hard to turn back.
Sure, I like when films take quirky and unexpected turns as much as the 
next moviegoer.  But when the final third of 'Rushmore' commenced its 
pointless darkness - a futile evocation of the whimsicality of revenge 
and friendship - I had nearly made up my mind that all the press 
received by the film was wrong-headed.  The final minutes were more to 
my liking, but the film was still marred for me.
'Rushmore' opens with a fantasy in which the main character, Max Fischer 
(Jason Schwartzman), imagines himself solving a math problem that would 
baffle Will Hunting.  His classmates in the private academy are 
ecstatic, and Max is a hero.  Of course this scene proves ironic, as we 
soon see that Max is one of the worst students on campus.  Having 
attended Rushmore since his primary grades, Max has immersed himself in 
extra-curriculars - he is either an officer or the founder of 
organizations involving beekeeping, fencing, lacrosse, French, 
wrestling, stamp and coin collecting, and many others.  Most 
impressively, Max writes and stages his own plays.  In fact, one of the 
film's strengths is these productions:  their exaggerated grittiness 
becomes a tour-de-force, and we cannot help but admire and like their 
creator.  Behind the set of Max's 'Serpico' a small-gauge elevated train 
runs through a miniature city more detailed than David Letterman's set.  
Aside from Max's fantasies and quirky imagination, we also see inventive 
narrative techniques, such as a theater curtain opening and closing, the 
months of the story's span flashing across the velvet folds.  So there 
are several charming and eccentric elements that endear the story to the 
viewer.
Unfortunately, Max's behavior itself ends up over-the-top.
After 15 year-old Max meets and falls in love with a Rushmore first 
grade teacher (Rosemary Cross, played by Olivia Williams), he begins a 
pattern of behavior that is at first worshipping - pouring her lemonade 
as she grades papers in the library - and finally obsessive.  Practiced 
in the pathology of lying, Max deceives and manipulates countless 
friends;  because his actions become so despicable, we are perhaps 
unwilling to forgive him wholly.  Further, would the victims of such a 
young skunk realistically not only accept apologies but befriend Max 
again? Here's the rub.
Bill Murray acts very well in the film.  As Herman Blume, a wealthy 
alumnus of Rushmore, Murray tempers his goofy comic expression with a 
cynical ennui that fits just right with his part.  Max compares very 
favorably to Blume's twin hooligan sons, and Blume likes Max's 
sycophantic ambition so well that he chucks Max a job offer.  One of 
Murray's strong suits is his sudden bursts of silliness, sprinting away 
across a playground or darting into a children's basketball game to 
block a shot.  Later begins one of the major conflicts, the subplot 
encompassing the rivalry between Max and Herman, after Herman too falls 
in love with Miss Cross.  Again Murray is properly deadpan, the camera 
lingering on his jaded but hilarious expression just long enough.  Note 
his matching shirts and neckties, a wink at classy tackiness!
Jason Schwartzman does a fine job as well.  His resemblance to a very 
young Dustin Hoffman is inevitable, especially his head-on approach to 
other characters.  It's a shame that the screenplay by -------and 
director Wes Anderson does in the credibility of his character.  The 
writing also short changes Olivia Williams' character:  Miss Cross is 
pretty, but aside from missing a dead husband and reading to her 
students, she never does anything that develops her character.  We fail 
to witness even a montage of moments that bond her to either male 
character trying to win her attention and love.
Mason Gamble as Dirk Calloway, Max's protégé at Rushmore, and --------- 
as Margaret Yang, Max's quasi-girlfriend and gun moll in one of his 
plays, both hand in wonderful performances.  Most of their motivations 
seem right, and their acting shows a nice transparency.
The time of 'Rushmore' - 89 minutes - is right.  My wife looked at her 
watch even during this duration.  I am a man who like to fall in love 
with a movie, and with 'Rushmore" I was just able to like its 
characters.  Instead of watching a thoroughly engaging story, what I saw 
was a dark and underdeveloped character study.

Review for Blair Witch Project, The (1999)
This is more of a response than a review, but I think "The Blair Witch 
Project" is a great film - just not necessarily a great horror film.
I admire it most for its creativity.  Filmmakers Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel 
Myrick ran with the idea of shoving three young actors out in the Maryland 
woods.  They must operate their own cameras and improvise all of the 
dialogue.  Of course there is always the fall-back of editing.  But the 
sheer originality is refreshing to watch.  I guess we have to overlook that 
the camera seems to be running much of the time, and not only when the 
supposed cameramen are filming actual parts of the documentary.  We see 
Heather (Heather Donohue) introducing the legend, the camera showing the 
faded stones of a graveyard.  But we also watch the trio leave Josh's (Josh 
Leonard) car on the side of the road, Heather working the camera as the men 
behind her trudge into the woods in search of the locales involved in the 
legend.  Although we never witness mundane things like meals, we do see 
several breaks the characters take as they hike under the trees.  And the 
choppiness of sudden cuts to the darkness of night is excusable.
I'm sure the best thing about the set, to the filmmakers, is that it was 
free.  The remote forest is pristine, primeval, and most of all, ominous.  I 
thought of Nathaniel Hawthorne's short stories, so-called civilized man 
venturing into the darkness, possibly to meet his doom.  At times we watch 
shots of the forest's extreme beauty; then darkness descends and the story 
tightens down to small enclosures of nylon pup tents.  These are familiar 
scenes to viewers who have camped.  What makes the characters take notice is 
the unfamiliar noises during the blackest part of night.  Rocks knock 
together, branches rustle, and human voices cry hoarsely and once even 
laugh.
Why do I say "The Blair Witch Project" is a great film?  Mostly for the 
chances it takes to be different.  The premise is a cool idea, and you can't 
help liking these indedpendent filmmakers and their gutsy young actors.  My 
bottom line is that the piece succeeds as a psychological study as much as 
any other genre.  I've read snippets of hype like the movie "does for the 
woods what 'Jaws' did for the water," and yes, there is a lot of suspense 
worked into the package.  But 'Jaws' is a suspense film, not properly 
horror.  At its heart, "Blair Witch" follows the fascinating degeneration of 
psyches:  as they become lost, assault each other in anger, and run in 
terror through the lightless woods, these jaded young adults let us glimpse 
the core of their humanity, and we are moved.
But maybe people don't want to be moved by the plights of characters; maybe 
they view these figures only as victims - fodder for a monster that they 
eventually hope to see, and that they hope is gruesome and more terrible 
than any special effects they have previously gawked at.
There's the rub.  Hey, typical American viewer!  Don't you realize yet that 
the most terrifying agent in this type of movie is your own imagination?  If 
you want to see slashing and blood-black gore, get thee hence!  Rent an 80's 
flick from one of the franchises.  Because what we have here is the chance 
of a revival of suspense films that actually make you think and make 
connections.  Wow!  There is not insulting of the intelligence at the 
beginning - only a quick set-up (perhaps too quick) for characterization.  
But so many elements come across freshly because of their improvised nature. 
  Why did Spielberg put most of the "Saving Private Ryan" cast through boot 
camp-like training?  What comes across on camera is more genuine, of course. 
  Place three actors out in the woods for several days - and the length of 
their ordeal does become a wee bit tiresome - and you are bound to come up 
with an edge that can't be faked by the best actors.  When Heather glances 
at her mud-caked hands and fingernails, we see the conditions that are 
crossing the lines of human endurance.  How else could Heather seem so 
genuine in her self-filmed apology to the mothers of her crew?  This scene 
is very unflattering to Heather physically.  We see up inside her quivering 
nostrils, her dirty hair is hidden inside her ski cap, her red-rimmed eyes 
leak tears that collect on the tip of her nose.  Just a magnificent and 
naturalistic performance.
I've mentioned a few flaws along the way.  Another is that I wanted to call 
out, "What are you standing around fighting for?  Why don't you double-time 
it down any trail?  You can cover forty miles in a day if you're desperate!" 
  Yet I suppose a certain hopelessness grips them, and when they happen 
across the same log they crossed much earlier the same day, we get a sense 
that perhaps they are not just wandering foolishly in widening circles, but 
they are victims of some especially tortuous haunting.  Anyhoo, wouldn't at 
least one of the characters start praying or invoking God in this situation? 
  Josh wears a talisman around his neck - the horn that wards off evil.  
It's funny, but just as their humanity makes us wish for their safety, other 
aspects of their behavior make us not care so much for them.
Next, the hype.  I've been fascinated by the advertising of films since I 
begged my mother endlessly for a buck so I could buy a "The Sound of Music" 
coloring book!  What strikes me here is that I knew more about the mythology 
of the Blair witch than was actually contained in the picture!  Because I 
read the official web site's version, I knew the origin of the folklore - 
the pre-Colonial woman being exiled into the woods, the disappearance of 
children and the bundles of twigs clogging the lake.  But these items 
constitute a dishonest type of reverse engineering.  It's virtually 
impossible to look at the film by itself, as a result of the additional 
fictions woven about it.  At the center of this grisly bundle is a decent - 
though very consciously rough - little story.  It's a stroke of both genius 
and exploitation to surround the movie with all the other stuff, when it 
could have been included in a few more minutes of footage.  On the site you 
see photos of state cops and searches and read the stories of the agonized 
parents and the eventual release of the footage found abandoned.  Very slick 
indeed.  But it's not part of the 86-minute movie. It's just as cheesy as 
the hype surrounding any type of artist with a bloated personality cult.  
Fortunately this film, divorced from the hype, is still decent.  I don't see 
the end of this multi-faceted advertising, but only much more of it, 
especially on the Internet.
Oh, I realize the dialogue is improvised, and we never see a good deal of 
the film the actors shot.  But c'mon, do they really need to use the f-word 
so many times?  It becomes like any syllable repeated until meaningless.  
The characters' languages - body language and paralanguage - put across more 
terror than their cursing.  (At the very least, copiers of "Blair Witch" 
should attempt more colorful variations on the standard four-letter 
expletives!)
Because it's become an important part of our lore and current culture, you 
should see "The Blair Witch Project."  You've heard the thing was made for 
around $30,000, sold to Artisan Entertainment for a cool million, and has 
grossed many more millions in its first weeks of release.  If that doesn't 
impress, then the bare-bones creativity will. (And if you think hard enough, 
you begin to wonder what is really stalking the trio - something beyond 
nature or something cultish.) The viewing experience is more creepy than 
scary.  But there are also a few nicely-wrought comic bits, as when Mike 
(Mike Williams) corrects the others when they call 'The Skipper' from 
"Gilligan's Island" by the name of 'Captain.'  In all, the film is gritty 
and realistic - cinema verite to the nth degree -- and finally, enjoyably 
unsettling.


Title
Review for What Women Want (2000)
Want to be satisfied that you got your money's worth out of a movie?  The 
striking thing about Nancy Meyers' WHAT WOMEN WANT is that as a romantic 
comedy, it gets the job done.
No, it's not important or profound, and it does not even have a solid 
ending.  But for the 126-minute run of WHAT WOMEN WANT, I was entertained.
Mel Gibson is to be admired for trying his hand at so many different genres. 
  So well known for his epic revenge films BRAVEHEART and this past summer's 
THE PATRIOT, as well as for the LETHAL WEAPON series, Gibson here takes the 
chance at failing at the risky chemistry of romance.  But he does not fail.  
In its initial minutes the film does a nice job of explaining Nick Marshall 
 Gibson's character:  he's a misogynistic pig, a politically incorrect 
relic whom women find irresistible.  We discover that he was raised by a 
mother who was a showgirl in Las Vegas, and he grew up surrounded by 
situations demeaning to women.  This does not excuse his behavior as an 
adult, of course, but seems to predict a noticeable change in his sexist 
persona by picture's end.
A star at Sloan Curtis Advertising in Chicago, Nick is divorced (the small 
part of his ex played by Lauren Holly), and has a 15 year-old daughter 
(Ashley Johnson).  He's not been much of a dad, though the artifice of his 
daughter staying with him for a while sets him up finally to spend time with 
her.
What jolts him out of complacency is Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), who is 
hired by Mr. Wanamaker as the new creative director of the ad agency.  (Alan 
Alda does one of the many cameos, as Wanamaker  a wonderfully fluent 
performance.)  So the stud Marshall has to play second banana to this 
younger woman.
One of the factors responsible for the fluff factor is the premise of 
reading women's minds.  For some reason involving fate and electricity, Nick 
is electrocuted  though not fatally  and acquires this at first 
overwhelming talent.  Of course his life changes drastically, as he adjusts 
to the weirdness;  Meyers makes ingenious use of the idea, especially when 
Nick is bombarded by the inner worlds of every female he comes across, even 
the mental minutia of a French poodle!  Once he can cope, will Nick use the 
power for good or evil  or both?  It certainly does not make for a 
believable movie, but it is an interesting one, a story which would 
fascinate James Thurber or other writers preoccupied with the `war' between 
men and women.
One gripe I have is the film's over-exposure.  I have seen theatrical 
trailers at least five times in the past two months, and countless 
television ads.  A problem here is that contemporary previews give away so 
many of the best parts of the film.  What's worst is that a key word from 
the script (by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa) is actually changed  cleaned 
up, I suppose  before the clip was run on TV.  It would have been nice to 
see some more surprises among the memorable moments.
Mel Gibson is becoming very proficient at his craft.  He carries so many 
scenes here with his dogged attitude and good humor.  In scenes in which he 
clowns to a Sinatra song, flipping a fedora from his foot onto his noggin, 
Gibson is charming.  Ditto when he dances with a coat rack.  But he is still 
no Cary Grant.  Gibson's timing is good enough, though he seems uneasy in a 
few scenes.  No star is worth more than 20 million dollars a picture, so 
there is no question here, but this star does turn in a solid performance.
And so does Helen Hunt.  Although director Meyers permits the camera to 
linger a bit long on Hunt's aquiline face during her reaction shots, and the 
script gives her the word `OK' to utter too many times (as she did in AS 
GOOD AS IT GETS, in which she also dated an older man!), Hunt registers 
another reliable performance here.
A subplot with Lola (Marisa Tomei) goes just about nowhere.  It's funny that 
I did not blame Nick Marshall for leading on Lola  at the same time he was 
falling in love with Darcy.  It occurs to me now too that Nick could have 
been portrayed as more conniving as he undermined Darcy's authority in her 
new job, even stealing her ideas.  Instead, Nick comes off as a rather 
benign rascal; even his daughter's girlfriends like him after he tailors his 
behavior upon hearing their mental condemnations.
Good Christmas season fare: that's WHAT WOMEN WANT.  It's a lark and a 
laugh, nothing heavyweight  though neither is it mindless pap.  Like the 
commercialized products you see around this time of year, the film has had 
any substance removed to please the most general audience

Review for World Is Not Enough, The (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
It's hard to find a film franchise with more artifice than James Bond.  And 
what ensures the survival of this species is the natural acting of Pierce 
Brosnan.
The spy who is as ageless as Barbie finds himself the unwitting conveyor of 
a death weapon, a turnabout he finds most unsatisfying.  An oil magnate and 
friend of M - Bond's boss at British Intelligence, played by Dame Judi Dench 
- has been blown apart; what's worse, the sacred ground of MI6 headquarters 
as been desecrated.  The businessman's daughter has escaped her kidnappers 
just in time for her father's funeral.  This woman, Elektra King (Sophie 
Marceau), has inherited the fortune, and immerses herself in completing an 
oil pipeline that will span western Asia and help supply the entire Western 
world into the next century.
Our hero sets out to guard Elektra's body, as he believes a dreaded 
terrorist is back in circulation, and Elektra may be his next target.  Of 
course Bond is successful in saving her life, but then goes out on his own 
in an attempt to find the evil Renard (Robert Carlyle).  During this 
self-directed sub-mission, Bond encounters a young and brilliant scientist 
named Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards).  It is in an underground 
mission complex that Bond and Dr. Jones (catchy name, no?) fall into the 
clutches of the saggy-faced fox Renard - just another level in the game of 
following the Bond formula.  Will James even have time to get friendly with 
Christmas?
The conflict is more complicated than this, and very formulaic.  There's 
really nothing we haven't seen before.  So how does Pierce Brosnan figure?  
This man's acting is not as stylized as the acting of Sean Connery - the 
only better Bond.  But Brosnan is strong precisely because he calls little 
attention to the artifice; he simply engages in corny one-liners and then 
gets into the next action sequence.  Somehow he manages to maintain his 
dignity and wit throughout;  it's as though he tolerates the whimsical 
demands of the script, and focuses his talents on what he's good at - 
interacting with others in the cast.  No one before him has played a more 
sympathetic Bond.  Most viewers won't even get angry at him for the loose 
morals he continually displays, or for the downright tacky sexual puns.  We 
even get a tiny glimpse of vulnerability.  Once it is implied that Bond has 
lost one close to him, and at various points we are convinced by Brosnan's 
wincing that his collarbone is not fully healed from the hi-jinx near the 
start of the story.
As in any Bond installment, the women are beautiful, and Sophie Marceau is 
believable enough in the multi-faceted role she is called upon to play.  As 
the American scientist Jones, Denise Richards speaks and reacts sufficiently 
well, but gives herself away when she opens her mouth.  With the accent and 
looks of a teenager, Richards fails to create the illusion of scholarly 
wisdom and worldly sophistication needed for the role.  As Bond's superior, 
M, Judi Dench acts with understatement;  we hope to see her in more scenes 
than are usually allotted , and we are not disappointed.  We even get a peek 
at the skills that helped her gain her status.
One underutilized character is Desmond Llewelyn's Q.  He appears in only two 
scenes, showing Bond a couple of gadgets and scolding him for stealing a 
miraculous boat he was saving for his retirement.  Yes, it is suggested that 
he's going, as we meet John Cleese, that master of the cameo appearance, as 
R, Q's slightly buffoonish yet haughty replacement.
Renard does an adequate job as the main villain.  Early in the narrative we 
are treated to a holographic profile of this evil man.  What's scary is that 
he has suffered a gunshot wound to the head, the bullet lodging in his 
brain, unable to be removed.  Slowly it is killing him.  The right side of 
his face resembles melted plastic, and he sports a shaven head, which causes 
him to resemble a young Alan Arkin.  He is hateable enough, but one wishes 
for a bit more motivation, a few more explanatory tidbits from the too-slick 
script.
Robbie Coltrane does a reprise of his character from "Goldeneye," Valentin 
Zukovsky, offering a degree of comic relief, and support for Bond.
Michael Apted is a very accomplished director -- he was at the helm of 
"Nell," Gorillas in the Mist," and "A Coal Miner's Daughter," among many 
others -- and it shows in this film's pace and tone.  Apted takes risks here 
and there, but never goes too far over the top.  The chase scenes are 
plenty, and have the necessary conventions of action.  Apted is able to 
blend scenes of exposition well with the action.  His only handicap is the 
script's lack of detail;  the set-up is too fast, and we sometimes find 
ourselves wondering if we missed something.
The short review is that Apted links his scenes well, and delivers a solid 
third campaign in Brosnan's naturally suave Bond.  This whole franchise has 
always been a method of delivering sex and style, wit and chase.  Don't miss 
it if you're a fan of things Bond


Title
Review for Straight Story, The (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Looking for an action movie with lots of special effects?  Then don't look 
at "The Straight Story."  But if you're after a well-acted character study, 
a masterful collection of frame tales,  this small film will leave you well 
pleased.
Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight, a character based on the real man 
who drove his lawn tractor across Iowa and into Wisconsin in order to see 
his sick brother.  As always, Farnsworth exhibits a gentle, patient style of 
acting.  If you saw "The Natural," you may remember him as the assistant 
coach with the white mustache, who ate spaghetti with Robert Redford, 
treating him like a friend when no one else did.  Here Farnsworth shows 
quiet dignity when friends discover him on the floor of his kitchen, unable 
to get to his feet.  It turns out that Alvin has bad hips, and his daughter 
Rose (Sissy Spacek) is very worried about him.  When he discovers that his 
estranged brother Lyle has had a stroke, Alvin stubbornly makes his 
decision.  Bad hips, bad eyes, no driver's license, stiff-necked 
independence:  not many options.  No one seems to have faith in Alvin's mode 
of transportation, an ancient lawnmower tugging a makeshift plywood-covered 
trailer.  In fact, Alvin does not even reach the next town, fulfilling the 
pessimism of one of the nosey curmudgeons down at the hardware store.  But a 
friend sells him a more reliable - though still thirty year-old - John 
Deere, and he's able to resume his slow but sure journey.
What begins with a simple premise offers consummate opportunities.  This is 
a finely wrought road movie, with all kinds of stories-within-stories 
waiting to be told.  There's a pregnant runaway who receives a wiener and 
life-saving advice around Alvin's campfire.  There's a woman whose car hits 
a deer just yards in front of Alvin's motley rig - the thirteenth deer in 
seven weeks.  There are several other sidetracking tales told and heard 
along his route - one particularly wrenching one narrated by Alvin himself.  
It's the storytelling motif that makes this film hang together, with the 
implication of just how important stories are to our very lives, to our ways 
of understanding the world.
Along with the quiet ways of the wizened character actor Farnsworth, there's 
also a quietness about the movie's tone.  A few scenes we view from several 
yards away, the speakers too far to hear distinctly, and so we must rely on 
our understanding of plot, a bit of inflection thrown in.  Director David 
Lynch further uses shots that linger longer than they would in another 
filmmaker's movie.  The cuts don't come as quickly, and therefore we get a 
sense of prolonged realism, a technique that makes for solid character 
study.  Modern attention spans would not be pleased by several of these 
moments.
In a just world without politics, Richard Farnsworth would receive large 
awards for his work in "The Straight Story" - and not because it's sometimes 
deemed fashionable to send a trophy the way of a senior citizen.  In nearly 
every shot the actor acquits himself with remarkable reserve, depicting the 
determination it must take to drive across states at a speed of four miles 
an hour.  We hear stories that tell us Alvin is the father of 14 children, 
seven of whom survived childhood.  He saw combat in the Second World War.  
And now he has decided to see the brother to whom he was so close in youth.  
Each time Alvin tells his story to a curious listener along the way, we 
understand he is also preparing himself for the actual visit to Lyle, a 
piece of his life lost through anger and alcohol.  Once again, Farnsworth 
knows how to mimic the most subtle emotions, plainly plodding toward Alvin's 
crazy goal.
Sissy Spacek delivers an astounding portrayal of a mentally challenged woman 
- Rose, Alvin's daughter.  The most striking aspect of her performance is 
perhaps her awkward, halting pattern of speech, a hard-starting stutter that 
puts us in mind of a sensitive and troubled soul.  She is now her father's 
faithful housekeeper, though further into the film we discover the 
unpleasant events that shook Rose's life.  Though we see the father-daughter 
relationship only in the first third of the film, its strength sends a 
powerful message about family.
The supporting cast does a nice, natural job, interacting well with Alvin, 
in many cases showing him good deeds that he usually tries to refuse.  Jane 
Heinz is Dorothy, Alvin and Rose's neighbor; Everitt McGill is Tom the John 
Deere dealer; and many other actors play the average people occupying the 
towns through which Alvin drives.  Although his appearance is short, Harry 
Dean Stanton is perfectly cast as Lyle Straight, a man who lives in a 
ramshackle cabin in the Wisconsin country, every bit as stubborn as his 
older brother.  Stanton is one of the few actors whose craggy face matches 
Farnsworth's own.
The nature of the film calls for outdoor scenes, and clearly part of Lynch's 
agenda is to show beautiful expanses of the American Midwest.  Much of the 
landscape awes us not only with its beauty but with its size, Alvin crawling 
along a road that stretches endlessly before him.  We do get a few too many 
aerial shots of wind-blown corn fields, at times a harvester going full 
blast in the October sun.  Repetitive violin and guitar music frequently 
accompanies these scenic establishing shots.
Part of this G-rated film's attention has come from its director's 
reputation for making off-beat, often graphically violent films.  Yes, "The 
Straight Story" is a different path for David Lynch, but it shows strong 
intuition and storytelling sense.  And it's certainly a pleasure to be able 
to take every member of the family:  though you may not find this film in 
every multiplex, it is worth searching out.  You'll leave the theater with 
an encouraging vision of the real America, held together by a creaky but 
still strong backbone.


Title
Review for Ghosts of Mars (2001)
JOHN CARPTENTER'S GHOSTS OF MARS is the full title of this movie.  Including 
his name is the strategy the director has chosen to make his work into a 
sort of franchise, a recognizable player in a field cluttered with folk who 
want to make horror flicks.
Not that the guy's a sellout  Carpenter always paints with bold strokes, 
displaying sides charged with creativity, originality and technical 
risk-taking.  But this director is also not afraid to recycle every cliché 
you can name from the genres of Western, martial arts, and sci-fi films.
A favorite idea of Carpenter's  is possession.  In THE THING a creature from 
outer space, defrosted from its prison in the Antarctic ice, infects the 
scientists at a remote station.  His recent  VAMPIRES deals with vampirism 
as infection  one of the main characters slowly taken over by the force of 
the title.  The ghosts on the Red Planet appear as a storm of red dust, 
released unwittingly by a team of miners and their doctor.  Ruthlessly these 
ancient spirits seize hosts; the possessed mutilate themselves horribly, 
regard their human bodies with insane bemusement, even move strangely.  
Their purpose:  to wipe out any foreign invader of Mars, even eons after 
their own deaths.  It's hard to think of a theme more terrifying than being 
taken over against your will.  It's the reason the Borg are such good 
villains in the Star Trek series.
Carpenter's storytelling marks him as a risk-taker.  Using multiple 
flashbacks, some very short and others lengthy, he shows us what happened to 
the mining outpost in Shining Valley.  The opening of this frame tale shows 
a tribunal gathering to hear the report of Lt. Melanie Ballard (Natasha 
Henstridge).  We watch as her tale unfolds: a trip with her fellow police 
officers to bring back the dangerous felon `Desolation' Williams (Ice Cube). 
  Their commander is Helena (Pam Grier) a hard-nosed veteran who is saddled 
with one of the worst lines of dialogue: `You think you're all a bunch of 
tough hombres,' she utters to her squad as they prepare to disembark from 
the train and step into the apparently deserted mining town.  Jason Statham 
plays Jericho, the lecher with a British accent, but a good cop.  The rookie 
Bashira Kincaid (Clea DuVall) accompanies them, along with a few other 
officers.  Of course much is implied at the beginning, when Ballard tells 
about returning alone, handcuffed to the train, which arrives via automatic 
pilot.  Has every single one of her entourage perished?  Is Williams dead?  
Instead of a spoiler, this detail turns into a tantalizing lure.  Carpenter 
handles well the implications of exploring a story told by a flawed 
character.
Although the film takes a few minutes to get rolling, we are soon interested 
in the premise.  Jericho discovers the gorge in which the possessed miners 
rant.  We see tidbits of the ancient Martian culture  talismans made of 
wire, nails, scissors and other weapon-like materials, bundles of teeth and 
tissue oddly reminiscent of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  The creatures are now 
zombie-like, having displaced the personalities of the humans.  Whenever one 
of the hosts dies, by the way, we see the world in a distorted frenzy, the 
floating Martian-eye view of the hated humans, as the spirit seeks a new 
body to occupy.  The police come across several of these tortured souls in 
the concrete structures that make up the ghost town.
But the action really starts when the main body of vengeful Martians 
discovers the team.  By now a subplot has shown us the conflict with 
Williams  part of which is a contingent bent on springing him from jail.  
Of course Ballard and her officers are consumed with following their orders 
to return with Williams so that he might stand trial.  How the cops deal 
with crooks and ghosts takes up the remainder of the story.
The action scenes are very bloody and mostly well-choreographed.  One 
sequence goes over the top when the black-clad, ghost-addled bodies keep 
charging down the corridors, dropping as fast as the black-clad good guys 
can blow them away.   Hand-to-hand skirmishes are punctuated by neat series 
of kicks and other combinations.  Perhaps there is one beheading too many, 
though, particularly when you can tell the victim is a dummy.
A technique that Carpenter uses sparingly cuts from the actors and springs a 
couple of seconds forward, so we spot them a few steps ahead;  these shots 
are pure stylistic try-outs, it seems, interesting visually but without 
merit in furthering the story.
The acting is solid enough for the vehicle.  Henstridge is faced with other 
actresses who have played strong, silent heroes in modern movies, but she 
does come off well.  Her character falls just short of doing everything by 
the book.  Scenes of her hallucinating  during drug use let us glimpse her 
real self, as well as provide important foreshadowing.
Statham's character, Jericho Butler, becomes likable only after we see he is 
loyal and competent.  This strong actor gives a visceral boost to the tale.  
The rest of the cast support the story well, particularly the stunt 
man-turned-actor Richard Cetrone, who plays the leader of the zombie miners, 
dubbed `Big Daddy Mars.'  It's essentially a non-speaking role, though 
Cetrone frequently howls and chants, whipping up his frantic followers.  
I've read a few comments about Cetrone's make up:  I was reminded of an 
enraged member of the rock group KISS, his chest pierced heavily and his 
mouth drooling blood.  And I wanted to ask, `If these human bodies have been 
so beaten, (self) mutilated and otherwise drained of blood and energy, how 
can they still attack so savagely?  But that's one disbelief I must suspend.
In one over-the-top scene I had to laugh at Big Daddy's persistence, in the 
same way that I tend to laugh when I'm getting thrown around by a roller 
coaster.  Some of Carpenter's shots and lines are plainly silly and worn 
out;  even his original music is just loud and very metallic.  But I had 
fun, and that's why I go to amusement parks, and to movie theaters showing 
the work of John Carpenter.

Title
Review for Long Day Closes, The (1992)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
Visit Online Film Critics at http://www.ofcs.org
In 'The Long Day Closes' writer and director Terence Davies shows his 
virtuosity with cinematic technique - mainly poetic shots and scenes 
that bridge reality.  But he doesn't do much with plot.
There's a scene that makes us look at a still shot of a carpet for about 
two minutes, before the camera slowly pans up to frame the young star 
Bud (Leigh McCormack) gazing out the window.  At various times this 
little English boy watches the lives and fascinating actions of those 
around him.  Many times Bud hangs about the house with his mother 
(Marjorie Yates); occasionally he does chores for her, but more 
frequently he asks for money that will get him into his beloved 
'pictures.'  The one friend Bud supposedly has does not appear onscreen 
for too long.  Once, playing with another boy, he runs past Bud's house.  
In scene after scene we witness Bud's loneliness, which is tempered only 
by his good cheer - at least he is not whiny and irritating.  Davies 
portrays well the desultory underside of childhood, the long hours of 
nothing-to-do.  But is this charming randomness worth its 84-minute 
running time?
An interesting device Davies employs is voice-overs from vintage films, 
apparently dialogue that has left its mark on Bud.  In one sequence we 
watch Bud in the balcony of a wonderful movie palace, only to have the 
scene melt masterfully into the setting of a carnival, the camera 
following the young adults that draw so much of Bud's admiration.  These 
uses of cinematic references do resonate with meaning, saying a lot 
about the imagination and its power over us.  If the editing of the film 
is not tight, it does at least attempt to depict the profound 
sensibilities of a delicate and likable boy.
And Leigh McCormack is likable.  Somewhat a mama's boy at times, but not 
selfish and not gloomy:  Bud extends his hand with the rest of the boys 
at school, and takes the swats across his palm.  He does not sneak out 
of reporting to the headmaster's office when he is late one day.  When 
he is designated among the majority of the boys with head lice, Bud 
suffers through the creosote hair tonic and the tiny-toothed lice comb 
with only a grimace.  In perhaps the most adorable scene in the film, we 
watch him take part in a duet to entertain the family and gathered 
guests.  Here McCormack shows the gameness of a much older performer.  
He's able effortlessly to etch a boy sensitive and sweet, pious and 
rascally, dreamy and responsible.  
As his mother, Marjorie Yates shows a quiet mastery of character.  Most 
touching is a scene during which she sings an old air to Bud.  They are 
sitting close but not looking at each other, and the camera is as still 
as they.  After Mother mentions that this was a song her father would 
sing to her, we watch amazed as her eyes fill up with longing.  A good 
example of a small but well-directed scene.  We are also treated to 
wonderful performances by an ensemble of supporting actors - Anthony 
Watson, Nicolas Lamont, Ayse Owens, Tina Malone, Jimmy Wilde, and Robin 
Polley.
The film is set in the last days of 1955 and mostly in 1956.  (We get to 
see a curious public gathering in which neighbors cross their arms and 
link their hands, dancing and crooning a community version of 'Auld Lang 
Syne'.  Here's a nice mix of history and nostalgia.)  Complimenting a 
film that serves as a strong study of English life in the mid-fifties, 
the sets are intricate and realistic, the street vibrant with 
middle-class goings-on.  What makes Davies' vision so curious is his 
flash-forwards into what seems to be the present, the streets and Bud's 
house abandoned, wrecked by decades of rain and neglect.
Terence Davies (who directed 'The Neon Bible' a couple of years after 
'The Long Day Closes') has captured much of the down-time of childhood:  
what it is like to live in a loving family; to get left behind as your 
older brothers go off with their girlfriends; to sit for hours through 
stories that take you out of your own life, the beam of light flickering 
romantically just above your head, the darkness a close and valuable 
ally.  I borrowed the film on video from our local library, and I'm glad 
I watched it.  It sorely needs something more happening - sorry, but all 
poetic work and no play make Terence a dull boy.  But for strong acting 
and camera work, 'The Long Day Closes' should be watched and studied for 
a long time to come.


Title
Review for Bringing Out the Dead (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Martin Scorcese has never been one to avoid seamy subjects.   Like many of 
his other films, "Bringing Out the Dead" depicts some of the clearest 
glances we have seen of the grit and grief of life.  It's also very artfully 
made, replete with gutsy risks you wouldn't think would come from a veteran 
filmmaker.
Nicolas Cage plays New York City - Hell's Kitchen, specifically - paramedic 
Frank Pierce, a man in the advanced stages of burnout.  He doesn't eat much 
of anything, he drinks during his shifts, he tries half-heartedly to get 
fired.  But something gets him out on the dark streets again.
What gives the film its most recognizable structure are the three different 
partners Pierce rides with on three consecutive days.  Each of these 
coworkers deals with the job in eccentric ways;  it's Pierce that seems to 
be failing to cope successfully.  Dark flesh encircles his eyes, which stare 
out the windows of the ambulance like one witnessing an apocalypse.  It's 
clear the setting - early 1990's New York - has affected him for the worse, 
as many of the faces roaming the streets take on the aspect of a spectre, a 
girl who died during Frank's watch.  Because he can't get her off his mind, 
he shows signs of beginning to lose it.
Another unifying aspect is the man revived by Frank and his partner Larry 
(John Goodman).  Mr. Burke had been dead for several moments, but when Frank 
sees the grief caused by the loss, he appears to redouble his efforts.  The 
result, Burke is taken to Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy, the hospital where 
bedlam reigns, and kept aggressively on life support.  After Frank spends 
some time with Burke's daughter Mary (Cage's wife Patricia Arquette), he 
shows sign of an infatuation with her.  Attracted by her vulnerability - 
she's a recovering addict - Frank supports her by being there to listen.  
Will she be a focal point to cure his blurry lifestyle?  Or will the high 
rates of speed at which Frank travels finally cause an accident?
Martin Scorcese's vision of New York is one of the most fascinating takes in 
recent years.  We see it mostly during the night,  the camera going in 
constricting gyres, the traffic as well as the skyline quickening in time 
elapse.  We witness many of the same sordid scenes we saw Travis Bickle 
coursing through in "Taxi Driver," steam rising from manholes, hookers and 
other social desperadoes peopling the periphery.  In a small but powerful 
moment, Larry parks the rig on a pier and catches forty winks, while the 
insomniac Frank stares from his haunted eyes.  Shadows of raindrops on the 
ambulance windows stain Frank's face like drops of ink, or worse, blood.  An 
instant later another call sends the pair screaming off to try to save 
another life.
It's Scorcese's voice we hear as one of the dispatchers, his words crisp and 
witty;  the other  dispatcher is Queen Latifah, a cleverly done piece of 
voice acting done during radio intercourse with Frank's second partner 
Marcus (Ving Rhames).
Acting in the film is outstanding.  Cage has perfected a type of spiritual 
malaise, his voice as monotonous as his expression.  What's amazing is that 
he pulls it off and keeps our interest.  After all Frank Pierce experiences 
in these fateful three days, we are still sympathetic toward his character.
Patricia Arquette is expertly made up to look like a waif with dyed hair, 
often unkempt and always delicate.  She delivers her lines perhaps more 
naturally than any other actor in the piece.  We believe her when she talks 
of her love for her estranged and dying father, and we feel sorry for her 
when she lapses into bad habits.
Ving Rhames as Marcus plays a strange hybrid, a mix of evangelical preacher 
and honey-talking ladies' man, someone out a story by Flannery O'Connor.  
Rhames switches moods as fast as the camera switches scenes, and we are 
spellbound by both.  In one crackhouse scene we see a sequence full of 
tawdriness and redemption, as Rhames takes full advantage of his director's 
predilection for religious imagery.  Look for Irving Rhames as a nominee for 
Supporting Actor.
John Goodman is also solid as support, his Larry a jaded jerk who worries 
only about his next meal.  He's looking forward to applying for captain, so 
he can stay in the business but avoid going out on actual runs.  Goodman 
convinces us without much seeming effort - and this is good because this man 
has a tendency to carry his parts over-the-top.  Tom Sizemore deserves a 
mention as Tom Walls, an unscrupulous paramedic who is not above assaulting 
his clients.  What a remarkable and amoral man he sketches here!  Finally, 
singer Marc Anthony portrays Noel, a repeat visitor to the hellish hospital, 
a friend of Mary Burke's who manages to bring out the best and worst in 
Frank.
Martin Scorcese has set himself up as a chronicler of New York, from the 
days of stuffy conventions ("The Age of Innocence") to the graphic 
unpleasantness of "Dead."  The man deserves a lot of credit for remaining 
fresh and unconventional in his techniques.
The film is only slightly less dark than Cage's Oscar-winning vehicle 
"Leaving Las Vegas."  At 118 minutes, it seems just a bit too long, though 
that results from the loosenesss of plot.  It's a must-see for serious film 
fans, especially ones interested in a most American director.


Title
Review for Simple Plan, A (1998)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
'A Simple Plan' contains that wonderful adjective, a modifier that 
usually is what is says, simple.  But words in our language are often 
charged with connotations that have other plans.  
The opening shots establish the protagonist Hank (Bill Paxton) in the 
small Wisconsin town where he works as a bookkeeper in a grain mill.  
Hank's wife Sarah (Bridget Fonda), who shelves books in the local 
library, is pregnant with their first child.  Their love seems pure, 
their lives innocent, until one evening when Hank's brother Jacob (Billy 
Bob Thornton) visits.  Intending to place a poinsettia on their father's 
grave - cold weather notwithstanding - the brothers drive into the snowy 
country.  With them in the truck is Jacob's drinking buddy Lou (Brent 
Briscoe) and Jacob's dog.  Before long the trio find themselves in the 
woods, the dog disappeared, tensions heating up between the unemployed 
ne'er-do-well Lou and the college boy Hank.  What puts a stop to the 
tension is the discovery of a crashed plane;  Hank investigates and and 
finds a dead pilot and a large duffel full of money.  Will they keep it?  
Give it back?  Are there other choices beside these two?
Thus the scene is set for a modern allegory, perfect chances for greed 
and betrayal and treachery to take over the plot in the same way they do 
in Chaucer's 'The Pardoner's Tale.'  The fate of the money is almost 
irrelevant;  it's like Hitchcock's macguffin.  It's enough to say the 
story of three honest men who return over four million dollars is not 
worth watching for two hours.
Much of what makes the film successful is the way in which decisions 
seem to make themselves.  Almost nothing is premeditated, and no matter 
how much Hank the new father intends to remain harmless, he travels into 
deeper trouble.  Bill Paxton does a solid job transmitting the feelings 
of a likable average Joe.  We admire his humanity as he proves himself a 
warm husband and caring brother.  When his life conflicts with outside 
forces, though, Hank displays his real character.  He's a formidable 
enemy to Lou; their jealous relationship is one of the main pivots of 
the story.  "Who would you choose, if you had to," Hank questions Jacob, 
"me or Lou?"  It's clear that, when put in tight situations, Hank 
intends to emerge alive and free, and hopefully wealthy.  Key to his 
performance is the sympathy of the audience, which Paxton is able to 
engage even after Hank veers into savage behavior.
The best acting in the piece, however, is done by Billy Bob Thornton as 
big brother Jake.  Already the recipient of a Best Supporting Actor 
Award from the Online Film Critics Society, Thornton is bound to command 
other nominations and acclaim for this role.  If Bill Paxton plays  Joe 
Average, Thornton plays the subtly wise loser, a Mortimer Snerd of a 
man.  Sporting longish hair, bad teeth and duct-taped eyeglasses, Jacob 
seems a comic character tramping straight into tragedy.  And what's 
nearly ludicrous is that we remain sympathetic to his plight even after 
he too commits heinous acts.  That's the queer magic of the film -- that 
it serves as a canny study of the innocence and remorse of men after 
they've forfeited all claims to mercy.  In his expressions - the 
now-trademarked pouchy cheeks and piercing eyes, Thornton is able to 
transform Jacob into an unlucky Everyman, a big brother who is not quite 
right but who, at the same time, is wise and protective.
As Lou, Brent Briscoe does a delightful reprise of Rub, the best friend 
of Donald Sullivan, in 'Nobody's Fool.'  Lou is just a bit brighter, but 
more tragically flawed.  Briscoe plays him with a straight-forward 
presentation, and Lou comes off as a drunken dumbass, another character 
who rushes into action before he is even able to think.  In another 
supporting role, Bridget Fonda seems under-utilized as Sarah, Hank's 
wife.  Fonda is good with the deadpan seriousness of a woman not quite 
happy with her life.  She often surprises us with her suggestions;  we 
can feel Sarah's presence in Hank's actions even when she is offscreen.  
The settings of the film are functional, the wintry scenes beautiful and 
symbolic.  From the forest where the wrecked plane lies, to the 
middle-class kitchen where an ordinary couple schemes about the 
unspeakable, the locations in the film do not call undue attention.  
Likewise, music serves a fairly transparent role, at times sustaining 
suspense with a score built around stark piano chords.
The final quarter of 'A Simple Plan' does smack of contrivance, but not 
enough to impede the immensely sad narrative of greed and its 
reckonings.  Director Sam Raimi reins in his film just before it can go 
over-the-top with violence, though I would not suggest dragging along 
anyone under 16 to see it.  


Title
Review for Bowfinger (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Although Steve Martin's 'Bowfinger' is essentially a one-joke movie, it is 
very funny.  Wait a minute, maybe I should call 'Bowfinger' a film and not a 
movie
Slapstick and wit have always marked Martin's stuff.  Some of the most 
hilarious scenes in 'Roxanne' , his best movie, come from C. D.'s physical 
humor, when he defeats bullies with a tennis racket, for instance; but he 
also defeats a bully in a bar with barbs!  Steve Martin is, after all, an 
accomplished playwright.  Wasn't that a Chicago style manual we glimpsed on 
C.D.'s shelf, as he waited for Chris to come over?
'Bowfinger' gives us more of the same heady and ridiculous stuff.  One 
minute Bowfinger is tying his dog's hind  feet together, the next he's 
talking his way out of a big-time ticket by enlisting the cop and his car in 
the movie being shot.  This Bowfinger guy is charming because he's a con-man 
with a vision, a smart-ass who's sincere and dedicated to the art form he's 
been preparing for all his life.
Bowfinger is an extremely small-time producer and director.  In the opening 
scene we see snapshots and posters decorating Bowfinger's deteriorating 
house:  community theater productions and publicity stills.  What excites 
the man now is a script written in two weeks by his accountant.  It's a 
story about aliens that fall to Earth in precipitation, and it's called 
'Chubby Rain'.  There's little chance it will actually be made, except that 
Bowfinger cajoles a bunch of buddies - amateur actors, an accountant and a 
shady parking attendant - into devoting some time to the project.  When a 
producer (Robert Downey Jr.) says that he will buy 'Rain' if it stars Kit 
Ramsey, Bowfinger has his mission.  But how will he ever convince this 
action-movie superstar to star in 'Chubby'?
Ramsey is played by Eddie Murphy, and it's a superb performance.  Murphy 
plasters the character with paranoia, exaggerated fits of neuroses blended 
with the egotism of a Hollywood icon.  What fits into his condition 
perfectly is Bowfinger's outlandish idea:  his actors approach Kit Ramsey 
anywhere he happens to be, and spout their lines at him. Of course this 
subterfuge ignites Ramsey's mental imbalance with hilarious results.   
Terrified of aliens and conspiracies, Ramsey flees to his rich, gray-suited 
guru (Terence Stamp), who runs a cult called 'MindHead'.  The members of 
this organization, by the way, wear pyramidal hats and act overly calm.  
What Martin jabs at here is MindHead's apparent control over Ramsey's life;  
the suave big cheese offers Kit any services he might need to "keep it 
together," to resist the alien obsession and the urge to show "Mr. Weinie" 
to the Laker girls.  We wonder how much of Ramsey's astronomical income goes 
to the white-haired pseudo-psychologist.
By now Murphy's used to playing multiple roles, and in 'Bowfinger' he also 
portrays Kit's brother Jiff, a look-alike whose personality differs 
drastically.  His Jiff is a grinning milquetoast who sports glasses and 
braces on his teeth - a truly conventional but thoroughly funny nerd.  Why 
the need for a double for Kit?  Well, the celebrity has gone to MindHead's 
secret retreat for cases like his heavy-duty meltdown.  Because Jiff is so 
gullible, Bowfinger and his crew have him dash across an L.A. freeway, and 
he makes it, twice!  In a piece full of various takes on the motion-picture 
industry, it's Murphy who garners the best lines and scenes in 'Bowfinger'.
Steve Martin is the mind behind it all, and for most of the movie the joke 
works.  In one scene we watch Ramsey's big Mercedes chased by an old black 
Riviera, an "alien" (Jiff in a tin-foil costume!) as both cars speed in 
reverse until a police cruiser puts a stop to it.  But there are too many 
scenes that rely on the premise of Ramsey's shocked and frantic reactions to 
these filmmaker-stalkers.  As an actor, Martin is outshone only by Murphy.  
We sense Martin's long experience, timing, and subtle brilliance in every 
scene he's in.
A sublplot that does not work fully involves Heather Graham as Daisy, a 
blonde from Ohio who gets off a bus in Hollywood and asks, "Where do I go to 
be a star"?  Martin's idea of having this ingenue sleep with anyone who 
might kickstart her career is funny, but Graham seems to lack the 
calculation needed for more laughs; her sluttishness is too nonchalant.  
Christine Baranski as Carol, a stupendous over-actor, carries her role 
over-the-top.  The audience guffawed every time Carol jumped out and spewed 
her nonsense at Kit Ramsey.  I should also mention Adam Alexi-Malle as the 
accountant-turned-screenwriter Afrim.  This man is pudgy and droll and 
expert at what he does.  You will, I guarantee, lose it when Afrim does his 
bit as the cop!  Finally, Bowfinger's dog Betsy is a big help in one scene 
in particular, when the director needs the sound of high heels (which are 
attached to the pooch's front paws!) in a scene in which Kit is being 
followed through a parking garage.
I look forward to any Steve Martin offering, and 'Bowfinger' once again 
shows the intelligence and risk-taking that are now trademarks of his 
comedy.  If it's different, it's funny, Martin realizes, and this movie is 
different than most of the comedies released in the nineties.  It's smart, 
it's silly, and best of all, it will get three or four belly laughs out of 
you.

Review for Vita č bella, La (1997)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
There is a moment in 'Life is Beautiful' when the clownish Guido tells 
the girl of his dreams what they will do that evening.  He speaks as 
though reminiscing about a story that has become a perfect memory.
As the story progressed, I got the notion that I was watching a favorite 
film, one of the handful that I carry with me everywhere.  Roberto 
Benigni's 'La Vita e Bella' follows closely its early pronouncement in a 
brief voice-over:  it's a fable, perhaps sad and difficult to tell, but 
full of wonder and happiness.
Beginning in Italy in 1939, the story focuses on Guido Orefice (Benigni) 
and his exploits after he leaves the country for the city.  He travels 
with a friend who is a poet as well as an upholsterer.  Guido is a 
waiter;  he's also a solver of riddles, a supreme jokester, an 
aficionado of life.  Soon Guido happens upon Dora (Nicolletta Braschi), 
whom he dubs his "princess."  In a clever leit motif, Guido repeatedly 
surprises Dora in an astonishing variety of places and ways - he's a 
stalker, only lovestruck and hilarious.  After he wins her laughter and 
her heart, times passes and we see the couple with their child, four 
year-old Joshua.  Guido has finally realized his dream of running a 
bookshop, although the politics of the time - the early 'forties now - 
dictates his bookshop shutters be identified with "Jewish Store."  We 
catch glimpses of the happy life lived by Dora and Guido and Joshua, but 
it is not to last.
When Dora returns home one afternoon to find their villa ransacked and 
empty, the story takes a heart-breaking turn.  Guido and Joshua, along 
with Guido's uncle, have been sent to a concentration camp.  It's 
typical of the strength of Guido's love that he tries to protect his son 
from the trauma of the sudden truck- and cattle car-rides by happily 
deluding him.  Enlisting a formidable imagination and his uncle's help, 
Guido constructs an elaborate lie.  The trip is Joshua's birthday gift, 
a game during which one collects points for performing absurd and brutal 
duties.  The Nazis are "mean guys that yell";  Joshua must hide or risk 
being "eliminated" from the game;  the prize for amassing 1000 points is 
a tank, a real-life version of Joshua's favorite toy.  To complicate 
matters, Dora has desperately found her way aboard the train and into 
the camp, secluded from her male family members, of course.  In addition 
to perpetuating the myth of the game, Guido is faced with endeavoring to 
contact Dora, a feat he manages ingeniously.
To assert that the story is punctuated by comic relief would be 
irrelevant, for the film manages to sustain its humorous tone even as 
tragedy seeps into the narrative line.  Benigni's gift to the audience 
is his ability to juggle the subplots, to portray farcical elements 
often within the same sequences as sinister ones.  In one masterful 
tour-de-force, the crafty father pretends he is translating instructions 
from the camp guards to the Italian prisoners.  Eyes shifting endlessly, 
Guido improvises incredible and silly rules;  the result is his son's 
continuing belief in the protective charade.  
Benigni 's Guido is a sweet and hyperactive man, likable long before his 
character is tested by prejudice and internment.  Guido initiates 
several satirical digs at fascism, most memorably when he masquerades as 
a school inspector from Rome, charged with explaining to the school 
children the Italian claims to Aryan superiority.  Benigni is goofy and 
intelligent at once as he mumbles about racist Italian scientists, 
showing his audience of "bambini" his superior belly button and superior 
hip before the real inspector shows up and Guido goes out a window.  
Here Roberto Benigni echoes the performances of the best comedians of 
this century in their send-ups of Hitler's and Mussolini's thugs.
As Joshua, essentially the co-star of the picture, Giorgio Cantarini is 
outstanding.  What's remarkable is that he is so believeable in his 
expressions of extreme emotions.  Though assisted by Benigni's knowing 
direction, the boy's acting never seems fake-y.  One illustration occurs 
when Guido suddenly opens a bin in which Joshua has been hiding.  We see 
the wide-eyed child's look of genuine excitement, almost rowdiness, that 
precedes surprise.
Nicoletta Braschi, as Dora, seems unattainable at first - too beautiful 
and socially connected for Guido the Jewish waiter.  But we witness her 
succumb to Guido's considerable efforts, and the goodness radiates from 
her face.  Her cast of longing and love stuns the viewer in one scene, 
when Guido engineers the playing of their song - an Offenbach opera - so 
that it's audible in the women's barracks.  Her presence is heartening 
during the uncertain times of the film's setting, another goal to keep 
Guido struggling.
I've mentioned motifs already, but they warrant more.  Functioning as 
running jokes, several gags are tied in time and time again, striking 
chords that are magic as well as moving.  The sole criticism I can 
muster is that we need to see more of Dora's family's rejection of 
Guido.  After all, Guido is the interloper who literally carries Dora 
away from her husband-to-be, picking her up with his uncle's "Jewish 
horse"!  Otherwise, the dual themes of humor and menace play about the 
screen brilliantly.
Who will Roberto Benigni be compared with next, after Buster Keaton and 
Charles Chaplin?  That the film has been nominated for an Academy Award 
for Best Picture (and not merely Best Foreign Film), and Benigni for 
Best Actor, Director and Screenwriter (with Vincenzo Cerami) attests to 
its solid stance. (The film is already the recipient of the Best Foreign 
Film award from the Online Film Critics Society.) 'Life is Beautiful' 
takes risks and, unlike a lot of lesser films, earns its tears.  It is a 
must-see for all fans of movies, all devotees to human endurance, and 
all passionate lovers of this beautiful life.

Review for Trouble with Harry, The (1955)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Harry is dead, of course, is the trouble.  Leave it to Alfred
Hitchcock to structure a feature film around a minor character, the
corpse that links the plot and helps to unite two separate couples.
In the color-tinged hills outside a small New England hamlet, retired
Captain Albert Wiles (a beardless Edmund Gwen) is shooting illegally
(on "posted" land).  He fires three shots, heard by five year-old
Arnie Rogers (a pre-Beaver Jerry Mathers), who is roving around with
his toy gun.  The free-ranging narrative then has Arnie finding the
dead man lying rather neatly in a clearing.  After Arnie skedaddles,
Wiles discovers the corpse, and we witness Hitchcock's version of
mistaken identity.  Wiles thinks he killed the man.  He hides as a
series of characters happen upon Harry Worp and then depart again.
Soon a tramp wanders by.  Wiles hides and watches him steal Harry's
shoes.  Then a bookworm doctor literally stumbles over the corpse, not
even noticing.  Arnie brings back his mother (Shirley MacLaine in her
very first role).  What would be surprising in a film made by any
other director, is not surprising here.  Mrs. Rogers is glad to see
that this man, her husband, is dead.  Finally, Miss Ivy Gravely
(Mildred Natwick, the quintessential character actress of the middle
of the century) comes by.  She also ignores the gravity of a cadaver
in the midst of a countryside ablaze with fall colors.
What complicates the situation is that Miss Gravely witnesses Wiles
dragging the body toward the woods.  But the main issue is her
inviting the captain to her house for coffee and blueberry muffins.
So the body is left in the country.
In another plotline, eccentric artist Sam Marlowe (John Forsythe, one
of Hitchcock's best and most suave leading men) totes another of his
paintings to the woman who runs the town's general store, Mrs. Wiggs
(Mildred Dunnock).  Shortly, Miss Gravely stops in to stock up for her
date with Wiles.  Thereafter, the artist and Wiles meet up, and decide
to bury the body.  The killing was an accident, and no one was really
harmed, after all.  What works here is the suspended logic, a lapse
that becomes hilarious.  No one has so far been compelled to call the
police!  And when Wiles finally reasons that Harry could not have died
from one of his stray bullets, the way is opened for other suspects.
Could Miss Gravely be guilty of causing Harry's death, after she
whacked him with her cleated hiking shoe?  Or did he die of an edema
from a blow to the head inflicted by his estranged wife?
With the odd slant of its premise, "The Trouble with Harry" slightly
resembles "Arsenic and Old Lace."  As if it were a play, the film's
cast is small and its scenes occupy few locations - the hill, the
store, Jennifer Rogers' house.  The feeling is intimate and light,
even though the subject matter is grim -- hence the film's functioning
as a black comedy.  Further, Hitchcock's sense of the dramatic
surfaces through the appearance of Mrs. Wiggs' son Calvin (Royal Dano,
another amazing character actor, who is nevertheless too old to be the
offspring of the woman playing his mother).  Will Calvin, a deputy
sheriff, catch Wiles and Marlowe during one of the times they are
burying and digging up Harry?
John Forsythe takes Hitchcock's direction very well.  His manner is at
once direct and unassuming, as he meets Mrs. Rogers and proceeds to
fall in love.  Forsythe is as good as Cary Grant at playing nonchalant
and laid-back.  And Shirley MacLaine, though her hair is
unflatteringly short, is fine to watch as Mrs. Rogers.  Her lack of
concern over her husband's death, as well as her falling for Sam
Marlowe, creates the comic absurdity that enables Hitchcock's story to
succeed.
There's a very funny quote, too, though I doubt it's famous.  "He's in
the bathroom, playing with his frog."  Watch the film to find out the
ironic context.  Moreover, try to spot the portly director himself
amid these pastoral surroundings.
Hitchcock never claimed to be a creator of epics.  The nature of his
pictures, so many of them set in motion by small but momentous acts,
defies the criteria of epics.  Perhaps "The Trouble with Harry" does
not rank with his masterworks, but it surely serves as solid
entertainment, and as a model for any director who is fascinated with
making films centered around the sometimes seamy vicissitudes of life.


Title
Review for Dogme 1 - Festen (1998)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
One thing can be said about Christian Klingenfeldt - he's his own man.  
At the start of Thomas Vinterberg's 'Festen' ('The Celebration'), 
Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) is walking by himself, a country road 
stretching before him.  He has left France, where he now lives, and his 
destination is his family's estate in Denmark, the occasion his father's 
sixtieth birthday party.
Thomas Wolfe's wisdom comes to mind at some time during the narrative: 
You can't go home again.  The message Vinterberg makes clear is that 
many people would not want to go home.  In fact, Christian belongs to 
one of the more dysfunctional families in contemporary film, and the 
realism with which director and co-writer (with Mogens Rukov) Vinterberg 
portrays the ugliness is remarkable because it is engaging.
Early on we also meet Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), Christian's peculiar 
brother.  Michael thinks nothing of kicking his wife and kids out of the 
car so that he might drive Christian the rest of the way to the estate.  
Later we see Michael's shabby treatment of his wife in more detail, 
followed by mutually abusive sexual rough-housing.  This scene in 
particular demonstrates love mixed with hate, a clearly identified motif 
in the work.  Michael and Christian are not the only troubled offspring 
of the patriarch Helge Klingenfeldt.  There is their sister Helene 
(Paprika Steeen), also grown, also affected by what we discover must 
have been an unpleasant, even traumatic, childhood.  
To complicate the familial tension, Christian's twin sister has died, a 
suicide, just weeks before this reunion.  When the sister is discussed, 
we can almost feel her presence at the country house, as Christian takes 
on the role of a 'doppelganger.'  The twin has left a note for each of 
the immediate family, and after a series of secret convolutions that 
result in Christian reading the note penned for him, we witness an 
amazing display of blind determination.  Christian's mission leads him 
to make mind-numbing accusations of his wealthy and respected father.  
What's unusual is that the words come in the form of several toasts, 
delivered in a casual tone before the huge extended family.  As 
Christian's condemnation of his father is continually interrupted - once 
by Michael's beating him and tying him to a tree in the nearby forest - 
Vinterberg sketches in masterful dark comedy.
In 1995 Vinterberg allied himself with a group of directors in 
Copenhagen, starting a movement named 'Dogme 95,' the tenets of which 
promote a pure 'cinema of the moment.'  Accordingly, 'The Celebration' 
is shot on location, with no makeup, no dubbed sound, no fixed cameras, 
and virtually no 'brought in' props.  (Vinterberg published a 
'confession' in which he admits covering one window with a black drape 
to alter the light in one scene;  he also approved the construction of a 
hotel reception desk, though the materials were found on site.)  The 
product of Vinterberg's vision is shot through with a fascinating, 
naturalistic nervousness.  Yes, the film could be more cleanly edited 
and smoothly shot, but the jerkiness actually compliments the flavors of 
claustrophobia, bitterness, anger and closeness.  It's ironic that 
Vinterberg and his cohorts have preoccupied themselves with such 
standards, when the uniqueness of the photography and sets draws 
probably more attention than would any artifice.
As Christian, Ulrich Thomsen depicts a contained obsession with exposing 
his father's misdeeds.  Thomsen's strength as an actor is visible in the 
insouciance with which Christian delivers the words that damn his flesh 
and blood.  Conversely, he shows a wonderful, almost boyish relish when 
he asks one of the serving girls - Pia, a friend since childhood - to 
return to France to live with him.  It is heartening that Christian has 
survived the damaging history so coldly described by his father.  And it 
is only fitting that Christian must accuse publicly, as one-on-one he is 
incapable of confronting his father's perfect duplicity.  Henning 
Moritzen is quite good as Helge, the rich and manipulative stoic.  
Another stunning performance is turned in by Thomas Bo Larsen.  We 
despise his Michael, but cannot stop watching him as his loyalty turns 
sour and finally strong.  
Vinterberg opens another of the Klingenfeldt family's veins when 
Helene's boyfriend pulls up to the party in a taxi.  Another conflict 
arises:  he is black.  Gbatokai (played by Gbatokai Dakinah) is 
apparently an American (who understands much more Danish than he 
speaks).  The theme of brutality quickly surfaces when Michael 's 
bigotry nearly starts a fight, and later when he incites a racist song 
inside the parlor, a ditty joined in gleefully by many members of the 
family.  But Vinterberg knows that balance is often key to the worth of 
a story.  When four of the characters let down their guards during a 
wild dance, we see the possibility of redemption and love, and we hope 
the characters see it too.
Vinterberg juggles big themes here, themes with overtones of Bergman and 
even of the great Norwegian Henrik Ibsen, whose play 'Ghosts' echoes 
with the statement, 'The sins of the father are visited upon the son.'  
What we see are some ultramodern spins womped up by a combination of 
witty risks - the tour-de-force of the repeated toasts - blended with 
virtuoso cinematography.  'The Celebration' has been nominated for an 
Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.  I was surprised that so 
many English expressions turn up in the speech of the Danish characters.  
I think that Americans, at least the ones that get past the subtitles, 
will find several more reasons to like the film.  It is so refreshing to 
see a non-American point of view.  Although 'The Celebration' is as 
heavy and dark as stories get, I would recommend it as an affirmation 
both of life and of fresh approaches to filmmaking.

Review for For Love of the Game (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Sam Raimi's baseball romance "For Love of the Game" is a likable movie with 
likable stars, though I'm sure it's not the film event Universal Pictures is 
hoping it will be.
I wonder, what scenes were cut out, what expletives excised, which angered 
Kevin Costner to the extent that he is skipping the talk shows?  I'm 
curious, is all, as I am almost sure that the movie would need more than a 
little doctoring to raise it from its current B-picture status into the A 
range.
Costner here plays Billy Chapel, 19-year veteran of the Detroit Tigers, a 40 
year-old pitcher who's surely headed for the Hall of Fame.  Over the opening 
credits we watch Billy playing baseball in home movies shot in his 
childhood, many featuring his tall father teaching him the game.  (Sound 
familiar?  Think "The Natural.")  We know Billy loves the game, but he seems 
to be having problems with the other love of his life, Jane Aubrey (Kelly 
Preston), a fashion writer based in New York City.  On the day of the last 
game of the season, Billy wakes up with a hangover, only to have to chase 
Jane to Central Park and discover she is London-bound to accept a 
long-awaited editorial position.  So all throughout the last game of the 
Tigers' mediocre season - and perhaps the final game of Billy's career - he 
broods on his failed relationship with Jane.  Will he be able to climb out 
of his late-career doldrums?  Will he and Jane finally alter their 
long-distance, oft-interrupted affair?
The format of the game as framing device just does not work.  The pace of 
the extended flashbacks is just too slow, and the segments of baseball are 
just too predictable.  In a way the film sags because of another clichéd 
conceit - baseball as life.  It's appropriate that this crucial game is 
broken up by segments showing the various facets of the relationship between 
Billy and Jane;  but so many long breaks punctuating shorter baseball stints 
become tiresome.
What the film does nicely is portray a positive role model in Billy Chapel.  
Everything this guy does is exemplary, except some nasty treatment he throws 
Jane when his pitching hand is severely injured.  Sensitive, handsome:  the 
perfect catch is what Billy amounts to.  This somewhat trite 
characterization is actually pleasing to watch, considering the rotten 
apples spoiling so many contemporary stories.  And Costner is good in the 
role.  Well into his forties, he seems in good shape, and the unshakable 
subtlety he lends to the role saves many of the scenes from the flatness 
caused by the script.
As Jane, Kelly Preston delivers a nice enough performance, except that she 
too suffers from Dana Stevens' screenplay.  It's too long for one - the 
movie weighs in at two hours and seventeen minutes.  Further, many of the 
scenes build a fine tone of characterization, only to fall into flatness 
because of the ill-fated attempt to avoid cliché.  What happens is the 
hackneyed plot points are merely postponed, and events we think will happen 
end up taking a longer time to happen.  Jane, for instance, shows 
ambivalence after sleeping with Billy on the first date.  This ambivalence 
grows until we doubt the two will ever reconcile.  This delay may indeed 
result in dramatic tension, but we are simply teased too many times to care 
by the time the climax final nears.
John C. Reilly is good as the confidant - Billy Chapel's craggy-faced 
catcher.  He has a relationship with Billy similar to that between Steve 
Carlton, the Phillies ace, and his favorite ball-stopper, Tim McCarver, 
whose career spanned four decades.  Reilly's friendly Gus Osinski saves many 
scenes, and the guy plays a believable and sentimental drunk.  He could have 
conditioned more the role, though.
Another strong supporting role is turned in by Jena Malone as Jane's 
daughter Heather.  Jane is a single mom, and worries constantly about guys 
being turned off by the idea of a ready-made child (another familiar 
situation in films!).  Malone does a remarkable job in portraying Heather as 
(roughly) a 13 year-old, and then as a college student at USC.  What a gap!
The movie does take a few risks that make it better than average.  There's a 
neat motif, a sort of reverse deep focus when Billy blocks out the stadium 
noise, his "mechanism" cutting in and the crowd around him blurring into 
silence:  this is a sort of cinematic synethesia.
Not as good as the aforementioned "The Natural" or Costner's triumph, "Bull 
Durham," "For Love of the Game" takes its time for a relationship to be 
developed and thwarted many times over.  The result is a pleasant but rather 
weightless film.  What Costner should do is stop hitting with a fungo bat, 
and step up to the serious plate of an art film, an independent venture that 
would put his integrity and his career back on track

Review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)
How the Grinch Stole Christmas  (2000)
Let's face it, Ron Howard's feature film adaptation of Dr. Seuss' book HOW 
THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS cannot take the place of Chuck Jones' cartoon 
version, Boris Karloff at the helm as the narrator and Grinch.
That doesn't mean that Howard's version is not good.  It should remind us, 
however, that humans hold a jaded eye on newcomers:  you'll never be as good 
as the person you're replacing, we would like to get in someone's face and 
say  and sometimes we do.
Aside from spots of slow pacing, the 2000 HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS is 
just fine.  The good doctor's message still comes across  the Christmas 
season has become too commercialized, and what matters most is not material 
 and we're given even more whimsical lore at which to chuckle.
Word has it that Mrs. Geisel, the author's widow, was around to approve or 
nix modern tweaks on her husband's work  read, thank goodness for less 
potty humor!  The major readjustments of plot involve the Grinch's early 
years, specifically, the events that added enough bile to his personality to 
match the green fur covering his body.  Certainly another timeless message 
imparted by the story is tolerance.  When we see the new babies floating 
down to  Whoville, their pristine bassinets suspended from colorful 
umbrellas, we are struck by the infant Grinch's plight.  His cradle and 
umbrella are drab and torn, and more importantly, his appearance and manner 
are vastly different from the norm in Whoville.  Indeed, the movie tilts a 
bit heavily in the direction of correctness, though its visual richness 
coats the morals in sweetness.
The sets are among the major stars of the film.  The aerial shots of 
Whoville are stunning, the crazy cottages nestled among the snow-covered 
hills, all overlooked by the wave-like crest of Mount Crumpit  home of the 
Grinch.  The lair of this green legend is wondrous as well.  Worked up with 
contraptions worthy of Rube Goldberg, replete with Seussian silliness, the 
cave gives us lots of candy for the eyes; what's best is that the 
furnishings are grounded in dark humor, so we are not overcome by sickly 
sentiment.
Too bad the movie's slowest moments come early in the narrative, and mostly 
in the cave.  Meant surely as characterization, many minutes are filled with 
the Grinch grumping around his pad, his self-loathing as prominent as his 
loathing for the Whos who rejected him in his youth.  Speed it up, Mr. 
Howard!
I am not mentioning the star of the film until this, paragraph number seven. 
  Perhaps this is because he is overpaid for his films  a curious irony in 
this particular work.  Jim Carrey is cast perfectly in this role.  Director 
Howard seems to have set him free in a good deal of scenes, though a few of 
these should have been cut, as mentioned earlier.  Anyhow, Carrey is 
marvelously goofy in his body English, speaking perfectly in this 
quintessentially grouchy role.  I suppose I should not hold a grudge against 
actors or athletes because of how many millions they carry away: it's the 
teams and studios that are run by free agency and its cousin avarice.
Anthony Hopkins is the designated deliveryman of the British accent.  His 
voice over narration ends up sturdy but unremarkable.
The supporting cast strengthens this expanded version of the Grinch story.  
Jeffrey Tambor is always a sure character actor, and his mayor of Whoville 
is nicely haughty and short-sighted.  Christine Baranski as Martha May 
Whovier is the aging beauty who once loved the grumpy green guy.  Perhaps 
the best support is lent by Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who.  Her cuteness 
never gets in the way of her acting ability.
HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS is a good film to see during the holiday 
season.  It will also make a good addition to any collection of videos or 
DVDs.  Just remember to be tolerant, and regard the movie not as an upstart 
out to upstage the original, but as an update designed to deliver the same 
delicious message.

Review for Magnolia (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http//www.ofcs.org
A couple of times a year a film involves me so completely that I forget to 
notice things.  I stop looking for clever camera angles and listening for 
precise dialogue.  Eyes on the screen, defenses down, I hang on to question, 
predict and savor.
In "Magnolia," Paul Thomas Anderson has crafted just such a film, one that 
left me puzzled and pleased.  A social epic  -- Anderson could have borrowed 
Trollope's old title, "The Way We Live Now" - the film chronicles the lives 
of several people, tying together their existences in terrible and 
heart-rending ways.  Similar to any important film, there's a message here 
somewhere, and part of the pleasure is in figuring out how all of the pieces 
of social comment fit together.
The plot sprawls:  a result of the ensemble cast and subplots.  We follow 
the lives of several people through a remarkably short time - a very 
eventful day or so.  One character, Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), 
serves as a link between at least two of the subplots.  As such, he helps to 
unify the narrative, an important role in a big story.  Kurring answers a 
call to the apartment of an African-American woman who shouts and lies to 
him.  And this is only the first traumatic event of his shift.  Shortly 
later he comes up against a tiny and profound clown, an African-American boy 
who claims to know the perpetrator of the crime committed in the apartment;  
the boy tells it in a rap, though Kurring (and we) have a hard time 
understanding him.  There's a curious motif in Anderson's story:  it's 
sometimes hard to fathom a message even when we hear it plainly.  This 
situation is both frustrating and endearing, as we watch on to discover 
answers just as we feel mildly irked at coming up short of answers.  It's as 
if a couple of characters act as oracles in a life that is darn hard to 
predict.
Kurring later investigates noise in another apartment, and finds a young 
woman attempting to hide her cocaine sniffing.  This Claudia (Melora Walter) 
is so hopped up that a trace of comic relief seeps in as Officer Kurring 
speaks with her, wangling his way into her apartment for coffee and 
conversation, ostensibly to keep out of the rain.  Although Kurring seems 
oblivious to her state of high, he may also be exercising tact engendered by 
his compassion.  He truly seems interested in helping her.  Reilly is very 
strong in this role;  his gentleness is out of place because it is so 
striking.  The big man wears a moustache in this film, but his face is still 
a common and friendly one:  Reilly appears to be assuming in many of his 
performances a position not unlike the confidant in drama.  He's there to 
facilitate the workings of a very sophisticated plot.  Walter is also 
powerful in the part of  addict.  Hair ragged and eyes runny, she goes along 
with the cop's questions and hopes to be rid of him soon.  The rub she has 
to face is a challenging one - when he asks her on a date, hope begins to 
leak through her anguished expression.
But this is not nearly all.  Jason Robards plays Earl Partridge, a former 
television producer dying of cancer.  Confined to a hospital bed in the 
living room of his mansion, he interacts with a caregiver named Phil (Philip 
Seymour Hoffman).  Through his bouts of pain and oblivion, Partridge tells 
of his life and sources of grief;  his confession of abandoning his family 
and 14 year-old son (just as his wife was dying of cancer) does not, oddly 
enough, put us off more than a medium distance.  Robards is very convincing 
as this husk of a man, and Hoffman is even more compelling.  His is a good 
soul, accommodating the wishes of those around him in much the same way as 
Kurring the cop accommodates the common people around him, who dip and 
swerve into badness.
Julianne Moore plays Linda Partridge, the young wife of the dying man.  
What's original about her character is that her gold-digging instincts have 
left her, replaced by genuine love of Partridge; she now wishes to divest 
herself of any money she might inherit - which will be a huge sum.  Linda is 
the most foul-mouthed character in the piece, the words escaping her face 
with vicious carelessness.  Moore is the premiere actress at playing the 
big-hearted shrew.
Meanwhile, Partridge's long-estranged son, played by Tom Cruise, is now a 
cultural phenomenon.  He's the guru of a part of the men's movement gone 
haywire, the charismatic aggressor in a motivational business he calls 
"Seduce and Destroy."  Undereducated and misosgynistic, this man has taken 
the name of his dead mother's father, Frank Mackey - he so wishes to 
distance himself from father Earl.  Cruise has already been nominated for a 
Golden Globe as a best supporting actor - though it's hard to say which 
actor in the movie is not a supporting one.  Cruise's performance is nothing 
less than electrifying:  he's able to telegraph hatred and repressed 
loneliness with great clarity.  This may be his best acting yet.
Philip Baker Hall plays Jimmy Gator, the master of ceremonies of a 
long-running television quiz show that pits brilliant children against 
adults; the show is called "What Do Kids Know?"  One of Gator's problems is 
that he's suffering from both cancer and burnout, and he drinks even as he 
leaves his dressing room/office for the live show.  Hall is an accomplished 
actor, and "Magnolia" is a good vehicle for his talents:  he gets to play 
not only a fallen star, but a dysfunctional father (to Claudia) and husband 
(to Melinda Dillon's Rose Gator) as well.  Finally, this subplot includes a 
boy genius, Stanley, played by Jeremy Blackman.  This kids totes three or 
four backpacks brimming with books, without the help of his vain father, who 
alternately praises and curses Stanley from the green room.  It's 
fascinating to find out what Jeremy will do when one of the producers won't 
let him use the bathroom during the live format.
Ah, another of Anderson's themes - exploitation.  "Magnolia" gives us the 
biggest bunch of users in a long while.  One question the director/writer 
seems to be toying with is, Why are these characters behaving like this?  
Well, the very posing of this question tells us that Anderson is not out to 
take the easy way.  Instead, he probes into the backgrounds of many of his 
wandering souls, and we hear a sentiment William Faulkner would have liked: 
"We're through with the past, but the past isn't through with us."  
(Faulkner's version was, I think, "The past isn't dead; it isn't even past.) 
  Frank T. J. Mackey is so disturbed at least in part because of his 
abandonment; Stanley acts like he does because everyone seems to view him as 
a super-smart freak; William H. Macy's Donnie Smith - an adult version of 
Stanley - is looking for "a place to put his love."  All of these people 
have been neglected or abused in some way, their lives thrown into emotional 
dryness.
Perhaps the moments that will create the most buzz are the two forays into 
magical realism.  These are Anderson's real triumphs in the film - bits of 
bold risk-taking that give the piece vitality and lift it into the realm of 
fable.  It's easy to imagine, though, the conversation of viewers who will 
refuse to understand:  "What was that all about?  Did that really happen?  
That was stupid!"  These segments represent Paul Thomas Anderson's 
cleverness at using the medium for what it does best, offering a visual tone 
poem on life.  The cross-cutting among subplots is particularly well done.
Here's an objection, though.  It appears that Anderson uses the two unusual 
happenings as thematic alarms that highlight the links that tie these people 
together.  We can see them as students in the classroom of a creative ethics 
teacher, each one holding a length of yarn in a web that demonstrates what 
you do affects me, and vice versa.  This use is not problematic in itself; 
however, Anderson has also crafted a thin frame that tries to hold the whole 
picture.  The opening minutes of "Magnolia" focus on a series of bizarre 
coincidences - urban legends one might receive in junk e-mail, really.  The 
filmmaker does not need these, frankly, to get us to see the interconnected 
nature of human lives, nor to foreshadow the canted craziness of magic.
The editing, by Dylan Tichenor, does well in moving the narrative along, 
gathering its threads into a skein of recognition.  And the cinematography 
by Robert Elswit captures candid, down-to-earth angles.  Especially 
captivating are moments when we cannot hear the actors' dialogue because of 
the music - here we realize how life goes on, how every second of life is 
both precious and mundane.
"Magnolia" has so many small pleasures.  The opening credits are wonderful 
to watch on the broad screen:  we watched in a theater with stadium seating, 
the screen more than twice the width of regular ones.  The credits are also 
accompanied by lovely music, and a slightly psychedelic flavor from the late 
60's, the cast to the film slightly washed out as we see a shot of a 
magnolia flower, for instance.  I also liked Reilly's voice-over narration 
late in the film.  Mostly I found enough to intrigue me for over three hours 
- no small accomplishment for a director under 30, only a few films under 
his belt.
This is a definite R rating, not one I would drag a child to simply because 
I wanted to see it.  But its handling of complicated and crucial ideas is 
worthy of wide attention, and I expect it will be recognized at the 
ceremonies of several awards.  There have already been comparisons between 
"Magnolia" and Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" from the middle 90's.  In it 
Altman combines some of the tales of the master short storyist  Ray Carver, 
and spins some of his own.  Besides the sprawling plot and ensemble cast, it 
is difficult to compare the two films.  I'm sure Anderson considers Altman 
as one of his mentors, but "Magnolia" also has the feel of originality 
attained by a student of film who can teach us all a good deal.


Title
Review for Jakob the Liar (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
I don't get it.  Why all the comparisons between "Jakob the Liar" and "Life 
is Beautiful" when the similarities are superficial?
Benigni's "Life" is a fable full of exaggeration;  "Jakob" is a morality 
play set in a sordidly real ghetto.  Yes, both settings are Holocaust 
Europe, and each contains a child under protective secrecy.  That's about 
it.
Another "it" I don't get is why Robin Williams?  Did director Peter 
Kassovitz feel assured of success when he landed such a popular American 
actor?  Now I like Williams as a comedian, and many of his performances have 
been top-notch.  And, his face is starting to age enough to qualify as the 
mug of a real character actor.  BUT - his performance lacks either the 
scenes or the passion to qualify it as moving.
Jakob is a former maker of latkas and blintzes:  his abandoned café is now 
the basement of his living quarters.  Jakob's wife was murdered by the 
Nazis, and Jakob now works in a detail of other Polish Jews imprisoned 
within their formerly comfortable neighborhood.  When Jakob, chasing down a 
stray sheet of paper to obtain any trace of news, wanders into a forbidden 
zone, he is sent to be punished.  From a German officer's radio Jakob hears 
news of Russian troops just 400 kilometers away.  Luckily Jakob makes it out 
of the office unscathed, but has to sneak home after curfew.  It is now that 
he is obliged to care for a girl - Lina, played by Hannah Taylor-Gordon -- 
who has escaped a train headed for a concentration camp.
All these details create a grim tone, but the capacity for hope arises when 
Jakob saves his friend Kowalsky (Bob Balaban) from suicide with news of the 
Russian advance.  Is the war almost over? is the question countless people 
are soon asking Jakob.  Believing Jakob has a forbidden radio, the men of 
the ghetto are soon pestering him for the latest news - hopefully of the 
impending German defeat.  Jakob soon finds himself creating outlandish 
stories about American tanks and jazz bands, Russian divisions and planes.  
In short, he is a liar.  But doesn't spreading hope justify lying?  Not 
necessarily, Jakob sees when a neighbor perishes in his own attempt to 
spread the news he obtained through Jakob.
As you might expect, the atmosphere of the film is stark.  The set 
decoration is marvelous, suggesting the long period of desperation that 
ghetto dwellers must have experienced.  The characters are careworn, as are 
their shops and streets and infrastructure.  The viewer in turn feels a mood 
of claustrophobia and darkness, a mood very fitting for the plot.
The acting helps to make "Jakob the Liar" a solid enough story.  Alan Arkin 
plays Frankfurter, the former actor and current doubter of the value of the 
radio. As Mischa the former boxer, Liev Schreiber turns in a strong 
performance;  he sketches Mischa with a big heart but loose lips.  Michael 
Jeter (Avron) delivers his lines well, but is woefully underused, his comic 
genius not evoked once.  A similar problem surfaces with much of Williams' 
performance.  Indeed he is turned loose only once, during a scene I think is 
the film's best.  When he can no longer put Lina off about listening to the 
fictional radio, Jakob creates an amazing broadcast, followed by a 
life-affirming dance about the vacant café.  In the end, though, Williams 
seems cornered by a wrong-headed conclusion.
The crux of the problem is the commonplace.  Perhaps Peter Kassovitz failed 
to recognize the need for more scenes like the dance.  I'm not talking about 
dips into farce as we see in "Life Is Beautiful."  I mean just a few more 
scenes that would endear the characters to us to a greater degree. We see 
enough of the ordinary and bleak.  After all, the ending takes a dip into 
magical realism, but is ultimately unsupported by the elements of 
foreshadowing and fantasy that would properly ready us.  The bug is in the 
storytelling, then.
Hope is a thing worth many sacrifices, is one of the main messages we 
understand from the film.  When these souls get back to their former lives, 
it will be because they hoped they would.  It's certainly an important 
theme.  It's just not full of enough humor, even carefully-wrought dark 
humor - to make "Jakob the Liar" an important film.


Title
Review for Sleepy Hollow (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
What we experience in watching Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" is a modern 
treatment of an eighteenth-century tale.  As such, it is very slick and 
rather fast-paced.  It is not, however, anything close to Washington 
Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."
Instead of the gangly schoolmaster Icabod Crane, Johnny Depp portrays Crane 
as a mildly buffoonish constable whose ambition is to be a criminal 
investigator.  In New York City proper, he complains of the brutal and 
backward police work he sees all around him.  Thus a burgomaster (played by 
Christopher Lee) sends him up the Hudson River to a village called Sleepy 
Hollow, where three people have been murdered, their heads sliced cleanly 
off.  Arriving to a rather cold welcome, Crane begins to practice his 
version of the scientific method, exposing all the evidence he can.  
Immediately we meet four leading citizens of the town, men who may or may 
not be involved with the grisly crimes.  Michael Gambon as the rich Baltus 
Van Tassel, Richard Griffiths as Magistrate Phillipse, Ian McDiarmid as 
Doctor Lancaster, and Michael Gough as Notary Hardenbrook - these character 
actors are masterful choices of casting.  Unsavory and gruff, these titled 
citizens support one of the film's themes, that appearance is very different 
from reality.
One aspect already given away in the trailers for the film is that the 
horseman is no legend.  Differing from Irving's scenario, in which we think 
the horseman is probably Brom Bones - the jealous boyfriend of Katrina Van 
Tassel - Burton's version gives a very frightening physical incarnation to 
the specter.  When the doubting Ichabod encounters a fake horseman - Brom 
with padding and a cape - we run up against a red herring that is one of 
many flaws in the script.  But when we see the real spectral Hessian, the 
narrative abandons Irving's ideas.
Why is the ghost of a Hessian mercenary keeping the heads he lops off?  Is 
there a pattern or a reason in the selection of his victims?  Andrew Kevin 
Walker's screenplay tries to cover these possibilities, but it is only 
partly successful.  Although the ghost's motivations are conveyed rather 
clearly, we don't quite understand those of Ichabod Crane, or even of the 
young woman with whom he falls in love, Katrina Van Tassel (Christina 
Ricci).  The film begins to weave a sort of subplot consisting of a series 
of disturbing nightmares.  It seems the 7 year-old Ichabod had a beautiful 
mother who is an "innocent."  What happens with her and Crane's father 
amounts to a failed search for motives, and a third-rate attempt at 
emulating the supernatural plot threads of a director like Ingmar Bergman.  
Here, the thread unravels.
As usual, Burton's film is beautifully photographed.  The sets are 
appropriate, often painted by special effect that capture New York of 1799, 
as well as pastoral landscapes captured on canvases of that time.  As might 
be expected in a horror film, there is a lot of imagery - in this case 
involving darkness, fire, smoke and blood.  Burton displays a morbid 
penchant for showing not only on-screen decapitations, but other wounds.  We 
spy angry-looking yet bloodless wounds on a few characters' hands and 
bellies and shoulders, aside from the cauterized necks of several victims.  
Several times we witness a bizarre, womb-like image in the place from which 
the horseman springs before galloping across the western woods in the next 
murderous venture.
Johnny Depp's acting is usually solid, and here Burton's pal does a nice job 
of depicting his character.  This Crane is, like Irving's, shaky and often 
unsure of himself.  But the very nature of the newer Crane calls for an 
amount of courage the original Crane would never exhibit.  Depp's Crane is 
an aspiring pathologist who actually brings bits of dark comic relief to the 
autopsy-like procedures he practices.  His being squirted with blood becomes 
a running joke.
As Katrina Van Tassel, Christina Ricci is underused.  Her character 
increases in importance as the narrative advances, though her true role is 
kept obscured by the filmmakers.  She and her  stepmother (Miranda 
Richardson) both appear to dabble in the black arts (though Crane calls 
Katrina's magic "white").  Richardson actually plays a double role, as she 
did in "Merlin" she and her twin play interesting roles in the intrigue.  
Richardson's acting is believeable and smooth.
The supporting cast contributes much to the tone and direction of the story. 
  In an uncredited appearance as the horseman-with-a-head, Christopher 
Walken is wild-eyed and menacing, his teeth filed to devilish points.  But 
even he seems baffled in one scene, when he has no lines but must only 
breathe with hatred.  Ray Park is one of the doubles for the headless rider, 
and his fight scenes are sharp and deadly.  The accoutrements of ghostly 
murder work well in his hands:  a saber and a battleaxe were never so 
expertly wielded in a Revolutionary War-era film.
So many of the action scenes are fascinating, their ILM-buffed special 
effects amazing and transparent.  The background for these scenes is 
memorable and truly gothic - something of which Burton is no doubt proud.  
But the script falters so many times, and the main plot - though gripping - 
is not supported well either by explanations or subplots.  I question the 
need for so many graphic beheadings, and also the frequency of characters 
practicing witchcraft or magic.  Do modern audiences really require such 
dark meanderings into the subhuman parts of humanity?  Or is this what it 
looks like to see another film falling far short of greatness?


Title
Review for Iron Giant, The (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
The latest from Warner Brothers animation, "The Iron Giant", is a simply 
told fable that resonates with charm and humanity.  Based on the book "The 
Iron Man" by British poet Ted Hughes, the movie takes a new direction from 
Brad Bird, himself a former animator.  Bird's vision gives purpose and 
completeness to the movie, and the art style and direction strike the viewer 
with subdued power.
The opening shot shows Sputnik circling the Earth; the camera zeros in on 
the planet and zooms down into a storm, the title reading "Somewhere off the 
coast of Maine, 1957."  The animation style also hearkens back to decades of 
cartoons past, especially when the main character Hogarth Hughes (voiced by 
Eli Marienthal) darts into a diner where his mother Annie (Jennifer Aniston) 
waitresses.  When Hogarth's newly-caught pet squirrel escapes its box, we 
meet the beatnik-like Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr.).  Dean is a starving 
artist who runs the local scrap yard, using metal to make his outré 
sculptures.  (As in many works of literature featuring a child, Hogarth's 
father is absent, only a photo visible of him holding a pilot's helmet.  Was 
he lost in Korea or some other conflict involving the Red Menace?)
A lot is made of Cold War politics.  One of Hogarth's comic books is 
actually called "The Red Menace," and government agent Kent Mansley 
(Christopher MacDonald) exhibits paranoia inspired by the times.  What 
sparks concern around this area of Maine is a report of some sort of giant 
from outer space.  Something is taking bites out of cars and silos and 
tractors, and this something Hogarth Hughes meets when one night his mother 
works late and he roams outside.  At a power station in the woods he 
encounters an enormous metal man that snacks on girders.  The giant suddenly 
gets caught in high-tension lines and, trapped, agonizes in apparent pain 
and alarm.  Frightenend, Hogarth first runs and then circles back to shut 
off the power, a la the mouse pulling the thorn from the lion's paw.  Later 
Hogarth discovers the creation is friendly, and the two form a friendship 
that Hogarth is careful to keep unknown to his mother and the town.
Because the giant needs metal for nutrition, Hogarth helps by directing him 
to Dean's scrap yard, and it's inevitable that Dean discovers the awesome 
visitor.  Bird does a wonderful job in portraying the shocked reaction, 
which elicits laughs from the viewer.  But Agent Mansley has rented a room 
from Mrs. Hughes, and while she is working late one evening, he plays the 
noxious role of sinister surrogate father.  He will get information about 
this giant at any cost, even is he must threaten taking Hogarth away from 
his mother.  The remainder of the film follows many of the alien fables we 
have seen already.  The innocent and misunderstood outsider is hunted.  
Fortunately, "The Iron Giant" plays variations on the theme, and the 
personality of the giant makes us feel much closer to him than to many of 
the "monsters" we have previously loved.
We witness some wonderfully silly routines, as when the giant imitates a 
crazy face and wiggly fingers done by Hogarth.  The giant is mimetic by 
nature, and he seems to have amnesia:  He does not know why he crashed to 
Earth.  Some of the most captivating moments occur when this gargantuan 
being is used for extremely human purposes.  Dean has him hanging entire 
wrecked cars from the arms of a mobile, while Hogarth plays with him 
hilariously, the giant spinning like a space-age merry-go-round.  The 
humanity evinced by the Titan - especially his relationship with Hogarth and 
later with Dean - is what endears him to us.  Further, just his appearance 
is cool.  Fifty feet tall, eyes glowing and rotating, squarish jaw like 
something out of an old Bugs Bunny, the giant takes over the screen whenever 
he appears.  His voice is supplied by Vin Diesel, and it is somehow enhanced 
into a raspy sigh.  Another feature that acts as remarkable foreshadowing is 
the ability of his mechanical body to reassemble itself if the giant is 
injured.  Even better is his ability to fly, the fiery thrust coming from 
the soles of his mammoth feet.
An important dimension the story carries is anti-violence.  Because Hogarth 
is gentle with the giant, and teaches him lessons about life, the giant acts 
gently.  "Souls never die" and "Killing is bad" are among the crucial bits 
of knowledge the robot picks up.  What leads to the climax of the narrative 
is most fascinating:  We see the metal man's eyes narrow down to red and 
angry apertures when he is threatened, and we wonder what will happen if he 
does not lapse into his forgetfulness.
The script could do without occasional bad language, including several 
vulgarisms and uses of God's name.  Although there is some violence toward 
the end, I'd venture that the PG rating would change to a G without these 
unnecessary epithets.  A viewer should not expect animation of the quality 
of the latest Disney offerings, though the clear lines and retrospective 
style get the job done with solidness.  And the direction compares with that 
of the best animated movies of recent years.
Our whole family attended the film, and all of us were laughing and moved by 
turns.  I would recommend "The Iron Giant" for any audience, and for what 
it's worth, I plan to buy the video when it's released.


Title
Review for Cider House Rules, The (1999)
Yes, John Irving has his meandering plots and quirky twists - even his 
eccentric names - but he is no Charles Dickens.
There are a lot of Dickensian allusions in THE CIDER HOUSE RULES.  Dr. 
Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) and his protégé Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) 
read DAVID COPPERFIELD aloud at bedtime, to their charges in the orphanage.  
Homer also reads SKETCHES BY BOZ.  Of course there's supposed to be a 
parallel between Wells and Copperfield, the rising to manhood the stuff of 
epic and expansive story.
Somehow THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is not as wide as it tries to be.
The time, early 1940's, the war going on.  Larch is a doctor who runs a 
castle-like facility in the wilds of Maine.  It's an orphanage, maternity 
hospital, and abortion clinic under one roof.  Larch is the only doctor, 
though he has two nurses Edna (Kathy Baker) and Angela (Jane Alexander), and 
his orphan-turned-assistant Homer.  In a series of expository scenes, we 
watch women giving birth and leaving their babies, women choosing to 
terminate their pregnancies, and couples studying the young populace of St. 
Cloud's in hopes of taking home the child of their dreams.  Actually, 
director Lasse Hallstrom and novelist/screenwriter John Irving have put 
together some comfortable and endearing scenes within the walls of the old 
place.  The children sleep in attic dormers, the single beds stretching down 
the great room, and every night they listen to stories (the girls to Nurse 
Angela, the boys to Larch or Homer) and wonderfully worded prayers.  Upon 
lights out, Dr. Larch's ritual is the farewell, "Good night you princes of 
Maine, you kings of New England."  Weekly they view the movie KING KONG, the 
projector breaking down predictably.  Between the hard labors and failed 
adoptions, life is good.
Up the dirt road one day drive Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) and pregnant 
girlfriend Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), their mission to seek an 
abortion.  Wally is in the Army Air Corps, and answers Homer's questions as 
Candy recovers from the procedure.  The glimpses Homer catches of the 
outside world cause him to decide, quite on the spur of the moment, to leave 
the orphanage.  It doesn't seem to matter where he goes; Homer just wants to 
widen his vista.  Wally and Candy take him to Wally's mother's orchard, 
where Homer joins a crew of black migrant workers who sleep in the cider 
house and pick the Worthingtons' apples.  For a while Homer receives letters 
from St. Cloud's, beckoning him gently back.  But Homer stays, and after 
Wally is called to active duty, Homer proceeds to fall in love with Candy.  
When it's not apple season, Homer sleeps by himself in the cider house bunks 
- or pulls one beside his to accommodate Candy - and he also works for 
Candy's father, harvesting lobsters.  Between his shifts, Homer and Candy 
neck in the woods or in Paul's sedan parked in the lot of the drive-in 
theater, which is closed because of wartime blackouts.  Life is good.
A small caution: what follows is a spoiler, not of the climax but of a 
rising event that leads to the climax.
The problems occur at this point.  One of them concerns the pregnancy of 
Rose Rose (Erykah Badu), the victim of an incestuous union with her father, 
played by Delroy Lindo.  Mr. Rose is the crew boss of the migrants, and 
although usually very polite and dignified, he takes vehement exception to 
Homer's interest in assisting Rose.  That is, until Homer reveals his 
medical experience, including his ability to perform abortions.
Irving infuses his story with this controversial subject, having Wilbur 
Larch preach the evils of back-alley abortions (one victim of a botched 
abortion turns up at St. Cloud's only to die afterwards, of "ignorance," 
according to the doctor).  He also derides Homer for his objections to 
abortion, his argument being that as long as women will have them done 
illegally, they'd better have them done safely.  My question, why doesn't 
Irving at least objectify the topic by showing both sides?  Why don't we see 
women sobbing with guilt or breaking up with their angry boyfriends, or even 
a protestor or detective confronting the state-paid abortionist?  What the 
filmmaker is happy with is a product that smacks of pro-choice bias.  What's 
worse is the predictable outcome of Homer's caving in to the old 
rationalization that abortion is all right in cases of incest.
Will Paul return from the war?  Will Homer return to St. Cloud's, to his 
father-figure Dr. Larch and all of his adopted brothers and sisters?  These 
questions I will not spoil.
Another question: is the business surrounding the title weighty enough?  The 
short story writer Raymond Carver used to create his stories without titles. 
  Then he would listen very hard to what the story was telling him, and 
select some small phrase that would resonate with meaning.  What Irving has 
here is a cool-sounding name, but not enough earned importance behind it.  
Like much of the film, there's a false profoundness.
The film is beautifully photographed.  Maine looks stunning in the fall, and 
it seems most of the filming was in this season or in winter.  The long 
shots of lakes and wooded valleys imbue the picture with a solid and 
timeless setting.  And the many antique pieces of medical equipment are 
terrific to look at.  Especially intriguing are the newborn cradles, types 
of canvas slings, and a breathing apparatus Larch has made for a sick boy.  
We are further treated to vintage apple cider presses and other old routines 
involved in apple-picking and lobster-fishing.
Michael Caine, an Academy Award nominee for Best Supporting Actor for this 
film, does a nice job as Larch.  His style is quite natural and well-timed;  
his American accent is full of r's,  though I did pick up his Cockney accent 
on a few words.  Why didn't Hallstrom have him - or any of the other 
characters, for that matter - do a pronounced New England twang?
Tobey Maguire is the real male lead, and his performance is subtly powerful. 
  As he believes he has a heart defect, Homer tries to remain composed at 
all times, never getting too raucous.  Maguire plays cool most of the time, 
and at high points expresses his emotions with quiet facial strain.  Quite 
effective.  He is most life-like when he turns to sarcasm with Candy, as 
their illicit relationship approaches a turning point.  He is least 
life-like when the script causes him to go against the philosophy he thought 
he would embrace for life.
Charlize Theron is believable as Candy.  She is sweetly concerned with Rose 
Rose, giving her clothes and, later, counseling about her pregnancy.  Her 
boyfriend, played by Paul Rudd, gets too little screen time, but also 
delivers a likable, well-sketched character.
THE CIDER HOUSE RULES has taken its place as one of the five nominees for 
Best Picture of 1999.  Why shouldn't it win?  Not because the Academy might 
have a backroom political agenda or whim in giving it the nod for nominee, 
but because the film does not have a feeling of completeness, the feeling of 
clear direction and tight arrival that a much better-than-average film must 
have to make the cut of the final five.  The events we watch feel desultory, 
half-baked, placed in front of some very lovely backdrops and moving music.  
But this is not Dickens, and neither is it Academy Award material.

Review for Remember the Titans (2000)
The title of Boaz Yakin's film surfaces when one of the coaches tells his 
team to play hard, to make the other team never forget the night they 
scrapped with the Titans from T.C. Williams High School from Alexandria, 
Virginia.  It's an inspiring moment, as the Titans indeed come back and 
teach their opponents many lessons in the science of the gridiron.  It's not 
a very original moment, however.
The premise of the piece is a promising and even an important one.  We watch 
another episode in the long story of the integration of American schools.  
Seventeen years have passed since Brown vs. Board of Education  it's 1971  
and forced busing has a lot of parents (and in imitation of this prejudice) 
children outraged.  The film does not go into specifics; for example, we 
never discover that it was three schools (one with a largely white 
enrollment, two with largely African American enrollments) that merged.  But 
backstories stay undeveloped, and we quickly pick up on the tension caused 
by changes on the coaching staff.
Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) has come from North Carolina, and is 
installed as head coach.  Ousted from his position, Coach Yoast (Will 
Patton) says he'll move on, but changes his mind when his white players 
threaten to sit out the season.  It's a political move, we find out, and the 
school board apparently intends to reinstall Yoast as chief if Boone loses 
even one game.  So one conflict is established  the one among the coaches 
and their assistants.  (Let me inject here that I've taught high school 
myself for a number of years, and have never seen a team with only three 
assistant coaches: Boone and Yoast each have only one disciple.)
The major problems come from the racial tension at football camp.  Some of 
the best scenes hinge on Coach Boone's determination to break the barriers 
of hate separating these youths.  Outstanding in their performances are Wood 
Harris playing Julius, and Ryan Hurst playing Bertier, the All-American 
linebacker.  We know they are traveling a course that will intersect in 
friendship, but still we eat up the fights they cause and cause to stop.  
Though both actors look much too old for high schoolers, they create a level 
of believability, and they make us want to watch them in other vehicles.
It takes a good 45 minutes before we see any action in the regular season 
football games.  But by this time, the characters are well developed,  the 
conflicts clear.  Another item that diverges from the source story is that 
the Titans pushed many of their foes right off the field, blew them off the 
scoreboard.  Here most of the games are portrayed as close contests.  I was 
glad that the plot does not rely too heavily on game action;  there's enough 
of it here, but we still see the players and coaches plenty off the field.  
And they are fighting the battles of prejudice wherever they go: the players 
often trying to mediate in school fights, the coaches coping with political 
hijinks and boardroom betrayals.
Denzel Washington is one of the most reliable actors in American movies.  
What he's in will probably succeed, as he does not have much trouble taking 
on the focus of the narrative.  Though Washington still does not command the 
money taken home by white superstars, he is able to match the intensity and 
presence of anyone opposite him.  I was also glad to see Will Patton 
depicting such a multi-faceted character.  His Yoast actually grows, and we 
view him as a caring family man as well as conflicted coach.
Events late in the film tend to distract us from the story of race and 
football.  The end does not dive into downright sappiness, but the story 
veers a little and staggers on a bit too long.  The music was very engaging 
 the soundtrack will doubtless play in the living rooms of thousands of 
fans of oldies.  And about an hour into the playing time, the editing cuts 
loose into a cool triptych of montages.
On the whole, REMEMBER THE TITANS pleases fans of football and racial 
justice alike, though it fails to use fresh devices to put even more points 
up on the board.

Title
Review for Thin Red Line, The (1998)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Terrence Malik's 'The Thin Red Line' is a diatribe against war, an 
anti-violence tone poem that highlights the senselessness and insanity 
that occurs when humans insist on fighting.  It is also a very uneven 
film.
Malik's screenplay begins with two GIs walking about a scant village of 
native islanders, with whom they seem to be familiar.  The friendliness 
of Pvt. Witt (James Caviezel) is obvious in the easy way he relates to a 
woman caring for her child.  After an American patrol boat passes, we 
learn that Witt and his friend have been AWOL, actually taking a break 
from the war and living with the villagers.  Instantly we are forced to 
note the contrast between the lush  rainforest, beaches leading down to 
sparkling water, and the troop ship on which Witt is held prisoner by 
his own army.  Sgt. Edward Welch (Sean Penn) takes a sort of 
philosophical pity on Witt, however, and instead of being 
court-martialed, the young man is sent to a disciplinary unit where he 
helps care for the wounded.  It is here that Witt commences his role as 
Christ figure, a gentle soul sent along to teach others by kind acts and 
examples.  Ironic for a soldier, especially when Witt talks his way back 
into "C" Company, which is run by Welsh and captained by James Staros 
(Elias Koteas). 
The film follows this company throughout their campaign to take an 
important hill on the Pacific island of Guadalcanal in the Second World 
War.  As much as it can be categorized, the plot consists of these men's 
exploits, triumphs and deaths in their attempts to capture this 
strategic strip of land from the occupying Japanese forces.  
The history surrounding the battles around the Solomon Islands is 
non-existent; perhaps Malik can justify the paucity of military planning 
in the name of character development or even in the service of 
portraying war in its allegorical sense. But it would have been nice to 
see more than one soldier with a clipboard, and more than two scenes 
showing where these weary warriors slept or mended or spend their off 
hours.  Anyhow, Malik is not after portraying what happened throughout 
the entire offensive on Guadalcanal and Tulagi between August, 1942 and 
February, 1943.  As I stated before, his intention seems to be showing 
the grisly reality of modern combat, focusing on the devastation wreaked 
upon individual men.
A fascinating element employed by Malik is the voice-over monologues.  
First we hear Witt talking about the natives, followed by other 
characters ruminating on what's happening to their lives.  Images 
interrupt their voices, a wife swinging or a child in a field - remnants 
of real-world memories many of the men carry with them in the same way 
they carry lockets with photographs.  These sudden, almost 
expressionistic sequences serve to show the source of meaning in these 
men's lives; they add a sense of home and comfort in the chaos of battle 
and the mortal boredom of waiting to attack.  Because they are risky 
narrative devices, these mental flashbacks are to be admired.  It's when 
they go on too long that they threaten the success of the film.
A very strong aspect is the battle scenes.  Starting with the LCIs 
racing toward shore, their engines rumbling above the spirited shouts of 
the troops, Malik depicts energy and action very well.  The assault by 
Charlie Company on the hill will rank with the best and most realistic 
of filmed combat.  It contains so many dimensions of the human condition 
- courage and cowardice, ethical dilemmas and accidents, terror and 
egotism - that a review cannot do justice to its accomplishment.  Malik 
has choreographed truly realistic and horrifying work here.
A lot has been said about Malik's striking camera work, and it's clear 
why.  The settings are beautifully shot, from the hills covered with 
high grass to the green glassiness of the sea.  When Malik juxtaposes 
the war atop these images from Eden, we get a quick idea of the 
destructiveness of humankind.  Just over the ridge of five-foot grass, 
or across the clearing in the bamboo forest, there lurks a painful 
death.  One is reminded again that World War II is often glorified, its 
purpose just.  But directors like Malik and Steven Spielberg show us 
scenes just as hellish as anything set during other wars.  Occasionally, 
though, the individual daydream sequences last too long, seeming to lack 
direction and sometimes coherence.
'The Thin Red Line' is well acted.  If you are like me and do not care 
for Sean Penn, perhaps because of the reputation formed in his younger 
years, you will probably change your mind.  I saw him just recently in 
'Dead Man Walking', and was impressed by his complete assumption of the 
character.  His Sgt. Welsh is sculpted just as carefully, with searing 
stares and wrinkled, compassionate brow.  Nick Nolte, as Lt. Colonel 
Gordon Tall, hands in the other outstanding performance.  From the time 
we first see him licking the boots of his one-star general (John 
Travolta) to the time he inadvertently reveals his megalomania, Nolte 
flashes the subtle expressions, mannerisms and intonations owned by the 
very best actors.
 Several actors distinguish themselves in supporting roles.  John Cusack 
is so good that he seems underused.  Woody Harrelson sketches a mean but 
heroic Sgt. Keck in his brief role.  As Captain Staros, Elias Koteas 
assumes a gutsy, fatherly authority:  he's a lawyer turned trained 
killer, a reluctant leader with the backbone to stand up to the rants 
and ordered suicides of Col Tall.  In their cameo appearances, John 
Travolta and George Clooney struck me as so much fluff.  Like a couple 
of the precious dream shots, they call too much attention to themselves.  
I like them as actors, but why hire leading men for jobs character 
actors can do better?
It's a fair judgment that the 170-minute running time helps to cause the 
saggy narrative structure, particularly at the end.  Malik goes 
over-the-top with his poetic disgust, but his grasp for greatness puts 
within our reach a far better film than one made by a safer director 
with less vision.  I would recommend seeing this lush and memorable 
piece on the big screen if you can;  otherwise, wait until its premiere 
on commercial television.

Review for Dance with Me (1998)
Just as The Color of Money taught us the jargon of billiards, and 
Rounders instructed us in the vocabulary of poker, Dance With Me makes 
us literate in the field of Latin dancing.  It's the feel of  being 
inside this specialized community that drives the narrative of the film.
Assisted by extraordinary choreography and editing, the dance scenes 
occupy a good amount of the 126-minute running time.  Their motion and 
grace pass the time easily.  We witness first the informal abandon in 
the bar in Santiago de Cuba, the hometown of Rafael Infante (Chayanne).  
Soon afterwards, we are in a Texas dance studio, the walls mirrored, the 
floor crossed and re-crossed by dancers giving lessons or practicing for 
the big-time competitions to be held shortly in Las Vegas.  The 
competitions provide some of the most interesting and tension-filled 
moments.  Finally, the scenes shot in dance clubs, reminiscent of the 
early Cuba footage, highlight the conflict that sparks the film's 
romantic subplot.  Ruby Sinclair (Vanessa L. Williams) practices 
routines that are ostensibly Latin in design, painstaking in 
choreography - but that lack the music-driven insouciance of the real 
thing.
Williams is a remarkable dancer.  From her drills in the studio to her 
twirls before the judges, she shows off her accomplishment.  She is 
quite likable in the role, even when we discover that she is a single 
mom who is quietly determined to do what is best for her son Peter.  
This family situation is one of many cliches in the plot;  it is 
forgivable, though, because Williams acts so naturally.  Particularly 
riveting are her facial expressions as she dances:  one thinks of 
Michael Jordan,  tongue out and eyes wide, pivoting and darting with 
stunning sureness.  Williams' presence onscreen guarantees the viewer's 
interest.
Her character's relationship with Rafael builds slowly.  She picks him 
up at the bus station and takes him to the studio, which is owned by the 
man who is apparently Rafael's father.  Working as a handyman, Rafael 
slowly becomes part of the family of employees of the studio.  What 
takes Ruby a while to find out is that Rafael can dance extremely well - 
just not how she is trying to instruct him how to dance.  Perhaps 
Rafael's most charming scene has him stranded on a lawn just as the 
sprinklers activate;  here Chayanne does a hopping and stomping routine 
that nods at Gene Kelly, the simulated rain bringing out his love of 
life.  Like Williams, Chayanne does his own dancing, including the body 
language that helps to show his passion.
Kris Kristofferson plays John Burnett, who for over 20 years has run the 
studio and competed in the international competitions.  Although 
Kristofferson is not convincing as a dancer - he really dances in only 
one scene, and it's generic ballroom - he does a credible job as an 
aloof but likable aging man.  It's his situation as a sudden father, and 
Rafael's reaction to the resulting behavior, which constitutes the 
unforgivable cliché in the work.  The supporting studio dancers and 
students are quirky and well-sketched.   There's Stefano (William 
Marquez), the older instructor who plays his ego for laughs;  there's 
Lovejoy (Beth Grant), the seeming manager of the place;  and there's Bea 
(Joan Plowright), Stefano's student, who steals the camera whenever it 
is pointed at her.
Most of the picture's dialogue is believable.  Once, though, Rafael 
utters the sentiment, "I'm Cuban, of course I can dance."  And there are 
a few too-long pauses, which caused me to doubt the adage, "If you can't 
say something nice, don't say anything at all."  Sometimes it's better 
to say what regular people would say, even it's meaningless.
Why should a viewer sit through Dance With Me and maybe even rent it 
upon video's release?  Because of the acting, pleasing to look at.  
Because of the music, fast and relentless.  Most of all, because of the 
dancing, which does for the viewer what a good book does for a reader:  
transports her for a time into another, fascinating world.


Title
Review for Gladiator (2000)
Russell Crowe appeared in LA CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER, which were among 
the very best films of 1997 and 1999.  His anchor role in this year's 
GLADIATOR seals the film's place as one of the best released in the first 
half of 2000.
What's so good about this guy's acting?  Perhaps that he's rather 
unassuming; Crowe often seems to play the role of the general-turned-slave 
Maximus without effort.   He's the opposite of a showoff or a ham or an 
over-actor.  And as anyone from Laurence Olivier to John Wayne knew, 
understatement is best.  In his mid-thirties, slimmed down from his role as 
Jeffrey Wigand in THE INSIDER, Crowe inhabits his character with the proper 
authority and confidence.  Maximus is tough, muscular, and not afraid to 
fight hand-to-hand and risk dying with his men.
The film starts by chronicling the northern armies of Rome in a battle 
against a Germanic horde in 180 A.D.  In the scenes of preparation through 
the battle itself, the film engages us with the most striking battle footage 
since the first half hour of Speilberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Ancient Rome 
surely sustained massive war machines, and director Ridley Scott simulates 
them very well here.  There are the archers shooting flaming arrows;  there 
are the precursors to artillery, huge incendiary bombs launched from 
catapults, the charges exploding on impact with the trees sheltering the 
enemy.  Finally, there's the combat itself, the armored legions marching 
against the whooping middle European natives.  It does not make the best 
statements about imperialism or empire-building, but the material here does 
grip and hold our attention.  And it's all the more interesting because of 
the hand-held cameras, the choppy film speed and the wonderful graininess.  
Even when you have full color at your disposal, you don't need to use it, 
Scott is telling us wisely.
So Maximus is victorious, and he is complimented by the emperor himself, 
Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).  It's not long before this Caesar asks his 
best general what he wants; Maximus replies he wants to return to his wife 
and son, and their farm, outside of Rome.  Of course the complication is 
that the emperor, who loves Maximus as a son, offers him a form of power of 
succession.  Maximus would not be a dictator, which Marcus and previous 
Caesars have been; instead, he would serve as a sort of sergeant-at-arms for 
the Roman Empire, the administration and actual power returning to the 
Senate.  Rome would once again be the republic it was at its founding.
More intrigue surfaces when the emperor's real son and daughter enter.  We 
first see them ushered to the battle  after the death-dealing is done  in 
a luxurious coach.  Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, who believes he will be 
the next dictator.  His sister Lucilla is played by Connie Nielson;  this 
character is supposed to be the smarter of the two, the more politically 
canny and the wiser.  She had also apparently been involved with Maximus 
before his marriage to another.
It's clear that GLADIATOR will take the path of a revenge story, and the 
cause for revenge unfolds quickly.  Commodus makes sure his father's wishes 
are never formally broadcast, and commits a heinous combination of crimes: 
patricide and regicide!  Refusing to pledge loyalty to the heir, Maximus is 
sent off to be executed.  Experienced fighter that he is, he survives, 
foreshadowing the fighting he must do later  always against enemies of 
greater numbers and armament.
The main motivator for vengeance?  The ambitious and ruthless Commodus has 
Maxmimus' wife and son slaughtered -- terrorized and crucified.  By this 
time, of course, it's the audience's desire to see Commodus get his just 
deserts.  This predictability is one of the film's few flaws.
As the childish, hateful young emperor, Joaquin Phoenix is miscast.  He is 
despicable, yes, but he also seems to have to put the most effort into his 
role.  Phoenix delivers the least naturalistic, the least transparent, 
performance among the major players.
Connie Nielson as Lucilla is fascinating:  her character is perhaps the most 
complex in the film.  Where her loyalties lie is unclear for much of the 
narrative.  In one memorable scene, she tries to use her history and 
physical wiles with Maximus to get him to reveal her father's wishes.  
Nielson also plays a loving mother well.  Her son Lucius is apparently the 
male heir after Commodus.  She is extremely cautious around her brother, 
particularly in a scene in which Commodus watches the sleeping boy closely.  
Fortunately, Scott and screenwriters David Franzoni, John Logan and William 
Nicholson only imply Commodus' sexual perversion; there are no scenes 
involving sex.  Commodus' incestuous tendencies are shown more clearly with 
his sister.
Oliver Reed does a nice turn as the slave trader and gladiator trainer 
Proximo.  Reed died not long after finishing the film.  His character is 
deeply conflicted; he doesn't know whether to assist the man he has 
discovered is a general, or to make all the pieces of gold he can.  Reed is 
perfect for this role, the sinews on his thick neck standing out with age, 
the cadences of his British accent mixing well with the accent assumed by 
Crowe.
Another strong supporting actor is Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus.  He 
looks a little too gentle and wise to be involved with such dark politics; 
nevertheless, Jacobi's manner gets us quickly aligned with his cause, which 
is the same cause Maximus is willing to die for.
Djimon Hounsou is nicely cast as a captured slave, one who offers kindness 
to the wounded general  or the `Spaniard,' as Maximus is known among the 
gladiators he trains and fights among.  Hounsou shades his portrayal with a 
natural friendliness.
Special effects are stunning in GLADIATOR.        We view them mainly in the scenes 
showing ancient Rome, the immense and pillared structure, the impressive 
statuary, the painstakingly recreated Old World flavor of a living city.  
Recent speculation about the Coliseum, for instance, has made it into this 
film: historians believe long poles depended from the top, and from these 
poles hung sail-like awning, the closest thing to a retractable partial-roof 
of its time.  Wonderful details confront us: it would take more than one 
viewing to notice everything.  The only reservation I have about large scale 
backgrounds like the ones here is that they sometimes appear ultra-real, 
almost plastic  too-clear video images in a feature film.  It's better 
they're here, though.
Other special effects are employed in sequences that simulate dreams.  The 
initial image starting the film shows a warrior's hand skimming the tops of 
wheat stalks, and later we see definite imagery of death as Maximus dreams 
of meeting his son and wife in the Elysian fields.  We even notice some 
early Christian references.  Although the gods are mentioned, we hear 
Maximus praying to "Blessed Mother' and `Father.'  And he meditates with 
small statues of his wife and child.  It's easy to see how Christianity was 
developing at the time this story takes place; Scott is to be commended for 
showing the spirituality of some of his main characters.
Music by Lisa Gerrard (from the group Dead Can Dance) and well-known 
Hollywood score master Hans Zimmer is smooth and haunting.  Gerrard's voice 
sounds like it's from the Middle East, assisted by ancient instruments.  The 
CD would be a good investment.
The film is rated R for graphic violence.  I counted only one vile word, 
which could find its way into PG-13 rated fare.  GLADIATOR would be fine for 
those 15 and up.  The violent scenes are not tame, but neither are they done 
in a way that glorifies violence.

Review for Buena Vista Social Club (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
In "Buena Vista Social Club," Wim Wenders has made another important film.  
This story follows a group of aging Cuban musicians from their neighborhoods 
in Cuba to various concerts across the world, and finally to Carnegie Hall.  
It is a documentation of guitarist Ry Cooder's journey to Cuba to preserve a 
vanishing music, and the culture behind it.  As such, "Buena Vista Social 
Club" serves one of the more noble functions of documentary films.
The most watchable dimension of the film is the music.  Anyone would want to 
own the soundtrack of this film.  Hearing the guitar of 90 year-old Compay 
Segundo, the piano of 80 year-old Ruben Gonzalez, and the voice of 70 
year-old Ibrahim Ferrer, we know the reason behind making the film.  These 
legends of Cuban music should not fade.  And when we have the opportunity to 
watch their movements and expressions as they perform, we know we are 
witnessing history.  Wenders and director of photography Jorg Widmer use 
overlapping music to seamless and astonishing effect:  many times we listen 
to an artist's performance, and then fade into an interview featuring his or 
her views on music, or Cuba, or the world.
Interviews are extensive and crucial to the narrative.  Especially 
interesting are the views of Ibrahim Ferrer, who sports a thin goatee and 
cap, and brings us into his apartment.  He speaks of various inspirations, 
and we sense the hardships he's experienced - enough to make him retire from 
singing so he might shine shoes - before his resurrection through this 
project.  Near the end, Ferrer's observations on New York are touching;  the 
man's consideration of others, his lack of arrogance, his suave singing 
voice - these make him the leading man of the movie.  Others are almost as 
interesting.  Mr. Segundo tells of being five years old and lighting his 
grandmother's cigars.  (He confesses to having smoked for 85 years!)  We are 
also treated to the words of Ruben Gonzalez, who was able to record his 
first solo album at age 77.  There's an irresistible scene in which Mr. 
Gonzalez plays his piano for a group of small girls in a huge Havana dance 
studio.
Through seeing the decaying infrastructure and transportation of Cuba, we 
conceive a better understanding of the conditions of its people.  Hence we 
better comprehend what these musicians have survived, what obstacles they 
have  faced, in order to keep their music alive.  It's worth commenting that 
not once do we hear a bitter comment about the political situations 
responsible for the crumbling buildings surrounding these vibrant people.
Mixing clever storytelling techniques - like a series of nifty "steadicam" 
shots that encircle the musicians - with implicit awe for these special 
styles of music, "Buena Vista Social Club" stands out as a non-fiction film. 
  In short, it makes the viewer want to visit Cuba hoping that maybe, just 
maybe a place like the Buena Vista Social Club still exists.


Title
Review for Man on the Moon (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
If you are old enough to remember watching Andy Kaufman on television, you 
will have the feeling you are seeing him again in Milos Forman's "Man on the 
Moon."  If you are too young to have seen Kaufman, I'd be interested in 
hearing if you had a hard time seeing Jim Carrey in there.
Carrey has gotten some press for taking method acting to its limits.  
Apparently, on the set of this film, he often stayed inside his character's 
head while the camera was not running.  According to the film, this was a 
habit of Kaufman's - keeping the switch "on" even among friends and 
relatives.  These quirks obviously helped Carrey capture verisimilitude:  in 
appearance, gesticulations,  tone of voice - in all aspects save physical 
stature (I get the idea Carrey is taller and thinner than Kaufman) - the man 
pulls off an astounding impersonation.  Through the bug-eyed, goofy visage, 
the longish, fluffy hair and sideburns, the articulate politeness sometimes 
practiced by class clowns, Carrey captures much of the persona of one of the 
more colorful figures of the early 1980's.
Forman starts the piece with an offbeat quasi-monologue in which Kaufman 
tells us, using the voice of "Foreign Man," that the movie about his life is 
bad, and has been cut so short that it is over already.  Then we fall into a 
sequence showing a young Andy (Bobby Boriello) M. C.-ing an imaginary 
television show.  His father tells him that there's no camera in the bedroom 
wall, that what Andy needs is an audience.  Herein lies the key to Kaufman's 
showing off: if no one is there to watch, it doesn't happen.  The movie 
traces Kaufman's development as a live performer, focusing on the lack of 
understanding and support for what is now called performance art.  We do not 
see much biographical focus, as we meet the comic artist's parents and 
sister only briefly, seeing the parents at their son's various appearances 
but never watching their characters explored.
So many parts of this "biopic" are easy to watch because they are already 
familiar.  We know Lorne Michaels, and recognize him and many others playing 
themselves.  Michaels is deadpan as he watches Kaufman introduced as 
'Saturday Night Live's" musical guest;  following is Kaufman's famous though 
brief lip-sync of the "Mighty Mouse" theme.  In part Kaufman's style  was 
reactionary, even confrontational, as he decides to punish a college 
audience by carrying out what seems to be "Plan B," reading "The Great 
Gatsby" in its entirety, while most of the audience leaves. We recognize 
most acutely his tussles with professional wrestler Jerry Lawler (playing 
himself as well).  As David Letterman tries to promote peace, Kaufman jumps 
up and curses at Lawler;  the wrestler responds with a very realistic slap 
that floors Kaufman and sends him into on-the-air, profane fury. The rub 
here is obvious:  is Kaufman serious, or is he engaging in the inflammatory 
posturing that wrestlers have acted out for decades?
The film reaches its most interesting moments when this question comes up.  
And the film is often interesting.  Carrey and his director, Forman, develop 
the artist as a lovable person who is next to impossible to work with.  
Always obnoxious when he didn't get his way, always looking for a grander, 
more self-reflexive ruse, Kaufman cared more about creativity than he did 
about social politeness.  At times the film is hard to watch because it 
makes us think about the consequences of what seem to be Kaufman's 
ill-considered actions.  He taunts a Memphis audience heartlessly, and 
toward the end, a "Saturday Night Live" poll shows a vote to ban him from 
the show.  Multi-faceted he surely is, and Carrey loses himself in the role.
As Andy Kaufman's friend and producer, Bob Zmuda, Paul Giamatti acts with 
sharp intelligence.  We first meet him during a run-in with Kaufman's alter 
ego, the villainous, hateful, non-talented lounge lizard Tony Clifton.  
Clifton pours a glass of water over the head of an audience member - Zmuda 
as a plant - and we can see Kaufman's in-your-face brilliance.  Zmuda seems 
to be the one who knows Andy the best - although we don't see anything of 
how their friendship developed.  But even Zmuda is unable to read Andy at 
times.
Courtney Love plays Lynne Margulies, Kaufman's girlfriend.  It seems they 
meet when, on the "Merv Griffin Show," he offers a challenge to wrestle any 
woman who thinks she can pin him.  With Merv innocently shrugging his 
shoulders, and with Zmuda as referee, Kaufman proceeds to humiliate her, 
inviting the wrath of the audience.  But backstage he is surprised this 
woman took him seriously.  Later we ponder the same question about reality 
when Lawler slams Kaufman's inert body to the canvas.  Is it real?  Should 
we be worried about Andy or angry at him for deceiving us?  Can deception be 
entertainment?  Love has grown into a natural actress, and although Lynne's 
relationship with Kaufman could be given more coverage, she draws our regard 
and pity.
Danny DeVito - a Kaufman friend and fellow "Taxi" cast member - supplies the 
main link between parts of the story.  A smooth actor, DeVito knows when to 
turn on which emotion.  He does well in showing a frank ambivalence toward 
Kaufman's wildness.  A good agent, he  gets Kaufman to accept the sitcom 
"Taxi" with the intimidating quip that an opportunity like this would never, 
never surface again if Kaufman turned it down.  He also humors the moody 
artist numerous times, smoothing out disagreements with network executives.  
DeVito's performance is strong enough to warrant nominations for major 
awards.
Milos Forman paces the film well;  there are lots of different levels of 
action happening:  we switch from Kaufman's personal life to his onstage 
personas.  A compliment should go to this director for not becoming too 
heavy-handed in portraying a search for selfhood or clear identity.  These 
themes he explores obliquely - the best way they could be explored.
So much of the film seems to have written itself.  There are the 
controversies, the comic routines, the delving deep into the interactive 
side of behavioral science;  but there's a story we don't know much about 
until the movie tells us.
After Kaufman contracted lung cancer, many of his friends, and apparently 
even some of his family, thought it was another put-on.  The ultimate irony 
here is that, at some point in the film, Kaufman does mention faking his 
death.  And after we watch his dead-on Elvis impersonation - one of the 
earliest and best - we too wonder if we are being put-on.  That's the charm 
of the film, it sketches a clear picture of Andy Kaufman but never captures 
him completely in focus.  There's always some movement of his causing a blur 
in our understanding.  The person most responsible for creating these 
illusions is Jim Carrey, and based on his performance in this picture alone, 
he gets my vote for this year's best actor.

Review for Tumbleweeds (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Gavin O'Connor's "Tumbleweeds" is a tour-de-force of character study, a 
narrative whose whirlwind plot whips up our interest only to let us down 
gently in the end.
The opening scene jolts us with a fight between Mary Jo Walker (Janet 
McTeer) and her latest husband.  The vehemence of the quarrel makes us 
wonder why the movie has only a PG-13 rating.  (There's a love scene later 
that sets us wondering, too.)  But we are quickly convinced that Mary Jo is 
right to get her daughter Ava (Kimberly Brown) out of there - away from this 
abusive stepfather.  The mother and daughter pair sets off in on old 
Pontiac, leaving North Carolina and heading west towell, they don't know 
where.
That's one of the best qualities about the movie, its whimsicality.  This 
spontaneous mother, who does not get upset at things that would make normal 
mothers livid, carries much of the movie with her eccentricities.  We enjoy 
watching her lack of vexation when the car breaks down - inevitably - on a 
remote highway somewhere in the dusty middle of the country.  When a trucker 
stops to help, Mary Jo looks over his body as he looks under her hood;  
meanwhile, Ava, a little girl wise beyond her years, pouts about her 
mother's flirting.  For a long while "Tumbleweeds" acts like a road movie, 
as the two decide where they might end up on their flight away from the last 
abusive man.  We know, by the way, that Mary Jo has been married four times; 
  what's at least a little puzzling is that she has not been put off 
starting new relationships almost the hour the old ones are sunk.  So when 
the pair settles in the "Pink Motel" not far from the Pacific Ocean, we 
think their lives will be calmer.
Big mistake.  Her feelers out for a relationship, Mary Jo actually spots the 
helpful trucker - Jack, played by director Gavin O'Connor - in a bar.  They 
begin a romping romance while Ava is at a sleepover at a new friend's house. 
  The scene in which the girl returns home prematurely reveals a great deal, 
actually, about Jack.  Predictably, this young man ends up not quite meeting 
the expectations of this impulsive womanand vice versa.  Not even Mary Jo's 
job is stable, as she is subjected to harassment and whining by her boss 
boss, a despicable homunculus.  Throughout her strife, the anchor in her 
life is Ava, the girl she named after the glamorous Ava Gardner.
And the chemistry between them is very watchable.  We can imagine O'Connor 
in many scenes just turning McTeer loose, her southern drawl and her lack of 
inhibitions on full throttle.  Several episodes are shot seemingly without 
script, improvisations that show the strength of the mother-daughter bond.  
McTeer is at her best when she gets fully into the skin of this promiscuous, 
rather permissive mom.  It's the incongruity of her behavior that engages 
and mildly shocks us.  At the foundation of her character is sadness, 
though, as we discover when a co-worker friend of Mary Jo's asks her "Why 
are you going to Arizona?   Tell me." again and again.  We feel a subtle but 
powerful impact when the script commences to dig into Mary Jo's psychology.  
Even Ava deserts her at one point.  We begin to ponder, not for the first 
time, if Mary Jo isn't a terribly bad example, though we probably excuse her 
stupidity when we remember her affection for the girl.
Kimberly Brown is quite a find.  Her accent is also markedly Southern, her 
manner often more mature than her mom's.  Her Ava handles the tension 
between her mother and various father figures quite well, not wholly 
succumbing to the conventional pouting and sullenness of children in similar 
fixes.
Gavin O'Connor acts naturally as Jack the trucker/jerk.  He's a little too 
young for Mary Jo, however, and the script causes him to reveal vital 
information - like an accident and a job loss -- a little later than he 
should.
Another male, a co-worker named Dan (Jay O. Sanders), gets along famously 
with the aspiring actress Ava.  Sanders does a modest and strong job as Dan 
Miller, though the script handicaps him by positioning him as the knight in 
emotional armor:  he's single, having lost his wife in a car accident that 
he apparently caused.  Further, Dan is conveniently available when Mary Jo 
drops Jack.  Sound like a few too many clichés?
A lot of things are nicely realistic about "Tumbleweeds."   The characters' 
lives unfold realistically, albeit a bit dramatically.  But larger than life 
is how most of us like our characters, and Janet McTeer's Mary Jo is a 
bundle of likable contradictions.  "Tumbleweeds" doesn't quite know where to 
go in its final moments, though unlike many films, it does not wander off 
and die.

Review for Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, A (1998)
A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries (1998)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
The latest collaboration of James Ivory, Ismail Merchant and Ruth Prawer 
Jhabvala is 'A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.'  Following the life of 
an American girl and her family living in Paris and later on Long 
Island, the film explores many of the sweet and sour moments of growing 
up.  It also convincingly depicts the bonds that glue together these 
lively Americans, though it reaches an ending that is flat and 
under-realized.
Because of his tough-guy reputation, one wouldn't think the American 
novelist James Jones (1921-77) would be a devoted husband and wise 
father.  If the real Jones resembled Bill Willis in Kaylie Jones' novel 
'A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,' then indeed he was a breaker of 
stereotypes.  Kris Kristofferson, who plays Bill Willis, paints his 
character with gruff but sweet strokes, and what comes across is a 
family man who will go to any lengths to protect his children and ensure 
their happiness.  Most viewers would agree he is a bit too liberal, 
encouraging his daughter and her current beau to sleep together in her 
bedroom, so at least they will not be doing it in cars.  Kristofferson 
hands in one of the strongest acting jobs in the film, with his 
straight-on approach and easy relationships with others in the cast.
And a strong ensemble it is, too.  Willis and his wife Marcella (Barbara 
Hershey) have a daughter Charlotte "Channe" (Luisa Conlon as a child, 
and as a teen, Leelee Sobieski), a child much adored by her French nanny 
Candida (Dominique Blanc).  James Jones saw action in the Pacific 
theater in World War 2, and was part of a second, post-war wave of 
American expatriates living in Paris.  Daughter Kaylie doubtless writes 
about herself in Channe, a girl much loved by her prosperous parents.  
The girl's world is at least mildly upset by the arrival of a boy from 
an orphanage, Benoit (Samuel Gruen and, later, Jesse Bradford).  Benoit 
soon adopts "Billy" after his new American dad, and we see several 
escapades starring Billy and Channe in which they grow close as brother 
and sister.  In one touching scene, young Channe invites Billy to sleep 
with her, as his bed is wet.  Gratefully he gathers his suitcase, which 
he carries everywhere in anticipation of another displacement, and 
follows his strange blond sister.
Once we know the characters and their situation, a three-part 
storytelling structure begins with the name "Billy" across the screen.  
His character is developed well in this segment, partly through his 
relationship with mother Marcella.  Hershey plays a rabidly protective 
mother who throws sand in the face of a teacher who has been confining 
Billy to the coat closet.  She loves Billy unconditionally and tells him 
frequently, most movingly when he expresses a type of survivor's guilt 
after Marcella has a miscarriage.  But the character to whom he relates 
the most is Channe, who seems to be the post to which the other 
characters are tethered.  Relationships in the story appear to go 
against type - there are a lot a group hugs going on - but the lack of 
dysfunction does not draw doubt from the viewer, and this is quite a 
feat of the depiction of sincerity.
'Francis' is the second name heading: Francis Fortesque, he of the 
brilliant ability and eccentric taste.  Think of child confidantes like 
Dill from 'To Kill a Mockingbird', or the little country boy from 'My 
Father's Glory'.  He's a good foil to Channe, drawing some of the 
negative attention away from her and even from Billy, who are having 
tough times adjusting to their new school.  Anthony Roth Costanzo lets 
himself loose as Francis, a boy nurtured by his mother but misunderstood 
by his peers - except the Willises.  Costanzo's performance is the 
centerpiece of the second narrative segment, though it falls off (along 
with the beloved presence of Candida) when the Willis family returns to 
the States.
'Daddy' is the third segment.  Because of a heart condition, Willis 
wants to be under the care of American doctors, and wishes his children 
to know more of their American roots (instead of becoming "Euro-trash 
brats" like many of their friends' children).  The film falls off a bit 
in its magnetic narration, perhaps because the family now lives in rural 
Long Island instead of a diverse European culture-haven.  But Bill 
Willis' relationship with Channe takes center stage, as he gives life 
lessons and directions for handling matters after his heart does him in.
Leelee Sobieski sports an uncanny resemblance to Helen Hunt as a 
teenager, tall and blond and willowy, eyes often partially shut in her 
insouciant manner.  Sobieski does nicely in portraying the conflicts, 
awkwardness and joy of adolescence.
The last minutes of the film stop the gradual momentum of the entire 
story.  I have not read the autobiographical novel, so I don't know 
about its end.  But director James Ivory seems to be missing an action 
to trigger the resonance he is after.
The film did not see wide distribution in the midwestern United States, 
an indicator that it is a "small" film.  Aside from the flatness of its 
conclusion, 'A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries' features a very likable 
and functional family growing together through the 1960s and '70s.  I 
would bring it home on video and enjoy it, although not with the entire 
family, as its language and sexual references label it with a big 'R'.

Review for Air Bud (1997)
This summer has not offered the goods to kids under 13 or parents who 
enforce the ratings system.  For example, I couldn't take my 10 year-old 
daughter to DOCTOR DOLITTLE because of its PG-13 status.
But we went today to AIR BUD:  GOLDEN RECEIVER, a rather unwieldy title 
but a decent film for kids.  And only the second theatrical release this 
summer, I believe, rated G.  (MULAN is the other.)
The sequel to last year's AIR BUD, this film expands upon the premise of 
a dog's prowess at basketball.  With a quick opening that does its job - 
moving fast and reinforcing Bud's craftiness and basketball expertise --  
the story unfolds easily and reintroduces us to Josh Framm (Kevin 
Zegers), now an eighth grader, and his mother Jackie (Cynthia 
Stevenson).  After a series of events that complicate the plot, we 
discover the family dog's amazing skill at catching a football.
The football motif is corny and fun;  it makes the viewer remember the 
type of film she is watching.  This is a kids' movie, and it's all right 
that a dog catches passes and eludes tacklers.  It's even all right that 
there is no objection whatever that Bud dresses in a cute quasi-uniform 
and scores touchdowns against other eighth-grades football teams.
The complications are what doesn't work so well.  
First, Gregory Harrison plays Patrick Sullivan, a handsome veterinarian 
who cares for Bud.  It's refreshing, by the way, that Bud likes him back 
- a turnaround from many family pets' uncanny instincts and hatred of a 
human character.  It's Josh who feels threatened when Patrick begins to 
date his mother.  Even though Josh is himself a personable adolescent 
and not an obnoxious stereotype of a teenager, he shows a sulking 
attitude when Patrick and Jackie grow close.  Why would a smart and 
supportive father figure turn off a boy like Josh?  Are a couple of 
shots of  Josh's deceased test-pilot father enough to make us believe 
Josh's motivation to act like he does?
Another subplot involves a sinister but comic Russian duo, played by 
Nora Dunn and Perry Anzilotti.  Their motive is greed when they set out 
to complete their circus of stolen animals with unique talents.  Dunn 
and Anzilotti prove solid caricature actors as they pursue Bud.  Their 
schemes and fates provide quite a few chuckles when the subplot surfaces 
now and again.  What is missing is the connective tissue.  In the first 
BUD, Josh came in contact with the baddie, who was the dog's original 
owner.  Here, however, the Framm family never even sees the Boris and 
Natasha clones.  Yes, the slapstick adds another funny dimension to the 
story, but by the end we feel as if an alarm were set but failed to go 
off.  Too many details, including a threat to fire the lovable football 
coach, come to naught.
Cynthia Stevenson turns in a credible performance as Jackie.  She brings 
a mousy, compassionate quality to Josh's mother.  The film, with its 
general audience rating, does not show much intimacy between Jackie and 
Patrick, but the actors convince us that a happy ending is possible.  As 
I stated before, it's the relationship between Josh and Patrick that is 
oddly bloodless.
The animal training deserves some mention.  Four big, feathery dogs were 
used to portray Bud, and the editing is slick and watchable.  Somehow 
this dog manages to catch everything thrown his way.  Even though we can 
tell the pigskin is half-inflated, the effect is cute.  And the pooch's 
uniform is precious:  white-painted, ancient leather helmet, smallish 
shoulder pads that make him look half bulldog, and blue jersey featuring 
"K 9."
The film gave me a few belly laughs, which is a sort of litmus test I 
apply to comedies.  Even though AIR BUD:  GOLDEN RECEIVER is a B-film, 
it appeals to a G audience.  That and the laughter it provides are 
enough to earn our money at the box office.


Title
Review for Galaxy Quest (1999)
It's a nice tradition that we have on Christmas Day - seeing a movie.  Last 
year it was the hilarious Irish comedy "Waking Ned Devine."  This year we 
took the kids to "Galay Quest."
If you have heard good reviews about this film, believe them.  Even after 
all of the television series and movies about spaceships and militaristic 
goings-on  in space - and especially after the parodies poking fun at this 
fare - "Galaxy Quest" handles itself with originality.
The film takes off on the groundbreaker of them all, "Star Trek."  The cast 
of the fictional television show "Galaxy Quest" now appears at conventions, 
where ardent fans - many of whom dress up to emulate their favorite 
characters - gather and exchange ideas and spend money.  Tim Allen plays the 
commander of the ship - the William Shatner character.  Allen's name is 
Jason Nesmith, the actor who portrays Commander Peter Quincy Taggart.  
Eighteen years after the show's cancellation, Nesmith is still making money 
from these conventions.  It seems like the entire cast also enjoy the 
benefits of their former stardom.  These players include Sigourney Weaver as 
actress Gwen DeMarco, who plays Lt. Tawny Madison.  Her main role in the 
show, back in the 'seventies and early 'eighties, was to show cleavage, 
along with repeating the computer's pronouncements.  A pretty face.  Tony 
Shalhoub plays Tommy Webber/Tech. Sgt. Chen.  Daryll Mitchell plays Lt. 
Laredo (he was a child when the show was on the air).  Alan Rickman plays 
Alexander Dane/Dr. Lazarus, and Sam Rockwell plays Crewman #6 in Episode 81. 
  Well, all of these second-rate actors seem to be eking out a living from 
their long-past celebrity.  And they are all fairly disillusioned and bored.
That is, until Nesmith convinces them to go on what they think is a paying 
gig.  They believe these fans dressed as aliens are taking them to another 
guest appearance, so they might hawk autographs and field questions from 
obsessive fans;  quickly they discover their sponsors are actual aliens, a 
race that has studied the television show, believing it to be "historical 
documents."  Ergo, the aliens have constructed virtually everything they 
witnessed onscreen.  With innocent and gleeful faces, they display weapons, 
ships and extensive technology that they have somehow engineered and 
constructed after merely glancing it through the "Quest" transmissions.  
Besides serving as a basic premise for the story, these technologies make 
for a hilarious conceit, as the crew members seem baffled by the science 
they are faced with using.  The aliens, of course, are convinced the actors 
constitute the veteran crew of "Protector," whose motto is the commander's 
catch line, "Never give up; never surrender."  So the washed-up actors 
masquerade as their actual characters, unwilling to disillusion the 
extremely respectful aliens, who have appointed them to helm the embodiment 
of the fictional ship.  It turns out, by the way, that the actors simply 
have to duplicate their actions from the show in order to run the gadgets on 
the real ship.
The bad guys here are a race of green reptilian aggressors, who are 
determined to destroy the good aliens - the Thermians.  The main conflict 
traces the fight with these quasi-reptiles, who are after the Thermian-made 
device called the Omega 13.  Exactly what this device is, no one knows, as 
it was mentioned only vaguely on the T.V. show.  Naturally, Jason Nesmith 
appears completely outclassed by the alien general.  What is fascinating is 
watching all of the riffs and comic twists that result from the numerous 
clichés and conventions set up through the plot.  Will the actors stop their 
petty bickering long enough actually to help their admirers from deep space? 
  Will the rabid fans back on Earth get satisfaction from seeing the next 
appearance of the crew?
The film is well directed by Dean Parisot.  Its pace is quick, lending a 
loose comic tone;  the timing also enhances the many allusions and 
self-reflexive gimmicks.  Parisot capitalizes on countless references to 
ploys frequently spotted in "Star Trek" and similar shows, and even in the 
"Alien" movies, in which Sigourney Weaver starred as Ripley.
Tim Allen's nonchalance is important to his success in the type of double 
role he plays here.  Though he is a hopeless, alcoholic jerk, Nesmith is 
somehow ennobled during his stint as the real Commander Taggart, and earns 
the credit bestowed upon him.  It's Allen's best performance since "The 
Santa Clause."
Weaver does a nice job playing the aging actress portraying Tawny Madison.  
In one scene she snaps at another crew member that, even though her job is 
merely to repeat the computer's words, she will do it with relish.  Weaver 
is best in the subtle comedy resulting from her asides to other crew 
members.
Tony Shalhoub proves his reliability again, showing off his knack for 
excelling at widely different roles.  His Tech Sgt. Chen is an air-headed 
version of Scotty or Geordi or O'Brien or Torres.  The change he undergoes 
is one of the funnier transitions in the film.  One small criticism I have 
is that Daryll Mitchell's character - Tommy Webber as Lt. Laredo - goes 
through a similar change in character.  Here a parody succumbs to the very 
conventions it tries to undermine, though even this concession is done with 
charm.
Finally, Alan Rickman does perhaps the most solid job of support. He's a 
classically trained Shakespearean actor, and very unhappy at having to don 
the same bony headpiece to further his failed career.  His Dr. Lazarus is a 
stone-faced boor whose feud with Nesmith never fails to elicit chuckles.
A favorite of my daughter's was Mathesar, the leader of the good aliens, 
played by Enrico Colantoni.  His humming, hesitating voice is itself a piece 
of hilarious shtick, and the relationship he builds with the incompetent 
Earthlings is endearing.
Stan Winston's shop did the special effects for the film, and produced 
smooth work.  The bad  alien costumes are particularly compelling, and one 
scene at the end is remarkable in its realism.  Watch for Allen in a 
knock-down funny fight against an alien pig lizard.
After watching the documentary "Trekkies" this past summer, we found this 
film to be a light variation.  Both films are a delight, and both convey a 
sense of ambivalence toward sci-fi fans (much like the tone of a Shatner 
sketch on "Saturday Night Live" in which Capt. Kirk lashes out at 
overzealous "Trek" fans, only to apologize later).  Ultimately, "Quest" 
recognizes how the heart of a show like this is the fans and their loyalty.
For any fans of space movies, especially those set in the microcosms of 
ships, "Galaxy Quest" (though it has a lame title) is a must-see.  Its 
constant references to the genre it parodies make it an intelligent and 
crisply written work.  And it's just plain fun to sit back and laugh at this 
light but smart humor.  See it before going back to school!

Review for Tigger Movie, The (2000)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at www.ofcs.org
Full of fun, great animation and fine voice-acting, Walt Disney Pictures' 
THE TIGGER MOVIE is a welcome addition to the bleak theater offerings of 
mid-February.
Taking full advantage of the solid Winnie the Pooh franchise, the producers 
have added new dimensions to many of its characters.  We see the most of 
Tigger, of course, the namesake of the movie;  he is friendly towards all 
the inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood.  What's charming is that this 
treatment creates a close friendship between Tigger and Roo, the tiny son of 
Kanga, and the most child-like character, besides Tigger himself.
The main plot of the film has Tigger yearning for a family of his own:  it's 
no longer the most wonderful thing about Tiggers, that he's the only one!
At first the group of animal friends goes off on little sorties, searching 
for other Tiggers, as though they are convinced of their existence.  Finally 
- and this is perfect - the friends agree to write a letter to Tigger, from 
his family;  the pompous Owl wields the pen, and the letter is co-written, 
one line from each of the major characters.  It's heartfelt advice, stuff 
like "Eat well" (Pooh-bear's contribution), "Stay safe and sound," and other 
sentiments, reveals much about the true and important feeling imparted by 
membership in a family unit.  Soon the letter is on its way, and Tigger is 
indeed convinced that his family is real.  When Tigger readies his 
ramshackle house for a welcoming party, his motley friends end up donning 
Tigger costumes and try to trick their overactive tiger-like pal.  Some of 
the most cinematically stunning effects in any Pooh installment follow 
Tigger's disappointment at discovering he's been hoodwinked by his 
overzealous pals.
The voices are among the most engaging aspects of the movie.  Jim Cummings 
has done Pooh's voice since 1987, emulating well the hoarse mildness of the 
late Sterling Holloway.  Now he has assumed the duties of Tigger as well, 
after Disney's dismissal of the inimitable Paul Winchell.  It is amazing, 
however, how much Cummings sounds like the persona created by Winchell.  The 
inflections, wacky asides and "hoo-hoo" laughter is nearly dead-on.
Nine year-old Nikita Hopkins supplies the voice of Roo, an innocent and 
likable voice that's perfectly cast. Kanga is Kath Soucie, the ever-patient 
and loving mother-figure.
Peter Cullen does a nice job with the pessimistic Eeyore, an amusing droop 
to his voice.  Owl is voiced by Andre Stojka, a nice edge of pretension to 
his depiction.  Tom Attenborough does not get much screen time as 
Christopher Robin, the human owner of the "dolls" that live in the Hundred 
Acre Wood.  And veteran actor John Hurt does a decent turn as the narrator.  
I liked how this incarnation preserves the 1960's narrative technique of 
showing a storybook, letters and words pouring off the page at times.  But 
Hurt is not used enough to exert a strong presence in the story.
The sole carry-over from the old cast (which originated the Disney version 
of A. A. Milne's classic stories with the Academy Award-winning short 
"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" in 1968) is John Fielder as Piglet, 
whose voice is even more light and humble than Pooh's.  Long experience has 
added a subtle sheen of sympathy to the voice of the friendly little pig.
Another star is the animation.  Much of it was done at Disney's Japan 
animation center, with other parts being shared around the globe.  Featured 
are muted colors - hues that compliment well the simple and heart-warming 
narrative line.  The green pastel trees and stylized backgrounds are 
unmistakably Disney, a quaint throwback mix of the "Disneyfied" and "Classic 
Pooh" styles in some ways.
Music is also excellent.  The original team that has done all the music for 
previous Poohs is back: Richard M. Sherman and brother Robert B. Sherman.  
The pace and lyrics and overall effect of their original songs add a good 
deal to the enjoyment factor.  Kenny Loggins collaborated on the closing 
ballad, while Harry Gregson-Williams capably supplied the rest of the score.
The film is rated G, another rare and welcome element in today's viewing 
culture.  It is very watchable for all ages, as the story moves quickly 
forward, not without a generous sprinkling of wit along the way.  See it now 
with a child or without;  it's one of those films you will never be sorry 
you sat through!


Title
Review for Original Kings of Comedy, The (2000)
Well-directed, very funny in several spots, topical without being offensive, 
THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY shows off the routines of four leading African 
American comedians  Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and 
Bernie Mac.  This performance of the  `Kings of Comedy' tour was filmed at 
the Charlotte Coliseum by director Spike Lee.
Steve Harvey works well in his role of comedian and master of ceremonies.  
His function effectively divides his routine into several spots, each 
several minutes long;  Harvey provides very flattering introductions for 
Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and Mac.
Harvey also seems to be very good-natured in his approach to comedy.  
Although he is not above being arch and downright earthy, Harvey enjoys 
himself immensely and frequently laughs at his own jokes.  Just the 
spectacle of his imitating a black person aboard the Titanic is hilarious!
D.L. Hughley also does a very enjoyable routine.  Like all of his 
colleagues, Hughley addresses racial issues, but never handles them 
offensively: his jibes at white people in the audience are fun-loving and 
accurate.
Cedric the Entertainer is perhaps the most energetic among the performers.  
His crazy dances, imitations, and footwork are funny because of their topics 
as well as their incongruity: such antics from a round bear of a man in a 
sweater, gold chain and fedora are indeed amusing.
Bernie Mac was hard to read.  In sequences filmed outside, in what seemed to 
be a playground, he is well-spoken and clear.  Yet in his routine, Mac 
speaks in a fast-paced jumble, often hard to comprehend.  Is this part of 
his act  a persona designed to reflect both his jokes and culture  or is 
it a result of his hard-edged pace?  In any case, Mac used the most 
profanity in his routine, frequently overusing obscenities for their own 
sake.  Although I found his methods to be the least likable of the four 
stand-up masters, Bernie Mac does tell a very good visual joke.
Spike Lee is smart not to intrude upon the acts of the four stars.  Lee 
employs occasional montages  women from the audience posing for the camera, 
the comedians goofing around on a playground and backstage  and these brief 
sequences lend nice variation to the stage acts.  On the whole the direction 
is smooth, the editing tight.  The stage decoration is also tasteful and 
appropriate, the backdrop a jewel-studded crown, with satiny shapes adorning 
the curtains.
I would recommend this film mainly for its target audience, African 
Americans above age 16.  But its flavor extends certainly to all races, as 
most of the topics and interests are universal.  Though I did not get actual 
belly laughs from any of the content, the routines kept me laughing 
steadily.

Title
Review for Other Sister, The (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Because many Americans feel awkward around people with handicaps, one 
might think a film starring two mentally challenged young people would 
not have a chance.  But the acting of Juliette Lewis, as Carla Tate, and 
Giovanni Ribisi, as Danny McMann, saves the film from the dangers of 
patronizing overtures and maudlin sentimentality.
Carla Lewis, the daughter of wealthy parents, has spent the last decade 
growing up in an exclusive boarding school for the mentally challenged.  
The film opens with her father, Dr. Radley Tate (Tom Skerritt), picking 
her up and flying with her back to their mansion and family.  Mother 
Elizabeth (Diane Keaton) is overprotective, but eventually gives in to 
various manifestations of Carla's independence.  First, Carla desires a 
high school diploma, and after her mother's resistance she succeeds in 
enrolling in a vocational school, her goal to become a veterinarian's 
assistant.  Goal number two is to obtain her own apartment, an idea she 
conceives initially from school mate Danny McMann.  Danny is also 
mentally challenged, and lives in an apartment paid for by his father.
Of course Carla's largest wish is for freedom within her relationship 
with Danny.  As the two fall in love, Carla becomes more concerned with 
her mother's opposition.  Carla has seen how her mother treats Heather 
and Caroline, Carla's sisters;  Mrs. Tate bullies one about her 
impending wedding, and refuses even to meet the lesbian lover of the 
other.  So the stage is set for extended conflicts, especially after 
Danny alienates himself from the family by humiliating Carla in front of 
the Tates' friends at Sutter Hills Country Club.
The partial result of these conflicts is a predictability that hinders 
the film.  Diane Keaton's character is so afflicted by tunnel vision 
that we begin to dislike her.  Her bull-headedness may have roots we can 
understand - an old worry about protecting the girl from childhood 
taunting.  But writers Bob Brunner and Garry Marshall extend her concern 
into obsession.  At least Keaton never becomes hysterical, but it's just 
hard to watch her redundant characterization.  As her husband Radley 
Tate - a dentist, we presume, as he gives out toothbrushes for Halloween 
- Tom Skerritt is miscast.  Skerritt is the right age to have three 
grown daughters, but perhaps the role is underdeveloped.  In any case, 
Skerritt does not seem to inhabit the role in a sense large enough to 
make it convincing.
Hector Elizondo gets to play a more fleshed-out father figure.  As 
Ernie, the owner of the apartment occupied by Danny, Elizondo is 
compassionate and supportive, if a little dry.  He also gets to show off 
his guitar playing skills, and it's always good when a director utilizes 
an actor's particular talents.  Ernie is another example of the film's 
realism, the extra dimension added by a well-written supporting role.
The best things about the picture are Lewis and Ribisi, though.  The 
nuances of their performances are quite engaging.  Just as Lewis seems 
to be in peril of over-acting, she tempers her portrayal with the 
pronunciation of a single word or a careful stride.  It is a studied 
performance - one can imagine Lewis practicing how to move or react;  
but the sweetness she brings to the role imbues the movie with a 
lightness that makes the viewer more comfortable with the subject 
matter.  Ribisi does not emphasize his mannerisms as much as Lewis does, 
but neither is his manner subtle.  "I love you more than marching bands 
and more than cookie-baking," Danny tells Carla, with one line showing a 
sincerity that makes us love him.
Another admirable trait the film displays is not solving serious 
problems easily.  The approach is almost unsettling when the characters 
disagree to the point of alienation;  although it takes awhile to set up 
and then to close these conflicts (the film runs two hours and ten 
minutes, just a little long), we are gratified by the realistic 
handling.  
For fans of 'The Graduate,' there is a wonderful schtick in which Danny 
plays the Dustin Hoffman role.  The older film is worked in wonderfully, 
and is played both for comic and serious effect.  Viewers should take 
note of another scene, a flashback Carla recalls as she ascends the 
stairs to her old bedroom.  Kendra Krull plays the young Carla with a 
sign "Follow Stupid" taped to her back, a line of children following her 
up the stairs.  When Carla lashes out and pushes a teasing boy down the 
stairs, we see the older Carla's horror instantly relived, a mix of 
guilt and revulsion at mockery.  And Carla is made touchingly human, 
feeling emotions as sharply as anyone around her.
Even though all the characters are not flawlessly written, 'The Other 
Sister' is a moving and original treatment of the boy-meets-girl, loses 
her, etc. scenario.  The film is to be admired for its gutsy approach to 
an oft-avoided topic:  it neither condescends nor lectures about 
society's treatment of people with handicaps.   'The Other Sister is 
rated PG-13 due to discussions of sex, and would be fine for children 12 
and up.


Title
Review for Civil Action, A (1998)
A Film Review by Mark O'Hara
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
I like John Travolta.  There's the connection I feel from my teenage 
years when he was Vinnie Barbarino, my friends and me cracking up in the 
high school cafeteria with the line, "Up your nose with a rubber hose."  
I grew up in New Jersey, and Travolta has Jersey connections (listen to 
his deceptive hard r's sometime, similar to Danny DeVito's).  The man is 
just cool, hair swept back, face ready to look threatening or comedic.
The trouble is, he gets way too much screen time in 'A Civil Action.'  
Travolta's Jan Schlichtmann is a personal injury lawyer with two 
partners - Kevin Conway (Tony Shalhoub) and Bill Crowley (Zelijko 
Ivanek) - and an accountant, James Gordon (William H. Macy).  Among 
these players, only Macy is doled out a decent number of lines by the 
script.  Gordon has the job of locating finances for the case in which 
the firm is involved, and Macy does a fine job of complaining to the 
lead partner, Schlichtmann, about impending bankruptcy.  In a scene in 
which Gordon confronts Schlichtmann during a thunderstorm, their law 
office dark and bare because of all the repossessions, we see Macy show 
a darn good stint of anger.  His style is not physically threatening, 
but for a suit-wearing numbers-cruncher, he appears memorably agitated.  
Shalhoub and Ivanek, two strong actors, go along for the ride.  What's 
weak here is that the film becomes as much about the lessons learned by 
one lawyer as about a legal case brought by parents of children who died 
of leukemia.
The town is Woburn (Woo-burn), Massachusetts, and the parents of the 
deceased children are not sure whom they should hold responsible.  The 
most visible parent is Anne Anderson, played by Kathleen Quinlan.  She 
embarrasses Schlichtmann as he talks on his legal radio show, the result 
being his visit to the town in order to drop the case politely.  But on 
his drive back to the city he is stopped for a second speeding ticket;  
before he climbs back in his Porsche, Schlichtmann notices signs of 
pollution in the river.  He investigates, catching his expensive shoes 
in the muck, but also spotting the tell-tale foam along the bank.   
After he eyes operations run by W. R. Grace and Beatrice, he decides 
this could be a money-maker.  His firm commences to depose witnesses and 
hires a drilling firm to probe the aquifer for pollutants.  
I've said already that I'm a Travolta fan, but the best actor in the 
thing is Robert Duvall.  This guy is such a pro that he exudes character 
in the idiosyncrasies of his dress.  While Jan Schlichtmann dons 
impeccable suits and silk ties done up in thin knots, Duvall's opposing 
lawyer Jerome Facher leaves his collar button unfastened, the neck 
pieces of his tie slightly visible.  Facher, the legal eagle whose firm 
speaks for Beatrice Foods, is fastidious in his personal habits, and 
even more careful in his legal machinations.  He may look like an old 
fogey who worships the Red Sox and revels at receiving free pens, but he 
is sly like Inspector Columbo, saving his canniness for when it counts.  
In a sequence of masterful intercutting, we watch Facher lecturing to 
his Harvard law students about maneuvers to avoid in court;  while he 
warns against them, we witness Jan Schlichtmann committing the self-same 
mistakes!   It's a relief that Duvall does not engage in his folksy 
chuckle in this role;  I was beginning to believe he was overusing it.  
Robert Duvall is one of the very best living actors, and there's never 
any talk of his recovering from a career slump.
The story develops into an expose of the legal system, and that's fine, 
except that it feels like we should see more of the victims, the 
children who contracted cancers or at least their families.  The 
glimpses we catch of Mrs. Anderson are brief.  She sits in the back of 
the courtroom on the left-hand side.  In a rare scene that brings us 
close to any of the children, Anne Anderson explains that if she and her 
son were ever separated in stores, their plan was to meet in the back on 
the left side.  And he would meet his mother in the back, left-hand side 
of Heaven.  I suppose the film is to be admired for not taking advantage 
of the tears that could be jerked;  at least the tone is not 
sentimental.  Still, we could stand more of the folks who ostensibly 
hired the firm of Schlichtmann, Conway and Crowley.  Perhaps Kathleen 
Quinlan more opportunity to interact with the lawyers, the Judge Skinner 
(John Lithgow), somebody.  Her role is merely functional, except toward 
the end when she expresses profound disappointment that she never got 
what she wanted, a meaningful apology.
The sets are appropriately decorated, especially the law offices and 
meeting rooms, their shelves lined in calfskin volumes, their heavy 
doors stained dark.  Some nice business turns up concerning the house 
that holds Schlichtmann's office.  It's almost a running joke when 
workmen remove more furnishings, and later Gordon gets up from the floor 
where he desk used to be, and launches his tirade at Schlichtmann, who 
has the habit of refusing offers of millions without consulting his 
cohorts.  There are also some nice shots to establish the gravity 
surrounding courtrooms. Tall corridors lined in marble, the camera 
panning around the statue of a man wielding a sickle.  (But maybe I 
remember these scenes because I saw them ten times over the last months, 
the slick trailer incorporating far too much of the story - but what 
trailer nowadays does not?)
Jonathan Harr's non-fiction best seller 'A Civil Action' sold 1.5 
million copies.  So the film has a solid base from which to spring.  The 
film born of the book is realistic in its jaundiced view of the justice 
system, as well as in its tracing of a lawyer's financial fall.  I 
should add that the picture does not end where it might, but continues 
to follow Schlichtmann's free fall.  It's a decision that adds another 
dimension to the story, suggesting that his moral character has 
improved, even after facing the aftermath of a disastrous case.
Unfortunately, 'A Civil Action' increases the number of stories in which 
underdogs battle vast corporations.  For the most part we see only 
lawyers representing Grace and Beatrice.  But the film contains enough 
glittering pinpoints of originality, and above-average acting, to 
recommend it.  If only it were not so much about John Travolta.


Title
Review for Entrapment (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
As I watched "Entrapment" I found myself wondering if Sean Connery could 
estimate the quality of a script he was shooting.
If he can, he surely realized this one was mediocre.
It's the story of Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery), called "Mac."  He's a 
world-class art thief, and the insurance company that covers the stolen 
works is very upset.  Waverly Insurance employs an expert, Gin (Catherine 
Zeta-Jones) to analyze his methods.  Overzealous, Gin is granted permission 
actually to track down Mac, in London.  The old and wily thief is soon on to 
her, but she convinces Mac she is a sort of double agent, a thief herself 
only posing as an expert in solving crimes by dismantling them.  Soon she 
and Mac land at his remote castle on the coast of Britain, where they 
rehearse the methodology of this particular crime - the stealing of a golden 
Chinese mask.  With daring skill they break into an enormous manor, and Gin 
begins her practiced body movements to elude the lasers that would trip the 
alarm.  Watch these scenes for Zeta-Jones doing her martial arts of 
elusiveness, bending and twisting along what seems to be an open floor.
After this caper is successful, the control of the criminal duo shifts.  Now 
Gin seems to be the one manipulating "Mac," and as they travel to Malaysia 
to engineer the scheme she has created, a romance clearly begins to develop. 
  The climax of the film is a high-tech bank heist on the crack of the new 
millenium, and indeed the high points of the story include the actual 
robberies I've described.
But there are too many low points for the film to take its place as anything 
more than a minor espionage flick.  Connery is a masterful actor, and 
Zeta-Jones holds her own opposite him, except during occasional bouts of 
adolescent anger.  What these players are working with is not enough help.  
The cuts are often too fast, and director Jon Amiel does not allow adequate 
time for the development either of character or of meaningful relationships. 
  Will Patton is miscast as the honcho from  Waverly insurance:  he's given 
a darkened mustache and Hispanic name, Hector Cruz.  Ving Rhames sketches 
his character - Thibadeaux, apparently a right-hand man for Mac - with 
authority and menace, a performance that is effective but perhaps too easy 
for the physically imposing actor.  (Someone, please cast this wonderful 
presence against type!)  The film does benefit from changes in scenery, its 
international locales lending variety and at times stunning beauty.  But are 
these elements enough to salvage a film that tries to draw its strength from 
the oldest tricks in the spy/thief genre?  And yes, we know early what's in 
store for us - as many turnabouts of identity as can be packed into a plot, 
some of them downright red herrings.
"Entrapment," a solid one-word title, is passable entertainment, but I would 
suggest seeing it as we did, in a second-run theater.  You'll like the 
gadgets and the figurative meanings that reflect about the screen like 
deflected lasers.  But you'll also sense the places responsible for 
mediocrity


Title
Review for Misérables, Les (1998)
Opening May 1, "Les Miserables" beats the handfuls of summer films.  It 
sprawls across the screen, inviting the viewer into the expansive French 
countryside.  Even larger are the themes, which are portrayed without 
condescension.  
Liam Neeson dominates the screen.  His Jean Valjean is a lout who 
clobbers a good-hearted bishop, a man who forgives Jean without 
hesitation, who ransoms (what a good word!) Jean's soul from evil and 
darkness.  For the rest of the film Jean returns this gift of redemption 
to other characters.  His relentless kindness never clogs up the plot 
with sentimentality;  Neeson allows us to accept Jean's selflessness 
without question.  Dynamically changed from the brute who became 
animal-like after 19 years of imprisonment, he hardly seems like a 
dynamic character.  Indeed his decency during the two eras into which 
the film leaps seems static, a miraculous given.
Uma Thurman never looked so bad.  As Fantine, eyes bugged and gums 
bloodied, she commands our sympathy completely.  Of course Victor Hugo 
created a cliché with Fantine's character, but Thurman delivers an 
understated resignation that permits us to imagine the depth of her 
sadness.  Inspector Javert's purposeful destruction of Fantine is his 
most despicable act.  Geoffrey Rush, who took the Academy Award for Best 
Actor for "Shine," brings a wonderful, transparent methodology to his 
acting.  His Javert carries out the law whenever he is onscreen, 
passionately but quietly:  and Rush's lankiness is perfect for the 
sternness demanded by the role.
Claire Danes gives us a believable Cosette.  Reacting with 
understandable puzzlement and determination, she alternates between the 
loyal daughterof Jean and the cunning lover of Marius.  Danes is 
wide-eyed and pleasant to look upon, but when her chin quivers with 
emotion -- as it does in "Romeo + Juliet" and "Little Women," -- we are 
reminded of Stallone's sneer or Clooney's downcast glances;  it becomes 
a trademark tic.  
It is admirable that director Bille August has cut Hugo's 1200 page 
novel down to a film of just two hours fifteen minutes.  This remake of 
"Les Miserables" is stronger than the recent "Man in the Iron Mask";  
the narrative builds a watchable momentum, scene by scene appalling or 
satisfying our sense of humanity.  But there is too much that is quiet.  
I was not expecting an epic with "Braveheart"-style battle scenes;  the 
ones shot in the old streets of the Czech Republic are fine.  But a 
greater amount of old-fashioned character development would let us know 
Marius better;  would tell us more about Javert's obsession with the 
law;  would, in the form of flashbacks, let us see Jean in prison or 
Fantine with her daughter, before their separation.  The story stands 
just on the strength of Hugo's thick plot.  But at least fifteen more 
minutes before the eyes would give the work the pleasant heft of the 
novel carried under the arm.


Title
Review for Vampires (1998)
A Film Review of John Carpenter's Vampires
by Mark O'Hara
visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.com
Why not start a review with the parts of the movie I didn't enjoy?
I could have done with a dozen fewer graphic and inventively twisted 
murders on screen.  OK - the severed heads didn't look all that 
realistic, and John Carpenter sometimes goes so over-the-top with the 
violence that I found myself chuckling at the excess.  But the first 
group-slaying carried out by Jack Crow (James Woods) and his Church-paid 
crusaders lets us know that extreme means and extreme caution are the 
method of operation needed here.  Do we have to witness friars flying 
about their mission's courtyard, the fountain running with their blood?
That said, Vampires is a tightly told action film, a hybrid of horror 
and spaghetti Western, an intense and sometimes campy entertainment.  
When Crow and Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) swing open the doors of a 
converted armored truck to let out the rest of their goon-killing squad, 
we know we're in for a ride.
The premise pivots on the motivation of the original vampire - not Vlad 
but the similarly-named Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith).  This vampire 
master was created 600 years ago by the Catholic Church, when an 
exorcism went wrong and Valek's dead body was left inhabited by his 
condemned soul.  This bit is one of the more striking among the many 
original additions to vampire mythology.  Of course Valek possesses 
superhuman strength, and dominates any confrontation with unarmed 
humans, even scores of them.  Valek is searching the American Southwest 
for the black cross, the one used at the time of his death.  What Jack 
Crow and his men are charged with is not only ridding the world of nests 
of the undead, but stopping Valek before he can use the cross in a 
ceremony enabling him to walk during the day.
In this adaptation of John Steakley's novel Vampire$, Carpenter and 
screenwriter Don Jakoby make a few more notable alterations to 
bloodsucker lore.  I found it fascinating that Crow is equated with a 
warrior in the Crusades; his quest is, after all, a sacred one.  In a 
low-key but stunning connecting scene, we watch Crow - exhausted from 
"burying" most of his slaughtered slayers to keep them from "turning" - 
hunched over the wheel of his truck.  Woods seems off guard for a 
change, almost wincing from weariness, when he suddenly focuses on the 
rosary hanging from the rear-view mirror.  Crosses become a clear motif 
in the narrative (even though they do no good when flashed in a 
vampire's bluish face).  Another nice touch is the weaponry used by the 
slayers.  Crossbows with tethered arrows, shiny spontoons and even a 
neckpiece made of mail - these instruments look good when pulled from 
the truck and even better when employed in close combat with the 
vampires.  Especially riveting are scenes in which vampires, impaled on 
the small harpoons, are dragged shrieking and shuddering out into the 
sunlight, where they burst into nifty little holocausts.  Good special 
effects.
We are supplied with little information about Jack Crow.  His parents 
are dead, the circumstances involving vampires.  Crow is a Bruce 
Wayne-like figure, a loner obsessed with hunting vampires, raised by the 
Church, in fact, to do so.  It's more economical that the film follows 
the small but wild scope of his world.  James Woods is all business in 
this role, particularly in verbal riffs addressed to Father Adam (Tim 
Guinee) and Valek.
Daniel Baldwin brings a cool toughness to the second-in-command slayer, 
Montoya.  He is also skilled in showing the camaraderie crucial to 
warriors: he's a big, good buddy to have on your side in a fight.  As he 
slowly falls in love with a hooker, Katrina, Baldwin's Montoya lets slip 
an uncharacteristic tenderness.  As Katrina, Sheryl Lee is talented at 
depicting a beauty that is at once alluring and repulsive - reflecting 
what is probably Carpenter's aim.
In scenes perhaps inspired by stylized Westerns , and most recently seen 
with the Armageddon astronauts fanned out and walking toward the camera, 
we see first the band of slayers and then, the film's conflict mounting, 
Valek and seven other vampire masters, stares menacing and black clothes 
flicking in the wind.  Several other variations on things Western lend 
the film tones that are both serious and campy.  It's a good bet that if 
viewers are not intrigued by dialogue or plot twists, they'll be amused.
John Carpenter's range as an artist is impressive.  The score is his 
original music. Although all I can remember now is a repetitive bass 
guitar phrase, the music does a fine and transparent job of 
complimenting the scenes.
Simply put, I enjoyed Vampires more than I though I would.  There were 
no extended scenes involving dark rituals, even though I was mildly 
creeped-out by Valek's attempt to reenact his exorcism.  The film is out 
mainly to pack in as much action as it can.  I'd say to see Vampires, 
especially if you're a fan of other Carpenter works, like The Thing and 
The Fog.  Don't go if you can't stomach gore, though, and don't take 
along any living person under 16.


Title
Review for Keeping the Faith (2000)
There's a lot to like in actor Edward Norton's directorial debut, KEEPING 
THE FAITH.  First, it's a solid romantic comedy, a hard genre to make.  
Second, it's intelligent in its treatment of religious themes, in a time in 
which it is rare to see the spiritual side of characters.  Finally, the 
acting and cast are first rate.  For how much more could a viewer ask?
A small frame for the story has Father Brian Finn (Norton) stagger into a 
bar to continue his jag of drinking.  He gets the tender of the deserted bar 
(Brian George) interested in what seems like the most outlandish rabbi and 
priest joke of all time.  Of course the story ends up being an account of 
his own life, starting with his childhood.  It seems Brian and his best 
friend Jake met as boys, and added another best friend in the form of `Anna 
Banana,' a tomboy named Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman).  The only problem was 
that Anna broke up the young Musketeers when her father moved the family to 
California.
But now Anna is back as an assertive and canny corporate type; she's `like a 
plumber,' only she fixes leaky companies.  Although she works far too many 
hours, she makes time to spend with her old buddies Jake and Brian.  The 
film follows the renewal of the three-way friendship, including some 
hilarious bits in which Jake  a very eligible rabbi  plays the dating game 
with women sent his way by numerous matchmakers  everyone from a 
exercise-obsessed Jewess to a rising star at ABC News, Rachel Rose (Rena 
Sofer).
So, what's the big conflict already?  Well, Jake begins seeing Anna, and the 
two decide to keep their passion secret  not only from Jake's congregation 
but also from Brian.  Meanwhile, Brian experiences his own crisis, dreaming 
about Anna and reading signals wrong until he confesses his own love for 
Anna.
So the theme of love permeates the story.  Often it is kept very human, 
especially when we see two men of God struggling to come to terms with the 
strictures that hamper or forbid relationships.  And some of the shtick with 
Ben Stiller invites out-loud laughter  though it would have been nice not 
to have had a few of these moments spoiled by the trailer!
As boys, Jake and Brian always showed acceptance and curiosity about each 
other's faith.  Fortunately, the film preserves the tone set by the boys: it 
explores many of the ideas and rituals important to Catholicism and Judaism. 
  Often Brian visits the temple at which Jake is junior rabbi, and Jake 
visits the church and rectory at which Brian is associate pastor.  Some of 
the most charming scenes outside of the triangular love plot involve 
ministry: for instance, Brian in the confessional (where was the 
reconciliation room, eh?) with an Hispanic kid whose raging hormones cause 
his sinful thoughts.  The temple and church even get together to sponsor an 
interfaith community center, complete with kareoke machine.  All of this 
niceness becomes an artifice, though, when it becomes clear that the board 
that runs the temple is displeased with Jake's behavior: why is he dating a 
shiksa when there's all these nice Jewish girls?  And would a real priest, 
who does not drink, instantly resort to large quantities of booze, creating 
suddenly that trite monster, the alcoholic Irishman?  Realsitic, no.  Funny, 
yes, and largely because Stuart Blumberg's screenplay does not go out of its 
way to be politically correct.
Still in his twenties, Edward Norton has shown amazing versatility.  
Comparing Father Brian Finn with the reformed skinhead Norton played in 
AMERICAN HISTORY X gets a stunned reaction.  Everything from the hair and 
eyebrows to the attitude and mannerisms is drastically different.  And 
Norton mines the wealth of Catholic and Jewish material fairly well.  Ben 
Stiller even gets to do a grand bit of physicality with a building security 
bull named T-Bone.
Stiller does a nice job of playing the modern man of religion, improvising 
much of his sermons, causing doctrine to be more accessible to his 
congregation.  And the man has just about perfected his comic timing.  (Why 
doesn't he make a movie with both his parents, by the way???)  I didn't mind 
the way Jake dressed; his black leather jacket went well with Father Brian's 
Roman outfit and with the elder rabbi's garb.  But Stiller's spiky hair 
looked a little silly sticking up around his yarmulke!
It's not hard to imagine Norton asking several of his older pals to play 
support.  The director Milos Forman has a small role as Father Havel, the 
Czech refugee who's been a priest in New York since he fled his homeland in 
1968.  On what subject does he counsel Father Brian?  Love!
The priest's counterpart is played by Eli Wallach.  It's always enjoyable to 
see such a veteran on the screen again, with his easy manner and very 
recognizable voice.
Anne Bancroft plays Mrs. Shram, Jake's mother.  Apparently she has disowned 
Jake's older brother (they've not even communicated in two years) for 
marrying a non-Jewish girl.  Hence Jake's added anxiety over dating Anna.  
Bancroft is a wonderfully natural actress.  A small problem that confronts 
her here, though, comes when she makes a sudden and uncharacteristic 
decision toward the end of the story.
Without a few of the suggestive love scenes between Jake and Anna, KEEPING 
THE FAITH would have been rated PG, instead of PG-13.  Too bad.  The current 
release RETURN TO ME is showing a refreshing `return' to more wholesome 
romantic comedy, and FAITH contains many of the same successful conventions. 
  Anyway, both films are a welcome break from the excess of `R' flicks 
gazing down from the marquees of America's multiplexes!

Review for X-Men (2000)

The summer of 2000 has a lot to offer when it comes to movies, and Bryan 
Singer's X-MEN only adds to your choices.
OK  it's not the comic book, but it's a darn well-made movie, with a large 
and solid cast, and you don't have to be familiar with Stan Lee's comics to 
pick up and enjoy the story.
The premise?  A result of quickened evolution, mutated humans have developed 
a range of extraordinary powers.  Trouble is, they pose a threat to the rest 
of humanity, or at least to those hatemongers who want to pass laws to force 
`mutants' to register (as Jews registered early during  the Nazi terrors?).  
Many mutants are allied with Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who 
runs a special school for `gifted youngsters' and who is himself a mutant, 
with powerful telepathic capabilities.  Dr. X's nemesis is Magneto (Sir Ian 
McKellen), a sometime friend who believes he is leading a war against humans 
 the species that would annihilate mutants.  Magneto's specialty is 
creating magnetic fields, and all kinds of mayhem involving metal.
A side conflict that flows into the primary one involves Senator Robert 
Jefferson Kelly (Bruce Davison), who is the main political force against 
mutants.  In one early scene he is assailing the credibility of Dr. Jean 
Grey (Famke Janssen), who is testifying before Congress on behalf of her 
fellow differently abled homo sapiens.  (Dr. Grey is telekinetic, with 
telepathic powers in their infant stages.)  What keeps us engaged in the 
story is the question of whether Magneto will succeed in his campaign 
against conventional humankind.  Will he thwart both Senator Kelly and the 
superintelligent Dr. Xavier?
The acting is strong, helping to make a fantastic story more plausible.  
Stewart delivers a magnificently understated performance, showing the 
control and range of emotion of a master actor.  I would tend to agree with 
some critics that McKellen is a tad too old for Magneto, though he too 
achieves a masterful subtlety of character.  This is a pair of seriously 
talented actors playing unusual but gripping antagonists.
Hugh Jackman plays a brooding Wolverine.  This character is virtually 
indestructible, his powers a bizarre combination;  his body almost instantly 
heals itself, but his mind is continually bothered by the traumatic 
experiments done to him at some earlier time (that he cannot remember).  The 
perverse experimenters implanted a wondrous metal skeleton throughout his 
body.  AnyhowWolverine is moody and extremely powerful, his sword-like 
talons shooting from his knuckles, and Hugh Jackman creates a level of 
sympathy that superheroes don't usually receive.
The rest of Wolverine's cohorts  the `good' X-Men working with Xavier  
include Janssen as Jean Grey, Grey's boyfriend Cyclops (James Marsden), 
Storm (Halle Berry) and the newcomer Rogue (Anna Paquin).  The baddies  
Magneto's henchmen  are Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), Toad (Ray Park), and the 
intriguing Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos).  Although some of these 
characters are featured less than others, all of the actors turn in 
transparent jobs.
Bryan Singer keeps a tight pace but does not ignore characterization.  His 
scenes are functional, and they don't feel the pressure of supplying 
non-stop action.  We need to feel close to the featured X-Men, just as Stan 
Lee causes readers to sympathize with the print versions of these mutated 
heroes.  And character development serves Lee's creative purposes.
If you are a fan of the comic, you will be instantly aware of the plainness 
of the heroes' costumes.  Wolverine appears mostly in street clothes, and 
when he joins the other X-Men, he dons their same black body armor.  (We are 
treated to a piece of wit, by the way, concerning Wolverine's usual yellow 
tights.)  I think the lack of flamboyance actually helps the story; we are 
not distracted by the neon colors.  In addition, Jean Grey appears normal, 
Janssen's dark hair supplanting Grey's orange.  Good decisions, Mr. Singer.
In all, X-MEN does suffer from the formulaic blues, the clichés of superhero 
stories coming out all over.  But there is enough catchy dialog, cool 
powers, and human interest to make the running time seem very quick.  
Wherever your tastes in movies run, X-MEN will keep you entertained this 
summer.

Review for High Fidelity (2000)
It's been several days since we saw HIGH FIDELITY - longer than I usually 
take to write about a film - but its feel is still with me.  Director 
Stephen Frears has put together an engaging piece about two big subjects, 
love and music, and the result is the best film released yet this year.
John Cusack gets credit as a screenwriter, along with D. V. DeVincentis, 
Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg.  Cusack is also the film's star; his 
character, Rob Gordon, owns Championship Vinyl, a quirky and eclectic music 
store in a Chicago neighborhood you wouldn't want to be caught in after 
dark.  This set is by far the most fun in the story; when the script locates 
us here, we watch the characters' true selves emerge.  Perhaps the film's 
success is ensured by the store and everything surrounding it.  It functions 
both as a meeting place and as a source of a surefire premise: theme and 
variations on romance.
Rob Gordon takes center stage by giving us a top-five list of breakups that 
gnaw at him the most.  Hence we watch clever flashbacks of Rob from the time 
he is fourteen and kissing a girl in the school playground, to the time of 
his most recent heartbreak, the present, his lover Laura (Iben Hjejle) 
having just left.  It takes Rob awhile to admit that Laura's moving her 
things to the upstairs apartment of an aging New Ager - Ian Raymond, who's 
played by Tim Robbins - is devastating enough to belong on this short list.  
But quickly we realize Rob's preoccupation with the topic emphasizes that 
this is the worst his heart has felt, ever.
When Cusack addresses the camera, it's a cool form of authorial intrusion, 
dear reader.  His character comes off as endlessly self-reflexive, the 
post-modern malaise dripping from his monologues and casual clothes.  His 
various sundered relationships come off as funny and touching, and you know 
things really get moving when he gets to the just-out number five on the 
list of all-time heartaches, the lissome Laura.  Really Cusack is brilliant 
in his nonchalance.  Whether talking to his audience or to his eccentric 
cadre of friends, he flashes wit and humanity, and we end up liking him, 
even if he seems the eternal child-man.
Cusack's acting is matched by the acting of Jack Black and Todd Louiso, who 
play Barry and Dick, clerks in Championship Vinyl.  They began as 
part-timers and now Rob can't get them to stop coming in every day.  
Clearly, they need lives, and what's neat is that by the end of the story, 
they are closer to getting lives.  Louiso, a Cincinnati native, is 
especially good:  low-key and slow-talking, he exudes a deep compassion 
belied by shyness.  I would tune in every week if there were a show starring 
these two music geeks.
Iben Hjejle is fine as Laura, perhaps overly calm is spots, but sympathetic 
and smooth.  The script treats her well, calling for a peak of emotions late 
in the story.
Frears uses a strong supporting cast.  Besides Black and Louiso, there's 
Cusack's sister Joan, who plays Liz, a friend of Laura and odd confidante of 
Rob.  Though Joan Cusack has a hard time not being funny, her role here 
calls for a more serious turn, a sort of go-between in the edgy romance 
between Rob and Laura.
As one of Rob's former girlfriends, Charlie, Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a 
bright but very superficial woman.  And Lisa Bonet ably helps the story 
achieve another of its points about love: there is an incredible amount of 
amorality out there.
Another main character is the music.  The songs played in the store, Rob's 
apartment, bars and other locales serve not only as background but as 
characterization.  When Barry is not allowed to play the tape of 
Monday-morning songs he's compiled, he takes it as a serious offense.  Even 
the title plays off the theme of fidelity - or faithfulness - making the 
piece directly about love and the loyal that is a clear sign of it.
HIGH FIDELITY is rated R for language and sexuality, essentially unnecessary 
tidbits of sex scenes.  I wouldn't take anyone under 16.  I suspect the film 
will have a wide audience, as the musical styles appeal to many generations 
of taste, and of course the love themes engage the owners of hearts of any 
age.

Review for American Beauty (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
There's something classic about the word "American" when it's used in a 
title.  It's appeared in the names of films, fiction, music and many more 
genres, and gains a certain amount of dignity perhaps from the nomenclature 
of history:  wars and political events.
"American Beauty," from director Sam Mendes, spins this proper adjective in 
an altogether new direction.
The film opens with an aerial shot, voice-over narration running as the 
camera closes in on a city and then a neighborhood and street.  Lester 
Burnham (Kevin Spacey) tells us this is his town and street - his life.  And 
he will be dead within a year.
Why the artifice, the super-removed point of view from a crucial character?  
It's part of the approach that lifts "American Beauty" beyond mediocrity and 
places it on the level of classic.
This guy Lester is your basic loser - at least his wife Carolyn (Annette 
Bening) and their only child Jane (Thora Birch) think so.  A schmuck that 
slaves for an advertising agency, Lester is on his way out due to 
downsizing.  His marriage is loveless, his wife caught up in her business as 
pusher of real estate, seemingly obsessed with beating out her competition, 
Buddy Kane, the "King" of Real Estate (played by a graying Peter Gallagher). 
  Daughter Jane is part of a high school troupe, sort of dancing 
cheerleaders, and often shows her sullen teen demeanor.  When Mom and Dad 
actually show up at the half time of a basketball game to catch the dancers' 
performance, Lester catches sight of Jane's friend Angela Hayes (Mena 
Suvari) and begins a fixation that traces his fall from typical American 
grace.  It is as though Angela dances for him alone, and we see the first of 
segments set in unreal time, the fantasies that feature Angela in sensual 
poses, surrounded by loads of red rose petals.
But Lester's life is not the only one beset by unhappiness and miserable 
hope.  Wife Carolyn becomes smitten by no other than Buddy the "King" 
himself, and Jane shows fascination with a new neighbor kid named Ricky 
Fitts (Wes Bentley), who has come out of two years in a mental hospital and 
now sells exotic marijuana to a wide clientele.  Ricky's father is a 
military retiree who introduces himself as "Colonel Fitts, U. S. Marine 
Corps."
What goes down largely involves Lester's abandoning of the American work 
ethic.  He writes an absurd diatribe of a job description for himself, 
ensuring his firing, but blackmails his way into a year's full salary and 
benefits, using knowledge of managerial infidelities.  After Angela comments 
to Jane that she would find Jane's dad attractive if he would just work out 
a little, Lester indeed begins to work out.  He also begins to speak his 
mind to his wife, and to smoke Ricky's very best blend.  We never expect 
Lester to be happy in the long term, as we know his fate already;  but he 
does have a heck of a good time in his reconciliation with reality.
The ensemble cast does a marvelous job of portraying individuals with lost 
dreams.  Kevin Spacey fills in the blanks of Lester's life with terrible 
nuances:  we are at once repelled and drawn by his devil-may-care antics.  
For a long time Lester is caught in his unsmiling rut.  When he finally 
breaks out and grins, we are happy for him, and realize the best side of the 
film:  it's a very dark comedy that pokes you in the ribs, getting as many 
winces of pain as it gets laughs.  For his sketching of Lester Burnham, 
Spacey deserves at least a few nominations.
Annette Bening shows her talent for comedy and melodrama, often in the same 
scene.  At one point she shows a hopeless cause of a house (which she 
herself cleans) to several reluctant couples.  After the open house is over, 
Carolyn leans against the patio door and sobs, finally slapping herself out 
of it.  She is a creature attracted to success to an extreme degree, using 
mantras like "I am going to sell this house today," and "I will no longer be 
a victim."  Carolyn's love for Lester is on hold, but she could connect once 
again if she could stop worrying about his ruining the furniture.
Thora Birch is wonderful as Jane, an angry girl looking for any type of 
attention.  With a talent for using a deadpan expression, Birch shows utter 
contempt for her parents, yet commences to see the beautiful side of her 
creepy neighbor Ricky.  This actress also shows perfectly natural, if a bit 
reluctant, nonchalance when she is the subject of Ricky's ever-present 
videocamera.
Chris Cooper, one of the best character actors now working, plays Colonel 
Fitts with gripping naturalness.  Although we need to know more about his 
motivation, Fitts treats son Ricky with extra-stern discipline, virtually 
jailing him for two years after the boy smokes pot and severely beats a 
schoolmate.  Late in the film Fitts shows more of his butch-headed mania;  
in every scene he thrills us with what he might do to any character around 
him.
First-time film director Sam Mendes does a nice job with Alan Ball's script. 
  One criticism is that Mendes, a veteran of theater, is overly enamored 
with the medium of film.  Composition and framing are often very noticeable, 
distracting viewers from the action, and in fact causing the action to move 
at a slow pace at times.  But the shots are nevertheless amazing to watch:  
perfectly groomed living rooms, double and triple images of Jane on Ricky's 
camera and television screens as she poses for him across the side yard.  
Further, imagery involving red roses and water lend the story a whimsical 
resonance.  Several scenes benefit from a stark soundtrack of piano and 
marimba.
What the film ultimately takes as its topic is just what the title suggests: 
  Beauty.  Angela Hayes is as beautiful as the red rose of the film's name, 
but beauty is in fact skin deep.  Ricky often mentions beauty when talking 
of his filming.  In one sequence that he shows to Jane, a white plastic bag 
is tossed in a tiny whirlwind among the leaves on an empty sidewalk, a 
symbol of the beauty that results from being human - from being tossed about 
and absorbing the aches we get from love or the lack of it, which is 
neglect.  The beauty these characters experience or miss is again typically 
American, and the result is a tale of immorality and wonder that causes 
mixed feelings toward the characters and their actions.
"American Beauty" has come out a couple of months before December's Oscar 
competitors, but some nominations should come its way.  The film is rated R 
for language and drug use, a couple of scenes of extreme violence, and 
strong sexual content.  I would hesitate taking along anyone under 17, the 
American recommendation for mature viewing audiences.

Review for Titan A.E. (2000)
For my money  and cinemas are taking more of it all the time  Fox's new 
animated release TITAN AE is the best animated film in a couple of years, at 
least since Dreamworks' THE PRINCE OF EGYPT.
The plot has its derivative elements.  It's a story about an orphaned male 
hero named Cale Tucker (voice of Matt Damon).  We watch as Cale's brilliant 
father gives custody of his young son to an alien friend named Tech, and 
then takes off in his master creation  the ship of the title, a vessel that 
could insure the survival of Homo sapiens.  The marauding aliens (the Drej, 
pronounced phonetically) quickly dipatch Earth, blowing it into chunks that 
destroy many ships full of escaping humans, as well as the Moon.  After the 
instant lapse of fifteen years, we see the grown Cale doing menial labor; he 
also experiences the discrimination that several aliens heap upon species 
that do not have a native planet.
The main thrust of the plot involves a renegade captain drafting Cale into 
the attempt to revivify humanity.  The captain (Bill Pullman) shows Cale a 
glowing map genetically imprinted upon Cale's hand.  The map displays the 
location of Titan, stowed years ago before it could be deployed by Cale's 
now-dead father.  How Cale will salvage Titan and cope with various 
complications along the voyage is the stuff of the plot.
The plot is certainly not stodgy.  Although some scenes are reminiscent of 
other science fiction flicks, the film's pace is fast.  But the real star is 
the animation.
As any film buff could predict, chase scenes take up several minutes of the 
story's run.  In one scene we are given a sort of poetically beautiful 
release, in which beings known as wake angels pursue the ship piloted by 
Cale.  It's pure computer-engineered action, the ship and angels weaving 
their way through reddish clouds and formations.  In the chases involving 
real danger, the animation is even sharper.  Drej ships dive and fire, as 
Cale and his fellow adventurers continue to elude almost all attempts at 
capture.  The whole deal's been done before  just not in this precise, 
engaging manner.
Matt Damon does a solid job voicing  Cale Tucker. He brings to the role no 
distracting verbal mannerisms, only a straight and very efficient character.
Drew Barrymore as the female hero Akima does carry along her distinctive 
slow and smooth voice.  This is not a problem except that it is easy to 
recognize her, and hard to match the voice with the Asian features the 
directors (Don Bluth and Gary Goldman) have chosen to give Akima.
Bill Pullman does perhaps the strongest work in giving a dynamic character 
to the captain that risks his life to save Cale from the eerie blue aliens, 
the Drej.  Pullman's voice conveys a nice edge, a savviness that we find 
memorable, especially after the character undergoes swift and drastic 
changes.
Now that most schoolchildren are out for the summer, a good movie is often a 
desirable way to spend an afternoon.  I'd recommend taking children as young 
as seven to see TITAN AE.  There are some violent scenes, and some horrid 
examples of betrayal , but nothing graphic enough to inspire nightmares 
(unless they involve the faceless, evil Drej!).  Best of all, the film 
reaches into the adult range because of its quick pace, its intelligence 
(there's even a scene that parodies sci-fi conventions), and its outstanding 
animation.


Title
Review for Man Who Knew Too Much, The (1956)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
One of the five "Lost Hitchcocks" that were unavailable for 30 years, THE 
MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is among the classic thrillers of the 1950's, and an 
example of the director's most polished work.
The film starts with a scene on a bus ride through Morocco, and supplies 
viewers with brilliantly compressed characterization and foreshadowing.  A 
well-off American couple, Ben and Jo McKenna (James Stewart and Doris Day) 
and their only child Hank (Christopher Olsen) sit in the back of the bus as 
it speeds toward Marrakech.  They've been on vacation for many days, 
throughout Europe and northern Africa, after a medical conference attended 
by Dr. McKenna, who is a surgeon at Good Samaritan Hospital in Indianapolis. 
  What starts the conflict in motion is the boy Hank, who wanders up the 
aisle and accidentally pulls off the face veil of a Muslim woman.  As her 
angry husband confronts the McKennas, an English-speaking man intervenes.  
He clears up the confusion, and even suggests places for the McKennas to 
visit while they are in the exotic city.  The scene ends, the viewers aware 
of the backgrounds of the major characters, as well as of the possibility 
for danger in this very foreign place.
Here's where the suspense starts.  On the way to their hotel, Jo McKenna 
starts listing the personal information that her husband gave away during 
the conversation on the bus.  The helpful stranger ("Good Samaritan," 
n'est-ce pa?) is Louis Bernard, played by Daniel Gelin, and he knows a lot 
about these Americans.  To complicate matters more, the McKennas cross paths 
with an English couple, who are staying at the same hotel and who seem to be 
watching them.  Enter another player, a weasel-faced stranger who knocks on 
the McKennas' door, supposedly by mistake.  The stranger glimpses Bernard, 
though, inside the room.  The scene quickly ends with Bernard excusing 
himself from dinner with the McKennas;  the McKennas proceed to dinner only 
to become acquainted with the British couple - Mr. and Mrs. Drayton - whom 
Jo had thought was watching them.  Further, Bernard shows up at the same 
restaurant, accompanied by a beautiful woman!
The action still rising, the McKennas and the Draytons have somehow struck 
up the friendship of fellow tourists in a distant land.  In a public square, 
they watch acrobats and take in other wondrous sights (and Hitchcock makes 
his cameo as an onlooker).  When the police chase a fugitive through the 
streets, Mrs. Drayton must restrain Hank from getting too close to the 
action.  Dr. McKenna cannot help it, though, as a man who has been stabbed 
in the back collapses in the doctor's arms and whispers a last message.  
It's Louis Bernard, by the way, the makeup on his darkened face coming off 
in McKenna's hands.  The McKennas are questioned by the police, and the 
doctor receives a phone call: if he values Hank's life, he will not reveal 
to the police what the dying man told him.
It's only here that the climax begins to build.  Following the action from 
Morocco to England, the viewer hangs on through bits of comic relief and 
long periods of suspense.  Certainly a distinguishing mark of superior films 
is that they take risks of character and plot, and this one is not afraid to 
change venues, to endanger the people we care the most about, to mix crisp 
dialogue with intelligent direction and editing.
Part of what is so engaging about the story is the camera work, of course, 
as this is a Hitchcock piece.  Near the end there's an extended scene - 12 
minutes, 124 shots - with absolutely no dialogue, only the music played in 
the great hall in London.  The director does a masterful job of sustaining 
our interest, as Jo McKenna, and later her husband, watch the unfolding of 
the bizarre international intrigue.  Composer Bernard Hermann is actually 
the maestro conducting the orchestra:  just as his music serves so many 
other Hitchcock films so well, it literally reaches a crescendo of thrill in 
THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.
James Stewart is expert at tempering his seriousness with good humor.  Tom 
Hanks has been appropriately compared to Stewart, as both have shown 
remarkable versatility in dramatic and comic acting.  In the scene in the 
Marrakech restaurant, Stewart does a charming short shtick with his long 
legs, unable to fit them comfortably under the low table.  Bumbling actions 
like these contrast so cleanly with his dead-serious moments, when he 
threatens a self-important police inspector, for example.  Stewart is a bit 
too old for the part, but he plays the loving father and husband well, and 
no one of his generation was better at adapting his reactions to varying 
plot twists.  Stewart was the consummate Everyman.
Doris Day is one of Hitchcock's famous heroines.  Her Jo McKenna (or 
Josephine Conway, her professional name, replaced by her husband with the 
domestic "Jo") is sufficiently independent, although she has rather 
resentfully given up a singing career to be a wife and mother some 700 miles 
from New York City, where, she says sarcastically, the doctors are not 
starving.  The Cincinnati native also lends her voice to the story, in 
endearing scenes with her boy, singing "Whatever Will Be" a couple of times, 
including a performance crucial to the resolution of the painful situation 
at the end.
It is interesting to compare thrillers of this era with modern ones.  It's 
ironic that directors like Brian DePalma and Gus Van Sant pay homage to 
Hitchcock, but would never make entire films in the same tradition as the 
old master.  Because modern audiences would not pay to see such pacing and 
intricacy, directors in the twenty-first century will continue to concoct 
similar stories, but with break-neck action and expanded levels of 
depravity.  Only years of experience, in living as well as in 
movie-watching, reveal that age does not mean inferiority: Many of 
Hitchcock's films, as a lesson, are of much higher quality than most 
contemporary Hollywood products.  THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH  is not as 
well-known as VERTIGO or PSYCHO or REAR WINDOW, but it is essential material 
for fans of film and social history.
The rating printed on the video is PG, for one murder and another attempted 
one.  This movie is suitable for viewers nine and above, and would be 
available most readily in the video collections of public libraries.  It 
could also be found in the classic sections of video rental locations, as 
well as through online sites that sell new or used videos.

Review for Bug's Life, A (1998)
The State of Movie-going in Late 1998:  A Review of "A Bug's Life" and 
the Theater Showing It
November 26 - Thanksgiving Day.  On a visit to my in-laws', we drive out 
to the Showcase Cinemas, a ten-plex in the wilds of western Cincinnati.  
In the lobby the ticket counter seems to be closed, but I'm told to go 
to the one clear on the other side of the lobby.  It's a big place, with 
mammoth hype displays for A Bug's Life and the Rugrats movie, arcade 
games and ripoff fish-for-a-dinky prize games.  There's even a "Customer 
Service" counter that doubles as an outlet for movie merchandise, 
trinkets and polyester caps and twenty-dollar t-shirts.  
We're here for the 2:10 show, and I'm thinking good: bargain matinee 
prices, when I see the sign for $5 each.  That's OK, it's a family 
outing, my wife and I and our two kids, the first day of a four-day 
weekend from school.
We opt not to visit the array of refreshment counters:  this is a short 
film and, besides, we must save our appetites for my mother-in-law's 80 
pound turkey.  So the wallet does not take another hit for popcorn, or 
worse, 6-dollar-a-pound candy from plexiglass bins mounted on the wall.  
The carpet that covers the acreage of lobby and corridors leading to the 
auditoriums is gaudy, stuff you would never want in your house, even in 
the 1970's.  Outside each screen there's an electronic message board 
with abbreviated titles:  Enemy of State, Pig in City, Bugs Life (not 
only the syntax ruined, but the punctuation shot as well).  Ushers with 
tiny brooms and dustpans hang around the doorways and call to each 
other, occasionally eyeing the patrons suspiciously.  In our theater we 
are pleased to find the newer generation of chairs, ones that rock and 
hold your cup and pad your back and seat.  We sit on the end of a 
staggered row, so my daughter cannot be blocked by any tall, hat-wearing 
man.  As the lights dim we can see only the light-embedded plastic 
stripping that lines the aisles.
Then the previews, at least five of them, the last one the trailer for 
Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, the one my son has been longing to see.  
(After this last, Billy and his mother both get up as if to leave, the 
best part of their viewing over!)  Oh, and before the film starts, we 
are treated to that most rare aperitif, a cartoon!  It's Pixar's "Geri's 
Game," an award-winning animated short about an old man playing chess, 
against himself, on a table in an otherwise deserted park.  It's a 
delightful and sweet story, uncomplicated but thick with imagination, 
the kind of story Chekov or O. Henry would have loved to watch.
A Bug's Life is an entertaining film with a decent story and astounding 
computer-generated animation.  This is the best animation yet of this 
sort - the facial features of the ants and their rival grasshoppers 
possess the elasticity of real faces, and the expressions and body 
movements mimic actual motion without a hint of choppiness or other 
animated fraud.  It's quite an accomplishment for Pixar and all the 
women and men who worked on it.
Down to the slightest swaying of the trees, the animation is the real 
star of this show.  Everything is fun to look at, and I imagine one 
could pay to see A Bug's Life many times before taking in a good deal of 
the panorama of action and detail in every shot.  The colors are 
artfully chosen (even though it's unclear to me why the ants' bodies are 
bluish gray);  they are tones that occur in nature, with a few bright 
bugs and a bird thrown in for vividness.  Even though I saw Toy Story 
twice at the cinema and countless times on video, I am still getting 
used to viewing this type of animation:  I feel like turning to my kids 
and saying, "In my day we were lucky to have color in our cartoons, and 
your grandpa was lucky to have sound!"  In short, the film gives us a 
visual banquet of images, and I wouldn't be averse to returning for more 
helpings.
John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton are the directors, and they have done a 
fine job with perspectives and pace.  Lasseter and Don McEnery wrote the 
screenplay, which includes generous amounts of humor.  What's cool is 
that you can pick and choose among the humorous moments, according to 
your age.  There are takes on all the bug jokes you can think of, 
there's plenty of slapstick (literally!), and there are even a few 
cerebral pokes, such as the shtick involved with German accents (the 
caterpillar Heimlich) and with a queen ant assisted by Phyllis Diller's 
entire routine - a "Fang"-like old guy, a small dog-like aphid, and 
Diller's precious voice and laugh.  
The plot is successful but not as strong as other aspects.  We see the 
independent thinking Flik (voice of Dave Foley), an ant who has broken 
away from the ranks and invented a device to make harvesting easier.  
Although he is sharp and well-intentioned, Flik is also dense enough to 
repeatedly endanger the colony.  He is known to the royal family, and 
quickly falls in love with the queen's daughter Atta (voice of Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus).  When Flik accidentally ruins the food the ants have 
gathered for the mean grasshoppers, the colony is faced with gathering 
twice as much food, or facing the wrath of the larger insects as soon as 
the last leaf falls.  When autumn comes we are set up for the showdown, 
and it is an engaging one to watch.  
If you saw even a trailer for DreamWorks' Antz, do the plot elements of 
A Bug's Life seem nearly identical?  I have purposely forgotten many of 
the details surrounding the genesis of Antz, the premise perhaps coming 
along with an executive from Disney to the newer studio.  But Disney has 
a right to be upset at the derivative nature of the film that was begun 
later but released earlier.  It is difficult to say which is the better 
film.  I have already declared Pixar's animation superior.  As far as 
target audiences, A Bug's Life is more appropriate for children.  Not 
that Antz doesn't work for kids - it's just that in many ways it is a 
vehicle for Woody Allen, who does the voice of an neurotic ant who bucks 
the system, falls in love with the princess, and saves the colony.  Antz 
has a greater number of jokes that Mom and Dad would enjoy.  
My call is that Antz owns the edge for voices.  Gene Hackman, the 
inimitable Christopher Walken, Sylvester Stallone, Allen - these actors 
lend their character voices that are quirky, unique and memorable.  
Outstanding talents in A Bug's Life include Diller, David Hyde Pierce as 
Slim the walking stick, and John Ratzenberger as the circus-owning flea.  
Other actors do a very adequate job, but fail to go over-the-top in a 
way that makes you chuckle just to remember the funny dimension to a 
voice itself.  For instance, why didn't Lasseter have Louis-Dreyfus to 
an Elaine-ism, crying, "Get out!" and pushing Flik backwards?  Where are 
Andy Devine, June Foray and Sterling Holloway when you need them?
An aside:  you must stay for the closing credits.  Randy Newman sings 
one of his funky songs (why didn't you do more with lyrics, Randy?);  
and there are belly laugh-inducing outtakes that are well worth being 
last to leave the theater.
My children claim not to like one film better than the other.  I would 
as soon sit through Antz a second time.  But for pure visual enjoyment, 
A Bug's Life is beautiful.  I recommend you find a reasonably priced 
theater, smuggle in Reese's Cups and Twizzlers, and share an afternoon 
with the kids in your life.

Review for Saboteur (1942)
In SABOTEUR, Alfred Hitchcock was warming up for his later masterworks such 
as NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  Not that SABOTEUR cannot stand by itself as the work 
of an expert.  It's just that the pacing is a little off, and the story asks 
us to suspend our disbelief a few too many times.
Robert Cummings is a very competent hero.  In some scenes in this film, he 
comes close to the nonchalance that James Stewart brought to many Hitchcock 
works.  Of course a problem for modern viewers may be this nonchalance.  
Because the era that bred SABOTEUR featured low-key performances, modern 
audiences may succumb to the ever-present boredom caused by anything without 
a frenetic pace or overwrought acting.  Cummings does not play Barry Kane 
with an emotional bent fashioned by some method-acting ranter; rather, he 
skips from problem to problem with typical mid-century stoicism.  What needs 
to be done will be done, one can imagine Cummings saying in an interview.
The premise of the film surfaces in many Hitchcock films.  An innocent man  
Barry Kane --  is accused of setting a fire to a factory that produces 
aircraft for the American war effort.  What's worse, he's thought to have 
handed his best buddy an extinguisher filled with gasoline.  The buddy 
perishes.  What's the rub?  A mysterious character named Fry (Norman Lloyd) 
is the actual saboteur, but only Kane and his dead friend had contact with 
this nasty, fox-like man.  Soon Kane is on the lam from the law.  As in THE 
FUGITIVE, Kane compounds his legal troubles by escaping: he must be so 
thoroughly convinced that he will take the rap for this heinous crime of 
sabotage, treason and murder, that he determines to set off on his own to 
find Fry and anyone backing him.
On the way, Kane finds refuge in the house of a blind man  who cannot see 
Kane's handcuffs but somehow senses everything.  This man's niece soon 
enters, and though her uncle instructs her to accompany Kane to a 
locksmith's to remove the cuffs, she (Priscilla Lane as Patricia Martin).  
Kane adds kidnapping to his legion of infractions, apparently trusting that 
everything will turn out in the end.  (Of course, part of Hitchcock's genius 
was in getting everything to turn out satisfactorily for his audiences; he 
certainly knew what viewers of his time demanded.)   More complications 
ensue, and we spot countless Hitchcockian trademarks  wealthy and respected 
criminal masterminds, ingenues in jeopardy, American icons used to support 
suspenseful plot twists.
I think part of the contrived feeling of the plot is the artifice used to 
set up some of the climactic situations.  Exactly why would a saboteur tour 
the Statue of Liberty after he has damaged an American warship as it 
launched?  Would anyone but a 40's film heroine endanger herself by trying 
to delay or trap this ruthless criminal, and would anyone but the hero try 
to save this selfsame criminal as he hangs from the hand of Lady Liberty?  
These people are apparently moral to the core.  A minor and interesting 
agenda involves a further boost to the common man: a truck driver who gives 
Kane a ride early in his flight from justice surfaces later to assist him in 
escaping from the very clutches of the cops.  It's almost as if Hitchcock is 
cheering the proletariat, while the monied ne'er-do-wells scheme and plot 
for the downfall of the war effort, and perhaps even control of the country. 
  (There are definite undercurrents here that attack fascism)
Nevertheless, we see some stunning camera work and memorable images.  
Everything Hitchcock touched was in some way artificial, from the California 
mountains to the massive statue at the end  painted backdrops within 
studios, or smaller-than-life models. But the use this director makes of his 
props is amazing.
Perhaps the pace of the film could be tighter in scenes, but every scene 
does seem necessary.  There is even some top-notch comic relief  coming 
mostly when Kane and Martin are saved from a police search by a caravan full 
of circus performers.
Pricilla Lane does a very smooth job as Patricia Martin, the headstrong 
niece of an eminently decent blind man.  A pity she did not get more roles: 
her acting talents might have made her a household name.
For fans of Hitchcock, SABOTEUR is a must-see.  It clearly foreshadows his 
later successes with big names like Cary Grant and James Stewart and Doris 
Day.  And the changes of scenery show that he was a filmmaker on the move, 
unafraid to use location shots mixed with rear projection and studio 
fakeries.

Review for Mulan (1998)
One hears and reads opinions and statistics about Walt Disney Pictures.  
THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) was a watershed film, recharging the animation 
division.  THE LION KING (1994) grossed over $300 million.  The entries 
of the last two summers, however, disappointed both critics and Disney's 
money-counters.
There's no telling yet about MULAN'S box office, but for my money it's 
the best entry since BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (1991).  
The legend on which the story is based is a masterful choice.  It avoids 
familiar, sexist lore;  it stresses the strengths and determination of a 
young heroine;  it even goes out of its way to avoid the formulaic 
treacle typical of Disney.
Though the narrative begins with action  a herd of Huns overrunning the 
Great Wall  it spends the next several minutes exposing and developing 
characters.  We meet minor figures like Mulan's grandmother, and the 
family dog "Little Brother," both of whom are used for comic relief.  
There is also a little cricket:  it's no Jiminy, but it does have a mute 
charm akin to the dog-like carpet's in ALADDIN.  But the character that 
casts his influence upon the rest of the film is Zhou, Mulan's father.
An aging, dignified and prayerful man, Zhou receives a conscription 
notice send by the Emperor .  One male from each family must fight the 
invading hordes.  Observing her father's ineffectual attempt to swing 
his long-closeted sword, Mulan makes the crucial decision of the film's 
premise.  She cuts off her hair, dons her father's armor, gallops off on 
her black stallion, Khan.  Zhou charges out of the house and falls in a 
rain puddle, horrified, of course, at his daughter's smashing of 
tradition and honor.  Voiced expertly by Soon-Tek Oh, Zhou appears again 
only briefly, at the far end of the tale;  but he proves to be a 
quick-forgiving father, causing many tears to spill, I am sure, from 
viewers' eyes.
Another laudable aspect of the film is that its characters are drawn 
consistently.  Way back when Snow White and her Prince moved with the 
grace of their human models, while the dwarves cavorted like the 
buffoonish caricatures they were, we witnessed the gap Disney pictures' 
animation style.  Look at Cinderella versus her step-sisters, even at 
Belle and her eccentric, barrel-like father.  No, the plain beauty of 
Mulan does not contrast strongly with the supporting roles.  Captain Li 
Shang (voice of B. D. Wong), Mulan's would-be love interest, does not 
differ strikingly from the other males in the story.  The Huns are an 
exception;  they are demonized through lack of development and through 
Neanderthal bulkiness.  Miguel Ferrer, in his role of Shan-Yu, creates 
the most velvety and threatening male voice since Robbie Benson's Beast.
MULAN is strongest in the story of its heroine's quest.  Although the 
film is too short to be considered picaresque in nature, we watch Mulan 
meet and conquer many obstacles, from training to rejection as a 
meddlesome female.  She is certainly a dynamic character, a strong woman 
who does not spend her time waiting to be rescued.  Instead, she 
conceives the rescue schemes.  
I find it remarkable that MULAN can be criticized as though it were a 
live-action drama.  I was so caught up in the exposition that, when 
Eddie Murphy's dragon, the strutting sidekick Mushu, appeared, I felt a 
disturbing change in tone.  Then I remembered the audience.  This was a 
kids' picture that adults could enjoy too.  Along with Mushu, I admired 
the portrayal of Mulan's ancestors.  George Takei does nicely as Number 
1 Ancestor.  He leads a cast of ghosts that tells us a great deal about 
Chinese tradition.  A film 88 minutes long cannot do justice to such a 
culture;  however, we spy customs, dress, art and even some musical cues 
that serve as a thorough short course on that time.
Watching some scenes in MULAN  specifically the ones aided by computer 
digitalization  I was reminded of the racing introduction of THE 
RESCUERS DOWN UNDER and the dancing scene of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  When 
Shan-Yu appeared atop a snow-covered hill,  the horizon high in the shot 
to show the immense width of the landscape, I experienced the awe 
induced usually by the cinematography of war epics.  And when the Hun 
leader and his legions of mounted warriors commenced to cascade down the 
snow-covered mountain, I felt the slight but pleasurable vertigo evoked 
by carefully-placed cameras.  This animation is indeed top-notch.
The music accomplishes the main task of songs that appear in musicals:  
their lyrics further the plot.  That's all.  The numbers are not bad, 
just unremarkable.  I doubt even the Stevie Wonder song that accompanies 
the credits will receive much play on the radio.  
In future viewings  my daughter has already asserted that we will 
purchase the video  I will try to spot the twisted humor of animators, 
jokes like "SEX" spelled out in the dust and blown leaves of THE LION 
KING.  The silliest gag I noticed is the casting of Harvey Fierstein as 
a macho soldier who asks, late in the film, if his dress makes him look 
fat!
Because of Fu Zhou and his loving relationship with his daughter, it was 
all the more pleasant to catch MULAN on Father's Day weekend, its 
opening date.  My family was thankful for a G-rated film as summer 
began.  I understand other studios have noticed the scarcity of good 
family entertainment too.  But with MULAN, the best of Disney is back.

Review for Rush Hour (1998)
The funniest moments in Jackie Chan's American movie Rush Hour happen 
when cultures clash.  
There's a scene in which impetuous Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) 
points his pistol at wise Hong Kong Inspector Lee (Chan).  Watching the 
gun-happy could-be crooks, a cabbie pulls out a gun of his own and makes 
them freeze.
There's Lee's conflict with FBI agents, who get Carter assigned to 
actually keep Lee off the case.  The premise of the film, of course, 
relies on the failure of Carter's baby-sitting;  the action becomes 
hilarious when Lee gets away from Carter and outwits a houseful of 
federal agents.
Finally, there's the running joke of the Chinese detective who is 
repeatedly confused by African-American culture.  The audience gets many 
chuckles from the initial tension between the two cops.  Whatever 
egotistic ruse Carter tries out, Lee thwarts or shames or betters him.  
Chan is at his best when his comic skills run on naiveté;  it's even 
better when his innocence gets him into big trouble, as it does in a 
pool hall.  Oh, how quickly Chan charms us with humor and veers into 
well-choreographed violence!
The reason Inspector Lee visits the States is to assist in a kidnapping 
case: the daughter of the Chinese Consul Han (Tzi Ma) has been taken. 
What's moving is that Lee takes the crime somewhat personally; he's like 
an uncle to her, good-naturedly taking punches from the girl as she 
departs China.  It is Lee's connection as strong family friend that 
motivates his relentless battling of kidnappers as well as other 
officers.
Tom Wilkinson does a passable job in his role, though his character 
could have been made more round.  As the evil Sang, Ken Leung combines 
the right amount of sour stares and shakiness;  he's also a horrible 
shot with a machine pistol.  It's unclear why Elizabeth Pena appears as 
a partner - and sometime foil - to Tucker's loud-mouthed Carter.   She 
is always likable, but here fails to convince us she is a demolitions 
expert.
Jackie Chan's closing credits usually show out-takes from the shooting.  
Once again we get an idea about how rigorously the cast worked to 
produce the slick and athletic mayhem that is a trademark of Jackie 
Chan.  How many takes were needed to produce the fight in the Chinese 
restaurant?  In the abandoned building?  Did Jackie break or sprain 
anything during the shoot, we wonder?  
Originality is the key element in these slugfest sagas; let's face it, 
plots in Chan films can be found in Kojak or Beretta episodes.  But 
director Brett Ratner has created a film with smooth transitions and 
spots of characterization that actually make us care about Lee and 
Carter and some of the people they work with.  In seeing Rush Hour, what 
gave me my money's worth?  First, my son and I had the theater to 
ourselves.  OK, it was a small auditorium, but still it was like viewing 
a video on an extra large private screen.  Bottom line, I laughed out 
loud at Jackie's over-the-top stunts and martial arts gimmicks.  The man 
knows the power of exaggeration, and he knows that the audience is smart 
enough not to take him too seriously.


Title
Review for Sixth Sense, The (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Sure, "The Sixth Sense" has its share of clichés, but it is also one of the 
more original and thought-provoking horror dramas to appear in years.  If 
you use movies purely for entertainment, then this one is not for you.
Young writer and director M. Night Shyamalan paces the story well, with a 
romantic opening scene followed by a tense scene upon which the weight of 
the movie eventually rests.  In fact the movie has a habit of calming the 
viewer with a slow scene - though never a boring one - followed by a 
sequence that is fast-paced or even harrowing.
Bruce Willis has chosen his part well this time.  He plays Dr. Malcolm 
Crowe, a Philadelphia-based child psychologist who has just received an 
award from the mayor's office.  Apparently he has put everything in his life 
second to his career, and perhaps he and wife Anna (Olivia Williams) will 
grow closer now.  Enter the harrowing scene.  Upstairs, Anna discovers a 
broken window and articles of clothing shed in a path to the bathroom.  
Malcolm peers inside to see a violently disturbed man wearing only a pair of 
briefs.  Shivering, this stranger confronts Malcolm, crying out "You failed 
me!" and revealing himself as a former patient of Malcolm's.  Played 
convincingly by Donnie Wahlberg, this intruder raises a pistol and shoots 
Malcolm, and then turns the gun on himself.
The next scene opens "The Next Fall," a long shot of a tree-lined street of 
South Philly rowhouses filling the frame.  We see Malcolm spying on a boy 
about nine years old.  This boy, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is troubled 
with a variety of symptoms.  The first scene between doctor and patient 
happens in an empty Catholic church, Cole lining up his toy figures in one 
of the pews.  The relationship continues with a small degree of reluctance 
on Cole's part:  he does not wish to reveal his "secret," that which lies at 
the heart of his being afraid.
We know from the salvos of trailers that Cole sees "dead people."  He has a 
bizarre knack of knowing the history of the old building in which he attends 
school.  He knows, and reveals in anger, the nickname of his teacher.  What 
seems to be troubling Cole more than the visions themselves is his inability 
to cope with them.  His loving single mom Lynn (Toni Collette) tolerates the 
boy's vagaries, and prays they will get along on her two jobs.  Meanwhile, 
Dr. Malcolm Crowe continues to meet with Cole and, it seems, always visits 
Cole for these meetings; we never see the psychologist's office.
Viewing this movie I found the subplot between Malcolm and Anna Crowe to be 
scant and rather unsatisfying.  There's the scene in which Malcolm arrives 
late at a fancy restaurant, and Anna ignores him, paying for her dinner and 
whispering, "Happy Anniversary, Malcolm" before she leaves him sitting 
there.  Later Malcolm seems oddly detached when a younger man from Anna's 
workplace begins to show interest in her.  To what is this all leading?
Some of the most chilling scenes in memory surface in Cole's hauntings.  He 
is petrified of the ghost that confront him;  they have even physically 
abused him in their anger.  One early teenage boy walks out of Cole's room 
and beckons Cole to follow, saying, "C'mon, I'll show you where my dad keeps 
his guns."  When he turns around we see the bloody pulp of the back of his 
head.  To what is all this leading?
Both plots are headed toward an ending that will shock you and cause you to 
think for hours afterward.
One of the reasons the movie succeeds is Haley Joel Osment.  This 
experienced young actor seems to have his own special method of making his 
character believable.  When he crawls into the makeshift tent in his room - 
his refuge filled with stolen holy statues - the horrid nightmares of 
childhood flood back to us, too.  In fact this boy possesses an amazing 
endurance, hiding the heart of his affliction from his mother, postponing 
telling his doctor until a moment after the doctor tells his own secrets to 
the boy.  An Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor would not be out of 
order for Osment.
And perhaps a Best Actor Nomination should come for Willis.  He shows 
admirable restraint here, as in the scene where he comes home to an immense 
empty house, climbs the stairs to the bedroom to find Anna in the shower.  
Turning slightly he spots a bottle of Zoloft anti-depressant in the medicine 
cabinet.  He is surprised, and apparently so numbed that he merely drifts 
out of the room and the house.  In no place does Willis overact or deliver 
an unconvincing response.
Olivia Williams is poignant as Anna Crowe, although the script calls for 
her, necessarily, only a few times.  (Williams is, I might point out, a good 
ten years or so younger than Willis, continuing Hollywood's trend of young 
woman/older man)  As Cole's mother Lynn, Toni Collette gets more screen 
time, and comes off as a realistic, confused parent.  Especially moving is 
her reaction when Cole finally reveals what's up with him.
The film is full of various types of imagery, many of the scenes opening 
with shots of statues and sculptures around Philadelphia.  Add this to the 
somewhat gothic houses and school buildings inhabited by the characters - 
living and dead - and the effect is fascinatingly morbid.  The location 
scouts did their jobs well, and I'm sure Willis felt at home during the 
shooting, only a few miles distant from his native Pennsgrove, across the 
river in South Jersey.  I was also struck by the original use of videos in 
the story, in the recurring wedding tape watched by Anna, as well as the 
tape that acts as a revelation to a grieving father.
Sidney the psychiatrist in the television version of "MASH" said once that 
the real battlefields are the kitchen, the bedroom, the school yard, and 
that's what we see here, characters valiantly facing the wars that uproot 
their lives.  The devastation here is all in the mind, and M. Night 
Shyamalan - who appears in a cameo as Dr. Hill, who suspects Lynn of abusing 
Cole - manipulates both the medium and the genre with expertise.


Title
Review for Beloved (1998)
In her 1988 novel Beloved, Toni Morrison mints the word "rememory."  
Although Jonathan Demme's film does not make use of the word, its 
connections are there, reminding us that memories are what we're made 
of;  more insistently, they are what we cannot escape from.
The film stands as a personal history of pain inflicted by slavery and 
by hatred built against blacks during the Reconstruction era.  The 
product is part romance, part ghost tale, part indictment of American 
society 100 years after some of its citizens declared themselves free.  
The person at the center is Sethe (pronounced SET-ta and played by Oprah 
Winfrey).  We meet her and what's left of her family in 1865, just a few 
years after their traumatic flight from slavery.  Her children include 
boys Howard and Buglar, their younger sister Denver and, disturbingly, 
the menacing ghost of another daughter, Beloved.  Until the time of her 
death as an infant, the baby had been called "crawling already?".  Now, 
in the 1870's, Beloved is terrorizing the family, injuring the dog "Here 
Boy" and causing her brothers to stuff a rucksack full of food and run 
off.
Almost as unsettling as the flashback in which the baby dies, the scenes 
of her poltergeist-like violence grip the viewer.  Demme directs them 
with a rapid pace.  It's a relief that they end only a few minutes into 
the film, when Paul D (Danny Glover) enters and puts up an angry 
resistance.  The kitchen has been destroyed (in the book it takes Paul 
weeks to mend the furniture) but the manifestations are apparently gone.  
Despite resentment from Denver (Kimberly Elise), Paul D stays and 
develops a relationship with Sethe.  His presence is like a redemption 
after 18 years of wandering and fleeing and witnessing the degradation 
of other blacks.  Perhaps Paul's romance with Sethe begins through their 
common ties: they were owned by a brutal Kentuckian known as 
"schoolteacher"; but the most peaceful time in the film follows the two 
old friends' falling in love.
It's been ten years since the first stages of the film's production - 
since the book won Morrison the Pulitzer (later she received the Nobel 
Prize in Literature, the first African American woman so recognized).  
As one of the producers, Winfrey no doubt had strong creative control.  
One of the results is the brilliant casting.  First, Winfrey herself 
sketches Sethe with a character and strength that is almost 
indestructible.  Her role in The Color Purple showed us her canny and 
solid screen presence, and this film makes us realize the scarcity of 
her roles since.  Winfrey endows Sethe with just the right ways, her 
stares knowing, her gestures purposeful, her words picked to both assert 
and guard her spirit.  In a scene outside the restaurant where she 
works, Sethe is flattered that Paul has come to pick her up.  Instantly 
her expression turns to consternation when she suspects Paul will 
announce he is leaving her, and just as easily she beams when Paul says, 
"I want you pregnant!"  The face of a lesser actress could not 
accomplish such a range.
As the title character, Thandie Newton delivers a startling performance.  
>From the time she tramps out of a creek, dressed in dark colors and new 
shoes, and collapses on the bank to sleep, she lends a creepy presence 
to the story.  Beetles engulf her as we hear the rasp of her snore.  
Later she turns up in front of Sethe's house, propped scarecrow-like --  
a turning point.  What is not clear is why Sethe does not realize that 
here is a living wraith, the incarnation of the child that previously 
haunted the house and their lives, making them a family of outcasts even 
among blacks.  The young woman - she appears as the age she would be in 
life - croaks out the letters in her name, but it is not until later 
that Sethe's daughter Denver realizes the stranger's identity.  In her 
portrayal of Beloved, Newton is appropriately clumsy and regressive in 
speech: she's reminiscent of those who have been aroused from a coma and 
act much less than their age.
After seeing Danny Glover as Paul D. Garner, it's hard to imagine any 
other actor in the role.  He brings a veteran instinct that telegraphs 
the story's direction clearly.  At times gentle, swaggering, aggressive, 
disillusioned, Paul D leaves his mark as a man who cares and who accepts 
the responsibilities he lays out for himself.  Because Paul is so 
straightforward and strong, we are all the more disheartened when the 
creature from beyond his world mesmerizes him.  Is Beloved carrying out 
a sort of revenge for Paul's ousting her possessive spirit?  Among the 
most riveting patterns in the plot are the scenes in which Paul finds 
himself repulsed by sleeping in Sethe's room; he moves to a rocking 
chair to an empty bed in a spare room, to a shed across the back field.  
It's here that we see the consummation of the second hellish scene to 
take place in the shed. 
Baby Suggs is one of Toni Morrison's most memorable characters.  She is 
the mother of Halle, one of the Sweet Home slaves owned by Mr. Garner.  
Halle has worked extra to buy his mother and send her north, across the 
Ohio River to Cincinnati.  Morrison is masterful in showing how 
slaveowners were oblivious to the humanity of their captives.  Even 
though he is one of the more humane owners, Garner is not aware of Baby 
Suggs' name; he calls her "Jenny Whitlow" from her original sale papers.  
In the film, Beah Richards achieves the right status of nurturerer and 
prophet.  Grandma Baby, Sethe's mother-in-law and Denver's grandmother, 
preaches atop a rock in the woods, bringing her listeners wisdom and 
hope.  She is called "holy" in the book, and proved so in the film.  
"Love your flesh" and "Kiss your hands," she intones, and we see more of 
the body imagery that spreads throughout the work.  
As Denver, Kimberly Elise also shows a variety of moods.  Hateful toward 
Paul D, protective of her reclaimed big sister, finally mature at the 
end, Denver's story ends happily.  In a namesake role - Amy Denver, who 
delivers Sethe's child beneath the surface of the Ohio (again, water 
images) - Kessia Randall is perfectly talkative and compassionate.  And 
as Stamp Paid - another of Morrison's wonderful names - Albert Hall 
plays well as an ex-slave who delivers Sethe to Baby, and who later 
delivers a revelation to Paul D.
Because Morrison's novel is not a linear narrative, the film resorts to 
a risky series of flashbacks.  These slices of past lives, many of them 
disconcerting in their depiction of abuse and murder, are shot in grainy 
and incandescent tones, helping us to distinguish them from the main 
plotline.  Even though some of the scenes resemble bad videotape, the 
craftsmanship of storytelling has to be admired.  The soundtrack is also 
remarkable, made up of period instruments, voices, and curiously 
effective sounds of insects and birds.
The film's astonishing content does not quite fill its nearly three 
hours.  Editing down the last quarter of the story would have made for 
tighter composition.  No matter how riveting the story, viewers have 
time to look at their watches, an indication of a saggy pace.
Why the filmmakers shot the bulk of the film around Philadelphia instead 
of Cincinnati, I don't know.  The city locations grab our eyes, after so 
much of the story is told around Sethe's farmhouse.  Names like 
"Shillito's", an early Cincinnati department store, show the attention 
to detail paid by the set designers.  We are treated to vistas of the 
muddy Ohio, the distant sky beclouded by industrial smoke.  A hog 
capital before Chicago, Cincinnati is seen as a typical heartland town.  
Very appropriate, considering Morrison adapted a story that appeared in 
the January 29 and 30 editions of the Cincinnati Enquirer.  The model 
for Sethe was Margaret Garner, a 23 year-old who joined fugitive slaves 
from two farms south of Covington, Kentucky.  The real-life Stamp Paid 
was probably Elijah Kite, an ex-slave who assisted in the Underground 
Railroad.  The Bodwins are given a brief part in the film;  their 
counterpart was Levi Coffin, a Quaker storeowner who was the "president" 
of the Railroad.  Morrison also preserves the number of Margaret's 
children:  Samuel, 5, Thomas, 6, Mary, 3 (the ill-fated Beloved in the 
book), and Silla, a 3 month-old boy.  The Garners' owner was Archibald 
Gaines, part of the dreaded posse that tracked them down.
Considering how important it is to know one's history, it would be good 
if every American citizen were to see Beloved.  Whereas so many films 
are useless, Beloved proves itself a useful part of our culture.  For 
those interested in researching their ancestry, it is difficult to find 
information farther back than a few generations.  How infinitely more 
difficult to discover the identity of relations who were slaves.  
Beloved is also important as a genealogical study of pain and healing.

Review for Wild Wild West (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
As a boy I looked forward to "The Willd, Wild West" on Friday evenings;  
after a busy week of grade school, it was a cool way to begin the weekend.  
Even cooler were the gadgets produced by Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) and 
the swagger of Jim West (Robert Conrad).
"Wild,Wild West" is the latest movie revival of a classic TV show.  So for 
fans of the campy series of 1975-70, the origin alone makes it a must-see.  
As a film divorced from its thirty-something ancestor, it is just better 
than average.  In this incarnation, Will Smith plays James West, and Kevin 
Kline is Artie Gordon.
One thing the movie does well is preserve the edgy friendship between West 
and Gordon.  Just as Bob Conrad was younger than Ross Martin, Will Smith is 
several years' Kevin Kline's junior.  In one scene they play the comic 
counterparts of The Defiant Ones, linked together by Dr. Loveless' deadly 
magnets instead of by chains.  The scene is hilarious, containing the wit, 
timing and physical comedy of two experienced actors.  Even at the end, when 
the new Secret Service agents are friends, there is the bite of competition 
between them
Premise:  The world isn't safe because of the devilish Dr. Arliss Loveless 
(Kenneth Branaugh).  Cut in half in the Civil War, Loveless has resurfaced 
in 1869 with a plot to use his evil technology to take control of the United 
States, and divide it up between himself and the empires that formerly 
occupied North America - England, France, and Spain.  An associate of 
Loveless', a former Confederate general called "Bloodbath" McGrath, the 
Butcher of Libertyville, leads the heroes to Loveless.  President Grant, who 
commissioned West and Gordon to track down the arch-villain, is himself put 
in grave danger when Loveless puts to use a terrible engine of war.  The 
machine is a Gargantuan metal spider, its legs supporting a body occupied by 
sophisticated furnaces and pulleys and a cockpit captained by Loveless and 
his vampy sidekicks.
All these elements combine to make "Wild, Wild West" into an action 
period-piece with very watchable special effects.  Besides the tank-spider, 
Loveless uses an amphibious ironclad, a way-advanced wheel chair (which 
highlights the effects that take away Branaugh's legs), and a murderous 
propelled saw blade that tracks down its victims, who wear a magnetic 
collar.  Of course Artie Gordon has his own arsenal of martial gimmicks.  
All of them are introduced early in the narrative, James Bond-style, and 
utilized later.  The tamest perhaps is a pistol smaller than a Derringer;  
the weirdest is a human head used as a projector, with Artie discovering the 
last image (burned into the retinas) seen by the victim.  In all, the film 
blends special effects quite well with the action that surrounds them.
As James West, Will Smith has been discussed as an unusual choice.  (George 
Clooney was first offered the role, with Smith as Artemus Gordon.)  Because 
of his versatility, though, Smith pulls it off.  He is fast-talking and 
-punching, and what adds an interesting dimension to his situation is the 
script's use of racial humor.  I have not yet decided if the film makes too 
much mention of Smith's race, but I admire Smith and director Barry 
Sonnenfeld, as well as the screenwriting team, for attempting this risk.  A 
couple of times, the African-American James West uses Stepin Fetchit 
stereotypes, before resorting to his considerable skills, to escape tricky 
situations.  One scene, when a mob tries to lynch West for tapping a woman's 
breasts, falls far short of Cleavon Little in "Blazing Saddles."  It's 
engaging, though, when West and Loveless exchange hateful puns, West 
attacked for being black, and Loveless for being "half a man."
Kevin Kline delivers another seamless performance, getting into the part of 
Artie Gordon with good humor.  A master of disguise, inventor of ingenious 
weaponry, factotum of the highest order, Gordon is very likable, and Kline's 
comic sense puts Gordon just the right amount over-the-top.  At various 
times this sharp U. S. marshal masquerades as a buxom woman and President 
Grant.  (After 'Dave', it's the second flick that's given Kline a chance to 
play a president and his double!)
Salma Hayek plays Rita Escobar, who appears first as a caged playmate of 
Loveless'.  After Gordon liberates her, Rita reveals she is the daughter of 
one the scientists kidnapped by Loveless to design and build the monster 
spider.  She accompanies the two agents throughout most of their hi-jinx.  
Though Hayek is a solid actress and easy to look at, she is used mainly for 
decoration here, her function to cause conflict between potential boyfriends 
West and Gordon.
In smaller roles, Ted Levine plays a grimy, disgusting, head-injured General 
McGrath.  M. Emmet Walsh plays a cagey train engineer who transports the 
agents about on "The Wanderer,"a train loaded with one-of-a-kind gimmickry.  
Walsh has been around films and television a long time, and has a memorable 
character actor face;  his performance is strong here, especially in his 
reactions to double-entendres exchanged by West and Gordon.
By now Barry Sonnenfeld has a famous relationship with Will Smith;  he's 
even called Smith a 'co-director.'  Sonnenfeld controls the pace well, 
except many scenes follow each other too quickly, editor Jim Miller relying 
too much on two-second establishing shots.
Set decoration is marvelous, with each interior showing a Victorian rococo 
style.  Loveless' wheelchair, for instance, sports the metal scrollwork seen 
atop the fancy smokestacks of riverboats.  Walls of saloons and the White 
House are equally intricate.  The exteriors rely on the breath-taking vistas 
of the West - one half of the meaning of the title, after all.
A shortcoming is that the plot is a bit too straight-forward.  It seems to 
lack the complications, both in sublplots and in character development, 
needed for depth.  Jim West's personal stake in doing away with McGrath and 
Loveless is a bit hard to swallow as well.  What amounts to a one-act chase 
scene is what the viewer sees, though it makes for a pleasurable watching.  
There's a good deal of the charming camp I spied first in the television 
series, but there's also the late nineties language and innuendo that makes 
this a strict PG-13.  Watch it with a teenager today.

Review for Babe: Pig in the City (1998)
A Pig in the City picks up where Babe left off, with Arthur Hoggett 
(James Cromwell) quietly accepting a trophy for his champion sheepdog, 
er, pig.  He hugs his wife, turns down myriad offers for public 
appearances, and falls down a well, sustaining injuries that put him out 
of most of the movie.  
This is the first risk taken by the sequel, and it's one of many reasons 
why A Pig in the City is so successful.
The storybook qualities are still here: along with the Hoggetts' 
generously thatched cottage, we see a quirky hotel housing two humans 
and a menagerie of animals.  The landscapes are still beautiful and 
cozy, skies glowing like canvases by N. C. Wyeth.  Of course the animals 
talk. And the city of the title is "just to the left of the twentieth 
century," its landmarks icons from real cities -- the Seattle Space 
Needle, the "Hollywood" letters, the Eiffel Tower, the Sydney Opera 
House (the film was shot in Australia, after all).  Accordingly, the 
sets, costumes and lighting accentuate the magical effects.
What is so remarkable about this sequel is that it differs so much from 
Babe.  Yes, many of the same characters are here - indeed, I wanted more 
of the taciturn Hoggett, the sheepdogs Fly and Rex, and others - but 
this new zoo of a cast is just as charming, and even more uproarious in 
its adventures.  This film proves that strong sequels, and installments 
of series films, rely only briefly on their original incarnations, and 
stand on their own as solid and engaging stories.
Because Mr, Hoggett is laid up and the bank is threatening foreclosure, 
Mrs. Hoggett brainstorms and decides to travel to the city for a grand 
state fair.  There she will display "Pig," which is Babe's name to 
humans, and receive enough money to save the farm.  As the two board a 
plane that heads into the sky, there are captivating scenes of Ferdinand 
the duck (voice of Danny Mann) in hot pursuit, asking advice from a 
flock of wise pelicans.  When she is detained at the airport, Mrs. 
Hoggett not only misses the state fair but fails to locate a hotel that 
will accept her particular type of pet.  In the face of a stranger who 
tells her of a lodging where she and Babe/Pig will be safe, we see a 
motif that contributes again and again to the humor of the story.  
Another artifice surfaces when Mrs. Hoggett stumbles a second time into 
trouble with the law, leaving Babe alone with animals that at first seem 
menacing but turn out charming.  The bulk of the plot involves Babe's 
relationships with the animals that inhabit, in violation of city 
ordinances, this storybook hotel.  Will the creatures be saved from the 
animal control agency that evicts them?  Will Babe ever reunite with 
Esme Cordelia Hoggett, let alone with Arthur?
As Mrs. Hoggett, Magda Szubanski is outstanding.  In the original she 
was so much set decoration, a prudish Mrs. Sprat who talks two miles a 
minute and concerns herself with fattening the protagonist for 
Christmas.  In this story we see her determination developed and focused 
on those keeping her apart from Babe and from her husband.  She is 
wonderfully game in going after the endangered animals, paired with the 
drink-of-water woman (Mary Stein) who owns the hotel.  And when she dons 
an inflatable clown suit and bounces all over a ballroom in pursuit of 
Babe, we enjoy a series of belly laughs.  This was my son's favorite 
scene.
My daughter's favorite part involves a chimp named Zootie (Glenne 
Headley).  She is the mate of a punkish chimp voiced by the comedian 
Steven Wright.  Both lend their characters quirky and likable 
personalities.  Moreover, the animal actors perform memorably.  Along 
with the chimps there are multitudinous dogs (one with wheels for back 
legs, a creature that nearly made me fall into the aisle of the 
theater!), cats, a goldfish, a modest orangutan, and the familiar chorus 
of mice.  Congratulations to director George Miller, as well as to the 
many animal trainers, handlers and animatronics engineers.  They assist 
the animals in telling large sections of the narrative; perhaps the 
animals are more important than even the humans.
Mickey Rooney has a cameo as the hotel owner's uncle, a strange little 
man named Fugly Flooms.  He's a clown who entertains hospitalized 
children, and when he conscripts Babe to help in the magic act, very 
funny chaos follows.  In a small reprise of his role as Farmer Hoggett, 
James Cromwell shows his experience; he's tolerant and venerable, and 
after watching the first movie, you just know the words with which 
Hoggett will end this one.
It's refreshing to see such a promising lineup of family entertainment 
in theaters for the holidays.  My ten year-old oftens scans ratings and 
discovers no G- or PG-rated films playing anywhere.  For the next 
several weeks we will be able to take her to several.  Babe:  A Pig in 
the City holds its own with all audiences, as suggested by several 
senior citizens sitting around us, also laughing with abandon.  It may 
even garner for the franchise a second Academy Award nomination for Best 
Picture.


Title
Review for Space Cowboys (2000)
Some movies you go to see for the special effects or plot. SPACE COWBOYS you 
go to see for the actors.
The old factotum Clint Eastwood produced and directed this one.  He also 
stars as Frank Corvin, a man who has been frustrated since 1958 when the Air 
Force turned American space missions over to the newly-formed NASA, and 
Frank and his three pilot cronies were replaced by a chimp, the first warm 
body to reach space for this country.
So here's the deal:  Corvin was not only a brilliant flyer but also a 
brilliant engineer.  He happened to design a guidance system that somehow 
made its way into a Soviet satellite.  When the satellite's orbit begins to 
degenerate, officials at NASA ask Corvin to train young astronauts so that 
they might capture the satellite with a space shuttle's arm, repair the 
satellite and set it back in orbit.  Why not let the satellite burn up upon 
reentry, or land in the sea?  This is a mystery until late in the story.
Complicating matters, NASA project manager Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) was 
the nasty boss who fired the crew forty years ago, and he is still around to 
aggravate Frank today.  When Frank demands that the original foursome be 
allowed to complete the mission themselves, Gerson agrees;  his agenda of 
course is to have his men trained, and then to dump Frank and his fellow 
oldsters.
The storyline immediately brings the plot of ARMAGEDDON to mind.  Instead of 
a crew of young and wild oil drillers, we have these vintage flyboys, but 
the premise follows them through similar episodes:  Frank goes to the 
various residences of Tank Sullivan (James Garner), Jerry O'Nell (Donald 
Sutherland) and Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), and he does not have much 
trouble in persuading them to want to blast off.  Then we follow the guys 
through training and testing, the hype around the mission growing and making 
it virtually impossible to throw the old men out on their wrinkled duffs.
The movie has its share of bad science, though it does not match the 
absurdity of ARMAGEDDON.  In fact, the premise of an unlikely crew making it 
into space is as far as the similarities reach.  SPACE COWBOYS is missing 
the frenetic music-video pace of director Michael Bay.  Here Eastwood 
ignores briskness in favor of character development, and because he has 
gathered actors of such maturity, he succeeds in crafting some very engaging 
relationships.  This over-the-hill gang is simply the best thing about the 
movie, and the main reason for viewing it.
Eastwood is big enough as an actor to fool around with self-parody, 
squinting his eyes and never backing down from a fight.  He also refrains 
from taking too much screen time for himself.  His Frank is bent on reaching 
his dream of outer space, but ultimately not at the expense of his friends.
Hawk serves as the focal point of the four.  He's the only one who seems 
reluctant to mount the mission, though he quickly shows up to drink with his 
old buddies and confirm he'll indeed go.  Tommy Lee Jones is the only actor 
here who is too young (53) to have piloted experimental planes in the late 
1950's, but he still does a convincing job.  His wife has died of cancer, 
and Hawk slowly grows involved with Sarah (Marcia Gay Harden), another NASA 
official.  The romantic interest of the film, this relationship never fully 
develops, though touches us with moments conveyed by solid acting.
Tank Sullivan has been a Baptist minister; we see him in his pulpit 
delivering an Old Testament lineage, when suddenly he spots Frank in the 
congregation, and embarks upon a story that apparently was the highest point 
his life will ever attain  about young men coursing through the blue 
yonder.  Except when he intones the first words of a Catholic prayer, Garner 
is very good in the role of Tank, though it is the smallest supporting role.
Donald Sutherland's character Jerry is supposed to be the ladies' man of the 
bunch, though we see him only once with a younger woman, hanging around the 
roller coaster he has designed for a large amusement park.  Like Eastwood, 
Sutherland is strong at not upstaging those he shares the screen with.
The senior ensemble can go only so far in affecting the film's quality.  
Though most of Eastwood's pictures are known for their clipped and clever 
dialogue, this one becomes hokey near the end, especially when Frank orders 
his mates to bail out of a damaged shuttle, and Tank replies with `We're 
staying.'  Oh, and the climax is not as weak as that of ARMAGEDDON or the 
more recent MISSION TO MARS, but it's close.
The final word about SPACE COWBOYS is that it's light but fun summer 
entertainment.  It won't be taking home loads of awards, but it's a good 
showcase for some leading men turned character actors, and come to think of 
it, the special effects are not bad either.

Review for Air Bud: Golden Receiver (1998)
This summer has not offered the goods to kids under 13 or parents who 
enforce the ratings system.  For example, I couldn't take my 10 year-old 
daughter to DOCTOR DOLITTLE because of its PG-13 status.
But we went today to AIR BUD:  GOLDEN RECEIVER, a rather unwieldy title 
but a decent film for kids.  And only the second theatrical release this 
summer, I believe, rated G.  (MULAN is the other.)
The sequel to last year's AIR BUD, this film expands upon the premise of 
a dog's prowess at basketball.  With a quick opening that does its job - 
moving fast and reinforcing Bud's craftiness and basketball expertise --  
the story unfolds easily and reintroduces us to Josh Framm (Kevin 
Zegers), now an eighth grader, and his mother Jackie (Cynthia 
Stevenson).  After a series of events that complicate the plot, we 
discover the family dog's amazing skill at catching a football.
The football motif is corny and fun;  it makes the viewer remember the 
type of film she is watching.  This is a kids' movie, and it's all right 
that a dog catches passes and eludes tacklers.  It's even all right that 
there is no objection whatever that Bud dresses in a cute quasi-uniform 
and scores touchdowns against other eighth-grades football teams.
The complications are what doesn't work so well.  
First, Gregory Harrison plays Patrick Sullivan, a handsome veterinarian 
who cares for Bud.  It's refreshing, by the way, that Bud likes him back 
- a turnaround from many family pets' uncanny instincts and hatred of a 
human character.  It's Josh who feels threatened when Patrick begins to 
date his mother.  Even though Josh is himself a personable adolescent 
and not an obnoxious stereotype of a teenager, he shows a sulking 
attitude when Patrick and Jackie grow close.  Why would a smart and 
supportive father figure turn off a boy like Josh?  Are a couple of 
shots of  Josh's deceased test-pilot father enough to make us believe 
Josh's motivation to act like he does?
Another subplot involves a sinister but comic Russian duo, played by 
Nora Dunn and Perry Anzilotti.  Their motive is greed when they set out 
to complete their circus of stolen animals with unique talents.  Dunn 
and Anzilotti prove solid caricature actors as they pursue Bud.  Their 
schemes and fates provide quite a few chuckles when the subplot surfaces 
now and again.  What is missing is the connective tissue.  In the first 
BUD, Josh came in contact with the baddie, who was the dog's original 
owner.  Here, however, the Framm family never even sees the Boris and 
Natasha clones.  Yes, the slapstick adds another funny dimension to the 
story, but by the end we feel as if an alarm were set but failed to go 
off.  Too many details, including a threat to fire the lovable football 
coach, come to naught.
Cynthia Stevenson turns in a credible performance as Jackie.  She brings 
a mousy, compassionate quality to Josh's mother.  The film, with its 
general audience rating, does not show much intimacy between Jackie and 
Patrick, but the actors convince us that a happy ending is possible.  As 
I stated before, it's the relationship between Josh and Patrick that is 
oddly bloodless.
The animal training deserves some mention.  Four big, feathery dogs were 
used to portray Bud, and the editing is slick and watchable.  Somehow 
this dog manages to catch everything thrown his way.  Even though we can 
tell the pigskin is half-inflated, the effect is cute.  And the pooch's 
uniform is precious:  white-painted, ancient leather helmet, smallish 
shoulder pads that make him look half bulldog, and blue jersey featuring 
"K 9."
The film gave me a few belly laughs, which is a sort of litmus test I 
apply to comedies.  Even though AIR BUD:  GOLDEN RECEIVER is a B-film, 
it appeals to a G audience.  That and the laughter it provides are 
enough to earn our money at the box office.


Title
Review for Armageddon (1998)
Thanks for the message about my X Files review.  Enclosed is one
for ARMAGEDDON.
When ARMAGEDDON opened on July 1, my son and I visited the only cinema 
in our small city.  We entered the largest auditorium, which was the 
original theater, circa 1930's.  (Three much smaller screens were added 
recently to please the college crowd.)
For close to two hours we viewed the film, watching as NASA discovered 
they had 18 days to figure a way to save the planet from an asteroid the 
size of Texas;  we followed the escapades of the world's best 
oil-drilling crew, led by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), as they 
hurriedly trained to drill 800 feet into the asteroid and plant a 
warhead.  We arrived almost at the climax, both space shuttle crews 
coping with crises in outer space.  Then the projector quit!  Rather, 
the sound quit first, and we were treated to the amplified banter of the 
teenage staff until they realized the problem and killed the projector.
We were glad finally when the harried manager refunded our money;  they 
had monkeyed around so much, restarting the film and failing for over 
half an hour, that the narrative had lost all continuity for us.
So when we tried again today in a multiplex in the county seat, we knew 
most of what we would see.  And hear.  First of all, ARMAGEDDON is very 
loud, especially on state-of-the-art sound systems.  Starting with the 
title sequence, the fiery pieces of "ARMAGEDDON" break up and rush 
toward the viewer with menacing racket.  The explosions are deafening as 
well:  but they occur in context, and count as a convincing part of very 
slick special effects.  What I noticed during both viewing attempts was 
the bad science that happened each time large objects rushed through the 
vacuum of space.  They groaned and galumphed past each other like mad 
Jabberwocks, the space rock past the moon, the shuttles past the 
camera's eye -- whooshes engineered to inspire awe. 
Then there is the trite characterization.  Having already met most of 
the deep-sea drillers when Harry chases A. J. Frost (Ben Affleck) around 
after finding him with daughter Grace (Liv Tyler), we are subjected to 
countless scenes in which each crew member's eccentricities are further 
highlighted.  Moreover, we must sit through almost remedial explanations 
of space protocol, including Dan Truman's (Billy Bob Thornton) spelling 
out of the exact mission.  Apparently director Michael Bay and the 
multiple writers forgot that APOLLO 13 educated movie-goers about 
sling-shotting around the moon, as well as about the particulars of 
gravity.
The acting does not draw as many complaints.  Bruce Willis plays a very 
likable drilling expert, a leader well-liked by his crew.  His timing 
seems especially good during the action sequences.  Only toward the end, 
when Stamper has no less than two tear-jerking scenes that rival the 
sentimental schlock of Forrest Gump's talking to Jenny's gravestone, is 
the acting over the top.  And that is the script's fault.  Rock-faced 
Billy Bob Thornton smiles only a few times, but manages a solid and 
sympathetic performance.  Liv Tyler, the only female aside from a token, 
beautiful astronaut, acts well off Harry and off her love interest, A. 
J., her wide lips alternately pouting and puckering.  William Fichtner 
plays Colonel Willie Sharp, the shuttle pilot charged with ensuring the 
success of the mission, with expert coldness;  he's the closest to a 
human villain, though he reminded me of the psychotic SEAL in THE ABYSS.
Other strong points are editing and cinematography.  From sweeps around 
the NASA conference room to quick close-ups, from split-second 
backgrounds (that was Michael Bay in one, no?) to the simulated, 
striking aerial view of the double launch, the camera work tells the 
story with stylistic, often frenetic motion.  Once again, though, the 
script intrudes:  the result, well-shot but terribly clichéd montages, 
many showing Bay's vision of a type of classic America, people listening 
to news of the catastrophe, gathered in a Mayberry-like barber shop or 
sitting in vintage pickups, near American flags and farmhouses.  In one 
shot a group of boys even runs past a clapboard store sporting a faded 
campaign mural of JFK!  I got the notion I was back in the first days of 
the old theater, and could walk out into the slightly fuzzy, pure 
American air, the dust motes of nostalgia floating around me.
I enjoyed the ending more than I thought I would, after seeing the 
beginning and middle twice.  ARMAGEDDON is just above average as summer 
entertainment, but I would advise finding a theatre that is neither too 
cold nor too loud, and that owns a projector with a fully functioning 
platter system.


Title
Review for Mickey Blue Eyes (1999)
It seems the mafia movie has become a genre unto itself, whether it's a 
heavy crime drama or a spoof.  Certainly, politically incorrect jokes are 
not dead at the turn of the century, as we see in Kelly Makin's "Mickey Blue 
Eyes."
Indeed, the funniest parts of the film come when cultures clash.  Michael 
Felgate (Hugh Grant), an Englishman running an art auction house in New York 
City, collides with Italian-American toughs with results that keep the 
chuckles coming.  Michael's future father-in-law is Frank Vitale (James 
Caan), and the scenes in which Frank tries to impose phrases like 
"Fuggedaboudit" and "Get oudda hee" atop Michael's dignified accent are 
hilarious.  (They would have been even better had I not seen them six or 
eight times in trailers!) Of course Michael finds the entire mob culture 
repulsive, but even though he has promised his fiance Gina Vitale (Jeanne 
Tripplehorn) he would shun this culture at all costs, he finds himself 
assumed into it.
Family boss Vito "The Butcher" Graziosi (Burt Young) has arranged for 
Michael's delivery trucks to arrive on time, you see.  Michael is so naďve 
he does not realize the reason for the rare promptness and contrite demeanor 
of the truck drivers.  We can predict that Michael will be called upon 
sometime, someday, to return Uncle Vito's favor.  It comes in the form of a 
request to auction the horrifically violent, religious-themed canvases of 
Vito's son Johnny, who paints as part of his therapy.  The schtick 
surrounding Johnny is humorous because of his personality: the man embodies 
the pathology of jealousy, confronting every man who glances in the 
direction of his girlfriend.  Unfortunately, Michael actually takes 
commission from the sale of Johnny's first painting - which draws him 
inexorably deeper into the mire of crime, especially as the Graziosi family 
is laundering money through these sales.
Will Michael marry Gina?  After all, she has apparently avoided immersion in 
criminal activities all these years, while caring for her father and brother 
after her mother's death.  And Michael can't seem to avoid being sucked into 
the lies and dark activities moments after introducing himself to the 
family.  Anyhow, the tension builds at the same time more laughs are 
delivered, and the ending is happy if somewhat predictable.
Hugh Grant is not as debonair as Cary Grant, but he has similar innocent 
charm.  Michael seems so likable because he is genuine, and we feel involved 
in his touchy dilemmas.  He is an especially naďve Everyman, receiving 
punches in the stomach from the over-friendly doorman of Gina's building, 
playing along with elaborate lies and morbid schemes, many the machinations 
of Frank Vitale.
Jeanne Tripplehorn plays her part superbly.  She shows just the right 
amounts of sweetness and doubt, joy and anger.  We feel for her strongly 
when she is inadvertently involved in a dark twist of family fate - although 
her noble boyfriend is willing to take the fall for her.
As Frank Vitale, James Caan is believable but a bit disappointing.  I've 
seen this veteran actor on talk shows, and in real life he seems more 
capable of the arch exaggeration of behaviors that would have put Frank 
deliciously over the top.  Frank is a loving father and family lieutenant 
with years of experience, but a touch more goofiness would have fashioned a 
funnier tone in many scenes.  Here director Kelly Makin shouldn't have been 
afraid to let Caan improvise a little!
The soundtrack of the film is highlighted by Italian-oriented novelty songs. 
  We hear "Mambo Italiano," Dean Martin's suave crooning, and many others - 
all pieces that add to the fun.
The film is rated PG-13 for mild language, and mostly for crime-related 
material, such as bodies being carried in trash bags and buried near the 
river.  There is also a brief scene full of innuendo, poking fun of British 
habits in lavatory stalls.  Good for kids 12 and over.


Title
Review for Simpatico (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Mathew Warchus's Simpatico is a realistic story of long-term guilt, 
deflected love, and puzzling role-reversal.  Unfortunately, it's also an 
exercise in ennui for the viewer.
Based on the play by Sam Shepard,  Simpatico starts by showing us the 
remains of the old friendship between Lyle Carter (Jeff Bridges) and Vinnie 
(Nick Nolte).  Vinnie calls Carter from a pay phone outside a Payless 
grocery store in California.  Carter, a millionaire horse breeder in 
Kentucky, drops his business and tells one of his secretaries to inform his 
wife he's leaving on important business.  While this plot is unfolding we 
view shots from twenty-odd years ago, of a young Vinnie and Carter 
celebrating a winner at the track.  We come to understand that it was this 
time of youth that generated the mistake the men are still regretting.  What 
we do know is that it involves photographs and their negatives, and that 
Vinnie offers to give them to Carter if Carter agrees to talk with Vinnie's 
girlfriend.
According to Vinnie, this woman (Cecilia, played by Catherine Keener) has 
filed harassment charges against him, and Carter's chore is to reason with 
her in an attempt to get the charges dropped.  This story is one of many 
lies, though, and while Carter is inside Cecilia'a apartment, Vinnie steals 
Carter's car and all of his things.  For some reason Carter has left his 
wallet in his car, but he does have his cell phone.
What follows is a story replete with the ramifications and wrong turns 
caused by youthful stupidity and middle-aged guilt.  In Kentucky, Vinnie 
visits the victim of the youthful scam, one Mr. Simms, whose name is now 
Ames (Albert Finney).  Meanwhile, Carter stays in Vinnie's hovel;  the best 
explanation we have that Carter doesn't fly back to his wife and mansion and 
soon-to-be-sold Triple Crown winner is that he likes the smell of alfalfa.  
He grew up in this area of California, and apparently decides to forsake the 
life of lies he has led.  Carter even dresses in Vinnie's clothes and visits 
the seedy bar Vinnie frequents.  It is an interesting switching of lives, 
though not quite plausible.
What happens with Cecilia?  It seems her relationship with Vinnie was only 
platonic anyway, but she ends up as Carter's agent, taking a lot of money to 
Simms/Ames in return for the negatives.  Later we meet Rosie (Sharon Stone), 
Carter's wife, who wonders why her husband isn't back home to celebrate the 
$30 million sale of Simpatico.  The staff of Carter's horse farm goes along 
with Carter's whim, covering for him, but what's a little shaky is that 
Carter seems serious in not returning to Kentucky.  There's an interesting 
scene between Vinnie and Rosie before Vinnie returns to California to find 
Carter, his doppelganger, crashed on the couch in a drunken heap.
What's very weird is that there is no actual scene between Carter and Rosie; 
  we see them talking on the phone and we see them as youths in the 
flashbacks.  Further, Vinnie and Cecilia never share a frame.  It is 
interesting, though, how we learn about them through their talk with others; 
but it is not very helpful in coaxing the viewers' sympathy.
The excellent cast all do a fine job.  Nolte has played this type of 
freeloader once too frequently, perhaps, but he is quite proficient.  It's 
fascinating trying to figure out his motivations.  Bridges also acts 
smoothly, though we are still not given adequate reason to believe he would 
forfeit his lifestyle so completely.  The surprise find here is Catherine 
Keener as the somewhat reserved Cecilia.  She acts off Bridges particularly 
well, stopping short of alarm at his odd antics.  Albert Finney is the only 
character to play himself in the flashbacks (the young Vinnie is Shawn 
Hatosy, the young Carter Liam Waite, the young Rosie Kimberly Williams).  As 
such, Finney does not visually convince us; and although he is among the 
very finest living actors, Finney's style is too inflated for the seedy 
tracer of equine bloodlines.  His Simms/Ames is lustful yet not quite 
despicable.
Mathew Warchus also penned the screenplay, and it seems at times that 
Shepard's lines still belong on the stage.  Some of the delivery is too 
portentous for the movies;  it's as if we need the in-person medium of live 
drama for the material to resonate properly.  The editing moves quickly 
enough through most of the narrative, and the flashbacks are nicely 
introduced - at times the older characters melt into their younger selves 
and we realize without obtrusive devices where we are.  But the flatness 
near the end results in a lack of satisfaction.
Simpatico is not a major work in the canon of modern film, but it is a 
strong study of the damage wrought by hidden secrets --  a theme not 
uncommon in the work of the actor/playwright Sam Shepard.  The film is rated 
R for language and glimpses of sordid sexuality.


Title
Review for Simon Birch (1998)
I've yet to decide if a movie is good if it makes you cry.  SIMON BIRCH 
gave me at least one all-out belly laugh, during the Christmas pageant, 
and I've thought for some time that a movie is decent if it makes you 
shout in laughter.  But crying?
I did not cry during Forrest Gump's monologue directed at Jenny's grave.  
It was as though the director were lighting up a CRY NOW sign, in the 
same way that television studios light APPLAUSE signs.  The movie did 
not earn our tears, at least in this scene.
SIMON BIRCH made my lip quiver, and I know my daughter was squeezing my 
wife's arm during the scenes that were designed to be gut-wrenching.  
Maybe the answer is here, that if a sequence is "designed" or 
"engineered" to move us, it does not ring true, and therefore does not 
come by our tears honestly.  The taint of artifice.
What's likable about SIMON BIRCH?  It's a buddy movie, two boys who are 
best friends, and it's set in the early 1960s.  So there's an aura of 
nostalgia, a feeling that the action is ensconced in the lost and better 
past.  The main plot hovers about the life of Joe Wentworth (Joseph 
Mazzello), a 12 year-old who does not know who his father is.  For some 
time he has been the butt of jokes and scorn, but his mother has not 
revealed her lover met years ago on the train.  Life-long pal Simon 
Birch (Ian Michael Smith), also 12 but with the eccentricities of 
someone much older, decides he will help Joe find his father.  We are 
also informed of Simon's deep-seated belief that God put him here for a 
purpose, that because of his faith, Simon would cope with his dwarfism 
and overcome people's blindness.  Simon would become a hero.
These two early adolescents quickly endear themselves to the viewer.  
Although their routine is typical - playing baseball, racing to the 
creek for a swim, discussing girls - the script (by Mark Steven Johnson) 
has them perform these growing up tasks with quirky originality.  
Simon's self-deprecating humor is especially charming.  He one-ups Joe 
in physical comparisons, though he goes for the smaller instead of the 
superior.  He accepts playing the Baby Jesus because he is the only 
student who will fit in the crib.  And he rides, perhaps too cutely, in 
a wooden Coca-Cola crate rigged up as a sidecar to Joe's bike.  Though 
their actions and ideas are occasionally unexplainable, both boys craft 
fine performances, causing the audience to feel a range of emotions.
Ashley Judd distinguishes herself as Rebecca Wentworth, Joe's mother.  
Although cast as an ideal - the pretty and caring mom - Judd steps 
around firmly in the role, making it believable.  Part of her importance 
is serving as Simon's surrogate mom, one who cares about the boy - 
unlike his real parents, who permit Simon to live with them but are 
otherwise uninvolved.   Judd's acting might be compared to the product 
of a writer who works hard for transparent prose, or of a dancer who 
works tirelessly for effortless leaps.  It's unfortunate that the story 
calls for Rebecca to appear only in the first half of the film.  
Oliver Platt's role, Ben Goodrich the drama teacher who begins to date 
Rebecca, suffers from acute stereotype.  But Platt manages to make the 
character engaging.  Yes, Joe initially resents him, and Ben tries to 
win the boy over with goofy gifts and behaviors.  But there's a depth 
that Ben's character achieves, especially after Rebecca's character 
departs from the story.  Platt's flat face and nonchalance connects him 
with both Joe and Simon, another surrogate, but the audience is also in 
on the connection.
Like Platt, David Strathairn is a reliable character actor, but the 
script does not fully develop his Reverend Russell.  What we get is a 
lightweight Dimmesdale from The Scarlet Letter, a stiff and rather 
cowardly man whose presence is overshadowed by any character appearing 
with him.  Other supporting roles are well-cast, including Jan Hooks, 
almost unrecognizable, as Miss Leavy, a nasty Sunday school teacher, and 
Jim Carrey as the adult Joe Wentworth, whom we see in the framing tale 
at start and end.
Director Mark Steven Johnson's main accomplishment is the friendship 
among the main characters;  these relationships make us care about them.  
A secondary success is the comfortable mood set up by the beautiful 
camera work, especially in scenes that perfectly evoke fall and winter.  
September was a great month in which to release this film:  the leaves 
and fast-running water throughout the story both add to the imagery and 
cause the climax to reverberate all the more.
If I were to rank SIMON BIRCH by percentile, it would place in the 80's 
- perhaps a "B" picture, but one that is considerably more than half 
successful.  As far as causing tears, I mostly agree with a writing 
teacher who said a good story is one that makes you laugh or cry.  SIMON 
BIRCH affected my family and me, and I'll carry some of its images in my 
mental storehouse of favorites.  Because it meets these criteria, and 
because I cared about its characters, SIMON BIRCH is a good film to me.


Title
Review for One True Thing (1998)
There is enough dysfunction among the Gulden family members to fill the 
plotlines of two or three television dramas for an entire season.  What 
makes the film refreshing and watchable is that the director does not 
over-reach in portraying emotional moments.  Never does the film fall 
into unforgivable sentimentality;  never does it sketch a character in 
purely black or white.
Director Carl Franklin's toughest task must have been getting right the 
terrible and delicate shadowing in the backgrounds of the characters' 
lives.  The Gulden family has so much going for it - a Victorian mansion 
an hour or so outside of  New York City, a house made perfect and 
picturesque by Kate (Meryl Streep).  There is Kate's husband George 
(William Hurt), owner of a National Book Award, respected essayist and 
chair of the English Department at Langhorne College, no Harvard but a 
respectable small pond.  The Guldens' two children are Brian (Tom 
Everett Scott), a college student, and Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a 
Harvard grad and rising writer at a New York magazine.  When Ellen's 
cancer intrudes suddenly on their lives, and George asks Ellen to resign 
her responsibilities in the City and care for her mother, the story 
unfolds and the emotions unload.
It's a safe guess that Meryl Streep did not require much coaching.  She 
is brilliant, her angular features shining in her Dorothy costume (she 
even clicks her ruby-slippered heels!) that she sports for her husband's 
birthday party.  So much of Streep's acting is subtle, telegraphing her 
character's thoughts and making so many words unnecessary.  Streep 
should be a shoo-in for another Oscar nomination.  Although Ellen seems 
very put off by her mother's domestic prowess, she is forced by 
necessity to assume her mother's household duties.  This mother-daughter 
relationship is the key one in the story.  Two of the film's most 
wrenching scenes feature these women:  one at a  town gathering - 
perfectly accented by a lingering camera shot;  the other in Kate's 
bedroom, a cathartic scene that is at once a confession and an 
absolution.  Here Carl Franklin demonstrates his timing, intuition and 
experience.
In the novel on which the film is based, Anna Quindlen crafts Ellen as a 
remote intellectual, looking down her nose at her housebroken mother, 
while looking up at her writer-god father.  Zellweger fills in this role 
well.  She is wonderful in scenes involving a disastrous meal;  
notwithstanding, Ellen is inducted into her mother's women's group, the 
"Minnies."  Ellen's reluctance slowly gives way not only to an 
acceptance of the hard housework, but to an appreciation of Kate's 
diligence in keeping the Gulden family running so smoothly.  For much of 
the film Zellweger, stone-faced, watches her parents' lives altered for 
good.  When it counts, though, she delivers "the right thing to do."
The screenplay, by Karen Croner, preserves much of Quindlen's clever 
dialogue.  It also adds new pieces that portray the characters in bleak 
lighting.  For instance, Professor George Gulden comes off as pompous, a 
phony who relies on a couple of quotes, one stolen, to impress his 
listeners.  Also added are memory strobes in which Ellen remembers her 
younger father, full-bearded, buying her ice cream and carrying her atop 
his shoulders.  It's not difficult to admire a film that takes even 
minor risks, like these flashbacks.  William Hurt's George is just as 
complex as Ellen.  His actions are often detestable, unthinkable for a 
man whose wife is terminally ill.  But we also see qualities that go a 
long way toward redeeming him, and in the end we witness George and 
Ellen sharing a remarkable epiphany.
Symbolism in the picture is noticeable but not heavy-handed.  We follow 
the seasons from fall through a dreary winter.  In an uncharacteristic, 
medication-induced rage, Kate shatters plates whose pieces Ellen later 
uses in a mosaic project started by her mother.  Finally, mother and 
daughter switch roles.  Together with other moving scenes, the product 
is a fine adaptation of Quindlen's compassionate work.
If not for the uttering of a forbidden word three times, this R-rated 
film may have been a more accessible PG.  (Even if the word were 
included one time, wouldn't there be a PG-13 rating?)  There is no 
nudity, only brief references to sex, certainly no violence.  Many 
children will miss a well-drawn drama about a family, because someone 
decided not to sacrifice verbal realism.  Oh, well.


Title
Review for Wonder Boys (2000)
Talk about a Sophomore Slump - it's taken Grady Tripp seven years and over 
2600 single-spaced pages, and he still doesn't have a second novel.
The first novel by Tripp (Michael Douglas) was "Arsonist's Daughter," 
supposedly the winner of the PEN Award.  So the literary community eagerly 
awaits a new effort.  Of course Grady's life as a writer in contemporary 
America almost demands that he be a college professor.  Hence the setting in 
a fictional Pittsburgh university.  Unfortunately, the film gets many 
aspects of college life wrong.  I can understand novelist Michael Chabon and 
screenwriter Steven Kloves sketching a fiction writing workshop in which the 
students are petty and personal.  But the ones I've been through have always 
had a camaraderie and atmosphere of willingness to help:  yes, there's a 
certain amount of ignorance of purpose, but never the pure vitriol heaped 
upon the person and talent of James Leer, played by Tobey Maguire.  And in a 
forum of open critiquing of stories, the professor doesn't have to call on 
students who raise their hands.
Still the world of writing commands our attention well.  The inbred politics 
is also captured believably.  It seems Grady's young wife has just this 
morning left him; not that it matters much, as the marriage has been tainted 
by Grady's affair with the Chancellor of the college where he teaches.  Dr. 
Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand) is pregnant, and it's not with the child of 
her husband Walter (Richard Thomas), who is also the chair of the English 
department and Grady's boss.  To add to the complications of academia, we 
see a gathering of writers and various hangers-on at the Gaskell household.  
There we also watch the development of more characters, among them Terry 
Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), Grady's agent from New York, and Crabtree's 
transvestite pick-up Antonia/Tony.  Add to this the fact that Walter 
Gaskell's blind mastiff hates Grady, growling and ultimately chomping on the 
hero's calf.
Director Curtis Hanson handles characterization swiftly with his solid cast. 
  The film's opening and middle are stronger than its closing, due mainly to 
the situations - wacky and moving - into which the characters get 
themselves.  We hear a good deal of one-liners that are so crazy they smack 
of reality. And we get a top-notch performance from Michael Douglas in the 
lead role.
Douglas has superior timing and a natural ease on the screen.  His character 
operates, however, under the burden of stereotype:  he's rumpled and 60-ish, 
and even though he's been living in his body and his life for a long time, 
he's yet to get it right.  (Doesn't this sound like Donald Sullivan, Paul 
Newman's character in "Nobody's Fool"?)  Still Douglas does a remarkable job 
in causing his character to be sympathetic, especially considering his 
character is not a very good role model for students: he drinks, smokes 
expensive marijuana, and often loses his tact in personal conversations.  He 
also looks on as a student of his backslides into immorality and crime.  
Finally, he is beset by fainting spells that hit him at random times, making 
worse his status as a wounded man.  Still, we like the guy, especially as he 
careens comically out of the safe orbit of the tenure-track.
Tobey Maguire is at his most inscrutable in "Wonder Boys."  I've not seen 
him particularly excitable in a performance, but here he is low-key almost 
to a fault, his character a good writer but otherwise a morally reckless 
liar.  Let's hope many more solid scripts come Maguire's way; apparently he 
is taking a hiatus currently, in a patient quest for quality.
Frances McDormand is good in everything she does.  Here she is 
underutilized, though, as the chief executive of the college, and we do not 
get more than a glance of the husband whom she is betraying; we are 
supposed, I guess, to dislike Richard Thomas' character simply because he 
doesn't care for Grady.
The other female role is played by Katie Holmes.  Her Hannah Green is also a 
star student of Grady's; we hear Grady tell another novelist, "Q" (Rip Torn) 
that Hannah has already published two stories in the "Paris Review."  
Enamored of Grady, she rents a room in his house and ends up giving him some 
metaphorically significant advice.
"Wonder Boys" has many faults - the random-feeling ending, the lack of 
consequences for reprehensible behaviors - that make it fall short of 
greatness.  But it is definitely a good film.  With a momentum built through 
Grady's inability to make decisions and through a few wacky twists of plot, 
the story finally shows that serious losses are sometimes necessary to keep 
one from taking life too seriously.


Title
Review for Inspector Gadget (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
"Inspector Gadget," directed by David Kellogg, is another live-action 
version of a Saturday morning cartoon, and indeed the places in which it is 
most successful are those that show cartoonish silliness.
Matthew Broderick plays the rather dull-witted police inspector dedicated to 
justice. His character, John Brown, is at first an ambitious security guard 
at a medical clinic. The clinic is run by Dr. Brenda Bradford (Joely 
Fisher), who has just about perfected a high-tech program in robotics. When 
an arch-criminal - Sanford Scolex, played by Rupert Everett -- kills 
Bradford's father and makes off with essential components of the "Gadget" 
program, the main plot devices are set in motion. Scolex lobs a dynamite 
cigar and blows Brown up, and himself loses a hand. Hence the nickname 
"Claw."
In an oblique nod to "Robocop," the damaged semi-officer is robotized, his 
head his only human part. Meanwhile, the slimy Claw has recruited Dr. 
Brenda Bradford, offering her unlimited funding and control. His plans are 
sinister, of course: he wishes to build robotic warriors to create 
invincible armies for the highest bidders. The rest of the story follows 
Claw's evil wanderings, including his manufacturing an evil twin for 
Inspector Gadget.
This double is the highlight of Broderick's performance. Rather ordinary in 
his title role, Broderick sets off the twin with a wise-cracking, 
teeth-clicking twist of attitude. It's unclear exactly why Claw has made 
the twin, except to clone the convention of smearing the good guy. Further, 
not enough is made of the wondrous Gadget, so his character seems 
underdeveloped in the public's eye; the real Gadget does not seem to suffer 
from the public's scorn. Clearly, the writers didn't think of everything.
On the other hand, Rupert Everett saves his character with exaggeration - 
laughs and scowls reminiscent of the best mad scientists. In this 
telescoped plot - the whole film under 80 minutes! - Claw's motivations are 
muddy, his background almost completely absent. But Everett makes his bad 
guy actually likable, a feat only good cartoons accomplish.
Joely Fisher as Brenda Bradford is passable. Too much emphasis is placed on 
her beauty, not enough on her intelligence. And I got the feeling that she 
found it difficult to make us believe a human could fall in love with her 
Frankenstein, although it is a fascinating possibility.
The self-relexive humor goes a long way toward making "Inspector Gadget" 
watchable. When the Gadgetmobile (a souped-up white Lincoln convertible 
voiced by D.L. Hughley) quips that this is "a Disney movie," we get a taste 
of wit that appears too sparsely in so many other parts. Mini-parodies of 
movies like last summer's flop "Godzilla" also kick the quality up to 
average.
What pulls it so far down, though? For one, editing done in a chop-shop. 
Many moments that we have seen in trailers for months either do not appear 
at all in the film, or surface at points that are at times awkward or even 
incoherent. I should add that a couple of thought-balloon sequences do 
succeed in offering tiny, cartoon-y flashbacks. But much of the exposition 
we need to comprehend the storyline is lost to the editor's hatchet. 
Another aspect that falls flat is the role of Gadget's niece Penny (Michelle 
Trachtenberg). The actress does a fine job; it's just that she is used for 
ridiculous purposes. Her pooch, the beagle Brain, has simply too little 
screen time to matter much.
Visual effects do a nice job in emulating the outrageous gadgets that spring 
out of the inspector's body. His arms and legs extend for yards, weapons 
shooting out of every portal, even his hat. There's a particularly neat 
scene in which a boy on the street asks for an autograph from the evil 
Gadget, and all kinds of evil-looking weapons pop out of the copy's arms, 
scaring the boy. Unfortunately, we were overexposed to this scene in the 
trailers.
To get a little more of your money's worth if you see this film in a 
theater, stay for the closing credits. Some of the best segments of your 
viewing will include Brain talking in the sharp voice of Don Adams (Gadget's 
voice in the creative cartoon), as well as one of Claw's henchmen in a 
Minion Support Group, characters like Richard Kiel's "Jaws" and an Odd-Job 
impersonator sitting among the listeners.
But I'd advise to skip paying today's big bucks for first-run admission in 
favor of second-run or video rental. That way there's no chance for the 
regret I experienced in paying for a movie I had heard was bad.


Title
Review for Shanghai Noon (2000)
Just in time for students out of school for the summer, Jackie Chan appears 
in another American movie.  The Hong Kong action master is developing a 
trademark: as he did in RUSH HOUR with Chris Tucker, Chan teams up in 
SHANGHAI NOON with comic talent Owen Wilson for a lot of laughs.  The two 
cover the gamut of humor, Chan with his over-the-top physicality, Wilson 
with his quirky, incongruous, New Age-y cowboy.  It's lots of fun.
Although the plot is a creaky mix of clichés, director Tom Dey paces the 
story well, most scenes leading into action sequences that would keep any 
viewer watching.  What Dey and Chan treat us to once again is a series of 
absurd situations, the heroes (Chan as Chon Wang  do you get the 
sound-alike? And Owen Wilson as Roy O'Bannon) slipping into all kinds or 
peril only to survive by their wits or, in O'Bannon's case, by stupid luck.
Starting out in the Forbidden City, the story introduces us to the Chinese 
princess Pei Pei, played by Lucy Lui.  Because she is unhappy in her 
homeland, she gives in easily to the plot proposed by her American tutor  
to leave the country for the States.  Naturally, this private teacher turns 
out to be just another smooth-talking bad guy, as it's a kidnapping plot 
disguised as a defection.  Once the princess is away, the emperor and his 
entourage  receive a ransom note, and proceed to dispatch three members of 
the Imperial guard,  three of the bravest men in the country.  Chon Wang 
tags along because of his fondness and loyalty to the princess, and he 
quickly finds trouble on the train on the dusty plains of the American West. 
  Though the two begin as antagonists, Chon and Roy fall together and even 
become friends.  Their goal is to rescue the beautiful Pei Pei and return 
her to China, and O'Bannon wouldn't mind if mines full of gold came his way 
in the process.  Another rub is that Pei Pei left her homeland under her own 
volition in the first place.
The main conflict that adds interest, beside the ongoing feud between Wang 
and O'Bannon, is the egregious kidnapper, Lo Fong, played by Roger Yuan.  
Head shaved, this young Asian actor easily plays a despicable master of 
martial arts and crime.  Among the adventures that entangle the heroes, a 
Native American woman (Brandon Merrill)  ostensibly Wang's wife  saves the 
day a few different times.  On the whole, not a very original premise, but a 
competent collection of fights and assorted witticisms.
Jackie Chan is unbeatable when it comes to mixing creativity and violence.  
If he were only around when Peter Sellers was fighting his manservant in the 
Pink Panther series!  Chan has been doing this business for so long that his 
effort here is seamless, the self-done stunts pieces of stunning 
choreography.  In one bar fight scene, Chon Wang grabs moose antlers off the 
wall, a perfect weapon with which to fend off a saloon full of belligerent 
cowpokes.  Jackie's English is improving, and he continues to display 
wonderful timing in virtually any scene he's in.
Wilson is the perfect choice for O'Bannon.  In some ways Wilson is a young 
Steve Martin, playing off incongruities with clever but subtle jokes.  His 
character is not quite the nebbish Woody Allen would make him, but there's 
this underlying, rather subtle hilarity that surrounds his performance.  
O'Bannon is good at heart, yes, but he can't avoid the temptation to pick up 
some money however he can.
Lucy Liu plays her part well enough, without having many lines.  The 
modernization of Eastern relationships is one of the more unbelievable 
facets bought to light by the narrative.  Chon Wang goes from obsequious 
bowing to familiar address at a rapid rate.
Working closely with Lo Fong, Marshal Van Cleef fills the role of another 
formidable baddie.  Xander Berkeley plays the role with a nice, sometimes 
almost cartoonish menace, keeping in tone with the exaggeration essential in 
a film of this genre.
The fight scenes in SHANGHAI NOON are very slick, humorous and engaging.  To 
fulfill his hallmark of brilliance within violence, Chan employs the 
antlers, a spinning sheriff's badge, even springy evergreens as weapons.  
His acrobatics are unmatched, his comic sense very natural.  He's certainly 
famous for doing his own stunt work, and the well-known out-takes running 
atop the closing credits make the watching of SHANGHAI NOON even more 
enjoyable.
Perhaps the film is not as fall-down funny as RUSH HOUR; some of the 
ridiculous business in that film cause belly laughs of the kind experienced 
on cool, fast amusement rides.  But neither is NOON as heavy in its 
subplots.  For fans of fights and buddy movies, this flick is a must-see.  
And for viewers unfamiliar with Jackie Chan, this piece would serve as a 
solid introduction.


Title
Review for Runaway Bride (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
A lot's been said about the chemistry between Julia Roberts and Richard 
Gere, the actors reunited a decade after their hit Pretty Woman.  Garry 
Marshall returns as their director in Runaway Bride, a story that entertains 
and charms but falls just this side of the status of major romantic comedy.
Yes, the chemistry's there, and Marshall seems to have romantic formulas 
down to a science.  From the credit-less opening to the set decoration, the 
film is slick and fairly fast-paced.  The piece is two hours long and it 
fills all of these minutes pleasantly enough.  I think what is missing, 
though, is enough character development, especially of Ike Graham, Gere's 
character;  we don't know him quite enough to care enough.
We know that Graham is an acerbic columnist for USA Today, based in 
Manhattan.  His specialty seems to be busting the chops of the opposite sex. 
  (A running gag involves Graham's being rapped by newspaper-swinging old 
women.)  When he fails to check the facts given him by one drunken source, 
Ike gets fired.  It's oddly convenient that his editor is his "ex," Ellie 
(Rita Wilson).  She's now married to one of Ike's best friends, Fisher 
(Hector Elizondo, a fixture in Marshall movies).  So the legendary Ike 
Graham is out of work, the paper printing a retraction that appears to 
please the victim of  Ike's column, one Maggie Carpenter (Roberts).
What's the conceit here?  It's the Runaway Bride angle, the fact that Maggie 
has strode down the aisle and then skedaddled three times, leaving three men 
witless and wife-less.  Because she's stuck it to him, Ike decides to shadow 
Maggie for another story, this time a piece for GQ, and he drives the 90 or 
so miles down the coast to Hale, Maryland, where Maggie runs the family 
hardware store.  Of course Ike's new take on the situation is that she will 
run again, and it just happens that Maggie is engaged to a fourth guy, an 
extremely decent mountain climber and high school football coach named Bob 
(Christopher Meloni).  Maggie is not pleased to see Ike's invasion of her 
domain, and she strikes first in a unique scene that shows us Ike with a 
multi-colored head.
What's funny here is how Ike insinuates himself into Maggie's life.  He 
seems to beat Maggie to every destination her life carries her:  when she 
arrives home, Ike is already there talking with her father and grandmother 
about her; when she drives to an ex-fiance's garage, Ike is sitting in an 
old Volkswagen 'Thing" atop the hydraulic lift, a picture of a topless 
Maggie in his hands.  When Maggie reverses the role and begins to appear 
inside Ike's quarters when he arrives home, the conflict and comedy 
increase.  The remainder of the plot follows Ike as he follows Maggie.  
After a time the two form a rather improbably friendship, Maggie offering to 
let Ike interview her for a rather large fee (which she plans to spend on an 
extravagant wedding dress).  All the time the chemistry between the two is 
reacting more intensely.  At a luau that friend Peggy Flemming (Joan Cusack) 
throws for Maggie, Ike even defends Maggie when her friends go too far with 
the runaway bride jokes.
The film does a nice job with all this rising action, Ike's hunt for clues 
with which to assassinate Maggie's character, and Maggie's counteractions, 
subtly assisted by her friends.  A bit of flatness hits once the climax is 
over, though; the predictable premise of all romantic comedies comes across 
as simply a way to end the film - although it never reaches a high level of 
satisfaction.
Maybe we need to know more about Ike Graham.  From the outset he has to 
wrestle with the stereotype of being a shallow misogynist, a man hated by 
half the human race.  We know he's divorced from Ellie the editor.  We 
discover he's an aspiring novelist, a vocation his mother wanted for him, 
and indeed this is made more plausible by the books on his shelf (including 
Melville), and the ones he reads as he and Maggie go through the mini-scenes 
that show they are falling in love (Yeats, Poe).  But we know very little 
else.  After he arrives in Hale Ike rarely even uses his mini-recorded, and 
we never see him actually scribbling or word-processing anything resembling 
a piece for GQ, a publication never mentioned after Fisher brings it up.  
This doesn't surprise, as other subplots are not completed either, including 
one in which Walter, Maggie's father (Paul Dooley), is an alcoholic whose 
behavior only Maggie rather mildly objects to.
More characterization would let us like Ike more, even though Richard Gere 
does nice work handling his character.  Most of the focus is placed on 
Maggie - if Henry James were a screenwriter in the late twentieth-century, 
he would occupy himself with writing such character studies.  Maggie's 
psychology is filled in rather interestingly.  One part of her is compliant, 
Zelig-like, in that she likes her eggs cooked the very same way as the man 
she is currently engaged to  marry.  Another part is egotistical, 
attention-seeking.  But after all, she is independent and competent, her job 
as hardware expert taking her into the obscure realm of antique fixtures and 
restoration.  She even designs lamps fabricated from a funky selection of 
electrical components.  Roberts handles Maggie with comfort: she's much more 
mature than her character in Pretty Woman - though still not secure.  
Roberts is a good sport, too: at one point she grabs those lips of hers and 
imitates a duck-billed platypus!
As Peggy Flemming ("not the skater"), Joan Cusack is her normal excellent 
self.  She's a veteran, and one hopes that her future roles get more screen 
time.  Cusack has a manner both sincere and comical, and she has some 
delightful interaction with Roberts that suggest their characters go back to 
girlhood.
Maggie's hometown of Hale, Maryland plays a supporting role here too.  The 
screenwriters, Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott, often compare it to 
Mayberry, and this portrayal largely succeeds.  The result is a place gently 
satirized by Ike as he whistles the theme song to the 'The Andy Griffith 
Show" as he jogs beside Maggie riding her old-fashioned bike.  It's also a 
place that looks absolutely charming on screen, streets cozily arranged, 
storefronts invitingly shot.  A place, in short, that exists in our 
collective memory, mythic and non-existent.  A familiar and down-home burg 
120 miles south-southwest of Manhattan.  You can hear Garry Marshall with 
his New York accent saying, "OK, everything nice!  Roll it!"  Actually, the 
contrast between Hale's sleepy streets and the Big Apple locales functions 
nicely.
Though it will not be included in the canon of major American romantic 
comedies, Runaway Bride is entertaining fare.  We saw the film in its second 
week of release, and it is better than the buzz said it would be.  The PG 
rating is very pleasing, too - we brought along our daughter without any 
problem of pre-screening.


Title
Review for Thirteen Days (2000)
Unlike many Januarys, this month offers almost too many good releases to 
cover.
Director Roger Donaldson does a dynamic job with historic material  namely, 
the Cuban missile crisis of October, 1962  in the new film THIRTEEN DAYS.
Think it might be boring because it features politicians and events covered 
briefly in history books?  Think again.
Bruce Greenwood plays President John F. Kennedy facing a situation that 
would define him as a leader.  Several months after the U.S.-supported 
invasion of Cuba failed (the Bay of Pigs), the Kennedy administration is 
confronted by perhaps the hardest fact of the Cold War.  The Soviet Union is 
raising their level of support for Fidel Castro and his Communist regime in 
Cuba.  Building a missile base on the island of Cuba, just 90 miles from the 
mainland United States, is unacceptable.  Because the missiles are some of 
the most dangerous nuclear weapons the world has seen, action is compulsory. 
  Of course the pressure on the young president and his cabinet is great.
Kevin Costner plays Kenny O'Donnell, a character who is a composite of JFK's 
advisors.  It's been said that Costner made the right decision in not 
playing either Kennedy or his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy.  
Certainly this is the strongest performance and the strongest material 
turned in by Costner in some time.  We see O'Donnell's life divided between 
family and job: as we see, family life is disrupted greatly.  One reason 
Costner was smart to take the O'Donnell role is that his character is the 
pivot of the narrative.  O'Donnell has probably several more minutes than 
anyone else, and we see the action through this unassuming narrator.
The script and direction are equally competent in keeping the story moving.  
With the help of many documents obtained only recently by the National 
Archives, the movie enables us to see the crisis from many vantages.  One 
key fact long hidden by government safekeepers:  Russian commanders in Cuba 
possessed tactical nuclear weapons, bombs that could have proven devastating 
to our troops and ordnance in any short of conflict.
Greenwood plays the President well.  He never goes over the top, and his New 
England accent is not distracting.  The actor playing Robert, Steven Culp, 
has actually appeared in the role previously, and his looks and manner are 
striking.  We especially sympathize with this powerful politician during a 
scene in which Kenny O'Donnell is driving him to his office to meet with the 
Russian foreign minister.  Bobby Kennedy expresses exhaustion and 
frustration with his reputation of being ruthless.
Costner is the star of this film.  Although his own accent (his character 
grew up knowing the Kennedys) is at times distracting, this veteran actor is 
able to convince us thoroughly.  We get a sense of several dimensions of the 
Washington power structure, and we see just how important are presidential 
advisors in striking deals and averting crises.  The scenes featuring 
O'Donnell's family nicely evoke the American scene of the early 1960's.
Henry Strozier is strong as one of Kennedy's more prominent cabinet members, 
Secretary of State, even though his role is small.  In an even tinier role, 
Walter Adrian speaks one line as vice president Lyndon Baines Johnson.  
Frank Wood portrays McGeorge Bundy, and Janet Coleman is the President's 
secretary, Evelyn Lincoln.
The star of the support cast is Dylan Baker as Secretary of Defense Robert 
McNamara.  This role lets Baker portray the guts it must have taken to stare 
down not only the `Red Menace' but also the hawkish American generals who 
were dubious of the President's methods of operation.
THIRTEEN DAYS would be especially effective for students in high school 
Government or American History classes.  It's a good story set in a vastly 
important time in American history, and it's told with a quick pace and 
timeless tension.  Donaldson also does a nice job paying tribute to the 
Kennedy brothers, without getting too much into the cults of personality and 
family surrounding them.  Ultimately the story honors their memories, as 
well as the spirit of America itself, at the heart of which is freedom.

Review for Contender, The (2000)
Rod Lurie's THE CONTENDER is a solid enough political drama, but in this 
fall's offerings of high-powered action and big-name-directed comedy, it's 
likely to be forgotten fast.
If Joan Allen doesn't get a nomination for her Senator Laine Hanson, and if 
Gary Oldman doesn't actually carry home the Best Supporting Actor statuette 
for his cagey Congressman Sheldon Runyon  well, something's rotten in 
Hollywood.
Much of THE CONTENDER is run-of-the-mill.  Vice-president dies.  Leading 
candidate for replacement is jilted in favor of female senator from Ohio.  
Ms. Hanson is a former Republican, and Democratic President Jackson Evans 
(Jeff Bridges) realizes this as a plus: voters would reject someone too far 
to the left.  The main complications come when decades-old photographs 
surface.  They allegedly show Hanson as a college student, engaged in an 
orgy, as part of sorority initiation.  Heck, the movie is not that original 
in the way in which Hanson reacts to these accusations.  She refuses to deny 
them, in fact refuses even to dignify their existence by entering into any 
type of dialogue concerning them.
Ruthless Representative Shelly Runyon is clearly out to get Hanson.  He has 
made clear that the President's first choice, Governor Jack Hathaway 
(William L. Peterson), would glide through the congressional hearings that 
are giving Hanson so much grief.
What makes the film strong is not so much Allen's excellent performance as 
the performances of those around her.  Bridges is an old smoothie by now, 
his eyebrows taking on the bushiness of his father's, and his manner taking 
on believable authority as he ages.  Christian Slater stands out in the 
supporting role of a Democratic rookie who seeks the truth at whatever cost. 
  Rough-looking Sam Elliot has dropped his dragoon's mustache to play 
presidential advisor Kermit Newman.  Certainly the cast goes a long way 
toward making the picture much better than average.
A few twists and turns take the rest of the responsibility.  Although I was 
never `on the edge of my seat,' I watched raptly as several plot details 
made it hard to predict what would happen.
Most of all, Gary Oldman  also the executive producer of this outing  
transforms himself into a political Svengali of ambition.  I was unaware of 
Oldman's involvement in the movie; it was not until I spotted his name  
preceding Allen's in the closing credits  that I realized it was he.  This 
balding and unattractive Washington insider looks very different from the 
Russian terrorist in AIR FORCE ONE or from Beethoven in IMMORTAL BELOVED.  
Oldman's acting here makes me believe it's his character who causes the 
story to hang together, in spite of the blatant agendas the film preaches  
namely surrounding women's rights to serve in high political office, and 
women's right to choose abortions.  (It's a small but unfortunate thing, 
too, that Runyon is given character traits that stereotype him as Jewish.)
Though Lurie causes the movie to go on a bit too long, at two hours and 20 
minutes, he does keep our attention to the end.  The target audience may be 
limited for this subject matter, but intelligence and fine acting make this 
a must-see for serious movie-goers unafraid to sit there in the dark and 
think.

Review for October Sky (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
The week after the release of 'Blast from the Past' (set partly in the 
early 1960's), 'October Sky' opened in American theaters.  Set around 
the time of the Sputnik launch, 'Sky' is the superior of the two films.
The opening shots establish the story in the town of Coalwood, West 
Virginia in October of 1957, scenes of Americana drifting by - a barber 
paused in his shaving of a patron, folks gathered in a diner, all 
listening to reports of the shot heard and seen around the world, the 
start of the space race.  The camera settles in a classroom of Big Creek 
High School, where Miss Riley (Laura Dern) tells her charges that the 
Russian launch is a milestone in history.  Some students are cynical, 
and later we hear one comment, "Let 'em have space.  We have rock 'n' 
roll!"
Seventeen year-old Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) loses himself in 
dreams of rockets after the townspeople are held spellbound by the 
actual satellite moving across the sky, disappearing behind a wooded 
mountain.  When Homer makes up his mind to find out all he can about 
rocketry, he enlists the help of the school nerd, Quentin (Chris Owen) 
and two old buddies, Roy Lee (William Lee Scott) and O'Dell (Chad 
Lindberg).  Their first attempt is a cylinder filled with bottle rocket 
powder, a contraption that takes out a goodly section of Mrs. Hickam's 
white picket fence.  What follows is the boys' determined efforts to rig 
and launch a workable missile.  John Hickam (Chris Cooper), manager of 
the town's industry, the Olga Coal Company, forbids anything related to 
rockets on company property.  So the foursome walks the eight miles to 
Snake Root, where they construct a pad on a massive slag pile.
A good deal of humor accrues when the launches fail again and again.  
The homemade rockets explode in various manners - before they leave the 
ground, a few feet in the air, or after a series of mis-aimed - and at 
times dangerous - short flights.  Of course the boys meet various 
obstacles, including continued resistance from Homer's dad, and a run-in 
with the police.  Will they succeed even in entering the regional 
science fair, an event that Miss Riley says may lead to the national 
fair, and on to possible college scholarships?  In other words, will the 
boys stumble upon a way out of a future of toil and black lung disease, 
of living in company houses in a town that exists, literally, to mine 
coal?
Director Joe Johnston and screenwriter Lewis Colick make good use of 
this theme of taking a shot at the American dream.  Their story moves 
logically, if a bit predictably, the boys meeting and outsmarting one 
problem after another.  Perhaps we believe in their successes so readily 
because we are told early about the true basis for the film.  Homer H. 
Hickam Jr. wrote the memoir 'Rocket Boys', and the historical tone set 
by the plot events serves to convince viewers of accuracy.
Tinged by nostalgia, the film shows us several sides of American life.  
We watch the boys grow through an important stage, one which pits them 
against the trials of young manhood.  Yes, it's a cliché when they try 
to get a leg-up on their way out of dreary futures, but their plights 
are all the more poignant because of the time: we ask ourselves if these 
conditions could have existed so recently.
A result of solid casting, the acting in the film is outstanding.  Laura 
Dern is the biggest name but has a smallish part.  Though her accent 
sounds like it comes from parts south of West Virginia, Dern is 
thoroughly convincing as a teacher gutsy enough to stand up to a 
principal who says, "We're here to give these boys an education, not 
false hopes."  Chris Cooper is a veteran character actor who plays John 
Hickam as a hard man. Our distance toward him changes continuously.  We 
dislike him when he busts a company machinist for helping Homer weld a 
steel washer onto a rocket;  we like him for his strange reveling at 
being good at what he does - knowing the mine like a man, and saving 
many men from crippling or fatal accidents.  Cooper plays well an 
average-looking man up thrown in against not only a tough job, but his 
son's vision of a life that doesn't include coal mining.
But Jake Gyllenhaal is the big discovery here.  This young man has no 
trouble pretending the camera isn't there.  His looks and mannerisms are 
thoroughly American - tough, independent, fun-loving.   He also carries 
scenes without overshadowing the actors around him.
The photography is mostly seamless, getting the job done without calling 
too much attention to itself.  There is a shot that lingers just too 
long on the maw of the mineshaft elevator - the hole down which the 
lives of Coalwood's men disappear.  Other scenes are edited masterfully, 
especially the montages of the boys' mishaps.  Long shots of rocket 
ascents inspire the proper awe.
The score is punctuated by period songs, early rock and roll standards 
that help set the mood even faster than the vintage sedans parked all 
over the streets.  Important scenes are frequently accompanied by a lone 
violin wavering between classical air and fiddle piece.
Why is 'October Sky' better than 'Blast from the Past'?  Their different 
natures would warrant a much longer review.  The main point of 
comparison is the handling of mid-century America.  'Blast from the 
Past' picks and chooses film clips about the Cuban missile crisis and 
sets that highlight early 60's interior decoration, all in service of a 
romantic comedy with big name players.  'October Sky' is a smaller film 
that shows slices of grittier realism, a vehicle that recalls a time 
filled both with prosperity and anxiety.  Although the last several 
minutes are filled with too many plot twists, and perhaps try too hard 
to avoid sentimentality, 'October Sky' is a strong addition to the canon 
of truly American tales.


Title
Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
A sore subject with many Americans is the absence of a national memorial 
dedicated to the men and women who served and perished in World War II.  
Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN will not stand as this memorial.  
But the film is noteworthy because of the ways it bestows a profound 
tribute and respect.
I was lucky to be able to watch with my father, a WW II veteran.  We sat 
in the third row, the crowded theater taking our options.  Glancing 
behind me during the film, and talking with my father afterwards, I 
concluded that no other film about war packs the sustained power of 
Spielberg's treatment.
Only ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and GALLIPOLI carry similar moments 
that show personal horrors.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN opens with a prologue 
in which a veteran visits an American cemetery in France.  The man walks 
ahead of his extended family, his face caving in under his memories.  
Soon we see the men in the LCIs landing on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944.  
Some soldiers retch, some kiss the crucifixes of their rosaries;  all 
are afraid.  From a monologue delivered in a dark church to the private 
torment of a shell-shocked translator, the film creates a relentless 
emotional tension.  
One of the agents that makes this mood is the camera.  We witness the 
first hour from the points of view of hand-held cameras, some shots so 
jerky they are uncomfortable to watch.  After Captain John Miller (Tom 
Hanks) receives orders to bring to safety Private James Ryan, whose 
three brothers have been killed in action, we continue to watch many 
skirmishes from on-the-spot vantages.  Matched with editing that is 
quick and transparent, the camera work makes the viewer's experience 
visceral.  
The sets and costumes further the terrifying realism.  Although there 
are no long shots of the entire Operation Overlord, the part of the 
invasion we can see is dead-on.  Machine gun nests, bunkers, weaponry 
and vehicles -- these elements engage us easily into the narrative.  
After Capt. Miller picks his squad and sets off behind enemy lines to 
locate James Francis Ryan of Iowa (Matt Damon), we see more locations 
that telegraph the story's accuracy.  Bombed houses, splintered planks 
everywhere, and rubble-strewn streets resemble photographs of real 
battle scenes.  And the costumes are correct.  My father says perhaps a 
few too many helmets are covered in netting, but otherwise the designers 
are sharp.  The canvas belts, the jackets, the occasional puttees laced 
around the calves -- these are the outfits of 1944. 
Do technical aspects make the actors' work easier?  They are certainly 
related, but the acting here is self-reliant.  It is hard to identify an 
unnatural performance or an unnecessary character.  Tom Hanks tints John 
Miller with mannerisms and tone that evoke sympathy.  The motif of his 
shaking hand reminds us that even the strongest and wisest leaders are 
human.  If politics are just this year, Hanks will pull nominations for 
major awards.  I would also cite Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath, 
a sturdy confidant to Miller.  Perhaps the toughest supporting role is 
Damon's.  The long build-up  of the squad's resentment toward Pvt. Ryan 
is dispelled almost immediately when we finally see him.  (I understand 
there was some actual resentment because Damon did not experience the 
mini boot-camp imposed upon the actors in Miller's squad.)  
I'll offer one critical comment about the director, and then I'll praise 
him.  The ending of the film, while effective, does not flow as well as 
the last moments of SCHINDLER'S LIST.  The frame tale to which LIST 
returns works better, developing a personal epic weightiness.  Anyhow, 
Spielberg has a talent for choosing important themes, whether or not his 
film is a serious drama or a lighter "entertainment."  RYAN links 
mesmerizing episodes of war with moments of characterization you would 
expect in a fine short story.  It even throws in some laughs for relief.  
We are fortunate that Spielberg has wrought an honest portrayal, one 
that affirms the values of the 1940's and deems them worthy today.  
As a boy in the 1960's, playing "Army" with cap guns and real surplus 
canteens donated to our Scout troop, I saw the Second World War as a 
romantic adventure.  It was like following Vic Morrow from "Combat" 
around our backyards.
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN reinforced to me that the war following the Great 
War was just as hellish as the fighting in Vietnam -- which I heard 
about on television every night as I grew up.
The film reminded me why my father and hundreds of thousands of people 
of his generation sacrificed their time and their lives.  We, their 
daughters and sons, must live in a free world.  We must inherit or cause 
the eventuality of not having to fight and die ourselves.
Perhaps the hushed audience in the multiplex realized these ideas as the 
credits rolled.  It's one type of memorial I'm sure our parents and 
grandparents would want, an anti-war movie viewed by millions.


Title
Review for Pearl Harbor (2001)
Just in time for Memorial Day Weekend of 2001, producers Jerry Bruckheimer 
and Michael Bay have brought out PEARL HARBOR, their treatment of the sneak 
attack with which the Japanese military  according to one of their own 
admirals  "awakened the sleeping giant" of the United States.
It was the final catalyst that brought our country into the complicated 
global skirmish of the Second World War, which had been raging for more than 
two years across different continents.  Needless to say, the attack on 
December 7, 1941, and the events surrounding it, would be difficult topics 
for any filmmaker.  That director Michael Bay succeeds in many dimensions is 
most commendable;  but the film is not the epic he has tried to engineer.
The opening scenes show a couple of tow-headed American boys in Tennessee in 
1923, playing war in a dusty plane parked in a barn.  We don't discover why 
this plane is abandoned when viable aviation had been around only ten years 
or so (could a plane get so dusty if it were used just five years before, in 
the Great War?).  A charming little opening, the action has little Rafe 
McCawley (played as an adult by Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (played later 
by Josh Hartnett) accidentally begin a take-off in a real plane, the crop 
duster belonging to Rafe's dad.  Characterization kicks in when Danny's 
father starts to whup his little boy, and Rafe conks the offender with a 
board  from here on, Rafe is Danny's guardian, a role we know will be 
tested in the future.
Skip ahead to 1940-41, when the boys are young men and aspiring pilots for 
the Army Air Corps.  In several of the scenes Bay and screenwriter Randall 
Wallace sketch their characters as likable and vibrant, but the rather 
slow-paced romance that develops between Rafe and Navy nurse Evelyn Johnson 
(Kate Beckinsdale) bogs down the story.  Only the interesting historical 
background redeems the story in the first hour or so.  We follow Rafe in his 
odyssey with the squadron of American pilots who flew with the British 
against the German Air Force  before any American declaration of war.  We 
watch a few human interest plots develop out on Oahu, at the base at Pearl 
Harbor.  Hawaii was thought to be a safe and distant outpost. But the 
Japanese Empire was pursuing their own military and industrial agendas, 
putting them on a collision course with the Pacific fleet of the United 
States.
When Rafe returns from his harrowing journey, his best friend has taken his 
girl, an old but still striking twist of events.  Yes, there is turmoil 
among the three young and passionate people; but the attack that shook the 
world interrupts the love triangle, and provides us with very exciting 
action.
I was hoping that the film would take all necessary steps to preserve the 
dignity of all of the Americans who died in the raid, and all those who 
survived it.  For the most part, this dignity comes out intact.  Part of the 
hype surrounding this huge movie event, as a matter of fact, has been 
involvement with survivors, veterans now around 80 who are educating younger 
generations through interviews and television specials.  In one scene, 
Colonel Jimmy Dolittle, the flying ace of the First World War who is now 
leading a raid on Tokyo, comments that victory will be ours.  When he points 
to Rafe and Danny, we know that he is speaking of the entire generation of 
solid Americans who would exert whatever efforts required to defeat the Axis 
powers.
You have to hand it to Michael Bay.  He knows what patriotic chords to 
strike, what heartstrings to pluck.
Perhaps the most affecting moments come when President Roosevelt, himself an 
icon to our eyes, reflects the iconography of the times.  Jon Voight is very 
credible as the President (save for the foam padding lining his neck); when 
he delivers the ingenious rhetoric of Roosevelt and his policymakers ("Tell 
that to the Marines") and especially when he struggles out of his 
wheelchair to argue a point, we sit enrapt and tingling with patriotism.  
Fortunately, Bay does not linger on sepia-tinted scenes of yesteryear, as he 
did in ARMAGEDDON, in which we were made to watch men sitting around 
traditional barber shops, listening to the radio, or children running 
through dust motes and past a mural of JFK still visible on clapboard stores 
40 years after his election.  Thank goodness this tone of mindless jingoism 
does not come through in PEARL.
Many of the shots remind us that Michael Bay got his chops directing videos 
that riveted the interest of MTV fans.  At times the pace is frantic; in one 
sequence during the main attack, viewers are assaulted with at least 30 
different shots in one minute.  It is always a challenge to watch such a 
series of images;  with any text that moves so quickly, the viewer must 
spend enormous energy just to make sense of the events.  More viewings would 
be needed to notice the finer points of composition and detail.
The images are remarkable, though.  In this new look at the attack, computer 
generation is used very well.  Seeing such a large portion of the U.S. 
Pacific fleet at anchor inspires awe.  It's a great recreation of the ships, 
and some of the best battle footage has the camera zooming straight through 
the strafing and bombing, the battleships exploding all around.  Still, we 
see a fuzziness about the bottom of the shots, as if we are watching 
animated paintings of the conflict, perhaps an artist's grim and smoky 
depiction for the cover of a paperback novel.  Dog fights are also 
supercharged by computer generated images.  Tracers zip and scream 
everywhere, adding to the furor of the new war.  No doubt many of the Zeros 
are digital replicas  but their sheer numbers are astounding (Japanese 
Commander Fuchida attacked with over 350 planes, and lost 29 to ground fire 
and a small pack of American pilots who managed to get aloft).  It's hard to 
tell which explosions are enhanced, but the gore of the casualties lends 
realism in many scenes.  At times Bay blurs the picture to simulate the 
chaos created by the carnage.  We watch Evelyn and her fellow nurses 
scramble around the once-empty base hospital, now packed with panic-and 
pain-stricken soldiers and sailors.  These shots are effectively crafted and 
arranged to evoke the mood of sudden tragedy.
Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett both deliver good performances.  Their acting 
is transparent, and their brotherly relationship causes us to realize that 
they will go on as brothers despite loving the same woman.  These actors do 
all that is asked of them, though some of it is telegraphed too early for my 
tastes; I got the bitter taste of predictability early, like a penny touched 
to the tongue.
Kate Beckinsdale does fine in filling her role; she is sufficiently at a 
loss when she discovers she must choose between the men she loves.  An 
engaging subplot develops with Evelyn and her fellow nurses, and we are 
moved when the larger conflict encroaches upon their lives.  A small rub: 
the long and flowing hairstyles of some of these women are laughable in a 
hospital setting.
Tom Sizemore and Dan Ackroyd are underused, as a gruff plane mechanic and a 
code-breaking specialist, respectively.  Wonderful character actors, they 
are.  The same can't be said of Alec Baldwin, a good actor given lines full 
of platitudes and feel-good bravado: thanks to the script, his Dolittle is a 
cardboard commanding officer of the type that Baldwin might himself mock on 
a future "Saturday Night Live."
It was very heartening to look around the theater and spot viewers of 
various ages.  Early summer movies hoping to become blockbusters usually try 
to attract teenagers, a key to financial success at the box office.  But I 
spotted several watchers who were children on that fateful Sunday morning of 
the actual attack. I can imagine the film will be used in middle and high 
school history classes, though the long running time would probably result 
in only scenes being shown.  In any case, the PG-13 rating is warranted 
because of combat violence and language, with one love scene in which there 
is no nudity.
PEARL HARBOR falls short of epic status, though it does honor the  men and 
women represented by these actors.  Of course visual tribute is paid to the 
generation who lived through Pearl Harbor  in the devastating scenes of the 
battleships and other vessels buckled and sunk by torpedoes, in underwater 
shots of sailors and an American flag riddled with holes.  The real 
Battleship Arizona appears at the end, its big guns encrusted with rust and 
plant life.  In our image-conscious world, all of these shots helps to 
memorialize Americans who sacrificed their hearts and lives; but perhaps the 
best homage is paid through reminding young viewers about the identity of 
Americans, through reviving the history that helped to shape the world we 
live in every day.

Review for Shrek (2001)
Most of the 89 minutes of the computer animated SHREK are a delightful 
lampoon of fairy tales.  The trouble is, SHREK ends up following the same 
sanitized formula at which it had been thumbing its nose.
DreamWorks SKG has translated William Steig's children's book into a slick 
story to hold the attention of today's audiences.  It's really a clichéd 
tale, when you think about it  an outsider in the form of the big green 
ogre Shrek( voiced by Mike Meyers, with a Scottish, who wants his privacy 
back when all kinds of storybook characters, evicted from their abodes, show 
up in Shrek's part of the forest; Shrek takes a sidekick (the Donkey is 
voiced by Eddie Murphy, by far the best voice actor in the movie) and 
commences a quest to find Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz).
Sound familiar?  Needless to say, you can see the ending from across the 
forest, even through  all of the trees.
There are lots of good things SHREK has going for it, though.  Worthy 
satires have creative villains, and John Lithgow pulls the bad guy off 
wonderfully here  Lord Farquaad is a little stump of a man with a pompous 
voice  he even has fake legs into which he inserts his own short ones when 
he rides his horse.  And something grand happens to him at the end, as well.
There's a moment of absolute sick hilarity, when Fiona has a seemingly sweet 
whistling duel with a smiling birdie.  When it tries a pitch as high as 
Fiona's, the camera pans away and we sense the bird has exploded!  What 
happens to the three eggs in its nest?  Fiona fries them and serves them to 
Shrek and Donkey!  SHREK is at its best when it tries to emulate the spirit 
created by POLITICALLY INCORRECT BEDTIME STORIES.
Directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson pace the story well enough, and 
use the animation for all kinds of delightful effects.  I would recommend 
seeing SHREK if you ever were a fan of Mother Goose, The Brothers Grimm; 
alas, if you are a fan of Disney films, you will not be disappointed at the 
end, but you will have to sit through some archly funny moments.


Title
Review for Enemy of the State (1998)
A Film Review (in the form of a Q/A session) by Mark O'Hara
Q: Tony Scott has a reputation as a solid director of action films.  
Describe scenes from "Enemy of the State" that perpetuate this idea.
A:  After a well-done but rather conventional opening, the credits roll, 
probably unwatched, over frenetic vantages of Washington D.C. exteriors, 
spliced into shots of high-tech monitors, screens showing vehicles 
tracked from satellites 155 miles above the Earth.  Several times the 
camera freezes and jerks in perspective, creating an effect both 
fascinating and dizzying.  Early on we witness chase scenes that leave 
us panting.  One idea established early is that the government 
agents-gone-wrong - the ones doing the chasing - are ruthless and 
amoral;  they are young and fleet of foot, their short hair standing up 
with gel.  What is noticeable is the frequency of their failure, 
especially after they stop merely trying to trace Robert Dean (Will 
Smith) and really try to rub him out.  This is a necessary convention.  
The pursuit we see is tense and original, showing the tenacity of one 
man, usually on foot, trying to recover his life.  In a sequence inside 
a tunnel, Dean flees on foot as the agents converge;  in a slick stunt 
he slips just in time out of a ventilation shaft and back into the 
tunnel, where he once again uses his wits to disappear. The vehicle 
chases are not as stunning as those in "Bullitt" or "The French 
Connection," but the scenes of Dean - and especially of Dean and Brill 
(Gene Hackman) escaping together -- are well choreographed and essential 
to the theme of individuals triumphing over a culture in which privacy 
is taking heavy hits.  Scott shows his experience as a director with a 
penchant for action.
Q:  Describe camera angles or shots that establish a mood of tension. 
A:  There are nifty Dutch angles arranged during an argument between 
Dean and his wife Carla (Regina King), her canted face yelling back at 
him.  Clearly, Dean's life is being turned on end.  We watch a surplus 
of scenes taken from satellites, as the operatives for the National 
Security Agency track their prey, bodies or cars bracketed by target 
lines as if about to be smart-bombed.  Everywhere we look there is a 
sense of paranoia, including scenes in which the FBI is staking out an 
Italian restaurant.  In these aspects the film hearkens back to things 
Copollian - "The Godfather," "The Conversation," even the eerily dark 
"Apocalypse Now."  
Q:  Describe the qualities that veteran actors Jason Robards (as Senator 
Hammersly) and Gabriel Byrne (as the pseudo-Brill) bring to their brief 
roles.
A:  Their appearances are short but masterful.  As Hammersly, Robards' 
acting is as transparent as the prose of a well-seasoned writer.  We 
believe he is principled enough to refuse an offer he shouldn't have 
refused, and the plot hinges on his wrong decision.  In his role as 
"Brill," Byrne acts with smooth efficiency and assurance, completing his 
assignment of throwing off both Robert Dean and the viewer.  What 
casting!
Q:  How do you think the role of Robert Clayton Dean affects the career 
of Will Smith?
A:  A good move.  I heard it said that this is his first starring role, 
but wasn't he at the head of the ensemble casts - if they can be so 
called - of "Independence Day" and "Men In Black"?  (Plus, he's garnered 
the lines of James West, after first being touted as Artie Gordon, in 
"The Wild, Wild West.")  Smith once again proves likable and believable 
in the way he relates to others, and he even manages to pull off two or 
three stints of comic relief in this chase-heavy drama.  A cultural 
aside:  Smith makes a canny self-reference to race when a mobster makes 
a bad choice of words.  Other than this, Smith and his wife and son, 
along with Lisa Bonet as Rachel, are the only blacks in the cast;  not 
much African-American culture is reflected here.  And there are two 
Hispanics, one a nanny, the other a maid.  The last word:  I will pay to 
see Smith again, partly because I like his advocating of discipline and 
responsibility, both in his acting and in his music.
Q:  Critique Gene Hackman's performance as Brill.
A:  Ahead of the ideas and Smith's performance, Hackman is the best 
thing about the movie.  First, his looks are perfect - a sixty-something 
original "techie" who went underground after a debacle in Iran in 1980.  
He is appropriately grizzled and stoic, his hypoglycemia adding to his 
gruffness.  Brill has "disappeared" himself and surfaces only when 
contracted to gather information.  As he demonstrates through his 
expression, his easy way of characterizing complex personalities, and 
his collection of subtle mannerisms, Hackman is one of the very best 
living actors. 
Q:  Explain the main conflict of the film.
A:  After a member of Congress dies mysteriously, a Washington labor 
lawyer, Robert Dean, finds his career ruined and his life in grave 
danger.  Officials in a renegade division of the National Security 
Agency are trying to recover a recording of the Senator's murder, and 
they stop at almost nothing along the way.  (At least they do not kidnap 
the wife or kid:  that would have turned the film into the worst kind of 
"jep" story.)  For quite a while Dean does not know the reason he is 
being hunted;  he thinks a mob boss is after him.  In an ingenious 
conclusion, the main narrative meshes into the subplot involving the 
mobster's videotape the villains on both sides meeting in the kitchen of 
the Italian restaurant.  Another twist is that something happens to the 
tape of the murder, and Dean enlists Brill's help to turn the tables on 
the government thugs.  Yes, this film will inspire paranoia among many 
viewers, but a little thinking about the real speed of most government 
agencies will provide a sense of security!
Q:  Is there too much action in the film?  Are there enough ideas to 
balance with the action?
A:    Having heard from one critic that the film was nothing but a 
collection of slick chase scenes, I went into the theater wary.  I was 
pleasantly taken aback when I was not only entertained by the action, 
but fascinated by the implications.  "Enemy of the State" is layered 
with meanings, ideas that build momentum just as surely as the plot 
builds to a climax.  Because of how subtly these ideas accumulate, the 
film is deceptive in its power.  We witness scene after scene of 
relentless pursuits, deteriorating personal lives, and a host of other 
cliches.  Nevertheless, the material works.  For one, we feel close to 
Dean and Brill;  the number of jams  they fall into and climb out of 
finally pushes the film well past mediocrity.  And the handling of the 
issues of personal privacy, loyalty, and morality provides the viewer 
with plenty outlets for intelligent thought.  I'm reminded of how a 
rather mediocre story like "Mr. Holland's Opus," through its time span 
and patient presentation of themes, became an outstanding film.  "Enemy 
of the State" is from a different genre, but I think some of the same 
patterns apply.
Q:  Would you recommend the film to a friend?  Why or why not?
A:  Yes, and I would urge the friend to feel free to hate it if he or 
she finds reason.  Over the last several months, I have come across many 
negative early reviews, only to hear later that a film is excellent.  
Will I stop reading reviews of films before I see them?  Of course not.  
But I'll remember how crucial it is to think for myself about the 
quality of a film, and I'll remember that part of that quality is highly 
subjective:  Was it pleasing to me, and if it has been judged a poor 
film, were the critics' words valid?  "Enemy of the State" contains some 
objectionable language, but mostly its R rating comes from violent 
scenes, especially one near the end.  I think most viewers will be 
captivated by both its quick wit and action.

Review for Legend of Bagger Vance, The (2000)
For fans of golf  or any sport, for that matter  THE LEGEND OF BAGGER 
VANCE will capture the interest if not the imagination.  The philosophy 
spouted by the caddy Bagger Vance (Will Smith) frequently goes too far, but 
sport has always been a metaphor for life and the pursuits inherent in life. 
  And certainly the golf exhibition match at the center of the narrative is 
one of the best things about the film.
Based on Steven Pressfield's novel, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE chronicles 
the attempt of an erstwhile rich Southern belle, Adele Invergordon (Charlize 
Theron), to save her dead father's golf resort from the ravages of the Great 
Depression.  A cadre of rich Savannah businessmen wish to purchase the 
resort for a song, but Adele thinks on her feet of an exhibition she hopes 
will attract the star golfers of the time  Bruce McGill as Walter Hagen, 
and Joel Gretsch as Bobby Jones.  Hoping in a small way to thwart her, the 
men call for the involvement of a third golfer, someone local.  After a few 
names are passed over, a young golf fanatic named Hardy Greaves (J. Michael 
Montcrief) suggests `Captain Junuh.'  This man Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) 
is the one we see near the film's start;  he's racing into the slaughter of 
a World War One battle, where it seems he is the sole survivor.  To be 
brief, Junuh loses himself.  Traumatized, he disappears for a decade, 
failing to return to Adele, who happens to be his intended.  After several 
scenes during which Hardy and Adele attempt to convince the down-and-out 
Junuh to play in the match, perhaps even to recapture the position he won as 
a young man  the best golfer in the South  Junuh decides to give it a 
swing.
So the stage is set for the two-day exhibition, $10,000 for the prize, with 
the bigger stake being, of course, Junuh's soul.
Will Smith nicely underplays the mysterious caddy of the film's title.  
Vance appears suddenly and speaks with such nonchalance and self-assurance 
that Junuh hires him without knowing anything of his background.  Though the 
rhetoric he spreads is sometimes pure corn, Smith is able to keep his 
character likable if not believable.  A problem with the title character is 
that he is too much without a history, and we never know him well enough to 
view him as a real human.  On the other hand, director Robert Redford and 
screenwriter Jeremy Leven never elevate him into the realm of magic;  Bagger 
is apparently not some genie sidekick that has no life aside from the wishes 
of his master.
At the heart of the argument that this film is mediocre is its failure to 
create a spirit of enthusiasm and magic.  I have seen THE NATURAL  starring 
Redford, by the way, as Roy Hobbs  and THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE is no THE 
NATURAL.  Yes, Redford was older and more experienced than Matt Damon when 
Redford played the main character in Bernard Malamud's mythic baseball opus. 
  But Damon often seems plastic in this role.  Is he trying too hard to 
portray a man shell-shocked out of his former easy manner?  Does his trouble 
result from playing opposite Theron as Adele: a good actress herself trapped 
with an underdeveloped character?  It's hard to tell.  But clearly the film 
lacks the several enchanting moments that a sports drama needs to succeed.
Bruce McGill is good as the semi-slimy Walter Hagen, a spoiled sports figure 
ahead of his time.  Further, the handsome Joel Gretsch is very convincing as 
the Renaissance man Bobby Jones, his determination clear in his glare.  And 
a nice discovery is J. Michael Montcrief as Hardy Greaves, the young 
narrator.  Hardy supplies both comic relief and the innocence necessary to 
make the golf-as-way-of-life hokum even a little believable.  Jack Lemon is 
Hardy as a senior golfer, who opens and closes the film;  too bad Lemon is 
underused in the frame, though his voice is welcome in many parts of the 
long story.
Cinematography is strong in THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE.  The exteriors are 
beautiful, the golf course, the woods, even the haze of the battlefield in 
the brief warfare scenes.  A couple of shots smack of computer generation, 
as when we assume the viewpoint of Junuh's golf ball as it sails toward the 
green.  And I could swear the bank of a lake looked plastic and unnatural as 
well.  These vantages are not bad, but neither do they make more convincing 
the events that the story tries so hard to make astounding.
In the end the film is mildly satisfying, and would be a nice choice for a 
rental.  As a sports movie I would place it on a par with another athletic 
flick out now, REMEMBER THE TITANS, and well ahead of Keven Costner's 
baseball debacle, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME.


Title
Review for Pleasantville (1998)
There is no town called "Pleasantville" in my state.  But as my son and 
I left the theater, we saw a scene that could have been Main Street in 
the film Pleasantville.  The uptown area of a midwestern town: banks and 
small businesses, a gas station and United Dairy Farmers on the corner.  
Red bricks pave the street.
Gary Ross's version of Pleasantville has to be taken as a fable.  There 
are too many unexplained motives and twists.  Why would a TV repairman 
(Don Knotts) show up at a house just seconds after the remote is broken?  
Why would he send the children of the house into the black-and-white 
world of a 1958 sitcom?  How do the two survive there without access to 
bathrooms?
Once you have suspended your disbelief, however, Pleasantville is a 
pleasant diversion, one that is filled with delightful effects that 
generate fascinating ideas.
Tobey Maguire plays David, the slightly younger brother of Jennifer 
(Reese Witherspooon).  Quickly we see even David's sister perceives him 
as a dork;  one of her friends comments, "You must have come from, like, 
the cool side of the uterus."  It is when David and Jennifer have a tug 
o' war over a new and mysterious remote that they are thrust back into 
the pasty world of sexless situation comedy, the domain of Ozzie Nelson 
and Donna Reed and Robert Young (though here the teens get more of a 
taste of Rod Serling).  When the repairman refuses to speak with them, 
Bud and Mary Sue - the names of the TV characters they have replaced - 
are forced to inhabit the odd world whose "plots" David has memorized.
I was concerned that Pleasantville would jump on the bandwagon of 
cop-outs that dismisses large parts of the past as inferior and 
incorrect.  But the film is out neither to put down the past nor to 
pique our nostalgia.  What works best is the film's ideas.  First, it's 
one of the best arguments against censorship that has been added to our 
literature in some time.  A book burning scene is not as eerie, perhaps, 
as one in Fahrenheit 451, though its implications are just as chilling.  
More importantly, the film acts as the quintessential advertisement for 
the arts, going so far as to suggest they are indispensable to our 
humanity.  As a teacher, I only hope that younger viewers notice that 
good things happen to the residents when they read or paint.  The 
metaphorical black-and-white pallor vanishes in the person who goes 
after the "color" in life.
In Big and Dave, Gary Ross pursued unlikely storylines.  Here he expands 
upon his themes of magical accidents happening to everyday people.  And 
the tricks Ross employs are wonderful, the tale making use of technology 
not for explosions but for bizarre split-screens of color and meaning.  
A red rose is the first hue seen by Skip (Paul Walker), captain of the 
high school basketball team who has just been deflowered by Mary Sue 
Parker.  Her brother Bud connects the outbreaks of color to her 
transplanted 90's sensibilities.  Herein lies one of the film's 
weaknesses, when Bud constantly nags Mary Sue not to impose her 
behaviors on the innocent past.  It's as if we are watching a Bradbury 
story and the time travelers are threatened with the prospect of 
throwing off the entire future through a misplaced and miniscule action.  
It's Bud, too, who later tells his television dad, George Parker 
(William H. Macy), that change is inevitable and good, that it's harder 
to go back to the way you were before.
Ross is very clever when he re-enacts the fall of Adam and Eve, with a 
girl plucking a red apple from a black-and-white tree and tempting Bud.  
This is not heavy-handed symbolism; it's tongue-in-cheek mind-play, 
suggesting that life is happier when it is not sterile and perfect:  
it's best when there is silliness and sexiness and even danger.  
Timeless and entertaining ideas, these, the stuff of good literature.  
In one of the most charming subplots, Betty Parker finds her color by 
debunking the myths of dutiful wife and mother.  Looking like Pat Nixon 
again, Joan Allen is perfect in the role.  We chuckle when we see she 
must learn about sex from her daughter, who is now a regular at lover's 
lane.  And when Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels) rubs off the make-up she is 
using to cover her flesh tones, Betty realizes the potential of her own 
long-denied emotions.  Daniels also excels as Mr. Johnson, owner of the 
soda shop where Bud works.  Good at looking baffled at Bud's 
explanations, Daniels conveys the slow but complete change his character 
accomplishes.  Viewers will be fond of remembering a scene in which Bud 
brings Mr. Johnson a large art book from the library.  Johnson likes to 
paint Christmas scenes on the inside of his shop window, and here his 
epiphany is clear when he glimpses for the first time the Titians and 
Van Goghs, the sweet strains of Randy Newman's Pleasantville Suite 
rising in the background. 
Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon portray the most interesting 
relationship in the film.  As brother and sister, they bicker and ignore 
and defy, but just like the characters in the world they occupy, they 
end happily.  Witherspoon brings to her role a calculated agenda that 
only seems whimsical.  She puts on just the right wiles.  On the other 
hand, Maguire seems almost entirely innocent.  At times puzzled or 
frustrated, Maguire is best at the earnest straight-talking that serves 
as the film's most heavy-handed message, in a speech delivered to his 
real mother.  It's here that the script stumbles -- not Maguire's 
acting.  Both actors are beyond the teenage years they depict, but so 
probably are the rest of the supporting soda shop gang.
In his last role, J. T. Walsh is superb as "Big Bob," the mayor and 
head-honcho of the chamber of commerce and bowling league.  Walsh adds 
good comic timing to the dry edge given to his character, reminiscent of 
Dub Taylor or Martin Balsam, character actors capable of getting laughs 
out of dead-serious dialogue.  His short hair combed straight up in what 
the venerable barber in our town calls a "Princeton," Walsh wheedles and 
pontificates nicely.  The script fails him too, though, when his 
character charges off screen at the end of an otherwise powerful 
"trial."
I know why the producers chose the Beatles' song for the soundtrack, but 
why did they get Fiona Apple to sing it in a sleepy and sluggish voice?  
The other parts of the soundtrack are charming, Newman's generic but 
still moving compositions mixed with vintage pieces, snippets of which 
we hear at crucial spots in the story.
Leaving the theater, the film's ideas strong and immediate in my head, I 
remembered a Saturday afternoon eight years ago.  I had taken my son to 
see the first Ninja Turtles, and when we stepped out onto High Street, 
we saw a crowded and boisterous uptown.  I had forgotten about the Klan 
rally.  These happened in other towns, not ours.  As we stood before the 
old marquee of the Princess Theater, I thought quickly how I could get 
my 5 year-old to the car with safety and a minimal explanation.
It occurred to me that perhaps the most worthy part of Pleasantville is 
its attempt to engage profound ideas.  Sure, a lot is left unexplained, 
but we are also asked to think about the nature of hate and prejudice, 
the unpleasant colors in the human spectrum.


Title
Review for Hollow Man (2000)
This summer offering from director Paul Verhoeven (STARSHIP TROOPERS, 
ROBOCOP) is a science fiction thriller that blends an old story with very 
new special effects.  At its best, HOLLOW MAN highlights all of the unsavory 
implications of invisibility; at its worst, it panders to some of the baser 
requirements of modern movie-goers.
H.G. Wells' novel THE INVISIBLE MAN is invoked continuously in HOLLOW MAN.  
The story is by Gary Scott Thompson, the screenplay by Thompson and Andrew 
W. Marlowe.  But Wellsian influence is what really drives the story.  What 
happens when a scientific genius (in this update it's Sebastian Caine, 
played by Kevin Bacon) creates the means by which to make himself invisible? 
  Caine goes through the whole routine, only what he's after is cracking the 
key to becoming visible again.  When his team of brilliant assistants helps 
him bring back to visibility a large primate (gorilla), Caine volunteers 
himself as the first human to be injected with the top-secret serum that 
will make him unseen.
Thinking back to Wells' story, viewers will remember Claude Rains' character 
going crazy after becoming invisible.  Caine does the same.  In fact, the 
filmmakers add a good deal of foreshadowing to get us to believe Caine is 
capable of doing what he does in the final acts of the story.  One problem 
is that Caine is somewhat of a creep to begin with: he has been jilted by 
his right-hand colleague Linda Foster (Elisabeth Shue), and he flashes 
several signs of jealousy when he learns she has another man.  So we don't 
really feel close to Caine at any time.  Here's a paradox  viewers would be 
struck by the tragedy of the grotesque downfall of a man they admired, but 
perhaps for the purposes of modern thrillers, it is better to despise the 
fallen hero from the start.  Of course when Caine discovers the identity of 
Dr. Foster's new lover, he slides even more deeply into a dark envy followed 
by a plummet into psychotic behavior.
Here's the rub.  Watching, I was bothered not so much by my lack of empathy 
for Caine  it is easier, after all, to hate a non-human bogeyman, which the 
insane scientist clearly becomes, by turns ghost-like and grotesque.  What 
struck me was the pattern the story follows: think of any hard-to-kill 
monster from the last twenty years of cinema.  HOLLOW MAN could be traced 
even to one film, Ridley Scott's ALIEN, with Caine as the critter and Shue 
as Ripley.  I'm afraid not even the slick effects can offset the sour taste 
of derivative storyline.
One thing that could have added comic relief to HOLLOW MAN is more harmless 
pranks.  Couldn't Caine have cavorted around out in the world like Rains did 
when he terrorized the townspeople?  Here we witness simple terrorizing and 
worse.  (This does not include little touches on the hair and Caine's moving 
around Foster's can of Coca-Cola.)  The last word is that the film's outlook 
on humanity is bleak: one of the researchers announces early, assuming a 
God-like voice, that the project is doomed, the scientists cursed tampering 
with Creation.
The story does do a nice job of exposing the implications of invisibility, 
though.  The characters on Caine's team display constant paranoia and 
finally, dread.  This invisible fiend even has an advantage over a housefly, 
which cannot see the hand about to squash it.
The coolest aspect of the film is the effects, which receive at least equal 
billing with the human stars.  But here's a question posed by contemporary 
bio-ethicists everywhere: `Just because we can, does that mean we should?'  
Just because effects far-outdistance the reality of the effects of movies 
years ago, it doesn't mean the movies are any better.  Plainly, the film 
relies too heavily on computer-assisted magic.
The acting is as good as the story permits it to be.  Kevin Bacon is one of 
our finest actors, but he should probably talk with Tom Hanks about gaining 
a knack for spotting just the right script.  Bacon is capable of showing 
more humanity than he is allowed to show here.  Caine seems an egomaniacal, 
brooding jerk.  Elisabeth Shue (whose name appears first at film's start, by 
the way) is very capable here, too, though she has to repeat too many times 
that there were reasons she broke up with Caine  what they are is a 
mystery, however.
In the theater I was reminded that American viewers get what they want.  No 
lecture here, but for my tastes, HOLLOW MAN shows too much violence, and 
even exhibits partially nude women being abused by Caine.  Sure, the ending 
is pleasing if typical, but ultimately it's the kind of film that does not 
make you feel very good over spending the time to watch it.

Review for X Files, The (1998)
Steve Kong at the Hard Boiled movie page gave me your address.  I'm 
hoping to get reviews indexed through rec. arts. and IMDb.
Could you tell me the requirements (format, etc)?
Don't know if background is necessary, but I teach high school English 
and (as an adjunct) freshman English at Miami of Ohio.  I've been 
publishing stories, poems and essays in lit mags since 1981.  Went to 
Glassboro State College (in NJ) and Miami University.
I'm enclosing a review for your review.  Look forward to hearing from 
you.  Thanks very much for reading!  Hope it's OK I sent this to you at 
two addresses.
Although the first shots of THE X FILES are corny (c'mon, a location 
title that reads "North Texas, 35,000 B.C."?), director Rob Bowman shows 
solid work in most other aspects of the film.  
One likable side of the film is acting.  Perhaps because I have seen 
probably half a season's worth of shows throughout the run of the 
series, I was not used to David Duchovny's deadpan looks.  I enjoyed his 
character's own reference to this stoicism,  and soon got used to Fox 
Mulder's tendency to display emotion through actions rather than facial 
expressions.  Conversely, Gillian Anderson's Dana Scully -- though 
governed by cold logic -- often seems more emotionally reactive.  A 
certain glossiness about her looks in the film bothered me, the gloss 
extending to her eyes, as though she experienced discomfort with 
contacts or with tears of frustration about to spill at any second.  
Applause to the director and make-up people, who give Scully's cheeks 
broken blood vessels late in the film, after an ordeal that surely would 
have caused them.  On the whole, Mulder and Scully exploit well their 
level of comfort, after several years of interacting.
Layers of conspiracy lie at the center of the plot, and the aging white 
males cast as the conspirators turn in believable if humorless 
performances.  Armin Mueller-Stahl, apparently the highest-ranking 
conspirator (operating beyond the ken and control of the FBI), does not 
get a great deal of screen time.  But he is very good at using his scowl 
and his accent to portray a sinister secrecy.  Martin Landau plays Dr. 
Alvin Kurtzweil, who is himself the victim of conspiracies - attempts to 
frame him and, no doubt, discredit his way-out-there writings.  
Kurtzweil has to scramble to convince even Mulder of his credibility.  
To me, the most incredible side of Landau's character is his wandering 
the dark alleys, unarmed, wanted by at least the local police, behind 
the bar in which he meets Mulder.  The "cigarette-smoking man" plays the 
main heavy here -- besides the aliens themselves.  What confuses me 
about his motivation is that, despite countless reasons to rub out 
Mulder, he and his secret agency keep letting the tireless G-man get 
away.
The sets and special effects are grand in THE X FILES.  "Grand" in the 
old meaning of the word -- full of wonder and modesty, like the behavior 
of an honorable person.  I did find the bomb-sheared office building 
tacky -- too close to a re-enactment of Oklahoma City.  But other 
catastrophes, afflictions and icky creatures find their ways seamlessly 
into the narrative.  The implosion of the tundra -given away too much in 
trailers - is a superb computer creation that is edited with both 
patience and skill.  Remarkable illusions are created with the large 
sets and their gruesome inhabitants in subterranean Antarctica.
Mark Snow's music frequently lends suspense at the right places, though 
it seems a red-herring when the notes cut in as Mulder  glances behind a 
soda machine that has cheated him out of his change.   Some fast-paced 
pieces seem too densely New Age, layered as thickly as suspicions in 
viewers' minds.
The script, by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz, nicely sets alarms that 
go off later in the film at crucial times, including a joke from Scully 
just after she is resuscitated by Mulder.  In a way that I don't believe 
would insult  die-hard fans of the series, we are informed about the 
backgrounds, quirks and quests of the main characters.  Just from the 
hype surrounding the movie I learned enough -- Scully's return to faith, 
for instance - to help me chip away at plot twists.  
I would rate THE X FILES as a satisfying and intelligent story, though 
it should not be mistaken for an important film.  A question I have for 
SEQUEL?


Title
Review for Cast Away (2000)
Robert Zemeckis' CAST AWAY is a strong example of what can be done with a 
veteran actor and a pretty solid script.
Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, an executive for FedEx who is stranded on a 
remote island in the Pacific, is in top form, and the writing by William 
Broyles, Jr. tells the story without straining itself with worry over the 
premise.
Hanks is remarkable here.  Of course the story that will get the most 
attention is how he and his friend Bob Zemeckis suspended production halfway 
through the film, so that Hanks could shed 50 or so pounds and let his hair 
grow.  Sure enough, Chuck Noland reappears looking like John the Baptist, 
spearing fish expertly, even crouching like a native would  the survivor in 
the wild.  In every scene it seems like Hanks is not surrounded by a large 
crew;  he simply acts naturally, holding his expressive mouth and casting 
his expressive eyes in ways that engage us and always carry the plot 
further.  Perhaps he has not chosen widely different roles in his career, 
but Tom Hanks certainly assumes authority up there on the screen, and he 
just gets more watchable with the years.
The story is also one of the stars.  No, it will not interest viewers who 
demand intense action or explosions, though the plane crash sequence is very 
well executed and memorable.  I like that the script does not have Chuck 
Noland talking to himself unnecessarily.  When he talks or screams aloud, it 
is warranted;  when Noland needs to preserve his sanity, he creates a 
companion:  a package from the plane cargo, a volleyball he dubs `Wilson,' 
painting in a face with his own blood.  It's remarkable indeed that we 
actually begin to empathize with this volleyball, or at least with the 
traits with which Noland has personified it.  From the tragic opera of his 
marooning, Hanks is able to cause his character to sift comic moments  a 
nice touch and an optimistic stance from which to view the world.  Many 
stars attract an audience merely by attaching their names to a project;  
Hanks is the surest bet in modern Hollywood to deliver the goods.  Broyles' 
script, along with Zemeckis' subtle direction, gives this masterful actor 
the tools he needs.
Helen Hunt is, unfortunately, underused.  We saw her in the current Mel 
Gibson vehicle WHAT WOMEN WANT, and I remarked on the smallness of her part. 
  The script of CAST AWAY features Hunt even less.  What this fine actress 
needs is a narrative that will truly center on her, and not on the older men 
with whom she occupies a screen.  As Kelly Frears, Noland's love interest 
before his being lost, Hunt does her usual believable and efficient job, 
though we do not see much development of her character.
I wonder about viewers' reactions to the ending.  It struck me as not 
particularly satisfying, but I cannot say much about it without offering 
spoilers.  It reminds me of the endings of so many over-workshopped short 
stories that came out of college writing programmed students in the 1980's.  
The more I ponder the ending, however, the more I appreciate the importance 
of its metaphor.  Indeed, Zemeckis is unafraid of using metaphorical twists 
throughout the film, a decision that will alienate a good deal of viewers 
(who may not even be aware of the reason they are disgruntled!).
My judgment is that yes, films of high quality are scarce this season, if 
not this past year (2000).  My experience watching CAST AWAY (even the title 
smacks of metaphor, no?) provided me with an enjoyable mixture of 
entertainment and instruction, and are these two qualities not the ones that 
supposedly make good literature?
The film lasts 143 minutes, and is rated PG-13.  It has very few 
questionable uses of language, but a couple of intense sequences involving 
the plane crashing, and Noland finding the corpse of a crew member.

Review for U-571 (2000)
How much impact the Second World War has on contemporary culture is visible 
in Jonathan Mostow's story of submarine warfare, U-571.
I can remember watching films as a child, films like THE LONGEST DAY, THE 
BATTLE OF THE BULGE, PATTON and countless others;  always, as in episodes of 
THE TWILIGHT  ZONE, the Nazis were demonized, and the Allies were  
victorious.
Well, in U-571, this formula is touch-and-go:  we don't know immediately if 
the American crew will be successful in raiding a stranded German sub; 
further, we don't know if they will survive at all when their S-class 
American submarine is torpedoed by yet another U-boat, forcing the handful 
of sailors to retreat into the German vessel that they were about to 
scuttle.
Perhaps what causes the story to float is the blend of a solid  though 
fictionalized  story, with a script that goes out of its way to avoid 
clichés.  What's bound to happen in any story set aboard a sub does happen  
the claustrophobic sets, the spraying water and floods, and even the popping 
rivets (or seals) a la DAS BOOT.  Similar to Hitchcock's LIFEBOAT, it turns 
out they bring aboard a German saboteur.   Otherwise, this new treatment 
makes a very plausible effort to speed along the plot with originality and a 
few scenes of fine acting.
Largely a part of the background, the premise follows the crew's efforts at 
capturing an `Enigma' encoding machine, a device that was enabling the 
German Navy to run roughshod over the Allied forces in the early years of 
the war.  In fact, the American involvement in this particular treatment has 
drawn protest  as it was the British who mounted an astounding and 
ultimately successful effort at capturing the machines and breaking the 
code.  Of course the real aim of U-571 is to thrill the audience, not to 
explain the finer points of history.
The finest performance available here is the Chief  the military equivalent 
of a foreman on a construction job  who is played by Harvey Keitel.  With 
his blooming nose and stubbly mustache, Chief Klough helps to hold the story 
together.  He has been at this type of warfare since the Great War  when he 
apparently worked aboard this same, now crumbling class of American sub 
(that is, the S-boat destroyed less than half-way into the narrative, a 
gutsy twist).  Mixing unquestionable loyalty with uncanny intuition, the 
Chief excels at running the ship and at giving advice to the officer in 
command, Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey).  To put a spin on a 
line spoken by Keitel, this actor is welcome to play in any movie I pay to 
see.
Other outstanding performances are turned in by rock artist Jon Bon Jovi and 
Jake Walker  the two Americans fluent in German.  Walker, as Lt. Hirsch, is 
at first touted as the key to the mission; later he actually freezes when 
German sailors are shouting greetings to the American boarding party.  
Walker is clearly good at playing multi-dimensional characters.
Matthew McConaughey has a harder time convincing us and gaining our 
sympathy.  Tyler has a problem with not having received his own captaincy  
blown out of the water, as it were, by his own skipper, Captain Dahlgren 
(Bill Paxton, another actor often challenged by the prospect of acting with 
believable naturalness).  McConaughey often plays well off the characters 
around him, though he seems to try too hard during particularly stressful 
scenes.
A subtle and engaging effect occurs when U-571 is being attacked by depth 
charges.  The hull of the submarine bows under the great pressure, but does 
not implode.  Other effects include several exploding vessels;  most of 
these detonations are convincing, but occasionally we see the blur of fake-y 
motion, just at the edges of the action.  Computer generation has come a 
heck of a long way, but has not reached it final destination.
Fifty-five years after the war ended, Hollywood producers are still backing 
projects that highlight its battles, famous or not.  A couple of years ago 
we watched SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and THE THIN RED LINE.  No doubt we will see 
more, but why?  Yes, there are repetitions of the rhetoric we have heard 
before: it was the last great and honest war, the American army was the most 
awesome war machine ever assembled, never was there a more noble effort to 
preserve democracy.  But these narratives make just good stories, too.  
Granted, they are stories of the hunt, stories involving aggression and 
weaponry;  but they are also the embodiment of values so many viewers hold 
important.  War stories have always sold, and World War Two stories will 
continue to hold our interest.
As I write this review, I am watching Roger Ebert and this week's co-host 
(fellow `Tribune' employee Richard Roeper), both of whom are panning U-571.  
Although I do see some of what they are speaking, I still have to recommend 
the film for its engaging pace spurts of originality.  Not as well-made as 
DAS BOOT, U-571 nevertheless undertakes a tough task  sustaining a story in 
a microcosm of society at war.  And it is a good watch for the time it 
takes.

Review for Mission to Mars (2000)
Witnessing a journey through space is an epic experience, and no film makes 
the journey more visually stunning than MISSION TO MARS.  Unfortunately, 
other aspects are stunningly bad.
Starting at a send-off for NASA astronauts embarking on a Mars voyage in 
2020, MISSION TO MARS follows the lives of several astronauts.  Quickly we 
meet Luc Goddard (Don Cheadle) and his mates in the flight;  friends of his 
who have been excluded from the flight are Woody Blake (Tim Robbins), his 
wife Toni Blake (Connie Nielsen), and Jim McConnell (Gary
Sinise).  Jumping ahead several months, the narrative joins up with the 
mission that has already begun to explore the surface of Earth's neighbor.
Suddenly a catastrophe devastates the mission and the explorers themselves.  
Later, NASA officials on an orbiting space station receive the mayday call, 
and a rescue is organized.  Following yet another series of mishaps, the 
rescue party is also faced with the prospect of being lost in space.  Acting 
as an anchor for the tale is an enormous edifice in the shape of a graceful 
face - no doubt a sign of intelligent life.  What is supposed to keep our 
interest is the prospect of contact between the humans and whatever may be 
hiding out in the great sloping visage.
Acting in the film is pinioned by the wooden dialogue.  As early as the 
party before the first launch, characters deliver background information via 
lines they would never speak in real life.  Jim McConnell especially is a 
victim of the stiff script: he must buck up under the premise of his beloved 
fellow-astronaut and wife having wasted away and died before his eyes.  As 
he plays this soul-searching space traveler, Sinise wears too much eyeliner 
and delivers his lines with a quietness fraught with repression.
Tim Robbins also seems out of kilter here.  At times he attempts the 
emotional poeticism he achieved well in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, but floats 
out of the range of transparent acting;  again, the script weighs his 
character down.  One gets the feeling while watching these excellent actors 
that they accepted their roles not to further the depth of their careers, 
but to make money for financing their own production companies.
Of course it must have been attractive to work with a director as respected 
as Brian DePalma. DePalma has his cinematographer employ lovely, spiralling 
shots that defy gravity and stop just short of making viewers dizzy.  In 
space it doesn't matter if one is upside down, and we experience vicarious 
disorientation when the camera closes in from space and narrows down to 
Woody and Toni Blake working on a test and on their marriage.  Ultimately, 
though, DePalma gets little direction from screenwriter Jim Thomas, and the 
narrative ends up getting lost.
Most effects in this film are strong.  From dust storms on the surface of 
Mars to slow motion, horrifying ballets in the vacuum of space millions of 
miles from Earth, we see magnificent vistas.  What assaults the eye, 
however, is some of the computer generation bedecking the final few minutes. 
  Oddly conceived and outlandishly plastic, these images seem prematurely 
born and developmentally incomplete.  The close leaves us with cinema 
vitiated by bad science and New Age malarkey.
MISSION TO MARS is diverting entertainment, but time will not add it to the 
canon of must-see sci-fi films about space travel.


Title
Review for Muppets From Space (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
So few movies are being released - and so few of those are for kids - that 
Muppets From Space will have an audience, and may even turn a profit for its 
makers.  It's a perfectly enjoyable little movie, though at best it has the 
quality of a television special.
The opening is fine:  we see Gonzo (voice of  Dave Goelz) being refused a 
place on the ark by Noah himself (a cameo by F. Murray Abraham).  You see, 
there's only one of Gonzo, a joke with which all Muppet fans are familiar.  
But is he alone?
The film clicks early with a gathering of all the Muppets, who inexplicably 
seem to live together in an enormous house.  Reminiscent of the best 
ensemble shots from 'The Muppet Show,' this segment is directed well, 
assisted by catchy music.  We glance all of the mainstays - Miss Piggy and 
Animal and Fozzie Bear (Frank Oz), Kermit the Frog and Rizzo the Rat (Steve 
Whitmire)  -- along with the charming little bug-eyed Pepe the Prawn (Bill 
Barretta).  Many other recognizable Muppets do their stuff as well.  (It's 
hard not to belly-laugh at the sheep and penguins!)
Gonzo - apparently very old but a friend to these contemporary Muppets - is 
pouring his breakfast cereal when some of the spilled letters arrange 
themselves to read "Watch the Sky," followed by "R U There."  Soon Gonzo is 
struck by something like lightning, and experiences a vision in which he is 
flying, unassisted, through space;  two Cosmic Fish tell him that he is an 
alien, and he should await the return his fellow hook-nosed aliens, who left 
him behind ages ago.
All this is complicated by a plot involving a government conspiracy.  (Do 
the threads of the narrative sound familiar?)  Jeffrey Tambor plays K. Edgar 
Singer (c'mon - the name's not even cute!), an executive in an FBI-like 
operation.  He has been charged by his boss, a general played by the 
venerable character actor Pat Hingle, to produce an alien.  By roundabout 
ways, Singer (known as 'Ed') discovers Gonzo's alleged identity, and 
attempts to chase him down.
Really the film tries to do too much:  its science fiction elements do not 
blend well with the spy flavor.  Although there are spaceships and other 
fantastic items, there is also the Bondian device of weapons and fancy toys 
explained to the main Muppets - toys invariably used later on.  Too, the 
film is mis-named:  most of the action takes place on Earth.
Himself a distinguished character actor, Jeffrey Tambor here plays it too 
straight.  A little over-the-top never hurt any performance in a Muppet 
movie.  Roll or cross your eyes once in awhile, will you?  Several other 
live actors do cameos, and most are worthy of a chuckle.  Kathy Griffin is 
perhaps the funniest, in her role as an over-zealous guard.  Of course the 
highlight of the acting is the voices.  With Miss Piggy, Frank Oz delivers 
the same sardonic humor we are used to.  I wished she was given a more major 
role in the plot.  As Pepe the Prawn, Bill Barretta was also delightful, 
imbuing his character with subtle and often hilarious traits.
A Muppets movie has always meant solid entertainment, and this one delivers 
most of the time.  It's certainly good to see the franchise still going - 
Elmo from "Sesame Street" stars in his own movie soon.  A bigger vision and 
more rewriting, one hopes, will bring future Muppet endeavors up to the 
greatness of the first few movies.


Title
Review for Faculty, The (1998)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
What do you get when you combine literary elements with a "B" storyline?  
A film that's hard to brag about but difficult to dislike.  'The 
Faculty.'
Kevin Williamson, the writer of 'Scream,' has churned out another 
post-modern horror flick, a yarn targeted toward teenagers, in which 
teenagers are targets.  Into the formulaic plot he has mixed a pinch of 
motifs, a smidgen of imagery, a dash of foreshadowing.  The result is a 
movie full of flavors, another self-reflexive romp that does not stay 
with you for long.
At Herrington High School in Ohio, most of the kids are punks and most 
of the teachers are burnt out.  There's Mrs. Drake the principal (Bebe 
Neuwirth), who plays the part of a frank realist.  She tells Mrs. Olsen 
the drama teacher (Piper Laurie) that no, plays will not receive the 
proper funding - but football will.  "Have you seen the stands on Friday 
nights?  The whole town is there," she quips.  There's also an alcoholic 
teacher who does not even know what chapter the class is supposed to be 
covering.  Finally we meet the foul-mouthed football coach, played 
wonderfully by Robert Patrick with his smooth face and squinty eyes.  
It's Coach Williams who is first infected, or rather invaded, by the 
alien species that eventually takes over the faculty, most of the 
student body, and ostensibly, at one of those Friday games under the 
lights, the entire town.
It takes awhile for all this to happen, and along the way we watch as 
Williamson and director Robert Rodriguez sketch in the traits that help 
us to tell the six teen heroes apart.  Casey (Elijah Wood) is the 
photographer for the school paper, a computer geek who has not yet 
raised a whisker and who is continually harassed by various badasses of 
the school.  Zeke is played by Josh Hartnett (a dead ringer for a young 
Tommy Lee Jones);  his character is a dealer of anything illicit.  From 
the trunk of his muscle car Zeke peddles pills, cherry-flavored condoms, 
and a drug of his own concoction, a white powder that can be sniffed 
from the barrel of a ball point.  The final male is Stan (Shawn Wayne 
Hatosy), the star quarterback who decides to quit the team so he might 
focus on his studies.  
Stan's decision poses problems for his girlfriend, the shallow Delilah 
(Jordana Brewster), a stunning cheerleader and editor of the school 
paper.  She implies she'll drop him but quick.  Delilah also has 
problems with a girl named Stokely (Clea DuVall), calling her a violent 
lesbian.  The third female is Marybeth, a slim blonde from Atlanta, an 
unassuming new kid in school who tries to befriend everyone.  Thus the 
stereotypes are set.
Although the mild-mannered Casey and his editor witness, through the 
slats in a closet door, a couple of the alien-possessed teachers 
graphically recruit the school nurse, they cannot get their friends to 
believe them.  It takes a scene of full confrontation with the erstwhile 
science teacher.  He corners the six and says, "This won't take long" - 
as if he expects the teens to line up compliantly for the grotesque 
inoculation.  What follows - a turning point - is one of the strongest 
scenes in the film.
Soon afterwards, we see one of the weakest.  Yes, the film is 
derivative, and for the most part the script tries to be witty about its 
borrowing;  but the scene in which suspicion raises its Gorgon head 
smacks too much of Kurt Russell and the crew from John Carpenter's 'The 
Thing.'  Here even the acting lapses into a congeries of wooden, 
menacing expressions.
Many of the other allusions work well.  Stokely, who wears black eye 
shadow, doesn't bother to dispel the rumors of homosexuality;  they 
allow her to be a loner.  She makes use of her extensive reading of 
science fiction - especially Robert Heinlein - to guide her harried 
school mates in their quest to escape and, hopefully, to conquer the 
aliens.  We also glean elements of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' 
'The Puppet Masters,' and, when one of the youngsters is compared to 
'Ripley,' the 'Alien' movies.  There's a neat scene near the end when 
Casey is running from the thing, and we see shadowed cross-hatching on 
the floor of the locker room - reminiscent of the lighting in 'Aliens.'
Water imagery is remarkable as well.  Rodriguez comes close to being 
heavy-handed here, placing water in several key scenes:  there's the 
sprinkler system on the football field (a sure sign that academics are 
being neglected!); the tank in the science room, where an embryonic 
alien is revived; a rainstorm into which the thing inhabiting the coach 
extends its thin tentacles;  bottled water and the faculty room cooler; 
and the indoor pool in which one of the creatures does an instantaneous 
shape-shift into the fanged lobster-snake hybrid chasing Casey.  All 
these images work, though, lending unity and even a certain comedy to 
the plot.  Cool special effects, too.
What's gratuitous in this late '90's teen treatment?  For one, the 
language goes too far, probably in the service of sending up real 
problems in many American high schools.  The drug use gives a tawdry 
tone, though figuring prominently in the resolution.  Most noticeably, 
the behavior of the teachers, after they are taken over, is inexplicably 
bold and sexual.  Bebe Neuwirth as Principal Drake dresses in skimpy 
outfits, flaunting her skinny curves.  Another teacher, Miss Burke 
(Famke Janssen), threatens and curses out Zeke, and later speaks 
provocatively before attempting to, well, impregnate him.  Again and 
again Rodriguez and Williamson cater to young viewers, working sex and 
screams into the same sentence.
'The Faculty' knows it is smart.  Though it is not packed as full of 
self-reflexivity as the 'Scream' movies, the clever and engaging tones 
are there.  Fans of science fiction and horror, teenagers 16 and over, 
teachers seeking easy laughs, go to see or rent this film.  Hokey, yes, 
but light entertainment blended with just a touch of literature.

Review for Mask of Zorro, The (1998)
Zorro and I have a history.  Whenever I could find Guy Williams in the 
Disney series, his big shoulders swinging the sword to make the fat 
sergeant's pants fall, I watched with fascination.  Here was a show that 
had fun following a formula, that advertised its lack of seriousness.  
The show hooked me on action and adventure, clearing the way for my 
Friday-night addiction to THE WILD, WILD WEST.  As long as I didn't sit 
too close to the set, my parents let me watch as much as I wanted.
THE MASK OF ZORRO wants the audience to enjoy itself, and succeeds in 
most of its purpose.  The film is longish for a story that smacks of 
movie serials;  but enough swordplay, pursuit and explosions pack the 
minutes that the viewing experience is certainly never boring - and only 
slightly repetitive.
As Don Diego de la Vega, Anthony Hopkins wins our regard effortlessly.  
He plays a Zorro who, only a few minutes into the film, communicates the 
essential traits of the character.  Saber blazing, he defeats countless 
Spanish soldiers, rescues peasants whose execution was the bait that 
drew him, and finally, confronts the despicable governor Rafael Montero 
(Stuart Wilson).  Although Zorro escapes to show his familial tenderness 
at home, telling stories to baby Elena and kissing wife Esperanza 
(Julietta Rosen), the gentleman soon loses all that matters to him.  He 
is thrown into a terrible California prison just as Montero returns to 
Spain, accompanied by Don Diego's stolen infant.
The other plot involving injustice and greed centers on a couple of 
Mexican outlaws, the Murieta brothers, and a red-bearded mercenary named 
Captain Harrison Love (Matt Letscher).  The action has jumped 20 years, 
and fate has thrown together Alejandro Murieta (Antonio Banderas) and 
Don Diego, who has escaped from his dungeon in a manner dreamed up even 
before Alexander Dumas.  It is the classic mentor-apprentice 
relationship:  one of the producers has even described it as Merlin 
teaching Arthur.  Credit goes to the director, Martin Campbell, for not 
spending too much time on the scenes in which the at-first inept 
Alejandro learns the craft from the elder Zorro and then assumes the 
mask himself.
Banderas is the most convincing Zorro yet.  His looks and accent only 
assist his comic timing and physical coordination.  (I confess it was 
hard to tell which was Banderas and which was the stuntman, especially 
in scenes showing Zorro masked.  But Banderas does a good deal of the 
fencing and fighting himself.)  Veteran combatant coach Bob Anderson did 
a masterful job with the male leads, as well as with Catherine 
Zeta-Jones (the adult Elena).  I can envision Banderas returning every 
few years for more slice-'em-up action - another old product remade into 
a franchise.
Technical aspects of THE MASK OF ZORRO are mostly smooth and 
transparent.  The sets are remarkable for their size and accuracy.  Many 
of the colors are probably too brilliant for nineteenth-century textiles 
and paint, but the buildings - and especially the scaffolding of a gold 
mine worked by enslaved peasants and political prisoners - contribute 
much to the storytelling.  The editing also pushes the story ahead 
rapidly.  In fact, very few scenes exist only to develop character.  I 
do not expect to see Elena brushing her hair or Zorro nursing his sore 
muscles;  but I would argue that the film is too tightly edited.  We see 
loads of action (and countless fights between our hero and the same 
baddies), with little connective tissue.  As I write this I remember, 
though, that Martin Campbell is known in part for his action films:  THE 
MASK OF ZORRO even copies the openings and closings of James Bond.  
Zorro swirls his cape and, turning to the audience, carves a burning 
"Z".  
In the end, the film's action has fashioned a tone that is almost 
tongue-in-cheek.  We know the formula;  we've known it since we were 
kids.  Some of the fights are so deliciously over-the-top that they set 
my son and me laughing out loud.  Unlike several recent disappointments, 
THE MASK OF ZORRO works hard but knows when to lighten up.


Title
Review for Trekkies (1997)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
'Trekkies' is Roger Nygard's documentary that covers the networks and 
peregrinations of 'Star Trek' fans.  As one speaker - a psychotherapist and 
devotee himself - reminds us, "fan" is short for "fanatic."  What we see, 
then, is various subcultures of very ardent fans, and lifestyles inspired by 
Gene Roddenberry's ideas.
As in many serious films, the title surfaces, here assisting in dividing 
fans into a couple of categories.  "Trekkie" appears to be a slightly 
belittling term, applied perhaps to a more casual watcher and occasional 
collector.  "Trekker," on the other hand, is a heavier nomenclature, 
pointing out people who "walk the walk," as it were, with the minds who 
created the philosophy and world-view behind the original television series 
and its sundry spinoffs.
Thus the woman dismissed from the jury in the Whitewater trial for wearing 
her Lt. Commander outfit is a "Trekker."  We meet her at the printing 
company where she works, and where her fellow employees and bosses call her 
"Commander."  Another Trekker is the 14 year-old who designs computer 
graphics and real costumes.  (In a smart narrative move, Nygard has this 
boy, who speaks clearly, like a young Danny Ackroyd, guide the camera around 
a Star Trek convention.)  There's the young woman, Anne Murphy, who has 
idolized the actor who plays "Data" in 'Star Trek:  The Next Generation' -- 
Brent Spiner.  She prefers "Spiner Femme" to the less precise fan names.  
One of the more extensively covered aficionados is an Orlando dentist who, 
along with his wife (one of his dental assistants), has converted the office 
into "Starbase Dental."  The place is packed with 'Star Trek' paraphernalia, 
starship models suspended from the ceiling, cardboard standups of Worf and 
Picard and Crusher, assorted rubber masks positioned atop cabinets.  
Although one of his hygienists took some convincing before she donned a 
signature jumpsuit, the dentist's patients seem to love the original 
approach to office décor.
The film's 86 minutes are filled well with shots of these and other fans, 
along with snippets of interviews with several cast members of 'Star Trek' - 
mostly from the original late 60's series but some from the updates.  An 
aspect employed to insure success is Denise Crosby, the actress who played 
the security chief "Tasha Yar" on 'The Next Generation."  Now in her early 
40's, Crosby acted as a producer, and no doubt supplied contacts with a lot 
of the other actors and facilities.  She does much of the interviewing and 
interacting with the Trekkers; she even shows off some of the mementos sent 
her by fans - such as skillfully drawn sketches of her and fellow crew 
members.  Crosby's screen presence is comfortable and assured.  It certainly 
adds diversity to the narrative elements edited together to tell the story.  
Cinematographer Harris Done helps considerably with his work in the dramatic 
interludes - the short montages used to capture mood.  In one sequence we 
see a quartet of Klingons enter a McDonald's.  The young cashiers look at 
them curiously, and then we watch a wonderful series of Dutch angles, the 
camera canted as the bony-headed impersonators chow down on their Big Macs.
At its best, the film captures the fond ambivalence of the actors toward 
their loyal fans.  Most of these emotions are indeed fond; only occasionally 
does the attitude "Get a Life!" slip out.
The film is to be admired for not condescending to ardent fans.  The notion 
we come away with is these fans are intelligent and compassionate people, 
themselves full of tolerance and the mindset that engendered the "Prime 
Directive" followed by the advanced civilization peopled by Spock and his 
cohorts.  At its worst, the film is a tad too long, and goes in a series of 
circles, the result of portraying a number of individual stories instead of 
a more linear, climactic plot.  But this is a downfall inherent to the 
documentary.
You do not have to be a 'Star Trek' fanatic to enjoy this film.  Its 
built-in satire and wide range of factual storytelling make it charming and 
very watchable.  You will be reminded how many common references and figures 
of speech have come from the show, and you will understand a little more the 
people who pursue all things 'Trek.'

Review for Leggenda del pianista sull'oceano, La (1998)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
"The Legend of 1900" begins in a music shop in mid-century, viols and and 
horns hanging down amid the glorious clutter.  Suddenly we are in the boiler 
room of a gargantuan steamship, men working their hardest to fill the maws 
of the furnaces with coal.
What helps Giuseppe Tornatore's "The Legend of 1900" work its magic are 
these striking locations, places we want to be.  It all works together to 
form a wonderful story, we are made to understand - a story no less immense 
than life itself.
What Tornatore did for the cinema in "Cinema Paradiso," he attempts in 
"1900" to do for music.  To make his job more awesome he casts it in the 
mold of a bold time, naming his very protagonist for the new century.  This 
boy, you see, is the son of immigrants who abandoned him in the ship that 
carried them to the New World.  Found by an African-American engineer 
(played by Bill Nunn), the orphan grows up with the crew as his family, 
hiding in the hold to avoid discovery by any social agencies.  Danny Boodman 
T. D. Lemon 1900, the first two monikers after his only father, soon begins 
to explore above-decks.  There's a quite amusing scene in which he's caught 
playing a grand piano in the ship's ballroom, in the dead of night.  
Although his talent is prodigious, he's told what he's doing is against 
regulations.  Here the kid tells what he thinks of regulations, the same 
obscene response he throws at anything or anyone he doesn't like.
It's right about now that we return to the music shop, as Max, played by 
Pruitt Taylor Vince, is the man relating 1900's story to the owner.  Max was 
a close friend of 1900's, a part of the ship's band, though he is now 
apparently giving up his trumpet - in fact selling it to the old Brit who 
runs the shop.  Having drawn out part of the story with an old record - a 
master matrix of 1900 playing one of his spur-of-the-moment masterpieces - 
the owner is enrapt, and the flashbacks continue.
When Max first joins the band, 1900 is 27 years old, and has never set foot 
off the ship.  He's like the symbol of the new baby each New Year's - except 
he resembles the new century - tough and sharp, yet somehow intimidated by 
his own potential.  1900 becomes a figure larger than life, a musician with 
an easy and formidable talent:  the others in the band occasionally ask him 
not to show them up.  The only problem is his naivete.  Since his 
abandonment, he has never touched dry land, and has no real idea of how to 
go about the business of living on it.  When he glimpses a girl who is 
watching him make the recording aboard the ship, 1900 is smitten.  Will 
there be a romance?  Will Max even talk his sheltered friend into taking the 
frightening descent down the gangplank?
The answer to these questions does not come without difficulty.  In fact the 
ending, as much as it functions as an answer, is too slow and overwrought 
with personal philosophy.  Tornatore should have cut a pregnant pause or 
two.  But oh, what comes before it - this is the stuff of a great movie.
We see inventive camera shots, some playful ones showing 1900's hands on the 
keyboard in multiples:  the man plays so fast that we hallucinate extra sets 
of hands.  Reflections of hands and eyes abound, and one shot shows the 
phantasmagoric world of the rich as they dance behind the windows that 
separate them from the souls in second class and steerage. Tornatore shows 
he is a visionary director who knows how to exploit fully the medium in 
which he works.
The language of early-century steamships is something we are familiar with, 
thanks to "Titanic."  In turns claustrophobic and expansive, the "Virginian" 
is a wonderful microcosm, a jumping off point for hundreds of thousands of 
immigrants.  The vessel serves as a character herself, a place where both 
death and life abound.
Of course music plays another important role.  Ennio Morricone  wrote the 
score, including some difficult hybrids of tunes that show off traits of 
ragtime, jazz and atonal modern - best summed up by one character's comment 
(though it's about Max's spirited trumpet), "When you can't tell what it is, 
it's JAZZ!"  What's most remarkable is how the script ties in music and 
narrative.  The motif of storytelling operates on so many levels in this 
film that it's impossible not to pick up the thread of one without following 
the trail of the other.  When Max asks his friend, "What the hell do you 
think about when you're playing?" we begin to understand that 1900 does 
out-of-ship composition:  he dreams of being in distant cities and wallowing 
in the beauty of natural land masses. Music, for him, is a way of telling 
the most personal tale possible, a free-associative fugue.  We feel pity for 
his plight, but 1900's self-pity never lasts long.  Soon he's the same 
superman of the piano.  In a gutsy tour-de-force, 1900 reluctantly engages 
in a duel with the so-called inventor of jazz, Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence 
Williams III). The way Morton is portrayed, even his mother would not like 
him.  A combination of a twentieth-century personality cult and symbol of 
the brutality of the world outside the metal womb of the ship, Morton puts a 
permanent fright into 1900.
As the title character, Tim Roth has perfect pitch.  Blending innocence and 
sureness, social awkwardness and friendly support, Roth is able to convince 
us for extended moments that this fable is real.  One bit of his behavior 
goes over-the-top when he falls hard for the girl - we need more hints of 
his intimate pathology to believe what happens.  Otherwise Roth pulls off a 
performance that makes us forget him in the roles of so many smirky tough 
guys.
I loved Pruitt Taylor Vince as Rub Squeers in the Paul Newman vehicle 
"Nobody's Fool."  Here he gets to show off a more realistic talent, a 1920's 
jazz trumpeter who wheedles his way into the band of the "Virginian."  Aside 
from breathing, Vince fakes his instrument playing well, down to the 
contortions and staggers of a hip horn blower.  Call him a long shot for a 
nomination for best actor in a supporting role.  The most touching bit he 
plays is the search for his long-lost best friend.  Some time in the 30's, 
Max left the ship and got back his land legs.  It appears that the 
"Virginian" was used as a hospital ship during the Second World War, during 
which 1900 stayed aboard and played on.  But now the ship is scheduled for 
demolition, and Max is convinced that 1900 has reverted to being a hermit 
within the hold.  Max's emotions during his search are telling and fully 
realized.
Giuseppe Tornatore engages in what might be termed slow-onset magical 
realism.  It takes a while for his artistic strokes to gather momentum, to 
coalesce into recognizable themes and symbols.  But when the jokes and 
motifs kick in, the viewer indeed experiences magic.  These moments make you 
want to whisper to fellow viewers to confirm the astounding power of 
subtlety.  But like the best phrases of music, it's best to keep these 
moments private, to store them among the few handfuls of cinematic essence 
that you carry with you everywhere, to take out once in a while and cherish 
like a toy from childhood.

Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
The verdict:  my wife and two children and I liked it more than we thought 
we would.
With all of the hype surrounding the first episode of the 'Star Wars' saga, 
who would expect any mere human effort to succeed completely?  Yes, we had 
heard lots of lukewarm reviews from critics - but hey, critics are not the 
main target audience of George Lucas.  As for us, we were enthralled more 
than we were skeptical.
The premise we knew before going to view:  LucasFilm's finely-tuned 
advertising had exposed us umpteen times to the main characters and their 
quest.  At the heart is political intrigue:  the huge Trade Federation has 
blockaded the small planet Naboo, whose queen is Amidala (Natalie Portman).  
Two shady heads of the Federation have already tried to assassinate the Jedi 
knights sent as ambassadors - Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his master, 
the hulking Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson).  After the Jedis liberate the queen 
and her retinue, her highness appears before the galactic senate, 
complaining about the persecution of her tiny planet.  What follows is a 
series of complications typical of the other installments.  The underdog, 
equipped with cleverness and unfailing determination, faces off with the 
darker forces, equipped with superior numbers and weaponry.  The hidden card 
is a supposed legend:  the Federation lackeys report to a mysterious Sith 
lord named Darth Sidious.  We discover that the Sith are in fact real, and 
that there are only two at any one time;  Sidious' apprentice is named Darth 
Maul.
Really the plot is thin.  Lucas is obliged to incorporate countless elements 
that had their genesis in episodes four, five and six - so many that there 
is little room for plot development, aside from the knights guarding the 
queen from being coerced into signing a treaty with the despicable trade 
ministers.  Another necessary plot detail is the introduction of Anakin 
Skywalker.  He's a slave boy on Tatooine, the planet where the Jedis have 
landed to repair their ship on the long voyage to Coruscant.  The boy, 
played by Jake Lloyd, soon joins up with the venerable warriors.  His 
advantage is that the Force seems incredibly strong within him.  Qui-Gon 
(pronounced 'KWAI-GONE') recognizes this latent gift, and insists the boy 
become another apprentice.  The plot detours into various complications, but 
it turns out that this boy has talents that belie his years.
On the whole, the movie has preserved a good deal of the light-heartedness 
and camp of the earliest treatment.  True, there is not a character of Han 
Solo's ilk, nor of Chewbacca's;  but the tone is light in the right places, 
and the pace does keep the interest it needs to keep.  I had the impression 
that the plot would find better and grander settings sooner than it did.  
Hence my judgment that the first minutes could have moved faster, a la 
flicks in the 'Star Trek' series.  The wandering plot builds, however, a 
series of wonderfully rich subtexts.  We see an astonishing underwater city 
inhabited by the Gungans, the home of the computer-generated Jar Jar Binks.  
The other architectures are equally eye-catching:  Amidala's Italian 
Renaissance palaces, for instance.  It's true in this episode that the 
backgrounds - and thus the special effects - play an even greater role than 
they did in the other episodes.  Perhaps this prominence is noticeable 
because some type of CGI appears in 95% of the shots;  but perhaps it is 
because of some lapses in acting.
Jake Lloyd is cute, but some of his lines include the Beaver-like "Yippee!"  
Plus, in many scenes he looks like he's trying to act:  the absence of 
contrivance is not yet perfected.  Even worse, when Queen Amidala dons a 
disguise, dressing as the handmaid Padme, Natalie Portman delivers the most 
wooden style in the picture.  She is much better as the subdued queen.
Then there is Liam Neeson as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn.  His bearing is 
always natural and stately, and he delivers his lines with the dignity and 
wisdom fitting his role.  Qui-Gon is especially effective when chiding 
Obi-Wan, his apprentice who is almost a full-fledged knight.  I'd argue that 
just as imposing a presence as Neeson is McGregor - this actor commands our 
attention in much the same ways as the originator of the role, Sir Alec 
Guiness;  McGregor seems to have the solid demeanor of a host of British 
actors - Trevor Howard, even Claude Rains.  In short, if you are reading 
this, Mr. Lucas, put more focus on the best actors that you probably already 
have in the bag for the next two films!  Ewan McGregor should be the 
cornerstone of Episode Two.  Finally, the baddest villain here is the 
physicality of Darth Maul, played by Ray Park.  His evil stare is unmatched 
by the threatening visages of any other baddie in 'Menace'.  The light saber 
fight - a three-way between Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan - is perhaps the best 
small-scale combat footage in all of 'Star Wars'!  (On the topic of combat, 
my son complained about the paucity of space dog-fights.  I personally 
missed Wedge, who appeared in Episodes 4, 5 and 6.)
As for Jar Jar Binks, he is a wonder of computer animation, but does speak 
in a quasi-Carribean accent that makes him annoyingly marble-mouthed.  He's 
an ineffectual side-kick, along as a guide as he owes a life-debt to 
Qui-Gon.  He provides occasional comic relief, especially in a large battle 
with the Federation's droids.  But, uh, Mr. Lucas, say it won't be Jar Jar 
who is the only Chewy wannabe in the next flick!
Some assorted tidbits of amusement:  we get to see the origin of CP30, the 
droid voiced by Anthony Daniels.  Typically, in his first acquaintance with 
R2D2, CP30 acts flustered over his nudity (his gold "coverings" are not yet 
installed).  "Artoo" collects his laurels of heroism by saving the queen's 
ship, and later by acting as the rear-riding sentry in a craft filched by 
the precocious Anakin.  A bigger bit of fun is the pod race, which has been 
compared to the chariot races in 'Ben Hur' (in keeping with the Biblical 
symbolism that pervades the narrative);  this race is exciting and fast.  
The vehicles themselves are plain cool, uncontrollably dangerous - two 
jet-like engines with a cockpit suspended somehow behind them, a stream of 
neon electricity coursing about.  Though it is gripping and displays 
Anakin's prowess as a pilot and thinker, the race does not play an important 
role in the plot - unlike the speeders in the forest of 'Return of the 
Jedi'.
Cartoonist Jim Borgman of the 'Cincinnati Enquirer' drew two teens emerging 
from a cinema showing 'The Phantom Menace':  "The movie was good, but I 
liked the hype better," is what one says, which leads me to believe 
overexposure can hamstring the best of entertainments.  But entertainment 
value is high with this episode, and I have to admire the PG rating.  As 
parents of a girl nearly eleven, we would have had to compromise our usual 
enforcement of the ratings.  Go to see 'The Phantom Menace' and do it in a 
theater first;  it's never the same on a home screen.

Review for Lawrence of Arabia (1962)
What strikes me most about watching Lawrence of Arabia again is its length 
-well over three hours.  Yes, I think director David Lean could have edited 
out a good deal of footage and still had an epic.  On the other hand, I 
admire the pace Lean uses to build momentum;  and certainly momentum - of 
narrative if not of action - is a large part of what gives the film its epic 
impact.
The Arabian desert fascinates the viewer with its natural shadows and hidden 
but sure danger.  Lean's five-month shoot is legendary, with cleverness and 
endurance pitted against hardships mustered by nature.  Outside of The 
English Patient, I have not seen such an interesting use of the desert in 
any film.  This awesome land formation should be credited up there with the 
main players.
The acting is marvelous, too, the casting a series of strokes of brilliance. 
  In his first film, Peter O'Toole proves that the choice of a young and 
quirky style was the best choice.  This man has the eyes of a silent film 
star, large and expressive, outlined to an almost feminine degree.  O'Toole 
inhabits the character thoroughly; I cannot imagine another actor so intense 
in his changes of mood and ironies of ego.
As well, Omar Sharif is outstanding as Sherif Ali ibn el Karish.  A young, 
dark and handsome threat at first, his character grows nearly as dynamic as 
Lawrence's in its alteration by story's end.  How to match Sharif's 
magnetism was addressed by casting Anthony Quinn, that multi-ethnic utility 
man, as a rival tribal chief, Auda abu Tayi.  Quinn truly matches each iota 
of Sharif's anger and passion.  Auda embodies a great Bedouin's jingoism.
How to ensure a solid backup cast?  Let's face it, political intrigue is 
usually a sure way to comment on the ironies of human nature, and Jack 
Hawkins as General Allenby, and Claude Rains as Mr. Dryden - the 
plainclothes, behind-the-scenes manipulator - were about the best thing 
going in the field of character acting.  Further, Alec Guiness, the lead 
actor in Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai, is subtly masterful as Prince 
Feisal.  The way the world is portrayed as both cruel and beautiful results 
mainly from the dimension of the script added by strong supporting roles.
Robert Bolt's screenplay is both spare and poetic.  It's like the best 
writing by Raymond Carver - laconic but not minimalistic, honest but not 
prideful.  Bolt surely relied on the strength lent by the desert, where 
one's actions are magnified as if by a brightly-lighted stage.  He also 
makes the political strife fairly understandable:  the desert tribes need 
unification if they are to be a threat to the Turks, who have included them 
for some time in an extensive empire.  As it is a World War, the British 
have it in their own interest to see the Turks defeated, as Turkey is allied 
with Germany.  What throws off British imperialism is the quasi-rebellion of 
one of their own - T. E. Lawrence, the officer who takes it upon himself to 
bring together a large faction of these desert peoples.  After he assists in 
the liberation of Damascus, he tries to ensure the area stays under Arab 
control:  not a popular path at a time Great Britain was still expanding its 
own empire.
Maurice Jarre's music is a masterpiece in its own right.  The main theme and 
its variations reach throughout the entire narrative, accompanying the major 
characters on their exploits and adding dramatic undercurrent to many 
confrontations.  It's truly music fit for an epic.
Watch for a cameo that has David Lean on a motorcycle asking the resonant 
question of identity, "Who are you?" as Lawrence and a young companion 
appear after crossing yet another desert.
It's been ten years since Robert A. Harris restored the old and rotting 70 
mm film he found in dented and rusting cans.  Had he left it there, perhaps 
we would not have such a bright and crisp version to enjoy today.  This film 
is a must-see for a number of reasons.  Yes, it's way up there on the 
American Film Institute's Top 100 List, but more importantly, it's a glimpse 
of vanished filmmaking, a real epic and a valuable piece of history in the 
areas of film and world politics.


Title
Review for Never Been Kissed (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
Raja Gosnell's 'Never Been Kissed' is a slick and likable film, a 
formulaic but ultimately satisfying romance targeted toward you, if 
you are part of the 18-34 demographic that causes Hollywood directors 
to look over their shoulders at every gag and angle.
Executive producer Drew Barrymore is so hard to dislike:  she has a 
talent for seeming genuine, ingenuous, sweet, amicable.  This vehicle 
has her portraying Josie Geller, a 25 year-old, brilliant young editor 
at the Sun-Times, a Northwestern graduate who has never gotten around 
to having a personal life.  A whim of her crusty boss gives her the 
chance at being a reporter - long an ambition of Josie's.  Better yet, 
she'll be an undercover reporter at a high school, enrolling as a 17 
year-old!  Her  brother, Rob Geller (David Arquette) isn't so sure 
this ruse will work, but Josie nevertheless drives up to the school in 
Rob's gauche Vega.  Will Josie be popular enough to penetrate the 
cliques-that-be?  The answer, which we discover as Josie in her white 
jeans sashays into Spanish class:  NO!
Josie, as it turns out, still suffers from terminal over-compensation. 
 She is so preoccupied with pleasing others, that she stumbles 
clumsily through the halls and life, even once walking into an opening 
door.  Rob, as it turns out, saves her act by re-enrolling also.  He 
has faked his ID, and wishes to reactivate his chances at a minor 
league baseball contract.  Smoothly Rob reverses the opinions of the 
superficial student population:  he lies continually until Josie has a 
sterling, awesome reputation.  Now she is liked not only by the 
"Denominators" - a nerdy math group led by a girl named Aldys (Leelee 
Sobieski) - but by the cool crowd as well.  
Alas, her major problem persists:  even as she masquerades as a part 
of the teen crowd that rejected her the first time through high 
school, Josie Geller is scooped by reporters from other papers.  She 
simply cannot uncover the right story, the juicy scandal that would 
invite the notoriety for which Mr. Rigfort (Garry Marshall) has sent 
her.
The film is expert at recreating "Josie Grossie's" zit-covered high 
school years.  Barrymore navigates her innocent way into gross 
injustice.  Even before the prom she is set up, Carrie-like, to take a 
humiliating dive.  In flashbacks disturbing in their reality, we watch 
the insensitivity of youngsters.  Later on, of course, there is too 
much moralizing about this selfishness;  but Barrymore pulls off the 
preachiness without being too pouty.
David Arquette acts well as Rob, his manner properly crazy and 
supportive.  In posing as a teen, he has a bit more trouble than 
Barrymore, though:  too mature and mannish.
Garry Marshall?  This guy is the original Brooklyn smoothie:  he does 
it all (with canny knowledge of how to make his own directing efforts 
succeed), and acts with abandon in a role replicated from his 
performance as network chief in 'Murphy Brown.'  Good at creating a 
living caricature, this guy is.
Michael Vartan as English teacher Sam Coulson is accomplished at 
playing through in the game of overcoming stereotypes:  he's the 
caring and supportive teacher, young and good-looking and himself 
artistic yet athletic.  A he-man with a momma's-boy 'do.  What amounts 
to the film's key plot element as well as its horrendous artifice is 
the relationship between Sam and Josie.  Apparently the audience is 
not supposed to be bothered when Sam longs for Josie, her precocious 
knowledge enthralling him.  What's worse, Rigfort and  another of 
Josie's bosses, (funny guy John C. Reilly, miscast here) try forcing 
Josie's hand into an ethically messy situation involving Sam.  And we 
are not supposed to dislike them for this scheme?
Molly Shannon supplies great support as Josie's newsroom friend Anita. 
 Her role also demands several nods to stereotypes, namely promiscuous 
ones.  But Shannon shows that her comic muscles are in shape in scene 
after scene.
As an aside, what causes screenwriters to fall for silly or obscurely 
allegorical names?  Who out there knows the meaning of the name of 
Josie's vacuous office assistant???
'Never Been Kissed' ranks above average in the surplus of teen films 
hitting the market.  Its strength is sincere acting, its weakness a 
cloying predictability.  It's obvious the film is  aware of its own 
need to meet the formula that will satisfy an audience.  The paradox 
here is that the ending makes us wait, and then indeed IS satisfying.


Title
Review for Road to El Dorado, The (2000)
The latest fully animated offering from DreamWorks SKG is out just in time 
for spring breaks and spring fever.  THE ROAD TO EL DORADO is beautifully 
drawn, skillfully voiced, and nicely scored.  It is also threadbare of plot, 
save for the final minutes.
The heroes of the film, Tulio (Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) are 
con men who mistakenly stow away on the ship of the very men they have 
swindled.  Their punishment upon being caught?  Well, it is supposed to be 
flogging and lifetime enslavement in the sugar plantations of Cuba (where 
they are headed aboard the ship belonging to none other than the infamous 
Cortez.  But we never see the pair suffer, just as we never witness scenes 
anywhere close to graphic).  So the heroes escape with a sidekick in the 
form of a portly horse named Altivo, and use a map in an attempt to discover 
the legendary city that gives the story its name.
Enter a supporting character, Chel.  She's a temple robber, a lovely though 
sneaky woman who begins to drive a wedge between Miguel and Tulio.  When the 
trio are captured and dragged  into the wondrous city, they commence to 
scheme their way into an escape with all the gold they can carry - a very 
familiar premise.  What complicates their machinations is another case of 
mistaken identity:  the ignorant natives take the white men to be gods, 
resembling an ancient image of a magical pair riding a serpent.  As the 
connivers battle their own greed as well as factions led by rival power 
figures within the tribe, the specter of Cortez stands in the background.
What helps to make the film move along is the characterization provided by 
the voice actors.  By this time Kevin Kline is a veteran animated movie 
star, the male lead of Disney's THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME under his belt.  
Kline lends a quirky panache to Tulio, causing us to like the money-grubbing 
would-be god.  Kenneth Branagh also turns in a solid performance as Miguel, 
even though his voice occasionally takes on the stock heroic tone we heard 
from him in HENRY V.  Both actors supply their own singing voices in the 
only song not sung by Elton John.
Rosie Perez's character is sketched to resemble her, and unfortunately we 
also see a lot of Rosie's head wiggling attitude transplanted to this 
paradise in Central America.  Enough said.  The other voice actors are more 
transparent.  Edward James Olmos plays the obese chief, his voice often 
understated and subtly wise.  As the wily Tzekel-Kan, Armand Assante does 
perhaps the strongest job of the supporting players.  His intonation is 
striking and clear, the hallmarks of all good "baddies."
How is Elton John's singing?  Not as good as Tim Rice's lyrics.  The songs 
do an adequate job of both furthering and decorating the storyline, though I 
would not go out of my way to purchase the soundtrack.  Often catchy and 
multi-layered, the music nevertheless falls short of being memorable.  After 
leaving the theater I could not remember one of the airs to whistle myself.
Its colors lush and vibrant, the animation takes up much of the slack of 
mid-movie.  We observe the greens of the wildly growing jungle, as well as 
the reds and browns of the wondrous city.  Every now and then we come across 
scenery that appears virtually realistic, as in the objects of gold given to 
the fake gods.  On the whole, images of Central American Indian art serve as 
an engaging motif.  Especially striking is a giant, fancifully animated 
green lizard manipulated by the insidious Tzekel-Kan.  Beyond its 
achievements in vivid aquas and reds and teals, the angles of the animated 
"cameras" are average; there are very few visual joyrides like we 
experienced in last summer's Disney offering TARZAN.
THE ROAD TO EL DORADO does not stand up to DreamWorks' previous success, THE 
PRINCE OF EGYPT.  My daughter, a few months short of twelve, commented on 
how much she likes the city - a compliment to the team of animators.  This 
is only one indication in my mind that the story might have been stronger.  
Writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio could have picked up the pace in several 
scenes of building action, but their ending is both picturesque and 
action-filled.  All ages would qualify to enjoy THE ROAD TO EL DORADO - it 
is a diverting buddy movie and a magnificent series of paintings, done by 
both humans and computers.  I don't know that it will end up in our home 
collection of videos, but I am not sorry we took the children to see it.


Title
Review for Contender, The (2000)
Rod Lurie's THE CONTENDER is a solid enough political drama, but in this 
fall's offerings of high-powered action and big-name-directed comedy, it's 
likely to be forgotten fast.
If Joan Allen doesn't get a nomination for her Senator Laine Hanson, and if 
Gary Oldman doesn't actually carry home the Best Supporting Actor statuette 
for his cagey Congressman Sheldon Runyon  well, something's rotten in 
Hollywood.
Much of THE CONTENDER is run-of-the-mill.  Vice-president dies.  Leading 
candidate for replacement is jilted in favor of female senator from Ohio.  
Ms. Hanson is a former Republican, and Democratic President Jackson Evans 
(Jeff Bridges) realizes this as a plus: voters would reject someone too far 
to the left.  The main complications come when decades-old photographs 
surface.  They allegedly show Hanson as a college student, engaged in an 
orgy, as part of sorority initiation.  Heck, the movie is not that original 
in the way in which Hanson reacts to these accusations.  She refuses to deny 
them, in fact refuses even to dignify their existence by entering into any 
type of dialogue concerning them.
Ruthless Representative Shelly Runyon is clearly out to get Hanson.  He has 
made clear that the President's first choice, Governor Jack Hathaway 
(William L. Peterson), would glide through the congressional hearings that 
are giving Hanson so much grief.
What makes the film strong is not so much Allen's excellent performance as 
the performances of those around her.  Bridges is an old smoothie by now, 
his eyebrows taking on the bushiness of his father's, and his manner taking 
on believable authority as he ages.  Christian Slater stands out in the 
supporting role of a Democratic rookie who seeks the truth at whatever cost. 
  Rough-looking Sam Elliot has dropped his dragoon's mustache to play 
presidential advisor Kermit Newman.  Certainly the cast goes a long way 
toward making the picture much better than average.
A few twists and turns take the rest of the responsibility.  Although I was 
never `on the edge of my seat,' I watched raptly as several plot details 
made it hard to predict what would happen.
Most of all, Gary Oldman  also the executive producer of this outing  
transforms himself into a political Svengali of ambition.  I was unaware of 
Oldman's involvement in the movie; it was not until I spotted his name  
preceding Allen's in the closing credits  that I realized it was he.  This 
balding and unattractive Washington insider looks very different from the 
Russian terrorist in AIR FORCE ONE or from Beethoven in IMMORTAL BELOVED.  
Oldman's acting here makes me believe it's his character who causes the 
story to hang together, in spite of the blatant agendas the film preaches  
namely surrounding women's rights to serve in high political office, and 
women's right to choose abortions.  (It's a small but unfortunate thing, 
too, that Runyon is given character traits that stereotype him as Jewish.)
Though Lurie causes the movie to go on a bit too long, at two hours and 20 
minutes, he does keep our attention to the end.  The target audience may be 
limited for this subject matter, but intelligence and fine acting make this 
a must-see for serious movie-goers unafraid to sit there in the dark and 
think.

Title
Review for Blast from the Past (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
I suppose people who wear rose-tinted glasses see the world in shades of 
pink, as pink as the fabrics that covered the walls and chairs of 
American houses in Life magazine ads, circa 1960.  Yes, pink is the 
color of nostalgia.
And we are reminded of the importance of nostalgia by Hugh Wilson's 
'Blast from the Past'.  Its story begins outside of Los Angeles in a 
neighborhood of picture-perfect tract houses.  Professor Calvin Weber 
(Christopher Walken) is an eccentric and rich scientist who has secretly 
built a fallout shelter large enough to contain a replica of his house.  
As the Cuban missile crisis reaches its worst moments and nuclear war 
seems imminent, Dr. Weber drags his pregnant wife (Sissy Spacek) down 
into the shelter, which is equipped to sustain a family of three for 35 
years.  The plot gimmick that causes the family to stay underground for 
the entire time is a plane crash:  just as the Webers are safe in the 
shelter, a military plane plows into the back yard, and the bespectacled 
schlump sets the irreversible locks.  Convinced a holocaust has 
destroyed the city and perhaps the greater part of the world, the Webers 
recreate a polite and perfect microcosm with their new son Adam (Brendan 
Fraser, when the boy reaches adulthood).
Of course we have seen all this before.  Think of Marty McFly in 
reverse, transported into the future.  Even Brendan Fraser has been 
there, in 'Encino Man' and, in the same fish-out-of-water sense, 'George 
of the Jungle' (itself a text from the 1960's).  But the filmmakers know 
how we love to gaze longingly at our history.  In its own way, the film 
manages to serve as a history lesson, imparting a good deal of cultural 
as well as political knowledge.  What is puzzling about fondness for the 
past is the blind faith that those years were better than these, that 
people were happier, in every important way, than we are.(It's ironic 
that we would look through those lenses of distorting pinkness at a time 
that engendered a near-nuclear confrontation.)  Yet the formula works, 
and 'Blast from the Past' supplies us with laughs and a romantic 
relationship that is at times witty and original.  When Adam must 
venture into what he thinks is a post-nuclear, mutated world, he takes 
up with a rather rootless woman (Alicia Silverstone), who is conscious 
of her lack of depth, but who is also oddly principled.
Brendan Fraser turns in a solid performance as the walking anachronism.  
Indeed the movie milks his out-of-place experiences for all it can;  
Fraser for the most part plays along with a dry and naďve humor, though 
at times he does look blank or even stunned.  We know that his character 
is in love with Alicia Silverstone's Eve, but he is simply too polite 
and mild to pursue her affections meaningfully.  Fraser is at his best 
when Adam shows sudden inspired bits of accomplishment - when he speaks 
French and later swing-dances skillfully at a dance club.  He's likable 
all the time, but especially when he displays his tenderness toward his 
parents and his would-be girlfriend.  
Alicia Silverstone is very watchable as well, although our early 
impressions of Eve approach a stereotype:  she's the cynical and spoiled 
girl-woman, street-smart and smart-mouthed, a darker version of the 
shallow Cher from 'Clueless.'  Why is her performance good?  Because 
Silverstone knows her way around the camera, seeming very comfortable 
and assured as she commands Adam's attention during the ups and downs of 
their relationship.  This young actress has denounced phoniness in her 
everyday life, and seems to be applying the same credo to her acting.
Christopher Walken can appear in any movie I pay for, especially in his 
quirky characterizations.  We care about Calvin Weber the loving father 
and husband, and we're willing to laugh at his paranoid, commie-hating 
craziness.  Sissy Spacek is underused, but in her short scenes dominates 
in the dry humor department.  Mrs. Weber walks outside the "house" to 
scream, and imbibes the cooking sherry in her advertisement-perfect 
kitchen.
Set design is tricky in this film.  Most memorable is the interior 
decoration of the Webers' houses, both above and below the ground, 
meccas of post-war pastel luxuries, kitchens full of wondrous modern 
appliances, living rooms packed with fringed furniture.  A hilarious 
sight gag involves the land above the fallout shelter, a block that 
undergoes massive change in the decades following the plane crash.  
Directly above the Webers' elevator are a sleazy bar and its owner, who 
thinks the beings crashing through his floor are three incarnations of 
supreme beings.  The mantra the grungy bar owner adopts is "Leave my 
elevator alone," and his cult of the homeless in one of the funnier 
running gags.
The score brims with period songs, the rhythm of the vintage music 
helping to move the narrative along.  Over the closing credits we hear a 
song by written and sung by Randy Newman, a piece of cutesy doggerel 
relating to the film's premise.  Aren't we getting a bit over-exposed, 
Randy?
'Blast from the Past' is certainly a good date movie, and it has enough 
laughs to recommend it for theater viewing.  Unfortunately it has one 
'f-word' and a slew of 's-word' jokes, as well as a few seconds of the 
characters' visiting adult video stores: hence the PG-13 rating.  Why, 
Mr. Wilson, couldn't a few seconds be excised in pursuit of a plain PG?  
It's not a must-see, but it is a pleasant way to pass two hours, the 
haze of nostalgia simmering like dry ice along the theater floor.

Review for Rocky V (1990)
ROCKY V -- a favorite film at Badin High School, Hamilton, Ohio
Just like the three sequels before it, ROCKY V opens with a rehash of the 
last chapter.  We see the robotic Russian Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) 
beating up on Rocky (Sylvester Stallone), before Rocky finally gathers the 
mental fortitude to snap back and floor the perfectly-conditioned giant.  
The sequence is extremely contrived, of course, the chronology of the fight 
tinkered with so that all of Rocky's comeback punches seem to come in an 
awesome few seconds.
This is one of the pluses that the underrated ROCKY V brings to fans of the 
series.  Director John G. Avildsen - who collected an Oscar for directing 
the very first installment - along with script writer Stallone, borrow 
liberally from the foundation built by the four other outings.  We get to 
see everyone and everything again - manager Mickey Goldmill, 
opponent-turned-friend Apollo Creed, even the black hat and duds worn by 
Rocky during his days working for a loan shark on the Philadelphia docks.  
We see Rocky's staunch supporters peopling the streets of the Italian 
market, as well as the statue (from ROCKY III) atop the steps of the 
temple-like Philadelphia Museum of Art.  It's not necessary to have watched 
numbers one through four in order to understand this closing chapter, but it 
makes for more enjoyment.
Here's the story:  Rocky is injured in the battle with the rock-faced 
Russian Drago, invoking late manager Mick's memory that something is "broken 
inside."  Mysteriously, Rocky never seeks a doctor's help.  (In fact, there 
is always a scarcity of promoters and press and especially medical personnel 
around Rocky's fights, considering they are supposed to be huge spectacles.) 
  Not until wife Adrian (Talia Shire) coaxes Rocky into a CAT scan does he 
discover the brain injury that could end his life.  Meanwhile, Don King-like 
promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) attracts loads of attention 
with his mouth and his challenge for Rocky: give a title shot to my 
contender, Union Cane.  Rocky is sorely tempted, but Adrian keeps him from 
committing to any further matches.  What's especially hard, though, is 
Rocky's financial condition, a key component in the plot.  It seems Paulie 
inadvertently had Rocky sign a paper giving power of attorney to Rocky's 
accountant.  You guessed it - the guy invests the champ's millions and 
quickly loses them.
Predictability aside, Rocky's monetary ruin opens the story to compelling 
originality.  His estate auctioned off, Rocky moves his family into the 
South Philly rowhouse that he and Adrian bought as newlyweds.  We see some 
charming scenes with son Robert and Rocky kidding around, the boy showing 
great intelligence to Rocky's punchy and slangy style.  But Rocky is a good 
father, warning Robert about ways to act in the public school he must attend 
in the new neighborhood of "urban blight."
At least Rocky is a good father until a new young fighter comes all the way 
from Oklahoma to ask Rocky's guidance.  At first reluctant, Rocky grows to 
like the chance at still being in the ring, at least vicariously, through 
Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison).  The retired champ is flattered that he might 
establish a father-son relationship like the one Rocky had with Mick.  And 
they are successful together, much of Rocky's gut-punching greatness rubbing 
off on the young blonde pugilist.  The main question we want answered is how 
long can Tommy stand being called Rocky's boy?  How long will it be before 
the honey-tongued Duke lures Tommy over into his own slick side of the 
boxing game?
Humor contributes a lot to ROCKY V.  We still have Burt Young as Rocky's 
brother-in-law, a rummy hanger-on, a clichéd bumbling but lovable uncle to 
Rocky and Adrian's son Robert (Stallone's real-life son Sage Stallone).  And 
there's the wonderful exaggerated tone created by characters like George 
Washington Duke, the biggest ham since Apollo, and some over-the-top fight 
scenes that create as much laughter as fascination.
One of the most engaging parts of any ROCKY film is the montage.  "V" uses 
the technique well to tell a number of stories within the subplots.  We 
watch Rocky with protégé Tommy Gunn, training and coaching and mentoring, 
while Rocky's son Robert seeks attention but is shunned.  Because we've seen 
how close father and son really are, this drifting apart forms a serious 
threat to Rocky's success story:  it's clear that his family, such as it is, 
has always been more important to Rock than anything concerning the square 
circle.  Yes, it is overkill when Adrian says, "You're losing your family," 
but sometimes the big palooka needs a message to hit him square in the face. 
  My favorite sequence happens during a street fight.  Rocky is down and 
apparently out, flashes of memory adding to his trauma:  Ivan Drago's glare, 
his mouthpiece looking like steel teeth; Mick's gravelly voice belting out 
words of inspiration; a grainy shot of Rocky, eyes swollen shut, bright red 
blood poured suddenly over his face.  Avildsen has added some artful and 
gritty images here to explore Rocky's plight.  Even though Rocky's most 
dangerous weapon has always been his heart, how will he overcome the twinges 
of fear - and more directly, the brain damage - inflicted during combat with 
the Russian in the climax of ROCKY IV?
A brilliant stroke brings back Rocky's deceased manager Mickey; Burgess 
Meredith does a memorable cameo that ends up being one of the strongest 
scenes in the piece.  Bankrupt and disheartened, Rocky returns to the old 
gym where Mick first tutored him.  Mick willed it to Robert years before, 
and now Rock stands in the great dusty room and goes back into his memory to 
conjure Mick during a private moment just before Rocky fought Creed in the 
fluke title bout.  One can tell Meredith is 14 years older than he was in 
the 1976 ROCKY, but his veteran skills save the scene from being too 
sentimental, and help to provide Rocky with the incentive he needs to enter 
the other end of boxing.
Even though this final installment of ROCKY is ten years old, its themes 
strike home as very relevant.  Many of my students are inspired not only by 
Rocky's attitude and gutsy styles of training, but also by Bill Conti's 
music, an essential part of each film.  There's something mythical about the 
whole thing, the main plot lines involving glamorous rises and 
heart-breaking falls, underdogs overcoming high odds, father-son relations 
that are fatal or benevolent.  For fans of the ROCKY franchise, ROCKY V 
should be viewed carefully and not discounted as one of the best.


Title
Review for Felicia's Journey (1999)
Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org
In FELICIA'S JOURNEY, Canadian director Atom Egoyan has created a quiet and 
horrifying masterpiece.  Lead actor Bob Hoskins has said about his 
experience shooting the picture, "There are some terrible moments in the 
film, but I had to play them."  Hoskins also described his character, 
Hilditch the catering manager, as "a mixture of Jack the Ripper and Winnie 
the Pooh."
Felicia is a young Irish woman who has left her condemning father and set 
off to England to find the boyfriend who has abandoned her.  In her quest to 
find Johnny, Felicia begins to scour factories where she believes he might 
be working.  Though she is unsuccessful, she finds encouragement in the kind 
Mr. Hilditch, a quiet and proper man who keeps happening across her in 
various places.
Viewers catch a hint of a dark side in Hilditch when in a conversation to 
Felicia, he mentions his wife.  Because we have already seen the single man 
in his empty house, we sense his agenda is twisted.  When Egoyan introduces 
pieces of videotape that Hilditch has made of various girls riding in his 
car, we begin to trace an unspeakably evil pattern.  This man creates 
scenarios that lure "lost girls" into his life; when they gain some relief 
from his kindness and begin to depart, Hilditch drugs and murders them.
So we know relatively early that things are amiss within Hilditch's motives. 
  What's fascinating is the way the film studies this repulsive character, 
bringing out extreme frailty and loneliness within such a maniac.  And just 
as the filmmaker has attended to numerous details in the script and set 
decoration and character history, Hoskins carries off a masterful depiction 
of humanity forsaken.
Bob Hoskins is the only actor I can picture playing Hilditch.  For this 
character Hoskins has created a monster who manages to compose himself 
enough to get through one lonely day after another.  Hilditch seems 
compulsive in everything:  hair neatly combed, tie and vest always in their 
proper place, the man seems the quintessential British gentleman; he even 
uses the stereotype of endurance as part of his terrible ruse.  Talking 
about his fictional late wife, he tells Felicia he must go on, chin up in 
the face of hardship.  In all the mannerisms he lends to the character, 
Hoskins is brilliant.  Particularly interesting are the moments in which we 
can see triggers being set off within Hilditch's psyche.  In one scene in 
the hospital where he has told Felicia his wife is dying, Hilditch glimpses 
an old movie on a television in a waiting room.  Suddenly we see Hilditch as 
a boy, sitting beside his mother in a movie palace.  The film shows John the 
Baptist's head on a platter, the horrible queen examining it.  In the 
balcony Hilditch's mother hands him her opera glasses so that he might see 
the horrid spectacle more closely.  Though he is appalled, the boy watches, 
fascinated.  What a telling scene!  An attractive seductress who is cold at 
heart but who can be immensely charming - this was the woman who inflicted 
quite a bit of damage on her son.  Watch the snatch of old movie, Hilditch 
freezes in revolting reverie.  Although Hilditch's history is a document of 
premeditated evil, some of his emotions are easier to understand because of 
the care taken by William Trevor and Atom Egoyan in sketching in Hilditch's 
backstory.
Elaine Cassidy, a relative newcomer to film, plays Felicia with great 
understatement.  It's almost a tone of passivity caused by innocence and 
politeness that she creates - a tone that causes her plight in the story to 
be more frightening.  Cassidy works well with Hoskins, both actors knowing 
when to pause to underscore ideas with just the right intensity.  Watching 
these two work, one never feels an insult to the intelligence.
In the grainy flashbacks - scenes from the cooking show as well as more 
private shots of little Joey Hilditch discovering a wallet and stealing 
money - we see a few of the causes of Hilditch's psychosis.  The mother, 
Gala, is played by Egoyan's wife, actress Arsinee Khanjian.  Lovely but 
exploitative, Gala appears to use her boy as an adorable on-camera sidekick. 
  In a memorable scene, she places a chunk of liver in Joey's mouth, and the 
boy gags; watching a tape of this embarrassment, the adult Hilditch again 
gags; his sense of history nags that strongly at him.  In all of her scenes, 
Khanjian is the perfect, subtle siren.
In a memorable supporting role, Claire Benedict plays Miss Calligary, a 
fervent door-to-door evangelist.  Her presence adds just a bit of humor to 
the narrative, as she spouts her flowery Biblical rhetoric.  Near the 
closing of the film her aggression of the spirit causes a sort of epiphany 
in Hilditch.  It's a dark comic moment that could have been written by 
Flannery O'Connor, the most perverted recesses of the human heart tugged 
suddenly into the open.
Irish novelist William Trevor penned the book that was adapted by Egoyan.  
What's original about his adaptation is that Egoyan manages to avoid clichés 
about serial killers.  The camera sweeps leisurely about the grand house 
that Hilditch grew up in;  we glance mementos from the lives of Hilditch and 
his mother.  One room is dedicated to her image; it's a repository of 
souvenirs from her television cooking show, photographs of herself, even 
relics like an old blender that Hilditch resurrects when his blender 
malfunctions.  Attention to detail sets the story going in a very 
well-developed direction.
FELICIA'S JOURNEY is rated PG-13 for dark subject matter, though there are 
no real scenes of violence, and no profanity.  Because of its unsettling 
nature, I would not recommend it for children under 12.  Its pace is 
necessarily slow at times, filling out various dimensions of Hilditch's 
character or Felicia's background.  Unfortunately, its status as an art film 
will not gain it wide release; but it is worth a trip to a nearby city art 
house.  The bottom line: it is a superior character study that will engage 
you for every minute of its run, but it is a disturbing film you may not go 
out of your way to watch a second time.
