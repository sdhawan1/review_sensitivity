Title
Review for Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)
I've seen and received some mixed reviews of the latest movie
creation by Mike Myers, which also stars the gorgeous brit-beauty
Elizabeth Hurley. Myers plays two characters, Austin Powers,
International Man Of Mystery, and his arch-enemy Dr.Evil, both
hilarious... "beee-have!""
How anybody cannot think that this movie is not funny really confuses
me, and  should seek therapy for their jadedness.
Myers backdrops the retro stylings of  typical late 60's spy flicks,
computers with meaningless light flickerings, and all. 
The movie does, on occasion seem to rely on stupid bathroom humor, which
is not overdone, but it is the tempo of this movie that is truly
original. In  one scene,  the de-thawing of Austin Powers, after
spending some 20 years frozen in a cryogenic tank, comes a long-awaited
tinkle that never seems to stop,
as such, the laughs this movie produces.
The dance sequences, and Mike Myers' facial expressions will have you
laughing.
***1/2  (out of four).
