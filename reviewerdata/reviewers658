Title
Review for Titanic (1997)
There's a moment in Titanic that illustrates what James Cameron is trying
to create with his giant epic.  It's not a special effect or a computer
animation or an explosion of any sort.  It's a simple scene:  Jack Dawson
(amazingly played by Leonardo DiCaprio) sits and draws Rose DeWinter (Kate
Winslett).  It's amazing because you actually believe that Dicapprio is
trying in earnest to create a portrait of Winslett.  His love for her is so
grand, that he only wants to create a picture that illustrates his love. 
It has to be perfect, you can see it his eyes.  It's a great moment
between the actors in a movie that could have so easily ignored them and gone
out to be a big budget disaster movie.  Cameron isn't after a disaster film
or gimmicky effects, he's after an emotion that he wants from his
audience: sympathy, maybe even tears.  He wants you to cry at the tragedy of the
sinking Titanic.  And in this movie, we do.  
Does Titanic live up to the hype?  I think it's better than the hype; It
is one of the best movies of the year.  A gigantic sprawling masterpiece
from James Cameron, who emerges as one the two or three best director of
epic movies of our time.  Here he has created a movie that is not only
amazing to look at, but amazing to feel and to be a part of.  As a friend of
mine said after the show, "I need a box of Kleenex."  
A lot of people have criticized the love story between Winslet and
DiCaprio, but I think that's what makes the film so good.  Unlike other films
that rely on special effects, Titanic is centered around a beautifully told
story.  The doomed ship is merely the backdrop that makes the story so
powerful.  Kind of a supporting character (a $200 million supporting
character) rather than at the fore front.
With big budget movies these days, there is no story.  It's all just an
excuse for special effects (Starship Troopers, Con Air, The Lost World,
Spawn, Batman and Robin, etc...) Titanic, however, is so much more. 
Cameron's use of story telling, letting us know how the boat will sink so that we
can watch for it at the end was brilliant.  From that point on, we forget
about the sinking and concentrate on the story.  After all, you know the
boat will sink.  In the meantime, we get to see some of the most beautiful
cinematography that I have seen in 10 years.  Yes, it is three hours, but
you don't notice it.  Instead, I was absorbed with the show that Cameron
puts in front of you.  It's grand entertainment; a documentary, a love
story and an adventure rolled into a movie that's bigger than life.
I don't know if Titanic will earn back the money it spent, but it
deserves to.  I think we need to praise Hollywood and Cameron for going out on
the line and making a big budget movie with a heart and characters that we
care about.  When people are dying at the end, we feel bad because they
somehow seem real.  We relate to them; we wonder if we would act like them as
they struggle to live.  
I think what makes it so good is that you feel like you're part of an
event.  Thirty or fourty years from now Titanic might be on TV (or whatever
we have as an equivalent by then) and we can tell our kids, "I was there
when that movie opened. I got to watch that in the theaters."  It's the kind
of epic that transcends generations and will probably be remembered for a
long time.  
"Titanic" (**** out of four) Directed by James Cameron.  Starring
Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslett, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton and Kathy Bates

Title
Review for Hilary and Jackie (1998)
The rivalry between the two was subtle, well paced, and went through
years of the characters lives without leaving the audience feeling
cheated on who they characters were becoming. I left feeling like I
knew a great deal about the people involved - perhaps the ultimate
success of a film biography. As a side note, it's unfortunate that
Griffiths received somewhat of a second billing in the movie. She was
the stronger performer - playing the role that didn't demand the
attention or the eccentricities of Watson's character. Her performance
was vital to the film's success, grounded Hilary and Jackie in
sensibility and as a way for the audience to connect to the
characters.

Title
Review for Replacement Killers, The (1998)

The Replacement Killers could have been a good, solid action movie.
It could have been a sleeper hit; a movie that decided to break a few
rules and be original and inventive.  Instead it's a boring,
forgettable movie that'll be out of theaters in a few weeks.
It's the American debut of Chow Yen Fat, who's Hong Kong films The
Killer and Hard Boiled made him the best action star in the movies
today.  He has a grace about his characters: he can be somber and
confident at the same time.  When you compare him to American action
stars he seems more real, more identifiable.  After his international
success, he came to Hollywood and was wasted.  While he does manage to
walk out of The Replacement Killers with his reputation intact, but
everything else around him was a waste.  It also stars Mira Sorvino,
who plays your standard breaking the law loner who does everything her
way and fakes passports to make ends meet.  She's totally unbelievable
here and spends most of her time trying to convince us that she's
tough and knows how to shoot a gun.  To describe the plot is to waste
your time and lower your I.Q.  You don't pay attention to the details
in a movie like this, you don't follow the plot holes.  Things like
that will only frustrate you.  Instead, you wait for the action scenes
to come up (there's about five or six), you wait to see the skin shot
of Mira Sorvino (there's only one).  The action scenes were passable,
though they tended to get old after awhile.  Director Anotoine Fuqua
puts a little bit of style in the movie, he tries to give the movie an
Asian feel.  But his problem is that you don't really know if he's
spoofing Fat's movies, or if he's taking them seriously.  There's a
moment towards the end of the movie where Fat makes a stand-off with
the main mean bad guy.  The bad guy is driving down an alley in his
limo (because bad guys always ride in limos in movies like this), the
gates to his fortress open, and there stands Fat, holding seven or
eight handguns. Whether or not it was supposed to be funny, half the
theater laughed.  Fat didn't look confident, he looked ridiculous.
Rather than watch The Replacement Killers, rent Fat's best action
films, The Killer or Hard Boiled.  Those movies also brought director
John Woo to Hollywood.  Woo's first film was a bomb in Hard Target .
Hollywood let him stick around and he eventually made the successful
and acclaimed Face/Off.  Let's hope Fat gets the same chance.
The Replacement Killers (* and half out four).  Directed by Antoine
Fuqua.  Starring: Chow Yen Fat, Mira Sorvino.

Title
Review for Analyze This (1999)
Analyze This is living proof that stereotypes can be amusing in film. Every
character in the movie  each mobster, a psychiatrist and his fiance, the
psychiatrists son and parents, the fiancešs parents, all of them  are pure
stereotypes. Yet the movie can be at times funny and is overall a good film
worth renting. Audiences know the mob by the movies we watch, not by the
truth of who they are. Analyze This is fun because it takes pleasure in the
stereotypes that past mob films have created.
For the five of you who havenšt seen it, Robert De Niro is a mob boss who
realizes he has a few psychological problems and is having anxiety attacks.
He seeks out a therapist, Crystal, to help him deal with his problems.
Crystal is hesitant at first, but De Niro is persuasive (in a manner of
speaking - persuasive as only a mafia movie character can be, for example,
he throws Crystal in a shark tank) and Crystal ends up becoming more
involved with De Niro and his organization than he wants to be. Of course,
Crystal has issues of his own to work out and learns to deal with them when
De Nirošs mafia-matter-a-factness begins rubbing off on Crystal. A side plot
features Crystal getting married while treating De Niro.
Everything in this movie is predictable, yet for some reason I was never
bored or felt cheated. I guess itšs hard to find a comedy that finds ways to
make people laugh without being mean. Are the stereotypes mean? No, because
making fun of an organization that professionally kills people is, for some
reason, okay.
I imagine that the idea must have come to the writers, while they were
sitting on their therapistšs couch, that it would a funny if a mob member
went to therapy to work out personal issues. Amazing that a single idea can
create two hours worth of movie. To write the script and come up with the
dialogue, the writers must have sat down and watched every mob movie they
could get their hands on and read Mario Puzošs łThe Last Don˛ six or seven
times. De Nirošs mafia boss is the epitome of all of the Godfathers and
Goodfellas scrunched into a character. He speaks in cliche (When he
interrupts a party thrown by Crystal łHey, whyšs you gotta be mean, Išm
being nice here,˛ when  ) and always aware that hešs supposed to be a mob
boss. He plays it like he knows hešs acting.
I doubt they researched by actually talking to mob members. That would have
taken too much time, and besides, this isnšt the kind of movie that requires
that type of research. They use the stereotypes of movies past to their
advantage. Mobsters seem to say łFuhgetaboutit˛ a lot (see Johnny Brasco),
so they have De Niro say it ten times. Mobsters seem to make a point of
eating in dimly lit, crunched up Italian restaurants, so they put a crucial
scene in there (even paying tribute to the Godfather during a bathroom
scene, or maybe it was a tribute to Austin Powers). Mobsters also beat up
and threaten whomever they please, whenever they please. When Mobsters have
a meetings, they like to do it at a warehouse out in the middle of nowhere,
that seems specifically constructed to have Mobster meetings. And of course,
the police are a bunch of idiots, always coming in two minutes too late to
catch the mobsters. All of this does get a little tiresome, but the actors
bring such energy and timing to the material, that it can be forgiven.
Joe Viterelli did such a stand out job playing De Nirošs faithful bodyguard
Jelly that it would be a shame if he didnšt receive mention for an
supporting Oscar nomination. Lisa Kudrow, as Crystalšs fiance, is wasted
here, but at least shešs pretty to look at. Also, Crystalšs son seems like a
wasted opportunity.
It seems like Išm picking out whatšs wrong with Analyze This, but in truth
there are genuinely clever moments, such as Crystal trying to convince De
Niro  to stop crying and fight back during a shoot out. However, Analyze
This isnšt laugh-out-loud funny. Itšs a blend of violence and humor, that
skates along black comedy at times or farce the next. Itšs a movie made by
veteran actors and producers that have their timing down and have stretched
out a small idea into a two hour popcorn movie.

Title
Review for Lola rennt (1998)
Run Lola Run could have been the new Pulp Fiction. It breathed life
and electricity into a genre that seemed dead, or to most people,
didn't even know existed. To write about it is to remember it's pulse,
it's quick, lightning like photography and sound that rarely stopped,
only to catch it's breath, then moved and ran, ran, ran - until at
the end of the movie you were exhausted. As odd or cliche as this may
sound, I left the theater catching my breath - feeling awkward that I
was walking home rather than running.
Set to techno music, a rhythmic force of dance and action, the movie
was paced like a cheetah running after it's prey. To sit still to it
seemed unnatural. It blends animation, violence, love, revelation and
hysterical action in an 85 minute movie. Five minutes of Lola is more
entertaining than two hours of any recent Hollywood action film. The
story is that Lola's boyfriend Manni, a drug dealer who has
idiotically lost $100,000 on a subway, has 20 minutes to get it back
or face death from the dealers. Lola runs to help him, thinking up
different ways to get the money and avoiding pitfalls.  Lola is a
wonderful character, a new heroine that stands up to old female
cliches, screams and shatters them. It's impossible to forget the
vision of her running - red-hair like a fire on her head, running
through the streets of Germany to save her boyfriends life.
Along the way, we see how split-second decisions and actions affect
the rest of our lives. A boy offers to sell Lola his bike while she
runs. She refuses, then immediately see several snapshots of him being
mugged, beaten up, pity taken on him by a woman, and getting married
to her. Tykwer makes a convincing life in the span of ten
pictures. Snap, snap, snap, snap is your life. Depressing.
This is style merging effortlessly with substance. You couldn't have
one without the other; the plot would die without Tykwer's
speed-induced direction. But the direction is fun and plausible,
instead of being a headache, because the setup presents a good
life-or-death situation. It wastes no time to grab in an
audience. Anything that seems out of place 0r silly is ignored because
the movie goes too quickly to realize what is happening. Snap, snap,
snap and the story jumps from a person who tells Lola to "Fuck Off"
and then shows that woman's life.
That the movie wasn't more of a success in America surprises me. It is
young and paced towards the 15-30 crowd, marketing's money darlings,
the same crowd that producers created half of the past ten years of
movies for. It offered many of the same qualities that made Pulp
Fiction such a breakout.  It was new, or seemed new anyway, with a
direction and flash that inspired countless filmmakers to make direct
photocopies. Audiences didn't seem to mind either, making Pulp Fiction
and it's subsequent ripoffs lots of money.  Lola also seemed to be
fresh, in a different sort of way, but still fresh.
While it was a foreign film, complete with American-hated subtitles,
this could have been overcome with a wide release and any sort of
marketing campaign. Just a few trailers could have sparked
interested. The success of this film was due solely to work of
mouth. It played in independent theaters (the one I saw it in offered
pillows to replace the dilapidated seat cushions). However, Lola
wasn't given a wide release and suffered. What could have been a Blair
Witch Project, was instead made into an Afterlife.

Title
Review for Full Monty, The (1997)

"The Full Monty" (*** out of four)
        I bet no one on this campus would want to see me strip.  It's not that I'm ugly, my mother insists that I'm not, but I'm just not buff enough to show everything for paying fans.  A British comedy about unemployed steel workers down on their luck, `The Full Monty,' takes that idea a bit further,  and has average looking men stripping for money.
The critics have given extremely high praise to this movie and it has been the art house hit of the year, so going in I expected to see one of the best shows of the year.  That being said, I was entertained by the movie and it was well worth watching, but somehow I was a little disapointed. It was reviewed as a non-stop laugh machine, but I found it more sad than humorous.  So many places and situations that The Full Monty looked for it's humor are depressing.
That's not to say that the movie isn't funny.  There are some of the hilarious moments on screen I have seen in the past few years.  A scene involving elves is nearly worth the price of admission, and the finale of the film was perfect.  But the movie is laced with so much sadness in the characters; each man seems pathetically beaten down, unwilling to look within himself to find salvation.  Rather, they seem content to be ignorant without a job and lie to themselves and others about their situation.  One man is suicidal and a momma's-boy, another hasn't told his wife that he's been laid off (and it's been six months).  
Robert Carlisle, the leader of the men, is stripping to pay child support.  That's a noble thought, but he brings his son to all of the practices and to the actual strip show itself.  I guess if I were a father trying to convince people that it was okay to see my son, I wouldn't bring him to strip shows.  
There is a scene where Carlisle interviews a man who is auditioning to be a stripper.  The man fails miserably, but Carlisle asks him to stay awhile and bring his children in to watch. "Sorry," he says.  "This is no place for me, and this is no place for kids."  Carlisle was affected by the words at the time, but he didn't learn anything - he kept bringing his son to the practices.  I have a tough time laughing at that.
Another plot line involves a man who believes that he is too fat to strip in front of an audience.  To lose weight, he hides in a shed in his backyard and wraps himself in saran wrap while he eats a snickers bar.  There's a strange mentality in that - ask yourself, how desperate would you be to lose weight if you wrapped yourself in saran wrap? 
The Full Monty is an entertaining movie, but I think it's more of a character study than a comedy.  Would it be a better movie without the sad elements? No, but I wish it weren't advertised the way it is. 
The Full Monty Directed by Peter Cattaneo.  Starring Robert Carlyle, Tom Wilkinson, Hugo Speer and Steve Huison

Title
Review for Dark City (1998)
Written and Directed by Alex Proyas
Starring Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly
Dark City is such a rare treat: itšs a stunning, hyperkinetic vision of a
place where our reality is fused with noir, science fiction and the darkest
nights in Manhattan and London. To boot, it is accompanied by an intense,
well written and thoughtful story. Movies of this caliber and idea arenšt
made too often, and itšs unfortunate that I waited this long to see it. Alex
Proyas, whošs previous film The Crow looked good but couldnšt cover up the
terrible acting or story, here shows a near masterpiece; a combination of
Metropolis, Edward Hopper and Phillip Marlowe, fused seemlessly.  At times
it moves beyond film into artwork.
It is the story of łstrangers˛, aliens from another planet (and we know
theyšre aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats  one of
the detractions of the film) who experiment on humans to discover what makes
them live, what makes up our łsoul˛. These aliens are superior to humans 
because they have mastered the łultimate technology˛ of shaping matter with
their mind, called łtuning. They are aided by a human scientist, played by
Kiefer Sutherland, who has łbetrayed his kind˛ and at the start of the film
watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight. During this time, John
Murdoch, played swiftly by Rufus Sewell, wakes in a bathtub in a room with a
swinging overhead light (a terrific visual effect - not only is Murdoch
confused, but so is the audience). Without a memory and a strange guilt that
he may be a killer, he receives a phone call to flee, as the strangers are
after him.
I donšt want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story;
One of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop, in a way regaining
Murdochšs łidentity˛ along with him. Itšs a pleasure to watch the characters
develop through the cinematography. Murdochšs wife, Anna, is introduced
through a stunning beam of light: she is a lounge singer who sings into a
bright spotlight. Shadows, outlines of men in hats watch, as she gently
curves through the shine. We see the outline of her body from behind, an
hourglass, as she sings a slow, rhythmic song. A great entrance.
However, a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes
behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied. The city is nice
to look at, but if itšs a poor story then itšs not worth watching. Blade
Runner was popular not only because itšs visuals, but itšs story and themes
were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience. It is
discussed it and argued, therefore a success. Other science fiction films of
recent times, such as the Fifth Element, are nice to look at, but are
dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so
flimsy. Wešre left with łlove conquers all˛ after finishing the Fifth
Element. Dark City is not so easily explained away. As the strangers
discovered, locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is
not such an easy task. Where is reality?
Dark City is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90šs, and ranks
along with the best made in the 80s, such as Blade Runner and the two Aliens
films. Perhaps itšs the best of the both decades; it had the darkness of the
Aliens films, as well as the visuals and compelling story of Blade Runner,
but moved beyond, I think, because the themes behind it were much stronger.
Anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please
feel free to write, Išd love to hear it. 

Title
Review for Thin Red Line, The (1998)
Written and Directed by Terrence Malick
Based upon the book by James Jones
Poetry, translated into a film, is The Thin Red Line. The movie is a
collection of images and thoughts, assembled in a broken order, in hopes to
solicit emotion and feeling from the audience. It is not so much about plot
or story, but about sights and sounds, symbolism and rich lyrics, and the
way a it should feel to be in a war. Malick created poetry. 
The question is: Is it good or bad poetry? Unfortunately, I'm not a good
enough critic to say. I didn't enjoy the movie, but that's partly because I
didn't understand Malick's poetry. I have to be honest. That's not say that
someone will understand Malick's visions and enjoy the experience. I didn't
enjoy the film, because I didn't understand Malicks message, but I also
thought that it was incredibly overlong and pretentious. What insights did I
gain through his film that other war movies had already shown? None, and it
took three hours to do it. 
Malick uses the war as a background to introduce several American
infantrymen, most of them indistinguishable from the other. It wasn't so
much about keeping track of each character and their individual plight in
the movie. Each character had moments where, as they were fighting or dying,
would have a voice over narration of poetry. Lines that didn't deal with
war, but with other topics surrounding - individuality, human cruelty,
weakness, pity. All of those are topics related to war, but the lines zigged
around the war. A battle would be waged, meanwhile a character reflects upon
his usefulness to others. Is this what war feels like? I don't know, I've
never been. Who am I to say? But by placing these voice overs all over the
film, the poetry was forced. Rather than letting the dialogue and action
shape the characters, the voiceovers were relentless and tiresome. A few
would have made a point, kept it emotional. After awhile it seemed
satirical. I just never felt that soldiers could act that enlightened during
battle. 
The movie looked good. Malick created a heaven in the hills where the
soldiers attacked, then destroyed it through battle. The battle scenes
seemed fine, though only one section really stood out - a sequence where the
American soldiers were chasing the Japanese through a village. The camera
was frenzied, never resting on anything to grab ahold of. One of the moments
that didn't seemed forced. 
I'm sure this is the worst, most incomplete review I have ever written. I've
been searching for the way to critique this movie, and without fully
comprehending it I'm unsure how a complete critique could be done. Perhaps
as I write more reviews and get better at this process, I'll revisit the
film and write another review. Or perhaps I'm right: if it is poetry that
Malick created with The Thin Red Line who am I to judge his poetry?

Review for Big Lebowski, The (1998)

You're inside bowling ball, rolling down the lane.  Up and down, up
and down, not sure why you're there.  The only thing you are sure
about is you're on a drug trip.  What happens when you hit the pins?
"The Big Lebowski" for all intents and purposes, is an insane movie.
It's filled with a laundry list of weird and discpicable characters,
has an even longer line of plot twists, and just for fun, a couple of
dream sequences (or drug trips, however you'd like to call them) are
thrown in. At the end of the film you realize that you're left with
memorable scenes, but not a memorable movie.
At the center of "The Big Lebowski" is " the Dude" or Jeff Lawbowski,
the "laziest man in the world" played by Jeff Daniels.  The movie
opens with this description of him: "Sometimes there is man, and he's
a man for his time and place.  And that's the dude."  And that man has
no job, but has an unlimited supply of drinks and drugs and enough
left over to pay rent on a nice aparment.  He writes checks for
$0.79 and he bowls. His only identifiction is a Ralph's grocery
card.
I've always enjoyed the Coen's films because they are, if nothing
else, original and inventive.  Here, they've tried so hard to be
original that they've created a lot of ideas, but not much of a movie
to hold them together.  The plot moves along like an episode of
Seinfeld on crack.  It goes something like this: The Dude is mistaken
as another Lewbowski (played by Charles Durning) by two thugs who want
money.
To show that they mean business, the thugs urinate on the Dude's rug
(which, as he says, "just held the room together).  The Dude wants a
new rug from the other Lebowski, who is paralyzed, happens to be a
wealthy tycoon.  Said Tycoon tells him no, but later summons him back
to his mansion so the Dude can help him recover his kidnapped daughter
(because he thinks that the same men who kidnapped his daugther also
urinated on the Dude's rug), the Dude agrees, but lets his insane
bowling partner help him out.  The bowling partner (played by John
Goodman) screws up the plan and instead of trading money for the
daugther, the partner just gives the kidnappers his dirty underwear.
That's just the first 30 minutes.  On second thought, it's more like a
soap opera on crack. You never guess where you're going next, but
then, you don't really care.  Did I like "The Big Lebowski"? No. But
that doesn't mean others won't.  It has the right kind of humor and
story to develop a cult following (like most Coen movies) but this one
didn't entertain me.  Maybe I was looking for more of a story rather
that two hours of characters that are in serious need of a
psychiatrist.
"The Big Lebowski" (** and a half out of four stars) A movie written,
produced and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.  Starring Jeff Daniels,
John Goodman, Julianne Moore, and Peter Huddleston

Title
Review for Vampire Hunter D (1985)
Therešs nothing quite like a gory anime. Really, and this is the truth, no
other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said
in the media about it. With anime, a common shot is watching a body getting
quickly cut in two, and the rest of the insides falling out seconds
afterword. This is a standard practice in anime, or at least the half dozen
or so titles that Išve seen.
Vampire Hunter D is a gory, gory film. If they ever made a live version of
the film, it would be banned in several countries and given a rating
somewhere below XXX. Itšs not that itšs gore is unique - itšs just like
other gory animes - but this one was supposed to stand out because of the
complexity itšs story, characters, animation, etc... It really didnšt. It
was disgusting and gruesome, which overshadowed the story, what little of it
there was.
It seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the
world, because God knows that our local police force just canšt seem to get
a handle on vampires in the movies. One evening, a blond peasant girl, drawn
to look 17 and innocent (a foreshadow that we will see her naked, I guessed
early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene) is out fighting evil
in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of
a ten thousand year old vampire (insert Strom Thurmand joke here.)  Of
course, he never put a łno trespassing˛ sign on his yard, so one canšt
really blame her, but hešs upset anyway and demands retribution. She gets
the obligatory bite on the neck (arenšt there other places to get blood
from? It seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough. If it's good
enough for doctors to draw blood from, then why do vampires stray from that
sight?) To fight the spell, she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall,
dark and handsome vampire hunter (you guessed it, his name is D). The
vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires, being attracted to the 17
year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much. You see,
like all heroes in these kinds of stories, hešs a brooder, whošs sole
purpose in life is to remain really, really silent. When he speaks, itšs in
cliches. Heroes like this are bad when theyšre live, even worse when
animated.
Later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire, who
wants to marry the peasant girl because hešs bored after 10,000 years of
living (the only clever vampire insight made in the movie), Will Vampire
Hunter D rush to save her in time? Will we see blood and intestines
spattering on every place imaginable? 
In itšs defense, the animation, when focusing on being original rather than
recycling anime slicing, could at times be original. The talking hand was
clever - and I think the inspiration for a skateboard-related logo. And
thatšs the best defense I can think of. 
I understand that Vampire Hunter D is supposed to be a fave among anime
fans, but I really donšt see it. Itšs an excuse to watch blood dripping from
teeth, blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks, and most
importantly, like all violent anime, it is an excuse to see animated
breasts. Why? What is the point of that? Maybe I have to understand the
genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny. Išm not a prude, I just
donšt think itšs warranted. It puts itself so far out in front of the movie
that everything else gets lost. Is there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old
in the shower? Of course not  itšs done for shock. Itšs tasteless and
despicable.

Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
 It took me too long to see Saving Private Ryan - I finally saw the
movie the second time it was released. No one wanted to see it with
me; either they had already seen it or just afraid to go, they heard
about the Omaha Beach scene. They knew what they were in for. It's not
a buddy movie, a date movie, it's not an independent film. It's an
experience, and sometimes those can be hard to watch.
 After the academy had deemed it Oscar worthy, after the accolades and
the money and the praise heaped upon Spielberg and Hanks, and it was
released a second time, I finally dragged the first available
person. I wasn't going to miss out.
 It is the best movie of war I have ever seen. It competes with All
Quiet on the Western Front, Platoon, The Best Years of Our Lives and
Patton. But to me, it rises above those films because the experience
stayed with me long after the theater. Yes, Omaha beach will long be
in my memory, but so will the scene of the grunt trying to save the
girl from sniper attack in the rainy French village; the final battle
where men are slaughtered in hopes of saving a bridge, the moment on
the stairs where a soldier confronts cowardice (which to me, resonates
as one of the most realistic war scenes ever filmed. Of course in war
there are heroes, but where there are heroes, there must be
cowards. We don't see them in movies too often, but it frightens us
more than death.)
 After three hours of Ryan, the audience didn't walk away from the
theater easily. We were quiet as we left, many in tears, careful about
the words we chose and who would hear what we say. Ryan is a movie
that must be spoken of with the utmost care. You don't want to detract
anything from the experience.
 Much has been written about the landing at Omaha beach; the absolute
carnage, terror and shock. I never realized, even after reading the
reviews, that those soldiers were simply sitting ducks in battle. You
almost smell the blood mixing with the beach water. It is a triumph
that any man made it off that beach alive.
 Ryan is honest, violent, and pulls your emotional strings at the
right time, so you don't feel manipulated but instead shock, even
fear. We weep because we have no other way of expressing what we're
watching. He opens and closes the film with a US flag. Pride?
Patriotism? Yes, but it's also a lesson not to take anything for
granted.
 What's the point in reviewing a movie that doesn't need any else to
say "Go see it?" Because it fills you with so much emotion and visual
horror that a way of cleansing is to write and talk about it. After I
got home from the theater I didn't say much of anything at all, only
thankful that I watched it, and I wasn't there.

Review for Thousand Acres, A (1997)

I've never read Jane Smiley's "A Thousand Acres," nor have I read
Shakespeare's "King Lear," which is what the new movie "A Thousand Acres" is
supposed to be based off of.  After reading the press kit and browsing the
internet for awhile, I knew what the main plot for both of them were supposed
to be: A wealthy, respected man divides his kingdom among his daughters
and they squabble over the land. In the middle of that, there is incest,
division among the family (especially the sisters), and a whole lot of
dying.  
A story like that sounds like it should be entertaining, but the film
version of "A Thousand Acres" is pretty far from entertainment.  It's a lot
like sitting around your house on a Saturday afternoon with nothing to do. 
You turn on the TV and watch without caring if it's good or bad - it's
just on.  That's what "A Thousand Acres" is - it's just on.  It's not at all
good, but then, it's not that bad. You just sit, drifting off into space
asking, "Well, what else am I going to do?"
I liked a few things about the movie: Jessica Lange turns in a good
performance (as always), and the cinematography is beautiful (I wish they would
have shown more of it).  But all of the characters are written and
portrayed as one-dimensional, stereotyped people.  The director, Jocelyn
Moorhouse, doesn't give the audience any sense of who we should like. The movie
is confused, and there is no sense of consistency in the story or with the
characters.         
For example, at the beginning of the movie, I got a real sense that the
daughters truly loved their father, ten minutes later, they profess no
loyalty to him, proclaiming him as the biggest jerk that has ever walked the
land. Why? We're not given a reason. 
Then there's Michelle Pfeiffer, who was out of place in this movie.  She
plays an emotionless character in a role that demands emotion.  Jason
Robards, who has won two academy awards in the past, is reduced to grunting
out a stereotyped performance.  "I'm an old man! And things just aren't as
good as they used to be!"  
Of course, all the men in the film have to be villains.  There's a scene
in a Thousand Acres where Jessica Lange starts an affair with Jess (played
by Colin Firth). During the scene, the director wants us to be happy that
Lange is having this affair; as they kiss, sweet, romantic music starts
up and the photography gives us a sense of joy and passion.  But, there was
no reason for our sympathies to be with her.  Her husband (played by
Keith Carradine) didn't seem to be a bad guy - certainly not bad enough so
that she had to go out and have an affair on him.  
What's most disappointing about the movie is that you're left with
nothing afterwards.  A friend remarked, "For a movie that's supposed to make you
feel something, bring out emotions in you and make you feel sad, it just
didn't."  I think that sums it up - it's not that it was an awful movie,
it's just that it didn't make you feel anything.  Watching something like
that is always a let down. 
If you're in the mood to watch a good movie about the trials and
successes of Midwestern farmers, I highly recommend "Troublesome Creek: A
Midwestern", which is out on video right now. 
"A Thousand Acres"  (* and a half out of four).  Directed by Jocelyn
Moorhouse.  Starring Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfieffer, Jennifer Jason Lee, and
Jason Robards.

Review for Mimic (1997)
"Mimic":  *1/2 out of four. Directed by Guillermo Del Toro. Starring Mira
Sorvino, Josh Brolin, and Charles S. Dutton.
        As bad as "Mimic" was, it definitly scared me.  "Mimic" continued the
frightening Hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of
creative ingenuity and style, and completely flushing it when he comes to
America to make a movie. 
Director Guillermo Del Toro was recently imported from Mexico after he
made the award winning and inventive horror film "Cronos."  That movie
worked because it took an unconventional story, unique characters and well
written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie.  In "Mimic", Del
Toro doesn't bother to give us anything original.  The plot is a stupid
combination of "Aliens" meets "Species" meets "Jurassic Park."  The characters
have been recycled from a few hundred other movies.  There's nothing new
in "Mimic".  It's just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work.  At the end
of the movie, you're stuck wanting your money back.
Maybe the worst thing about the movie is that Del Toro followed another
annoying trend of recent movies: he forgot to turn the lights on.  I don't
understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the "Seven" trend
and be set in dark, dank areas.  Watching "Mimic" I was tempted several
times to yell at the screen "Turn the lights on! The switch is to your right!
Use common sense! Just do it! You'll be able to see the monster in the
corner!"  There's a scene where Mira Sorvino is standing in subway station
while the lights are flickering on and off.  It looked like the light
operator was having a seizure, and Sorvino didn't even notice - she just stood
there looking like she was having deep thoughts.  "Hmmm.... I think bean
soup would be good for dinner tonight."  
"Mimic" has a lot of incidental shock tactics (Boo! Just kidding!) and
follows them up with the real scare, but nothing in this movie scares you. 
The audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments; I
think they were bored, too.
I shouldn't blame Del Toro.  He isn't the first successful foreign
director to come to Hollywood and make a bad movie.  Hong Kong director John
Woo made two of the best action films of all time, "The Killer" and "Hard
Boiled" then came to America to make the stupid "Broken Arrow."  French
directors Luc Besson ("La Femme Nikita") and George Sluizer ("The Vanishing")
followed Woo's lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies.  Robert
Rodriguez, who directed the terrific low budget "El Mariachi" came to
Hollywood and directed the horrible, high-budget "Desperado." 
I don't know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country
can't make a good American movie.  Woo finally broke through and made
"Face/Off", but it still isn't up to par with his earlier films.  
I get the feeling a Hollywood producer sits in his office, chews on a
big smelly cigar and says to the director, "Welcome to America!  I bet you
must be tired after being on that boat for so long.  Do you speak English?
Now, I know you think you've made good movies in the past, but now you're
in America, so things are a little different here.  Just remember what the
American audience always wants, and you'll be fine. They want to see at
least one big breasted woman, characters that they've seen a thousand times
before (because change scares Americans), and you always  need a cheesy
feel-good ending to wrap things up.  If you don't make that kind of movie,
you'll be shining my shoes in no time."

Review for L.A. Confidential (1997)
It is an understood passion and an understood calm.  Bud White walks into
the home of Lynn Bracken, a prostitute "cut to look like Veronica Lake." 
He's one of L.A.'s finest investigating the murder of fellow cop, and one
of the leads takes him to her home.  It's understood that he is quiet
thunder, a guy who's calm voice is more powerful than his arms.  It's
understood that she's supposed to be beautiful, but underneath her face is pain
and scraped out lines that say her life could have been so much more.  You
know without having to be told.  "You're the first guy who hasn't told me
I look like Veronicca Lake in under a minute," she says.
"You look ten times better."  He says it without thinking. Like he knows
without her having to say anything.  White's face doesn't turn, it doesn't
blush.  You see his eyes, and you believe him.  It's a perfect moment in
a near perfect movie.
L.A. Confidential is the best movie of the year.  It is grace and poetry;
a richly layered work of pure entertainment.  It is a portrait of police
and morality as it works it's way through characters that are so real on
screen that you believe that they might have a soul.  In a phrase, it is
everything. It is funny, it is exciting, has enough action and adventure and
mystery and grace and suspense.  It is the pinnacle of a movie, a
complete work, a flawless film.  
It's hard to tell you about the plot, because it's about so much more
than plot.  Besides, there's too much to describe. Sure, it's about police
and searching for corruption and who fights for the right reasons and the
definition of justice.  But it's also about what you feel when you look into
the eyes of the characters in the film.  Director Curtis Hanson has
perfectly framed each character, letting you see into them, rooting for them
one moment, doubting them the next.  The actors work with their lines, but
in this movie their most important weapon is their eyes.  You can tell what
each person is feeling just by looking into their eyes for one moment.  
Russell Crowe plays Bud White, a muscle cop with a beef for wife beaters.
 His movements are fierce.  When he strikes, you jump, when he's calm,
you know it won't be for long.  His intensity oozes out of the screen.  You
follow his character through the movie afraid of him, but in sympathy of
him, because you know how good his heart is.  He's looking for a way to
solve crimes, you're just never sure how he's going to do it.  
His counter is Ed Exley, played with a chisselled face by Guy Pierce. 
You feel for him, for his character, because of all the cops in the movie
he's the one that's actually trying to do the right thing by going by the
book.  You know that he must face the reality of breaking the book, and you
love the way he gets there.  
I've seen L.A Confidential  twice, immediately after it was over, I
wanted to hit the rewind button and watch it again.  I didn't want the theater
experience to end.  It's been a long time since I actually experienced a
movie, feeling like I got something after I walked out.  That's why I love
movies; the great ones can be too rich and powerful to describe.  Watch
L.A. Confidential:  after you leave the theater, you feel like you just
watched a classic movie.  That's why LA Confidential stands as the best movie
of the year.
L.A. Confidential (**** out of four) Directed by Curtis Hanson. Starring
Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, and Kim Basinger.

Title
Review for Five Easy Pieces (1970)
Written by Carole Eastman (as Adrien Joyce) and Bob Rafelson
The calling card of Five Easy Pieces is Jack Nicholson's line "I want you to
hold it between your knees." And indeed, nearly 30 years after it was
released, this is what is ultimately remembered about the film: Jack
Nicholson demanding from a waitress that he wants two slices of wheat toast
and his explanation on how she should get it. A chicken salad sandwich, with
wheat toast, hold the chicken. "You want me to hold the chicken?"
I can't tell you how many times I've heard that line imitated by people
trying to do a Jack impersonation. Most times, people get it wrong, saying
"stick it" rather than "hold it". It's famous, I guess, because it deals
with our frustrations of never getting what we want. Nicholson has to go out
of his way simply to get two slices of wheat toast. Imagine how challenging
it must be when there are far greater possessions for him to obtain: love,
respect, dignity, reliable transportation, etc...
However, it's unfortunate that the film is left standing by the side of the
road with only that scene. People don't recognize it as a moment of
frustration, only Nicholson saying something really Jack-like. Surrounding
the famous line is a truly great and completely intelligent character study.
Here, we see so many real people go in and out of this movie, providing
layer upon layer of wonderful dialogue, moments and life. Now it's a chicken
salad sandwich without the chicken salad. 
Nicholson plays a drifter, who at the start of the film works on an oil rig.
He soon quits, I think, because he realizes he's too good for this kind of
work? Why? Because he used to be a talented musician, raised in a musical
family. Instead of using those talents, he lives the life of someone who
always wants something more, mistreating and hurting the things that he has.
He mentally abuses and degrades his girlfriend, the only person in the film
that seems to be able to love somebody unconditionally. But he's not
interested in unconditional love, instead he does whatever he can to get her
to run from him. 
This is slow paced film, and I imagine that's a reason that this movie isn't
mentioned in the same breath with other great films made in the seventies.
Current movies must move incredibly quickly, with sharp editing, fast
dialogue and speeches that can never be said. Even recent character studies
won't allow characters to elaborate because it would take up too much screen
time and make for slow pacing. Five Easy Pieces gives the audience a chance
to savor its speeches and long moments of silence and reflection.  Consider
Nicholson's speech to his father, admitting his failures to man who cannot
speak back, only sit in a wheelchair with condemning. It is moment that is
as moving and powerful as the closing speech to "Death of a Salesman", full
of agony and regret. 
This is one of Nicholson's best performances, a variation on his character
studies of men in search for purpose in an age when their role was
dramatically shifting after 200 years of static.  It reminds me, in a way,
of Dostoyesky's Crime and Punishment, about a character who believed himself
as a superman - so intellectually above the society he lives in that he feel
he can do whatever he wants, regardless of consequence. Nicholson acts in a
similar manner, wandering through people's lives and hurting them, mostly
because he's too selfish to understand how not to.

Title
Review for Network (1976)
 As I watched Network, Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky's stunning
satire of news journalism, I drew parallels to the beginnings of my
career; I'm currently trying to work my way into journalism and news
reporting, trying to live out my dream of being a reporter or an
editor.  I've written what seems like thousands of cover letters to
anyone with a publication, begging editors to take a chance on me. I
write these letters as though I were on my hands and knees; because
sometimes it's just that hard to break into the field.  You'd try
anything, even begging.  Network starts out with idealistic people
like me in mind, but then let's us know that there is absolutely no
room for realism where money and ratings are involved and leaves us
behind in the first fifteen minutes.  After all, most, if not all,
news outlets are run by corporations who are bound to fulfill life's
beautiful chain: you have to make people watch or read your product,
advertisers will pay money to reach those people, and money is
God. This isn't a new concept, of course, but it's delivery in Network
is so cynical and angry that it seems new and leaves you with a sense
of doom.
 "I'm mad as hell and I'm not gong to take it anymore!" I've been
saying that line for years, but until I first watched Network, I
didn't realize it's significance.  I had no idea what "it" was. The
story is about, more or less, Howard Beale (played by Peter Finch),
who had been the nightly newscaster for the fictional UBS news for the
past eleven years, until he was fired for low ratings. He had nothing
else except his news job; no kids, no wife, so his whole life revolves
around being a journalist. You can imagine what this must do to a
person.  When Beale is told that he has been fired, he goes on air to
announce his suicide. He's calmed down and given one more chance, but
this time he goes on air to say that life "is bullshit, always has
been bullshit, always will be bullshit." That doesn't get him fired:
the network realizes that his on air tirades are ratings gold, and it
gets him his job back. Beale is later "taken over" by the truth, and
his show isn't about news, but becomes his own pulpit to tell a studio
audience and anyone else who will tune in what's wrong with our world
(and the answer was almost always the network he worked for.) The show
is a number in the ratings.
 Network's critique of news ends about halfway through the film and
moves on to television and people who grew up knowing nothing else
besides the glowing box (people like me). Faye Dunaway, who is perfect
in this movie, plays the vice president in charge of programming.
When she realizes that Beale is a ratings bonanza, she demands to be
put in charge of the news.  What does she know of journalism? Nothing,
but she knows everything about getting people to tune in; so she
creates and supports Beale's news circus.  Her character is a
television; it is superficial and cannot feel emotion. In a way she is
nothing more than a machine from a show like Lost in Space.
 William Holden plays one of the only characters sane characters in
the story.  He had been in charge of the news department, but watched
as Dunaway turn into a circus. Still, he leaves and betrays his wife
to start an affair with Dunaway, because he's attached to the
television too.  "I can't get you out of my mind." Holden realizes
that she's nothing more than a television, but still tells her, "All I
want is you for you to love me."
 "I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore" has been accepted
as one of most favored maxims. All of us, at several times during our
lives, are mad as hell, and many of us shout those exact same
words. We scream that we won't take it anymore, but really, what do we
do about it? Network is the kind of movie that critiques what is
wrong, but then asks us what we're going to do about it, knowing full
well that the only answer is nothing. We just take pleasure in
shouting from the windows that we're mad as hell.  It's the release
that we enjoy. Network is the blackest type of satire; like
Dr. Strangelove, it creates a reality that is extremely plausible and
convinces us that it could happen, but at the same time tries to
maintain a level morbid insanity and humor. The events in Network
could happen (and some would argue that Fox Television has already
created that reality) but we laugh it off because we know there's
nothing we're going to do about it.

Title
Review for Payback (1999)
Payback (* 1/2 out of four)
Starring Mel Gibson, Maria Bello, Kris Kristofferson
Written by Donald E. Westlake, adapted from the novel The Hunter, written by
Richard Stark
Directed by Brian Helgeland
It seems that I've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to
watch. Take Payback, for example, a movie that most people seem to
like. However, It's horrible schlock, straight out of hollywood's vast
talent for sucking creativity out of movies. It was written and
directed by a guy who should have done better; however, maybe he did
do better, after all, 30 percent of the movie isn't his own. Mel
Gibson, that hollywood zombie, decided he didn't like the ending and
had another director reshoot it. What a crock. If you sign on to do a
movie, then do it the way the script calls for. Why film a movie and
then look at it later and say, - No, I changed my mind, I don't like
the ending. You're fired. Let's get someone else to do it. - I suppose
honor is dead in Hollywood.
The end of the film is, of course, hollywoodized. Which is to say that
it's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his
prize. In this case, as is most victories in Hollywood movies,
Gibson's prize is a blond and money. I miss originality in film, I
really do. I think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop
down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original. Payback's
tagline - Get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original
idea, but it was far from the truth. While Gibson's character
certainly broke the law, he was a character that had honor (odd that
Gibson himself seems to have very little of it), wouldn't kill in
front of children and protects his blond woman. There's nothing bad
about him - he's a hollywood character, a person who could never exist
in real life. And Gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act
like a "bad guy", and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant.
The story involves Gibson being double-crossed by his partner (who is
a real bad guy, which made me wish that we could root for him) over
$70,000. Gibson recovers from multiple gunshots, is pissed
(naturally), and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of
money back - no more, no less. He makes a point of it that it's
strictly 70 grand. A real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay
25% interest. This idea is completely stretched out.  Gibson ends up
going after his partner and the Chicago mafia that his partner is
affiliated with. What I didn't understand - this is the Chicago
mafia. $70,000 is like spare change to them. They'd probably just pay
the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him. I
think they'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a
simple $70,000.
Maybe I'm being too hard on the movie. Perhaps the filmmakers were
just trying to make a simple popcorn movie. I read Roger Ebert's
review and he liked Gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart
playing a bad guy.  That's why we're allowed to root for him. And it's
true - Gibson walks the movie as if he's smiling at a joke he just
heard. But he's wrong here. I wanted a Lee Marvin or old-time Clint
Eastwood or somebody who wasn't a comic, just an ass kicker.
As a side note, I've just checked the Internet Movie Database and
discovered that I am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of
Payback. After this many reviews, why would anyone want to read this?
Really, I don't care. I'm just trying to gain membership into the
on-line film critics society by posting as many reviews as I can.
