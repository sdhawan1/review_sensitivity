Title
Review for Exotica (1994)
     The Exotica is a nightclub on the outskirts of Toronto, where
Eric, DJ and sort of MC/animateur, watches nightly as his ex-girlfriend
Christina performs.  Watches jealously, especially as far as the extra
attentions regular customer Thomas (or Francis?) garners are
concerned.  Francis (or Thomas?), meanwhile and erstwhile, goes through
a series of, um, interesting situations involving his pet shop, a gruff
taxi-sharing stranger, unexpected tickets to the opera and smuggled
eggs of some rare bird.
     Multiple story lines unfold in a splendid tangle of cutbacks,
forward and backward references and recurring themes, all woven around
the Exotica, its customers and the people who work and live there.
     This is a calm roller-coaster ride of a movie, if that makes any
sense to you, visually and plot-wise (plot-wise indeed) and
intriguingly and emotionally and acoustically moving.
     Rating? What rating? See the most excellent Internet Movie
Database at http://www.cm.cf.ac.uk/Movies/moviequery.html for all that
technical stuff.
