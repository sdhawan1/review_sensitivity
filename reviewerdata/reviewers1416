Blood Simple
A film review by Robert Marley- Copyright Š 2000 filmcritic.com
-------------------------------------
The year is 1984. Reagan is looking forward to four more years as
president. Orwell's book by the same name is at the top of the
popularity bell curve. The Olympic games are held in Los Angeles and two
unknown guys named Joel and Ethan Coen decide to team up and write a
movie script. Their first step into the world of "Hollywood" is a little
film called Blood Simple featuring the debut of then-unknown actress
Frances McDormand. The title of the film comes from a slang term
invented by Dashiell Hammett to suggest a murderer's state of fear and
confusion, which suggests that the "perfect" murder is impossible. This
movie shows one such example of that blood simple state.
At the time it was released, Blood Simple wowed critics and audiences,
winning praise at film festivals all over the world with its unique look
at telling an interesting and creepy story on a shoestring budget. Now
16 years later, the Coen brothers have decided to clean up their debut
film and re-release it to the masses, making it even better.
This new release of Blood Simple is sort of a Director's Cut of the
movie. As Ethan Coen put it, "We've taken out some of the boring parts."
Because of that, the film is only 97 minutes long. But what is told
inside of those 97 minutes is truly riveting.
Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) is a rich saloon owner, deep in the heart of
middle-of-nowhere Texas. He suspects that his wife Abby (McDormand) is
cheating on him, so he hires a sleazy, sweaty private detective (M.
Emmet Walsh) to find out and kill her and her lover. Of course, things
don't always go as planned, especially when it comes to murder... and
what happens next is probably one of the better examples of a modern
"film noir" concept.
The movie is also filled with the little things that make a Coen
brothers film unique. Watching it is like going on a ride. The camera is
always on the go, creating a sense of motion in almost ever scene.
Ironically, the things that have become the "signature" of a Coen
brothers film were done merely by chance at the time they were shooting
all of this. One particular example is a tracking shot down the length
of the bar in the saloon with a drunk passed out across the path of the
camera. The camera simply goes up and over the drunk, dropping back to
its original angle and tracking along the bar as if nothing had
happened.
The movie is dark, raw and bleak. The Coen brothers do a good job of
projecting that bleak, dismal look into the picture as the characters
stumble their paranoid way through the story. This makes for a morbidly
comical and fascinating experience for the audience. Ultimately, the
movie has just enough of a sick sense of humor that I'm sure Hitchcock
would have loved it.

Review for Eye of the Beholder (1999)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Robert Marley.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/ed829efa1f9df8c88825687700233434?OpenDocument
Eye of the Beholder
A film review by Robert Marley - Copyright Š 2000 filmcritic.com
Apparently it's not all tuxedos and vodka martinis, shaken not stirred,
in the alleged real-world of the British intelligence. Ewan McGregor
plays `The Eye' a high-tech voyeur who is about as charismatic as a
piece of lawn furniture. But it's not about that. The Eye's job, as the
name implies, is about surveillance: A responsibility that requires him
to detach himself from the rest of the world and watch it through an
electronic eye. Yet it is this very act that has caused his greatest
grief and most regrets in life. He blames himself for the loss of his
wife and daughter. Now they appear to him in hallucinations.
The Eye's current assignment is to follow Joanna Eris (Ashley Judd), a
woman accused of blackmailing a British official.  But she is far more
than a simple blackmailer.  She is a crafty, seductive spider woman,
capable of killing as quickly as she can seduce.  As The Eye continues
to watch Eris, he becomes entranced by her disguises and cunning charm.
Soon he begins to feel that they are kindred spirits.
Director Stephan Elliott, whose directing credits include The Adventures
of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert, attempts to be very artistic with
this film.  There are lots of interesting angles, lots of symbolism, and
some tricky sequences which segue from a television image of a scene
into the scene itself, but it's not enough to compensate for a script
that literally goes all over the map, slowly.  Slowly is the key to all
of this.  The film is so drawn-out that you will probably be checking
your watch.  A lot.
Ashley Judd turns in an average performance as the seductive mistress of
disguises but there really isn't much to the character. Yes she has a
background, yes she emotes her psychological setbacks, but there really
isn't much groundbreaking to the character or to her performance.
Likewise, Jason Priestley is just a joke  a comic relief in the middle
of a boring, go nowhere flick.  K.D. Lang comes up with an equally
uninteresting performance.  McGregor does a good job with his
obsessive-compulsive character but again, it's not anything to write
home about.
In fact, when the credits rolled, the entire theater replied with a
resoundingly quizzical, `Huh?'  I was left wondering just what Elliott
and screenwriter Marc Behm were attempting with this nonsensical
rambling mess.  They tried to be psychological, it came across as
confusing.  They tried to be mysterious, it came across as random.  It's
like watching a movie in a different language without subtitles.  You
can sort of figure out what is going on, but for the most part, you're
lost.

Title
Review for Lawrence of Arabia (1962)
Being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that I am, I am
somewhat embarrassed to admit that I had not seen Lawrence of Arabia
(coming soon to DVD) until only recently.  After all, it's considered by
just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director David Lean,
who also directed films such as Bridge on the River Kwai, and Doctor
Zhivago.  So one day, a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and
I sat down and watched it.  I was initially skeptical that something
made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the
butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration.  But now I fully understand
why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against --
the winner of seven Academy Awards in 1963 for Best Picture, Director,
Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Music, and Sound.  After
watching the film again, I am convinced that it is simply one of the
finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen.
Based on the autobiographical writing of British officer T.E. Lawrence
during World War I, Lawrence of Arabia depicts Lawrence (played by
then-unknown actor Peter O'Toole) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of
military discipline whatsoever.  Bored with his assignment of coloring
maps for the British Army in a dimly lit headquarters building, Lawrence
jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an Arabian
prince fighting against the Turkish army.  Lawrence quickly sees just
how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up
rallying the various tribes together to fight the Turks and help the
British turn the tide of World War I.
Shot in Panavision's famed Super 70mm format, the film beautifully
illustrates the definition of the word epic.  It is absolutely
breathtaking.  Using stunning cinematography, costuming, and direction,
shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth, I can
only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and
watch this story unfold before my eyes.  Every shot is choreographed as
a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land.  David Lean put his
reputation on the line to get this film completed, and the fact that it
was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology
of the motion picture industry at the time, a far cry from its pathetic,
uncreative existence today.
After watching the film, the first thing that came to my mind was, "I've
got to do a remake of this film!"  But then I thought about trying to
pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive: "Okay, it's going to be
almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the
Sahara desert.  We are going to need to blow up a full-size train
because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice.  And we
are not going to use any big stars, and won't have any female actors
since there's no love story."
Yes, my friends, the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of Hollywood
a long time ago.  But at least we still have the proof to show all
would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be.
Director: David Lean
Producer: Sam Spiegel
Screenwriter: Robert Bolt, Michael Wilson
Stars: Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Omar
Sharif, Claude Rains, José Ferrer, Anthony Quayle

Title
Review for Ran (1985)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Robert Marley.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/e8d729e068d7dec888256925005d70ee?OpenDocument
-------------------------------------
The average movie enthusiast has probably heard the name Akira Kurosawa
mentioned with reverence in pretentious film-snob circles or in almost
any film school, but chances are the average movie enthusiast probably
hasn't bothered to ever really watch any of Kurosawa's films, which is a
real shame. For in these films lies the expression of unbelievable
talent - a poetry of motion and color - created and painted by a true
master of the art of modern cinema.  Now in theatrical reissue, casual
moviegoers once again have the chance to see Ran, Kurosawa's
masterpiece, on the big screen.
Kurosawa's closest colleagues addressed him as "sensei," a respectful
and affectionate term meaning "teacher" or "master," and for good
reason: He is without question, the master of Japanese cinema and an
artist whose film legacy spanned 50 years of moviemaking.  He influenced
filmmakers such as Lucas, Spielberg, Coppola, Scorsese and countless
others.  For example, the movie A Fistful of Dollars was really nothing
more than Western remake of the Kurosawa film Yojimbo, and The
Magnificent Seven was a remake of The Seven Samurai.  The Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Kurosawa four times in his
career, and Ran has won countless awards, including Best Film from the
esteemed National Society of Film Critics.  The film was Kurosawa's
obsession for more than 10 years and he feared that the movie would
never be made.  When it finally did get financing, it became Japan's
most expensive film ever made at the time.
Ran, which translates as "chaos" or "turmoil," is Kurosawa's meditation
on Shakespeare's King Lear, mixed with the history of Japan's 16th
century Civil Wars, and the Japanese legend of Mori.
At the age of 70, after years of consolidating his empire, the Great
Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (played brilliantly by Tatsuya Nadakai) decides
to abdicate the throne and divide his domain among his three sons.  To
illustrate his demand for family unity, Hidetora shows that a single
arrow can be easily broken, but three arrows held together are strong. 
But the loyalty the Great Lord dreams of doesn't happen and his empire
falls to family bickering and civil war, with the old lord traveling
from son to son in a futile attempt to keep empire and family together.
The film is beautifully well made, with subtle changes in color and
texture as the story progresses.  The characters makeup resembling an
early form of Japanese theater. Epic battles, requiring the use of 1,400
extras and hundreds of horses are shot using a multi-camera technique
that Kurosawa himself developed.  All of these elements combine to
create a feeling of immersion in the story.  And while some of the
battle scenes seem a bit campy by today's standards - with an overuse of
blood that looks more like paint - the overall picture is dramatic,
impressive, and visually stunning.
At 2 hours and 40 minutes the film is a bit on the long side for most
people but it does not deter from the fact that Ran is an incredible
picture worth seeing and talking about.  Whether you really are a
pretentious film snob or just someone who appreciates seeing something
well made, this film is a must-see.

Review for Tao of Steve, The (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Robert Marley.

http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/4d264cdb1503bdbc8825690f0078dfe7?OpenDocument
The Tao of Steve
A film review by Robert Marley- Copyright Š 2000 filmcritic.com
The word "Tao" has many meanings, one of which is, "The art or skill of
doing something in harmony with the essential nature of the thing."
The Tao of Steve is a story is about a guy named Dex (Donal Logue), an
unlikely hero living in Santa Fe who has grafted this ancient Chinese
philosophy with the super-cool personalities of guys like Steve McQueen,
Steve McGarret, and Steve Austin (though not "Stone Cold"). This
mutation of philosophies has become a foolproof theory on dating that
Dex and his buddies refer to as "The Tao of Steve". In other words, it's
the art of scoring with women while being in harmony with the essential
nature of all things cool.
Back in his college days, Dex was the big man on campus. The consummate
"player," his conquests in the realm of the opposite sex were the stuff
of legends - at least back then. But ten years and about a hundred
pounds later, Dex has become sort of the inside joke at his college
reunion. While trying to pick up a young bartender at the reunion, he
spots a woman named Syd (Greer Goodman) - a motorcycle-riding beauty who
seems immune to Dex's magical powers of the Tao. Through a series of
circumstances, Syd and Dex are thrown together, and he soon finds
himself questioning his belief in all things Steve, even as he continues
to be the ultimate Steve guru.
Donal Logue, best known as the "naughty vampire god" sidekick in the
movie Blade, received the Special Jury Award at the 2000 Sundance Film
Festival for his performance as this once-legendary, now-pathetic
Casanova. His portrayal -- based loosely on the personality of co-writer
Duncan North -- was funny, believable and very well-done. The film is
filled with a cast of first-timers and Greer Goodman -- also making her
film debut -- does a good job of both co-writing and acting in this fun
little romantic comedy. Shooting in New Mexico didn't hurt this picture
either, and the locations used are impressive and filled with color,
which help to create a sense of liveliness within the film.
The Tao of Steve is a funny, insightful little romp through a philosophy
that most people can associate with, eventually settling into a basic
love story. And while Jenniphr Goodman's (not a typo) direction is
pretty basic, it doesn't distract from this being a very entertaining
movie. God bless the independent filmmaker who is free to make a film
not based around demographics or seasonal box office appeal, but on the
value of the story being told. This is the way cinema was intended.

Review for Topsy-Turvy (1999)

Gilbert and Sullivan and so much more.
A film review by Robert Marley - Copyright Š 2000 filmcritic.com
One of my earliest childhood remembrances was watching a performance of
H.M.S. Pinafore. I thought it was really neat. The costumes and music
were amazing and even though I couldn't understand all of what was going
on, I was fascinated by how all of these people worked together.
Now 20 years later, while watching another Gilbert and Sullivan
performance (of sorts) I am still thinking the same things.
`Topsy Turvy' is the story about the two collaborators who during the
late 19th century created such musical masterpieces as H.M.S. Pinafore,
the Pirates of Penzance, The Mikado and many others.
William Schwenck Gilbert (Played by Jim Broadbent) is the librettist,
writing the words. Arthur Sullivan (played by Allan Corduner) is the
composer, writing the music. Gilbert is the very model of a 19th-Century
British gentleman, an overly proper married man certain that he knows
best  which he often does. Sullivan lives a freer life, almost
libertine by comparison; but there is a seriousness of purpose in him.
For nearly a decade, Gilbert and Sullivan's collaborations have
delighted the English people. Their popular comic operas have recouped
handsomely for the successful Savoy Theatre; impresario Richard D'Oyly
Carte (played by Ron Cook) himself is a stabilizing influence, gently
but firmly overseeing the two men.
But, in 1884, as a London heat wave cuts into the theater trade, their
latest work, `Princess Ida' receives only lukewarm press. Sullivan
wants to quit and compose more serious music, but the two are
contractually obligated to create a new work for Carte. Sullivan rejects
Gilbert's next idea as `topsy-turvy' and unbelievable, and although
Gilbert tries to accommodate him, they cannot agree. Mired at a creative
impasse, Gilbert and Sullivan can barely converse.
Then, Gilbert's wife, Lucy `Kitty': Gilbert (Lesley Manville), drags him
along to a Japanese exhibition. Exposure to the very different culture
sparks inspiration in Gilbert. He rebounds, conceiving `The Mikado.' The
concept encourages Sullivan, and the production comes together, which is
when the TRULY hard work begins.
Written and Directed by Mike Leigh (Secrets and Lies, Life is Sweet) the
film is visually impressive and amazingly well performed. However, the
pace of the movie is leisurely at best, which unfortunately makes for an
ass-numbing collection of costumes, characters and sub-plots. There are
so many characters and background stories introduced through the film
that you almost need a playbill just to keep up with everything. What's
worse, is that after spending so much time working through all of the
developing plots, all the stories seems to get wrapped up at a blinding
pace towards the last 30 minutes of the film.
Fans of Gilbert and Sullivan's work will no-doubt delight in the
fantastic musical numbers (some performed in their operatic entirety),
but will they want to see all of the this combined with the backstage
bickering and headaches that it took to accomplish such memorable
pieces?
Overall the movie looks good, the costumes are beautiful and its
fascinating to watch all the people working together, but when spread
out over the 160 minutes of running length, it just makes for a long,
drawn-out film appealing primarily to most viewers' mothers.
My opinion: a good rental for a rainy day.

Review for Opportunists, The (2000)

http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/9e0c4592566c4fe7882569080063bf70?OpenDocument
The Opportunists
A film review by Robert Marley - Copyright Š 2000 filmcritic.com
Christopher Walken is a great choice to work with any first-time
director/screenwriter, as he can "sell" any character put in front of
him. From a sword-swinging headless horseman in Tim Burton's Sleepy
Hollow to a wristwatch smuggling Air Force Captain in Tarentino's Pulp
Fiction, Walken breathes an air of believability into any persona, which
is hardly something that every actor can do. Because of this, the films
he is in always seem to be at the very least entertaining, and The
Opportunists is no exception to the rule. Set against the backdrop of
the Sunnyside, Queens neighborhood of New York, The Opportunists is the
story of a man who can't seem to do the right thing, no matter how hard
he tries.
Walken plays Victor Kelly, an ex-con turned auto mechanic struggling to
be a responsible man, earning an honest living in the hopes of redeeming
himself for the lifetime of trouble he has brought down on his small,
fractured family. Add to the mix a young man named Michael (Peter
McDonald) who appears at his doorstep, claiming to be a cousin from
Ireland. Ironically, Michael has come to America to learn from the man
he believes is a successful mobster - as legend back home tells it. What
he actually finds in Vic is completely different. Vic is a proud man
with some heavy financial headaches. Too bullheaded to accept help from
his girlfriend (Cyndi Lauper). Vic soon realizes his skills as a
mechanic are not nearly as marketable as his safe-cracking skills, and
he reluctantly finds himself risking everything for one last shot to
save his business and his family.
The Opportunists is the feature debut of Irish-born director Myles
Connell, whose only other work appears to be an episode of Homicide:
Life on the Street. Connell sold the idea to producers John Lyons and
Tim Perell at the Sundance film festival and has done a good job of
penning the script. All the characters seem real, not comical for the
sake of levity, not two-dimensional for the sake of clarity, but
believable for the sake of the story. And for that, Connell should be
commended for a great first effort.
While the pacing of the film seems a bit slow (which is odd, considering
the movie is only 90 minutes long) the story being told is fresh enough
to keep you in your seat and interested in what is going on on-screen.
Of particular note, Cyndi Lauper does surprisingly well opposite Walken,
which helps add to the overall believability of the picture. Fresh and
entertaining, The Opportunists is a tribute to flawed but worthy men
everywhere.

Review for Cradle Will Rock (1999)
[filmcritic.com presents a review from guest writer Robert Marley.  You
can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/993d20f242f91f128825684400600d7d?OpenDocument
Arguably, one of the best directors of the motion picture industry,
Orson Welles was once quoted as saying, "When I die, they'll be picking
over my creative bones. The films will suddenly get financing; the films
will get restored. Old scripts that we couldn't get financed, they'll
find the financing for some kid to direct."
Strangely enough, Welles couldn't have been more prophetic.
Actor Tim Robins has donned the writer/director hat for his mostly-true
depiction of the wild chain of events surrounding one of Welles' more
notable career setbacks.
In 1937, Welles, along with his co-producer John Houseman directed a
musical catering to the mass of unemployed people designed to help them
cope with living though the depression era. The musical, entitled The
Cradle Will Rock was a strong pro-union, stab at big business,
encouraging the common man to stand up for what he believed in.
Unfortunately for Welles, 1937 was not just the tail end of the
depression, it was also an era rich with the paranoia of communist
sympathizers and a growing tension between socialism and fascism. The
musical was quickly accused of being communist propaganda and was closed
by the military on the night it was to open.
Not missing a beat and standing true to the adage that "the show must go
on" the cast of the musical marched to a smaller theater some 20 blocks
away and performed the musical in front of a packed audience without the
use of sets, props or even costumes. Union rules at the time prevented
them from even performing on a stage.
Robin's film makes it clear early on that this film is less of a
portrayal of the actual events surrounding the fateful musical and more
of a satirical  look at the sum of its parts. The characters are more
like caricature and it seems clear that Robbins had a bit of an ax to
grind towards Welles.  Angus MacFadyen (Braveheart, The Rat Pack)
portrays Welles as a money-grubbing, pretentious, drunkard, (alright, so
maybe that wasn't so far from the truth). In one scene at a night club,
the playwright (played by Hank Azaria) goes so far as to question
Welles' loyalty to the art by asking, "How soon before you are doing
soap commercials?" -- an obvious stab at his Ernest and Julio Gallo
commercials from the 80's.
This film seems slow and confusing at the start but warms up nicely as
it goes along, thanks to the talents of a surprisingly large and
impressive cast. There are several really blatant pieces of symbolism
throughout the film, and there are a few odd moments that leave you
thinking that you just missed something. However, Tim Robbins does a
great job of tying all of this neurotic, erratic hypertension together
in the end so that it inevitably tells a story of hope and survival for
such an often taken-for-granted ideal as freedom of speech.
The film is witty, entertaining and different. Unfortunately, due to an
acute case of cinematic intelligence, infected with meager support from
Buena Vista Pictures, this movie will most-likely be overlooked by the
majority of moviegoing audiences while they opt for the bigger,
flashier, and easier-to-understand blockbuster flicks being released for
the Christmas season.
But if you happen to find yourself in front of one of those old, small,
artsy theaters, I would recommend stopping in and checking this film
out.
