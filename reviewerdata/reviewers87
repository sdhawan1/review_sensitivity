Review for Bedazzled (2000)
Reflecting on "Bedazzled," a lively comedy about the
Devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic
loser, one sinful thought remains in my mind.  If Hell
means having to spend an eternity with Elizabeth
Hurley (who portrays the fiery demon), then use that
pitchfork and point me the way.   With her pouty lips,
irresistible British accent, and wild display of haute
couture, Hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills
your mind with temptation.  It's practically
impossible to turn this Beelzu-babe down.
Her next target is Elliot (Brendan Fraser), a tech
support geek who is clumsy, awkward, and just too
eager to please.  To aptly picture him, you would have
to remember a Saturday Night Live skit featuring
"Steve the Copy Guy" who effortlessly irritated his
co-workers with his unpolished social skills.  Eugene,
thus, is loathed and feared by his co-workers, who do
their best to stay out of his way.  Yet, beyond his
annoying mannerisms, he's a lovable oaf.  He wishes
that he could get closer to Allison (Frances
O'Connor), a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but
who has never taken notice of him.  However, the odds
of him getting together with her are about the same as
a snowball's chance in Hell.  "Dear God," he prays. 
"I would give anything to have that girl in my life." 
Guess who then shows up?
She makes an offer that is too hard to refuse.  "Seven
utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul."
 There's even an escape clause.  If Elliot's wish
doesn't go exactly the way he likes, he need only
'beep' her (one guess as to what the three-digit
number is) and he gets to start over.
The remainder of the film consists of Elliot's various
fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have
enormous amounts of wealth, power, fame and Allison's
love.  But when he makes sweeping statements such as
"I want to be very, very powerful and very, very rich
and married to Allison", he'll soon learn that the
Devil is in the details.  For example, (and we've seen
this several times in the trailers), he is granted his
wish, but finds out that he's a Columbian drug lord
and that Allison, while married to him, has her eyes
on someone else.  Apparently, the Devil is just as
eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his
soul.  His other wishes also end up with some strange
but funny twist that short-circuits his new life. 
Soon, Elliot wishes that he had never made that deal.
Given the mischievous nature of the Devil, "Bedazzled"
has many amusing moments.  A lot of the credit goes to
Fraser who turns in a great comic performance.  He
ably assumes various personas.  His funniest segment
is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive
man in the world.   Allison becomes so frustrated with
him that she practically urges him to take advantage
of her.
Hurley also heightens the humor quotient, especially
in the transitional scenes when Fraser waits to start
his next wish after bailing out of the previous one. 
It's clear that she's having a good time with it all. 
Yet, while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny
scenes, they conspicuously avoid developing the
allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that
could have added more heft to this story.  But that
would be playing with fire.  What they've got works,
so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little
comedy that it is.

Review for Monkeybone (2001)
"Monkeybone" starts off promisingly as an amusing
exploration into the personality of struggling
cartoonist Stu Smiley (likable Brendan Fraser).  His
earlier years were marked by bouts of horrifying
nightmares while success had always eluded him.  But
after meeting sleep therapist Julie (appealing Bridget
Fonda), things began to change.  His nightmares
disappeared and his newfound sense of peace led him to
his newest cartoon, "Monkeybone," an overactive,
orange-colored simian that's actually a representation
of his repressed and unsatisfied libido.
His idea becomes a hit.  The Cartoon Network thinks
it'll be the hottest thing since the Power Puff Girls
while merchandising opportunities hold the promise of
untold fortunes.  But he is currently more
pre-occupied with mustering the courage to propose to
Julie.  Unfortunately, a freak accident lands him in a
coma, and this is where the film's creative juices
begin to stream forth.
While Stu's body lies in a vegetative state in the
real world, his psyche descends to a place called
Downtown, a bizarre fantasyland that looks like a
haunted carnival influenced with a touch of Edgar
Allen Poe.   It's a visually stunning dimension with
it's unusual inhabitants lifted from the world of Star
Wars, including a bulbous Cyclops, a Bee lady, a
humanoid kitty, and Downtown's leader who resembles a
Satyr.  And, there's also a familiar looking,
overactive, orange-colored simian.
What the movie tries to become at this point, I think,
is a clever take on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  With the
multiple personalities that make up Stu now split into
two (one is the libidinous Monkeybone, the other is
plain vanilla Stu), perhaps he can come to terms with
some of his unresolved issues.  
Rather than being dramatic, however, the film wants to
be funny and strange.  But Monkeybone's vituperative
chatter becomes a nuisance.  Meanwhile, director Henry
Selick (who gave us "The Nightmare before Christmas"
and "James and the Giant Peach") goes for the gusto in
terms of bizarre presentation.  The world that he has
created looks great, but he seems to have forgotten
that the characters need to mean something too.  Case
in point: Stu receives help from an unlikely source,
but the reasoning for that is never convincing.
Midway through the film, "Monkeybone" becomes too
clever for its own good.  It introduces a conspiracy,
a plot that threatens the happiness of those in the
land of the living, and a bizarre showdown between
Stu's now-separated two personalities.  That's just
too much for this 88-minute film.  But, I am happy to
say that I hadn't laughed harder this year as I did
during its final 15 minutes.  This is thanks to
Saturday Night Live cast veteran Chris Kattan, whose
body is borrowed by Stu who has returned to the land
of the living to warn Julie about the conspiracy. 
Kattan's body is dead, decomposing with a broken neck.
 Watching him run across town is downright funny.
But, that kind of manic energy was just unsustainable.
  In part, Fraser seems a bit lost and out of place
(he was much better in "Bedazzled").  Also, the film
never lets us internalize Stu's plight because there
is just too much going on.  "Monkeybone" may be the
cleverest movie to come out so far in 2001.  It was
innovative in its look and offered numerous
interesting ideas.  But the film never really takes
off.  I really wanted to like this film more.

Review for Kiss of the Dragon (2001)
A friend of mine who recently visited France remarked
that the people there lacked a sense of humor.  But
how could that be?  After watching this film, how can
you NOT laugh at the French police force, which
appears to be the most inept law enforcement agency in
all of Europe?  Their bumbling methods make it seem as
if they all graduated with top honors from Inspector
Clouseau's Academy for the Dimwitted.
In "Kiss of the Dragon," however, the intent is not to
elicit laughter.  And that's too bad because there are
oodles of opportunities to make this a really fun
film.  Just think of all the wacky situations that our
hero, Jet Li, could have found himself in.  He plays
Johnny, an operative from Beijing sent to Paris to
help the local police crack an important case. 
Diminutive, unable to speak the language, and
unaccustomed to their way of police work, it makes you
wonder how these two governments could even agree to
such an arrangement.   Meanwhile, Johnny is humbly
reserved, but while in Paris, stays with a colleague
who makes his hideaway in a seedy, prostitute-infested
area.  Here is the perfect 'fish-out-of-water' set up.
 But the film's tone opts for moody atmosphere rather
than lighthearted earnestness.
Any laughter that occurs is more the result of the
absurdity of the on-screen action.  For example, every
time Jet Li dispatches a thug, there's another taller
and more muscular thug in the background that steps up
to attack.  He fells opponents in a variety of wild
ways such as by ramming a pair of chopsticks into the
throat.  My favorite scene, though, was when he
executed a balletic scissors kick that propelled a
pool ball across the room and into the forehead of a
surprised bad guy.  "Yeah, right!" we say to ourselves
under our breath.  It's a strange juxtaposition of
silliness and violence.   Alas, the one thing that Jet
Li really needs in his arsenal of lightning-speed
punches, roundhouse kicks, and weapons mastery is an
ability to give a beaming smile.  Yes, this film
desperately needs to strip away its stoicism and find
a sense of humor.  
But for those of you who just want to see Jet Li kick
butt, you won't be disappointed.  The plot provides a
string of sequences that showcases Li's athleticism
and martial arts skills, which are quite impressive. 
And he'll need every ounce of luck and skill to stay
alive after a corrupt French inspector (Tcheky Karyo)
frames him for the murder.  
Our villainous inspector is another absurd element
that will make you roll your eyes.  We don't so much
mind his cold-blooded nature, but it's hard to believe
his irritatingly odious demeanor and his incessant
snarling in that gravelly French accent.  Perhaps the
feedback levels of the boom mike were a bit out of
whack.
Our lithe hero manages to escape all of the
Inspector's attempts at capturing him even when he is
pursued through sewer drains by SWAT teams, seemingly
trapped on a boat, or surrounded in a dojo facility
with 3 dozen black belts.  Yes, some of this absurdity
becomes entertaining at some point.  And, when Li
decides to stop running and to take matter into his
own hands by infiltrating the Inspector's police
station, this sequence is kind of fun.  Yet, it's too
bad that Li never smiles. This film would have been
more enjoyable if we thought that he was having fun
too.

Review for 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)
1. Anybody who is familiar with some of Shakespeare's work is probably
familiar with Taming of the Shrew.  `10 Things' is a lighthearted
adaptation of the Bard's tale about a younger sister who yearns to go
out but is forbidden unless her craggy and highly opinionated sister
first dates.  In this film, the two siblings are Bianca, a wholesome
girl with a tender smile and Cat, a cute but spiteful witch who
instills fear in a majority of the guys at their high school.
2. This movie begins unpromisingly as we are introduced to the various
high school cliques consisting of white Ziggy Marley fanatics who talk
with Jamaican accents, future ivy-leaguers who seem like grandsons of
Thurston Howell III, and even cowboys who are shown twirling their
lariats.  Satirizing cliques is perfectly fine; however, these are
included as mere sight gags, and the movie seems to have ample
opportunity to reintroduce these cliques into even funnier scenes, but
they just sort of vanish.
3. Even the faculty is no less odd including Guidance Counselor Ms.
Perky, who spends her time writing erotic fiction and Mr. Gordon who is
a black teacher that raps Shakespeare sonnets.  I'm not sure whether
the great Bard would have been more shocked by his raps (which do have
a smoothness to them) or knowing that they made this movie based on one
of his tales.
4. We meet up with Cameron is a likable yet vapid sort of guy who is
taken by Bianca's beauty.  He has to overcome two formidable obstacles.
 One is that she can't go out unless Cat also begins to date.  The
other obstacle is the vain, Chachi-look-alike (from Happy Days) student
that also wants to go out with her.
5. To get Cat to go out, they secure the services of Michael, the
school desperado, who probably has what it takes to tame her. 
Inevitably, he will fall for his prey and she will do the same.  It is
also inevitable that she'll realize that she was the product of a wager
and that there will be 10 minutes of film time while she ponders
intensively before she forgives and forgets.
6. Cat is actually very well-spoken.  In fact, for sophomores in high
school, some of the dialogue is incredibly grown up.  They seemed
extremely savvy about life and love.  Yet, despite their verve, nothing
of any importance really gets said.  How odd.
7. I can't say that I really liked anything about this movie.  However,
I can't really say that I disliked it either since it is about kids in
high school trying to find love, and let's face itwe didn't really
know all that much when we were in high school either.  But here's a
sweet moment that stood out.  Michael, to get Cat's attention, bribes
that school marching band to play while he serenades her over the PA
system.  Nice touch, but everything else was just ho-hum high school
silliness.
8. What was a shame was that some of these kids show real promise, but
it's hard to break out of the gravitational grip of a high school
comedy.  They will eventually graduate to bigger and better things.
9. Thinking about it more, I believe that I just tend to view high
school romance genres with a sort of detachment.  It seems as if so
many have come out recently (Can't Hardly Wait and She's All That, just
to name a few), that it's like watching the same movie over and over
again.  So, it's not that this movie is bad.  It's just that it's too
bad that so many of these films have come out.
10. The lowdown is this.  `10 Things' starts off as silly fare, but
there are some subtly charming moments, and for the most part, it's
relatively painless fluff.


Title
Review for Entrapment (1999)
In a recent article in PEOPLE magazine, the topic highlighted the
growing but strange trend that more and more films have seasoned
leading actors who are paired with much younger female co-stars.  They
mentioned Harrison Ford and Anne Heche in the summer fluff "Six Days
and Seven Nights" as well as Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow in the
sometimes-chilling "A Perfect Murder."  What would be the draw of a
film featuring a couple where one is twice as old as the other?  Can't
they find similarly talented and similarly aged actors?  That is not to
say that Douglas and Ford are not great leading men.  What girl
wouldn't fall for them?  It also goes without saying that the venerable
Sean Connery (playing an accomplished thief named MacDougal) possesses
an undeniable charm and sophistication.  However, when I see this, in
the back of my mind I feel that Hollywood is just trying to force two
individually good actors into a movie so that it can sell tickets.  But
the drawback of this kind of pairing is that it's hard to find (or
accept) chemistry between two such disparately aged people. 
Immediately, my defenses go up knowing that this will become more of a
distraction rather than a plus.   
What is a plus for this film, however, is it's glossy production of two
skillful thieves.  MacDougal is one of them.  His skills have caught
the attention of insurance agent Jinn (the curvaceous Catherine
Zeta-Jones).  Her specialty is art, and she convinces her boss that he
is responsible for the recent theft of a Rembrandt painting in order to
get the okay to find him.  But, it takes a thief to catch a thief and
she embarks on a trip to track him down with her own secret agenda. 
The result is an uneasy partnership ("first we try, then we trust,"
they say to one another) with the ultimate goal of first stealing a
heavily guarded ancient Chinese mask inside a fortress of a museum and
then one final caper to a bank computer installation where they will
attempt to download enough money to rival the Gross Domestic Product of
a small country.
The best parts of the film are watching these two commit
near-impossible robberies.  All of these sequences are well executed,
hold-your-breath, nail biters.  They use incredibly sophisticated
devices to scale down the side of a skyscraper, to disarm alarms, or to
enter well-guarded strongholds.  To prepare for one of their jobs,
which involves maneuvering through a room full of infrared beams, they
practice by creating a mock-up of the room with yarn used to simulate
the laser beams.  In another sequence, they force their way through a
heavy marble floor, timing their entry to the chimes of Big Ben, which
will drown out their sound.  It's all very neat stuff.  Locales are
also beautiful, which enhances the look of the film.  Despite these
zippy scenes, the romantic aspect between these two thieves seemed
awkward and begins to bog the film down.  As individual thieves, they
are something to behold.  As a couple, they lack energy and excitement.
 And that's too bad, because this film is actually a fairly slick
production with some fine sequences.

Review for Patriot, The (2000)
"The Patriot," a powerful and impressive looking
period piece set during the American Revolution, tells
the story of a family being torn apart by war and a
father torn between duty to his family and duty to his
country.  Full of stirring moments, it is a sweeping
saga that showcases beautifully filmed and brilliantly
choreographed battles, a patriotic soundtrack that
combines the reverie of fife and drums with majestic
orchestrations, and utterly unbridled flag-waving
jingoism.  I can barely contain my enthusiasm and am
saluting as I write this.
In 1776, the American colonists have come to a
critical juncture.  Fed up with British rule,
revolutionaries charge that "if principles dictate
independence, then war is the only way."  However,
countless lives will be lost, though the sacrifice in
the name of freedom is worthwhile.  Benjamin Martin
(Mel Gibson) hopes that instead of voting for war,
America might adopt a more diplomatic course of
action.  Benjamin was once a brilliant military
tactician and warrior, but is now the loving parent of
seven.  He doesn't wish to leave them fatherless.  "I
am a parent," he says.  "I don't have the luxury of
principles."
Although Benjamin remains adamant about his pacifist
stance, his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) is
compelled by the crusade.  Against his father's
wishes, he enlists, grateful to serve the cause of
liberty.  But he is horrified to see the
disorganization of the American army.  The Red Coats
are an impressive force who marches into battle with
an imposing cadence.  Going muzzle-to-muzzle against
them in an open field is madness.  The American front
lines continually collapse, leading to swift defeats. 
General Cornwallis of the British Army states, "those
rustics are so inept that it takes the honor out of
victory."
Eventually, the battle winds up right on Benjamin's
front lawn.  His political stance is shattered when he
encounters the ruthless Colonel Tavington (Jason
Isaacs).  Gabriel is captured; their plantation home
is burned to the ground.  Tavington doesn't abide by
the rules of war and displays a brutality that is
horrifying.  He shoots innocent children, mercilessly
kills prisoners-of-war, and even locks dozens of
people inside a church and then instructs his men to
burn it down.  This is the kind of villain that
elicits boos from the audience.  It's impossible not
to hate him, and the audience will not find
satisfaction unless he dies by the hand of Benjamin.
We increasingly cheer for our
pacifist-turned-revolutionary hero, as he becomes
something of a colonial Robin Hood.  Recruiting men
throughout the countryside, he employs guerrilla
tactics and mounts a series of successful skirmishes. 
In addition to his superb military skills, he is also
adept at humiliating the enemy.  We find much levity
in watching him make a mockery of General Cornwallis. 
Yet like the American army, who is outmanned and
outmatched, so too is Benjamin.  As the battle wears
on, personal losses begin to mount.  
However, the colonists' and Benjamin's fighting spirit
never dies.  Even in the darkest of moments, there is
time for a miraculous turnaround.  This leads to a
final, glorious engagement between the
Colonial/British forces and between Benjamin Martin
and Colonel Tavington.  An American victory may turn
the tide of war.  And for our hero, payback may be
close at hand.  This sequence, with flying
cannonballs, thousands of soldiers fighting, and its
swings in momentum are nothing less than riveting.
"The Patriot" packs as much raw power and energy as
any fireworks display and is certainly one of the best
films of the year.  Gibson gives a compelling
Oscar-worthy performance full of passion, courage and
strength.  As far as summer movies go, this film is as
good as it gets, featuring bold emotions, an epic
storyline, incredibly visualized battle sequences and
a monumental dramatic arc.  To miss this film would be
an act of treason.

Title
Review for Election (1999)
Smart movies are getting harder to come by.  Smart movies that are
entertaining are even tougher to find.  Give us a good story, honesty
within the script, and a good cast, and you've got yourself a movie
that'll go to the head of the class.  So before the summer session
begins, enroll yourself in what might be one of the hidden gems of this
movie year.  It's called "Election", and you won't find a smarter film
this month.
`Election' takes a unique look at life in high school.  It forwards the
notion that at that tender time of adolescence, everyone's primary goal
in life is to do something that will benefit themselves.  All others
are just obstacles to be stepped on.  Specifically, it centers on a
student body President race, and the three final contenders span the
gamut of personality types from zealous overachiever to popular jock to
irreverent lesbian.   The presidency is a tool that each one can use to
further their goals.  This story is also about frumpish
three-time-Teacher-of-the-Year Mr. McAllistar (Mathew Broderick). He
cares about each student, imparts sage advice whenever he can, and is
as much a part of high school life as study hall, detention and pep
rallies.  He oversees the student body election, but despite his
general hands-off disposition, certain circumstances cause him to take
more of an interest in who wins.  
Above all, he wants to stop Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) from
achieving the greatness that she is destined to achieve.  Partially,
it's because she had an affair with one of his colleagues.  But mostly,
there is just something intolerable about the Tracy Flicks of the
world.  She is always the first to raise her hand in class and always
volunteers time for every club.  On the outside, she is a prim, perky
angel.  But on the inside, there broods a vindictive jezebel and
merciless competitor.  In her bid, she spends late nights stamping out
`Pick Flick' pins and prepares 500 cupcakes on the morning of the
election.  McAllistar hates her with a passion yet also lusts for her. 
His solution is to convince Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against
her, who can leverage his reputation as the popular jock who's
handsome, rich (thanks to his father), and well-liked.  When Tracy
learns of Paul's entry into the presidential race, she projects a cold
look of disdain that could send shivers up your spine.
Within the high school genre lies an untapped lode of great stories and
varied personalities.  Here, we aptly see that it's a vacuum of
'me-centered' people who do what they can to survive.  I still remember
the trials and tribulations of high school as if it were only
yesterday.  The student body was like a rich tapestry full of color,
surprises, and confusion.  `Election" is a strikingly refreshing story
that satirizes the culture of high school and gives us a production
that is unique, original, and honest.  There are no corny love stories,
no sign of students who looked like 20 something models, no goofy
cliques, no bets on who could win the heart of a girl, and no climactic
scenes that always seems to take place at a wild house party or at the
prom.  If only high school students were as smart as this movie, we'd
all graduate to bigger and better things.


Title
Review for Blue Streak (1999)
If you've seen "Beverly Hills Cop" or "Lethal Weapon"
or any of a dozen other cop/buddy/comedy movies, then
you probably know that all of these films follow a
very similar recipe:
Add 1 overzealous and reckless character that doesn't
quite fit in;
Add 1 subdued or perpetually naive partner;
Make sure one person is black and the other white;
Include at least two scenes of cars traveling
death-defyingly fast;
Liberally sprinkle bullets during the finale; and
Voila!
"Blue Streak" does not veer from this recipe, but
despite the cookie-cutter plot, what really makes or
breaks these kinds of movies for me is the energy
level of the main character.  And surprisingly (I say
surprisingly because I had low expectations for this
film), Martin Lawrence shows that he has the charisma
and the vigor to keep this movie breezing along.  
Lawrence actually isn't a police officer in this film.
 Well, not at first anyway.  He's Miles Logan, who is
quite an accomplished thief.  With his team of fellow
thieves and a plethora of high-tech equipment, he
easily enters the most secure buildings while
bypassing the most sophisticated alarm systems.  The
film's beginning is a fairly well-executed sequence
where Logan scurries his way into a building with the
ultimate goal of stealing a $17 million diamond.  By
disabling a key security monitor, stealthily hiding
behind furniture, and utilizing an array of thieving
tools that could probably also defuse a nuclear
warhead, he successfully captures his prize.  But his
jubilation will be short-lived.  Police have arrived
and the driver of the getaway car has sped off. 
Meanwhile, one of his men, Deke (                     
       ),  turns on him.  He wants the diamond for
himself.  Logan manages to barely escape from Deke to
a nearby construction site.  But the police are
closing in.  He quickly hides the diamond inside of an
air conditioning duct before being arrested.
Two years elapse, and when he's finally released from
prison, he revisits the site of his precious diamond. 
Unfortunately, he learns that the new building houses
the Los Angeles Police Department.  Security is tight
and the place is teeming with officers.  There's no
way for him to just stroll in and to start crawling
through the ventilation system.  His plan is simple. 
Steal a security access pass; forge identification;
and walk on in and retrieve the jewel.  Well, two out
of three ain't bad.  Unfortunately, he is mistaken for
a new transfer and is immediately dispatched on a
case.  To make matters worse, he is paired with a
rookie partner (an affable Luke Wilson) who always
drives the speed limit and stops when the traffic
light changes yellow.
Logan will have to solve the case his own way, using
his acquired street smarts and thieving background, in
order to speed his return back to the police
department.  He does impressively well as a man of the
law, and his unorthodox manner and tactics draw praise
from his colleagues.  But this attention can only
endanger his true identity.  Meanwhile, he is given
more dangerous assignments and by now, Deke has
reappeared to track Logan down for the diamond.  "Blue
Streak" may not break any new ground, but I was
pleasantly surprised at how well the movie held
together.  This is one of those rare times where the
actual film is much better than the previews had led
me to believe.  I also enjoyed Lawrence's performance
who is likeably glib.  The movie moves along at a
brisk pace and despite Lawrence's reputation as a
sometimes-crass comic, the film is appropriately rated
PG-13 for some mild gunplay.  With so many mediocre
thrillers and dramas in the theatres, this film makes
a fine Saturday afternoon choice.

Title
Review for Go (1999)
It's 3AM.  Do you know where your children are?  Well-hidden and tucked
beneath the cosmopolitan Los Angeles landscape exists a breed of
youngsters who do what they can to scrape by for their survival.  They
roam within deteriorating communities awash in the neon lights of porn
shops and the blue and red blinking lights of passing police cars.  For
some, like Ronna and Claire, they are underpaid checkout girls at the
local supermarket within their much-in-need-of beautification
neighborhood.  Their friend includes Simon, who is a small time drug
dealer.  Their hardened childhoods have made them street smart,
resourceful, and desperate.  Kids like this don't think, they just do. 
They just go.
`Go' is an off-centered comedy that employs quirky sex and violence in
an environment filled with drugs, rave dances, and strange
conversations about pop culture.   There are three scenarios that
illustrate how a simple decision puts them on a path that will cause
their already unfocused lives to spin further out of control.  The
first one focuses on Ronna (Sarah Polley).  She is facing eviction, and
unless she can generate rent money in a night, she'll be thrown out. 
Her plan involves Simon's drug distributor.  But she can't anticipate
the situation that she's walking into.  Her situation is made worse by
her accomplice who is tripping out on a powerful hallucinogen during
the height of the problem.
The second story features Simon, who is a young, brash, and libidinous
teenager on his first trip to Las Vegas.  His wide-eyed curiosity is
bound to get him into a lot of trouble.  For example, accompanied by
his friend to a topless bar, he is warned not to get a bottle of
champagne (a very expensive invitation for a private lap dance), which
he naturally does.  Their situation also spins out of control, and as
they make their escape, another friend being filled in on the details
exclaims, `you mean you stole a car, shot a bouncer and had sex with
two girls at the same time?'  There's another story that focuses on two
men.  Their vignette revolves around elements of gayness and a humorous
poke at the multi-level marketing structure of Amway, but their
inclusion into the overall story line is to show that even responsible
adults can get themselves into bizarre situations where their may be no
way out.  
The film's structure involves an interlocking timeline, where we
revisit certain scenes more than once.  When we do, we'll be revisiting
the same time period through the eyes of a different person.  All of
these varied stories cleverly converge.  This is certainly a
well-structured movie.  I liked the depiction of the drug euphoria,
which was like being underwater where sights and sounds are severely
distorted.  I'm not condoning drug use, but did enjoy the stylish
visualization, depicted as a wild Macarena-like sequence in the produce
section of a supermarket and a telepathic cat.   There are many offbeat
characters that lend energy to this film.  I also liked how these kids'
lives were symbolized and the general atmosphere of the film.  When the
frenzied activities of the previous night finally ends, the next thing
that they want to is only as clear as the cover of the morning fog. 
But these kids are scrappy, and they'll find a way to survive.

Review for Godzilla (1998)
If you think that a nuclear test ban treaty would be in the best
interest of everyone, then you would be correct in supporting it.
Indeed Godzilla is a creation, or mutation if you will, that is a direct
result from too much testing.  The radiation fallout somehow mutates the
DNA of certain creatures which produce odd side effects.  Abnormal
growth is one of those effects, as explained by Dr. Nick Tatopoulos
(Matthew Broderick), a specialist studying the effects of nuclear
fallout on animals.  Tatopoulos is brought to the Caribbean where large
lizard-like footprints were discovered.  "Was I just standing in a
footprint," he asks incredulously.  There is more unbelievable evidence.
An ocean vessel has run aground.  It appears to have been torn apart,
gigantic claw marks can be seen along the exterior of the ship, and a
traumatized survivor blurts out something to the doctors that sound like
"gaw-chill-ah".
Our anticipation grows.  We want to see what we're paying for.  Finally,
the overgrown reptile makes itself known by entering Manhattan.  He is
an impressive beast.  Cars get squashed, buildings crumble, and the
surprised citizens run for their lives.  The military and Tatopoulos
hurry and set up a command post, and they begin to develop a plan to
attack it.  Tatopoulos is also reunited with old college crush Audrey
(Maria Pitillo).  She left him long ago, but still feels something for
the quiet scientist.  As a reporter wannabee, her career is presently
going nowhere, and she sees this as an opportunity for her big story. 
Tatopoulos does make a scary discovery, learning that Godzilla has come
to NYC to nest.  A new species is being born, and if they don't act
fast, New Yorkers will become food for the scores of reptilian offspring
that are close to hatching.  Time is running out.  The military can not
find Godzilla.  Tatopoulos can not find the nest.  And the audience can
not find a story.
The problem with Godzilla is that it is a 30-minute effects extravaganza
stretched out into a 2-hour movie.  There's a feeling of ineptness that
wafts through the movie.  Military might can't bring down the creature.
Useless politicians look on in dismay.  The citizens want to return back
to the city despite that fact that baby Godzillas are looking for food
and that practically every building is in need of some major repairs.
Meanwhile,  Broderick's and Patillo's characters are so vapid that we
become more interested in the secondary characters, such as Animal (Hank
Azaria) who throws common sense to the wind in order to get exclusive
video footage and Phillipe Roche (Jean Reno), a mysterious character
whose purpose is kept a secret until the last 30 minutes.  But that's
not to say that Godzilla isn't visually spectacular.  Army helicopters
chase Godzilla through the city streets.  They fire their weapons, which
manages to destroy everything except the 50-foot nuisance.  Submarines
can't even catch him.  And the best sequence comes at the end of the
movie when Godzilla chases the scientist and his friends who are fleeing
through the city in a taxi.  Nuclear or atomic testing may have resulted
in Godzilla, but I would suspect that significant movie audience testing
would have never yielded the same mistake.

Title
Review for Deep Blue Sea (1999)
DBS is a film that follows a formulaic storytelling mechanism that is
as familiar to us as the smell of buttered popcorn.  And if you've ever
seen any of the `Alien' movies, then in many ways, you've already seen
this film.  The similarities between these films are as abundant as the
gory shark attacks that are peppered throughout this film.  In `Alien',
the setting is a remote research station somewhere in space.  Here, the
setting is a research station somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.  In
`Alien' a band of humans must survive to escape an infestation of
oozing, flesh-eating creatures.  Here, a band of humans must survive to
escape several very, very large sharks on the loose.  But these are no
ordinary sharks.  These predators are 25 feet long, and their brains
have been altered in a way as to make them amazingly intelligent,
agile, and menacing.
The research station is headed by Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron
Burrows), a passionate scientist on the verge of a discovery that could
change the face of medicine.  As humans age, brain activity slows down
considerably.  As a result many suffer greatly from degenerative
diseases, such as Alzheimer's.  Yet sharks, for some reason, never
suffer from these effects.  Their brains remain fully functional
throughout their life span.  Her project is to find a way to extract
the protein within the shark's brain responsible for this effect so
that humans can take advantage of these benefits too  sort of a super
gingko biloba.  But she faces some overwhelming obstacles.  Funding has
been cut which forces her to take shortcuts and to overlook safety
precautions.  Meanwhile, to extract enough protein, the sharks' brains
have been genetically altered.  The side effect is that it makes them
more ferocious and smarter.  And did I mention that these beasts are 25
feet long?  It's a recipe for disaster, and when the sharks eventually
grow smart enough to fight back, the woeful few crew members on this
isolated research station will become nothing more than feeder fish. 
I think that when looking at a movie such as this, there are two
components that will determine whether something like this can be
recommended or not.  One is whether we like the hapless souls fighting
to stay alive.  And for the most part, I liked the quirky cast of
characters, especially the macho shark wrangler (Thomas Jane) and a
delightful bible-quoting cook (LL Cool J).  The shark wrangler is
well-suited to stay alive, but his crazy heroics may get him killed. 
Meanwhile, when a shark enters the cook's partially flooded kitchen, he
tries to hide in his own oven.  But the shark is smart enough to set
the oven to 400 degrees.  Perhaps, this shark prefers his dinner
cooked.  To be sure, many will meet an untimely and unexpected horrible
end.  But these are two characters that I cared for and wanted to see
survive.  The other component, of course, is the action sequences. 
And, for the most part, they are all well done.  They involve the
familiar scenes where fierce creatures are chasing after humans through
narrow passageways while the whole compound around them is slowly about
to self-destruct.  Meanwhile, the characters all do their best to
escape from the jaws of death, do what they can to improvise their way
out of seemingly hopeless situations, and work together to make it to
freedom.


Title
Review for Misérables, Les (1998)
Is moral reform merely a deluded fantasy as Inspector Javert (Geoffrey
Rush) believes?  Do our actions forge an irreversible path towards a
predetermined destination or are we capable of retracing our path,
mending our ways and turning over a new leaf?  
As the film opens, we are introduced to Valjean (Liam Neeson), a convict
who has served 19 years of hard labor in a quarry for stealing.  Dressed
in rags and ready to faint from weakness, a gracious man of the cloth
allows him to stay the night and feeds him.  But despite this act of
kindness, Valjean still finds this to be an opportunity to steal.  And
though he is caught, the man of the cloth lets Valjean go.  "I've
ransomed you from fear and hatred and I give you back to God," he says,
urging him to become a new man.  A decade passes by, and when we see
Valjean again, he has transformed himself into a well-respected
businessman, a beloved citizen and the Mayor of the economically
prosperous town of Vigo.  His new-found status, however, will be
shattered when the town receives it's newest member of the police force,
Inspector Javert.
Javert was a guard during Valjean's time in the quarry, and vaguely
recognizes him.  His own brand of scruples compels him to denounce the
Mayor as a convict, even though he lacks proof.  But in his heart, he
believes that putting a former convict in a position of authority
undermines the public trust.  Wait until he meets DC's Marion Barry.
But we see many examples of Valjean's turnaround.  The most poignant
centers around factory worker Fantine (Uma Thurman) who gets fired for
having a child out of wedlock.  Needing money for her daughter's
medicine, she turns to prostitution.  After being ruthlessly tormented
by pedestrians and arrested by Javert, Valjean intercedes and begins to
take care of her.  Thurman's performance is especially sympathetic and
strong.  Valjean eventually flees to Paris, taking refuge in a convent
that he helped to establish.  Valjean also raises Fantine's daughter,
Cossette (later played by Claire Danes).  Years pass by, and now having
grown up, the virginal Cossette falls in love with a fiery radical under
the watch of police, which once again brings Javert to Valjean's
doorstep.  Valjean just wants be left alone, but throughout the film,
Javert unyieldingly pursues his personal vendetta.
What struck me as odd, however, was the lack of passion displayed by the
Inspector.  His conviction was unquestionable and he presented his
points clearly and crisply, but Javert always seemed to speak in a
monotone.  The cinematography was also somewhat uneven.  There were
great shots of the lush landscape and a breathtaking shot of a parade
that would mark the beginning of the revolution, but the smaller street
sets where the fighting took place looked nothing more than sets on a
stage.   As a period piece, it did only marginally well to transport me
to a different place and time.  Several other shots seemed too dimly
lit, and the movie's ending seemed somewhat abrupt.  
But the heart of this story is about sin and redemption, law and
justice.  Neeson and Rush emote the right stuff.  Neeson is good at
conveying the difficulty of sacrifice in light of his new-found moral
obligation.  Rush delivers a strong performance as the cynical officer
that must follow the law to the letter at the expense of his own
humanity.  The motivations of Valjean and Javert are clearly presented,
and we know that Javert will never cease pursuit even though Valjean has
had several opportunities to end the chase.  We understand and are
sympathetic to Valjean's plight.  All contribute commanding performances
and confidently steer the movie to its conclusion.  Les Miserables
deserves to be looked at, if not for its finely crafted presentation, at
least for its finely tuned performances.

Title
Review for Get Carter (2000)
"My name is Jack Carter, and you don't want to know
me" says our brooding anti-hero (Sylvester Stallone). 
Take his advice!  To know this guy is as rewarding as
being thrown over a terrace.  And to watch this film
is almost as painful.  "Get Carter" is a gloomy
looking, unimaginative film that offers no joy.
Jack Carter is as tough as tough guys come.  He works
out of Vegas as a self-described 'financial adjuster'.
 Explaining his duties, he says, "people make promises
and break them.  I help them remember."  He has a
chiseled body full of tattoos.  He has the weathered
look indicative of a man who has seen his share of
hard times.  He speaks in a hushed but menacing tone
of voice.  In other words, this is Sylvester Stallone
acting like...Sylvester Stallone.  And like most of
his previous roles, his character is a shallow,
one-dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk
tough, hassle a few hapless people, find out what he
needs to know, and then dispense his own kind of
justice.  With the charisma of a pit bull, being tough
is all that Jack Carter knows.  
Yet, even tough guys know when to put family first. 
As the story begins, we learn that Jack's little
brother has died in a car accident.  The police
attribute it to heavy drinking.  However, Jack is
suspicious, believing that he was 'taken out'.  He
takes a break from his Vegas duties and tries to see
if he can find the truth.  As he pokes around, he runs
into several lowlife characters.  They include a shady
business partner, a prostitute, a dweebish millionaire
molded after Bill Gates, and an oily owner of a porn
website.  
Any one of them may know something about his brother's
death.  All of them have the means of carrying out the
deed.  But don't expect an exercise in sleuthing where
well-placed clues lead Carter to the truth.  He's all
brawn and no brains, so there are no epiphanies during
his investigation.  Instead, he uses intimidation to
muscle his way forward, cycling through this circle of
suspects.  Flustered with his lack of progress, he
cycles through them again and again.  This all gets
tiring fairly quickly.  By the time the film launches
into its final act, we're numb from its pedestrian
pace.
Oddly, as a tough-guy thriller, it starves us for
action.  Admittedly, there is one nifty chase
sequence, but this is related to a tangential and
needless plot (Carter's Vegas ties send thugs to
retrieve him).  The story also fails to generate any
kind of emotion.  Stallone has the personality of a
slab of stone.  And the look and feel of the film is
perpetually downcast.  The weather is constantly
overcast or rainy.  Meanwhile, most shots take place
at night, in dimly lit rooms, or in dark alleys.  It's
just impossible to get stirred about that kind of
atmosphere.  As a result, "Get Carter" amounts to
nothing more than a flat thriller, bereft of clever
moments and devoid of any excitement.  You're better
off leaving this guy alone.

Title
Review for Bowfinger (1999)
Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) is perhaps the perfect example of the
little guy in Hollywood that is so desperate to see his name up in
lights.  He's a small-time director (very small) who has yet to taste
the sweet nectar of show biz success.   His surroundings and his
lifestyle are meager.   He drives a beat-up van, wears outdated plaid
jackets, and dilutes already-cheap wine with water to make it last
longer.  Yet, despite a long string of failures, his ambition remains
undeniably strong.  He convinces himself that success is just around
the corner.  He promises his friends that they'll all have their shot
at stardom.  He dreams about the day when shiny Federal Express trucks
will come to his door delivering hot, new scripts from the big studios.
Not surprisingly, many of Bowfinger's friends are also waiting for that
rare chance to make it in Hollywood.   His Iranian accountant longs to
be a scriptwriter.  His friend, Dave, continues to do odd favors for
him because Bowfinger is as close as he'll ever get to fame.  And his
leading lady has been promised time and time again to wait just a
little bit longer until the right project comes along.  Finally, the
chance to put them on the map happens.  The project is called `Chubby
Rain', a sci-fi drama about aliens in raindrops, penned by his very own
accountant.  His friends are all too eager to be a part of this
project.  Anybody else that may be needed to operate the equipment will
be cheaply 'recruited'.  Bowfinger is on a tight budget, and the most
they can afford are illegal aliens fleeing across the Rio Grande.  He
also hires Daisy (Heather Graham), a girl with big dreams and a
willingness to sleep her way to the top.  The funny thing is that when
she signs on for this film, she had no idea just how near the bottom
she actually was.   
Writer Steve Martin clearly understands the inner desire that many
people have to become Hollywood players, the sacrifices that they are
willing to make, and the hopes that they desperately try to keep alive.
 It's almost bizarre as to just how much they want to make `Chubby
Rain' work.  But Martin also understands that fame can make stars
eccentric.  Take Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy).  He's the world's hottest
action star, and is needed to make this film work.  But Ramsey is very
manic, always telling himself to keep it together as he receives
counseling from a new age cult called the Mind Heads.  Kit is too busy,
too stressed, or too weird to take part in such a small project.
Bowfinger comes up with a terrific idea.  He tells his cast and crew
that Kit is an eccentric actor and doesn't want to meet any of them. 
His cast believes him because they are desperate to believe him.  In
the meantime, they set up secret cameras and shoot elaborate scenes. 
Actors walk up to Kit (not knowing that Kit is really not part of the
movie), Kit reacts with absurd paranoia (he can't understand why people
are approaching him and talking about aliens), and Bowfinger's amazing
juggling act may actually work! 
This is one of Martin's strongest effort in recent years.  `Bowfinger'
is good-natured and intelligent.  And considering the growing trend of
ribald comedies, this is a breath of fresh air.

Title
Review for Chocolat (2000)
Once upon a time in a little French village, a "sly
wind blew in from the north."  With it came a radiant
woman named Vianne (Juliette Binoche) who would
descend upon the sleepy hamlet.  Through her own
unique brand of wide-eyed optimism and a delectable
recipe for making savory chocolate candies, she would
instill a new sense of life into its soporific
citizens.  
Some, however, saw her as a threat to the village's
tranquility.   This place, lifted from the pages of a
fairy tale book, seems to have been untouched by the
passage of time.  And the morally staunch Mayor Compte
de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) wanted to make sure that
its sanctity would remain intact.  To him, she was a
Succubus who brought temptation.  Vianne would
politely decline to go to church although everyone
else in the village would attend.  She also opens up
her chocolate shop during Lent, creating an
uncomfortable challenge to the citizens as they pass
by.  The wonderfully decorated window display, filled
with her delightful array of confections, could easily
turn anybody's head.  Needless to say, the Mayor was
not pleased.
On the surface, "Chocolat" is a fairly sweet drama
about how Vianne struggles to gain acceptance in a
village that has trouble accepting outsiders.  But
beneath its sugarcoated surface, the story is a
parable about the forces of Christianity that battle
the forces of paganism.  
Here, Christianity and the Mayor are portrayed as
prudish concepts that extol discipline and reverence. 
The Mayor has a narrow view about how things should be
done.  He even goes so far as to edit all of the
sermons that are given in Church.  Of course, most of
the language has been altered to indirectly denounce
the presence of Vianne and her shop.  But his sermons
are no match for Vianne's mysterious chocolate
creations.  The town soon finds her shop to be
something of a clinic for their vapid souls.  There's
something magical about the cacao powder that she
uses.  But the movie never elaborates on whether she
is an evil priestess or whether she has some kind of
hidden agenda.  But it is clear that she does
represent paganism, from the lavish decorum in her
shop to her off-the-shoulder outfits to her status as
an unwed mother to her attraction with a raffish boat
captain (Johnny Depp).  Whatever great power she may
possess, she seems just fine dispensing advice along
with her chocolates.
As a result, good things begin to happen.  Many
villagers benefit from its effects in one way or
another.  Even the Mayor is affected.  But, the most
tender subplot involves the divide between a cranky
grandmother (Judi Dench) and her daughter (Carrie
Anne-Moss).  
Despite its allegorical references, the film opts to
be more of a whimsical fairy tale rather than an
ambitious piece of work.  The majority of the film,
for example, takes place in two or three locations
giving it the feel of an off-Broadway production. 
Meanwhile, most of the screentime is focused on
dialogue exchanged between Vianne and those that she
has touched.  Although the ensemble performance made
this movie enjoyable on its own sweet level, the drama
didn't nearly have the potency of Vianne's chocolates.
 Some of that magic was needed to make this a truly
memorable film.  


Title
Review for Hardball (2001)
If you see at least 10 movies a year and if you're the 
kind of moviegoer that likes to settle into your seat 
before the previews begin, you've probably seen 
trailers of Public Service Announcements.  Situated 
after unwelcome commercials but before film previews, 
you might have seen clips espousing the cause of the 
Will Rogers Institute, a charity race for some dreaded 
disease, or the warm segment in which a person 
standing in front of his broken down car in a 
torrential downpour is given an umbrella by a passing 
car.  "Courtesy," says the voice-over.  "Pass it on." 
One uplifting PSA is the one that features young 
adults who struggle to do something better with their 
lives despite the dark pressures of inner city life. 
With the tagline, "Opportunity, the anti-drug," it 
projects a spirit that is uplifting and hopeful.  The 
essence of that two-minute segment is captured in 
"Hardball," based on an early 90s memoir of coaching 
Little League baseball in Chicago's Cabrini-Green 
housing project.  The film is a surprisingly emotional 
and gritty melodrama about inner city youths and a 
down-and-out loser who hope to find a safe haven. 
The film quickly establishes a tone of despondency and 
desperation as we meet Conor (Keanu Reeves), an 
addicted gambler indebted to the wrong kinds of 
people.  His creditors don't charge interest; they 
just bash heads.  Looking as if he hadn't slept in a 
week, we see him praying in church.  A passing priest 
asks, "You looking for faith? Forgiveness?"  Conor 
solemnly replies, "I'm looking for the Bulls to cover 
the spread." 
In dire straits, he calls a long-time friend for help. 
 Conor is told that he'll get $500 a week in return 
for his services as a coach for a boy's baseball team 
in the projects.  With little choice in the matter, he 
grudgingly reports to the tattered field and meets his 
team.  Underprivileged, the kids lack tact, 
discipline, and brotherhood.  It'll take a miracle for 
them to jell.  
But baseball has a strange way of bringing everyone 
closer together.  And with the right coach and the 
right attitude, miracles can happen.  "New rule," 
demands Conor.  "No one can say anything bad about 
anyone else on the team." And with those words the 
kids begin to slowly develop a sense of camaraderie 
and a sense of unity.  The kids, all feisty yet 
adorable, see Conor as the father that they never had 
and baseball as their anti-drug.  Conor meanwhile 
slowly transforms from seedy hustler to a man who 
rediscovers his self-respect.  Reeves-as-Conor turns 
in one of his better dramatic performances (which even 
made me want to say his trademark line of "Whoa").   
While the baseball story is what the film swings for, 
it's the biting urban milieu that allows the film to 
go the distance.  Otherwise, it would be about as 
interesting as watching today's Bulls (without Jordan, 
Pippen, and Rodman).  When Conor escorts a team member 
back to his project apartment, for example, he is 
shocked to see everyone sitting on the floor.  His 
player matter-of-factly says, "no one wants to get hit 
by bullets."  The pall of inner city life may 
discourage them and tragedy may try to overtake them. 
But baseball and hope will always be their anti-drug.

Review for Shaft (2000)
When Detective Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) says, "don't
make me chase you," the bad guy better be able to
escape.  When Detective Shaft is involved in a shoot
out, the bad guy better not miss.  When Detective
Shaft is on a mission, you better stay out of his way.
 If you don't, he'll come at you with the fury of a
tornado.  He's a man to be reckoned with, and he'll do
whatever it takes to get things done.
Shaft will have to take matters into his own hands if
he is to find closure with his latest case, which
involves the death of a young, black man at a local
club.  Arrogantly confessing to the crime is Wade
(Christian Bale), son of a wealthy and well-respected
community member.  He gloats about what he did and
chuckles to Shaft that he'll be released on bail and
that nothing will ever happen to him.  Because no
witnesses will testify and Wade has squirrelly
lawyers, he easily posts bail and walks away.
Shaft is incensed.  He wonders how justice can be so
blind.  But he knows what to do.  He must find a
witness to the murder.  Using his unique brand of
sleuthing skills, which means invariably demanding
favors or threatening people, he is able to locate
Diane (Toni Collette).  She was a bartender at the
club that night who actually saw the crime take place.
 She has been silent, fearing that testifying against
such a powerful person would be extremely dangerous.  
Shaft promises to keep her safe, but when Wade finds
out about Diane's intentions, he wants to have her
permanently silenced.
"Shaft" (the man and the movie) is mostly about
attitude and style.  Jackson is very confident,
sporting a wicked goatee while clad in leather pants,
a leather overcoat, and sleek sunglasses.  The women
just love him ("it's my duty to please your booty," he
says to one of them).  He talks tough, walks tall, and
never let's you down.  Meanwhile, the film showcases
the nostalgic look and feel of a 70's film.  It has a
soundtrack unique to that era, features Richard
Roundtree (who was the original Shaft), and includes
Isaac Hayes (who sang the original) singing the
opening song.  
Yet, about two-thirds of the way into the film, the
glaze of the "Starsky & Hutch"-like soundtrack and
Shaft's penchant to insult and intimidate may begin to
bore you.  You discover that the film is spiritlessly
plotted and lacks a rewarding dramatic arc.   It also
becomes oddly chaotic as it approaches the final
climactic scenes.  New people seem to come out of
nowhere, and there is a very busy shoot out sequence
where dozens of bad guys are crammed into a small
apartment.  
There are heroes that use intelligence to best their
opponents and there are heroes that use weapons to
defeat their enemies.  But Detective Shaft (Samuel L.
Jackson) virtually taunts them into submission.  He
reminds us that fighting crime is a tough business,
and it requires an equally rugged individual to get
things done.  He stares down his opponents, spews
threats like a volcano spews lava, and takes matters
into his own hands when he thinks, for example, that a
pistol whipping might get the point across more
effectively.  This guy is one tough mutha.

Title
Review for Feiying gaiwak (1990)
Admittedly, it gets increasingly difficult to review films that star the   
ebullient Jackie Chan.  One film is just like another.  Fortunately, each   
film is as cutely entertaining as another.  Like all is films, he chops,   
socks, flips and somersaults with the greatest of ease.  His playfulness   
makes him very likable.  You can't help but laugh at the cheesiness of   
the dubbing; you can't help but stare in awe at the wonderfully   
choreographed fight scenes; you can't help but gasp in delight and   
amazement as he performs his own stunts.  In this movie, you get 90   
fun-filled minutes of cheesiness, awe and delight.
This latest Chan vehicle to hit the American landscape is basically a   
take-off of the Raiders of the Lost Ark genre.  Tons of gold, purloined   
by the Nazis during WWII, sits in a secret German base buried in the   
Sahara.  It's up to Jackie to find it.  Now, this is not a really   
creative story.  I mean, even Jackie Chan's character name isuhJackie.   
 But, Chan movies are not meant to have significant depth (or any for   
that matter).  Watch as scenes are seemingly incongruously edited   
together.  Watch mysterious bad guys appear out of nowhere and pop back   
up at the most awkward of moments. This is no masterpiece to be sure.   
 But it is the situations that Jackie finds himself in, and the   
incredibly amusing way in which he gets out that is the hallmark of these   
films.  Jackie is also accompanied on his quest by 3 different women.   
 All are attractive and have a minor purpose for their inclusion, but   
their roles amount to little more than fodder for more comedy and   
silliness.  And, there are the usual odd assortment of bandits, thugs (my   
favorite rarely-used word), nazis and mercenaries that all try to get   
Jackie.  My feeling is that when there are more people in his films, more   
fighting can happen.  After all, that is what we want to see.  That is   
what we've come to expect.  And, smartly, that is exactly what we get.
For those that have never scene the previous Chan releases (Rumble in the   
Bronx, Supercop, or First Strike), this is a unique movie-going   
experience, mainly because Chan is so different than the Van Dammes,   
Bruce Lees or Steven Segals.  Chan can fight with the best of them (if   
not better), but he wants you to laugh at him and with him too.  Like all   
of his other movies, Jackie is a 3-ring circus of entertainment.  In one   
ring, we can enjoy his boyish charm.  In another ring, we can see him at   
the center of some amazing action-sequences and martial arts encounter.   
 And in the 3rd ring, we can enjoy the humor that he injects to brighten   
anybody's spirit.  Chan is a trapeze artist, lion tamer and clown rolled   
into one.  In this case, Chan and his film can be enjoyed by ladies and   
gentlemen and children of all ages.

Review for Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)
How much you'll enjoy "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" will
depend on a couple of things.  If you are an avid fan
of the buxom, video heroine and just can't get enough
of straining your fingers by pressing those tiny
buttons on your Nintendo handset, then you won't be
disappointed.  "LC:TR" offers lots of elaborate
sequences that game players can only wish that they
could execute on their video consoles.  The most
impressive scene features our heroine utilizing a
bungee cord to fend off a group of armed mercenaries
(and if I was trying to do this on the game console,
sweet Lara would have died a thousand times at my
control).  Also neat is the singular motion she
executes to reload the ammunition clips of her twin,
semi-automatic pistols.  
Meanwhile, movie watchers who are enrapt with special
effects extravaganzas and big film budgets like "Pearl
Harbor" or "The Mummy Returns" ("LC:TR" reportedly
cost $100 million to make), will have their hunger for
eye candy satiated.  This is probably the most
handsome looking film thus far this year.  Whether
Lara is battling stone statues come-to-life, exploring
some lost city, or fleeing though jungle foliage, the
film pays a great amount of attention to atmosphere. 
For example, most scenes are bathed in a golden luster
to connote a world of power and wealth, while locales
of adventure are draped with a mysterious fogginess. 
The team behind the art direction, set design, and
special effects deserves much applause.
So far, so good.  But what if you don't fall into
either of those two categories and your taste demands
more?  As long as that taste is for hot, buttered
popcorn, then you'll be fine.  LC:TR is a good summer
film.  But it's not much more.  It features separate
and distinct acts, each featuring cool combat or some
other action sequence.  It doesn't overcomplicate us
with plot.  And it gives us a great heroine who is
lithe and athletic.  The goth Jolie portrays her well,
bringing an alluring dimension of seriousness and
sexuality.
Lara Croft is James Bond and Indiana Jones rolled into
one.  Born into wealth and groomed at the most elite
schools, she has an appetite for adventure.  She
travels to dangerous locales around the globe in
search of lost crypts and long-forgotten empires.  Her
greatest quest, however, challenges her to find two
halves of an ancient artifact buried in space and
time.  So with her thigh-high holsters, body-hugging
outfits, and the help of her butler and a weapons
designer, she travels from England to Italy to
Cambodia and a few lost cities in between.  Luckily,
its brisk pace, it's watchable heroine, and the film's
gorgeous look makes us forget about the video
game-like plot.
What Lara Croft really lacks, however, is a soul. 
There is a noticeable lack of humanity in this film. 
Perhaps Croft comes across as so invulnerable that it
didn't matter who wanted to kill her or how many
people were going to try or what it meant if Lara
should fail.  But as this was adapted from a video
game, you can arguably say that the film kept its
spirit intact.  Fans certainly won't be disappointed. 
All others may feel something lacking.

Title
Review for Waking Ned Devine (1998)
I suppose that when my best friend and I grow to be really old, I hope
that our relationship will mimic that of Jackie's (Ian Bannen) and
Michael's (David Kelly), two affable townspeople featured in a film
called `Waking Ned Devine.'  After many years on God's good green
Earth, these elderly friends still possess a healthy appetite for fun
and an undeniable boyish charm combined with patriarchal wisdom.  But
all that wisdom is about to fly out the window when something dramatic
happens to their small rural Irish hamlet of Tullymore with a
population of 52 people.  You see, there was only one winner in the
latest lottery drawing, and one lucky block in this town holds the
winning ticket.  Jackie and Michael want very much to share in a piece
of this prize and begin a cunning little search to find out who the
winner is.  Perhaps by showering a little generosity on them first,
the winner will reward them in kind.   And after an exhausting search,
they finally figure out on who they should focus their attention. 
Unfortunately, when they find the winner (Ned Devine), they see that
he has just passed away.  And if Ned himself doesn't claim the ticket,
the prize will not be disbursed.
Now Jackie and Michael spring into action (or at least move as fast as
two 70 year-olds can possibly move).  They devise a play where Michael
will assume the identity of Ned and claim the prize.  But there are
many obstacles that they have to overcome in order to pull it off. 
Most formidably, they'll have to convince the lottery officials to
hand over the check.  To do this, they'll need to dispose of the body;
figure out a way to memorize Ned's personal information (date of
birth, identification number, etc..), which is quite difficult for a
man whose memory is ailing; and get the townsfolk to buy in on the plan.
Although this kind of premise could have easily lent itself to being
some kind of silly slasher flick, what we actually get is a
light-hearted story about two amiable fellows who try to do what they
can to get the money.  It's a buddy movie where life-long friends,
with their limited abilities, do whatever they can to achieve a dream.
 But more than that, it's a quirky village comedy complete with it's
assortment of eccentrics and crazies.  Among Tullymore's population
resides Lizzy Quinn, who is a witchy hag that likes to spread gloom; a
substitute priest that tries to spread theology to a 9-year old boy
who may be smarter than the priest can handle; and a handsome pig
farmer who can't get the girl because of the way he smells.  These are
just some of the 52 people living in Tullymore whose lives will make
you grin from beginning to end.

Review for U.S. Marshals (1998)
As a psuedo-sequel to 1993's The Fugitive, we can see many elements in
this film that parallels its predecessor.  Tommy Lee Jones returns to
recap his role as the alpha-male US Marshal, Samuel Gerard.  He leads
his band of deputies through the most dangerous of situations, but
with his keen guidance, the group emerges unscathed and is successful
in capturing their quarry.  There is also an innocent man (Mark
Sheridan played by Welsey Snipes) claiming to have been falsely
accused who, after a slam-bang sequence, manages to escape while being
transported from one prison to another.  He then spends the rest of
the movie trying to prove his innocence while alluding capture.  But
also true to most sequels, this movie hardly compares to its original.
The main difference is that The Fugitive was adept at balancing a
rivalry that pitted a law enforcement machine against a humble man who
endeared us with his heart and deep sense of pathos.  Harrison Ford's
character really didn't have a chance of alluding the law, but we
wished deeply that he could in order to right what was wrong, and
miraculously, he did find a way to escape.   "Marshals", however, is
more of a traditional, action-oriented offering whose focus is on
Tommy Lee Jones.  His Gerard character is a natural leader, and with
his gravelly voice, he incessantly barks out orders to his team.
Never taking a moment's rest ("When can we get some sleep," asks his
deputy.  "Next month," he yells back.), he sternly imposes his
authority over those under his command, looking very impressive as he
handles the chaos that sweeps around him.  
Choas emerges for him in two forms.  One is that of Sheridan.  As an
escaped convict, Gerard must bring him in.  But Sheridan is extremely
resourceful and thanks to his mysterious background, he manages to
allude Gerard at every turn.  The other element that distracts Gerard
is a new team member assigned to him by the government (Agent John
Royce played by Robert Downey Jr.).  While Gerard prefers the
familiarity of his team, Royce has some special skills better suited
to capturing Sheridan.
Despite all this talent, "US Marshals" doesn't achieve any new
tension-filled heights.  While Sheridan is supposedly innocent,
Snipes, though likeable, can't quite evoke any sympathy for his
plight.  Snipes seems more comfortable as the aggressor rather than
the victim.  If you look deep into his eyes, he looks like a man that
would rather shoot you in the head rather than into your bulletproof
vest.  Downey's character, while an effective agent, doesn't really
add anything to the mix except to offer a mild surprise at the end.
And the story is needlessly complicated.  Because of Sheridan's
mysterious background, we are introduced to subplots that include a
government mole, spying, and the real reason why Sheridan is wanted.
But there are some nice sequences and an incredible escape when Snipes
traps himself atop a tall apartment building surrounded below by
police.  Meanwhile, Jones is right on the money, maintaining focus and
letting us enjoy his thought process when he takes the lead.  Overall,
this is a film that barely gives us enough to sustain our interest.
But what little we get is well-executed, and it's greatest plus is
that we get a lot of Tommy Lee Jones.  But without him, "US Marshals"
wouldn't be nearly as effective.

Title
Review for Dancer in the Dark (2000)
"In a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens," says
the wispy-voiced, diminutive Selma (played by
Icelandic diva, Bjork).  You can feel the pain that
occupies her mind and see the glint of desperation
that glosses over her eyes.  Her life is
unquestionably grim as she slaves away in a metal
factory.  
To escape from reality, she conjures up fantasies of
elaborate musical numbers set to the rhythm and beat
of ambient sounds of her environment (the humming of
machinery or the clacking of a passing railroad). 
It's all she can do to keep her sanity.  She wishes
that her life could be filled with the same kind of
gaiety that characterizes those kinds of musical
productions.  But her reality is filled with a general
sense of gloom and despair.  Her inner strength is
slowly waning, eroding against the tide of hardships
that have mercilessly chipped away at her soul.  She,
with the doll-like appearance and romanticist
disposition, is much too sweet to be dealt such a
cruel fate.  But in this depressing, angst-drenched
tale of a woman's life turned upside-down, seldom will
you find things to smile about.
"Dancer in the Dark" introduces us to Selma, a woman
who, at first, is filled with hope in the way that
fountains are filled with water.  Yet, even water
evaporates over time.  She suffers from a hereditary
ailment that is causing her to go blind.  Her son will
also succumb to its effects, but Selma works extra
hard to save enough money to pay for an operation to
save her son's vision.  But 
Selma's failing eyesight creates all kinds of
dangerous situations.  Maybe she'll become injured
working the heavy machinery.  Or perhaps, she won't be
able to get out of the way of an oncoming car or
train.  There is an overhanging sense of impending
danger.
As her eyesight worsens, so too does her situation. 
After a series of costly mistakes, her employer fires
her.  Her warm-hearted, yet careworn landlord (David
Morse) confesses that he's going bankrupt.  He asks
Selma for a small loan.  It saddens her that she can
not help.  The money is for her son's operation.  Her
meager savings are all that she has.  Without it, her
world would collapse.  However, her string of
unfortunate events continues, spiraling this film
towards its tragic denouement.
There are several notable elements that justify the
praise it received at the Cannes Film Festival, for
which it won best picture.  Bjork is confident in her
role, emoting the kind of feelings (her personal
losses, her devotion to her son, her inner fight to
deflect the pressure that is building upon her) that
endears us to her plight.  David Morse also turns in a
fine understated performance.  And, the inclusion of
the musical numbers (composed and performed by Bjork)
was unique.  However, this is not a musical in the
style of "The Sound of Music" or even "South Park:
Bigger, Louder & Uncut" was.  Rather, these numbers
are merely manifestations of Selma's daydreaming. 
They are unique elements of the film, but not an
essential component.
The real complaint lies within its headache-inducing
camerawork.  For most of the scenes, the director opts
for handheld cameras (the dance sequences use
stationary ones).  Thus, many of the scenes look
choppy as if you were looking at a home movie. 
Another huge distraction was that there were frequent,
excruciatingly close close-ups.  If Bjork had any
freckles, you could count each one.  Also, during an
exchange of dialogue, the camera would continuously
pan left and right as each person spoke.  It was like
watching a tennis match.  You are forewarned to sit in
the back of the theatre to minimize any potential
motion sickness.  
Film buffs will undoubtedly not want to miss this
unique offering.  It's a bold movie with several nervy
ideas.  But, given its disheartening theme, this film
can only put you in a sad mood for the rest of the
week.

Review for Yatgo ho yan (1997)
You can fault Jackie Chan films for having paper thin plots (it has
the complexity of a two-piece jigsaw puzzle).  You can fault him for
having one-dimensional bad guys (villains either wear sunglasses and
suits or look like snowboarding rejects).  You can fault him for
having a plethora of extraneous characters (there are always women
that need saving).  But it's hard not to like "Mr. Nice Guy."
Relentlessly animated and oozing with martial artistry, this movie
focuses on Jackie, a chef who just happens to be walking home one day
when he runs into an investigative reporter named Diana.  It seems
that people are chasing her because of a video that she just shot,
which would incriminate the local crime lord.  Being the chivalrous
guy that he is, he begins to chop and sock her pursuers.  At the end
of this entertaining chase/fight sequence, Jackie mistakenly and
unknowingly winds up with the video.  For the rest of the movie, the
bad guys are in hot pursuit of Jackie but our hero has no idea why.
At every turn, more bad guys come his way, and we are treated to a
variety of fight sequences that are artistically choreographed and
sometimes jaw-droppingly amazing.
Watch as he fends off bad guys in a moving horse and buggy traveling
out of control down a busy city street.  See how he skillfully employs
chairs, tables and garbage pails as his weapons.  Wince as he barely
escapes certain injury when he comes oh-so-close to a buzzsaw.  Be
amazed at his martial arts ability.  But you'll also laugh because
Chan's movies are kung-fu comedies that stress simplicity and fun.
These moviemakers don't want you to be absorbed with plot twists or
character development.  Rather, they create opportunities for Chan to
show his stuff.  And ample opportunities are created and Chan comes
through.
There are several things that pleased me about this Chan offering.  Up
to now, most of his releases had a very cheesy feel, especially
because of the dubbing.  Yet, while you may cock an eyebrow at the
insipidness of the bad guys, the story (filmed in English) seemed more
coherent and stayed focused on Jackie and his ability to take matters
into his own quick-as-lightning hands.  You won't be disappointed by
the amount of action in the film or the stuntwork performed by Chan.
His stunts are so wild that it's really hard to explain them in words.
You'll have to see it to believe it.
The best way to view Chan's offerings is not to think of them as
movies or Chan as an actor.  Consider "Mr. Nice Guy" as a show with
Chan as its lead performer.  Indeed, you'll be hard-pressed to find
entertainment like this anywhere else.

Title
Review for George of the Jungle (1997)
George of the Jungle  Tarzan for Toddlers
George of the Jungle might have tickled my funny bone when I was a wee   
lad.  His place is forever etched deep in my memory, lying somewhere   
where Curious George and Amelia Bedelia also roam.  After all, who can   
forget that unforgettable upbeat jungle song which ended with the words:   
Watch out for that tree!  I couldn't stop laughing, but my parents could   
never quite appreciate the slapstick silliness.
For better or worse, that quality hasn't changed.  An animated opening   
recounts how George, as a baby, wound up in the Buvuku jungle, in the   
heart of Africa.  He is befriended and raised by an assortment of   
animals, including Ape, who is a scholarly, talking gorilla;   
Tookie-Tookie, a toucan; and Shep, an elephant.  George (Brendan Fraser)   
grows up to be the guardian and self-proclaimed king of the jungle.  Yet   
despite his physical prowess, when it comes to vine-swinging, he is   
navigationally challenged.  You'll hear more than a few disconcerting   
"thuds" in this movie.
We are also introduced to Ursula (Leslie Mann), a sweet but meek   
socialite who is rethinking her engagement to the snooty Lyle Van de   
Groot (Thomas Haden Church) while exploring the lush Buvuku.  During her   
expedition, she is threatened by a lion.  George saves her and takes her   
back to his treehouse.  The result is a slowly developing love story   
between the city girl and the jungle boy.  But mostly, this is a movie   
that incorporates dozens of slapstick moments.  For example, we see   
George receiving sex education from a gorilla.  We watch Lyle try in vain   
to outwit George.  We see two bumbling poachers try to kidnap (apenap?)   
Ape so that they can cash in on this talking phenomenon.  And we see   
George, who has been taken back to America by Ursula, try to adapt to his   
modern surroundings.   One especially funny scene involves George   
watching a TV commercial that equates falling with love with having lots   
and lots of coffee.  Mistaking this as a weapon of woo, George   
immediately and voraciously munches on all the coffee that he can find in   
the house.  The caffeine buzz makes him hyper, and he runs out into the   
streets of his concrete jungle, where more silliness ensues.
Yet, while the movie does have it's funny moments, it became obvious to   
me that I had outgrown the silliness and the shenanigans of George and   
his jungle pals.  Yes, I have become my parents.  It should be noted,   
however, that Fraser is physically agile, boyishly appealing and brings   
good comic timing to the role.  And, to Disney's credit, all of the   
children in the theatre were laughing and enjoying the jokes and the   
humor of it all.  However, while the portions were just right for the   
young ones, adults will find this fare not very filling.  

Title
Review for Amistad (1997)
Throughout the history of Man, our individuality, our evolution, and
our innate ability to define who we are stems from one concept.
Freedom is what allows us to pursue our inalienable rights of life,
liberty and happiness.  The struggle to attain that freedom; however,
has come at a high price.  Consider the sacrifice that Jesus made.
Consider the American Revolutionary War.  Consider the case of the
Amistad.
In 1839, slaves aboard the ship, La Amistad, escape from their bonds
and subsequently overrun the ship.  Enraged, they kill most of their
captors. The Amistad is eventually captured by the US Navy, and the
escapees are brought to stand trial for various counts of murder and
mayhem.  But this is more than just a simple trial.  During this time
period, the symbolic nature of this trial will have a long-lasting
effect that will ultimately help to shape the direction of young
America.  Several interested parties all have a large stake in its
outcome.  Some view the slaves as property and want the trial to be
handled as a property issue.  The trial also has repercussions that
threatens the stability of an international treaty.  But most
importantly, exonerating and freeing the Amistad defendants may
ultimately throw the country into civil war as southern leaders will
look upon this as a prelude to total emancipation, which would be a
threat to their economic prosperity.
This is a very fragile and pivotal point in America's history.  Part
of the film acutely illustrates the atrocities of the slave trade.
Men, women and children are ripped apart from their families and
communities, only to be sold as a commodity. Their lives have been
stripped away.  Their ordeal is torturous.  Like cattle, some are sold
off while others are slaughtered.  It is truly shocking to witness
such brutality.  You can not help but shed a tear for those
unfortunate victims.  The other portion takes the form of a courtroom
drama that shows how the great minds of that day tried to maneuver
through moral ambiguity and address a higher order of responsibility.
Those that wished to set the slaves free include Roger Baldwin
(Matthew McConaughey), a lawyer who at first bases his case on
property law but slowly comes to see his clients as human beings. The
cause is also supported by two abolitionists, a former slave (Morgan
Freeman) and an immigrant named Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard).  Former
President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) also argues eloquently
and ably for their freedom. Those that oppose their freedom include
the pubescent Queen of Spain (Anna Paquin) who demands that the slaves
be returned to her, sailors and merchants that hold receipts of their
purchase, and a bumbling President Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne), who is
constantly being pressured by Southerners that threaten secession.
The leader of the slaves, Cinque, (African model Djimon Hounsou), is
truly a majestic and formidable leader.  He doesn't speak any English,
but must somehow try to free his comrades in a foreign environment
where the judicial system is still experiencing growing pains.
Directed by Steven Spielberg, you can see his penchant for
over-the-top poignancy.  Indeed, there are some incredibly moving
scenes that can bring you to tears.  The plight of the Amistad
defendants is a heart-wrenching one.  Cinque's crusade is poetic.
Another highlight is Anthony Hopkins as the dotty politician, who
delivers one of the best courtroom speeches ever (Oscar contender as
Best Supporting Actor).  There are, however, two minor (very minor)
complaints that I want to point out.  The first is that the actual
exploration of the slave trade happens outside the main framework of
this movie.  It serves as a backdrop to Cinque's quest for freedom.
Eventually, and this is my second minor reservation, this fact gives
way to an extended courtroom drama, which covers the last 90 minutes
of the film.
But, do not let these observations discount the importance of this
historical epic.  Amistad, based on the book, Black Mutiny, is
courageously weighty and poignant.  It's an important movie and offers
a historical peek into a young nation when a few good men desperately
tried to do the right thing within a misguided society that was deeply
divided.

Review for Jurassic Park III (2001)
"JP III" is like "Alien" for toddlers.  In that sci-fi
thriller, audiences saw oozing aliens on a space
station stalking and munching doomed victims running
amuck.  So, if you've seen that one, you kind of know
what to expect in terms of thrills and chills
(although there's much less gore here). This film
takes place on a deserted island instead of a
spaceship.  And instead of oozing aliens, the hapless
victims try to survive several imposing prehistoric
carnivores.
Dinosaurs are the main draw of this film.  There are
plenty of them, and they are all magnificently
conceived using state-of-the art digital technology. 
We were first introduced to these behemoths eight
years ago when the first "JP" was released.  We were
instantly mesmerized at the effects back then.  And in
the third installment, you'll see that you have not
outgrown its novelty (even if you've seen that
dinosaur special that recently aired on Discovery).  
Among the impressive dinosaur population are
velociraptors that are eerily more vicious and cunning
than you had previously remembered.  There is also a
hungry 44-foot spinosaurus, a more temperamental
predator than the T-Rex that looks forward to a meal
of screaming humans.  But most incredible are the
pteranodons, flying predators (that remind me of those
aliens from "Pitch Black") with talons and grabbing
power that can pick up a Cadillac.  
These magnificent creatures, however, are more
wondrous than any of the human characters are.  
The cast includes Sam Neill, who survived the first
JP.  He returns as a devoted paleontologist who works
feverishly on velociraptor research, forwarding the
bold notion that they were even more intelligent than
primates.  They could've been the dominant species if
not for the great cataclysm.  Of course, these wild
ideas do little for his ability to raise the needed
funds to continue his research while scientists wonder
why he would rather study fossils instead of real
dinosaurs on those islands.  That's because, as he
says, "those creatures are genetically engineered, and
nothing on Earth or in heaven could get me on that
island."
However, an ambitious businessman (William H. Macy)
and his estranged wife (Tea Leoni) convince him
otherwise after promising to make a huge donation for
a guided air tour of one of those islands.  Of course,
the couple have a hidden (but not nefarious) agenda. 
With hidden agendas come bad luck.  And their airplane
crash-lands on the desolate island.  "You know," says
our stoic paleontologist, "we probably won't get off
this island alive."  Indeed some of them don't,
although like in those alien movies, the first to go
are the anonymous extras.  
There are some exciting and even impressive sequences
as everyone tries to avoid being eaten by all manner
of prehistoric monsters.  However, this film's heart
can't stack up to the first two JPs.  This one lacks
the human element that made its predecessors a bit
weightier.  This is primarily a search and rescue
flick with the element of family unity added in. 
Missing is that sense of majesty or the uneasy feeling
that arose when man tampered recklessly with nature. 
What we get is Sam Neill oozing with moral
indignation, Tea Leoni impersonating Kate Capshaw (the
scream queen from Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom), and William H. Macy providing goofy comic
relief.  Here, the dinosaurs are truly the more
evolved species.

Title
Review for Mexican, The (2001)
The good news is that for two hours, "The Mexican"
brings together actors who are currently at the
pinnacle of their careers and popularity.  Though
longevity in Hollywood is frequently ephemeral,
heartthrob Brad Pitt is still the recipient of much
adoration from moviegoers.  Effervescent Julia Roberts
is the hands-down favorite to walk away with her first
Oscar as Best Actress for her recent work as the sassy
"Erin Brokovich."  And burly James Gandolfini is known
as everyone's favorite Mob boss in HBO's incredibly
edgy drama, "The Soprano's."   The 'star-studded'
wattage generated by these three could solve
California's utility crisis.  
The bad news is that for most of the film, this quirky
romantic comedy separates Pitt and Roberts, who play
Jerry and Samantha, two star-crossed lovers with their
own agendas.  In fact, they each go their own way
about 15 minutes into the film.  It's a move that,
unfortunately, hinders the film's romantic cuteness
from really taking off. 
In one of the first scenes, for example, Pitt and
Roberts are discussing their divergent priorities. 
He's an accident-prone bagman for a crime boss and has
promised Samantha that he won't take any more jobs. 
Samantha wants to go to Vegas to become a croupier. 
But when he is forced to take one more job or face
death by fire, Samantha becomes furious.  There's zest
in their emotions and these two make an adorable
couple.
Samantha leaves for Vegas while Jerry heads to Mexico.
 Well, maybe these two stars are so big that they just
couldn't fit on the screen at the same time.  But it
does give an opportunity for both of these stars to
flex their comedic muscles. 
Jerry's final job takes him to some pallid village so
that he can pick up "The Mexican," a fabled antique
gun.  All he has to do is collect the antique and then
go home.  This fabulous weapon has quite a bit of
interesting lore, which is told through sepia-toned
flashbacks interspersed throughout the film.  This is
actually a nicely presented sequence, which tells a
tale that is fantastical and preternatural. 
Poor Jerry.  Our hapless gringo is mired with bad
luck.  His rental car gets stolen, he gets arrested,
while allies become enemies.  He can only raise his
arms in disbelief.  We may raise our arms in disbelief
too.  This portion never has few precious funny
moments; and the bizarre violence isn't consistent
enough to add pep.  Jerry is probably just as annoyed
with his lack of luck as we are with the accompanying
harmonica and banjo soundtrack that makes it feel like
a bad Spaghetti Western.
Samantha represents the better half of this
relationship as well as the more enjoyable portion of
the story.  On her way to Vegas, she is intercepted by
a hitman (Gandolfini) who uses her as a hostage to
make sure that Jerry succeeds.  During the course of
her ordeal, they establish a connection with each
other.  She talks about Jerry; he talks about his love
woes.  Their dialogue scenes add a needed sense of
character dimension.  It's actually the most
entertaining element of this film.
Pitt, Roberts, and Gandolfini give fine performances. 
But it's a bit hard for us to stay in synch as the
momentum shifts between the two stories.  Overall,
"The Mexican" is sometimes cute, sometimes funny, and
offers a few neat surprises.  But its offbeat
qualities are uneven.

Review for Charlie's Angels (2000)
Incredibly, Hollywood has the courage to create yet
again another feature-length film based on a classic
TV show.  You may remember a recent handful of similar
attempts that have made disastrous transitions from
the small screen to the silver screen.  These
forgettable projects included "The Avengers," "The Mod
Squad," and "Shaft."  Received poorly by audiences and
critics alike, all were money-losing debacles.  
This time around, the latest attempt is the
resurrection of "Charlie's Angels," the jiggly and
feathery-haired 70's detective show.  Would this
update suffer the same fate as those other fiascoes? 
The project certainly had many studio executives
scratching their heads in doubt as the film underwent
massive rewrites and last-minute reshoots.  Gossip
also surfaced that there were severe creative
differences among the stars, and in particular,
between Lucy Liu (who plays Alex, the techno-whiz
Angel) and Bill Murray (who plays Bosley, Charlie's
avuncular assistant).  Meanwhile, production costs
skyrocketed to $90 million while people began to
wonder about the viability of a film that was taken
from a show that had scripts that were so light. 
Original Angel, Kate Jackson, once mused that "it
would take a week to get to the floor if you dropped
it from the ceiling."
Happily, reports of its demise are greatly
exaggerated.  The new "Charlie's Angels," as it turns
out, is an unabashed romp.  It's a fine mix of action,
camp and self-parody.  I'm surprised to say this, but
this is the most fun that I've had at the movies in
weeks!
If you've seen the television show, then you're
familiar with the setup.  Three beautiful women (Drew
Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu) work together
as an elite trio of detectives who receive their
assignment over speakerphone from the disembodied
voice of Charlie (spoken, as in the original show, by
Baritone-voiced John Forsythe).  Of course, they're
still glamorous and great to look at.  But these new
Angels have powered up.  They aren't shy about
employing their saucy feminine wiles.  Their
impressive skill sets range widely from speaking
Japanese to Indy Car racing.  And, thanks to
Matrix-like effects, they can really kick some butt.
Their latest case involves thwarting a scheme that
threatens to end privacy.  The film's elements borrow
heavily from any number of James Bond films.  There
are high-tech gadgets, a notable henchman (a silent,
sword-wielding, thin man played by Crispin Glover), a
host of enjoyable action sequences and a final
showdown at the villain's stronghold.  
While the plot is serviceable, the film is more about
flash, style, and good-looking babes.  The filmmakers
know that this isn't matter to be taken seriously. 
Consequently, they have great fun with this film. 
Guest stars include comedic lightweights Luke Wilson,
Matthew Perry and Tom Green as the Angels' love
interests.  Diaz energetically wiggles her booty while
dancing on Soul Train as Sir Mix-A-Lot's anthem, "I
Like Big Butts," plays in the background.  Barrymore
enjoys a victory moonwalk after dispatching a group of
thugs.  Liu dons a dominatrix outfit as she trains a
group of gawking, bespectacled engineers.  What's not
to like?  Completely watchable, this is the kind of
playful material that attracts people to magazines
like Maxim or FHM.  For this Maxim-reading guy,
"Charlie's Angels" was more entertaining than I ever
thought possible.

Review for South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)
I've never actually the seen the Comedy Central offering about life in
a mountain redneck town' called South Park.  But it's reputation is
certainly well known as a show filled wall-to-wall with words that moms
would be shocked to hear.  And film always has a way of elevating the
relative tameness found on TV. `South Park: Bigger, Louder and Uncut'
elevates full throttle to the limit.  It couldn't be any more raunchy,
shameless, and obscenity-laden.  Parents bewareif you're children are
asking for a few dollars to go to some art film, you'd better follow
them because they are on there way to see this film.
I'm only sending out this warning because the obscene language goes
beyond excessive.  Yet, there is a definite intelligence at work here
as a vicious social satire about our ever-degenerating culture and
societal norms.  The creators of `South Park' probably realize that
they're pushing the envelope in every scene, and are smart to work in
obvious references that stuff like `South Park' can only do more harm
than good although in the short term, it can be kind of funny.  Witness
for example the first 15 minutes where we meet up with four familiar
foul-mouthed friends (Stan, Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny  well, he speaks
with a muffle).  They take some money from their mom under the pretense
that they are going to an art film.  Instead, they bribe a bum to buy
tickets for them to the newly released `R' rated movie called Terrence
and Philip'.  This film is filled with non-stop vulgarity and bathroom
jokes.   In the first five minutes, the `F' word is said umpteen times
while Terrence and Philip commence a song and dance routine where at
precise moments, various people all break wind.  The various tones and
lengths create a pseudo-wind concerto.   I almost laughed, although I'm
ashamed to admit it.  The four young boys soak it all in while all of
the other patrons begin to leave the theatre.  The incredible thing was
that at that exact same moment, the same thing happened in my theatre. 
People got up and left.  To be able to sit through this film really
requires some discipline and open-mindedness.
The kids take everything that they've learned from this film and
proudly go about their elementary school repeating phrases to everyone
from friends to teachers to the principal.  The mothers are all aghast
and take arms against Canada, the country that produced the film. 
Don't blame usblame those pesky northern neighbors.  The mother's
lobby to execute Terence and Philip as treasonous prisoners of war
while the children contemplate the consequences of their action and
reflect the values that are at stake.  But as with most cartoons that
try to stretch from 30 to 90 minutes, a lot of it loses its razor-sharp
tenacity.  To compensate, there are also sub-plots about little Stan's
infatuation for a fellow female schoolmate (the running joke is that
every time he opens his mouth, he throws up on her face), and the
coming of Satan which will occur if Terrence and Philip are executed.  
`South Park' does tell its story with energy and with song.  In fact,
the structure is much like a traditional musical.  There are a few
catchy tunes such as the introspective `What Would Brian Boitano Do?'
and a catchy, march-like `Blame Canada'.  Most impressive was a
well-orchestrated production number that ably connected all of the
separate plots.  Still, given the frankness of the language and the
non-stop lowbrow humor and wonton destruction, I can't, with any sense
of integrity, recommend this film.  However, I did think that this film
held together better than Wild Wild West.  And in a few instances,
there were flashes of wisdom and intelligence that really made me take
notice (the undertones of freedom of speech and the blind reckless
abandon to which overprotective mothers defend their children, for
example).  If you do see it, prepare to be shocked.

Review for Perfect Storm, The (2000)
The fishermen of Gloucester, Massachusetts live their
lives to fish.  As the film opens, we see this
pastoral harbor community with statues honoring brave
seamen, shipbuilders hard at work creating new
vessels, and a large number of fishing boats
triumphantly returning with their catch.  Gloucester
fishermen are more committed to fishing than to their
marriages.   They are courageous superheroes when they
are out on the open seas.  And, to catch their fish,
they are even willing to brave the perfect storm.
"The Perfect Storm" is an absorbing yarn about man
versus nature and the folly that results from blind
hubris.  Based on Sebastian Junger's nonfiction
bestseller, the film is a vivid retelling of a
devastating 1991 incident in which a down-on-his-luck,
swordfish boat captain risks it all to bring back a
catch that promises to make them a huge profit.  Led
by skipper Billy Tyne (stoic George Clooney) who
captains the Andrea Gail, he hopes that this next trip
out to the fishing grounds of the Grand Banks (a few
days east of Gloucester) will lift him out of his
current slump. 
But going out to sea is like an extended and dangerous
tour of duty.  The crewmembers' loved ones rejoice
when their men return home.  But faces are filled with
sorrow when it's time to leave.  For Captain Tyne,
fishing has resulted in a broken marriage.  For the
youthful and wildly-in-love Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), it
means having to spend time away from his girlfriend. 
And for crewmember Murphy (John C. Reilly), it means
being separated from his lovable son.  Other crewmates
are also hesitant to go back out.  Tyne coldly stares
at them and threatens, "if any of you don't want to
come, a replacement is just a phone call away."  You
may think that he's unrealistically overbearing, but
as a local hatchery manager says, "that's the way the
game is played."  
The seas are a dangerous place in the fall, having the
potential to swallow ships whole.  "The Grand Banks is
no joke in October," warns one concerned Gloucester
resident.  By now, we've developed a genuine liking
for the crew of the Andrea Gail, as well as an immense
respect for their work ethic.  But we get the
foreboding sensation that this trip will be marred
with peril.
The Andrea Gail encounters all kinds of bad luck. 
Though they eventually catch lots of fish, a monster
storm takes them by surprise.  The local forecaster
says, "you can be a meteorologist all your life and
never see this."  It's a storm so ferocious that it
creates maximum gale force winds and 10-story swells. 
In fact, you can barely hear the actors even when they
are yelling at each other through the wind-whipped
rain.  Special effects convincingly and impressively
create the furious, churning seas.  And the camera
shots, which show the crew rocking back and forth,
convey such realism that at times it was a
queasiness-inducing experience.  The film also shows
other craft caught and victimized by the angry seas. 
Freighters are having its cargo knocked off its decks
by the enormous waves while even the Coast Guard has
been rendered almost powerless.  Captain Tyne remains
unfazed.  He must travel through the storm in order to
sell his fish, lest his catch spoil.  He is a
determined man who opens the throttle against the
unstoppable forces of pride and Mother Nature.
Engaging characters make for a watchable film, and the
entire ensemble cast performs admirably.  We share the
concern of the loved ones as they watch the
increasingly dire weather reports.  We feel their
sense of helplessness.  We pray for the fearless
skipper to find a way to maneuver through the crashing
waves, howling winds, and torrential downpour.  The
love that we develop for the crew and those that
eagerly await their return pulls us in.  But
ultimately it may be the storm that pulls them under.

Review for Wild Things (1998)
If controversial talk show host Jerry Springer, renowned for fighting
guests and sensational subjects, ever wanted to live in a town that
would provide an endless well of scheming characters and bizarre
relationships, he might want to move into the upscale Florida enclave
of Blue Bay.  He could base an entire week of shows on Teacher of the
Year, Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon).  When we first meet him, he appears
to be one of the most earnest of people - forthright and constantly
looking out for the interest of his students.  We also meet two of his
pupils.  One is an underachieving, wrong-side-of-the-tracks Suzie
Toller (Neve Campbell) and another is the richest girl in the
community, Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards).  But in noirish movies
such as this, nothing is what it seems.
Immediately, we know that we are in for a strange movie experience.
As the beginning credits roll, we are hypnotized with a pulsating
drumbeat and guitar riffs that eerily twang for several measures.  We
also see opening scenes of the Floridian swamps and the crocodiles
that lie in wait suggesting a place of bitter secrets.  The filmmaker
quickly establishes that we are in a place slightly skewed from
reality.
Kelly has the blatant hots for Mr. Lombardo.  She makes excuses to get
close to him by asking for rides and washing his car.  We eventually
see Kelly standing in Lombardo's living room, dressed in a white shirt
and white shorts, dripping wet after washing his car, and looking
lustily at the surprised teacher.  However, the scene quickly moves
ahead and we see her leave the house, angry and distressed.  What has
happened?  She tells her mom, who is an ex-lover of Lombardo and the
most powerful person in Blue Bay, that she was raped.  Infuriated, the
police are summoned and the lead detective (Kevin Bacon) arrests the
teacher.  This entire setup, which takes about 45 minutes to develop,
finally leads to a trial.   After a surprise testimony, the film
quickly moves from a stale drama to a psychological thriller for the
remaining hour.
>From here, a new and twisted story begins to emerge, and this is where
the real fun begins.  However, it would be a crime for me to reveal to
you anything more.  But it becomes more engaging and amusingly campy
as it progresses.  Hidden motives emerge, unlikely alliances are
discovered and manipulative mind games are played with such fervor
that your movie-watching experience becomes almost voyeuristic.  
 "Wild Things" is like driving really fast down a winding country road
at night without any headlights.  You never know what's ahead of you
but you find your trip reckless yet thrilling.  This is the kind of
movie that you'll either like or hate.  There is no middle ground.
There are surprises galore and the atmosphere is decidedly both
libidinous and bent.  For example, there is a hot three-way "love"
scene that happens among the principal actors which will either appall
you or cement the fact that this is a slick production about
manipulation that heightens the psychologically twisted plot.  "Wild
Things" is trashy, bizarre, lurid, and demented.   And I liked it.

Review for Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)
Something odd has happened to Commander Data (Brent Spiner). He was
apart of an observation team that was sent to secretly observe a
peaceful colony known as the Baku. But he exhibits insubordinate
behavior by making his presence known to the villagers (a severe
violation of a non-interference clause known to watchers of the series
as the Prime Directive) and also attacks his fellow officers. What has
caused Data to act this way?  Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the
rest of the Enterprise crew, who have always entrusted their lives to
Data, comes to his aid and subsequently launch an investigation to
determine the motivation behind his actions. As a result, they uncover
a secret plot that could forever affect the lives of the Baku. And
although the Enterprise crew would be quick to defend the peaceful
colonists against mighty oppressors, their actions may jeopardize a
newfound alliance as well as their own future. It seems that an
incredible phenomenon makes this planet something of a Fountain of
Youth. Secrets learned from this planet may help humanity survive the
ongoing challenges from hostile alien factions of the Star Trek
universe. The wizened Picard, however, can not justify the forced
removal of a people. He must find a way to protect them. 
Unfortunately, Picard seemed like the only one that exhibited any kind
of convictions. His Shakespearean background allowed him to inject a
believable pathos into his role. The rest of the crew and even the
tone of the movie, however, seemed to lack any kind of fervor,
excitement or wit, which made the previous Star Trek movie (First
Contact) so enjoyable. Much can be blamed on the subject material,
which centers more on a moral battle rather than a life-or-death
struggle. The goal of Picard's crusade didn't seem all that
compelling, which made the whole movie experience somewhat
uninteresting.  One thing that I've always admired about many of the
Star Trek storylines is that it frequently presents a plot that has
some educational value - whether the episode is intended to impart a
lesson or whether it reflects on a significant chapter of humanity's
history. The drawback, however, is that the presentation can be
somewhat sobering, and in a 2-hour, feature-length film, the message
can wear thin rather quickly. So, as a fan of Star Trek, I enjoyed
seeing the crew reassemble for another mission. But I was disappointed
to a degree because this latest installment offered an all-to-familiar
premise that amounted to a slightly better-than-average episode.  


Title
Review for Scary Movie (2000)
Since "Scary Movie" is nothing more than a silly
spoof, it would be unfair to measure it against the
same standards as you would any other kind of film. 
The plot, thin as it is, revolves around the myriad of
horror movies that have ever come out, and in
particular "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last
Summer."  In fact, one of the original titles
considered was "Scream If You Know What I Did Last
Halloween."  
In this parody, a mad slasher donning the frock and
ghost mask from "Scream" is plaguing a local high
school, and no one can figure out who it is or why
he/she is doing it.  But if you're even thinking about
trying to determine his/her identity or motive, then
you're completely in the wrong mind set.  Meanwhile,
the characterizations, shallow as they are, serve no
other purpose other than to usher us from one setup to
another.  The players in this film are a few of the
Wayan's brothers and a few other 20-something actors
who either fall victim to the mad slasher, scream at
the top of their lungs, and/or engage in heavy
tongue-kissing.  
Thus, the question that begs to be asked is: is this
funny enough to endure the 100-minute running time? 
In many ways, watching "Scary Movie" might remind you
of any recent installment of "Saturday Night Live." 
It starts off with funny material but then quickly
spirals downward as it becomes mired in unfunny
gross-out gags, jokes that are insulting rather than
irreverent, and a lineup of skits that strains for
laughs but instead is greeted by heads nodding in
disappointment.
The funniest, most clever, and probably least
offensive segment happens at the beginning of the
film.  Desperately trying to escape the masked killer
is a dumb, nubile blonde.  She comes across a table
loaded with a variety of powerful weapons...and a
banana.  Guess which one she picks?  Then, as she runs
outside, there are two road signs.  One points towards
safety.  The other points towards death.  Guess which
path she takes?  
There are some other funny tidbits including a take on
the "Wassup" beer commercials and a parody of "The
Matrix" (which would have been funnier if I hadn't
seen the movie trailer a dozen times), but the clever
ideas are at a bare minimum.  The tone of the movie
begins to shift.  Jokes become extravagantly gross
such as the butch, Swedish woman named Miss Mann who
has a secret that 'she' wants to expose.  This spawned
more "Ewwwws" rather than chuckles.  Gags also focus
heavily on sex.  There's a running theme about a
boyfriend who encourages her virgin girlfriend to
explore.  And there's another ongoing gag about an
effeminate jock who acts gay in every way possible but
constantly denies it.  The film also engages in heavy
stereotyping.  Admittedly, I was glad to see a movie
patron, who talked incessantly on her cell phone and
screamed at the onscreen actors as if they could hear
her, get what she deserved.  But the pleasures are
slim at best.
Juvenile, lewd, and only sometimes funny, "Scary
Movie" scores a 9 out of 10 on the Dumb-o-Meter, a 5
out of 10 on the Laugh-O-Meter.  And a 3 out of 10 on
the Whether-You-Should-See-This-Or-Not-Meter.

Title
Review for Fast and the Furious, The (2001)
Guys, here's a movie especially for you.  And if
you're still simmering over the fact that you were
forced to accompany your girlfriend to the endlessly
sad "English Patient" or some other unrelenting
tearjerker, here's a chance for you to exact some
payback.  
"The Fast and the Furious" is a movie that is fueled
with adrenaline and testosterone.  The men brim with
bravado and hubris, the women are beautiful and tough,
the soundtrack blares hard alternative rock music, the
supercharged cars are hot, and the racing sequences
are, well...fast and furious.  It's racing sequences
are so intense that after you leave the theatre,
you'll be tempted to drive 90 MPH out of the parking
lot, fit your engine with nitrous oxide boosters, and
then race against an oncoming locomotive through a
railroad crossing.
The plot revolves around the efforts of agent Brian
(Paul Walker) and the FBI to crack a brazen,
truck-hijacking ring.  These taut hijacking sequences
feature gang members that execute precision driving
techniques to surround and board an 18-wheeler at
highway speeds.  We feel an innate thrill as we watch
these stunts.  
Investigators feel that the mastermind is Dom (Vin
Diesel), an intimidating and streetwise racer who
advises his disciples, "It don't matter whether you
win by an inch or a mile - winning's winning." 
Currently, there isn't sufficient evidence to make any
arrests, and the ringleader could be anyone within the
racing underworld, including Dom's nemesis, Johnny
Tran (Rick Yune) who commands an Asian gang with whom
he competes for turf, respect, and cars. 
The police story, however, takes a backseat to a more
interesting facet: the street racing subculture
predicated on speed and brotherhood.  One particular
scene, a wild street race between Dom and three
competitors, ably encapsulates the allure of being
involved with this dangerous activity.  Within this
population of car enthusiasts, having a souped-up
machine commands respect from your peers and the
attraction of girls.  But, as one racer notes, "it's
not how you stand by your car, it's how you race your
car."  
Dozens of cars then converge on to an ad hoc strip of
road somewhere in the outskirts of Los Angeles. Cars
line its sides to prevent non-racers from entering the
course.  We see the racial cliques that root for their
particular driver as they compete for cash and pink
slips.  A follower listens to the police scanner and
barks out status reports.  And when the police finally
come, the multitude of cars scatter like cockroaches
away from light.
While the story holds our attention, it's the racing
sequences that provide the most thrills.  These scenes
are edited seamlessly and allow us to embrace the feel
of incredibly high speeds and the rush from street
racing's inherent dangers.  A botched attempt to
hijack an 18-wheeler and an edge-of-your-seat race
against a freight train were especially riveting.  Sit
down and buckle up.  It's going to be a wild ride.

Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
`Star Wars: Episode I'  The Force Is Still with Us
The hype has finally begun to diminish and after months of waiting (and
years for others), the highly anticipated `Phantom Menace' has finally
come to a theatre not too far, far away.  Even I was swept with
anticipation, for I am of the Star Wars generation.  I bought my ticket
a week in advance, and I was ready to once again be a part of the Star
Wars phenomenon.  The crowd showed an equal level of heightened
enthusiasm.  When I arrived at my local Loews theatre 30 minutes in
advance, many of the seats were already taken.  I was lucky enough to
find a good spot, and when the lights dimmed, a hushed silence swept
across the rows of patrons who had come, like me, to relive our
childhood and who had hoped that the film would live up to its hype.
In many ways, the film does live up to its hype.  Like the original
Star Wars that changed the landscape of movie making, this film shows
off many new advances in sound and imaging technology.  Visually, the
movie is absolutely gorgeous  eye candy galore!  Clearly there is much
imagination at work that can be seen in every shot.  Colors are
breathtakingly beautiful, settings are wonderfully detailed, and scenes
are beautifully envisioned.  For example, there is a bustling
metropolis filled with towering skyscrapers and an underwater city
whose landscape resembles a collection of light bulbs on a crystal
chandelier.  I was impressed with a battle scene pitting thousands of
evil battle droids against a small army of humanoids that looked like a
cross between a dragon and a duck and was captivated by a race sequence
that can only be described as a futuristic combination of Ben Hur and
Speed Racer.  The sound was equally impressive, especially a scene
involving a Senate debate.  To truly appreciate the spectacle of this
film, you'll need to see this film on a big screen with an advanced
sound system.  But is there as much force with the story and characters
as there is with the visual and sound effects?
The answer, unfortunately, is no.  The beauty of the original Star Wars
is that it involved uncharted frontiers and growing up in the face of
adversity.  That's not really the case here as it is a story about an
epic battle that may shift the balance of power.  In Episode I, the
evil empire is determined to assert its power and dominance.  They use
a group called the Trade Federation to further their goals and take
over planet Nabooie, which has immense importance in terms of regional
commerce.  But to secure their victory, they must force the noble and
strong queen (the Geisha-adorned Natalie Portman) to sign a treaty. 
She escapes with the help of Jedi Knights (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan
Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).  In their quest to regain control of her home
world, they also meet up with the future Darth Vader, Annekin Skywalker
(played by Jake Lloyd).  Annakin is able, inventive, and becomes a
great asset to their cause.  To stop the good guys, the empire
dispatches an evil warrior who has tremendous agility and fighting
skills.  He does battle with the Jedi knights with a very unique light
saber staff.  
Though impressive, this film couldn't manage to evoke that same feeling
of awe that I had hoped.  I'm sure that the amount of hype that
preceded the movie biased me as I watched the film.  Also, the
characters were not as well-defined nor as memorable as Luke Skywalker
or Han Solo.   I also think that when I saw the original Star Wars, I
was only 11, and at that time in my life, I was completely mesmerized
by what I had seen on screen.  As I've matured, my tastes have taken my
senses in a different direction that favors stories about the darkness
of humanity (like `The Matrix') over films brimming with cuddly
extra-terrestrials and star ships.  You won't come out of the film
feeling that you've experienced an event.  But, this is a film that is
stunning in many ways and always manages to be enjoyable.


Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
`American Beauty' offers us a glimpse into what really
fuels suburban families, like that of Lester Burnham
(Kevin Spacey).  In doing so, the film tears apart the
suburban myth of well-trimmed rose-gardens and
automatic garage door openers.  Sure, Lester may have
a nice house, a family, and a relatively secure
future, but his life isn't much more exciting than
that of a mannequin.  And though he projects a
constant smile, his life is just an endless spiral of
boredom and the highlight of his day is his morning
shower.  What has made his life so bereft of passion? 
Perhaps it's his prissy wife, Carolyn (Annette
Bening).  She also smiles a lot and tries to excel as
a real estate agent.  But her life is equally vacuous
and her soul is joyless.  Her self-confidence is
almost non-existent, and her marriage to the
milquetoast Lester is nothing but a loveless sham. 
Daughter Jane (Thora Birch) doesn't add any sanity to
this family either.  Even Lester admits that what
neighbors see is `a commercial for how normal we are
when we're anything but.'  
Now, dig a little deeper and look a little closer. 
This film reveals some very surprising things that you
would never think would exist.  What gets Lester's
juices flowing again is Angela (Mena Suvari), a friend
of Jane's that he begins fantasizing about.  Angela,
who confidently boasts about her adult experiences,
doesn't mind the attention and says that if Lester had
more muscles, she would be interested.  DING!  Lester
breaks out the weights and starts a running regimen. 
But this is just the beginning of the new Lester.  He
quits his job and blackmails his boss at the same
time, he begins smoking powerful marijuana, and he
buys a classic muscle car.  But why should Lester have
all the fun?  His radical actions prompt Carolyn to
begin an affair with her chief competitor while Jane
begins to take an interest in a mysterious boy next
door.
The wheels are set in motion and the film wonderfully
strips any conventions that we have of suburbia and
gives us some very strange yet sad characters with
whom we can empathize.  For Lester, it's time to let
loose.  He no longer cares about anything and while
chaos can destroy the sanctity of his home, it is the
only thing he appreciates now in his life. 
Consequently, the situations that he winds up in are
often funny, poignant, and amusing.  A counter-story
to Lester's life features a militaristic, homophobic
retired marine living next door.  He preaches
discipline to his son.  But like the Burnham's nothing
on the outside is as it really seems.  The real
interesting point that this film makes features
another of Lester's neighbors, Jim and Jim (Scott
Bakula and Sam Robards), who are gay.  Despite their
strange outward appearance, their lives were the most
normal of all.
The beauty of `American Beauty' is it's harsh
revelations and brutally frank situations.  
This is not a film that strives to entertain as a
comedy.  Rather it is a film that tries to scrape away
at the true nature of people like Lester Burnham.  As
Lester, Kevin Spacey is comfortable and almost too
real as the dispirited suburbanite whose last chance
at living is fading fast.  Annette Bening also shows
might in her portrayal of the brittle housewife. 
However all of the wonderfully developed characters
and their complexities will beg you to ask yourself
what may really be going on in your own cul-de-sac
world.

Review for I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)
 The camera zooms in incredibly close .  It focuses on the closed eyes
 of a person presumed dead.  All of a sudden, with a thunderous sound
 effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse, his eyelids open.  The
 camera zooms in incredibly close.  It focuses on one of the characters
 desperately running for her life.  Then, with a thunderous sound
 effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse, she bumps into the killer.
 The camera zooms in incredibly close.  It focuses on a door from where
 seemingly strange sounds emanate.  All of a sudden, with a thunderous
 sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse, the doors swing open
 to reveal what's inside.
 Close-up thrill-shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter
 from the audience rather than genuine fear, which is a pretty good
 sign that you're not watching the thriller that the director had
 originally envisioned.  Rather, you adopt the opinion that the
 characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they're in,
 that you stop caring about who lives, who dies and where the story
 goes.  Instead, you become more interested in how the characters get
 killed off.   
 The four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for
 this movie are  Helen and Barry and Julie and Ray - two couples and
 dear friends to one another.  During the summer just after high school
 graduation, they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway.
 Suddenly, without warning, their car hits someone whom the teens
 presume was killed as a result of that collision.  Fearing jail time
 and possible manslaughter charges if they confess, they instead decide
 to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the
 episode again.  A year goes by and things among the four friends begin
 to change.  Relationships fizzle, future dreams crumble, and attitudes
 change.  But, they can not forget what they did.  And apparently,
 neither can someone else.  Someone begins to send letters to all four
 of the teens with the frightening message: "I know what you did last
 summer."  The letter-writer (a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a
 large metal hook) soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt
 down the four teens.  It's now up to the four of them to try to figure
 out who the killer is before it's too late.  
 While this movie has some nice visually eerie effects, too much of
 it's impact had to be generated with extreme close-ups, while the
 level of suspense was choppy at best.  There is so much more that this
 movie could have been, but decided to give us nothing but cheap
 thrills.  It could have been a clever whodunit, but discovering who
 ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders.  It could
 have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood, but
 seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film.
 It could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you're
 alone and you see shadowy figures moving about, you don't walk towards
 them yelling "hello".  Once you yell "hello", you can expect an
 extreme close-up, a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding
 musical pulse.  It's difficult to be in suspense when you know what's
 about to happen.  The only redeeming aspect of the movie is that I now
 have a neat idea for a Halloween costume, but I'm not sure if the
 local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks.  The horror that
 I experienced from this film is realizing that I actually went to see
 it.

Review for Mission to Mars (2000)
If you've ever seen pictures of Mars and have ever
wondered about a fuzzy photograph that resembles a
face on the Martian surface, this movie has a colossal
idea of what it might just be.  What the filmmaker
presents is probably wacky in real life.  But, I
remind you that this film is purely science fiction. 
The whole objective is to take a wild idea and build
around it.  Do you remember a recent sci-fi film
called `Independence Day?'  Then, we were asked to
make a leap of faith and to believe in the Roswell UFO
incident.  If we didn't want to open our minds to
that, then the movie would have collapsed in a
heartbeat.  As you may know, however, `Independence
Day' shattered records at the box office.  So, most of
us took that leap of faith.  Remember, in
science-fiction, there is no limit to the imagination,
so everyone is free to dream the impossible dream.
Director Brian DePalma dreams the impossible dream. 
And the result is `Mission to Mars,' a fun space
odyssey set in the year 2020.  Did I say fun?  Perhaps
you've heard all sorts of negative reviews coming in
from around the country.  Well, I urge you to ignore
them and to first ask yourself this question.  Did you
make that leap of faith in Independence Day?  If you
did, then take only a slightly larger leap (Martian
gravity is less than Earth's, you know?) and you'll
find yourself enjoying a cosmic cocktail that's one
part rescue mission and one part imagination.  
The rescue mission arises because of what happens when
Cmdr. Luke Graham (Don Cheadle) and his team arrive on
Mars.  The team discovers a small mountain that seems
to be made out of metal.  This has Cmdr. Luke baffled,
but when they begin a more intense examination of the
area, an unnatural force is unleashed.  Luke barely
manages to send a weak distress call to the World
Space Station orbiting Earth before his transmission
is lost.
On board the station is a handful of Luke's closest
friends and colleagues whom immediately mobilize to
begin a rescue operation.  Captained by Woody (Tim
Robbins), and supported by a crew of three
specialists, they ready themselves for the journey to
the Red Planet.  The crew members include Jim (Gary
Senise), who has obsessed over the secrets that Mars
might hold; Terri (Connie Nielsen), a strong-willed
woman and wife of Woody; and Phil (Jerry O'Connell), a
sharp-witted young scientist.  Travel to Mars will
take many months and will not be uneventful.  In a
suspenseful and clever sequence, meteor pellets
penetrate the ship's hull, eventually culminating into
a catastrophe that makes the `Apollo 13' accident seem
like a nosebleed.
The gritty astronauts eventually do make their way to
the planet surface and discover some fascinating
information.  This is where you are asked to make the
leap of faith.  The remainder of the film moves away
from the rescue component and now dabbles with the
metaphysical.  I had no problems with where the film
was going, and to be honest, the experience can be
described as a trip to a really cool planetarium where
we are given a Discovery Channel-esque presentation. 
And this is the turning point that every moviegoer
will come to.  If you can't make the leap, then you'll
find this to be a soppy finale.  If you can stay the
course, then imagination will reward you.
Sure, it could have been much, much more.  There could
have been better scripts for the characters.  The pace
of the film could have been more exciting, though it
is quite suspenseful.  And, some of the concepts could
have gone through a reality check.  The film also does
not chart new frontiers and the ideas may be hokey. 
But it is a film that establishes good pace, offers
great visual effects, and tells a fine fictional tale.

Review for Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, The (2000)
Somewhere in the back of my mind, in a rarely visited
location where cartoon characters that I have grown to
love but am now too old to remember, there resides a
flying squirrel and a likably dimwitted moose.  Known
as Rocky and Bullwinkle, their show was a crudely
drawn but lively post-Cold War adventure that pitted
these two against the evil machinations of three
scoundrels named Boris Badinov, Natasha, and their
fearless leader named Fearless Leader.  There was a
charming quirkiness to their episodes, which were
brutally inane and featured sharp puns and rapid-fire
humor.  It possessed a shallowness that was just right
for Saturday morning mindless fare.
It's now three decades later.  Rocky hasn't flown in
years.  Bullwinkle laments about the disappearing
woodlands throughout his home of Frostbite Falls.  And
our three villains are trapped in an endless cycle of
reruns.  But in the world of cartoons, anything is
possible.  Fearless Leader literally reaches out to a
hungry movie executive to ink a movie deal.  Suddenly,
the three of them emerge as flesh-and-blood people
(Jason Alexander as Boris, Renee Russo as Natasha, and
Robert DeNiro as Fearless Leader).  Free of their
two-dimensional cartoon world and from Rocky and
Bullwinkle, they now see an opportunity to hatch their
latest plan to rule the world.
Fearless Leader and his band begin to build a
television cable empire called RBTV (Really Bad
Television).  It will be filled with programs that are
so bad that the viewing audience will be turned into
zombies susceptible to hypnotic suggestion.  The
public will be told go out and vote in Fearless Leader
as the new President in the next election.  This is a
plan worthy of Pinky and the Brain (you know, one is a
genius and the other's insane).
Out to stop them is FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper
Perabo) who is a soft, squishy, lovey-dovey,
idealistic kind of gal.  She enlists the help of Rocky
(voiced, as in the original, by June Foray) and
Bullwinkle (voiced by Keith Scott), and together, they
try to save the world.  Their travels are filled with
absurd occurrences and pun-filled banter.  At one
point when the three are being approached by a group
of security guards, Sympathy yells, "we've got to get
out of here," to which Bullwinkle says, "OK, let's go
to a commercial!"  We see signs that point out places
such as the Crimea River, and we pay a visit to
Bullwinkle's alma mater, Wossamotta U.   All of this
silliness is fine up to a certain point, which is
about the first 20 minutes.  However, the novelty soon
wears thin.
Give credit, though, to the live cast members and all
of the cameos who deliver over-the-top acting to lend
to its cartoonish personality.  Especially good is
DeNiro who seemed to be having endless fun as Fearless
Leader.  He speaks with an almost-impenetrable accent
and even takes a turn at parodying the "you looking at
me" line made famous from his role in "Taxi Driver." 
Alas, "Rocky and Bullwinkle" just doesn't give even
the inner child in us enough to sustain an 85-minute
film.  The story just doesn't go anywhere and we start
to wonder if we're watching one of Fearless Leader's
RBTV programs.  There's a scene in this film that
pretty much sums up the film's viewing experience.  At
Wossamotta U., students are protesting during a speech
given by Bullwinkle.  However, his speech is so inane
that students find that they had nothing to object to.
 It's equally loony yet insipid, hollow yet harmless.

Review for Cookie's Fortune (1999)
The fine thing about being in a small town is exactly that.  It's
small, cozy and familiar.  We accept the charms and the peculiarities
of the citizens because that's what gives these kinds of small
communities a wonderful life of its own.  Take Holly Springs,
Mississippi, for example.  It's the kind of town where a murder suspect
gets one phone call, coffee, a copy of Field & Stream, and a friendly
game of Scrabble with the local officer and lawyer.  Also, everyone
within the community seems to be in the local church play.  There are
just so many likable people, and director Robert Altman lets us easily
slip a peek into the many lives of this town.
Most noteworthy is that of Willis (Charles S. Dutton).  He's a simple,
aging black man who wouldn't hurt a soul.  Sometimes he fishes and
other times he sneaks more than a few sips of whiskey.  But his true
devotion is to friend Cookie (a sweet-as-can-be Patricia Neal).  He
helps her with her errands and likes nothing better than to fix her
catfish fajitas.  But Cookie is aging rapidly, and painfully misses her
dear, departed husband.  Unable to bear her loneliness, she decides to
kill herself.
Camille (Glenn Close), Cookie's niece, first discovers the body.  She
is first shocked, but then outraged by her apparent suicide (`only
crazy people would commit suicide,' she blurts out).  She decides to
make the suicide look more like a murder.  With a few carefully placed
clues here and a few footprints there, Camille has effectively turned
this peaceful town upside down.  Once the news of this gets out, we
meet more of the pleasant townsfolk.  They include another niece, Cora
(Julianne Moore), grandniece Emma (Liv Tyler) and various other
unprepared-for-murder-in-my-small-town police officers, including
officers Boyle (Ned Beatty) and Brown (Chris O'Donnell).  More
disbelief occurs when circumstantial evidence points to Willis as the
killer.  He's innocent exclaims Boyle.  How does he know?  Well, as he
puts it: `I fish with him.'
Cookie's Fortune isn't a murder mystery, and it isn't about one batty
woman's attempt to salvage the dignity of the family name, as Camille
would have you believe.  Rather, Cookie's tragedy serves as a way for
the movie to highlight the close-knit nature and the colorful
characters that populate this small town.  We like Willis and find
humor in the laid-back attitudes of the citizens.  We like Liv Tyler as
a trampy vagabond who would rather skin catfish than do something
better with her life.  There are also the owners of a blues bar who
exude radiance and a profound yet simple wisdom.  They don't say much,
but know quite a bit.  Consider this film something of a church social
where everyone you meet has an interesting story to tell.


Title
Review for Pearl Harbor (2001)
"Pearl Harbor"  Ambitious Plans, Fair Results
If "Pearl Harbor" were released at any other time
during the year, this film would at best be considered
a thin offering that's often more banal than moving. 
It's oversimplified perspective on history and it's
underdeveloped cast of characters never adequately
portrayed the stark realities of war, the strains of
rivalry, the importance of camaraderie, the glory of
love, or the necessity of sacrifice.  
But it's the summertime and we crave special
effects-laden movies.  Thus with a theme that mixes
war, love, and glory and the multitude of impressive
dogfights and battle sequences, there's plenty to keep
people seated through the 3-hour film.  Seated yes,
riveted no. 
After watching this film with my best friend (Daniel
Scher) and my roommate (Ming Shih), I was intrigued to
learn that we all came away with similar reasons to
applaud the movie and similar reservations as well. 
This is interesting to note because Daniel prefers
dramas, Ming favors love stories, and I like anything
that gives me an excuse to sip soda.  So, no matter
what you look for in a film, you will probably note
these observations as well.
Of distinction was the ambitiousness of this project
and its epic feel, which seemed to pull ideas from
films like "Titanic," "Saving Private Ryan," and "Top
Gun."  The central story of love and friendship is
told against the backdrop of WWII.  Our likeable
patriotic flyboys, Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and
Josh Hartnett), battle each other for the love of
dedicated nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsdale).  The
stability of their friendship, however, may be as
fragile as chances for peace with Japan in late 1941. 
With its high production values, the film ably evoked
America's image as a society of 'weaklings and
playboys,' the frenzied atmosphere of trying to
ascertain Japanese fleet movement, and the imminent
danger that lied ahead.  Most stirring were the
moments leading up to the fateful sneak attack as
dozens of Japanese squadrons flew toward their
military targets unnoticed by American listening
posts.  FDR's (Jon Voight) emotional appeals for
action were also moving.  And the film incorporated
black and white camerawork to give the imagery an
added sense of realism.
However, our chief reservation was that its tone was
noticeably indecisive, flirting between an epic love
story and war film.  The story about friendship and
sacrifice could have stood on its own without the
clutter of war.  But with the haze of combat, it
became unclear what happened to many of the
interesting secondary characters.  Most shameful,
though, was the weak segment on Dorie Miller (Cuba
Gooding Jr.), a real-life cook who manned a gun during
the Pearl Harbor attack to defend his ship, and who
was the first colored man to receive the Navy Cross.  
Actually, the whole Pearl Harbor sequence did nothing
to advance the story and at the very least, seemed out
of place.  It does not succeed in establishing any
tone or groundwork for some future occurrence.  This
could have been spliced out and made into its own IMAX
feature.  Meanwhile, much of the other war aspects was
heavily sanitized to gain a mass audience-accessible
rating of PG-13.  As such, this component lacked soul.
At times, the movie achieved some majestic and
poignant highs.  At other times, the syrupy Harlequinn
Romance dialogue and music brought it to embarrassing
lows. For several of you, this may be a time that
tries mens' souls.  But the overall effort is
certainly worth a matinee ticket and a bucket of
popcorn.

Review for Night at the Roxbury, A (1998)
Well, as I check my score card for what I've done this holiday
weekend, it reads Good Ideas: 0 and Dumb Ideas: 1.  I don't know what
I was thinking when I decided to watch this movie.  But in my defense,
I can only say that it was SOMEONE ELSE who urged me to see this with
him.  The film that I'm talking about is `A Night at the Roxbury,' one
of those offerings based on a Saturday Night Live skit.  
Wayne and Garth, these two are not.  Rather, we meet Doug and Steve
Butabi (the actors' names are not worth mentioning), two eternal
partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to
get into the hottest night club in the city, the Roxbury.  Driving in
their dad's BMW and donning metallic disco suits right out of Miami
Vice, they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club.  `Have you
met my friend Washington and his friend Roosevelt,' they confidently
say as they pull out spare pocket change.  Their second greatest
ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick-up lines as is
humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl (`Let me
see that label.  Just as I thought - made in heaven,' says one of the
brothers).  And, like the losers that they are, they fail to do either
for much of the film.
However, as fate would have it, an accidental meeting with
`what-ever-happened-to' Richard Grieco gives them the all-important
ticket to get in.  Their sad lives take on a whole new direction. 
They make an important contact with the club owner who believes that
these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene.  And they
are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women.  But
their newfound popularity does not impress their father, who has other
plans for them.
The unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one-joke
movie, and the brothers are the joke.  Actually, there's about 10
mintues worth of tolerable stuff.  Alas, too long for TV and way too
short for a feature-length film.  Thus, there just isn't enough
material to sustain the 83-minute movie.  There's no plot to be found
and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity
to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to
the funky beat of Haddaway's europop song, What Is Love.  I was amazed
that none of the two suffered from whiplash.  To take up more film
time, there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman
next door who wants to marry Doug.  This creates not only friction
between the brothers, but their unlikely pairing will also agitate
audience members as well.  She's educated and a forebearing witch. 
Meanwhile, Doug is a complete loser.  How did these two ever get
together?   I suppose that if I can ever figure out the answer to that
question, I'll have figured out why I decided to go and see this
movie.  If you're looking for entertainment, you won't find it at the
Roxbury.


Title
Review for Pitch Black (2000)
In the opening scene of "Pitch Black," an interstellar
transport ship with dozens of passengers that are in
cryo-sleep pods, runs into a devastating meteor
shower.  The ship is skewered and casualties are
heavy.  Fry (Radha Mitchell), the only surviving
crewmember, tries to attempt a crash landing on a
desolate planet.  She frantically works the controls
as the ship careens out-of-control towards the
planet's surface.  The opening scene is frenetic and
successfully establishes its pace.  And I'm enjoying
the ride.
Ten people are lucky enough to survive the spectacular
crash landing.  But they may regret their seemingly
good fortune when they discover that the planet is an
arid ball of sand.  Worse, they learn that
subterranean Pterydactol-resembling aliens inhabit it.
 With raptor-sized teeth and claws that can easily rip
apart flesh, it's a good thing that these aliens don't
come to the surface because they can't stand sunlight.
  Even luckier for these marooned travelers, this
planet's system has three suns, which provides
perpetual daylight.  Well, at least that's what they
think.  Soon, their situation gets increasingly dark,
and they'll need to work quickly to get off the
planet.  Otherwise, they'll all become alien bird
feed.
Sci-fi movies in the style of "Alien" (and that's
exactly what this is) follows a familiar formula.  And
"Pitch Black" stays true to the blueprint.  You can
expect several of the survivors to be killed off (and
it's usually the characters that either panic and run,
wander off into the night by themselves, or the
inconsequential characters that we don't really care
about).   You can expect a modicum of tense moments as
the aliens close in.  And, you can expect a mad dash
at the end as the survivors grittily make their way to
the final destination in a final attempt to escape. 
Indeed, the last twenty minutes offer a satisfying
finish.
But what makes this a little meatier than other films
of this type are the human-interest stories.  One
involves Riddick (Vin Diesel), a vicious murderer that
was being transported to a prison.  As a result of the
crash, he has now awakened from his cryogenic slumber.
 He feels nothing for the other survivors or their
perilous situation and only wants to escape.  He is
incredibly cunning and possesses an acute sense of
smell and the ability to see at night.  He may be even
more dangerous than the predators that live beneath
the planet's surface.  The other features the feisty
Fry who is referred to as "Captain" by the survivors,
but is unable to cope with her responsibility and the
burden of saving everyone.
"Pitch Black" also manages to satisfy on the visual
level.  Bleached hues accentuate their desolation and
camera views are frequently seen through the infrared
eyesight of Riddick, which adds color and beauty to
the events happening on screen.  The component about
this film that was most underwhelming, however, was
the aliens themselves.  In a genre where there is no
limit to creativity, these aliens looked inexplicably
ordinary.  
Although I enjoyed this offering (and probably much
more than I had originally anticipated), this film's
life span may be as short as some of the victims of
the film.  I say that because there are no big stars
to attract anyone's attention, and if you've seen
other sci-fi films about people-as-alien-fodder, then
you'll probably think that you're experiencing a
2-hour case of deja vu.  But "Pitch Black" does offer
interesting story lines, a varied spectrum of likable
personalities, and the enjoyable sensation of seeing
who will survive and who won't.  With a sustained
atmosphere of suspense and just the right amount of
pace, this film is a good choice for the weekend
moviegoer in search of some entertainment.

Review for Stigmata (1999)
My friends will tell you that I'm not very religious.  I'm not an avid
churchgoer, and I'm sure that there is much that I will have to atone
for when I am finally reviewed for entry at the Pearly Gates.  Saint
Peter will probably ask me how much I know about the teachings of
Jesus, to which my answer will undoubtedly disappoint the heavenly
gatekeeper.  But despite my lack of faith, I DO know that the
scriptwriters of `Stigmata' will be taking the express elevator to that
other place because this film, based deeply on some Christian
underpinnings, recklessly throws away any semblance of theology out the
window.
The first such absurd example involves some rosary beads that contain a
supernatural spirit.  Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) receives this
as a gift from Mom who bought it on the streets of a small Brazilian
town.  Frankie lives a normal stress-free life comprised of days
piercing nipples at her beauty salon and nights hanging out with her
girlfriends at the local clubs.  But soon after the receipt of her
gift, horrifying and unexplainable phenomenon begins to happen.  First,
holes mysteriously appear in her wrists as if something had driven a
stake through it.  She is rushed to the hospital where the doctors
think that she is suicidal.  A few days go by and some unseen force
severely lashes her back.  The doctors have no rational explanation. 
These events catch the attention of the Vatican who dispatches Father
Andrew (Gabriel Byrne) to investigate.  His sole purpose is to disprove
so-called miracles.  He is extremely skeptical about Frankie because
she is a self-professed atheist.  However, when the next miracle occurs
(her forehead is mysteriously slashed), he tells her of the Stigmata.
Father Andrew explains that experiencing the Stigmata is like a
miraculous gift from God.  Jesus suffered these exact same wounds. 
There were five wounds in all, including the staking of the feet and a
spear through the body.  `But Jesus died,' Frankie blurts out.  `Can I
give these gifts back,' she asks?  I would think that having such a
gift, though obviously painful, would be glorious and inspiring.  But
the movie portrays this as some sort of dark, demonic possession. 
Frankie (or actually the spirit that possesses her) begins to madly
etch out incomprehensible symbols and speak in a deep satanic voice. 
Both of these, we are told, are Aramaic, a long-forgotten dialect used
in the time of Jesus.  What is she writing?  What is she saying?  Are
these the actual words of Christ?
At this point, a new plot develops that takes this film in a completely
new direction.  Upon learning of this new development, the Vatican
leaders (headed by Jonathan Pryce) tell Father Andrew to conclude his
investigation immediately.  They are afraid of something and take it
into their own hands to address the issue of Frankie's miracles. 
Father Andrew, however, is determined to know the truth.  Think X-Files
where the enemy is the Vatican.
Does any of this make sense?  Well, if you were confused about religion
before, this can only add fuel to the fire.  It thinks that rosary
beads can contain spirits, it confuses miracles with possession, and it
portrays the Vatican as the instrument of an ongoing conspiracy.  I
also found this movie irritating in many ways.  I especially disliked
the sequences when she experienced Stigmata, which I though was
needlessly bloody and overly dramatic.  I also didn't care for the
accompanying sound effects which were grating and used exaggerated
noises (honking of horns, fluttering of wings) to try to add tension. 
There are some good ideas at work here including very nice
cinematography and grounding Frankie in a blue-collar atmosphere to
show that miracles can happen to the most common of folk.  But her role
is simply impossible and this film doesn't convince us that it is a
drama or a thriller or anything else other than something that is
masquerading as a horror film.

Review for Deep Rising (1998)
If you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you
long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn (butter optional),
then this is the movie for you!  Indeed, this has got to be either one
of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies, or
an incredibly unfunny spoof of them.  It's difficult to fathom such
insipidness unless you actually watch this film.  But at least we're
warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase, giving us
an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show.
What are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie?  First,
the movie gives us an introductory premise.  Huge caverns exist deep
beneath the ocean floor, and in this area, many ships have
disappeared.  Oooh...scary!  Secondly, a cheesy soundtrack tries to
connote a tone of mystery, but only succeeds in drowning our ears with
an abrasive musical score.  Third, the main character is a mercenary
that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo
(Treat Williams).  He operates a sophisticated military-style PT boat
and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical
flippancy.  Finally, in the cargo hold, we see those that hired him.
They are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts, talk with
accents, and try to show how macho they are.
During their trip across the stormy sea, their boat suffers an
incident and requires repairs.  Spotting a cruise ship in the
distance, they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to
raid the machine shop, take the parts that they need, and then
continue on their merry way.  Little do they know that this cruise
ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster.  Yet, they
board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that
can kill dozens in a matter of seconds.
This is nothing more than a by-the-book action film.  Their
realization of the situation that they're in doesn't happen until they
are in the bowels of the boat.  Those who are dumb enough to stray off
on their own will ultimately get killed.  The corridors on the ship
are narrow, misty, and provide the kind of atmosphere that all
scare-fests must have. Yet, despite the predictable nature of this
film, there are some scary "boo" moments.  But most of it is just
outright silly.  And this film is unusually gory too.  Monsters
basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains.  There is
one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and
reveals a victim that is still alive.  He screams horribly as the
monster's digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away.
Additionally, it borrows heavily from Speed2, Alien and a bunch of
other recent films.  The mercenaries even run into a lone, surviving
passenger (Femke Jannsen) who looks amazingly like Sandra Bullock.
To be honest, when I left the theatre, I just had to laugh at how
witless the film was.  It's moronic fun at best.  So, if you're
hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of
silliness, then this might just hit the spot.

Review for Serendipity (2001)
Did you ever make eye contact with a total stranger 
and feel that a mysterious connection had been 
established?  Do you think that fate has a funny way 
of bringing people together (or keeping them apart)? 
Do you believe in magic?  If you've answered "yes" to 
all of these questions, then you'll be happy to 
discover "Serendipity" at your local cineplex.  It's a 
delightful romantic comedy about two lovable people 
destined to be with each other. 
When Jonathan (Jon Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsdale) 
first met, they had felt that mysterious connection. 
They first bumped into each in the days before 
Christmas.  With the holiday cheer wafting through the 
air, a lively Louis Armstrong soundtrack in the 
background, and their instant chemistry, audience 
members immediately want them to get under the 
mistletoe.  She writes down her name and number on a 
scrap of paper.  But as she hands it to him, a sudden 
wind carries it away.  Jonathan says to ignore that 
occurrence, but Sara says that it's a sign.  
Indeed, fate has a funny way of keeping people apart. 
To her, this means something.  Still, she's willing to 
give it one more chance, and writes her number inside 
the cover of a book.  Tomorrow she'll sell it, and 
maybe one day he'll find it somewhere at a local 
bookstore.  Meanwhile, she asks him to write his 
number on the back of a $5 bill.  She spends it but 
says that if things are meant to be, the bill will 
wind up in her hands again.  "How can you leave it all 
to chance," Jonathan asks incredulously?  "Have faith 
in destiny," she replies.  Sadly, the two separate and 
the chances of them ever finding each other are as 
likely as winning the Powerball. 
Years later, we see Jonathan engaged.  But he still 
looks through used bookstores every now and then. 
Meanwhile Sara is also engaged.  Yet she occasionally 
flips through her wallet for $5 bills.  Even apart, 
these two exude undeniable romantic tension.  And, 
when both of them realize that they need to find each 
other, the audience (those who believe in romance and 
magic) is ready to follow them to the ends of the 
earth. 
Fate begins to play funny tricks on these two as they 
begin an Agatha Christie-like pursuit for one another, 
tracking down years-old leads and falling back on gut 
feelings. They experience a series of cosmic 
coincidences, parallels, and agonizing near-misses. 
Maybe they are destined to be with each othermaybe 
not. 
While this so-close-yet-so-far setup will strike a 
chord with the romantic-at-heart, most would still 
appreciate the film's other element about best 
friends.  When times are confusing, best friends help 
to provide light.  Sara's friend, down-to-earth Eve 
(Molly Shannon), tries to convince her that she's on a 
wild goose chase to find a stranger that she only met 
briefly.  Jonathan's friend, 
I'll-do-anything-in-the-name-of-love Dean (Jeremy 
Priven), encourages his friend because this element is 
missing from his relationship.  We can all relate to 
Eve and Dean; we all need more friends like them.  And 
we can enjoy this pleasant film because it makes us 
believe that there is someone out there for all of us. 
 Ain't the universe grand?

Review for Devil's Advocate, The (1997)
As a hot-shot defense attorney, Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) has a special
talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients.  He
is also an excellent judge of character, knowing just which strings to
pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging
witness's testimony.  And, on top of that, he's a damn good trial
lawyer.  In the opening scene, it is obvious that the defendant that he
represents is guilty, but it doesn't hamper Lomax's desire to creatively
squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt, thereby
getting an acquittal.
His unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one
of the most prestigious firms in the country, headed by John Milton (Al
Pacino).  He is brought to their headquarters in NYC, where he
immediately impresses Milton, and is subsequently offered a full-time
position as head of their newly-created criminal law division.  Lomax is
soon given the case of his life.  He must defend a real estate tycoon
who has been charged with a triple homicide.  The draw of fame and his
desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his
own hell.  He works late, defends the guilty, pledges his soul to his
firm, and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife, Mary Ann
(Charlize Theron).  
But what starts off as a promising John Grisham-like story about
conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural
forces begin to tinker with the story.  It begins like a typical parable
where a small-town boy makes it big, but then has to balance his sense
of self against the allure of money, power, and greed.  But Milton is
far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm.   Quite literally, he
is the Devil in disguise, and as the movie progresses, he reveals some
uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long
ago.  Freaky and frightening things begin to happen, and after much of
the film has elasped, Milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed.
The movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts.  The first
involves the comeuppance of Lomax as a big-city trial lawyer.  The
second focuses on Milton and his ulterior motive for employing Lomax.
Unfortunately, the two never mix well into a cohesive story, and what we
get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky
revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to
give it an underlying atmosphere.  Granted, the film is very
handsome-looking.  You'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural
seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by Pacino.  You'll
also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the
fleshy and flashy parties.   You'll also feel the loneliness and
insanity that sets in with Mary Ann, knowing that her husband is slowly
drifting away.  This was one of the better storylines, but
unfortunately, is only a sub-plot.  
As with all thing's involving the Devil, you can expect nothing but the
worst.  In the first few scenes, Reeves anchors the film, but then
slowly drifts into the background.  His path from self-vanity to
self-consciousness is never fully explored.  His actions seem arbitrary,
and his reasons for them not fully known.  Pacino's comical portrayal is
spirited, but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of
the movie.  There is another plot or two that is introduced, but never
gets revisited.  The focus seemed inconsistent throughout, and the final
payoff seemed quick and cheap.  This movie tries to be horrifying,
thrilling, and dramatic all at the same time.  However, while The
Devil's Advocate strives to get noticed, ultimately it makes very little
impression at all.

Title
Review for Bulworth (1998)
Brash and rude, yet refreshingly funny, "Bulworth", is an usual film
about an unusual politician who decides to do something drastic about
his tumultuous career as an incumbent Senator.  With the election just
about a week away, Jay Bulworth (Warren Beatty) grows noticeably weary
of his life and his career.  Big money from special interest groups have
long guided his career towards an undesirable destination, far from the
original ideals that put this man in public office.   Bulworth promotes
family values in his campaign commercials, but his wife is having an
affair while his daughter shows no interest in his political career.
Politics have become a fiasco.  On top of that, he has lost his fortune
in a risky investment.  As his zest for life and politics fades, he
stops sleeping and eating.  He is on the verge of a nervous breakdown,
and takes out a contract on his own life. 
Knowing that he has only a limited time to live, he embarks on the last
leg of his campaign.  With a renewed sense of freedom, he dispatches
with his old, dry speeches and begins to tell it like it is, off the
cuff and in your face.  At a black church, he shocks the audience by
telling them that no one cares about their plight because they don't
contribute to his campaign.  At a private party of movie-making
contributors, he tells them that their products are 'crap'.  His
behavior causes his aide, Dennis Murphy (Oliver Platt), to go ballistic
as he tries to apply spin control to this volatile situation.  Platt
makes a very funny sidekick as all of his attempts to guide the Senator
back to normalcy are ignored.  
Meanwhile, the Senator's raw stance has attracted a group of black
females, including Nina (Halle Berry), a smart girl from the 'hood' who
is very versed in the urban plight.  She brings him into South Central
where he gets a first hand look at those that need the most help from
city officials but are frequently overlooked in favor of other groups
that line the politicians' pockets with money.  In this 'hood', he is
approached by crack-selling 10-year olds and is introduced to their
boss, played by Don Cheadle.  He gives a nice performance explaining how
the ignorance of the outside world has created an illegal yet viable
economy within this community.  
Bulworth is a smart Senator and knows that the only way to ignite
progress is to create a stronger core and to let the positive effects
trickle outwards.  In one of the best scenes, he is interviewed on
television and begins to vent his frustrations through rapping.  Wearing
a ski cap, sunglasses, and hip-hop baggy shorts, he angrily states that
the real obscenity is not his cursing or his recent raw behavior.  The
real obscenity is the shabby political system that's currently in place
which fails to protect and pull along those that rightfully need the
help.  His observations are insightful, and the story is the most funny
when he shows his irreverence towards those that support him as he
becomes the model of political incorrectness.  Edgy and smart, the film
hits the ground running and doesn't stop its manic pace until the very
end.  Beatty has given himself a role that he can bite into.  It is a
sharp satire on the state of American politics, and we can feel its bite
as well.

Title
Review for Ronin (1998)
Rober DeNiro plays Sam, a man who never walks into a place he doesn't
know how to walk out of.'  As a former operative, he is cunning in his
approach, skilled at hunting his prey, and is now a
mercenary-for-hire.  He has just been given a job to steal a
mysterious suitcase.  To pull off this heist, however, he'll need at
least a few other specialists including international stars Jean Reno
and Stellan Skarsgard.  They painstaking plot out their attack plan,
scope out their targets and develop escape routes.  They position
themselves carefully and work together to execute a flawless heist. 
Or is it flawless?  
"Ronin" is a cloak-and-dagger thriller marked by beautiful French
locales, hidden agendas, double-crosses, secretive employers, and
intense car chases.  In fact, the strongest asset of this film is the
incredible car chases that could easily be considered some of the best
car chase sequences EVER shot on film (and certainly the best that
I've ever seen), which takes them through crowded downtown streets and
through oncoming highway traffic. I also liked DeNiro's almost deadpan
approach to his task and his sense of cold, professional detachment. 
This is a man that focuses solely on his mission. Everything else,
such as his possible attraction for one of his employers or even his
bullet wounds, is just an afterthought.  
"Ronin" doesn't fail to generate suspense.  Yet, despite this being a
competent production, this film winds up leaving a dry taste in your
mouth, and I kept thinking that there was a better movie in here
somewhere.  What happened?  Because the plot is so thin, we begin to
shift our attention to the characters.  However, these professional
killers were so icy cold in nature that a real sense of drama couldn't
be generated.  Also, as the film developed, several other people who
are interested in the contents of the suitcase are introduced, which
made the film a bit confusing.  There are some great gun battles and
chase scenes and I thought that it was really cool how these
professionals could maintain control throughout their frenetic
situations.  But the detached feeling of the film deprived me of the
enjoyment of rooting for the hero and muted the sadness that I might
have otherwise felt for a fallen team member.   "Ronin" could have
been pared down by about 20 minutes, which would have made this more
taut and enjoyable.  As it stands, it came across as somewhat uneven
and lengthy although I thought that there was enough here to merit a
recommendation.

Review for Enemy at the Gates (2001)
Originally, this film about a legendary showdown
between two snipers during a pivotal WWII event was
going to be released in the late 2000 movie season,
with the hope that it would capture the attention of
Oscar voters.  Luckily, the studio decided to nix that
idea.  It would have been bombed had it gone up
against such late-year gems as "Thirteen Days" or
"Crouching Tiger."  However, against the current
dearth of good films, "Enemy at the Gates" may emerge
with only a flesh wound.
That's not to say that this is a good film.  It's
quite mediocre and frequently dull.  The only 'award'
that this film deserves is the 'most awkward and
laughable sex scene.'   In a bunker while resting
between battles, our hero and heroine share a romantic
moment.  But they're covered with grime while dozens
of snoring soldiers lie next to them like sardines. 
Who wants to watch that?
Set during 1941, the brutal Nazi juggernaut was
swiftly advancing towards Moscow.  A key offensive in
the city of Stalingrad would help to determine the
fate of this country.  Morale among the Russian troops
was waning.  To reinvigorate their forces, propaganda
officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) thinks that writing
about Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) would provide that
needed boost.  He's someone with whom most Russians
could relate.  He comes from a poor family, lived his
young life as a shepherd boy, and loves his
motherland.  Moreover, he's a gifted marksman. 
Danilov's stories resonate among the soldiers while
Zaitsev continues to record more and more kills.
The Nazi's take notice and send Major Konig (Ed
Harris), a decorated sharpshooter, to track down and
kill Zaitsev.  Our hero is earnest, humble, and
struggles with his daily survival.  Meanwhile, Konig
is a cunning tactician.  This encounter should be one
of the most suspenseful components of the film.  But
there's little interaction between the two, diffusing
much of the tension.  Instead of hunting each other
down, they prefer to hide and await a clear shot. 
There is only one exciting sequence where they square
off in a factory.  But most of the time, it's either
Zaitsev or Konig looking for each other through the
scopes of their guns amidst grim battlefields of
fallen warriors or the bombed out remnants of war-torn
buildings.  Konig is sadly underdeveloped, and the
role is essentially wasted on the gifted Harris (who
is a Best Actor contender at this year's Oscars). 
This chess match promised more than it could deliver.
More interesting was that Zaitsev was not just waging
a military battle but a personal one as well.  He is
ill-equipped to handle the weight of his expectations.
 Meanwhile, with Konig looking for him, he jeopardizes
the lives of his comrades.  Some, including another
sniper that tries to set a trap for Konig and a very
young boy who gets to know both snipers, are
memorable.  They both want to help but can't fully
appreciate the looming dangers.  However, his romantic
interest for a fellow female soldier (Rachel Weisz)
was distracting at best.
Unfortunately, it's a film that's epic in thought but
somewhat ignoble in deed.  The battle sequences were
somewhat murky and confusing, the romantic subplot was
needless, and the cat-and-mouse chase between the two
snipers lacked zip.  War, sometimes, is truly Hell.

Title
Review for Men in Black (1997)
Did you ever wonder if Dennis Rodman was actually from this planet?  Or   
if Sylvester Stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial?  I used   
to think that about my 7th grade English teacher, Ms. Carey.  But after   
seeing this movie, they may have confirmed my suspicions.
As the story goes, at any time, there are over a thousand aliens living   
among us here on Earth.  The Men in Black  (MiB) are the watchdogs that   
oversee the cosmic citizens, guardians of our beloved planet from   
nasty-tempered aliens, and secret service to the stars.  Based in New   
York City (where weird is the norm), the MiB organization gives  human   
form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among   
us unnoticed.  But to enforce the laws of Earth, the MiB carry weapons   
that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one   
single blast.  They carry other-worldly technology to erase people's   
short-term memory when common folk see the MiB in action.  And their best   
leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids.
Little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v. evil   
going on in the depths of space.  One of the aliens-as-human on this   
planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious.   
 It holds the 'key', literally, to universal peace.  A giant   
cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this 'key'.   
 In the wrong alien hands (flippers? mandibles? tentacles?), it can be   
used as a weapon.  Therefore, it must be recovered and returned to it's   
rightful owners.  Otherwise, to ensure universal safety, Earth will be   
destroyed, along with the 'key'.  Now, it's the MiB who must prevent this   
catastrophe.  The MiB agents on the case are "K", played by Tommy Lee   
Jones.  He is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than Al   
Gore.  The stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes.  He is   
accompanied by a flippant rookie, "J", played by Will Smith.
But, despite this shoot-em-up, protect-Earth-from-destruction premise,   
this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie.  And, this   
isn't an Independence Day knockoff.  Rather, this is a stylishly offbeat   
sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies Í that   
there are real aliens that live here, and that the government does its   
darndest to cover them up.  But to give it some sense of excitement and   
to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe, there must   
be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario.
Yet, this movie is very appealing.   The abundance of wierdness (talking   
aliens, pee-wee atomizers, a mortician who 'lives' for her work, and lots   
of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore), is played straight, like as   
if this were normal (of course, we are in NYC).  It gives it a deadpan   
feel, which makes it all the more funnier and odder.  Jones plays the   
venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity.  Smith is   
likeable and makes a great comic partner to Jones' straight man routine.   
 They click like Dorothy's ruby red shoes.  The look and feel of the   
movie is made even better with direction from Barry Sonnenfeld (The   
Addam's Family). This guy has a knack for 'gothic' comedy, and   
successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen.  And,   
an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of   
their task without diverting attention from the human actors.  The story   
moves well, and before you know it, the end credits are already rolling!   
 The result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of Ewwwws and   
Blechhhs, Aaaahhhs and Wows.  Let the Men in Black protect and color your   
world.

Title
Review for Swordfish (2001)
"Swordfish," a sometimes-explosive high-tech thriller,
will hook you  but only for its first 15 minutes. 
Its opening is a captivating hostage sequence in which
police and SWAT teams tragically underestimate the
fortitude of the cunning Gabriel (John Travolta).  He
is a villain who will not hesitate to sacrifice
innocent lives or even his own to pull off an
improbable heist.  The events that unfold during these
taut opening minutes are mesmerizing with effects that
easily outdo key scenes from "The Matrix" in
presentation and intensity.
After that, however, its creativity and pace start to
sputter.  It then begins to regress into a generic,
albeit flashy, shoot-em-up action flick.  Bullets fly
and cars explode while the body count rises.  But its
biggest casualty, unfortunately, is the story, which
amounts to a tepid heist flick wrapped in some cheeky
banter and black humor.
At least John Travolta looks quite comfortable as the
megalomaniacal villain.  He swaggers with bravado,
sports a tough-guy haircut and chin hair, and projects
an aura of hipness and fear.  From his exotic sports
cars to his mountaintop villa to his gaggle of
beautiful girls, he lives a life that other men can
only dream about.  His lifestyle, however, does not
come about from a lack of ambition or from a lack of
ruthlessness.  
For his next big job, he plans to steal $9 billion
from a federal drug fund, but will need to recruit a
crack computer hacker.  With the help of his prurient
assistant, Ginger (Halle Berry), Gabriel tries to
enlist Stan (Hugh Jackman), an ex-con whose previous
successful assault on an FBI database sent him to jail
and also caused him to lose custody of his daughter. 
Stan has no desire to return to prison and only wishes
to be rejoined with his daughter.  But for a fee of
$10 million, which will more than pay for the lawyers
needed to win custody, how can our hacker refuse?  
Berry also does good things as the sexy moll who may
be more than she seems under those skin-tight dresses.
 She uses her siren-like charms to keep Stan focused
on his task and exudes a confidence that makes her
topless scene just an extension of her self-assurance
rather than something gratuitous.
Jackman, however, is absolutely listless.  His scenes
with his daughter don't strike up any poignant
emotions, and his brooding demeanor that gained him
much notice in "X-Men" has been replaced with silly,
self-congratulatory gyrations as he moves closer to
developing a program to break through the firewall
security codes.   Sadly, his on-screen time consists
mostly of incredibly fast typing and keyboard
clattering.  
Another annoying issue is that as a tech-driven film,
computer jargon and graphics are heavily used. 
There's a lot of focus on Stan's computer screens as
words like 'port scan' and 'crypto algorithm' flash
about.  It may look cool, but it doesn't really tell a
story.  
Completely underutilized, however, is Don Cheadle who
plays the federal agent trying to track Gabriel down. 
His look of concern may be that of a detective who
knows that Gabriel is capable of mass destruction. 
Or, he may just be worried that he'll be playing the
role of effete cops for the rest of his career.
"Swordfish" is ultimately just a glossy but somewhat
hollow production.  Aside from its whiz-bang
beginning, it only manages to be an undistinguished,
bullet-ridden thriller.  

Title
Review for Antz (1998)
It's tough to be an ant.  Laboring constantly can be a real drag,
especially when you have to lift ten times your weight.  Your career
path ultimately leads you to that of a 'soil relocation engineer.' 
And it's really tough being the middle child of five million.  "What
about my individual needs," asks Z (voiced by Woody Allen).  Sorry,
but like all other ants, you're insignificant.  Z is determined to
find his true place.  He knows that he's not destined to be a worker
who lives his life moving the earth.  But his quest will forever move
the colony in whole new direction.  
"ANTZ" is a cute and astonishing visual piece of work that shows how
Z, with the help of some very unlikely allies, rises from a sea of
anonymity and uses his fame to revolutionize the colony.  In a chance
meeting, he encounters Princess Bala (voiced by Sharon Stone) who
inspires him to act freely and to buck the system.  He relies on his
long-time friend Weaver (voiced by Sylvester Stallone) to help him
pursue his fantasy of uniting with the untouchable Princess.  He is
moved by a heroic warrior ant (voiced by Danny Glover) that encourages
him to think for himself.  And he is curious to know what lies outside
the colony and is determined to find a fabled place called Insectopia
where complete freedom awaits.  However, his new-found desire for
independence causes a stir within the colony and arouses the ire of
General Mandible (voiced by Gene Hackman).  Mandible is plotting
something nefarious, but Z's influence and popularity threatens his
success.
For the most part, I enjoyed this movie, but mostly because of the
terrific animation. The creators waste no time trying to impress us
with the visuals and show us a very modern and thriving
metropolis-like colony bustling with activity.  Other impressive
sequences involve Z trying to hold on to dear life when he hitches a
ride on the shoelaces of someone's sneaker.  and an incredible epic
battle pitting the ants versus enemy termites.   The story surrounding
megalomaniacal Mandible and his plan was more interesting, however,
than Z's quest to find himself.  Partially it was because I became
increasingly annoyed with Z's Woody Allen-esque banter, which amounted
to a lot of self-doubting and mumbling.  But this is a story that is
fun to watch and brimming with clever ideas about ants and what they
can do.  If you can spare an hour-and-a-half of your time, march on
over and check out this picnic of a film.


Title
Review for Patch Adams (1998)
Hunter `Patch' Adams could probably be considered something of a
pioneer during his day.  He was a knowledgeable doctor for sure.  He
tried to introduce into the world of medicine at that time something
called TLC  tender loving care.  Appalled by the snobbery and the
holier-than-thou attitudes that many doctors exhibited, Patch tried to
develop a bond with those that he treated.  It was a bond that went
beyond the traditional doctor-patient relationship that stretched into
unconditional friendship.  As he put it, `if you treat the disease,
you win, you lose.  You treat the patient andyou'll win every time.'
`Patch Adams' (starring Robin Williams) is based on the true story of
this compassionate medicine man.  We learn about the turning point in
his life that redirects him towards the field of medicine.  We
accompany him to medical school and familiarize ourselves with the
obstacles that try to sway his optimism such as his competitive
roommate and a militaristic college Dean who doesn't accept his kind
of enthusiasm.  We also see that which inspires him.  These include a
budding romantic interest, the support of a meek but loyal friend,
and, of course, the anticipation of finally being able to treat
patients with his own special brand of TLC.  It is a noble ideal
indeed, but while Patch himself has a big heart, this film seems to be
missing one.  Of course, he acts like a clown and tear ducts will
begin to fill when he bonds with several children suffering from
cancer.  And there is an extremely funny scene involving a convention
of OB/GYNs, which I dare not say anymore about.  But all good stories
about battling the system' must have some evidence of drama as well
as some kind of seemingly insurmountable obstacle.  This is especially
true when any movie incorporates a pivotal courtroom scene, which this
one has.  Instead, what we get is Robin Williams acting coy and
innocent while hamming it up just before the movie goes into a lull. 
What was most odd was that not once do we see Williams's character
actually practice any medicine.  That seemed like a big element that
should have been incorporated.
When I walked out of the theatre, I couldn't help but draw a
comparison between this movie and another film/tv show that
successfully combined grit, humor and medicine.  Remember M*A*S*H? 
You'll probably see more than just a passing resemblance when you
think about the doctor that never seemed to take things seriously, a
snooty roommate from the upper class, a cold-as-ice female colleague,
and a timid supporter.  Still, I will tip my hat to the real `Patch'
for making the inroads that he did.  Anyone who can remove the pall of
indifference from a doctor's waiting room deserves a salute.

Review for L.A. Confidential (1997)
The seasoned Capt. Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) questions his new
protege, Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) about his political views when it comes
to police work.  "Would you plant evidence to get a conviction if you
knew the person to be guilty?  Would you shoot a man in the back if you
knew that it was the only way to make sure he got what he deserved?"
Exley, squeaky clean, innocent, and pent with the desire to perform his
new duties with integrity and honesty quickly answers with a pointed
'no.'  Stunned, Smith pleads, "Then, for the love of God, don't be a
detective."
LA Confidential is a dandy piece of filmmaking that brings us back to
the classic times of Hollywood in the 50s.  Organized crime was the
biggest concern, corruption existed everywhere, and every cop had his
own way of getting the job done.  There was "Hollywood" Jack Vincennes
(Kevin Spacey) who gets most of his information from the editor of a
sleazy tell-all/show-all tabloid, Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito).  Sporting
dark sunglasses and a white sports coat, he isn't afraid to flash his
tinseltown style.  Detective Bud White (Russell Crowe) has only a
narrow-minded view of the law, and he uses excessive force to exact his
unique kind of interrogation and brutal justice.  And then there is
golden boy Exley, wide-eyed and ambitious but extremely naive.
A horrible multiple murder begins to draw these three men together, each
of whom become inexorably connected  in their search for truth, action,
and personal vindication.  Almost immediately, an arrest is made.  But
something doesn't seem quite right.  New developments become sinuous as
the story begins to draw us deeper into the labyrinth of corruption and
crime within the department.  Suspicion and questions begin to mount.
Odd alliances are created.  And as layers of the truth become revealed,
the story grows more complex and intriguing by the moment.  When the
mystery expands, we see other seemingly guilty characters enter the
lives of these three cops, including a high-priced hooker (Kim Basinger)
and a shady millionaire (David Strathairn).  All of the characters'
levels of involvement are not immediately clear.  We watch with riveted
fascination to learn more about why they are there and their stake in
the case.  We sense a cross-pollination of clues that brings us, the
audience, closer to the truth.  We hope that the three detectives can
throw away their spite for one another and can pull their resources
together in order to untangle the intricately created web of mystery.  
Absorbing and affecting, this movie has all the necessary ingredients to
create a terrific gourmet serving of film noir.  It boasts mysterious
figures in control, double-crosses, hard information from sleazy
sources, dirty politicians, corrupt cops, haunting women, and hard-nosed
cops experiencing moral ambiguity.  The underlying mystery is
compelling.  The look and feel of the movie is gorgeous.  The entire
cast is crisp and wonderful to watch (I wouldn't be surprised if
Cromwell received an Oscar nomination for his performance).  And, the
dialogue is rich and memorable.  The best line of the movie is spoken
when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of
what to do.  "Don't start trying to do the right thing, boy-o," says he.
"You haven't had the practice."  "L.A. Confidential'' triumphantly
achieves the rare gift of complexity and coherence while satisfying our
desire for a good old-fashioned movie.

Title
Review for Runaway Bride (1999)
Some studio executive must have been comfortably reclining back in his
office chair with his feet planted on his desk thinking about what the
next great movie project will be.  This executive is probably a
last-minute doer.  And just before the deadline hits, he snaps his
finger and says aha', as if an idea so clever entered his mind that he
rushes forth convinced that he has a winner.  This idea was to reunite
the winning team that brought us the wonderful 1990 fairy tale, Pretty
Woman.  With Director Gary Marshall again at the helm, Julia Robert's
radiant smile, and Richard Gere's good looks, how can this miss?  Well
Gere plays Ike Graham, a columnist for USA Today who seems to approach
his job much like the aforementioned studio executive.  With a deadline
fast approaching, he sips his drink at the local watering hole trying
to come up with his latest article.  Graham's column is accused of
being laced with bitter diatribes of the opposite sex, and is the
target of many a hate mail from his female readers.  Even little old
ladies come up to him and hit him with rolled up newspapers.  At the
bar, he meets a person who tells him of Maggie Carpenter (Roberts), a
serial fiancée who seems to live for nothing other than pulling the
heartstrings of men and then leaving them at the altar.  Like the
studio executive, Ike is so convinced that this idea is a winner that
he rushes forth with this article without even checking the facts. 
Maggie writes a bitter note to Ike's editor (Rita Wilson), and he is
subsequently fired.  Ike's best friend (Hector Elizondo) tells him to
go do some personal research on the matter to get his job and his
reputation back.  Is she really as bad as they say?
So, now he's off to picturesque Hale, MD to determine the truth of
Maggie Carpenter.  Maggie is completely flustered by his presence,
especially in light of her impending fourth upcoming wedding attempt to
Coach Bob (Christopher Meloni).  She does his best to brush him off,
but Ike is not so easily dissuaded.  And before you know it, he's
making friends with Maggie's sottish but likeable dad, her spirited
grandma, and her best friend, played by Joan Cusack.  Despite their
initial dislike for one another, they seem to have an understanding for
one another.  After questioning her former jilted fiancés, he realizes
that it's not because she's a mean-spirited person.  Rather, it's
because she just doesn't know what she wants and fears that she'll
never find true love if she marries first.  Ike, to no surprise, has
similar problems. Their commonalties and ongoing bickering eventually
evolves into attraction for one another.  This is the kind of story
where the audience knows what will happen way before Ike and Maggie do.
 Sure, there's a minor crisis here, and the revelation that accompanies
it, but the story is as predictable as the steps of the Macarena.
I guess that I so moved by Pretty Woman because it was a movie that was
so 
Cinderella-esque.  How could anything like that happen in real life? 
It was implausible, but I loved it.  And to that point, I also have
greater praise for Robert's earlier summer release, Notting Hill for
that same reason.  This movie fails to generate the magic and warmth
that it promised to be.  Yes, Roberts and Gere have good chemistry, and
they are both good to look at.  But without their star power, the
studio moguls when deciding to make this picture probably wouldn't have
said I do.'

Review for Musketeer, The (2001)
If Alexandre Dumas only knew that his most famous
work, "The Three Musketeers," was going to be adapted
into umpteen big screen variations, his conversation
with Hollywood might go something like this: "I'll
take $100,000 for every good adaptation and a million
dollars for every bad adaptation."  Well, with this
latest effort, Dumas would be a millionaire.  
Actually, that's a bit unfair, for this installment is
not terrible.  It's a pretty looking film.  There is
obviously great care taken to evoke the 17th-century
French atmosphere from its verdant countryside to its
beautiful castles, from the regal nobility to the
gloomy street urchins.  It also boasts some
imaginative action sequences.  
But from a story telling point of view, it's not any
more rousing or dramatic than any of its predecessors.
 In fact, the story of the Musketeers seems so
familiar that even when they sound their battle cry of
"all for one and one for all," it is practically an
expected occurrence rather than a spirit-lifting
charge.  Without new dramatic juice, it's like being
served leftovers with only a new piece of garnish.
That garnish, however, is the wild sword fights.  The
trailers for this Musketeer adaptation have touted it
as a completely reimagined piece of work, which is
largely attributed to this.  There are about a dozen
or so battles, and the incredible athleticism
displayed seemingly requires a black belt in martial
arts, an ability to fence while blindfolded, as well
as two years experience performing with the Cirque du
Soleil troupe.  It's not surprising that there are 25
stunt doubles.
The film's plot revolves around D'artagnan (Justin
Chambers), who as a child, sees his parents
slaughtered by the evil Febre (Tim Roth) and vows
revenge.  He grows up wanting to be a Musketeer,
protectors of the King, and eventually learns about
the machinations of Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea),
who is trying to undermine his highness in an attempt
to seize power.
The word "Musketeer" should conjure up a vision of
heroism.  But Chambers-as-D'artagnan lacks neither the
needed heft nor the charisma to fill the shoes of a
hero.  He delivers all of his lines with a similar
amount of intensity whether it's "You're beautiful" or
"Don't fight me, for you will die."  But casting this
pretty-boy suggests that the movie studio is looking
to appeal to an age group that watches Dawson's Creek,
who perhaps are more concerned with good looks rather
than a moving story.  
Yet, it's easy for D'artagnan to lose focus as during
the course of his comeuppance, he meets a slew of
ill-defined characters.  They include a feisty ingenue
and love interest (Mena Suvari); a despondent
Musketeer army led by Athos, Portos, and Aramis; a
sympathetic queen (Catherine Deneuve), as well as the
scheming Cardinal and arch-enemy Febre.  The story
thus becomes needlessly complicated, saddled with
unnecessary scenes.  
Again, the main draw is the fight sequences, and most
are neat to watch.  A climactic battle atop a series
of careening giant ladders, for example, is something
that most American moviegoers have never seen.  Yet,
the action is so over-the-top that instead of
achieving a sense of escapism, it becomes somewhat
absurd and goofy.  In one scene, D'artagnan's steed
even collapses before he does.  
We can live with the so-so characterizations and can
likely enjoy the fighting sequences.  But we needed a
more compact and affecting story.  Someone has
forgotten that the pen is mightier than the sword.


Title
Review for Dark City (1998)
A man (Rufus Sewell) abruptly wakes up.  Blood trickles down his
forehead.  He sees a syringe on the floor.  He is noticeably
disoriented.   Everything seems strangely out of synch and we wonder
along with him what's going on.  He can only remember that his last
name is Murdoch but nothing else.   Suddenly, the phone rings, and he
is warned to leave immediately.  "They are already on their way," says
the mysterious voice on the other side urging him to get out.  As he
flees the building, he notices one incredibly strange thing. -- it
seems that time has stopped.  All movement has ceased right down to
the pendulums on a clock except for our man and those that are chasing
him.  Who are these people that are chasing Murdoch?  What makes
Murdoch special enabling him to stay 'awake' when everyone else
becomes frozen in time.  What is the secret of Dark City?
"Dark City" is a retro-futuristic noir thriller that is set in a place
of clouded memories, endless nights, and ever-changing landscapes.
The underground denizens are referred to as 'The Strangers'.
Ghoulishly pale and bald-headed, they possess telepathic powers and
come out at night like goblins to initiate their experiments on the
city and its residents.  At the stroke of 12, the Strangers initiate a
telepathic process called 'tuning' which enables them to alter reality
and stop time.  Murdoch, however, seems immune to this and in fact
seems to be developing powers that makes him stronger than the
Strangers.  To the Strangers, this is a threat that must be
eliminated.  To capture Murdoch, they come out to hunt him late at
night when they can stop time.  During the other parts of the day,
they wait for the police to capture him, for Murdoch is wanted for
questioning in connection with a murder case.  As the movie develops,
Murdoch soon regains more of his memory, and in order to further
understand the nature of the Strangers and the city itself, he seeks
help from his wife (Jennifer Connelly); the Inspector in charge of
capturing him (William Hurt); and an enigmatic psychologist that may
hold the key to his memory loss (Kiefer Sutherland).  
While we are entranced with Murdoch as he tries to unravel the
mystery, the greatest triumph of this movie is the city itself.
Gothic and impressive, it suggests an indistinct time period.  The
secrets within the city make her just as important a character as any
of the humans.  As a science-fiction piece, it plays with our
imagination and satiates our appetite for inventiveness.  The
cinematography is beautiful as scenes are filmed at strange angles and
in hallways, corridors and alleyways that connote an eerie sense of
claustrophobia.
As a drama, thriller and romantic vehicle, it sustains our interest
and unfolds slowly enough to pique our curiosity yet quickly enough to
satisfy our need to know.  Moreover, it is a visual experience that is
haunting yet captivating.  But without a doubt, it is destined to be
one of the most unique-looking films of this year.  With it's spooky
industrial soundtrack, stylish presentation, and nice pace, "Dark
City" is certainly worth visiting.

Title
Review for Six Days Seven Nights (1998)
As I sat during the first 15 minutes of this movie, a movie billed as an
adventure/romance/comedy, I could see the signs that this outing would
not be a trip through paradise.  First we meet the diminutive Anne Heche
portraying Robin, an editor of a woman's magazine called Dazzle.  With
an extremely busy schedule, which is a model of chaos, she barely has
time for her wimpy but romantic boyfriend Frank.  Although he lavishes
her with roses and surprises her with a trip to a pacific island
paradise, he doesn't really exude a manliness that would attract any
kind of woman.  Then again, Frank is played by Friends co-star, David
Schwimmer.  Meanwhile, Anne Heche isn't exactly interested in men, is
she?  Perhaps that's the comedic launching point for this exercise in
miscasting.  
In order to reach their final destination, Robin and Frank need to
charter a plane, which is piloted by Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford).
Quinn is a sometimes-drunk beach bum who seems content on living simple
life, which includes trying to pick up women, hanging out with his
voluptuous co-pilot, and eking out a meager existence through his
charter service.  Adventure finally dribbles into the film when Robin is
ordered to attend a nearby photoshoot.  Needing to leave the island, she
enlists Quinn, and off they fly into a nasty storm, which throws them
off course and forces them to land on some uninhabited island.
Realizing that the plane is heavily damaged and that it is unlikely that
no one will find them, Robin begins to ooze with bitchiness.  "Don't you
have any skills," she yells.  "You know, one of those guys you send out
into the wilderness with a pocket knife and a Q-Tip and they build you a
shopping mall?"  Meanwhile, Quinn tries to think of a way for them to
get off the island.  During the next couple of days, they have to trek
through miles of forest and mountainous terrain, avoid being bitten by
snakes and scorpions, and allude pirates (???) that conveniently show up
to try to heighten the movie's level of suspense.  Maybe Quinn can find
a way to save themselves, but even Harrison Ford can't save this
underdeveloped melange of genres.
Here's an example.  There's a beautiful scene when Heche and Ford
lustily kiss on the beach as the ocean tide gently crashes around them ŕ
la From Here to Eternity.  But what led up to this kiss?   Ford's Quinn
is very likable and resourceful.  This ruggedness attracts Robin, which
gives us what, I suppose, passes as the romantic aspect.  But although
Robin is plucky, her acerbic attitude and her uncanny ability to worsen
the situation (firing off their only flare into a tree, opening an
inflatable life raft while in the plane) makes her more of an annoyance
rather than a believable love interest.  And couldn't someone think of a
better crisis situation rather than modern-day pirates?  
There are the occasional chuckles and there are certain moments where
Heche shines and many moments that show us why Harrison Ford is a true
leading man.  But without the presence of Ford and the likable charm of
Heche, this film would find its way into the video store in less time
than the title of the movie.

Title
Review for Frequency (2000)
If you've seen any of the `Back to the Future' or
`Star Trek' adventures, cutting through the fabric of
time is about as easy as walking through the front
door.  All you have to do is speed up that DeLorean
sports car or fly through some spatial anomaly.  In
`Frequency,' you would need a ham radio and a flurry
of solar activity.  The difficult thing, however, is
not to disturb anything once you've gone back to the
past.  Innocently stepping on a flower can alter the
future in unforeseeable ways.  Thus, time travel is
one of the most creative yet trickiest of plot
devices.  Do it wrong and the result is a flimsy story
filled with incongruities.  Do it right and the result
might be `Frequency,' an inventive story about a Dad,
his son, and second chances.
The film opens in the year 1969.  The Dad (Dennis
Quaid) is the spirited, responsible, and fun-loving
kind that all kids want.  He's also a heroic
firefighter.  But his risk-taking approach eventually
gets the better of him.  Thirty years later, his son
(Jim Caviezel) has grown up to become a respected
homicide detective.  Like all children who lost their
fathers at an early age, he wishes that he had the
chance to get to know him better. 
It's just about the anniversary of his Dad's death. 
He pulls out his father's old ham radio, which has
been stored away for many years.  Incredibly, the
antiquated device still works.  John is further
astonished when he hears a voice from the other end. 
The voice says words like `Little Chief' (John's
nickname) and relates other information that
incredulously makes it seem as if the mysterious voice
is living in the past.  
After much contemplation, John can only conclude that
the other voice is his Dad's, talking from the year
1969.  It is a heartwarming sequence as these two
connect, and we believe the love that they share.  `We
must be talking off the mother of all sunspots,' his
Dad says in amazement.  John can neither contain his
excitement.  And without thinking about the
consequences of his conversation, he tells his Dad to
be careful, for tomorrow marks the day that he will
die in a fire.
You can't blame John for his actions.  But his advice
initiates a chain reaction that alters future events. 
In the new future, a serial murder case has now
escalated to new heights.  John has to try to repair
the damage that has been done.  The two work together
in a frenetic attempt to catch the killer.  Here's one
great benefit of time travel as a crime tool.  In
1969, when the killer leaves his fingerprint on an
object, wrap it up and hide it within the walls of the
house.  Then in 1999, John can retrieve it and use
modern technology to find out who the killer is.
As with all time travel plots, you can always find
fault with how the story resolves itself.  In this
case, there is a double showdown, one that occurs
concurrently in the present and in the past.  But
enjoying what transpires depends on whether you become
fed up with the idea of solar flares enabling time
displacement (smartly, the two characters are as
dumbfounded as the audience) or whether you are hooked
on the idea of a son getting a second chance to know
his Dad and to set things right.  Concentrate on the
latter, and you can't go wrong.
The film is impressive because the emotional aspect of
the story is so appealing.  Its mood is uncanny but
not haunting.  Its payoff is uplifting but not
treacley.  It doesn't benefit from special effects or
any big name stars. `Frequency,' however, is an evenly
paced and well-constructed story that enthralls and
keeps you guessing as to which way the film will turn.
 This is one of more enjoyable films of this season.

Review for Bringing Out the Dead (1999)
Of the most chaotic times and places to be, I would
give my vote to the early 1990s in the Hell's Kitchen
district of New York City.  It is a time period when
drug use and the devastation of the AIDS epidemic were
on the rise.  And it is a place where, at night, the
streets seem like a swamp of despair and hopelessness
where even the neighborhood citizens scurry around
like rats.  It is this setting where `Bringing Out the
Dead' takes place.  We are introduced to Frank Pierce
(Nicolas Cage) who is a paramedic, and it is through
his eyes that we see the gloomy world in which he
exists.
Frank works the graveyard shift and every night seems
like a full moon.  All the city's craziness that has
been bottled up is about to erupt.  On top of that,
Frank hasn't had a good night's sleep for days and he
hasn't been able to save any lives in over a month. 
Frank's hands are gifted and his heart is giving.  But
there is only so much that he can do in this time and
place.  The ghosts of those that he could not save
haunt him.  He drifts in and out of a state of
bewildered consciousness.  This is not an easy life. 
`Bringing Out the Dead' shows us three long nights in
the life of Frank as the burned out paramedic.  In the
first night, he's paired up with Larry (John Goodman)
who sees his job as simply a meal ticket.  Save lives,
get paid, and eat.  He's almost too relaxed given the
nature of his job.  On the second night, he is paired
up with the ultra-religious Marcus (Ving Rhames).  He
uses their emergency visits as a way to promote their
healing techniques as miracles.  Finally, his third
partner is Walls (Tom Sizemore), a sadistic person who
feels that it is better to beat up frequent visitors
to the emergency room rather than to transport them
there again and again and again.  Two other characters
factor into Frank's life.  One is Noel (pop star Marc
Anthony), who is one of those frequent visitors.  He
represents every hollowed soul whose life is consumed
with misery and drugs.  The other is the reformed
addict Mary (Patricia Arquette).  In trying to save
Mary from her state of turmoil, Frank may rid himself
of his inner demons.
`Dead' is truly a Director's film.  That is, it does
not succumb to Hollywood's familiar formula of
storytelling.  Scorsese has free reign to make his
kind of picture, and it is a work of directorial
excellence, uncompromising in detail and atmosphere. 
Perhaps its only weakness could be that it lacks the
dramatic arc and the climax that most moviegoers
expect from today's films.  In fact, there is no real
plot, as it relies on individual events.  But this
film is a wonderful exercise in bringing to fruition
the extended limbo in which Frank exists.  Cage does
all the right things that bring out Frank's pain and
despondence.  And all of the supporting characters and
the excellent camera work add vivid color to a world
that many would probably rather be lost and forgotten.
 This is definitely not a feel-good film like `Happy
Texas.'  And this film probably won't gross huge box
office dollars.  But a few Oscar bids are probably in
order, including Best Director for Scorcese. 
`Bringing Out the Dead' is terrific filmmaking from
one of Hollywood's greats.

Title
Review for Tarzan (1999)
After watching Disney's latest animated offering, there were a couple
of points that stayed with me from the moment that I left the theatre
up until now as I sit in front of my computer.  The most striking was
the terrific animation and level of detail that we've come to expect
from Disney animators.  The beautiful waterfalls and the indigenous
wildlife of the lush African forest are vividly brought to life.  And
there are three notable scenes that highlight the level of detail at
work.  The first features Kala (voiced by Glenn Close), a mother
Gorilla who saves young baby Tarzan from the jaws of a hungry leopard. 
Another involves a battle between a now-grown-up Tarzan versus the
leopard that almost killed him as a child.  And another scene features
Tarzan saving a prim, young, lass named Jane (voiced by Minnie Driver)
from a pack of hungry beasts.  He swings from vine to vine and slides
up and down an array of branches with the same look and feel of an
Olympic bobsled run.  This is nothing less than impressive.
`Tarzan' is about an orphaned baby that is raised in the wilds by
gorillas.  Kala cares for and adores him like her own son, but her mate
and leader of the gorilla pack, Kerchack (voiced by Lance Hericksen)
doesn't accept him.  He's different from the others, and as the ugly
duckling, Tarzan has to convince the protective Kerchack and even his
own gorilla play pals that he does belong among his simian siblings.  
Yet as Tarzan grows older, he does notice innate differences between
himself and his mother.  He becomes further confused after meeting
Jane, the first human that he encounters.  He sees that he has
physiologically more in common with Jane than he does with his gorilla
family.  Questions of self-identity and measures of self-worth are
brought forth, and now Tarzan wonders what his true calling is.  Trying
to sort out his loyalties and learning more about himself are
family-values' elements at which Disney storytelling excels.  Kids can
relate easily to this situation.  And I think that most kids will also
enjoy the clumsy antics of Tarzan's elephant friend, Tantor  (voiced by
Wayne Knight) and the sardonic wit of Terk (voiced by Rosie O'
Donnell). 
But the film has a definite feeling of maturity to it.  Another
subplot, although less intriguing, involved Jane's fellow travelers. 
One of them is her father (voiced by Nigel Hawthorne) who is on a
scientific trip to study the gorillas.  The other traveler is Clayton,
He purports to be their bodyguard, but he secretly wants to find these
gorillas and to capture them for a pretty penny.  This rogue is as oily
as they come.   He senses Tarzan's attraction to Jane and exploits his
feelings in order to gain knowledge of the gorillas' secret nesting
area.  Boo!  Hiss!
I have grown used to Disney films as being feel-good adventures filled
with humor, song, and color.  And maybe that's why Little Mermaid still
ranks as my favorite among all of the Disney animated films.  This film
(and I think recent Disney animated features in general) has purposely
tried to be more adult-oriented.  For example, many songs in the film
are created by contemporary popmeister Phil Collins, while the colors
of the film are noticeably paler than Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast
or even Pocahontas.  Tarzan is surprisingly weighty and Disney films
are definitely maturing.  But my mind is still humming `Under the Sea.'

Review for Shall We Dansu? (1996)
If you stand with your eyes closed and listen to the wonderful,
musical rhythms of ballroom dance, something strange and vibrant
begins to happen.  You can feel the music carry you off into a world
free of worries.  And as you open your eyes and witness the fanciful
footwork being displayed on the floor, you feel as if dancing can
enable you to fly.  Dancing is about joy; freedom; and pure
expression.
However, in a society like Japan where lives evolve into monotonous
routines, outward expressionism, especially dancing, is viewed with
suspicion.  This characteristic of the Japanese culture is quickly
established as we watch the main character, Mr. Sugiyama, live his
life from one day to the next.  Middle-aged and seemingly bored with
his life, he wakes up very early and comes home very late at night.
He is an accountant, accepts his job, loves his family, appreciates
his newly bought house, but he never smiles.  There is no joy in his
heart; his soul if bereft of passion.
One day, as he takes the train home from work, he notices a wistful
figure staring out the window of a building.  Her solemn look and her
stately sadness captures his interest and awakens his heart.  He
eventually finds the courage to seek her out, and discovers that the
office from where she stands is a dancing school, and that she is one
of the dance instructors, named Mai.  He signs up for lessons, but is
a total beginner.  However, his goal is to get to know Mai.
Unfortunately, he and the other beginners are assigned a different
instructor.  Nonetheless, he follows his impulses and asks Mai out to
dinner, but she rejects him, explaining that there is nothing more
important to her than dancing.  Icy cold, she also goes on to say that
she hopes that he didn't take lessons with going out with her as the
goal.  The truth hurts, but her words motivate him to continue dancing
to prove her wrong.  Gradually, the steps come to him, and he
discovers that he has a flair for dancing.  
Enjoying dance is an embarrassing secret, but after many exhaustive
practice sessions, he confesses that even when he's tired, he has
never felt more alive.  His search for personal freedom, however, may
come at a high cost if his actions are discovered.  No doubt, if his
wife or colleagues knew of it, it would incredibly shame him.  Yet,
while Mr. Sugiyama's search for individuality is tender, we also learn
that Mai has her own secrets and her own personal demons with which
she struggles.  The collaboration between these two creates a poignant
association that allows them to move forward in their personal
searches.  
The creators of this film not only give us two enjoyable main
characters, but they also give us several rich supporting players.
These include Aoki, Sugiyama's colleague, who is a shy office worker
by day, but at night on the dance floor, transforms himself into an
overzealous Fred Astaire.   He encourages his boss to dance but warns,
"when you love to dance, it becomes second nature.  You don't even
know you're doing it,"  he says, as he sashays around the corner.
There is also the wife of Sugiyama who grows suspicious when her
husband stays out late and comes home showing signs of happiness.  And
there is also Natsuko, the school's den mother, who imparts not only
lessons in dance but also lessons in life.  The director also does
well to bring out the eccentricities of the Japanese culture from
Sugiyama's initial fear of breaking his routine to the weight of the
shame that he might eventually face.
During a lesson, Mai emphatically states, "a weak first step transmits
nothing!"  You'll find that this cute story unfolds with confidence,
although "Shall We Dance?" plays more like a stately waltz rather than
a quick two-step.  In Japanese, with English subtitles, this is a
pleasant film about finding personal fulfillment in a Victorian
society, where individual needs are not regarded as a high priority.
It's about renewal, and it's about discovering the joys of life if you
have the heart to break free from societal conformity.

Review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.  He's as ugly as a
cactus and as charming as an eel.  Living atop the
windy peak of Mount Crumpit, he peers out onto the
town of Whoville far below.  He's a solitary
curmudgeon whose sole source of enjoyment comes from
making life miserable for others, especially during
the holiday season.  Loathing their Christmas spirit
with their bright lights, non-stop singing, gift
giving, and general sense of gaiety, he devises a plan
to rob Whoville of their most precious holiday.
However, his foul mission is thwarted by the
kindhearted actions of little Cindy Lou Who  (adorable
Taylor Momsen).  In a chance encounter with the Grinch
(an unrecognizable Jim Carrey), she believes that he's
not all bad despite what the rest of the town thinks. 
With her wide-eyed innocence, she hopes to bring out
his warm side hidden under all that green fur and
callous demeanor.
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a slightly revved
up version of the Dr. Seuss bedtime classic. 
Richly narrated by Anthony Hopkins, the film follows
the original basic outline.  However, it comes up
short on imagination and has lost a touch of its
sentimental spirit. 
You would expect more in terms of design, considering
the Grinch universe takes place within a snowflake. 
The Whoville denizens look and act like mannequins. 
They possess hog-like snouts and sport a hairstyle
that looks like it was the result of a passing
cyclone.  And for a town that seems to be in a 24/7
preparation mode for Christmas, the whole place looks
oddly somber.  There is a noticeable lack of primary
colors, the palettes seem muted, and the entire set
design seems like something out of Candylandor the
backlot of Universal Studios.  Of course, there are
some terrific special effects.  And its strongest
segment occurs when the Grinch goes on his raid during
Christmas Eve.  He employs a giant vacuum to suck out
the goodies, unleashes moths to eat the hanging
Christmas stockings, and even steals the visions of
sugarplums dancing in their heads.  But up to that
point, there's very little magic in the air.
Another shortfall was that the film didn't do enough
to generate enough sympathy for the Grinch.  Yes, we
learn of the Grinch's past and the root of his hatred
for Christmas and Whoville, but it spends an
inordinate amount of time establishing his meanness. 
This disqualifies the film from being a wholesome
child's tale, and moves it into dark territory that
may leave wee ones confused. Among other things, he
pushes little kids to the ground during a sack race
and eats shards of glass while he plots against the
town of Whoville.  This is a bad hero/role model for
children if they tend to mimic what happens on-screen.
Yet, the film has flashes of creativity, and kudos are
in order for Jim Carrey who worked exceptionally hard
to pull off this almost-impossible role.  Despite
being mummified under that green suit, he still
applies his unique brand of physical comedy while
snarling, growling, and scowling, and does his best to
show us a good time.
The movie does have its funny moments even if its
grander aspirations are unrealized.  
But it needed to be brighter to captivate and more fun
to enthrall.  
Like the Grinch who felt hatred towards those who had
him ostracized,
This film's heart is two sizes too small.


Title
Review for Shanghai Noon (2000)
Non-alcoholic beer.  Sugar-free cookies.  Fat-free ice
cream.  These look good, but they just don't quite
satisfy.  Now you can add "Shanghai Noon" to this
list.  Set in the year 1881, this adventure-comedy
about cowboys, Indians, and a Chinese Imperial Guard
looks great.  The impressive cinematography shows the
pomp of Imperial Guards (who sport very festive
looking garb) practicing martial arts in unison, the
majesty of the vast Western expanse, and the beauty of
snow-capped mountains.  However, once you move beyond
the first 30 minutes and start looking for a story,
you'll find that the plot becomes less coherent than
President Clinton's explanation about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
The story begins in the fabled Forbidden City where
hundreds of Imperial Guards are drilling in the main
courtyard.  Among them is Chon Wang (Chan), a loyal
protector bound by honor and oath.  Included among
those that he has sworn to protect is the demure
Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu).  Faced with the
unpleasant prospect of taking part in an arranged
marriage, she decides to escape to America.  Chon
tries to stop her, but when the Princess coldly stares
at him and demands that he desists, his reverence for
her makes him completely powerless.  His moment of
weakness, however, proves to be disastrous.  Once the
Princess reaches America, she is kidnapped.  To right
his mistake, he volunteers to go to America to rescue
her.  
Chon certainly possesses the fighting skills necessary
to fend off rowdy cowboys, dimwitted bandits, and even
a hostile group of Indians.  These encounters allow
Chan to display his trademark comical fighting style. 
When he's not delivering a punch or a roundhouse kick,
he's jumping through trees or scurrying through
windows.  And when he's up against a superior number
of foes, he quickly improvises and uses unconventional
objects as weapons.  The most unique sequence involves
a battle with a gun-wielding posse in which our hero
skillfully uses a horseshoe and a piece of rope to
dispatch his opponents.  Chan is not a vicious fighter
who is intent on maiming his opponent.  Rather, he
just seems content on knocking them down.  Thus,
despite some bone-crunching sound effects, the fight
scenes are completely bloodless.  
Eventually, Chon team's up with the smug yet amiable
outlaw, Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson).  Chon hopes that
Roy's familiarity with the territory may be of an
asset.  Meanwhile, Roy feels that locating the
Princess might yield some lucrative benefits.  Teaming
these two together, however, slows the movie down
considerably.  While Chan and Wilson seem comfortable
in their roles, they didn't really have any chemistry.
 Chan could have done this as a solo project. 
Wilson's inclusion seemed to only accomplish adding
another bad guy to the mix, an ornery and
reward-hungry gunslinger (Xander Berkeley).
"Shanghai Noon" is fun to watch when it focuses on
Chon's mission to save the Princess.  But as the story
progresses, there are a number of other subplots that
are introduced but are never fully resolved.  This
becomes quite distracting.  For example, Wen is
supposed to avenge the death of someone, a plot that
seems totally forgotten.  Princess Pei Pei learns
something about the common person, but this notion is
never furthered.  These are all noble ideas, but they
dissipate like noble gases.  Even stranger, there is
no clear reason for having a villain.  The audience is
left completely in the dark as to his motivation and
grand scheme.
Regardless of how silly the film is, it is always a
treat to watch the buoyant Jackie Chan.  Part fighting
machine and part clown, he can simultaneously make you
awe in wonder with his deft martial arts moves and
make you laugh like a little kid because deep inside,
Chan is a doting child who has never quite grown up. 
There is no other performer like him, so any of his
films are usually worth the price of matinee.

Title
Review for Screwed (2000)
Watching "Screwed," an underwhelming comedy, is like
trying to drive a car 10 miles in 2nd gear.  You can
only go so far before you become frustrated with the
pace and progress.
In fact, this film has such little momentum that at
some point, the movie almost stops from its own lack
of inertia.  "Screwed" primarily fails because it has
no ambition.  It doesn't try to offer anything new as
far as comedies go.  Instead it relies too heavily on
an atmosphere of tomfoolery and inherently silly
characters that bumble their way through the plot.  
Yet, when it goes for a laugh, its method is to evoke
a sense of queasiness.  One such joke involves a
creepy mortician (Danny DeVito) who displays way too
much enjoyment for his job.  He comments, "It's
amazing what you dig out of dead people's bodies," as
he proceeds to play a recently acquired harmonica. 
Another joke involves a wrinkly, semi-naked, 80-year
old woman.  And another one involves seeing Sherman
Hemsley (TV's George Jefferson) in a thong.  These
sights are more apt to make you cringe with discomfort
rather than chuckle.
The story revolves around a disgruntled butler named
Willard (Norm MacDonald) and a dognapping scheme gone
awry.  Willard has been toiling for fifteen years as a
butler for the miserly Miss Crock (Elaine Stritch). 
Crock is a wealthy pastry mogul who lavishes her dog
with a lifestyle fit for a king.  But for anything and
anyone else, she's a mean-spirited tightwad.  She
seems especially put off by Willard's request for a
new butler suit.  His is tattered and frayed.  In
fact, it's the same suit that his father used to wear.
 On Christmas day, when he receives a Crock brand
mincemeat pie, he can no longer stand the humiliation.
 So, with the help of his bumbling friend, Rusty
(David Chappelle), they devise a plan to kidnap
Crock's precious canine.  "I'd bet she pay $1 million
for that sack of fleas," he derisively says.
Of course, criminally inept fools like Willard and
Rusty don't become skilled dognappers overnight. 
Though Willard is intent on revenge, he warns his
friend, "we're not criminals; you fry chicken and I
drive a car."  But then they think about all the
things they can do with that kind of money and are
instantly motivated.  Willard wants to escape to a
tropical paradise.  Rusty, who is more simple-minded,
hopes to laminate the menus in his restaurant.  They
proceed with the dognapping, which they completely
botch.  And then in a twist stranger than bizarre, the
police believe that Willard is the one who is
kidnapped.  Now, the jittery butler must find a way to
'unkidnap' himself and avoid being exposed by a
tough-looking but soft-spoken detective (Daniel
Benzali). 
"Screwed" is the kind of mediocre filmmaking that
sacrifices story for hammy acting.  The only likable
character was Miss Crock as the apathetic, crotchety
old woman who debates whether to pay the ransom money
for Willard's release.  The others were just plain
silly, though watching Rusty hit people with desk
lamps might illicit a chuckle or two.  And the story
has the consistency of rice pudding.  The film's
direction saunters from one idea to another, and as a
result, it becomes a melange of half-baked ideas in a
now-you-see-it-now-you-don't kind of way.  The film
starts off as a revenge flick, transforms into a story
where Willard must cover his tracks, and then
ultimately introduces an angle of reconciliation and
forgiveness.  Slowly paced and completely
unremarkable, this film is more than enough to make
you feel screwed.

Title
Review for Beach, The (2000)
"The Beach" is a structurally confusing film that I
can only describe has having multiple personality
disorder.  Every forty minutes of this two-hour film
begins with a new theme, virtually discarding what has
been set up in the preceding act.  It starts off
purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking
new thrills in a dangerous environment.  But then in
the second act, the mood of the film abruptly changes
and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an
idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of "Blue
Lagoon".  Forty minutes later, the mood changes once
more, and it becomes a dumbed down version of "Lord of
the Flies" where an isolated community is discovered,
where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of
bliss at all costs.  By the time it's over, you can
only scratch your head and wonder what this film was
really meant to be about.  
The main character of "The Beach" is angst-ridden
Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio).  He travels to the
Netherworld of Bangkok where back alley merchants push
their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily
clad women brazenly ask if you're looking for a good
time.  Richard's voice-over tells the audience that he
has come to this place because he is bored with his
life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is
to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of
the unknown.
This seedy environment is just what Richard is looking
for.  He checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets
the crazed Daffy (Robert Carlisle).  He seems like a
raving lunatic, obviously high from heavy drug use and
looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of
psychosis.  Though his jagged behavior would distress
most of us, Richard listens to him as he speaks of a
mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach
that anyone has ever seen.  Moreover, the island
itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can
make a small city high for life.  Captivated by the
idea, he asks two other hotel guests to join him on
his journey. They are worldly Etienne and the alluring
Francoise, who have also come to Thailand for reasons
similar to Richard's.  
Once they finally arrive at this paradise, however,
the mood of the story shifts to Richard's growing
desire for Francoise.  This particular plot point is
weak at best because there is absolutely no question
in my mind that Francoise will wind up with Richard. 
Etienne is about as exciting as fluffy, white sand. 
It's odd that Etienne never sees this coming, but
paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just
out of view.  And once the three stumble across the
hidden community (mood shift imminent), more events
transpire that depict its hidden dangers.  For
example, there are marijuana fields close by patrolled
by armed guards.  And the lagoon in which they swim
invites the occasional shark.
There are several ideas that are introduced in "The
Beach" and each one could merit its own feature-length
film.  There's the man vs. nature angle, the love
triangle angle, and the Utopia-gone-awry angle.  But
the film meanders so tremendously that its entire
purpose becomes blurred.  DiCaprio, as a result, has
an almost impossible time of trying to embody the
different states of mind that he and the film goes
through.  Consequently, the audience has an equally
difficult time trying to keep up.

Title
Review for Battlefield Earth (2000)
To watch `Battlefield Earth' is to wallow in misery. 
It is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in
recent history.  It has a clumsily told story, insipid
dialogue, shallow characterizations, ugly scene
transitions, no evidence of dramatic arc,
headache-inducing sound effects, and a resolution that
is completely implausible.  Worse, there's the promise
of a sequel.  Why?!  Save your money.  Some films go
quickly to video.  This one, however, should go
straight to the Sci-Fi Channel's `Mystery Science
Theatre.'
In the year 3000, Man has become an endangered
species.  Most of humanity (called man-animals') was
destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race
of plundering aliens (called Psychlos).  Survivors
have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved
to mine Earth's resources for the rest of their lives.
The aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species
that stand nine-feet tall, who resemble inbred
Klingons.  Dimwitted as they are tall, their culture
is predicated on power, extortion, and getting
leverage.'  Travolta, the leverage-using star, plays
Terl, the conniving security chief that oversees the
mining facility on Earth.  Much of the movie is spent
showing us examples of Terl's petty machinations.  He
routinely employs deception and then punctuates his
statements with maniacal laughter.  But one thing is
certain; he hates being stationed on Earth.  When the
home planet informs him that he will be spending the
rest of his life on this planet, he begins to devise
his latest plan.
He will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out
a gold ore site.  It's not clear how this benefits
Terl, except that it makes him richer in a place where
he has no use for it.  The scrappy Jonnie Goodboy
Tyler (Barry Peppers) is selected as the slave group's
leader.  A Psychlo knowledge machine gives him the
mining know-how.  But the machine also teaches him
other things such as the Psychlo language, the
principles of our founding fathers, Euclidean
geometry, and the location of Fort Knox.  This
enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining
assignment.  It also prepares him to organize and
stage a massive revolt against their captors.  `We're
going to blow up their home world,' he says.  `But
first, we need a few more supplies.'  In days, he and
his comrades evolve from cave dwelling, loincloth
wearing, rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and
nuclear weapons experts.  By now, the audience is
laughing as maniacally as Terl.
The media have been working overtime to let the public
know that John Travolta's labor of love is a piece of
sci-fi drivel.  Numerous journals have called it an
ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris,
arrogance, and poor planning.   And after watching
this movie, you'll wholeheartedly agree.  This is a
terrible film that is illogically constructed,
tediously acted, and frequently begs the question: Why
was this ever made?   At a price tag of $90 million,
this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly,
assuredly becoming `The Avengers' of this summer. 
Both films were unforgivable and this promises to
suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity. 
In addition to the universally pejorative reviews,
there's another bizarre element to the `Battlefield'
saga.  This film would never have been made if not for
the star power of Travolta, who for over a decade, had
been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to
the big screen.  The controversy is that Travolta is a
Scientologist, and `Battlefield' is based on a 1982
novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the religion's late founder. 
This led some to believe that `Battlefield Earth'
would amount to Scientologist dogma, laden with
subliminal messages.  But the story is so poorly told
that any message, subliminal or otherwise, is totally
undetectable.  If the audience got anything out of
this film, it was this: we are not too unlike the
Psychlo leader.  Like Terl, the audience felt
imprisoned, dreaded their situation, and looked for
any opportunity to leave.  Could that be the
Scientology message?

Title
Review for Evolution (2001)
There are some film's that have long running times but
seem relatively short (like "Titanic").  Then, there
are some films with short running times but seem
really lo-o-ong.  This is how you'll feel after
watching "Evolution", a 100-minute film that seems to
take as much time to resolve itself as it took for man
to evolve from ape.  
This never-ending feeling occurs because there just
isn't enough for the talented cast of characters to
do.  The film introduces a world-ending dilemma and
resolves the issue by administering an enema.   Pardon
my bad poetry.  But in between, there is no excitement
and only a little drama.  However, there are lots of
creepy critters and a disproportionate amount of ass
jokes if that strikes your fancy.
"Evolution" is about a meteor that crash-lands on
Earth.  Within this rock, there oozes primordial
liquid.   Two local community college professors, Ira
Kane (David Duchovny) and Harry Block (Orlando Jones),
are the first scientists to make this fascinating
discovery.  This could elevate them from adjunct
status at their college to Nobel Prize winners.  "Do
they pay the Nobel Prize in installments or one lump
sum," Harry asks excitedly.  Ira, however, is more
concerned with the astounding rate in which the
organisms are evolving.
Soon, a new species of extra-terrestrial critters
emerge, which range from the scary kind you might see
in "Aliens" to the menacing types in "Jurassic Park"
to the huggable kinds that remind you of "ET".  While
imaginative, they don't amount to much more than
colorful special effects for the summer movie-going
audience and a target for our alien-busters to chase
down.  They have to be eradicated, you know, for the
growing alien ecosystem threatens to cover the
continent within months.
To complement this duo, they are joined in their
battle by a fireman-in-training (Seann William Scott,
whose inclusion is puzzling up until the final moments
of the film) and a frostbitten doctor from the Center
for Disease Control (Julianne Moore).  But this
foursome doesn't really exist to do battle against the
alien infestation; rather, they are there to flex
their individual comic muscles.  After all, this is
supposed to be a comedy.
Duchovny is actually a fairly amusing guy who speaks
with deadpan earnestness.  Moore's contribution seems
to involve tripping and pratfalls.  Scott, who's
making a living as pothead characters, provides the
puerile humor.  While they'll elicit a chuckle or two,
their comedic efficacy pales in comparison to Jones's
comedic performance, who provides the funniest
moments.  For example, when a space bug somehow
infiltrates his large intestines, they wheel him into
the operating room.  "Cheek spreader," says the
doctor, "there's no time for lubricant."  Jones yells
back, "There's ALWAYS time for lubricant!"   His
fast-talking, head-bobbing, manic brand of comedy made
him the most enjoyable of the characters.  Overall,
however, we are starved for more laughter.
While our intrepid group runs around, hunts down
aliens, squishes bugs, and looks for answers,
surprisingly, they never really go anywhere.  And thus
neither does the film.  "Who ya gonna call?"  Don't
even bother picking up that phone.


Title
Review for Good Will Hunting (1997)
Roughneck, janitor, parolee, genius.  These words sum up the essence
of Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a blue-collar boy who lives in the tough
neighborhoods of South Boston.  He likes to invite confrontation,
hangs out with a group of rough-and-tumble guys, and has a police
record a mile long.  In the day, he works at a construction worksite,
but at night, moonlights as a custodian at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.  
Within the building where he cleans, there is also an advanced
mathematics class being taught be the illustrious Professor Lambeau
(Stellan Sakrsgard).  As a distinguished faculty member and a Fields
Medal award-winner, he tickles the minds of his students by
challenging them to solve a complex math proof, which he writes on a
blackboard just outside the classroom door.  So difficult is this
challenge, that he expects no one to solve it until the end of the
semester.  Amazingly, someone solves it overnight.
While it's a huge surprise to the Professor who the brilliant mind is,
it is no surprise to the audience if you've seen any of the trailers
or commercials for this film.  Indeed, we learn that it is Will who
has an IQ of Einstein, a photographic memory, and an uncanny capacity
to see through the complexities of any equation.  But despite his
unparalleled talents, Will is suffering on the inside - a victim of
chronic abuse and loneliness from his days as a child, and, sadly,
would rather lay brick, hang out and drink beer rather than use his
gift for the betterment of others and himself.  
Four people try to rescue him from his path of self-destruction,
although their reasons are very different and sometimes selfish.
Professor Lambeau sees this as an opportunity to train a prodigy and
to take the field of math to new and exciting levels.  However, Will
is unruly and undisciplined.  Lambeau seeks a therapist on Will's
behalf and eventually asks his ex-college roommate, Sean McGuire
(Robin Williams), who agrees to help him.  Sean tries to bond with
Will, trying to learn what makes him tick, why he is repressed, and to
find a way for his happiness to emerge from his soul.  Will's world is
also affected by his best friend, Chuckie (Ben Affleck), who wants
Will to realize his gift and to take the initiative to do something
better.  Skylar (Minnie Driver), is Will's love interest who wants to
reach him, but is constantly held at bay by his defensive mechanisms.
This film is a straightforward drama that boasts some nice all-around
performances.  Williams is appealing as the therapist, using witty
banter and some unconventional tactics to break through to Will's
heart.  His role is a refreshing change that harks back to his
earnestness in Dead Poet's Society.   Damon remains focused as a
lonely and insecure soul hiding behind a facade of toughness.  The
storytelling is sound, and the story moves along at a good clip.
>From the beginning, we know that the entire story right up to the
ending will be somewhat predictable.  There are no real surprises
here, and that's ok.  There are precious moments to savor.  For
example, there is a great 'pick-up' scene in a bar as Will and a
Harvard student try to prove their smarts.  I especially liked the
Cro-Magnon-like Chuckie who confesses that his favorite moment in the
day is when he walks up to his house to pick him up to go to work.  "I
keep hoping that one day I'll walk up, and you won't be there," he
says tenderly. And, there are several touching moments between Will
and Sean as their bond grows closer.  At one point during a session by
a pond, Will quips, "is this a Taster's Choice moment?"  Indeed, there
are many such fine individual moments that makes Good Will Hunting a
nice catch.

Title
Review for Pleasantville (1998)
If you ever tune into Nick at Nite, it's likely that you'll catch some
of those classic tv programs that espoused nothing but heaps of family
values.  Remember Make Room for Daddy or the Brady Bunch or Leave It
To Beaver?  Everything was 'swell', a heated romance consisted of
holding hands, and it never rained.  Pleasantville is another one of
those shows featuring a never-ending string of smiles and homemade
chocolate chip cookies.  
Dave is a big fan of this program and has uncanny knowledge of each
and every episode.  He is especially excited to learn that they'll be
having a Pleasantville marathon on tv.  But this doesn't bode well
with Jen, his outgoing and popular sister.  An important date is
coming over and she wants to watch MTV.  As they struggle for the
remote, a surge of energy transports them into Pleasantville in a
Twilight Zone-esque sort of way.   Now, they become Bud and Mary Sue,
children in an all-too-perfect family and residents of an
all-too-perfect community.  What's worse, their whole world is in
black and white.
They have little choice but to go along with what's happening while
they try to figure a way out of this unlikely universe.  Bud/Dave
wants to play it safe and uses his knowledge of the episodes to make
sure that the universe remains unchanged.  When the Captain of his
basketball team asks him a question, for example, he knows what will
happen in the near future because he's already seen the episode. 
However, Mary Sue/Jen completely dislikes the sterile environment. 
"We are stuck in Nerdville," she exclaims and intends to inject a
little life into the community.   However, by stirring things up,
things begin to change.  She introduces into this staid environment
shocking, never-before experienced feelings such as passion.  Bud/Dave
objects at first but then realizes that this newfound sense of
existence begins to start a revolution.  A renaissance of emotion is
underway.  For those that feel it, their lives are rewarded with color
and an imagination that they could never before attain.  However, some
want to keep Pleasantville in its original state. This situation
divides the community, and it is up to Bud/Dave to find a way for the
townsfolk to embrace this new transformation.
"Pleasantville" has many niceties.  At its core, it's a movie about
discovery.  It's sends out a nice message that promotes freedom to
explore and to take risks.  It paces itself well as the local citizens
slowly make their own discoveries of who they are and of the world
around them.  It's not a movie that will make you kick your heels when
you walk out of the theatre.  But the movie does live up to its name.

Review for Newton Boys, The (1998)
The Newton Boys is the true story of the most successful gang of bank
robbers in American history.  Their stream of robberies lasted for
over two years in the early 1920s, and an intelligent leader helped to
keep them from being caught by the law.   Matthew McConaughey stars as
Willis Newton, who eventually enlists the services of his brothers to
help him pull off the robberies.  Waxing philosophic, he reasons that
the banks are crooks themselves, so they are just smaller thieves
stealing from bigger thieves.  He also wants the money to help pay for
an oil rig which, he hopes, will hold the key to his future once he
taps into the oil reserves that lie below.
His brothers include Jess (Ethan Hawke), who likes to live life on the
edge; Joe (Skeet Ulrich) whose innocence forces him to question
Willis' moral stance; and Doc, a lumbering loser of a sort who just
wants to be a part of anything that is criminal in activity.  Living
on a Texas ranch and in virtual poverty, the glitzy city life and the
potential riches convince the brothers to tag along with Willis.  The
final member is lovingly referred to as 'Glass' (Dwight Yoakum), a
long-time associate of Willis' who also has experience in setting off
explosives.  These men are all friendly, down-home folk who are
good-natured, not at all indicative of bank robbers.  But they are
good at what they do.  Willis leads the way and makes the plans, Glass
uses the explosives to break into bank safes, and the brothers are
assigned as lookouts.  No one ever gets hurt, and the money pours in.
They are not shy about spending their ill-gained loot, and even Willis
uses his new found wealth and innate charm to woo his future love,
Louise Brown (Julianna Margulies).
Eventually, two events begin to signal the demise of the Newton boys.
One is that new safes are being invented which are sturdier than ever.
The new safes make it virtually impossible for them to break in.
Robberies are now a lot riskier too since security has been
heightened.  Second, the oil rig goes bust.  All that has been
invested is lost, and now, they have to start over again.  But the
fabric of their familiar world is unraveling.  So, it's one last
heist, and the target is a federal mail train.  The risk is great, but
if they succeed, their reward will be an incredible $3 million. 
But if you thought a movie about bank robbing would be characterized
by fun and guns, you'd better think again.  As an entertainment
vehicle, The Newton Boys moves as slowly as the mail train.  Playing
more like a pseudo-documentary, it slowly chugs along, and the movie
seems to meander from scene to scene, letting us hang out with the
boys, but never really pulling us into their family.  Even with guns
a-blazing, this movie is a dramatic lull.  One big problem is that the
characters are all pretty dull.  But a more inherent problem was that
the real life Newtons boys were very successful, whose skills
outmatched anything they faced.  They were smart enough to get away
with anything, and for the most part, they did.  Thus, there lacks the
element of adversity, energy, and excitement.  But if you do watch
this film, stay for the most interesting part which happens during the
end credits when we see an old interview with the real Willis Newton
on the Johnny Carson show and some home video footage of Joe Newton.
The Newton boys remained relatively obscure among the pantheon of
famous criminals.  Obscurity will befall this movie as well.

Title
Review for Very Bad Things (1998)
I guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad, there
would be broken furniture, traces of smack and cocaine on the floor,
and a dead prostitute in the bathroom.  I guess that if a movie had
also gone really bad, there might be the same elements present. 
Coincidence?
Poor Kyle (a meek looking Jon Favreau)...he is about to marry his
radiant fiancee, Laura (Cameron Diaz).  But before he exchanges his
vows, he embarks to Las Vegas with his friends for one last blowout. 
But this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly
get.   The prostitute has met a horrible, though accidental death, and
drugs are everywhere.  The five friends agree that there is enough bad
evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time.  A
surprisingly calm Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), who looks like he
was groomed to make nefarious decisions, ponders their dilemma for a
few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the
body in the desert where she'll never be found.  Although they stomach
the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body (which also disturbingly
involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it
into suitcases), when they return from their trip, guilt and paranoia
begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends.  One
is Adam (Daniel Stern)  He grows increasingly agitated.  Whenever
people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way, his blood
pressure increases.  Or that just may be because of his dysfunctional
family.  Another is Michael, who was actually responsible for her
death.  He tries to bury his feelings, but the burden of guilt begins
to affect his judgment as well.  Boyd is the doer' of the group. 
Seemingly suffering from a long psychosis, when he feels as if his
secret is about to be exposed, he is apt to take extreme measures to
cover up his tracks.  Kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to
Laura's demanding expectations.  Then, there's Moore (Leland Orser)
who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face.
The problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a
cruel comedy, but it presents things in a manner that just aren't
funny.  Drugs, mutilation, and killing your own friends isn't
something to be laughed at.  As a straight psychological drama, I
could see how it might have worked, as each one tried to maneuver and
overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimes-sick
ways.  But this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply
discard our values for 2 hours.   If you do like this movie, I don't
think that I want to know you.  I did find Slater a convincing  leader
who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the smart
play.'  And Diaz adds some brightness to this film as a
wedding-needing fiancee.  But her talents are essentially wasted here.
 It's obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone. 
But the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless.  Do not make a very
bad decision by seeing this film.


Title
Review for Truman Show, The (1998)
One criticism that many have made about today's television shows is that
it contains too little realism.  What we view are gross exaggerations,
lurid sensationalism running wild.  Witness the trashy talk shows, the
nutty soap operas, pay-per-view fiascoes, prime-time wrestling, and "oh
no...they killed Kenny!"  Is that why a show such as Seinfeld was so
popular?  Because they covered topics that seemed so ordinary that they
were downright insightful?  The public clamors for something real to
watch, and they get it in "The Truman Show."
Now in his 30th year, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) has been the unknowing
star of his own show since he was born.  As he goes about his daily life
and interacts with the city's denizens, thousands of hidden cameras
follow him around, revealing to the audience every little detail of his
life.  Truman has no idea that his life has been carefully planned and
that all the world is a stage.  We're there when he suffers tragedy,
when he takes his first steps, and when he experiments with his first
kiss.  Truman eventually finds his life too comfortable.  An uneasiness
begins to gnaw at him.  The only thing that ever gave him spark was a
brief encounter with a girl whom he met in college who mysteriously
disappeared.  "I'm getting out of here," he exclaims.  But to actually
leave the community would mean the end of the show, and the producer (Ed
Harris) does what he can to keep Truman trapped in his storybook land.
"The Truman Show" is an elegantly constructed movie that explores two
things.  The first is Truman's growing realization that his whole life
has been some sort of masquerade.  He picks up clues here and there such
as the wife that talks like a television commercial, radio channels
whose announcer tells where Truman is heading, and a lifestyle that's
unrealistically harmonious.  He knows that finding his own truth
requires risks.  He is willing to shed his affable nature in search of
adventure.  The more interesting aspect, however, is the debate that
ensues between the producer of the show and a former cast member who
severely questions his ethics and accuses him of deceit and using
technology and media to satiate some kind of twisted appetite of the
public.  Ratings override his sense of humanitarianism, and thus the
direction of the movie soon becomes clear.  Who will win out?  Those
that seek the truth for personal betterment or those that manipulate the
facts in order to stave off change?
Carrey turns in a surprisingly good performance, and shows that he has
the ability to be both a manic comic and a person that can project a
sense of wonderment and awe.  It's easy for us to sympathize with Carrey
and as the movie progresses, we struggle with him and become a part of
his life.  The storytelling quickly draws us in, and we become as
interested as the viewing audience depicted in the movie.  "The Truman
Show" is a unique movie, his journey is immensely satisfying, and Carrey
is engrossing as a man who learns that there's nothing more important
than taking that first step.

Title
Review for Fight Club (1999)
If there's one thing that `Fight Club' unabashedly
displays, it's that the era of the sensitive male is
over.  Men do not gush with gooey sentimentality. 
Restraint is only a temporary state of mind.  There is
an animal inside all of us, and it's aching to break
out.  But the rules of society and the pleas of our
local community beg all of us to be kinder and
gentler.  Thus, we simply brush aside any feelings of
aggression and replace them with happy thoughts and
trance music.  But just once, I'd like catch up to the
guy who cut me off and run him off the road.
With that in mind, `Fight Club' is a movie to which
many of us can relate.  Narrated by the angst-filled
Edward Norton, he represents something that is
probably inside many of us.  Dressed in buttoned white
shirts and solid dark ties, he's stuck in a job that
gradually squeezes every ounce of passion from his
life.  He is the beleaguered worker whose personal
nirvana comes from furnishing his condo with as many
items from the IKEA catalogue as possible.  There is
very little excitement in his life as he constantly
drifts between a state of consciousness and
unconsciousness.  This man has every reason to be
angry.  But he doesn't have the spirit to do so.  He
has been asleep far too long.  
His life is a stark contrast to soap maker, salesman,
and chance acquaintance, Tyler Durden (the chiseled
Brad Pitt).  Everything about Tyler is a little bit
larger than life.  He's extremely confident, donning
red-tinted glasses and looking somewhat like a pimp. 
He's extremely intelligent, reciting to him how
certain household chemicals can be easily mixed
together to form highly power explosives.  And he's
fearless, taking him on a raid of a liposuction clinic
where he steals human fat needed for the high quality
of his soap.  Tyler is God.  He talks, walks, and
attracts girls in the way that Norton's narrator never
could.
The only commonality between them is that they both
possess pent aggression that they need to release. 
Finally, Tyler says, `Hit me as hard as you can. 
You'll never learn anything about yourself unless
you've been in a fight.'   So, the first swing is
taken and surprisingly, there is actually something
therapeutic about clenching one's fist and thrusting
it forward into someone else's face.  Fight Club is
born.  Soon, other men are joining this secret
society.  They are the local garbagemen, drivers,
delivery boys, waiters and middle managers who are
sick and tired of their lives.  Fight Club can bring
about the catharsis that they so desperately seek,
which outweighs any pain that they feel from the
myriad of broken noses and bruised faces.
Up through the first act, I enjoyed the essence and
smartness of `Fight Club.'  It's a good-looking film
with a terrific effort by Norton and Pitt.  And I also
liked Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), as the frustrated
loner who can't understand why pounding each other
with fists is better than having sex with her.  Then I
realized that the men who participate in Fight Club do
not find the spiritual freedom that they so badly
want.  Oddly, Fight Club evolves into some kind of
cult where members engage in acts of vandalism
throughout the city.   The argument can be made that
the direction in which the film takes asks the
question of how far is too far.'  With Norton at one
end of the spectrum and Pitt at the other, can a
comfortable middle ground be found or does one side
have to give it all up?  It's an interesting question
to be sure, and I wish that there were a smarter way
in which the film tries to answer the question.  As it
stands, `Fight Club' is philosophy on one end of the
spectrum and glossy thriller at the other end with no
comfortable middle ground.

Title
Review for Jackie Brown (1997)
Many times when I watch a movie, I'm very interested in knowing what's
going through the minds of the characters up there on the movie
screen.  What makes them tick?  What motivates them?  What makes them
do the things that they do?  Character development is one of the key
ingredients to a good movie when, after sitting through a 2-hour
movie, we finally get to the payoff.  Hopefully, everything will wind
down to a congruously satisfying ending.
Gangsters and hoodlums are an interesting breed.  What fuels their
day?  Is it the money?  Is it loyalty among the underworld?  Is it the
power that comes from sidestepping the laws that are in place?  The
strength of "Jackie Brown" lies within it's writing (thanks to Quentin
Tarantino), in which an in-depth exploration of the minds of several
twisted low-lifes are examined.  Early on, we meet up with the woman
from the title of the movie (Pam Grier), and learn that she transports
dirty money between the US and Mexico for her gun-running boss, Ordell
Robbi (Samuel L. Jackson).  Robbi seems to be the typical crook who
makes his living selling guns to the highest bidder, with the possible
exception that he's an intelligent thinker, is verbally eloquent, and
is consumed with his personal safety.  For example, if one of his
associates is arrested, he rationalizes that his associate must be
killed to ensure his freedom.
Robbi's world is truly chaotic, and skeptically relies on his
dim-witted, right-hand man, Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), and a trio of
women (including Bridget Fonda as a bitchy, opiate-addicted surfer
girl) whose places he uses as hideouts.  His true friend, however, is
only himself, and Jackie Brown knows that.  So, she works on a plan,
with the help of her bail bondsman, Max Cherry (Robert Forster), to
find a way to stay ahead of the police that want to keep her in jail
and to stay ahead of Robbi, who would feel better if she were dead.
These are all smart people, and it will be the smartest one among them
all that will emerge victorious.  Add in $500,000 of dirty money
that's up for grabs and an intense effort to outmaneuver each other,
and the result should wind down to a congruously satisfying ending,
right?  Well...
This movie is rich with character development.  We see Jackie's cool
and collective nature.  Displaying toughness and poise, Grier
successfully carries the movie through it's various twists and turns.
We understand Max Cherry's involvement and attraction for Jackie.  And
we see the ineptitude of Robbi's situation, who is basically a
short-tempered captain of a ship of fools.  I especially liked Bridget
Fonda, who, despite her character's lassitude, seemed to be the
smartest of the bunch.  Indeed, we are treated to some nicely shot
scenes filled with witty banter in a cloak and dagger atmosphere.  But
what we don't get is the great payoff that makes us say "I'm glad that
I sat through that 160-minute movie."  Eventually, the slow pace
killed the sense of urgency, which I felt should have been the reward,
at least for this particular critic.  
Yet, I want to applaud Tarentino's texturally rich adaptation of
Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch.  He has a good eye behind the camera
and proves that he has an uncanny capability to engross us with odd
chatter in bizarre situations.  "Jackie Brown" certainly had some of
the intoxicating effects of rum, but ultimately lacked the punch.

Title
Review for Toy Story 2 (1999)
Yee-haw!  The long-awaited sequel featuring Cowboy
Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear (voiced
by Tim Allen) has finally arrived.  And, if there is
any movie to see this holiday season, this is it!
When the first Toy Story came to the big screen.  It
was a fabulous achievement in both Disney storytelling
and computer-animation.  We fell in love with not only
Woody and Buzz, but the supporting cast of toys that
included a piggy bank, Mr. Potato Head, green army
men, and other playthings from the pre-Atari era. 
These toys stimulated the child's imagination in every
way that TS2 will stimulate yours.
The underlying story is about friendship and
sacrifice.  Woody learns the frailty of his existence
when during playtime with his owner, his arm is
accidentally damaged.  He is exiled away on the top
shelf where he learns the fate of a toy that had not
been seen in quite some time.  It's Weezy, a squeaking
penguin whose squeaker no longer works.  Weezy will be
heading for the dreaded garage sale.  Woody attempts
to save him.  This beginning sequence is important to
the concept of Toy Story.  Toys do have a life of
their own, and the happiness that they experience is
dependent on the love that the owner gives, much like
a pet.  Toys feel, they long for affection, and they
watch out for one another.  
In trying to save Weezy, Woody winds up as an item in
the garage sale.  A shopper recognizes Woody as a rare
collector's item.  His name is Big Al (voiced by Wayne
Knight) and he quickly snatches this rare find and
drives off.  Buzz and his crew of toys must get Woody
back. Using the unique mapping abilities of
Etch-a-Sketch, they embark on a dangerous search and
rescue mission across town.  To cross a street for
example, they hide underneath orange traffic cones,
which force oncoming cars to swerve left and right
through the ad hoc construction zone.
Meanwhile, Woody learns why he was of such interest to
Big Al.  Woody is one of an ensemble of toys called
the Roundup Gang.  The other members of the gang
include Cowgirl Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Stinky
Pete (voiced by Kelsey Grammer), and a horse named
Bullseye.  He is further amazed to learn that his
popularity stemmed from an old black and white
television puppet show.  A Japanese museum wants to
collect the entire ensemble.  Without Woody, the
others are worthless and would be locked away forever.
 It's a fate that no toy ever wants to experience. 
Jessie pleads with Woody to stay recalling her
experience as a toy once loved but then discarded once
her owner grew up.  Stinky Pete, still in its original
box, laments the fact that nobody would ever love a
doll the way he looks.  Their concerns touch Woody,
for he knows that it may just be a matter of time
before Andy forgets about him, especially with his
damaged arm.  But Buzz tells Woody that it's better to
be loved for a little while than to be locked away
behind a glass partition in some museum.
Like the first Toy Story, TS2 uses the same
state-of-the-art computer animation.  There is
enormous attention to details, and the film goes much
further than being just a Sunday school lesson about
friends.  Terrific shots of humor abound throughout
the film, and for the older set, there is also a great
deal of action, as the fate of Woody becomes unclear. 
Will Buzz be able to convince him to return?  Will Big
Al get his way and ship him off to Japan.  The
20-minute finale is nothing less than spectacular.  I
was thoroughly impressed with the skillfulness of the
animation, the pace of the story, and the ability of
the writers to remind us that toys are as magical as
our own childhood.  Far better than the original, TS2
should be atop your movie wishlist.


Title
Review for Postman, The (1997)
It's funny - ironic really, how we take for granted one of our most
established and tried and true forms of communications.  I'm not
talking about phones or faxes or e-mail.  I'm referring to that great
system that we call the postal service.  In the mid-1800s, the brave
riders of the Pony Express helped to bring the population of the
United States closer together through mail routes that were both long
and treacherous.  A lot can be said of these intrepid riders, these
tireless couriers, these postmen.  We can easily romanticize an era
when the postmen and the delivery of mail helped individuals embrace
an entire nation.
Oddly, there seems to be less of an imagination at work here in Kevin
Costner's epic fable.  Set in the not-so-distant future, after a great
war that has decimated America's infrastructure and dissolved the
American government, survivors are caught in a loose feudal system
where the strong prey on the weak and take the spoils of their
victory.  Will Patton plays the evil warlord.  As General Bethlehem,
he leads his army, raids towns and demands tribute in the form of
goods and men, whom he will train to become soldiers under his
command.  Costner, after being unwillingly conscripted into
Bethlehem's army, soon escapes, stumbles upon a mail truck, and
devises a plan to ensure that he survives as he continues to drift
from town to town.  Using his flimsy Shakespearean acting background,
he conjures a fictional tale of how the US government has been
restored, and how he is delivering the mail.  The first town that he
comes upon embraces him.  "You're a Godsend," says an old woman.  Amid
the ruins of civilization, the Postman takes on a symbol of hope and
renewal, something so desperately needed to counterbalance the tyranny
unleashed by Gen. Bethlehem.
Although the Postman is just an act, it touches, in particular, Ford
Lincoln Mercury (Lorenz Tate) who wants to help usher in a new era of
hope by being a Postman as well.   His presence also attracts towngirl
Abby (Olivia Adams).  Through the rest of the movie, the legacy of the
Postman grows, primarily through the efforts of FLM.  The wandering
Costner frequently tells townspeople that "things are getting better
all the time," but is really only interested in a free meal.  However,
the growing illusion of a restored United States not only begins to
slowly move Costner's eccentric and loner character, but also
threatens the viability of Bethlehem's feudal principles.  Bethlehem
wants the Postman dead and mercilessly tries to hunt him down.
The biggest problem with The Postman is that it brings to us another
chapter of a loner who allies himself with a loose band of people
that, against overwhelming odds, must defeat the enemies that
symbolize oppression.  We saw this eloquently done in the superior
Dances With Wolves, and once again in Waterworld.  The Postman doesn't
stack up to either of these two.  There are some good scenes that
epitomize the slim threads of hope that the townspeople have.  For
example, just before men are brutally murdered in a firing line for
not disclosing the whereabouts of Costner, one of them, who has always
been cynical of Costner's intent, shouts, "Ride, Postman, ride!"  
But this is a 3-hour marathon that doesn't give us enough to believe
in to sustain our attention for so long a period of time.  There are
shots of the post-apocalyptic wilderness; there is a slowly developing
bond between Costner and Abby, who turns out to be a strong
frontierswoman; and there are lots of scenes where Costner stares out
into the horizon (probably thinking to himself that this is really a
long movie).  The final confrontation between the Postman and
Bethlehem has 2nd Class stamped all over it.   Throughout the movie,
there seemed to be many times when greatness was just aching to come
out, but ultimately the story was not nearly as rich (or as short) as
it could have been.  I give credit to the filmmakers for trying to
give us something deep and moving.  Unfortunately, the Postman left me
feeling a little disgruntled.

Review for Family Man, The (2000)
In the romantic comedy, "Family Man," Jack (Nicolas
Cage) is blessed with a second chance to see how his
life would have turned out if he'd gone ahead and
married his college sweetheart, Kate (Tea Leoni).  He
actually left Kate long ago, putting his career ahead
of love.  And now, he has become a
master-of-his-own-universe, investment banker.  But
thanks to a chance encounter with a mysterious angel
(Don Cheadle), he is offered a glimpse into this other
life where he is her devoted husband, father of two,
and the proud owner of a sorely-in-need-of-a-tune-up
minivan.  
With this setup, a few burning questions arise.  Are
there any lessons that Jack can learn about himself? 
Did he make the right choice leaving Kate all those
years ago?  Most importantly, will his outlook be
changed in such a way that it will make him a better
man?  These are the answers that I had wanted to know
because the premise of the film follows in the vein of
"It's a Wonderful Life" and "A Christmas Carole."  But
in this uninspired screenplay, neither path that Jack
chooses really provides him with the fulfillment that
he personally seeks.  As a result, the movie doesn't
provide the sentimental charge that it seems to want
to deliver, and what we're left with is a lackluster
story whose title should have been called: "Either
Life is OK".
Needed to create the required impact is to see that
Jack is actually better off with Kate.  But is he?  In
real life, Jack is a high finance wizard who is the
midst of orchestrating a gigantic merger.  With his
business savvy and charisma, his company as well as a
slew of women revere him.  Yes, he's a slave to his
work and he even toils on Christmas Day.  Yet, having
a walk-in closet filled with $2000 suits and an exotic
car doesn't seem all that bad.  Meanwhile, his 'dream'
existence puts him into the lifestyle of a
middle-class, blue-collar salesman at a tire store
where the highlights of his week are shopping at the
Burlington Coat Factory, bowling with the guys, and
eating funnel cakes.
This isn't really anybody's idea of a better life, is
it?  But, it is made all the more tolerable thanks to
Kate, his adoring wife.  Tea Leoni gives a robust
performance in what may be the only bright spot to
this film.  She's affable and having the chance to get
back together with her would be hard to pass up.  
But this speaks to another shortcoming, which is the
lack of chemistry between Cage and Leoni.  They give
good individual performances but we don't buy into
their romance.  Even as Jack develops his first-time
sense of belonging and sharing, as a couple, they
don't seem to connect.   There's a lack of tenderness.
 It's missing the spark that is needed to emotionally
draw in the audience.
The most appealing aspect is the film's
lightheartedness, which mostly focuses on the fact
that Jack WAS a person that had everything, but is now
a blue-collar, child rearing, 'have-not.'  Watching
him report to work as a mag wheel salesman for Big
Ed's Tires is a hoot.  Yet, for the film to have risen
above an otherwise humdrum romantic comedy, Jack's
catharsis needed to be more remarkable.  Is he truly
better off as a family man?  I'm still wondering.

Review for Thirteen Days (2000)
On a chilly October day in 1962, America teetered on
the verge of war.  A national crisis had developed
when it was discovered that Russia was secretly
installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, giving our Red
adversary first strike capability.  America was
adamant in finding a way to remove them.  However, it
was unclear as to whether diplomacy would work or
whether military force would be needed.  Had the Cuban
Missile Crisis escalated out of control, it would have
started an irreversible chain of events that could
have, in all likelihood, sent mankind on a trajectory
towards Armageddon.  That is, unless cooler heads
could prevail.
"Thirteen Days" is a wonderfully suspenseful and
dramatic retelling of the Cuban Missile Crisis when
America hoped for the best but virtually expected the
worst, showing us why cooler heads did prevail. 
Culled from a host of sources, including historical
records and documents, White House tapes, memoirs, and
interviews with some of the key players, the
screenplay centers on three people that ultimately
helped to pull America and the world back from the
brink.  The most crucial, of course, is then-President
John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) who must
simultaneously act decisively to address the grave
threat to national security, maintain a sense of
decision-making integrity to appease opposing
political forces, and exercise temperance in this time
of high volatility.  We learn that it's not just the
"big red dog digging in our backyard" that poses a
threat.  Equally menacing is the zealous military
brass that wants to take immediate, forceful action. 
Greenwood turns in a strong performance who makes a
believable Kennedy, allowing the audience to
internalize the agonizing political decisions that
would not only affect the future of his administration
but the future of the world as well.  
The other two key players are Attorney General Robert
F. Kennedy (Steven Culp) who remains edgy about any
path they undertake but is committed to carrying out
the decisions of his Presidential brother.   Also,
Kenneth P. O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) is a brusque
political advisor that helps to keep the political
machine from unraveling.  Both also give fine
performances, making it easy to accept them as the
people that they portray.
The movie chronicles the crisis from when offensive
missiles are first discovered being assembled in Cuba.
 Every action that the U.S. takes in countering the
threat seems reasonable.  However, the results bring
frightening consequences that push us closer towards
the unthinkable with alarming momentum.  Throughout
the film, the sense of urgency and tension mounts. 
For President Kennedy and the world, the stakes are
unspeakably high and the territory that they have
entered is uncharted.
The stark nature of the drama is heightened as some
scenes are shot in black and white.  Additionally, to
give the onscreen turmoil a more profound sense of
realism, many scenes feature video footage from that
period.  We witness the pandemonium at the stores as
citizens stocked up on goods; watch venerable news
anchor Walter Cronkite struggle to find the words to
adequately describe the frenzied situation; and most
haunting, view images of school children running for
cover during a bomb drill.
This is a riveting, message-driven film about a
pivotal point in our history when a handful of men had
the power to save or destroy the entire world.  It's a
chapter of America's recent past that should never be
forgotten.  After seeing it, you'll feel lucky to be
alive.

Review for Others, The (2001)
During the carefree school days of the 5th grade, we
had a gothic teacher named Mr. Hunt.  I secretly
called him "Mr. Haunt" because he had skin that made
him look somewhat charred, a box-like head and a
hairstyle that made him look like a distant cousin of
Frankenstein, and a gaze that might make you shiver. 
While his presence occasionally gave me (and some of
the other classmates) a few goose bumps, he was
beloved by all.  He knew how to keep us entertained. 
But most of all, he really knew how to tell a good
ghost story.
He would dim the lights, draw the curtains, bring out
a set of eerie noisemakers, and direct a flashlight
unto his face from under his chin to give himself a
spectral glow.  As he told his story, I would
sometimes cover my ears just to calm myself down.  
That kind of spine-tingling sensation has been
resurrected in "The Others," a wonderfully tense,
thoroughly haunting, old-fashioned ghost story.  The
film literally starts off with a scream.   Set just
after WWII, Grace (icy Nicole Kidman) lives in a
palatial yet isolated English mansion where eerie
things start to happen.  Enshrouded by fog and a
moribund stillness, this imposing estate would howl
itself if it could.
Grace is already a tormented soul who negotiates an
almost unbearable existence.  Her two children, Anne
(Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), who look
to be lifted from an Edgar Allen Poe tale, suffer from
a rare condition that renders them fatally allergic to
the light.  As such, the curtains must be drawn to
keep out the warmth of the sun.  She's also waiting
for the return of her husband (Christopher Eccleston)
from the war front.  Likely, however, he is already
dead.  She would easily succumb to insanity if not for
her devout faith.  
She relies on her religious grounding to combat the
unexplained and spooky things that eventually happen. 
For example, Anne claims to have conversations with an
unseen boy; strange noises emanate from a never-used
room; voices can be heard in the distance.  While
Grace doesn't believe in the supernatural, doubt and
fear slowly and creep in.  The chill of the unknown
not only eventually affects the stoic mother, but
slowly envelops the audience as well.
Writer-director Alejandro Amenabar ably plays upon our
inherent fear of the dark to create an edgy and moody
atmosphere that's sure to increase your heartbeat.  He
utilizes unsettling caterwaul-like music, shadows in
corridors, white sheets draped over furniture, and a
particularly effective camera trick -- whenever Grace
would slowly open a door, the camera would be
positioned behind our tragic heroine.  Like a child
who hides behind her mother when frightened, we also
want to hide, but agonize over what's behind that
door.  So chilling at times is this tale that the
scariest scene actually happens in broad daylight!
I can go on lauding Kidman's steely performance and
the tone of unbridled fear established by the
wonderful child actors.  But I scare easily anyway. 
So, what did the audience think?  Throughout the film,
there was mostly dead silence and the occasional
scream from the intimidated.  Where did all the
popcorn munchers go?  Perhaps there were only 20
people in the audience.  Surprisingly, when the lights
went up, there were 200!  They were all riveted by
what they saw, too afraid to move, completely
entranced by "The Others."

Title
Review for City of Angels (1998)
Stephen, please post if appropriate.  Thanks.
Tender and light-hearted, "City of Angels" is a romantic comedy about
angelic Seth (Nicholas Cage) who develops an earthly interest in an
amazingly aware and vibrant doctor (Meg Ryan).  As it turns out, angels
have always been among us but choose not to be seen.  Depicted in the
film as human-looking, black full-length coat wearing men and women,
angels follow us, perch themselves atop high structures to solemnly
reflect humanity, and can read everyone's thoughts.  They can provide a
dose of calmness when we are in despair or are our escorts to heaven
when we pass away.  However, most angels lack ambition and curiosity,
and they spend their existence watching over others in a trance-like
state.  Seth, however, is curious and wonders if there is more to his
existence.
His curiosity is further fueled when he meets the doctor, Maggie Rice.
During a tricky operation, she begins to lose her patient.  After
failing to resuscitate him, she becomes distraught, and questions her
ability to save lives.  Turning to her colleague and pseudo-boyfriend,
she wonders, "who are we fighting against?"  Is there more to her
existence?  
The setting is now ripe for the two to meet.  Making himself visible, he
takes the time to explore Maggie's world and the wonders of life as seen
through her eyes.  Poetic and stately, he impresses her with his sense
of curiosity.   As Maggie relishes every bite of her favorite fruit,
Seth quietly says, "I don't know what that pear tastes like to you.
Describe it as Hemmingway would."  Meanwhile, he is taken aback by her
effervescence and lust for life.  They begin to grow close, but as an
angel, he knows nothing about matters of the heart because he can not
feel.  He confides his confusion to fellow angel Cassiel (Andre
Braugher), and also learns more about what love is from a hospital
patient (Dennis Franz) who has an uncanny understanding of his
situation.  But with love comes sacrifice.  What can Seth do?
The real treat of this movie is Ryan's sunny disposition and radiance.
As she falls in love with Seth, all sorts of questions begin to arise
for her.  Are you married?  Are you homeless?  Are you a drummer?  Why
do you always where the same clothes?  She knows how to convey her
doe-eyed confusion, especially in a scene where she begins to learn his
true nature, which is bittersweet and funny.  In the kitchen, Seth
seemingly slices off his finger, but Maggie notices that there is no
blood.  She is about to be thrust into the unknown...much like any new
relationship.
The script and presentation works in allowing us to connect with our own
questions of mortality and reminds us to appreciate the things that we
take for granted.  Remember to savor each bite and to let the sun bask
your face in its warmth.  Remember to appreciate the touch of someone
you love and to let the cool ocean waves stimulate your body.  City of
Angels is a purposeful and touching story that looks at two people who
represent two elements that frequently remains a mystery to many...that
of life and love.

Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
I feel very lucky to be living in an age where society's greatest war is
that on drugs and on AIDS.  I can only nod my head in grateful silence
when I think about those who have given their lives for the security of
their children, for the subsequent betterment of society and for a life
free of tyranny.  And although these ends are noble and are worth dying
for, war has a strange way of eroding away the soul of a man and
replacing it with anger and emptiness.
"Saving Private Ryan" is a raw and powerful film that takes us right
into the bowels of WWII when allied forces staged their daring invasion
upon Omaha Beach, which we now know as D-day.  The film immediately
projects a mixture of raw tension and helplessness.  Like an animal
desperately trying to escape from a trap, thousands of men await in
their troop transports as they get ready to storm the beach.  Meanwhile,
the enemies have readied all of their artillery on them, waiting to
indiscriminately kill anything that moves.  Director Steven Speilberg
takes this masterfully shot battle scene one step further by allowing us
to see through the eyes of a soldier struggling to make it ashore as his
comrades fall prey to bullets, grenades and explosions while the color
of the ocean grows more red from the blood of the other soldiers.  
Countless lives were lost on D-day.  And throughout WWII, many more sons
lost their lives fighting for their country.  These kinds of losses are
insufferable for the parents of children killed in action and especially
for a widow named Ryan.  During the course of a month, 3 of her 4 brave
sons are killed.  One is possibly still alive.  He is Private James Ryan
(Matt Damon), a paratrooper that disappeared behind enemy lines after a
botched drop.  The War Dept. assures the mom that they will do whatever
they can to save him and to return him to her.
This assignments falls on the shoulders of Capt. John Miller (Tom
Hanks), who survived the invasion but is astounded to find out that he
has been selected to lead this trivial search and rescue mission.  The
group that he leads, in essence, is a microcosm of the ideas of war.
Three of them stood out for me.  There is Miller himself, whose
background doesn't lend itself to Captaincy, and the harsh reality of
war makes him worried that his wife will never again recognize him.
There is Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns) who questions the practicality of
the mission.  And there is the meek Cpl. Upham who is an excellent
translator but has never fired a rifle or seen the brutality of war up
close.  But as they trek across the countryside in search of Ryan ("he
better be worth it," says one of them) and face snipers and machine gun
nests, they begin to learn more about one another.  Their time spent
traveling across the scenic French landscape allows them weigh the
importance of saving Private Ryan and allows them to finally internalize
the significance of the mission.  For these men, it is a way for them to
inject some of the humanity that has been stripped away through war,
blood, vomit and death.
This is not only a superior war film, but at it's moralistic center, it
is a dramatic story about a group of men in search of a form of
redemption that is as hard to find as Ryan himself.  There are some
disturbing scenes of carnage such as bodies exploding, people whose
limbs have been shot off, or even the intestines of a still-alive
soldier.  But all of it is appropriate given the backdrop of WWII and
the fierce battles that took place.
Indeed, during this time when men are reduced to animals that
indiscriminately kill to stay alive, when men undergo a startling
transformation from farm boys to killing machines, when men must band
together to overcome their greatest fears and most sorrowful of regrets,
finding and saving Private Ryan may be the one decent thing that they
can do - it may be the one positive thing that they can take away from
this war.  As each of the men who are assigned on this odd mission begin
to connect with it's moral importance, they realize that saving Private
Ryan means that in some way they can also save themselves.

Title
Review for Dirty Work (1998)
Perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on Saturday
Night Live who always started the segment with "...this is the fake
news," Norm MacDonald, at times, could elicit some laughter by blurting
out semi-offensive phrases in his raspy voice, coated with a
condescending attitude.  His shtick was marked by crassness.  In this
movie, for example, when his girlfriend says that she's kicking him out
because he's been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months,
he tries to calm the situation by saying, "maybe you'll feel better
after we have some dirty sex."   This kind of humor can only go so far,
but certainly can't go the distance in a full-length feature.  
"Dirty Work", is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best
friends who grow up only physically.  Emotionally, they've never
outgrown their pubescent years, which is somewhat amusingly explored in
a beginning flashback.  Although having no apparent real world skills,
the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back
at people.  If the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket, then
dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch
the car burst apart.  
Mitch (Norm MacDonald) and Sam (Artie Lange) need to come up with
$50,000 in a period of two weeks so that Sam's dad (Jack Warden) can
have a heart operation.   Their idea is to start a revenge-for-hire
business where they'll do your dirty work.  In the funniest scene (and
possibly the only funny scene) of the movie, they take advantage of a
live television shoot at a nearby used car lot.  Their presence is
established, but when a less-than-honorable real estate developer hires
them and then reneges on the payment, the two go to work to exact their
sordid brand of revenge.
By default, Dirty Work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots,
but it delivers Jerky Boys level material.  Except for the bit at the
used car lot (and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers),
the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone
call.   Already weak on material, it further spirals itself towards the
video store by having Jack Warden constantly blurt out that he has an
unsatisfied libido and needs 'broads' and also includes a very unfunny
Chevy Chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction.  But what's
really painfully evident is that Norm MacDonald has no versatility as an
actor.  Relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder
and saying "note to self" ("note to self: learn to fight," he says after
getting beat up; "note to self: there's always beer," he says after
hitting rock bottom; etc.), we feel like we're just watching an
elongated rehash of his not-so-glorious days on Saturday Night Live.
Much like the television show, for 90 minutes we get one or two funny
bits.  The rest of the story is just dead space.

Title
Review for Fire Down Below (1997)
 There was probably a good reason that the Warner Bros. studio chose
 not to allow critics to view this Steven Seagal film when it first
 opened.  And, after seeing this piece of toxic waste, I now know why.
 This movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since
 possibly those Ernest movies years ago.  Fire Down Below centers its
 story on a little mining town in God's country, somewhere in eastern
 Kentucky.  It's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed
 by an uncaring mining magnate (Kris Kristopherson, who constantly
 looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role).  It
 turns out that he's filling the mines throughout Kentucky with toxic
 waste for a tidy profit.  Seagal plays Jack Taggert, an aikido-versed,
 fighting machine, who is an agent with the EPA.  No...not the CIA nor
 the FBI nor the NSA.  It's the Environmental Protection Agency.   I
 had no idea that EPA agents were trained to be killers! Taggert is
 sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice.
 Written by someone named Jeb, I could already envision the stereotypes
 of incestuous relationships, banjo-picking preachers, and
 dumb-as-nails rednecks.    But the script puts Seagal right smack dab
 in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit
 in.  Seagal's idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather
 jacket.  But to get closer to the kinfolk, he will fix people's
 porches for free.  That's another great EPA asset - teaching agents
 how to fix porches.
 Slow and plodding, this project is a total mess.  The sometimes allure
 of watching Seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber
 and outgun him like in Under Seige.    Here, his bravado basically
 turns into bullyness.  Townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge
 Seagal are quickly subdued.  Fight scenes are quick and senseless and
 offers no enjoyment value whatsoever.  And his soap box message wears
 thin within the first 15 minutes.  The most annoying moment comes when
 he barges into the middle of a Sunday church ceremony, gets behind the
 pulpit, and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and
 to help clean up the environment.  But the epitome of how
 moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person
 responsible for the toxic dumping, Kristopherson, meets up with
 Seagal.  Kristopherson asks Seagal how much it will take for him to go
 away.  Seagal gallantly replies: "I'll leave when you take the poison
 from the streams and the earth."  I was expecting patriotic music to
 start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background.  This is
 truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for Seagal's righteousness
 and narcissistic arrogance.
 Seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the
 filmplace, that of the enviro-thriller (On Deadly Ground).  However,
 the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles
 like this.  Still, I believe in preserving Mother Earth, so save your
 $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally
 conscious charity.

Title
Review for Starship Troopers (1997)
If you've ever seen any of Director Paul Verhoeven's other films such
as Total Recall, Basic Instinct or Showgirls, there is one common
thread that ties all of his work together.  That element can be
described as 'excess'.  True to his reputation, he is equally
relentless in his excessiveness here.  There is excessive violence,
there is excessive body counts, and there is excessive battling.  In
fact, it is my belief that Verhoeven has made it his personal crusade
to release movies that are just short of receiving an NC-17 rating.
Early on, you can sense that this will be a brutally disgusting movie.
For example, two of the main characters, Rico and Carmen, are in
biology class studying a 'bug' which is about the size of a small
refrigerator.  As they dissect, the students pull out the innards,
digging through the slime and ooze that protect the organs.  Carmen
barfs, and you might also too unless you've eaten way in advance.
Here at this educational institution, we also meet Diz, a feisty girl,
who has a crush on Rico and another friend Carl, who is extremely
intelligent.  One of the proudest things that these young adults can
do is to join the Federation, which is Earth's futuristic
intergalactic army.  Service guarantees citizenship, a highly sought
after social status.  After taking their tests, each goes their own
separate ways.  Diz and Rico wind up in the infantry.  Carmen becomes
a pilot, while Carl becomes a part of the military intelligence.
However, soon after, their separate lives begin to converge once again
as war breaks out with a bug-like species half way across the galaxy,
and it is up to these four and an array of other characters to take
part in the cosmic battle of their lives.  
Yet, while war and citizenship seemed incredibly important to the
characters on screen, the movie failed to involve me in their struggle
and their consternation towards their enemy.  And I believe that the
problem with this movie is two-fold.  First, our connection and
interest with the characters are mild at best.  As we watch the four
advance in skill and rank, I never, for one instant, really felt their
struggle or pain or jubilation.  Mainly, the writer decided that what
was more interesting was not how they coped with war, lost comrades,
or their overnight transformation from ordinary civilians to ruthless
fighters.  Here's an example.  The bugs are quickly advancing, and the
troop seems hopelessly outnumbered.  The Sergeant yells to Rico,
"You're my Corporal until you die or I find someone better!"  Instead,
our interest is tied to the love triangles and the subsequent
relationships that sprouted as a matter of consequence.  I felt that I
was watching a hybrid of Melrose Place and Deep Space 9.
The second factor was it's sheer excessiveness, which went beyond
satire and bordered on the absurd.  For example, to kill one bug, it
takes 4 soldiers and literally 2,000 rounds of ammo.  Human casualties
are in the hundreds of thousands.  But here's the really absurd thing.
You make your way to a fort that was decimated by the enemy.  Limbs
lie here and there, heads are decapitated, bodies are gored.  Everyone
has died a horrible death.  You know that the bugs are close by
waiting to kill you.  Do you leave immediately?  OR...do you set up
camp?  I'll let you decide.
Of course, this is a film about all-out war, so its boundaries are
somewhat confined.  The best thing about this film is the special
effects, which are spectacular, especially the scenes involving
Earth's space fleet being fired upon by plasma cannonballs (when you
learn the source of the cannonballs, you'll slap your palm to your
forehead and murmur how absurd that was too).  The 'bugs' are also
handsomely detailed.  If the story was only half as good as the
special effects, then they might have something more interesting than
a stalwart band of fighters that just shoot-shoot-shoot and
kill-kill-kill.  
Unfortunately, in his quest to take the 'R' rating to it's limits, he
forgets that it isn't just shock value or incredible effects that we
look for.  Bereft of pathos, the film ultimately becomes as
interesting as the enemy bugs that the Federation must battle.  It's
full speed ahead without thinking about what comes next, except
possibly knowing that it will be something excessively absurd.

Title
Review for Romeo Must Die (2000)
I want to share a strange experience with you that I
always seem to suffer whenever my friends and I visit
a Chinese restaurant for dinner.  We order four or
five different entrees.  The food is brought to our
table and placed upon a Lazy Susan (a circular
platform that revolves so that you can bring a dish
closer to you without having to reach across the
table).  I sample a portion from each of the entrees. 
Yet, no matter how much I sample, I never seem to be
able to satisfy my hunger.  Perhaps this empty feeling
arises because the dishes feature only chunks of
chicken, slivers of vegetables, and slices of beef. 
For my kind of appetite, however, I'd prefer something
meatier that I can take a knife and fork to.  
"Romeo Must Die" suffers in much the same way as my
Chinese dinners.  It incorporates several plots and
sub-plots that lack a noticeable meatiness.  The film
opens with the murder of a Chinese warlord's son. 
This incident starts a chain reaction of events.  His
brother, Han (Jet Li), comes to America in search of
his killer.  Meanwhile, the unsolved murder increases
tensions between the Chinese sect and the Black sect
that are in an ongoing power struggle.  As the movie
continues, there's also a component that revolves
around a shady real estate deal, a brush with the
virtues of honor and loyalty, and a desire for the
leader of the Black sect, Isaak O'Day (Delroy Lindo),
to make things right with his life and his two
children.
There is just too much going on.  The only constant is
that just about everyone carries a spare gun and seems
blinded by vengeance.  The story lines converge from
different angles and at different speeds in ways that
left a strange taste in my mouth.  Try eating Orange
Chicken and Beef in Oyster Sauce in the same bite, and
you'll know what I mean.  The result is a movie that
is sprinkled with jumbled ideas, generally flat
acting, and only slivers of a comprehensible plot.
Among the Asian stars that are starting to gain a
noticeable foothold with American audiences (in
addition to Jet Li, I am referring to action stars
Chow Yun-Fat of "The Replacement Killers" and Jackie
Chan of "Rumble in the Bronx"), Jet Li's persona isn't
as cool or hip as Chow's and is certainly more fierce
than that of Chan's.  Although Li has a boyish face
and a meek demeanor, when he coldly stares down an
opponent and angrily mutters "THAT was a mistake," you
can see his rage begin to swell as he tightens his lip
and tenses his muscles.  Some serious butt-kicking is
about to happen.  Jet Li performs several
well-choreographed scenes in which his gravity-defying
maneuvers (aided by special effects) are stunning.  He
pummels lesser opponents while suspended upside-down,
executes an array of acrobatic moves, and utilizes a
host of props-as-weapons such as belts, fire hoses and
even other humans.  Another interesting effect to
highlight the impact of Li's blows is that the film
cuts to an X-ray view of the human body to show the
internal damage that he inflicts.  But his subtle
style is drowned out by the seemingly endless hail of
gunfire and the bass-heavy, urban flavored soundtrack.
The film's one bright spot was actually one of the
second rate thugs (Maurice played by Anthony Anderson)
in the O'day camp.  He seemed like the only one who
was enjoying his role.  However, the film is just too
unfocused to offer any real value.  We can't associate
with any of the characters, we have a tough time
following the plot, and in the end, we are just hoping
that Jet Li's fighting makes up for the lulls (and it
does).  So now we've come to the end of the review,
and I open my fortune cookie.  It reads: Chunks,
slivers, and slices aren't enough to sustain "Romeo
Must Die."

Review for Man in the Iron Mask, The (1998)
TMITIM does a couple of smart things to ensure that potential
movie-goers will at least think about seeing this film.  First, it's a
story that soothes us with the familiarity of Aramis, Athos, Porthos
and D'artagnan - the legendary four Musketeers.  Little introduction
is needed about these men, and we can quickly jump into the story.
Louis XIII, the great King whose throne the Musketeers served, has
died and has now been succeeded by his arrogant and cruel heir, Louis
XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio).  The original three Musketeers have now
retired from service and now live relatively quiet lives. D'artagnan,
still an active Musketeer, is now Captain of the young king's
bodyguards.  
Louis XIV is not a well-liked King.  His selfish actions result in
deep resentment by the people.  He is the target of numerous
assassination attempts.  He is also greatly disliked by the retired
Musketeers, who believe that this is a leader truly unworthy of a
Musketeer's devotion.  However, their ire for the king puts them at
odds with D'artagnan, who has sworn an oath to protect the king with
his life.  Nonetheless, the original three know that France will never
prosper unless a change is made.  A bold plan is devised, and it's
success rests on the Man in the Iron Mask, a mysterious figure that
was imprisoned years ago and almost forgotten.  The three Musketeers
must first devise a way to free him and then execute their plan.  If
they succeed, they could alter the future of France.  But, their
biggest obstacle is D'artagnan.
The other attractive element is that the film puts together an
all-star ensemble.  Co-starring Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gerard
Depardieu, and Gabriel Byrne as the Musketeers, it has tremendous
international star power and mass appeal.  
Yet, despite all these positive points, the story never comes close to
reaching the legendary status of the Musketeers.  One thing that was
unsettling was listening to the actors lines.  At times, they spoke
using the 'Dialect of Infinite Wisdom' (where one speaks so slowly as
if to simulate awesome intelligence), which was void of any conviction
or passion.  At other times, the banter was so tongue-in-cheek that it
seemed to purposely anchor itself in swashbuckling commercialism
rather than dramatic greatness.  Still, at other times, the dialogue
seemed so forced that actors looked like they were straining not to
look or sound foolish.  Additionally, there were some extraneous
subplots and some totally off-the-wall surprises that made me slap my
forehead or cock an eyebrow.
Written by Randall Wallace, the same person that wrote "Braveheart", I
really expected a powerful drama that would explore the rift between
D'artagnan and the Musketeers; the motivating nature behind the young
king; or even the possibilities that present itself when an impostor
with ambitions of sheep-tending assumes the almighty throne.  Yet it
seemed content on just being an action-adventure film about old heroes
that reunite to bring back an era that had been forgotten.  
I felt that a potentially great film was squandered.  TMITIM is an
uneven production that was glorious at some points but unfocused at
others.  I did, however, enjoy Gabriel Byrnes as D'artagnan, who
desparately tried to find a balance between his oath to the king and
his ability to live up to the code of the Musketeers.  And the
climactic ending is a rousing finish that shows how good this film
could have been.  But for much of this film, we needed a  fifth
Musketeer.  His name could have been Pathos!

Review for Doctor Dolittle (1998)
Cats meow; dogs bark, birds chirp, and tigers roar.  Have you ever
wondered what they might be saying to us?  For Dr. John Dolittle (Eddie
Murphy), he possesses a very special ability.  He can actually
understand them.  And those animals can also understand the Doctor.
Imagine the kind of unique information that they may hold.  A woodland
owl may tell of how its forest habitat is being destroyed.  Stray cats
could reveal where illegal activity may be taking place in some darkened
alleyway.  Perhaps the Doctor could do something to save an endangered
species with his unique communications skills or help to unravel the
mysteries of the animal kingdom.  But this film never gets even close to
the possibilities that naturally present itself.  
"Doctor Dolittle" is about a successful, straight-as-an-arrow doctor who
is too absorbed with his work.  But that is just fine for his fellow
co-worker Mark Weller (Oliver Platt), since they are about to ink a
lucrative deal to sell their practice.  After a traffic accident,
however, Dolittle is rekindled with his gift of gab.  Shock and hysteria
begin to settle in as he tries to push these unexplainable voices from
his head.  Dolittle carries on conversations with, among others, a stray
dog (voiced by an acerbic-sounding Norm MacDonald) and a hip-hop talking
hamster (voiced by Chris Rock).  This weird behavior alarms Weller as
this jeopardizes the deal.  But Dolittle begins to develop a renewed
sense of passion for his work knowing that he can help to heal animals
too.  Now all he must do is convince his family, co-workers and other
skeptics that he's not crazy.
Dolittle, the character and Murphy, the actor suffer from similar
scenarios.  They both make decisions that elicit disbelief.  The biggest
problem here is that we have a 30-minute scenario stretched into a
feature-length film.  And, the movie just isn't all that interesting.
The talking animals amounted to little more than a gimmick.  No real
bond is established between man and animal.  We just get a bunch of
unfunny sequences featuring talking animals.  Witness the scene at a the
vet's waiting room where animals discuss their ailments and another
extended sequence in Dolittle's house where a gallery of animals come
for some medical attention.   Celebrity voice-overs try to make these
animals sound funny (contributions from Julie Kavner, Albert Brooks,
John Leguizamo, Paul Reubens, and others), but most of the dialogue is a
real bore.  Also appallingly odd for a Disney film, the movie seemed to
lack the energy, magic and warmth that we have come to expect from their
studio.
Murphy does a charming job, but he just doesn't have enough material to
work with here.  Perhaps the funniest thing about this movie is the
inclusion of Oliver Platt, who seems relegated to playing perpetually
worried sidekicks.  Though a fine actor, he really looks like he wants
to be somewhere else.  Somewhere else is where you should be too.

Title
Review for Thin Red Line, The (1998)
One of the first images that we see in this film is of a crocodile
maneuvering itself into the murky waters as it lies in wait for it's
next meal.  It is a killing machine that preys mercilessly upon
unsuspecting victims.  In another scene, we see an idyllic island
village.  Children are playing innocently among themselves while the
adults carry out their daily chores practically oblivious to the
war-ravaged world that exists only a few miles away.  This is a
society that reflects Man's best nature.  But the nature of paradise
that we all hope to experience is always being challenged.  Desire,
vengeance, anger, and other urges' constantly push us further away
from Eden and into the same realm of the crocodile.  Soldiers, I
suppose, may struggle the most with this fragile balance between
protecting the goodness of society and killing others to reach that
goal.  How do they contain their urges'?  How do they stay true to
themselves?  `The Thin Red Line' looks at this issue several times
over against the backdrop of World War II.
The film introduces several characters who all have their personal
struggles.  Among them are Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) and Lt. Col.
Tall (Nick Nolte).  Staros is a lawyer by trade and has seen too many
of his friends die in his arms during the many campaigns with which he
has been involved.  He has a soft heart, and will do whatever he can
to protect those under his command.  Tall, however, is a man that has
been preparing for war for the last fifteen years.  Now that he
finally has his chance, he yearns to make an impact, even if it means
sacrificing many lives during an ill-planned campaign to overtake an
enemy stronghold.  He barks out orders with his gritty voice and
challenges his often-weary troops to rise up to the occasion.  Staros
takes exception to his zealousness and hesitates to execute Tall's
commands.  Other characters include Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) who is an
optimist that wants to find paradise; Capt. Gaff (John Cusack) who
doesn't like the prospect of being promoted; and Sgt. Welsh (Sean
Penn) whose soul has become irreparably cynical.
This film certainly doesn't play like a conventional war film.  A good
portion of the film focuses on the soldiers' thoughts about the
starkness of reality while scenes of their personal Eden flash back
and forth like some Nature channel montage.  As an entertainment
seeker, it would be difficult for me to recommend this film.  One
thing was that it was very frustrating trying to distinguish among the
many characters - especially when they're all covered with grime, dirt
and blood.  Character development didn't seem to be a high priority. 
In addition, many of the characters seemed to randomly appear and then
disappear.  There lacked a sense of consistency and it was hard to
become attached to any of the players.  Additionally, the movie is
just over 3 hours long, which makes sitting through this philosophical
exercise very difficult.  In fact, after the showing, many of the
patrons left with a somewhat bewildered or puzzled look on their
faces.  I suppose that they expected a more traditional kind of war
film, but got something completely different.  If you're hoping for a
film about war and it's potentially terrific conflicts, you can expect
and uphill battle.


Title
Review for Mercury Rising (1998)
Bruce Willis plays FBI agent Art Jeffries in a film about compassion and
conspiracy.  As a man living with a ghost and looking for redemption,
his chance for penitence comes when he is called to investigate a crime
involving the slain parents of Simon Lynch (Miko Hughes), an autistic
child.  Why were the parents killed?  The audience knows that Simon's
autism gives him the ability to 'see through' a newly developed
government supercode called Mercury.  A Mercury-encrypted message was
slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine, and when Simon reads it, he
calls a phone number revealed within the message.  When NSA officials
learn of this, they believe that Simon is a dangerous threat to national
security and decides to take drastic actions. "Nothing can connect the
boy to this office," says the NSA officer (Alec Baldwin).  Jeffries,
however, is unable to question the boy because of his condition.  But
when he learns that Simon's life is in jeopardy, he takes it upon
himself, at great risk, to take care of Simon and try to learn why Simon
is being relentlessly hunted down.  
This may seem like a formulaic movie to some degree, and indeed, several
elements here can be found in many other films of the same genre.  For
example, during his investigation, Jeffries must go into hiding as
several parties make him the target of a manhunt.  He has no personal or
family ties which justifies his apparent willingness to go way above and
beyond the call of duty.  He even has a partner who is reluctant to help
at first but then eventually gives in.  However, there are several
elements that makes this an enjoyable movie.
What I appreciated about this film was its restraint.  It finds a
suitable middle-ground that melds action and drama.  It never went
over-the-top, and took itself seriously by carefully underscoring its
dramatic elements.  Willis is perfectly cast as the anti-hero and ably
handles the reigns of this film.  He realizes that the stakes are high
and that saving the boy is not some kind of cavalier stunt.  His fear
and frustration can be seen on his face.  Despite his pug nature, he
tries to do the right thing.  A subtle level of suspense is maintained
throughout the film.  In a nicely executed sequence, both Jeffries and a
hired killer are looking for Simon in the hospital where Simon is
staying.  Later, all 3 of them wind up in the same elevator.  Our
attachment to Simon is quickly developed, and we cringe when the bad
guys begin to close in or when Simon decides to walk out into a middle
of a busy intersection or onto the middle of the train tracks.  We also
feel good when we see Jeffries finally begin to make inroads into
Simon's autistic world.
Mercury Rising has several moments that begs you to be 'open-minded' and
not question the reasoning behind some of the actions taken.  If you can
make these minor sacrifices, like I did, then it offers enough to make
this a satisfying movie experience.

Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
`American Beauty' offers us a glimpse into what really
fuels suburban families, like that of Lester Burnham
(Kevin Spacey).  In doing so, the film tears apart the
suburban myth of well-trimmed rose-gardens and
automatic garage door openers.  Sure, Lester may have
a nice house, a family, and a relatively secure
future, but his life isn't much more exciting than
that of a mannequin.  And though he projects a
constant smile, his life is just an endless spiral of
boredom and the highlight of his day is his morning
shower.  What has made his life so bereft of passion? 
Perhaps it's his prissy wife, Carolyn (Annette
Bening).  She also smiles a lot and tries to excel as
a real estate agent.  But her life is equally vacuous
and her soul is joyless.  Her self-confidence is
almost non-existent, and her marriage to the
milquetoast Lester is nothing but a loveless sham. 
Daughter Jane (Thora Birch) doesn't add any sanity to
this family either.  Even Lester admits that what
neighbors see is `a commercial for how normal we are
when we're anything but.'  
Now, dig a little deeper and look a little closer. 
This film reveals some very surprising things that you
would never think would exist.  What gets Lester's
juices flowing again is Angela (Mena Suvari), a friend
of Jane's that he begins fantasizing about.  Angela,
who confidently boasts about her adult experiences,
doesn't mind the attention and says that if Lester had
more muscles, she would be interested.  DING!  Lester
breaks out the weights and starts a running regimen. 
But this is just the beginning of the new Lester.  He
quits his job and blackmails his boss at the same
time, he begins smoking powerful marijuana, and he
buys a classic muscle car.  But why should Lester have
all the fun?  His radical actions prompt Carolyn to
begin an affair with her chief competitor while Jane
begins to take an interest in a mysterious boy next
door.
The wheels are set in motion and the film wonderfully
strips any conventions that we have of suburbia and
gives us some very strange yet sad characters with
whom we can empathize.  For Lester, it's time to let
loose.  He no longer cares about anything and while
chaos can destroy the sanctity of his home, it is the
only thing he appreciates now in his life. 
Consequently, the situations that he winds up in are
often funny, poignant, and amusing.  A counter-story
to Lester's life features a militaristic, homophobic
retired marine living next door.  He preaches
discipline to his son.  But like the Burnham's nothing
on the outside is as it really seems.  The real
interesting point that this film makes features
another of Lester's neighbors, Jim and Jim (Scott
Bakula and Sam Robards), who are gay.  Despite their
strange outward appearance, their lives were the most
normal of all.
The beauty of `American Beauty' is it's harsh
revelations and brutally frank situations.  
This is not a film that strives to entertain as a
comedy.  Rather it is a film that tries to scrape away
at the true nature of people like Lester Burnham.  As
Lester, Kevin Spacey is comfortable and almost too
real as the dispirited suburbanite whose last chance
at living is fading fast.  Annette Bening also shows
might in her portrayal of the brittle housewife. 
However all of the wonderfully developed characters
and their complexities will beg you to ask yourself
what may really be going on in your own cul-de-sac
world. 

Title
Review for Siege, The (1998)
You won't find a more determined and passionate FBI agent than Hubbard
(Denzel Washington), who now has the very difficult task of
confronting a new wave of terrorism that is spreading across New York
City.  But what makes his job virtually impossible in stemming the
tide is that the perpetrators, in this case Arab fundamentalists, are
all suicide bombers that do not hesitate to take their own lives as
long as it means the utter destruction of some building or the
meaningless death of innocent civilians.  What's worse, these
terrorist cells work independently of one another, which means that
there is no way to bring down the operation in one fell swoop.  The
first act of aggression is truly terrifying and leaves a lump in your
throat as you watch the scene unfurl.  Hubbard will summon all of his
resources to combat the situation.  
The fact that the suspected terrorists are Arabs brings Agent Elise
Kraft (Annette Benning) onto the investigation.  She has special
knowledge of the Arab sector, but also seems to have an ulterior
motive for being there.  Continually trying to circumvent Hubbard at
every turn, she wants to help the determined agent, but has her own
agenda to follow.
The first 40 minutes is actually quite intense, and really sets the
stage for possibly a great and thrilling movie.  But knowing that
Hubbard would be fighting several terrorist cells, I could see that
this film would suffer from a glaring weakness.  And it did.  Great
movies always have a great villain that masterminds the evil scheme. 
Remember `Speed', a movie about a mad bomber and a bus (played with
malicious intent by Dennis Hopper)?  But here, the fundamentalists are
all suicide bombers all too ready to take their own lives.  Once we
learn who they are, they are soon dead, either by bombing themselves
or shot down by the local police.  The all-important
hate-the-villain' factor is completely missing.
Terrorism and violence escalates.  The city streets are becoming
deserted.  Hubbard still can not locate the remaining terrorists
cells.  A state of martial law is thus declared and the film
completely shifts gears, now emphsizing a message over the manhunt. 
Suspicious of all Arabs, they are herded into interrogation camps
where they are harassed and humiliated.  It seemed like a strange turn
of events for the audience member.  I can't imagine that this movie
ever intended to be a statement on our constitutional rights.  If it
was, it was upstaged by a marvelously intense beginning.
I give credit to Washington who infused energy into his role and
Benning, who showed sass and smarts as well.  Bruce Willis, however,
had a thankless role as the General that oversaw the city during its
state of martial law.  His role asked him to do nothing but verbally
punch out military rhetoric and patriotic jingoism.   But the real
problem with this movie is that it hits the ground running, but
ultimately gets lost because the story abruptly shifts gears and
because the terrorists want to die.  `The Siege' starts with a
blitzkrieg of suspense, but its power wanes considerably over the
final 90 minutes.


Title
Review for Horse Whisperer, The (1998)
Redford Handles the Reigns as the "Horse Whisperer"
Hope, tragedy, and renewal are the tender elements that make up "The
Horse Whisperer", a thoughtful story that explores family, mature love,
and adult emotions.  Robert and Annie MacLean (Sam Neill and Kristin
Scott Thomas), though married, seem like a distant couple.  The father
lives on a sprawling ranch with daughter Grace.  Meanwhile, Annie lives
in the big city, is a frenzied editor of a major magazine, and has an
obsession with being in control.  A harrowing riding accident almost
kills young Grace (Scarlett Johansson) and her beloved horse Pilgrim.
Although they both survive, their emotional wounds are far worse than
the physical damage that they have suffered.  The horse becomes fearful
and jilted.  Meanwhile, Grace experiences profound indifference and
withdraws to the point where she believes that not only Pilgrim should
be put down to save him from the anguish that he is suffering but that
also she should be put down as well.  
Robert believes the doctors when they say that time heals all, but Annie
is not one to sit still.  She feels that every moment they waste, the
further Grace will regress.  Having researched many equestrian-related
journals, she reads about a man named Tom Booker (Robert Redford), a
Horse Whisperer who is a gifted sage that can help horses who have
suffered the same problems as Pilgrim.  Annie decides to seek him out
and makes the long journey to Montana with her now-contentious daughter
and Pilgrim in tow.  She hopes that if Mr. Booker can cure Pilgrim,
Annie will regain her spirit as well.  She also hopes that this
experience will bring the two of them closer together.
Redford agrees to help, but not unless Grace also gets involved.  Using
what seems like nothing more than patience and love, both Pilgrim and
Grace begin to respond.  Grace slowly comes out of her cocoon.  She
begins to accept her situation, allows herself to mourn her loss and
develops a closer tie to her estranged mom.  Meanwhile, another plot
begins to unfold as Tom and Annie slowly fall in love with one another.
His tenderness, good-looks, and the allure of the open skies and
picturesque landscape of the Montana frontier begins to break down
Annie's need for control and she finds herself feeling a renewed sense
of love.  Like Grace, Annie will have to ask herself to make some tough
choices about what she wants.
Considering the fact that Redford is in his 60s and Thomas is in her
40s, this is nothing short of a grown-up love story.  It is honest and
sincere in it's exploration of dysfunctional relationships and the
responsibilities and duties that come with family.  Spanning 160-minutes
in length, the film develops slowly as it pays respect to the kind of
relationships that can not develop in a short period of time.  Johannson
gives a worthy performance as the troubled youth trying to regain her
spirit and Thomas is cast well as the woman who tries to balance passion
with responsibility.  To sit through this without fidgeting, you'll need
the patience of a Horse Whisperer.  But Redford understands the charm of
the west, the importance of life, and the nuances of adult
relationships.

Title
Review for Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)
My favorite moment: two British blokes engage in a
street fight to see who is the better man.  This
sequence shows that when it comes to love, there are
no clear choices.  And in Britain where restraint is
the norm, two 'proper' men trying to slug it out look
amusingly like drunkards failing a sobriety test.
There's nothing like a cheery, romantic comedy to help
lift your spirits and reaffirm your love of life. 
Yes, a good romantic comedy is always welcome.  But
BJD, unfortunately and surprisingly, does not always
evoke the emotional highs that it constantly seemed
poised to reach.  It's almost effervescent.  It's
almost joyous.  It's almost magical.  And it came so
close to being great.  But something held it back.
The movie felt like a fervent throwback to the days of
Audrey Hepburn when there seemed nothing more
invigorating than a brisk ride down a country road
with the wind blowing through your hair.  Watching
this film, there are sequences that remind us of
timeless, romantic classics such as "Roman Holiday" or
"Sabrina."  
Renee Zellwegger is radiant as our heroine, Bridget
Jones, who seems to be the live comic strip character
version of "Cathy."  A little overweight and a little
bit neurotic (and very British), she struggles daily
with her sense of self-worth.  In a cute opening
sequence, Bridget droops in front of a TV and
lip-synchs to Celine Dion's syrupy "All By Myself." 
Will her life mirror the sad lyrics of soft rock FM
ballads forever?  Not if she can help it.  Armed with
a new attitude and a new diary to write down her
innermost thoughts and observations, she's ready to
make a difference in her life.  
Her life proceeds to take a series of life-affirming
as well as challenging turns as she becomes involved
with her handsome and successful boss, Daniel (Hugh
Grant).  He treats her like a movie star.  At the
outset, she's ebullient.  But doubts soon emerge.  To
add to her growing uncertainty, Mark (Colin Firth), a
childhood friend, seems to be waiting in the wings. 
More complicated, Daniel and Mark are bitter over an
episode that ended their friendship.  Who is the
better person? The audience will be somewhat divided. 
The film adeptly keeps us wondering who is good and
who is bad and who deserves to be forgiven and given
another chance.  
But there's also anxiety at home.  Her hilariously
dotty mom, infamous for her curry turkey dinners, has
left to be a presenter on a TV shopping network.  Her
dad has a perpetual vapid look about him and he always
seems to be in his pajamas.  These wacky characters
give this film a wonderfully offbeat quirkiness.
Despite its inherent appeal, the movie's magic falls
short.  At any given time, the film seemed like it was
destined to be a great romantic comedy.  But while
there's general gaiety, there's not enough emotional
pull.  Was the man that she chose truly Mr. Right? 
The "wow" factor behind her decision seemed muted. 
Most distracting and puzzling, though, was the
frequency of obscenities used.   With a little bit of
thought, this could have been retooled into a PG-13
version that could have been just as endearing.  BJD
certainly offers fireworks.  Yet they seem to be more
like the kind you'd see at a stadium after the home
team wins rather than the display during the 4th of
July by the Washington Monument, which is what we
deserved.

Title
Review for For Love of the Game (1999)
Among the many trailers that I've seen over the past few weeks, the one
that had generated the most interest for me was Kevin Costner's latest
release.  The preview is a wonderful, stately presentation of an aging
baseball star that is approaching the most important crossroads of his
life.  It hints that this will be an uplifting, glorious story.  But
like so many other great-looking previews, the film itself fails to
deliver what it promises.  In this case, what bogs this film down like
an overweight player is a distracting love story that sends it into
foul territory.
Billy Chapel (Costner) has had a long and storied career.  He has
pitched with the Detroit Tigers since he first entered the majors more
than 15 years ago.  In that time, he has garnered every major award
there is in baseball.  But now at 40 years of age, his dream may be
coming to an end.  He struggles with some very difficult decisions,
including possibly retiring and deciding what to do about his long
relationship with girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston).  Chapel has always
been a fighter, and his will and independence has made him a better
baseball player than boyfriend.  Jane laments, "you can win or lose all
by yourself.  You don't need me."  Her relationship with Chapel has
been more than frustrating at times.
Chapel is scheduled to pitch the last game of the season against the
powerhouse New York Yankees.  He has quite a lot to think about.  He
struggles to keep his mind focused during this important game.  I found
it interesting how the filmmakers illustrated the mindset of the
pitcher. As he readies his delivery in front of 50,000 screaming fans,
Chapel mentally squelches out all sound from his mind.  Meanwhile, he
visually blurs out everything except his ultimate target, the catcher's
mitt that awaits the pitch.  Chapel shows us that pitching is more than
just throwing hard.  It's about placement and about psyching out the
batter.  The baseball sequences are well thought out and would even be
enjoyable to those who don't know a thing about the sport.  The drama
is heightened effectively by the poetic play-by-play passages spoken by
veteran announcer Vin Scully.  
In between innings, he recounts the last five years of his life since
first meeting Jane.  We see his first encounter on the side of the
highway as he tries to help her with her broken down car.  We see her
upset over the fact that she can only see him when he comes into town
to play the Yankees.  And we see their relationship develop into a
one-sided affair.  Jane is very levelheaded and grudgingly accepts her
second place status to Billy's love with baseball.  But second place
isn't good enough.  
I am marginally recommending this film on the strength of the baseball
story and Costner's affable insouciance.  However, too much time is
wasted on his relationship with Jane.  Costner has great appeal, and I
can see how some kind of love angle must be a part of his films.  But,
the love story seems to happen completely outside the framework of the
film.  Jane has very little to do with his internal conflict nor does
it really impact the path that he ultimately chooses.  This is not
Kelly Preston's fault, who tries to add life to a flatly written
character.  The heart and soul of the story should have revolved around
Chapel's loyalty to his team, his uncertain future, and his passion for
the one thing that has made the last 15 years of his life a
dream-come-true.  Is this movie called "For Love of the Game" or "For
Love of the JANE"?  As with Costner's other baseball-themed films (Bull
Durham, Field of Dreams), "For Love of the Game" ably manages to evoke
the majesty and spirit of America's past time as magically as the '86
Mets.  The love story, however, fizzles.

Review for Lucky Numbers (2000)
Here's a piece of advice that you've always heard. 
"Don't wait until the last minute!"  If you do, you'll
have very few options at your disposal.  In the dark
comedy, "Lucky Numbers," manic Russ Richards (John
Travolta) finds that he's at the point where he's
waited way too long.  With no other way out, his only
route of escape is down the expressway of amorality.  
His journey towards the dark side stems from his
idiotic side ventures.  He's a greedy schemer and it
is this shortcoming that puts him on the brink of
bankruptcy.   All of his ideas seem destined to fail. 
In his latest enterprise, he has opened a snowmobile
dealership.  However, the area is experiencing an
unseasonable heat wave.  And as Christmas grows near,
wading pools are selling faster.  He's quickly losing
money, while the bank wants to foreclose on his home. 
He'll need to come up with a whopping plan to bail him
out of his precarious situation.
Yet, being unethical is not something that seems
totally alien to our desperate hero.  He oozes a slick
confidence and a hokey charm that suggests that no
problem is too big and that no solution is too
bizarre.  Most of all, he's ready to do what it takes
to bail out of his financial woes.  Or is he?
Realizing that his station broadcasts the Pennsylvania
State lottery drawing, he conjures up a plan to fix
the lottery and walk away a multimillionaire.  With
the help of his strip club owner friend, Gig (Tim
Roth), and Crystal the Lottery Girl (Lisa Kudrow),
they design and execute the unimaginable with
surprising efficiency.  So far so good.  However, when
other people get a whiff of what they've done, they
all want a piece of the winnings.  Russ gets
blackmailed for so much that he's now in even more
debt!  As more and more complications arise, his
options narrow and become less savory.  Soon, (and
this is one of the film's more clever twists),
fearless Russ is reduced to a cowardly state while the
daffy Lotto girl ascends into a greed-driven 'cleaner'
who goes out to tie up any loose ends.
Droll it is thanks to Travolta's bravura performance
with his exaggerated voice inflections and mannerisms,
but it's not as dark or as edgy as it should be.  This
is the kind of film where zany characters and absurd
situations drive the film.  Some, like the inclusion
of a two-bit but touchy-feely thug (Michael Rappaport)
and the asthmatic accomplice (Michael Moore) who
wanted to use his share "to buy his church a new
furnace and then use the rest to start an adult book
store" worked to heighten the film's tone of
absurdity.  But, others like the TV station exec (Ed
O'Neill) seemed flat while the inclusion of the
dimwitted cop (Bill Pullman) who stumbles onto the
case, didn't seem necessary, although it did add a few
goofball moments.  Most awkward, however, was Kudrow,
on whose shoulder the spirit of this film squarely
lies.  Crystal is liberated, conniving, and greedy. 
Kudrow doesn't possess that important sense of brazen
vulgarity, which would have made this film really fun.
 So, like playing the lottery, a few numbers hit and a
few miss.  Better luck next time.

Review for In & Out (1997)
With the high ratings generated last season by Ellen's coming-out
episode on her self-titled hit television show, it seemed like only a
matter time before the big studios released something along those same
lines.  The line, in this case, is the one that people cross when they
admit to others that they are gay.  Issues surrounding gay lifestyles
have increasingly crept up into mainstream Hollywood over the last few
years.  Most have been farcical looks at gayness such as the inanely
funny The Birdcage.  Other films feature gay characters to add
contrast and shock value to the story line as in Bound.  But this is
perhaps the first film that tries to take a semi-serious look at
someone exploring  his sexuality, discovering, in fact, that he might
be gay.
Semi-serious, of course, because the film focuses on high school
teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline).  In a small town somewhere in
America's idyllic heartland, Howard teaches romantic poetry, sits with
his legs daintily crossed, and wears a bow tie.  He is also outwardly
effeminate and also loves Barbara Streisand (he's seen Funny Girl a
dozen times).  Yet despite all of this evidence, he is engaged to a
wistful love, fellow English teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack).
As the wedding quickly approaches, fate steps in.  One night while
watching the Oscars, one of his former students, Camerron Drake (Matt
Dillon), garners the gold statuette for Best Actor.  In his acceptance
speech, he graciously thanks everyone, including his teacher, but also
announces that Brackett is gay to the millions of TV viewers, not too
mention the population of the town.  
Howard is stunned.  The town is stunned.  His parents quickly rush
over.  "Is there anything that you want to tell us," they gingerly
ask?  He exclaims, "I'm not gay!"   Soon after, the media storms into
town.  He becomes hounded by a second-rate reporter named Peter Malloy
(Tom Selleck) who is looking for his big break.  Moreover, Peter is
gay and has come out, and he urges Howard to do the same.
Ultimately, after a hilarious scene that focuses on Howard's
masculinity test, which he fails with flying colors, he realizes after
all these years why he runs around with a limp hand.  The rest of the
movie shifts its attention to how Howard copes with his new-found
lifestyle and how the town copes with him.  Under the direction of
Frank Oz, who breathes light comedy, we see Howard's life slowly
disintegrate around him.  Emily is furious, the faculty and students
become wary, his father is in disbelief (a wholesome-as-can-be Wilford
Brimley), and the dreams of his wedding-needing mother (a perky and
belligerent Debbie Reynolds) is shattered.   
Shattered is also how this reviewer felt after leaving the theatre.
In it's quest to explore breakthrough material, this movie seemed to
try too hard to remain politically correct.  It took great strides not
to mock anyone.  For a movie about gayness, it seemed
amazingly...uh...mainstream.  It seemed to be void of any major
conflict that demanded a resolution.  It seemed to lack any conviction
in trying to give this film bite.  It failed to connote the fragility
of the experience and seemed all to willing to let Kline's comic charm
lead his way nonchalantly in and out of precarious situations that
surrounded his sexuality.  The ending reeks of schmaltz as it looks
for a feel-good way to wrap it all up.
Perhaps the intent was not to rock the boat or to offer a
groundbreaking film.  That's probably better left to the independent
filmmakers. The movie is certainly not a work of comic - or
philosophical - genius either.  However, it's strong showing at the
box office signals a growing acceptance for movies that explore this
topic.  Your reward for seeing this film, though, is a great cast of
characters, especially Tom Selleck and Debbie Reynolds and also Bob
Newhart who plays the nervously cautious high school principal.  But,
that's the only reward you'll find.  Like the gay community, I'm sure
that I'm in the minority when I say that this film is a tepid comedy
at best.  In and Out meanders in and out of sometimes-amusing scenes,
but it never seems to quite go anywhere at all.

Review for Sixth Sense, The (1999)
As a part-time reviewer, I can only see one new release a week.  If I'm
lucky, I might see two.  And on this particular week when `The Sixth
Sense' was released, I decided to see `The Thomas Crown Affair' (good
choice) and `Mystery Men' (bad choice).  But three weeks after this
film's release, I see that it is still the #1 film in the country.  It
has already raked in more than $100 million.  And the funny thing is
that I had never even heard any advertisements for this film.  So
obviously, this is a film that is generating huge amounts of business
through word-of-mouth.  Why are throngs of people flocking to see this
film?  I just had to find out for myself.  And, I'm glad that I did.
`The Sixth Sense' begins by introducing us to Malcolm Crowe (Bruce
Willis).  He's a child psychologist that has been bestowed with one of
his field's highest honor for his commitment.  His wife, Lynn (Toni
Collette) quips that it's a commitment that makes his marriage second
priority.  This night is cause for celebration, but an intruder
interrupts his plans.  It's Vincent, a former child patient.  He's
visibly agitated.  He blames Crowe for failing to heal him.  He points
a gun at the stunned Crowe and pulls the trigger and then takes his own
life.
The next fall, we see Crowe healed of his injury, but perhaps still
spiritually wounded.  His next patient is Cole (a wonderful young actor
named Haley Joel Osment).  Cole shows outward signs of isolation,
paranoia, and fear.  In many ways, Cole reminds him of Vincent. 
Healing Cole would also help to heal Crowe's afflicted soul.  Cole is a
very special boy.  We are given hints that he has supernatural powers. 
When his Mom leaves him in the kitchen and returns five seconds later,
she is puzzled to see that all of the drawers and cabinet doors have
been opened.  He has uncanny insight into the history of his school,
which he explains as a place where they hung criminals.  And all of his
photos have a twinkling light that mysteriously appears in the
background.
Crowe is stoical in his approach to Cole.  He asks questions without
being imposing.  However, Cole looks at him with extreme skepticism. 
Up to now, no one has been able to help him.  He's also only about 10,
so he's not very sure about what he wants.  But he does know what he
doesn't want, and that is to not be afraid anymore.  After a tender
rapport is built, he finally confesses that he can see dead people. 
These ghosts walk around like the rest of us, but why they seek out
Cole is as of yet unclear.  With this premise in place, the film takes
on its eerie persona.  Cole is growing more frightful and the audience
sympathizes with him, feeling fear when Cole does.  Time may be running
out for Cole, and he may ultimately become like Vincent if he isn't
healed soon.  However, Crowe's obsession is destroying his marriage. 
Lynn hardly talks to him anymore and she seems to be drifting into an
affair.  
`The Sixth Sense' is like an old-fashioned ghost story.  It is chilling
at times and purposeful throughout.  Young newcomer Osment is the
film's strongest asset.  His mannerisms and delivery are terrific.  He
and Willis connect well and pull off many scenes that require perfectly
timed dialogue.  Willis is very comfortable in his role and gives us a
very likeable character.  But what really did it for me was its ending,
which of course I will not give away.  It added a totally new dimension
to the film and it hits you unexpectedly, but pleasantly, much in the
same way that `The Usual Suspects' concluded.  Perhaps with one of the
strongest endings this year, and as a picture that was much better than
I had expected, this film will reward your time as well as your senses.

Review for Scream 3 (2000)
In general, I've always hated the horror genre.  I do
not like films where the primary engine of
entertainment involves the spillage of gallons of
blood and where characters are brainless morons who
more or less deserve to meet the fate of having a
knife plunged through their backs.  But I found a new
respect for the genre when I saw the first `Scream.' 
It was an inventive whodunit/slasher flick that was
unexpectedly clever and truly frightening (and made my
Top 10 for that year).  `Scream 2' also managed to
establish a nice pace and a fair amount of tension. 
Alas, `Scream 3' is succumbing to what all horror
sequels begin to suffer.  And that's a lack of
creativity.
`Scream 3' takes place in Hollywood where filming of
`Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro' is underway.  Woodsboro,
as you may recall, is the sleepy town where the
stabbings first took place.  A new series of murders
begins to unfold.  The victims are cast members of
`Stab 3' and at each murder scene the killer points
out that Sidney Prescott (recurring heroine Neve
Campbell) will be an eventual victim.  Also reprising
their roles are David Arquette as the meek Dewey Riley
and Courtney Cox Arquette as the self-absorbed,
story-hungry reporter, Gale Weathers.  Dewey is a
technical advisor on the set of `Stab 3' having lived
through the Woodsboro events himself.  Gale shows up
after having heard about the murders.
As with the first two `Scream' movies, a couple of
trademark elements are carried forth to this
installment.  The first element is the explanation of
the rules of the game, and this is my favorite scene. 
Delivered posthumously on videotape by Randy Meeks
(Jamie Kennedy), a victim back in Woodsboro, he
explains that Sidney is caught up in a trilogy.
Secrets will be uncovered and in the end and only
Sidney or the killer will survive (I'm hoping that
he's also telling us that there won't be a Scream 4').
 The Whodunit element is also a fun aspect.  The
audience continually tries to guess whom the killer
is.  Is it the police detective who seems to have an
obsession with the Woodsboro murders?  Is it a
low-life producer who seems to be hiding something? 
Is it one of the `Stab 3' cast members taking their
role too seriously?  Just when you think you know who
it might be, you'll discover that you were wrong. 
And, of course, there's the multitude of `BOO!'
moments.  Dark buildings, creaking doors, spooky music
and that all-too-haunting ghost mask can just be
unsettling at times. 
These are the elements that made the `Scream' movies
hip and witty.  But `Scream 3' has lost a little of
its edge.  And it's not really the fault of the
scriptwriter or any of the cast members.  This film
just suffers from a been-there-done-that' kind of
feeling.  Even the looks on the actors' faces seem a
bit tired and worn.  Another problem was that the
characters were not as lovable as the ones from the
other `Scream' movies.  When they died (like Randy), I
cared.  Here, a couple of annoying characters
derserved to be stabbed.   Also, the killer who
finally reveals him/herself is totally arbitrary,
resulting in a very weak payoff, unlike the first two
installments.  `Scream' is still levels above than the
odious `I Know What You Did Last Summer' series.  And
I give director/creator Wes Craven a lot of credit for
reinventing the horror genre.  However, it's time to
put this baby to rest.

Review for Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The (1999)
Sinner or Saint?  Heretic or Savior?  The history
surrounding Joan of Arc has been subject to plenty of
interpretation by scholars over the last 5 centuries. 
And, it was only 500 years after her death that the
Vatican finally canonized her.  Why might have it
taken so long?  I would suspect that their was much
discussion on both sides as to whether Joan indeed was
a messenger from God or just a poor peasant girl with
delusional visions, incredible amounts of courage, and
tremendous luck.  This movie doesn't advocate either
side, and that was one of the problems with `The
Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc,' a somewhat flat
depiction of one of history's most enigmatic icons.
Joan, pronounced `Junne' (played by Milla Jovovich),
has received hints throughout her young life that
portends to a future that no 19 year-old girl could
ever be prepared to handle.  These hints include
various visions and even a sword that she finds while
frolicking through the countryside.  Junne believes
that God is trying to give her a message.  She must
free France from her enemies (based on a historical
occurrence when England was supposed to annex France
through a treaty).  She visits Charles, dauphin of
France (John Malkovich), to tell him of her divine
role, and is given an army with which to cleanse the
French countryside of English troops.  Charles and his
advisors may be skeptical of her baseless claims,
which really has to be taken on faith, but any kind of
victory would garner him support among the masses as
he prepares to accept his crown.  Meanwhile, Junne,
who is only a messenger, has a strange effect on the
French army.  Their strength seems greater while their
morale increases, believing that God is on their side.
 Against all odds, they score unlikely but critical
victories in the war.  Junne is regarded a hero. 
Charles' popularity soars.  All of this takes place in
the first half of the movie, and for the most part, I
am more or less satisfied with how the movie has
unfolded. 
Director Luc Besson is true to form in bringing to
life a 15th century world when miracles in France were
sorely needed.  You may recall Besson's eye-popping
`Fifth Element', and here, his visualizations are
equally impressive.  Take note of the sheer pageantry
of Charles' coronation.  I was also impressed with the
medieval warfare, meticulously presented from the
inner workings of a catapult to the various defenses
(such as cauldrons of boiling oil) that the attacking
French must navigate.  The siege of an enemy tower is
the highlight of the film.  Melee is depicted
graphically with arrows piercing bodies and flails
crushing heads to a bloody pulp.
But the 150-minute movie wanes in the second act as
attention turns towards Junne's inner demons.  Now
King, Charles withdraws his support for Junne.  She is
eventually captured and tried for heresy.  While
awaiting trial, she is visited by another vision (who
looks like Dustin Hoffman).  He asks her to explain
her actions, which seem so contradictory to all of His
commandments.  Junne is naturally confused about her
current state, and the vision tries to help Junne
discover her own answers.
Besson is ambitious in his portrayal of Joan of Arc. 
Jovavich would have been more likeable if she wasn't
screaming at the top of her lungs throughout the film.
 Of course, it's hard to hear a 19-year old girl when
there are thousands fighting around you.  The film's
strength is in its visuals.  But dramatically, the
movie couldn't generate the power and seemed fearful
in committing one way or another to her cause. 
Perhaps God motivated her.  Perhaps vengeance did. 
Sinner or Saint?  Heretic or Savior?  Perhaps only God
will ever know.

Review for Payback (1999)
Don't mess with Porter (Mel Gibson) because if you do, he'll take
matters into his own hands in a moment's notice.  Don't cross him
because if you do, you're going to feel his wrath.  Don't steal from
him, because if you do, he will stop at nothing to exact revenge.  It
doesn't matter what his obstacles are in his way and it doesn't matter
how well you try to prepare yourself.  This is a man that is extremely
clever, and when he finds you, he'll give you a smirk and coldly pull
that triggereven if it's only for a paltry $70,000.
After a flawlessly executed heist, Porter and his partner, Val (Gregg
Henry), make off with a cool $140,000.  Half of it will be given to
Porter, but in this line of work, double-crosses are not uncommon. 
Although Val made off with the entire amount, his gravest error was
that he left Porter alive.   After recovering, Porter wants his share
and he'll do whatever it takes.  It's time for a little payback.  And
that's what this film is about.  There are no twists or turns.  Porter
wants his money, and the situations that he encounters en route to his
money are rather entertaining.
A couple of things makes this movie entertaining.  Foremost is Gibson,
who looks very comfortable as a bad guy who uses a sordid sense of
cruelty to accomplish his goals.  He's not intimidated by anyone nor
does he show any fear.  In fact, he welcomes danger.  He's just plain
crazy, which makes him fun to watch.  Why risk your life for a mere
$70,000 of money that wasn't yours to begin with? To get what he
wants, he has to outmaneuver corrupt policemen, old enemies, and a
host of hit men.  But he's also believably clever.  So despite the
fact that he gets into situations that are more or less suicidal, he
manages a way to save himself and get closer to payback.  The other is
the sense of style that this film projects.  Written by Brian
Helgeland, who co-wrote `L.A. Confidential,' there are some clever
elements where Porter finds ways of tricking the enemy and
unexpectedly turning the tables on others.   Once the movie sets its
tone, you'll also find humor (believe me, you will) in the absurdity
of the violence (smashed fingers, crushed toes, groin stomping, and
lots of other painful scenes).  The violence is warped in the same
manner that sex was warped in `There's Something About Mary.'  One of
the more amusing (or bent) supporting players was Lucy Liu, who played
Val's psuedo-girlfriend and leather-clad dominatrix.  In one scene,
Porter threatens Val with bodily harm.  Before he can strike him, she
begs Porter to stop and then proceeds to beat him up instead.  When
Val tries to hit her back, Porter points the gun at him and says, `Let
her finish her work.'  If you like this film, you'll discover that you
may have a delightfully cruel sense of entertainment.  I did.


Title
Review for America's Sweethearts (2001)
There are three problems that suck all the fun out of
"America's Sweethearts," a romantic comedy with enough
star power that should light up a city.  First, Larry
King, who provides a two-minute cameo, gives the most
zestful performance among the reputable ensemble cast.
 On his show, he lustfully berates his guest, film
actress Gwen Harriston (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  She's
a beautiful and an accomplished celebrity, but her
stardom has faded over the past two years.  Why?  As
call-in listeners will tell her, they lament and
complain about her previous decision to separate from
her popular husband, film actor Eddie Thomas (John
Cusack) in favor of a Castilian boy toy (Hank Azaria).
 Eddie, shattered by that incident, has become a
permanent fixture at a secluded Serenity Institute
where he is taught peace, gratitude, and unfathomable
words of wisdom ("life is like a cookie," says its
wizened leader).
Second, the most intriguing character, Lee Phillips
(played by Billy Crystal), is swept aside into
obscurity by the end of the film.  Lee is a lubricious
press agent who is tasked with assembling a blowout
press junket for the estranged couple's last film.  At
first, he seems to provide a welcome dimension of
edginess to a somewhat uninspired film.  Watch him
scheme and put his plan into motion as he coddles,
appeases, maneuvers, and exercises damage control. 
This formidable task requires wit and energy. 
Unfortunately, he is eventually relegated to flippant
one-liners and crude sight gags with a Doberman
pinscher.
Third, the center of this film (the real reason we're
going to see it) never generates any real momentum. 
This involves a budding love triangle between the
narcissistic Gwen; her frumpy but sweet sister, Kiki
(Julia Roberts); and the neurotic Eddie.  But the
tension is only lukewarm.  In fact, the best scene of
the film is given away if you've seen any of the
trailers.  It's really no contest between the two
siblings.  Kiki's character is the only one grounded
in reality, and becomes the only person that you begin
to care about. 
All of this overwrought melodrama makes much of the
film uncomfortably ham-fisted. The first 30 minutes
(when we meet the major characters in their individual
environments) are especially corny rather than funny
and sadly laughable rather than amusing.  It strains
for laughter and the interplay between the characters
feels laborious.  
All of these actors are much better than this material
would suggest.  Zeta-Jones was delicious in "Traffic";
Roberts charm was played to perfection in "Notting
Hill", and you'll miss Cusack's unique brand of
quirkiness, offbeat humor, and wry behaviorism from
films past.  Perhaps, this role was a bit too
mainstream for him.
"America's Sweethearts" failed to evoke that
indescribable feeling of joy, weirdness, and goodness
that are the necessary ingredients in a love story. 
Partly, Roberts could not particularly shine as she
was obscured behind the star power of the other
actors.  Partly, the film spends too much time as a
lampoon about the junket scene (where multitudes of
critics ask the same questions, eat for free, and
think up quotes like "America's Sweethearts Lacking
Chemistry").  Thus, the film lacked conviction and its
tone becomes fuzzy.  Sometimes it's cute.  Sometimes
it's clever satire about Inside Hollywood.   But more
often, it's just unremarkable.  Ultimately, it's
inability to generate more than just some fleeting joy
will leave you heartbroken.

Title
Review for Traffic (2000)
"Traffic" is a kaleidoscopic look at the famous War on
Drugs.  Melancholy in tone, the film presents a
scathing indictment about America's inability to
adequately counter the proliferation of narcotics and
its woeful aftermath.  From the most affluent,
civic-minded members of our society to the most
reprehensible base, this multi-layered story looks at
how the influence of the drug trade destroys or
corrupts all that it touches.
The most poignant and ironic among the interwoven
storylines is that of federal judge Robert Wakefield
(Michael Douglas) who has just been appointed to be
the newest drug czar.  He's passionate about his job
and genuine in his desire to curb the smuggling
operation of the Mexican cartels.  He meets important
people (various Senators make cameo appearances) and
takes a trip to the El Paso Drug Enforcement
Administration Headquarters to closely examine
government interdiction strategies.  Yet, while he
believes that his trip to the Mexican border puts him
on the front line, he practically never realizes that
the problem has already hit tellingly close to home. 
This suggests that America is losing the war, and this
theme rears itself constantly in all of the scenarios
presented.
It's not just America that has to contend with the
drug problem.  Even Mexican officials take great
interest in it.  However, with the high level of
corruption within the government, it's not necessarily
clear whether these officials are trying to squelch
the supply of drugs or are trying to monopolize it. 
In its most complex storyline, Tijuana cop Javier
Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) must tread carefully
after he is recruited by an army general to help
squash one of the cartels.  He soon learns, though,
that he is in a battlefield where it's never clear who
his enemies or his allies are.
A third storyline is more conventional, but no less
biting about the futility of stemming narcotics
trafficking.  Two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis
Guzman) catch a drug mob underling (Miguel Ferrer)
whom they turn to testify against his powerful boss. 
The snitch banters philosophically that the agents'
efforts will only be a waste of taxpayers money while
competing cartels will only become more powerful.  As
with the other two scenarios, it's all very solemn
stuff as the good guys struggle to fight a war in
which hope seems to be constantly smothered by the
effects of the white powder.
"Traffic" boasts strong performances by the ensemble
all-star cast (especially Del Toro).  It also benefits
from a directional style that helps to make this
otherwise complex story easy to follow.  Of note is
the use of its visualizations that help to
differentiate the stories currently happening
onscreen.  The Mexican world, for example, is somewhat
blurry and is shot using pale yellows to bring out the
squalor of that environment while the Washington elite
is shot with regal colors and is in focus to denote a
world of protocol and order.  However, be warned if
your goal is to find entertainment.  This is an
issue-driven film with a pronounced documentary feel. 
It might even seem like some revved up program that
you might see on The Learning Channel.  Therefore,
while many of the scenes will be intense enough to
capture your interest, the film's lack of drama may
turn you away.  But no matter what you eventually
think, the material will undoubtedly raise a few
eyebrows.

Title
Review for Out of Sight (1998)
"Out of Sight" - Clooney Robs Banks, Steals the Show 
Who said that the bad guys were the ones that always ran from the law?
If you find the rare opportunity to talk to a person like Jack Foley
(George Clooney), you'll find out that he's intelligent, personable and
loves the movies.  He has admirable principles, possesses an understated
charm, and is a likable guy.  Never mind the fact that he has been a
bank robber throughout his life, and never mind the fact that he has
just escaped from prison.
During his escape, Foley is forced to take hostage FBI agent Karen Sisco
(Jennifer Lopez).  However, Foley doesn't resort to threats and scare
tactics during this period of tension.  Rather, he is collected and
begins to engage in a conversation about his ex-wife, friends and his
love of movies.  Though she is scared, there's a sort of comfort that
she gets from his voice.  A strange but believable attraction begins to
take shape.  "What if we met under different circumstances," he muses.
Yet despite their developing bond for one another, Sisco knows that she
ultimately must arrest the escaped convict.  Meanwhile, Foley has his
own agenda, which leads him and his friend Buddy (Ving Rhames) to
Detroit where a former inmate now lives.  This inmate (Albert Brooks)
once ill-advisedly bragged how he kept $5 million in diamonds at his
place.  For Foley, this could be his big break.  If he can successfully
pull off the robbery, allude the tenacious Agent Sisco, and also stay
ahead of a rival gang of former inmates who also know of the diamonds,
he can retire and escape to some far away island.
"Out of Sight" incorporates much of the skewed humor, sharp dialogue and
absurdly violent situations seen in "Jackie Brown" and "Get Shorty" (in
fact, all these movies are adapted from work by Author Elmore Leonard).
This is the kind of film where we become more interested in what a
character thinks and not what he does.  Clooney does a terrific job as a
man who is constantly looking for ways to maneuver through various
obstacles in order to reach his goal, whether its finding a way to meet
Sisco or finding the stash of diamonds.  Lopez is also very good and
projects the right look of a woman who wants to make the arrest while
teasing with the idea of first having an affair with him.  Together,
they have chemistry and a smoldering sexuality.  Meanwhile, they are
surrounded by a colorful and rich cast of supporting characters, and
each of them gets ample opportunities to show us how unique, strange,
and odd their crime world is.
The film makes me wonder how interesting it must be to be a part of this
kind of world, as fragile and hostile as it may be.  The film's greatest
pleasure comes from it's dialogue.  Add a funky electronic piano and
bluesy guitar score, and you have a film that looks good, sounds good
and feels hip.

Title
Review for Lost in Space (1998)
"Danger, Will Robinson, danger!"  These mere four words may have been
among the most venerable that survived the fickle decade of the '60s.
Although only verbal remnants from television's past, Hollywood hopes
that this familiar phrase will entice a generation of adults and their
children to watch one more adventure featuring the space-faring
Robinsons.  Dr. Smith, Father John, Mother Maureen, sisters Judy and
Penny, young Will, and Robot have all been resurrected in the '90s
version of a family who gets lost in space.
In the future, with Earth dying and her natural resources at dangerously
low levels, ongoing efforts have been made to find a suitable sister
world to colonize.   The only one that they know of is half way across
the galaxy.  To complicate matters, a rival humanoid species
(Seditionists) is also trying to be the first to colonize that planet.
John (William Hurt) is a leading scientist and has decided that their
family will be the first to make the long 10-year journey across the
galaxy.  At the helm is Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc), an accomplished
fighter pilot as seen in the beginning, visually spectacular, fight
sequence.  If they safely arrive, the Robinsons can construct a space
portal that will link to another space portal, currently being
constructed in Earth's orbit, which would make transportation between
the two planets almost instantaneous.  But the Seditionists want to
thwart their attempts and use Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman) as their saboteur.
Suffice it to say, while it is an interesting premise that gets the
Robinsons into space, it is a contrived sequence that eventually brings
the entire cast together on a ship that has been thrown off course, lost
in the galaxy.  And despite the fact that it might seem that this film
would focus on the wild dangers and life-threatening hazards that would
face any pioneering family, at its core, it is a film about family
values (togetherness, sacrifice, et al.) buried under layers upon layers
of special effects.  Presumably, children may learn something valuable
but not even realize it.  But given the gravity of the Robinson's
situation, the movie seemed too tame to be an effective science-fiction
thriller and too 'tense' to be a story for children.  It fell somewhere
into the murky middle.
A lot of territory in "Space" is left unexplored.  The beginning battles
suggest that even greater dangers await, but most of the following
action is tepid at best.  As a family ripped from their roots on Earth
and forced to travel light years across the galaxy, all except one
seemed all too willing to just leave everything behind.  There was lots
of room for more drama and more excitement.  The film only devotes 'just
enough' time to showcase young Will's budding genius or John's search
for balance between his mission and his family.  I was also disappointed
with Judy, who spoke, perhaps two lines in the whole film.  Played by
Heather Graham, she was worlds away from her unique performance as
Rollergirl in Boogie Nights.  Here, she is reduced to shooing away the
egomaniacal Major West, whom, of course, she eventually gives in to.
Oldman, however, seemed to enjoy his role as the malevolent Dr. Smith.
There's a scene that perfectly encapsulates the tone of this film.
After boarding a drifting ship, the party soon discovers that it is
infested with metal and flesh eating, spider-like creatures.  Young
Will, using a 'holographic interface', assumes control of the robot.  It
looks like one huge video game as he zaps the oncoming critters.
Consequently, there is as much thrill here as there is playing Space
Invaders.  "Lost in Space" is full of imaginative special effects, and
may turn out to be the next big simulation ride at Universal studios.
But as a major film, it comes across looking and feeling like an
overblown Saturday morning cartoon.

Review for Small Soldiers (1998)
Forget about GI Joe.  Those action figures are now a thing of the past.
Today, a new generation of fighting toys are more gruff, rough and buff.
They have scowls a mile long.  And, they possess a sophisticated
microchip that enables them to talk, move about, and display other
characteristics that makes them seem alarmingly alive.  These are the
Commando Elite, led by Chip Hazard (voiced by Tommy Lee Jones).  Barking
out a melange of patriotic clichés ("ask not what your country can do
for you, but that you have only one live to give"), he leads his troop
of warmongering-named soldiers like Butch Meathook, Nick Nitro, and
Brick Bazooka on their one and only mission.  They are to destroy the
Gorgonites, an odd assortment of drawing board rejects whose greatest
talent is finding places to hide.  Gorgonites are also equipped with
these sophisticated microchips, but are programmed to lose in battle.
Led by the majestic lion-like Archer (voiced by Frank Langella), their
mission is to find freedom.
Young Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith), son of a toy store owner, manages
to get his hands on these figures before the rest of the world.  But
once the Commando Elite and the Gorgonite action figures are unpacked
within close proximity of each other, the toys take on a life of their
own.  The miniature military men begin to hunt down their prey.  Archer
appeals to Alan for help, who agrees to protect the Gorgonites.  This
alliance infuriates Chip Hazard, and he and the Commando Elite begin to
formulate a plan which involves building lots of small-scale yet
surprisingly harmful weapons, transforming skateboards and wagons into
military vehicles, and a plot to kidnap Alan's love interest (Kirsten
Dunst).
This movie is a little boy's imagination running wild.  The Commando
Elite use tremendous creativity to construct weapons such as a bomb made
from aerosol cans, a helicopter that launches bottle rockets and weapons
that fire staples and nails.  They are also genuinely threatening, which
may make this film somewhat frightening for the little ones even though
this movie about toys.  These soldiers are menacing and even ruthless at
times.  Trying to carry out their mission using any and all means
possible, there is a lot of destruction and mayhem in this film.  Not
much time is devoted to the interesting relationship between Archer and
Alan.  It's basically an all-out blitzkrieg of toy soldiers programmed
to annihilate the Gorgonites and their human allies.  Consequently, it
seems that only teenage boys would really like this kind of film.
Despite it's narrow appeal, this film is something of an enjoyable
curiosity spawned from the recesses of someone's inner child.  It's not
family-oriented affair such as Toy Story.  And it's certainly not
adult-oriented action fare either.  It falls somewhere in the murky
middle.  "Small Soldiers" is for the rebellious little kid that once
lived inside of us who enjoyed little green army men, raced Hot Wheels
and Matchbox cars, and loved the Autobots and Decepticons.

Title
Review for Double Jeopardy (1999)
I think that at some point, Tommy Lee Jones, who I
think is a very talented actor, must be able to find
some work that doesn't involve him reprising his role
from `The Fugitive'.  In that memorable film, (to
which this one will undoubtedly remind you of) he
plays a smart lawman with the tracking ability of a
bloodhound.  In a recent film, `US Marshalls,' he did
the same thing.   And in this film, well, you kind of
get the point. 
Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd who oozes with potential
but always winds up in mediocre movies) wakes up one
night on her yacht to find that her husband, Nick
(Bruce Greenwood) is missing.  There's blood
everywhere, and when Libby manages the courage to
begin searching around, the only thing that she finds
is a bloody knife.  Just as she picks it up, a coast
guard cutter arrives thinking that she has sliced and
diced her husband to death.  Despite the fact that the
body is never found, the prosecution convinces the
jury (through nothing but circumstantial evidence) to
convict her of the crime.  During her incarceration,
she discovers that Nick is alive.  He has somehow
framed Libby for his murder, though the reasons are a
bit unclear to me.  Now she only wants to get out of
jail to track him down.  Six years pass by and she
learns one very important thing  the principle of
double jeopardy.  It states that once the State
convicts you of a crime, it can not retry you for the
same crime.  So, in essence, she's free to walk up to
Nick and shoot him the head.
Armed with this knowledge, but with very little else,
she manages to get paroled.  Her parole officer is the
gruff and man-of-little patience Travis Lehman
(Jones).  Though he will throw any one who breaks
curfew back into jail without hesitation, Libby
escapes the first chance she gets.  Lehman now goes
after her (allowing those that he oversaw to break
curfew all they want), and the chase is on.  Can Libby
clear her name before Lehman tracks her down?  I
wouldn't think so.  She's just not well equipped to do
so.  She's not a killer, so it's hard to believe that
she would actually cold-heartedly pull the trigger
when she finally does find Nick (which the movie
trailers tell us that she does).  And though she makes
phone calls, surfs the internet and makes inquiries
here and there, she doesn't really seem to have a plan
of attack.  As a result, the film just proceeds along
like some Kansas interstate highway.  There are no
turns or twists or anything that would play on the
irony of her situation.  There are some scenes that
heighten Libby's fragile predicament such as when she
plunges over the side of a ferry or when she is
entombed next to a decaying corpse.  But this just
tries to pump some juice into a film that just doesn't
have enough electricity to keep going.
`Double Jeopardy' just lacked any significant amount
of style and intrigue.  The film doesn't exhibit the
kind of energy that these kinds of chase movies need
nor did it create any kind of chemistry between the
hunter and the hunted.  If you ever look through the
newspaper ads for movies currently playing, you'll
always notice quotes from various sources when there
is something good to say.  The funny thing is that
when you look at the ad for `Double Jeopardy,' you'll
see a quote from, of all places, NYLON magazine. 
Anybody ever heard of them?  When you start pulling
quotes from those kinds of places, it should be a sign
that this is one to avoid.

Title
Review for Chill Factor (1999)
The summer season for movies is fast approaching an end.  As I think
back about the summer offerings, there has been a dearth of the
standard shoot-em and chase-em movies compared to last year.  There
were a fair share of comedies, a handful of mature dramas, and a
stunning showing for scary films.  But where were the standard staples
of summer?  The prototypical action flick was probably rarer this year
because studios finally figured out that audiences are craving for
movies that titillate the senses or tickle the funny bone.  Gratefully,
the standard shoot-em up fare is moving towards extinction.  Perhaps
these films will find their future as straight-to-video releases. 
Although `Chill Factor' is probably as competent as any other summery
action film, this is also a film that you'll probably see at your
neighborhood Blockbuster's within eight weeks.
In this film, the U.S. government has been secretly testing a chemical
weapon that can evaporate human flesh within a matter of seconds.  The
problem is that scientists have been unable to control the energy of
this chemical reaction.  The only thing that they do know is that the
chemical (which looks like blue, semi-gelatinous crystals) must be kept
cold, less than 50 degrees.  Otherwise, the chemical reaction would
start.  There's nothing as cleansing as a radioactive facial.  If an
enemy nation were able to get their hands on it, they could easily wage
a destructive war guaranteeing themselves that their enemies will all
dissolve into dust.  There's an overly elaborate set-up to introduce us
to the person that wants to steal and auction it off to the highest
bidder (in this case, a vindictive former Army officer).  With his band
of hired mercenaries, they infiltrate a top secret research facility to
make the theft.  
The bandits are unsuccessful, and the chemicals wind up in the hands of
two average citizens.  One is Tom (Skeet Ulrich), a brooding guy who is
overcome by a sudden wave of patriotism.  He must deliver the chemicals
to an Army base about a day's trip away.  But he must keep the
chemicals cold.  Luckily, he meets up with Arlo (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) who
just happens to be an ice cream truck driver.  Arlo has nothing better
to do with his life, and despite the fact that transporting the
chemicals means almost-certain death, he grudgingly decides to help
Tom.
What does sustain the film is Gooding's fun nature.  There's a certain
charm that he has when he yelps his dissatisfaction at their
deteriorating situation.  Another ongoing joke seems to be that Tom and
Arlo can only flee using very unlikely getaway vehicles, including a
beat-up ice cream truck and a UPS brown van.  But with the villain hot
on their trail, Tom and Arlo face a series of challenges in order to
stay alive.  Driving along a narrow ledge high atop a mountainside and
tobogganing down the side of a mountain are just some of their wild
getaways.  And though they face such overwhelming odds at surviving,
they still manage to buy ice along the way to keep the chemical cool. 
The movie is predictable and formulaic from beginning to end.  It has
its light moments (thanks to Gooding) and a relatively brisk pace, but
beyond that, this film is about as exciting as the Vanilla in Arlo's
ice cream truck.

Title
Review for Rules of Engagement (2000)
"Rules of Engagement" is a film that starts off
promisingly as a drama that combines the elements of
friendship, honor, sacrifice and conspiracy.  But just
when it seems that the power of the film is about to
be unleashed, the movie somehow implodes.  It switches
gears in the latter half of the film and becomes a
debate about military ethics and codes of conduct,
ultimately degenerating into a formulaic military
courtroom drama.  We know that at some point during
the trial, the accused will slam the podium in front
of him in disgust, stand up, and let forth a roar that
sounds conspicuously like "you can't handle the
truth."
The film begins with an intense and well-executed
Vietnam-era battle sequence that introduces us to
Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and Hodges (Tommy Lee
Jones), two soldiers in the same unit that become
lifelong friends.   This battle results in heavy
casualties, though these two are lucky enough to
survive.  Hodges finishes out his military career as a
mildly successful lawyer.  Childers, however, has
continued to serve his country admirably through
several dangerous conflicts, and is now a highly
decorated Colonel.  
The courtroom sequence that I mention above occurs as
a result of the actions taken by Childress. He and his
troop are sent on a difficult mission to protect a
foreign embassy and its diplomat (Ben Kingsley) from
an unruly mob.  At the scene, rocks are being thrown,
bullets are being shot, and firebombs are being
ignited.  The situation is getting ugly.  Childers'
men are coming under fire that causes him to issue a
questionable order.  This has dire ramifications for
him and for our country.  To quell the international
furor that has arisen, a conspiracy begins to rear its
ugly head.  As a result, Childress will be
court-martialed and may face a long prison sentence.
Childress asks Hodges to defend him.  At first
reluctant, Hodges says, "I'm good enough to know that
you need someone better than me."  But it's hard for
him to refuse his lifelong friend.  He works quickly
to gather evidence, to interview witnesses, and to
determine the fate of videotape that may exonerate
him.
Once the story moved inside the courtroom, however,
the momentum generated begins to dissipate.  This is
not the fault of Jones and Jackson, who are two very
talented actors.  But there is nothing less satisfying
than watching a couple of attorneys question and
cross-examine a slew of witnesses as they try to
convince a jury that their particular case is the one
to believe.  Even worse, there are many missed
opportunities that could have been effectively used. 
For example, the diplomat gives false testimony to
make himself look better.  His wife (Anne Archer)
knows that he's lying.  We are teased with the
possibility that this will lead to something dramatic.
 But it never happens.  
Despite the fact that "Rules of Engagement" loses much
of its momentum during the trial phase, there were
still enough positive points to recommend this
offering.  It starts off as a taut and suspenseful
film.  Good points about combat ethics and actions
under fire are brought up.  Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel
L. Jackson bring wit and energy to their roles.  There
is also an undeniable pleasure derived from watching
the gritty Jones defend his friend against the
tenacious government prosecutor (Guy Pearce).  But
given the ethical quandaries that the film brings
forth, the film's resolution was too quick and easy. 
There seems to be a message that is trying to be sent.
 The film is unconvincing in its ability to deliver
it.

Title
Review for Air Force One (1997)
Blending the action-gripping essence of Die Hard and the claustrophobic   
intensity of Executive Decision, the resulting elixir is a potent mixture   
in the form of Air Force One.  Being such, it is a high-flying adventure   
that offers a lot of roller-coaster style excitement in this airborne   
suspense thriller.
Harrison Ford stars as the President of the United States.  After Russian   
terrorists (led by the sinister Gary Oldman) somehow board the world's   
most advanced and secure airplane, they eventually overtake the   
presidential plane and hold everyone hostage, including several chiefs of   
staff, a bevy of secret service agents, and the president's family.  In   
exchange for the safe release of the hostages, the terrorists demand that   
the Russians release a recently captured military General, who was   
imprisoned for heinous acts of tyranny while in power.
It is an extraordinarily high price to pay for the hostages safety.  Not   
only do the Russians not want to release a madman that could undermine   
the stability of the Russian government, but the leadership at home, led   
by Glenn Close as a formidable Vice-President and Dean Stockwell as a   
must-take-action Secretary of Defense, also vehemently stands by   
America's principle to not negotiate with terrorists.  However, if his   
demands are not met, he will execute one hostage every 30 minutes.
Air Force One doesn't really amount to anything more than a simple story   
about the good guys trying to retake the plane and defeat the terrorists.   
 But it is the caliber of the actors and the fine ingredients thrown into   
the movie recipe that makes this summer fare worth sampling.  Ford is   
reliably charismatic as the President -- stern and tough, but still   
vulnerable when faced with decisions of the heart.  Ford becomes the   
anchor for all that is American; all that is good; all that is just  and   
will die for his country.  Oldman plays his character with delicious   
intent as a psychotic militant bent on carrying out his demands.   Oldman   
is the anchor of future Russia (at least as he sees it).  He is equally   
willing to die for his beliefs as well.
Additionally, the movie incorporates several excitement-heightening   
components that keeps you at the edge of your seat.  There is the   
constant cat and mouse chase through the tight confines of the airplane.   
 There is constant ingenuity displayed as the adrenaline-rushed good guys   
try to find different ways to free the hostages or to land the plane.   
 But most of all, there is no doubt that of all the protagonists of the   
summer, there is no one worth rooting for more than the President (and   
America) -- the embodiment of truth, justice and the American way.  And,   
it was also interesting to see the capabilities of Air Force One, loaded   
with sophisticated gadgetry and advanced military technology.
Yet, despite this generally, excitingly, executed storyline, you'll find   
that the ending was somewhat of a letdown given all that had transpired   
as you question the motivations behind one of the main characters.  So   
much so, in fact, that it slowed much of the momentum as the movie wound   
to a close.  Nonetheless, the fast-paced action, the fine all-around   
performances, and the sheer enjoyment value of the film earned its wings.   
 I salute this fine summer offering.

Title
Review for Game, The (1997)
In the uppermost echelon of society, you would probably find someone
like Nicholas Van Orton (played by a staunch Michael Douglas).
Successful investment banker and multi-millionaire, he is certainly
not wanting for anything that is material.  After all, he owns a
lavishly decorated palatial mansion, a top-of-the-line BMW, and works
in the Van Orton building in a part of downtown where property values
soar.  In a sense, he is a man who has everything.  Unfortunately,
materialism is all that he is interested in.  Cold-hearted and
discompassionate, he is only interested in the bottom line and
increasing shareholder value, even if it means firing people on a
moment's notice.  So inflexible is he that even his wife is forced to
leave him.  He is the Scrooge of the 90s.  
One day, his brother Conrad (manic Sean Penn) pays Nicholas a visit to
wish him a happy birthday.  He ponders, "What do you give to a man
that has everything?"  Conrad, a recovering addict, seems to always be
on the verge of a breakdown.  But he claims that he's a changed man
because of something he tried...something sold by a mysterious company
called CRS...something that will "change your life."  He urges
Nicholas to experience it as his birthday gift.
The movie now begins to position itself as a psychological-mystery
thriller.  Things odd and haunting start to happen.  Did that CNN
anchorman just mention Van Orton's name over the airwaves?  Why did
that pen leak when it did?  Is that bum begging for money for a hidden
reason?  Significance or coincidence?  Hmm...   Nicholas is given
enigmatic clues and mysterious keys.  He becomes inexorably drawn into
a dangerous game where the rules are not apparent, and where he can
never tell if he's being put through a gag or if his life is in real
danger.  Immense paranoia begins to creep in as he begins to
scrutinize everything from strangers to friends, open bottled water to
even the sincerity of his brother.  
Questions constantly pop into his mind.  Is this really some game?  Is
Conrad doing something nefariously evil?  Who can he really trust?  Is
Nicholas just going insane?  It seems like everyone is against him,
and Nicholas learns through sadistic victimization just how cunning
and shrewd CRS is.  And as the movie progresses through its maze-like
plot, they begin to strip him of everything, from his $4000 suit to
his financial reserves to his dignity and finally his own identity.
But nothing can conquer his will to survive, and using his own cunning
and intelligence, and some impressive detective work, he begins to
piece together the puzzle in order to retake his life.
But, herein lies the problem.  The Game is a movie that's been broken
apart into pieces, like a jigsaw puzzle.  You think that one piece
fits, but then find out it doesn't.  There are twists and turns almost
every 10 minutes.  When you think you've advanced, you run into a dead
end.  But it's up to Douglas to fit those pieces together, and
depending on whether you like being kept in the dark a lot, we're
seeing it all happen through his eyes.
I appreciated the way in which The Game tried to keep viewers riveted
to the screen, urging the viewer to look for anything that might have
been a tangible clue.  This is also a handsome piece of film making as
we see the god-like Douglas gradually diminish into the background of
San Francisco's mystique.  And, I liked Douglas's alpha-male
personality. Douglas is in every scene and never drops his intensity
or focus.  The supporting cast and the eerie lead female who gives
Douglas hints into what's going on are equally good.  But while it's
sometimes edgy, the conclusions are letdowns.  And while there are
surprises galore, you become annoyed with the way the story yo-yos
back and forth.  
Also, despite Nicholas's increasing jadedness and growing disdain and
fury, things work out disturbingly and incongruously well.
Ultimately, the writers seem to lack the convictions of their
material, and work way too hard to resurrect Douglas in the last 15
minutes of the film, causing a very abrupt detour and a very sour
ending.  What could have been a unique psychological thriller is
reduced to a post-modern "It's a Wonderful Life."  I don't know about
you, but I've seen that movie way too many times.  I was not
particularly intrigued with this offering.  The Game provides the
satisfaction of outmaneuvering a better opponent at Chess, musters the
fill-in-the-blank allure of poker but gives the stop-and-go action of
Chutes and Ladders.  The Game toys with you, but you don't get the
reward that you deserve.

Review for Analyze This (1999)
If I've learned anything from watching movies with a Mafia element in
it, it's that the big bosses never have it easy.  They're constantly
being assailed by gunfire, busy plotting out their next crimes, and
always being chased by the law.  It's enough to give the toughest boss
a panic attack.  
Even kingpin Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) is not immune to the pressures
of his job.  He is the head of a powerful mob family who strikes fear
in those who dare to cross him.  Though he is tough, he begins to lose
control of his ability to command others.  Among other things, he's
beginning to have trouble bringing himself to kill people (a vital Mob
job requirement).  If others find out about Vitti's inadequacy, he'll
be targeted for sure.  He needs to quickly find a psychologist to help
him out.  The therapist that unluckily finds his way into Vitti's life
is Dr. Sobol (Billy Crystal).  Meeting Vitti couldn't come at a worse
time in his life.  He is about to marry his fiancée (Lisa Kudrow) and
wants as little to go wrong as possible.  But Vitti doesn't take no
for an answer (Vitti funnily says that he only hears no' when his
victims are whimpering for mercy), and Sobol begins to try to help him
resolve his personal problems against his better judgment.  But it's
not going to be easy helping Vitti become a well-adjusted gangster. 
And from that point on, an uneasy but sometimes droll friendship
begins to develop.
There seems to be lots of potential comedy in this kind of setup. 
DeNiro has played the tough mob boss many times over, and Crystal is a
funny guy when he has the right material.  But the material here
doesn't really let any of these two gifted performers shine.  On the
one hand, there is the slapstick comedy using Crystal's likeable
demeanor against DeNiro's stone-faced, tough-guy persona.  But most of
the comedy seemed subdued and reduced to mini-skits.  DeNiro's a good
sport as he satires his past Mob roles by, for example, crying during
touching commercials.  But I felt that Kudrow's role was no different
than watching Phoebe with an attitude (on Friends).  The comedy never
makes it past the lightweight status because the dialogue focuses too
much on one-liners, and it didn't seem like there was any thought to a
scene's setup other than letting Crystal and DeNiro square off against
one another.  The other strange thing was that at points, the movie
tries to take itself too seriously such as when Crystal begins to
unravel the root of the problem or at the end when the film seemingly
gives up on its premise by showcasing a bizarrely timed hail of
gunfire.  It seemed as if someone just picked this ending out of a
hat.  These kinds of scenes made the film seem uneven.  
`Analyze This' had some cute moments and some clever ideas.  There are
moments that are droll and other moments that seem to last a bit too
long.  DeNiro does carry himself well, but there's not enough here to
put his teeth into.  Even at 106 minutes, the film seemed a bit long. 
If you analyze this, you'll probably come up with the same conclusions.


Title
Review for Titus (1999)
"Titus Andronicus" was one of Shakespeare's first
plays.  It is not regarded as one of his better plays,
but the story of an honorable warrior at odds with a
spiteful Queen is nonetheless an ambitious and epochal
tale of valor, vengeance and vindication. 
Shakespearean work has enjoyed a resurgence these last
few years and we have come to enjoy some of his tales
told through cinema with offerings such as Romeo +
Juliet, Hamlet, and a Midsummer's Night Dream. 
"Titus" however has a much darker subject than any of
these recent films.  It is a tragic and seething drama
about vengeance most foul.  It is a chilling tale that
showcases unbridled malice in a manner that is almost
shocking and certainly unlike any Shakespeare work to
which I have been exposed.
"Titus" of the film is played brilliantly by Anthony
Hopkins, who seemed born to play this role.  His
loyalty to his king and country is so great that he
would even slay his own kin without hesitation if it
was the honorable thing to do.  As part of his duties,
he is to carry out a ritualistic sacrifice of a young
man.  The mother, Tamora (Jessica Lange), begs Titus
to spare her son's life.  But her pleas go unheard,
and the deed is done.  Tamora swears that she shall
exact revenge when the time is appropriate.  In other
early scenes, we meet other characters that revolve
around Titus's life.  These include Saturninus (Alan
Cumming) and Bassianus (James Frain), two Princes who
are vying for the recently vacated throne.  Livinia
(Laura Fraser) is Titus's beautiful daughter who is
betrothed to Bassianus, but is also the object of
desire of Saturninus as well as Tamora's two sons,
Chiron and Demetrius (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Matthew
Rhys).  We also meet the brother of Titus (Colm
Feore); Titus's four sons; and Aaron the Moor (Harry
Lennix), another schemer who is like a tutor to
Tamora's two sons.
These introductions occur in the first 25 minutes of
the film.  With the number of characters being
introduced and my inability to fully comprehend
"Shakespeare-speak," I actually found it difficult to
stay focused.  In addition, the setting of the film is
a fantastically dreamy and imaginative world where the
past and present simultaneously co-exists.  In one
scene, you'll see chariots and spears.  In another
scene, you'll see motorcycles and machine guns.  I say
that it's like a dream because it's both beautiful,
yet contextually challenging.
By the second act, the story becomes more focused. 
Tamora has ascended to Queen by winning the heart of
Saturninus.  With her new powers, she now begins her
quest for revenge.  Her sons also engage in rancorous
behavior.  However, their amorally reckless actions
stem from youth and boredom rather than from a need
for revenge.  Tamora's and her sons' wickedness comes
at great expense to Titus.  The climax of the film is
a hauntingly beautiful scene at a crossroads where
Titus has finally exhausted all patience, and his
loyalties have all but dissipated.  Now the once-proud
and honorable warrior must gather up his remaining
strength to combat the injustice that has been
afflicted upon him.  
The film is appropriately rated "R" for adult themes
involving decapitated body parts, implied cannibalism,
and a wanton need for revenge.  Though Shakespeare is
taught at middle school levels, only the maturest of
audiences should witness the baseness of the
character's actions.  In many ways, it is a beautiful
film that is ambitious, creative, and showcases superb
acting.  Yet, for all it's achievements, I can not
help but point out that the movie will probably only
appeal to fans of Shakespeare's work.  I also found
parts of the story weak.  I questioned the need for
Titus's brother, lamented that the deliciousness of
the Saturninus character (my favorite character) fades
away as the film progresses, and found the ending to
transpire too quickly given the dialogue-heavy
structure of other vital scenes throughout the movie. 
In the theatre where I saw this, many were moved by
the events that unfolded on the big screen.  Others,
however, slept soundly until the lights went up.  I
was sometimes at a loss, primarily due to my inability
to fully comprehend "Shakespeare-speak".  But, I was
impressed with what I saw.  I sat up and took notice. 
And, this film certainly deserves to be recognized.

Review for What Dreams May Come (1998)
I've always been told that there are two things in life that are
unavoidable - death and taxes. Oddly, I've never given much thought to
either of the two.  Maybe if I did, at least I'd stop getting
collection notices from Uncle Sam.  Yes, let me make a resolution to
devote myself to better record keeping, hold on to all my receipts,
and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are
mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties.  It seems that
the issue of death may not be so different, at least envisioned here
in this film.  As this tender love story goes, if you do good things
and have a clear conscience when you die, you ascend to a place of
great peace and beauty.  The dreams, wishes, and fantasies that you
had when you were alive come true.  For those who die with a burdened
soul, however, they wind up in that other place.
Chris and Annie (a winsome Robin Williams and a radiant Annabella
Sciorra) seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has
to offer.  Their love for each other is strong and their bond is
undeniable.  But tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of
Annie's happiness.  And when Chris dies after a terrible car accident,
she commits suicide - a tortured soul who blames herself.   Despair is
perhaps the greatest sin, and she will wallow in her guilt throughout
eternity.  Chris, on the other hand, has made it to heaven, and upon
learning of Annie's fate, he journeys to Hell to find her and to try
to free her from her nightmare.
This film brims with imagination, containing a lush imagery that shows
the arcadia that is Heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that
is Hell.  It seems that Heaven and Hell could very well be a product
of our fantasies or nightmares.  It's shape and look is as infinite as
our imagination.  As Chris explores his new fantastic world and
discovers things both amazing and wondrous, he also begins to learn
more about himself.  Certain questions baffle him at first.  Why does
his home in heaven ooze with paint?  What is the significance of the
Asian stewardess?  Why does he have an all-too-willing guide (Cuba
Gooding, Jr.) to help him find Annie?  But as he slowly begins to
realize the answers, it makes him stronger and gives him a greater
chance to save Annie.
"Dreams" is both visually and tellingly beautiful.  Alas, I have one
regret.  The movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed,
but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying.  It seemed as if it was
racing to some kind of great finish, but its intensity seemed to wane
in its final moments.  However, your eyes will still well up with
tears and you'll find lots to savor.  The storytelling is purposeful
and well constructed.  The journey is imaginative.  And I was
surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.


Title
Review for Zoolander (2001)
"Zoolander" is a little comedy that says to itself, "I 
think I can  I think I can."  But try as it might, it 
never quite makes it over that hill. 
While trailers make it seem like a spy flick parody, 
"Zoolander" is practically the opposite of Austin 
Powers.  AP is a shagadelic, bespectacled spy that 
touches the world of fashion.  Ben Stiller's 
"Zoolander" is a fashion model that touches the world 
of spy.  Apparently, there is a subtle conspiracy 
taking shape in the world of fashion.  Male models are 
being groomed to become lethal assassins.  Why?  Male 
models are in top physical condition, they can gain 
access into the most secure areas, and they always do 
what they're told to do.  "That's not true," protests 
our dim hero.  "Yes it is," replies a shadowy figure! 
"Oh, ok," says Zoolander, cowering in agreement. 
That's pretty much the heart and soul of this film, a 
sputtering satire of the fashion industry and the 
dim-witted milksops that inhabit it.  It's funniest 
aspect pokes fun at the extreme vanity and intense 
competition among the top models.  Hansel (Owen 
Wilson) is an up-and-coming rookie that threatens 
Zoolander's dominance.  Clearly, this new threat riles 
the vain veteran.  It eventually leads to a 
challenge/walk-off in which these two get to strut 
their best and funniest stuff down a runway.  Another 
funny segment involved an aging hand model whose hand 
was encased in a hyperbarbic chamber. 
Regardless of the way Zoolander moves down the catwalk 
or the sighs from women when he purses his lips and 
flashes his patented 'blue steel' pose, he is 
gloriously empty-headed.  The cure for any of his 
problems is a cup of orange mocha frapaccino and an 
impromptu water fight.  
His general state of ineptitude catches the eye of 
evil fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell).  Our 
villain is facing a crisis in Malaysia where the newly 
elected leader has promised sweeping labor reform. 
Without the cheap labor that Mugatu has been 
exploiting, his already-pricey fashions will 
skyrocket.  He will need to kill the leader and will 
'recruit' Zoolander to do the deed.  Ferrell is the 
life of this party and obviously enjoys hamming it up 
for a laugh. 
Stiller also displays convincing enthusiasm for his 
work (so much so, that his character could have been 
called Zealander).  Yet despite the concerted efforts 
of everyone, the gags and the overall silliness wears 
out faster than last season's fashions.  "Zoolander" 
just doesn't have enough going for it beyond the 
dumb-as-nails/narcissism angle.  In fact, the entire 
essence of the film is captured in those Heineken beer 
commercials. 
Did you ever notice that when a company tries to 
promote a product, it uses stars as testimonials? 
That seems to be what's happening here.  Cover models 
Christine Taylor and Milla Jovovich have supporting 
roles while a host of Hollywood medium-weights show up 
in cameo roles.  And, as this is a VH1 production, 
they would be remiss in excluding trendy rockers like 
Lenny Kravitz and David Bowie.  Well, you have to give 
them credit for really trying.  But perhaps Frankie 
Goes to Hollywood said it best when they sang, "Relax, 
Don't Do It."

Title
Review for Little Voice (1998)
`Little Voice' is one of those many offbeat comedies that depicts and
odd slice of British life and those that inhabit its strange little
world.   At the center is LV (Jane Horrocks), short for her nickname
of Little Voice, which was given to her by her mom.  LV is a very shy
and almost reclusive girl who seems to always stare at the ground and
bites her bottom lip in fear whenever someone talks to her.  When she
speaks, she emits a wavering, mousy voice.  It seems that the only
thing that makes her comfortable are the pleasant thoughts of her
now-deceased father and listening to a large record collection that he
had left to her.  When she feels threatened, which seems to be a
majority of the time, she drowns herself in the music that was left to
her by her dad, which she blares over the phonograph. 
Any chance that she has of becoming a normal girl who can interact
freely and confidently with others is constantly being challenged. 
Her mom, Mari (Brenda Blethyn), is her biggest obstacle.  Her wild
ways, LV believes, led to her father's early death.  She constantly
puts LV down and is openly annoyed with her.  The mom is also reckless
in her ways and promiscuous in her actions.  To get the attention of
men, she gleefully says, `let's roll about.'  One of the men that she
winds up with is Ray Say (Michael Caine).  He was a once-respected
talent agent who is now relegated to scouting for strippers in a
not-so-nice part of the city.  
As in most situations where the only way is up, everyone is looking
for that frequently elusive route that will allow them to leave their
dismal lives behind.  For LV, it might be a young telephone repairman
(an underutilized Ewan McGregor) that she recently met.  He has a fond
interest in pigeons, and somewhat understands LV's situation, for she
is similarly caged up from the rest of the world.  For Mari, it might
be Ray Say.  Sure, he's no longer the force that he used to be, but he
still has a way with words, and those words speak volumes to the
star-struck Mari.  And for Ray Say, his ticket back to his previous
stature might be LV.  Say makes the startling discovery that under
certain conditions, LV can magically transform herself, enabling her
to sing uncannily like some of the greatest divas of yesteryear,
whether it's the breathy Marilyn Monroe or the brash Shirley Bassey or
the wistful Judy Garland.  She is a singer/impressionist
extraordinaire.  `You're sitting on a gold mine,' Say says to Mari. 
`Dreams that you dare to dreamshe can make them come true.'  The
focus of the film now shifts to a test of wills between Say's and
Mari's desire to exploit her versus LV's simple wish to find normalcy.
In the end, I felt that the story was uneven at times (the implied
romance was unnecessary) and the resolution seemed unrealistically
quick.  But Horrocks is a real gem.  It's incredible how a fearful
child can completely and believably transform herself into a singing
dynamo that slinks and shimmies on stage.  She's real fun to watch and
is a great singer too.  In fact, she sings all of the songs that you
hear in the movie.  Caine effectively lends his talents as an oily
huckster, although in the end his character turns very mean for no
apparently good reason.  Also, Blethyn is an unexpected comic force as
a maddening, wench-like mum.  Several nice performances from the cast
make this odd slice of British life something to be heard and seen.


Title
Review for Enemy of the State (1998)
I have a friend who works for the NSA, a pseudo-government agency
that, from the looks of this film, has the ability to shadow your life
without you ever really knowing it.  Whenever I ask him what he does
there, he can only reply, `pretty cool stuff.'  I guess that if he
actually did any of the things that was depicted in the film, it would
be classified' as pretty cool.  Apparently, they can hear your
cellular phone conversations, access your bank statements, and put you
under the watchful eyes of hidden cameras 24 hours a day.  Privacy no
longer exists if the NSA enters your life.  As the watchdog for our
beloved citizens, their powers could get pretty scary if they had more
authority to initiate wire taps and other methods of surveillance. 
And that's what Director Reynolds (Jon Voight) seems to want.  To
promote his the-NSA-must-know-all' philosophy, he will use every
means possible, including the execution of a key congressman and any
other enemy' that stands in his way.
Unbeknownst to Robert Dean (Will Smith), he has been labeled an enemy
when sensitive information is passed on to him.  He doesn't even know
that he possesses this information, but soon becomes the target of a
massive manhunt.  Hiding is virtually impossible.  They bug his house
and make use of an eye-popping number of surveillance equipment, while
a platoon of agents discretely follow the lawyer wherever he goes.  
Steps are taken to discredit him by manipulating the media.  They also
make it difficult for him to escape by, among other things, canceling
all of his credit cards.
Why is everyone chasing him?  What secrets does he possess which
causes the NSA to invade his life?  He meets up Brill (Gene Hackman),
an unlikely ally with an enigmatic background.  He is a former NSA
operative and can help Dean stay ahead of them as well as help him
find the answers to his questions.
While "Enemy" is more-or-less suspenseful and showy, if you strip away
the techno-babble and the Morse code-like sound effects whenever
satellites are being repositioned, you basically have a conventional
manhunt.  Will Smith is reliably affable as a man looking for answers,
who has to rely on help from questionable sources as well as enjoy a
little bit of luck.  And I enjoyed Hackman as the bitter recluse who
understood all too well about how the government stealthfully lives
among us.  But consider this film more of a message rather than a high
octane vehicle that pushes its way from one scene to another.  How
much of our own constitutional freedoms are individuals willing to
give up for the sake of national security?   Maybe the State is its
own worst enemy.


Title
Review for Reindeer Games (2000)
Since this film's setting takes place during the
season of giving, I feel compelled to give at least
one compliment. I like Ben Affleck, who plays an
amiable anti-hero that gets himself caught up in a
case of mistaken identity.  But would I be a scrooge
for saying that the film itself has the unenviable
feeling of being caught under the mistletoe with the
dogfaced Gary Senise?  
"Reindeer Games" is a film that has the intention of
being a not-so-ordinary action film.  It tries to be
hip.  Case in point: the beginning scene starts off
with the camera showing several dead men in Santa
suits and then in the next scene displays the words
"Six Days Ago," bringing us back to when the story
begins.  It tries to add some spice to its characters.
 Case in point: a henchman philosophizes about the
economic advantage of adding another Christmas holiday
to bolster retail sales (not a good idea if it means
more movies like this).  It also tries to be
unpredictable.  Case in point: there are plot twists
galore.
But "Reindeer Games" is only sophisticated enough to
gather these elements together.  There they are, just
sitting there.  And like oil and water, they never
seem to be able to mix.  What a shame, because in the
hands of a more talented group, this could have been a
really fun movie.  
Ben Affleck plays Rudy, a small-time car thief who is
about to be released from jail.  The first thing that
he wants to do with his freedom is to get a cup of Hot
Chocolate and a slice of Pecan Pie.  His cellmate,
Nick (James Frain) will also be released on the same
day.  Over the last few months, Nick has been
receiving love letters from a mysterious woman named
Ashley (Charlize Theron).  Nick has never met this
woman.  She's a pen pal who learned of Nick through
one of those prison magazine personals.  Nick's wall
is plastered with pictures of Ashley, who is quite
adorable.  And he reads her letters to Rudy, who is
moved by her prose.  Nick, unfortunately, falls victim
in a prison fight and when Rudy is released and sees
her waiting outside, Rudy assumes Nick's place. 
"Don't do it, Rudy," he says to himself.  But how much
of a conscience does a thief really have?
Although things seem blissful at first, she is a woman
who can only draw you into trouble.  Ashley is
connected with a group of gun-running truckers.  Led
by the sinister-looking Gabriel, (perpetually scowling
Gary Senise), he has read Nick's letters and knows
that he was a security guard of an Indian-run casino
and that he is familiar with their safeguards.  Of
course, Affleck-as-Nick couldn't tell you where the
bathrooms are, but to avoid being killed, he goes
along with the charade as best as he can.  Ashley
weeps, "I've finally found a boy that I'm crazy about,
and my brother wants him worse than me."  I'm weeping
too because despite Affleck's affability and
potentially interesting material, "Reindeer Games"
doesn't amount to much more than a conventional action
film.  Been there, done that, seen it all.
Though I shouldn't do this, I think about all of the
opportunities squandered.  One of the main points of
the movie is that Affleck-as-Nick has no clue about
security at a casino.  Can you imagine him bumbling
his way around trying to case the place out without
arousing the suspicion?  We also learn that none of
the truckers have ever committed robbery before.  Here
is a golden comedic opportunity that may take place of
the senseless yet inevitable bloodbath at the film's
conclusion.  You may remember that in my review of the
"Whole Nine Yards," I had said that this gangster film
is a comedy that would have been better off as a
drama.  "Reindeer Games" is just the opposite.  It
tries to be a hip action film, but would probably be
better off as a psuedo-comedy.  Thank goodness this
film wasn't released before the Christmas season. 
Otherwise, it would have certainly dampened my holiday
spirits.  

Title
Review for Road Trip (2000)
"Road Trip," a tale about four underachieving college
students who embark on a hastily planned journey, is a
4-lane highway of laughter and is one of the funniest
movies in recent memory.  Convince your friend to
drive you, steal a bus from a school for the blind, or
walk through the backwoods as fast as you can. 
Whatever mode of transportation you choose, make your
final destination this hilarious new comedy.  
The tone is effectively set up within the first five
minutes of the film as we join up with Barry (Tom
Green), a career Senior at Ithaca University, who is
in the midst of giving a tour to a group of
prospective incoming freshman.  Barry is a bag of
mixed emotions composed of 3 parts lethargy and 1 part
morbid curiosity.  During the tour, he rambles about
Ithaca's history and points out, for example, that its
library was built in the 1600s.  A flustered tour
participant points to an ornamental plaque by the
library's entrance and retorts that the building was
actually built in 1951.  "No," he says after some
self-deliberation.  "That's the address."
As part of the tour, he relays the story of
long-distance couple Josh (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany
(Rachel Blanchard).   He attends Ithaca while she
attends a university in Austin ("That's in
Massachusetts," says the likable but dimwitted Barry).
Josh worries about the pact that they made to stay
close.  To show his commitment, he prepares a
videotaped message professing his undying love.  His
sexually adventurous friend, E.L. (Sean William Scott)
tries to explain to him that holding out for a
long-distance love could be the greatest folly of his
life.  He imparts, "the window of opportunity to
drink, do drugs and get with girls is getting smaller
with each passing day.  Before you know it, you'll be
40 and you'll have to pay for these kinds of girls."
Josh is unfazed, but after a wild party hosted by
E.L., he winds up with college hottie Beth (Amy Smart)
and subsequently videotapes his act of infidelity. 
Guess which videotape gets mistakenly sent to
girlfriend Beth?  Aghast, Josh has only a matter of
days to travel to Austin to intercept the tape and
then to get back in order to take a critical final
test.  In a matter of days, he could lose his
girlfriend AND get expelled from school.
E.L. exuberantly yells, "all right, road trip!"  Along
for the ride is levelheaded, pot smoking Rubin(Paulo
Costanzo) and the meek and thin-as-a-pin Kyle (DJ
Qualls) who is invited because he's the only one with
a car and a credit card.  Without giving notice, the
four hurriedly leave.  This infuriates Beth who,
thanks to Barry's command of American geography,
boards a bus to the University of Massachusetts to
find Josh.  Barry, meanwhile, uses their absence to
fulfill his dream of feeding Rubin's pet boa
constrictor.  And Kyle's ill-tempered father (Fred
Ward), who could easily make the National Rifle
Association jittery, thinks that his son has been
kidnapped.  Meanwhile, the four Austin-bound students
experience their own share of setbacks and bizarre
encounters.  In its funniest segment, the group tries
to pass themselves off as brothers of an all-black
fraternity.  A great road trip isn't about where you
wind up, but what happens on the way there.  These
guys will experience the trip of their lives.
"Road Trip" is this summer's most refreshing
alternative.  But it will appeal most to the under 35
crowd.  It's a crisp, straightforward comedy.  It's
not ribald (i.e. "There's Something About Mary") nor
is it a lampoon ("Naked Gun").  It's more like
'guerilla comedy' where the jokes just seem to come
out of nowhere and then latch onto you until you
laugh.  The humor is relentless, the pace is lively,
and you'll come out of it grinning from ear to ear.

Title
Review for Pay It Forward (2000)
In "Pay It Forward" (based on Catherine Ryan Hyde's
recent book), a melodrama brimming with cynicism, we
see that bad things happen to good people.  What's
worse, the more good you do, the more you'll get
punished for it.  
Victimized most by this odd paradox is 7th grader
Trevor (Haley Joel Osment).  He performs these
magnanimous acts of kindness because his erudite
Social Studies teacher, Mr. Simonet (Kevin Spacey),
has challenged the classroom with an extra credit
assignment: "come up with an idea to change our world
and put it into action."  The unusually benevolent
Trevor comes up with a pyramid-like scheme of
'pay-it-forward' where he'll perform an act of
kindness for three strangers, and they, in turn, must
do the same.  But in a cynical world where strangers
are more likely to be considered enemies rather than
friends, charity is looked upon with suspicion.  Even
worse, kindness may yield cruel consequences. 
Appropriately set in Las Vegas, where losers outnumber
winners 20-to-1.  "Pay It Forward" makes it clear that
the world is full of problems, from wife battering to
drug addiction to a wanton need for violence.  Yet,
amid this chaos, there are glimmers of hope that shine
through.  This beacon of optimism centers on Trevor
and his 'pay it forward' idea.  For example, he
invites a homeless man (James Caviezel) to come over
and sleep in the garage.  He also hopes to save his
friend from a brutal beating by a group of bullies. 
Each provides a valuable lesson, challenging us to
overcome our suspicion towards others and to risk
leaving our comfort zone.
Trevor also tries to make a love match for his mom
(Helen Hunt) and Mr. Simonet.  Most of the film
centers on this plot component.  His mom is an
irresponsible parent who frequently drinks herself to
sleep after pulling double-shifts as a waitress at a
strip club.  Meanwhile, Mr. Simonet suffers from a
scarred psyche that confines him to the prosaic life
he now leads.  The two are given a chance to explore
their pasts, their hopes, and to come to terms with
their personal struggles.  But their story seems
familiar and only partially engaging.  Of course, it's
a pleasure to watch Hunt and Spacey perform.  She
gives a gritty and strong performance as the alcoholic
mom.  Spacey is adept at portraying the vulnerable and
wounded man.  And Osment shows us that his
Oscar-nominated turn in the "Sixth Sense" was no
fluke.  
But their performances could not hide the film's
shortcomings.  It's stylistically bland and the
screenplay is weak.  The story lingers much too long
on the Mom/Mr. Simonet element, creating an odd sense
of imbalance.  With so much of the film focused on
this, its original premise becomes supplanted by a
love story.   It also teases the audience with an idea
that it wants to like, but then gets mired in a tone
that's continually dispirited and even weepy.  The
message contained within is that the world is a ball
of blighted hope.  For Trevor, a mere 12-year old, a
small beacon can get easily snuffed out when there is
so much to filter through.   Consequently, the film
tempers its feel-good tone with rejection, sorrow, and
defeat.  The ending is shamelessly treacly, and
whether you'll accept that payoff depends on your
tolerance for "Patch Adams."  Ultimately, this film
presents noble thoughts, but doesn't fulfill its
promise.

Title
Review for Matrix, The (1999)
In some of the trailers, we hear that `the matrix is something that has
to be seen to be understood.'  And, I think that I will have to preface
this review by making this same statement.  Indeed, `The Matrix'
introduces so many clever ideas, that this science fiction thriller
deserves to be seen and not just read in a review. 
You will not read any spoilers herein.  `The Matrix' of the movie is
some kind of entity that exists among us, but neither you nor I know
that it actually exists.  We just go about our daily business,
oblivious to it because `the wool has been pulled over our eyes.'  But
its purpose is heinous in nature and its destruction is something that
is seen as vital.  Only a few key people know the truth.  Those who do
face eradication by the Matrix and its loyal secret-service-like
enforcers, known as Agents'.  These few key people include the
patriarchal leader, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and warrior princess
Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).  Morpheus has been on a life-long quest to
find that one person who possesses the special ability to see through
the facade, understand the secret of the Matrix, and make things right.
 And he believes that he has finally found him in Neo (Keanu Reeves). 
The movie spends much of its time developing this premise.  Neo is
eventually convinced that what Morpheus has to say about the Matrix,
despite its hard-to-swallow absurdity and horrific ramifications, is
the truth, and he agrees to join.
Once this happens, the movie moves into high hear.  In order to prepare
Neo for what's out there, he is introduced to various training
programs.  Once such benefit is his teachings of the martial arts,
which creates opportunities for some very well-choreographed
hand-to-hand sequences.  Along with superb combat skills, he must also
develop his mind in an effort to be able to see the Matrix for what it
is.  Admittedly, I wasn't totally convinced at how he finally arrives
at that point, but getting there is terrific fun.  I hesitate to go
into more detail because the trailers don't give away any of the
secrets or the really good stuff of the film.  But I can say that the
best of science fiction isn't the power of the laser guns, the array of
wild humanoid creatures, or epic battles among spacecraft.  Rather,
they are the stories that give us a peek into our own humanity.  In
this case, as we are fast approaching a time when the line between
reality and simulation becomes increasingly blurred, the movie explores
the implications attached to making choices between what is real and
our fantasies.  But there is a fundamental question that the film never
answers.  What will happen next when everyone finally learns the truth?
 It's hard to imagine the answer despite the amount of imagination that
is present in this film.
Nonetheless, it's evident that a lot of thought went into the
progression of the movie and it's various sequences.  I really liked
the look and feel of this film.  It's atmosphere and enigmatic
characters (such as the Oracle and the chief Agent) suggested a world
with dark secrets.  The film is a dazzling feast of visuals and the
action sequences are terrific, especially one featuring a helicopter
rescue.  Even at 135 minutes in length, the energy of the film never
diminishes.  `The Matrix' doesn't give you all the answers, but it's a
pure adrenaline rush learning what you can.


Title
Review for Sexy Beast (2000)
If you thought that British films lacked a certain
edginess, then this should come as a shocking and a
pleasant surprise.  After all, with recent slushy fare
like "Billy Elliott" and "Bridget Jones's Diary," you
might think that British films have the feel of a
Three Musketeers candy bar.  Remember their slogan? 
Fluffy, not stuffy.  
Well, you won't find any fluff in "Sexy Beast."  The
stuff inside is a gritty, foul-mouthed film noir about
Gary (Ray Winstone), a retired gangster, who is
mercilessly coerced into performing one last heist. 
This is a tough-guy film for people who like tough-guy
films.
Gary has built a comfortable life for himself and his
wife with the fortune that he has amassed from his
previous jobs.  Residing in his idyllic Spanish
hillside villa, his toughest task seems to be trying
to avoid sunburn while lounging by his pool.  But an
afternoon dip, dinner with his wife, and drinks with
his friends are all that he wants.
His general state of bliss, however, is about to be
shattered when a former colleague visits him.  It's
none other than Don Largo (Ben Kingsley), a ruthless
criminal that needs Gary for an ambitious bank heist
back in London.
Wait a minute.  Can the words "ruthless" and "Ben
Kingsley" actually be used in the same sentence? 
Didn't he win an Oscar for his role as the irenic
Gandhi?  He has built his career on roles that
required quiet intensity.  Here, he is as tough and
threatening as they come.  Don't let that wiry frame
of his fool you.  There is more meanness packed within
that body than there is in a dozen junkyard dogs. 
It's quite a startling transformation.
It is this element of "Sexy Beast" that will grab your
attention.  Don looks like he could easily be snapped
in two.  Meanwhile, Gary has the build of a bear.  But
our likeable lummox is easily overmatched by Don's
brusque methods.  He continually backs down in fear as
Don first asks, then demands, and then threatens for
his involvement.  Much of this film centers on this
volatile fox-and-hound relationship.  Gary meekly
tries to sidestep the pressure, but Don's verbal
assault, which brims with curt yet poetic gangster
invective, is fearfully intimidating.  As the vicious
hoodlum continues to press and as the reluctant
retiree continues to retreat, we hope that Gary
somehow manages to survive this predicament.
While "Sexy Beast" showcased a great, dark turn by
Kingsley, there were a couple of things that were very
distracting.  The language was absolutely appalling. 
Its vituperative nature frequently made me
uncomfortable rather than awestruck with Don's
menacing nature.  There were some absurd moments of
comedy to break this cycle, such as banter that
revolved around falling boulders, goats, and
hairdressers.  But you can't get over the mountain of
foul language.
Even more difficult to filter through might be the
heavy Cockney brogue spoken by the actors.   It takes
a bit of concentration to understand what everyone is
talking about.  So, it becomes a tough exercise when
you have to absorb the foul language in addition to
the somewhat indecipherable accents.  Like Gary who
needed to work really hard to make Don understand his
situation, we may need to work equally hard to
understand the film's finer points as well.

Review for 13th Warrior, The (1999)
Vikings v. Bears?  No, this isn't the lineup for Monday Night Football.
 Rather, these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the
death in "The 13th Warrior," a film that is as dramatically flat as it
is gratuitously gory.  Based on Michael Crichton's book, Eaters of the
Dead, this Viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled Norsemen
and the glorious battles that they fought.  Their strength and honor
would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest
warriors that ever picked up a sword.  Luckily for the Vikings,
however, their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film.
Antonio Bandaras is Ahmed, a travelling ambassador.  Accompanied by his
friend (Omar Shariff in a cameo), they eventually come across a small
Viking village.  We see that the Vikings are an extremely proud group
whose greatest strength is their fortitude.  They laugh heartily, revel
in their arrogance, and sing songs of battles won.   But their
festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell
the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land.  Help
is needed quickly.  An elderly, fortune-telling witch arrives.  After a
brief incantation, she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more "not of
Norse blood" are needed to ensure victory.  Personally, I always wonder
why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the
brink of insanity.  Nonetheless, 12 men eagerly accept their place
while Ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th. The group then sets out to do the
greatest battle of their lives.
Of course during their ride, Ahmed becomes the target of fun for the
other 12 burly Viking warriors.  But he ably shows that it's not the
size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the
dog.  He is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the Vikings, but
will his skills (and that of the group) be enough to defeat whatever
evil is menacing the countryside?  It does not look promising.  These
creatures, resembling bears, are strong and have high morale.  They are
fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their
enemies.  They attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come
soon.  The warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their Gods. 
They are ready to sacrifice their lives.  "This is a good way to die,"
says one of the fallen warriors.
Despite the larger-than-life battle sequences, I was unmoved by the
entire experience.  At many points, I was even confused.  For example,
somewhere in the middle of the film, a sub-plot creeps up involving the
Prince of the threatened land.  He seems to have an agenda to elevate
himself to greater power during this crisis.  However, the sub-plot
never fully materializes, and we are left scratching our heads as to
the purpose of its inclusion.  There are other questions that I had,
but the real problem was that the story (little of it that there was)
offered no characters to love or hate.  The leader of the Viking
warriors had the most charisma.  However, Banderas's role is completely
underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so
special.  An entire rewrite of the Ahmed character is in order.   
Also, much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at
night, which made battles very difficult to follow.  I would have
preferred more time looking at the Viking culture and how their beliefs
shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy.  As it stands,
the film manages more confusion than intensity.  It would make Thor
cry.

Title
Review for Knock Off (1998)
"Consistency" - I think that this is a word that doesn't exist in the
vocabulary of Director Tsui Hark.  His Honk Kong action offering,
starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, is a muddled mess that pushes you from
one action sequence to another without really taking the time to
properly set it up.  But at least when you buy the ticket, you pretty
much have a good idea of what's in store for you.  After all, it's a
film that takes place in Hong Kong, has a Hong Kong director at the
helm, and stars Van Damme.  Yes, you'll see plenty of fight scenes and
gunshots galore, but don't expect anything more than that.
The storyline involves a smuggling ring that is trying to smuggle small,
sophisticated bombs into the U.S.  With the explosive power of a half a
stick of dynamite, these little technological marvels are so small that
they could be hidden inside a watch, a small radio, or even inside a
button.   If these bombs make their way into the U.S., the ringleaders
could blackmail the government into an exorbitant monthly payment.  The
CIA follows several leads that point them to Marcus Ray (Van Damme).
>From there, it's a convoluted series of sequences that tells very little
story but allows lots of time for Van Damme to run, kick, punch and to
try to figure out why everyone is after him.  
But Marcus Ray isn't the only one that's trying to make sense out of
what's going on.  The audience can easily get lost as well.  We run into
a plethora of other characters such as Tommy (Rob Schneider), who may be
more than just Ray's partner.  There's also Karan (Lela Rochon), a
supposed executive that wants to talk to Marcus about his business.
Also on the case is a handful of other cops, including Paul Sorvino (a
very respectable actor), who must have lost a bet to want to take a role
in this film.  
Some of the action sequences were kind of nifty, like the cat and mouse
chase aboard a freighter while gigantic cargo crates shifted back and
forth threatening to crush people.  Yes, some neat ideas, but all are
squandered.  The "Speed Racer"-like dialogue (sentences that
incomprehensibly spew out), and the epileptic manner of editing, which
is done at breakneck speed, easily earns this film the title of "most
highly disorganized effort of the summer."

Title
Review for Meet the Parents (2000)
For any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to
his girlfriend, there are certain rules that he needs
to follow.  Firstly, fill her life with happiness and
romance during the courtship.  Secondly, buy her a
beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes. 
Thirdly, find the perfect moment and location to
propose.  Finally, the groom-wannabe should probably
get her parent's blessing.  Of these four, the last
one can be a nightmare.  Meeting parents is a rite of
passage, fraught with unexpected questions, bouts of
nervousness, the reality of being disliked, and the
inability to make a positive impression.  If you're
lucky, things will go smoothly.  But, if you're Greg
Focker (Ben Stiller), everything will go wrong.  And
with a name like that, how could it not?
When Greg first meets his fiancée's father, Jack
Byrnes (the grimacing Robert DeNiro), Greg immediately
feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive.  When
he tells Jack that he's a male nurse, the incorrigible
Dad shoots back, "Not many men in your profession,
huh, Greg?"  It's definitely not a good start.  But
Greg is determined to win him over, and it's this
desire that fuels the movie.  He first takes small
steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner.  It
doesn't matter that he's Jewish.  If Daddy Byrnes asks
him to say grace, then that's what he's going to
gamely do.   "Oh God...you're such a good God", he
moons.  His discomfort at trying to force out a simple
prayer will make you chuckle, but when Jack gives him
the "DeNiro Squint" (that familiar, unsettling gaze
that gives DeNiro that aura of invincibility), it's
pretty hard not to grin.
Things get progressively worse for Greg.  And that's
too bad because he's a genuinely likable guy with a
romantic heart.  Eventually, he begins to try so hard
that he starts to mess everything up, committing a
host of gaffes that embarrass, humiliate or injure
other people.  It's a never-ending ordeal of missteps,
miscues, and mistakes.  He buys some champagne, but
uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous
circumstances.  He tries to find Jack's missing cat. 
But his method of solving the problem leads only to
more trouble.  And there are several other episodes,
each one trumping the next in outrageousness.  The
more our well-meaning beau screwed up, the more the
audience groaned in sympathy.  We liked Greg.  And, we
liked this movie.
"Meet the Parents" is a farcical comedy that certainly
has its moments.  Just sit back and watch Greg get
into trouble.  No matter what the situation, whether
its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or
sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house, things will
horribly go wrong.  We laugh at Greg's expense, but
love often makes a person do dumb things, and Ben
Stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool. 
DeNiro is also affable, tough on the outside yet
sentimental on the inside.  Their tug-of-war is often
funny, the slapstick is elaborate, and there are
several topical throwaway gags (mostly targeted at the
airline industry) to make this film an amusing yet
smart lampoon about future in-laws from Hell.

Title
Review for Unbreakable (2000)
Imagine that Santa has left for your child a
beautifully wrapped toy on Christmas Day.  While Santa
knows that it's one of those high-tech mechanical
dogs, several layers of wrapping paper are used to
help hide its secret.  As the little one tears away at
the paper, what was first a formless mass is now
starting to take shape.  The child's eyes glow with
anticipation as the truth nears.  Finally, the payoff
arrives, and the little tyke lets forth a wide smile
knowing that it was all worth the effort.
This is the sensation that you might feel as you watch
"Unbreakable," an engrossing tale about an ordinary
man who experiences extraordinary events.  But why
does this happen?  The answer, wrapped in mystery, is
something that needs to be unraveled, uncovered and
understood.
"Why are you looking at me like that," asks the
bewildered David Dunn (Bruce Willis).  He's visibly
confused as he peers around the hospital's emergency
room where he has been recently taken after another
one of those extraordinary events.  The doctor answers
slowly, with a soft-spoken voice that connotes mixed
feelings of curiosity and wonderment.  "Your train
derailed," he begins to tell him.  "And to answer your
question, there are two reasons why I'm looking at you
this way."  It seems that Dunn is the only survivor of
a horrific (off-screen) train crash in which 131 other
lives were lost.  Moreover, there wasn't a scratch on
his entire body.  Although most of the train cars were
badly mangled, Dunn escaped unscathed.
This event raises many questions.  Is he just lucky? 
Perhaps he's blessed.  Maybe it's something more.  But
whatever the mystical reason may be for his good
fortune, it's an answer that begs to be revealed.  As
our hero begins his search for meaning, the audience
eagerly and anxiously follows him every step of the
way.  The only thing that he does know, however, is
that a stranger named Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson)
seems to know a lot about him.  Elijah asks Dunn if
he's ever been hurt, the last time he got sick, and
his reason for choosing his career.  Most of all, he
asks Dunn to reassess his life in order to understand
the truth.
>From the Oscar-nominated talent that gave us "The
Sixth Sense," writer/director M. Night Shyamalan,
"Unbreakable" is a hauntingly good yarn.  What makes
this film atypical of most other films is its inspired
belief in itself and its adroitness in taking us into
an alternative universe.  It's almost like watching
reality shift in front of our eyes as Dunn and the
audience are challenged to negotiate through this
labyrinth layered with hints and revelations.  This
transformation happens slowly, however, so don't
expect a quick-paced film.  Meanwhile, dialogue is
spoken in a hushed tone that causes the audience to
strain to hear what they are saying.  I was fascinated
and found it gripping, but this might be maddening for
others.  Ultimately, like the doctor that examines
Dunn in the emergency room after that train wreck,
you'll likely feel that same sense of curiosity and
wonderment.


Title
Review for Bait (2000)
There's a lot that "Bait" wishes that it could have
accomplished.  It put forth some ideas that could have
been entertaining.  However, amateurish storytelling
and the film's pedestrian pace will ensure a speedy
trip into your local video store.  Look for it to be
prominently placed next to another similarly trite
film, "Chill Factor" (and there are an incredible
number of similarities between these two films that I
would list, but I doubt that you would have seen
either of these two).  This movie features a couple of
interesting elements, but as a whole, it can't put it
all together to make this offering anything more than
a marginally serviceable action film.
"Bait" begins with the improbable heist of $40+
million in gold bricks from the Manhattan Gold
Reserve.  Two men carry out this theft.  One is a
brilliant but psychotic madman, Bristol (Doug
Hutchison), who has the ability to break into and
bypass the most advanced security systems as if he was
hot-wiring a car.  This allows him to plan such a
daring robbery with clockwork precision.  However, he
has no compunction about harming others, whether it's
shooting an innocent bystander or setting off a bomb
that may kill hundreds.  And, he talks in this
whispery monotone, making him sound like he graduated
with top honors from the John Malkovich School of
Method Acting.  
Meanwhile, his partner, John Jaster (Robert
Pastorelli), is just some poor construction
worker-schlepp that he needed because he couldn't move
all that gold by himself.  However, when Jaster
finally learns how mentally unstable Bristol is, he
takes off with the gold and buries it in a secret
location.  This is not a very bright guy.  In fact,
sometime later that night (after he hid the gold), he
is stopped for a traffic violation and sent to prison.
His temporary cellmate is Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx),
a small-time crook who just can't make the right
decisions in life.  He has a good heart but not many
opportunities to show it.  Jaster's heart, however, is
about to fail.  And before it does, he gives Alvin an
enigmatic message.  Treasury agents, led by angry
investigator Clenteen (David Morse), are too late in
learning anything from Jaster.  But they suspect that
Alvin might know something.  Their plan is to implant
a tracking/listening device inside his jaw
(unbeknownst to Alvin), spring him loose, and wait
until Bristol makes an appearance.  And boy, do we
wait quite a long time.
"Bait" is a hackneyed production at best, but it's not
the fault of Jamie Foxx, who is amiable and possesses
a charismatic insouciance.  The real problem is that
the film just can't generate any momentum.  For most
of the film, we're just waiting for the bad guy to
show up.  Until that point, we get a handful of
tangential subplots, glitzy visuals, and some neat
editing touches, but nothing of any substance.  By the
time the 'suspense' happens, it pounces on you so
quickly that it's impossible to really comprehend the
moment.  Imagine virtually nothing happening for the
first 90 minutes, and then for the remaining 15
minutes, our hero must defeat the bad buy, save his
loved ones, AND find a way to dispose of a truck-sized
bomb.  Given this kind of dramatic arc, "Bait"
probably won't catch on with many moviegoers.

Review for Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)
This is a note to the marketing execs of this film. 
Stop promoting it by taking out television and
newspaper ads.  Instead, concentrate your advertising
dollars in such magazines as Car & Driver, Motor
Trend, or Hot Rod.  "Gone in 60 Seconds" is the kind
of film to which car enthusiasts will flock. 
Featuring a bevy of exotic cars and high performance
vehicles, it gives you a chance to see seldom seen
top-of-the line cars that you could only dream of
owning.  However, to the rest of us non-enthusiasts,
which is about 98% of us, this is a film that is need
of a tune-up.  Its cars move faster than the story and
their sleek looks are more memorable than any of the
characters.
The film would have you believe that it stars Nicolas
Cage, Angelina Jolie, and Giovanni Ribisi.  But its
real stars are the Porsches, Ferraris and
Lamborghinis.  And there are plenty of them.  An auto
theft ring led by Kip Raines (Ribisi) is targeting
these beauties and a few other specialty cars.  Kip
has been hired by a local crime boss who is not the
kind of man that believes in mercy or forgiveness. 
Kip feels up to the task and accepts the difficult
job.  However, he's young, brash, and lacks the
experience to pull off such a hefty assignment. 
Eventually, one of his 'boosts' goes awry.  The police
discover and confiscate Kip's stolen cars.  Although
he eludes the police, he still must answer to the
crime boss, who promises Kip an agonizing death unless
he can deliver.
Nicolas Cage plays Kip's older brother, Memphis, who
was a legendary car thief in his own time.  Now, he
makes an honest living, but is forced back into a life
of crime in order to save his brother.  Memphis must
steal 50 cars in 4 days; otherwise his brother will be
killed.  He quickly begins to assemble his team.  They
include, among others, trusted friend (Robert Duvall),
and former love interest Sway (Angelina Jolie).  They
do some homework to locate the needed cars and they
ready themselves for a one-night blitz where they hope
to pull off a daring string of auto thefts.
For Memphis and his crew, stealing cars is like taking
candy from a baby.  They easily open locks, hot wire
ignitions, disarm alarms, bypass circuitry and remove
other theft-deterrent devices with surprising ease. 
However, Memphis still must contend with some serious
issues if he is to succeed.  A dogged detective
(Delroy Lindo) knows that he's up to no good and has
deployed surveillance teams out to watch over several
of the vehicles targeted for theft.  Competing car
thieves who do not welcome Memphis's reappearance want
him to leave town.  And, to be able to make the
deadline, all of the thefts would have to go smoothly,
which is virtually impossible.
The only fun part of the film occurs in the last 25
minutes as Memphis races against time and a squadron
of police cars to deliver the last car.  This is
actually an impressively designed chase sequence,
taking us through congested city streets and a
construction zone where our hero has to dodge various
debris and even a wrecking ball.  But "Gone in 60
Seconds" is remarkably slow for a film that seems like
it will showcase lots of chase sequences and the
charisma reminiscent of "Smokey and the Bandit." 
Sadly, with its goofy and underwhelming
characterizations, this film starts to feel more like
"The Dukes of Hazzard."  

Title
Review for Spy Kids (2001)
To tell you the truth, "Spy Kids" was not what I had
originally intended to review.  I actually bought a
ticket to see a more sophisticated spy thriller called
"The Tailor of Panama."  There were still about 15
minutes before that film was to begin, so I decided to
sneak into an adjacent theatre to kill some time.  I
didn't expect to stay too long because the idea of
watching a pre-teen brother and sister team lurch
their way through a mission to save the world seemed
like an agonizing idea.  Surprisingly, the first 15
minutes established a fair amount of pace and showed
the promise of entertainment and imagination.  And
before I knew it, I had actually stayed and watched
the whole movie.  Thinking back, I'm glad that I did.
It certainly wasn't the acting that fueled this story.
 Since the target audience consists primarily of
pre-teens, this film feels more like a revved up
bedtime story with cartoonish characters rather than a
polished thriller.  After all, the heroes are a
12-year-old girl named Carmen (Alexa Vega) and her
younger brother Juni (Daryl Sabara).  Both possess a
spunky likableness without the saccharine demeanor of
that kid from the "Home Alone" films.
Meanwhile, the villain, Fegan Floop (Alan Cummings),
is a popular children's television show host.  He
resides in a magnificent palace whose interior seems
to be lifted from the blueprints of Willie Wonka's
Chocolate Factory.  There, he carries out his
diabolical plan and controls his army of clumsy
minions who are literally all thumbs.  But no matter
what you think of pre-teen spies and fanciful
villains, you'll find this overall movie watching
experience enjoyable.
Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino)
Cortez are former super-secret agents.  Now wed, they
have retired to raise their children, Carmen and Juni.
 They have never told their children about their past,
hoping to put that life behind them.  But they are
called back into action when fellow operatives start
disappearing and Fegan Floop and his minions
areuhfingered.  But years of inactivity result in
their quick capture.  With their parents now
prisoners, it's up to Carmen and Juni to save them and
the world. 
For much of the movie, its pretty straightforward as
the kids use is a bevy of wildly inventive gizmos to
make their way towards Floop's stronghold while
dodging his various henchman.  Yet the film is
unexpectedly flashy in its use of quick edits, giving
this James Bond-for-kids film grown-up hipness.  There
are many amusing moments as well, such as the
inevitable bickering between the siblings and the
general state of ineptness of Floop's minions.  It
also exhibited a continued spirit of imagination,
featuring special effects that made this film seem
more expensive than its reported price tag of $35
million.
"Spy Kids" is a fine family film.  It not only
provides 90 minutes of entertainment, but it also
effectively forwards the notion of family, teamwork,
brotherhood, and the importance of children.  Like
Gregorio and Ingrid who worked hard to successfully
balance their family life with their lives as agents,
the film also works hard to find the right balance
between an easy-to-digest film for kids and an
entertaining film for adults.  This mission is
adequately accomplished.  "Spy Kids" nicely combines
fantasy and fluff with several laughs and several
valuable lessons.

Review for Borrowers, The (1997)
Did you ever misplace a comb, only never to find it again?  Did you ever
wonder why you keep losing your keys?  Why is there always one sock
missing when you take your laundry out of the dryer?  Maybe it's because
you're not the only tenants living in your house.  If you look under the
floorboards or behind the cracks of the walls, you may indeed learn that
you have housemates called "The Borrowers".
Borrowers are little people standing no more than several inches high.
Because they scurry around like mice, are extremely intelligent, and
have never been seen, they are something of a myth.  When the 'Beings'
of the house are away, they come out to pilfer batteries, food, and
other supplies.  Credit cards are used as doors, dental floss is used
for rope and thimbles are used as pots. 
The central story focuses on the family of the house, named the Lenders.
Supposedly, the house belongs to them, which was stipulated in a will,
but the scheming lawyer, played by John Goodman complete with oily hair
and villainy mustache, claims that a will was never made, and by
default, the house belongs to him.  He plans to level the house and then
to turn it into a deluxe condominium complex.  Of course, this would not
only force the Lenders to move out but would also force the Borrowers to
leave as well.  Ah...but there's no surprise that there is indeed a will
and when the Borrower children take back the will, the ogrish Goodman
comes after them with an exterminator.
But there is more to this movie than just an entertaining story and
watching the little people achieve escapes that would impress any
magician.  The humor is physical and very funny at times thanks to
Goodman's abilities.  He gets a face full of insecticide, electrocuted
and tremendously tormented.  Meanwhile, the visual aspect of the film is
a joy.  With a fairy-tale look right out of Mary Poppins or Wallace and
Gromit videos, the movie achieves a whimsical adventure that allows you
to sit back and enjoy the ride.  A climatic scene takes place in a milk
bottling plant.  Watch as the littlest one gets trapped inside a bottle
filled with milk as everyone tries to save him as the evil lawyer closes
in on them.
This 83 minute offering makes a terrific matinee and a great antidote if
you're suffering the blues.  Of course, be mindful that this is a film
based on a children's story, so if you don't go at night, prepare for an
audience full of kids.  Clever, cute, inventive, and fantastical, this
movie will bring out the inner child in all of us.

Review for Inspector Gadget (1999)
Perhaps you might be familiar with a campy 60s TV show called Get
Smart, which featured a bumbling agent that always thwarted the forces
of evil even though he couldn't find a clue if it came up and hit him
in the face.  You might also be familiar with an equally campy 70s TV
show called the Six Million Dollar Man, which featured a man barely
alive who was rebuilt to be fasterstrongerbetter.   And of course
we're all familiar with the people at Disney, who possess a talent to
bring us good family fare full of wacky creativity.  Blend these three
elements together and you get 80 minutes of grins in Disney's
`Inspector Gadget.'
Inspector Gadget is actually John Brown (Matthew Broderick), a
mild-mannered security guard that almost loses his life during a
robbery.  In the accident, his body has suffered irreparable damage. 
But thanks to some groundbreaking work by scientist Brenda (Joely
Fisher), John can benefit from a new procedure that blends flesh with
technology.  On the operating table as they try to save his life, they
wheel in the entire inventory of the local Home Depot, from springs to
pipes to hoses.  When John wakes up, he learns that he is now the new
generation of law enforcement.  All he has to say is go go gadget'
something, and voila  it pops out.  This man is the ultimate Swiss
pocketknife.  His thumb is a lighter, his ear is a sound amplifier, and
his legs turn into huge metal stilts that allow him to leapfrog through
traffic at an amazing speed.  When he wants to scale a building, go go
gadget grappling hook.'  And when he needs to get somewhere across
town, 'go go gadget copter.'  I found these scenes inventive and cute,
although kids would probably appreciate the gee-whiz gadgetry more than
I did.
The acerbic police chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman) is not thrilled with
having an experimental cybercop, quipping that Inspector Gadget is
Columbo and Nintendo all rolled into one.  But this new inspector
catches the eye of the magnate, Mr. Scolex/Dr. Claw (Rupert Everett). 
He wants to steal the technology to build his own legion of warriors. 
Scolex is the kind of cartoonish bad guy that says mean things
accompanied by mean-sounding music in the background.  After all, this
is Disney.  
This live-action film was inspired from the cartoon of the same name
from the 80's.  I was mildly interested in the cartoon and probably
came away with a similarly lukewarm feeling after I saw the movie. 
There isn't much bite to this movie, although the movie has its tender
moments.  Nonetheless, I did enjoy Broderick's appropriately frumpy
performance and I thought that the movie paced itself very well to keep
me from slipping into a mode of boredom.  I also liked the
Gadgetmobile, which is a convertible that puts the Knight Rider
(another 80s show) car to shame.  Among the many cool things that this
car can do, perhaps the coolest is the built-in soda and candy
dispenser for the weary passenger in need of a snack.  But the funniest
scene happens during the end credits.  One of Scolex's evil henchman
wants to mend his ways and attends a meeting of the Minion Support
Group.  In this group, you'll find Oddjob and Jaws from a few James
Bond flicks and a few other memorable, evil sidekicks.

Review for Replacement Killers, The (1998)
When I was in 2nd grade, I always looked forward to Fridays.  That was
the day that started off with Show and Tell.  I and my fellow
classmates would bring in our new pet frog, or new yo-yo, or a
fast-looking Hot Wheels car or some other shiny, new toy to impress
the others.  We said little to describe what we had because the items
were the show and nobody really listened to what we had to say anyway.
But we knew by the response of the classroom that we had to bring
something even better the next time.  It is now Hong Kong's turn to
play, and they have brought to America's film classroom something
shiny and slick called "The Replacement Killers" which is decidedly
more 'show' than 'tell'. 
The central part of this 'show' is a cool and suave Asian-action star
by the name of Chow Yun-Fat.  Having filmed dozens of movies in Hong
Kong, America now gets its first peek at Asia's Clint Eastwood.  As
John Lee, he is a reluctant assassin who handles guns in the same way
Monet handles a paint brush.  He is a deadly marksman, but he is also
an indentured servant of ruthless crime lord, Terence Wei.  If he
fails to perform, Wei will not hesitate to kill Lee's family.  But in
his latest assignment, his conscience prevents him from squeezing the
trigger.  He knows that there will be consequences, and he must use
his killer instincts to not only survive but to find a way to flee to
China to rescue his family.
Needing a fake passport, he meets up with Meg (Mira Sorvino), a
professional forger, but before she even has time to develop his
photo, Wei's henchmen arrive to kill him.  After a furious gun battle,
Lee manages to escape, and as the film progresses, the brooding hitman
finally begins to internalize the ruthlessness and evilness of Wei.
He slowly begins to realize that he needs to do more than just save
his family.  He must also save Meg as well as the person that he was
ordered to assassinate.
For a film where the guns do most of the talking, it isn't just a
one-dimensional shoot-em up.  The tone of the film is quickly
established early on, and its level of combustibility never
diminishes.  Elements of Hong Kong movie making add a certain aura of
style to the look of the film.  Shot in dark alleyways and small
buildings throughout LA's Chinatown, we feel the stress of his
claustrophobic situation.  Many dramatic scenes are shown in poetic
slow motion.  Gunplay dominates the movie, but the shootouts are
well-choreographed and gives Chow Yun-Fat ample opportunity to show
off his skills as he spins, leaps and pirouettes while gunning down
his enemies.  He is cool under fire; never cracks a joke; and
dispatches his enemies in an icy-cold, professional, no-nonsense
manner.  This characterization is the essence of Chow, and this is his
show.
As a result, the movie has a difficult time developing the chemistry
between Lee and Meg.  Also adept at handling a gun, it seemed
painfully obvious that the writers didn't want her to compete with
Chow's presence.  Although she's a prominant character, Meg doesn't
really leave any kind of mark, and presumably, Sorvino's inclusion may
have been just a casting decision to put someone familiar to American
audiences to improve its marketability.  Also, Lee's character is a
quiet man, so there isn't too much by way of dialogue. 
There is no doubt that Chow is likable and that this is a competent
action film for those who like their stories peppered with an
industrial soundtrack, sunglass-wearing thugs; and scenes where the
heroes are running for their lives amid a hail of bullets.  At 90
minutes, the movie takes you where you want to go without any annoying
detours.  It probably could have done a lot more, but manages to be a
nice show piece.  I know that the Hong Kong movie makers will bring
something even better next time.

Review for Soldier (1998)
Sometime in the not-so-distant future, a new generation of soldiers
will be created.  Babies are conscripted right after birth and begin a
harsh training regimen that spans the entirety of their young lives. 
They are groomed to become ruthless, strong, and tireless fighting
machines.  Todd (Kurt Russell) is just one of many of these new breed
of soldiers.  During a training exercise, soldiers take shooting
practice where cardboard cut-outs of both innocent bystanders and
enemy troops move left and right.  In one particular instance, an
enemy soldier shields himself behind an innocent person.  While the
other soldiers-in-training freeze for a moment to contemplate their
shot, Todd, giving only a moment's hesitation, coldly pulls his
trigger.  The cut-out of both the enemy soldier and the innocent
person are obliterated.  As everyone else looks at him, he shows no
signs of remorse or regret.  This soldier will graduate at the top of
his class. 
There have been many movies that focus on the comeuppance of a soldier
and the bitter sacrifices that he makes in fighting for his country,
or in this case, his planet.  Here, it's not all that different,
although it takes place in the future where the weapons do
significantly more damage and the landscape seems eternally ravaged by
war.  Todd evolves into a lethal fighting machine whose emotion and
humanity have been stripped away.  When he is replaced by an even more
potent type of soldier and is subsequently discarded on a planet far
away, the story shifts gears and parallels the plight of the war
veteran with no place to go.  The fight continues inside of him, and
here is a person who can not be easily reintroduced into society. 
Falling upon a settlement on this planet, he is first taken in.  They
try to teach basic skills such as gardening.  Their attempt to
assimilate Todd back into normal society injects a little bit of
humanity, but Todd's aggressive behavior and alarming tenacity begin
to frighten the settlements' denizens.  It seems that the only way for
Todd to be appreciated is for some battle to take place.  And, (no
surprise here) an opportunity to show his fighting skills soon
presents itself, ironically with a landing party that consists of the
upgraded soldiers that replaced him back on Earth.  
"Soldier" doesn't break any new ground and could have been easily
named Rambo IX if it starred Sylvester Stallone.  Yet, for the most
part, the film was tolerable.  I liked the offbeat choice of casting
Kurt Russell as the aging war veteran.  And the film wisely decides to
keep dialogue at a minimum, allowing it to be a mindless thrill ride. 
The film's best part showcases a final 25-minute battle pitting the
veteran Todd against a platoon of next-generation soldiers.  Given its
limitations, "Soldier" is all that it can be.


Title
Review for Lethal Weapon 4 (1998)
Just how inseparable is the team of Sgt. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and
Sgt. Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover)?  Let's just say that when one
partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then
further asks him to run out into the middle of the road, flapping his
arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a
distraction, his partner actually does it!
The familiar Lethal Weapon family is back, including Rene Russo, who is
now the expectant mother of Riggs' child and Joe Pesci as the
soprana-like, foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a
private eye.  New to the team is Chris Rock, also a fast-talking, up and
coming detective.  Trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives
where ever they go, and in this film, that is no exception.  Even when
they are just taking a leisurely boat ride, they somehow manage to
collide with a freighter ship.  We here some ominous music, which clues
us that a confrontation is about to happen.  Gunfire ensues, and when
it's all over, the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by
questioning a Chinatown crime lord.  
Although they don't know what they're looking for, their inquisitiveness
causes the bad guys to take some action.  And there's plenty of action
here for two movies.  Led by fighting sensation Jet Li, whose martial
arts skill is nothing less than impressive, he does what he can to make
sure that no one finds out what they are up to.  Li is ruthless in his
approach, will kill anyone just to make a point, and develops enormous
disdain for the two detectives.
There are terrific car chases, explosions and gunshot galore.  It's a
summer action recipe followed to the letter, and the result is nothing
less than pure, unadulterated summer fun.  But even too many explosions
can get boring.  To counter that, we are treated to several amazingly
choreographed fight sequences with Jet Li.  Luckily, he'd rather fight
hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns.  Meanwhile, when the detectives
aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs, they're engaged
in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice
diversion from the hail of bullets.  Everybody gets in on the shtick.
Russo screams during her delivery, the crime lord has a few funny bits
when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas, and Pesci
and Rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of
having cellular phones.  Gibson and Glover are always in sync and the
film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano.
Score one for the Old Guard.

Title
Review for Mystery Men (1999)
In the neon-heavy metropolis of Champion City, crime has been all but
quashed by the strong arm of justice possessed by the local superhero,
Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear). Due to his ability to fight crime,
there hasn't been much need for him anymore.  His latest act of heroism
involves rounding up a group of goggle-wearing punks that disrupt a
party at a nursing home.  This is hardly the stuff of superhero legend
and the Captain knows it.  His solution is to recommend the release of
one of his archenemies, Dr. Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush), from
his prison sentence.  Perhaps a renewed battle of good versus evil will
elevate his status among the people.  This would not only keep his ego
healthy, but would keep his publicist happy as well.  Yes, a publicist.
 After all, you won't be popular just because you're super-strong and
can fly like a bird.
`Mystery Men' takes a comedic look at the life of a superhero.  These
guys aren't millionaire playboys.  Rather, as in Captain Amazing's
case, they need advertising sponsors to defray the cost of
crimefighting.  It's probably pretty expensive dry cleaning those
outfits.  Captain Amazing wears a suit covered with so many sponsor
patches that you're not sure whether he's a crimefighter or a stock car
racer.  Alas, Amazing's plan backfires and now the evil Dr.
Frankenstein holds him captive.  Luckily, within Champion City are a
slew of Amazing wannabes that also wants to fight crime.  They include
Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) whose power seems to be making empty threats
while seething with anger; Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) who can throw forks
with amazing accuracy and strength; and The Shoveler (William H. Macy)
who whacks people with a huge spade.  Why don't these guys deserve more
credit for their crimefighting efforts?  Probably it's because they are
terrible at it.  They wind up hurting each other more than the bad
guys. But soon, these three half-baked heroes will discover that the
fate of Champion City will be in their hands.
But they need help, and eventually enlist Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell)
who can only turn invisible when you don't look at him, The Bowler
(Janeane Garofalo) who has a bowling ball with a mind  skull actually
 of its own, and The Spleen (Paul Reubens) whose weapon is noxious
gusts of flatulence.  It's a pretty strange assortment of heroes who
will be saving us all, but at least they didn't recruit other
questionable heroes like Waffleman (who hits people with a griddle
pan), the Pencilhead (who erases crime), or PMS Avenger (who only works
4 days a week).  To channel their energy and to develop their skills in
preparation for the big battle with Frankenstein, they accept tutelage
from The Sphinx (Wes Studi) who is a fountain of stupid aphorisms.  He
says things like `learn to control your rage our your rage will control
you' and `be a part of the wolf pack and not part of a six pack.'  
At its heart, Mystery Men has some clever ideas about what the average
blue-collar' crimefighter is like.  My favorite scene was when these
three contemplate the true identity of Captain Amazing.  Though Amazing
and his alter ego look obviously identical, when one wears glasses, the
resemblance disappears!  Much of the script is written to take
advantage of the comedic gifts of Stiller's dysfunctionality and
Garofalo's charm.  But ideas and words are not enough.  It becomes very
apparent that this film has neither direction nor structure to speak
of.  The abundance of characters makes this film chaotic at times. 
Couple this with a lot of swirling special effects, the result is a
film that's too cluttered to enjoy.  It almost made me want to leap off
a tall building in a single bound.  How the likes of Mr. Furious and
his crimefighting sophomores manage to actually save the world is a
complete mystery to me.

Title
Review for Wedding Singer, The (1998)
Meet Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler), a cloyingly good-natured man.  He is
the typical small-town boy with small dreams.  He wants to settle down
in his hometown and marry his high school sweetheart.  Once a lead
singer for his garage rock band, he now works as a wedding singer.  He
possesses charm and knows how to put a positive spin on any festive
occasion...that is until he is left standing alone at the altar.
He is now miserable and vents his frustration at wedding guests by
lamenting about life and singing songs like "Love Stinks".  But he
does find comfort with Julia (Drew Barrymore), a waitress that works
at the reception hall where he sings.  Julia's life, however, is
equally miserable.  Engaged to a wealthy but low-life jerk that seems
more interested in himself, she questions whether he's the 'one'.
Eventually, their misery brings them together and then...well, you
know.
But their path to happiness (and ours) is not without a few obstacles.
Robbie's financee wants another chance.  Julia's mother doesn't want
her to marry a wedding singer.  Julia's sister becomes attracted to
him.  Conversations are misconstrued.  And the scriptwriter goes to
great pains to keep them apart.  We know that they'll get together
long before they finally realize that they're even attracted to one
another.  In fact, it's my guess that the movie bigwigs knew that
there wasn't much meat in this movie.  So, to compensate, they added
another comical element, where the story is set in the '80s and ample
opportunities are created to poke fun at this era.  
For example, one of Robbie's band members dresses like Boy George; one
of Robbie's friends wears the trademark red, leather jacket and white
glove like Michael Jackson.  And there are allusions to the future
which elicited a few chuckles.  At one point, a women looks at Robbie
and Julia and says, "I can just tell when people will be together
forever...just like Donald and Ivana; Burt and Loni."  There's even a
cameo by Billy Idol.
But whether you like this movie or not will depend on two things.  The
first is whether you like Adam Sandler.  As a comedian and jokester,
he's fun to watch.  But he doesn't show the heft here to be a leading
man.  Drew Barrymore is levels above him.  She is a delight to watch,
but you begin to wonder what she's doing with a wedding singer...or what
she's even doing in this movie.  The second is whether you're a child of
the 80s.  If you are, then you can appreciate some of the cultural humor
and the all-80s soundtrack.  If you aren't, then this won't be a very
pleasant experience.  I, however, am a child of the 80s and thoroughly
enjoyed Barrymore's performance.  "The Wedding Singer" was flat some of
the times, but at other times, managed to hit the right notes.

Title
Review for American Pie 2 (2001)
"AP2" is a frequently bawdy yet often hilarious film
about college freshman looking to have the summer of
their lives.  There's no better way to enjoy your
first summer out of high school than at the beach,
away from your parents and surrounded by bathing
beauties, plentiful amounts of beer, and your best
friends.  There's unlimited opportunity to talk about
sex, curse, and engage in generally bizarre behavior. 
Ain't summer grand?  And if you think that such a film
will never teach you anything worthwhile, you're
wrong.   Listen carefully: super glue and porn films
don't mix.
"AP2" reunites the entire ensemble from the first
film, led by likeable doofus Jim (Jason Biggs) who was
taught that making love felt like warm apple pie. 
Meanwhile, his friends also came to grips with their
changing lives and first loves.  It's been a year
since their infamous prom night (the setting of the
first "AP").  Has college taught them anything?  If
not, perhaps this summer will teach them something
themselves and about life.  These guys have a lot of
catching up to do and happily and funnily, we see that
nothing much has changed.  
Jim is still as klutzy as ever, and his sexual
encounters amount to embarrassing debacles.  Nadia
(Shannon Elizabeth), his one-time Czech girlfriend, is
scheduled to return at the end of the summer.  In
their only session, he...uh...blew it pretty badly. 
He's naturally nervous.  "She deserves filet mignon,"
he laments.  "All she'll get with me is rump roast."  
Luckily, he has the whole summer to prepare.  He gets
some sexual pointers when he revisits Michelle (Alyson
Hannigan), his kinky prom date who always has a story
about "this one time at Band Camp."  She enjoys an
expanded role from the first film and provides a sweet
element of poignancy.
The rest of the lovable gang has their share of issues
as well, although their screen time seems to be
reduced this time around.  Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas)
is trying to handle his feelings for former girlfriend
Vicky (Tara Reid) who wants to be just friends.  Oz
(Chris Klein) and Heather (Mena Suvari) try to carry
out a long-distance relationship while injecting a
1-900 spirit to their conversations.  Finch (Eddie
Kaye Thomas), whose sexual comeuppance with Stifler's
mom made him a God among all High School dorks,
studies about Tantric orgasms as he awaits her return.
And then there's the glorious, rambunctious Stiffler
(Seann William Scott) who is 100% id.  I believe that
a bust of his likeness should be mandatory in every
fraternity in America.  This guy is the party animal
that we all loved and simultaneously regretted knowing
back in college.  Our audience even cheered for him
when he first appeared.  Stiffler deserves his own
sitcom or a recurring role on Saturday Night Live.
But we're here for its raunchiness.  While the
direction and pace is erratic at times, many of the
scenes are daringly funny and gross-out memorable. 
The audience had a tremendous reaction to a scene
featuring spilled champagne and was in an uproar
during a sequence about libidinous lesbians.
"AP2" has lots of funny moments and the characters are
all quite endearing.  They try so hard to generate
laughter, it's impossible not to like them.  Everyone
looks happy to be back, and like old friends that we
haven't seen for a while, they are always welcome. 
Times may change; people may change.  But thankfully,
friends stay the same.

Title
Review for Girlfight (2000)
"Girlfight" is a rough-edged fairy tale about Diana
Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez), a burdened 17-year girl
looking to rise above her low-rent status.  But things
do not bode well for our heroine.  She endures a
miserable home life, has little prospect of escaping
the Brooklyn housing project in which she lives, and
sees a murky future virtually bereft of any real
opportunity.
Diana is not a happy teenager, bubbling with anger and
attitude.  In school, for example, she seems to spend
most of her time in detention hall.  She has been in
numerous fights this semester and is on the verge of
being expelled.  Home life is no better.  Her father
seems impartial to her and unsupportive of her
activities.  He's a bullheaded man intent on imposing
an outdated set of rules on his children.  He forces
Diana's bookish brother to take boxing lessons when
his talents clearly lie elsewhere.  And to Diana, he
can only ask why she won't ever wear a skirt.
As chance would have it, she pays a visit to her
brother at the boxing gym where he trains and watches
some of the action.  Intrigued, she sees that boxing
may be just the right outlet for her anger and
athletic ability.   Thus, a gritty little drama starts
to take shape as she begins to train.   Working as
hard as any Olympian, Diana learns the basic
techniques in a surprisingly short amount of time. 
Over a period of a few months, she increases her
strength, learns a variety of combination moves, and
begins to spar with the other guys in the gym (there
are no other female boxers there).  Her skill is
gaining her a measure of acceptance, while her
physical regimen gives her an important personal
boost.
During her time in the gym, she meets up with Adrian
(Santiago Douglas).  He's a promising featherweight
training for the pros.  She likes him and he's also
interested in Diana but has trouble with commitment. 
When the two eventually spar, he just sort of dances
around, not really sure what to do.  No doubt, his
indecision in the ring parallels his indecision in his
heart.  Diana, however, is not afraid to be
forthright.  "I love you," she confesses to him and
then connects with a vicious left cross.  With each
punch thrown and each bout fought, Diana grows, both
as a boxer and as a woman.
This hard-to-find film (currently playing in 28
theatres nationwide and only at the Mazza Gallerie in
DC) is satisfying fare with gritty performances and an
efficient plot line.  In fact, this film received high
recognition at last winter's Sundance Film Festival,
splitting the top dramatic prize and winning the
best-directing award.  Its struggling class milieu is
reminiscent of film's like "Flashdance" and "Saturday
Night Fever," which is a style seldom seen in today's
Hollywood productions.  In fact, there is a noticeably
unglamorous and homegrown feel to this film that lends
to its charm.    Brooklyn accents are heavy, the
picture is grainy, the sound is tinny (when the letter
's' is used, the hissing sound is inescapable), and
you can always hear the neighborhood's ambient sounds
of horns, barking dogs, car alarms and sirens.  It
also does well at conveying the intensity of the
fights, using quick edits and a flurry of staccato
notes.  This method is simple, yet effective.  And so
is the movie.  "Girlfight" keeps its balance,
maintains its intensity, and comes out ahead in the
end.

Title
Review for 6th Day, The (2000)
Imagine the following fascinating but profoundly
challenging ethical issues surrounding the topic of
cloning.
* World population explodes to such an extent that
food levels decrease to dangerously low levels. By
cloning fish and livestock, however, new food supplies
could be easily reintroduced into the food system to
eradicate any future shortages.  
* Your precious 10-year old daughter would be
heartbroken if she found out that her adorable pet
pooch has gone to Heaven.  To save her from the pain
and yourself from the excruciating task of explaining
to her what happened, you visit a business at the
local mall that specializes in cloning pets.  Within
two hours, Rover is 'resurrected'.  Your daughter
never knows the difference and life goes on.
* Deion Sanders, a talented football player acquired
by our Washington Redskins for an ungodly sum of money
to help ensure a championship season, suffers what
seems to be a career-ending injury. With that, the
hopes of winning the Super Bowl and the $50+ million
investment die.  Miraculously, Deion appears in the
next game looking as if nothing had happened.  The
pursuit of the coveted Super Bowl championship
continues and all seems normal.  
These are all compelling quandaries regarding the
future of Man and would certainly make for an
interesting sci-fi yarn.  However, despite the fact
that "The 6th Day" is layered with philosophical
undertones, the moral issues are much more compelling
than the film itself.
Starring a somewhat subdued Arnold Schwarzenegger,
this moderately entertaining science fiction/action
adventure film takes place in the "not too distant
future and sooner than we think."  Science and
technology has advanced to a point that the lines
between reality and artificiality are becoming
increasingly blurred.  Virtual girlfriends are
becoming as acceptable as the real thing. SimPals
(lifelike but eerily ugly dolls) are the hottest
holiday toy.  Meanwhile, there is heated debate that
rages over the legitimacy of human cloning.  Although
it is currently banned under law, a greedy
businessman, Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn), wants to
have the laws overturned.
Our hero, Adam (Schwarzenegger) gets caught up in a
bizarre and dangerous situation when he learns that
he's been cloned.  Waitperhaps he's the clone and the
other guy is real.  It's another absorbing question. 
But no matter how interesting this film could've been,
the basic DNA of any Schwarzenegger film sacrifices
ingenuity for eye candy and a bit of action.  You can
expect several gunfights that make it look like a sort
of revved up commercial for Laser Tag.  There are some
cool sci-fi effects that will surely please the
men-who-love-cool-gadgets population.  And, there are
some pretty good performances.  Of note is Michael
Rappaport as one of Drucker's henchman, and there is a
tender turn from Wanda Cannon who plays the dying wife
of a key scientist within Drucker's firm.
But where "The 6th Day" goes awry is that it is
basically a toned down version of the typical
Schwarzenegger movie.  It doesn't have over-the-top
action sequences, the violence level is somewhat
subdued (although there is one graphic scene), and our
hero even displays an uneasy gushiness.  It's even
rated PG-13.  Perhaps seeing so many of his other
cartoonish but action-packed films have caused me to
consider this project a step in the wrong direction. 
While it tries to be more than just a mindless action
flick, the movie doesn't really have anything to get
excited about.  You'll walk out of the theatre
thinking that you saw a preview for Playstation 3.


Title
Review for 15 Minutes (2001)
"15 Minutes" was probably a good idea when it was just
an idea and not the laborious 130-minute movie that it
ultimately became.  Probably envisioned as an
issue-driven film about the public's increasing
fascination with bizarre social behavior, this film
seemed to want to make a statement about how askew
society's moral compass has become.  
Our appetite for the obscene has mutated and swelled. 
It has helped to buoy shock programs like Roseanne and
Jerry Springer, spawn circus-like programs like Who
Wants to Marry a Millionaire and the XFL, and has even
reinvented the familiar-but-staid news reporting
format with efforts such as NakedNews.com.
Our standards of decency have considerably decreased,
especially in a metropolitan area such as New York
City in which the film is set.  With its diversity and
anything-goes atmosphere, it has degenerated into a
freakish arena of opportunism where the most bizarre
and frightful are often (and unjustly) rewarded.  
You can blame their undeserving fame on people like
Richard Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer), a tabloid TV
reporter whose personal mantra is "if it bleeds, it
leads" (referring to the kinds of pieces he wants to
show).  Ratings are all that he cares about, and to
that end, he'll risk his life to reveal the identity
of a psychotic killer or air the cold-blooded murder
of a celebrated public official.  Richard is a
double-edged sword, representing the aid and
hindrances that arise from selfishness and neutrality.
 He's an interesting character, but everything else is
extraordinarily dull. 
"15 Minutes" ultimately becomes nothing more than a
flat police thriller in which two psychopaths use
their infamy to become rich.  This duo realizes that
publishers and movie studios will pay for an absurd
story, the double jeopardy rule is a huge legal
loophole, and you can always plead insanity and never
have to go to jail.  "No one is responsible for what
they do," comments one of them.  So, off they go on a
killing spree where each additional victim means more
dollars for them.
On the case are Police Detective Eddie (Robert DeNiro)
and Arson Inspector Jordy (Edward Burns). 
Individually, these two are likeable characters. 
Eddie is a straight shooter while Jordy is earnest. 
But together, the two never develop any chemistry. 
There's a noticeable lack of character development. 
The characters (in fact, every character) just seem to
be doing their own thing as if they were different
planets following different orbits.
Actually, to give them some added dimension, there is
a romantic subplot involving both Eddie and his
girlfriend and Jordy and a pretty witness.  Jordy's
relationship is more pertinent to the story, but the
DeNiro romance could have been eliminated.  This
element seemed needlessly distracting.
While "15 Minutes" is marginal at best, we can sense
the passion that the filmmakers have for this topic
and the ideas that they wanted to get across.   The
message is admirable, but the film lacks polish and
wit and feels very rough around the edges.  In the
end, the good guys get their justice and the bad guys
get theirs, but we will never get ours.

Review for Full Monty, The (1997)
 25 years ago, the town of Sheffield, England was a thriving community
 that saw no end to it's growth.  Their steel industry was booming, the
 economy was robust, and the outlook was nothing but prosperous.  But
 that was 25 year ago.  Now, the once-great community has fallen victim
 to hard times.  The steel industry has all but died, unemployment runs
 rampant, and all evidence of prosperity has faded like the dyes of an
 overwashed shirt.  
 Yet, there are a few local denizens who remain in Sheffield, hoping to
 find a way to elevate themselves from their situation.  One is named
 Gaz (the sociopathic Begbie from Trainspotting).  He is a pessimistic,
 chain-smoking, and somewhat delusional bloke who can't seem to make
 anything work.  He has dreams and ambitions and is genuinely
 good-hearted, but the reality is that he is a separated, deadbeat Dad
 with a cute 11-yr. old son, whom he can not adequately take care of.
 Gaz loves his son very much, but the mother is fighting for sole
 custody of the boy, and Gaz needs to find work to pay for the
 expensive court battle ahead.  
 Gaz comes up with a crazy idea after passing by a club featuring the
 visiting Chippendales.  He convinces himself that if women would pay
 to see men strip, then he could do the same and make the money he
 needs.  But he can't do it alone and enlists the help of his best
 friend, Dave.  Dave, is also a casualty of the economic depression,
 but desperate times calls for desperate measures.  Calling themselves,
 HOT METAL, they begin to embark on their plan of assembling a group of
 studly men who will try to rival the Chippendales.  Of course, those
 that apply are not of Chippendale caliber.  They are either
 overweight, ugly or old.  They also can't dance and have no rhythm.
 Watch them in their first practice session and you'll see them running
 into each other, falling down, and being generally oblivious to
 anything that resembles a beat.  
 In another scene, a few women approach them, expressing reluctance in
 watching less-than-average looking blokes strip.  "Why would we want
 to look at you," they ask.  And with a spark of inspiration, Gaz
 declares that they'll get more than they expect.  "We're going to give
 you the full monty!" This is an expression meaning that they are going
 to go all the way - taking it all off!  But can they really go through
 with it?  Even Gaz doesn't know if he really wants to go through with
 it.
 What you'll find pleasing about this British, offbeat comedy is the
 way that the writers draw you into the group of aspiring strippers and
 through the various stages of emotions as they prepare for their
 once-in-a-lifetime gig.  You feel the moments that are shameful and
 embarrassing, silly and triumphant.  You'll watch how destiny brings
 these desperate souls together, and how they begin to gel as a family
 and as a team.  You begin to root for these people as they continue to
 practice and set their sights on their final performance.  You want to
 see them succeed and retain the manhood that left with the steel
 industry years ago.
 I have to give credit for the way this film was executed.  It has an
 intelligent screenplay, which allayed any fears that I had that this
 would be some weird knock-off of last summer's disappointing
 "Striptease."  What could have been racy is instead a nice balance of
 pathos and comedy.  The story is straightforward and moves quickly to
 its winningly funny conclusion.  The characters are all engaging.
 And, while I felt this weird feeling in my stomach every time I
 thought the actors on screen would begin to peel away layers of
 clothing, there was the proper dosage of humor injected into the
 scenes to act as an antidote.  Potential queasiness quickly turned
 into laughter.  However, be prepared to handle heavy English accents
 and several of out-of-shape butt shots.
 The Full Monty is a cute story that shows us how far people will go to
 attain the unattainable.  To do so, sometimes, we must bare our souls
 (and in this case, our bodies).  Fortunately, all you'll have to part
 with is a couple of dollars.

Review for Me, Myself & Irene (2000)
What's the first warning sign that you're about to
watch dimwitted entertainment?  The answer is when the
program has a narrator that sounds oddly like the guy
who narrated "The Dukes of Hazzard" or the guy who
sings the theme from "The Beverly Hillbillies." 
Here's another question.  What is the filmmaking
Farrelly ("There's Something about Mary") brothers
best known for?  The answer is an incessant desire to
bring gross-out yuckiness to the big screen.   Here's
the final question.  What can you expect from this
film, which combines a doltish sounding narrator with
Farrelly-type material?  The answer is a dimwitted,
gross-out movie that is about as fun and gross as
changing 10-day old kitty litter.
The film features the likeable but milquetoast Charlie
(Jim Carrey) who has been with the Rhode Island police
force for over 18 years.  Despite his badge, uniform
and tenure, he just can't seem to garner any amount of
respect.  That's pretty bad when you're an officer of
the law.  When he asks that a car be moved, the owner
throws him the keys and asks him to move it, to which
Charlie bashfully agrees.  When he tries to ask a
toddler to stop playing in the street, she screams and
scares him off.  The whole town laughs at him, but
Charlie just ignores it all.   He manages to keep the
indignity repressed deep inside.  Even his most
traumatic and heartbreaking experiences are locked
away.  Charlie just swallows hard and graciously
accepts his predicament.
Eventually, his angry side begins to surface.  When
irritated, Charlie slips out of his sissy demeanor and
transforms into Hank, who comprises all of the pent up
heartache, disappointment, and frustration that
Charlie has ever endured but put away.  Charlie avoids
confrontation; Hank invites it (when one is present,
the other is suppressed).  This is where Carrey gets
to have the most fun, but his actions as Hank the
Avenger are more like acts of an overgrown bully.  For
example, he dunks a young girl in a fountain for
talking back, threatens a boy for slurping too loud,
and even steals an ice cream cone from another young
tyke.  Against adults who have slighted him, his
vengeance manifests into acts of wonton crudeness.
His behavior is becoming a liability to the
department, so they assign him to escort a prisoner to
upstate New York.  She's Irene (an adorable Renee
Zellweger) who we later learn is being hunted by her
mob boyfriend.  Irene's only chance of survival might
be Charlie.  But our hero is not mentally capable of
leadership and is constantly fighting a battle against
Hank for control of his body.  Most of the film
centers on this bizarre triangle between Charlie,
Hank, and Irene.
Alas, this becomes a tiresome plot.  The primary
problem is that the film lacks the insight needed to
resolve the inner battle between Charlie and Hank, and
the gags weren't nearly as funny as those bizarre
situations from "There's Something about Mary."  At
least those gags took the audience by surprise.  Here,
the Farrelly brothers are trying to notch the
grossness up one level, but it really borders on
humorless disgust.  The best moments are when Carrey
is allowed to be his limber, silly self.  He's a good
actor who convincingly transitions between his two
altered states.  And Zellweger can do no wrong as the
girl who likes Charlie but is fearful of Hank. 
Ultimately, "Me, Myself and Irene" felt as
out-of-focus as Charlie's schizophrenia. 

Title
Review for Being John Malkovich (1999)
How's this for a wild ride?  Shoot down a darkened
tunnel at an amazingly high speed.  Experience a
cathartic transformation as you take on the life of
someone else for 15 awe-inspiring minutes.  Finally,
drop into a ditch by the side of the New Jersey
Turnpike.  No, it's not the newest ride at your nearby
amusement park.  Rather, it's a unique life-affirming
journey that one can take by entering a strange
portal.  If you've ever wanted to get inside someone's
head, particularly John Malkovich's, then this is the
way to do it.
`Being John Malkovich' is a satisfyingly and sublimely
rich film about the people we are and the people that
we want to be.  Who we are can be a gut-wrenching
nightmare.  For those like Craig (John Cusack), it's a
self-affirmation of failure and a perpetual state of
hopelessness.  Slovenly dressed, lacking in charisma,
and hoping to make it as a professional puppeteer, his
life is one big dead end.  `There's no need for a
puppeteer in today's world,' he states.  It doesn't
matter that he's an excellent puppeteer (the sequences
featuring puppets are astounding); he's a man who only
wishes to escape from the confines of his dreary life.
 Equally dreary is his loveless marriage to wife Lotte
(an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz).  Whatever magic they
once had has faded.  Looking like inebriated victims
that never left the 1960s, they emptily talk about
having children while forcing themselves to seem
interested in each other's events of the day.  Lotte
seems more interested in her pets, which include a
loquacious parrot and a chimp that can untie knots. 
Meanwhile, it's time for Craig to get a job because
his life as a street performer brings him more black
eyes than quarters (the scene that makes this evident,
featuring a nun and monk puppet is hilarious).
The ad that Craig answers brings him to LesterCorp,
situated on the 7˝ floor of a building where access
requires you to press the elevator's emergency stop
button at just the right moment.  Then, you need to
take the crowbar to force the doors open while the
alarm rings loudly in the background.  On this floor,
the ceiling is only 5 feet high to keep overhead
low,' quips the company's President (Orson Bean). 
This work environment confines him even more, and it's
no help that he's falling head over heels for Maxine
(Catherine Keener), a strong-willed co-worker that
flaunts her sexuality with as much chutzpah as her
merciless belittlement of him.  By this point, I think
that I'd want to be anybody but him too.
However, he soon makes a tremendous discovery that not
only may be the answer to his prayers, but also sets
the film's enjoyably surreal tone.  Craig discovers a
portal that actually allows him to enter the mind of
John Malkovich (Malkovich plays himself).  By assuming
this new body, all fears and disappointments are left
behind.  For him, this is the ultimate experience as
both a puppeteer and as a man who desperately wants to
leave his dismal life behind.  But it also holds some
interesting opportunities for Maxine, who wants to
exploit it as a business, and Lotte, who finds it
weirdly, sexually stimulating.  
BJM is endlessly inventive and continues to surprise
throughout while glazing the film with fresh ideas and
sharp dialogue.  I was especially impressed with a
sequence where Malkovich enters his own brain to find
out what he himself is really like.  Director Spike
Jonze deftly handles a complexly woven tapestry of
ideas and manages to find a satisfying resolution to
each.  And I suspect that you'll be revisiting many of
the ideas once you've left the theatre.  Expect an
Oscar nod for Best Film.  Thank goodness this film
wasn't called `Being Al Gore.'

Title
Review for Peacemaker, The (1997)
 This anticipated inaugural film by the newly created Dreamworks SKG
 production company is not a tremendous offering given the hype that
 has preceded its release.  However, it accomplishes three improbable
 but ultimately satisfying things.  It re-energizes the somewhat
 stalled career of leading lady Nicole Kidman.  It gives George
 Clooney, that medical hearthrob from television's ER, a chance to
 really flex his cinematic muscles.  And, it refreshes an increasingly
 stale plotline of stolen nuclear weapons and America as the target.
 As the crisis unfolds, we are introduced to Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole
 Kidman). As the acting head of the White House Nuclear Smuggling
 Group, she is the expert that's leading the investigation and the
 operation of recovering the stolen nuclear warheads.  With a PhD from
 Harvard under her belt, she is adamant about following rules and
 protocols, and is the perennial cautious planner that builds in
 contingencies for everything.  As she briefs the top brass on the
 intelligence that has been gathered so far, she is constantly
 interrupted by Thomas Devoe (George Clooney).  He is an intelligence
 officer with the U.S. Army's special forces who believes profiteers
 will sell these weapons to rogue governments.  Not the typical
 soldier, he is brash, bends rules, and takes great liberties to get
 what he wants including heavy bribes and savage in-your-face beatings.
 However, when it comes to things military, he is smart, clever, and a
 man of action.  He gets to the point and on people's nerves
 too...especially those of Dr. Kelly's.
 It doesn't take a degree in nuclear physics to figure out that these
 two are eventually paired up by the powers that be to save the world.
 But fortunately, the writers are able to give us two likable
 characters that can overcome the cliches of hardened Russians,
 sophisticated spy satellites, and bombs with digital readouts.  The
 two work in unison to overcome their distaste for one another's
 personality and skillfully negotiate their way towards the location of
 the warheads.  But as with all bombs with digital readouts, the
 audience knows that time is running out for the heroes.
 The Peacemaker, which was filmed in various locales around the world,
 evokes the look and feel of Tom Clancy's books-turned-movies.  A
 strong score helps to elevate the unfolding drama and the tension is
 constant throughout.  Clooney is perfectly cast as the virtuous and
 honorable military fighter.  He is macho.  He is action-hungry.  He is
 GI Joe.   Kidman also provides good balance as they race to save the
 world.  But despite the slick look of the movie and the constant level
 of excitement that is generated by the chase scenes, you'll come out
 with the feeling that most of what you saw was done in dozens of
 action movies in the recent past.  Also, at times the movie seems
 overly complicated as if simply adding more events and chases would
 somehow add to the film's weight.  Still, this kind of entertainment
 is scarce during the autumn, and you'll still be able to make peace
 with yourself for seeing it.

Title
Review for Love & Basketball (2000)
When you read your horoscope, there always seems to be
a passage about waiting for stars and planets to
align.  Supposedly, when this finally occurs,
something joyful and magical will happen.  For a few
glorious moments, everything seems to fall into place.
 But celestial synchronization doesn't happen too
often.  The planets continuously move along their own
distinct orbits.  They are at the mercy of the sun's
gravitational forces.
This cosmic representation might be what
writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood saw in creating
this charming film about a girl, a boy and their
delicate relationship.  `Love and Basketball' tells
the story of Quince (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan), two childhood friends from two different
worlds that want to be together but are inexorably
pulled in different directions by the forces of
basketball.
We first meet these two as young tykes at the local
playground.  Despite his youth, Quince already shows
the promise of a future star.  He doesn't think that
girls can ball,' but Monica shows that she can move,
dribble and shoot as good as he.  Quince doesn't like
this at all.  He is clearly irritated, yet he is also
fascinated with her abilities.  An unlikely friendship
is born, forged together by basketball.
The film now fast-forwards to their High School senior
year.  Each of them has immeasurable basketball
talent, but Monica's off-the-court situation is much
different than Quince's.   She struggles to convince
her parents that she is not wasting her time with the
sport, she struggles with her on-court bad attitude
that keeps her benched, and she struggles with finding
the heart that makes her a standout player. 
Basketball is her life, yet her future is always full
of uncertainty.  Quince, however, benefits from having
a father who is an NBA player, is gaining notice among
the scouts, and seems so sure that he's destined for
greatness that he's almost casual about it.
Through the years, the two remain close friends but we
detect a hint of romance.  Alas, basketball's forces
keep them from connecting.  Quince, now a hero for the
USC men's basketball team, finds that girls are
throwing themselves at him.  It is difficult to resist
this kind of temptation.  Meanwhile, Monica attends
the same college and plays for the women's team.  She
is committed to elevating herself from being a scrub
on the roster, which may mean neglecting Quince during
a critical time of need.  Throughout their college
lives and even in the years beyond, they drift closer
together and then further apart, only to see this
cycle repeat.  Their individual journeys are uniquely
poignant, and eventually force them to ask some
important questions.  Was their something missing in
their lives?  Can love and basketball co-exist?  These
are the tough questions that they'll continue to
explore throughout this amiable film.
`Love and Basketball' has a stately, epic feeling as
it follows Quince and Monica over more than ten years
of their lives.  We see their personal fight to be
professional players and their attempts at finding a
medium between the forces of love and basketball.  The
story also poetically incorporates a storytelling
device that can be likened to momentum shifts in a
real basketball game.  Divided into four parts (the
movie refers to these as quarters'), each act is set
during a different time period of their lives.  In one
act, we see Quince enjoying fame while Monica weeps in
the face of failure.  In the next sequence, it is
Monica who begins to rise while Quince begins to fall.
 We're never quite sure if Quince and Monica will ever
connect, but it will be joyful and magical if these
two stars finally align.

Title
Review for Green Mile, The (1999)
There is an underlying theme that runs through "The
Green Mile," which I think rings hauntingly true.  And
that message is this: Although love and brotherhood
are the pillars of society, evil constantly chips away
at its foundation.  Those who try to tirelessly uphold
goodness are subject to great duress.  Some grow weary
over time and give up.  Others continue their battle
through great sacrifice.  
"The Green Mile," set during the post-Depressionary
era in the deep South, is a touching and tender story
about two men who try to uphold these heavy pillars. 
Paul (Tom Hanks) is one of these men, whose outlook on
life is seriously challenged everyday.  He has taken
on some kind of ailment that causes him great pain. 
His best friend and warden of the Penitentiary (James
Cromwell) is suffering a personal tragedy.  And his
job immerses him in an environment that points toward
society's continual decline.  
Paul is a supervisor of correctional officers for Cell
Block E at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. 
Prisoners who come to this particular cellblock are
all convicted murderers who will soon be executed for
their heinous crimes.  One new arrival severely taxes
Paul's love for humanity.  Nicknamed Wild Bill' (Sam
Rockwell), he is mean, vulgar, and openly invites
confrontation.  No one deserves a swifter death than
this morally depraved psychotic killer does.  Paul is
also baffled by the mean-spiritedness of one of his
officers, Percy (Paul Hutchison), who likes to lash
out at cellmates out of sheer petulance.  Percy is
nothing but a selfish wimp, but only gets his way
because he is the Governor's nephew.  These sets of
circumstances would be enough to tax any man's
patience.  Yet Paul believes that good exists in
everyone, and exercises compassion and charity in
everything he does.
One day, he receives a new prisoner name John Coffey
(Michael Clarke Duncan).  He has been convicted of
brutally raping two young girls.  John is quite a
sight to behold.  With his muscular build and 300
pound, 7-foot tall frame, he could easily intimidate
the bravest of men.  But there's something gentile
about him.  "Do you leave the lights on after dark,"
he asks Paul in a deep, syrupy voice?  He's quiet and
simple-minded.  He's even afraid of the dark and
sometimes cries at night.  But what really humbles
Paul is John's unique gift of healing.  What John
possesses is a gift from God.  As Paul gets to know
him a little better, he begins to question his guilt. 
"I work with violent men everyday," he says.  "There
doesn't seem to be any real violence in him." 
The "Green Mile" is a wonderfully told story,
purposeful in pace and thoughtful in its development. 
Characters slowly blossom like flowers in the morning
air.  It takes over an hour to meet before all of the
characters are fully introduced.  The result is an
emotionally compelling story filled with vivid
characters, each with affecting tales of their own. 
Tom Hanks effectively conveys fear and awe in light of
what he has seen as well as his personal anguish given
his duty at hand.  And the supporting characters all
add to the movies overall depth.  I only wished that
it were 30 minutes shorter.  It does take quite some
patience to be able to sit through a three-hour movie.
 And the first and last 15 minutes are not as
impactful as the rest of the film.  But your time will
be well rewarded, and when the Oscar nominations are
announced, I suspect that this film will be well
rewarded too.


Title
Review for Jui kuen II (1994)
There's a great show that has arrived in the DC area,
and I can hardly wait to see it.  That production is
called "Dralion", performed by the world-famous Cirque
Du Soleil troupe.  Its theme is Chinese acrobatics and
it promises to be a spectacular show.  Most
performances have sold-out, although I was lucky
enough to have already purchased my ticket, which cost
me in excess of $60.  But if you can't buy any tickets
or can't justify its price, a great alternative for
only a fraction of the cost is this wild martial-arts
flick, featuring Jackie Chan, who is at his very best.
In this film, a movie originally released in Hong Kong
back in 1994, Chan plays Wong Fei-hong, a prankish son
of a respected herb doctor circa the 1920s.  The story
begins at a train station where Wong Fei-hong wants to
carry some medicine onto a train without paying the
tariff.  To sneak it aboard, he hides it in a
diplomat's suitcase.  Once the trip commences, he'll
just simply recover the medicine and be on his way. 
However, upon retrieval, he takes the wrong bag, and
subsequently becomes entangled in a plot that involves
an ambassador and an antiquities smuggling operation.
As with most of Chan's Hong Kong made films
re-released for the American audience, you'll find the
usual peculiarities.  These include awkward dubbing,
zany plots, screwy slapstick, and absurd
characterizations (a Counter Intelligence Officer that
appears early on seems to have an important role, but
disappears 20 minutes into the film; meanwhile, other
characters seemingly appear out of nowhere).  And the
story is usually just an excuse to see Chan in action.
However, this is a performance that will not
disappoint.  In fact, of the 70+ martial arts films
that Chan has made, most aficionados have ranked this
film as one his three best.  Indeed, Chan is in top
form and these fighting sequences have to be seen in
order to be believed.  The first sequence is
incredible.  Chan, with a short sword, goes against a
spear-wielding Manchu officer.  They fight in such
close quarters that just to maneuver those weapons at
the speed in which they fight is an incredible feat in
itself.  You may notice that in many fighting
sequences from other movies, the film speed increases
to try to make the fighters appear more awesome. 
Here, Chan and his opponent are moving so quickly that
you wished that the film speed could have actually
slowed down!
What makes Chan a true exhibitionist is his Drunken
Boxing style (an actual kung fu style).  By ingesting
large amounts of liquor, it loosens up the body while
allowing it to withstand higher thresholds of pain. 
Let him increase his blood alcohol level, and it's
like Popeye taking his spinach.  Here, he staggers, he
sways, and he kicks butt, mesmerizing the audience
with his acrobatic abilities while in the character of
a drunk.  There are a bevy of incredibly choreographed
fight sequences, culminating towards a terrific
showdown pitting him against an enemy who uses his
lightning quick legs to fight in ways that I had never
seen.  This stuff is truly amazing.  What a fun
matinee this is!

Title
Review for Dogma (1999)
The litmus test to whether you'll enjoy this movie
comes in the very first 15 minutes of the film.  An
eminent Cardinal of the Catholic Church is about to
unveil a marketing promotion to reinvigorate the
Church's waning attendance numbers.  Comedian George
Carlin plays the Cardinal.  He espouses the Church's
newest campaign, Catholicism Wow!  He points out that
people believe that the Church has lost its spark and
youthfulness.  This campaign intends to turn things
around.  To kick things off, he introduces the
Church's newest sacred image called Buddy Christ.  The
current holy but wholly depressing icon of Jesus
hanging from the cross gives the people the 'willies,'
as he puts it.  This updated, friendlier
representation has Jesus winking, giving a warm smile,
and displaying a Roger Ebert-like thumbs-up.  As
another component of his campaign, he designates the
entrance to his church as a mechanism of forgiveness. 
Simply pass through the arch, and all of your sins
will be forgotten.
This blessed arch is big news for two fallen angels,
Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck).  These
two were responsible for the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorra, which understandably incurred God's wrath. 
Exiled to Wisconsin, they have long-awaited their
chance to reenter paradise, and this new loophole in
Church dogma may just be their ticket.  The
consequence, however, is that we'll all be blinked out
of existence.  A celestial war is about to ensue, but
it is a human that will be needed to save us all. 
Bethany (feisty Linda Fiorentino) is selected for this
holy crusade.  She is visited by the 'voice of God'
(Alan Rickman) who asks her for her help.  Here's
another wacky moment.  He appears as a column of flame
(a la Burning Bush) in her bedroom.  She is not awed
by this presence, and instead, reaches for the fire
extinguisher.
She grudgingly accepts this bizarre mission.  Along
the way, she meets up with a host of celestial good
guys who want to help Bethany.  These include two
prophets, very foul-mouthed Jay (Jason Mewes) and
Silent Bob (Bob Smith); a muse-turned-stripper (Salma
Hayek); and Rufus, the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock, who
actually curses less than Jason Mewes).  Celestial bad
guys want to stop Bethany, led by Azrael (Jason Lee). 
He welcomes the end of existence and promises to help
Loki and Bartelby reenter paradise.
What detracts from an otherwise clever film is the
second act.  Story lines begin to splinter and it
isn't exactly clear who is trying to accomplish what
and for what reasons.  As the impending apocalyptic
events are about to unfold, explanations are given so
quickly that I felt that I needed to rewind the film
again in order to really understand what was taking
place.  Gratuitous violence begins to overshadow the
tone that has been established, and that made the film
seem unbalanced.
Still, I was able to get by the 15-minute litmus test,
and laughed at this satirically good-natured film.  In
part, I enjoyed Fiorentino's steady performance and
appreciated the unconventionality of this movie,
including Rufus's explanation of why no one has ever
heard of the 13th apostle.  And, if you can stay the
course, it would be no surprise that Jesus might
actually be black or that God was a woman (and they
might have been because I wasn't here 2000 years ago).
 Beneath the obscenities, there is intelligent
commentary about the belief structures in place within
Church doctrine.  I don't think it blasphemous of me
to say that Director Kevin Smith has certainly taken a
leap of faith with a film that has some genuinely
clever ideas.

Title
Review for Animal, The (2001)
"The Animal" is a marginally inspired comedy that only
manages to lumber along, generating just enough
momentum to keep it from stalling.  It's clunky and
slow, like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate
up a hill.  There are certainly better things you can
do with your time.
Actually, if you've seen the trailer, then you already
know the plot and have seen its funniest moments.  The
story centers on bland Marvin (Rob Schneider), who is
an Evidence Clerk at the local police department that
yearns to be a real officer.  But he's afflicted with
Loser-itis.   Dogs attack him, neighbors torment him,
children bully him, and his co-workers ignore him. 
Truthfully, with his bad haircut (seemingly modeled
after Weird Al Yankovic, Little Richard, and giant
poodles) and his unenthusiastic demeanor, we'd
probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun.  This is
actually bad because you can't like a character if you
can't develop sympathy for him.  We never do, and it
may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and
plummets to the canyon floor.
However, Marvin is found by an eccentric doctor
(Michael Caton) who uses a radical and experimental
procedure to save him, implanting our doofus with
various animal parts and organs.  As a result, Marvin
develops heightened senses and increased agility and
speed.  He can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body,
swim with the speed of a dolphin, and can run as fast
as a cheetah.  Imagine the comedic possibilities that
arise from this operation.  With his enhanced
abilities, he could now reap vengeance on all those
who have shunned him.  
However, the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn,
and instead, Marvin spends most of his time trying to
subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his
animalistic, sexual urges.  Goats beware!   He also
chases cats, urinates to mark his territory, or growls
at his enemies.  What he should've done was stick his
head in the sand like an ostrich.  
Equally tenuous is its other running joke, which
involves one of his friends (Guy Torry) who constantly
complains that everyone is treating him TOO nicely
because he's black.  "It's reverse racism," he
declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers
but none of them says anything.  This element doesn't
work the first time it's mentioned, and it becomes
increasingly trite with every recurrence.
You don't have to be as wise as an owl to realize that
"The Animal" is tame.  If there's any reason to see
this film, it's to see Colleen Haskell who makes her
big screen debut.  Remember her?  She was voted off in
week 11 of the 13-week program, "Survivor."  Here, she
plays Marvin's sunny love interest.  While her role
required very little actual acting, she seemed very
comfortable (even when Marvin licks the side of her
face like a lapping dog...yuck!).  With her adorable
disposition, radiant smile, and playful innocence, she
could be a Meg Ryan in the making.  It's too bad that
she's in such a mediocre offering


Title
Review for Gang Related (1997)
On the big screen, police in the big city are a corrupt breed.  They
unfairly wield their powers to exact their own self-righteous brand of
punishment, assuming the role of judge, jury and executioner.  These
themes were recently played out in the well-received Copland and the
entertainingly artsy LA Confidential.  Here, in this undermarketed film,
the writers revisit this theme, but the movie is not some lush,
cinematographic presentation, coated with heavy ambiance.  Rather, it
strips away the artistic fluff to give us a gritty look at two bad cops
desperately trying to dig themselves out of a situation gone bad.
Jim Belushi plays Detective DiVinci, a morally deprived, self-centered,
and prototypical 'bad cop.'  He has bad taste in clothes, a penchant to
use the "F" word whenever possible, a bad attitude, and a corrupt soul.
His partner in crime and punishment is Rodriguez (the late Tupac
Shakur), who is more reserved and slowly develops a bad taste for the
killings.  Their scam is simple, yet deadly.  These two sell drugs to
dealers.  But once the exchange is made, the cops kill the buyer, take
back the drugs to sell to someone else, and pockets the money.  The
murders are meant to seem gang-related.  They see nothing wrong in
taking the spoils of their quarry.  In their eyes, slaying drug dealers
reduces crime while making them rich.
Unfortunately, the victim of their latest killing is an undercover DEA
agent, which immediately brings a large investigation into the faces of
DiVinci and Rodriguez.  They work quickly to deflect their guilt.  They
manipulate the evidence, look for scapegoats, falsify claims, and then
uses the flag of authority to cover their tracks.  But with each
cleverly calculated move, a surprise sets them back.  Things become
steadily more interesting as the two cops in charge of finding
themselves must find a way out.
This film does well to offer pure drama, although the dialogue is quite
raw.  It didn't cheat us with car chases, explosions, or ridiculous body
counts.  The writer-director, Jim Kouf, has a good story to tell and
makes it affecting.   Shakur exudes an appealingly fragile charisma as
the conscious-stricken cop.  As he continues to question the path that
they are on., he begins to stray away from their partnership.  Belushi
is also quite good as his ever-growing sleazy counterpart.  As the
situation gets more and more out of control, we see the chaos that
springs from vigilantism and we feel the tensions that surround a
partnership under extreme duress.  Nonetheless, DiVinci continues on
with his amoral pep talks, which further alienates his partner.  We are
not only treated to an engrossing psychological war displayed between
these two, but are also rewarded with a clever sequence of events where
the two cops try to maneuver out of their guilt.  I was satisfied with
the way the story stayed focused on the frailties of human nature.
You'll find that this film offers no heroes nor villains.  In some
well-told stories, they're actually one in the same.

Title
Review for Rush Hour (1998)
The words "fun" and "Fall" don't usually go together.  We're done with
the mega-productions of the summer and we are approaching the time
period that is heavy on movies that are vying for Oscar's attention.  It
gets harder to find a true piece of popcorn fare that is consistently
pleasing and exciting to watch.  But "Rush Hour" manages to be just
that.  Although familiar in formula, this action-comedy is enormously
entertaining.
When the daughter of a wealthy Chinese consulate is kidnapped by a
Chinese crime organization, the FBI quickly take on the case.  The FBI
agents, however, don't want help from other people whom they think will
interfere with the successful return of the consul's daughter.  They
certainly don't want help from a foreign detective (Jackie Chan) who the
consul has personally requested.  And, they don't want help from the
local police.  So, to keep them out of the way, they tell the assigned
police officer (Chris Tucker) to babysit the arriving Chinese detective
and to stay out of sight until the case is solved.
When they first meet, it looks like a match made in Hell.  Both like to
work alone, and hate having a partner.  While driving around, Chan wants
to listen to the Beach Boys over the radio while Tucker insists on
listening to Hip-Hop.  But despite these and other oddball differences
(watch Tucker walk into a pool hall whose clientele are tough-looking,
black men and greet them saying "what's up, my ni**er" and then see what
happens when Chan does the same thing!), they both have one thing in
common.  They both want to save the consul's feisty and precocious
daughter.  To do so, they need each other.  Chan needs Tucker to show
him around LA.  Meanwhile, by taking Chan around, this will earn Tucker
brownie points with his boss.  During their investigation, they both get
to showcase their unique skills.  Tucker uses his soprano-ish,
mile-a-minute mouth to talk his way in and out of locations.  And when
trouble sparks, Chan steps up and we are treated to some terrifically
choreographed fight scenes featuring the Asian's gravity-defying martial
arts.
Rush Hour does two things very well.  First, it let's Tucker and Chan
showcase what they do best.  Tucker is genuinely funny especially when
he gets to make fun of his new partner.  Meanwhile, there's no denying
Chan's affability.  He's sweet, innocent, and packs a mean chop.
Secondly, the film has some strong performances from its supporting
players that elevates the suspense level, which is something that's hard
to do in a buddy cop comedy.  The Fall movie season certainly gets off
to a funny start.  This film offers a crowd-pleasing mix of comedy and
action that makes "Rush Hour" anything but slow.

Title
Review for X Files, The (1998)
Intriguing "X-Files" Reveals More Questions than Answers
"The X-Files: Fight the Future" is the first attempt to leverage the
appeal of the popular television series onto the big screen.
Incorporating elaborate sets, a complex yet intriguing tale that weaves
government cover-ups with deadly viruses and aliens, and the familiar
presence of two determined FBI agents, the result is a quick-paced,
conspiracy-laden movie that is somewhat hokey but enjoyably quirky.
After a supposed act of terrorism that results in incredibly horrific
disaster, our two heroes, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)
and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are being pointed at by the finger of
blame.  As an inquiry into their incompetence begins, Mulder is
approached by an eccentric man (Martin Landau) with wild ideas of
conspiracies, cover-ups, and a theory as to why the act of terrorism was
actually an act of our own government.  "The government is secretly
negotiating a planned Armageddon," he urges.  
Skeptical at first but ultimately open to any idea, as wild as they may
be, that would reinforce his personal quest to expose government
cover-ups and to get to the truth,  Mulder begs a tired and defeated
Scully to help him in his pursuit.  Meanwhile, someone has been watching
their every move and is taking steps to make sure that they never find
out the truth. 
As a story about conspiracies, it gives us a nice long list of elements
that keeps the audience involved while allowing the movie to easily
transition from one sequence/location to another.  These include: the
informant with his personal agenda that periodically gives out
questionably reliable information, characters that appear once early on
and then re-appear much later as murky warnings to oncoming danger,
narrow alleyways and clandestine meetings that provide a backdrop where
secrets are learned and business is taken care of, and a smattering of
clues that ultimately guides Mulder and Scully toward the truth.  
Having watched only two or three episodes of the popular tv series, I
can't really comment on whether this is better or worse than the average
episode.  Virtually every person that has appeared in the series does
make a brief appearance.  However, they amount to only cameos and don't
complicate the main focus of the story.  Also, there is a good deal of
exposition on the motivations of our two intrepid agents - for example,
we learn why Mulder has engaged this personal quest of his and why he is
viewed less-than-seriously by his peers.  Meanwhile, we hear why Scully
was assigned as his partner.  These are things that devoted fans already
know, so it is for the benefit of people like me.  Fans will probably
find these sections protracted and boring.
The spirit of the X-Files is geared towards things that are 'not easily
categorized or referenced.'  As such, the story will raise more
questions than reveal answers.  For example, what was the motivation
behind the government perpetuating an obviously self-destructive course
of action?  And, if the conspiracy is global in nature, why are there
only two lone FBI agents trying to solve the whole thing?  Perhaps this
is all part of the mythology of the series.  Regardless of my lack of
viewership and the questions that I had, I thought that overall, the
movie worked in  delivering a witty string of sequences that melded
conspiracy and science-fiction, and I did like the general look and the
atmosphere of secrecy that it projected.

Title
Review for Wild Wild West (1999)
If you haven't plunked down your hard-earned money yet for "Wild Wild
West," the latest summer holiday offering from Will Smith, let me say
right now that your money will be better spent on a Starbuck's
Frappacino or on a Ben & Jerry's Sundae.  These treats are great relief
from the summer heat.  In contrast, this film made me simmer in
disappointment.
I can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into
special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually
take a back seat.  This was true of Star Wars Episode I, but at least
in that film, the story and the characters were still in the back seat.
 In this film, they are no where to be found.  What remains are
hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish
aristocrats, lots of female extras who look like Can-Can dancers, and a
clunky, 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a
mechanical tarantula.
Two men are asked to stop this threat.  One is Artemus Gordon (Kevin
Kline), an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to
best his opponents.  Among his creations are false breasts and the
bulletproof vest.  The other man is Jim West (Will Smith), who prefers
the shoot-first-then-shoot-some-more method of investigating.  Although
their individual talents must be combined to achieve success, their
interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate, two-man
Vaudevillian act.  For example, there is a scene where West, being more
debonair than the reserved Gordon, notes that the fake breasts should
be filled with water rather than buckwheat, which is what it is
currently filled with.  "Now touch my breast," West says.  Gordon does
so and then softly coos his approval.  I found myself groaning at this
kind of silliness.  The script fails to generate any sense of drama,
humor, or fun for that matter.
I did enjoy Kline's reserved performance, but was surprised at how much
latitude they gave to Smith.  Could it be that Will Smith is just so
bankable that he's not even required to act?  It was as if the director
was yelling "Will Smith, do your own thing...AND ACTION!"  Here's an
example.  In this scene, Will Smith is about to be hanged by a group of
angry white people.  He must endear himself to the crowd to escape. 
The director yells, "Will Smith, do your own thing...AND ACTION!"  In
another scene, he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save
his comrades.  "Will Smith, do your own thing...AND ACTION!"
Worse still, the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is
a horrid mess.  There are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers
going up and down everywhere you look.  There's actually a lot of
imagination at work in this film.  There are some genuinely clever
inventions and gizmos introduced, but all of this imagination is wasted
in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat.  And that's
too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than Will
Smith just doing his 'thing,' this film might have been palatable.  As
it turns out, "Wild Wild West" is the wild, wild worst and receives my
vote for biggest disappointment of the year.  


Title
Review for Nurse Betty (2000)
Betty (adorable Renee Zellweger, who could charm the
Grinch) is a woman who would be better off living any
kind of fantasy.  But the closest she comes to it is
by being an avid watcher of the sudsy "A Reason to
Live," a "General Hospital"-esque soap opera.  She is
so enrapt in its story that not only can she recite
many of its lines, she is moved to become a nurse
herself.  But her bullying, mullet-headed husband
quickly squashes any dreams that she may have.  This
louse of a partner cheats on her behind her back,
never remembers her birthday, and ridicules her for
watching soaps.  "It's only people with no lives that
watch other people's fake lives," he disdainfully
says.  This is the kind of guy that every woman can do
without.
The husband is not only a cheat, but he's also a
thief.  And when he double-crosses one of his business
ties, two hitmen come to town to kill him.  Betty
witnesses this horrible act of violence, and as a
result, slips into a state of dementia.  She enters
her ultimate fantasy by living her life within the
realm of her favorite soap.  She packs her things and
heads off to Southern California in search of the
heartthrob doctor (Greg Kinnear) that heads the cast
of "A Reason to Live" believing that she once jilted
him and now wants to make amends.  She's a mixture of
glee and delusion
This is the part of the story that is the most
farcical and interesting.  Arriving in L.A. in a
nursing uniform that makes her look more like a
Halloween party-goer rather than a functional nurse,
compassion and dumb luck gains her employment at a
local hospital.  She even manages to meet her
fictional doctor.  And when they do, she talks as if
she is on the show.  Instead of laughing at her, the
actor thinks that she is a talented method actress,
projecting a Doris-Day-thing and improvising an
audition.  He is flattered and her fantasy continues.
But all is not heaven for our heroine.  A darker side
to this film emerges as the two hitmen (courtly Morgan
Freeman and Chris Rock, who seems to have his squelch
volume stuck at maximum), try to track her down.  Not
only is Betty a witness to the murder, but the car in
which she has driven contains something that these two
are trying to retrieve.  
"Nurse Betty" thus becomes something of a twisted
Cinderella story.  There is an inventiveness that the
writers achieve in which the magical realism of
Zellwegger's world is countered against the
no-nonsense world of Rock's.  But, the plot lacks the
charisma that is needed to maintain the weekend
moviegoer's attention.  The tone also seemed a bit
unbalanced.  It brims with sweetness when the story
focuses on Betty's fabled world, but the 'hitmen'
angle injects a sour feeling, especially since Rock
curses like it was as involuntary as his breathing
process.  As a whole, the film did have its moments. 
It had some original ideas.  And, it may have won a
writing award at this year's Cannes International Film
Festival.  But it's questionable as to whether this
dark fable will win over your approval.

Title
Review for Sliding Doors (1998)
Clever Storytelling Behind "Sliding Doors"
Did you ever wonder what might have been if you had just made it through
the intersection before the light turned red?  Made it on to a bus just
before it left?  Made it on to the train just before the sliding doors
closed behind you?  How might your destiny change in a moment's time?
For Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow), her future will take on two completely
different paths determined entirely in a split second.  And the audience
gets to see them both.  If she catches the awaiting train, she will go
home to her boyfriend, Gerry (John Lynch) who is a meek bloke and an
uninspired novelist.  She will also catch him in bed with his old
girlfriend, Lydia (Jeanne Triplehorne).  If she misses the train, she'll
wind up hailing a taxi, becoming the victim of a mugging, and returning
home too late to discover Gerry's infidelity.  In essence, what we will
see are two parallel stories, and so the question you have to ask is
whether both of them are interesting.
In Scenario 1 (she catches Gerry and Lydia in bed), Helen will meet up
with charming James (John Hannah), with whom she will eventually fall in
love.  They are a likable couple and their developing bond is engaging.
He inspires her to start her own company and take control of her own
life rather than sacrificing it all for Gerry.  Scenario 2 (she comes
home too late) is a little more convoluted as Gerry goes to great
lengths to hide Lydia's presence despite Helen's growing suspicions.
Comparing the two timelines, the love story is by far more enjoyable and
cute because you could sense the chemistry between Helen and James.
Their story was engaging.  But in the other scenario, I couldn't quite
understand Gerry's fatal attraction to Lydia.  His constant efforts to
hide Lydia's existence from Helen seemed more like comedic foolishness.
For example, when Helen arrives home just after Lydia leaves, a
surprised Gerry leaps onto a pillow to remove Lydia's earring which was
left behind.  Then, he darts over to the dresser to hide one of the
brandy glasses that the two were using.  All the while, he is nervously
trying to deflect any suspicions.  Helen is far too smart for this kind
of defense.
"Sliding Doors" is a cleverly constructed story that is far more
complicated and impressive in structure than in content.  The movie is
edited well, making a smooth transition between the two timelines.   It
is easy to tell which scenario we are watching and despite the constant
switching, we do not lose focus as to what's going on.  Hannah is
charming and Paltrow delivers a very competent performance and carries
the weight of this movie on her shoulders with confidence.  If only the
material was worthy of her efforts...

Title
Review for X-Men (2000)
Rogue (Anna Paquin) has the power to absorb a person's
living energy merely by touch.  She can't control this
power or its intensity.  Cyclops (James Marsden) must
wear a special visor; otherwise, opening his eyes will
create an explosive burst of deadly energy.  Thus, he
can never look upon the one that he loves with his own
eyes.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is an embittered and
belligerent soul.  He can't remember his past, and
worst of all, he has no idea how his body was
transformed into some kind of walking Ginsu knife.  
These are the X-Men, specially gifted people who are
psychologically conflicted.  "X-Men" the movie also
seems somewhat conflicted and unbalanced.  Yes, it has
some style and it's very cool to watch these wild
powers being unleashed.  And it's impossible not to
like Patrick Stewart as the benevolent Charles Xavier
and Ian McKellen as the bent-on-world-domination
Magneto.  But beyond this, there is little to marvel. 
It is conspicuously devoid of action sequences, though
the finale is impressive.  It lacks the color and the
energy that has propelled this comic book series into
the stratospheric best seller that it is.  And, there
are just so many characters that many of them speak no
more than two or three lines (though to be fair, this
series has introduced more than 300 since it first
appeared in 1963, and in this film, there are only
eight.)
Unfortunately, this movie is more about background
than anything else.  It's a 100-minute introduction
into the world of the X-Men, and this is exposition
that fans would probably rather do without.  "Every
few millennia," the narrator says, "evolution leaps
forward."  The result can be both wondrous and a
curse.  For example, some may develop telekinesis,
telepathic ability, or even the ability to control
weather.  Despite these amazing powers, because you're
a "freak of nature", you are feared and hated by
humanity.  At this moment in time, a zealous Senator
(Bruce Davison) is proposing a mutant registration
program.  He pleads to the people, "they are among us.
 We must know who they are and what they can do."
Although this worries the sagacious Xavier, he
believes that mutants and humans can peacefully
co-exist.  Magneto thinks otherwise.  From personal
experience, he knows what it's like to be an outsider
and the destructive rage of a bigoted society.  So, he
decides to show the human race firsthand what it's
truly like to be a mutant even if its consequences
might mean large-scale death of Holy War proportions. 
Supporting his efforts are Sabretooth (Tyler Mane),
who has the strength of 20 men and the speed of a
gazelle; The Toad (Ray Park), who creatively uses his
12-foot projectile-like tongue; and the colorful
Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who can assume the
likeness of just about anyone and does so with
reckless abandon.  But Xavier and his X-Men are well
trained in the use of their powers and are prepared to
do battle on behalf of mankind.  
The problem with "X-Men" is that it doesn't provide
sufficient power and pathos.  The average moviegoer
and especially the fans will be somewhat disappointed
with the generic plot line.  Many characters,
especially Storm (Halle Berry), are fairly flat and
only look cool when they summon up their powers.  The
one exception was Wolverine.  This walking switchblade
is probably the most popular character among fans. 
Newcomer Hugh Jackman understands the fan's
appreciation for Wolverine's testy nature.  To
properly motivate himself, he took a cold shower prior
to shooting.  He even gets the best line of the movie
when he turns to Cyclops and warns him to "keep your
eye open."  The film has its visual pleasures and some
amusing moments.  However, this limp adaptation does
this comic book sensation very little justice.

Title
Review for Affliction (1997)
As any sociologist will attest, your childhood and the types of
parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an
adult.  Parents that are supportive and environments that are
nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms
that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives.  But if your
upbringing is marred with violence, hate and dysfunctionality, then
your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with
psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome.  `Affliction'
explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly
nightmarish childhood.
The man in question is Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte).  Here is a man
who is like any other citizen on the surface.  He is a productive
member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you
and me.  But as you scratch beneath the surface, something scary and
evil begins to rear its ugly head.  We see that he is a mean-tempered
person.  He has a hard time taking control of his emotions, which
usually gets the better of him.  He is quick to apologize for his
actions and wants to be a gentle person, but something is sparking a
tendency towards violence.  He also has tremendous problems with
relationships.  He is divorced and his only connection to love is his
daughter.  But his bearish persona and stature alienates her.  He is
visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves
him.  His demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl
(Sissy Spacek) at risk.  She tries to remain true to him and
supportive, but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this
kind of person, relationships will ultimately end like sentences
ending with an exclamation point.  Finally, he is spiteful and
vindictive.  As a rejected father, he initiates a custody battle that
seems hopeless.  As the town's only police officer, he issues a
speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died.  We can see that
this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain.  He is a
prisoner and a slave to it.  He is moving towards a level of madness
and insanity that defies comprehension.   What kind of force can move
a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who
genuinely care for him?
We learn that the answer is his father (James Coburn).  This is the
kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any
woman would be afraid to meet.  He is an overbearingly misogynistic
and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist.  We see his tyrannical
behavior through flashbacks.  To heighten the father's churlishness,
the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very
frightened person.  Very effective.  Today, Wade's dad is quite
elderly, but still manages to instill fear into a grown man.  The
influence that the father possesses is inescapable, and its unsavory
effect clamps down hard on the tortured Wade.  The result is every
son's nightmare  becoming like the father that one has always dreaded
to be. 
This is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama, and
Nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to
become a detriment as well as a necessity.  He's a hulking person who
is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father. 
Coburn displays heft as the bitter dad.  But, it's most certainly not
Saturday-night-friendly fare.  There's nothing light or fluffy about
this film.  That may turn many moviegoers away.  But it's certainly
worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing Nolte's and
Coburn's raw acting talents. 


Title
Review for Legally Blonde (2001)
Seldom are lighthearted comedies so smooth and
enjoyable to watch as `Legally Blonde,' a very
palatable comedy that is both cute and funny. 
Underneath its exterior of cutesy silliness, there is
inner beauty as well.  Don't let it's vapid look of
cluelessness fool you.  The film's heart and mind show
intelligence, warmth and a great deal of appeal.
So too does it's lead character, Elle Woods (Reese
Witherspoon), whose effervescent personality and sunny
disposition make her thoroughly likeable.  Alas,
because of her radiant blonde hair and her love for
all things pink, she is mistakenly assumed to be a
ditzy airhead.  Okay, she may be the spitting image of
a Barbie doll, a TOTALLY popular member of her
sorority (whose membership seems to require that you
are blonde, fit, and wear belly-button exposing
outfits), and considers fashion mag Cosmopolitan to be
her bible.  However, she has a 4.0 grade point
average, is brilliant when it comes to merchandising,
and is an aspiring fashion designer.
But that's not enough for her long-time beau and
selfish cad, Warner (Matthew Davis), who has just been
accepted to the prestigious Harvard School of Law.  `I
need someone serious,' he coldly says and then breaks
up with her.  From this moment on, she sets out on a
mission to prove that she is good enough for him, and
more importantly, that she can rise above the
fluffiness of her own lifestyle.  
She sacrifices the party life in favor of LSAT study
sessions and submits a hilarious video essay on why
she would make a great lawyer.  Witherspoon is
adorable and possesses a girl-next-door demeanor that
gives her an endearing charm.  We care about you!  We
feel for you!  You go girl!
Up to this point, smiles are a sure thing.  But it
gets even funnier once our determined freshman arrives
at Harvard.  The poor thing is just not prepared for
the rigors of academia.  Hollywood and Harvard just
don't mix and she quickly becomes the subject of
ridicule by both teachers and students alike.  While
everyone else brings laptops to class, she brings a
heart-shaped notebook with pink, feathery frills.  She
is immediately challenged by a catty coed (Selma
Blair) and has a difficult time gaining acceptance
among her other classmates.
But don't underestimate Elle, who has a mind as sharp
as a hairdresser's safety pin and a heart as big as
Texas.  She studies rigorously, and soon she's going
nose-to-nose with the snobbish elite over Socratic
principles of law.  She even garners a highly coveted
internship at a top firm where she assists in
defending a client in a celebrity murder case. 
Incredibly, the defendant is a former sorority sister,
and Elle's background allows her to have the
psychological insight that eludes the other lawyers.
Yet while she discovers new frontiers of determination
and develops a new sense of focus, she never forgets
about the virtues of friendship and helping others. 
This is brought forth in a cute side story involving
an aging manicurist who is still waiting to meet Mr.
Right.  Elle imparts a hilarious lesson on how to
attract guys by using a bend and snap motion.  She
possesses brains, beauty and a bubbly sense of humor. 
And `Legally Blonde' does too.

Review for Topsy-Turvy (1999)
Long before Andrew Lloyd Webber and the days of Rogers
and Hammerstein, there was the era of William Schwenck
Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan.  These two comprised one
of the most prolific show business teams of their
time.  Gilbert and Sullivan were responsible for a
string of memorable (and some not-so-memorable) comic
operas put upon the London stage during the late 19th
century.  
However, their creative juices would begin to run dry.
 Praised for such dandy showpieces as "The Pirates of
Penzance" and "H.M.S. Pinafore," the duo's next
offering, "Princess Ida," is labeled as formulaic and
predictable by an influential London Times critic. 
This infuriates librettist Gilbert (John Broadbent),
who believes that "Ida" is a great play.  However,
composer Sullivan (Allan Corduner) ruefully agrees
that "Ida" does feel a bit recycled.  Worse yet,
Sullivan's health is failing.  He declares that he
needs some time to rest before being able to continue
composing new songs.  In the meantime, the sweltering
summer heat is keeping audiences away from the
theatres, so box office receipts are steadily
declining.  And, there seems to be a variety of
personal problems that are brewing among the cast
members.  This all amounts to a serious setback and
does not bode well at all.
"Topsy-Turvy" is a sweet film that focuses on this
particular period of this partnership's lives when it
seemed that the two were ready to split up over
creative differences.  In a meeting that the two have
to discuss their future and current impasse, Sullivan
explains that he has always understated his music to
Gilbert's words.  Surprised to hear this, Gilbert
interjects that he has always subordinated his words
to the grandness of the music.  Yet, despite their
mutual respect for one another, they can not move
forward.  Gilbert's latest idea is an opera about a
couple who finds a magic potion.  Sullivan fires back
that his idea is none too different from a recent
production about a couple that finds a magic lozenge
and none too different from another recent production
about a couple that finds a magic coin.
It is not until Gilbert visits a Japanese exhibition
that his creativity becomes reinvigorated.  Gilbert is
entranced by a Kendo sword fighting demonstration, the
raw emotions brought forth through a kabuki play, and
a dainty tea ceremony where the waitress can only say
"six pence, please."  This experience steers him
towards a new and better work, eventually turning out
to be "The Mikado."  Sullivan, now feeling better,
loves the idea and begins to set his words to music.
Like many British films, the strength of this one is
its charm.  I credit most of it to the wonderful sense
of frivolity that exists during this time period where
music and laughter, good manners and wonderful dress
seemed like the guiding principles of the day.  I
especially enjoyed Broadbent's portrayal of Gilbert
who seemed to always suffer in deadpan silence in his
struggle to create his next great work.  In one
passage, he talks about his estranged mother.  "No one
respects her more than I do," he says.  "And I can't
stand the woman!"  I also appreciated the sacrifice
that the cast, chorus and orchestra members went
through as they prepared for the show (having once
been myself an orchestra member for my high school
plays).  "Topsy-Turvy" is not the typical film that
presents a problem, dramatic arc, and then a solution.
 Writer Mike Leigh does not write for Hollywood. 
Thus, Gilbert and Sullivan's dilemma is not a race
towards some glorious resolution.  Rather, it is more
like a leisurely walk through a Victorian park that
unveils delicate beauty in every direction you look.

Review for Where the Money Is (2000)
The keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber, the naive
ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse, and a partnership
that blossoms between the two are the fine components
that make up a modest, little caper adventure entitled
`Where the Money Is.'
The elderly bank robber is Henry (Paul Newman), a
famous criminal that was only recently caught.  He has
pulled off dozens of successful heists and has
probably stashed away a small fortune.  Always the
shrewd thinker, he begins working on a plan to get out
of jail.  This involves years of studying Buddhism and
self-hypnosis.  When he is prepared to execute his
plan, he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke. 
Now a seemingly twitching vegetable, he is temporarily
transferred to a state-run home.
Carol (Linda Fiorentino) is the nurse that cares for
him.  She's a very bright person with a good heart. 
Yet, her life is a miserable waste of time.  The most
exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars.  Her days
at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair
calisthenics.  Worse, she's in a dead-end relationship
with high-school sweetheart Wayne (Dylan McDermott). 
They became a couple because they were king and queen
of the prom.  To her, this made sense long ago.  But
now, it's a different story.  
Wayne seems equally bored with his life, but is
content enough to stay put.  Wayne's greatest ambition
is to become a night shift supervising foreman.  Carol
feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital
patients, but she's never been anywhere else and
doesn't see many other opportunities in life. 
However, when Henry falls under her care, her outlook
begins to change.
The medical reports may state that he suffered a
massive stroke.  Carol, however, begins to grow
suspicious that Henry may just be faking it after all.
 Maybe she can get through to him, and maybe she can
learn something about the money that he has stashed
away.  The opening 30 minutes are filled with
hilarious attempts of Carol trying to bring Henry
back to life.'  And what are some of Carol's
resuscitation techniques?  Perhaps an erotic lapdance
might stir his senses.  If that fails, maybe she'll
try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a
20-foot high pier into the cold lake below.
When he finally comes out of his state of self-trance,
the movie's direction changes, though it remains
equally if not more entertaining.  Carol sees that
Henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness. 
She is invigorated by his commanding presence and
refreshed by his vibrancy.  This, of course, puts
Wayne in an odd situation.  Henry and Carol's bond
grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to
rob an armored car.  Henry needs this heist because he
is unable to retrieve his original stash.  Meanwhile,
this is Carol's ticket to a better life.  Wayne is
uncomfortable with the situation, but helps out
nonetheless.  However, his lack of commitment
threatens their success.  The heist sequence is
suspenseful, well paced, and casts the uneasy feeling
that something will horribly go wrong.  
`Where the Money Is' does more to spotlight Newman and
Fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a
nifty heist.  Newman is the real joy of the film,
adroitly showing that at age 75, he's still really hot
stuff.  He possesses a sly smile, displays a
dominating attitude, and a projects a demeanor that is
undeniably attractive.   Fiorentino is also a fun
presence.  You root for her despite her sense of
amorality.  Sure, she wants to commit robbery and has
little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken
man into a lake, but we can see that to escape her
dead-end world, she needs to do something drastic. 
With two charismatic characters such as these, it's
hard to ignore that `Where the Money Is' is where the
fun is.

Review for Waterboy, The (1998)
Actually, if you've seen any of Adam Sandler's films, you know that
you can expect a film that is likably dim-witted.  Sandler was affable
in his last film, theWedding Singer.  Here as the meek Bobby Boucher,
he hasn't lost any of his charm as a doofus whose greatest desire is
to become a respected water distribution engineer for the local
college football team.  He talks about PH levels, temperature, purity
and other snippets that could make him the top sales person for Evian.
 But his doltish demeanor doesn't wash well with the players.  They
constantly make fun of him, and he is eventually fired by the
mean-spirited coach (Jerry Reed).
He eventually finds work at another local college, whose football
team, the Mud Dogs, is the laughing stock of the region.  Those
players also make fun of Boucher, but here the coach (an affable Henry
Winkler) tells him to stick up for himself.  During a scrimmage play
when the school's quarterback pushes Boucher too far, he begins to
visualize all of the people that have ever been mean to him and then
Presto - he charges him with the fury of a raging bull and levels him
flat on his back.  This act of tackling brilliance catches the coach's
eye, and he begs Boucher to become the new linebacker for the team. 
But there are lots of obstacles.   Boucher has never played football. 
He'll have trouble in a college atmosphere because he was
home-schooled (he declares in animal biology class that alligators are
not aggressive because of an enlarged medulla oblongata, but that they
are ornery because they have lots of teeth and no toothbrush.'). 
He'll need to win the respect of his team.  Finally, his eccentric
mother (Kathy Bates) opposes her son playing foozball'.   What's a
dim-witted doofus to do?  Well, you can expect Boucher to make enough
of an impact to guarantee them a spot in the highly touted Bourbon
Bowl where Boucher will have the chance to face the football team and
the mean-spirited coach that made his life Hell.
Admittedly, there were several parts of the movie that I found fairly
funny, and the crowd seemed to enjoy the humor of it all as well. 
Sandler has a boyishness that is endearing and even sympathetic.  The
movie gave us enough to keep us involved for the 90-minute duration,
and I liked this movie a little bit better than The Wedding Singer
because there was more of a story to tell and more things to laugh at.
Still, the film itself is only about as good as the Mud Dogs, whose
current losing streak of 41 straight games is enough to make you
wonder if one man can change the fortunes of a whole team. Sandler
gives it the old college try.

Review for Living Out Loud (1998)
Judith (Holly Hunter) has been a devoted wife who was comfortable with
her life even if it meant sacrificing her friends and, for the most
part, being invisible to everyone except her husband.  But after 15
years of marriage, it's finally over.  He leaves her for a younger
woman.  She tries to suppress her anger like so many of us would, and
tries to pick up the pieces of her vulnerable life.   But, as you can
imagine, with all that hate and confusion simmering inside of a soul
filled with charity and love, it can be an immensely traumatic time
for her.  Judith is a genuinely kind person who routinely goes out of
her way to make others feel better, whether it's the bed-ridden
patient that she cares for or the elevator man in her apartment co-op
who has just recently experienced a death in the family.  But now she
is alone, and she needs to break free of her self-imprisonment.
She meets up with two individual that help to soften her hard edges
and help her to realize that there's more out there than remorse and
anguish.  One is Pat, the elevator man working in her 5th Avenue
apartment co-op (Danny DeVito).  He has gambling problems, a ruined
marriage and a dying child.  The grief that he experiences is not all
that different from Judith's.  Misery loves company, and they begin to
share some of their thoughts over cups of coffee, wine and precious
moments in the elevator.  A second influence is torch singer Liz
Bailey (Queen Latifah), who befriends her in a way a guide would when
you're on vacation.   She has a weakness for gentle, beautiful men
who, to her dismay, always turn out to be gay.  But that doesn't mean
that she will stop searching, and this philosophy is something that
Judith begins to pick up on.  There's no reason to live if you're only
going to live safe.  And Judith takes small but deliberate steps to
expand her world.  Among other things, she calls in a masseuse to give
her an erotic massage and also accompanies Liz to a lesbian nightclub
that looks like a German Expressionist's wet dream where Judith
discovers that her fantasies are not entirely beyond her reach.  
Holly Hunter turns in a nice performance as a meek woman looking for a
chance to forgive, break out and recapture her identity.  DeVito and
Latifah also turn in competent performances as they bring Judith more
in touch with herself as well as follow through on personal plans of
their own.  Yet, the movie never really achieves any kind of dramatic
oomph.  I also question some of the dialogue in the film, which
sparingly used the `F' word and gay bashed a little too much. This
film seems to cater to a 40+ crowd, but these elements, which left a
strange taste in my mouth, will probably be greeted with greater
disdain among that group.  Nonetheless, I appreciated the all-around
performances and am convinced that `Living Out Loud' is not such a bad
thing to do.

Review for Blast from the Past (1999)
If you meet Adam Webber (Brendan Frasier), you'll notice something
wonderfully appealing about him.   He's extremely well-mannered,
displays a generous amount of social grace and etiquette, exhibits
almost-forgotten codes of chivalrous conduct, and really knows how to
swing dance.  But you'll also notice something strangely odd about him
as well.  He's surprised to see black people (upon seeing one, he
exclaims, `oh my lucky starts  a Negro!').  He's not very familiar
with riding mass transit.  And when someone states that they are
gay', Adam thinks that they are just extremely happy.  Exhibiting a
Kennedy-era look and attitude, you might think that he was holed up
somewhere for the last 30 years.  Well, that's close.
"Blast from the Past" looks at the Webber family(Dad played by
Christopher Walken; Mom played by Sissy Spacek) who, thirtysome years
ago during the height of the cold war, retreated underground into
their elaborate fallout shelter believing that nuclear war was at
hand.  While underground, Adam was born, and he was raised in a vacuum
of time that featured stubby haircuts, endless Honeymooners reruns and
knowledge dispensed by his Dad that only went up to the mid-60s.  But
now, it is present day and any residual radiation from the nuclear
fallout should have dissipated.  And in a funny sequence, the father
takes a peek at the outside world for the first time in thirty years. 
He has no idea that what has sprung up is a crime- and litter
-infested neighborhood.  After running into a transvestite prostitute,
which he diagnosis as a mutant dual-sexual, he retreats back
underground.  But supplies are running low, and Adam will be needed to
go out and find more.  He's armed with cash, valuable baseball cards,
and stock certificates.  But on a more personal note, he hopes to meet
up with a girl that isn't a mutant and that doesn't glow in the dark.
During his supply run, he meets up with unlucky-in-love Eve (Alicia
Silverstone).  Adam definitely needs some help.  Not at all familiar
with today's society, he hires Eve to help him track down the lengthy
list of supplies as well as be his guide and to keep him out of
trouble.  But he has some girl hunting to do too.  Eve agrees to help
him, and the film focuses on more than a few cute moments where
yesteryear's Adam has to insert himself into the world of today.  Most
of this material will elicit a grin or two, which is mostly because of
Frasier's affability.  He's cute and has an infectious smile.  But
there are some scenes that are really funny such as when they go to a
club to meet girls (called Club 40s where the music is nothing but
swing).  Watch as Adam uses his innocence to meet two gorgeous and
talented dancers.  They trip the lights fantastic while shivers of
jealously begin to run up and down Eve's spine.  Of course, the two
will eventually fall in love (with the names Adam and Eve, how could
they not?), and it's just a matter of time as they both try to
understand each other's world.  It's the standard fish out of water
story with some silliness, sweetness and some clever bits of
originality mixed in.  I was surprised by how likeable this film was.

Review for Shrek (2001)
Once upon a time, there existed a fierce rivalry
between two powerful animation production companies. 
One was called Pixar, owned by a juggernaut known as
Disney whose name has become synonymous with great
animation and storytelling.  The other was a feisty
little startup company known as Pacific Data Images,
headed by Dreamworks.
Their battle began a few years ago when Pixar released
"A Bug's Life" and then Dreamworks/PDI released soon
afterwards the similarly themed "ANTZ."  Both
companies showed that they were capable of ushering a
new era of animation technology and that the public
could look forward to further sparring in the form of
more ambitious releases.  And now with "Shrek",
Dreamworks/PDI has taken their rivalry to the next
level with a film that not only showcases incredible
animation but also pokes fun at the wonderful world of
Disney.
"Shrek" is a lively and disarmingly silly tale of a
misanthropic ogre (voiced by the gleeful Mike Myers
with a Scottish brogue).  He values his solitude, but
becomes especially distressed when fairy tale
creatures wind up in his private little swamp.  The
creatures explain that the mean Lord Farquaad (voiced
by the deliciously malevolent sounding John Lithgow)
has exiled them there.  Our green hero, joined by a
wise-cracking donkey named Donkey (Eddie Murphy),
leaves to seek out the evil nobleman in order to claim
back their land.
The story itself never approaches the level of awe
that we have for the animation, which incorporates an
added level of detail, light, and texture that has not
been seen before.  The verdancy of the forest and the
meadows that sway in the wind are truly incredible. 
Donkey looks amazingly lifelike with his furry
exterior and ears that reposition itself based on his
emotions.  Extended sequences such as a song and dance
number with Robin Hood and his very Merry Men and an
escape from a dragon's keep is nothing less than
impressive.
There's plenty here to entertain kids of all ages. 
Young ones will like the colorful characters while
older ones will be reminded of their precious youth
when they see the likes of the Gingerbread Man (who
proclaims "Eat Me" when being threatened by Farquaad),
the Seven Dwarves, the Three Blind Mice, and dozens of
others.  Meanwhile, there are lots of humorous moments
derived from references to pop culture (with spoofs of
The Dating Game, The Matrix, and the WWF), but it also
takes great pleasure in teasing the Disney company. 
For instance, Farquaad's city looks very much like the
Magic Kingdom with its parking lots, turnstiles, and
musical information kiosks.  
"Shrek," unfortunately, never musters enough strength
to tell an involved story.  While our lovable oaf
laments that he actually has a good heart and is just
misunderstood, develops affection for the rescued
Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz), and learns a
lesson about friendship and forgiveness, the ideas
seemed hollow.
"Shrek" seems more interested in dazzling us with its
animation and funny moments.  We are dazzled and we
laugh, but the cleverest moments occurred outside the
context of the plot.  More noteworthy animated films
such as "Toy Story", "Chicken Run", and Beauty and the
Beast easily outmatched this film's storytelling
muscle.  Regardless, this is a nice offering that will
undoubtedly leave a lasting impression in your mind.

Title
Review for I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998)
It's now the anniversary of the slayings of Julie James' (Jennifer
Love Hewitt) best friends.  Still besieged by nightmarish memories of
the man responsible for it all, she seems to be on the verge of a nervous
breakdown.  She can't concentrate on her schoolwork, can't get a good
night's sleep, and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking
strobe lights at a local dance club.  Everywhere she looks, she sees
visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand.
In the first movie, `I Know What You Did Last Summer', Julie and three
of her friends accidentally kill a man, running him down while driving
down a dark mountain highway.  To cover their misdeed, they dump the
body into the ocean.  However, he never quite died and returned to
hunt down Julie and her friends.  Julie and one other, Ray (Freddie
Prinze Jr.), survived only to make this dismal sequal.  Needing some
desparate rest and relaxation, she is elated to learn that her college
roommate, Karla (Brandy), has won a trip for four to a secluded
tropical island.  Accompanying these two girls are Karla's overbearing
boyfriend, Tyrell (Mehki Phifer) and a potential beau for Julie.   
But was this contest too good to be true?  The resort is filled with a
skeleton staff that seemed like Love Boat rejects.  Meanwhile, the
hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin. 
This presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will
have no possible means off the island.  Eventually, they will be
hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense
lightning storms.  As you might have guessed, somewhere in the shadows
lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker
and wielding a hook.   Julie tries to convince her friends that the
killer is on the island (an eerie touch is when she is singing "I Will
Survive" at the karaoke bar and the words scroll "I Still Know..."),
but her friends chalk it up to paranoia.  But the body count soon
starts to rise, and for Julie, it's going to be the worst vacation of
her life.
The funny (yes, I used the word 'funny') thing about this movie is
that I heard more chortling and giggling (maybe it was MY giggling)
than I heard screaming.  This movie boils down to a mindless slashfest
that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky
campiness.  There isn't even any suspense that leads up to the deaths.
 Here's an appropriate example.  Knock-Knock.  "Housekeeping", says
the diminuitive cleaning lady.  The door suddenly opens up.  SLASH. 
Next victim!  
Is there any reason to go and see this movie?  Not unless you want to
see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90
minutes.  But I do want to say one thing about this movie that
satisfied me.  I was thoroughly irritated with Tyrell, who incessantly
ranted and raved about his sexual libido.  I secretly  wished for him
to get filleted.  Did he get 'hooked'?  Well, let's just say that if
he didn't, I would give this film a grade of "D".  


Title
Review for Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)
A British naval ship is engaged in a confrontation with Chinese jet
fighters.  The Chinese insist that the British ship is in Chinese
waters.  The Captain of the ship adamantly states that they are in
international waters, warning that they will defend themselves.  In
the next few tense minutes, the ship begins to sink while one of the
Chinese fighters is destroyed.  Who was in the wrong?  Both nations
begin to prepare for possible war.  Can this volatile situation be
resolved?  British intelligence believes that media mogul, Elliot
Carver (Jonathan Pryce) may have something to do with this, and they
send their best man to investigate.  
Pierce Brosnan is back, and once again handsomely fills the shoes of
James Bond, agent 007 of Her Majesty's Secret Service.  We learn that
Bond once had a relationship with Carver's present wife, Paris (Teri
Hatcher), and is tartly instructed to get reacquainted and to 'pump'
her for information.  Such double entendres is one of the trademarks
of Bond films, and you'll find no shortage here.  The 007 formula also
incorporates a well-choreographed, beginning action sequence; a bevy
of techno-gadgets such as a remote-controlled BMW 750IL; several
frenetic chase sequences; and a charismatic villain with delusions of
grandeur.
The James Bond franchise, to its credit, as been updated to a great
degree.  In this case, the villain is not some would-be terrorist, but
rather a media magnate that wants to launch a worldwide media network.
His avenue of achieving global dominance is not through weapons of
mass destruction but rather instruments of mass information.  Using
his resources, Carver will create the storylines and then subsequently
use his media to sway public opinion. "Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon had his armies, and I have my divisions--TV, newspapers [and
other media]," he gloats.  It's a very clever concept.  Also, the
women are a lot stronger and tougher.  M, Bond's female superior, is a
tireless boss that is stern but compassionate.  Accused by a male
counterpart of not having the 'balls' to make a tough decision, she
candidly replies, "at least I don't have to think with them."  Paris
Carver is able to find a soft spot in Bond's cavalier exterior.  But
the best addition is a little firecracker by the name of Michelle
Yeoh.  As a cool-headed agent from China, she uses her formidable
martial arts skills and intelligence to move forward in her mission,
which parallels that of 007.
The one thing that I found distracting about this and most Bond films
is the issue of product placements.  For example, when Q shows Bond
his new remote-controlled BMW, I was waiting for him to start
discussing lease terms.  In fact, I was amazed that I didn't see
Jonathan Pryce driving away in an Infiniti!  Also, there seems to be
less humor and a subtle shift towards the realm of conventional
techno-thrillers.  007 is becoming a more responsible Bond, straying
away somewhat from his tongue-in-cheek origins.  But moviegoers who
have come to expect lots of action and cool toys won't be
disappointed.  The most inventive scene is a nifty chase, where Bond
is in the back seat of his BMW guiding his car via remote control
through a parking garage.  Using a touch pad, he steers and deploys
his arsenal of weapons at the same time, laughing all the way like
some giddy schoolboy.  That is the essence of bond.  That's what makes
him fun to watch.

Review for Moulin Rouge! (2001)
Summer's most impressive visual spectacle has hit the
theatres.  But in this film, you won't find squadrons
of bombers or capsizing battleships.  Instead, you'll
find a rhapsodic presentation that evokes the great
Hollywood musicals of the 50s with sets that burst
with vivid color, production numbers as showy as any
Broadway spectacular, and a kinetic pace that patterns
itself after hip MTV videos.  And beneath all of this
pomp, you'll also find a moving story about "truth,
beauty, freedom, and love."
In the revisionist film, `Moulin Rouge,' story and
song boldly come together in a film about a tragic
love affair between penniless writer Christian (Ewan
McGregor) and beautiful courtesan Satine (Nicole
Kidman).  These two meet at the fabled nightclub
Moulin Rouge, where fantasies power its atmosphere of
glitz and opulence.  But when you return from your
state of euphoria, reality is hurtfully cold.
No character is caught up more in this state of
fantasy than the naive Christian, whom after
befriending dwarf artist Toulouse-Lautrec (John
Leguizamo), is given the rare opportunity to meet
Satine.  This encounter makes his heart sing,
literally.  He croons a love song to her delight ("I
can see you're going to be bad for business," she
says) but perhaps to the ambivalence of the audience. 
Actually, McGregor, Kidman and the cast members can
all competently carry a tune, but their renditions
lacked brassiness or distinction.  At other times,
such as when our couple sings a medley of love songs
to one another, the exercise seemed nauseatingly
silly.  Indeed some of the musical numbers bordered on
kitsch (like the sales pitch set to the tune of the
Can-Can to persuade a financier to invest) while other
numbers seemed forced just for the sake of song.  Yet,
many selections were quite impressive and easily
acquitted itself of this complaint such as the opening
and closing numbers and a dark Tango set to Sting's
"Roxanne."  
Christian's state of euphoria may soon come to an end
when he discovers that the investor (Richard Roxburgh)
who agrees to finance his latest play also wants
exclusivity to Satine.  If she does not agree, then he
shall also seize the property.  Harold (Jim
Broadbent), impresario and owner, asks her to hurt him
for the sake of everyone involved.  "We are creatures
of the underworld," he laments.  "We can not afford to
love."  
But their bond is unbreakable, which leaves our
flustered paterfamilias making up brilliant lies when
the investor begins to doubt her commitment.  A
terrific musical moment occurs when Harold explains to
him that Satine has cancelled her date because she has
gone to confessional and then breaks into Madonna's
"Like a Virgin."  His character is by far the most
enjoyable of the cast.
While we gladly accept the songs and take interest in
the love story, what really holds our attention,
however, is the film's camerawork and inventive
visualizations.  The film's images frenetically
display the pageantry of turn-of-the century Paris
during the period when avant-garde artistry was at its
heyday.  The extravagant production ably captures its
festive mood, from the tuxedo-clad clientele reveling
at the nightclub to the melodramatic characters to a
scene where our wildly-in-love couple dances on a
cloud while serenaded by the moon.  It's a fantasy of
which we should all be a part.

Review for Three Kings (1999)
There's a terrific scene when George Clooney describes
what happens when a person gets shot.  The worst part,
he says, isn't even the pain that is felt when the
bullet enters the body.  It's what happens afterwards,
as the bullet fragment completely wreaks havoc to the
body's internal organs.  An unseen chain reaction
begins to happen, and its ultimate effect is far
graver than anything that can actually be seen.  
This scene is especially appropriate to the backdrop
of the story, which takes place just after the end of
Operation Desert Storm.  While many soldiers happily
accepted their mission to 'liberate Kuwait' from Iraqi
occupation, they didn't necessarily know or understand
the ramifications of their actions.  When the American
bullet pierced the body of Iraq, damage was done in
ways that the allied forces probably never knew about.
 Why might that be?  Probably it was because we fought
such a high-tech war that, for a large part of it,
soldiers never even had to leave their bases. With
America's vast array of spying equipment and arsenal
of missiles that could accurately hit a stop sign on
any street corner, Desert Storm was very much a
faceless war.
"The Three Kings" is a fine film about a small group
of soldiers who venture out beyond where most soldiers
have gone during Operation Desert Storm and see things
that others never did.  When an Iraqi prisoner of war
is searched, a map is found that shows where the Iraqi
government has hidden millions in stolen Kuwaiti
bullion.  But instead of reporting it, the soldiers
decide to fetch the gold for themselves.  Troy Barlow
(Mark Wahlberg) will risk his life because he's a new
father and the money will come in handy.  Chief (Ice
Cube) wants to be a part of it because he feels that
God has put the gold within his reach for a reason. 
And Archie Gates, a Special Forces soldier (George
Clooney) is strictly motivated by greed.  Also along
for the ride is Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze), an extremely
naďve boy who idolizes Barlow and wants to see some
combat action.  They don't tell their superiors what
they are about to do and also must dodge an
inquisitive and news-hungry reporter at the base (Nora
Dunn).  But the plan is simple.  Locate the bunker
with the gold, enter the bunker, take the gold, and
leave.  By claiming that they were sent to retrieve
the gold, the Iraqi guards will probably ignore them
while they load up.  
As they are about to leave with their booty, they see
that Iraqi soldiers have shot an innocent woman.  She
is one of many citizens who are doing what they can to
rise up (as President Bush urged at the end of the
war) against the current regime.  Other villagers will
undoubtedly be executed.  A tense standoff between
American and Iraqi soldiers occurs.  `Stick to the
plan,' yells Barlow.  But Gates has made up his mind. 
He can't let these people be slaughtered.  He decides
to help them, an act that greatly risks his military
standing, all of the gold, and even his life.
Like all good war films, the story that drives the
movie is not about war, but rather the moral
implications that arise as a result of it.  `Three
Kings' makes no effort to hide its strong political
undercurrents and clearly has something to say about
how we handled our involvement.  There are terrific
moments of truth and observation.  At the same time,
it shows how war is truly Hell.  The sunlight has been
bleached into an almost hallucinatory effect. 
Meanwhile gun battles are presented in slow motion to
make it shocking rather than some visceral display of
pyrotechnics.  And thanks to strong performances from
the cast, the film continually brims with enthusiasm,
energy and intelligence.  Korea had M*A*S*H, and
Vietnam had Platoon.  Now, the Gulf War has `Three
Kings.'

Review for Rush Hour 2 (2001)
What has fueled the excitement around "RH2"? 
Arguably, the team of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan is
the best cop/buddy combo since those guys from "Lethal
Weapon."  Summer moviegoers are looking for a fun
time, which is almost guaranteed when you watch either
of these two flamboyant stars.  And, the first "RH"
was so much fun that you can't help but have high
expectations for this one.
With expectations as high as a mountain, it's almost
impossible for a movie to overcome this kind of
barrier.  And this one can't, falling short on laughs
and defining moments.  In fact, many will think that
the most memorable moments were the outtakes at the
film's end and the cameo by actor Don Cheadle who
speaks Cantonese and displays the Tiger Claw fighting
style.
But the film is not all bad thanks to Chris Tucker,
who as Detective James Carter, is the life of the
party.  In the film's first act, he's in Hong Kong
visiting his old pal, Inspector Lee (Chan).  However,
Lee is always on the job and is currently trying to
solve a recent bombing, suspected to have been carried
out by Ricky Tan (John Lone), a notorious Triad gang
leader.  
Carter just wants to have a good time, and when he
whoops it up at a Karaoke bar, Lee begs him to remain
incognito for this is where Triad gang members tend to
hang out.  However, you just can't shut him up.  "I'm
from LA; we invented gangs," he says.  Turning to the
crowd, he screeches, "All the Triads and the ugly
women on the left side, all the f-f-i-i-i-n-e women on
the right side."  Tucker's brassy demeanor, his
down-with-it attitude and his cluelessness about the
culture and the language make him hilarious to watch.
Unfortunately, after the first 30 minutes, our duo
leaves Hong Kong and all the fun behind.  The
investigation leads them to Los Angeles and Las Vegas
where it's Chan's turn to play the fish-out-of-water. 
But, he looks uncomfortable when speaking English and
doesn't possess Tucker's insouciance.  Chan seemed
statelier and more at ease in the first "RH."  His
role was more dramatic in nature, and he didn't have
to speak too much English.  This film lightheartedly
acknowledges Chan's broken English when he asks,
"don't you understand the words that are coming out of
my mouth?"  Tucker replies disgustedly, "don't nobody
understand the words coming out your mouth!"  Even the
outtakes show many scenes where Chan is trying to
force his English lines.
Also missing are the great stuntwork and fight
sequences that are hallmarks of Chan's work.  The only
good sequence occurs early on where Chan goes against
a cadre of gangsters atop rickety scaffolding several
stories above.  But the other sequences seemed tepid
or looked cartoonish.
"RH2" is only marginally fun to watch while short on
drama.  Yet, it received so much press and hype that
it succeeded in grossing over $69 million in its
opening weekend.  This is an incredible
accomplishment!  And considering the fact that August
is the slowest of summer movie months (the previous
opening record in August was "Sixth Sense" which took
in about $27 mil.), moviegoers couldn't wait to see
Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker reunite.  But what's the
hurry?  "RH2" felt kinda slow.

Review for Talented Mr. Ripley, The (1999)
If you've seen or heard some of the nominations from
various film critic societies around the country, then
you probably know that this movie has been mentioned
for a couple of reasons.  Many applaud the gorgeous
cinematography and the strong performances of the
cast.  Even within my esteemed group of online film
critics (The Online Film Critics Society), there is
general agreement that `Mr. Ripley' should be
remembered when Oscar nominations are announced.  Yet,
while the buzz surrounding this film is generally
good, I'm actually puzzled as to why this film is
getting so much praise.  My feelings for this film are
decidedly mixed, although it's one of the best-looking
average movies I've seen this year.
Mr. Ripley of the title is Thomas Ripley (Damon), a
person who seems to be skilled in many areas although
he works as a bathroom attendant.  For example, he can
speak in other people's voices with alarming accuracy.
 And, he's a pretty good pianist.  After a particular
recital, a man approaches him.  The man sees that
Ripley is wearing a Princeton-emblazoned jacket.  He
asks if he graduated from Princeton and if he knows
his son, Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), since they are
the same age.  Of course he is just a lowly attendant
and the jacket is borrowed, but to hide his true
identity, he says yes.   The man, who is a shipping
magnate, hires Ripley to travel to Italy where Dickie
currently lives.  His task is to convince him to come
home.
Dickie is quite a character.  He has tons of charisma,
which is in part to his good looks, his elite taste,
and his wealth as the son of a shipping magnate. 
Dickie's world is tremendously lavish.  He has a
terrific, hilltop bungalow.  He spends his afternoons
on his sailboat.  And he frequents the best clubs in
town.  Ripley arrives and manages to successfully
blend into Dickie's life and meet some of Dickie's
friends.  These include fiancée Marge (Gwyneth
Paltrow) and, a well-connected partygoer (Phillip
Seymour Hoffman).  Up this point, which is about 45
minutes into the movie, I am really enjoying how
Dickie's and Ripley's friendship are evolving.  But
all of a sudden, Dickie and Ripley don't see
eye-to-eye anymore.  Dickie becomes bored with Ripley.
 And Ripley doesn't want to give up this newly
acquired lifestyle.  At about this point, the film
moves away from being a glossy drama, and becomes
decidedly dark and inexplicably bloody.  It was as if
the film started out in one direction, and then made a
sharp right turn.  
Any praise for this film should be directed at Damon's
nice performance and the terrific cinematography.  The
film takes place in wonderful locations throughout
Italy.  The camera skillfully catches the romance and
beauty of beach towns, the awesome architecture of
Rome, and the quaintness of other small villages.  It
was certainly enough to make me want to visit Italy
sometime in the future.  Every scene is handsomely
shot while the sets are opulent, and certainly would
make many of us envy the Dickie Greenleaf lifestyle. 
But despite all that it strives to be, the beauty of
the film was only skin deep.  
As I left the theatre, I was reminded of a recent film
called `A Perfect Murder.'  Ironically, it also
starred Gwyneth Paltrow as a distressed woman who
suspects that foul play is in the air.  That
production was undeniably glossy, and the performances
were solid.  But, it felt oddly empty.  `Mr. Ripley'
is slightly glossier and has slightly better
all-around performances.  Yet, it still felt oddly
unsatisfying.  I think that the problem is that once
the film abruptly changes direction, the audience's
expectations have been ruined.  And that's too bad,
because the outset of the film oozed with potential.

Title
Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
"Erin Brokovich" is the kind of terrific storytelling
that does two things.  First, it renews my faith in
the good neighbor.  These are the unsung heroes that
toil endlessly on behalf of others.  Their payment
comes from the personal satisfaction of righting a
previous wrong.  They buck the system, overcome
daunting obstacles, and move forward with unbridled
determination in order to see that justice is served. 
But "Erin Brokovich" also renews my faith in
Hollywood's ability to make a nice old-fashioned film.
 Its subject is grounded in the real world and
presents a feel-good story that anyone can appreciate.
 I salute people like Erin Brokovich, and I salute the
filmmakers for having the wherewithal to bring her
story to the big screen.  Based on the real life story
of Erin Brokovich, this movie focuses on her
tribulations as a struggling single mom, and later,
her personal crusade in which she takes on a large
utilities company that she suspects of releasing toxic
pollutants.  
Life has truly dealt Erin, a former beauty queen, an
endless series of disappointments.  She has almost as
many ex-husbands as she does children.  With only a
high school diploma, she lacks the professional
business and communications skills to get a job.  She
can't even win an accident claim in which she was
clearly not at fault.  With the bills starting to pile
up, she convinces Ed Masry (Albert Finney), the lawyer
that bungled her aforementioned accident claim, to let
her take on a low-paying filing position.
Her reserved office mates, however, don't appreciate
her saucy and straight shooting personality.  She
dresses in an equally saucy manner, and as a result,
her relationship with the others is charged.  Never
afraid to speak her mind, her audacity presents a
serious challenge to the stodgy Masry.  "Maybe you
should rethink your manner of dress," he offers.  Erin
shoots back, "Maybe you should rethink your ties." 
However, the one great asset that she possesses is her
empathy towards their clients.  She feels their pain,
understands their needs, and embodies a rare
compassion.  "I hate lawyers; I just work for them,"
she says to those who are wary of her intentions. 
Additionally, she's smart, resourceful, and isn't
afraid to get her hands dirty.  
When she does a little extra research into a land
deal, she discovers that the activities of a nearby
utilities plant may be responsible for the failing
health of hundreds of local residents.  Erin is
devastated to learn that the long-term effects have
had horrific results, from nosebleeds to cancer.  She
is convinced that they should sue the utilities giant
on behalf of all of those who have suffered.  But
Masry, now in his 60s and comfortable with his small
practice, is naturally concerned about engaging in
such a case.  "We're not just David going against
Goliath, says the flustered lawyer.  "We're going
against Goliath and his whole family."  
Through Erin's hard work and devotion, there is
significant emotional payoff.  It's quite an
accomplishment for Erin to achieve what she does given
her situation and limited resources.  It's also quite
an accomplishment for Julia Roberts to capture the
heart, courage, and fears of Erin's crusade. 
Showcasing her dramatic talent and her wonderful sense
of comic timing, this is Roberts' richest role to date
and perhaps the richest female performance since
Hillary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry".  Finney is also
terrifically likable as a lawyer that tries to counter
Erin's zeal with conventionality and wisdom.  I also
credit the filmmakers for not succumbing to
Hollywood-esque plots.  In a dumber version, there
probably would have been a contrived, life-threatening
situation as Erin uncovered more damaging evidence
against the utilities.  And, I'm glad that the film
doesn't go the route of an extended courtroom
sequence.  The movie smartly stays focused on Erin's
pain, passion and personal ascension.

Review for Cats & Dogs (2001)
Thinking about dogs, this image comes to mind.  Our
stately friend plays with your child in the backyard,
happy to chase balls and sticks.  He sits on a
windowsill to bark at strangers and mailmen.  He roams
the neighborhood and marks his territory.  However, in
the cleverly presented family film, "Cats & Dogs," we
learn that these animals are not just family pets that
run happily through idyllic, suburban yards.  Most of
their actions revolve around reconnaissance.  And what
are they on the lookout for?  The answer is cats, who
grow continually resentful that dogs are man's best
friend and not them.
It's a dog-eat-dog world out there and only the
strongest species can claim their spot next to humans.
 Cats and dogs have been locked in a never-ending
struggle since time immemorial.  So intense are their
military tactics that dogs work from a secret base at
the center of the earth with technology that rivals
the headquarters of any James Bond film and, perhaps,
even the Pentagon.  Cats are equally well-equipped. 
In some of the wackier sequences, ninja cats come
prowling along with night vision goggles while another
evil feline spy coughs up hairballs that hide grenades
and other devices.
The current battlefield involves the Brody house.  The
father (Jeff Goldblum) is an eccentric scientist who
is on the verge of a major breakthrough.  If
successful, he could eradicate allergic reaction to
dogs.  This is very threatening for cats who visualize
more dog lovers in the world as a result.  The evil
cat, Mr. Tinkles (voice of Sean Hayes), has a
nefarious plan of his own.  Steal the formula, alter
its composition, and then use it to make humans
deathly allergic to dogs.  
Assigned to guard the Brody home is Lou (voiced by
Tobey Maguire), a cute beagle puppy guaranteed to
elicit several 'awws' from the audience.  Lou actually
winds up there as a result of a mix-up.  Yet despite
his inexperience, Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin), a
regal shepherd dog and weathered secret agent, quickly
brings him up to speed.  For much of the film, these
two and other various dog agents fend off increasingly
ambitious encroachments by the cats.
Also of note are the special effects.  The animals
bear expressions that are incredibly human and the
lips move in perfect unison to the words being spoken.
 To bring this film to life, state-of-the-art
techniques combine real animals with puppets and
computer-generated effects.  The realism is
impressive.
You may see these common house pets and think that
spying dogs and scheming cats are absurd.  But if you
think about it, dogs would make great agents.  With
their acute hearing, heightened senses, speed, and
bravery, dogs could accomplish many unique tasks. 
It's also easy to picture Mr. Tinkles as the
supervillain.  I am reminded of a movie villain named
Blofeld (a recurring nemesis of early James Bond
films) who always held this type of cat in his lap. 
Maybe this cat will succeed where Blofeld failed.  Mr.
Tinkles has a deadpan, capricious demeanor and is as
demented as he is funny.
A better family film along this genre is "Spy Kids." 
That film had more energy.  However, children will
love the talking animals and adults should find enough
humor to keep them from getting bored throughout the
87-minute running time.  Like cats and dogs, this film
is nice to have around.

Title
Review for Rat Race (2001)
Over the past decade or so, Director Jerry Zucker's
name has become synonymous with over-the-top comedies.
 He brought us "Airplane" in the 80s and "The Naked
Gun" in the 90s.  Thoroughly silly yet frequently
funny, these screwball comedies provided audiences
with a bellyful of giggles through snappy dialogue and
a flood of sight gags.  In his latest effort, "Rat
Race," we see that he still knows how to, more or
less, appeal to our childish sense of humor.  White it
isn't as hilarious or as inspired as his previous
work, you'll still find something that will make you
grin. 
You might smile at its crude sense of humor, such as
when a courier who is transporting a human heart
becomes overly curious about his cargo.  You might
giggle at the women who pose as models in order to
steal a land-racer.  And, it's hard not to laugh at
the inane sequence involving an out-of-control car, a
runaway hot-air balloon, and a cow.  I'll just leave
that up to your own imagination.  One can only imagine
what THAT storyboard must have looked like.
These poor souls (and several others) wind up in such
absurd situations because of a bizarre race in which
they are competing.  Sponsored by an unctuous tycoon
(John Cleese with teeth like a piano keyboard), he
furnishes competitors with locker keys.  Starting in
Las Vegas, everyone is told to make their way to a
tiny train station in Silver City, NM where it will
open up a locker.  There, they shall find a duffel bag
containing $2 million, and the first to reach it will
win it all.  Why does he do this?  As he explains, "I
can do anything.  I'm eccentric!" 
"Rat Race" features an ensemble of fairly well-known
actors who all get a chance to flex their comedic
muscles.  Most spirited and particularly funny was
Rowan Atkinson who is bug-eyed, walks around flailing
his gangly arms, and seems like he's desperately
emulating Roberto Benigni.  He's obviously the most
gung ho of the bunch.  Sadly, he's narcoleptic and
falls asleep at the most inopportune moments.  Also
likeable was Cuba Gooding Jr., who is forced to steal
a chartered bus filled with Lucille Ball look-alikes. 
When the bus trip begins to experience a few hiccups
and the scores of impersonators wail out the Lucy cry
of "Waaaaahhhhh," not only is it hilarious (for those
who are familiar with "I Love Lucy") but you'll
develop a newfound respect for chartered bus drivers. 
In another memorable segment, thanks to great comic
timing by Jon Lovitz, you would have never known that
Adolph Hitler could be so funny.  The silliness of
this film actually grows on you, and it's a nice
diversion from the recent spate of gross-out comedies.
"Rat Race" works best when the sight gags are in
progress.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of down time.
 For example, the first 30 minutes is just a drawn out
introduction of the eventual racers.  Who cares about
that when the film is all about the wild situations? 
Meanwhile, the ending takes an absurd detour away from
its beloved sense of madcapped buffonery and veers
towards an ill-advised attempt at a schmaltzy,
feel-good ending.  If you want to participate in "Rat
Race," come late, leave early, and enjoy the ride.

Title
Review for Big Daddy (1999)
This is the third movie that I've seen with Saturday Night Alumni Adam
Sandler, the other two being `The Wedding Singer' and `The Waterboy.' 
And having moderately enjoyed his last two offerings, I can say that
the one thing that really works for him is that he does well in stories
where he plays a simple-minded-underachieving-doofus-turned-hero.  When
he plays the gentle soul who occasionally releases his bottled-up
feelings of frustration, we can laugh at those minor eruptions.  And we
can generally laugh at his clueless demeanor and the way that he sort
of just lucks into the happy ending.  These ingredients are what give
Adam Sander the power to turn meaningless fluff into comedic,
blues-chasing films.  However, none of that happens in this film.  And
the result is a generally lifeless film that Sandler just doesn't have
the talent to save.  
Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, an underachieving jerk who is living off
the money won through a lawsuit.  Though he seems to possess some kind
of underlying intelligence, he has no concept of responsibility and
would rather spend his time displaying his skewed pathological
behavior, such as screaming at fast food clerks and throwing branches
in the path of oncoming inline skaters.  His lackadaisical attitude
prompts his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) to leave him, telling him to
grow up.  He needs a quick-fix solution.  Amazingly, a lost waif shows
up at his doorstep.  His name is Julian and he is in search of his Dad
who may be Sonny's roommate (played by Jon Stewart).   Well, his
roommate is travelling, and Sonny, in his infinite wisdom, decides to
keep him as his own son.  He supposes that this decision will teach him
responsibility.  His decision will also prove that the rest of this
movie will amount to the entertainment value of 3AM diaper changes.
As a parent, Sonny should be reported to social services.  When Julian
requests a night light, Sonny brings him a neon sign that says `Live
Nudes.'  When Julian wets his bed, Sonny cover the wet areas with
newspaper and then places Julian on top.  And what fatherly things does
Sonny teach to his child?  Among other things, they include fielding
hard-hit baseballs, learning how to spit in a most disgusting manner,
and peeing on sides of buildings whenever it is convenient.  Sandler is
just trying to have fun with this material, but the more I thought
about Sonny being a father to Julian, the more appalled I became.
In `Big Daddy,' Sandler can't take the reigns of the material, which
deserves more weight.  The material was weak to begin with, and I think
that Sandler knew that.  To compensate, there are other components of
this film.  We meet up with an introspective homeless man (Steve
Buscemi who probably did this as a favor to Sandler) and are introduced
to two college buddies who are openly gay (if you are offended by two
men lustfully kissing, close your eyes upon seeing them for the first
time).  We also meet his roommate's girlfriend who was a former Hooters
girl.  The unfunny Hooters jokes go on and on and after a while, I was
really surprised that she just didn't shoot Sandler.  The only sane
element was Sandler's new girlfriend, Layla (Joey Lauren Adams).  Too
little too late.  The film finally reaches the epitome of discomfort at
the finale, which involves a court scene where Sonny tries to convince
everyone that he is a worthy father.  Perhaps a court will sentence
this to a quick trip to the video store.


Title
Review for Keeping the Faith (2000)
`Keeping the Faith' is a charming and entertaining
romantic comedy about friendship, fellowship, and
forgiveness.  The warmth that emanates from this film
lies within its message of
love-one-another-and-love-thyself.'  But the real
appeal stems from the sunniness radiated by cast
members Ed Norton, Ben Stiller, and Jenna Elfman who
play three old friends that reunite and who become
funnily entangled in a love triangle.
Brian Finn (Ed Norton) and Jake Schram (Ben Stiller)
have been close friends since the 8th grade, and as
they grew up, they answered similar callings.  Brian
becomes a priest while Jake grows up to become a
rabbi.  Things are going well for the both of them. 
They are now powerful spiritual leaders in their New
York West Side community.  Affectionately known as the
`God Squad,' these two give sermons in front of
standing-room-only audiences. 
One of Brian's and Jake's fondest memories was that of
Anna Reilly, another 8th grader who was the coolest
and hippest girl that they had ever known.  She had
moved away that year, but is now returning to New York
for a job.  Anna is all grown up now. She's a single,
sexy, business professional.  The three reunite and
they are enraptured by her indomitable wit and erotic
power.  
She's a tremendously busy woman who has no time for a
relationship.  She's great at what she does, but she
works 100 hours a week and misses the emotional
satisfaction of being touched and held.  Yet, she
doesn't say this as some kind of empty confession. 
There's a soft smile and an inviting wink that
accompanies her statement.  Perhaps she's developed an
attraction for either Brian or Jake.  This development
creates a problematic situation.  As friends, it
causes an awkward tension.  Even worse, Anna's
magnetism is taxing Brian's vows of celibacy while
Jake realizes that dating someone outside his faith
would jeopardize his standing among his congregates. 
This issue is made all the more salient by Jake's mom
(Anne Bancroft) who seems adamant against interfaith
marriages.  When their desires finally play out, we
can only hope that these three lifelong friends will
continue to remain close because they are so likeable.
The movie also provides additional comical nuggets of
the two clerics' lives.  The beginning sequence charts
Brian's and Jake's earlier days with their houses of
worship.  We laugh when Jake faints during a
circumcision or when Brian accidentally sets his
cassock on fire.  Another funny sequence involves a
shopping trip for a karaoke machine.  The salesperson
uses every dishonorable tactic to get them to buy the
machine, unaware that he's lying to a man of God. 
There's also an ongoing story about the elder Jewish
women in Jake's congregate, who continually try to
introduce him to their daughters.  One introduction
results in the date from Hell.  Upon arriving back at
her apartment in a taxi, she openly invites Jake
inside and tells the taxi driver to leave.  He seems
very afraid but when she becomes overly insistent,
Jake virtually has to push his aggressive date onto
the sidewalk as he frantically commands the taxi
driver to leave as quickly as possible.   
The real surprise of the film is Jenna Elfman, the
star of TV's `Dharma and Greg.'  I've never seen her
television show, but I'll be sure to make an effort
now.  To watch her is to love her.  The success of the
drama rests squarely on her shoulders, but she
effortlessly rises to the occasion.  Her portrayal was
pleasing, balancing coltish femininity with a hint of
loneliness.  Meanwhile, Norton and Stiller are equally
affable.  The film moves along at a good pace and
there are plenty of lighthearted moments to keep the
audience smiling.  `Keeping the Faith' is a sweet film
that showcases cheery performances, a likeable cast,
and a sustained comical energy.

Review for Return to Paradise (1998)
How much would you be willing to sacrifice for someone that you hardly
knew?  For my family and closest of friends, I'm sure that I'd sacrifice
everything I could to help them.  But I'm not so sure that I could say
the same if the person in question was just some casual acquaintance.
Sheriff (Vince Vaughn) and Tony (David Conrad) are faced with that same
moral dilemma.  Two years ago, these two and Lou (Joaqin Phoenix) met as
vacationers in Malaysia.  They spent their days and nights picking up as
many women as possible, drinking as much beer as possible, and smoking
as much hashish as possible since it's so easy to buy and inexpensive
too.  A few days after Sheriff and Tony left, the police raided the
bungalow and found Lou and all of the leftover hashish.  Because of the
excessive amounts found, Lou was charged with trafficking, which carries
a sentence of death.
Sheriff and Tony find out about this after they are located by Lou's
attorney, Beth (Anne Heche).  With only 8 days left until Lou's
execution, Beth explains to them that she has struck a deal with the
Malaysian magistrate.  If one or both goes back to share the
responsibility and serve jail time, Lou's life will be spared.  Tony has
a beautiful fiancée, a promising life, and a heart of gold.  He
tentatively agrees to go back if Sheriff will too.  However, the burly
Sheriff who has always been reckless and careless can not find it within
him to go back.  And both voice extreme reservations about their chances
of survival given that the prison system is fraught with disease,
malnutrition, and guards that randomly torture the inmates.  With time
running out, Beth must find a way to change their minds.
Beth's task is enormous.  She delicately walks a fine line between
promoting the courage behind the deed and moral blackmail.  All the
while, she is also being hounded by a hungry reporter that threatens the
stability of her deal.  I liked Heche's performance.  She remained
focused and I liked the way her character tried to read every emotion in
order to figure out the next mode of approach.  She's sincere but also
scheming at the same time.  Another nice element was the questionable
attraction that Heche develops for Sheriff.  Is this just one of her
plays?  Already in a situation mired with ambiguity, this further
complicates Sheriff's life as the loner slowly learns the meaning of
compassion.
Despite the good performances and the pungent atmosphere, I somehow
wished that this film would have been more compelling.  As pure drama,
this film delivers, but my reservation lies within the fact that the
storyline was too cerebral in nature.  I would have preferred something
more visceral.  I would have liked a closer examination of the Malaysian
government's view on drug trafficking or would have liked to have seen
the brutal environment of the prisons.  I think that with that added
sensation, this movie might have been more memorable.  Nonetheless,
Heche's worthy performance and good supporting roles merit a
recommendation.

Review for Big Hit, The (1998)
Here is a movie that sadly follows the Hong Kong-recipe of moviemaking
and storytelling to the letter.  These kinds of movies are marked by an
eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters; a
life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved; the
inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters; ridiculous subplots,
and sunglass-wearing henchmen.  That is not to say that I don't like
Hong Kong influenced movies; however, it is quite obvious that these
moviemakers haven't a clue that the American filmgoer needs more than
hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags.
Observe the opening sequence.  A band of hitmen are about to storm an
apartment, led by Melvin (Mark Wahlberg) and Cisco (Lou Diamond
Phillips).  They are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so
that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles.
However, their partner is unsure of which cable to cut.  He is
undecided.  This happens for about 10 seconds.  The audience finds some
humor in his foolishness.  The lights suddenly go out.  Cisco is
surprised and says: "Whoa...let's go!"  And they storm the apartment in
a very nicely executed sequence.
The Big Hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter
of the way through the film.  Needing cash, Cisco devises a plan to
kidnap the daughter (China Chow) of wealthy Japanese industrialist Jiro
Nishi.  However, the daughter is also the god-daughter of Paris (Avery
Brooks), who is Cisco's and Melvin's boss.  Infuriated and insufferable,
Paris commands Cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping.
During his 'investigation', Cisco singles out Melvin as the ringleader,
and Paris orders his capture and execution.  Melvin must now find a way
to stay alive.
By the way, do you know how the investigation takes place?  Cisco's
partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be
traced because of a Trace Buster that prevents tracing.  But, Mr. Nishi
has a Trace Buster Buster.  To counter that, Cisco's partner has a Trace
Buster Buster Buster.  But Nishi has a Trace Buster Buster Buster
Buster.  And so on...
There is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live.
And there are lots of issues that we'd like to know more about.  How
does Melvin justify his profession to his fiancee?  What goes on among
this clique?  Why is Cisco at odds with Melvin?  There is actually a lot
of potential material that could have been explored, but it seems that
no effort is made to go in that direction, and instead we are given a
not-so-engrossing plot filled with one-liners, silly sight gags,
extraneous sub-plots and tomfoolery.
And, I haven't even mentioned his financee's visiting parents who want
them to separate, nor Melvin's mistress, nor the pimple-faced video
clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on.  If
The Big Hit signals the future of Hong Kong style movies that are made
for American audiences, then shoot me now.

Review for What Planet Are You From? (2000)
"Planet" is so bad, it's actually kind of funny.  I'm
not recommending this film, but in the right frame of
mind (the frame of mind that develops after a couple
of beers), this might actually be an acceptable 90
minute diversion.  There is a gentle sweetness that
resides deep beneath the film's core.  But be warned -
even Forrest Gump would find this movie dumb. 
"Planet's" premise is about an advanced world that is
populated by only men.  Led by the stonefaced Ben
Kingsley, this race has bred out emotions and has even
evolved beyond the need for genitalia.  Their agenda
involves conquering other worlds not through
interstellar battle, but through a more subversive
method of breeding.  One man (Garry Shandling) will be
sent to Earth to begin colonization.  He'll be
'equipped' with the right tool to carry out his task. 
And to prepare for his encounter with Earth women, he
is trained to say all the right things.  But just what
are the right things to say?  And even more pressing,
how will the organ-deprived alien accomplish his
mission of impregnating some unsuspecting Earth woman?
 The answers set the pace of this wry comedy, which
for better or worse, will undoubtedly make you roll
your eyes and groan with chagrin.  
To prep Shandling, one lesson teaches him to nod in
approval and say 'uh-huh' when a female is talking. 
Another lesson teaches him to start conversations with
pick-up lines.  He says things like "Can I have your
autograph.  You ARE Miss America, aren't you?" (this
is where we roll our eyes and groan).  Of course,
Earth girls aren't easy, and this baffles our alien to
no end.  Shandling's perpetual look of childlike
indecisiveness suits him well here.  He represents the
common man who is ill-prepared to meet women.  The
other comedic element focuses on his organ-deprived
body.  Genitalia is attached to his body (there is no
male frontal nudity), but when he gets in the mood,
there is this disconcerting humming noise that begins.
 This joke is revisited countless times, and now we're
rolling our eyes and groaning again.  
Certainly, his task is not an easy one.  He's armed
with lame pick-up lines, has a humming problem,
becomes friends with a selfish scoundrel (Greg
Kinnear) and eventually attracts the attention of a
government official (John Goodman) who believes that
he's not quite of this planet.  The audience's task of
staying the course is no less daunting.  The movie
finally picks up a bit with the introduction of
Annette Benning as a recovering alcoholic who has been
completely unlucky in love.  But by this time, the
original premise has run out of ideas, and the movie
switches gears and becomes an awkward lesson about the
fears of commitment and responsibility.
"Planet" could have been a much funnier movie.  It
needed to focus more on the man-versus-woman foibles
rather than shifting the focus to the less funny issue
of commitment.  Still, the movie itself is not
terrible, and admittedly, it made me chuckle a few
times when I wasn't rolling my eyes.  If nothing else,
it certainly provided the best one-liner.  Stately Ben
Kingsley stares at the prosaic-looking John Goodman
with a deadpan eye and says, "You look intelligent,
but when you open your mouth, the effect is spoiled!" 
If you get any satisfaction from watching this movie,
it'll be because you like Annette Benning (who gives a
fine performance), or because you generally believe
that all men are from Mars and that this movie will
confirm all of your suspicions.

Title
Review for You've Got Mail (1998)
I've come to notice that I have a small defensive mechanism that
occasionally pops up when a stranger approaches me. Invariably, I
immediately make a subtle course change and try to discretely add some
distance between the other person and me as we pass one another. If
this oncoming person looks suspicious, you can bet that I'll veer even
further from my path. Maybe by doing this, I am cheating myself out of
an encounter that would have been infinitely fulfilling. I guess, in a
sense, this is why technology and the internet is bringing our world
closer together. By accessing some of these online chat rooms, for
example, it affords us a chance to talk freely with others with out
the humility of revealing our identities.  It also offers the failsafe
mechanism of turning off the computer if you feel that you've
attracted one of the many weirdoes out in cyberspace. But maybe - just
maybe - you might actually find someone that you can feel as
comfortable with as your favorite fuzzy blanket. 
Take Kathleen (Meg Ryan) and Joe (Tom Hanks). To each other in the
online world, they are best friends who are intent to preserve their
anonymity. When they are online, their lives become a rich tapestry of
conversation whose long talks about nothing allow them to reveal more
than any real face-to-face conversation ever could. Late at night or
early in the morning, when they are not in the busy nine-to-five mode,
they nestle up to their computers secretly wishing that they were
nestling with one another. They flirt, confide in one another, and
even contemplate meeting. But sometimes, relationships like these are
better left a fantasy. The cold, hard reality of this seemingly cute
bond is that in real life, they are actually enemies. Kathleen owns a
small but wonderful children's bookstore. She has a heart of gold and
is a romantic in every sense of the word. But everything that she has
worked for is being threatened when Joe's company builds a
Border's-like superstore just around the block. Despite the fact that
I would just about hate anyone that drove me out of business, Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan are infectiously cute. The way Ryan rolls her baby
blue eyes as she confesses her inner thoughts or the way Hanks bobs
his head left and right as he searches for just the right words are
real gems. And because these two are so affable, and because we're
interested in what these two have to say to each other (they mostly
talk about basically mundane things and offer small snippets of wisdom
to one another), we are engrossed with the idea of them meeting. What
will happen when they discover whom their online pen pal really is?
Where will the story go from there? And this is what really allowed me
to enjoy the film. I was never sure where the story would quite go.
And whether they actually got together or not didn't really matter
because in the end, I just enjoyed the characters so much that I would
have been happy no matter what their outcome. 


Title
Review for Fallen (1998)
Some angels that are cast out of Heaven come down to Earth to inhabit
unsuspecting souls.  People just like you and me can become unwilling
hosts to these impish beings that now exist for no other reason than
to torment and spread evil.  This is the seemingly far-fetched
explanation offered to Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) who
is in the course of investigating a series of murders and strange
occurrences.  
Hobbes becomes embroiled in this case shortly after Edgar Reese (Elias
Koteas), a convicted killer that he was responsible for apprehending,
was put to death.  After Reese's execution, however, more murders
patterned after Reese's style begin to occur. Mysterious, late-night
phone calls taunt Hobbes and clues are left at the murder scenes
daring Hobbes to comprehend what's really going on.  Is it a case of a
delusional, copycat murderer on the loose?  Or is there a more
sinister entity at work here? 
"Fallen" ultimately takes on the form of a film noir with supernatural
elements that pits a good-natured detective against an evil presence,
known as Azazel.  The movie offers us some interesting moments.
Hobbes and his partner, Jonesy (John Goodman), reflect solemnly on the
purpose of enforcing goodness knowing how strong evil is.  We learn
that Azazel is a force that can move from one host body to another
through touch.  At one point, on a busy, city street, pedestrians are
quickly touching each other, as Azazel transports from one body to
another as it pursues its next victim.  And, there is a interesting
subplot that revolves around a cop who experienced Hobbes' situation
30 years ago.  As Hobbes learns more and more about the omnipotence of
his evil-spirit opponent, a sense of combustibility begins to become
more and more prevalent.
However, this movie teases us but never quite takes us past the
Imagination Threshold (a point that moviegoers must pass in order to
embrace such fantastical elements in this kind of film).   Hobbes is
the kind of honest cop that can only exist in a movie - never
accepting a bribe, professing to do everything under a code of honor,
adhering to the laws that are in place.  Denzel Washington seems like
an odd choice, with his soft demeanor and good looks.  He never seems
to really internalize the bizarre situation at hand.  Jonesy doesn't
add any spice to the movie's cast of characters and seems much too
heavy to be an effective detective.  And Donald Sutherland, playing
the police department's lieutenant, is reduced to beady-eyed stares as
he tries to monitor the progress of the investigation.  His role is
essentially wasted.  
If this film was trying to adhere to the conventional parameters of a
police thriller, it failed to engage us in the plight of Hobbes, even
as Azazel continued to torment him.  As a piece of film noir, however,
it still faltered because the cast seemed completely out of their
element.  What this film lacked, oddly enough, was spirit.

Title
Review for Hearts in Atlantis (2001)
"Hearts in Atlantis," set in a sleepy neighborhood in
the carefree era of the early 60s, follows in the vein
of other Stephen King tales about nostalgia and
innocence lost (most notably "Stand by Me" and "The
Green Mile").  It is a purposefully paced story that
focuses on the uneasy transition from boyhood to
adulthood.  It reminds us of the gentle awakenings to
the often-sinuous world that lie waiting for us when
we finally grow up.  It sympathizes the inevitable
fact that growing up frequently leaves us more
disillusioned and less hopeful.
Adults and children view the world in very different
ways.  For the grown-up, what they see is panoramic in
scope.  They see much of what is good like the
innocence of children, the beauty of books, and
rejoice in the ever-lasting effect of that first kiss
by which all others will be judged.  
However, with the wisdom that they have acquired over
a lifetime of experiences, they also see what is bad. 
They recognize the presence of things that are
ominous.  Such is the case of the mysterious Ted
Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), a transient fellow who
shows up one day at the home of young 11-year old
Bobby (Anton Yelchin).  He has come to rent out the
extra room upstairs.
His mom (Hope Davis) is unsettled by his appearance. 
"I never trust a man who carries his possessions in
grocery bags," she says.  But that doesn't matter to
Bobby.  For children, what they see is more selective.
 It's as if they are looking into a mirror, gazing
upon a reflection, and seeing only what they want to
see.  
Currently, Bobby's world centers on his best friends,
Sully (Will Rothhaar) and Carol (Mika Boorem), and a
lazy summer that never seems to end.  It consists of
reading books on a giant tree branch that rests over a
babbling brook, the hope that a new bicycle awaits
him, and a glorious night at the local fair.
This is the last summer of Bobby's childhood. 
Partially, it's because he's 11 going on 12. 
Partially, it's due to his emerging friendship with
Ted.  Bobby's Dad died seven years ago, and his mom is
too distracted with her job to invest the kind of love
that every 11-year old needs.  Meanwhile, Ted offers
cold root beer, will pay Bobby a dollar a week to read
him the newspaper, and asks him to keep an eye out for
"Low Men" who wear dark hats and drive
official-looking cars.  They are the bullies in his
life.
Bobby begins to slowly learn that it's time to stop
gazing into the mirror and to try to struggle with the
world's realities, even if it is more than any 11-year
old can hope to imagine.  Sully is more than just his
friend.  Carol is more than just the pretty girl next
door.  Mom does love him.  And the world is bigger
than the block on which you live, meaner than the
local bully, and more complex than your feelings after
your first kiss.  Alas, the mysteries of adolescence
may never be understood.  And, as Ted so eloquently
yet sadly remarks, "there are some moments of
happiness that you live in some place magical that
Atlantis must have been.  Then we grow up and our
hearts break into two."

Title
Review for Bachelor, The (1999)
With the 1999 movie year drawing to a close, you can
expect the studios to start releasing a spate of films
that will be vying for the Academy's attention.  It's
Oscar time, so expect films to be more innovative in
presentation and weightier in storytelling.  But if
you're not in search of an Oscar contender, and
instead would be content with a lightweight, romantic
comedy for a Saturday night, then I would like to
marginally recommend `The Bachelor,' a saccharine film
where the cutest of couples inevitably find their way
into each other's arms.
The couple in question is Jimmie (Chris O'Donnell) and
Anne (Renee Zellweger).  And according to Jimmie, guys
have a strange way of looking at relationships.  Men
are like wild mustangs running wild through the
plains.  They stop for the occasional patch of lush
grass, symbolic to how men date different women.  Once
the mustangs are done, they move on.  So, it's
puzzling to him that he's been going steady with Anne
for almost three years.  What scares him even more is
that all of his friends are also getting married.  He
is the only bachelor left among his circle of friends.
 He is the only wild mustang that still roams free. 
Now, it's just a matter of time.  Soon, he'll have to
pop the question.  However, it is clear that Jimmie
isn't ready for marriage.  His gives Anne the most
awkward and wretched proposal that anyone has ever
given.  Indeed, his words aren't a proposal but rather
a declaration of surrender.  This doesn't make Anne
very happy.  She declines, though Jimmie somehow feels
relieved.
Soon after, Jimmie learns that his persnickety uncle
(Peter Ustinov) has passed away and has bequeathed to
him a $100 million fortune.   The only catch is that
he must marry before he turns 30, which literally
gives him 24 hours to tie the knot.  His desire to wed
quickly does not stem from the lost inheritance;
rather, the provisions of the will would force him to
sell the family business and put hundreds of people
out of work.  With Anne out of the question, Jimmie
searches out his old girlfriends with the $100 million
proposal.  One of his odder second-tier choices was
the deranged-looking Buckley (played by Brooke
Shields).  As she grudgingly begins to take her vows,
she keeps repeating `100 million dollars' to herself
to convince herself to go forward.  But she becomes
more rattled when she soon discovers that she'll have
to stay wed for 10 long years and even more shaken
when she learns that she must give birth to one child.
 She quickly bolts and the search continues.  This
includes a front-page article in a newspaper, which
leads to a very funny but sweet finale.  Despite his
need to wed quickly, he still wishes that he could
marry Anne.  But until he can internalize commitment,
that will never happen.
I am marginally recommending this film for two
reasons.  I enjoyed the final 10 minutes of the film
when 1,000 hopeful brides (and a few drag queens)
chase Jimmie through the streets of San Francisco. 
But primarily, it was because I liked Jimmie and Anne.
 Renee Zellweger is adorable and her smile can
brighten the darkest day.  Chris O'Donnell is also
affable.   They both exude energy, and it is their
combined charm that allows this movie to stay afloat.
`The Bachelor' is somewhat engaging but never
disappointing.

Title
Review for Flubber (1997)
Bowling balls bounce high into the air and out of sight.  Basketball
players make incredible slam dunks by leaping from mid-court.   Golf
balls ricochet off walls like a pinball.   All this thanks to a
mysterious rubber polymer called Flubber.  It's unique characteristic
is that when you apply a little amount of energy, it gives off an
exponential amount in return.  This breakthrough was discovered by
Professor Philip Brainard (Robin Williams), a genius when it comes to
science but a forgetful dolt when it comes to daily routines.  He goes
to the wrong class to teach, he easily forgets names, and worst of
all, he has already twice missed his wedding ceremony.   "One more
chance," says finacee Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden), who is
also President of Medfield College where they both work.  But Sara
Jean has more than an absent-minded professor to worry about.
Medfield is also bankrupt, and a greedy creditor is about to
foreclose.
Brainard knows that Flubber holds the answer to his woes.  As an
alternative energy source (he modifies his old car so that it can
fly), companies would pay millions.  He could save the college and
salvage his relationship all at once.  However, people soon learn
about his discovery and want to steal it including the creditor and a
rival scientist.
This is a  pleasant film, but it's appeal is geared towards a younger
audience.  Robin Williams gives a charismatically manic performance as
the memory-challenged professor.  He is likable, but his fellow
performers seem kind of silly.  The comedy is purely slapstick, and
thus begins to curiously look like one of those Home Alone movies.
People get hit by flying objects, they slip and fall, and everyone
generally winds up with a head full of lumps.  If there is any proof
that the comedy is pure silliness, all you have to know is that two of
the hired goons are named Smith and Wesson.  But this is also a Disney
production, and Disney's brand of wonderful magic is present
throughout the film.  Flubber takes on a cute, life-like quality (it
whimpers and whines); there is a terrific sequence that involves a
basketball game pitting jocks versus 'flubberized' nerds; and there is
an incredible dancing sequence which I can only describe as the
Flubber Mambo.  The professor is also aided by a cute, self-aware,
floating, mechanical assistant named Weebo.  She flashes images on her
miniature television screen from various shows to convey her feelings.
Why didn't the professor just create more of these?  They'd sell like
hotcakes!  He probably forgot.
While flubber may ultimately save Medfield college, it isn't enough to
make this movie anything truly special.

Title
Review for Get Carter (2000)
"My name is Jack Carter, and you don't want to know
me" says our brooding anti-hero (Sylvester Stallone). 
Take his advice!  To know this guy is as rewarding as
being thrown over a terrace.  And to watch this film
is almost as painful.  "Get Carter" is a gloomy
looking, unimaginative film that offers no joy.
Jack Carter is as tough as tough guys come.  He works
out of Vegas as a self-described 'financial adjuster'.
 Explaining his duties, he says, "people make promises
and break them.  I help them remember."  He has a
chiseled body full of tattoos.  He has the weathered
look indicative of a man who has seen his share of
hard times.  He speaks in a hushed but menacing tone
of voice.  In other words, this is Sylvester Stallone
acting like...Sylvester Stallone.  And like most of
his previous roles, his character is a shallow,
one-dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk
tough, hassle a few hapless people, find out what he
needs to know, and then dispense his own kind of
justice.  With the charisma of a pit bull, being tough
is all that Jack Carter knows.  
Yet, even tough guys know when to put family first. 
As the story begins, we learn that Jack's little
brother has died in a car accident.  The police
attribute it to heavy drinking.  However, Jack is
suspicious, believing that he was 'taken out'.  He
takes a break from his Vegas duties and tries to see
if he can find the truth.  As he pokes around, he runs
into several lowlife characters.  They include a shady
business partner, a prostitute, a dweebish millionaire
molded after Bill Gates, and an oily owner of a porn
website.  
Any one of them may know something about his brother's
death.  All of them have the means of carrying out the
deed.  But don't expect an exercise in sleuthing where
well-placed clues lead Carter to the truth.  He's all
brawn and no brains, so there are no epiphanies during
his investigation.  Instead, he uses intimidation to
muscle his way forward, cycling through this circle of
suspects.  Flustered with his lack of progress, he
cycles through them again and again.  This all gets
tiring fairly quickly.  By the time the film launches
into its final act, we're numb from its pedestrian
pace.
Oddly, as a tough-guy thriller, it starves us for
action.  Admittedly, there is one nifty chase
sequence, but this is related to a tangential and
needless plot (Carter's Vegas ties send thugs to
retrieve him).  The story also fails to generate any
kind of emotion.  Stallone has the personality of a
slab of stone.  And the look and feel of the film is
perpetually downcast.  The weather is constantly
overcast or rainy.  Meanwhile, most shots take place
at night, in dimly lit rooms, or in dark alleys.  It's
just impossible to get stirred about that kind of
atmosphere.  As a result, "Get Carter" amounts to
nothing more than a flat thriller, bereft of clever
moments and devoid of any excitement.  You're better
off leaving this guy alone.

Review for Face/Off (1997)
For weeks I have prayed to the movie Gods for a film that would give me a   
sustained adrenaline rush, would have really strong characters, and would   
give me something to remember this summer by.  Finally, my prayers have   
been answered.  Face-Off is my deliverance from the normal humdrum summer   
action fare.  Directed by the stylistically supreme John Woo, he gives us   
something to relieve us from the summer heat´a really cool movie.
For 6 years, FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) has been on the trail   
of psychotic killer Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage).  And,  he gets his   
chance to catch him very early on in the film.  Quickly,  we are treated   
to a visceral offering of gunplay, violence, and terrific action as   
Archer finally gets his man.  This kind of action would be the finale for   
most movies.  But, here, it is just the start of what's to come.  Troy is   
captured -- and left in a coma -- but Archer soon discovers that Troy has   
left a giant time bomb where it will kill everyone within one square   
mile.  Archer must discover the whereabouts before it blows.  But the   
only other person who would know is Troy's brother, Pollux, who was also   
captured in the initial gunfight.  But how can they get Pollux to reveal   
the location of the bomb?
When the Bureau's high-tech medical division informs him of new surgery   
techniques, Archer conceives a plan. He'll allow the physicians to give   
him Troy's face -- literally -- and he'll assume Troy's cruel but   
charismatic personality. They'll also surgically implant a microchip to   
alter his voice to be just like Troy's.  Then he'll go into a   
maximum-security prison and trick Pollux into mentioning where the bomb   
is ticking.  So far so good.
However, Troy awakens from his coma.  He's not quite feeling himself   
anymore, so with the help of some of his goons, he forces the physicians   
to put Archer's face on his skull. The identity swap is now complete   
(Troy is now Travolta and Archer is now Cage).  Troy/Travolta then kills   
everyone who knew of this project and burns down the facility.  He then   
uses his new identity to get into Archer's house -- and next to the   
agent's unsuspecting wife (Joan Allen) and extremely pretty daughter   
(Dominique Swain), while Archer-as-Cage is now stuck in a   
maximum-security prison Í alone and enraged that he has the face of his   
most hated enemy, and fearful for the safety of his family.  Archer/Cage   
must escape and must face off with Troy one last time.
Well-scripted and well-choreographed, this is an operatic and intensely   
violent fable about two men who pursue each other through hell and back.   
Cage and Travolta display genuine gusto for their roles (both when each   
one is bad and good) and despite the switch in identities, we are always   
in step with their characters.  When we see Cage or Travolta walk in, the   
audience knows who they really are.  The arrogant and flamboyant   
Troy/Travolta endures a quiet, domestic, suburban life and a subdued   
Archer/Cage makes his way into the kinetic frenzy of the underworld   
marked by drugs and fast women.  And although they find poignant lessons   
in their new surroundings (Troy trying to teach Archer's daughter how to   
defend herself or Archer learning about loyalty from the goon set), their   
hatred for each other consumes them.  Troy/Travolta definitely has the   
upper hand because he now has the resources of the FBI.  Archer/Cage is   
now wanted dead or alive.  And, even if he survives, will he ever regain   
the family that was taken away because no one knows who Archer-as-Cage   
really is?  A spectacular final confrontation is inevitable and we are   
not disappointed with the finale.
In the world of Woo, movie-watching is a whole new experience.  There is   
a delirious mixture of spectacular gun battles, furious explosions and   
breathtaking stunt work.  Gun battles and terrorist attacks are staged   
like ballets, bullets spray across every inch of the screen and even the   
most mundane scenes are brought to life as captured in poetic slow   
motion.  Cage languished in Con Air, but here he sizzles.  And Travolta   
infuses energy and hipness.  This hot summer, treat yourself to something   
refreshing and something cool.  This is one not to miss.

Review for Planet of the Apes (2001)
On a distant planet, perhaps in another galaxy or in
another dimension, apes have remarkably evolved to a
superior state while Homo sapiens, oddly, are the
animals.  The human race has become a scourge.  They
are caged, prodded, displayed for amusement, and sold
into slavery.  Some are even kept as pets.  At first,
this film seems to project itself as biting satire 
an ironic piece of social commentary about our own
arrogant sense of aggrandizement.  But the film's
initial edginess considerably dulls as these notions
fade and "Apes" devolves into an unremarkable story
about a lost space traveler trying to return home.
The 20-minutes-too-long opening introduces us to
Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), a pilot working on a
research space station.  While on a search and rescue
mission, he is blindsided by one of those Star
Trek-like swirling spatial anomalies.  Hurled through
time and space, he eventually crash lands on a strange
planet.  
Looking like a contestant on "Survivor 4," without
benefit of supplies or technology, he comes across a
band of humans, dressed in post-apocalyptic fashion. 
They are running for their lives, pursued by apes. 
But these aren't the simians that Davidson remembers
back on Earth.  These species seem to be eons ahead on
the evolutionary scale.  They speak, have superhuman
strength, and are as nimble as Jackie Chan. 
Eventually captured, he meets militant extremist
General Thade (Tim Roth), who considers the human
population an infestation and wants to eradicate the
whole species.   However, Ari (Helena Bonham Carter),
a civil-minded daughter of a powerful Senator, keeps
his genocidal plans in check.  But her influence can
only go so far.  And when Thade becomes convinced of
Davidson's threat to the ape-world's balance of
nature, he calls up his army whilst Ari and Davidson
flee into the hinterlands.
Much of the film focuses on their journey to a
destination where they believe they can find help
while Thade and his military troops give pursuit.  But
their travels provide too few exciting or tense
moments.  Meanwhile, Mark Wahlberg lacked the
leading-man charisma, unable to inspire his ragtag
band of followers.  With this kind of leadership, only
the hand of God could prevent a complete slaughter. 
The Ape characters seemed more, wellhuman. 
Roth-as-Thade is gloriously malicious as the fascist
leader.  Carter-as-Ari turns in a compassionate
performance as the sympathetic aristocrat.  Also of
note is Michael Clarke Duncan who lends an air of
nobility as Thade's trusted friend.  And likeable was
an orangutan slave trader (Paul Giametti) whose witty
banter and sour disposition made him seem like a
distant cousin to Jim Carrey's "Grinch."
The realism of these apes is incredible as advanced
make-up techniques give these creatures an uncannily
human look.  Yet they still maintain such apish traits
as sniffing, roaring, beating their chests, swinging,
and walking with that distinctive simian gait.  Their
world is all the more imposing thanks to director Tim
Burton's dark and gloomy otherworldly visualizations. 
  Meanwhile, maestro Danny Elfman (who did "Batman")
composes a soundtrack filled with ominous sounding
passages and gothic/military anthems.
"Apes" gets an opposable "thumbs up" for visuals,
presentation, and for its overall imaginative look and
feel.  However, it gets an opposable "thumbs down" for
a bland story, a lackluster drama, and its absurd
resolution.  While competent and handsome looking, it
needed greater profundity, zip, and intensity.  As it
stands, there's no reason to go ape.

Review for World Is Not Enough, The (1999)
The latest installment in one of the most durable
franchises in Hollywood history has been released. 
And by now, either you've seen it or you've already
made up your mind to pass on James Bond's latest
escapade.  If you've decided to pass, you're probably
making the correct choice.  `The World Is Not Enough'
has all of the ingredients that make for a fun Bond
film, but it lacks spark and ingenuity.  
Before I bring out the three major weaknesses of this
film, I do want to say that the Bond formula has
worked again and again for a couple of reasons.  Bond
films are not about character development or an
absorbing story line.  It's about the beautiful women,
the exotic locations, amazing gadgets, sexual humor,
and breathtaking action sequences.  In the beginning
of this film, there is a terrific water chase through
the Thames River that probably ranks as one of the
best beginning sequences among all of the bond films.
This chase occurs because of a bombing that has
occurred within MI6 Headquarters (home of the British
Secret Service).  The victim in the accident is a
wealthy business tycoon who is in the midst of
constructing a new pipeline from Russia to Europe.  It
is vital that this pipeline be completed to help
ensure the West's supply of oil for the coming
millenium.  Now, his daughter, Electra, must take
control to finish the project (Sophie Marceau).  But
there are plenty of people that would like to see this
project fail.  The British Ministry, headed by `M'
(Judi Dench), believes that the person most capable of
carrying out such a plan is the baleful Reynard
(Robert Carlisle), a rogue KGB agent.  In the process
of protecting Electra, Bond meets up with the nubile
Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards).  Why is her
name Christmas?  I think that the only reason is so
that the film can end with one of those silly
double-entendres.  She's a nuclear scientist, and her
importance remains unclear until at some point in the
film a nuclear warhead is stolen.  This is an abrupt
turn of events, but true Bond fans should be able to
stay the course.  Others who are not as devoted will
instead laugh every time Dr. Jones speaks about the
internal workings of a bomb (which is what happened in
my theatre).  She's less convincing as a scientist
than a bed pet for Bond.
Up to this point, I'm only enthused for the first 20
or 30 minutes of the film.  Then the energy of the
film begins to wane.  Why is that?  Here are those
three weaknesses.  1)  There is no wacky, evil
sidekick.  The best spy films have a cool sidekick
like Oddjob, Jaws, or even Mini-Me.  2)  The women are
nothing but pretty pin-up posters.  In the last film,
they were smart to introduce the karate-kicking
Michelle Yeoh.  Here, Denise Richards didn't seem like
a necessary addition to the cast.  Meanwhile, Sophie
Marceau, while adequate, couldn't punch her way out of
a bag.  3)  Brosnan was excellent in the sophisticated
remake, `The Thomas Crown Affair.'  Judi Dench is an
Oscar-winning actress.  Robert Carlisle is a great
actor whose credits include `Trainspotting' and `The
Full Monty.'  Here, they are tremendously
underutilized.
Let's face it.  James Bond is not great detective.  He
lucks his way in and out of situations that gets him
closer to his final encounter.  Guns equipped with
laser sights still manage to miss him and despite his
need to be covert, he always smugly gives out his real
name as Bond, James Bond.  Watching 007's exploits is
a guilty pleasure through and through.

Review for Titanic (1997)
In 1912, the Titanic would set sail on it's first and only voyage across 
the chilly North Atlantic.  History has well-documented its inevitable
doom, and expeditions have just recently discovered the remains of the
Titanic resting peacefully in its watery grave.  But, what must have
it been like to be a passenger on board the greatest and most
luxurious ship of its time?  What stories are hidden deep beneath the
Atlantic?
For one particular passenger, Rose (Kate Winslet), the Titanic was
nothing more than a prison ship escorting her to America, where she
will marry an odiously snooty but terribly wealthy Cal Hockley (Billy
Zane) in order to help her cash-poor mother.  But to Rose, the
engagement is the equivalent of a slow death.  One of the passengers
that she eventually meets up with is an artistic drifter, Jack Dawson
(Leonardo DiCaprio). While his social status is far beneath that of
hers, a romantic bond begins to develop as she begins to identify with
his sense of freedom.  Soon they're gallivanting through the
corridors, cargo holds and steerage sections - all the places that a
proper lady ought not to go.  Her mother is furious, her fiancé is
madly jealous, and all attempts are made to thwart their continued
relationship.  It may take an act of God (or an iceberg) to tear these
two apart.  Can a relationship work out on a 'ship of dreams' even
when doom is imminent?
This is just one of the terrific elements that makes this movie
unsinkable.  Through an ingenious storytelling technique, Camerron
allows the audience to absorb ourselves with the developing romance
without being distracted by the ship's fate.  Oscar-worthy Winslet is
charming and strong as the free-spirited socialite.  DeCaprio is also
appealing as the young vagabond that introduces her to the ways of the
wicked world.  Their tale is engaging and is a terrific, all-around,
old-fashioned love story.  But this movie is more than a fictional
account of two lovers from dichotomously different backgrounds.
That's just the tip of the iceberg.
It's also an eye-popping historical piece.  No doubt, much of the
purported $200 million spent on making this movie was used to recreate
an almost-full-scale Titanic.  Director James Camerron gives us little
peeks into an era that was dominated by class and social distinction
and into the Titanic, a symbol of the times.  We see the luxury of
first class, replete with ornate rooms, fine crystal and china.  After
dinner, the tuxedo-clad men retreat from their wives to smoke fine
cigars and sip fine brandy amongst themselves.  In the engine room, we
feel the sweat of the men that furiously shovel coal into the furnaces
that power the steam engines.  We revel with the people in steerage
who dance among themselves and drown themselves in beer.  But the most
impressive sequence comes in the latter part of the movie just after
the Titanic runs into that fateful iceberg.  Not only is the technical
production of the Titanic's sinking spellbinding, but we get a further
glimpse into the panic, chaos and brief moments of courage displayed.
Steerage passengers are forced to wait as first class passengers are
allowed to evacuate first; lifeboats can only accomodate less than
half of the passengers; and Rose and Jack desperately try to cling on
to each other, their love and their lives.  Despite the pandemonium,
Camerron's Oscar-worthy direction skillfully manages to keep our
attention focused on Rose and Jack, never for a moment allowing us to
stray from the central love story.
This movie is a 198-minute epic that successfully brings history and
drama into proportion.  And if Camerron had the time to tell us more,
I would have gladly sat and watched for another 3 hours.  Visually
stunning, intelligently constructed, and thoroughly engrossing, this
film is a wondrous achievement about an era and a ship that was
equally so.

Review for Chicken Run (2000)
"Chicken Run," a fanciful tale about chickens
desperate to escape captivity, is innovative and
clever and is one of the most unique looking films
this year.  On the Tweedy Chicken Farm, life is cruel
and laborious.  These chickens live in a setting
that's reminiscent of a World War II concentration
camp.  The ground is muddied, the area is encircled by
barbed wire, and the perimeter is constantly patrolled
by Mr. Tweedy (voiced by Tony Haygarth) and his two
snarling guard dogs.  Worse, the bitter Mrs. Tweedy
(voiced by Miranda Richardson) oversees the farm.  She
closely examines her production report every week. 
And, if a chicken doesn't lay enough eggs, she takes
the underachiever to the chopping block.  
Ginger (voiced by Julia Sawalha), the plucky leader,
knows that they'll all meet the same fate sooner or
later.  She moons about freedom and the feeling of
lush grass under her three-toed feet.  She presses
everyone to think about escape.  But all attempts,
which include using a spoon to dig under a fence and
using an eggbeater to drill a tunnel, meet with
failure.  Of course, she could probably escape on her
own.  But the trick is to rescue the entire lot. 
That's no small feat, but these concepts of
selflessness, charity and teamwork are the
underpinnings that make this a heartwarming film.
Ginger's prayers may be answered when Rocky Rooster
(voiced by Mel Gibson) lands in the chicken farm.  She
marvels at his ability to 'fly' and believes that
flight offers the best chance of escape.  She hopes
that he'll teach them but finds it difficult to
establish a working relationship with the cocky
rooster.  He seems more interested in socializing and
boasting and is reluctant to help.  However, after
considerable duress, Rocky agrees to Ginger's request.
The ensuing sequences are hilarious as the chickens
engage in calisthenics, practice martial arts, and
attempt to fly by leaping off rooftops.  But lack of
progress begins to arouse the suspicion of some
others.  Ginger, however, clings on to hope.  "The
chances of us escaping are a million to one," says one
of the demoralized flock.  "Then we still have a
chance," says our optimistic heroine.
Meanwhile, their activities have caught the attention
of Mr. Tweedy.  "The chickens are organizing," he
urges the Missus, to which she replies, "chickens
can't organize."  But, she does notice that egg
production is dropping.  Tired of minuscule profits,
she decides to enter a different business that is even
more threatening to the livelihoods of the chicken
population.  Now, it's a race for survival.  If Ginger
and her flock can not escape in time, they may all
wind up in the frozen food section of the local
supermarket.
"Chicken Run," with its humorous level of mayhem, is a
fun movie for children.  However, it would have been
more appealing if the colors/palettes used weren't so
bleak.  Yet this is a film about a chicken
pen-itentiary, so its hues are understandably grayish.
 Adults will also find the plot engaging and even
dramatic.  And if you're familiar with the creator's
popular "Wallace and Gromit" mini-films, you'll find
many of its charming quirks here, including the heavy
Yorkshire accents, and the lipless faces with mouths
that have more bottom teeth than top ones.
Of greatest note is the amount of work needed to
create this film.  It uses Stop-motion photography in
which the models are minutely reshaped and
repositioned from shot to shot to give the illusion of
3-D movement.  To create one second of film, 24 shots
are required.  Anything less would result in
Gumby-esque choppiness.  Some of the scenes are
wonderfully and incredibly complex, including the
morning roll call; a dance party; and the clever
finale.  "Chicken Run" is fun to watch and amazing to
look at.  It's not as rousing a tale or as colorful as
Toy Story 2, but it's certainly as inventive and as
sweet.

Title
Review for Arlington Road (1999)
`Arlington Road' is a film that I would characterize as odd' for a
summertime release.  As you watch the film, it almost feels as if
you're taking a summer course at your local community college called
`The Current Socio-political Environment of Terrorism.'  Would taking
this kind of course be of any interest to you?  Probably not when the
classroom to the right features extra-terrestrials on parade and the
classroom to the left features lesson in sex and baked goods.  But that
is not to say that this is a bad film.  In fact, the more I think about
it, the more I reflect positively on this offering.
`Arlington Road' introduces us to John Farraday (Jeff Bridges) as a
professor of Terrorism.  In class, he openly questions the
effectiveness of the FBI and how it handles cases of domestic
terrorism.  He points out the Saint Louis Federal Building bombing,
which is analogous to the tragedy of Oklahoma City.  He tells his
students that the FBI, after years of painstaking investigation, pinned
all of the blame on just one man.  How could one lone person be the
instrument of such massive destruction, he asks his class.  You can
begin to see the seething distaste that he harbors for the FBI. 
Farraday also takes his class on a field trip to a place called Copper
Creek where a fatal and unnecessary confrontation took place between
those who lived on the property and federal agents.  He explains that
the FBI didn't do enough research before convincing themselves that the
family living there was stockpiling guns for some future terrorist act.
His wife, among several others, is subsequently killed in a gun battle.
 Sadly, he can never get past this personal tragedy, and it manifests
itself into heightened paranoia and a deep suspicion about his new
neighbor, Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins). 
Lang is quite odd in many ways.  He keeps to himself, carries himself
as if he had something to hide, and wears a troubled look that's both
suspect and menacing.  Why does Lang not want Farraday to see his work?
 Why does Lang keep getting mail that he insists have been addressed to
the wrong person?  Why was Lang in Saint Louis right around the time
the Federal Building was bombed?  At this point, which is about 45
minutes into the film, the movie moves away from its philosophical
stance and begins to take shape as a psychological drama.  Can Farraday
convince anyone that Lang is dangerous (including a friend who works
for the FBI and his current girlfriend)?  What's Lang's real story?
The movie appropriately takes its time in painting Farraday as a man
passionate about his opinions and consumed with suspicion.  I also
enjoyed Joan Cusack, who plays Oliver's wife.  She's sweet on the
outside, but there's a scary beast within and she projects just the
perfect facial expressions that make her absolutely eerie.  What did
strike me as odd was that near the end, the movie unexpectedly kicks it
up two notches, like some thoroughbred rounding the final corner and
sprinting towards the finish line.  I enjoyed the unexpected ending
that it led us to, but after establishing its pace, it finally succumbs
to a bloody fistfight, car chases, and a whopping explosion.  But let
me say once again that this is a fair offering.  Nonetheless, I'd still
probably choose to enter the classroom on the left or on the right.


Title
Review for Great Expectations (1998)
What do you suppose is the greatest form of energy?  What can take a
person further than one ever thought possible?  The answer is: Desire.
The desire that slowly brews within Finnegan [Finn] Bell (Ethan Hawke)
is the central focus of this poetic drama.   
When we first meet up with young Finn, we can see that he is a child
who roams freely without the heavy-handed guidance of most children
his age.  He spends his time hanging out at the fishing pier, wades
through the shallow waters of the Gulf, and scrawls his artwork into a
keepsake book.  As an incipient artist, he is truly gifted; like a
fish, he is free to do what he pleases.  But two acute episodes begin
to shape his future. 
One is a brief but traumatic encounter with an escaped convict (Robert
DeNiro).  The other happens when he meets Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow).
The movie spends most of its time focusing on these two.  Estella is
the embodiment of a cold-hearted soul that flaunts her sexuality as a
weapon of superiority and a catalyst of vengeance.  And we learn that
Estella's motivations are, in part, influenced by her eccentric
mother, the multimillionaire Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft).  Ms.
Dinsmoor was left standing at the alter many years ago and has been in
a continuous state of jilted mourning ever since.  Living alone in a
mansion that is quickly deteriorating and overrun with creepers, she
singles out Finn as the victim of her machinations.  She hates men,
and using Estella as the weapon, she will torment Finn as a means of
retaliation.  For starters, she teases Finn by telling him to not fall
in love with Estella, for she will break his heart.  But he does; he
is smitten, and Finn's long journey and subsequent transformation thus
begins.
For the most part, throughout his transformation process,  I enjoyed
the richness of the characters that Finn meets up with who subtly
impact his growth.  From the encounter with the convict to his
laid-back uncle to his frenzied art pals, each one contributes in
their own unique way.   Estella's detachment was haunting yet
bittersweet.  Also, Ms. Dinsmoor exuded a delicious blend of insanity
and wisdom who liked to listen to old records and end her sentences
with the words "Chick-e-boom".
Yet, there seemed to be something at work here that undermined the
allure set in the first half of the film.  Perhaps it was the fact
that we grew tired of watching Finn constantly adjust his lifestyle to
win over Estella.  Perhaps we were not convinced of Estella's
attraction for Finn.  Perhaps it was because we never really knew what
Estella was thinking.  Perhaps it was because the ending seemed
incongruously happy.  Moreover, as I was watched the film, the message
of the movie seemed to get buried behind the luscious cinematography
and beneath the bewitching musical score.  
It certainly seemed to have the potential to deliver a strong film.
But somewhere along the way, the story just ran out of steam.  Poetic
at some points and seemingly at a standstill at other points, I left
the theatre with many more questions than answers in my mind.  This is
not necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, this is the kind of film that
leaves an impression in your mind as you walk out of the theatre.  For
me, however, I had higher expectations for this film, but what I got
was nothing great.

Title
Review for Dungeons & Dragons (2000)
Many years ago, my friends and I would meet every
other Saturday afternoon and embark on imaginary
quests.  In our minds, we created and entered a
mythical realm that held treasures waiting to be
discovered, perils waiting to be faced, and magic
spells waiting to be unleashed.  Our group of
adventurers included fighters that eagerly charged
into battle, mages that coruscated the sky with magic
missiles and balls of lightning, clerics that provided
healing powers, and thieves that were useful in
disarming traps and picking locks.  Overseen by an
emcee that thrust us into dangerous situations, armed
with a stack of paper that provided information about
our abilities, and equipped with a myriad of strangely
shaped dice that could spell fortune or disaster, we
giddily lost ourselves for several hours in the
neo-medieval world of Dungeons & Dragons.
Much of the action and skullduggery that could have
only been imagined those Saturday afternoons have been
conjured up adequately in this live-action film based
on the popular role-playing game.  The story tells
about the struggle between young, embattled Empress
Savina (Thora Birch) and the power-mad Profion (Jeremy
Irons), an evil mage who seeks to incite a revolt. 
Savina receives help from some unlikely sources
including two bumbling thieves, an apprentice mage, a
battle axe-wielding dwarf, and a dark-skinned elf. 
They find danger at every turn as they negotiate
dungeons, trapped mazes, and a dragon's lair where
they seek an artifact that can help them defeat
Profion.
The landscape, the various humanoid races, and the
monsters are all nicely envisioned, but the movie
suffers terribly from stilted acting and a screenplay
that sacrifices what could have been a rousing
adventure of might and magic for cartoonish mayhem. 
Jeremy Irons is frequently incomprehensible as the
snarling mage.  Thora Birch lacks passion as the
benevolent leader.  And the others players seem like
they're from various defunct WB television shows. 
They are much too young to be able to succeed in their
tasks, but are obviously cast in order to appeal to a
younger audience.  
With its popularity and built-in fan base, a
live-action film seemed like a no-brainer.  However,
it took 10 long years before a suitable script and the
necessary financing (budgeted at about $40+ million)
could be put together.  And bringing the world of D&D
to life was not easy.  Only recently, the special
effects technology was adequate enough to successfully
capture the enchanted look that an ersatz Paladin like
myself could appreciate.  Indeed, the visuals are
quite impressive, making this film look far more
expensive than its purported price tag.  In its
climactic scene, for example, there is a tremendous
battle that showcases dozens of flying dragons and
spellcasting mages.  Yet while this film seems long
overdue, it also feels like it has arrived too late. 
My dice now sit in the dusty corner of some
seldom-used closet and my character sheets have
yellowed with age.  Only teens, fans of Baldur's Gate,
and Dungeon-heads will find this tolerable.


Title
Review for Message in a Bottle (1999)
I've always believed that what makes any experience most fulfilling
and gratifying is our willingness to let down our defenses, allowing
ourselves to risk humility and heartache for the sake of discovery. 
Especially with matters of the heart, I suspect that when you put too
many parameters in place, love could sadly become more of an exercise
rather than an experience.  And herein lies what I thought to be the
major drawback of `Message in a Bottle,' a film that seemed more like
two people falling in therapy rather than in love.
One of the people is Theresa (Robin Wright Penn).  Her job is fairly
dry as she writes reports and conducts research for her big city
newspaper.  This career and her recent divorce seem to have sapped her
sense of passion.  But while walking along the beach one day, she
discovers a bottle containing a letter.  It is written so eloquently
and romantically that it would be fodder for any Oprah show.  Theresa
is immediately overwhelmed by its tone and tenderness and begins an
exhaustive search for the author of this message.  Before too long,
she hops on a plane to meet the writer whose words have affected her
so much.  It seems like such a crazy thing to do, but romance has a
funny way of affecting one's head.  Her destination is now a small
fishing town on the Carolina coast, and the mysterious man that she'll
try to find is named Garrett (Kevin Costner).  
Garret is a lonely person who has recently lost his wife.  He's quiet,
somewhat withdrawn, and possesses an appealing boy-next-door kind of
charm.  Yet once they meet, something strange begins to happen (or not
happen).  Amazingly, very little chemistry develops between Theresa
and Garret.  The main reason is the way in which Penn's character is
written.  Theresa is constantly weighing facts and outlining action
steps.  Is that what love is about?  `I wasn't sure where the
boundaries were,' she states in one scene, or `where do we go from
here,' she asks in another.  Consequently, as both Theresa and Garret
explore their feeling for one another, it seems as if the couple is
going through a counseling session rather than laying the foundation
for something wonderfully fulfilling.  Additionally, as we learn more
about Theresa and Garret, our involvement with these two characters
becomes lopsided.  Finally, I was practically caught off-guard (as if
a huge wave crashed into me) when the film reached its ending, which
seemed to literally come out of nowhere.  Yet the overall performances
were all very nice.  Penn displays a good range of emotions as she
looks for that unattainable love, which she might have found.  Costner
achieves a nice balance of possibly loving again tempered by his guilt
in doing so.  And Paul Newman as Garret's fiery,
girl-advice-dispensing dad steals all of the scenes that he's in.  I
really liked the performances, but was waterlogged by the lack of
direction and pep that the film seemed to be capable of given it's
cutely orchestrated first 20 minutes.  Whatever the filmmakers had
intended for us, the message wasn't so clear.

Review for A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)
In a movie season when most audiences show a
propensity to see light-hearted or action-packed fare,
a film like "A.I." is a puzzling offering.  The Steven
Spielberg/Stanley Kubrick collaboration about a
sophisticated robot boy programmed to love is an
intellectually demanding film that requires far more
brain power than most summer moviegoers want to
muster.  Stately paced, it is an incredibly ambitious
effort that inspires discussion over its message,
contemplation over its perplexities, and debate over
its cryptic ending.  
"A.I." is a triptych of curiosity, wonderment, and
ultimately, ambiguity.  It is a futuristic story about
a 'mecha' named David (Haley Joel Osment who
impressively strikes a balance between robotic
woodenness and human neediness).  Mechas are highly
sophisticated androids that resemble humans in both
appearance and emotion.  However, none had ever been
programmed to love -- until now.  
The production of David creates a fascinating
quandary.  For, even if he could love a family, would
the family love him back?  And would this technology
somehow threaten the frail structure upon which
humanity currently sits?  This intriguing question,
however, is only explored to a certain degree.
"A.I." veers during its second act, becoming an
adventure film.  David is ultimately rejected by his
family.  However, the adoptive mother (Frances
O'Connor) does not return David to his creators for
destruction, but instead sets him free.  David, who
still loves and may now even dream, sets off on a
personal quest that borrows elements from Pinocchio
and The Wizard of Oz.
The journey is absolutely wondrous.  He meets boon
friend, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a sleek-looking mecha
(thanks to aggressive makeup) that oozes with lusty
optimism.  He possesses a sultry charm and his
performance is balletic and memorable.  And the places
they travel to are jaw-droppingly stunning from the
carnal Rouge City and its festive air of hedonism to
the post-apocalyptic landscape of a now-submerged
Manhattan in which skyscrapers jut up like reeds in a
swamp.
In the final act, however, the audience may feel as
confused as they are awed by the spectacular
visualizations of the future.  It is in this final
segment that David tries to find that elusive bridge
between machine and humanity.  But the film doesn't
offer any concrete resolutions.  Perhaps this is
because in science fiction, much of what's seen is a
product of the filmmaker's imagination, and so too are
we left to conjure an interpretation of the final
scenes.  What any of us eventually come up with will
surely be debatable.  
Yet, a sense of wonderment may have been the entire
purpose of this film.  There are dozens of scenes that
emphasize hand-holding.  This may remind you of when
you were young and your parent took you for a walk to
the zoo or some other exotic location (at least by a
10-year old's standards).  You would look around in
amazement although you frequently didn't understand
where you were.  But your parent would continue to
point things out to your delight.  And it seems that
the filmmaker's are perhaps doing something similar
but on a much grander scale.  It challenges you to
look at the incredible sights, to look and try to see
the meaning of it all, and to look and formulate your
own thoughts.
After emerging from this film, you'll feel the fuzzy
sensation that you had seen something
thought-provoking.  "A.I." is undeniably audacious and
technically brilliant.  Yet, it should have engaged us
more meaningfully, given us more answers, and been
more moving.  What it did was to only spark our
curiosity, burden us with unanswered questions, and
leave us in a trance.

Review for Gattaca (1997)
Imagine that immediately after birth, a single drop of blood from the
newborn is taken and analyzed.  The genetic sequence reveals the
baby's entire future.  Its likelihood of disease, brain disorder,
baldness, and even its life expectancy is disclosed with a
slap-in-the-face cruelty.   In the not-so-distant future world of
Gattaca, medical science has evolved to such a point whereby this
procedure is commonplace.  The societal implications are more
profound.  Looking at one's genes is like looking at one's SAT scores.
Your results will predict (rightfully or wrongfully so) your success
and what you'll be able to accomplish.  
But why chance a less-than-perfect creation?  Medical science has also
progressed to the point where you can take the best of what the mom
and dad has to offer and genetically engineer the perfect baby.  And
as Gattaca begins, we see the young lives of two brother's who develop
a bitter sibling rivalry.  One is the perfectly engineered Anton
(Loren Dean).   The other, Vincent, (Ethan Hawke) was naturally
conceived.  He is God's child; an "de-gene-erate"; an "in-valid."  He
is diagnosed with a learning disorder, suffers from extreme myopia,
and is projected to live only 30 years.
But despite all of his imperfections, he has the desire to live, and
works hard to enter the Gattaca corporation, which launches manned
space flights.  But this is a fearsome world that subtly promotes
genetic discrimination.  After all of his attempts are thwarted
because he doesn't have the correct genetic makeup, he uses an illegal
DNA broker who sets him up with Jerome (Jude Law), a "valid" who was
paralyzed in a previous accident.  Jerome provides urine samples, hair
samples, blood samples and other body flotsam so that Vincent can
assume his identity and pursue his extraordinary goals.
Melancholy in atmosphere, the film focuses on Vincent's ascension
through a system that seeks to ground those who are genetically
deficient.  Danger presents itself for him in several ways.  A murder
at Gattaca makes Vincent the prime suspect, and he must summon all of
his wit to hide behind the facade of Jerome.  A slow-developing
relationship with a co-worker (Uma Thurman) may reveal his true
identity.  And there is also the uneasy relationship that he shares
with the real Jerome who at times seems unstable, cynical and
suicidal.
Jerome's character is fairly complex, who is a prisoner of perfection.
When they first meet, he displays his Olympic silver medal in disgust.
"I was supposed to be perfect, but only came in second.  How do you
expect to succeed," he asks.  Their relationship is one of the better
elements of this movie as both need each other to accomplish the
impossible.  However, other components of the genetic story line fall
short of their potential.  The storytelling is deliberate, but
ultimately boils down into a minor battle between the archetypes of
structure (Gattaca) vs. passion, intuition and heart, all of which are
embraced by Vincent.  Ethan Hawke does a good job emoting the
frailties of humanity against the lab-generated expectations of
perfection.  However, the script suffers from a lack of impact.  They
do well to give us a stimulating look into their antiseptic future.
Plausible and interesting, Gattaca poses what promises to be one of
the most complex moral issues that we will eventually face.  However,
the movie seemed unsure in its direction, and then ultimately decides
to "go Hollywood" by relying on a feel-good ending to wrap things up.
A tidy ending for such a tidy-looking movie?  That was a bit of a
shame when there were so many complex layers that could have been
further explored.
Science fiction in the movies has recently specialized in alien
invasions, but the best of the genre deals with ideas that peek into
our own humanity.  It was smart for this movie to stress character and
atmosphere over computer-generated effects.  The futuristic look is
also nicely accomplished.  Unfortunately, Gattaca only achieves a
slightly better-than-average composition.

Title
Review for Rounders (1998)
Poker players are a strange breed indeed.  If they can't find their way
to the poker rooms of the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City or to the fabled
Mirage in Las Vegas where the best players in the world sit down,
they'll still find a game somewhere.  Maybe it'll be in the back room of
some bar, or in the basement of some rundown building.  And never mind
the heavy smoke or cramped quarters or dank surroundings.  These people
are known as 'rounders.'  Poker to them is a delirious mix of
on-the-edge living and all-out warfare.  For these people, the rippling
of the cards is a call to arms, outplaying your opponents is the goal,
and stacks of chips become their ammunition.
"Rounders" offers a fairly accurate exploration of this hidden world
where fortunes are won and lost overnight and your only friends are the
cards in your hands.  Here, we meet up with Mike McDermott (Matt Damon).
He is a card-playing whiz who has been financing his law school tuition
through poker.  But one bad hand costs him everything, and he vows to
retire from the game.  Worm (Ed Norton) is his friend who was just
recently released from prison.  He also plays cards but wins his
fortunes through cheating.  He owes a lot of money to some disreputable
people, and Mike decides to continue to play in order to help him out.
The strength of this movie, however, does not lie within the story
between Mike and Worm.  For me, I was more intrigued with how it focused
on the shady, almost-invisible environment and how it highlighted the
many nuances that you have to master in order to play poker well.
Being a mediocre poker player who periodically plays the 10-20 Hold 'em
games at the Taj and one who can be labeled, to a certain degree, a
'rounder', the movie hits the mark in several areas.  We see various
types of players such as Kinish (John Torturro) who looks to win one or
two hands an hour in order to grind out a living and David KGB (John
Malkovich) who runs one of these poker rooms and whose weakness lies in
the way he eats Oreos.  The movie also accurately presents, through
narratives, the psychology required to win.  And it shows how playing
can suck you into a vacuum as you forget about everything else around
you.
I recall watching Maverick where the final few people played their last
hands.  One player held 4-of-a-kind; the villain held a 7-high straight
flush and the winner miraculously won with a Royal Flush.  Entertaining
- yes; realistic no.  This film could be considered the flip side of
that movie.  Authentic - yes; original - no.  "Rounders" is more
interesting than entertaining, but certainly one of the best movies
whose subject matter is poker.
Grade: (B-) if you don't play poker; (B) if you do.

Review for Cruel Intentions (1999)
Have you ever been so rich that the hardest thing in life was to find
new ways of entertaining yourself?  Forget about boring plays or
humdrum sports spectacles.  These venues are just the imagination of
someone else's world.  When you're incredibly rich and spoiled, you
can bring others into your world.  And in the world of Kathryn  (Sarah
Michelle Gellar) and her stepbrother, Sebastian (Ryan Phillipe),
theirs is a cruel game featuring a swirling atmosphere of deception,
tease, and sex.   
Schoolmates and acquaintances become their pawns, unsuspecting guys
and girls become casual targets of their sexual conquests and
manipulative whims, and those that find their way into their game of
one-upmanship will find it to be a ruinous experience.  For Kathryn,
she has set her sights on the sweet, incoming freshman, Cecile (Selma
Blair).  Her goal is to destroy her reputation.  It's not that Cecile
did anything wrong.  But  Kathryn's boyfriend recently ended the
relationship to be with her.  To usurp her in popularity is
unforgivable.  To exact revenge on him, she will befriend her while
secretly plotting her downfall.  Make her into damaged goods just to
hurt him.  And how will she strip her of her good name?  To start, she
gives her a personal lesson on how to French kiss and from there her
journey towards adulthood grows more lascivious. To further deflower
her innocence, she introduces him to the conniving Sebastian. 
Sebastian is quite the charmer and as a sexual conquest, she would be
far too easy.  He currently has his sights on Annette (Reese
Witherspoon), daughter of the headmaster at his expensive private
school and who was featured in a magazine article stating why she
wanted to remain a virgin until she got married.  `A paradigm of
chastity and virtue, she'll be my greatest triumph yet,' he boasts to
his stepsister.  Of course in this kind of film, you can't brag like
that without backing it up with a wager.  The bet is made and if
Sebastian fails, she wins his classic roadster.  But what if he wins? 
`Then,' says Kathryn while caressing herself, `you can have what
you've always wanted since our parents got married.'
By now, you probably have a good idea of what this film embodies. 
It's a film that is filled with twisted sexual innuendo and endless
seduction.  There's no doubt that this is a film for adults (with
adult-oriented language that is shocking yet forthright) even though
the stars are twenty-something.  But there's actually an entertaining
film in here that might surprise you.  The thing that I found
satisfying was how well it utilized its 100 minutes of film time. 
It's a tautly written and well-paced film.  We know that these two are
cruel and we know that someone's going to get hurt really bad.  The
story never detours or strays as it makes its way to its ending.  The
actors do well as people brimming with fake smiles, ulterior motives
and insincerity.  But it's not the acting that merits the
recommendation, although they Gellar and Phillipe carry themselves
confidently.  There's an undeniable sense style and wit that makes
this film wickedly fun and Machiavellian intentions that are
delectably cruel.

Review for Happy, Texas (1999)
Somewhere nestled in the heart of the Lone Star state
is a small town where the citizens are as close to one
another as they are to their own families.  This place
(and the film's title) is Happy, Texas. It's the
typical postcard-pretty, one-sheriff town where
everyone knows each other's name.  One of the biggest
events for this charming community is the Little Miss
Fresh-Squeezed Pre-Teen Beauty Pageant.  Every year,
Happy's adorable little girls compete for the right to
represent their town in a statewide competition if
they can win.  But year after year, the little girls
aren't up to snuff.  This year, Happy will be the host
town of this year's pageant.  Knowing how well they've
performed in the past, the local community leaders
decide that they need some professional help to ensure
a good showing.  They anxiously await the arrival of
two men, who are just as well known for their success
at pageant consulting as well as their outwardly gay
lifestyle.  What they unknowingly get instead are two
on-the-run escapees from a local prison.  How does
this happen?
Prisonmates Harry (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne (Steve
Zahn) escape from their prison van and manage to steal
a beat up RV.  What they don't know is that the RV
belongs to the two previously mentioned pageant
consultants.  Though Harry and Wayne try to drive as
far away as possible, their van breaks down nearby
Happy.  Chappy Dent (William F. Macy), the town's
sheriff happens upon them saying, we've been looking
for you.'  They are escorted back into town where the
two think that they are being arrested.  Totally
clueless about what's really going on, they soon learn
that they are actually being hired and are supposed to
be a gay couple.  This strikes them as totally
shocking.  They want to escape, but Harry notes that
the town's bank would be an easy target, so they
devise a plan to stay.  Harry will befriend Jo, the
bank's president (Ally Walker), as he figures out how
to execute the heist.  Meanwhile, Wayne will take on
the responsibility of training the girls for the
pageant.
This wild setup starts off a very funny movie that
mixes elements of mistaken identities and fish out of
water.'  Zahn is extremely funny as the loony convict,
Wayne, who can barely keep himself from screaming.  To
start the little girls' training, he sings `99 Bottle
of Beers on the Wall.'  Harry's job is perhaps not as
difficult because Jo needs a friend that she can
confide in.  She takes comfort in the fact that she's
gay.  She speaks her mind and lets him explore her
house, which is his opportunity to learn the
combination of the safe.  It is not surprising that
Harry begins to fall for Jo or that Wayne begins to
fall for one of the teachers.  But because everyone
thinks that they're gay, Harry and Wayne must be very
careful not to give away their true identities.  This
situation becomes painfully funny as the two continue
to mingle with the various townsfolk and push through
with their tasks.
"Happy Texas" is a good-natured story that puts two
completely unprepared people in a situation totally
beyond their control.  They wrestle with the absurdity
of their predicament and squirm with agony.  The
result is a film that is funny and amusing and one of
the real comedic gems of the fall season.  

Title
Review for There's Something About Mary (1998)
When it comes to matters of the opposite sex, there are two things that
I've always believed in.  First, you'll always go further when you
pretend to be no one else but your true self.  Secondly, guys who are
smitten basically become idiots.  "There's Something about Mary," in its
own perversely funny and raunchy way, illustrates these ideas.
Ever since high school, small-town boy and eternal doofus Ted Stroehmann
(Ben Stiller) has had a crush on Mary (Cameron Diaz).  Mary is a
vibrant, cheery and affable girl.  But she has a soft spot for those who
like her brother, a mentally handicapped and apish fellow who body slams
anyone that touches his ear.  The beginning sequence when they are both
getting ready to go to the prom is nothing short of unabashed stupidity
that will make you laugh or at least curl your face in shock.  But it's
just an appetizer to get you ready for the really weird stuff that will
follow.
Thirteen years pass since Ted last saw Mary, but he has always carried a
torch for his radiant high-school love.  Taking some advice from his
boss, he hires Pat Healy (Matt Dillon who looks like he was voted "Least
Likely to Trust"), an investigator of sorts, to track down Mary and to
report back on her whereabouts.  Healy is immediately smitten with Mary.
He discourages Ted about pursuing the matter, saying that she's now
overweight and has gone to Japan as a mail-order bride. Healy wants the
babe-alicious Mary to himself and moves down to Miami, uses his array of
listening devices to learn more about her, and tells her what she wants
to hear in order to capture her heart.  Ted, however, follows his heart
and travels down to Miami to find her nonetheless.  The rest of the
movie is a cute love story that focuses on Ted who tries to summon up
enough courage to reintroduce himself into her life.  Healy, however,
looks for ways to neutralize his competition.  And we are introduced to
several other crazy characters who all have their eye on Mary.
Diaz is appealingly charming and Stiller possess good comic timing, but
it is the relentless offering of gross-out humor and inane silliness
that propels this movie.  From the first face-curling moment, your
defense mechanisms quickly jumps into place and you want to decree that
you are above this ludicrous low-brow humor.  "How does a film maker
come up with this kind of material," you wonder.  A lot of the jokes
couldn't work if the camera work and the timing weren't perfect.  But
everything falls funnily into place.   As the pranks and the jokes and
the twisted humor begin to penetrate your defenses, you can't help but
say: "That was gross - hahahaha."  It was vulgar; it was tasteless; and
it was sick.  But I laughed...a lot.

Title
Review for Armageddon (1998)
The second movie featuring a big rock from space has hit movie theatres.
But despite the fact that this asteroid is the size of Texas and it's
imminent collision with Mother Earth would be so devastating that not
even bacteria would live, the movie's impact is surprisingly shallow.
Maybe it's because this movie comes only a scant 7 weeks after the
release of "Deep Impact", which had a very similar premise.   Or, maybe
it's because the movie makers tried to make this a fun film, but didn't
realize that rescuing humanity is not a lighthearted matter.  Whatever
the reason, the event that is "Armageddon" fails to live up to its hype.
There are only 18 days to impact when NASA learns of the oncoming
asteroid (their initial clue is a monstrous meteor shower that
pulverizes New York City with an awesome pyrotechnic display).  Pressed
for time and options, their desperate plan to save mankind is to drill a
hole into the core of the asteroid where they will lower and then
detonate a nuclear device.  If all goes well, the asteroid will split
apart and miss the planet entirely.  To accomplish this task, they
summon Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), the world's foremost deep core
driller.  He's the kind of man who only trusts himself.  He closely
guards over his daughter (Liv Tyler) and rejects her wishes to be with
fellow oil driller A.J. (Ben Affleck), who is skilled at drilling, but
takes unnecessary risks without concern for others.  Harry thinks that
she deserves someone better than a roughneck.  A.J. is just one of a
motley crew of roughnecks (all with cool nicknames like Bear, Rockhound,
and Chick) that will accompany Harry and make the dangerous journey into
space.  These guys are truly the wrong stuff and the government
expresses deep concern over mission leader and NASA chief Dan Truman
(Billy Bob Thornton) for endorsing this plan.  But there's no more time,
and there are no other options.
"Armageddon" is actually a pretty nifty piece of summer fare.  It has
lots of nice special effects, but isn't overrun by them.  The meteor
showers are a wondrous spectacle.  Their flight to rendezvous with the
asteroid is also visually impressive.  And the story, for the most part,
finds a nice balance between Stamper as leader of the team and leader of
his family.  Thornton's role is also a nice touch as the quiet hero that
tries to rise above the bureaucracy.  I also like Tyler's understated
courage at a time when the two men that she loves the most may never
return.
However, this film comes across feeling more like a casual buddy movie
rather than a tense thriller.  None of Stamper's crew seemed to
internalize the importance of the mission.  During the journey into
space, I kept waiting for one of them to ask if they could drive the
space shuttle for a couple of million miles.  And for people who are on
an asteroid hurtling towards Earth at 22,000 mph, they looked amazingly
at ease.  Another minus was that scenes on the asteroid moved so fast
that I didn't have time to think.  Camera shots changed so frequently
that the 'moment' couldn't be absorbed.  The asteroid sequence in "Deep
Impact" was far more exciting and better thought out.  "Armageddon" does
have its moments filled with courage, spectacle and awe.  But the
audience just never really has the chance to get involved.

Title
Review for State and Main (2000)
Things can get somewhat bizarre when a cynical
director, Walt Price (William H. Macy), experiences
increasing frustration as the deadline to finish his
movie approaches but all of his key personnel can't
seem to jell.  Top writer, Joseph White (Phillip
Seymour Hoffman), is suffering from a bout of writer's
block.  Lead actress, Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica
Parker) has major doubts about her nude scenes. 
Meanwhile, lead actor, Bob Barringer (Alec Baldwin),
invariably halts production because he has a yen for
teenage girls which leads to trouble with the law. 
"Everybody has to have a hobby," he tries to explain. 
His indiscretion has forced the movie company to
relocate to a sleepy Vermont town to finish shooting
their project.  But wherever they go, havoc continues
to ensue.
"State and Main" is a sharp satire about the
moviemaking business and some of the strange politics
and happenings that goes on offscreen.  Some of what
happens is the happy result of being in the world of
show biz.  Some of what happens is the diplomacy that
must be exercised by the director to pamper the
actors, soothe the townsfolk who are afraid of the
encroachment of Hollywood power, and save the company
from financial and public devastation.  Meanwhile,
some of what happens becomes fodder for tabloids.
This film's story touches upon all three of these
themes with the most enjoyable being that of the
writer who unexpectedly falls in love with one of the
townsfolk, Ann Black (Rebecca Pidgeon).  With similar
backgrounds, they are like kindred spirits to one
another.  Unfortunately, she is already engaged to an
ambitious politician who is very uneasy with the movie
company's presence.
The darkest sequence involves Bob Barringer and his
latest object of desire, Carla (Julia Stiles).  He may
have a weakness for young, beautiful girls, but the
odd thing is that she is just as saucy as he is weak. 
Inevitably, scandal rears its ugly head, and the first
one to jump at exposing any wrongdoing is the
aforementioned politician.
Of course, all of these crises must be handled
appropriately by the director.  With emotions ranging
from gentle coddling to unbridled hysteria, the
beleaguered Walt Price does what he can to ensure that
the production moves forward.  He'll do and say just
about anything to, for example, keep his lead actress
happy even though she protests the nude scene; coax
the easily wounded writer into massive rewrites; and
persuade prosecutors to look the other way.  "It's a
gift for fiction," he says.  And, when his actions are
not enough, the producer (David Paymer) jumps in to
verbally brawl with and intimidate anyone who
jeopardizes the production.
This is an amiable comedy about big time people in a
small town setting that showcases uniformly good
performances from its ensemble cast.  In particular,
Macy does a fine job at anchoring the film as he tries
desperately to keep the escalating production woes
from spinning out of control.  And while there is lots
of silliness in its satire, the subplot between the
writer and bookstore owner (amusingly named White and
Black) is also engaging and endearing.  You'll find
lots to like grin about in small town America, and in
particular, in a place called "State and Main."

Title
Review for Shakespeare in Love (1998)
Romeo, oh Romeo...wherefore art thou, Romeo?  Oddly, he might have
been shipwrecked on some deserted island and the butt of a hundred
jokes unless the struggling but well-respected literary mind of
William Shakespeare (Joeseph Fiennes) can somehow overcome a bout of
writer's block.  But as it stands, nothing is igniting his creative
flame for prose and his newest play is a half-baked comedy currently
entitled `Romeo and Ethel - A Pirate's Daughter.'  Alas, what's a
playwright to do?
`Shakespeare in Love' is an immensely satisfying story that follows
the distraught Bard through his period of uncertainty, discovery and
glory.  His spark is provided by the lovely Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a
charming and radiant woman who has a passion for plays and a fondness
for works previously written by Shakespeare.  There love for one
another is intense, passionate, and romantic in every sense of the
word.  Her presence and strength allows him to begin retooling his
comedy into what will eventually become `Romeo and Juliet.'  But his
goal of creating his greatest work to date is fraught with setbacks. 
Competition wants to derail his troupe of actors; Viola has already
been pre-arranged to marry a jealous suitor; and other factors develop
that threatens Shakespeare's work.  But through it all, he tries to
remain focused on his task at hand.  But creating timeless work
requires some help.   Rich supporting performances come from the likes
of Judi Dench as the sardonic Queen Elizabeth; Geoffrey Rush as the
investor who prays that the play will make money; and Ben Affleck as a
glory-seeking actor that is relegated to only a small role.  Each
added tremendously to the wit and dimension of this film.
I remember when I learned about Shakespeare in middle school, and it
was like learning a second language.  To this date the meaning of his
words still alludes me.   You can expect to find much of that
Elizabethan tongue present here in this movie, but the dialogue is so
rich and vivid that you can not help but awe at how romantic that
period must have been.  Paltrow and Fiennes are absolutely radiant and
have terrific chemistry together in their Oscar-calibrer performances.
 The story is marvelously contructed and strikes a rewarding balance
of pathos and romance as it presents a terrific story of love that
crosses the barriers of wealth, class and titles.  Doses of great
comedy trickle through the story, but the romance aspect and the
intrigue that accompanies it is satisfyingly unexpected and undeniably
sweet.  After I walked out of the theatre, I really wished that I had
payed closer attention to my Shakespearean lessons.  You won't find
many films that are better than this one this year.


Title
Review for Jane Austen's Mafia! (1998)
Stephen, please post if appropriate.
On a particular night when I found myself having some free time, I had a
chance to either go to sleep early or to see "Mafia!", a spoof of Mafia
and crime films such as "The Godfather," "Goodfellas" and "Casino".  At
84 minutes in length, I thought that I could enjoy a few laughs before
getting a good nights sleep.  But by my account, I think that my
laff-o-meter only registered a few grins, one giggle, and maybe one
chortle.
I suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable
Hollywood star, Lloyd Bridges, who just recently passed away and whose
last performance was in this film.  "Mafia!" chronicles Vincenzo
Cortino's (Lloyd Bridges) life.  Separated from his family when he was
young, he escapes to America and tries to live an honest life.  But as
fate would have it, Vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime
lord.  Following in his footsteps are his two sons, Joey (Billy Burke)
and Anthony (Jay Mohr).  Like all siblings in powerful crime families,
they squabble over power, the future of the family, fortune, and women.
"Mafia!" is co-written by Jim Abrahams, who also contributed to some
gut-busting funny spoofs such as "Airplane" and "The Naked Gun."  But
these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more
universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work.
As I write this, I also wonder how many people have actually seen the
movies on which this spoof is based.  Crime movies in general contain a
lot of profanity and violence.  It's a tough genre to parody.  I was
kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all
of those crime movies, maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say
"please" as they decide which sector to take over, but this opportunity
was never explored.   There were one or two moments that made me smile
such as the scene where Vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed
daughter-in-law.  A gunman shoots him several times.  The impact of the
bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding
band to change music styles to keep up with him, from the samba to disco
to the macarena.  I think that I just gave away the best part of the
film.  Oh well, that just means that you can go to sleep a little
earlier.

Review for He Got Game (1998)
"He Got Game" is the kind of unique movie that gives you a peek into a
world that few of us can ever be a part of.  It's real focus is on the
temptations that bombard Jesus Shuttlesworth (NBA star Ray Allen), who
has long endured a life of hardship but is on the verge of entering the
promised land.  Now, as the country's #1 high school player, he is
constantly being hounded by sports agents and college recruiters.  Jesus
is no longer just another person.  He has become a commodity, and the
trading environment is fierce and unscrupulous.  
The Governor, who is a huge college basketball fan, hopes that Jesus
will attend his alma mater, the fictional Big State.  The governor
offers a deal to Jake (Denzel Washington), Jesus' father, who is serving
time in jail.  Get him to go to his alma mater and Jake's sentence will
be reduced.  Jake is released for a week in order to persuade him.  But
Jesus hates his father, blaming him for the destruction of their family.
Jake is not only trying to convince Jesus to go to Big State, but also
wants to use his precious time to ask for his son's forgiveness and
impart a little advice as only a father can.  Much of this movie focuses
on Jake's poignant attempt to reconnect with his son and society.  He is
a simple man and looks for any glimmer of hope.  Jake also befriends an
abused prostitute (Milla Jovovich).  While this chance relationship may
clash with the rest of the film, it does allude to the tough choices
that we face in light of extraordinary circumstances.  He desperately
tries to reacquaint himself with his son, but Jesus is immersed in a
multitude of distractions.
Yet it's the other distractions that I found to be the most enjoyable
part of the film.  His high school coach bribes him.  The uncle who has
raised him buys a brand new Lexus leveraging Jesus' name.  The
girlfriend admits that high school relationships in general fail, and
pointedly asks why she shouldn't get anything for their time together.
A local Benz-driving, street hustler tells of the traps and pitfalls
that await those who approach fame and fortune too quickly.  There is a
terrific five-minute scene involving a fast-talking sports agent that
wants Jesus to turn professional under his tutelage.  The agent shows
off his collection of exotic cars and offers to give him a platinum and
diamond watch that costs more than a Corvette.  And there is also an
interesting sequence where Jesus is given a tour of a college complete
with parties, a glitzy presentation, and busty students who recruit
using their own unique methods.
He Got Game is partly a drama about a father that wants to reunite with
his son, but it's also a fascinating look into the competitive
recruitment process and about the transformation process that inevitably
accompanies impending fame and fortune.  The storytelling is insightful
and invigorating.  In the end, we learn that while we may become a
commodity to everyone else, we'll always remain a real person to our
parents, and this link to our humanity may be the most important thing
to have.

Title
Review for Scream 2 (1997)
Let me give you an example of just how deliciously nerve-racking this
film is.  As this movie opens, hundreds of patrons eagerly crowd into
a theatre, which is premiering a movie called "STAB."  It's an eerie
Rocky Horror atmosphere as moviegoers don unsettling ghost-like masks
and wield rubber knives.  "STAB" is based on the Woodsboro murders and
the series of events that transpired in the original SCREAM movie.  15
minutes into watching "STAB", a patron goes into the bathroom.  The
urinals are all being used by people wearing ghost-like faces.  He is
forced to use a stall.  Bad decision.  15 minutes into watching
SCREAM2, I had to go to the bathroom.  There I stood...all alone...and
I actually was afraid that I would feel a knife plunge through my
back.  Was this a strange case of life imitating art?  It was
definitely a disturbing feeling of deja vu.
The movie theatre incident causes several people to reunite, including
Gale Weathers (Courney Cox), who penned the book that ultimately
became "STAB"; Sidney (Neve Campbell), who was the intended target of
the Woodsboro killings; and Deputy Dewey and geeky Randy (David
Arquette and Jamie Kennedy), who were also lucky survivors.  Sidney,
now attending college, is also joined by her roommate, new boyfriend
and other classmates and sorority sisters.  It's deja vu for Sidney
and her friends too.  Under the assumption that this new killer is out
to finish what ended in failure at Woodsboro, everyone works as fast
as they can to try to figure out who the killer(s) is/are and
his/her/their motive(s).  Each one knows that they will become a
target.  Each one fears for their lives.  But these are a smart bunch
of people versed in the horror genre, and they make a valiant attempt
to outwit the killer.  But the killer(s) is/are also equally smart.
And this time, the killer is more merciless, resourceful, and cunning.
I liked a lot of things about this sequal.  The characters are
three-dimensional and don't succumb to movie cliches.  Women don't go
upstairs by themselves to check out strange noises.  There are no
empty-headed bimbos.  No one say's "I'll be right back", only to never
return.    Each character is smart and tries to take control of their
own fate.  The writing is witty and smart.  Also, the look and feel of
the movie takes the horror genre to an entirely different level.
Though it is nothing more than a simple horror movie, it looks like an
expensive movie with elaborate sets.  Each scene is
well-choreographed, nicely shot, terrifically edited and eerily
scored, which delivers some real heart-pounding moments.  You'll be
scared, you'll be immensely enraged when some of your favorite
characters become the next victims, and you'll root for the survivors,
hoping that they'll succeed.  There are also some terrific moments of
levity to savor, such as the new boyfriend trying to convince Sidney
that he is not the killer by doing a Tom Cruise impersonation and a
wonderful, developing bond between the arrogant Gale Weathers and the
meek Dewey, all the while the theme from Twin Peaks is playing in the
background.
One of its greatest accomplishments is for making us want to know who
did it and why?  Unfortunately, its dénouement requires us, to some
degree, to have seen the first movie.  Nonetheless, this movie
delivers in several satisfying ways, not the least of which is the
fact that it's just a plain, old, fun movie to watch.  It's not as
genuinely frightening as the first one, but it remains fresh and
exciting.  Probably it's greatest feat, however, is that we have a
sequel that is an equal to its original.

Title
Review for Avengers, The (1998)
Let me first get this out of the way.  I am deeply surprised at how a
film that has such a pleasingly inspired look and a cast of superb
actors can amount to such a summer dud.  There are plenty of things that
are wrong with this movie.  For example, before entering the theatre, I
noticed a synopsis of the movie sent from the movie studio which was
posted by the ticket counter.  It says that John Steed (Ralph Fiennes)
and Emma Peel (Uma Thurman), who are British super agents, were
investigating the murder of three other agents.  The odd thing was that
there were no such murders, the synopsis was completely wrong.
If you've seen any James Bond film, then you're already familiar with
the plot here.  British agents meet up with a deranged fanatic that is
bent on ruling the world. The villain, in a nice twist from his days as
the original James Bond, is Sean Connery playing evil aristocrat, Sir
August deWynter.  He formerly worked for the government and was one of
the instrumental scientists in developing the Prospero project, which
allowed a person to control weather.  If the worlds' leaders do not bow
down to him, he'll unleash Mother Nature.  And why is the filthy rich
deWynter doing this?  To perpetuate some philosophical dream?  As an act
of vengeance?  No.  Believe it or not, the answer is because he wants
MORE money.  He truly must be deranged.  Obviously, no thought went into
his motivations.
Much of this film seems bereft of thought and coherence.  Additionally,
we really feel nothing for the intrepid agents.  Valuing tea time almost
as greatly as saving the world, their demeanors come across as being so
nonchalant that it dampens any attempt to inject some energy into the
movie.  Indeed, there is this plastic-lawn-ornament sort of feeling that
wafts through the movie. 
I have a feeling that this movie was written by a very creative person
and a second-rate writer who, during the course of developing this
movie, never met.  Each was responsible for developing a certain aspect
of the film, and they decided to brush aside any continuity problems.
"The Avengers" is actually a slick-looking piece and offered some unique
sequences such as a climatic battle between Peel and an evil henchman
atop a series of high wires and an amusing chase sequence where the
agents are being pursued by mechanized giant wasps with machine guns in
their stingers.  And there was some great comic touches such as when we
see a high-level meeting among the bad guys who all must wear giant,
brightly colored teddy bear suits to hide their identities.  But even
this kind of costuming and the elaborate sets can't disguise the fact
that this is a poorly developed project.

Title
Review for Pushing Tin (1999)
In the crowded skies over New York City, planes fly dangerously close
to one another, but somehow manage to never collide.  In the film,
"Pushing Tin," hotshot air traffic controller Nick (John Cusack) and
new-kid-in-town Russ (Billy Bob Thornton) have an uneasy working
relationship that comes dangerously close to colliding, yet their story
never manages to make an impact.  What throws this film off-course? 
The answer is that the main story between these two could only muster
as much flight as the Spruce Goose.
Nick is the charismatic leader of a tightly knit clique of air traffic
controllers.  These ATCs safely guide in dozens of airplanes every
minute over the busy New York City skies.  Nick, who has a sharp mind,
an acute ability for spatial relationships, and a-mile-a-minute mouth,
easily tames the chaos and congestion overhead.  Looking at a dozen or
so scattered blips on his radar screen, he confidently blurts out
instructions to each of the incoming planes, urging them to change
course or speed.  It's an unenviable juggling act, and if he (or any of
the ATCs) can not perform at their highest level, a mid-air collision
becomes frighteningly likely.  As Nick relays instructions, the
scattered blips begin to take form.  What was just a disorganized bunch
of blips a few minutes ago has been transformed into a cadence of jumbo
jets making their final approach.  This guy definitely knows how to
push tin.
Nick's self-esteem is about to be compromised when Russ, a new ATC,
joins the group. He's an odd and quiet person who dons an Indian
feather.  But, he knows how to maneuver planes in for landings, and
he's really good at it too.  Russ's skill earns the respect of the
other ATCs, while his eccentric demeanor makes him 'interesting' to
Nick's wife (Cate Blanchart, the only bright spot in this film).  Nick
can't seem to handle his insecurity.  He begins a personal quest to
regain superiority, which will ultimately come at the expense of his
honor, integrity, and even his family.  Stories where a likable guy has
to regain his previous greatness after a horrific fall is always nice
feel-good film fodder.  But Russ is too subdued and is in a constant
state of Zen.  He doesn't seem like much of a threat and their rivalry
amounted to nothing more than a staring contest.  Nick's obstacles
didn't seem all that compelling.  Contrast his relative short journey
to the more challenging and ultimately more fulfilling quest of Jerry
Maguire.  Consequently, Cusack's character and his situation could not
draw us into his life-turned-upside down world.  
This mediocre rivalry and Nick's laffable ascension would make any of
us assume crash positions.  But hidden in this generally lifeless film
are some nice 'slice-of-life' elements replete with heavy
'Lon-Guy-Land' accents, confessions, and revelations.  I don't know
many air traffic controllers, but I bet that they lead some interesting
lives.  On a field trip to the control station, a bespectacled egghead
points out that ATCs are the most likely to commit suicide or suffer
from mental breakdowns.   At a picnic, wives identify themselves by
which number wife they are ("I'm his fourth wife"), giving us a glimpse
into the unique lifestyle of the ATC.  I liked these little snippets
and peeks into their lives.  The rest of the movie, however, is just
excess baggage.


Title
Review for Eyes Wide Shut (1999)
Stanley Kubrick has done something very impressive with `Eyes Wide
Shut'.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe it's the confidence
in which he carried out this project, seemingly unafraid of what stodgy
studio executives might think or the fact that this film might garner
the dreaded NC-17 rating (which it originally did).  Maybe it's the way
in which he directs Tom Cruise, stripping him of the surefire charisma
that has been the trademark of all his films.  Maybe it's the way in
which he presents the movie, not as a conventional story with
characters and plots, but rather as an exploration that doesn't (and
shouldn't) reach it's destination.  For all these reasons and more,
`Eyes Wide Shut' is an intriguing exercise in moviemaking.
But what is Kubrick's intention here?  Is it merely a film about sex? 
After all, it's hard to tell from the enigmatic movie trailer,
especially when passionate kisses are exchanged to the seductive tune
of Chris Isaak's `Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing'.  But don't think for a
moment that this is some creative attempt at soft-porn.  Rather, this
film is about missed opportunities and the chances that we take as it
pertains to one of our most basic of needs.  To that effect, this film
is more atmospheric and more like foreplay rather than the act itself. 
The film introduces us to William and Alice Harford (Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman), who are wealthy Manhattan socialites.  They attend a
posh party.  Alice is approached and propositioned by a suave foreign
guest.  Meanwhile, William has garnered the attention of two very
beautiful models that want to take him to the end of the rainbow.' 
This set of encounters leads to a frank conversation between the two
later on that evening.  While stoned on pot, Alice confesses her deep
attraction for a sailor that she met while vacationing.  She openly
laments how much she wanted him for the night and how ready she was
willing to give up everything just for that encounter.  William is
obviously a person who needs to be in control (one of his strange
power mannerisms' is to flip open his wallet to reveal his medical
license like an FBI agent whenever he meets someone).  This confession
has obviously rattled him.  He leaves his house, inflamed with images
of his wife making love to this stranger.  As he wanders the streets of
New York, strange sexual situations present themselves.  Each situation
represents a facet of carnality, but interestingly, each situation has
no obvious resolution.  We are to fill in the blanks.  Once again, it
is an exercise in exploration, and we are to draw our own conclusions. 
His odyssey through the night eventually leads him to an incredible
orgy where participants where masks, while ritualistic verses are
chanted (this is where you'll find the most graphic scenes).  This
20-minute sequence is nothing short of hypnotic.  Through it all,
William seems to adopt the look-but-don't-touch' principle.  He is an
observer, appalled yet fascinated while his fear is overshadowed by his
curiosity.
This is the kind of film that critics love to watch.  They will marvel
at his use of muted colors to symbolize the hush-hush nature of sex. 
Indeed, even a common kitchen looks uncommonly alive and his decision
to set this during Christmas allows for even more wondrous lighting
effects.  Critics can also applaud Kubrick for not making any
compromises while creating this film.  This movie is decidedly meant to
be viewed by mature viewers only.  I found this piece of moviemaking
bold and provocative.  Notice that I am not commenting on the story
itself.  I don't think that was Kubrick's focus.  The film sets out to
provide an atmosphere of mystery, and it does it very well.


Title
Review for Mod Squad, The (1999)
Here's a quick note to any motion picture company.  If you preface your
movie with a dictionary-like definition, you'd better be careful.  Why? 
Because when the screen displays this snippet of information, it demands
that we begin forming some kind of expectation about this film. In this
instance, the word is 'mod'.  Being mod is showcasing an
unconventionality that is unexplainably cool.  It's a mixture of
rebellion and style or perhaps tenacity and wit.  And the three members
of the Mod Squad do exhibit varying degrees of 'modness'.  Lincoln Hayes
(Omar Epps) sports wicked facial hair and drives a mint 70s Oldsmobile
convertible.  Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) is a baby-faced,
emotion-driven, loose cannon.  And Julie Barnes (Claire Danes) looks
fabulous in those hip-hugging pants that barely reach her waistline. 
But the film itself doesn't feel 'mod' as much as it does a patchwork
crime story with elements recycled in from other films. 
The story focuses on corruption within the police department and fingers
begin to point in the direction of these three kids.  It's easy to blame
these three young rabble-rousers.  They are all street-hardened kids who
quickly lost their way as they entered adulthood.  They've spent most of
their young adult lives in jail who have been recruited by the police as
special undercover operatives.  You see, normal policemen aren't very
cool, and these three have the ability to stealthily blend into places
that no others can, like illegal rave dances or clubs suspected of
fronting a prostitution ring.  But these three suffer a handicap, as
they come from broken families and a life of crime.  
Without a father figure and a sense of guidance, they're seemingly at a
loss as to how to determine the truth.  All they have is each other. 
And, I would have liked to have seen more dialogue explore their inner
thoughts and visions of their own personal sanctuary as they try to cope
with their precarious situation.  But the film was light on dialogue.  I
would also liked to have seen a modicum of police work, but it seemed as
if the result of their efforts came by way of luck rather than real
sleuthing.  There is just way too much screen time devoted to the
loneliness and despair that these three are going through.  It was
almost like watching a series of three-minute Ad Council commercials
urging children to stay in school or to stay away from drugs.  The story
also mixes in elements of a vast police department conspiracy, Julie's
ex-boyfriend who may or may not be as sincere as he seems, and a pimp
and drug seller whose inclusion completely bewildered me.  
Walking out of the theatre, it amazed me at how empty this movie was. 
It seemed as if the director was content on just having three
cool-looking actors strut in and out of scenes.  They yell, they scream,
they curse a lot, they give the occasional 12-step hug, and they're
scrappy enough to survive using only their wits.  But we never really
develop any kind of sympathy or attachment to any of the three.  The
villains were nondescript, and the story was equally flat.  It only goes
to show that looks aren't everything.


Title
Review for American Pie (1999)
I recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years.  It was a
period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me
into the unwelcome arms of adulthood.  But of all the experiences that
I collected throughout those tender years, I can honestly say that the
toughest and the scariest thing that I had to cope with was my raging
hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex.  Yes, more
scarier than my seventh grade English teacher and even scarier than the
bullies that constantly hounded me, trying to deal with my personal
wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster. 
For all teenagers, it's almost like a rite of passage.  And what we did
was sometimes downright nasty, sometimes funny, and sometimes shocking.
 And all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in
what might be the funniest movie this summer.
`American Pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that
enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school
year.  Just how great are their hormones raging?  One of them notes,
after watching Disney's The Little Mermaid, that Ariel is soooo hot. 
The four schoolmates are Kevin, Oz, Finch and Jim.  Kevin is the only
one with a steady girlfriend, but doesn't want to have sex until the
time is just right.  But what is the perfect time?  There is just no
way to know, and that frightens him.  Oz is the big jock who decides
that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be
more sensitive.  He joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that
getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages.
 Finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl. 
So, he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess. 
Suddenly, girls are lining up to go out with him.  But among these
friends, it is Jim that is the most curious and the most fearful.  When
he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student, his
inexperience comes shining through.  He has much to learn, and will do
anything to seek out this kind of knowledge.  This may include watching
scrambled porn channels or experimenting with Mom's apple pie in a
scene that is completely shocking, raunchy, yet unbelievably funny.
The one thing that I want to say about this film is that it well
deserves its `R' rating.  There is stuff in here that is completely
gross in the same manner that `There's Something about Mary' was
gloriously ribald.  In fact, at first this film received a sinful NC-17
rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a
teen-accessible rating.  But I guess after seeing the no-holds-barred
coarseness of South Park, this seems tame by comparison.  Teens and
anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will
laugh hardest.  But unlike many teen sex comedies, there is a genuine
intelligence at work here.  These are four normal boys who have a
natural curiosity about sex.  Their plans of action are thoughtful and
they think about the consequences.  They know what they want, yet
temper it with responsibility.  But almost always, it's impossible to
know how to fight the invisible monster, and it's these episodes that
make `American Pie' such a carnal delight to watch.


Title
Review for Almost Famous (2000)
"Almost Famous" is like sneaking a peek inside
someone's diary and taking a glimpse into their life. 
Diary entries, however, don't usually make for
compelling reading.  And, rarely does it fascinate
enough to joggle your imagination.  It is, after all,
a series of brief observations and perhaps a few
poignant lessons learned.  But if you're glimpsing
into the life of Cameron Crowe (writer/director of
this film who also wrote "Jerry Maguire"), you may
find it to be an interesting chapter about his life
when in 1973, he was an adolescent that was able to do
a few things that most similarly aged boys could only
dream about.
In this pseudo-autobiographical film, Crowe is William
Miller (played by newcomer Patrick Fugit), a 15-year
old prodigy who has a love for rock and roll.  He's
not the kind of wild-eyed teen who praises it by
singing its songs or mimicking its stars.  Rather, his
homage to it comes in the form of articles that strive
to explain what it's all about.  His writing ability
garners the attention of Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour
Hoffman), a powerful editor within the music
journalism circle.  Impressed with William's level of
insight and concerned about his impressionable youth,
he counsels the star-struck kid about the realities
and ethics that underlie the business.  He warns him
not to make friends with rock stars.  "They make you
feel cool," he imparts. "But I've met you.  And, you
are not cool."  Above all, Bangs urges him to be
honest and unmerciful.
William is well on his way and eventually catches the
eye of Rolling Stone magazine.  They ask him to write
a cover piece about Stillwater, a (fictitious) band on
the cusp of stardom.  With his boyish appeal and his
arsenal of music knowledge, the young reporter
immediately makes a connection with the band members
and they welcome him as part of the family.  Of
course, William is about to enter an environment
totally foreign to him, full of compromised values and
the allure of fame, giddy girls and drugs.  It will be
a tough journey ahead as he tries to complete his
article, find his moral bearings in his strange New
World, and hold on as he is rapidly ushered forth
towards adulthood.
During his time with the band, he experiences dramas
that no 15-year old is equipped to handle.  The
largest issue involves him, a fan named Penny Lane
(Kate Hudson) and Stillwater band member Russell
(Billy Crudup).  There is a love triangle brewing
here, although it never reaches soap opera
proportions.  But the theme runs throughout the film. 
There's also a drama about the Stillwater band itself
as it struggles through its period of growth and
increasing popularity.  There's another dilemma about
William's responsibility to report truthfully and the
fondness he has for the group.  And there are other
milieus that arise here and there as the story winds
its way to a close.  
"Almost Famous" will be more warmly received by
critics than by the general movie-going audience, like
me.  It has several interesting and charming segments.
 But, it didn't quite achieve the emotional
highpoints.  I could not fully buy into the emotions
that the band probably felt or even the wonderment
that young Williams experienced.  It just lacked a
needed dimension of eagerness.  And oddly, the film
seemed to want to open itself to much grander ideas
such as the tenderness of young love, the zeitgeist of
that turbulent era, or the evolution of rock. 
However, it remained in a bloated state of
self-absorption.  The pace is never quicker than a
stroll and the payoff merely satisfies (thanks
primarily to Frances McDormand's role as William's
rational mom, who anchor's everyone back to reality). 
But, the film doesn't gratify.  We certainly deserved
more.  

Title
Review for Deep Impact (1998)
When I walked out of the theater, I couldn't help but feel that I was
somehow cheated out of a grander movie.  There were lots of nice touches
that wanted me to embrace it and declare it as a terrific adventure that
would pave the way for the upcoming summer blockbusters.  But don't be
fooled.  If you look close enough, you'll see only a comet without a
tale.
The main focus of the film centers around a terrifying discovery that a
comet is hurtling towards the earth.  It is the size of Mt. Everest.  It
is characterized as an Extinction Level Event.  And if it hits, life as
we know it may end.  Morgan Freeman, an eloquent and believable
President, tells the public of the Messiah Project, which is a desperate
plan to save Earth.  A newly created spaceship manned by a young,
ambitious crew and venerable Spurgeon Tanner (Robert DuVall), will fly
to and intercept the comet.  They will land on it and plant nuclear
devices with the hopes of either destroying it or altering its course.
Meanwhile, back on Earth, the President prepares for the worst.  A
network of underground tunnels, called the Ark, is built.  However, it
can only support 1 million people.  A national lottery will be held, and
all of America can only hope that they'll be picked, knowing that most
of Earth's population will perish.
The Messiah team land on the comet and work frenetically to plant the
bombs.  Landing on the dark side of the comet, they have only hours to
complete their mission.  Once daylight bridges the horizon, the
temperature will soar to a scorching 350 degrees, and gases will spew
out from the surface making the still rock seem like a minefield.  This
sequence is by far the most exciting part of the film, but the rest of
the movie gets bogged down by burdensome sub-plots.  News correspondent
Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) is an up and coming reporter looking for her
chance to sit in the anchor seat.  The film devotes a little time to the
competitive atmosphere and her big break when she is the first to
uncover the story of the oncoming comet.  Leoni has good timing and
carries herself well.  Unfortunately, her story shifts abruptly, and now
we're introduced to her divorced parents (Venessa Redgrave and
Maximilian Schell) and the deep amount of hatred that she has for her
Dad because he walked out and married a much younger women.   We know
that they'll make up because when the end of the world is near,
reconciliation is not far behind.  There is also the story of young Leo
Beiderman (Elijah Wood) who discovers the comet.  He is guaranteed
entrance into the Ark and wants to save his junior high sweetheart who
was not selected.
Overall, "Deep Impact" is better than other movies of the disaster genre
such as "Volcano" or "Twister".   This movie has an understated courage
and I liked many of the performances.  I also liked the idea (though
underdeveloped) that this kind of event forced the characters, in the
face of imminent demise, to reveal their true colors.  This film could
have captured my imagination, but the reality is that it only deserves a
marginal recommendation.   It starts off great, but then leaves a
disappointing taste in your mouth.  Like many formulaic disaster flicks,
the focus of the movie moves too much from one silly story to another
and the only thing that manages to stay on course is the comet.

Review for She's All That (1999)
As Valentine Day approaches, it'll be natural for all of us to start
considering what movies we might want to see that will make us feel
good, feel happy, and of course feel a bit more romantic.  And for the
teenybopper set, this film does manage to accomplish its goals of
delivering a cute, albeit goofy, romantic comedy.
In `She's All That', we meet up with Zach (Freddie Prinze Jr.) an
admired student whom everyone else wants to emulate.   Good-looking,
loaded with charisma, and an all-around athlete, he has a good future
ahead of him.  But his popularity and perceived greatness may be in
jeopardy when his airy but sexpot of a girlfriend, Taylor (Jodi Lyn
O'Keefe), leaves him for another guy.  So, like all self-deluded, high
school seniors who believe that they are irresistible, he starts
bragging to his friends that he can have any girl in the school. 
Moreover, with a little guidance on his part, he can turn that girl
into the next prom queen.  Of course, this line of talking eventually
evolves into a wager.  And the one that has been chosen for Zach's
challenge is Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook), a bespectacled, mousy
art student whose oeuvre of work seems to represent only despair and
hatred.  `No way,' says Zach.  `She's scary and inaccessible.'  But at
the expense of suffering another setback to his ego, he begins the
process of turning the mouse into a queen.
The transformation process offers no surprises.  She's wary at first
but is curious as to why he's paying so much attention to her.  And
once she takes off those thick-rimmed Lisa Loeb-like glasses, gets a
new makeover and haircut, and develops an ounce of confidence, she is
actually very attractive.  Zach eventually sees something in her that
he's never noticed before, and she feels a never-before-felt sense of
attachment.  But whether they eventually wind up with each other or
not isn't as interesting as the peripheral elements of the movie.  
This film adds some very funny moments about high school life.  There
are the well-defined cliques such as the one whose most vital items
are lipstick and beepers.  There's the prom queen race between Laney,
who relies on the old-fashioned method of posters versus the filthy
rich Taylor, who gives away free samples of Latte.  The high school
seems located in a wealthy enclave of California.  I found it amusing
seeing how all of the students drove exotic cars and had parties in
houses that could hold 500 people.  And watching the climactic prom
scene, I couldn't help but grin as all of the students (who all look
like they're at least 23) broke out into a choreographed dance number.
 It certainly put my high school prom to shame.  Yet despite these
goofy moments, `She's All That' is a very, very lightweight movie. 
Zach was just too nice for us to doubt that there would ever be a
problem breaking into Laney's world.  And as we moved closer to the
prom queen elections, it seemed that there should have been more
showdowns between Laney and the bitchy Taylor.  But I guess as
February 14th approaches, no one really wants confrontation.

Review for Angel Eyes (2001)
Somewhere in the twilight zone of movies, huddled
around films like "Frequency" and "The Sixth Sense,"
you'll find ones very much like "Angel Eyes."   You
know the story.  A person is given a chance to make
things right courtesy of some unexplainable,
supernatural intervention.  
There's nothing wrong with a tale that revolves around
cosmic connections.  But we've charted this territory
before, especially in the case of co-star Jim
Caviezel.  His recent roles included a forlorn son
("Frequency"), a haunted homeless man ("Pay It
Forward"), and even a bewildered soldier ("The Thin
Red Line").  This guy has mastered the art of silent
torment.  And here, he has created a reticent wanderer
named Catch whose soul has been traumatized for
reasons that are not made immediately clear.  
His destiny lies with officer Sharon Pogue (Jennifer
Lopez), a feisty cop whose desire to fight crime seems
as if its some measure of her self-worth.  During one
of her frenetic chases, she is ambushed.  Out of
nowhere, Catch appears to save her.  Destiny has
allowed these two to meet, but it will take much more
for these two to truly connect.
Catch is unwilling to discuss his past.  But from
various clues, it's clear that he is either hiding or
trying to forget something.  Why is his kitchen drawer
stashed full of children's toys?  And, at a jazz club,
why does he deny knowing people that claim to
recognize him?  The mystery to Sharon and the audience
is maddening.  
Yet, we also learn that she is almost as secretive and
tormented when she reveals an episode that created a
rift with her father.  As a result, her defensive
mechanism forces her to assume the role of an
invulnerable, graveyard shift-loving supercop.  The
fortress that she has built around her heart is almost
as impenetrable as Catch's is.
For much of "Angel Eyes," the story delicately focuses
on the advances and retreats made by our couple.  They
first develop a cautious, arms-length relationship. 
But to get closer, they would need to break free from
their psychological bonds.   Neither one, though,
seems capable of taking that first important step.
The dramatic aspects worked better than the romantic
ones.  Despite being dubbed the World's Sexiest Woman
(by FHM magazine), Jennifer Lopez had a surprisingly
earthly quality and easily allowed us to sympathize
with her.  She effectively conveyed her sense of loss
underneath her on-the-job bravura.  Caviezal, again,
is reliably good as a member of the walking wounded.
Less convincing, however, was the romantic aspect. 
These two came across more like two lost children
holding hands while walking through a dark forest. 
They were better off as mutual supporters.  Lacking
sizzle, the love scenes then seemed something of
distraction.  
"Angel Eyes" has material that grabs our attention. 
But while it's interesting, it's never quite
compelling.  Some walls are just too tall to break
down, whether it's Catch's inner torment, Sharon's
sense of regret, or the film's desire to be more moody
than it really was.  But we can be grateful that they
tried.  As such, the film does just enough of the
right things to keep us engaged as we watch these two
navigate through their emotional mazes.

Title
Review for Contact (1997)
CONTACT: Some Signs of Intelligent Life
Jodie Foster plays Ellie Arroway, a prominent scientist and radio   
astronomer for the SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)   
program.  Like many scientists, she is an analytical person whose beliefs   
are entrenched in empirical evidence and testing.  For her, science shows   
us what is and what is not.  For example, she doesn't believe in God,   
because he can not be proven to exist.  Dr. Arroway is particularly   
isolated from the world around her.  She is consumed with one interest,   
which is the possibility of finding intelligent life on another planet.   
 Her academic mentors and colleagues belittle her.  Grant money to   
continue her research is increasingly hard to come by.
Yet she persists in her obsession, listening and monitoring and hoping   
until one day the payoff comes.   Working first at Puerto Rico's Arecibo   
observatory, budget cuts force her to relocate to the Very Large Array   
(VLA) of radio telescopes in the remote desert of New Mexico.  It is   
there, along with an ad-hoc team of devoted colleagues, that she detects   
a signal from the Vega system, some 26 light years away, that was clearly   
transmitted by an alien intelligence.  With the backing of the enigmatic   
industrialist, S.R. Hadden (John Hurt), she will begin a quest that   
culminates in the construction of a mysterious machine based on alien   
blueprints, and embark on a one-woman journey that will have the most   
profound scientific and spiritual implications for all humankind and   
especially for her.
Adapted from Carl Sagan's 1985 novel, this piece of science-pseudo   
fiction concerns itself with the discovery of extraterrestrial   
intelligence, but its focus subsequently becomes a debate between   
sanctity and science and Ellie's pursuit of her own brand of truth and   
her trip down the path of enlightenment.
Her quest is hampered by two major obstacles, though. She is faced with a   
lack of scientific thinking from politicians, who are wary of national   
security issues.  Confronted by a paranoid National Security Advisor   
(James Woods), Arroway's glory-hogging scientific rival (Tom Skerritt),   
and a cynical Presidential Advisor (Angela Bassett), Dr. Arroway fights   
hard to maintain her presence on this  the most important project of her   
career.  The story also sets Dr. Arroway in philosophical opposition to   
famous spiritual leader and advisor (and pseudo-romantic interest),   
Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey).  He tries to be her spiritual guide   
and warns her of the implications of making possible contact with a new   
race when she does not embody the precepts of God and His scriptures.  If   
there's life out there, way out there, does it come thanks to Science or   
Him?  It's an interesting question, but if  philosophers, scientists and   
theologians have been debating this question over the past 1000 years and   
are still unclear, a movie that attempts to look at the same question   
will suffer from ambiguity.
Despite a generally poignant look at Foster's journey into space and   
herself, I can't say that I liked this movie, but I didn't dislike it   
either.  Contact, results in a sobering look at a debate as partisan as   
abortion or the death penalty.  The space ride is just to appease the   
summer audience who demand to see special effects.  The entire movie   
seems like it could have been 20 minutes shorter if not for all of the   
flashbacks and the multitude of shots where Dr. Arroway is pondering and   
staring and pondering and then staring some more.  But, I did admire the   
genuine acting ability of Foster, who shows amazing depth and   
intelligence. Contact taps into her capacity to show both strength and   
vulnerability, pensive maturity and doe-eyed girlishness.  Time and   
again, the camera captures Foster face striking subtle emotions as she   
ponders all of the ramifications of her discovery and her subsequent   
actions.  There is probably no one better for this kind of high-minded,   
emotional drama than Foster.  I also admired the director's attempt   
(Robert Zemeckis) to blend purposeful storytelling with the movie's lofty   
goals (but his attempt to digitally meld Clinton into scenes a la Forrest   
Gump seemed patchwork).  Are science and religion equally purposeful   
methods of seeking reason and truth in a chaotic world?  This is a tough   
question to answer, but is bravely explored in this tale.  And, her path   
towards her particular enlightenment came to a satisfying conclusion.
Contact really puts the 'science' in science-fiction.  It is a big,   
ambitious movie that spans the heavens and debates God and hard science   
in the same breath.  Certainly, this movie will not appeal to everyone   
but to those who enjoy their movies with a pinch of philosophy, you'll   
find lots to think about.  It didn't necessarily appeal to me , but it   
did make me go , "Hmmmm"

Review for Alien: Resurrection (1997)
Will moviegoers ever get enough of these space creatures whose best
attributes are showing off their exceptionally sharp teeth and oozing
slime?  Not yet, it seems.  But that's ok, because this fourth
installment shows signs of life, and once again brings to us the macho
Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and pits her against those familiar
goo-dripping, acid-for-blood aliens.  
Science-fiction gives writers the latitude to come up with wacky
premises, and the premise here is certainly odd.  Despite its
viciousness and primal urge to kill, it turns out that some people are
enamored with this species and hope to breed more of them.  A complete
explanation is never really given, it may be a secret government
operation or a plan hatched by terrorists.  However, we are made aware
of a couple things.  All of the action will take place on a spaceship,
replete with the obligatory warehouse-like setting, dimly lit
corridors, and smoke billowing out from every angle.  Ripley is a
clone of the original (who died in Aliens3) who has heightened senses
(she can smell the presence of aliens) and some memories of her former
life, realizing all too well the dangerous implications of breeding
such a savage species.  Also, it won't be too long, despite careful
attempts to contain the aliens, before they will escape and run
rampant through the spaceship that carries them.  Their infestation is
actually startling.  As they begin to run amuck, the ships computer
states: "non-human elements detected on levels 2, 4, 5, 9..." and so
forth while the crew frantically makes their way into the escape pods.
However, as this genre mandates, there must be at least a handful of
people who have yet to escape.  Those still on-board include the
Ripley clone and an assorted bunch of grizzled space dogs, including
Call (Winona Ryder).  Naturally, there is no easy way off, and for
them, things will get much worse before it gets better. 
The true stars in this movie, however, are the aliens and the special
effects people that created them.  They are incredible to look at.  An
especially fine scene involves an underwater chase, where the aliens
swim in pursuit of their victims, subsequently climb a ladder and then
dodge bullets being fired upon them.  They are intelligent, merciless,
and genuinely imposing.  Less impressive though is the Ripley clone.
While she embodies the toughness of a soldier and the tenderness of a
human, the clone's persona displays a sense of annoying apathy.  She
blurts out cynical sound bites and laughs at the weakness of mankind.
Also, Ryder is a strange addition to this kind of movie.  Though she
is a wonderful actress, she lacks the heft and presence to stand
alongside Ripley and the other crew members.  
My feelings about this movie were undoubtedly mixed.  While I enjoyed
the beauty of the aliens, the moderate amount of excitement and the
enormous amounts of slime, Ripley's sense of detachment alienated me,
and soon, I found myself less interested in the final result and more
interested in seeing more aliens.  But I suppose that if the focus of
the movie was actually on Ripley, the title of the film would have
been called "Ripley: Resurrection."

Title
Review for Magnolia (1999)
Have you ever watched an advertisement on late night
TV, perhaps an infomercial, and wondered how those
guys could actually be the dynamos that they seem to
be.  I remember the incredulous pitches for how to
make millions in real estate.  The speaker would say
how he was once a penniless immigrant but now had
amassed a fortune.  With an ounce of ambition and his
tutelage, you too could earn enough to purchase
oceanfront property, a yacht, and a slew of exotic
cars.
In `Magnolia,' there is another such dynamo named
Frank Mackey (Tom Cruise).  With his high-powered
charisma, his ads boast that he can win over the
hearts of any woman.   And, if you come to his
seminar, he'll teach you all of his secrets.  Just
call 1-877-TAME HER and he'll show you all of his
tricks including how to feign sincerity and how to
make her fulfill your every desire.  This is truly a
person that has feigned much like the
once-penniless-immigrant-turned real-estate-mogul. 
The life that he has created is a manifestation of
terrific imagination.  He has worked hard to develop
an identity for others to see.  He says the right
things, wears the right clothes, and talks to the
right people.  But his whole life is nothing but a
fragile foundation of vanity and buried secrets. 
Unlock those secrets, and his foundation crumbles. 
What would make Frank's foundation crumble?  Perhaps
it will be an inquisitive reporter.  Or, it may be
confronting a father that had abandoned him but now
lies on his deathbed.  Neither Frank nor anyone else
can ever be prepared for such a jolt.
Frank's is one of many stories that are happening
simultaneously in the world of `Magnolia.'  Several
interlocking vignettes are at play, and all of them
are variations on a theme.  Julianne Moore plays a
neurotic and faithless wife.  Veteran game show host
Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall) has just learned that
he is suffering from cancer and doesn't have long to
live.  An overeager father (Michael Bowen) maddeningly
drives his son to excel.  Former whiz kid Donnie Smith
(William H. Macy) is a pathetic loser who thinks that
braces will help him secure the love of a muscular
bartender.  And there's also a caring officer (John C.
Reilly) who falls in love with a drug addict. 
Foundation shaking events will occur for all of the
characters. 
Structurally, this is a very good film.  Despite it
being a film where many of the characters are related
by coincidence, the film does an excellent job making
sure that all of the various story lines are working
in unison.  In fact, the middle hour showcases some of
this year's most energetic and extroverted acting
scenes, especially Cruise as the cocksure sex guru and
Moore as the unstable housewife.  And this why critics
will rally around this kind of film.  It's certainly
ambitious work and worthy of a nomination for Director
Paul Thomas Anderson.
However, my job is not to extol its production values
(which it has plenty of), but to let you know whether
this is a film that most of us would find
entertaining.  And to that, I would have to say no'. 
This is an Oscar-seeking melodrama, filled with
emotion, deathbed scenes and turbulence.  These
threads also converge in a way that I could not
understand, and should you wish to see this film, I
will have to let you draw your own conclusions.  As
for my own opinion, this is a 3-hour film that is
recommended to only the most avid moviegoers who like
their films to be a bravura combination of absurdity,
innovation and chance.  That's not me.

Title
Review for Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997)
Movies based on video games, such as Street Fighter or Mario Bros.,
have never generated much interest at the box office.  But when the
first Mortal Kombat movie came out in 1995, it did surprisingly well.
With a simple story, a pulsating soundtrack, and lots of awesomely
choreographed fight scenes, the movie moved quickly and displayed lots
of energy.  It got my vote for 'the movie where I expected the least
and got the most'.  And, if you haven't had the opportunity, I would
definitely recommend that you see it on video.
In the world of Mortal Kombat, based on the popular arcade game, dark
forces from Outworld try to infiltrate Earth's realm with the ulimate
goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity.  The Mortal
Kombat refers to a competition, fought by human mortals against
Outworld's minions, which if won, will guarantee Earth's safety for
another generation.  MK2 picks up almost immediately after the humans
return victoriously from competition.  Despite their victory, however,
a gateway has somehow opened, and Outworld continues in its quest to
conquer Earth.  Outworld's warriors  include an impressive collection
of fighters, including Shao Kahn, Mintoro (a centaur), Sheeva (a
four-armed ogre), and Sindel.  Earth's mortal warriors, under the
leadership of the benevolent God, Lord Rayden, includes Liu Kang,
Princess Kitana, Sonya Blade and Jax, who must fight against
Outworld's forces.
It's an easy enough premise, but unfortunately (very unfortunately),
the writers try to do too much with the movie.  It is only a video
game, after all, but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's
comic book boundaries by adding depth, a conceptualization of
self-worth, and worst of all, a love story.  This becomes very
awkward, because all of the players are fighters and nothing more.
They are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial
arts and fighting skills, but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable
when they are required to actually act.  This becomes embarrassingly
apparent, for example, as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond
between Liu Kang and Princess Kitana.  
The original MK was smart in letting the players do what they do best.
They spoke little, but fought a lot.  Thus, the movie was easy to
digest.  However, MK2 tries to give these players a certain amount of
depth, an element that was lacking in the first movie, but the attempt
here fails miserably.  This uneasy feeling is readily apparent, for
example, whenever you hear Lord Rayden speak.  Not only does he talk
in riddles and offer enigmatic (e.g. useless) advice, but he speaks so
slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom.  Try reading this half as
fast, and you'll hear what I mean.
But the movie is not a complete fatality.  Fight scenes are
well-choreographed, highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility.
And players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of
practically every character from the video game, although their screen
time amounts to nothing more than a cameo.  Even if you're not
familiar with the video game, each fighter has their own costume and
unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves.  But it's just too
little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will
expect.
Oddly, the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity
of the Mortal Kombat essence.  And the poor acting results in a
muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for
survival.  (I am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite
wisdom).  Rent the first one, but the sequel is for Kombat fans only.

Title
Review for Corruptor, The (1999)
Among the several friends that came with me to see this film, I'm
definitely in the minority when I say that there were some very good
elements about `The Corrupter' that merits the purchase of a ticket. 
But I have to caveat that by saying that to find these really good
elements, you have to be able to sit through a lot of bad elements.  
`The Corrupter' stars Chow Yun-Fat, an extremely popular Asian movie
star who possesses confidence, sass and style.  He transfers his
charisma successfully onto the screen as Lt. Nick Chen, a revered
officer that leads the Asian Gang Unit in New York City.  It's a very
tough assignment, and it's made no less difficult with the ongoing
power struggle between two rival ethnic Chinese gangs.  In one scene,
gang members bomb a small store with enough explosives to level a
square block.  When the half-alive, hapless victim stumbles out onto
the street, the gang members walk up to him and fire their weapons
until all of their bullets have been used.  The gang war is malicious
and body counts will continue to rise.
To help Chen, he is assigned green cop Danny Wallace (Mark Wahlberg). 
Chen looks at him with disgust.  He seems too soft.  But worst of all,
he's white.  It's a political decision within the force to bring in
Wallace.  Chen does his best to get him up to speed, although
grudgingly.  He saves his life more than once and tries to show him
the mentality of the Asian man.  In one lesson, Chen says while eating
his beef tripe soup, `if you want to be Asian, you've got to eat the
nasty stuff.'  Chen actually has some terrific scenes and his
character is complex yet well developed.  In fact, the Chen character
is what drives this movie. The movie itself plays out like the typical
story of two dissimilar cops who constantly bicker as they make their
way to the final showdown.  At some point, their relationship does
take an intriguing turn.  But the plot becomes mired in twists and
revelations that make the story too difficult to follow.  Heavy
accents also make some of the dialogue incomprehensible.  
The real joy of the film is Chen's character. He is a minority police
officer that has overcome many glass walls in trying to establish
himself but has trapped himself within the politics of the Asian Gang
Unit along the way.  We learn about his thought process, his secret
involvement with the rival gangs and even his poignant relationship
with a prostitute who is a victim of the gang's prostitution trade. 
Wahlberg's presence makes a nice counter story as he is also new to an
unfamiliar territory and needs to find ways to prove his worth.  But
his acclamation process onto the team is a series of coarse statements
by fellow Asian officers.  Among other things, they compare their
manhood, and I can only guess that these officers never saw `Boogie
Nights.'  Alas, I'm torn.  There was so much to like about the
characters, but so little to praise about the story.  Still, I'm
giving this a marginal recommendation, because I think that Chow
Yun-Fat deserves a nod and there seemed to be something definitely
good in there, but never had the right focus to get out.  Too bad.


Title
Review for Blair Witch Project, The (1999)
It's been a few weeks since this much-talked about film has been
released.  I've heard how critics have labeled this as the scariest
movie in the last 20 years.  I've heard how much the material is
unsettling.  And, I've heard that many people suffer headaches after
watching this film because the footage is shot using hand-held cameras
and thus the picture is shaky.  And after absorbing all of these tales,
a general sense of eerieness began to stir within my stomach.  I became
more curious to know about the Blair Witch Project, yet I was also
afraid at the same time.  This fear was probably caused by a
combination of anticipation and anxiety that manifested within mind.
When you don't know what to expect but only know that it's something
that can only be tremendously frightening, that's the most intense fear
that you can have.  It eats you, it taunts you, and it drives you mad. 
In `BWP,' three students shooting a documentary mysteriously disappear
in a heavily wooded area in western Maryland.  A year later, the video
footage is found, and the events that you see are supposedly the last
days that the students were ever seen again.  Heather, Josh and Mike
are all excited to be a part of this project.  It should only be a day
or two of interviews with the local denizens of a small town where the
Blair Witch myth has had the most resonance.  After that, the three
would travel into the woods to see if there's any evidence to
substantiate the statements made by the local folks.  Most of the
townsfolk dismiss the Blair Witch as just folklore with no basis in
fact.  But they do come across a few that are more cautious with their
statements.  `I don't really believe in her, but I do believe enough in
her to know not to go into those woods,' one woman says.  Another
eccentric woman tells of how she once saw the witch and described her
as a haggardly old woman covered with fur that seemed to float on air. 
The Blair Witch may be nothing more than fodder for tabloid newspapers
or perhaps a story similar to that of Bigfoot.  Nonetheless, the three
pack up their gear, and begin to explore the deep woods where the Blair
Witch is said to roam.
Their situation quickly worsens.  They lose the map, they begin to hear
unexplainable sounds in the dead of night, and when they wake up they
find evidence that someone has been there.  After much pleading by a
frightened Josh and Mike, Heather believes that the best thing to do is
to leave.  But no matter what they do, they seem to always make the
wrong choice.  They walk around in circles as they fall short on
supplies as well as morale.  Soon, they fear that they are being hunted
by something unseen.  The fright factor begins to quickly escalate as
each one slowly turns on one another and as each begins to lose their
own sanity.  Fear is slowly settling in, and the transformation is
utterly disturbing.
What makes their fear that much more gripping is that they have no idea
what's out there.  The otherwise pristine woods transforms into an
unsettling landscape as branches cast strange shadows, the leaves
ruffle in a most disconcerting way, and the howling wind sounds like
cries of help possibly from the tortured victims of the Blair Witch. 
Their flashlights can not see far enough into the distance.  When they
run, the cameras are focused at the ground, which doesn't allow the
audience to see where they are going.  This is equally frustrating and
frightening.  Like me, their fear was probably caused by a combination
of anticipation and anxiety that manifested within their minds.  Is
there really anything out there?  No one can be really sure. 
Regardless, I found myself turning my head several times to avoid
seeing what was on the screen.
With its documentary-like style, the plight of the students (though
completely fictional) seems very real, as does the fear that they (and
the audience) experience.  Unlike conventional scary movies like
`Scream' where scenes allow us to shriek in delight, the audience
uttered not a sound  complete dead silence.  The film is not about the
Blair Witch itself, but rather how fear overtakes us, strips us of our
sanity, and reduces us to shriveling weaklings.  It's haunting, it's
frightening, it's gripping and it deserves a strong recommendation. 
But be warned, for even now I am still chilled by the film.

Review for Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999)
`Thomas Crown'  An Affair to Remember
The summer is getting crueler everyday.  As temperatures and humidity
rise, it becomes tougher to find relief from the hot weather.  Perhaps,
our only salvation may be the local Cineplex where we can recline in a
nice chair in a comfortably air conditioned theatre.  But what is there
to see?  I don't want to be mesmerized by swirling special effects.  I
don't want to be sitting on the edge of my seat as fear courses through
my body.  I don't want to watch a comedy.  Just give me an
old-fashioned story that's clever and stylish.  Just give me a film
where the strength of the characters is what carries the film.  Just
give me a film that satisfies from beginning to end.  Just give me `The
Thomas Crown Affair.'
Cool, slick and fun to watch are how I would characterize this remake
of the 1968 classic (then-starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway). 
Here, we see the ever-suave Pierce Brosnan playing the
millionaire/thief and the formidable Renee Russo as his adversary. 
Thomas Crown has got to be every woman's (and probably a lot of men's)
fantasy.  He's rich, handsome, and put the class' in classic. 
Impeccably dressed and a shrewd businessman, he knows what he wants and
has the means to get it.  What can his money not buy?  The answer is a
priceless Monet painting that he so adores, which hangs at the heavily
guarded museum.  An elaborately engineered and extremely clever heist
is pulled.  The improbable theft brings Catherine Banning (Russo) to
town.  She works for the agency that insures the irreplaceable art
piece.  And if she can locate it, she'll be rewarded with a $5 million
finder's fee.  It doesn't take too long before she is convinced that
Crown is her man.
Crown is no wimp.  He teases her, charms her, and practically dares her
to find the painting.  Banning is up to the task.  She receives some
help from the local police detective (a surprisingly terrific Dennis
Leary), but for the most part, she employs her own brand of sex appeal
and smarts to get the job done.  Banning makes it very evident that she
is quite confident in her abilities (and not just her investigative
abilities).  You'll see her at a formal party dancing in a sheer black
dress that shows that she doesn't favor any sort of undergarments.  And
she'll sunbathe in the nude without even thinking twice.  Indeed,
Banning is sexy, smart, and strong.  It's refreshing to see such a
strong female character.
The screenwriters do a fine job of creating two wonderfully competitive
characters, both of whom do what they can to stay one step of the other
person.  Both Brosnan and Russo have amazing screen presence.  The
balance of power swings back and forth like a pendulum, but the movie
hums along as both Crown and Banning take immense satisfaction in the
chase.  An attraction develops and both find themselves faced with the
ultimate challenge.  Both want the Monet.  Both want to keep each
other.  But you can't win one without losing the other.  Handsome to
look at and fun to watch, `The Thomas Crown Affair' is the perfect
summer escape.

Review for Red Planet (2000)
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.  He's as ugly as a
cactus and as charming as an eel.  Living atop the
windy peak of Mount Crumpit, he peers out onto the
town of Whoville far below.  He's a solitary
curmudgeon whose sole source of enjoyment comes from
making life miserable for others, especially during
the holiday season.  Loathing their Christmas spirit
with their bright lights, non-stop singing, gift
giving, and general sense of gaiety, he devises a plan
to rob Whoville of their most precious holiday.
However, his foul mission is thwarted by the
kindhearted actions of little Cindy Lou Who (adorable
Taylor Momsen).  In a chance encounter with the Grinch
(an unrecognizable Jim Carrey), she believes that he's
not all bad despite what the rest of the town thinks. 
With her wide-eyed innocence, she hopes to bring out
his warm side hidden under all that green fur and
callous demeanor.
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a slightly revved
up version of the Dr. Seuss bedtime classic. 
Richly narrated by Anthony Hopkins, the film follows
the original basic outline.  However, it comes up
short on imagination and has lost a touch of its
sentimental spirit. 
You would expect more in terms of design, considering
the Grinch universe takes place within a snowflake. 
The Whoville denizens look and act like mannequins. 
They possess hog-like snouts and sport a hairstyle
that looks like it was the result of a passing
cyclone.  And for a town that seems to be in a 24/7
preparation mode for Christmas, the whole place looks
oddly somber.  There is a noticeable lack of primary
colors, the palettes seem muted, and the entire set
design seems like something out of Candylandor the
backlot of Universal Studios.  Of course, there are
some terrific special effects.  And its strongest
segment occurs when the Grinch goes on his raid during
Christmas Eve.  He employs a giant vacuum to suck out
the goodies, unleashes moths to eat the hanging
Christmas stockings, and even steals the visions of
sugarplums dancing in their heads.  But up to that
point, there's very little magic in the air.
Another shortfall was that the film didn't do enough
to generate enough sympathy for the Grinch.  Yes, we
learn of the Grinch's past and the root of his hatred
for Christmas and Whoville, but it spends an
inordinate amount of time establishing his meanness. 
This disqualifies the film from being a wholesome
child's tale, and moves it into dark territory that
may leave wee ones confused. Among other things, he
pushes little kids to the ground during a sack race
and eats shards of glass while he plots against the
town of Whoville.  This is a bad hero/role model for
children if they tend to mimic what happens on-screen.
Yet, the film has flashes of creativity, and kudos are
in order for Jim Carrey who worked exceptionally hard
to pull off this almost-impossible role.  Despite
being mummified under that green suit, he still
applies his unique brand of physical comedy while
snarling, growling, and scowling, and does his best to
show us a good time.
The movie does have its funny moments even if its
grander aspirations are unrealized.  
But it needed to be brighter to captivate and more fun
to enthrall.  
Like the Grinch who felt hatred towards those who had
him ostracized,
This film's heart is two sizes too small.

Review for Wings of the Dove, The (1997)
Whenever I watch a film that boasts period costume pieces and whose
central characters are primarily English aristocrats, rest assured
that the core of the movie will be a heavy-minded drama.  Frequently,
the story focuses on elements of debauchery and deception.  The burden
of relaying the fears and joys and tension that inevitably exists lies
not only on the shoulders of the characters and their ability to
involve us in the story, but also on how the movie skillfully unfolds
itself to reveal the characters' motivations and intentions.  Here,
the cast does a fine job in reaching out to our emotions, but the
movie unfolds too quickly, which tells us too much too soon.
Set in the early 20th century, we meet up with Kate Croy (Helena
Bonham Carter), who is secretly engaged to Merton Densher (Linus
Roache), an underpaid writer and commonfolk.  Kate is under the care
of her wealthy socialite Aunt, who adamantly insists that she marry a
man of higher standing.  If not, the Aunt will not only cut her off
from her generosity, but will also cease to support Kate's father, who
has fallen onto hard times.  Kate has what amounts to a tenuous
foothold in society, but her heart belongs to Merton.  She has a
burning love, but no money.  
Kate eventually befriends a very wealthy, American girl.  Millie
Theale (Alison Elliott) is a lonely American heiress who has money but
no love.  She is also dying from a rare ailment, which reinforces her
drive to find love before her death.  As Kate and Millie continue to
bond, Kate sees that this doe-eyed girl may hold the key to breaking
free from her Aunt's rule.  With the help of Merton, they formulate a
dastardly and unforgivable plan.  But they are scoundrels of love, and
it is this kind of delicious balance that gives it dramatic juice,
allowing the characters to be simultaneously tender and cruel.
But the sin of the movie didn't rest with the characters; rather, it
rested with the movie itself.  Within the first 30 minutes, it told us
everything that we needed to know.  But as the film moved into its
final 60 minutes, when the three main characters decide to take a
vacation in Venice, it seems as if we go along with them as
vacationers as well.  Progress is slow, and the meaty scenes become
heavily interspersed with scenic shots of the Basillica, street café's
and the Venetian waterways.  Also, the direction of the film looked
and felt more like a stage play rather than a cinematic offering.  And
since we know where the story is heading, we are on cruise control for
much of the film until the final few scenes where any remaining
conflict is resolved.
The Wings of the Dove has a lush yet aching beauty that is both visual
and dramatic.  Also, Helena Bonham Carter brings to her role an
incredible sense of maturity as a woman who is as earnest as she is
conniving (Best Actress Oscar contender).  Despite this bold effort by
all, the award for 'greatest effort' will ultimately go to the
audience member who must sit with their legs crossed as they patiently
wait for this film to end.

Review for Wag the Dog (1997)
It's just days before the Presidential election, and the incumbent is
enjoying a slim lead over his opponent.  However, a scandal hits the
White House while the President is away.  A Firefly girl (similar to a
Girl Scout) accuses the President of sexual misconduct.   Tabloids
will feast on this development.  His opponent makes every opportunity
of it to drag him through the mud in his own bid for the presidency.
The country is aghast.  Trouble looms large.  Who ya gonna call?
Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro) is the man that you want.  With a knack
for misdirection and strategizing, he must come up with some kind of
plan to divert America and the media's attention just long enough for
the President to win another term.  But desperate times call for
desperate measures, so with the help of a White House aide (Anne
Heche); crafty movie producer, Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman); and an
overzealous marketing pro, Fad King (Dennis Leary), they begin to
concoct, develop, and refine a lie that must not only be
extraordinary, but also believable.  Indeed, these spin doctors have
the unenviable task of trying to spin gold from straw.
"Wag the Dog" is not what I would characterize to be a comedy or a
drama.  It plays out more like a melodrama that focuses on
quick-on-your-feet cunning displayed by those spin doctors, who are in
essence idea hamsters (their brains are constantly running).  We sit
in our chairs and observe how the characters on screen react to the
various crises that arise.  They are like pinballs, bouncing and
ricocheting from one idea to another as they try to pull off the
greatest of illusions, yet make it seem soberingly realistic.  
What I found particularly interesting (or scary) is how these two work
to bring about plausibility. Brean, skulking and ever-molding his
political machinations, is adept at manipulation.  Meanwhile, Motss
knows that there's a way around every problem.  Whenever there is a
kink in their plans, he boasts with deluded optimism: "It's nothing!"
And, voila, another plan is in place.  In doing so, they
simultaneously attempt to bolster the President's ratings, increasing
America's moral, and evoke a satisfying sense of jingoism.
"Wag the Dog" is blithely acted but will not leave any kind of impact.
Still, this film has its merits.  It is an odd lesson in politics.
Particularly, it offers a look at the people who are behind the
scenes.  They may be the most powerful people in the world who not
only have carte blanche status but can also shape the opinions of the
mass public.  Are we as truly as informed as we would like to think?
Perhaps after seeing this movie, you'll understand what 'wagging the
dog' really means.

Review for Down to Earth (2001)
Here's a little bit of film history.  In 1941, a
well-received film called "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" was
released, which told the story of a boxer who
accidentally dies before his time and is reincarnated
in the body of a murdered millionaire.  Decades later
in the late 70s, "Heaven Can Wait" was released, which
told the story of an NFL quarterback who accidentally
dies before his time and is reincarnated in the body
of a murdered millionaire.  Now, we have "Down to
Earth," which tells the story of a comic that
accidentally dies before his time and yada, yada,
yada.
This tepid little reincarnation of two arguably much
better films focuses on struggling comic, Lance Barton
(Chris Rock).  His ultimate goal is to perform at the
Apollo theatre without getting booed off the stage. 
But he is prematurely sent to Heaven.  Too bad for
Lance.  Now, he'll never get to make that appearance
and he won't be able to meet that cute girl that he
saw crossing the street.
Even Heaven makes a mistake now and then.  Yet, while
he can be returned among the living, he can't have his
old body back.  That's just the way it goes, and with
the help of two Angel chaperones (Eugene Levy and
Chazz Palminteri), they help Lance look for a new one
to inhabit.  
Lance finally settles on the body of billionaire
Charles Wellington after discovering that he is the
object of attention of that aforementioned cute girl. 
He not only gets a rare second chance to make good on
his unfulfilled dreams of stardom but also gets the
opportunity to affect some positive changes on the
lives that he touches.
There's no burst of creativity here.  You'll also be
disappointed with its screenplay, which is
unforgivingly underdeveloped.  One of its two major
sins is that there are too many elements that are left
dangling.  Foremost is the fact that
Lance-as-Wellington, along with his money and power,
can really do some good.  But, everything that he says
and does seems to be just an excuse to test out his
comedic material.  At a board meeting regarding the
privatization of a community clinic, for instance, he
enters a Johnny Cochrane state-of-mind.  "If he's shot
in the head; give him a bed.  If he's bloody; he's our
buddy," he riffs to the dismay of the greedy
stakeholders.  This is funny material that establishes
Rock's comedic presence.  But, it doesn't take the
movie anywhere.  Why can't he make those
white-collared pruneheads see the error of their ways?
A more shameful sin, though, is its lack of funny
moments.  Rock has three or four decent sequences that
make us smile.  It's cute watching Lance-as-Wellington
(who is seen as a white, portly, balding, 50-year old
man) sway to rapper DMX and 'act black' in Harlem. 
But the film spends too much time making Rock, whose
acting seems amateurish, into a romantic leading man. 
Part of the problem also lies in the fact that this
film is rated only PG-13 while the amiable comic with
eyes-bigger-than-a-cue-ball and
teeth-as-bright-as-a-flashlight does his best stuff in
an R-rated environment.  Here, he looks desperate to
utter the "F" word.  What we get here is a manic comic
that is unfairly restrained, a story that has too many
loose ends, and a film that only Chris Rock fans would
really enjoy.

Review for Gladiator (2000)
`Gladiator' is a story that roars one simple message. 
And that message is `Charge!'  This film steadily
rushes towards you like centurions on a chariot.  Fun
summer movies are about being visceral delights.  And
this one delivers.  Heroic in tone, epic in scope, and
far from bloodless, the summer's first
blockbuster-to-be is a grand tale of Rome,
retribution, and requital.  
The film opens with an ambitious battle sequence.  `At
my command, unleash Hell,' says the film's hero,
General Maximus (stately Russell Crowe).  Maximus
leads his legion of troops into battle, masterminding
an important victory for the glory of Rome.  His
continued leadership has brought him the admiration
and love of the current but aging Emperor, Marcus
Aurelius (regal Richard Harris).  A benevolent leader
with noble visions of Rome's future, his final hope is
for Maximus to succeed him when he dies.
This decision infuriates Aurelius's tempestuous son,
Commodus (darkly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix). 
Consumed with jealousy, he attempts to destroy Maximus
and his family before ascending the throne himself. 
The crafty General manages to escape, but his family
is not as lucky.  
Stripped of everything he loves, he is captured by
slave traders and then subsequently sold to Proximo
(Oliver Reed), a businessman who specializes in
training Gladiators. In the training arena, Maximus
filets his opponents as easily as Japanese chefs filet
fish.  But he is also taught that he must win over the
crowd if he is to truly win the match.  
As a victorious and popular gladiator, he will travel
to Rome to perform in the Colosseum.  As a man with a
noble heart, his personal crusade is followed with
much interest.  As such, he garners support from
fellow gladiators (including Djimon Honsou), a former
love/Commodus's sister (Connie Nielsen), and a
civic-minded Senator (Derek Jacobi).   He looks for a
chance to avenge the death of his family, restore his
honor and posthumously bring forth the vision of
Emperor Aurelius.  
To enjoy `Gladiator' fully, find a big screen with a
good sound system.  There is an array of impressive
combat sequences with equally imposing sound effects. 
When you hear a battle axe being thrown, you might
want to look over your right shoulder just in case. 
Cinematography is also beautiful.  From its renderings
of ancient Rome to the way hues are incorporated into
scenes (for example, gray hues magnify the bleakness
of battle while rich amber hues reflect the lushness
enjoyed by the nobility), careful attention is taken
to immerse the audience in the movie-going experience.
 And the 165-minute saga of Maximus is stately and
absorbing.  Crowe is a gladiator's gladiator and he
brings depth and feeling to a new breed of action
heroes.
Yet, I have two reservations (no spoilers given).  The
first was that Commodus was seemingly baleful, but his
actions took a backseat to his psychotic personality. 
He was all talk but a man of little action.  When the
final showdown occurs, the audience doesn't view him
as much of a threat.  A greater reservation, however,
was the pace of the final act.  So much momentum was
building towards the finale that its ultimate
resolution seemed like an apology from the director
because they couldn't secure enough financing to
finish it with the same kind of epic battle that
catapulted its beginning. 
But these are just minor points in an otherwise grand
story.  `Gladiator' is spectacular summer fare.  Its
tale is engaging, its presentation is bold, and it
certainly sets the bar for summer movies at a high
level.

Review for Lola rennt (1998)
I don't know about you, but it's been at least a month since I've seen
a memorable movie.  And I've seen a fair number of films these past few
weeks.  None of them have really stuck in my mind; I can't even recall
the film titles.  Sure, there was the sophisticated Thomas Crown Affair
and the eerie Sixth Sense.  But these screen gems were released back in
mid-August.  For the avid moviegoer, there is a drought of good films
much like the water shortage that we've been experiencing recently in
the Washington DC metro area.  
This week's new releases fail to offer much promise.  Although I
haven't seen any of them yet, the feedback for Stigmata, Stir of
Echoes, and Love Stinks has been generally disappointing.  Gee, what
are intelligent moviegoers like us to do.  Well, let me thank my best
bud, Daniel, for bringing a clever foreign film to my attention.  From
Germany, the film is called `Run Lola Run.'  It's certainly the most
quenching alternative to the recent spate of dry Hollywood offerings.
The story features the rebellious looking Lola.  She's a spunky girl
with flame red hair who has to find a way to help Manni, her
small-time, gangster boyfriend.  Manni has somehow lost a bag of dirty
money that was entrusted to him.  If he can not make the delivery in 20
minutes, he will meet a horrible fate.  Lola begins a mad sprint across
town in a desperate attempt to collect the amount that he lost.  The
storyline is fairly simple.  And that's good, since the movie is in
German with English subtitles.  But the film is more than the frantic
marathon that Lola undertakes.  The filmmaker also introduces a
dimension of what if' and how her actions influence not only her
destiny but others as well.  What if Lola took a little longer to
complete her run?  What if Lola made a left instead of a right?  What
if Lola talked to this person and instead of that person?  Several
scenarios are played out and we can only hope that through some miracle
and random luck that Lola and Manni will live happily ever after.
While the presentation of multiple timelines is not something new
(remember Sliding Doors or even the Back to the Future series), the
presentation was very clever and original.  The first one-third of the
film is a high-octane tour de force that melds high-energy performances
with MTV-chic cinematography.  The feel is undeniably kinetic. 
Strobing images, wild camerawork, and a heavy Euro synth-pop soundtrack
all lend to its youthful appeal.  Meanwhile the dialogue is thoughtful
so that this doesn't become a victim of style over substance.  My only
negative remark is that 90% of the `wow' factor occurs within the first
third of the film.  When you enter the final scenario (there are three
of them), some of the luster begins to quickly wear thin.  Alas, not
even Lola can run that fast forever.  As a foreign film, `Lola' will be
hard to find.  But catch her if you can.

Title
Review for My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)
Julia Roberts plays a confident and driven woman named Julianne.  As a   
food critic, she is very busy, independent, and too rapt up in her   
ambitions for love.  At dinner with another friend, George (Rupert   
Everett), she reminisces about her best friend, Michael (Dermot   
Mulroney).  He is someone who she had loved but dumped in college.  Now,   
she and Michael are best friends.  They've shared the most intimate   
stories, they've trekked through life's worst woes, and they've even made   
a blood pact.  When Julianne turns 28, if neither of them has gotten   
married, then they will marry each other.
Of course, it is just a few weeks before her 28th birthday, and Michael   
has left a message on her answering machine for her to call him.  Could   
this be the moment when she faces the consequences of her pact?  She   
doesn't know what to think, but when she finally calls him back,   
partially expecting a proposal, he gives her some news that literally   
floors her.  He's calling to explain he's engaged to be married in three   
days.  Her heart has been squashed.  She now realizes that Michael is no   
longer her best friend, but the man that she truly loves.
She flies to Chicago to meet up with Michael.  But secretly, she will try   
to do whatever she can to separate the two and take him back.  Her task   
is formidable.  His fiancee is Kim Wallace (Cameron Diaz).  She is sweet   
as pie, smooth as vanilla and her father is a tycoon.  What we get is a   
sequence of episodes where Roberts craftily tries to create a rift, but   
somehow the plan always backfires.  But, she deserves to be with   
Michaelor does she?
As a whole, this is a semi-sweet movie about friendships and hidden   
feelings and trying to cross that boundary when it may be too late.  And   
it was nice to take a break from all those   
smash-em-up/crash-em-up/shoot-em-up films.  However, the movie seems to   
be undecided as to its dedication towards Julianne's quest for her man or   
Michael's love for Kim. There wasn't too much romantic tension among any   
of the three.  Also, when our sympathies begin to shift, the movie loses   
its direction.  Further, Michael doesn't seem to have an ounce of   
chemistry with either woman, so the story tends to drag as it looks for   
some kind of burst of energy.  Fortunately, we get an antidote of playful   
wisdom from George, who is Julianne's boss.  He is gay and steals his   
scenes with deft comic charm.  More than just a co-conspirator for   
Julianne, he provides moments of levity and good transition as the movie   
tries to navigate through this three-day story.  But when he's not there,   
the movie begins to drift.
Yet, it's nice to welcome back Julia Roberts who recently endured roles   
for which no one cared (Michael Collins and Mary Reilly).  Romantic   
vehicles are where she excels, and she delivers a charismatically   
luminescent performance in MBFW.  Rupert Everett is also a joy to watch   
and adds an unexpected comical dimension as Julianne's boss and soul   
mate.  This movie would have been a lot stronger if it focused more on   
these two.  The interplay between Michael and Kim is quite dull.  The   
interplay between Michael and Julianne was only mildly interesting (and   
just between you and me, I would have preferred one of the cast of   
FRIENDS - maybe Chandler or Joey - play Michael.  At least, the   
relationship would have been more interesting if not funnier).   
 Fortunately, Julianne and George are instrumental in the film's closing   
scenes, and thus helps to lift MBFW from a boring wedding to one with a   
couple of moments worth savoring.  Still, there are better affairs of   
which to be a part.

Review for Man on the Moon (1999)
"Man on the Moon" -- Andy Kaufman in a Wrestling Match
- yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah
To me, Andy Kaufman was some semi-talented actor who
spent a few years on a show called Taxi.  I never
really watched the show, except when I was channel
surfing and happened to catch it for a minute or two. 
I couldn't even tell you any of the characters on the
show - that is, except for Latka, played by Andy
Kaufman.  He stood out.  He was a shy-looking,
diminutive actor who spoke like he had just inhaled
dangerous amounts of helium.  And I always asked
myself, 'what's the deal with this guy?'
"Man on the Moon" doesn't try to answer this question.
 It doesn't try to be a detailed biography of Kaufman.
 Rather, it is more like a visual diary that
illustrates a few of the more unique chapters in this
performer's life.  And unique is a very good word. 
Kaufman's oeuvre of wacky performances include a
wicked transformation into Elvis; an affable foreign
mechanic named Latka; a crass lounge singing alter
ego, and a trash talking wrestler who proclaimed
himself to be the Inter-Gender champion because no
woman could beat him.  Kaufman was considered
brilliant by a few and enigmatic by some, and
eventually scorned by many.
But his brand of humor was not even supposed to be
humor at all.  Instead, Kaufman would say that they
were experiments in behavior.  He was sometimes funny,
sometimes mean-spirited, sometimes edgy, and sometimes
tasteless.  But despite his many facades, he was
always sincere at trying to give the public something
unexpected.  He wanted to shock the audience and to
elicit genuine emotion.  His philosophy was not about
making people laugh.  It was about making people
react.  The result was that some would roll in the
aisle with laughter while the person seated next to
him would be scratching his head in wonderment.  
"MOTM" stars Jim Carrey, who is showing moviegoers
that he's becoming much more than a 2-dimensional
comedian who relies on squeezing his butt cheeks and
molding his rubbery face.  Carrey ably transforms
himself into the Kaufman persona.  Though Kaufman has
great schemes that he wants to set in motion, he is
not always the sole architect.  Helping him are is
long-time friend, Bob (Paul Giamatti), an agent (Danny
DeVito), and an extremely patient girlfriend (Courtney
Love).  Yet, Andy is always engaging in his own
machinations, frequently even catching his closest
friends and family members off guard.  It gets to the
point that even the National Enquirer ignores rumors
about him because they've 'been burned too many times
before.'
In some ways, Kaufman was an immature boy trapped in a
man's body.  In other ways, he may have been
considered a visionary performer.  But I think that if
he lived in the 1990s, he would have been considered a
very capable performance artist.  This film gave me a
new sense of respect for him.  He was definitely
fighting an uphill battle, but perhaps opened the door
for people like Howard Stern and helped to make
'Professional' wrestling more mainstream.  In Kaufman,
there is an undeniable sweetness to him, despite his
need to shock and to stay one step ahead of the
audience.
I am recommending the film for two reasons.  The first
is because Jim Carrey delivers an Oscar-worthy
performance, who not only does a hauntingly real
imitation of the late Kaufman but also shows unusual
dramatic depth.  It's difficult to be a serious clown,
but Carrey shows great restraint.  Also, credit
Director Milos Foreman for being able to present a
film whose tone accurately mimics Kaufman's
unpredictability and for giving us a thoughtful look
into why Kaufman probably deserved more credit than he
received.

Review for Snake Eyes (1998)
Detective Rick Santoro (Nicholas Cage) is the kind of detective that,
when you look at him, would seem to go out of his way to give 'law and
order' a bad name.  Sleazily dressed, taking secretive payoffs, and
unfaithful to his wife, he actually aspires to be the mayor of his
hometown of Atlantic City.  But what fuels his days and nights are the
pandemonium of fight night and the wicked atmosphere of Atlantic City.
And wicked it is for an assassination is about to take place.
But Detective Santoro is no slouch when it comes to his keen sense of
observation. What's so suspicious about that voluptuous red-haired girl?
How did a drunk get a front-row seat?  Did the heavily-favored
heavyweight boxer just take a fall?  Who was that woman with the wig?
To piece together the events that occur up to the shooting, he questions
several people.  Each describes their own version, and we relive their
moments through flashbacks.  I liked this form of storytelling which
allowed the audience to view a familiar situation from different points
of view.  After some nifty detective work, Santoro focuses in on one
person that could hold the key to this investigation and he begins to
comb the arena and the adjacent casino in hopes of find that one
important witness.  Santoro is joined in his search by his good friend,
Kevin Dunne (Gary Senise).  Dunne was on the security force assigned to
protect the victim of the assassination.  He also wants to locate this
witness to ask some questions...maybe.  Santoro discovers some
hard-to-swallow truths and has to choose whether to continue to help or
not. The premise is interesting, but even after a mild revelation that
should send the movie into high-gear, it actually begins to slow down at
an incredible rate.
"Snake Eyes" shows flashes of brilliant sequences like the opening 10
minutes that focuses on Cage and his every nuance (from talking on his
cell phone and using call waiting to switch between his wife and
girlfriend to shaking down a thug so that he can take his money and bet
on the fight).  There are some neat ideas such as the witness that loses
her glasses and must run for her life virtually blind.  I also enjoyed
Senise's touch of bottled anxiety.  He projects this delicious mix of
calm and brewing franticness.  But like throwing dice, the payoff
happens only now and then.  Here's a movie that starts off with a
thrill, but ultimately winds up leaving a bad taste in your mouth.  You
keep hoping that you'll re-experience some of the excitement that you
first tasted.  But it only seems to get worse.  What really struck me as
odd (and almost a crime) was that after all of the thought that went
into the structure of the story and after all of the good dialogue that
was exchanged between Senise and Cage, the denouement seemed like a
haphazard happenstance.  I liked enough of it to give it a marginal
recommendation, but you're probably better off taking a chance with
another movie.

Title
Review for Whole Nine Yards, The (2000)
Before plunking down your hard-earned money to see
this film, ask yourself this one question.  Can you
visualize a movie that stars tough-guy Bruce Willis
alongside Friends funny-guy Matthew Perry?  Willis has
played countless tough guys before.  So, this isn't
new territory for him.  Perry, however, usually is the
equivalent of the touch of death when he is part of
any movie project.  His deer-in-the-headlights comedic
style, works well on his TV show but doesn't seem to
translate well onto the big screen.
In `The Whole Nine Yards,' the running theme is about
people that want to kill other people.  Matthew Perry
plays Oz, a nicer-than-nice Dentist who is openly
despised by his wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette).  She
wishes that Oz would die, and is secretly in the
process of trying to hire a hitman for the job.   Oz
tells of his marital woes to his dental assistant,
Jill (Amanda Peet).  She is appalled by his current
situation and tells him that he'd `be doing the world
a favor if he had her whacked.'  To make Oz's life
even more complicated, the new neighbor next door
turns out to be famed hitman-in-hiding, Jimmy `The
Tulip' Tudeski (Willis).  Though Oz is terrified with
this fact, it's hard to turn down an invitation from
him to go for a drive.  `Relax, it won't kill you,'
says Tudeski with his tongue firmly in cheek.   `The
Tulip' imparts his philosophies about life, making Oz
completely uneasy.   `We'll all die sometime' and
`what's important is how I get along with the people
who are still alive.' 
Oddly, Jimmy is only the first hitman that he'll meet
over the course of the week.  Oz eventually runs into
Frank Figs (Michael Duncan Clarke), a really large
enforcer for Hungarian crime boss Janni Gogolak (Kevin
Pollak).  Gogolak has put a price on Tudeski's head.
Poor Oz.  He has to find a way to keep all of the ones
that he cares for alive while saving himself.  And
this can become quite difficult because one of the
women that he meets along the way and falls in love
with happens to be Jimmy's wife (Natasha Henstridge). 
When Oz confesses to Jimmy that he's fallen in love
with her, he laments `Oh my God, I've upset a mass
murderer.'
Happily, there's a hint of general glee among the cast
members, who seem to be enjoying what they are doing. 
This would explain the purposefully over-the-top
acting in some sequences and the incomprehensible
accents in others.  Actors get at least one scene to
ham it up, and when the spotlight is on them, they
take full advantage of their opportunity.  Kevin
Pollak gets his moment as the Hungarian crime boss who
doesn't quite have a good enough command of the
English language.  Rosanna Arquette gets her moment
when she seduces hitmen as part of her contract
negotiation strategy.  But the real bright spot for
me, however, was Amanda Peet who played Jill the
dental assistant.  She turns out to be a Tudeski
groupie who aspires to become a bona fide contract
killer.  She brings a natural vibrancy to her role
that makes her infectiously funny and a delight to
watch.  Enjoying this film really depends on two
things: having the patience to allow some of the
movie's momentum to generate and accepting its
tongue-in-cheek spirit.  Some of it worked for me. 
Some didn't.

Review for Eye of the Beholder (1999)
Have you ever been in an automobile accident where
you've miraculously walked away with only a few
scratches, yet the car has been obliterated into an
unrecognizable, mangled wreck?  Well, that has never
actually happened to me and I hope that none of us
will ever experience this situation.  But after
watching this inane exercise of a movie, I certainly
feel that I've miraculously walked away unscathed
after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back
and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond.
Oddly, `Eye of the Beholder,' which is a
psychological-romance-thriller, starts off promisingly
enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a
British Intelligence agent, called The Eye (Ewan
McGregor), working in Washington DC.  In the humorous
opening scene, he eyes a top lawyer across the street
in his office with his pants down.  Using an array of
high-tech surveillance and communications equipment,
he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer
to PC screens and fax machines in his office.  The law
firm's employees get a good chuckle.  The audience
gets a good chuckle. 
The Eye is later given an assignment where he
encounters a beautiful woman (Ashley Judd).  There is
something compelling about this mysterious woman. 
Despite her glamorous looks, however, we learn that
she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that
get too close to her.  After the murders, she sobs
while singing the Christmas tune `Little Bluebirds'
and laments about being abandoned by her father long
ago.  After each killing, she puts on a different wig,
assumes a new name, and then makes her way to another
state.  
The Eye has witnessed all her murderous
transgressions.  But he does not alert the
authorities.  He somehow empathizes with her sense of
loss.  The Eye, it turns out, also is haunted by his
past.  His daughter was taken away from him and he
anguishes this loss every day of his life.  His
tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his
daughter with which he engages in conversation.  She
becomes a sort of spectral adviser, and one thing that
the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the
woman.  He now diverts his energies into trying to
help her find some kind of salvation.  It doesn't
matter that he has witnessed all of her murders.  And
it doesn't matter that The Eye is abnormally reticent,
hiding his entire life behind computer screens.  He
follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows
her every move to keep her out of trouble.  When a
crazed druggie (Jason Priestley) attacks her, he shows
up for some quick butt kicking.  When the police are
closing in to arrest her, he provides a distraction so
that she can escape.  All the while, the woman has no
idea who her guardian angel is and The Eye stays just
out of sight.  Peculiar.
How bad is this movie?  I refer you to my `Review
Quote Source' litmus test.  Just take a look at the
full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are
pulling quotes.   For this movie, they are from
magazines called `Flaunt' and `Mirabella.'  No doubt,
they were impressed with Judd's series of catwalks and
disguise changes.  The major problem with `Eye of the
Beholder' is that the film jerks forward, always
unsure of its ultimate destination.   If it was a
thriller, there was little to keep us entranced.  If
it was a love story, there was absolutely no emotional
pull.  Completely disjointed in structure, it's only
saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of
my favorite car commercial (the one where the `6' on
the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a
passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on
a child's train set).  I am also still hopeful that
Ashley Judd will find a serious role to showcase her
potential talents.  Beyond that, the film is
hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously
better traction and handling.

Title
Review for Boogie Nights (1997)
In the late 1970s, disco was the all the rage, sex was safe, and
pleasure was a growing industry.  Indeed, during this period, one of
America's darkest subcultures began to establish its prominence within
the entertainment industry.  This was the heyday of pornography, when
films of this nature made it onto the big screen and wasn't relegated
to the small confines of the living room television set.  But, behind
the scenes, it is a debilitating world that is marked by broken
dreams, drugs, and lost souls.
Boogie Nights is an amazingly revealing look at this frenzied world.
In the opening shot, the camera swoops through a nightclub frequented
by adult film auteur Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds).  It pans left and
right, introducing us to the various characters whose lives we'll be
following throughout the movie, including future porn star, Eddie
Adams (Mark Wahlberg).   Horner apparently has an eye
for...um...gifted actors, and approaches Eddie, who works as a lowly
dishwasher.  "I got a feeling that behind those jeans," says Horner, "
is something wonderful just waiting to get out."
Given Eddie's broken homelife, he eventually agrees to work for him.
When all of the characters are introduced, we meet up with the
cocaine-addicted, porno den mother Amber Waves (an inspiring Julianne
Moore), fellow porn stars recruited by Horner (John C. Reilly as Reed
Rotchild; Don Cheadle as Buck Swope; Heather Graham as Rollergirl), an
obese financier and a bevy of other behind-the-scenes crew.
The primary focus is on Eddie and his ascension (or fall) into porn
stardom.  Parlaying his biggest 'asset', he captures adult film's
highest awards, the matriarchal love of Amber and is the catalyst for
the ongoing success of Jack Horner and his family of helping hands.
But in a world as unpredictable and reckless as this, it is easy to
crash and burn.  Eddie soon falls victim to the dark side of stardom.
But Eddie's precarious path is just one of many engrossing stories
that explore the trials and tribulations of those who support the
industry, but then ultimately become victim to it.
The supporting cast of characters is richly developed, and each one
has a story to tell.  Some generate poignance, such as Amber's, who
desperately hopes to get custody of her child after divorcing her
husband.  Some generate a sickly feeling, such as the chubby male
stagehand who displays more than a passing interest in Eddie.  Some
generate uneasy tension, such as the stagehand who is slowly being
driven mad because his wife constantly has sex with any guy that she
sees.  There are many other interestingly inter-related tales.
Is this merely porn that tries to pass as art?  No.  This film is not
about sex or the turn-ons that accompany it.  The audience views the
sex with a detached eye.   To that effect, the real director films
this movie more like a documentary.  The look and feel is almost like
that from a super 8mm.  The mystique of sex is dispelled, and what we
see are the lives of ordinary people in a not-so-ordinary environment.
Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson finds nifty ways of presenting
different looks at a world that's seemingly styptic.  Through all the
characters and all the action, Anderson's screenplay centers on the
human qualities of the players.  They may live in a disreputable
world, but they have the same goals, needs and values as anyone trying
to make it in Hollywood.  In an industry that offers little future,
fates seem all too random, and each character will meet with their own
happy or sad ending.  Making it in life requires so much more than
making it in this business.  But as Eddie comments: "Everyone is
blessed with one great gift, and you have to make the most of it."
This movie offers several gifts.  Reynolds is well-cast as the sleazy
director, giving his role an almost deadpan feel as he, for example,
graphically explains how to perform the 'money shots.'  Wahlberg also
shows good depth as the dishwasher-turned-porn star who displays
maturity and confidence.  But, the real surprise is Moore, who is
touchingly effective.  I foresee an Oscar nomination for her, as well
as one for Anderson's raw but absorbing screenplay.
Boogie Nights is not a film for everyone.  With graphic sex scenes,
raw dialogue, and a soundtrack featuring pop songs heavy on isolation
and destruction, it is a sobering look at a world that simultaneously
bonds people together while tearing individuals apart.  Still, as
shocking as it is original, this is a finely developed piece of film.

Title
Review for Batman & Robin (1997)
Batman & Robin: Freeze Adds Warmth but Poison Ivy Irritates
Somewhere in the middle of the movie, Bruce Wayne reflects on his firm   
need for control and asks his longtime-faithful friend and servant,   
Alfred, for his opinion.  Alfred's response is an apt one.  "What is   
Batman if not an attempt to master the chaos that surrounds us."   
 However, while the Dark Knight has the ability to master his own   
destiny, Joel Schumacher, the director of this and the last Batman movie   
(Batman Forever) doesn't really have the talent to master the amount of   
chaos that runs rampant through this latest movie featuring the caped   
crusader.
What we get is an offering filled with ingredients that don't necessarily   
compliment each other or ingredients that get completely lost in the mix.   
 And that's too bad, because the movie begins with a terrific punch as we   
are introduced to two developing story lines.  One is the emergence of   
Batman's latest superfoe, Mr Freeze, played by the imposing Arnold   
Schwarzenegger.  His story is actually quite poignant - as a leading   
scientist, he has cryogenically frozen his wife who suffers from a rare   
disease for which there is no known cure.  While trying to discover a   
cure, he accidentally falls into a vat of cryogenic fluid.  His body   
mutates and now he can only survive in extremely cold temperatures.  He   
wears a cold suit, wields an ice ray gun and must steal diamonds to not   
only power his suit but to complete his superweapon for reasons that are   
equally nefarious as they are noble.  And, we also begin to see Robin's   
desire for more respect, more trust, and more equality in the   
crimefighting partnership.  Perhaps a Robin signal would do?   This   
simmering rift between the two crimefighters evolves into an interesting   
look into their partnership.  Unfortunately, it is one of 8 different   
storylineswhich is about 5 too many.
For example, there is also a warm piece centered on Alfred's   
deteriorating health, the comeuppance of Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone),   
the creation of another foe in the form of Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman), and   
Bruce Waynes's road towards possible marriage.  It gets very difficult to   
filter out all of these stories because there is so much to explore that   
not enough time could be adequately given to the stories that could have   
made this the best of the Batman movies.  There is a veritable buffet of   
stories and sub-plots.  Additionally, we are treated to stunning visual   
effects and gorgeous set pieces.  The gargoyles that overlook Gotham   
City, the menacing shadows that tease the streets below, and the stunning   
architecture are incredible.  Those cool set pieces could go head-to-head   
with those in Blade Runner or the 5th Element.  However, they tend to   
distract us from the really good stuff.
Personally, I would have preferred Mr. Freeze as the lone villain and   
more time devoted to Batman v. Robin instead of Batman & Robin.  Also,   
giving more screen time to Alfred was a good move.  These are the stories   
that could've really carried the movie.  If you haven't seen it yet, but   
decide to, these stories are the ones that you should try to concentrate   
on.  You can filter out the rest.  Surprisingly, the alluringly kinky   
Poison Ivy didn't do that much to "bud" my interest as Mr. Freeze's   
partner in crime - she just seemed out of the mix.
Clooney makes a fine Bruce Wayne (better than Val Kilmer), who not only   
looks great in the Batsuit, but also possesses some depth.  Ah-nold and   
Uma Thurman also seem to relish their roles.  Chris O'Donnell (Robin) is   
as perky as ever, and Michael Gough (Alfred) is reliably good as Wayne   
Manor's caretaker.  However, I was not particularly taken either way with   
the inclusion of Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl.
After the strong start, things start to get bogged down as all of the   
story lines come into play.  It becomes a jungle of underdeveloped or   
semi-developed plots.  But there is sufficient action to keep us   
interested in the conclusions and lots of eye candy to keep us visually   
stimulated.  Additionally, a fairly strong ending helps to rescue this   
movie from becoming a frozen wasteland.  Ahstyle over substance  a   
common dilemma for summer movies.  But, if your idea of a good time in   
summer is simply to see a movie that moves, has lots and lots of combat   
toys and swirling action, then Batman & Robin will help you in your   
crusade.

Title
Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
If there's one thing I admire about Austin Powers-the man (Mike Myers),
it's that he has a boundless amount of energy and feel-good silliness
that could make the grayest skies turn blue.  He's a manic, I
want-to-fight-evil-and-shag machine that's constantly working in
overdrive.   Austin Powers will always be the man that every girl wants
and the only one who can thwart the mad schemes of power-hungry Dr.
Evil (also played by Mike Myers).  Dr. Evil knows that he can't defeat
Powers because the latter possesses something called mojo', the
essence of what makes a man a man.  Having this enables a person to
have confidence, appeal, and shagability'.   Powers's mojo is
especially strong.  So, he plans to steal it.  He presumes that if
Powers is mojoless, he won't have the self-confidence needed to defeat
him.  But as the story progresses, Powers learns a life-affirming
lesson that mojo' isn't what makes a man.  It's something far greater
than what his playful mind can ever imagine.  And what is it?  I think
that Austin, between shags, is still trying to figure it out.
If you've seen the first `Austin Powers,' then you're already familiar
with the premise of this film.  At its core, it is a parody of every
James Bond flick that has ever been released.  And for the most part,
it'll put a smile on your face.  You have the femme fatales with the
libidinous names such as Robin Swallows and Ivana Humpalott.  Power's
also teams up with a CIA operative (Heather Graham) named Felicity
Shagwell (`Shagwell in name and shag very well in reputation,' she
growls).  There is the standout henchman with an oddball name who
possesses a special evil talent, in this case named Fat Bastard (also
played by Myers).  There are the secret lairs hidden beneath volcanoes
and even a pursuit that takes everyone to the moon where Dr. Evil hopes
to execute his grand plan.
Each of these elements is milked for all its worth and these kinds of
silly exaggerations are something that any James Bond-loving fan can
laugh at.  But there are also the nuggets of comedy that make this more
enjoyable than the standard parody. 
The opening credits features Powers strutting stark naked through a
hotel, but manages to hide his jewels' from the audiences' view by
cleverly standing behind a large banana, a loaf of French bread, a
carefully placed pinwheel, and other assorted, suggestive items. 
Another clever sequence involved a series of scenes featuring people
all unknowingly making references to a man's sexual organ.  This is a
scene that must be watched in order to be appreciated.  I also like his
underappreciated, underloved son (Seth Green).  He and his evil father
go on the Jerry Springer show where his Dad says, `you are the Diet
Coke of evil  just one calorie  not evil enough.'  
What made the first one super-groovy, however, was that Austin and Dr.
Evil were products of the 60s, living in the '90.  They were both
absurdly out of touch with reality, and that was funny.  This obvious
target for laughs is not exploited here, and it instead relies on a
formula of straight parody.  The result sometimes borders on
Saturday-Night-Live-Skit-Mediocrity.  Half-way through the film, laughs
were harder to come by and too much time was devoted to Fat Bastard,
whom I found annoying.  Fortunately, Mike Myers shows commitment to his
character and zest for his antics.  What's not to like?

Review for Chinese Box (1997)
Something Missing from "Chinese Box" 
Set during the last few months of colonial rule in Hong Kong, just prior
to her return to mainland China, "Chinese Box" is an intriguing film
that tries to encapsulate the mood of Hong Kong as symbolized through
its three main characters.  We meet up with John (Jeremy Irons) who is a
foreign journalist that has been living in Hong Kong for the last 15
years.  The world as he knows it is changing perilously fast.  Like the
British rule that is about to come to an end, John discovers that he has
an advanced form of leukemia and that he only has a few months to live.
"I wonder if I'll last longer than the British," he says of his
situation.  
John, despite having a family, has always carried a torch for the
beautiful Vivian (Gong Li), who is a karaoke bar manager and former,
high-priced club girl from mainland China.  Vivian is now in a
relationship with wealthy businessman Chang.  She longs for marriage and
family, but because of her less-than-honorable background, she
eventually realizes that a future for them is all but impossible.  Like
the tie between the mainland and Hong Kong, it is an uneasy relationship
fraught with innuendo, questions, and ambiguity.  
With only a short time to live, John would like to find a way to win
Vivian's heart again.  But he doesn't want to spend the rest of his
precious time just chasing her.  He also decides to take his video
camera wherever he goes so that he can document the city and her
secrets.  One such discovery is Jeanne (Maggie Cheung), who is a
resourceful peddler.  She tells her life story to John after being
offered money for an interview, and reveals how an English schoolmate
broke her heart which resulted in her trying to commit suicide.  Her
facial scars symbolize the torture of British influence.  But her
spirits are fiery as a result.  Later on in the film, John reacquaints
Jeanne with her long, lost love, but the now-young British man doesn't
even recognize her.  She weeps momentarily, but then soon begins to
peddle her wares with more determination.  This is a stately and poetic
scene that gives a glimpse into Hong Kong's fragility.
There is an underlying elegance to this film and its setting is innately
interesting.  In many scenes, we eavesdrop into conversations and listen
to the banter of the businessmen that speak of opportunities in the new
era.  Other parts of the film are seen through John's video camera.
John's need to record everything on video speaks to his desire to
preserve a Hong Kong that he has grown to love.   Yet, at other times,
watching can become a distracting experience.  Sometimes, it seems as if
the shooting is rushed.  Although the movie was shot during Hong Kong's
period of reversion to capture the frenetic atmosphere, the picture is
sometimes shaky as if the cameraman is struggling to keep up with all
that is swirling around him.
It also never quite reaches the dramatic heights that it seems capable
of given the rich atmosphere, time period, and beautifully envisioned
characters.  I couldn't quite embrace the reason why John pined for
Vivian.  Also, Vivian was by far the most complex character and her
desire and struggle for acceptance was intriguing, but her story is
largely left unexplored and we are left with annoying question marks in
our heads because we want to know what she will do next given her
resourceful nature.  Gong Li possesses an understated eloquence, but
seemed painfully underused.   Overall, I was fascinated by the
undertones marked by the impending changeover and was receptive to the
idea of opportunities that can arise from starting anew.   But there
seems to be so much more going on than what we could see on the screen.
Ambitious but ultimately unfulfilling, I wished that "Chinese Box" would
have revealed more.

Title
Review for Notting Hill (1999)
I love a good fairy tale...always have since I was only knee-high. 
Why?  Because these are stories that you'd always like to see happen in
real life but probably never will.  These are dreams that you wish
would somehow come true.  These are the kinds of stories 'that can only
happen in the movies.'  "Notting Hill" can be called a fairy tale for
at its heart is a romantic comedy about two different types of people
that, in today's frenzied world, could never get together.  But in the
world of fairy tales, there's always a wonderful chance that the
impossible might happen.
The majority of us live rather uneventful and ordinary lives.  We are
the common folk who go to work every day to make an honest living, not
at all well-informed about happenings beyond our personal borders.  The
citizens of Notting Hill are equally 'plain.'  Many of us are probably
like unlucky-in-love William (Hugh Grant).  His personal life has been
marred by a series of broken hearts while his career lies behind the
counter of a travel bookstore that he owns and operates.  For him, the
seasons come and go just like the few customers that actually find
their way into his little store.  
One day, he and his store are visited by famous actress Anna Scott
(Julia Roberts).  Although somewhat starstruck, he sees her as
surprisingly down-to-earth, much like the proverbial girl next door. 
In turn, she finds him charming with a playful smile and a sense of
self-depricating humor.  But she really appreciates his life of
normalcy.  He's out of the limelight, but special in his own way.  This
and their other subsequent chance encounter brings out their attraction
for one another.  But being a celebrity has its drawbacks.  "Notting
Hill" is a smart film that acknowledges the tremendous obstacles that
these two must overcome.   With Anna's popularity, she desparately
protects her privacy while the merciless paparazzi follow her every
step.  For William, his fragile heart can barely take her frequent
flights into hiding.   It also shows how down-to-earth celebrities can
be.  The fame and glory can be daunting.  But she's just a normal girl
who wants to accompany William to his little sister's birthday party,
who gets her feelings noticeably hurt at a restaurant when an adjacent
table makes derisive comments about her, and who wants to steal kisses
in the middle of a darkened park.  But most of all, she says, "I'm just
a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her."
Julia Roberts balances well her vulnerable girl against her own need to
protect herself.  She has always done well in fairy tales.  But it's
Hugh Grant, who I think, deserves a nod for his great comedy timing and
his charming mannerisms.  I especially liked this one scene where the
only way that he could see Anna was to masquerade as a magazine rep on
an interview.  He's not too media-savvy, and says that he's from Horse
& Hound.  "Are there any horses in your latest movie," he gingerly
asks?  Her reply is, "no, the movie was set in outer space."  He's at a
complete loss, and this is a very funny moment.  With its sunny
disposition, weepy ballad-filled soundtrack, and nice touches of
comedy, everyone can live happily ever after.

Review for Way of the Gun, The (2000)
In many ways, "TWOTG" does for tough-guy movies what
LA Confidential did for police stories.  There's
savviness in its writing and a mature patience in
allowing the material to unfold.  But, I suppose, we
wouldn't expect less from Christopher McQuarrie, who
was responsible for giving us "The Usual Suspects". 
His writing talents are still in tact as he brings to
us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but
dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry.
The two goons are Parker and Longbaugh (Ryan Phillipe
and Benicio del Toro).  These two men show the
hardened wear of those who have always had it tough. 
Their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls
who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive. 
Given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime,
they'll always choose the latter.  Yet, they are
incredibly foolish planners.  Actually, these two
never really have a plan.  They just improvise along
the way, hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns
will take care of anything that they might have
overlooked.
Their next scheme, which they cook up about as fast as
a McDonald's burger, is to kidnap some surrogate
mother named Robin (Juliette Lewis) that was hired by
some well-to-do family.  If all goes well, they'll
receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on. 
What Parker and Longbaugh do not realize is that Robin
is carrying a baby for the Chidduck family, whose
patriarch is a feared crime boss.  Moreover, two
bodyguards (Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs) constantly
escort her.  These two protectors find an eerie sense
of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life
and death situations.  They would rather die than
fail; thus their bravado level is equally high.  But
it seems that the testosterone levels of Parker and
Longbaugh are a bit higher, and they employ some
unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the
kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of
slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways.
The next hour or so, we watch the Chidduck camp
regroup and assess their situation.  During this time,
additional plot lines come into play and more and more
details are revealed.   Because the Chidduck's can not
go to the police and because of the special
circumstances involving the kidnapping, we are
introduced to more characters that will help to
influence the outcome.  We discover that not everyone
in the Chidduck camp is loyal to the cause.  As a
result, there are undercurrents of a conspiracy, and
elements of betrayal and subterfuge.  The sepia-toned
atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to
a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings,
shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of
life and death situations that are about to occur.
The momentum and the coolness of the film, however,
begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes, which
featured an overly extended shootout where our two
desperados try to make their way off with the ransom
money.  You can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd
denouement.  In fact, you may admire this film more
than you like it.  Yet, for the most part, "The Way of
the Gun" stays on target.  It feels cool with its
elements of conspiracy and gunplay, and smart for its
invective dialogue and tough guy poetry.

Review for Man Who Knew Too Little, The (1997)
Starring Bill Murray, TMWKTL is a light comedy that offers a clever
premise.  Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray), a meek and likable doofus,
somehow manages to unwittingly immerse himself in an international
espionage plot without even being aware of what's going on around him.
This happens because when he pays an unexpected visit to his
successful brother, James (Peter Gallagher), who is hosting a very
important dinner, Wallace is asked to leave and to return later that
evening.  To keep Wallace busy for the next several hours, Ritchie
buys him a ticket to the Theatre of Life, an interactive,
participatory game for only one person.  Consider it a low-tech
version of Michael Douglas's experience in "The Game".
Trepidatious and oozing with humility, he waits by a phone booth where
a soon-to-come phone call from the Theatre of Life will set the game
in motion.  Ring-ring-ring!  The shadowy voice on the other side
instructs Wallace to go to an address.  Wallace thinks that the game
has begun, but that particular phone call was intended for a hit man
who would arrive minutes later.  Wallace, believing that this is all
part of the show, in all his folksy glory, begins to bumble his way
through a series of amusing episodes, never really knowing the
imminent danger that he is in the or the high stakes of the situation
that he has entered.  It's all just fun and laughs for him.  However,
he seems to enjoy his time slightly more than the audience.
This movie does boast several positive points.  What you'll find
entertaining is the neutral dialogue that is exchanged as Wallace
meets up with all sorts of bad guys and even the woman that he is
supposed to kill.  The conversations take on a double meaning with
Wallace meaning one thing and the bad guys assuming another.  Also,
you'll chuckle at the way he unknowingly outraces police cars,
outsmarts villains, and outmaneuvers pursuers.  Blissfully unaware of
the real danger and just plain lucky, Wallace manages to flummox the
evil-doers at every, ridiculous turn.
What this movie lacks is the manic energy required to fuel this kind
of screwball comedy.  There are some very funny scenes, all thanks to
Murray's comical abilities.  But all the while, it seems like an
explosion of laughter should be imminent, but it never quite elevates
itself beyond grins and giggles.  Murray is not the kind of star that
can take a film by himself to great comical heights.  The comedy
produced here is a result of his reaction to his situation, which he
views as just another impromptu scene in the Theatre of Life.
However, the lack of energy is not really his fault as the story
prevents him from 'working the audience.' 
Still, Murray is affable, the unraveling of the story is fun to watch,
and at 94 minutes in running time, it's very tolerable.

Review for Bug's Life, A (1998)
If you loved the rich animation and the fresh look of 1995's Toy
Story, you'll find just as much to enjoy here with Pixar's newly
computer-animated release.  Indeed, there is a tremendous eye for
detail, an undeniable richness, and even some terrifically animated
action sequences that will make you wonder how did they do that.  But
is a visual feast enough to satiate our appetite for a fun night out? 
For me, it left a bland taste in my mouth.  
Like ANTZ, another recent film about small critters, the focus here is
on Flik (voiced by David Foley), who is one of the smartest ants of
the colony but is prone to accidents.  For example, he creates a
machine which allows for increased harvests.  Food is needed not only
for the survival of the colony, but an additional offering must be
collected to appease tyrannical grasshoppers, led by Hopper (voiced by
Kevin Spacey).  But when Flik accidentally destroys the offering, it
infuriates Hopper who threatens their destruction.  To try to help,
Flik embarks on a quest to find some tough warrior bugs to come to
their aid.  Flik does find some volunteers (a praying mantis, a black
widow, a caterpillar and others).  However, Flik mistakes them to be
warriors when in fact their mobility and acts of bravery are only
because they are runaways from a circus.  With the colony's survival
at stake, the accident-prone ant and a bunch of circus rejects must
come up with a plan to rid themselves of Hopper and his gang.
There certainly is no lack of creativity here.  A rainstorm looks like
the ants are being water bombed.  Dandelion pods are used to transport
Flik afar as he floats across considerable distances.  The circus bugs
are all very colorful and appealing.  I especially liked Heimlich, the
plump caterpillar, whose voice was a funny mix of soprano and Nazi.  A
particularly nice treat comes at the end when they show animated
outtakes, where insects miss their cues or flub their lines,
satirizing mistakes often made by humans.  
I commend this movie for it's visual appeal and it's ability to
captivate kids.   The animation is superb.  Witness the sequence where
the band of bugs is trying to escape from a hungry bird or a circus
act involving matches and fly paper, and you'll agree.   If I had
children, this would be on my list of must-see movies.  Yet, for this
alternative rock listening, sports car driving, entertainment seeking
guy, I would probably tell my friends to see ANTZ instead.   Why? 
Because that movie plays better for adults attending by themselves. 
It had an entertaining villain and some terrific sequences that was
more than delightful.  "A Bug's Life" is clearly more family-oriented
fare.

Review for Perfect Murder, A (1998)
Whenever Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas), looks upon his wife, Emily
(Gwyneth Paltrow), there is an unmistakable aura of dislike hanging in
the air.  "That's not happiness to see me," they bitterly say to one
another.  It is a marriage that has degenerated into something hateful,
something wickedly cold.  Stephen, a detached SOB who is a power player
in the world of high finance, is currently facing a crisis.  His company
is under investigation for illegal transactions that not only threaten
him with legal action but also with impending bankruptcy.  Meanwhile,
Emily looks upon her union with Steven with equal disdain.  Wanting
love, she turns to an up and coming artist named David (Viggo Mortensen)
and has an affair with him, an affair that Steven eventually discovers.
Steven is an opportunist and is extremely clever.  He learns that David
has some dark secrets and a hidden agenda.  Using this information, he
propositions David with an offer to kill his wife.  With Emily dead,
David's secrets will remain safe and he will make off with a tidy sum as
compensation.  Meanwhile, Steven would inherit an absurd amount of money
which would allay his financial woes.  But when the plan falls through,
it becomes a psychological cat and mouse game as everybody begins to
question one another while at the same time they take steps to conceal
their true intentions.  A determined detective also arrives on the scene
to make matters even more tricky for everyone involved.  Soon, the movie
transforms into a sort of "who's playing who" kind of movie.
Unfortunately, this is the kind of story that reveals itself too early
in the film.  For the remaining 60 minutes, we see Douglas dodge in and
out of excuses, Mortensen looking for a way to get more money out of the
deal and Paltrow trying to figure out what's going on.  Two things,
however, really distracted me.  One was the fact that this movie never
gave us any surprises.  It seemed that some kind of revelation would
have pushed this movie up a notch, but this movie which is about secrets
didn't really have any for the audience.   I also objected to the
ending, which was a letdown considering how the story was developed on a
psychological level.  It could have ended on a eerie note where the
unhappy couple is left pondering about their lives as they look dryly
into one another's eyes.  But, it gives us a Hollywood-style ending
complete with flying vases, knockdowns and gunshots.  As stylish as the
film looked, I think that we deserved better.  
Yet, I can't discount the terrific performances that sustained the dark
mood of the movie.  Douglas is at the top of his form as the
cold-hearted, master-of-the-universe husband and Paltrow is likable as a
woman in search of love and truth.  Mortensen shows that his character
is equally adept at playing the blackmail game, and the best piece of
casting is the detective (David Suchet) that investigates the case.  I
have my reservations about "A Perfect Murder," but it's a good-looking
thriller nonetheless that offers a lot of promise, even though it
ultimately can't quite deliver.  Though far from perfect, a marginal
recommendation would not constitute a crime.
