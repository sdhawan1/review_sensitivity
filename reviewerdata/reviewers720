Title
Review for Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)
Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Jonathan Pryce, Michelle Yeoh, Teri Hatcher,
Desmond Llewellyn, Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer.
About two years ago, when GoldenEye opened, a new era of 007 spectaculars
has begun. Pierce Brosnan is the 'new' 007, Dame Judi Dench the new 'M',
Samantha Bond the new 'Moneypenny' and Desmond Llewellyn still plays the
good old quartermaster 'Q'.
Some new ingredients were added to the Bondrecipe. Take for example the
role that women play in the film. They are on the same level as Bond is.
And that's, I think, much interesting! 
But 007 has to cope with (a healthy) dosis of female authority. Judi Dench
has proved that she is able to play such a character! Quote: Admiral
Roebuck: "Sometimes I think you just don't have the balls for this job"! M:
"Perhaps. The advantage is that I don't have to think with them all the
time"! 
 Pierce Brosnan seems to be very comfortable with the role. He plays the
part a lot easier than what we saw on GoldenEye. A great compliment for
Pierce Brosnan! He can be very proud.
Martial-artist Michelle Yeoh steals the show as Wai Lin, the Hongkong
agent. She appeared before in a Jackie Chan-movie. As said before, she
plays a Chinese James Bond. She really kicks butt! 
Jonthan Pryce, this time, plays the lead villain, Elliott Carver. He is
good, but he could have been more sinister. 
Teri Hatcher plays a former lover. Paris Carver, now Elliotts 'loving'
wife. She comes and she goes. 
In general, Tomorrow Never Dies is wall to wall action, big time action. It
brings you excitement, intrige, mystery and romance. And offcourse a
title-song, performed by Sheryl Crow. This is not a typical Bondsong, pity
enough! I think K.D. Lang's 'Surrender' would have been more convenient for
the titlesequence.
