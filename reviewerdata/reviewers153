Review for Lola rennt (1998)
`Run Lola Run' is a thoroughly likable film, a hyperactive
visual treat that combines 35mm with video, stills, and animation.
Combined with a satisfying story line and some deliciously understated
acting, it's far and away my favorite movie of the summer.
A lot has been said about this film's fast paced visual style.  It
has even been compared (unfairly, I think) to a video game.  At its
heart, though, is a classic dramatic structure.  The plot is simple:
Lola's lover, a small-time hood named Manni, has managed to get
himself in desperate trouble.  They have twenty minutes to come up
with the100,000 DM of mobster's money that he has lost.  The
frantic race to the finish tests, and reveals, character.  Revelations
are made, tension is built up and released.
What's not so classical is that the same race is run three times;
it's as if the characters have the ability to rewind and re-do
until they get it right.  Basically, Lola tells Manni to wait where he
is and not do anything until she gets there; she then sprints across
town to her father's bank to try to get the money out of him.  Each
version plays out almost, but not quite, the same as the previous
ones.  And it's these small differences that make all the
difference.
What we have here is theme and variations.  There's a musical
analogy.  And it's no coincidence that the film's writer and
producer, Tom Tykwer, also composed the soundtrack.  Pace and rhythm
are crucial to making this movie work; it isn't all run at
breakneck pace, there are also times when the action comes to a full
stop, the visual equivalents of silence.  And quiet moments.  The
on-screen pace directly evokes mood in the audience.
This isn't an empty-headed summertime entertainment that requires
you to put your brain in neutral.  At the risk of sounding pretentious
and pedantic (and the movie itself is neither), there are some Big
Issues raised, questions of free will versus the predetermined, of
fate versus chaos.  How much control do the characters have over these
events, and how much is pure randomness?  Lola bursts into her
father's office, surprising him in the company of his mistress.
This scene plays out twice; in the later version, a single further
line of dialogue has time to pass between the couple, one line that
changes everything, that drastically alters the events that follow.
While on the other hand there is an unfortunate motorist who in all
three versions, no matter what else happens differently, seems fated
to slam his car into the pristine white BMW belonging to three very
large and angry looking toughs.
`Run Lola Run' is very funny at times; it also has a strong
`Thelma and Louise' quality that makes it impossible not to like
Lola and to hope that she'll win.  Guns are drawn and sometimes
they go off, as guns will.  Sometimes a gun in the hand means having
the world by the tail, sometimes it spells tragedy.  There is no
moralizing here, it's plain story-telling.  With some delightful
twists.
Lola's character is so likable, so capable and determined, that I
found myself bothered by her seeming willingness to sacrifice herself
for Manni, who is kind of a loser and certainly not the brightest bulb
on the tree.  You don't have to be a rabid feminist to be bothered
by seeing a smart woman cast in the role of a martyr to love.  But my
objection was answered by a scene halfway into the movie, a flashback
involving some sweet, funny, and touching pillow talk between the two.
In a nutshell it explains the relationship and what's in it for
her.  Manni makes her happy, and she'd rather he didn't end up
with a bullet behind the ear.
Franka Potente, as Lola, is a joy to watch.  Many key moments have no
dialogue; it's all spelled out by the expression on her face as she
reacts to events.  Running through the streets of Berlin, she
sometimes talks to herself, a kind of incantation, almost a prayer,
willing things to work out for her.  She also literally screams in
frustration, a high-pitched, glass-shattering wail that goes on
forever, a release of the primal energy that the character seems to
have a gross abundance of.
`Run Lola Run' is proof that a smart film can also be loads of fun.

Review for Trekkies (1997)
I can't remember ever having laughed so hard at any movie...
let alone a documentary.  Not that the film mocks Trekkies. 
That would be cruel, as well as quite unnecessary  Plus it
would be counterproductive to the filmmaker's intent.  What
was done was simply send Denise Crosby and a film crew to
conventions and such, and let the Trekkies speak for
themselves.  Denise Crosby played the long-limbed Lt. Tasha
Yar on `Star Trek: The Next Generation'; her character was a
kind of low-wattage Seven of Nine.  She's almost absurdly tall
and blonde.  The  obsessive fans turn positively garrulous in
the presence of this minor deity of the Trek pantheon, although
a couple of them become confused to the point of forgetting
their names.
It's almost unfair.  As they ramble on, what stands out most is
their extraordinary earnestness.  In Trek they find a vision of
the future, a code to live one's life by.  One caller to a radio
show tells how a Trek episode helped him deal with a death in
his family.  Well and good, except that I couldn't help thinking
that maybe a moment in life as profound as the death of a
parent should be one's own, personal, and not influenced by
the plot of any TV show.
Realizing that theirs is an obsession, they feel compelled to
defend it.  And invariably sink themselves.  Certainly, it's okay
to like, even to be passionate about a TV show.  It's okay to get
together with other like minded fans, to talk and swap
memorabilia.  The next step is dressing up and getting in
character at these events, and that's okay too.  Since it's
nothing to be ashamed of,  the logical next step is getting on a
city bus and going to work that way.  By small steps of
Vulcan-like logic, they end up acting like crazy people.  
Invariably, they know there is a line that shouldn't be crossed.
Invariably, that line is always somewhere just around the bend. 
Like the 50-ish man who says he'd stop short of getting his ears
surgically altered to Spock points.  He has remodeled his home 
to resemble a Trek set, he goes to the supermarket in his
Starfleet uniform, his wife wears a uniform too and they've
even put one on their poodle.  But getting his ears done... no,
THAT would be crazy!
It's almost inspiring that people can be so impervious to
embarrassment.  Or so unencumbered by social niceties.  There
is a dentist in Florida whose office is a Trek microcosm.  He
wears the uniform, as does his staff; the decor is all Trek.  He
and his wife show Ms. Crosby around the place.  The tour
concluded, the wife explains that sometimes at home they `do'
different characters.  Since she's too short to play Denise
Crosby's character, she explains, her husband puts on a blonde
wig....  Okay, I don't know what was said next because at that
point I lost it.  As did Crosby.  (I've never seen someone
actually jump in astonishment before.)
Which brings up-- to mix my sci-fi metaphors-- the dark side of
the whole business.  There is the woman who keeps hundreds
of pictures of Brent Spiner, aka the android Data, in a steel
floor safe.  Lest they be lost to fire or earthquake, she explains
(see, it's all completely rational...)  Then there is the stuff that
fans send to the stars.  Crosby opens her garage: she's got
boxes full of it.  People have sent her artwork, including some
technically proficient and rather torrid nudes of her and the
aforementioned Data, embracing as lovers.  `At first,' she
explains, `I was offended.'  
AT FIRST?!!  I suspect she's being a bit disingenuous. Denise
Crosby proves much more skillful as an interviewer than she
has ever been as an actress.  By not  establishing any
boundaries, by not setting any limits with the Trekkies she
interviews, she lets them take plenty of rope.  They promptly
hang themselves.  And they have no one to blame but
themselves.

Review for Third Miracle, The (1999)
Ed Harris is a priest who is not sure he believes in God.  Heâs
even less sure that he wants to be a priest anymore.  He seems
the perfect skeptic for debunking a miraculous bleeding statue
of the Virgin Mary.  A least his bishop thinks so.  The Church
hierarchy takes a dim view of these things, and in truth thereâs
something desperately depressing about the parishionersâ
uncritical eagerness to believe.  Set in Chicago in the 1970s,
these are people who go to church every Sunday and beat their
kids the rest of the week  The bishop lives in a mansion and
talks like a corporate manager.  Which, of course, he is. 
Harrisâ priest in the guy in the middle.
If thereâs one word that sums up this movie, that word is
unsentimental.  The Church is convincingly portrayed as a
hard-nosed institution, part corporate board room and part
military barracks.  Spontaneous religious faith takes the form
of a pimp crossing himself or a junkie raising his eyes to
heaven to give thanks for a dollar bill.  Father Frank could pass
for Raymond Chandlerâs detective Philip Marlowe, walking
the mean streets of the city in pursuit of the truth-- God knows
why, for all the good it will do either him or anyone else.  He is
driven to follow his conscience, and following his conscience
will likely make him miserable.
Enter Roxanna (Heche), the adult daughter of the woman who
is up for sainthood (the aforementioned statue is supposedly
bleeding the deceased womanâs blood).  Itâs bad enough having
a mother whoâs literally a saint; add having been abandoned by
her at age sixteen while she went off to serve God and the
Church, and youâve got one embittered young woman. 
Roxanna and Frank have a lot in common, as they discover
after initially bristling at each other.  They become drinking
partners, and well on their way to becoming involved. 
Roxanna is as tough as brass; sheâs had a lot of pain in her life
but she doesnât expect anyone to cry tears for her.  Just like
Frank.  So the last thing Frank wants to do is hurt her. Problem
is, heâs still a priest.  Doing the right thing is impossibly
complicated.  (In the theater where I saw this movie, there
were two little old ladies sitting behind me.  During the scene
where Harris and Heche are kissing, and slowly sinking to the
floor in her bedroom, the two old dears where whispering âno,
no!â? just as I was thinking, âyes, yes!â?)
I wonât reveal which of us got our wish.

Review for American History X (1998)
This harsh, beautifully crafted film is actually upsetting to watch,
it is so intense.  Edward Norton is at his finest, in a performance
that earned him an Oscar nomination.  It's quite simply the best
movie I've seen in years.
Though it is the story of one man's redemption, it is hardly
optimistic.  Derek Vinyard (Norton) is just released from prison;
a reformed neo-Nazi skinhead, he tries to stop his high school
age brother Danny (Furlong) from following in his footsteps. To
try to undo some of the damage he has done.
Derek's story is told in extensive flashbacks, his transformation
from a studious middle class 組ood kid' to a racist ringleader. 
Traumatized by the shooting death of his firefighter father,
which Derek is convinced was racially motivated, he turns his
rage into ideology.  What's truly frightening about Derek is that
he's bright and articulate.  He's not just another thug.  The goons
and losers in the Venice Beach fascist cell idolize him.
Neo-Nazi scum is made, not born.  Poisoned by the killing of the
father he idolized (who, it turns out, was prejudiced and not far
from being a racist himself), pressured by the family's reduced
circumstances in a deteriorating, crime-ridden neighborhood, 
Derek embraces an ideology of hate. He's helped down that road
by the local mini-Hitler (played with slimy abandon by Stacy
Keach).  But people are not merely products of their
environment.  Derek's sister Davina (Jennifer Lien) lives in the
same pressure-cooker household and has inherited the same
violent temper; the difference is she refuses to transform her rage
into an ideology.
As for young Danny, he's a kid who'd follow his big brother over
a cliff.  His essential sweetness and innocence stand in shocking
contrast to his shaved head and white-supremacist tattooing.  
The performances in this film are outstanding.  Ethan Suplee, as
a white supremacist hanger-on, is a crude and disgusting
presence who contaminates the Vinyard's cramped apartment
with his mere presence.  Avery Brooks, as mentor to the
reformed Derek, projects an unshakable dignity and
uncompromising morality.  Beverly D'Angelo is the sickly and
exhausted mother who should have given up but cannot.
In a movie that includes brutal murders and prison rape, the most
harrowing scene is a flashback to a dinner table discussion. The
conversation turns to the case of Rodney King; included are
Danny (still a skinhead) and his mother's boyfriend, a liberal
Jewish teacher (Gould). Civilized discussion inevitably
degenerates into argument and epithets.  When Davina does not
knuckle under to his chauvinistic verbal bullying, Derek resorts
to physical bullying. Worked up into a fury, he throws the guest
out of the house, shouting anti-Semitic insults; Davina returns
and goes at him with a baseball bat.  It's an ugly, horrible scene,
acted with great  intensity and conviction.  These people are
losing their humanity.
Shot largely in luminous, silvery black and white, the film's
aesthetic beauty almost seems to mock the pain of its characters. 
As do the sunny Southern California locations.  A city park
basketball game, whites versus blacks, is presented as high irony;
an epic battle fought for the basest of motives.  Director Tony
Kaye had his troubles on this project (he was eventually removed
by the studio in the editing stage) but he sure knows his way
around a camera.

Review for Jeanne la Pucelle (1988)
Rivetteâs version of the life of Jeanne the Maiden has just now
been made available on videocassette to the American public, a
move that certainly has something to do with the recent release
of Luc Bessonâs $58 million epic.  The two movies are poles
apart; but then Jeanne has always been something of a blank
slate, inviting a wide variety of interpretations.  Ingrid
Bergmanâs Joan was a saint (sainte avant dâetre sainte),
Bessonâs half-crazy Jeanne an unguided missile. Rivetteâs
Jeanne is the girl next door.
The first one of Rivetteâs paired films, The Battles, begins in
Valcouleurs, the first stage in her journey, where Jeanne waits
and waits.  And waits.  The local captain ignores her, tells her
to go home, tells her she should have her ears boxed.  But
mostly he just ignores her.  Itâs an unpromising beginning to a
four-hour brace of films, as Sandrine Bonnaire stands around
doing nothing in front of a static camera.  Patience is rewarded
though, both Jeanneâs and the viewerâs.  The story builds
slowly, but gradually a sense of Jeanneâs character develops. 
This movie will sneak up on you; I found it engaging, despite
the slow start. One big problem in portraying this character lies
in answering the question, why did anyone listen to her or
believe her?  Itâs a dilemma that puts a nearly impossible
burden on any actress portraying Jeanne.  Bonnaireâs Jeanne
answers that question on the first night of the journey to
Chinon.  Two of the men accompanying her plan to rape her as
they lie together sleeping.  But when they wake up in the
middle of the night, they are nervous at being in the middle of
enemy territory, and they find that they really donât  have the
stomach to carry out their plan.  Jeanne wakes up too, and it is
she who reassures them.  They are impressed; theyâre taken
with her.  So too is the viewer.  Itâs very nicely done.  This
Jeanne is calm and down-to-earth.  She is prone to girlish
giggling fits.  Her ordinariness is appealing.  For all her
courage, faith, and commitment, it is her ordinariness that
always shines through.
When she is wounded at the Tourelles, she cries.  Although the
wound is slight, it hurts, and sheâs frightened that she will die. 
Itâs a natural reaction.  No heroics here; she doesnât yank out
the arrow and make a joke.  Sheâs not nuts.  She is neither saint
nor hero, but an eighteen year old girl.
The Battles is an unfortunate choice of title for the first film. 
Hampered by a small budget, the battles at Orleans are barely
sketched in.  Filmed with perhaps twenty extras, they border on
the absurd.  The second film, The Prisons, covers the extended
period of her imprisonment, and explores her curious
relationship with Joan of Luxemborg.  Joan was the aunt of the
nobleman whose prisoner Jeanne was, and she protected
Jeanne until her death in 1430.  Only then was Jeanne sold to
the English; her nephew was apparently afraid to deliver
Jeanne while his aunt lived.
Curiously, Jeanneâs trial is almost entirely left out; the story is
picked up again at her sentencing.  Under threat of death, she
signs the renunciation and is returned to prison  There she is
tricked into resuming menâs dress, which provides the pretext
for her execution.  When she learns she is to be burned as a
relapsed heretic, she tears her hair, cries, and begs for pity.  It
is an affecting scene.  It stands in marked contrast to the stagy
artificiality of the Ingrid Bergman version.  Bergmanâs Jeanne
faced her end with absurd stoicism, almost welcoming death by
fire as a small price to pay for sainthood.
History records that Jeanneâs final words as the flames reached 
her were âJesus!â?  There are lots of ways of calling out âJesus,â? 
and the way the scene is handled pretty much sums up Dryerâs, 
Bessonâs, and Rivetteâs films on the life and death of the Pucelle. 
Bergmanâs Jeanne spoke it calmly, as a prayer.  Milla Jovovichâs 
cries are inaudible, unheeded by a nonexistent God.  Sandrine 
Bonnaire screams âJesus!â? like a girl who is being burned alive.

Title
Review for Boys Don't Cry (1999)
This film, based on actual events, chronicles the story of Teena Brandon, a
young woman who passed as a man and was raped and murdered when her identity
was uncovered.  It is a fascinating and disturbing story, an unsentimental look
at the American heartland as a place of deeply ingrained intolerance.  Rather
than nurturing individual freedom, as the American myth would have it, the wide
open spaces of rural Nebraska make its peopleâs lives narrow and pinched.
Enter Teena Brandon (Hilary Swank), who reinvents herself as Brandon Teena. 
Heâs a fearless and outgoing little guy with a big buck-toothed grin. 
Getting into a barroom scrape with a man literally twice his size,
bumper-surfing under the power lines, racing another car on a dark and deserted
highway, itâs an exhilarating beginning to his new life.  His enthusiasm
proves attractive to the doe-eyed Lana (Chloe Sevigny), standing as it does in
marked contrast to the bleak hopelessness of her small circle of friends. 
Sheâs also attracted by Brandonâs simple kindness toward her.  Kindness is
something sheâs seen precious little of.
Trouble is not far behind.  Brandon lives by shoplifting and forging checks,
and is dogged by an outstanding warrant for auto theft.  Minimum wage jobs and
petty crime are the only future these misbegotten souls have to look forward
to.  Then thereâs John (Peter Sarsgaard), the young ex-con and alpha male of
the group who wants to protect Lana.  Clearly, the only one she needs to be
protected from is him.  Inevitably there is trouble between him and Brandon. 
Brandon, I think, sees it coming; he just doesnât care to get out of the way.
 Heâs burning his candle at both ends.  What follows is the heartbreaking
destruction of young life.
âBoys Donât Cryâ? stands in sharp contrast to the sentimentalized,
glamorized violence of âFight Clubâ?.  Stripped of Brad Pittâs movie star
appeal, fighting in barrooms and stealing cars begins to look depressingly
low-rent.  Unleashed rage leads not to catharsis and manhood confirmed but
rather to two corpses on the floor of a farmhouse in Falls City, Nebraska.

Title
Review for Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The (1999)
Itâs so tempting to make fun of this movie.  Luc Besson (âLa
Femme Nikita,â? âThe Fifth Elementâ?) insisted on casting his
girlfriend in the title role over the objections of the original
director, who was fired from the project.  Milla Jovovich
herself, model / pop singer / actress, seems like a classic case
of celebrity over-reaching. She is probably best known in the
U.S. for lisping her way through those Feria Hair Color
commercials on TV and for her role in âThe Fifth Element,â? a
Bruce Willis sci-fi spoof where she played an alien. (She kept
saying âMulti-passâ?; I think it was about her only line in
English in that movie.)  Milla is drop-dead gorgeous: she looks
like sheâs about six feet tall and weighs maybe seventy-five
pounds, so she must be as dumb as a post, and the idea of her
taking on a role as complex as that of the legendary, enigmatic
Jeanne DâArc has got to be some kind of joke.
Well, surprise of surprises.  I went to this movie to make fun of
it and ended up liking it. A lot.  It captivated me right from the
beginning and just kept getting better all the way through to the
end.  Besson presents a modern interpretation of Jeanne, a
Jeanne driven more by psychological damage than by religious
inspiration.  She has visions and hears voices all right, but
thatâs because sheâs clearly schizophrenic.  They begin when
sheâs a little girl.  The local priest is light-heartedly chiding
young Jeanne about her twice-daily visits to the confessional
when she tells him about her visions.  Sheâs both compulsive
and she has hallucinations, setting off alarm bells in a modern
audience.  
This medieval priest doesnât know what to make of her.
Heâs not alone; neither does the Dauphin Charles (Malkovich),
who would be King of France but for the occupying English
forces.  Exiled to the provincial backwater of Chinon, heâs a
man grasping at straws.  When Jeanne arrives claiming to be
on a mission from God to drive out the English and have him
crowned King, and she passes a little test he has devised for
her, he gives her an army to go relieve the besieged city of
Orleans.  He figures he has little enough to lose.
This is all very improbable.  If it werenât real history, it would
be downright unbelievable.
What this seventeen year old peasant girl accomplished is well
documented.  How she managed to do it is fertile ground for
speculation.  Countless historians and novelists have tried, and
there are nearly as many different Jeanne DâArcs as there are
writers about her. (Even Mark Twain had a go at it.)  Luc
Bessonâs Jeanne, schizophrenic and manic-depressive, is very
persuasive during her manic episodes, which are many.  Her
visions are utterly real to her and her manic energy is both
refreshing and inspiring to the Dauphinâs dispirited followers. 
Gallows humor prevails among the professional soldiers in
command of the hopeless defense of Orleans: they gave
themselves up for dead months ago.  Almost as soon as Jeanne
arrives, she begins screaming hysterically at them because they
wonât listen to her.  With a collective Gallic shrug, they
acquiesce.  They suspect sheâs kind of crazy, but as soldiers
they know that leading a frontal assault against heavily
defended enemy positions, being a little crazy is a good thing. 
Jeanne is ignorant of the methods of warfare, and her tactics
are unorthodox to the point of being comical. The English are
soon laughing out of the other side of their necks though.  Are
her successes just beginnerâs luck? On this point as well as
many others, this film is deliberately ambiguous. 
Jay Carr, film critic for The Boston Globe, stated flatly in his
review that Jovovich canât act.  Well, it sure looks like acting
to me.  The character walks a fine line between being very
peculiar indeed and being deranged, and she has to hold the
audienceâs sympathy while doing it.  In one key scene, Jeanne
is wounded by an arrow.  Itâs unclear whether itâs in her
shoulder or her chest (thereâs that ambiguity again.) Sheâs
carried off the battlefield and surrounded by the Dauphinâs
captains, who are terrified that sheâll die.  Impatient of the
arrival of a physician, she yanks the arrow out herself, like a
particularly stoical John Wayne.  But then she starts to cry,
because it hurts, and sheâs scared.  Jovovich jumps between
these different modes like a switch being flipped, making
Jeanne a fascinating, puzzling yet somehow coherent character. 
Standing  in a cold rain outside the city walls, shivering in a
splendid suit of armor while her attack on Paris fizzles around
her, sheâs noble and pathetic, absurd and absurdly courageous
all at once.   Maybe Jovovich would be lousy doing Jane
Austen, but sheâs perfect in this role, where sheâs bouncing off
walls, being three things at once.
Besson brings a thoroughly modern sensibility to his
interpretation of Jeanneâs story.  There is no attempt to make
the dialogue sound fifteenth-century, and the charactersâ
motives never seem quaint.  In terms of character, there are
even similarities between â The Messengerâ? and his âLa
Femme Nikita.â? Yet he sticks closely to the historical record. 
He uses visual symbolism to effectively blur the line between
reality and hallucination, without getting cute about it.  His
quick edits have the same effect, and have the added benefit of
keeping the narrative from becoming too seamless and
self-assured, something that would undercut the ambiguity.
(These quick edits that have been derided as âMTV-like,â? as if
montage was something invented by American television!) 
The battle scenes do for medieval warfare what âSaving
Private Ryanâ? did for the landing at Omaha Beach, and are
almost worthy of Akira Kurosawa.  Lastly, âThe Messengerâ?
isnât without humor; it even has some Pythonesque bits.
Donât let the negative reviews keep you from seeing this
movie.  It wonât be the same experience on video.

Review for Volcano (1997)
Why do disaster movies come in pairs?  Youâd think one
volcano movie or one asteroid movie per summer would be
enough.  (Maybe even that would be one too many.)
But Iâm not going to gripe about how many small budget gems
could be made for the price of this dinosaur.  Itâs a big, dumb,
fun movie.  It almost made me want to go out and rent its
sibling, âDanteâs Peak.â?  Well, almost.
Like the packaging promises, the coast is indeed toast as a
volcano erupts in the middle of Los Angeles, threatening to
destroy the city everyone loves to hate.  Tommy Lee Jones, as
the intrepid head of the Office of Emergency Management,
saves everyoneâs bacon practically single-handedly.  The
movie is filled with the usual stock characters: venal city
officials who ignore the threat till too late, pushy reporters, the
pretty scientist, and the faint of heart who discover their inner
hero.  Thereâs even a cute pooch, rescued at the last moment,
guaranteed to bring a lump to your throat ... if youâre especially
susceptible to that kind of schmaltz.
Tommy Lee Jones is at his craggy-faced best in this movie, as
he deadpans though tons of silly dialogue.  The writers have
envisioned the head of OEM as a godlike being, and Tommy
Lee spends most of the movie in the streets yelling at cops,
firemen, and hospital administrators, telling them what to do. 
He pulls it off, too, which is kind of surprising given the way
heâs dressed.  Heâs wearing a short sleeve dress shirt and a
baseball cap, a wardrobe combo that usually shouts out âpencil
pusher,â? ânerd,â? maybe even âretard,â? but hardly
âaction-adventure hero.â?  Anne Heche overcomes a bad haircut
to play the role of the pretty geologist.  Sheâs the brains of the
operation, although given the competition she faces here, that
may be faint praise.  She does a creditable job of playing
small-but-plucky, and thereâs even a feminist subtext as
Tommy Leeâs character tries to keep her from taking on jobs
that are âtoo dangerous for a woman.â?
Thereâs a strenuously earnest racial-harmony subtext too, this
in the wake of the LA riots, with a bullet-headed white cop and
a burly black guy whose mutual hatred collapses in the face of
shared danger.  It all ends with the innocence of babes as a
small child babbles âeveryone looks the same!â?  Black and
white, everyoneâs covered with volcanic ash, you see.  Problem
is, everyoneâs the same depressing shade of gray.  The credits
