Title
Review for Frequency (2000)
A well written tightly directed film, Frequency shows once again that Sci-Fi
done well can be an amazing deep experience.
A time travel story with a difference, Frequency is about a father and son
who establish a short wave radio link across thirty years of time.
With good intentions, information is exchanged between them that begins a
ripple effect, changing one thing after another, leading to a tense game of
cat and mouse with a serial killer.
Frequency builds to a tense and atmospheric conclusion with a couple of
twists that are hardly surprising, yet still manage to give the film a
satisfying ending.
Dennis Quaid is suprisingly good as the Father and Caviezel is even better
as the complicated and moody son. Frequency is definately worth the effort.
