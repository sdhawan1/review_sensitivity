Title
Review for Nico Icon (1995)
Cast: None credited
Director: Susanne Ofteringer
Screenplay: Susanne Ofteringer
Cinematography: Judith Kaufmann, Katarzyna Remin
Music: Jens Tukiendorf, Charles Blackwell
        Nico Icon, through a series of interviews and original footage, 
attempts to portray the story of a multi-faceted woman Nico who was a member 
of the '60s rock band 'The Velvet Underground'. A refugee from Germany born 
Christa Paffgen during World War II, Nico was also a fashion model, a reclusive
beauty, a feckless mother and a reckless junkie. Or so, the director Susanne 
Ofteringer wants us to believe, at the end of it all.
        The film, or rather documentary, starts off with Nico singing the
Velvet Underground's 'Femme Fatale' in a very lugubrious tone and alternates 
between clips of original footage and interviews with several people associated
with Nico at various stages of her life. What is surprising is the number of 
famous people Nico has associated herself with, right from her modeling days 
upto her ultimate obscure demise, veering on a path of self-destruction, self-
inflicted and substance abuse.
        In between clips of original footage, we get to hear different view 
points of the many people Nico's path in life crossed with. Most of them seem
to agree that the beauty that she is, Nico resented her own good looks and
would much rather be depressed and gloomy and be known as a musician rather
than just a beautiful woman. Jackson Browne, the rock musician and one of 
Nico's many lovers (who also contributed to her first solo album 'Chelsea 
Girl')  explains about her initiation into The Velvet Underground. Paul 
Morrisey, director of most of Andy Warhol movies and who was responsible for 
putting Nico with The Velvet Underground as a second singer and organ player 
via Andy Warhol, amid strong initial resistance from band members Lou Reed and 
company, tells how Nico deliberately spoilt her looks by dying her hair with 
strange colors and taking drugs. Danny Fields, music journalist, explains her 
association  with rock legend Jim Morrison and how she enjoyed Morrison's 
alleged attempt to kill her once during a sex ritual. 
        Most touching of all accounts on Nico is the one narrated by Edith 
Boulonge, mother of one of Nico's many lovers Alian Delon, by who Nico begot
a child Ari. Edith tells how after Alian discovered that Nico was pregnant and
disowned her child, asked Edith to choose between her son Alian and Nico's
child Ari. Edith chose to take care of the child Ari and justifies it saying,
"Alian is a grown-up and he can take care of himself but Ari is a little child
and needs a mother". She sure didn`t want the child to be with Nico as all she
would do is feed little Ari with potato chips. There is also an interesting 
narration from the grown up Ari (who is now thirty years old and lives in 
Paris) who claims that it was his own mother Nico that initiated him into 
heroin when he was eighteen and went to Manchester to live with Nico.
        No doubt the footage that Ofteringer manages to uncover is exhaustive -
ranging from French TV commercials, to performance pieces of the Velvet Under
ground's ironic debut at the American Psychiatric Convention to her debut in 
films in the legendary film maker Federico Fellini's classic 'La Dolce Vita'
(1960) as a blonde model to her heydays of association with Andy Warhol and 
her final days of drugs, decadence and eventual but eventless demise. With 
clever and snappy editing, all this footage is intertwined with the interviews
and juxtaposed with music and dialogue to create a fast paced pop collage. For
the most part, the film does take an unbiased and disinterested stance but 
sometimes strays into irritating `show-me-some-sympathy' portrayals with words
like 'she is alone' flying across images of Nico.
        Much like the ambiguous title of the film 'Nico Icon', Ofteringer 
portrays Nico in an ambiguous manner - as a person whose life was mostly 
filled with sadness and despair but who actually derived pleasure from it all.
Rating: On the SuperNova Scale ***1/2 / *****
        This rock and roll band was formed in 1965 with the initial line-up of
Lou Reed, Maureen Tucker on drums, John Cale and Sterling Morrison on guitars.
Later on, Doug and Billy Yule replaced John Cale and Maureen Tucker respective
ly and Andy Warhol, who produced VU's early records, added on Nico as a second
singer and organ player. VU released their first self titled record in 1967 
and made another three studio albums in the next three years, none of which
cracked the Top 100 charts. Two members John Cale and Lou Reed went on to be
popular and the other two remained in total obscurity. Four managers are in
litigation about Nico's royalties and her son Ari is also trying to get his 
share. 
        But during those five hard-fought and hard-luck years, VU had an un-
deniable influence on a whole generation of youngsters. It`s true that hardly
anyone bought any records of VU. But ironically, those who did, went on to form
their own bands - David Bowie, Patti Smith, Talking Heads, Iggy Pop, R.E.M.,
U2, Henry Rollins, Sonic Youth... The list is endless and filled with the super
stars of today's rock. Recently, the record label Polydor released remastered
editions of many of VU's albums.

Review for Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)
Brosnan is back in Bond 18 `Tomorrow Never Dies', a much better
follow-up to the awful `Goldeneye'. This time he fights a megalomaniac
media mogul Elliot Carver, devilishly played by Jonathan Pryce. The
plot involves Bond's bid to thwart Carver's attempt to trigger a war
between the UK and China by provoking each side through manipulation
of Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites with the help of his
army of private mercenaries and an Indian software wizard Henry Gupta.
The payoff to Carver: exclusive media coverage rights from China, the
one prize that has so far eluded him in his quest for world domination
in media coverage.
The film's spectacular (and mandatory) pre-title action sequences
involve Bond's escape from a Russian border area that serves as a
conduit for illegal arms sale, before it is totally destroyed.  After
the title sequences, which for the first time in the Bond franchise
history, do not seem to have been designed by the great Maurice
Binder, we are introduced to Carver's wife, Paris Carver (Teri
Hatcher) at Elliot Carver's lavish party to unveil his global media
network.  Paris also happens to be Bond's ex-flame who still has
enough feelings for him to put her life in jeopardy. Enter Michelle
Yeoh as Wai Lin at the same event, a Chinese secret agent posing as an
aspiring reporter. Paris' character does provide an opportunity for
some tender moments of love but with her short shrift, the film shifts
into maximum overdrive. In continuing the recent trend of mind-numbing
action and violence in the Bond films, we are dragged through various
stunts, chases and killings that have degraded the Bond films to the
level of routine action fare and Bond himself to a one-man death
machine. Throughout this process, Bond seldom uses his intelligence to
get out of tight situations and instead relies on his new issue
Walther and some gadgets fitted into his new BMW by the ever-charming
Q (Desmond Llewelyn). We are continuously made to wonder if Bond
transformed himself from a suave, witty and intelligent spy to a sharp
shooting fist fighter.
Fortunately, the body count is not as much as in `Goldeneye' as thanks
to Zorro, the director of brutal and sadistic violence scenes Martin
Campbell (No Escape) has left the Bond series.  First-time Bond
director Roger Spottiswoode (whose only remarkable film to date is the
average `Shoot to Kill') does not display much understanding of what a
Bond film should be and instead seems to be content working off the
mediocre and hackneyed script that Bruce Feirstein (`Goldeneye') gave
him after umpteen rewrites. Acting, cinematography and editing are
adequate but production design leaves a lot to be desired. Everything
looks too modern and cold and the opulence and majesty that marked the
earlier Bond entries (thanks to Ken Adam and Peter Lamont) is gone.
Even the colors in the film look faded out and something seems to be
lacking in the negative processing. If Lamont is good enough to be
chosen by someone of the stature of James Cameron for his epic
`Titanic' (which also opened today!), why was he not retained for this
movie? Samantha Bond is back as the bitter and caustic M and once
again does some lip service to political correctness that marks this
decade. Product placement is not too loud and obvious as I feared.
Bond's globe trotting is kept to a minimum - Germany, the U.K.  and
Thailand. Location scouting seems to have been done by some really
lazy people as save for some aerial shots of the sea, there is nothing
worth mentioning.
I deliberately saved the best for last, a topic most film critics
don't even comment on - the film's score. After Goldeneye's success,
UA tried to bring back the great John Barry to score this film but
negotiations failed, reportedly due to UA not agreeing to pay Barry
his asking composer fee and not giving him any creative control in
composing the title song with the artist of his choice.  After that,
two names featured the most in UA's quest for a replacement - James
Newton Howard and David Arnold. As things worked out, Arnold was
chosen to score this film and boy, does he deliver! His score is
absolutely delicious and is the best thing about this film. He not
only scores some cues in the wonderful style of Barry (pre-title
sequences titled `White Knight' are reminiscent of Barry's score for
`From Russia with Love' and the Hamburg scenes remind me in places of
the score for `Goldfinger') but also brought back the 007 theme with
even Barry stopped using in the `80's as he felt the theme became
somewhat dated. Arnold also puts his own touch to the score in parts
like `Dr. Kaufman' and `Station Break'. He stops short of using a
variation of the main titles song (or even the end titles song) as his
love theme but instead composed a lovely little theme that should have
been used a little more in the film. As a bonus, he also composed the
wonderful KD Lang song that was used for the end titles, `Surrender',
which remains very true to the Bond franchise and should have been
used for the main titles. It very much reminds me of Bassey's
wonderful `Goldfinger'.  The title song is the worst ever done for a
Bond film and is sung hideously by Sheryl Crow, clearly demonstrating
to us that she does not have the vocal range that is demanded by a
Bond song. It is obvious that Arnold had nothing to do with the Crow
song. Arnold also did some covers of classic Bond music before doing
the score for this film and understands very well what a Bond score
ought to be. He is a truly worthy successor to John Barry.
*********SPOILERS FOLLOW**********
The plot of the film involving total world media domination by
triggering a war between the UK and China is derived from two sources
- the earlier Bond film `The Spy Who Loved Me' that has the villain
stealing weapons from two countries to use them against each other and
trigger a nuclear war. The villain Elliot Carver is a replica of that
in the 1982 book by Irving Wallace, `The Almighty', in which a
newspaper baron "creates" news and is the first to always publish it
in his newspapers, twisting destiny to suit his own needs and desires.
In addition, `Spy' also provides this film with another element - that
of rivals Bond and Wei Lin overcoming their own rivalry to fight a
common enemy. Stamper is straight out of `The Living Daylights"
Necros. We also have Joe Don Baker from the same film playing another
character in this film.

Review for Institute Benjamenta, or This Dream People Call Human Life (1995)
Cast: Mark Rylance, Gottfried John, Daniel Smith, Peter Whitfield, 
      Joseph Alessi, Jonathan Stone, Cesar Sarachu, Peter Lovstrom,
      Uri Roodner and Alice Krige
Director: The Brothers Quay
Screenplay: Alan Passes and The Brothers Quay
Cinematography: Nicholas D. Knowland
Music: Lech Jankowski
        Institute Benjamenta or This Dream People Call Human Life is the first
full-length live action feature of the cult masters of stop-motion animation, 
the Brothers Quay (Stephen and Timothy Quay). It is loosely based on the 
novella `Jakob Von Gunten' by the Swiss author Robert Walser and also borrows 
sporadically from his other works. 
        Set in a dream-like world where fantasy frequently collides with 
reality, this film narrates through our protagonist Jakob (played by Mark
Rylance), the tale of a school for the training of servants, run by siblings 
Lisa and Herr Benjamenta (played by Alice Krige and Gottfried John), whose 
curriculum constitutes the endless repetition of each single lesson 
meticulously until honed to perfection. Lessons vary from arranging cutlery on
dining tables to saying the right words in domestic situations and adopting a
servile  tone to converse with prospective employers. The film begins with 
Jakob's entry into the institute and enrollment. As it progresses with his 
training and subsequent involvement with the other students of the institute 
and with Lisa and Herr Benjamenta, he witnesses the school's slow dis-
integration and eventual demise.
        There isn't much of a script here and the Brothers Quay's style of
narration is very jarring and uneven. Most of the actions of the characters
involved in the institute's activities seem to be with apparently no reason or
motive at all. For example, Jakob is provided with a room with such a low
ceiling that he cannot stand erect anywhere in the room. Lisa seems to have a
fondness for Jakob that may or may not be love for him and it is never made 
clear. The drastic actions Lisa takes towards the end comes abruptly and as a 
surprise to the viewers and this action was never justified by any on going 
proceedings until then. Is it because of the guilt she feels of her feelings 
toward Jakob? Or is it fear that it may elicit the consternation of her brother
? Most under-explained and puzzling is Herr Benjamenta's character and his 
deeds.
        What is good about the movie though is the brilliant use of lighting
in most of the scenes and the sudden horizonally swivelling cameras which are
trade marks of Brothers Quay, as can be seen from their stop-motion animation
works like Epic of Gilgamesh (1981) and Rehearsals for Extinct Anatomies (1988)
Some of the scenes have such exceptional work from the technical crew that the
effect is one of dreaminess and Kafkaesque surrealism. The Brothers Quay seem 
to have a penchant for playing real life characters like puppets from one of 
their animation projects. This amazing (and sometimes unsettling) effect for 
the most part has to do a lot with the fine and controlled body language of
all the characters involved in the proceedings - the 8 students and 2 owners 
of the institute. It is in ground-breaking scenes like these that the Brothers 
Quay excel and provide a good reason to watch the movie. 
        Mark Rylance seems to be a specialist in playing characters in a
dispassionate and sometimes nonchalant style as seen from his other works,
notably the recent Angels and Insects (1995). Alice Krige does well in a rather
under-developed character but the outstanding one is Gottfried John as Herr
Benjamenta. He succeeds in bringing out the fears within Herr Benjamenta and
in the process, frightens the viewers, though why he does all that he does is
left unexplained. The rest of the cast is adequate. The music for the most 
part matches up with the mood and atmosphere of the visuals, with abundant
use of piano and percussion by first-timer Lech Jankowski.
        Maybe this is a film where the visuals take more importance than the 
story and characters. Sometime midway through the film, we are offered
a close-up of the guiding policy of Institute Benjamenta adorning a plaque on
a wall in the classroom - "less but very meticulous". The same thing may very
well have been the guiding policy of the Brothers Quay in making this film. 
Rating: On the SuperNova Scale *** / *****
        The identical twins Stephen and Timothy Quay (a.k.a. Brothers Quay)
were born near Philadelphia in a town with a large European immigrant popu-
lation which fuelled their interest in European culture. They moved to London
in the late 60s to study at the Royal College of Art between 1969 and 1972
where they made their first (and now lost) short films. After spending some
time in Holland in the 1970s, they returned to London to team up with fellow
RCA alumnus Keith Griffiths (who would act as producer on all their subsequent
films) and formed Koninck Studios and have since produced animation as well as
art films, cultural documentaries, TV commercials (Honeywell, Walkers Crisps 
etc.) and music videos which include the ground-breaking video for Peter
Gabriel's award-winning song 'Sledgehammer' and more recently, music videos 
for 'Sober' and 'Prison Sex' by the artist Tool.
        The Quays' films include documentaries on Punch and Judy, Stravinsky 
and the art of Anamorphosis, as well as films inspired by the literature of
Kafka, Bruno Schultz and Robert Walser. Their work also include decors for
theater and opera productions based on the works of Prokofiev and Tchaikovsky.
In 1995, they designed the decors for the English National Opera productions
and this year, they will design the sets for Janacek's 'The Makropoulos Case'
at Covent Garden.

Review for Last Man Standing (1996)
Cast: Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Bruce Dern, Alexandra Powers, David
      Patrick Kelley, William Sanderson, Karina Lombard, Ned Eisenberg, Michael
      Imperioli, Ken Jenkins
Director: Walter Hill
Screenplay: Walter Hill, Ryuzo Kikushima, Akira Kurosawa
Cinematography: Lloyd Ahern
Music: Ry Cooder, Elmer Bernstein (score rejected)
        Last Man Standing retells the story of the classic Kurosawa samurai 
film Yojimbo (1961) (which also 'inspired' another film for the Western genre
A Fistful of Dollars (1964)), with a little updating for the '90s. This one is
set in the 1920's prohibition era where rival gangsters fight each other to 
take complete control over liquor smuggling in Chicago. The film itself is set
in a small dysfunctional town Jericho, somewhere in Texas, near the Mexican 
border. 
        The story involves a mysterious stranger going by the name John Smith 
(Bruce Willis) who enters Jericho in his rundown car and decides to stay in 
town to make some fast money soon after the first incident involving him makes
him realize that there are rival gangs here fighting for control over the
liquor smuggling from across the border and redirection to the 'bosses' in 
Chicago. Pitted against each other are two gangs, one led by Doyle (David P
Kelly) and Hickey (Christopher Walken) and the other led by Strozzi (Ned 
Eisenberg) and Giorgio (Michael Imperioli). The film is about how John Smith 
eliminates the two gangs with a little help from some town folks like the 
crooked Sheriff (Bruce Dern) and a bartender who provides him lodging.
        There are a few subplots in the story one of which involves Strozzi's 
girlfriend Lucy (Alexandra Powers) who switches allegiance to Smith after 
being ill-treated by Strozzi and plays a role in the downfall of Strozzi's gang
and another subplot which involves Doyle's 'property' Felina (Karina Lombard)
who Smith emancipates from Doyle's clutches and in the process, gets badly
beaten up. Some interesting and atmospheric scenes involve the undertaker of
the town who always acknowledges Smith's big hand in the town's body count.
        A film so inspired by the classic Yojimbo will suffer from comparisons,
fair and unfair. Whereas the original had a wicked sense of humor and plays 
most scenes with dramatic effect, this one does not. The subplot involving 
Felina shows the only sign of weakness of our protagonist Smith ('when you go 
down, it will be over a skirt' says the Sheriff to Smith!) and Smith's weakness
for women is the only sign of character we come to know, apart from the
obvious things like his unending thirst for whiskey and beer and his taciturn
and reticent nature. The only other character that stands out is that of Walken
which he plays brilliantly. The reviewer felt that Walken will always make a 
great Bond film villain but was too young when chosen to play Max Zorin in A
View to a Kill (1985), resulting in not too good reviews of that performance.
        Hill directs the film with gusto and panache, with a lot of slow-motion
sequences of violence and stylish camera as is his wont and forte but falls
short in the narrative side which he makes up with a lot of atmosphere and 
visuals. We even have a slight touch of comedy in the film - a little from
Smith's cynicism and a lot from the ever-happy undertaker. Right at the start,
Hill shows a nice contrast between a dead fly-infested horse on the streets
and a dead gangster all decked up in a nice suit and entrenched in a coffin.
Willis is right on target as Smith and the gangsters are adequate. There are
a few loose ends like why inspite of killing some of their own men, Hickey's
gang still want to 'employ' Smith if Hickey and company could completely gut
out Strozzi's hideout and wipe out their gang in one big attack, towards the
end. Also, Doyle and Felina's relation is never explained and if Doyle felt
so strongly about Smith's emancipation of Felina, why didn't he just kill Smith
? The film would have had a better impact had it actually been set in Chicago
and not in some vague Texan town.
        Ry Cooder, who is a Walter Hill regular, having previously scores 
Hill's Streets of Fire (1984), Crossroads (1986) and Johnny Handsome (1989) 
among others, comes up with yet another remarkable score in his inimitable 
style of fusing elements of jazz, blues and rock guitars with a few classic 
Western elements thrown in and makes it all blend well with the film's visuals
and mood. The heavy distortion he uses on the guitars in the scenes that lead 
to the dining table massacre by Smith to rescue Felina is very effective. The
record label Varese will be releasing Elmer Bernstein's rejected score to this
film. The editing is crisp and snappy. Camera work is very good for the most 
part except for the excessive use of light filters, giving some of the scenes
in the film a very glossy and polished look, which is unsuitable when filming
scenes of gritty violence and machismo. 
        There is a high body count in this film and some of it is quite un
necessary. All in all, it is a fair enough film that keeps the viewers engaged
first to finish without really doing anything more. But then, it wouldn't be 
wise to expect more than that from a Walter Hill film.
