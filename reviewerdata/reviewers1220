Review for Léon (1994)

It's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the
original director's cut of the film.  Films such as Aliens, The Abyss,
The Wild Bunch, Blade Runner, and Terminator 2 are all prime examples of
a filmmaker's integrity, later chopped up or mucked with by the studio. 
The advent of the DVD format has provided a more accessible way to get
these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself
the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such
classic films.
The DVD release of the original international version of Luc Besson's
1995 masterpiece The Professional, which is known as Léon around the
world, is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant
classic as a director's cut.  For years, I have heard of an
"international" version available only in laserdisc format, which has
eluded me for years.  I even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle Don
for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including Léon. 
But after countless searches in laserdisc stores, I could never find
it.  Until now.
The film follows the story of Léon, played by Jean Reno, a professional
hit man for an Italian Mob crew run by Danny Aiello.  He lives next door
to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named Mathilda - played by
then newcomer Natalie Portman, whose father is involved in drugs and
crooked cops.  One day, a crew of the cops - lead by Gary Oldman in an
over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while Mathilda is out
buying groceries.  Taking pity on her, Léon hides her in his apartment
when she returns to save her life.  Mathilda learns of Léon's hit man
profession and decides to follow in Léon's footsteps as a "cleaner." 
She then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within
Léon he has kept locked away as part of his profession.  At this point,
the differences in the American version and the International version
really kick in.
The International version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage
that pertains directly to the relationship of Léon and Mathilda, footage
that American censors deemed "too explicit."  I assume that American
censors feel that defining character development is too much for
American audiences to handle.  The best part of this extra footage is
that gives better understanding of both Mathilda's and Léon's
motivations pertaining to later actions involving Oldman and his crew of
bad cops.  There's even a previously unseen cameo by the great French
actor Jean-Hugues Anglade - star of Queen Margot, Besson's La Femme
Nikita, and Killing Zoe.  With these additional scenes replaced, Léon
and Matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and
draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the
American version.
The most ironic thing about the International version of the film is
that with the inclusion of the missing scenes, the film becomes
primarily a heavy, emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at
the beginning and the end of the film.  The film betters reflects the
serious drama of French cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the
brutality of American cinema.
My advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of The
Professional, throw down twenty bucks, and pick up this newly restored
cinematic masterpiece.
Director/Writer: Luc Besson
Producer: Luc Besson, Claude Besson

Review for Ready to Rumble (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/cd24a6d971ffacdd882568b900067220?OpenDocument
Wrestling - for all of its flash pots, Solid Gold dancers, and large,
scantily clad, sweaty men  is the 21st century version of Ringing
Bros., Barnum and Bailey's traveling tent show.  When I was a kid, I
used to watch the exploits of Andre the Giant, Macho Man Randy Savage,
and the Honky Tonk Man.  The newest generation of wrestlers have never
interested me, with all of the theatrics and bad, bad attitudes toward
almost everything under the sun.  The `sport' of wrestling has become
three hours of anger, deception, sexual dominance, and violent acts with
chairs.  The one thing that has always eluded me with the newest
generation of wrestlers  Goldberg, Sting, Mankind, and The Rock  is
the human element that drew me into the action so well as a kid.  But
Ready to Rumble helped remind me of the glory days I once had, sitting
before the 13-inch RCA with the bottom knob broken off, watching my
heroes triumph over the adversities of life's travels.
The film follow two losers, played by Scott Caan and David Arquette, who
run a septic truck business for the local town of Lusk, Wyoming.  Their
idol is Jimmy King, grand champion belt holder of the WCW Federation,
who proclaims `I WILL RULE YOU!' after every victory.  Caan and Arquette
attend a WCW bout and, in horror, watch their idol fall from grace by
turncoat WCW wrestlers.  Jimmy King is beaten to a bloody pulp and a
fellow wrestler, Diamond Dallas Page, takes the belt from the fallen
king.  After the show, Caan and Arquette strike out to find their
defeated hero and once again place the crown upon the rightful king of
the ring.
The strengths of the film lie in its wonderful script.  It draws from
the familiar lines of many sport films yet retains a strong sense of
disbelief that helps carry the emotions of the characters to a
heart-pounding end.  Arquette and Caan put out wonderful performances of
simple men looking to fulfill their dreams without anything standing in
their way.  The supporting cast of real wrestlers  Goldberg, Sting,
Macho Man Randy Savage, and Mr. Perfect  lend their acting chops to
help authenticate the action.  And director Brian Robbins lends a
confident hand at capturing the beauty of the choreographed moves,
strongly capturing the feeling of this `circus' masquerading as a
professional sport.
But the best thing about the movie is how damn funny it is.  The scenes
are littered with enough foul humor to embarrass the Farrelly Brothers
but are carried by the convictions of the characters and the innocence
of common men in the presence of giants.  Even Joe Pantoliano, playing a
sleazy wrestling promoter responsible for the King's downfall, and Oscar
winner Martin Landau, playing an old-school wrestler who trains King,
bring wonderful diversity to the characters in the film.  Rose McGowan
shines as well as a manipulative WCW dancer who likes to wrestle and
growl in bed.
Ready to Rumble is a fun, rambunctious film filled with laughs and a
great storyline.  Take your favorite wrestling fan (or your favorite
closeted wrestling fan) and a good time is guaranteed.

Review for Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001)
Sequels just never measure up to their predecessors.  Every now and then
it happens -- a la Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, The Empire Strikes
Back, and The Rescuers Down Under -- but those are the exceptions. 
The original Eddie Murphy comedy Dr. Dolitte was a lukewarm and tepid
yet entertaining movie filled with cheap laughs, terrible acting, and a
painful reminder of Murphy's slow decent into another slump.  But alas,
the studio gods spoke and a sequel became unavoidable when the original
Dr. Dolittle (er, the original Eddie Murphy Dolittle, itself being a
remake) grossed over $290 million dollars worldwide -- not including
sales from the hip-hop soundtrack.
Well, Murphy has lost the nappy deadlocks of the first film and again
takes on the role of the intrepid animal doctor/interpreter Dr. Dolittle
in Dr. Dolittle 2.  This time around, Dolittle has honed his
communication skills and runs a joint animal and human medical office in
beautiful San Francisco.  Over the past few years, Dolittle has become
the Sigmund Freud of the animal kingdom -- providing sexual advice to a
turtle with erectile dysfunction, overseeing support groups for stray
dogs, and guest-starring on Crocodile Hunter.
One night, a raccoon with a thick Brooklyn accent shows up at his door
and requests that the Doc meet with The Beaver -- the head of some type
of animal Mafia in the Marin County forests.  The Beaver requests that
the Doc stop a evil logging company -- controlled by Jeffery Jones and
Kevin Pollack -- from clear-cutting the homes of all of the forest
dwellers.  The only way to save the forest lies in the loins of an
endangered species of bear named Archie (voiced by Steve Zahn), whom the
Doc has to retrain in how to live in the wild so he can mate with
another bear named Ava (voiced by Lisa Kudrow).  If Archie and Ava do
the mystery dance and produce little Archies and Avas, the forest would
then be deemed off-limits from the clutches of evil logging company. 
The only problem is that Archie is a circus bear who best knows how to
dance to disco and has the demeanor of Woody Allen -- Wayne Newton in a
bear suit.  So its up to the Doc to teach Archie how to be the alpha
male of the wild, save the forest from the overacting of Kevin Pollack,
learn how to communicate with his own human family, and somehow make us
believe that a talking monkey has a drinking problem.
Dr. Dolittle 2 could've been a contender.  In a decade of film - Nutty
Professor II, Bowfinger, Life, Holy Man, Metro, A Vampire in Brooklyn,
Beverly Hills Cop III, and Boomerang -- Murphy has done little worth
remembering.  But in Dr. Dolittle 2, Murphy gives one of his better
performances in recent years.  He seems looser, more interested in the
role, and gives fleeting glimpses of that energetic and sharp humor that
made him so famous in the '80s.  Still, he seems reserved and unsure
about how to work in this brave new world of family films and wholesome
entertainment.
The voice talent is where the gold lies.  Steve Zahn's dry wit and
apathy give Archie the Bear the comedic edge it needs to compliment the
excellent training of the animal (coupled with his CGI manipulation). 
Norm Macdonald returns in his role of the wisecracking family dog Lucky
and provides added humor.  The various voice talents of Cedric the
Entertainer, Michael Rappaport, Kudrow, and Molly Shannon are witty but
don't draw attention away from the amazing animatronics of the talking
animals.
But Dolittle 2 suffers from a serious identity crisis and, like the
original, never really sells the humanization of its animal characters. 
Worse still, the film constantly veers among being a Hallmark special,
an environmentalist call to arms, a cheap rip-off of a Farrelly brothers
comedy complete with fart and poop jokes, and a family film about cute
animals and important messages like "being yourself and never
compromising your dreams."
Even with its flaws, Dr. Dolittle 2 is a decent matinee movie for the
kiddies.  The film also provides enough humor for those grown-ups in the
audience brave enough to sit through 90 plus minutes of endless product
placements, Eddie Murphy playing Dean Martin to the Jerry Lewis antics
of a talking bear, and the bear singing "I Will Survive."  [For a very
special treat try watching Max karaoke "I Will Survive." -Ed.]

Producer: John Davis, Joseph Singer
Writer: Larry Levin
Starring: Eddie Murphy, Kristen Wilson, Kyla Pratt, Jeffery Jones, Kevin
Pollack, Lil' Zane, Lisa Kudrow, Steve Zahn, Norm Macdonald, Cedric the

Review for Dish, The (2000)
Another "quirky" Australian comedy is poised to be consumed by the
ignorant American masses.  The Dish (one of the most popular films in
Australia!!) has been hailed as "an inspired human comedy" complete with
quirky characters, a heartwarming story, nostalgic images of past
glories, and enough sheep jokes to make my grandmother chuckle.  The
only thing they forgot to include is a reason to care about this fluff
of a film.
Based on a true story, The Dish chronicles a giant satellite dish
located in a sheep paddock in Parkes, Australia that assisted in
transmitting communications and television signal broadcasts between
Apollo 11 and NASA in the summer of 1969.  The dish is the largest in
the Southern Hemisphere and was the only dish in 1969 powerful enough to
capture the live camera broadcasts from the historic landing on the moon
on July 20, 1969.  Running the dish are four quirky characters: Cliff
Burton (Sam Neill), the dish's supervisor who smokes too much and pines
over his dead wife; Mitch (Kevin Harrington), the nerdy dish technician
in love with the local town girl; Glen (Tom Long), the
"chip-on-his-shoulder" dish operator who spends most of the film
whining; and Al Burnett (Patrick Warburton), the stuffy NASA agent who
wears thick glasses and carries the nurturing tone of Barbara Walters. 
These four knuckleheads, during Apollo's flight, overcome such obstacles
as political ass-kissing, power outages, puppy love, gale force winds,
and ridiculous moment-of-purpose speeches in order to not look like a
bunch of Australian outback hicks working in the middle of a sheep
paddock.
All these things end up being about as entertaining as watching the
grass grow in the sheep paddock.
I'm the first to admit I must have missed the boat on this one. 
Elements of better films -- October Sky, Apollo 13, The Right Stuff --
kept popping into my head as I watched the mind-numbing montages that
consumed way too much celluloid.  Archived footage of NASA engineers
working diligently is intermixed with serene, dopey smiles from the crew
fiddling with the controls of thedish, rockets taking off, archive
footage of crowds circa 1969, and astronauts landing on the moon.  I
felt like I was watching some cheap made-for-TV movie on a old console
set.
The sentimental bookends of Sam Neill wearing bad makeup as an older man
reminiscing about that summer of '69 further compounds the film's
homogenous sap.  There's nothing bad here, it's just innocuous, watery,
and lifeless.
Director: Rob Sitch
Producer: Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy, Rob Sitch
Writer: Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy, Rob Sitch
Starring: Sam Neill, Patrick Warburton, Kevin Harrington, Tom Long,
Genevieve Mooy, Billie Brown

Review for Where the Heart Is (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
 http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/e012f170e965e9ae882568cf000106ca?OpenDocument
Long ago, films were constructed of strong dialogue, original
characters, memorable plot points, and solid acting.  One of the best
examples that Hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found
in the new film Where the Heart Is.
This opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows
the tragic, and I mean tragic, life of Novalee Nation (Natalie
Portman).  Hitting the road with her hick, guitar-playing boyfriend in a
rusted-out GM, Novalee dreams of the blue skies of Bakersfield and
sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby,
due in a month.
Stopping off at a nearby Wal-Mart for a quick rest, Novalee's boyfriend
decides to take off and leaves her there.  Novalee then decides to
secretly hole up in the Wal-Mart (because she's not the brightest bulb
in the stagelights).  A wacky librarian (Keith David) comes to her
rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the
outdoors section of the store.  Then the she moves in with a family,
befriends everyone in town -- including Ashley Judd's character (who has
FIVE kids and still can work part-time as a nurse) -- fights off
religious freaks, survives a tornado, breaks the heart of the wacky
librarian that saved her, receives an inheritance, builds a Martha
Stewart-esque house, becomes an award-winning photographer, and manages
to always look like she stepped out of a Cosmo shoot, all while not once
doing anything with her kid.
This film is terrible.  The directing is awful: It seems director Matt
Williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every
one of them, over and over and over again.  We get pathetic and ugly
acting by Natalie Portman, who can do good work.  A disjointed pacing of
key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw Steve
Prefontaine off.  A subplot that actually validates the actions of the
boyfriend who abandoned Novalee in the Wal-Mart parking lot.  An
embarrassing display of emotions by the characters, making the audience
ill.  Taking two great comedic screenwriters, Babaloo Mandel and Lowell
Ganz, and forcing them to write drama on par with Oprah's Book Club.
Altogether, it has the feeling of being trapped at home, watching a very
bad television mini-series and wishing it to end, only the remote is
broken.
However, the main problem with the film is that it never answers the
most poignant question brought up:  Where is the heart?  No one ever
seems to find it in this piece of junk.
Director: Matt Williams
Producers: Matt Williams, David McFadzean, Susan Cartsonis, Patricia
Whitcher
Writers: Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz
Starring: Natalie Portman, Keith David, Stockard Channing, Ashley Judd,
Sally Field, Dylan Bruno

Review for Bait (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/c6be01e76e80952f8825695b0003bddf?OpenDocument
The American fascination with personal surveillance and voyeurism has
reached a new and strange level.  TV shows such as Survivor, Big Brother
- and movies such as Enemy of the State and The Blair Witch Project have
raised the bar for compulsive interest in other peoples' lives.  It is
as if America has become a nation of stalkers and shut-ins locked away
behind their television and computer screens.  The new Jaime Foxx film
Bait is a prime example of how this sadistic, cultural phenomenon has
been constructed into mainstream Hollywood fodder for the masses.
I didn't know what to expect of Bait.  From the media blitz in the past
couple weeks, the movie looked like a weird hybrid of Blue Streak, Enemy
of the State, and Hackers without Angeline Jolie (dammit!).  The story
follows Foxx as an inept thief named Alvin Sanders who involuntarily
helps Federal agents track down an ultra-cool computer hacker -- Doug
Hutchison (that asshole guard Percy Wetmore from The Green Mile) -- who
has robbed the U.S. Gold Reserve with lackey Robert Pastorelli of 42
million dollars.
The lackey takes off with the gold, buries it in secret place, and ends
up being arrested on a DWI, all on the same night.  Busy guy.  The
lackey then lands in the same cell as Alvin Sanders (Foxx) who has been
arrested for stealing shrimp - I mean prawns - from a Brooklyn fish
plant.  The lackey, who has terrible heart problems, confides in Alvin
to tell his wife of a secret code of the location of the buried gold. 
The lackey dies during an interrogation by a big and mean Federal agent
played by David Morse, and both the hacker and the feds are left with no
leads except Alvin.  The feds then secretly plant a tracking device
under Alvin's jawbone and use him for you guessed, it... bait to lure
out the hacker.  Humorous dialogue, uncomfortable dramatic moments, and
loud car chase scenes follow.
Bait is reminiscent of many of its numerous contemporaries, but it is
able to maintain a sense of direction under the cool hand of director
Antoine Fuqua.  Known mainly for music videos and The Replacement
Killers, Fuqua is no Hype Williams, but he can move the camera like
Malick and capture action scenes like Peckinpah.  Foxx is always a
surprise to watch as an actor, because he can come off as a chump one
minute and a serious actor the next.  Morse is a perfect straight man to
Foxx's inane attempts to return to respectability.  But the most
interesting character is Hutchinson's hacker, who comes across as
faceless while holding a cold control over nature, like a predator
stalking his prey.
Bait is a solid action movie despite a weird pace to the film.  One
minute Foxx is joking around about being a player, the next minute he is
committing to his girl and a new baby boy.  The movie has been sold to
public as an "action-comedy" but in reality - the film is tinged with
dark moments of cold-blooded murder and Orwellian themes of surveillance
and control.  In other words, this ain't no Big Momma's House.
Director: Antoine Fuqua
Starring: Jamie Foxx, David Morse, David Paymer, Kirk Acevedo, Doug
Hutchison, Robert Pastorelli
Producers: Sean Ryerson
Writers: Andrew Scheinman, Adam Scheinman, Tony Gilroy

Review for Next Friday (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/0d8f5b3da6b7da6688256864000c2948?OpenDocument
I usually don't like sequels.  The mind-numbing rehash of characters;
the bad puns that related to subject matter from the original film; the
vain attempt at trying to create something `new and fresh' that turns
into an overstuffed turkey and usually follows the same blueprint.  I
mean, who the hell gave the OK for such films as The Crow 2 and
Universal Solider: The Return.  Only a few films, which I can probably
count on my right hand, have equaled or surpassed the original -- The
Empire Strikes Back, Godfather II.  When I walked into Next Friday, I
must admit I carried this feeling in with me.  When I walked out, I
wasn't surprised by my reaction to the film.
Let me make one thing clear before I proceed.  I loved the original
Friday.  The inner city setting gave such a rich backdrop to a wonderful
ensemble of interesting and colorful characters.  The interactions of
these characters let the film breathe life back into the territory
previously covered by the Hughes Brothers and John Singleton, and then
ridiculed by the Wayans Clan.  The film also introduced the directing
debut of F. Gary Gray and the acting debut of Chris Tucker.  Ice Cube,
one of the original writers and producers of Friday, tries to recapture
the innocence and originality of the previous film but ends up failing
by not producing the same even-flow of character interaction and
storyline so prevalent in the original.
I like Ice Cube.  He holds responsibilities as music and film producer,
a musician, and a screenwriter and director under his belt.   He is
politically outspoken and waves a mighty fist at the establishment.  I
enjoy his acting and his music and even found Player's Club to be a
well-done piece of filmmaking.  But Next Friday only highlights his
acting abilities and not his writing talent, which he is credited for
with the screenplay of the film.
The first forty or so minutes of the film try to capture the fun and
honesty of the original and succeed in producing some memorable
moments.  But the second half of the film changes gears and becomes some
serious drama with guns waving and a dog high off pot brownies.  The
second half pulls the film down under the gravity of certain situations
and the audience is left feeling somewhat confused by what attitude
should be towards the actions of Cube and Co.  I mean, is Cube trying to
say that breaking into a drug dealer's house and committing a robbery is
a good thing?
The main problem with the film is the sidekick of Cube, played by Mark
Epps.  His character Day-Day is introduced as a bumbling big-talker but
ends up being a whining sissy who finds enjoy being harassed by a
pregnant ex-girlfriend and her large sister, Baby D.  The subplots of an
old nemesis from the original, played by Tom `Tiny' Lister (Zeus to all
of us old WWF fans), and a bumbling romance between Cube and a next-door
neighbor woman are pointless and trite.
If you are a fan of the original Friday, wait for the video of this
latest installment in this series.  Let's just hope there's not Another
Friday in the works as I write this.

Review for Replacements, The (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/964fc1a61a259d6d882569380006014c?OpenDocument
I wish I could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion
of a sports film.  I bet it was some hotshot Warner Brothers agent with
an dark Armani suit and manicured fingernails saying, "It would be a
very light comedic version of Any Given Sunday, and we could throw in
the Hoosiers angle with the casting of Gene Hackman as the tough but
determined coach.  Throw in that hunk of a guy Keanu Reeves and a cast
of wacky characters and poof!  We'll have a hit on our hands!"
The Replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film, a mishmash
collage of one-dimensional characters, rampant stereotypes of cultures
and races, cliched emotional statements of purpose, and Keanu Reeves
wishing for The Matrix sequel to start principal photography.  The story
is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a
rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of
professional play for a variety of teams with names like the Washington
Sentinels.  Keanu Reeves stars as Shane Falco, a has-been football
college player looking for redemption.  Gene Hackman dons a fedora like
Tom Landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in Hoosiers.
Rounding out the cast includes Swingers' Jon Favreau, 7-Up pitchman
Orlando Jones, gruff owner Jack Warden, and cast of wacky and unknown
actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped
characters: the drunken Welshman, the overweight Sumo wrestler, the
black convict, the violent cop, and the dumb, dumb cheerleaders.
This bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the
team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays, Gene
Hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell Dennis Hopper is,
Keanu Reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the
football field, and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making
the girls from Coyote Ugly look like waitresses from Denny's.
The usual things happen like clockwork.  The hero rises from the ashes
of failure, the team comes together in unity, the hero falls in love
with a conventional love interest, the football games are won with
enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and
clap, and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night
movies on Cinemax.
It's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their
belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks.  Howard Deutch,
who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - Pretty in
Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful, has since been doing Grumpier Old Men
and Caroline in the City episodes.  Obviously the problem is that
without a good script, any director will fail in the end.
Sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory, gritty tales
involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the
ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds, the rise
and fall of gallant heroes, and stories of dramatic gusto painted with
blood and sweat on the battlefield of life.
The Replacements offers none of this.

Review for Traffic (2000)
How do you fight a war when the people that you love are the enemy? 
When the conflict is in your own neighborhood, or your own house?  Such
is the dilemma in the exceptional new film about the drug trade in the
United States and Mexico, Traffic.
A harrowing and thought-provoking film, Traffic revolves around three
intertwining stories of cops, thugs, victims, enforcers, politicians,
and the judicial system.  The film is based on a British Channel 4
miniseries called Traffik, which traced a drug route from Pakistan
through Europe and to Great Britain.  Laura Bickford, one of the
producers for Traffic, was attracted to the original miniseries because
of the intersecting stories, the social commentary on drug usage, and
the implication of The System itself being the major perpetrator of drug
addiction.
The film revolves around three disparate stories, which Soderbergh
handles with aplomb.  One story centers on Tijuana State policeman
Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and his partner, Manolo, caught in a
web of political corruption centered on the Mexican drug trade.  Del
Toro is a standout, delivering a subtle, powerful performance rich with
authenticity.
A second story centers on Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), the U.S.
President's newly appointed drug czar whose daughter Caroline (played by
newcomer Erika Christensen), an A+ student, develops a drug problem that
turns from occasional use to severe addiction.  This story focuses on
the impact of drugs on the nuclear family and the general inability of
the family to protect itself.  Douglas and Amy Irving (as Wakefield's
wife) turn in wonderful performances as quiet, concerned parents who are
powerless to stop their daughter's fall into drug use.
Finally, the third story revolves around the actual purveyors of drugs
and the law enforcers determined to put them out of business.  The story
is anchored by Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), wife of major San
Diego drug baron Carlos (Steven Bauer). Unaware of her husband's illicit
business, she enlists the aid of her husband's attorney Arnie Metzger
(Dennis Quaid playing a slime ball) to get him out of jail -- even if it
means taking over the business.
Soderbergh's deft directing and cinematography work give each section of
the film a unique look and feel.  The Mexican landscape is overexposed
and enriched with sepia tones.  The home of Douglas and the government
agencies are a cool-blue color in sharp contrast.  San Diego has a warm
glow to its environment and its population.  Whenever characters from
each of the stories intersect, things get really spicy.
Traffic tackles tough situations and still delivers a solid, complex
tale filled with thrilling moments and heart-wrenching drama.  The film
doesn't deliver a solution for ending the war on drugs, but it does
offer insight into the business.  As a tale about the most
self-destructive part of society, Soderbergh has created nothing short
of a masterpiece.

Review for Spy Kids (2001)
There are few respectable filmmakers in the world that would take on the
difficult challenge of creating a children's movie.  I don't mean those
hack directors who just sit behind the camera and yell "action" and
"print," but those few who take on the challenge of writing, directing,
producing, and even editing a successful film for the underage masses. 
Creating a fantasy world with non-abrasive violence, imaginative sets
and props, and engaging characters to follow is a tough process.  With
Spy Kids, Robert Rodriguez proves that his handling of adult fare
extends to kids' stuff, too.
My favorite films are from my childhood -- Flash Gordon, Willy Wonka &
the Chocolate Factory, Mary Poppins, the Muppets movies, Pee-Wee's Big
Adventure, and The Never-Ending Story -- and they all presented an
impossible world made real only by the power of imagination.  Spy Kids
ranks up there with the best children's films by creating implausible
scenarios made from martial arts stunts, gee-whiz spy gadgets, robots
built entirely of huge thumbs, a holodeck-like room filled with rolling
clouds and stretches of golden sands, and providing total escapism for
both kids and adults.
The story is simple and straightforward, and it zips along like a
sunburned child on a Slip & Slide.  Two kids, Juni (Daryl Sabara) and
Carmen (Alexa Vega), find out their parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla
Gugino) are real-life spies after they are captured by the diabolic
Floop (Alan Cumming), a man with a strange Sid and Marty Krofft-style
puppet show filled with enough goodwill to make Stuart Smalley envious. 
Floop's diabolic scheme is to build an army of robotic "spy kids"
powered by an artificial intelligence brain invented by Gregorio
(Banderas) in his past as a spy.
After their parents' abduction, the kids are thrown into a whirlwind
adventure of flying through the air with jet packs, setting Teri
Hatcher's hair on fire, fighting robots with electro-shock gumballs,
accessing databases with computerized sunglasses, and learning to
believe that your dreams can come true.
Imagination is the greatest asset of Spy Kids.  Rodriguez, who
previously worked as a comic strip artist UT-Austin's The Daily Texan
(as did our Editor in Chief, Christopher Null), deploys that creativity
throughout the production of Spy Kids, showing off sharp directing,
amazing set designs, inventive spy gadgetry, great acting from his cast,
and a fast-paced script that is action-packed and hilarious from the
first frame to the last.  The most memorable piece of the film is the
amazing mix of digital animation and costume designs that bring to the
life the beauty of Floop's TV show -- a magic world that's a crazy cross
between Teletubbies, Reading Rainbow, and Romper Room.
The standout performance of the film belongs to Alan Cumming -- the
multitalented stage and screen actor seen in such films as Company Man,
Titus, Get Carter, and GoldenEye.  His portrayal of Floop as the
misunderstand artist/genius/villain is a wonderful combination of Judy
Garland, Pee-Wee Herman, and Willy Wonka.  The image of Floop sitting on
a cloud in his virtual world, pondering the errors of his ways, is both
beautiful and subtly tragic.
Spy Kids is one of the best kids' films to grace the silver screen in
the last decade.  Altogether, it's a sharp and witty, action-packed film
that will entertain the kid and adult in all of us.
Director: Robert Rodriguez
Producer: Robert Rodriguez, Elizabeth Avellan
Writer: Robert Rodriguez
Starring: Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Daryl Sabara, Alexa Vega, Alan
Cumming, Cheech Marin, Robert Patrick, Danny Trejo, Teri Hatcher, Tony
Shalhoub

Title
Review for Heartbreakers (2001)
The problem with a movie like Heartbreakers is that as hard as you try
to concentrate on the notable qualities of the film -- the clever
camerawork, the strong ensemble acting, the deft script -- every time
Jennifer Love Hewitt walks into a scene, her breasts take over.  Even my
date noticed the blatant attempts by the filmmakers in drawing all
attention to the chests of both Sigourney Weaver and Hewitt.  Alas, all
those breasts are never fully revealed -- like some bad 80's teen horror
film censored by Jerry Falwell.
Despite the massive amounts of boob time in Heartbreakers, the film
delivers all the goods of a solid comedic vehicle.  Max (Weaver) and
Page (Hewitt) are a mother/daughter team who swindle rich guys out of
their dollars in a con involving matrimony vows, extramarital trysts,
and divorce settlements.  Sort of like a cross between Anywhere but Here
and The Grifters.  With the IRS hot on their proverbial tails, the duo
team up for one last job, bilking cigarette tycoon William B. Tensy
(Gene Hackman) out of his cash.  Alas, during the con job, Page ends up
falling in love with a local bar owner (Jason Lee), a dead body ends up
in their trunk, Princess Leia shows up as a divorce attorney, and a
jilted ex-husband (Ray Liotta) shows up waving a gun and advising group
therapy for everyone.
The glue that holds this familiar story together lies in the actors
involved in the production.  Hackman delivers a memorable performance as
the wheezing, hacking, brown-toothed William B. Tensy.  Jason Lee, one
of the best young actors working in Hollywood these days, brings a warm,
subtle touch to his role of the lovelorn bar owner head-over-heels in
love with Page.  Weaver delivers another knockout comedic punch as the
protective mother Max.  And Hewitt actually pulls together a credible
acting job despite the screen time she has to share with her breasts.
The best work in the film is given by Ray Liotta, the most intense man
ever to grace the screen.  He has the uncanny ability to take one- or
two-dimensional roles, in such films as Cop Land, Hannibal, and No
Escape, and turn in an outstanding, memorable job.  The only problem is
that I'm still trying to forget about his roles in Turbulence and
Muppets from Space.
Despite the positives, Heartbreakers does have its minor flaws.  The
"protective mother" scenario drags on for too long, and the complete and
total ignorance of every male in the film over Max and Page's con jobs
is a bit too hard to swallow.  And not that I'm complaining, but who
wears skintight dresses every day of the year?
In a nutshell, though, this is a love story.  Beneath all the lying, the
cheating, the backstabbing, the hacking coughs, and the cleavage we find
a familiar tale of true love.  How sweet it is.
Director: David Mirkin
Producer: John Davis, Irving Ong
Writer: Robert Dunn, Paul Guay, Stephen Mazur
Starring: Ray Liotta, Sigourney Weaver, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jeffery
Jones, Nora Dunn, Gene Hackman, Ricky Jay, Jason Lee

Review for Shadow Hours (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/830e8df669aa4a6a8825691d001be340?OpenDocument
Bad movies described as "a swift descent into sinful pleasure, decay,
and debauchery" are hard to watch.  Bad 2000's movies that resemble bad
1980s films are even harder to watch.  Shadow Hours falls into the
latter category, a mish-mashed train wreck of B-movie actors (including
Michael Dorn, aka Star Trek's Worf), an uninteresting plot, vain
attempts at capitalizing on the "underground" scenes of seedy Los
Angeles, and really, really bad directing and horrendous music
video-esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right
before I decided to drop out.
The film revolves around the life of Michael Holloway (Balthazar Getty)
who is trying to restart his life with his one-dimensional wife Chloe
(Rebecca Gayheart) after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions. 
Michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas
station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife
of L.A.  One night, he meets a strange gent named Stuart (Mr. Buckaroo
Banzai, Peter Weller). He drives a Porsche, smokes French cigarettes,
and drones on about life, eventually coaxing Mike into exploring the
"underbelly" of L.A. together, a tour of punk bars, S&M clubs, and
bare-knuckle fights.
The film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played Peter Greene,
acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in The
Mask 2. The film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip-off of Dante's
Inferno mixed with an old Stephen J. Cannell television pilot.
The pace of the film is jarring and utterly without focus.  Other
horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas and the
Charlie Sheen, Johnny Depp, Richard Grieco-esque acting of Balthazar
Getty.  Peter Weller clearly knows his career is completely gone and
doesn't give two shits about it.  And after the cheap exploitation of
bondage clubs, dance clubs, and brothels - damn, isn't anyone safe any
more from the ugly eye of Hollywood!?
Way back in 1984, a great but crazy director named Abel Ferrara made his
worse film and called it Fear City.  Shadow Hours reminds me of an
almost perfect sequel.
Director/Writer: Isaac Eaton
Producers: Peter Alevey, Andrea Mia, Shon Greenblatt, Balthazar Getty

Title
Review for Joe Dirt (2001)
As scary as it sounds, I was actually looking forward to seeing the new
David Spade comedy, Joe Dirt.  My entire childhood and much of my
adolescence was spent in such podunk California towns such as Exeter,
Georgetown, Placerville, Bakersfield, Visalia, Fresno, Garden Valley,
Kelsey, and Cool.  Such places where ripped Dokken t-shirts were worn
with pride, jeans were bathed in an acid wash, and hair cuts were
sported by the mullet kings of Cali.  I grew up in fear of Wrangler
jeans, Bob Seger t-shirts, and Chevy Camaros.
Joe Dirt was meant to be redemption for my miserable years at the hands
of these greasy, ignorant tormentors.  But then 30 minutes went by and
the movie took a sharp left into saps-ville, crashing and burning like a
74 'Cuda wrapped around an oak tree.  Oh well.
Joe Dirt the man (David Spade) is a rebel without a clue or a proper
barber.  While mopping the floors at a local radio station in LA, Joe is
corralled by a producer into an on-air interview with a Howard Stern
wannabe DJ (Dennis Miller, in a role that finally solidifies his
sell-out status), who ridicules his mullet hair and his white-trash
beard patches.  In defensive of his social stature, Joe tells the tale
of his life story -- his search for the parents who abandoned him at the
Grand Canyon; his various jobs as a 'gator wrestler, circus carnie,
walking billboard, oil rig worker, janitor at a grade school; and the
love of his life Brandy (Brittany Daniel) -- the "Tokyo Rose of the
Trailer Park."
Along the way, Joe Dirt has incestuous sex with an assumed sister; gets
pelted by hot chili and hot dogs; gets beat up by numerous thugs;
receives mental torment via Kid Rock and his white-trash crew; shoots
fireworks at gasoline-filled tubs; and is held hostage by Buffalo Bob in
a strange Silence of the Lambs homage.
It's too bad that instead of exploiting the ignorance and ridiculousness
of the white-trash mentality, Joe Dirt is portrayed as a sympathetic
loser who proclaims his vitality through motivational statements -- like
"Keep on keepin' on" and "Life's a garden, dig it" -- enough to make
Stuart Smalley cringe.  The sappy love story also carries about as much
credibility as Whitesnake's Greatest Hits, sucking the energy out of the
film.
Put simply, David Spade is not a romantic lead, and he really can't
carry a film on his zany attempt to be a thespian (see also Lost and
Found).  The collection of bit parts given to such notable actors as
Roseanne Arquette (a 'gator ranch owner), Christopher Walken (a janitor
hiding out in the Witness Protection Program), and Fred Ward (Joe's
mullet-headed bastard of a father) are actually the funniest parts of
the movie.  The best job in the film, though, goes to Kid Rock, who
clearly didn't need to stretch beyond his roots, with his greasy long
hair and limited vocabulary... the essence of trailer trash.
More white-trash movies are on the way.  Up next, a film about the Mr.
Show character "Ronnie Dobbs" called Run, Ronnie, Run.  Will the mullet
finally get its due?  We shall see.
Director: Dennie Gordon
Producer: Robert Simonds
Writer: David Spade, Fred Wolf
Starring: David Spade, Jaime Pressly, Brittany Daniel, Dennis Miller,
Fred Wolf, Christopher Walken, Kid Rock, Fred Ward, Roseanne Arquette

Title
Review for Kiss of the Dragon (2001)
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am!  Jet Li has finally returned to prime
ass-kicking form in his latest kung fu extravaganza Kiss of the Dragon.
Jet Li - one of the most popular stars in Asia rivaling Jackie Chan and
Chow Yun-Fat - has had an impressive string of over 25 films under his
belt in his two decades of kung fu prowess and strong acting turns.  But
after two dismal attempts at winning over American audiences with a
small villain role in Lethal Weapon 4 and the horrendous Joel Silver
monstrosity Romeo Must Die, it was looking pretty grim for this mighty
warrior.  So, Li read the e-mails from his fans, taking their
compliments and complaints via his web site.
This undertaking prompted Li to construct a film that would capture the
powerful imagery of his earlier masterpieces -- The Bodyguard from
Beijing, High Risk, Fist of Legend, and Once Upon a Time in China I and
II.  Li wanted to move away from the wire work and computer graphics of
such recent films as The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,
which seemed to remove the authenticity of the art form.  He instead
wanted to provide American audiences with an authentic glimpse of a
martial artist at work, just like the master Bruce Lee.
To help construct a compelling story, Li brought in action maestro Luc
Besson to help write the screenplay from Li's original story as well as
aid in the production of the film.  This combination provides more hits
than misses, culminating in the most successful, straight-action genre
film I've seen in a very long time.
Kiss of the Dragon begins with the story of Asian supercop Johnny (Jet
Li) who joins forces with nefarious, megalomaniac French cop Richard
(Tchéky Karyo) to capture an Asian drug lord hiding out in Paris.  When
the drug lord get killed in bloody fashion by the Frenchy and his small
army of bad-ass mofos, Johnny gets framed for the murder and ends up on
the run.  Along the way, he gets in fights with about a million bad guys
while Richard and his small army shoot up the bystanders.  Johnny then
joins forces with one of Richard's hookers named Jessica (Bridget
Fonda), rescuing Jessica's baby girl from the clutches of Richard and
retrieving the evidence that will clear Johnny's name. 
Hong Kong cinema has never been known strongly for its original story
lines but rather for its character development.  Indeed, Li is
impressive in his quiet but powerful role, proving himself an authentic
action star that actually sheds blood and shows more signs of exhaustion
in the face of adversity.
The main flaws of the film are found in Besson's script, whose
fingerprints muddy every scene, from incredible action sequences to the
weak female characters.  Besson has never been able to create a solid,
multi-layered woman's role in any of his films.  Even La Femme Nikita
showed his inability in developing a compelling female character who
wasn't in desperate trouble, down on her luck, and needing a strong man
to help her get back on top.  Bridget Fonda's hooker role who needs
Johnny to help rescue her daughter is a classic example of the
virgin/whore complex that obsesses Besson.  Fonda's melodramatic moments
are at times laughable and distracting.
Additionally, Besson draws the character of Richard as a shadow of Gary
Oldman's corrupt cop character from Léon.  The only saving grace is
Karyo's ability to turn a very shallow villain into a multi-layered
monster.  Li's role also feels like an Asian version of Léon himself,
and Besson stages many of the action sequences by echoing his earlier
works.
The ho-hum story aside, the action sequences are amazing.  Director
Chris Nahon (best known for French commercials) handles the action as
deft as any Peckinpah or McTiernan production, capturing Li in stunning
motion.  The violence meter is extremely high and even Li recommends
children not see the film on his web site.  I even found myself
cringing, and I'm a whore for violence.
Director: Chris Nahon
Producer: Jet Li, Happy Walters, Luc Besson, Steve Chasman
Writer: Luc Besson, Robert Mark Kamen
Starring: Jet Li, Tchéky Karyo, Bridget Fonda, Burt Kwok, Max Ryan

Review for Battlefield Earth (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/31d858b804fd3a7e882568dd00060db8?OpenDocument
There are two things the American film industry should avoid at all
costs.  One is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her
favorite novels into a feature film.  Two is never greenlight a sci-fi
film starring John Travolta.  To wit, we present the disaster that is
Battlefield Earth.
A science-fiction opus starring the Barbarino of the Actors Guild,
Battlefield Earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when
a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior.  Sci-fi is always a
tricky beast: Tight script, a good director, an ensemble cast of decent
actors, and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of
disbeliefs.  Battlefield Earth fails at achieving even one of these
attributes.
Here's the `plot.'  The year is 3000.  Mankind has been become an
endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the
Psychlos (sounds like either the latest clown act from Cirque de Soleil
or a white rap group).  A small band of humans dwell in radioactive
caves located in the Rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the
cities below.  The Psychlos are strip-mining the Earth for its resources
and Terel, played by Travolta, is the head of security for the
mining/slave base located in Denver.
A young rogue named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, played with dramatic flair by
Barry Pepper, ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to
uncover the truth about the `demons.'  He is promptly captured and taken
to the alien base.  After several attempts at escape, Johnnie is placed
in the middle of an underhanded subplot of Terel's, involving
circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the Rockies to his own end.
Jonnie, assumed leader of the mining slave group, then manages to attain
all Psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine Terel
forces him to use.  Then the story just runs along until Jonnie teaches
the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry, the Bill of Rights,
how to use a machine gun, and how to fly a Harrier jet.  The whole mess
concludes with a big, loud, obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me
praying for the end credits.
Roger Christian, the director of this lumbering beast, must have rented
Dune, Blade Runner, Planet of the Apes, Independence Day, Stargate,
Beastmaster, the Airwolf episodes, the `V' miniseries, The Matrix, and
The Omega Man... and decided to steal every scene he could for
Battlefield Earth.  Christian even shoots every scene in a weird Dutch
angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie!  And every
scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really.
The Psychlos reminded me of a cross between Jamaican basketball players
with bad teeth and bloated hands and Klingon extras working the Star
Trek convention circuit.  Travolta's acting hasn't been this bad since
The Experts or maybe Perfect.  Jonnie Goodboy Tyler evolves into William
Wallace with lines like `You can have your freedom if you fight!'  Then
there's the script: The film just never convinces you that the plight of
Jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet'
would be a difficult task to achieve.  Why?  Because Terel provides all
the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason
beside the fact that `humans are stupid.'
Terel may be right, you know.  Humans made this movie.

Review for Pitch Black (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a features story from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the story also at
http://filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/95a45e26914c25ff862562bb006a85f2/2289acc767a96663882569770017ab83?OpenDocument
Cole Hauser is one of those low profile actors that's been surfing
around Hollywood for the past ten years, working with high profile
directors like John Singleton, Richard Linklater, Gus Van Sant, and
Stephen Fears.  Hauser has been seen in small parts in such films as
Dazed and Confused, School Ties, Good Will Hunting, Higher Learning, and
The Hi-Lo Country.  But in his newest role as 'Johns' in the film Pitch
Black, just released on DVD, Hauser shows that he can be a leading man
just as well as a supporting player.
We recently spoke with Hauser about his involvement in the Pitch Black
project, his relationship with his father (Wings Hauser, whom he did not
meet until age 11), the purpose of his film career, and if Joel
Schumacher still has the gumption to shoot a successful feature film. 
(Hauser also appears in Schumacher's Tigerland, in theaters now.)
How did you get involved with the Pitch Black project?  What type of
things interested you in the role of Johns?
Initially when I got involved with the project it was pretty early.  I
talked to David Twohy about the role and then he screen tested me.  So,
I went in and screen tested for the role over a couple days.  It wasn't
an easy process but I read with a bunch of different actresses and
actors.
What really interested me most about the project was the hero-to-villain
metamorphosis - the different colors the character plays.  I think in
the DVD you will see more of those colors than in the theatrical release
because it wasn't explained completely -- regarding the relationship
with Vin Diesel's character Riddick.  The DVD version better displayd
the evolution of my character Johns from hero to villain.  The character
gave me the chance to play the heroic role by getting all of the people
off of the planet... and then he turns evil by wanting to save his own
self by killing a child.
What was the experience like working with David Twohy?
It was good.  He's a great director to work with.  He supported pretty
much everything I did and he gave me a lot of freedom to make the
character the way I envisioned.  He was a good supporter of the actors
and their own personal intentions for their roles.
So he is more of an actor's director than a technical director?
Definitely.  He's kind of a quiet guy when you first meet him and he's
kind of shy, though he gets his points across where he wants them to get
across for the most part.  He hired us and saw that talent within us
actors and gave us the freedom to do our own thing.  We (the actors)
rehearsed a lot before we actually filmed so there was pretty much
nothing to talk about during the actual shooting day.
He does fall under the role of an actor's director but he's also a
technical director.  He's got a vision because he wrote the movie as
well, and you could pick his mind to find out what his idea for a
certain scene would be.  It was a benefit to have the writer and
director there during the filming.
What was the best experience you had making the film?
Learning to use all of those weapons and looking like a professional
mercenary.  It's always fun to play someone like an action hero that you
always wanted to play as a child.  I think every young boy loves that as
a kid.  An additional positive experience I had was visiting Australia
and exposing myself to that part of the world.
Did Vin Diesel and you partake in training exercises for all of your
combat scenes?
Vin and I worked hard on all of our action scenes because we didn't want
them to look like any ordinary fight scene.  The character of Riddick
(Vin Diesel) is much stronger than my character Johns and is much faster
-- like a cat.  We wanted to make it as real as we could so we tried
some new things out.  The last scene between the characters of Riddick
and Johns is pretty extensive, using the training we received.  All the
action scenes in the film I performed on my own, without a stunt double.
Where you satisfied with the final product of Pitch Black?
Yes I was very satisfied with the final product.  It's always a bit
scary to see what ends up in the final cut because of all of the
reactions you must have to the sounds and creatures around you when
there is really nothing there.  You are always a bit hesitant during the
first screening because you want the looks, the special effects, and the
sound effects to all look authentic.
Overall, the film is a solid sci-fi piece that wasn't done for a lot of
money but appears to be a big-budget production.  We succeeded in our
acting and in our shock value as well as the visual effects.
When I was over in Europe, the response was tremendous -- better than
the American audiences.  The Germans, the Austrians, the Swiss, and the
French just loved the movie.  The entertainment factor of the film was
very strongly recognized over there and the simple storyline provided a
broad universal appeal for those audiences.
What were the main catalysts for your desire to be an actor?
Initially I got into the business to do drama. I never really thought I
would be doing sci-fi films.  It's like that old Warner Bros quote
"Educate, enlighten, and entertain." My belief is that if I can achieve
that level of entertainment by making the audience happy or sad or
angry, then I have succeeded as an actor and have done my job.  The
profits and the fame as an actor will eventually surface but first and
foremost comes the work as an actor.
I grew up watching Marlon Brando, Christopher Walken, Robert de Niro,
and Al Pacino and even Robert Duvall and was impressed by their caliber
of work.
Tell me a little about your experience working with Robert Duvall on
your latest film A Shot at Glory and lessons you took from him.
One of the main things I learned is that he comes to work prepared
everyday and he still cares about what he is doing after 45 years of an
acting career.  He doesn't take a day off at all and I respect that
because leading actors in films owe it to the audience to give 110% of
their efforts towards the production of the film.
When you were growing up, did your father Wings Hauser's acting career
propel you to take on the profession of an actor or was it an
independent choice?  I am aware that you didn't meet your father until
you were 11.
When I was growing up, I never really knew my father. I didn't get know
my father until I was about 14 years old.  When I was talking to him as
a young actor starting out, I singled out great performances of his and
talked to him about the business and how he was able to reach those
performances and it gave me confidence to take on more challenging
roles.  It was difficult though, when I was young, because growing up
away from a father figure, you develop your own ways of taking care of
yourself.  When the father figure comes back into your life and tries to
guide you and tell you what to do, it's a little weird and hard to
handle at times.
To be honest, I would like to have a completely different career than
his. He portrayed pretty much the heavy characters -- the tough guy, the
bad guy.  He did a great job in those roles but I enjoy playing the hero
as much as playing the bad guy.  The bad guy roles are much more
intriguing to an actor because you get to play a whole bunch of
different levels and be able to showcase your talent as an actor. 
Sometimes the leads and the supporting characters are the most boring
people in a film and the adversary is a challenge to successfully
portray.
I haven't spoken to him in a long time but I love him to death and hope
he is having a good time wherever he is.
For your newest film, Tigerland, you worked under the direction of Joel
Schumacher.  I've never been a fan of his work at all and was interested
in what you learned working with him and your general impression of him
as a director.
It was great working with him.  He's a dear man and is very genuine and
a good-hearted person.  His directing career has produced good stuff and
other stuff that in the eyes of the public and media has failed.  With
this movie, he casts some amazing young actors that will probably be on
the forefront of the next wave of leading mean in the next five to ten
years.  He did a wonderful job of giving the actors the freedom to
express themselves and their characters motivations.  In my part as
Sergeant Cota, he gave me as much freedom as I've ever had from a
director.  He even let me write a scene for the movie, which ended up
making the final cut of the film.  I haven't one thing negative to say
about Mr. Schumacher.

Review for Filth and the Fury, The (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/583d5a965b4ac9cb88256894000d43fd?OpenDocument
Good documentaries aren't hard to find.  Great documentaries are few and
far between the cracks of cinematic achievements.
The new documentary The Filth and the Fury ranks as one of the great
ones.  It chronicles the rise and tragic fall of the infamous British
Punk band The Sex Pistols, and the cultural impact they have spread upon
the world around us.  Director Julian Temple takes the film far above
the usual VH-1 retrospectives, recounting past glories, drug parties,
and the way a musician found God in a motel in Alabama, thus bringing
together the catalytic elements that resulted in the musical movement
called `Punk.'  The Sex Pistols were the forefathers of that movement.
In the late seventies, Britain's social upheaval was severe.  A stagnant
economy, unemployment, race riots, looting, and strikes intersected with
a strong distaste for royalty and the upper class.  A working class
revolution was in the works.  Punk music was its Gabriel's Trumpet, and
the Pistols were blowing with all of their might.
With this backdrop, the film then beautifully intertwines social
commentary with television commercials of the time, footage of riots,
and various news reports.  The film then juxtaposes current and past
interviews with all five band members as well as home footage of the
bandmates' childhood (including a rare interview with Sid Vicious before
his death in 1978).  The intimacy of these interviews and the evidence
of the social strife validate the actions of the members of the Pistols
and really makes you feel what the band was trying to convey in the
words and rhythms of its music.
Julian Temple was also responsible for the first film concerning the
rise and fall of the Sex Pistols: The Great Rock and Roll Swindle.  That
film painted the Pistols as a brilliant marketing tool in the hands of
their manager, Malcolm MacLaren.  The Filth and the Fury sets the record
straight for the first time.  It gives great insight into the
motivations of the Pistols, but it also gives the uneducated a great
perspective on how the Punk movement began and how it all came hurtling
to a blind halt by commercialism, social pressure, and the fear of
individuality.

Review for Human Traffic (1999)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/33fa9bf0128812dd882568df006c08df?OpenDocument
Any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to
master.  Any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the
dumbing-down of the experience to make it "more accessible" to the
general public.  Or the film is produced and directed by people that
have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to
work as production assistants for VH1.  Human Traffic, a new film
exploring the British underground party/rave scene and the people
immersed in the world of clubbing, pubbing, drugs, sex, and the
beautiful, beautiful music, is an example of how it really ought to be
done.
The film follows five Brits in their young twenties during a wild
weekend of parties, drugs, dancing, sex, pop culture discussions,
relationships, and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum
interrupts.  The cast of character consists of Jip (John Simm), our
narrator, who has a bit of a problem with his willy, known as Mr.
Floppy.  Koop (Shaun Parkes), our black DJ maestro, who has insecurity
issues, afraid his girlfriend Nina (Nicola Reynolds) is shagging other
men.  Nina herself can't stand her McJob and longs for the freedom of
the weekends.  Lulu (Lorraine Pilkington), Jip's best mate, is tired of
her cheating boyfriends.  And Moff (Danny Dyer) can't seem to escape the
black hole of his awful life.  The film follows these five individuals
during one weekend as each of them discovers love, friendship, and
self-fulfillment, all against the raging party background.
Human Traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while
being visually alive, as director Justin Kerrigan's subtle use of the
camera lets the audience become part of the action.  The use of direct
communication to the audience by the collection of characters works
well, making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters.
Dialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace, and the acting is
confident.  However, the two females leads tend to promote their
relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows
through when poignancy is needed.
Human Traffic does not try to explain the rave scene.  Instead, it gives
the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it, letting you
choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that
brings together strangers, friends, and lovers for one blissful night of
music and peace.

Review for Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/f46dd27a27b6b6ca8825692a007eee60?OpenDocument
I don't expect much from Eddie Murphy these days.  For the past four
years, the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio
conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another.  
Such films as Metro, Doctor Dolittle, Holy Man, Life, and Bowfinger have
reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up
hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th Century Fox and Universal
Pictures.  The biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest
film, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.
The Klumps once again revisits the life of Sherman Klump, an overweight
university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places. 
Sherman has just invented a new "youth drink" that enables man or beast
to become younger for a short period of time.  Janet Jackson is the love
interest who chooses the lovable Sherman for a soul mate rather than
excel at her career as a university professor (and for the most
ridiculous reasons).  With love on his mind, Sherman is determined to
rid himself of his alter ego, Buddy Love from the first Professor, who
still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes Sherman to act
like a bad imitation of Vince Vaughn from Swingers.  With some
convoluted mumbo-jumbo about DNA extraction, Sherman extracts the "Buddy
Love" link in his DNA and smartly deposits Buddy into a handy-dandy lab
beaker.  But one night, the beaker is knocked over and Buddy Love is
regenerated... because every movie like this needs an unnecessary
villain to thwart the good guy.
Then the Klump family, all played by Eddie Murphy, step in for some
comedic relief involving old people having sex, flabby breasts, a slew
of fart and dick jokes, and enough fat people jokes that I lost count
after the first thirty minutes.  And did I mention the part where Larry
Miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster?  The movie finally
dissolves into a really bad Hallmark Family Special about realizing who
you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting
and people on the verge of tears in every scene.
Pure and simple, The Klumps is a failure.  Its script was handled by not
one but five screenwriters, and it really shows during the awkward
transitions between scenes.  Any sense of story and plot were lost in
the rewrite process.  It's more discerning to learn that Chris Weitz and
Paul Weitz, the team behind one of the funniest films of the last
decade, American Pie, have their names stamped to this trash.  Hey guys
- quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes.
The characterization of Sherman's family, The Klumps, is one of the most
ignorant stereotypes of a black family I have ever seen in cinema. 
Everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean
at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough.  The Grandma is an
oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her
sagging breasts.  The Father is gruff, is fired from a blue-collar job,
is sexually inadequate, and cannot communicate with his family about his
feelings.  The Mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and
seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone.  The Brother is
silent and brooding and resembles the Ice Cube gangster character from
Boyz in the Hood.  Sherman himself is terribly insecure and never
conveys anything for the audience to become attached to.
But the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type
of convincing conversational or situational comedy.  The family scenes
from the first Nutty Professor worked so well because their
conversations were short and direct.  And you got the feeling that these
crass people couldn't act like this all the time.  The sequel does the
reverse and drives the negatives of the Klumps right in to the hilt,
making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the
last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic.  After a while, their
conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with
indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from
any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story.
Its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of Rick Baker -- who worked
on the original Nutty Professor and won an Academy Award for his work on
An American Werewolf in London -- and amazing digital special effects
that enabled Murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions
are built around such a lame story line.  Even the best effects can't
seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days.
Now that I think about it, the worst thing about this film has to be all
the money that it will make.  People will be lined up around the block
for it.  The studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer
of 2002.  Eddie Murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or
five roles, but he'll play every character in the movie.
I just can't wait to see Eddie Murphy in a love scene with himself.

Title
Review for e-Dreams (2001)
All great things come to an end, and the dot-com era embodies that
perfectly.  Beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of
a former dot-com darling, the company Kozmo.com, an online convenience
store stocked with ice cream, porn videos, and other basic necessities
of a urban dweller, all hand-delivered by couriers within an hour.
Designed in 1997 by two college roommates -- Joseph Parks, a 27 year old
Goldman Sachs banker, and Yong Kang - Kozmo flamed out in three short
years, raising more than $280 million in venture capital funding and
from partnerships with such bigwigs as Starbucks and Amazon.com.  By
December 1999, the company boasted 4,000 employees in 11 cities, its
barking CEO Park attracting all kinds of media attention.  The company
was set for an IPO in May 2000... until April 14, 2000, the day the
stock market took its first big dive, ending the Internet era.  By April
13, 2001, Kozmo was out of money and ceased operations.
Unlike the earlier, similar documentary Startup.com, which chronicled
the rise and fall of another dot-com, GovWorks, e-dreams focuses both on
its original founders, especially Park, and on the common folks that ran
the day-to-day operations.  The contrast is amazing, showing how a cult
persona can convince anyone that any idea is the Next Big Thing.
The film's director, Wonsuk Chin (Too Tired to Die), expertly juxtaposes
upper management company meetings with on-the-spot interviews with the
bike messengers, general managers, and floor staff that kept Kozmo
humming.  The film's images give a backbone to the company and provide
an emotional edge to its ultimate demise.
The most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding, to a
degree, the expectations of numerous CEOs commanding these Titanic-type
businesses.  In the film's final interviews with Park, we learn what
happens when the money dries up and backers don't return phone calls. 
In the end, the name of the game was profit, and if you couldn't make
money, even the dreamers got the axe.
Screened at the 24th Annual Mill Valley Film Festival.

Title
Review for Tomcats (2001)
The one statement used in defining a film that drives fear and loathing
into my heart is invariably "an outlandish comedy."  They try in vain to
recycle the originality of American Pie, Porky's, Road Trip, or South
Park, attempting to meld a T&A gross-out contest with a love story, and
they always fail miserably.
Tomcats wins, hands-down, the lowest common denominator award so far
this year.  It's a trashy, sexist, crude comedy revolving around the
values of commitment, honesty, and screwing your friends over for half a
million dollars.  In the process, it throws us numerous sex partners,
Bill Maher playing a thug named Carlos, true love, and an escaping
testicle.
Here's the plot. A group of seven buddies individually throw together
$1,000 in a betting pool and the last man unwed gets the prize money. 
Jerry O'Connell, who will forever be the fat kid from Stand by Me, plays
a two-dimensional struggling cartoonist named Michael, who ends up
losing $51,000 in Vegas shooting craps.  Unable to pay the debt, a
quasi-take-no-shit mob boss named Carlos (Bill Maher) gives him 30 days
to come up with the money or else forfeit his life.  Michael concocts a
scheme to win the pot, which has grown to $500,000 through mutual fund
investing, by getting his buddy Kyle (Jake Busey, the man with the
largest incisors in the world) married.  Michael finds Natalie (Shannon
Elizabeth), an old flame of Kyle's, and convinces her to marry him
whereupon they'll split the money.
A few questions raced through my mind during the screening.  Could
Shasta McNasty be creditable as a romantic lead?  How could Bill Maher
play a thug named Carlos?  Could that foreign-exchange chick from
American Pie actually act her way through a movie with all of her
clothes on?  How could the screenwriter of Rosewood write and direct "an
outlandish comedy"?  How many chicks in skimpy outfits would there
ultimately be?
Tomcats is as a light as the edited-for-TV version of Animal House.  The
acting is sub-par, the comedy is nonexistent, the thought of a man
chasing a severed testicle through a hospital is pitiful, and a fat man
falling down in every scene is only funny if it's Chris Farley.  Which
it isn't.  The parody corniness also has to stop.  I never imagined that
John Woo's trademark use of birds, or rose petals falling onto a
semi-naked girl would become instant clichés through overuse.  With
Tomcats, these routines get groans from the audience.
If bad acting, hot chicks in skimpy outfits, a script devoid of humor,
champagne laced with a Viagra-like substance, lesbian threesomes, and
Jerry O'Connell being whipped by an S&M grandmother are your idea of a
hot date, Tomcats is the movie for you.  If not, save your eight bucks
and spend it at your local strip club.
Director: Greg Poirier
Producers: Paul Kurta, Alan Riche, Tony Ludwig
Writer: Greg Poirier

Review for Tigger Movie, The (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/a1fda18037607f220825687f00082b58?OpenDocument
Bouncy, flouncy, trouncy, pouncy, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.  The
wonderful thing about The Tigger Movie is it's fun for everyone.  And it
truly is.  Guaranteed to bring both smiles and tears to every face,
young and old alike, Walt Disney Pictures' The Tigger Movie is a
refreshing surprise.
OK, I'll be the first to admit it  I wasn't looking forward to this
picture.  Yet another Disney animated epic, jam-packed with computer
generated cels, overdone musical numbers, and one-dimensional characters
that long ago stopped being characters and became cartoons.  "More
colorful fluff to sell t-shirts, pajamas and tennis shoes," I mumbled to
myself as I took my seat.  "Eye candy."  But as the curtain drew up to
reveal a pre-movie Disney-style mambo from Lou Vega (of "Mambo No.9"
fame), I was whisked back to a time when a man named Walt Disney first
introduced us to our imaginations.
The new Tigger Movie is simply, beautifully done, and art director Toby
Bluth has indeed created the definitive Pooh film.  The line drawings
are incredibly true to the original E.H. Shepard drawings from the A.A.
Milne books, and they are layered upon a breathtaking watercolor canvas.
Light and air seem to be literally washed into the scenes, giving the
Hundred Acre Wood an authentic English countryside feel, complete with
light-reflecting moisture. The color palette and the weather cleverly
follow the emotional arc of the story, ranging from rich and warm autumn
days to cold, purple and gray snowstorms.
If the stunning look of the new movie doesn't reel you directly in, the
script and characters will.  Kudos to first-time director and
screenwriter Jun Falkenstein for breathing life into the classic world
of Pooh that we remember.  The vernacular and dialogue hold true to the
original stories, and the characters are rich and full, giving a
perspective to each player that we have never seen before.  Falkenstein
allows us to delve a little bit deeper into the characters, and he
really makes them come alive.  Tigger displays a range of emotions that
is really quite sophisticated, and our lovable, bumbling Pooh bear
remains as willy-nilly silly as ever.
In another brilliant brainstorm, Falkenstein has reunited the
award-winning songwriting team of Richard and Robert Sherman with
Disney.  Disney fans will remember the inimitable word play and charming
melodies of the Sherman brothers from movies such as Mary Poppins,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and The Jungle Book, to name a few.  In 1990,
the Sherman brothers were named `Disney Legends,' and we are not let
down by the six wonderful new songs from this movie, including a
Tiggerific new tongue-twisting `Whoop de dooper, loop de looper, ally
ooper bounce' song.
At the core of this new adventure is a heartwarming story that everyone
can relate to.  Tigger is in search of his family and embarks upon a
quest that inevitably leads him right back to the Hundred Acre Wood and
the friends who truly love him.  Tigger learns that family, more than
looking alike or being related by blood, is really about the people who
are closest to you and who really love you, through good times and bad.
The story stays simple and true, with a message that even the youngest
viewers will appreciate and enjoy.
Bouncing full of fun, laughter, tears and "indomitibibble" spirit, The
Tigger Movie has everything we hope for from the original Pooh, with new
life and depth.  Complete with the narrative talents of John Hurt
(replacing Sebastian Cabot), an exquisite vocal cast, and even one epic
Fantasia-esque song sequence full of all the pomp and color we expect
from Disney (yes, there are even synchronized Tigger-swimmers and a
hummingbird chorus), The Tigger Movie (that's T-I-double Guh-E-R-R) is
not to be missed.  Take your kids, take your date, take your grandma 
this one would do Walt proud.

Review for Romeo Must Die (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/a0254e68017faff8882568aa000a50a3?OpenDocument
Romeo Must Die is a jetliner of film headed straight for black ice.
Namely, it subsists on ridiculous action sequences meshed together by
predictable plot points and truly horrible acting.  Fueled by the
`Monopoly Money' pockets of Joel Silver  the guy responsible for such
titles as The Matrix, the Lethal Weapon series, and Richie Rich  this
movie is bad. Really bad.
It's such a damn shame when such a talent and versatile actors like Jet
Li and Delroy Lindo re subjected to portray such stereotypical, mundane,
pointless characters.  To all those who are unaware of Jet Li, stop
reading right now and run down to your local video story and ask for
Once Upon a Time in China, Bodyguard from Beijing, and Hitman.  You
might have seen him in that techno-redubbed version of Black Mask or as
the evil Chinese bad guy in Lethal Weapon 4 that had be shot and stabbed
before Mel Gibson could save face and not get his ass kicked again.  But
Jet Li's character in Romeo Must Die reminds me of the circus clown
hired to keep the kiddies smiling in the film.
When the film (a modern-day feuding mob tale set in New York) begins to
drag, director Andrzej Bartkowiak just brings in Li to perform some
amazing acrobatics and flying fists of fury to keep the audience awake.
It's a damn shame, again, because Bartkowiak -- cinematographer for such
films as Lethal Weapon 4 and The Devil's Advocate -- can't seem to
follow any of the action.  Jet Li moves so fast that the camera just
catches flashes and never the fire of his movements.
The addition of Aaliyah (the R&B singer chosen as one of Teen People
magazine's "21 Hottest Stars Under 21" for 1999) as one of the lead
characters that falls for Jet Li's character is the true point of
absurdity for the film.  During one of the most poignant moments in the
movie, her acting actually caused my rowfull of critics to burst into
uncontrollable laughter.  Aaliyah, put down the script and walk slowly
towards the exit, stage right.  Note to studio heads: The inclusion of a
singer among the cast will not increase your soundtrack sales.
Romeo Must Die could have worked beautifully as a dark, twisted tale of
family corruption and the values of loyalty and honor.  All of the
elements were present for success.  But it inevitable turns into some
lemon drop-sweetened nightmare, two hours long.
Perhaps the best description I can give you are the words of two ladies
walking out of the screening, `That was some whacked shit!'  I'll say.

Review for Titus (1999)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/bc546966d8a331478825686a0027acb4?OpenDocument
Okay... I'm kinda lost.  Who the hell is Titus Andronicus, you may ask,
fellow reader, and why the hell was I never forced to read this
Shakespearean play in high school or English 1A in college.  Well, Titus
A. was the first play by Bill Shakespeare, but if I am wrong, you crazy
Shakespearean cultists out there, please don't hunt me down and make me
read the unabridged version of Hamlet, about the usual themes of the
mighty Bill: Revenge, hatred, a little bit of incest, honor, mental
loopiness, and damn good human mincemeat pie.  The hard part of trying
to bring Shakespeare to life through either film or stage production is
trying to cut through all of the pompous attitude of the director and
making an understandable, comprehensible piece of narrative.
The pompous attitude of this version of Titus, not to be confused with
the 1998 Germany TV movie `Titus und der Fluch der Diamanten', is what
drags this film along like a squirrel caught in the wheel well of a semi
driving cross country.  When I watch a film, I want to watch a film, not
a play.  When I watch a play, vice versa.  When Titus explodes across
the screen in the first five minutes, I was intrigued by the imagery of
a child making a mess of things with G.I. Joes and every condiment in
the fridge -- and then the whole world exploding outside his window.
Then as I settled in and began to take account of the situation during
the next twenty minutes of the film, my inner child screamed for mercy.
I was mentally beaten by the `imagery' and the ridiculousness of how
dramatic a person can be just by standing up and walking a few steps and
then sitting down again.  Where is Kenneth Branagh when we need him?
For the next 2 1/2 hours of sheer torment, I was witness to a parade of
the absurd.  Jessica Lange in an orgy, Hopkins naked in a bathtub makin'
drawings of his bum with the blood of his severed stump for a hand,
cannibalism, a drag queen for an emperor, a frame-up job that pales next
to the works of Mamet, and (yes) a human mincemeat pie.  I think the
spookiest thing I witnessed was a strange Blair Witch Project reference
with a chick whose tongue was cut out, like Josh the camera guy, and her
hands cut off and replaced by twigs.  Somebody better make a call to
Artisan and report this travesty.
The root of all of these errors falls on the heads of the production
crew that steered this oil tanker of a film onto the rocky cliffs of
Schumacher-land.  The clash of costume design that resulted in a strange
mix of both Mad Max and Flash Gordon outfits.  The flamboyant, over-done
MTV montages of dreaming and non-dreaming states of consciousness.  The
inclusion of Jessica Lange in a Roman orgy: Run away -- run away!  The
dead weight of subplots that needed a good dose of Walter Murch editing.
So why did I award this film with two stars instead of one?  Two
reasons: Human mincemeat pie and one great orgy.

Review for Fille sur le pont, La (1999)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://a.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/087b4b2a5a619ac58825693f0008c39c?OpenDocument
It's always rewarding to find in today's cinema a stark reminder of how
powerful the emotion of love can alter perception, reality, and reason
within a person.  Girl on the Bridge (La fille sur le pont) is one of
those stark reminders, a brutally grim and honest film of unacquainted
desire and the fearful reservations that follow two individuals looking
for that unattainable completion of one's faith and one's heart.
This disturbing and brilliant new film by renowned French filmmaker
Patrice Leconte - director of such films as Monsieur Hire, The
Hairdresser's Husband, and Ridicule - follows the tale of Adele, a
lovelorn girl who has been through too many one night stands and
promises of purposes.  She remarks in an unflinching five-minute opening
monologue, "I see my future like a waiting room in a train station, and
I sit there waiting for something to happen."  In this grim monologue,
the director Leconte portrays Adele, played with striking beauty and
prose by French singer Vanessa Paradis, as neither a slut nor a vixen
but as an emotionally confused girl who doesn't understand the
difference between love and sex.
Later, Adele ends up later that night on the edge of a bridge
overlooking the Seine, contemplating the murky waters below.  From the
darkness appears an older man named Gabor, played by the great French
actor Daniel Auteuil, a knife-throwing expert in need of an assistant
for his performances.  He tries to persuade Adele from jumping but she
ends up in the river; naturally, he saves her.  While in the hospital,
Gabor convinces Adele that her luck is changing by demonstrating his
extrasensory talents.  She joins him as his assistant, and during their
first performance, Adele develops a telepathic link with Gabor that
directs his blades.
Their journey continues to places such as Monaco and San Reno as Adele
and Gabor use their clairvoyance to win big at casinos and amaze
audiences with the knife-throwing performances.  But their relationship
sours because of the attention Adele gets, and the film gets more
disturbing from there.
Director Patrice Leconte chose the shoot the film in black and white to
add to the timelessness of the picture.  He also chose a variety of
music, such as Benny Goodman, Marianne Faithful, Brenda Lee, and the
Istanbul Oriental Ensemble, to make the movie sound quite diverse.  The
tight dialogue follows a solid pattern of delivering poignancy with the
pretensions of the subject matter as Adele and Gabor subconsciousness
move towards each other's hearts and minds.  The telepathic connection
between the characters is handled with conviction and makes you believe
that the link is solely derived from the unity of the two minds and
hearts.
The film also holds distinct elements of a dream state.  The first
moments of the film give ground for interpretation that the mysteries
and travels of Adele are in fact the fantasies of a lonely and depressed
girl looking for something, anything in this world.  The direct honesty
of Gabor and his unadulterated feelings for Adele seem to reach out to
the audience and pull them into the complexity of his love and desire
for this woman.  His words are brutal but fair and demand no sympathy
from Adele.
Admittedly, French cinema is a tough beast to understand.  The stark
dialogue is uncommon in American cinema and the development of
characters is sometimes without a roadmap and lacks the emotional
shortcuts of Hollywood.  Good French cinema is powerful and demands your
attention for full appreciation.  Give Girl on the Bridge all of your
mind.

Review for Cecil B. DeMented (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/40c8363506aed00a8825691e000b8c16?OpenDocument
Hollywood is a pimp.  A fat, cigar-smoking chump wearing a fur hat and
12 gold chains around its fat, hairy chest.  All of its stars and
starlets are an evil brood of scum-sucking vampires looking for the next
percentage take, the next summer blockbuster, the next casting couch to
audition on.  Pumping out comic-book adaptations, terrible sequels to
mediocre films, and remakes of foreign films to the nearest American
movie multiplex mall theater equipped with thin walls and bad sound
systems. How much longer can the works of Peckinpah, Fassbinder, Fuller,
Castle, Preminger, and Lee be placed and forgotten in the wrong sections
of the local Blockbuster stores?  How many more Silver and Weinstein
films can we enduring in this stinky, decaying state of American cinema?
But now, from John "I don't give a shit what you think about my movies"
Waters, comes the siren call to all frustrated filmmakers and
aficionados: Cecil B. DeMented, a warped and twisted tale of how far a
filmmaker will go to create a personal vision of internal and social
revolution.
Stephen Dorff, in a career-defining role, is Cecil B. DeMented, a crazed
director devoted to making the most radical underground film.  Together
with his film production cult, the Sprocket Holes - who wear tattoos of
Peckinpah, Lee, Fuller, Castle, Anger, Fassbinder, Preminger on various
parts of their bodies as badges of honor, they kidnap a Hollywood movie
starlet, played with perfect ridiculousness by Melaine Griffith, and
force her to take the starring role in DeMented's film.
With no budget and no contracts for extras, DeMented and his crew take
to the streets for production of Raving Beauty, a crass terrorist film
about an angry owner of an independent theater and her brood out to
destroy the mainstream film business.  Using "ultimate reality" - with
real bullets, real people, and real terror - DeMented and his crew of
misfits attack a mall theater, terrorize the Maryland Film Commission
and crash a movie studio shooting a certain sequel to a really annoying
Tom Hanks film.  Demented's crewmembers are maimed and killed, popcorn
machines are used for target practice, and no one can have sex until the
film is complete.  It's like Bowfinger, only, you know, good.
The film moves with zigs and zags like the Magic Bullet of Kennedy's
assassination.  The zeal of DeMented's cause catches quickly and conveys
the urgent message of "doing something, anything, for the accomplishment
of artistic motivations."  The crewmembers all hold the quirkiness
common in Water's previous films - Pink Flamingos, Hairspray, Polyester,
Pecker -- and speak in the choppy, jaded dialogue used frequently by
Waters.  It is as if Water's script strips away the unnecessary dialogue
common to most pretentious indie films and just delivers the goods.
Cecil takes such warped avenues of expression that it seems like it
might actually outdo itself.  You can see how a major studio might take
this film, re-edit it, cut a deal with the remaining crew members who
are still alive, and make a few sequels, a la The Blair Witch Project.
But that's for the future.  Overall, the ride is fantastic; it's one of
Water's best films to date and this year's Fight Club for filmmakers.

Title
Review for Animal, The (2001)
It's always a shame when good comedic talent goes bad, and a pleasant
surprise when that finally lands a decent role in a funny film.  Nothing
has been expected of Rob Schneider since his departure from the hellhole
of mind-numbing roles like the Copy Guy Richmeister and the Weed Guy on
Saturday Night Live, as well as bit parts in ridiculous Muppet Movie
sequels and Adam Sandler comedies.  But Rob Schneider is a funny man.  I
remember watching him at the Improv in San Diego when I was 12 years old
and laughing my ass off at his brilliant portrayal of Elvis on a
fishhook.  I was 12, but what the hey?
Modern comedy comes from its ability to not take its story or its
characters seriously.  The Farrelly brothers and Woody Allen have taught
us that.  Recent failures like Joe Dirt and Schneider's last film Deuce
Bigalow: Male Gigolo owe themselves to a seriousness they try to create
by treating their main characters as martyrs for the audience to
sympathize with and pity.  The Animal does no such thing, avoiding this
common mistake totally and developing into an enjoyable and hilarious 90
minutes.
Our tale: Marvin Mage (Schnieder) is a loser to the tenth degree.  He
makes Screech from Saved by the Bell look like a romantic lead in a
Shakespearean tragedy.  Stuck with the lowly job of file clerk for the
local police force, Marvin longs for the glory and honor of becoming a
real police officer like his dearly departed father.  When Marvin
answers a 911-robbery call, he ends up in one of the funniest car
crashes ever imprinted on celluloid.  A deranged scientist (Michael
Canton) rescues Marvin from the wreckage, rebuilds his body
RoboCop-style with animal parts (refugees from a traveling Mexican
circus), and Marvin's newfound animal instincts naturally kick into full
effect when he's released back into the general population.
Stupid?  Yes.  I just never would have thought a cross-dressing monkey
doing the moonwalk would be so damn funny.
Marvin meets and falls in love with the chick from the first season of
Survivor (Colleen Haskell), uses his extra-keen sense of smell to sniff
out drugs from perpetrators' rectal areas, rescues a drowning boy
Flipper-style, consumes enough Slim Jims to keep Macho Man Randy Savage
happy, humps a mailbox, and tries to make sweet love to a goat in heat. 
Again: Stupid?  Yes.  But the bizarre situations dreamed up by
screenwriters Schneider and Tom Brady work, and Schneider sells it for
all he's worth.  Trust me --it's funny.  Very funny.  I'm almost ashamed
that I laughed out loud so much.
The only real problem is that it all falls apart in the end, a good idea
stretched way beyond its limits.  The script degrades with too many plot
twists, relying on cameos from Norm Macdonald and Adam Sandler for comic
relief in its last 20 minutes.  In the end, it's, ahem, beating a dead
horse.
With The Animal under his belt, Schneider demonstrates that the innate
comedic talent I witnessed years ago is still down there somewhere. 
Let's just hope this isn't a fluke for the Richmeister.
Director: Luke Greenfield
Producer: Barry Bernardi, Carr D'Angelo, Todd Garner
Writer: Tom Brady, Rob Schneider

Title
Review for Fast and the Furious, The (2001)
Fast cars, scantily clad women, bare-knuckle brawls, and guns, guns,
guns!
What more could be expected from a guilty pleasure-ridden American
popcorn movie like The Fast and the Furious.  Nothing of substance or
intelligence is ever really expected from a summer movie, much less when
that movie bears a title akin to a bad porno flick.  The Fast and the
Furious was exactly how I felt leaving the theater: Hightailing it back
home, furious at how quickly the movie fell apart.  I mean, how the hell
could you screw up something as slam-dunk-awesome as souped-up
performance cars amidst the illegal street racing subculture of the L.A.
Basin?
Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is the main bad-ass dude of L.A.'s illegal
street racing circuit.  He runs a performance car tune-up shop, along
with his colorful team of misfits and mechanical geniuses.  But is he
the guy responsible for the recent hijackings of big-rigs full of
performance car electronics?
Undercover cop Brian Spindler (Paul "Don't call me Keanu" Walker)
saunters to crack the case, showing up in a green Eclipse with enough
nitrous to blow up a city block.  His job is to infiltrate Dominic's
crew and find out who's pulling the hijacking jobs before his
stereotypical commanding officer eats up too much of his screen time. 
During his investigation, Brian is taken under the wing of Dominic and
into the underground world of illegal street racing, where he learns how
to avoid potholes and ignore plot holes.
Coo as Brian falls in love with Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana
Brewster)!  Watch as Brian leaps so gracefully out of the way of
ill-tempered Asian gangs with automatic weapons!  Feel the thrill when
Brian learns how to leave a Ferrari in the dust!  And ultimately, try to
hold back the tears as Brian begins to question his loyalty to the badge
versus the respect and honor of his newfound "racing family."  It's
Point Break all over again.
The first twenty minutes of The Fast and the Furious are a real treat. 
I even thought that hack director Rob Cohen (an old Miami Vice director
who was responsible for such classics as Daylight and The Skulls) could
have pulled this off with sweeping cameras angles and tight, tight
editing.  All Cohen needed to do was keep the action hot and heavy with
racecars flying by, chicks making out in hallways, and fists flying. 
Sadly, the studio wanted a PG-13 rating for the film in order to get the
kiddies in and ultimately homogenizes the movie into a regurgitated
episode from Starsky and Hutch.  A horrendous ending doesn't help.
Even Vin Diesel, a strong actor with great turns in such films as Pitch
Black and Boiler Room, spends half the movie trying to create a
sympathetic character while frantically looking for a way out of the
film.  Which he doesn't find until the credits roll...  See it or don't,
but remember one thing either way: a Honda Civic can't slide under a
big-rig trailer without bodily harm coming to all involved.
Director: Rob Cohen
Producer: Neal Moritz
Writer: Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, David Ayer
Starring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster,
Ted Levine, Ja Rule, Rick Yune

Title
Review for Proof of Life (2000)
Good films are hard to find these days.  Great films are beyond rare. 
Proof of Life, Russell Crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue
thriller, is one of those rare gems.  A taut drama laced with strong and
subtle acting, an intelligent script, and masterful directing, together
it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these
days, genuine motivation in a story that rings true.
Consider the strange coincidence of Russell Crowe's character in Proof
of Life making the moves on a distraught wife played by Meg Ryan's
character in the film -- all while the real Russell Crowe was hitching
up with married woman Meg Ryan in the outside world.  I haven't seen
this much chemistry between actors since McQueen and McGraw teamed up in
Peckinpah's masterpiece, The Getaway.
But enough with the gossip, let's get to the review.
The film revolves around the kidnapping of Peter Bowman (David Morse),
an American engineer working in South America who is kidnapped during a
mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers.  Upon discovering
his identity, the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million. 
The only problem is that the company Peter Bowman works for is being
auctioned off, and no one will step forward with the money.  With no
choice available to her, Bowman's wife Alice (Ryan) hires Terry Thorne
(Crowe), a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative, to arrange
the return of her husband.  But when things go wrong -- as they always
do in these situations -- Terry and his team (which includes the most
surprising casting choice of the year: David Caruso) take matters into
their own hands.
The film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and
creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with
well-written dialogue, shades of motivation, and convincing acting by
all the actors.  The script is based on both a book (The Long March To
Freedom) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations,
and the story has been sharply pieced together by Tony Gilroy,
screenwriter of The Devil's Advocate and Dolores Claiborne.
The biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between Crowe and
Ryan, but that between Crowe and David Caruso.  Dug out from B-movie
hell, Caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as Crowe's right hand gun
while providing most of the film's humor.  Ryan cries a lot and smokes
too many cigarettes, David Morse ends up getting everyone at the
guerilla camp to hate him, and Crowe provides another memorable acting
turn as the stoic, gunslinger character of Terry Thorne.
The most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes.  The
bulk of those scenes, which bookend the movie, work extremely well as
establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters. 
The scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and
poise.  Director Taylor Hackford mixes both his old-school style of
filmmaking with the dizziness of a Lars Von Trier film.
Proof of Life is a thinking man's action movie.  It is a film about the
choices men and women make in the face of love and war, and the
sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you
sleep at night.

Review for Rules of Engagement (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/3cfb7dbc874650df882568930009921c?OpenDocument
The best thing about being a critic is getting to see unreleased films
weeks and sometimes months before the general audience does.  The
toughest thing about being a critic is being subjected to the waste
products of the movie industry, run by conglomerates that wouldn't know
a Cronenberg film from a bottle of Heineken.
Rules of Engagement is one of these waste products: pulling together a
great cast, a great story idea, and a great director, then letting it
all fall apart into a mess of things I wouldn't even blame Joel
Schumacher for.
The movie revolves around the trial of an accused Army officer (Samuel
Jackson) trying to subdue an attack on the US Embassy in Yemen, but who
ends up quelling the dispute by having his men fire into the crowd of
demonstrators.  All evidence that would justify his actions becomes MIA,
and he calls upon his friend and fellow comrade-in-arms, Tommy Lee
Jones, to defend him.  Jones complies out of a sense of honor, because
during a tour in Nam, Jackson saved Jones' ass during a VC ambush.
Soon, everything turns against Jackson and his defense team, and then
the movie runs through about three or four different plot twists stolen
from such films as The Verdict, The Rainmaker, A Few Good Men, and
Courage Under Fire.  In the end, I was clawing at my seat, wanting to
run home and watch a decent film to remind myself why I like movies in
the first place.
Strangely, all the elements of the film were there.  It starts with a
great cast of Tommy Lee Jones, Sam Jackson, Guy Pearce (doing his best
De Niro impression), Philip Baker Hall, Ben Kingsley, Anne Archer, and
Kim Delaney.  Running the show is the great William Friedkin, of such
films as The Exorcist, French Connection, and To Live and Die in L.A.
There's a compelling story of a man's defense of his honor and the
comrades compelled the stand by him to defend said honor.  A background
littered with the conflict of war and the regrets of past defeats.  How
can you screw that up?
Well, you just can.  The film is flawed on many fronts:  The horrible
miscasting of Guy Pearce as a Brooklyn Navy lawyer "just trying to get
to the truth of things."  A ridiculous courtroom scene that had me
waiting for someone to scream, "You can't handle the truth!"  Choppy
direction, which feels like Friedkin was running the show at first but
then an assistant director took the helm.  The underdeveloped characters
of Jones and Jackson.  Any semblance of "acting."  And a really, really
bad ending that tells us sickly that the brutality of war is
justifiable.
The shoulders that carry most of the blame are the screenwriters, who
failed to piece together anything resembling a cohesive plot.  To wit,
two rules should be followed in the future whenever a studio is
considering to greenlighting a film. 1) Do not hire a former Secretary
of the U.S. Navy to write the screenplay. 2) Shy away from accepting
scripts from one of the uncredited screenwriters of I Still Know What
You Did Last Summer.
Director: William Friedkin
Writers: James Webb, Stephen Gaghan
Producers: Scott Rudin, Richard Zanuck
Starring: Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel Jackson, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley,
Anne Archer

Title
Review for Get Carter (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/b62a62184652dd51882569770013523d?OpenDocument
Forget Get Carter.  Instead... get me a cup of coffee.
What the hell has happened to all good American action movies?  Did I
unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere?  When did all of the bad-ass,
kicking butt and taking names, gun-toting, crazed, vengeful characters
of the 1980's -- from such films as Commando, Cobra, Predator, Raw Deal,
First Blood -- suddenly turn into innocent, compassionate, sensitive,
teary-eyed knuckleheads.  The only place to turn these days for an
honest action film is towards the East -- and I don't mean New York
City.
Get Carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian Sylvester
Stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars
trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown. 
Stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with
his Members Only jacket and Izod polo shirt with the collar popped up.
A few years ago, Stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to
gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey.  That
role was Sheriff Freddy Heflin in Copland -- a strange film about
redemption within a broken soul.  Stallone actually gave an amazing
performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past.  Too bad Get
Carter returns Stallone to action, but with the shiny paint rusted off
on the edges.
Get Carter is a simple story.  Stallone plays Frank Carter, a Vegas
bruiser for a loan shark (played with amazing gusto by the uncredited
voice of actor Tom Sizemore).  When Frank's brother gets himself killed
in a drunk driving accident, Frank, feeling all guilty and mushy inside,
thinks foul play is involved and travels to Seattle to set right all the
wrongs with the patented "Carter's Way".  He talks tough with his
brother's wife, lends a helping had to his brother's daughter Doreen
(Rachel Leigh Cook), and walks around Seattle in the pouring rain
dressed like a lost member of the Rat Pack with a really bad goatee.
Carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a
slimy porn king played by ultra-cool, McQueen-esque Mickey Rourke, a
multi-millionaire computer geek (Alan Cumming), and a strange foreign
guy (Michael Caine) who speaks in riddles and talks tough.  Carter
stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and
how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties.
What a minute!  This sounds just like another film I saw last year, The
Limey.  Better not tell Terence Stamp about Stallone ripping him off. 
Actually, Get Carter is a remake of the 1971 British production of the
same name, starring Caine in the title role (and what with his cameo
here, the cleverness is astonishing).
While Stallone still carries his own weight here, the movie lacks what
the original did as well: Purpose.  Throughout the film, Stallone looks
like an old guy trying to act tough, while nobody is taking him
seriously.  His one-liners fall flat, and he seems tired and uncertain
of all the actions, mental and physical, required of his character. 
There is even a strange homoeroticism between Rourke and Stallone that
lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists
and words.
The biggest surprise in Get Carter is that the best job done in the film
is by the versatile Mickey Rourke.  An amazing Method actor in the
eighties who fell into drugs, spousal abuse, a boxing career, and an
intolerable attitude towards not getting his way, Rourke still brings a
dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character.  He may not win
any Oscars, but he still ranks highly in my book.
Get Carter has great directing, strong acting by Rourke and Caine, and
energetic car chases that would make William Friedkin proud.  The only
thing it lacks - as with most Hollywood productions -- is a good script
and proper casting.  Never mind that it should never have been made at
all.

Review for Planet of the Apes (2001)
Tim Burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director
of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance,
and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered
marketing materials for crap movies.  And here he hits rock bottom, with
Planet of the Apes.
I didn't expect much from this latest "interpretation" of Pierre
Boulle's classic novel Planet of the Apes.  I mean, how could you top
the force and impact of the original film, intelligently co-scripted by
Rod Serling (of Twilight Zone fame) combined with the overbearing Chuck
Heston growling and yelling at those "damn dirty apes," in one of his
best roles of his career?  Sadly, I sat down to watch Burton's version
of Planet of the Apes and within the first 20 minutes, I was checking my
watch and my girlfriend (a big fan of the original film) started to nod
off.
This time around, the story plays out like a cross between Enemy Mine,
Braveheart, and Project X.  Marky Mark Wahlberg, who was enjoyable in
Boogie Nights and The Corrupter, plays Leo Davidson, a hot shot U.S. Air
Force pilot.  Leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic
storms (no real explanation given in the film) and Leo sends one of his
genetically altered "smart" chimps into the storms to collect data.  Leo
and his crew lose communication with the chimp, Leo hops in another ship
to find the monkey, and then he's thrown through some type of time-space
wormhole which crashes lands on the Twentieth Century Fox studio
backlot, all mocked up to look like the Amazon jungle.
Leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a
slave trader named Limbo (Paul Giamatti) who in turn sells Leo to a
chimpanzee named Ari (Helena Bonham Carter).  The kind Ari then helps
Leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find Leo's ship. 
Along the way, monkeys played by Tim Roth (overacting his role of a
vicious general named Thade) and Michael Clarke Duncan (who further
enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie)
strive out to hunt down Leo and his band of human savages, just like
Battlefield Earth!  In the end, it all culminates into another
Braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene.
While Rick Baker's makeup work is amazing, the script is a pathetic
hodgepodge (courtesy of three writers), the acting is horrible, and the
"surprise" ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the
temple.  Wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a
Chuck Heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences.  
This remake, or re-interpretation, as Tim Burton has proclaimed it, is
an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film.  The ethical
arguments about the equality of species, fascism, and military buildup
have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue, an
unimaginative narrative structure, and a romance  between a monkey and a
human. Even Chuck Heston's anti-gun tirade (in the de rigeur cameo)
seems shallow and jokey.
But the main element missing from this Tim Burton Film is Tim Burton. 
Even though his name is plastered across every billboard in America,
John Badham could have directed this film.  Even Joel Schumacher could
have directed this film.  He probably should have.  Burton's predominant
themes of rejection, isolation, and the search for one's place in the
universe, as seen in Ed Wood, Edward Scissorshands, and Pee-Wee's Big
Adventure, are completely absent in this Planet.  I suppose that's what
happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole.

Title
Review for American Outlaws (2001)
Not so long ago, men by the names of Peckinpah, Ford, Leone, and
Eastwood made westerns.  Real westerns.  These were some of the best
films of the twentieth century.
Those days are gone.  Now we have crap like Wild Wild West to pass for
the western.  And that record is not improved with the unbearable tale
of American Outlaws.
Outlaws is yet another re-telling of the Jesse James legend, courtesy of
B-movie king James G. Robinson (producer of such classics as Wrongfully
Accused and Chill Factor).  Delayed since the spring, this version stars
the Irish hunka hunka burning love Colin Farrell (the best part of
Schumacher's Tigerland) as the bad-ass Jesse James.  Alas, any sense of
his character has been left on the ranch, leaving us with only cute
chicks like Ali Larter (minus the whipped cream) to watch.
The spin this time around: Fresh from serving as Southern militiamen in
the Civil War, Jesse James (Farrell), his brother Frank (Gabriel Macht),
and his pal Cole Younger (Scott Caan) lay down their arms and head home
to Missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended.  But
trouble is brewing in their small town of Liberty when evil railroad
baron Thaddeus Rains (Harris Yulin) and his cronies Rollin Parker (Terry
O'Quinn) and Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton) demand the boys turn over
their lands to the railroads.  The Jameses and the Youngers then join
forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down Missouri,
thus cutting off the railroad's financial surplus and playing Robin Hood
to the local people.
Along the way, the boys squabble over who's the cutest of the gang,
who's the most popular cowboy in the gang, and who ought to go on MTV's
Total Request Live.  They rob numerous banks with identical interiors,
always with the kindest of hearts, strutting in their grungy dusters as
Moby songs play in the background.  The witty banter they share could be
plastered within a Hallmark card.
The biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of Colin Farrell. 
After a great job in Tigerland, Farrell walks through this role easier
then Nicolas Cage in Gone in 60 Seconds.  And his American accent rivals
Richard Gere's Irish accent in The Jackal.  Combined with feeling like
Bonanza: The Teen Years, this homogenized production (toned down to get
the ever-popular PG-13 rating) gives us an invincible Jesse James that
quickly grows tiresome and boring.  The unbearable villains courtesy of
Timothy Dalton and Thaddeus Rains spend the entire film proclaiming that
everyone should be hanged, sucking out any energy left in the film.
Not to mention: The real story of Jesse James and his gang bears no
resemblance to the plot of American Outlaws.  Instead, the movie is full
of old, outrageous tales about the Wild West -- tales which went out of
style in 5-cent magazines about a century ago.
Director: Les Mayfield
Producer: James G. Robinson, Bill Gerber
Writer: Roderick Taylor, John Rodgers
Starring: Colin Farrell, Ali Larter, Scott Caan, Gabriel Macht, Timothy
Dalton, Terry O'Quinn, Ronny Cox, Harris Yulin

Review for Better Living Through Circuitry (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/4e5761f99b0e4936882568e400075e8f?OpenDocument
Everywhere you turn these days, the techo-rave revolution is erupting.
Feature articles in major magazines focusing on sound artists such as
Moby, Crystal Method, and Goldie.  Countless commercials fueled by
throbbing electronic beats.  My grandmother discussing the finer points
of Fatboy Slim's mixing techniques with me.  Art-house films keeping the
plot moving with the soothing noise of Underworld and Bedrock.  My
ghetto superstar brother Crackbaby constructing beats at raves in
Northern California every weekend.  And a total of three new films
coming out in the short span of two months dissecting this underground
culture that's rising the eyes and ears of the masses.
For one to understand this musical phenomenon, the new documentary
Better Living Through Circuitry is a solid foundation for converting the
facelessness of its subculture to a human level of understanding.  The
documentary focuses upon many aspects of the scene  the participants,
the promoters, the DJs, and the techno-artists/producers.  The film
provides insightful, candid interviews that clearly translate the
determination and the passion of these individuals.  And I was equally
impressed by the collection of artists included in the production:
Crystal Method, Moby, DJ Spooky, Carl Cox, Electric Skychurch, Wolfgang
Flur of Kraftwek, Frankie Bones, Meat Beat Manifesto, Juno Reactor, BT,
Scanner, Atomic Babies, Roni Size, Superstar DJ Keoki, Lords of Acid,
System 7, Death in Vegas.
A notable strength of the film was the directness and honesty the people
involved in the rave culture afforded the filmmakers.  Everyone  the
candy-ravers, the promoters, the DJs, the techno artists  shared with
the audience small pieces of the personal trials, tragedies, and
successes that brought them into this environment.  DJ Spooky and
Frankie Bones talk of their spiritual connection with deceased fathers
by playing and spinning the record collection they left behind.  The
candy-ravers discuss traveling over eight hours for one rave to dance
until dawn.  The promoters devoted the music and ignoring the greed of
the record labels that want to hire them to help expand their dance
catalogs.  The film also touches upon the negative aspects of the
culture -- the danger of the drugs and the government crackdown on rave
gatherings.  Ravers talk of people falling down dead in front of them
and others going to sleep and never waking up.  And on the flip side:
The DJs who find that the music acts as a drug stronger than any
chemical additives coursing through the brain.
The rave culture is constantly compared to the punk movement of the late
70s and early 80s, with studio-quality music being produced by
computer geeks in their bedrooms and garages. The Internet and computer
technology advances in recent years have also enhanced the ability of
unknown techno artists to spread their message and beats to the entire
world.  It is equally ironic that the film was shot in digital video and
then constructed in someone's bedroom with video editing software and a
Macintosh computer.  Pure DIY  do it yourself.
The main message of the film is that within the rave culture a constant
shift of music styles empowers the individuals within to guide and help
to create a unique culture as it evolves.  Put down your Backstreet Boys
disc, fill a backpack full of water and lollipops, wear some comfortable
shoes and clothes, find a warehouse full of people and big beats... and
start living your life.
Director: Jon Reiss
Featuring: Jason Bentley, Frankie Bones, Carl Cox, Ken Jordan, Keoki,
Scott Kirkland, Moby, Natalie Portman, Roxanne, Roni Size, DJ Spooky
Producers: Brian McNelis and Stuart Swezey

Title
Review for Company Man (2000)
I have to admit something before I write this review.  I am a die-hard
conspiracy nut who loves the outrageous claims of betrayals and
back-stabbing that the CIA and other governmental agencies have been
dealing out like drunken blackjack dealers at Circus Circus for the past
40 years.  The only problem is that people like Oliver Stone, Chris
Carter, and Christopher Hitchens have basically ripped apart all the
really good conspiracy theories already.
What we really need is a satire of those good conspiracies from the
1960s.  With that in mind, Company Man, a brazen new comedy by Douglas
McGrath and Peter Askin, supplies that swift kick in the confidential
files of the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and even the Boy Scouts.  It's a
quick-witted, grammatically correct, and often hilarious satire aimed
dead center at the conspiracy nutcases and their shining theories.
Meet Allen Quimp (Douglas McGrath), a high school grammar
teacher/international spy who knows the difference between 'who' and
'whom' and its correct usage in a sentence.  During a congressional
hearing regarding the CIA's involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion in
the 1960s, Quimp recalls the CIA's attempts in overthrowing Fidel Castro
by himself and a variety of characters working for the CIA.
Quimp's story begins when he lies to his nagging, socialite wife Daisy
(Sigourney Weaver) about a phoney position at the CIA as an
international spy so she'll leave him alone to write his masterpiece,
The Grammar Crisis in the English Speaking World.  Word of Quimp's
secret life quickly spreads via Daisy's gossip, and soon he's famous in
the underground.  Befuddled and bewildered, Quimp accidentally helps a
Russian ballet dancer (Ryan Phillippe) defect to the U.S., whereupon the
CIA really recruits Quimp into their ranks, dumping him into Cuba to
subdue the Communist uprising led by Fidel Castro (Anthony LaPaglia). 
Working with a lunatic bunch of CIA cohorts, Quimp attempts to overthrow
Castro himself and stop the revolution.
I just don't understand how the Bay of Pigs invasion could have been
re-tooled as the basis for a comedy vehicle and be successful.
Company Man is funny.  Damn funny.  The film draws inspiration from the
great Woody Allen comedies of the sixties and seventies - Sleeper,
Bananas, What's Up Tiger Lily -- and watching it, I was reminded of
another wonderfully absurd spy movie, The In-Laws.
McGrath, looking like a cross between Kevin Spacey and Matthew
Broderick, does an amazing job in all departments of co-writing,
co-directing, and acting.  Using actual conspiracy theories of how the
CIA tried to overthrow Castro, McGrath and Peter Askin have written a
deft and clever script.  Combined with an amazing ensemble cast of Woody
Allen, Anthony LaPaglia, Ryan Phillippe, Denis Leary, Sigourney Weaver,
John Turturro, Alan Cumming, and Jeffery Jones, the film burns bright in
its spare 90 minutes.
Company Man is clever, quick, over-the-top, and filled with memorable
comedic moments.  It's only a shame that most American audiences will
probably miss the boat on this one small gem.
Director: Douglas McGrath, Peter Askin
Producer: John Penotti
Writer: Douglas McGrath, Peter Askin
Starring: Douglas McGrath, Woody Allen, Anthony LaPaglia, Ryan
Phillippe, Denis Leary, Sigourney Weaver, John Turturro, Alan Cumming,
Jeffery Jones

Title
Review for Serendipity (2001)
I must admit I'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new
romantic comedy Serendipity, because that also defines how I met my
current girlfriend.  The magic and mystery of our fated encounter is
also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very
romantic Serendipity.  I am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre,
but something drew me to this film.  Maybe it was the casting of the
underrated Jeremy Piven in a supporting role, and the hilarious Eugene
Levy.  Maybe it was my hope that John Cusack would get the redemption he
justly deserves after such crap as High Fidelity, Con Air, and Pushing
Tin.  But maybe it was because I feel as giddy as a school kid right now
with this whole romantic thing currently in my life.
The story of Serendipity is simple.  Two people, John Trager (John
Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale, looking ever so hot), have a
chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with Buck Henry smack dab in
the middle.  Charmed beyond repair, these two knuckleheads grab a sundae
together at a café called Serendipity, talk about that irresponsible
thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down, and spend a few
hours at the local ice skating rink.  But with each of them already
involved with other parties, Sara has John write his name and number on
a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of Love in the
Time of Cholera.  Sara declares that if this "thing" -- let's just call
it love -- is destined to happen, fate will bring them together in the
future.
Years later and on opposite coasts of America, John and Sara -- both
engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates --
decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts.  What happens then
is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates -
involving such items as mistaken identity, a Graduate homage, John
Corbett as a freaky New Age musician, and Eugene Levy as an irate and
crazed salesman -- to find out if that "thing" was right after all.
Fortunately, first-time screenwriter Marc Klein has sketched strong,
well-rounded, characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative. 
Coupled with deft directing by Michael Chelsom (director of the very
unfunny Town and Country and the very funny Funny Bones) and the use of
time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film
comes off with genuine believability and sincerity.  Both Piven and
Molly Shannon make nice sidekick characters
On the flipside, films such as You've Got Mail, Made in Heaven, and even
High Fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at
hand.  But it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind
in the romantic wake after John and Sara find happiness this is the most
unsettling part of the picture.
Director: Peter Chelsom
Producer: Peter Abrams, Simon Fields, Robert L. Levy
Writer: Marc Klein
Starring: Kate Beckinsale, John Cusack, Jeremy Piven, Molly Shannon,
Eugene Levy, John Corbett, Bridget Moynahan

Review for Crew, The (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://a.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/1044787cd5ee75be8825694600045c29?OpenDocument
Whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two
blockbuster films, the end result is always a mess of a script, acting,
directing, and generally a waste of time for any audience with an
average IQ above 40.  The latest movie morass from Hollywood, The Crew,
appeared equally destined to fail, a strange combination of Grumpy Old
Men and GoodFellas tossed together with the likes of Richard Dreyfuss
and Burt Reynolds helming the ship.  The scary thing is that it's
actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale
month.
The Crew works for several reasons.  The clever script is reminiscent of
an old Billy Wilder movie, following four "past their prime" wiseguys
from Jersey who now live in the Raj Mahal Apartment House in Miami
Beach.  The wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their "golden
paradise" by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach
bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property.  The four mobsters,
Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt
Reynolds), Mike "The Brick" Donatelli (Dan Hedaya), and Tony "Mouth"
Donato (Seymour Cassel) decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead
body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and
keep their home.  This "simple plan" suddenly goes screwy, of course,
and the boys become involved with a stripper named Ferris (Jennifer
Tilly) who wants her stepmother killed, a paranoid Latin drug lord who's
convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him, and a rat with its tail
on fire.
The Crew  works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble
cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men.  Instead of
concentrating on Bobby's search for his daughter, the film gives equal
screen time to all four wiseguys, balancing the production.  The acting
talents of such screen veterans as Dan Hedaya, Seymour Cassel, and the
great, great Burt Reynolds are brought out by each character's
uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle.  A strong supporting
cast including Jeremy Piven as a philandering boyfriend/cop/partner and
Miguel Sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs.
The film was produced by Barry Sonnenfeld and carries a hint Get Shorty
with its energetic camera work by Michael Dinner, Emmy Award-winning
director of The Wonder Years.  The quick script written by Barry Fanaro,
screenwriter of Kingpin, is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and
wit.
The Crew is a prime example of how simple and dry-witted a comedy can
get these days.  The great thing is that this comedy does not need to be
punctuated by bodily fluids, phallus symbols in the head, or
grandmothers giving head in a spa.  In the steady flow of "extreme"
comedy these days flowing from Hollywood like a broken water main, it's
the elder statesmen like Dreyfuss, Reynolds, and Hedaya that can carry a
comic arc with only a few weapons of choice - a decent script and good
acting.
Director: Michael Dinner
Producer: Barry Sonnenfeld, Barry Josephson
Writer: Barry Fanaro
Starring: Burt Reynolds, Richard Dreyfuss, Dan Hadaya, Carrie-Anne Moss,
Seymour Cassel, Jeremy Piven, Miguel Sandoval

Review for Black and White (1999)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/da54d7633c37df3e882568b400043295?OpenDocument
A very unique and brutal subculture exists in America these days.  It's
a strange juxtaposition of harsh street life and uber-materialistic
greed tempered with a sense of justifiability from a code of unwritten
ethics.  The world is that of the gangsta rappers, the ghetto boys, and
the thug-life advocators that dominate the world of hip-hop and rap
music.  Black and White, the latest film by James Toback, explores this
subculture that grows stronger with every new generation it affects.
The hardest thing about an outsider trying to infiltrate a subculture
and explain it to the masses is that the truth is often lost in the
translation.  Toback throws together a huge canvas of characters and
actors in attempt to create a clear picture of why white kids are
motivated to impersonate black rappers' lifestyles and why rich whit
guys treat black rappers like Arnold and Willis from Diff'rent Strokes.
Everybody is in this film.  Brooke Shields and Robert Downey Jr. play
documentarians trying to capture the essence behind the influence of the
hip-hop movement on Generation Y kids.  Ben Stiller is a cop trying to
take down one of the hip-hop artists portrayed in the film by Power (of
the rap group Wu-Tang Clan).  A crop of newer faces  Jared Leto, Gaby
Hoffman, Scott Caan, William Lee Scott  appear throughout in the film
in various supporting roles.  But the strangest casting for the film, I
must admit, is Mike Tyson.  The scary thing is that he pulls off a
decent job.  Which is a selling point of the movie: Overall, the film is
filled with actors stretching their acting chops and trying to work
against type and prove they're above their usual mediocre material.
Toback directs the actors in the film to improv their way through a
roughly written script and, in turn, try to make some sense of the
strange plot twists.  Some of the scenes work well, especially one where
Robert Downey Jr. hits on Mike Tyson, but some of the scenes have that
`movie of the week' feeling.  The main fault with the film is that it
fails to make any real statement about its subject matter or explain
much about the actions of the characters.  Was Toback's intent to
explore the hip-hop culture or simply to exploit it like the rich, white
guys in the film?  Then again, that's how he cast himself in the movie.
And you know, I guess that's what he really is.

Review for What Planet Are You From? (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at

It's always a shame to see great comedic minds fall so far from the
mark.  Garry Shandling is a funny man.  Just check out any episode of
"The Larry Sanders Show."  He has a wonderfully dry wit and is downright
hilarious without drawing overt attention to himself.  I just want to
know what the hell happened to What Planet are You From?
Simple story line:  Alien must come to Earth and impregnate female human
being to establish future dominance of his planet's race.  Comedic
premise:  Alien must learn how to communicate to female human beings.
Comedy rolls on:  Alien encounters and makes ass of himself to female
human beings.  Comedy continues:  Alien tracked by rogue FAA agent.
Comedy continues even more:  Alien meets female human and falls in
love.  Cue drama.  That's about it.
Let's examine the facts.  You have Mike Nichols, the Oscar-winning
director of The Graduate, Catch-22, and the underrated Primary Colors,
steering this oil tanker of a film. A great supporting cast of Annette
Bening, John Goodman, Greg Kinnear, and Ben Kingsley all try to make
something out of nothing of a script.  Garry Shandling has co-written
himself into a very dark corner of unfunny comedy.  All of which means,
I'm a bit lost.
Some funny moments can be found, buried in the film, but the jokes end
up falling flat after the first fifteen minutes.  The romantic
situations that could have been executed become contrived and
ridiculous.  This would have made a great Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider
vehicle.  (Though even I must admit, Garry Shandling's vibrating penis
deserves a least one bonus star.)  And kudos to the likes of Bening,
Goodman, Kinnear, and Kingsley for pouring some great acting into the
most pointless of scripts.

Review for Anna and the King (1999)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/d7665b014d292aff8825684b000a1cf2?OpenDocument
My assumption is that every generation needs their own version of the
film The King and I.  My grandparents had Rex Harrison, my parents had
Yul Brynner, and now my generation has Chow Yun-Fat. Hold the phone
right there, mister.  Chow Yun-Fat... isn't he that the guy from those
crazy, violent, Hong Kong action movies by John Woo?  Fear not, kind
reader, for Chow Yun-Fat commands the role made famous for all these
years and gives both Harrison and Brynner a run for their money.
When I watch Chow Yun-Fat, one person comes to mind: Steve McQueen.
Watching Chow move across the screen and establish his presence strongly
echoes the attitude and the acting style of McQueen.  Upon the viewer's
first impression of the king of Siam, Chow is the complete image of
royalty in Eastern Asia.  His curt, rigid mannerisms and omnipotent
status as king are delivered strongly with simple, direct looks.  This
attitude clearly draws the line between the customs of the East and
West.  As the film progresses, I watched Chow evolve from this distant,
commanding presence to an emotional, tangible creature that, with an
honest glance, can covey passionate love for his family and for his
country.
The chemistry between the King and Anna is made concrete by Jodie
Foster's amazing acting abilities.  She encompasses fully the role of a
Victorian lady born and bred in England.  Her staunch avocation towards
defending her actions and securing proper respect from the King is
fueled by the directness of Foster's character.  Foster projects a
silent understanding of the King's actions towards his family and
strives to communicate with him on an equal level.  She brings to the
role a hidden sorrow that is shared by the King, and this sorrow lets
them draw closer to one another.  Her reservations towards temptation
are laid bare and Chow supplements the situations with his own
reservations towards love for another person.
The main issue with films that deal with an epic theme -- one that
requires grandiose set constructions, hundreds upon thousands of extras,
an amazing selection of costumes and jewelry, and exotic locations -- is
that it can all fail with the wrong director behind the camera.  With
all the amazing acting achieved by Chow Yun-Fat and Jodie Foster and
complex character development they pull off so well in the film, Anna
and the King has the wrong director for the job.  This is where my main
criticism for the film lies.
Andy Tennant, from such hits as Fools Rush In, that crazy Salma Hayek
comedy, and Ever After, must have gotten his directing credentials out
of a Crackerjack box.  The emotional impact of many intimate scenes
between Chow and Foster were lacking one thing: Intimacy.  Tennant never
draws close to the character's faces and I felt distant and removed from
most of the scenes.  The acting of Chow and Foster held strong
conviction for me, but the inclusion of these images would have left a
greater impression.  Tennant also lets the actors move within the scene
without letting the camera move with them, but this only instills
greater remoteness towards the audience.
Another main fault is the film's script.  I'm not to sure that this
subject matter should have been handed over to two guys, Steve Meerson
and Peter Krikes, whose last film was Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.  I
could just see the first treatments of the film: `Kirk to Spock, put the
phasers on stun because the King of Siam needs our help to rid his
country of imperialist forces uniting against him in a deadly trade
war'.  `Dammnit Jim, I'm a doctor not a political advisor!'
This `political struggle' of Chow's King Mongkut between British
imperialism and the internal power struggles of his kingdom adds only a
distraction to the film's main focus of the unrequited love people can
hold for one another.  When it attempts to give partial validation to
the love of the King and Anna by their uniting to overcome this `power
struggle,' the film becomes trite and reaches resolution without fanfare
or emotional involvement from the audience.
Overall, the film is commendable for the acting of Chow and Foster and
the impressive set and costume designs of the film.  Anna and the King
should also provide Chow Yun-Fat the ability to finally move into a
stronger category of American actors and achieve the notoriety he has
held for so long in the East.  Would that it did more for the audience.

Title
Review for Company Man (2000)
I have to admit something before I write this review.  I am a die-hard
conspiracy nut who loves the outrageous claims of betrayals and
back-stabbing that the CIA and other governmental agencies have been
dealing out like drunken blackjack dealers at Circus Circus for the past
40 years.  The only problem is that people like Oliver Stone, Chris
Carter, and Christopher Hitchens have basically ripped apart all the
really good conspiracy theories already.
What we really need is a satire of those good conspiracies from the
1960s.  With that in mind, Company Man, a brazen new comedy by Douglas
McGrath and Peter Askin, supplies that swift kick in the confidential
files of the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and even the Boy Scouts.  It's a
quick-witted, grammatically correct, and often hilarious satire aimed
dead center at the conspiracy nutcases and their shining theories.
Meet Allen Quimp (Douglas McGrath), a high school grammar
teacher/international spy who knows the difference between 'who' and
'whom' and its correct usage in a sentence.  During a congressional
hearing regarding the CIA's involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion in
the 1960s, Quimp recalls the CIA's attempts in overthrowing Fidel Castro
by himself and a variety of characters working for the CIA.
Quimp's story begins when he lies to his nagging, socialite wife Daisy
(Sigourney Weaver) about a phoney position at the CIA as an
international spy so she'll leave him alone to write his masterpiece,
The Grammar Crisis in the English Speaking World.  Word of Quimp's
secret life quickly spreads via Daisy's gossip, and soon he's famous in
the underground.  Befuddled and bewildered, Quimp accidentally helps a
Russian ballet dancer (Ryan Phillippe) defect to the U.S., whereupon the
CIA really recruits Quimp into their ranks, dumping him into Cuba to
subdue the Communist uprising led by Fidel Castro (Anthony LaPaglia). 
Working with a lunatic bunch of CIA cohorts, Quimp attempts to overthrow
Castro himself and stop the revolution.
I just don't understand how the Bay of Pigs invasion could have been
re-tooled as the basis for a comedy vehicle and be successful.
Company Man is funny.  Damn funny.  The film draws inspiration from the
great Woody Allen comedies of the sixties and seventies - Sleeper,
Bananas, What's Up Tiger Lily -- and watching it, I was reminded of
another wonderfully absurd spy movie, The In-Laws.
McGrath, looking like a cross between Kevin Spacey and Matthew
Broderick, does an amazing job in all departments of co-writing,
co-directing, and acting.  Using actual conspiracy theories of how the
CIA tried to overthrow Castro, McGrath and Peter Askin have written a
deft and clever script.  Combined with an amazing ensemble cast of Woody
Allen, Anthony LaPaglia, Ryan Phillippe, Denis Leary, Sigourney Weaver,
John Turturro, Alan Cumming, and Jeffery Jones, the film burns bright in
its spare 90 minutes.
Company Man is clever, quick, over-the-top, and filled with memorable
comedic moments.  It's only a shame that most American audiences will
probably miss the boat on this one small gem.
Director: Douglas McGrath, Peter Askin
Producer: John Penotti
Writer: Douglas McGrath, Peter Askin
Starring: Douglas McGrath, Woody Allen, Anthony LaPaglia, Ryan
Phillippe, Denis Leary, Sigourney Weaver, John Turturro, Alan Cumming,

Review for Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The (1999)
[filmcritic.com presents a review from guest writer Max Messier.  You
can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/8b9faf48e37b4f2088256840000d4fea?OpenDocument
THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC
Milla J., stick to the singing career.
Luc Besson, imaginative mind behind such notable works of art such as
The Professional, La Femme Nikita, and The Big Blue, has created such a
memorable mess of things with his newest release, The Messenger.  A car
crash of a movie headed straight for the Days of Heaven territory.
Joan of Arc, one of the most pinnacle figures of French history, has
been reduced to a crazy chick with a God complex unseen since Alec
Baldwin in Malice.  Luc, put down the Braveheart script and try to write
something interested and not convoluted like bad matinee popcorn that
sticks in a person's teeth. Also, the last thing I need in a movie is
Faye Dunaway doing her Mommie Dearest impression for the 56th time.
I wanted to understand the complexity of Joan of Arc's character - her
trepidation in confirming her personal beliefs, her fears of battle and
violence, her faith in God and country, her ability to stay so DAMN
ravishing during battle - I really do.  I DO!  But I just can't.  I just
didn't want to after the first fifteen minutes. Besson's inability of
winding together a cohesive plot structure and creating emotional
connection to the main characters is the main cause for the downfall of
the film.  When Joan is faced with the dilemmas of conviction and
execution of her leadership role, I am wondering what time I can get
home to watch the hockey highlights.
On the positive side, the cinematography is amazing, the set and costume
designs are impressive beyond words, and the battle scenes are notable
but unfocused.  One bright star in the cloudy sky is Tcheky Karyo, star
of La Femme Nikita and GoldenEye, who provides concrete battle ideals
that mesh together with Joan's abstract leadership ideals.  At least
Besson can rescue him from such films as Wing Commander.
Where are you Jean Reno, when we need you the most?

Title
Review for Exit Wounds (2001)
To watch a Steven Seagal film, one must fully suspend all disbelief. 
And to fully enjoy the audacity of Seagal, one must ignore all of the
consequences associated with the following: Starting fistfights with
large men in flashy nightclubs, destroying everything in sight along the
way.  Surviving every semi-automatic gun battle and car crash without a
scratch.  Purchasing Italian racing cars with bundles of $100 bills
stuffed in a gym bag.  Actually being able to cash out stock options
from a dot-com and then creating a private surveillance unit devoted to
uncovering a ring of corrupt Detroit cops involved in smuggling heroin
inside of sweatshop-produced t-shirts.  OK... maybe that corrupt cops
thing is a bit hard to swallow.
I remember a time when I used to enjoy Seagal.  Such films as Above the
Law, Hard to Kill, Marked for Death, Under Siege, and Out for Justice
are all solid action films from the '90s.  Under Siege is even kind of
good.  But lately, films like Under Siege 2, Fire Down Below, and The
Patriot have shown the age of the Italian stallion of Aikido.
Now, Exit Wounds stands as Seagal's biggest failure, a pitiful reminder
of the death of the American action film.  By overextending the
violence, the ludicrousness, and the sheer improbability of everything,
Exit Wounds plays out like a circus of the damned with Tom Arnold
working the Tilt-A-Whirl.  (Speaking of Tom Arnold, it's always a bad
sign when his thespian attempts at comedy are the most memorable parts
of a film.)
Exit Wounds is bad -- really, really bad.  Should you care about the
plot, the mighty Steven plays Orin Boyd, a burned out cop without his
trademark pony-nub who gets reassigned to a tough Detroit precinct after
saving the Vice-President's life during a Michigan militia terrorist
act.  Apparently, this particular precinct is filled with police
officers who use the gym way too much, use stun guns in strange naked
homoerotic bonding moments, and routinely steal heroin from police labs
to fund those out-of-state fishing trips so popular among Detroit city
cops.  Then there's DMX, the hardcore rapper-turned-actor who does a
better job in his music videos than in this role as a stereotypical drug
dealer/club owner/martial arts master/dot-com entrepreneur.  Seagal and
DMX team up to stop the corrupt cop ring, run by Michael Jai White
(Spawn).
The gratuitous violence of Exit Wounds would have made Peckinpah cringe
and reach for the stop button on the remote.  In earlier Seagal films,
you got brief moments of violence that made the films memorable and not
so gory.  Exit Wounds overflows with carnage -- people being bloodied by
fists wrapped in chains, body parts being impaled on exposed bolts and
pipes, people being crushed by oncoming cars and buses.  And every
single car involved in a chase sequence erupts in flames, of course.
The biggest shame of the film is the misuse of Seagal.  Instead of
having Seagal demonstrate the prowess and speed of a 7th Dan of Aikido,
shown off so well in his earlier films, he ends up being nothing more
than a patsy, used to connect the dots of all the inane plot points in
what stands as a truly rotten film.
Director: Andrzej Bartkowiak
Producer: Joel Silver, Dan Cracchiolo
Writer: Ed Horowitz, Richard D'Ovidio
Starring: Steven Seagal, DMX, Tom Arnold, Isaiah Washington, Bill Duke,
Michael Jai White

Title
Review for Double Take (2001)
New year, new pile of movies straight from the Hollywood dumping ground
of badly test-screened, obscure, unfunny, and badly acted garbage. 
Double Take is the first pony out of the gate.  I don't know which is
the worst part of the film: Eddie Griffin's overacting, Orlando Jones'
non-acting, or the ugly mutt that passes as Griffin's sidekick.
Orlando Jones does a better job in those 7-Up commercials than in the
role of Darryl Chase, an uptight investment banker set up by a
combination of the CIA, the FBI, a Mexican drug cartel, the Federales,
and an emu farmer as part of a double murder/embezzlement scheme. 
Running from the law, Chase changes clothes and identity with Freddy
Tiffany, a two-bit hustler named played by Eddie Griffin he encounters
on the street.  Together, the pair travel across the country to Mexico,
where a certain CIA agent holds the key to Chase's freedom.  And of
course, during the journey, Darryl Chase rediscovers his roots as a
black man while Freddy Tiffany shucks and jives his way through every
situation like he's the bastard son of Eddie Murphy and Jerry Lewis.
After numerous car chases, way too many plot "twists," the
aforementioned annoying dog, the bad acting of Vivica A. Fox, and too
many jokes about a glass eye, the movie becomes a science project left
in the school refrigerator to rot over the summer.  Orlando Jones, a
genuinely talented actor/writer, seems out of place here, annoyed by the
film and especially by his costar's lack of acting ability.  Griffin has
the energy of Tito Puente, the humor of Richard Pryor, and the acting
ability of former Seattle Seahawks linebacker Brian Bosworth.  Jones
deserves better material and collaborators.
It's a shame that Double Take is as bad as it is, because this cinematic
travesty was written and directed by George Gallo, the screenwriter of
one of the funniest films of the 1980's, Midnight Run (the plot of which
bears a striking similarity to this film).  Here are a few bonus facts
to consider if you haven't bought my evaluation: The film is based on an
obscure 1950's English film starring Rod Steiger called Across the
Bridge.  It took more than a decade to get the green light for
production.  It describes itself as a cross between "film noir, a
thriller, and a comedy."

Title
Review for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001)
It's time to say "goodbye," according to Kevin Smith, to his token
recurring characters -- the C3PO and R2-D2 of the local Quick Stop --
Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith).  Since their inception
as two stoner losers hanging out in front of the local Quick Stop
"smokin' blunts and kickin' asses" in Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob have
received ever expanding roles in Smith's later features -- Mallrats,
Chasing Amy, and Dogma.  But when these two guys showed up in a cameo in
Scream 3, that was the moment when they "jumped the shark" (AKA lost
their unique appeal and devolved into would-be Happy Meal figurines).  I
wouldn't be surprised if two 10-foot tall character replicants greeted
all guests at Miramax's HQ.
If you looking for a plot in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, don't
bother.  Smith uses the safe convention of repetition by including
certain key locations of his first three films and all of their main
characters -- minus Dogma.  By doing this, Smith creates a familiar
universe for Jay and Silent Bob to venture through and trick the
audience into remembering their old favorites and ignore the throwaway
script.
The story goes something like this.  Due to the success of a comic book
series called Bluntman and Chronic, which used Jay and Silent Bob for
character inspiration, the boys are living life well on royalty checks
and hanging out at the same local Quick Stop from Clerks.  Upon hearing
that Bluntman and Chronic has been sold to Miramax and the boys have
received no compensation, they head to Hollywood to stop the
production.  Along the way, four hot chicks pick them up -- girls
straight off the covers of Maxim and Stuff, actually jewel thieves in
need of two patsies for their next job.  Jay and Silent Bob are framed
for the robbery of an orangutan and are then hunted by Federal Wildlife
Marshal Wilenholly (Will Ferrell) as they travel the back roads to
Hollywood to clear their names.
At first Strike Back is pleasant enough thanks to all the nostalgia. 
But the happiness wears off quickly as it becomes all too apparent that
Smith has fallen for the same grab bag of pop culture that teen comedy
producers eat with a spoon.  Scooby Doo, Charlie's Angels, and numerous
references to the Star Wars films - including a blatant cameo by Mark
Hamill and, well, the title -- all make lame appearances.  Endless
tongue-in-cheek references to Miramax's totalitarian control of
"independent" cinema come off as empty and contrived, as if Miramax
suits thought they could mock themselves while raking in the cash.  (It
didn't work for Josie and the Pussycats either, fellas.)
Tons of people (literally, at least 4,000 pounds worth of celebrities)
show up in this film -- including John Stewart, Matt Damon, James Van
Der Beek, Joey Lauren Adams, Judd Nelson, Gus Van Sant, Shannen Doherty,
Wes Craven, Jason Biggs, Ali Larter, George Carlin, and Chris Rock to
name but a few.  Ironically, they are playing themselves in a film that
unilaterally mocks them.  The self-loathing impresses, and if that was
Smith's intention for the film, then it's admirable.
Alas, any such sentiment is drowned in a sea of dick jokes, fart jokes,
and references to the 1980s.
Director: Kevin Smith
Producer: Scott Mosier, Laura Greenlee
Writer: Kevin Smith
Starring: Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, Shannon
Elizabeth, George Carlin, Jason Biggs, Will Ferrell, Ali Larter, Chris

Title
Review for Hit and Runway (1999)
Attention all screenwriters!  I have discovered the perfect masturbation
material for all you wannabe Joe Eszterhases and Michael Crichtons in
the world: Write a script about two guys writing a script.  Make sure
each of the characters initially will not like each other based upon
general stereotypical foundations - such as a black man and a guy from
the South, or an Italian guy and a gay Jew.  Toss in those standard and
predictable dramatic and comedic elements, include a bookworm girl with
glasses for the romantic interest, and always remember, keep it as light
as non-fat whipped cream.
Just from the press book, Hit and Runway had the smell of a misguided
idea.  A gay, Jewish man and a straight, masculine Italian guy join pen
and prose together to write the perfect movie script for action
superstar Jagger Stevens.  The Italian guy is homophobic and doesn't
understand the meaning of irony.  The Jewish guy is Woody Allen's lost
twin brother who berates everything and everyone around him with "witty"
Allen-esque dialogue.  It's a quirky romantic comedy about a straight
man and a gay man coming to terms with each other's personal identities
and dreams and learning to love, and yadda yadda yadda...
All I can ask is, who the hell would name their kid Jagger Stevens?
Alex (Michael Parducci), the hulking Italian knucklehead, has big dreams
of writing a hit Hollywood movie and leaving behind his family café and
a life of washing dishes.  Elliot (Peter Jacobson) is a struggling gay
playwright (aren't all playwrights struggling?) in love with a waiter
(Kerr Smith) who works at Alex's café.  When Alex pitches a film about a
New York cop working undercover as a fashion model starring Jagger
Stevens (Hoyt Richards) to a family relative, he gets the opportunity to
write his blockbuster script.  Without any knowledge of the proper prose
for action stars, he enlists the help of Elliot in exchange for setting
up a date with the waiter.  And then the trouble starts.
After this initial introduction, the movie ends up falling flat on its
keyboard.  The quirkiness becomes trivial through the blatant
stereotyping of each character and his motivation.  The acting is boring
and plods along to its own pathetic beat.  The endless talks of striving
for your dreams and never giving into your own self-doubts play out like
an infomercial for a hair-replacement product.  The script is stale, the
acting is sub-par and misguided, and the cinematography is on par with a
Turkish sitcom.
Watching the film, it's obvious that someone tried to make something
decent out of this mess.  Hit and Runway needed a second or third
opinion in its final execution instead of letting its maker hold those
strings.  By the end, I felt cheated and let down by the abrupt tone of
the finale.  It's as if the main characters sold themselves on the
cheap.  Instead of fighting for their integrity, they relinquish their
ideals for the cheap, wind-up toys of fame and recognition.

Review for Love's Labour's Lost (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/f76feb254c17f08d882568fe00098e80?OpenDocument
Film musicals are a tough sell these days.  It's either the annual
Disney animation vehicle or it's Edward Norton dancing to swing music.
I could probably count the last five years worth of decent musicals on
my left hand.  The juxtaposition of dialogue with song and dance always
seems to remind me of the tragedies of my high school drama days.  Those
damn tights.  The bad pancake makeup.
Kenneth Branagh's latest Shakespearean opus, Love's Labour's Lost, falls
into the category of an ingenious experiment gone horrible wrong.  Like
a bartender with one too many vodka-tonics on his breath, Branagh mixes
one of Shakespeare's lesser-known comedies with the music of Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin and places everything in 1939 France.  Think the Rat
Pack in some bad 1960s film.
Tell me if this doesn't seem a bit strange to you:  The King of Navarre
and his three best friends decide to put down their swords and seclude
themselves from the world in order to study philosophy and fast from
food and comfort for three years.  No women are allowed in the court,
and all of them can do great Fred Astaire impressions.  Ummm... sounds a
bit kooky to me.  The arrival of the Princess of France and her three
maidens sends the boys into a crazed frenzy.  Each of the guys decides
to lay down his oath of seclusion and romantically pursue one special
maiden of his choice.  War erupts and all four boys must leave their
newfound loves to fight for France's freedom.  Toss in a couple of
supporting characters full of enough shtick to shake a stick at (my lame
attempt at iambic pentameter), comical deception, and bake at 300
degrees for thirty minutes or until the cheesy top turns a golden brown.
The scariest thing about this film is the decision to cast Alicia
Silverstone as the lead role of the Princess of France.  Has Branagh
been doing drugs to suppress the memory of his role in last year's
cinematic opus Wild Wild West?  When Silverstone appears in the film and
starts spouting Shakespearean dialogue, all I could see was her
character Cher from Clueless performing a really, really bad
Shakespearean oral report for her English final.  It's a bit jarring at
first to watch the actors move from the complicated dialogue of the play
to the memorable songs of Gershwin, Porter, and Berlin: Sinatra and Dino
are probably calling Branagh the `biggest palooka from Endsville' from
the great beyond right now.  Branagh also pulls the same mistake as
Woody Allen did in his attempt at a musical by hiring actors that
could't even sing and dance for change on the street.
It's also a damn shame that this film doesn't work on the whole.
Branagh's directing is crisp and original.  The inclusion of
newsreel-style footage about the King's exploits makes for smart scene
changes.  The entire cast, with the strong exception of the Batgirl,
runs the difficult dialogue with great ease.  The costumes, makeup, and
set design are amazing.
The most problematic thing about the film is that it would have been a
success if only Branagh had stuck to the actual text of the play without
the distractions of the music.
One thing's for sure... Branagh ain't no song and dance man.

Title
Review for Cats & Dogs (2001)
I have officially reached my quota for the year of talking animal
movies.  Dr. Dolittle 2 pushed me to the edge, and the animatronic
animal flick Cats & Dogs has pushed right over it, into a giddy oblivion
where I now firmly believe purple dinosaurs can communicate with humans
through song and dance.
Cats & Dogs is ridiculous and harmless, a Mission: Impossible for the
animal world.  For years, a secret high-tech espionage war has been
waged between the feline and canine races, right under the noses of
ignorant humans.  The spark of this high-tech war came about as the
result of the dog race overthrowing the then-dominating cat race during
ancient Egyptian times (they even ruled the human race).  Man's best
friend re-established the humans as the dominant race and has protected
that balance for years.  And a breakthrough for dogs is approaching, as
one human, Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum), is on the verge of
discovering an allergy vaccine which will enable all humans and dogs to
co-exist in peace.  The only problem is that the diabolic Mr. Tinkle
(voiced by Sean Hayes), a furry white Persian with the attitude of
Richard Grant's character from Hudson Hawk, and his small army of pesky
felines have "cat-knapped" the family dog Buddy, who has been guarding
the Professor and his family from the tuna-breathed fiends.  The
bodyguard job then falls on the shoulders of a Beagle pup named Lou
(voiced by Toby Maguire) -- who is mistaken as a secret agent dog by an
Anatolian Shepard named Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin).
Butch and his crew, which includes an Old English sheep dog named Sam
(voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) and a Chinese Crested named Peek
(voiced by Joe Pantoliano), train young Lou in self-defense and the best
ways to put a cat down for good.  Along the way, Lou and the crew face
crazed Siamese ninja cats, a Russian Blue who throws enough knives to
make Oddjob proud, and the tyrannical Mr. Tinkles, who declares in
moments of comedic brilliance that, "Evil does not wear a bonnet!"
It sounds ugly but hey, it's a kids movie and that's the audience that
will love it.  The animal training/acting is above par.  The computer
graphics are decent, but the animatronic talking dogs and cats resemble
the talking dolls on the boat ride at Disneyland's "It's A Small
World."  My biggest complaint with Cats and Dogs is that once again,
cats are demonized into evil incarnations that would have Jim Jones
shaking in his boots.  "Who Will You Root For?" the posters ask us?  The
film leaves you no choice at all.  [filmcritic.com is cat people. -Ed.]
The downfall of Cats & Dogs comes when the human characters start
dominating the film.  The cornball Hallmark-esque moments of family
bonding and issues of neglected children distract you from the sharp
comedy between Mr. Tinkle and his main henchman Calico (voiced by the
brilliant John Lovitz) as they discuss their vain attempt to take over
the world through "World Domination Pamphlets."
And I'd also like to know how the hell the dogs are able to afford to
build rocket ships and radar stations to keep this war going.

Title
Review for Hearts in Atlantis (2001)
The entire time I spent watching the latest Stephen King big-screen
adaptation Hearts in Atlantis, I had this nagging feeling in the back of
my mind that something was missing.  All the key elements of a
potentially great film were present -- authentic-looking 1960s Americana
scenery, great acting by Anthony Hopkins and newcomer Anton Yelchin
(Delivering Milo), an intriguing story line, and strong directing by
Scott Hicks.  And then, at the end of the film, it just hit me like a
sap across the back of the neck. 
One common recurring narrative in many of King's better-known
novel-to-screen adaptations -- such as Stand by Me, The Green Mile, and
The Shawshank Redemption -- incorporates an older gentleman recalling
his youth or a life-changing incident of his life. Hearts in Atlantis
follows this to a tee.  After learning of a childhood friend's death, a
middle-aged photographer Robert Garfield (David Morse) ventures back to
his hometown for the funeral.  Upon arrival, Robert recalls memories of
youth and of one innocent, fateful summer when a mysterious man named
Ted Brautigan (Hopkins) entered his life and changed it forever.
At the beginning of summer, old Teddy rents the studio apartment on the
upper floor of his childhood home.  During his stay, Teddy displays the
usual, weird behavioral traits of all King characters.  He's a strange
gent who carries his belongings around in brown paper bags; says the
kookiest things about young love, life as a kid, and the pains of
growing old; appears as a mythical figure in times of crisis; and
carries the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Lonely little boy
Bobby Garfield (Yelchin) takes a liking to Teddy because his mother
(Hope Davis) is a workaholic who spends more money on dresses than
birthday presents and his father is dead.  During the summer, Bobby
falls in love and shares his first kiss with the neighborhood girl,
Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem), endures the trials of defending his honor
from the neighborhood bullies, pines for a bicycle in the local
convenience store, and discovers Teddy's mysterious gift of seeing
beyond the world.  Bobby is then entrusted with informing and somehow
protecting Teddy from the Low Men, dangerous ruthless faceless
characters who drive fancy cars and cast long shadows, who are hunting
for Teddy because of his unique "gift."
All of these circumstances would have made the film a success except for
one damning thing.  Everything -- from the unrequited love of two
childhood sweethearts to the emotional abuse of a lonely boy -- feels so
recognizable and indistinguishable from all of the previous works that
deal with these similar themes.  I kept catching myself remembering
parts from Stand By Me and even The Goonies.  It's a shame, because the
film looks great from a technical standpoint and both Hopkins and
Yelchin pull off great performances.  In the end, though, the film feels
cheap and used up -- like watching a two-hour Hallmark special.  You
feel guilty for even liking the good parts.
Even the message of Hearts in Atlantis becomes lost in the emotional
manipulation by both the characters and story.  Instead of giving the
audience the ability to develop its own emotional ties to the film's
narrative and personalities, the script dictates pre-defined moments of
trepidation, intrigue, anguish, sadness, loneliness, and frustration by
the obvious flow of the characters' dialogue and the film's plot
points.  One key example is when Hopkins details the story of a
once-great football player winning one last game for the home team.  So
much deliberation is given to this scenario that we all but expect the
main character of the story to have to overcome a challenging obstacle
in his own life.  It's a desperate manipulation, and it has a totally
opposite effect: In the end, you can care less what happens to Teddy or
his little friend.

Title
Review for Don't Say a Word (2001)
Surrounded by hype, high hopes, and the promise of an over-the-top
performance by Clueless's Brittany Murphy, Don't Say a Word looked full
of promise.  Hell, when I hear that "I'll never tell" whisper on the TV
commercial, goose bumps run up my spine.
Alas, Word is filled with little but disappointment, a kooky mix of
Girl, Interrupted and Ransom, with Michael Douglas and company
collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid and dull kidnapping
thriller.
Douglas stars as Nathan Conrad, renowned New York psychologist, devoted
father of Jessie Conrad (Skye McCole Bartusiak), and loving husband to
Aggie Conrad (Famke Janssen).  After a gang of jewel thieves, headed by
Sean Bean's Koster, kidnaps his daughter, Nathan is forced to extract
from his new patient, the catatonic and violent Elisabeth Burrows
(Murphy), the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid
from the Koster gang a decade ago.  But with hard-nosed Detective Sandra
Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito, doing her best J. Lo impression) tracking
down Koster and his gang of hoodlums, the stakes are raised as Nathan
races against the clock to crack the mystery of Elisabeth's head in
order to get the goods inside.  The catch - Nathan only has until five
o'clock to solve the puzzle!  Whoa, the suspense is almost too much.
Don't Say a Word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes.  Murphy looks
and acts like Linda Blair from The Exorcist during the first part of the
movie, then turns around and reprises like her role from Girl,
Interrupted.  And the only real "crazy" to be found in the film is
director Gary Fleder's (Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead)
staggering use of flashback sequences.  Oliver Platt, Famke Janssen, and
even Sean Bean are decent actors, but the stuff they are given here --
such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her
crutch -- is insulting and demeaning.   Additionally, the use of the
surveillance cameras and laptops to track Nathan's every move is
downright unbelievable.  How do ex-cons fresh out of the Big House
afford all this equipment?
Despite its flaws, Don't Say a Word is surprisingly some of the best
mainstream film you'll find this month -- and audiences will lap it up. 
Americans love lukewarm, half-baked thrillers starring big names and
accompanied by cheap thrills.  Someone get me my lithium!
Director: Gary Felder
Producer: Anne Kopelson, Arnold Kopelson, Arnon Milchan
Writer: Patrick Smith Kelly, Anthony Peckman
Starring: Michael Douglas, Oliver Platt, Famke Janssen, Sean Bean, Guy
Torry, Jennifer Esposito, Skye McCole Bartusiak, Isabella Fink

Review for Heist (2001/I)
David Mamet is a good director.  Mamet's an even better screenwriter and
playwright.  The guy's authored some of the best film and theatre works
in the past decade -- The Verdict, House of Games, Wag the Dog, State
and Main, and the guy even won a Pulitzer Prize for his play Glengarry
Glen Ross.  With that said, it's such a shame that his latest crime
caper, Heist, falls apart by employing too many of the well-known
devices of a Mamet production -- double-crossing femmes fatale, overtly
memorable characters, and deceptive plot lines.
But movies like The Spanish Prisoner, Things Change, and The Winslow Boy
display a roundness to Mamet's innate abilities.  And it's almost a
crime to witness how all of that goes awry in his latest film, Heist.
Heist twists and turns along the road of documenting the shady life of
career jewel thief Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) and his posse of thieves --
Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo) and Don "Pinky" Pincus (Ricky Jay).  During a
raid on a jewelry store, Moore ends up with his mug on the surveillance
cameras and he goes on the lam from the local marshals.  He decides to
get out of Dodge with his recent bride Fran (Rebecca Pidgeon, looking
like a cross between Sharon Stone and Joan Crawford), sailing into the
sunset on his yacht.  The only problem is that his fence Bergman (Danny
DeVito) has set up a big score -- The Swiss Job -- which he wants done
so badly he holds Joe's cut of the jewelry heist on layaway until The
Swiss Job is done.  To ensure his faithful hound brings the goods home
intact, Bergman tosses his nephew Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell) into Joe's
crew for observation purposes.  Things become complicated when Joe's
wife has an affair with Jimmy, The Swiss Job turns sour, DeVito starts
acting like his character from Ruthless People, and Ricky Jay starts
looking for the exit to this mess of a film.
A Mamet production usually derives its success from a solid emotional
attachment to its characters -- usually they've been wronged and are
seeking justice or absolution.  The naďve scientist from The Spanish
Prisoner or the curious psychologist from House of Games were just
decent people we recognize in our everyday lives.  When those people get
royally screwed over, its human nature to desire retribution.  Heist
lacks any such emotional attachment.  Of greater concern is the
recycling of plot points from Ronin, which Mamet also wrote and which
deals with a similar plot involving double-crossing thieves on the run.
To save the day, though, Heist carries some of the best actors working
today.  DeVito, Lindo, and Hackman chew up and spit out the scenery
around them.  Sam Rockwell -- who usually plays naďve and jovial
characters in movies like Galaxy Quest -- plays Silk as cold,
manipulative, and downright spooky.
But the main problem with Heist is how surprisingly predictable the
story is.  Unlike the similar yet far superior The Score, there's never
any surprise during Heist's twisting.  Mamet has just become lazy with
this one.  Everything about the film looks great, but there's nothing at
all underneath.

Title
Review for Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001)
The Disney Industrial Complex and Atlantis: The Lost Empire
A feature story by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com
Say what you will, but the Disney juggernaut is a sight to behold. 
Recently, filmcritic.com sat down with a few of the biggest names in
Disney, to discuss its big 2001 summer release (Atlantis) and the future
of animation as we know it.
We talked with Thomas Schumacher, the head of Disney Animation, who
discussed the main elements for creating a financially successful
animated feature, as well as with Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale,
directors of Atlantis, to discuss the process of creating an animated
feature through CGI and traditional cell animation.
Thomas Schumacher -- Head of Disney Animation
filmcritic.com: Does Atlantis mark a departure from the Broadway
musical-style of Disney's past?
Schumacher: Disney actually produces an entire canon of musicals as
first envisioned by Walt Disney -- the Broadway musical style, the film
musical style, the pop musical style such as Tarzan -- and with
Atlantis, the film represents the first time we didn't use music or
songs for character illuminating or storytelling.  Looking forward
though, Lilo and Stitch [Disney's big 2002 release] uses six Elvis songs
-- original tracks used for storytelling purposes -- which is called in
the business "needle drop music" -- songs which people are familiar
with.  That film represents the first time Disney is using that type of
known music in one of its animation features.  Phil Collins is working
on another animated feature for Disney as well.  Even John Resnick from
the Goo Goo Dolls is contributing a song to the upcoming animation
feature Treasure Plant -- a retelling of Treasure Island set in outer
space, equipped with Long John Silver and his cyborg, shape-changing
parrot.  All of these projects represent Disney's continued support of
various music styles incorporated in its feature animation pieces.
Was there a concern about the PG rating of Atlantis?
No because the last summer's Dinosaur was PG, and if Atlantis could do
the sort of business that movie did [$140 million domestic and the
number one U.S. animated movie in Japan of all time], I would be very
happy.  The market varies all the time and I also believe that if Lion
King came out today, it would have a PG rating as well.  I am not
nervous at all.
That said, there has always been a history of controversy in Disney
animation features.  There was a particular sequence in Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs that had to be cut due the reactions of the audience. 
The dramatic elements of the characters always have been a trademark of
films produced by Walt Disney all the way up to the current animation
features of today.
How will Atlantis -- which is mainly being viewed as another big Disney
summer movie -- be positioned to stand out among the big summer releases
of 2001?
Atlantis does fit into "The Disney Brand."  It does represent the type
of film Walt would have made.  Atlantis is being positioned as an
"action film" and its trailers will be seen with such films as Pearl
Harbor.  These trailers will give the audience the clear impression that
you are not watching another Beauty and the Beast.  It's a kids' film as
well as a film that will fill the seats with adults during the nighttime
screenings.  Given that, many different pockets of animation lovers will
be drawn to the film.
Generally, are Disney's animation features more financially successful
than its live-action movies?
2/3 of an animation feature's business is done internationally.  During
the heyday of home video, for every $10 million of domestic box office
revenue for a Disney animated feature, you would expect to sell a
million videos.  That trend started to dip when every household had 50
to 70 videos in their libraries.  But with the advent of DVD, that trend
is starting to pick up again.  The DVD of Atlantis has already been laid
out with all kinds of different supplement materials.  Animation films
also make a sizable amount of money from merchandising.
Has the Happy Meal deal already been set up?
Yep, the McDonald's promotion is always very successful because it
elevates their brand with the association with all different Disney
characters -- including the characters of Atlantis.
What other projects are generated from a single Disney animation
feature?
Generally, live action features do not the have the life spans that
animation features are able to produce.  For example, Lion King had the
original movie, the Timon and Pumbaa cartoon show, Lion King II: Simba's
Pride, Lion King III (in production), and ultimately a re-release. 
Also, the Broadway version of Lion King was the most successful
production of the decade.
A new IMAX version of Beauty and Beast -- with added footage -- is
scheduled for release next year.  The direct-to-video sequel Lady and
The Tramp II will possibly generate the largest video sales of the year
for Disney.  Also, a weekly cartoon show derived from Atlantis is in the
works as well.
Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise -- Directors of Atlantis
How do you two share the directorial duties of an animation feature?
Wise: Animation is mainly a strong collaborative medium.  Gary and I
were fortunate to work with many talented artists during the making of
Atlantis.  Our relationship on the movie is mainly based on
collaboration -- the story, design and look, the editing of the movie. 
The only time we split up was during the full production mode of the
movie.  I mainly worked with the animators and the clean-up artists and
Gary would work with layout and special effects.  It's a very informal
division.
Trousdale: During the screenings of the dailies, if Kirk sees some
special effects he doesn't like or I see some animation I don't like,
we're pretty vocal: "What the hell were you thinking?"
Wise: It's understood, though, that not one area of the film is one
person's own turf.  Some days Gary would work with the animators and I
would work with the special effects guys.  It's a very big give and
take.
Trousdale: It's kind of an experimental division.  When we worked on
Beauty and the Beast, it just kind of worked, so we've used it ever
since.
What part of animation is the most challenging when making a feature
length movie?
Wise: The longest process is mainly the story development and
pre-production.  Pre-visualing the entire story on storyboards.
Trousdale: It's an ongoing process when we are working on the story.  We
don't work with a script like a live-action movie but with a basic
script outline.  We give those to our animators.  The script pages may
say something like, "The submarine is attacked by a huge sea creature." 
We've got six minutes to do this and you mainly rely on your story
artists to visually create that scene.
Wise: The story artists have tons of freedom to create action, dialogue,
and every facet of the script's outline.  The storyboard artist's
effects are what shape the story and its characters.  Sometimes, the
storyboard artist's suggestion can change the makeup of a certain
character.  In the case of Moliere [a character of Atlantis], as
scripted, he was a very stuffy, professorial guy -- a French
mineralogist who was a connoisseur of dirt.  One of story artists took
this original concept and juiced up the character into this horrible
little burrowing creature with a wacky coat and strange headgear with
extending eyeballs.  We were so enthralled with the new look that we
changed to script to fit the new character.
What other characters in Atlantis didn't make the final cut?
Wise: In the early drafts of the story, Preston Whitmore had a nephew --
sort of like a Miles Crane character -- who was always getting into
trouble on the expedition.  We decided to cut him because the story was
more about Milo and his 'odd-man out' scenario and the nephew character
ended up being too distracting from that key element of the story.
Milo, at one point, had a pet rat that lived in his pocket.  But as the
story progressed, we felt it was too familiar, like we've been down that
road before -- the animal sidekick that would mimic Milo's actions.  The
main reason for discarding that character was because you would have
expected it from a Disney story.  We want the story to be about Milo --
his story and his relationship with the characters -- instead of some
cute sidekicks.
How did the Atlantian language that was used throughout the film
develop?
Wise: It was inspired mainly by other works of fantasy we like.  We are
big fans of the Star Wars series and Star Trek series -- and even Lord
of the Rings.  Any scenario where an alien culture is so well
thought-out with history and customs and language -- Atlantis present
the unique opportunity to create a similar vein as seen in previous
fantasy pieces.
Trousdale: The issue of the language came up when we talked to linguist
Mark Okerran -- we wanted something like a Tower of Babel kind of
language -- a language which birthed many other languages.
Mark used a combination of dead languages from extinct California-based
tribes, Hebrew, Chinese, and a pinch of Latin for the final product of
the Atlantian language.
Wise: Mark was like the real-life version of Milo Thatch.
Was the production time lessened by using CGI (computer generated
images) components in the film versus the traditional cell animation
techniques?
Trousdale: It's not any easier. It's not any shorter.  It's not any
cheaper.
Wise: Certain sequences like the leviathan sequence would have taken ten
years to draw in traditional cell-based animation.  As you get more and
more tools for placing images on the screen, your appetite grows and you
start imaging things like, "Hey, we could build a mile-long giant
lobster with these things."
Trousdale: The fact is, Kirk and I come from an era before the inclusion
of CGI animation in a feature.  We always tell the guys that build the
CGI stuff, "Don't get too cocky because we could always do this
traditionally."  We always have a plan B up our sleeves.

Title
Review for Apocalypse Now (1979)
APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com
 Forget The Godfather.  The sheer brilliance of Francis Ford Coppola
lies in the images and words of his real masterpiece, Apocalypse Now. 
Twenty-two years ago, Coppola ventured into the jungles of the
Philippines to shoot an adaptation of Joesph Conrad's Heart of Darkness,
set against the turmoil and fury of the Vietnam War.  Coppola assembled
an impressive cast of actors -- 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne, Robert
Duvall, Martin Sheen (replacing Harvey Keitel), Dennis Hopper, Frederic
Forrest, and the great Marlon Brando -- and set out to shoot a war
epic.  By the end, Coppola had lost 100 pounds, principal photography
ran for 16 weeks, Martin Sheen had a heart attack, Brando demanded all
of his shots be done in shadow, and Coppola had invested millions of his
own money to keep the production going, all while threatening suicide
numerous times.  After all the pain, Apocalypse Now was finally
revealed, exposing itself as one of the most amazing pieces of celluloid
ever produced, capturing not only the ugliness and ridiculousness of
Vietnam, but exposing the dark heart of man as well.
The end result: 8 Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture) and
2 wins for Cinematography and Score.  Apocalypse Now additionally
cemented Coppola's place as an A-plus-list film director, giving him
free rein for the next 20 years to make crap like Captain Eo and Jack,
junk which no one in Hollywood would dare criticize.
Like Cameron (with The Abyss) and Lucas (with Star Wars), Coppola
recently decided to take another whack at Apocalypse Now, dubbing this
new director's cut Apocalypse Now Redux.  At a running time of over 3
hours and 15 minutes, Redux demands even more of your attention (the
original runs 2:33) and still it never lets you up for a breath of
reality. 
Apocalypse Now follows the story of a burnt out Army captain named
Willard (Sheen), who has been given the task of hunting down and
"exterminating... with extreme prejudice" a renegade Green Beret colonel
named Kurtz (Brando).  Kurtz has apparently gone insane, establishing
himself as a God for a Cambodian jungle tribe.  Willard travels upriver
on a Navy PBR with four grunts: Chef (Frederic Forrest), Chief (Albert
Hall), Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne), and Lance (Sam Bottoms, who was
on speed and LSD for most of the film's production).  Along the way,
Willard and his crew encounter the mighty Captain Kilgore (Robert
Duvall), pass the time waterskiing and shooting locals, and spend a
strange dinner conversing with French colonists still fighting the Viet
Cong.  In the end, Dante's Inferno is reached when the boat finds a
coked-up photographer (played by Dennis Hopper) and Colonel Kurtz
himself.
Apocalypse Now is not a film but a sensory overload for the insane.  The
Redux version adds over 40 minutes of original footage (not digitally
enhanced crap) which further details and defines the horrors encountered
by Willard on his travel up the river to find Kurtz.  Four main scenes
are restored: a scene where Willard and his crew encounter the Playboy
Playmates stranded upriver, the bizarre French Plantation dinner scene
mentioned above, a key scene between Kurtz and Willard which further
explores Kurtz's psyche, and additional bits on the boat near the
beginning of the journey, better establishing the camaraderie onboard.
Does Apocalypse Now need a new, longer cut?  No.  Is the original
inexplicably improved with one?  Somehow, yes.  Highly recommended.
Director: Francis Coppola
Producer: Francis Coppola
Writer: Francis Coppola, John Milius
Starring: Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Frederic Forrest,
Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper

Review for What's the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)
Martin Lawrence is not funny.  For the proof just turn to his newest
film, What's The Worst That Could Happen? -- the answer to its own
question if ever there has been one.
I don't know how Martin Lawrence -- the former 1987 Star Search winner
with an arrest record that would make Tommy Lee envious -- has been able
to survive with all of the bad, bad films he has starred in during the
past 6 years.  [Two words: Bad Boys. -Ed.]  Big Momma's House, Blue
Streak, Life, and A Thin Line Between Love and Hate are all forgettable
movies which can be found in quantity on the clearance table at your
local video store.  But survive he has, and in Worst, Lawrence is a
mediocre Eddie Murphy stuck playing another jewel thief in another
run-of-the-mill studio comedy.
Worst revolves around a ridiculous cat-and-mouse game between a thief
named Kevin Caffery (Lawrence) who gets caught burglarizing media
conglomerate CEO Max Fairbanks (Danny DeVito), who in turn steals
Kevin's lucky ring given to him by his girlfriend.  Kevin then vows to
get the ring back at any cost -- thus setting up numerous comedic
situations to follow that play out like a homogenized sitcom.  The cast
is rounded out with an annoying Latino sidekick (John Leguizamo), a
one-dimensional girlfriend (Carmen Ejogo) who spends half the movie
whining about Kevin's numerous exploits in retrieving the ring, a
super-fly white guy hacker who uses more Apple products than Jeff
Goldblum to hack into Max's e-mail and surveillance system, and Kevin's
sharp-tongued mentor (Bernie Mac) -- who deserves much better roles than
bit parts in Martin Lawrence comedies.
The comedy plays out like a Henny Youngman joke.  Kevin and his cronies
break into Max's Miami penthouse dressed up like Arabic princes and
steal PAC contributions intended for shady Senate sub-committee
members.  Kevin calls Max on his cell phone -- he answers it during a
Senate sub-committee hearing! -- and Max then curses at Kevin via the
television cameras as the sign-language interpreter makes enough obscene
gestures to would make the Diceman blush.  Whoa ho!
Sam Weisman's (George of the Jungle) direction is lopsided and
uninteresting, and the film's pacing is worse than Betty White running
the Boston Marathon.  The jokes are cheap, predictable, and come solely
at the expense of others.   Every race and lifestyle -- gay, black,
German, Arabic, and white, to name but a few -- are used as easy
targets.  Danny DeVito walks through his role as Max Fairbanks as a
mini-Gordon Gekko crossed with his Louie De Palma character from Taxi. 
The biggest insult comes in the guise of underrated actor William
Fichtner -- playing a sexually ambiguous detective dressed up like a
1970's Bowie doll who is trying to nail (ahem) Max for all of his shady
business deals.
What's the Worse That Could Happen? ... besides the release of this
film?  Sadly, Blue Streak 2 is in pre-production, for which Lawrence
will receive a $20 million dollar paycheck.  Now, that's bad.
Director: Sam Weisman
Producer: Ashok Amritraj, Wendy Dytman
Writer: Matthew Chapman
Starring: Martin Lawrence, Danny DeVito, Glenne Headley, Carmen Ejogo,
John Leguizamo, William Fichtner, Nora Dunn, Larry Miller, Bernie Mac

Title
Review for Rat Race (2001)
Crazies, Lucille Ball impersonators, redneck garage mechanics,
neo-Nazis, dykes on bikes, cross-dressers, electrified dogs, flying
cows, vomit contests, vindictive girlfriends, and Rowan Atkinson's
horrible Italian accent are the elements of success for Rat Race, the
latest hilarious remake of It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.
I know how bad it sounds.  But thanks to the comedic talents of Jon
Lovitz, Atkinson, John Cleese, and Whoopi Goldberg, plus a sharp script
written by Andy Breckman (a writer for TV Funhouse and one of the best
Richard Pryor movies, Moving) Rat Race is much better than it should
be.  In the end, it's summer junk food for the soul.
Through the orchestration of casino owner Donald Sinclair (John Cleese
in one of best performances in recent years), six groups of people are
brought together in a Vegas casino to race against each other in an
attempt to reach a satchel of $2 million in locker 001 in the train
station at Silver Lake, New Mexico.
The Pear family (headed by Jon Lovitz) finds its family vacation in
Vegas interrupted, and the Cody brothers (Seth Green and Vince Vieluf)
are two con artists whose personal injury suit against the casino goes
awry.  Mr. Pollini (Rowan Atkinson), an extremely cheerful but
narcoleptic Italian man, represents the hare of this story.  After
falling asleep on the way out of the casino, he gets hit by a creepy
ambulance driver named Zack (Wayne Knight) who is on his way to New
Mexico with a live heart in a cooler.  Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.)
is a disavowed NFL coach who blew a major call and is drowning himself
in alcohol at the casino's bar.  Vera (Whoopi Goldberg) and her
estranged daughter Merrill have reunited at the casino after Vera gave
up Merrill for adoption years ago.  Nick (Breckin Meyer) is an uptight
lawyer-in-training.  All of these clowns earn a shot at the money and
head out across the desert.
Rat Race starts off with a mildly humorous tone and then unexpectedly
ramps up to a full-blown gut buster.  Jerry Zucker, co-director of such
classics as Top Secret! and Airplane!, lends a veteran hand at handling
the pace of the comedy and keeps the laughs coming in waves. 
The main drawback of the film, though, is the lack of a solid third
act.  The humor completely dries up when all of the parties converge
onstage with the band Smash Mouth.  It ends up feeling like an old
Three's Company episode.  And about as funny.

Review for Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (2000)
I love Japanese anime on the big screen.  The gorgeous colors, the
daunting cel animation detailing the smallest blades of grass, the
complex storylines and character designs, and the thundering
soundtrack.  And the impending release of Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
has made me wet with anticipation.
The original Vampire Hunter D was produced for video only in 1985.  Its
twisted violence, a plot thick with deception and honor, perverted sex
scenes, and beautiful acts of heads and limbs being lopped off are a D&D
geek's wet dream.  Based upon volume three of Hideyuki Kikuchi's Vampire
Hunter D novel series, Bloodlust follows the continuing story of D and
his travels as a vampire hunter for hire.
In the distant future, vampires rule with an iron first over fiefdoms of
human-occupied lands with their minions of mutants and werewolves.  As
the years have passed, though, the vampire rulers have gradually lost
their power and are now being hunted by bounty hunters.  One of the most
famous hunters is a mysterious outcast named D, a "dunpeal" (born of a
vampire father and a human mother), who's equipped with a super-quick
sword, a black cape blowing in the wind, and a penchant for ass
kicking.  D's latest job involves a simple rescue operation to reclaim
an affluent family's lovely daughter Charlotte from the clutches of
Meier Link, an ultra-smooth vampire with a silly Eurotrash accent.  But
competition waits in the form of the Markus brothers -- a randy bunch of
mercenaries who use knives, strength, crossbows, and even a guy's ghost
to capture their vampire booty.  Along the way, the undead rise from
their graves, werewolves howl at the moon, and creeping evil in the
shadows crosses their paths at every turn.
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is a qualified success in the animation
department, combining fantasy with reality through the solid efforts of
Asian production house Madhouse Studios (also responsible for
co-creating the awesome HBO Spawn animated series).  But there's a
strong western influence in both set design and landscapes throughout
the picture.  As well, director Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Wicked City) handles
the action well and delivers a number of memorable moments that even
rival anime classics like Battle Angel.
On the flip side, the main problems with the film are that its plot is
weak and the characters fail to evolve.  Bloodlust never sells the
conviction of evil within any of the main characters, instead relying on
the age-old romanticism of the vampire.  Eventually it degenerates into
a standard love story/rescue mission.  Worse still, D's character is so
utterly invincible there's never a sense that the story could go any
other way than that he will save the girl and beat the evil bad guys. 
The film's humor, mainly projected by D's talking left hand, feels
forced and unsure.
Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust earns enough points in the animation
department to carry the innocuous plot.  It's almost enough to make you
forgive the lousy title.

Producer: Mataichiro Yamamoto, Masao Maruyama, Takayuki Nagasawa

Title
Review for Emperor's New Groove, The (2000)
I'll be the first to admit I didn't expect much from The Emperor's New
Groove: More Celine Dion-esque song-and-dance numbers, cuddly characters
that become cross-promotion devices in McDonald's Happy Meals, and
Hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to
their resume.
I was dead wrong about all of those things.
The Emperor's New Groove is funny.  Damn funny.  And the cute characters
in the film are the dangerous ones.  The script is fast and furious,
with no singing and dancing.  The animation is clean and would give Walt
a warm feeling all over.  The humor is dry and aimed at both the
cynicism and the goodness in all of us.  The story is ridiculously weird
and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking, cross-dressing
llamas and schizophrenia.
Here's the plot; try to follow along.  Set in a mythical kingdom, the
film follows the adventures of Kuzco (David Spade), an arrogant and
egocentric emperor.  When Kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor, Yzma
(Eartha Kitt), she and her "assistant" Kronk (Seinfeld's Patrick
Warburton) change him into a llama.  Kuzco then gets stranded in the
jungle and must rely on Pacha (John Goodman), a llama-herder whose home
was to be replaced by Kuzco's Water World Theme Park, to save him.  Then
the fun starts.
For the next sixty minutes, the audience is treated to something unheard
of in Disney films these days: Imagination.  Yzma, voiced by the
talented singer Eartha Kitt, looks like a cross between Norma Desmond,
Joan Crawford, and a really old Vegas showgirl.  The dialogue between
her and her oblivious assistant Kronk is quick, sharp, and feels like an
episode of Seinfeld (which would make sense).  David Spade and John
Goodman's character interactions make you feel like you're watching an
old Hope/Crosby film.  Spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots
below the belt on several occasions, and I laughed out loud several
times.  Needless to say, that is an extremely rare thing in Disney
screenings these days.
The best part about The Emperor's New Groove is how audacious the film
is.  The sheer weirdness factor is very high.  Cross-dressing,
schizophrenia, duality of soul, people being turned into every animal on
Noah's boat, llama CPR, homoerotic tendencies, an Emperor with his own
theme song and singer, Michael Jackson dance moves, and a guy that can
communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the
film a true orginal.
Simply put, The Emperor's New Groove is one of the best children's films
out for this holiday season.  Kids will enjoy the adventures, and
parents will enjoy the story and dialogue.  That's a tough thing to pull
off in a single package, but this Emperor manages to do it.

Review for 102 Dalmatians (2000)
It's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children --
are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at
the end of a film.  That about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102
Dalmatians, a cold pea soup of cute animals, stupid Home Alone antics, a
boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans, and Glenn Close reprising
her best Joan Crawford impression.  Indeed, Walt Disney is rolling over
in his grave again, cursing John Hughes' name for making the original
live-action 101 Dalmatians, one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time,
and now its sequel.
The main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 Dalmatians is its
predecessor, 101 Dalmatians.  The original made more than $100 million
dollars at the box office, spawned a torrid collection of "collectible"
items that ended up months later in the discount bins of Wal-Marts
across the country, and generally made every kid on the planet want a
damn Dalmatian pup for Christmas.  Well, it's been about four years
since then, and Dalmatian fever is coming back, and this time it's
digitally enhanced.
Here's the story.  Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) is released from prison
due to the "cure" of her puppy homicide urges by one Dr. Pavlov.  (Oh,
how witty.)  She rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a
probation officer, who oddly turns out to be her victim from the
original film.
Cruella then becomes Ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists, like a
dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck, and she becomes
the evil vixen again.  A kidnapping plot unfurls again as Cruella
decides she still needs her Dalmatian coat, but she now needs 102
Dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 Dalmatian formula.  At this
point, I was envying those kids filing out of the theater.
How low have Glenn Close and Gerard Depardieu (as the film's villain)
sunk in the film business?  It's almost laughable in a sadistic way to
watch Close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the
wardrobe of Flash Gordon.  And Depardieu... how can a French guy have a
bad French accent?  And never mind the toilet brush haircut.
The only minutely positive selling point I can even think to point out
is the talking bird with a British accent (courtesy of Eric Idle) that
thinks he's a Rottweiler.  Now that's funny.
Director: Kevin Lima
Writers: Kristen Buckley, Brian Regan, Bob Tzudiker, Noni White
Producers: Edward Feldman, Patricia Carr, Paul Tucker
Starring: Glenn Close, Ioan Gruffudd, Alice Evans, Tim McInnerny, Gerard
Depardieu

Title
Review for Hamlet (2000/I)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/5f536061548d6f29882568cd000b0f58?OpenDocument
A new school of acting should be constructed based on the method of
Ethan Hawke.  I am the first to admit that I enjoy Ethan Hawke in almost
anything he does.  The reason I like him so much is because he brings
the essence of the brooding soul to the screen so well.  Hawke plays
Tortured Guy so perfectly they should give an award at the Oscars every
year and call it the `E. Hawke Award for Best Brooding Performance of
the Year'. As a natural-born brooder, the character of Hamlet perfectly
suits Hawke because the role has always been given to older guys looking
to validate their dramatic acting chops.  Hawke's Hamlet is the
Generation X Hamlet.  A Hamlet that uses his `discontent' with the world
as a razor against the neck of reality.
This updated 20th century Hamlet is brought to vivid realism by
independent director Michael Almereyda.  Almereyda places the play in
the year 2000, creating the state of Denmark as a huge conglomerate, the
slain king a CEO, and Hamlet as a digital video maker.  This
interpretation sounds almost like it's going to be as much fun as a
ten-car pileup on the expressway; you want to turn your head away from
in disgust but are strangely curious about what happened.
The surprise is that this is one of the best versions of Hamlet.
Almereyda has studied every film and stage version of the play, and his
history lessons have paid off.  He creates a stark, unflinching vision
of a dangerous world where trust is a lost commodity and betrayal is
weapon.
Hawke carries the vehicle well with his unflinching performance of a
haunted man pushed to the brink, finding solace among the haunting
visions of dead souls and images he captures with his camera.  The
supporting cast of Kyle Machlachan, Julia Stiles, Diane Venora, Bill
Murray-- doing a damn good job with the dialogue -- and Sam Shepard are
surprising in their ability to convey the motivations of the
characters.  Almereyda does an incredible job of taking the text and
rearranging the structure to capture a better essence of Hamlet as it
exists in the 21st century.  The most enjoyable scene is when Hamlet
recites the `To Be or Not to Be' while he is walking up and down the
aisles of a Blockbuster Video.  The imagery of the enormity of the
aisles and the sense of Hamlet lost within a world of escapism is
haunting and strangely unnerving.  Julia Stiles equally provides a quiet
reserve to the character of Ophelia and her muted voice speaks strongly
in scenes as others determine her fate for her.
Michael Almeryda's Hamlet is dangerous and sharp-edged.  It retains a
clear hold of the text and doesn't try to dress up the scenes with
numerous cuts and flashy imagery.  The actors smoothly roll through the
acts and do not drag things down with dramatic flair.  Speakerphones,
video, digital still photos, laptops, and cell phones are used as not
only showpieces, but also as valid devices to communicate the play's
text.  If more classic plays can be updated with such brilliance, maybe
more people will put down their Backstreet Boys biographies and pick a
Hemingway novel or a Shakespearean play and start to understand the
world around us.

Review for Art of War, The (2000)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://a.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/d891a13b4587813d8825694700009cdd?OpenDocument
Wesley Snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles.  Murder at
1600, U.S. Marshals, Money Train, Drop Zone, Boiling Point, and the
ultimate camp film - Passenger 57.  The Art of War is another entry in
this very ugly and unique category.  Ultimately, it is little more than
a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the Warren Report,
ugly violence that would have made Peckinpah cringe, and terrible acting
by B-list actors like Michael Biehn and Anne Archer.  Oddly, it feels
like the undiscovered sequel to another Snipes "masterpiece," Rising
Sun.
The movie revolves around the convenient story of a special UN operative
caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a Chinese ambassador,
the Chinese Triad Brotherhood, a rich Chinese businessman (played
bythat bad guy from Rising Sun, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) a Chinese UN
interpreter, and, inexplicably, Donald Sutherland.  The film ends with
more confusion than a boatload of Chinese immigrants trying to register
at Ellis Island.  Or should I say the film ends with the most blatant
ripoff of both The Matrix and all of John Woo's Hong Kong films
combined.
I am really at a loss to figure out why Wesley Snipes had the gumption
to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers
of the film.  I usually enjoy Snipes' movies - though his dramatic roles
better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his
action films.  Simply, I am amazed by the how inane the script was,
filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences. 
Director Christian Duguay (Screamers) has a strange attraction to the
viciousness of violent acts -- showing splattering brains, people
impaled with broken shards of glass, and lots of gargling and gagging as
blood sprays everywhere.  It also sickens me to know that Oliver Stone,
one of the greatest directors working today, had his hand in producing
this monstrosity.  I guess Snipes sold Stone on the conspiracy angle and
Stone chose not to read the script, watch the dailies, be involved in
casting, or anything else -- or else he'd be filing a court order to
remove his name from the credits.
It's also seems evident that with the Russkies as our new bosom buddies
and the Middle Eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last
couple of years that the new international enemies in Hollywood are the
Communist Chinese.  I'm sure over the next couple of months, even more
"Chinese conspiracy/martial-arts action flicks" are going to be popping
up in your local multiplex.
Hopefully they won't include Wesley Snipes.
Director: Christian Duguay
Writer: Simon Barry, Wayne Beach

Starring: Wesley Snipes, Michael Biehn, Anne Archer, Donald Sutherland,

Title
Review for Men of Honor (2000)
I just can't seem to get enough of the thrill of the being submerged in
hundreds of feet of water with the ever-present threat of drowning all
around me.  You know, that feeling of small animals crawling into my
wetsuit or larger animals deciding to eat me whole.  The intoxicating
sensation of my lungs exploding from gas build-up in my lungs.  How can
you argue with that?
There have been hundreds of diving movies made -- The Big Blue, The
Abyss, and all those Ester Williams movies in the fifties.  But wait --
the latest Hollywood diving opus has arrived, just in time for Oscar
consideration and to salvage -- pun intended -- one actor's career from
the murky depths of B-movies.
Men of Honor, based on a true story, tells the tale of Carl Brashear,
the first African-American to reach the rank of Master Chief Diver in
the U.S. Navy (taking place during the pre-scuba 1950's and 1960's). 
It's a valiant attempt to tell a thought-provoking story about
overcoming racism and working through the political machinery of a white
man's Navy (while being harassed at every turn by Robert De Niro).  Cuba
Gooding Jr. - shaking off the bad memories of such films as Chill Factor
and Instinct, portrays Brashear, a hardheaded, black, Southern son of a
sharecropper, who heads off to the Navy to pursue dreams of glory beyond
the life of his father and the farm.  In the Navy, Carl encounters
racist work conditions and Mr. De Niro - who plays gruff, racist Master
Chief Diver Billy Sunday with an over-the-top performance.
Eventually receiving the recognition of the ship's captain (a small bit
part by the great Powers Boothe), Brashear is given the duties of white,
enlisted men.  Two years later, Brashear is accepted at the Navy Diver
School run by that gruff, racist Master Chief De Niro.  You can imagine
what follows: The guilt-ridden drive to achieve the dreams of his
father, the trials of acceptance into white society, the conversion of
De Niro into a sympathetic character, the Oscar speeches about not
giving up and striving forward, and the near-death of our young hero.
You know what I mean, the standard Hollywood drama stuff.
The most surprising element of the film is the strong performance by
Cuba Gooding Jr.  His brooding face and stout movements give great depth
and pose to the character.  Too bad that Robert De Niro's characters are
becoming pieces of other characters from past movies he's been in.  His
Billy Sunday is a combination of Cape Fear's Max Cady, Mean Streets'
Johnny Boy Cervello, and Casino's Sam Rothstein.  Charlize Theron and
Aunjanue Ellis are strong as the quiet and supporting wives but stand as
the most underdeveloped of all of the characters.
It's a real shame that instead of investigating the era's racism, Men of
Honor just paints broad strokes -- people from the South or from
Brooklyn must detest all black people in the film.  Instead of fleshing
out these issues, the film is full of scenes that have now become
clichés.  The black man refuses the authority of the white man's rules. 
One man is determined to triumph over all obstacles in front of him. 
Too bad that after two-plus hours of meandering about, nothing in the
movie leaves you with much determination to do anything except go to the
bathroom.
Director: George Tillman Jr.
Writers: Scott Marshall Smith
Starring: Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Charlize Theron, Hal
Holbrook, Michael Rapaport, Aunjanue Ellis, Powers Boothe

Review for Treasure Island (1999/II)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Max Messier.
You can find the review with full credits at
 http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/e38c2528c02ef98c882568b20022a9df?OpenDocument
It's very refreshing, in today's overexposed and anti-climatic realm of
moviemaking, that art still can exist in a medium such as film.  It is
very refreshing to know that there are still individuals on the fringes,
trying their damnedest to re-invent the wheel of cinema.  Treasure
Island is one of those successful ventures of creating an art film for
the sake of taking everything learned about filmmaking, piling it up,
and lighting the whole mess on fire.
The story takes place during the second World War in San Francisco.  Two
intelligence officers are assigned to the duty of creating a false life
for a dead man - including family letters, tickets to shows, and love
letters from kindred souls - and planting him in Japanese territory to
confuse the Japanese military of pending Allied military operations.
Naturally, the two officers infuse their own personal letters, hatreds,
and family situations into the creation of the life of the dead man.
The only problem is that these two officers are the two most fucked-up
individuals I have seen since Hopper in Blue Velvet.
Frank, the straightforward officer, leads a triple life of deceit and
confusion.  Frank is a polygamist with two wives, one Japanese and
hiding in Chinatown, and another that could use years of therapy to
overcome a series of personal hang-ups.  The guy is even on the make for
wife #3 on the weekends.  Throw in a bit of really strange sexual
perversions and you got one screwed up puppy dog.  His partner, Samuel,
is a walking Freudian case study of sexual domination and homosexual
longings.  He and his wife cruise the town at night looking for men to
satisfy their cravings for threesomes.  Add some repressive anger
syndrome and you've got one unhappy camper.  And remember, kind reader,
this is 1943.
Scott King, the director of this emotional roller coaster of fun, brings
to the screen the vividness of a noir film shot in the 1950's.  The film
is shot in black and white with a strange sepia tone that makes it look
like film stock that has been degraded by years and years of storage in
someone's cellar.  King immediately places the viewer in the thick of
things and only offers slight narration with location shots of San
Francisco Bay Area.  The camera angles are tight and each shot gives you
a small bit of understanding of each of the main characters' persona.
The acting is fueled by unknown stage actors who provide brutal and
frank honesty that sometimes brings about discomfort to the audience.
King's ability to successfully shoot a period piece, including costume
and production design, on an independent budget stands out as determined
filmmaking at its finest.
Treasure Island is not a film for everyone (nor is it about the
Stevenson book).  I wouldn't take my mum to see it.  Treasure Island is
a film for filmmakers and people that understand that most truthful
thing in this world is the words and emotions that people say in silence
to one another.  Treasure Island is littered with painful convictions,
hedonistic intentions, sexual repression, and a general state of
confusion about the place one must have in life.
Writer/Director: Scott King
Starring: Lance Baker, Nick Offerman, Jonah Blechman, Pat Healy
Producers: Adrienne Gruben, Lisa Papineau
