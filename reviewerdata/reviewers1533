Review for Stigmata (1999)
If nothing else, STIGMATA stands as the first Frank Mancuso, Jr. production
I've seen that wasn't just plain awful.  His previous record includes the
SPECIES films, BODY PARTS, COOL WORLD, and several FRIDAY THE 13TH sequels
which I haven't seen but could probably make an educated guess at.
This film at least has an air of quality about it: good actors (well,
Gabriel Byrne *was* also in COOL WORLD -- probably not something he's very
proud of), polished direction, and nothing in the script that caused me to
groan.  Its flaws only become apparent when you try to make sense of the
thing.
Hairdresser, clubrat and atheist Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) is
relaxing in her bath when she is suddenly gripped by a violent attack.  She
is rushed to the hospital, gushing blood from wounds that go all the way
through her wrists.  After an later incident on a subway during which her
back is lashed by an unseen force, the church becomes involved and sends a
scientist-priest named Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) to investigate the
phenomena.  The plot thickens when Father Kiernan discovers a conspiracy
involving the Catholic church and an ancient, lost scripture.
Like most stories whose premise revolves around religious phenomena,
STIGMATA falls apart under even the most casual examination.  It's hard to
discuss without spoiling the ending but I can say that what we finally learn
is the cause of Frankie's experiences does not explain them at all.  Why the
wounds, why the visions, why the violent outbursts?  Said ending is a
disappointment, and the `revelation' is a bit of gospel that even someone
with minimal knowledge of Christianity will find familiar, especially since
it is recited more than once previously in the course of the film.  The
conspiracy theme was handled much better -- albeit without the supernatural
element -- in THE NAME OF THE ROSE (1986).
The modern, techno soundtrack (composed by Smashing Pumpkin Billy Corgan and
which also features songs by Massive Attack, David Bowie and Afro Celt Sound
System) is an interesting contrast to a film in which one would expect to
hear symphonics.
It's a shame that a film that comes off so nicely otherwise is brought down
by careless storytelling.  In the end, STIGMATA is mildly enjoyable; just
take in the sights and sound and don't think about it.

Review for Sixth Sense, The (1999)
At the start of THE SIXTH SENSE, Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), an
award-winning child psychologist, is confronted in his bedroom by an
intruder who turns out to be a severely disturbed former patient.  The young
man, angry that Crowe was unable to help him, shoots him after some ranting
and then turns the gun on himself.
Cut to `the next fall.'  Crowe's current case is a young boy named Cole
(Haley Joel Osment).  Cole is a lonely outsider, considered a freak at
school.  He seems to have hallucinations, and he later confides to Crowe
that he sees the ghosts of people who don't know they're dead yet.  Crowe
throws himself full into his work, determined to make up for his previous
failure.  In the process, he loses touch with his wife, who has not only
stopped speaking to him, but who is having an affair with a coworker.
THE SIXTH SENSE is being marketed as a horror film but it's barely a
thriller.  There's nothing scary in the film; just a few minor,
clumsily-executed gross-outs (LAWN DOGS' Mischa Barton dripping puke; well I
guess if she suddenly appeared in my bedroom like that I'd be frightened
too.)  Worse, nothing happens to move the story forward.  The characters are
bores and there is no development in themselves or in their relationships
with each other.  The picture is drab and dull, both visually and because of
the flat performances.
Having grown up on The Twilight Zone' and Alfred Hitchcock Presents', I've
always been fond of twist endings, and the one that caps off THE SIXTH SENSE
is good if not completely new.  But it fails to be the revelation it should
have been.  By the time it arrived I was so numb from the rest of the
picture that it had almost no impact.  What's more, it offers no resolution
to the main story of the film.  No one is better or worse off than they were
at the start.  For a film that felt so long to sit through, it's a
frustrating disappointment.

Review for Cruel Intentions (1999)
CRUEL INTENTIONS is the latest film adaptation of the novel 'Les Liasons
Dangereuses.'  Instead of playing it straight in its historical context
(like 'Dangerous Liaisons' (1988) or 'Valmont' (1989)), however, the story
here involves modern day high school students, with a slightly incestuous
twist.
Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Philippe) and Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle
Gellar) are bored, rich stepsiblings who control much of the social life in
their academic universe.  Sebastian is a philanderer who gets whatever girl
he wants, and eventually dumps her in the most creative and nasty ways he
can think of, while Kathryn's specialty is pure revenge.  When the new
headmaster's daughter, Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon) appears in a
popular magazine article, boasting about her commitment to wait till
marriage for sex, Sebastian sees a whole new challenge.  Kathryn proposes a
wager: if he fails to bed Annette, she gets his vintage Jaguar; if he
succeeds, he gets to bed his stepsister, the one girl he's lusted after but
could never really have.  Though Kathryn wins either way, he agrees.
This is a gleefully immoral and refreshingly mean-spirited film.  Parents
would no doubt gasp at much of the talk and behavior, while this reviewer
was made to giggle uncontrollably throughout.  CRUEL INTENTIONS doesn't care
about being politically correct, favoring realism over being acceptable.
(Several reviewers have decried the homophobic dialogue in the film,
apparently forgetting what it was actually like to be in high school.)
It's a shame that such good writing is ruined by two really terrible
performances.  Philippe's delivery is so flat and unconvincing, it's almost
inconceivable that none of his character's previous conquests could see
through his act.  Similarily, Witherspoon's Annette is extraordinarily dull.
When Sebastian finally falls in love with her, one can't help but wonder
what he finds so entrancing.
Gellar is good, and Selma Blair is very entertaining as naďve freshman
Cecile, whom Kathryn attempts to corrupt to get back at her for stealing an
ex-lover.  Unfortunately, Philippe and Witherspoon do much to deaden the
film; too bad - it could have been quite good.

Review for House on Haunted Hill (1999)
Although I don't know that it hurt it in any way, it's too bad this film
came out after Jan de Bont's flashy but boring remake of THE HAUNTING,
released a few months earlier.  I wouldn't have been surprised if that film
had put people off this particular sub-genre entirely.  Myself, I'm glad I
gave it another chance.
After a gorgeous, macabre title sequence, we are introduced to Steven Price
(Geoffrey Rush), an amusement park mogul whose trademark is gimmicky rides
that are designed to scare the rider somewhat more than your typical roller
coaster drop.  His wife's birthday is coming up, and she's found the perfect
place to hold it: The now-defunct Vannacutt Institute for the Criminally
Insane.  In 1931, the inmates took over the asylum, killed the staff, and
were in turn killed while trapped in the ensuing blaze.  Since then, the
place has sat perched atop its cliff, unused.
Mrs. Price (Famke Jannsen) gives her husband a list of guests, but since he
probably hates her friends almost as much as he hates her, he trashes it in
favor of his own selections.  But the five people who finally arrive for the
birthday bash are not whom he expected, either
Making the most of the situation, Price carries out his plans anyway.  Each
guest is offered one million dollars -- provided they can last the night.
True to his profession, he has rigged some scares of his own, guaranteed to
tempt any normal person to get out of the building as fast as they can.
Eventually, of course, strange and frightening things start happening.  But
Price appears to be a victim as much as the others; is he merely playing
along, or does his wife have an agenda of her own?  Is the building, as one
of the guests insists, truly haunted?  When two of the main characters are
master tricksters, who do you believe?  This adds a whole new level of
mystery, and goes successfully keeps the movie unpredictable.
The film is full of genuine scares, not just cheap surprises included to
make you jump.  There is quite a bit of disturbing imagery, both outright
horrific and subtly chilling, that goes a lot further than any overblown CGI
ghostwork.  The final sequence is the only part that really succumbs to F/X
abuse, and though it does weaken the film a little, it doesn't keep me from
recommending it.
The cast is great, particularly Rush who seems to delight in his role as
master of proceedings.  And keep an eye out for cult favorite Jeffrey Combs
as Dr. Richard Vannacutt.
While HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL doesn't transcend its genre, it still stands out
from the crowd.
(Oh, and stay past the closing credits.)
