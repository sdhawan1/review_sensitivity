Title
Review for First Wives Club, The (1996)
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.  And when you get three scorned
women together, look out world!
That's the basic premise behind "First Wives Club," an entertaining new
comedy starring Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton. These three
portray college buddies who grew apart after graduation. Midler and Keaton
became homemakers, and both helped their husbands become business
successes. Hawn became a movie star, and her husband became her producer.
They get together after a mutual friend, played by an unbilled Stockard
Channing, commits suicide after her ex-husband divorces her and marries
Heather Locklear.
One thing leads to another, and wouldn't you know it?  There's an epidemic
going on!  Men dumping longtime, faithful wives for younger, sexier women,
film at 11!  
The rest of the movie becomes an X-chromosome-centric revenge movie, with
the emphasis on broad humor and sitcom-like situations. Looking for
subtlety? Not here.  Looking for something that a representative of the
Y-chromosome can take as a model for good behavior?  You're going to have
to look somewhere else.
And yet the strong cast, aided by the direction of Hugh Wilson, is able to
pull this off without much of a hitch.  Maggie Smith, Sarah Jessica
Parker, Bronson Pinchot, and Elizabeth Berkeley -- yes, THAT Elizabeth
Berkeley -- all contribute here.  
Keaton is the real star here.  She gets to show a lot of the talent that
got her the Oscar for "Annie Hall," and without Keaton's stellar
performance, "First Wives Club" becomes just another man-bashing fest.
As it is, "First Wives Club" rises above its masculinity-averse tendencies
and manages to come out a winner.
