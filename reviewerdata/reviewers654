Title
Review for Beavis and Butt-head Do America (1996)
First of all, if you are a Beavis and Butt-head fan, you will love this movie, 
if you aren't you will probably hate it.  It's like a 80 minute episode with 
no videos, better than average content, some surprises, and good animation.
This movie was partially made really un-enjoyable because of talk of Beavis 
masturbating.  There is also a scene where he walks into a neighbors camper to 
masturbate which I did not find funny but disgusting.  Also in the desert 
scene they see two buzzards having sex.  The show usually does not have 
content like this and I did not excpect this.
On the plus side, it has above average jokes, likeable small parts and some 
suprisingly dramatic content.
The movie opens with giant Beavis and Butt-head monsters destroying the city 
and then they wake up and Beavis notices the TV is gone, after studying the 
broken window, the tracks on the ground, the missing TV, and the door hanging 
open Butt-head makes the assumption that "this sucks".
They go searching for there TV they end up in a trashy motel and find a 
drunken guy who thinks B&B are the people he hired to "do" his wife.  B&B 
thinks that he will pay them 10,000 dollars to have sex with his wife who is 
in Vegas. 
After the movie begins beavis and butthead are heading towards washington, 
unknowingly carrying an unstable biological weapon with the ATF hot on their 
trail led by some guy who is voiced by robert stack.
