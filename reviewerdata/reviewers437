Title
Review for Fight Club (1999)
        âAction is the adolescent antidepressant.â?
If a bunch of guys getting together to beat each other up is so
therapeutic, then Mike Tyson should be the most well adjusted
fellow on the planet.  That he so palpably isnât exposes the
central flaw of both this movie and the silly and pretentious
book itâs based on. Namely, itâs idiotic.
I wonder that a smart and talented actor of Edward Nortonâs
caliber would have anything to do with this foolish film. 
Raised in affluence and Yale educated, itâs as if heâs ashamed
of his civilized roots; âFight Clubâ? is the third
testosterone-soaked movie in a row that heâs done. 
âRoundersâ? was about how guys donât let their buds down, as
Matt Damon abandons school, girlfriend, and Gamblers
Anonymous to help a cheat named Worm.  In the fine
âAmerican History X,â? Norton got pumped, tattooed, and crazy
as a California neo-Nazi.  Women, to the extent they appear at
all in these three movies, are there to get boinked, dumped, or
in the case of  âAHXâ?, to have pot roast shoved down their
throats when they mouth off.  I think itâs time Norton made a
romantic comedy.
In âFight Club,â? Nortonâs (nameless) character has a lousy
corporate job and chronic insomnia.  For the latter, he joins
support groups for diseases he doesnât have: various cancers,
blood parasites, etc.  These sessions all end in group hugs and a
good cry, and after a good cry he can sleep.  At one of these
groups he meets Bob, an obese former weight lifter. The
steroids Bob took to compete gave him testicular cancer, and
now, ball-less, heâs developing âbitch tits.â?  This feminizing of
Bob is all very symbolic; itâs also very crude and heavy
handed.  And, incredibly, itâs supposed to be .
Support group emotional vampirism doesnât fix Nortonâs
insomnia for long, however.  Itâs all ruined when a woman
shows up and crowds him out (Helena Bonham Carter, here
looking like a grown-up version of Wednesday Addams.)  He
stops going to these church-basement hug fests.  What kind of
existence is it for men, anyway, getting all warm and fuzzy and
crying on each otherâs necks. Real men donât need therapy. 
They need a good fist fight instead.
Real men are strong and silent.  Especially silent.  The first
rule of fight club is you donât talk about fight club.  The second
rule, ditto.  Real men go silently about the business of beating
each other bloody with bare knuckles and when theyâre
through, they nod solemnly and shake hands in their new found
brotherhood.
Oh, brother.  Actually, most fights Iâve seen consist of lots of
yelling, swearing, and threatening, and little or no hitting. 
Hitting hurts.  And it usually ends in anything but happy
feelings all around.
âFight Clubâ? is silly male wish fulfillment.  If you like WWF
Wrestling, youâll love âFight Club.â?  
It gets even sillier when the Space Monkey urban guerrillas
show up, with their boot camp âMore P.E., drill sergeant!â?
nonsense.  Real men, you see, crave discipline.  
Yes, I know âFight Clubâ? isnât meant to be taken too literally. 
Like âThe Blair Witch Projectâ? and the aforementioned pro
wrestling, itâs all kinda a big joke.  Itâs part of the Gen X
sensibility (Norton has said he prefers the label âthe whatever
generationâ?) to make statements they donât really believe. 
How that differs from simple irresponsibility is beyond my
ken.  But I do know that seeing a tall, Aryan Brad Pitt putting a
pistol to the head of a young, cowering Asian convenience
store clerk, terrorizing him supposedly for his own good, is a
very disturbing image.  One thatâs eerily reminiscent of
Nortonâs âAmerican History X,â? only with the sympathy laid
on the wrong side.
