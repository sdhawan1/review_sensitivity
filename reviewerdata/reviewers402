Review for Pitch Black (2000)
Pitch Black, a new entry in the sci-fi action category of "people vs.
space bugs", manages to avoid the pitfalls that lots of other films in
this genre inevitably stumble into.  Far too often I've witnessed
these things spiral headlong into a black hole of stupidity, where
scenes that are supposed to be cool and shocking instead wind up
inducing groans and laughter.  Recent victims of this phenomenon
include Event Horizon and Alien Resurrection - both are films that had
promising buildups, and both wound up building towards events that
were just plain ridiculous.  So I'll say this much for Pitch Black -
it never crosses the fine line into the well-traveled territory of
sci-fi cheesiness, and for that I am grateful.  Unfortunately, it
tends to tread firmly on the safe side of that fine line, rarely
managing to create those moments of uber-cool that would put it on a
level with Aliens, the reigning champ of the people vs.  space bugs
film.
When people set out to battle space bugs, I'm more than willing to
suspend logic and accept plot contrivances - Pitch Black is guilty on
both counts - if it makes for a promising set-up.  Sure, have a crew
of space travelers crash land on a tri-sunned planet just as it has
it's only night in 22 years, that doesn't bother me.  And give this
crew of advanced space explorers two blowtorches and a couple
glow-sticks as their sole sources of light, I have no problem with
that.  Have a convict who can coincidentally see in the dark and has
mysterious motives, why not?  And sure, have this planet populated by
an inexplicable species that is hurt by light on a planet that doesn't
ever have a night except for this one convenient moment...  Never mind
that such a species in such a habitat doesn't make a lick of
sense... why would they have evolved on the planet in the first place?
What the hell do they eat?  There's an implication that they're
cannibals, but anyone who's taken a single science class knows that a
population can't sustain itself like that.  You can certainly come up
with some far-fetched answers and explanations on your own, but in the
end, it just plain doesn't matter.  Just go with it, cuz the
contrivances here are outweighed by the potentially cool situations.
And that's really what you're here for, now isn't it?
Alas, potential is really all we get.  Pitch Black has its share of
moments, mostly occurring in the first half, but when I walked away in
the end, it felt as if a lot of good ideas had been greatly wasted.
The film opens with a spectacular crash sequence, akin to the horrific
plane crash that that opens Alive.  A later scene that occurs when the
suns are still shining finds the reluctant Captain Fry (Radha
Mitchell) underground, tethered to a rope trailing behind her in a
series of caverns, protected from the things lurking in the dark only
by spotty shafts of sunlight.  Moments like these are exquisite, but
unfortunately they do not come often enough.
Love it or hate it, if there's one thing The Blair Witch Project
accomplished, it was to make us remember how powerful simple
suggestion can be in a suspenseful situation.  Pitch Black,
thankfully, adheres to this forgotten school of thought.  These
creatures lurk in the darkness; when we see them, we see just enough
to assemble their forms in our heads.  A frightening moment can be
easily ruined by a bad computer graphic, and Pitch Black never
succumbs to overplaying its hand in this department.  The special
effects never overstep their bounds, and we're treated to that rarity
in the modern age of blockbuster filmmaking - restraint.  The
flip-side to this coin is that a select few of the action sequences
were too dark and confusing to make out what was happening.
The planet these folks land on looks beautiful, the film has been
overexposed and saturated with different colors to effectively
simulate what light from three suns would look like.  The moment of
the eclipse is absolutely beautiful, and stands as one of the most
striking visuals I've ever seen in a film like this.  The whole film
somehow feels refreshingly like a British, independent art- house take
on the sci-fi monster movie.
But eventually it all just kind of fizzles out.  By the third act,
frankly, I was more than a bit bored.  Not too long after the sun
sets, the action starts to plod generically along, and the thrills are
too few and far between.  The focus seems to dwell too much on the
only fairly interesting crew, and there are simply too many of them
around for us to care about their problems.  When a supposedly key
'revelation' is made about the kid traveling with the group, you kinda
shrug and wonder why it was even mentioned.  The deep-voiced and aptly
named Vin Diesel, who voiced the Iron Giant and here plays the shady
convict Riddick, is admittedly extra cool.  His psychological
interplay with Captain Fry almost got to the point of being
interesting, but couldn't quite make it over the hump.
The film also missteps by providing us with an ending that is, well,
just sorta there.  When I walk into a movie like Pitch Black, I expect
something epic to close things out.  But I suppose, at the same time,
I'd rather have it just kind of stop than see things ruined with
something ridiculous and laughable (see, once again, Event Horizon and
Alien Resurrection for examples of how not to handle an ending).  For
a couple of minutes, Pitch Black seems like it's on its way to exactly
ripping off the conclusion to Aliens - and I do mean exactly.  But at
least it has the wisdom to stop itself from going in that direction.
In the end, I was thankful to have seen an example of a sci-fi action
thriller that never once seemed overtly stupid or absurd... they are a
rare breed indeed.  There's enough unique and good stuff here that
Pitch Black certainly isn't a waste of time.  Sadly, it's just a very
well-crafted waste of potential.

Review for Whole Nine Yards, The (2000)
By Sean Molloy (from www.mediajunkies.com)
There's a fledgling subgenre out there in movie-land; for arguments'
sake, let's call it the "mainstream postmodern ironic suburban hitman
comedy."  On its good days it brings you your Get Shorty's and your
Grosse Pointe Blank's; and on it's off days, well, you end up with
Mickey Blue Eyes.  The Whole Nine Yards lies somewhere in the middle
ground - it's a movie that has all the right elements waiting on the
sidelines, but suffers from having a central character that simply
can't bring everything together.
Matthew Perry plays Nick Oseransky (if he had friends they'd call him
"Oz"), the charming loser dentist.  He lives in Montreal with his wife
Sophie (Rosanna Arquette, sporting an obnoxious accent, and tapping
into the old comedic standby that Americans just don't like those
snotty French people) and her mother; it's clear that these women
despise him and wish death upon him, and that poor Oz is driven to the
brink of insanity by them, but, dammit, they're all he's got.  And
that sentence about as detailed as what we're told in the movie - the
one- minute, one-dimensional setup of these folks' relationship is
really all we get.
When the notorious Chicago hitman Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski moves in
next door, Nick's world is, of course, set on its ear.  Nick
recognizes Jimmy instantly, and, since Nick also happens to hail from
the Windy City himself, he knows Jimmy The Tulip's entire kill record
and courtroom history.  He also knows that the Gogolack crime family
back in Chicago has Jimmy on their hit list.  His wife Sophie,
money-hungry leech that she is, decides that Nick should take a plane
to Chicago and let the Gogolacks know about Jimmy's whereabouts,
hoping there's some sort of finder's fee.  Nick, spineless wimp that
he is, agrees to go along with her plan, and, of course, he gets
caught in the middle up in a mini-mobster war of sorts.  It's a silly
and contrived sitcom setup, granted, but the plot in this kind of film
is secondary; it really only needs to serve as a showcase for its
quirky and off-center characters.
But alas, The Whole Nine Yards doesn't have a whole lot to offer in
the character department - except for a few of the more minor roles,
there's just not a whole lot of quirky goin' around.  Let's take a
look at the lineup of the usual suspects, in order from least to most
appealing...
# 1 - "The Hitman's Wife" aka Cynthia aka Natasha Henstridge - She
plays Jimmy The Tulip's unhappy and uninteresting wife, and seems
genuinely surprised that a man who's killed 17 people turned out to be
a bad husband.  What doesn't seem genuine, however, is the romance
that quickly flares up between herself and Nick the Dentist.  She's
also the lucky contestant that gets to utter the inevitable line that
includes and poorly explains the movie's title.
# 2 - "The Dentist" aka Nick "Oz" Oseransky aka Matthew Perry - The
movie's fatal structural weakness.  A central character needs to be
able to hold a film together, and Nick just doesn't have what it
takes.  It's not Perry's fault that Oz is an uninteresting and only
occasionally funny guy...  He trips over couches, runs into lamps, and
stutters with the best of them, but the script makes the mistake of
filtering too much through his boring and unoriginal eyes.
# 3 -" The Hitman With a Heart of Gold" aka Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
aka Bruce Willis - Here Willis plays the fundamentally good-hearted
contract killer with the skewed view of the world that makes Nick the
Dentist roll his eyes and do spit takes.  The Whole Nine Yards
features Bruce Willis in "Acting Mode 2."  These are the movies he
does to make up for the pay cuts he takes to be in good films like 12
Monkeys and Pulp Fiction, and if that's what he has to do, then that's
all right by me.  He delivers a perfectly acceptable performance that
he could have easily just phoned in, but at least it looks like he was
having fun.
# 4 - "The Ving Rhames" aka Frankie Figs aka Michael Clarke Duncan -
If Duncan, who was the heart and soul of The Green Mile, is trying to
differentiate himself from Ving Rhames, then this is the wrong way to
go about it.  Here he plays another hitman with hidden and shifting
motives.  He shows the same kind charisma he did as The Green Mile's
John Coffey and gets some genuine smiles, but his ultimate fate seems
remarkably unfitting.
# 5 - "The Boss" aka Yanni Gogolack aka Kevin Pollak - The boss of the
Hungarian Gogolack crime family who wants to see Jimmy dead.  Most of
his laughs come from his indescribably goofy accent - a humorous and
well-practiced blend of Michael Corleone and Bela Lugosi - and the
bizarre non-words that come out of his mouth as a result.
# 6 - "The Apprentice" aka Jill aka Amanda Peet - This overly
enthusiastic protege of Jimmy the Tulip is the movie's clear standout.
She projects the same brand of believable nonchalance toward her
chosen profession as John Cusack's character in Grosse Pointe Blank.
I couldn't help but smile whenever she was on the screen.  And
unfortunately for The Whole Nine Yards, I couldn't help but wish I was
watching Grosse Pointe Blank instead.

Title
Review for Boiler Room (2000)
People who say that money is the root of all evil have never had any.
So says Jim (Ben Affleck), the trainee whip at the J.T. Marlin
brokerage firm.  Jim is a millionaire.  You, too, will be millionaires
if you come on board, Jim tells an entire roomful of nineteen and
twenty year old guys, and they believe him.  His passionate speeches
and promises of fast money are what draw them in.  The huge houses,
big screen televisions, and expensive cars in the parking lot are what
keep them there.  Among the believers is Seth (Giovanni Ribisi), a kid
who runs a back door casino in his apartment.  Watching these scenes
is all too reminiscent of the brand of cult behavior you'd find at a
recruiting session for a pyramid scheme...  I've seen friends fall
prey to this brand of seductive half-logic, shut themselves off, and
turn into propaganda-spewing sales robots.  Let me assure you, it's
not a pretty sight.
The J.T. Marlin firm is what's known as a chop shop; they use
high-pressure sales tactics to push stocks that don't exist on
faceless people over the telephone.  Its members quote David Mamet's
Glengarry Glen Ross and Oliver Stone's Wall Street as if they were
reading from the Bible, and take every word from these films with
their irony and sarcasm detectors held in the off position with a
piece of duct tape.
To my surprise, there's been an inordinate amount of internet-fueled
backlash against how the characters are trying too hard to sound hip
and cool, and all they accomplish is that they wind up sounding like
posers.  All I can say to that is, well... duh.  Boiler Room shows us
an entire stock-market subculture that's traded individuality for a
quick buck; it presents us with figures that have ceased being people
and have become simple tools to perform a job.  They smack of
phoniness, and we witness through their pathetic attempts at "romance"
and snap bar fights how they can't function in society, but only
amongst themselves and in the context of their work.  There are themes
at work here that are addressed in David Fincher's Fight Club... only
these brokers aren't fighting to break free from societal chains, but
rather to keep themselves from losing them.
Most of the J.T. Marlin family chooses to shut its eyes and plug its
ears against the obvious fact that the firm isn't exactly on the up
and up...  senior broker Chris is one of them (Chris is well played by
Vin Diesel, who also stars in this week's Pitch Black, and the guy
displays an undeniable charisma in both of these films.)
But unlike the others, Seth soon begins to understand the grotesque
machine he has become a part of, and he does not like what he sees.
When his sense of ethics kicks in, he's torn between the huge amounts
of money he stands to make and the fact that he just screwed over a
family man in order to make that money.  He toys with the old
soldiers' adage of "just obeying orders" to try and justify it to
himself, but he eventually realizes he simply can't go on living like
that.
This is where Boiler Room makes its most effective move.  The film
genuinely complicates Seth's motives by making him a kid who, when all
is said and done, simply craves the approval of his father.  This
layer of the movie adds a welcome dimension to what easily could have
been another exercise in tired, generic ethics.  The treatment of
Seth's girlfriend Abby (Nia Long) is another refreshing piece of the
picture.  Their romance seems genuine, the potential interracial
political correctness is held at bay; and as Seth's moral center, she
doesn't simply offer the good and righteous answers - her views are
often as skewed as his own.
My only complaint comes at the end, and it's a trap that too many good
films tend to fall into.  Boiler Room goes a long way to demonstrate
the wrongs Seth has done and how he feels about it - through
interjecting scenes of the people whose lives Seth has destroyed, as
well as through Seth's own actions.  But then the movie decides to
spell out in big, bold letters what we already know, and a character
essentially delivers a sermon on what the audience has already been
effectively shown.  So a note to filmmakers: Subtlety and subtext are
wondrous things, put faith in the intelligence of your audience, and
trust that you got your message across.  Please, I'm begging you,
don't beat me over the head with it.

Title
Review for Reindeer Games (2000)
Starring Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, Gary Sinise
Directed By John Frankenheimer
Warner Bros., Rated R, 2000
Running Time: 1 Hour 45 Minutes
Your first clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the
movie you're about to see: It's heavily Christmas-themed and its
release date is, oh, say, at the end of February.
Your second clue that something isn't gonna be quite right with the
movie you're about to see: Charlize Theron, one of the movie's dubious
stars, makes an appearance on The Daily Show in which, when asked if
her new movie's any good, she replies with the equivalent of a verbal
sigh... assuring us that, yeah, it sure is a movie, all right!  And
there's some scenes like those you'd expect to find in a movie, and
there's some action... and there's other...  stuff... too.
How to immediately grab my attention: Open your movie with five dead
guys in Santa Claus suits.  Then show a caption reading "Six days
earlier..."  Ya know, I was honestly interested to find out what
killed all those poor Santas...
How to immediately lose my attention: Follow your opening scene with a
terminally dull nice-guys-who-don't-deserve-to-be-in-prison scene.
Write a line for the one of prisoners like "I just want to go home and
eat Christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad."  Then, have Ben
Affleck actually say that line, on film, and forget to leave it on the
cutting room floor.  For good measure, throw in a poorly motivated
prison riot and have Affleck's best buddy stabbed... aw... and just
two days before his release, too.  Already the cliches are piled on
thick, and when it rains, it pours.
How to take my attention, dash it violently against the rocks, and
make it so that I'm contemplating my strategy for calling "shotgun"
about an hour before I know the credits will roll: Deny your
characters the ability to think.  Have Ben Affleck, for some reason
I'll never understand, pretend he's his dead prison buddy so that he
can get his girlfriend, played by Charlize Theron.  Have Gary Sinise
show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned
casino heist.  The villains' big idea?  Kidnap Affleck because he used
to be a security guard at the casino, force him to tell you where all
the doors in the place are, then dress up in Santa suits, create some
"diversions" and rob the place.  On paper, it seems like the stuff of
a potential caper comedy, but veteran director John Frankenheimer
wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he's looking at the
makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller.  It's not like
the man isn't capable... far from it.  He's the man responsible for
classic political thrillers like The Manchurian Candidate and Seven
Days in May.  He wowed me with some the most memorable car chases I've
ever seen in last year's Ronin.  But he's certainly guilty of churning
out some certifiable losers... put Reindeer Games on the shelf of
shame with his 1996 version of The Island of Dr. Moreau.
Step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible: Cast
Ben Affleck in the role of the world's most generic hero.  He gets no
good one-liners, he doesn't get to shoot or implode anything in new
and interesting ways, and all we know about him is that he regrets his
past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of
pecan pie.  His name is Rudy (short for Rudolph, in all likelihood.
See, it's called Reindeer Games.  Get it?  Get it?  Shut up.)  In the
past, Affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor, and Reindeer
Games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man.
Step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible: Gary
Sinise's villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook
a filmmaker could have some up with.  He's dirty and potty-mouthed,
he's got long, scruffy hair and a goatee, and I fully expected him to
walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them.
He's also extremely inept at what he does.  He thinks garish cowboy
costumes and Santa suits make acceptable disguises, and he trusts
Affleck's character to pull through even after, time and time and time
again, he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him.  But
instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role, Sinise
seems to think he's playing some sort of tough, smart, and smooth
criminal mastermind, rather than the complete moron that was obviously
written into the script.  [On a side note, Gary Sinise wins this
week's "Title!" award, as he's the one who gets to awkwardly cram the
name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings.
Last week's winner was Natasha Henstridge for The Whole Nine Yards.]
How to take your bad idea and make things worse: Include two or three
plot twists that, instead of making the apparently stupidity of the
plan seem suddenly intelligent, make the plan seem even more
ridiculous and unlikely.  This is a bad movie.  And what's worse is
that, except for a few moments near the not-so-stunning conclusion as
the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous, Reindeer
Games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad.
If they'd done that much, at least I would have been entertained.

Title
Review for Wonder Boys (2000)
This is the kind of film that hits close to home.  Not because I've
ever hobnobbed with literary greats, not because I've ever had
best-selling novelists for friends and college professors, not because
I've ever killed a man's dog and carried it around in my trunk for the
weekend.  Even though I've never met any of the characters in director
Curtis Hanson's latest film Wonder Boys, I feel like I know them all.
Some folks would call them quirky - I call them real.  Their lives
seem honest and true, and there's a wealth I can find in common with
what these people do, say, think, and feel.
Curtis Hanson's last picture, the brilliant L.A. Confidential, was a
stylish modern film noir which struck a powerful mood and was largely
story-o-centric.  Wonder Boys is a sudden shift in gears for Hanson,
as it's quiet, funny and bittersweet, concerned mainly (and wisely)
with its people rather than its plot.
Michael Douglas plays English professor Grady Tripp in what is easily
one of his best performances.  Even a self-proclaimed Michael Douglas
hater among our film-going group whole-heartedly agreed, adding that
for once he wasn't playing someone rich, unhappy, or both.  Grady
teaches writing to a class full of would- be novelists and editors.
He tells them to focus, instructs them find their voice, implores them
to know their goals... then he returns to his cluttered home to smoke
some weed and work on his 2611-page second novel, seven years in the
making, which he hasn't got a clue how to end.
Grady has been through two marriages, and the third is about to end.
We never see his wife, we only hear about her and guess that she was
probably right to step out on this man that's never really given her a
second thought.  A fourth relationship - this one with Sara, the
chancellor of the university he teaches at (played by Fargo's most
excellent Frances McDormand) - is already underway and has been for a
while, and we sense that Grady's attention will doubtlessly wander
away from her before too long as well.
So when it seems as if Grady is going to take a troubled and brilliant
student named James (Tobey Maguire, one of my favorite actors these
days) under his wing, it comes as no surprise that he chooses to pass
him off as someone else's problem when he become too bothersome.
Grady Tripp is a guy who can't practice what he preaches - he can't
find his focus, he has no idea what his own goals are.  He calls James
a wonder boy, but we know that Grady is exactly the same, someone
who's just been plodding along in his life, someone who still needs to
find himself and, inevitably, grow up.  "You teach us that writers
need to make choices," one of his students (Katie Holmes) tells him
after reading an overwhelmingly detailed section of his latest novel.
"It reads like you didn't make any."
We know from the get-go that by the end, Grady is going to figure out
his life... or at least figure out how to figure it out - but what
makes Wonder Boys special is the journey there.  None of the
characters are drawn in broad, stereotypical strokes - they all have
refreshingly real, complex feelings, both sexual and philosophical.
It would have been easy to make Grady's editor Terry Crabtree (Robert
Downey Jr.) your standard Hollywood gay man - instead, Terry is a
drawn as a guy who's completely comfortable with the fact that he
doesn't understand whatever the hell it is that drives him.  Tobey
Maguire's James cries when jackets look too lonely.  He carries a gun
and is a brooding and compulsive liar, not because of some past trauma
or horrible childhood, but because he chooses to be that way... he
likes it in the dark.
Wonder Boys reminds me of a less goofball version of Rushmore, a great
and mostly overlooked movie that came out about a year ago.  Aside
from being in part about teacher/student relationships, both films are
about characters who are struggling to grow up, realizing they were
fighting the battle only once it was finished.  Both feature peak
performances from stars that a lot of folks believed were past their
prime - Bill Murray in Rushmore, Douglas in Wonder Boys.  Both fill
the role of the requisite "coulda-been-a-contender" February movie
released just after the announcement of the Oscar nominations - too
late to be considered for this year, too early to be remembered next
year.

Title
Review for Mission to Mars (2000)
Mission To Mars (** out of ****)
Starring Gary Sinise, Connie Nielsen, Tim Robbins
Directed By Brian DePalma
Buena Vista Pictures, Rated PG, 2000
Running Time: 1 Hour 53 Minutes
"I'm afraid there's a few things in his movie that couldn't quite
happen. Having people in space take their helmets off is wonderful
drama, but..."
- Buzz Aldrin, commenting on Brian DePalma's latest film Mission To Mars 
Before I begin, I have to admit that I went into Mission To Mars armed
with a fairly sharp bias.  I'm guilty of reading piles of internet
anti-hype and spiteful test-screening reviews.  I am not instilled
with confidence when I hear that instead of showing up to discuss his
film with students at a university's Director's Screening Night, Brian
DePalma sent along a piece of paper bearing the words "Hope you have
fun!"  I'm also guilty of hoping Mission To Mars would end up being
something it did not aim to be - an intelligent and original
science-fiction film.  Everything here has been done before - and done
far better - by films like 2001, Close Encounters, The Abyss and
Contact.  Call this course Intro To Science Fiction, and it's being
added to the curriculum about thirty years too late.
So, I didn't get what I wanted, it's not the first time... instead of
the memorable and thoughtful sci-fi epic I desired, or the flaming
heap of Armageddon-style dung I expected, Brian DePalma has delivered
a beautifully filmed and occasionally effective space melodrama.  The
astronauts on this Mission are the kind that watch videos of their
dead wives, and shed a tear as she stops to deliver a philosophical
soliloquy in the middle of a party.  They speak in exposition,
relaying in movie-science terms the concept of DNA to one another, as
if they think their counterparts didn't graduate from high school.
They clue fellow spacemen and spacewomen in on what exactly the
mission they've been on for thirteen months is.  They have their share
of improbable but undeniably suspenseful close calls and near misses.
Science and logic are freely traded for drama, usually to some degree
of success.  There's a effectively moving moment where a character
removes his helmet in the depths of space... what occurs then on the
screen is far removed from what would have actually happened to the
poor bastard.  Good thing, since the resulting blood-boiling,
explosive mess would probably have marred the dramatic occasion a tad.
I probably would have even shed a tear if the depth of character
development went beyond "is currently involved in a loving
relationship" or "was at one time involved in a loving relationship."
The upshot of this void of personality is that the script thankfully
manages to sidestep the tired introduction of the "crewmember gone
bad."  Not a one of them falls prey to the dreaded disorder of space
dimentia.  Could this be the first space movie to feature a crew that
actually gets along with one another?
The film's greatest strengths are visual ones... Mission To Mars
begins with what appears to be a long, continuous take, exploring a
group of people at a party.  He did the same exact thing at the
beginning of last year's atrocious Snake Eyes, only here, it seems as
if he's just trying to establish it as some sort of DePalma trademark,
because it's absolutely pointless.
The film's second major sequence, however, is an absolute
stunner... the unsuspecting crew of one of the Mars teams (led by Don
Cheadle) accidentally summons up the wrath of the planet itself - if
you've seen a preview for the film, you've probably seen the
snake-like dust funnel.  It's frightening, and it looks fantastic.
And as these events are transpiring on the planet, Mission Control is
monitoring them millions of miles away, twenty minutes after they
actually happen.  It's set up as a potentially nifty story-telling
device, but unfortunately nothing ever really comes of it.
The rest of the film follows the rescue crew as they try to get
themselves to Mars and rescue whoever may have survived... There's
some satisfyingly suspenseful moments as, inevitably, things don't go
quite as planned.  Most of the scenes in space are pretty impressive
technical feats.  DePalma's camera floats and rotates around the
spinning space station with disorienting dexterity, but too often it
looks like he's doing it just to show off.  And the sweeping rocky
vista of Red Planet itself looked, well, just like I'd expect Mars to
look.
As Fozzie Bear used to say, "Getting There Is Half The Fun."
Apparently, he's never been on a mission to Mars...  Alas, once our
intrepid crew arrives on the Red Planet, What They Find When They Get
There is insipid and boring.  Cover your ears if you don't care to
hear this, but I'm not really giving away more than what's in the
trailers... if you've seen a single commercial, I guarantee you
already know how the Mission ends.  I don't know, maybe I've just read
far too many science fiction novels in my time, but for my money,
human DNA is probably the least interesting item on the list of "cool,
exciting things you can find in space."  Mix in "lame computer
animation" and combine it with "overwrought emotional dreck," and now
you know what Mars' limp secret is.
I once played a game on my old Commodore 64 called Zak McKraken and
the Alien Mindbenders.  It was one of Lucasarts' first comic
point-and-click adventures, and it featured astronauts that were
headed off to explore that creepy face structure on Mars, much like
this daring crew.  What they uncovered was a sinister plot concocted
by a race of Alien Elvis Impersonators to make the people of Earth
terminally stupid.
