Review for True Crime (1999)
TRUE CRIME **˝ (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( truecrime@filmfreakcentral.net )

Bring some chip dip and a couple of hot ladies.)
starring Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington, Denis Leary, Diane Venora
screenplay by Larry Gross, Paul Brickman and Stephen Schiff, based on
the novel by Andrew Klavan
directed by Clint Eastwood
True Crime is a clock movie. Its hero has less than 24 hours to prove
a death row inmate's innocence, and we are reminded of his deadline
throughout by various shots of clocks that grow more ominous as the
film wears on. The clock movie subgenre has had its ups (High Noon)
and downs (D.O.A.-the Quaid/Ryan version); True Crime is a
mixed bag-its leisurely pace (curiously) works for it. Its lack of a
meaty and seamless plot is what robs the film of urgency. 
Eastwood stars as Oakland Tribune scribbler Steven Everett, a
womanizing lout who relocated from New York after a sexual tryst with
the wrong girl (the daughter of his employer). He has inherited a
"human interest sidebar" piece from recently deceased colleague
Michelle (Mary McCormack): to cover the final day in the life of
convicted killer Frank Beachum (Washington). Because his nose tells
him he smells something rotten, Everett pulls a Dick Tracy, and
reinvestigates the case; he turns up evidence that lawyers and judges
overlooked after six years of trials and appeals. (Thankfully his boss
Alan (James Woods) points out the implausibility of such an
occurance.) Few have faith in Everett: not Bob (Leary), a coworker
whose wife is sleeping with Steven; not his own wife or daughter, both
of whom he neglects; and certainly not the people directly involved in
Beachum's case-they believe Everett's accusations are the ramblings of
a man who has tumbled off the wagon. 
True Crime solves its great big puzzle-we are treated to (ineffectual)
Rashomon-style flashbacks that eventually spell out what really
happened that fateful day when Beachum supposedly murdered a
convenience store clerk. But a number of questions it raises remain
frustratingly unanswered. Why, for instance, did Michelle leave behind
all her paperwork on her story filed neatly in a box in her home? Was
she expecting to die in a car accident, and for Everett to break into
her place looking for information instead of, say, her desk at the
Tribune office? Why does James Woods' character defend his fierce
loyalty to Everett by stating, "I've worked with him for three and a
half years!"? In newspaper time, this seems like nothing-surely not
long enough for an editor to go out on a limb and risk public
embarrassment. And how is it that a lone ranger properly solves the
Beachum mystery in mere hours, anyway? (Said solution is, alas,
irritatingly simple.) 
However, what I really want to know is how Everett scores so many
young chicks! True Crime marks the first time Eastwood looks genuinely
old onscreen. When frail Steve prances around shirtless, it's the
singularly most unsexy moment Clint's ever had on screen. I suspect
True Crime would have been a better vehicle for Jeff Bridges or
Michael Douglas-actors used to seeking redemption onscreen, and whose
physical appeal is still plausible. 
What True Crime has going for it is a few brilliant sequences.
Eastwood's game of "speed zoo" with his daughter sums up in two
minutes everything that's wrong with the career-oriented parents of
America, circa 1999-it's also the most rousing bit of action in the
film. Michael McKean as a cheeky prison priest provides some genuinely
uncomfortable moments-and a strategically placed lens flare during his
final scene is the movie's best joke. (The picture's symbolism doesn't
end there: prison signs are written in the same font as the Oakland
Tribune banner; a little girl crayons pictures of "greener pastures";
and so on.) Washington's relationship with his family is as potent
as Penn's in Dead Man Walking (though I couldn't shake the feeling
that True Crime's final scene had been more than inspired by Walking's
wrenching conclusion-even if it was photographed in vintage Eastwood
style, by veteran lenser Jack N. Green). And the performances are
generally terrific-particularly Venora, adding depth to essentially
the same woman she played in Heat. Unfortunately, Leary is robbed of
his profanity, a weapon he wields better than any working comedian
right now. 
Eastwood started off the decade so well, with the one-two punch of
Unforgiven and the vastly underrated A Perfect World (a mainstream
film so unformulaic it confused audiences-it's Clint at his most
relaxed as both director and costar). He has a late career desire to
adapt books, but translating bestsellers (such as Absolute Power and
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) for the big screen hampers
his lyricism and jazzy improvisational style.

Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME **1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( shagme@filmfreakcentral.net )
I can't wait to revisit Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. 1997's
Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery failed to light up my life
the first time I saw it; I felt no urge afterwards to utter Austin's
catchphrases, among them "Yeah, baby, yeah" and "Shag-adelic!"
Subsequent viewings of the film somehow improved its comedy; by the
time I received Austin Powers... on DVD for Christmas, I was a
full-fledged fan. The Spy Who Shagged Me features as many guffaws as
its predecessor, but I left the screening feeling again amused but 
unenamoured.
This sequel picks up almost immediately where the first picture left
off. After the luminous Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) makes a
startling revelation to Austin (Myers) during their honeymoon, the
superspy is off once again to do battle with Dr. Evil (also Myers).
This time, the bald, scarred, pale madman has devised a time machine, 
which he uses to go back to the sixties. There, with the aid of his
pint-size clone Mini-Me (Troyer) and an obese bagpiper (who eats
babies) named Fat Bastard (Myers, in repulsive make-up), he locates
Austin Powers' cryogenically frozen body and steals his mojo. Nineties
Austin is rendered impassive to espionage and randy women, so he
travels thirty years into the past to get his groove back. At his old
pad, he hooks up with sexy Felicity Shagwell (heart melting, doe-eyed
Graham), and together they search for Dr. Evil's volcanic lair.
Despite much crass humour that follows (including an endless anal sex
jape), The Spy Who Shagged Me is ultimately sweet. The film covers no
new ground in terms of homage to bygone spy thrillers, and very little
of the humour is innovative, but its genteel tone smoothes over the
laughless bumps.
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is only casually interested in
telling us a complete story. Mostly, it's a showcase for Myers' range
and improvisational skills. (Duh.) Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard
are such distinct characters that one will not likely scan for
split-screen lines when any combination of them is on camera together.
"Distinct," however, doesn't necessarily mean "rich." Austin, for all
his signature attributes (the rotting teeth, the velvet suits, the
soundbite-ready dialogue), sends-up popular British TV and movie
secret agents who were never taken seriously in the first place. Watch
a swinger like "The Avengers"' John Steed (played with pursed-lip 
winkingness by Patrick Macnee in several incarnations) or the mod
criminals Steed pursued in action and you'll see prototypes for Austin
Powers rather than ripe targets for parody. Austin the man is a
one-note joke whose only real appeal is his promiscuity-it's been too
long since we've had a hero who lives and breathes for sex. (Aside: a 
naked Austin once again prances around buck naked, but his private
parts aren't so cleverly disguised in The Spy Who Shagged Me-in fact,
digital trickery appears to have erased them altogether.)
In other words, Austin is amusing but Dr. Evil is the star of this
show. Much funnier than Austin's non-sequitor gags, such as a lame
montage involving the Queen's guards set to "I'm a Believer," are Dr.
Evil's non-sequitor gags. It is through the desperately uncool Dr.
Evil that Myers and company skewer: the Jerry Springer show (in 
two very funny sequences-be sure to stay through the end credits);
1996's The Island of Dr. Moreau remake (Dr. Evil and Mini-Me perform a
hilarious piano duet of Joan Osborne's "One of Us"); Jerry Maguire;
time travel movies; and, of course, James Bond. There are also amusing
subplots involving Dr. Evil's sampling of Austin's mojo and the
strained relationship between the doctor and his logic-prone son,
Scott (Green). (As before, Scott is constantly told to shut up by his
father, here in umpteen variations on "zip it." My favourite: "Ladies
and gentlemen of the court, exzipit A.'")
The audience I watched it with cheered the antics of both Austin and
Dr. Evil. (Perhaps I will, too, one day.) Based on crowd reaction, The
Spy Who Shagged Me will see smashing box office returns. While I have
reservations about recommending it, I would never begrudge it of
success.
