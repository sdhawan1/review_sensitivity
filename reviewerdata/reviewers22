Title
Review for Deep Impact (1998)
I'm not a professional movie reviewer, but I decided to give on for this
movie.
    If I frequent this sub, you will notice that I am very critical of
movies.  So any positive review is rare.  I consider my reviews are for the
"thinking" person, although there may be some "thinkers" who disagree.
    Jenny Lerner happens upon what she thinks is a bland story about sex and
scandal in the White House.  She immediately finds herself in the midst of a
year long secret that a comet is headed for Earth and will impact in on
year.  What transpires after that is a race against time as citizens of the
world dash to safety.
TÃ©a Leoni does a very good job with a fairly limited script as she provides
an eyebrow raising performance on the big screen.  The all-star cast
provides interesting psychological perspectives as they ponder their
respective fates.
    The plot of the movie itself is a good one, and for once my digest of
"Hollywood" endings was justified, as this movie pulled a 180 and provided
what I call a very realistic ending.  The special effects were precise, not
over done, yet quite reflective of the awesome power of a 1000 ft. tidal
wave.  And finally, a movie that DOESN'T ridiculously depict people
"outrunning" a shock blast (I.e., Independence Day).
    Unless you are an astronomical scientist, you will be hard pressed to
find any impossibilities in this depiction of special effects.  The only
draw back I saw in this movie, which was completely overshadowed by it's
very satisfying ending, was the poor realism of human behavior as a whole in
the face of imminent doom.  For example, with a year warning, no communities
or individuals were creating underground shelters of their own, especially
since there was not enough room in the military underground city to house
more than a million people.
I give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars out of 4, one of my highest ratings.
