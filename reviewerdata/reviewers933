THE CLASSIC STORY & THE PRODUCTION WHICH RUINED IT
Marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 H.G.Wells classic, New
Line Cinema, armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man
Stan Winston (Alien, Predator, Terminator etc) churns out yet another
Hollywood film based on the classic novel. Of course, the production is
no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies, one of
which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977, under the
title THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS (sounds like a much better title..).
The story begins with Edward Douglas (Thewlis), a UN representative sent
to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific, who is saved
from the brink of death by Montgomery (Kilmer) after his plane crashes
into the sea. Douglas soon learns that Montgomery is working for
Dr.Moreau, who incidently, owns the island and also a reputable
geneticist who has been awarded the Nobel prize. His host's reluctance
to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he
stumbled into Moreau's lab, when a monstrous birth was in progress. Even
worse, the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal "people."
Douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to
the beast-people community, which considers Dr.Moreau their maker. Using
shock-therapy and the Law, Dr.Moreau has long been able to keep his
beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who
are just too savage to be controlled.
THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU questions the ability of men playing god.
Dr.Moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free
from hate and violence...but the savage within every beast is not
something one can suppress for long. MOREAU has no doubt a very
interesting premise within its grasp. Even so, the production has failed
to make the most out of it. There are too many characters to put your
attention to and the worst thing is, the characters are not
"prioritized" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular
character is important, before they know it, he or she or it
perishes....rather ungloriously at times too.
Perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people,
especially Aissa (Balk), the most human of Moreau's creations. The two
very important characters, Montgomery and Dr.Moreau himself receive no
development at all and it is in this area that the script fails
miserably.
More screen time could have been used for character interaction and
development. I really would have liked it better if, say, they delved
more into Dr.Moreau's obsession, Montgomery's purpose in the story and
justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel. Maybe the nature
of the screenplay, which incidently, does not incorporate much action
sequences in the film, forced the filmmakers to  "cut a long story
short"  and make it more of an action film than anything else (it's
still summer, and movies have to be "marketable"). The special effects
too, are really nothing for anyone to shout about. At most, I would say
the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in PLANET
OF THE APES.
This H.G.Wells classic really has potential to be a good film.
Unfortunately, after 2 adaptations, they still could not decide on how
and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important
message which makes up the entire essence of the story. As a third
outing, THE ISLAND OF DR.MOREAU accomplishes little and is nothing more
than an inferior version of `THE PLANET OF THE APES'. 

The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
* Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
*** Pretty good, bring a friend.
**** Amazing, potent stuff.
***** Perfection. See it twice.

Review for Fight Club (1999)
FIGHT CLUB is Finchers third movie outing and with every film, he seems to
out-do himself in style and technical filming. In SEVEN, his dark shots sets
the standard for possibly one of the moodiest Hollywood film ever. In THE
GAME (with Michael Douglas and Sean Penn), Fincher continues his penchant
for technical mood only this time, blended with action sequences. With FIGHT
CLUB, he explores CGI and the impressive Virtual Camera (used to much
success in THE MATRIX) interlaced with his trademark stylized dark shots.
The story revolves first-perspective, around Jack (Norton), who has been
suffering insomnia for quite some time. In his desperate state to solve this
problem which is affecting his career and social life, he enrols into
various support-groups. The problem is, the support groups do not support
directly his problem; he involves himself in groups supporting
testicular-cancer, AIDS and many others. Somehow, the talking and the crying
involved in the groups helped him to sleep well at night. Before long, they
became his addiction; attending them everyday after work. However, the
effect disappeared when he discovers another person, Marla Singer (Carter),
who attends all these groups as well, apparently with similar intentions.
He befriends Tyler Durden (Pitt) during one of his business trips and
unknowingly makes a friends who will change his life forever. Tyler is into
soap making, well at least thats one of his weird forte. Jacks life takes
a turn when Tyler asks him to punch him. From then on, they meet up
regularly, and well, just simply punch each others guts out. Soon, they
develop a following and when they group became too big to just hold a
slugfest in the open, they decide to take it underground. Thus FIGHT CLUB is
created. The first rule of fight club is : you dont tell anyone about FIGHT
CLUB, second rule of fight club is : you dont tell anyone about FIGHT CLUB,
third rule of fight club is : you dont tell anyone about FIGHT CLUB
FIGHT CLUB is simply so bizarre, its hard to believe that audience can
actually immerse so easily in it. Its pure fun. Brutal..but fun. Superb
acting from Norton (fresh from AMERICAN HISTORY X) and Pitt. Norton once
again demonstrates his acting versatility, from buff (AMERICAN HISTORY X) to
geek in FIGHT CLUB. Pitts neurotic Tyler really scared the shit out of me
but still, very adorable. Meat Loafs lactating bodybuilder role is
unforgettable. Fincher does it yet again, you just cant imagine another
director doing this movie any better.
FIGHT CLUB is fresh, funny and brutal. A definite must-see for all!

Title
Review for Three Kings (1999)
At first glance, THREE KINGS looks to be just another war movie, the 90s
version of all those favourite war movies with names I cannot remember. The
90s version, it definitely is, just another war movie? Not in your dreams!
Imagine PULP FICTION approach to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, thats THREE KINGS for
you. Believe it or not, it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane
meaning of the latter.
The story brings us to the twilight of the Gulf war, with the allied troops
victorious. Majpr Archie Gates (Clooney) leads an enterprising bunch of
grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree; the millions in gold
bars secretly stowed away by Saddam in a desolate village in the desert. As
the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be
shipped home, this `wild bunch goes AWOL on an armed Hum-Vee (the vehicle
of choice of the US army). They soon find out that they have much
resistance, as they get tangled with the local rebellion against Saddams
forces. Frequently switching their modes between looters and Robin Hoods
Merry Men, they become consciously attacked by their own morals.
As the film begins to roll, it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it.
`Special effects such as when Gates describes to his men how a bullet can
kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie. THREE
KINGS is much smarter than that. As the conflict becomes more and more
complex, the audience will be trapped in a limbo, trying to stay focussed on
that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray. I personally
found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in
the film; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own
sense of humanity. This simply made the entire experience of watching THREE
KINGS truly brilliant.
Action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything
like Steven Spielbergs in-your-face war violence. They are carefully built
to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses, right
before the action starts. Not John Woo for sure but more of Sergio Leones
Spaghetti western style (tons of them starring Clint Eastwood). Great
performances by Clooney and Wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the
conception of this film; the screenwriter and the director.
THREE KINGS ranks among the best films of the year, well, for me at least.
Highly recommended.

THE MAKERS OF JURASSIC PARK & THE DIRECTOR OF SPEED CONJURE UP A STORM!
(Reviewed at Eng Wah's new Jubilee Cineplex at Ang Mo Kio)
"Unlike earthquakes, their fury is precise. Unlike hurricanes, their
reach is unlimited. Unlike fires, there is no way to combat them.
Unlike floods, their terror is sudden." - excerpt from TWISTER
production notes
I'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen
tornadoes (or twisters) before. I for one, have only seen the
devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on TV
and personally, I feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near
the destruction caused by hurricanes and
earthquakes........that is until I saw TWISTER. The destruction caused
by twisters may be precise (not widespread but it moves very fast and
its path of destruction is unpredictable. It will suck in cars,
houses, livestock, etc..... basically anything in its path that is not
firmly rooted to the ground and in TWISTER, you'll get to see all this
- close up!
TWISTER tells a tale about a group of Storm Chasers. These people are
basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on
twister-occurrences, they risk their lives by literally chasing
tornadoes, trying to get as close as they can.....that is if the
tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them! Jo
(Helen Hunt) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes. While they are
gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite
recon, Bill (Bill Paxton), a former co- leader of the team returns to
settle some divorce papers with Jo. Apparently, Bill has left his
rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a
television weatherman. He catches up with his old-self and follows the
pack like the good ole days, bringing his wife-to-be Melissa (Jamie
Gertz) along, a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone. Jo has
finally implemented Bills initial idea of a device called Dorothy
which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on
how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system
can be implemented. The problem is, the device has to be placed very
near the twister, and in its path (which is practically unpredictable)
of destruction in order for it to function. To add to their current
challenge, there is another group of Storm Chasers that is
corporation-funded led by Jonas (Cary Elwes) and they too have a
similar device. Thus begins the race; Jo's cheap government equipment
with beaten-up vehicles against Jonas's high-tech computers and
satellite link-ups with their sleek, black all-terrain vans.
Plot wise, there are not really anything to shout about. TWISTER is as
predictable as any summer box-office hit can get. There is the danger
of the twister, the competition with Jonas^Os more well-off team and
of course, the settling of differences between Jo and Bill (this part
gives the film its human substance). Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton and the
rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of
them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister
itself! Thanks to the impressive digital effects by ILM (Lucasfilm's
Industrial Light and Magic), we get to see the terror and destruction
caused by tornadoes up close; from stripping barns and houses to
lifting up livestock!
Jan de Bont once again proves his visual abiility (thanks to
his years of experience as a director of photography for action films)
for action sequences. Like his previous film SPEED, the tornado
sequences (which are essentially THE action sequences) are well
visualised and edited. Audiences will be holding tight to their chairs
everytime a tornado comes on screen! The surround sound effects sure
does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister! (The cinema must
at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this)
TWISTER is definitely an effect-dependent movie.
Now that ID4 fever has begun to reside, and people are getting bored
of watching Will Smith whoop ET's ass for the umpteenth
time......TWISTER is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent! Watch it in
a good theatre...please.
