Title
Review for Rookie, The (1990)
     This film contains the obvious: Clint Eastwood as the veteran
police officer that never does anything by the rule book, and Martin
Sheen as the clean-cut rookie that has an excellent record and has just
been transferred to the grand-theft-auto division of the police
department despite his father's wish for him to be a businessman.
(Sheen has college degrees.)  Eastwood's partner has just been killed
(where have we seen this before?)  and Sheen is the new one.  
     A famous car smuggler just happened to fall into Eastwood's lap,
and he is going to crack the case no matter what--even though his boss
has told him not to interfere with the case anymore.  The dynamic duo go
through incredible measures to catch the criminal on unbelievable terms.
     Nothing seems a shock in this movie; the plot is not a good
one--anyone could tell you what was to happen next.  
     The special effects are mediocre; the best bit is the two
superheroes escape from the second story of a building that has been
rigged and is about to explode.  Yet when the smuggler and his girl are
caught, and are both shot in the forehead, no blood appears.  How
unreal.  Action scenes are filmed with a new technique--the subjects can
barely be seen because of the blur of the constant moving of the camera.
     The cheesey ending told me that I should not have relied on the
good names of the stars.  Eastwood and Sheen are great actors; they
were dealt horrible roles.  No actor/ress could have pulled off this
movie with success.
cjw rating system:
     Great movie, I would pay $6.00 to see it again.
     It was O.K., I would only pay the $2.50 to rent the video to see it again.
     It was not too good, but would watch it again if someone else paid.
     It sucked, and do not want to see it again under any conditions.
