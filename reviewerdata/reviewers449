Title
Review for Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997)
Crazy guy wants money AND revenge, (hey, it's the '90s; you CAN have it
all).  Decides to rip-off diamonds from a floating jewel show on a
cruise ship.  Hapless, unengaging but spunky characters are put at
risk.  Lame performances.  Crappy effects.
A poor knowledge of physics (watch the oil tanker explode like an atomic
bomb!)
This is the kind of movie that Chuck Norris would have made 15 years
ago, except there would be two dozen bad guys and plenty more
excitement.  
The leads are bad, but the supporting characters are worse.  You will
find yourself not caring what becomes of them.  If you absolutely must
see a movie with bad actors having misadventures on an ill-fated ship,
rent "The Posidieon Adventure."  At least the boat is upside down in
that one.
