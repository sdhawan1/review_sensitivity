Title
Review for Whistle Down the Wind (1961)
After being snapped up by Disney for the role of Pollyanna in her
second film, Hayley Mills returned to the girl-meets-convict theme of
her debut, TIGER BAY.  Twist is that she and her younger brother and
sister believe the mysterious arrival of a stranger (Alan Bates) in
their barn to be nothing less than the Second Coming.  Their active,
young imaginations, coupled with the rural isolation of the Northern
Country serve to make such a fanciful idea believably down-to-earth.
Hayley and her siblings (Diane Holgate and Alan Barnes, who give
effortless, "real" performances), who know little about Christ,
ironically develop faith and a sense of responsibility as soon as they
'meet' him.
Film speaks volumes about the way children rearrange facts to fit in
with their own interpretation of the world.  Their straightforward
reasoning has no time for awkward questions (e.g., they bring 'Christ'
bread and wine because "that's what he eats").  But who can blame their
approach when their token religious instruction is just as vague?  When
one of the children worries about his kitten, his Sunday school teacher
unhelpfully remarks that 'Jesus will look after it';  when Mills tries
to get a straight answer about Christ from the local priest he uses it
as an excuse to complain about vandalism.  Appropriately, the convict
(he has a name, as published by the police, but is referred to only as
"The Man" in the closing credits) responds to the children with equal
simplicity.  He rarely speaks a sentence more than a few words long.
Bates remains reticent throughout the story - we can never be sure of
his intentions.  He neither 'reforms' from contact with the children,
nor betrays them to use them as some kind of leverage when things start
looking bad.
Although the children find 'Jesus' in a barn, and then skip away to the
accompaniment of a Christmas carol, we are otherwise spared any coy
allegorical commentary.  Film is charming, not pretentious.  It is so
gentle that even a slap across the face stands out as a violent
moment.  Mills and the other children will completely win you over -
you'll remember the touching final moment.  Bryan Forbes directed from
a story by Mary Hayley Bell (Hayley's mother).  Composer Malcolm Arnold
arranged the cheerful score.  Title refers to a hawking expression,
more commonly known in its figurative sense of abandoning a person or
thing.

Review for Ultimo uomo della Terra, L' (1964)
George Romero's knockout zombie film NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD may have 
influenced many imitators from the late 60s on, but if you dig a little 
further back you'll find it had roots of its own in this AIP adaptation of 
Richard Matheson's novel 'I am Legend'.  Vincent Price (who had already 
starred in half a dozen previous Matheson scripts) plays Robert Morgan, a 
scientist eking out a lonely existence in a world devastated by plague.  The 
screenplay divides neatly into thirds: the first act looks at Price's daily 
routine, the second is a flashback tracing the antecedents of the 
apocalypse, and the third is a mini-drama contained within itself, with new 
characters and plot turns.
As it turned out, Matheson, who co-scripted the screenplay, disliked the 
finished result so much that he credited himself with a pseudonym.  It's 
hard to tell what he may have been disappointed with but it could have been 
that THE LAST MAN ON EARTH isn't sufficiently scary.  This is easier to take 
in retrospect because contemporary audiences don't expect old 
modestly-budgeted AIP productions to scare them anyhow.  As far as horror is 
concerned, the film is let down by Sidney Salkow's lethargic direction of 
its monsters: the ghouls that surround Price's house, moaning his name and 
pounding ineffectually against the walls are strikingly redolent of the 
zombies from LIVING DEAD but far less frightening.  It was a mistake of the 
film-makers to show Price - no he-man himself - pushing away marauders early 
on in the story (one potentially scary scene, when Price realises he has 
dozed off until the sunset, is otherwise spoiled); only much later in the 
film do we hear him explain that he doesn't really fear them due to their 
limited mental and physical state.  Their slow, dazed state also pushes 
aside the vampire theme in the novel, which is treated sporadically here.  
Mirrors, garlic, and zombies?  It doesn't quite add up.
Monsters aside, LAST MAN ON EARTH is worthy of attention from horror buffs.  
Instead of frights it offers a somber look at an entropic world.  Life after 
the apocalypse isn't scary or exciting, just dull: Price performs daily 
rituals perfunctorily; the only time we see him listening to music is when 
he is drowning out the sound of the ghouls outside; his cars of choice are 
black, hearse-like stationwagons; his stooped figure wandering outdoors in 
bright, harsh sunlight becomes no more than a dried husk moving about in a 
lifeless world (even his name, Morgan, connotes death).  In this film we 
start at the end and are then nudged along to the very end - there's one 
nice touch in a flashback when Price realises that the disease is airborne 
and the camera cuts to dead autumn leaves blowing in the wind.   Price's 
saturnine persona works well in this film - he can see there's no point 
being hammy this time around - which makes the story's dramatic punctuations 
more effective (the bodies being consigned to the pit remind us disturbingly 
of the Holocaust).  The film's low budget arguably works in its favor, too.  
We're not presented with city-wide panic, hysterical crowds, riots, or 
looting.  Budgetary constraints limit our experience of the plague to a 
newspaper clipping, a few military trucks, and a growing detachment with 
friends and colleagues.   The whole planet is just slowly winding down.  THE 
LAST MAN ON EARTH is undeniably as much mood as it is concept, but its final 
line of dialogue does make the theme of the novel more patent: if there is 
one human living in a world of vampires, which becomes the monster?  This 
gives one brief scene of Price attacking a young female ghoul - who cowers 
on a bed in fright - more weight than you may first think.

Title
Review for Beguiled, The (1971)
A chamber piece of Southern Gothic by director Don Siegel.  It marks an 
intersection point between his films with Clint Eastwood and his 
made-for-television horror movies.  It's also interesting to note that even 
though Westerns dominated Eastwood's screen persona for many years, he and 
Siegel only ever made one such film together.  That aside, some Western 
motif would  usually work its way in to the Siegel-Eastwood productions: in 
COOGAN'S BLUFF Eastwood wears a cowboy hat; in DIRTY HARRY he is the 
modern-day equivalent of a marshal determined to clean up his town.  THE 
BEGUILED also has the feel of a Western to it: there are armed horsemen, 
shootouts, a feeling of lawlessness, and an opening montage of sepia 
photographs titled in the lettering we associate with Wells Fargo, saloons, 
and wanted posters (in this film Eastwood is a 'wanted' man in more ways 
than one).
THE BEGUILED is set during the last days of the Civil War.  Eastwood plays 
against type as a disheveled Union soldier hiding from rebel patrols.  He 
makes his way to the remnants of a girls' school which harbors a few 
students, two teachers and a servant, all female.  The severity of his 
wounds confine Eastwood to a bed and crutches for practically the entire 
film; despite this he tries to exercise some control over his environment.  
Eastwood is obliging, assured, and laconic, as we would expect him to be, 
but none of his screen adversaries to date could have prepared him for the 
trouble he has in store.  The school is a powderkeg of repression: he 
attracts the interest of a woman with an incestuous past, a sexually active 
teen flirt, a 12-year old with an irrational crush, and an inexperienced 
young woman who yearns for true love.  Crippled by his injuries and unable 
to leave the school, Eastwood begins playing one off against the other, 
delivering all sorts of false promises.  We're used to Eastwood playing a 
hero, so we accept his casual words and silky delivery without really 
questioning it.  He is, after all, a wounded enemy soldier doing what he can 
to stay alive.  But soon it becomes apparent that we don't know if Eastwood 
is capable of ever speaking the truth, even with the most incidental of 
remarks.
Despite the obvious sexual politicking going on in the film I don't see 
Eastwood's character as being misogynistic so much as opportunistic.  He 
turns brutish only after he gets drunk one time, and then becomes apologetic 
soon after.  By this time, however, we've become so accustomed to his 
convincing 'sincerity' that it's too late for him to earn any further 
credibility with either us or the rest of the characters in the film.  The 
story's ending isn't exactly problematic - it's almost a foregone conclusion 
- but while we don't feel sorry for what happens to Eastwood, we don't feel 
satisfied either.  It's this ambivalence, and the fact that Eastwood doesn't 
play an action hero, that caused cinema audiences to pass this by upon first 
release.  Siegel's direction and Bruce Surtees' lighting (diffused and 
pretty outside, unobtrusive and dim inside) make this look like a Hammer 
horror movie - that's probably to prepare you for one scene, late in the 
film, that will make your toes curl.  I like to imagine the odd goings-on in 
this house taking place just down the road apiece from an oblivious Scarlett 
O'Hara who is meanwhile preoccupied with her own romantic problems.  Maybe 
she should have dropped in on Eastwood, too.

Title
Review for Shining, The (1980)
How could any movie live up to a publicity campaign that culminated with 
full-page newspaper ads in the Southern Hemisphere blaring 'The tide of 
terror that swept the world is here'?  Stanley Kubrick's only horror film, 
an adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller, was a disappointment for 
first-time audiences who were expecting to be scared out of their wits, but 
grew to be a more rewarding film for repeat viewers.  The film begins with 
caretaker Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and 
son Danny (Danny Lloyd) moving into a Colorado Hotel which is closed and 
inaccessible during the Winter - Jack figures he can use the months of 
isolation to work on a novel.  The film ends with Jack running amok with an 
ax, howling for his family's blood.  What happens in between?  That's THE 
SHINING's main controversy.  The other area of controversy, at least for 
those Kubrick fans who had been weaned on the philosophical/ideological 
complexities of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, was that THE 
SHINING was too simple - it just seemed to be a ghost story about a man who 
went nuts in a Hotel, so what was the big deal?
After initial mixed feelings about the film, King joined its critics, 
finally agreeing to say nothing further  in exchange for the rights to 
produce his own television version.  In King, the cause of Jack's switch 
from father to murderer is clear-cut: he and his son are telepathically 
sensitive to a host of evil spirits that haunt the Hotel.  In Kubrick, it's 
much murkier.  He sets up a number of horror-movie motifs and then brushes 
over them - clairvoyance, ax murders, ghosts, a pact with the devil, 
insanity, animated corpses, ghosts, and reincarnation (to cap it off, he has 
the family move into the Hotel on Halloween).  Every supernatural event can 
be explained rationally - here the telepathy becomes a conduit not for 
entities but hallucinations.   Kubrick offers many other alternatives for 
Jack's madness - the isolation, his frustration as a writer, the cabin fever 
that has him trapped in the Hotel, his alcoholic past.  Is Jack conjuring up 
his own demons?  Has the Hotel become a sort of magnifying lens that expands 
hallucinatory images and passes them on in a form of autosuggestion to 
everyone else staying there?  We can't trust any image that we see as real, 
although as viewers we are too caught up in events to give this much 
thought.  It's only afterwards when you might work out the only piece of the 
puzzle that doesn't make sense -  that if this was all happening in the 
characters' minds, then who let Jack out of the room he was locked in?
THE SHINING is a horror film to admire for its atmosphere, not its frights, 
although many fans enjoy it for Nicholson's pumped-up performance.  It's 
hard to tell what may have attracted Kubrick to a mainstream horror novel, 
but I suspect it was the setting that clinched it.  In THE SHINING the idea 
of the haunted house is turned completely inside out.  Gone are the dark 
corridors, the narrow staircases, musty attics, dank cellars and scary woods 
outside.  Instead the Hotel is immaculate, huge, and illuminated, surrounded 
by empty white wildnerness.  There is barely a shadow to be seen.  At the 
one point in the film when a character (Danny) enters darkness it is treated 
not as a place to be feared but as an area of refuge, only to have it become 
lit up with floodlights.  John Alcott's cinematography and Kubrick's precise 
camerawork make THE SHINING a visual treat - which is quite something when 
you consider that it is shot mostly indoors.  There is some great 
floor-level Steadicam tracking that follows Danny as he cycles through the 
hallways and a memorable cutaway shot of Jack staring at the Hotel maze, 
which is worth the price of admission alone.
In discussion THE SHINING is often companioned with 2001 (and not just 
because they share the same running times and a four-act structure).  It's 
an intriguing comparison - inner space versus outer space.  If the Star 
Child at the conclusion of 2001 was meant to signal an evolved consciousness 
of humanity then it's easy to see THE SHINING's clairvoyant child, Danny, as 
being its flesh and blood incarnation.  The Hotel is his new, mysterious 
universe; an arena in which he may flex his fledging powers.  Meanwhile 
Jack, who regresses to a grunting, animalistic state by the film's 
conclusion, returns full circle to 2001's apes.  In both films we see points 
of evolution represented not only by characters but also by the weapons they 
use (in THE SHINING it progresses from club to knife to ax).  There is also 
an obvious metaphysical link between both films -  Kubrick likes to show us 
that time and space are connected.  The psychological pathways of Jack's 
mind literally become a labyrinth by the film's end, in which he becomes 
hopelessly lost.
The Hotel itself is also a maze, cosmic or otherwise - the Steadicam's 
lengthy, fluid negotiations of its corridors serve not to map the layout of 
the Hotel but to disorient us.  Even Wendy, when first entering the Hotel, 
remarks that she will have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs to find her way 
around, a la Hansel and Gretel (another story which features a father 
instructed to kill his children with an ax).  In short, the Hotel is unfixed 
in space and time (the intertitles that announce the days, date and time 
don't do anything to make the experience more concrete for us).  The past 
and the present are an overlapping confusion, muddied further by Danny's 
precognitive flashes into the future.  The Hotel itself cannot be discounted 
as a major character of THE SHINING.  Even though it may be unfixed it can 
still occupy what Jung called an objective psyche, a place where biology and 
psychology might mingle with and influence each other.  The Hotel is a 
living entity (blood gushes from its elevators like burst arteries), 
thinking, imagining, creating images of humans to act out endless games for 
its amusement (the 1927 photograph at the end of the film would suggest as 
much).  The forces of creation and destruction are in constant conflict.  
Small wonder that Jack, as a character in this staged entertainment, is 
unable to write a novel himself.
I'm impressed with THE SHINING and always look forward to repeat viewings 
every five years or so(only in cinemas, mind you) that give me the chance to 
re-evaluate my prior discoveries about the film and make new ones.  The 
beauty of Kubrick's film is that despite its many layers it can still be 
enjoyed at the most basic level of a simple horror yarn.  But don't be 
surprised if something sneaks into your subconscious and stays with you for 
some time afterwards.  It may have even happened to Stephen King.

Review for Gawain and the Green Knight (1973)
Gawain and the Green Knight (1973) 93m.
You'll have to be in the right mood to enjoy this simple mediaeval fantasy, 
or at least acknowledge that it subdues the cinematic visual stylings we 
might expect from knights-on-horseback adventures.  Although the poem, 'Sir 
Gawain and the Green Knight', is one of the best known British mediaeval 
epics outside of Beowulf, its central character is less a household name 
than other Arthurian champions such as Lancelot, Galahad, and Bedevere.   
Personally, I find this down-scaled approach more suitable for Gawain's tale 
than the kind of treatment usually afforded the aggrandized romances of his 
better-known contemporaries.  Gawain is an ordinary man, not some superhero 
- when he gets in a fight he gets beaten up quite a bit, and has to struggle 
for the upper hand.  The film opens with the mysterious Knight (played, 
appropriately enough, by Nigel Green) appearing before Arthur's court in the 
New Year and demanding the head of Gawain (played, appropriately enough, by 
Murray Head) as the prize in a bizarre game.  Given a year's grace, Gawain 
immediately sets off in search of the Knight for a rematch.
Bearing only a passing resemblance to the epic poem (which is more a test of 
Gawain's character), Stephen Weeks' film is an amalgam of two standard 
motifs, the Quest and Damsel-in-Distress.  Its indecisive narrative may 
cause some viewers to give up before the story is half over, but in an odd 
way it adds to the atmosphere of the picture.  It seems as if Gawain is 
getting nowhere on his journey - he is sidetracked constantly and has no 
clear idea of where he is heading.  We can never be sure where he is or 
where different places are in relation to each other.  Characters keep 
dropping out of the story and then returning, further suggesting that Gawain 
is making little progress.  The course of the journey is plotted 
chronologically (the passing of the seasons), not geographically.  The 
inconclusive musical score sounds like it was recorded without any visual 
cues from the film and dropped in just anywhere.  All of these things make 
Gawain's experiences seem like a dream, but his final revelation shows us 
that his journey was never intended to take place on land, but instead 
through time.  The passage of his maturation over one year gives added 
significance to the colour green (not only marking the order of the natural 
world, but also his inexperience and youth) that appears throughout the 
story at crucial points to guide him onwards - note that director Weeks is 
otherwise careful to avoid using green in all sets, costumes, backdrops and 
props.
Weeks' own disastrous 1982 remake, SWORD OF THE VALIANT, only makes this 
simple version look better by comparison.  Since he didn't really stick to 
the specifics of the poem in the first place (with the exception of the 
opening scene), you have to wonder why he even tried a second time.

Title
Review for Matinee (1993)
Joe Dante's most personal film is also one of his best.  After a hilarious 
opening sequence featuring a direct copy of the cinema promos made by 
director-producer William Castle in the late 50s/early 60s, Dante settles 
into areas of childhood nostalgia that's only been hinted at in his previous 
work.  He's a good choice of director for this project: it's plain to see 
that he has always loved movies (his films have more movie in-jokes than any 
other director I can think of) and he was lucky enough to see Castle films 
with the gimmicks 'Emergo' (HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL), 'Percepto' (THE TINGLER) 
and 'Illusion-O' (13 GHOSTS) when he was an impressionable young movie buff.
MATINEE is set in Florida during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and begins 
when teenager Gene (Simon Fenton) witnesses two sober warnings about atomic 
weapons.  The first is from movie producer Lawrence Woolsey (John Goodman) 
in a Saturday matinee trailer, the second is from John F. Kennedy on live 
television.  One is obviously far-fetched, the other deadly serious, but 
what's a boy to think?  Appropriately, Gene's younger brother believes in 
both.   The reality/unreality of these two scenarios reaches a middle ground 
during Gene's third warning, when he is told that his school's nuclear 
attack drill (ever seen those old 'Duck and Cover' educational films?) is a 
sham.  It's just the right climate for Woolsey's new monster movie, and he 
duly arrives in town with his entourage in tow, for who can separate the 
current real-life nuclear horrors from his skilfully orchestrated ones?  
Woolsey's horror show boasts a barrage of audience-participation effects, 
and by the end not even the adults (including theater owner Robert Picardo) 
can differentiate between the gimmicks and the apocalypse.
Dante's agenda with this film  is clear: he wants to show what going to the 
movies *really* used to be like before the shopping malls and the cineplexes 
took over.   Fittingly, MATINEE's  second half is set in and around the 
cinema, cross-cutting between the monster movie (itself a very funny spoof 
of 50s nuclear-mutant horror flicks) and the action behind the scenes.  
Charles Haas' clever script ties up this package so neatly that you'll reach 
the final credits feeling completely satisfied - it even manages to include 
what surely must have been every teenage boy's fantasy during the Cold War, 
i.e. the prospect of being trapped for months in a fallout shelter with a 
would-be girlfriend.  Unfortunately, the script falters during a hackneyed 
'child-in-peril' climax, which is dispensed with so briefly that there's 
almost no justification for its inclusion.  It's a bad move for two reasons: 
firstly, it is the sort of thing you'd expect to find in a kid's movie, 
which MATINEE is not; secondly, it introduces a false note of real danger - 
the underlying theme of MATINEE is to watch how our minds surrender 
voluntarily or instinctively to larger-than-life fears.  Contrast this scene 
to the film's understated final shot, which hints at the war in Vietnam and 
conveys realistic menace a lot more effectively.  What's great about MATINEE 
is how it introduces fantastic elements to an ordinary setting and weaves 
them so invisibly into the story, so it's ironic that the only 'real' 
dangerous moment in the film is also its only unrealistic one.
The era celebrated in this film happened before my time, but I still have 
enough memories of my own journeys to the local cinema (whether it was to 
see old prints of Tarzan or Ray Harryhausen films) to recognize that for a 
while there was a golden age of movie-going for young audiences.  The 
Saturday matinees were full of kids who were only half-interested in the 
show; foodstuffs were routinely thrown; and cheers sometimes punctuated the 
action on screen.  If only I'd seen a skeleton sliding on a wire or been 
given electric shocks in my seat - my childhood would have been made 
complete.   For now, like many other viewers, I'll have to make do with 
Dante's own affectionate, good-humored memoir.

Review for Monolith Monsters, The (1957)
The only movie about killer rocks you'll ever see.  It's hard to believe 
such a story pitch was ever greenlighted, and just as unbelievable to 
see that it actually works.  Concept is similar to that of J.G. 
Ballard's creepy novel 'The Crystal World', and execution follows the 
pattern of other more well-known genre films of the time: it has an 
ominous opening narration (usually a prerequisite for these films); a 
desert setting (always popular, since this gives the monster more time 
to roam about killing wayfarers before it reaches the already-alerted 
community nearby); a hero who works for the government with some 
military/scientific background; his girlfriend (subject for possible 
paper: Why are the leading couples never married in 1950s SF/horror 
films?); a quasi-scientific rationale for the monster's creation; and a 
race against time to find a means of defeating the invading creature.  
Where it differs most dramatically is the choice of monster.  It falls 
back on that SF staple, the silicon-based lifeform - if it is a 
lifeform.  The monoliths of the title are spires of obsidian, neither 
living nor dead.  Their only means of movement is to grow into spindly 
obelisks which then splinter and topple forward.  This is one of the few 
monster movies you'll see where you feel nothing whatsoever towards the 
monster (e.g. pity, revulsion, admiration, fear), but perversely it is 
this complete lack of connection that makes the monsters more 
threatening - they are truly alien.
Film manages to maintain interest despite sticking to formula - the 
effects are good (and original); the dialogue isn't embarrassing 
(there's only one silly line, when hero Grant Williams remarks "You're 
absolutely right, it's ridiculous - but that's what they said about the 
wheel when someone first thought of it."); and the time element is used 
effectively to convey a sense of menace.  My favorite moment is when 
Williams and his colleague are alone in a workshop trying to determine 
the cause of the rocks' growth, unaware that it is starting on a major 
scale all around them.  It's too bad the film didn't work more of these 
ironies into the story - for example, the fact that the technology 
they're using to find a way to defeat the monsters is all mineral-based 
(at one point an early victim is kept alive for a while in an iron 
lung!).  The science is just as specious here as in other genre pics, 
but at least this time around it sounds convincing.  Pretty much 
overlooked, but just as deserving of attention as some of those other SF 
'classics' that were around at the time.


Title
Review for Therese und Isabell (1968)
Don't let it worry you that this film draws sniggers from gay audiences 
who are used to a more up-front, in-your-face style of contemporary 
cinema.  Radley Metzger's film of two girls who fall in love is one of 
his best efforts - more interesting than the dull CAMILLE 2000 and less 
'arty' than THE LICKERISH QUARTET (which takes this film's commingling 
of past/present to extremes).  It's also interesting to look back on now 
in light of the path that Metzger's career took - as the times became 
more permissive he eventually settled into making hardcore porn.
Therese (Anna Gael) visits the now-empty finishing school she attended 
as a young girl.  Her travels around the grounds and through the dorms 
remind her of Isabelle (Barbara Laage), her only true friend there.  The 
glances that Therese and Isabelle give each other suggest early on that 
they are  attracted to each other romantically - eventually they will 
become lovers.  Film has all the ingredients of prime exploitation - 
French schoolgirls, a sexually repressive atmosphere, forbidden love - 
yet vies for decorum.  The scene in which the two girls rent a room for 
a chance to be alone is particularly well handled.  Elegantly shot in 
widescreen black and white, and set in beautiful (natural and 
architectural) locations, THERESE AND ISABELLE is something of an 
oddity.  Certainly there were few films of this type intended for 
legitimate theatrical distribution in the late 60s (it would be only a 
couple of years later that nudity and sex would suddenly run rampant in 
commercial cinema).  The inclusion of scenes involving masturbation and 
oral sex are particularly daring - although Metzger would have fared 
better if he had left out the purple prose dubbed over them, as what 
reads erotically on the printed page doesn't always translate well on 
screen.  As in CLAIRE'S KNEE, you may find the most erotic moment of 
this film one of the most simple: Isabelle recites a poem while Therese 
strokes her lightly with her fingertips.  THERESE AND ISABELLE isn't a 
great movie, but it is much better than it could have been, and provides 
a useful addition to other more widely-discussed entries in cinema's 
ongoing 'Is it Art or Exploitation?' debate.  
There isn't a lot of sexual/romantic chemistry between Gael and Laage 
(the casting of older actresses to play schoolgirls is almost a 
necessary flaw - Metzger would have been condemned if he'd used real 
teenagers) and consequently the ending of the film isn't as sad as it 
should be.  I don't see that it hurts the story - as it is framed within 
Therese's reminiscences it is more appropriately wistful.  This is part 
and parcel of the 'European' feel that Metzger was aiming for.  It may 
be too demure or affected for modern audiences,  but the type of 
contemporary gay cinema that assertively draws attention to sexuality 
isn't necessarily progressive - it's just reactionary.  THERESE AND 
ISABELLE is not driven by sexual politics; it is simply a love story.  
The fact that the two lovers are female is inconsequential, for gay 
audiences or otherwise.

Review for Last Voyage, The (1960)
Gripping production by veteran writer-director Andrew L. Stone.  A
luxury liner takes in water and slowly sinks during an ocean cruise. 
Disaster-movie convention would have us expect the usual mob panic,
cross-section of characters, and sweaty, tight-jawed troubleshooters. 
But Stone has seen all this before: instead, the calamity of the
shipwreck is focused into one event - a passenger (Dorothy Malone) has
her leg trapped under wreckage in her cabin.  Throughout the film we
watch, with mounting tension, as her husband (Robert Stack) tries to
save her and their child (Tammy Marihugh, well directed in her role). 
It's a nifty twist on a familiar theme that only one passenger on a
sinking ocean liner should be in any danger, but Stone wrings it for
all it is worth.  Ultimately the emotive scale of a disaster can still
be measured with just one human life.  You'll empathize with Stack as
he struggles with a cumbersome oxygen tank, knowing that he is asking
the impossible of himself to save his wife.  As her death - i.e., her
`last voyage' -  becomes imminent, the story shifts attention to the
survival of Stack and Marihugh, who are too distraught to leave her. 
At which point do the living acknowledge responsibility to continue on
for the sake of the dying?  
We don't have much time to dwell on this dilemma because Stone keeps
events moving. Story is told from two perspectives, that of the family
and those of the chief crew.  George Sanders has played enough cads in
his time to make us assume his Captain qualifies is the `villain' of
the piece.  But he really makes only one bad decision - he's willing
to enlist the advice and skills of his crew and do everything he can
to keep his passengers safe from that point on.  Stone's direction is
unhurried and functions without sensation - the flooding interiors of
the ship are entirely believable, and the sinking of the ship is done
with slow, steady, technical precision.  Note also the use of natural
sounds to heighten atmosphere - there's barely a note of music played.
 Only bad call is John Houseman's portentous voice-overs that appear
every time we see the ship in long-shot.  Presumably this was added to
remind us that the liner was indeed sinking.

Review for San daikaijű: Chikyu saidai no kessen (1964)
Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster (1966) m. 
If you've never seen any of the monster movies made in Japan by the Toho 
studios during the 50s and 60s, then you might as well jump off the deep 
end with this offering by Ishirio Honda, their most popular director.  
You won't believe what you're seeing.  Ghidrah is a hydra-like creature 
that breathes lightning and decides to wreak havoc on Japan 
because...well, he's a monster.  In the meantime, and because six heads 
are better than three, old favorites Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra (all 
from previous films in the series) also join in the fray, although this 
time around their scenery-chewing - all bug-eyed expressions and 
double-takes - easily exceeds their usual scenery-stamping.  
I won't recount the plot (believe me, it's better this way) except to 
point out that it is worth waiting through the disjointed first half, 
which jumps between different story elements and concentrates more on 
the human actors than the monsters, to get to the hysterical combat 
scenes in the second half (Godzilla keeps screeching throughout the 
chaos like an enraged dolphin!).  Like other films in the series, 
GHIDRAH's characters are predominantly scientists or journalists (and 
there's usually a ship's captain that gets done in fairly early).  The 
'scientific' dialogue is just as nonsensical here as in other Toho 
films, and is made even sillier by the cartoon-character voices that the 
actors have had dubbed over them.  By the time GHIDRAH was being made it 
was pretty obvious that the studios were targeting kids as a major part 
of their audience - at least that seems to be the case in the 
English-language versions.  It's pretty hard to mesh the juvenile 
elements of the production with the busy plot, which cuts between a 
princess who appears to be have been abducted by aliens, scientists 
exploring a volcano, a group of assassins, and a comeback tour for 
Mothra's tiny priestesses - but all of this is forgotten as soon as the 
monsters meet in the no-holds-barred finale.
The most noteworthy aspect of GHIDRAH, however, is that it marked the 
point where Godzilla stopped being a monster and became a hero.  
Godzilla, who once represented the destructive force of the atomic bomb, 
sheds his image of fear and vengeance and instead becomes a figure to 
whom the Japanese turn for protection.  This has obvious parallels with 
the way that Japan's economy went into turnaround after  WWII and set 
the country on the way to becoming an influential world power.  Ten 
years after Godzilla's first appearance it no longer became necessary 
for him to replay the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  By the 
time GHIDRAH came along the Toho studios wore their monster with pride: 
Japan was back in world politics with a vengeance.  GHIDRAH is also a 
lot of fun.  This may be the best fight between four Japanese monsters 
I've ever seen.  It must surely win the prize for the most alternative 
titles - it was up to eleven the last time I looked.

Review for Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens (1979)
Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens (1979) 93m
If this manic, lurid, plotless sex romp had been the only thing ever made by 
writer-director-producer-editor Russ Meyer, it would no doubt have become an 
instant classic.  It still has, as far as its fans are concerned.  It turned 
out to be my introduction to Meyer, double-billed with SUPERVIXENS (talk 
about being thrown off the deep end) so I was able to enjoy it more than 
Meyer devotees who had already seen better films like MUDHONEY and FASTER, 
PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL!  Here's the story: a narrator (Stuart Lancaster) 
introduces us to diverse characters populating Small Town, USA, who spend 
the next hour and a half jumping into bed (and rivers, and bathtubs, et al) 
with each other.  Most of the 'action' revolves around sexually frustrated 
Ken Kerr and unsatisfied wife Kitten Natividad (Meyer's girlfriend at the 
time) getting it on with a variety of partners.
What makes Meyer's films unique among other skin flicks is his dexterity as 
a film-maker, most notably his energetic editing which inserts 
flash-forwards and cross-cutting to humorous effect.  His characters are 
larger than life - oversexed, fervent, bitchy, and (if they're female) 
astonishingly proportioned.  He fills his frame with hicks and white trash 
and then films them at tilted angles against bright cartoony colors.  When 
Meyer first attracted a following, movie buffs figured that he was too smart 
a talent to be involved with grindhouse material.  However when he strayed 
from the independent scene and worked on the studio projects FANNY HILL, THE 
SEVEN MINUTES and BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, the results fell short of 
expectations.  Meyer returned to indie adult fare, eventually calling it a 
day with BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE ULTRA VIXENS (even though a further 
'Vixens' episode was promised in the final credits).  To compare ULTRA 
VIXENS with a much earlier Meyer film, WILD GALS OF THE NAKED WEST, is to 
see a lack of stylistic development despite the gulf of years and 
experience.  Both are a series of lewd, comic vignettes filmed in the 
trademark Meyer fashion - the main difference is that ULTRA VIXENS is a lot 
more graphic.  Not only does Meyer up the ante on the sexual couplings but 
the breasts of the heroines are even bigger than in his previous films.  In 
his early days, Meyer was spoofing the genre; in ULTRA VIXENS he is spoofing 
himself (he even dubs in his own flatulence for the sex scenes!).  It's an 
amplification of everything that has gone before, but at least this time 
Meyer backs off from the rape and violence that was beginning to infuse his 
work (in BLACKSNAKE it had become so over-the-top it was more ludicrous than 
offensive).  In ULTRA-VIXENS the hot-tempered characters still have 
fistfights, but instead of blood they spill brightly colored paint.
Is ULTRA VIXENS worth seeing?  Yes: it is deliciously crude and well-made 
cinema.  But it's probably a good thing that Meyer quit when he did.  
There's a telling moment when he appears at the film's end, toting his 
camera about and wondering where his crew has gotten to.  Perhaps he knew he 
couldn't really top ULTRA VIXENS without descending straight into porn, 
which was fast becoming big business with the advent of home video 
technology.  Or maybe there's an even more insidious reason - with the 
proliferation of breast implants, every actress was becoming a potential 
Meyer performer, and the 'King of the Nudies' no doubt had too much of an 
eye for natural beauty to accept substitutes (the talents on display in the 
opening scene are highly suspect!).  In the meantime stacked women appeared 
in everything from teen comedies to music videos.  It wasn't censorship or 
economics that killed Russ Meyer.  It was silicone.


Title
Review for Anniversary, The (1968)
Even if you're not a Bette Davis fan you'll find her impossible to 
resist in this nasty, often hilarious comedy by director Roy Ward Baker.  
Davis is the matriarch of a family business who treats her three 
children more like board members than sons.  The boys (two of them with 
female partners) gather at the family home for their mother's ruby 
wedding anniversary (their father has since passed on, and Davis wears a 
bright red dress for the occasion).  They pledge that this year will be 
different.  Fat chance.
Film version of Bill MacIlwraith's play looks pretty much how it would 
in a theater - there are only two outdoor scenes and neither of them are 
essential.  Also, Baker elects not to use a background score.  Quite 
rightly, the rhythm comes from the sharp, snappy dialogue.  And Davis 
snaps with the best of them.  She gives a delicious performance as 'Mum'  
(almost every line she delivers is a put-down) and succeeds in making us 
admire a character who by rights we should view as monstrous.  What 
helps us from being put off the Davis character altogether is that we're 
not sure who to root for otherwise.  We want her sons (and their 
partners) to break free of their mother's control, but none of them seem 
deserving of our support.  They're either wishy-washy or petulant.  It's 
noteworthy that the only one we come to admire (Sheila Hancock) is just 
as sharp-tongued and strong-willed as Davis - her worthy foil.  As the 
film goes on, fiancee Elaine Taylor is ready to follow her example.  You 
have to question Davis' real opinions of her children: does she even 
love them at all?  I think it's more a case of maternal instinct in 
overdrive.  Consider, for example, if Davis had three daughters instead 
of sons.  I don't believe she'd be as possessive if she was in the 
position of welcoming another gender (sons-in-law) to the family home.  
As it is, the men in this film are tokens to be claimed and fought for - 
the only one exempt from this treatment is the most soft-spoken of the 
trio, who has a fetish that is decidedly effeminate.  In the end, it 
doesn't even concern us what real opinion Davis has of any of the others 
at her party - she so enjoys her Machiavellian power plays that it's 
easy enough for us to believe that she's simply acting that way for the 
sheer hell of it.  


Title
Review for Killer Shrews, The (1959)
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was a standout horror movie of its time, and the 
inspiration for its depiction of characters under siege could be attributed 
in turn to the finale of THE BIRDS, the novel 'I Am Legend', or even those 
Westerns in which characters find themselves fighting off hostiles while 
holed up in cavalry forts.  But ten years before Romero made his celebrated 
horror pic there was this low-budget B-picture, produced by one of its 
stars, Ken Curtis (who, interestingly, does not play the hero), which could 
also have served as inspiration had it been more widely known.  Curtis, who 
played Festus on the TV series GUNSMOKE, collaborated with one of the show's 
writers, Jay Simms, to bring THE KILLER SHREWS to the screen.  They'd 
obviously intended to try their hand at a horror film, but unfortunately, 
it's best known today for its supposed camp value.  The film's pre-credit 
voiceover is laughable, and the opening lines of dialogue not much better, 
but I don't think it deserves its much-maligned reputation.  After its shaky 
start it becomes a decent, economical piece of film-making.  Curtis' budget 
obviously failed to provide him with convincing monsters, but a realistic 
horde of vicious, oversized shrews would have been beyond the means of any 
studio in 1959.  The film-makers tried to get around this problem by 
switching between model heads (for close-ups) and dogs hidden under costumes 
(for long shots), and it's this presentation of the 'killer' shrews that 
earns the film ridicule from viewers today.  Personally, I don't see much 
difference between a dog in a costume or a man in a costume, and for that 
reason the shrews shouldn't come across any more hokey than the rubber suits 
of other 50s horror classics like THE THING or THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK 
LAGOON. 
The 'siege' element of the story is twofold: firstly, its seven characters 
are trapped on an island that is being used for an overpopulation experiment 
(shrews are being bred to the point of self-extinction), and secondly, they 
are confined to an adobe house which is being weakened by the violent storm 
outside.  I like the way THE KILLER SHREWS overcomes its limitations by 
confining its events to one set, using sound effects (the constant wind), 
lighting, and editing to create atmosphere.  The shrews get a fair share of 
screen time, but move quickly and are never clearly seen (director Ray 
Kellogg may have been taking a leaf out of Jacques Tourneur's book).  I also 
find the motivation of the monsters this time around a lot more believable 
than most other horror pics.  Unlike other 50s creatures, which seemed 
intent only in stealing the hero's girlfriend or rampaging around and 
lowering property values, the shrews are driven by starvation - their 
attempts to bite or claw their way into the house are quite creepy, and 
there's even one good shock effect.  There's also some great moments between 
Curtis and star James Best (who, like the characters in NIGHT OF THE LIVING 
DEAD, can't co-operate despite the menacing horrors outside), and a quirky 
escape plan.  Watch it late at night with the lights out, and you may find 
it's not as bad as you've heard.  I realize I'm probably sticking my neck 
out on this one, but I guess I've always stood up for the underdog, even 
when they're disguised as shrews. 

Title
Review for Night of the Lepus (1972)
What can the producers of this film have been thinking?  With the
taxonomical charts all but exhausted for likely movie monsters it
appears that one of the few options left available was rabbits.  For
rabbits, read the six-foot killer variety.  You might think that such
material could only be interpreted, filmwise, as camp, but Z-feature
director William F. Claxton (this is his best-known film) treats his
story as soberly as the Latin denotation of the title would have it. 
You can call a spade a spade,  but a lepus is still a bunny, and no
amount of spooky lighting and blood-spattered muzzles doth a monster
make.  By-the-numbers plot involves Professor Roy Bennett (Stuart
Whitman) and his wife Gerry (Janet Leigh) trying to rid Arizona
farmland of a rabbit plague by injecting them with an experimental
(what else?) virulent serum.  Said serum, in the tradition of all
sci-fi horror flicks, increases rabbits to giant size and sends them on the
rampage ("They're getting meaner and hungrier,"  says Whitman, and
that's while they're still pet-sized!).  The expected bunny attacks
ensue until our quick-thinking heroes come up with a means to destroy
them.  This, as it transpires, involves a subtle mix of electrocution,
machine-gunning, and incineration.
To tell the truth, I feel a little sorry for the makers of this film. 
They'd obviously gone to some effort to have us take the rabbit threat
seriously.  These intentions last about as long as it takes to get to
the first rabbit attack, which should coincidentally mark the first
time everyone watching will laugh out loud.  But apart from this
scene, film is quite dull and has little that is humorous.  There are
a couple of moments: The sheriff exhorts the help of a drive-in
audience who unquestioningly obey his absurd-sounding orders; a man
driving across state ignores hitch-hiking Whitman, reminding his wife
about not picking up hitchers, "especially when they're carrying
guns".  
Film is a failure on every level - it was even rated PG, not an
auspicious start for a horror film - but it isn't too hard to imagine
it being terrifying for young children, by dint of the interminable
slow-motion stampeding rabbit footage (which begins to take on a
surreal quality) and the mixture of monster-bunny noises (they sound
alternatively like cattle, elephants, and cassettes being chewed up in
a tape deck).  The juxtaposition of harmless cuddly animals turning
into hopping mad omnivores (not carnivores, as the film suggests) may
be exactly the kind of thing to give some kids nightmares.  Based on 
Russel Brandon's novel "The Year of the Angry Rabbit".  Also with
DeForest Kelley (as Elgin Vlark, a character with a name even sillier
than his own).  Footnote: The real-life Australian and New Zealand rabbit plagues
mentioned in the film have their own solutions - in NZ you can spend
one day of the April holidays participating in the Annual Easter Bunny
Shoot! 

Title
Review for Swimmer, The (1968)
When we first see Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) dive into a pool and
then jump out again he is spry, jovial, and optimistic.  By the time
he has had his last swim he is wading in and hauling himself out, a
broken man.  Director Frank Perry's cult favorite follows Lancaster's
progress from one residential home to another as he plots his route
(on foot) back to his hillside mansion according to the availability
of swimming pools in the area.  Lancaster knows his wealthy neighbors
well, but we soon discover that he has been out of touch for some
time, and that they know something we don't.
Despite our introduction to Lancaster's character, who is full of
compliments and bon homie, we can't help feeling doubtful about him. 
Part of this is due to that fixed, trademark Lancaster grin and his
constant promises and appointments (which mount up until we realize he
can never remember them all), but I believe much of the discomfort we
feel is also due to his appearance.  Dressed only in swimming trunks,
he is exposed to the elements, constantly getting wet and drying off. 
It isn't long before he is footsore and shivering (significantly, the
only time we see him inside a building is when he is showering).  It
appears that Lancaster is stuck halfway - he is baring his physical
self but not his soul.  Does he realize he has a problem?  Perry's use
of light flare and out-of-focus links perpetuate Lancaster's confused
state of mind - his head is in the clouds, as his constant ruminations
about the sky testify; his conversations with people consist almost
wholly of reminiscences.  Interestingly, the moment we associate
Lancaster's reveries with denial, the characters he encounters start
to change.  Initially full of good cheer, they become more hostile
throughout the film's course.  Because the tricky script concentrates
mostly on Lancaster we don't notice that half the people he meets are
probably just as screwed up as he is.  Perry equates the status symbol
of the backyard pool with all the snobbery and foibles of the
nouveau-rich.  They don't want him in their pools / they don't want
him in their social circle.  By the time Lancaster has reached the
public baths at the end of his journey, he has descended into an
overcrowded, overchlorinated hell.  It was a journey he had to make:
he just failed to recognize the real reason.

Title
Review for Simon (1980)
Along with ALTERED STATES, this uneven comedy by Marshall Brickman
seemed to make 1980 the year for isolation tank experiments.  Alan
Arkin plays the title character, a college lecturer who has been
selected for an elaborate, if somewhat fey, experiment by Austin
Pendleton's elite scientific task force.  Through various
none-too-subtle methods (it's a comedy, after all), Arkin is duped into
believing that he is not a human being, but, in fact, an
extra-terrestrial.  Once this plot turn takes effect, the direction of
the story is anyone's guess.  It's obvious that writer-director
Brickman wanted to milk as many ideas from this premise as he could.
Instead, the satire becomes muddy.  Part of the problem is that
Brickman keeps shifting targets - religion, television, the government
- and doesn't provide a cruel enough edge to his story.  Its light tone
is reminiscent of the earlier Woody Allen movies (particularly SLEEPER)
that Brickman had a hand in.  Arkin, a fine actor who has demonstrated
his comedic touch in many other roles, is stuck with an impossibly
confused character.  In the end, Simon becomes little more than a
melange of his more familiar mannerisms.
Despite flaws, film still manages many funny moments - a highlight is
Arkin's mime of the evolution of man, excitedly narrated by observing
scientist Wallace Shawn.  Shawn and his colleagues (particularly Max
Wright, who fits his role like a glove) provide much humor as the cabal
of geniuses that conspiracy theorists love to think are secretly
running the world.  These scientists, however, are not interested in
major issues - their pursuits are petty or fanciful.  The newly
'alienated' Simon, in like fashion, is interested only in the trivial
aspects of modern life.  Intentionally or not, this keeps the whole
story inconsequential.  Yet although Simon has none of the
disorientation we would accord any extra-terrestrial visitor, he does
draw attention to one element we might otherwise overlook: If aliens
did appear on our planet, their culture shock would not be generated by
such global concepts as politics, religion, or war, but rather the
petty accessories of people's everyday lives.  Film's uninspiring title
didn't contribute much to its box-office.  Also with: Madeline Kahn
(less kooky than usual), and Judy Graubert as Simon's girlfriend.

Review for South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)
South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)  80m
Those who like to collect SOUTH PARK sound bites for their web pages will 
have their work cut out for them here.  See it with an audience of fans and 
you'll know what I mean - nearly every line gets a response.  It's a rare 
thing for an animated feature to be more dependent on the script than the 
animation itself, but that's pretty much the case here.  SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, 
LONGER AND UNCUT is the feature version of the hit cable TV series, and is 
really quite groundbreaking as animated features go, managing to attract the 
attention of mainstream boxoffice with scrappy, alternative material.  
Whether it ever screens on television in any form is another matter 
completely - this is the worst of the TV show's regular offenses taken to 
the nth degree.  Its two most puerile and irritating characters (a flatulent 
duo named Terrance and Philip) are the catalyst for the plot, which involves 
the South Park Elementary School kids sneaking into an R-rated movie and 
emerging with their vocabulary expanded considerably.  The mothers of the 
children -  this is trash imitating life, folks - immediately ask for 
reprisals to be taken against the film.  Of course these are the charges 
that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have been answering for months, and 
this is their magnificently infantile response.  I won't get into any 
polemic about how SOUTH PARK is setting a bad example for children, because 
as long as there have been cartoons there have always been sad individuals 
unable to grasp the concept of animation being an adult entertainment form, 
and the argument is pointless before it has even begun.  Nuff said.
SOUTH PARK is a riot (one line about menstruation kept me laughing for over 
a minute) but, as is usually the case, its humor is an acquired taste and it 
does help if you are familiar with the characters.  The pretext for getting 
all the children suddenly swearing is a logical one, given the absence of 
R-rated language in the television series (even though we all knew they were 
capable of it).  For the first half hour it's funny, but then too much 
weight is placed on this one idea as the film's central gag.  As is often 
the case with this sort of thing, the initial shock/humor of seeing the 
grade-schoolers using coarse language becomes routine with overuse.  It 
wouldn't have been self-censoring of Parker and Stone to have edited quite a 
bit of the 'R' language out, especially in the film's second half.  There 
would have been enough concessions included for series followers to 
compensate: Kenny's weekly death scene goes beyond the show's standard 
cut-out animation style into a fluid, three-dimensional afterlife; Cartman 
gets a reprise of his well-known pejorative ditty about Kyle's mother; 
there's some truly appalling and tasteless attacks on Saddam Hussein (but he 
deserves it, the jerk); and one unexpected semi-serious moment involving 
Kenny near the film's conclusion (which includes a line from BEAVIS AND 
BUTT-HEAD creator Mike Judge).  And then of course there are the songs.  As 
tiresome as these may seem in the Disney films and their imitators (which 
always slow the plot down with some sappy number in the hopes of netting an 
Oscar), in SOUTH PARK they are suitably short, funny and punchy, including a 
LES MISERABLES spoof and a zinger directed at those introspective, 
soul-searching ballad-monologues (featuring Satan). Surprisingly the songs 
are pretty good (My favorites would be the opening track and 'Just Say 
Mm'Kay').  It's too bad they won't be nominated for any Oscars though.  I 
would have loved to have seen the Terrance and Philip number performed at 
the Academy Awards.


Title
Review for Devil at Your Heels, The (1981)
You might think this documentary is a put-on after the first ten minutes - 
the kind of thing stunt-comedian 'Super Dave' Osborne might come up with - 
but it's further endorsement that truth is stranger (and funnier) than 
fiction.  Star of the show is 'Mad Canadian' daredevil Ken Carter, whose 
speciality is jumping cars.  His dream is to go one better than Evel 
Knievel's famous leap over the Snake River Canyon and build a ramp and car 
that will enable him to jump the St Lawrence seaway from the USA into 
Canada.  He should have just used the Ambassador Bridge.  The events that we 
watch unfold become a comedy of errors on a scale so monumental it 
practically lobbies for a renaming of Murphy's Law in honor of Carter.
The pitfalls Carter experiences are best left undisclosed here, but his 
quest is a captivating story.  A great cast of 'supporting characters' drift 
in and out of the film, all promoters or stunt performers (including Knievel 
himself) with their own opinions of Carter and his harebrained stunt.  
Taking central place among them is Carter himself, congenial all the while 
(compare him with fellow stuntman Ken Powers near the film's end) and 
maintaining an optimistic perspective while he suffers one setback after 
another.  Carter remains equanimous throughout the entire project, proving 
that he is either a nice guy or just plain nuts (he's probably too fixated 
to get genuinely angry). Born to hustle, he shares with his 
adrenaline-hooked buddies an unfortunate tendency to deliver one clumsy 
aphorism or mixed metaphor after another - even his last words are a 
misattribution of a Crosby, Stills and Nash song - but at least this proves 
that Carter is the kind of everyman that we could easily root for.
The preparations for the costly stunt stretch out to months, then years.  
Like Carter, we too never know what is around the corner, and become just as 
frustrated as the players in the film who keep waiting for something to 
happen.  Film-maker Robert Fortier wrings every last drop of expectation out 
of us, serving up one false alarm after another (the use of music is very 
effective) until the tension in the film's final reels is unbearable.  
Guaranteed to produce laughs and gasps from the audience, there's no reason 
why this obscure gem shouldn't become a regular on the festival circuit.  
Don't even try to guess the real-life twist ending!

Title
Review for Summer School (1987)
A surprise for anyone expecting just another dumb teen sex comedy, although 
Carl Reiner's involvement as director should indicate something more than 
the usual fluff.  Freddy Shoop (Mark Harmon) is a gym teacher forced into 
teaching remedial English for the summer with a bunch of teenagers who are 
just as unmotivated as he is.  While SUMMER SCHOOL is rooted in familiar 
genre conventions (a beach scene, a party, forgettable pop/rock music on the 
soundtrack) it noticeably steers clear of the expected plot conventions 
(e.g. the revenge-by-humiliation ritual that usually climaxes films of this 
type).  After the first few minutes it looks like the 'dumb teen sex comedy' 
genre is about to give way to the even more repellent high-school cliché of 
'unorthodox teacher inspires misfit kids to succeed'.  Without giving away 
the film's ending, which is more realistic than you'd expect, SUMMER SCHOOL 
heads into that territory but does make a few compromises.
SUMMER SCHOOL's script is full of clever lines and snappy dialogue, 
particularly in the exchanges between Harmon and neighboring teacher Kirstie 
Alley.  The kids are all 'character types' but they aren't the usual jerks 
we see in high school comedies, and even the standard authority-figure 
villain (Robin Thomas) isn't the stock type - for a moment you'll wonder if 
he's secretly amused at the outrageous prank the class pulls on their 
substitute teacher.  Harmon and Alley spar well together - I don't know if 
this role helped her land the part of Rebecca Howe in CHEERS (it was in the 
same year) but there's obvious similarities.  She's immensely likable, as is 
the easy-going Harmon.  The class is also likable, despite their limited 
screen time as individual characters.  Even Harmon's dog is likable!  What's 
odd about this film is that although there's no nudity, sex or drugs, there 
is some coarse language (it's all compressed into one early scene!) and gore 
(we see 'highlights' from a 16mm print of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) that 
lifts it out of any family viewing category.  There's also a pregnant 
teenager played by Shawnee Smith, a minor role which is treated in an 
unsensational manner and with a surprisingly practical resolution.  Her 
fellow students include Dean Cameron and Courtney Thorne-Smith, who had 
already struggled with high school life in the TV series FAST TIMES.  The 
happy final shot, which has a spontaneous feel to it, sums up the spirit of 
the whole movie.


Title
Review for Fargo (1996)
I was getting worried about the Coen brothers.  I'd foregone their
last film, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY, after sensing they were settling
themselves into a period-movie rut.  FARGO, set in 1987, isn't exactly
contemporary but does place the Coens back on track with a winner
(Director Joel took the prize at Cannes). Their latest effort revisits the
smalltown-murder-gone-wrong of their debut BLOOD SIMPLE, but less
self-consciously.  Frances McDormand (Joel's real-life partner) is a
North Dakota cop investigating a triple shooting along an isolated,
snowbound highway.  Piecing together clues and statements she
gradually unearths what we, the audience, have known all along: that
the mayhem - and there is more to come - is all part of a kidnapping
stunt gone horribly awry.
Given that North Dakota is the birthplace of Paul Bunyan, latecomers
who miss the based-on-true-story disclaimer at the film's start may be
forgiven for thinking that the Coens have used their setting to spin a
tall tale of their own.  The landscape they film is as stark and
featureless as if it were made of White-Out.  The spectre of Bunyan
presides over all in the form of a spookily lit totemic idol.  And
yes, to perpetuate the metaphor, an axe is swung by one of the
villians - and if this suggests a violent side to FARGO then you can
take it as having been warned in advance.  The violence isn't of the
punky Rodriguez-Tarantino vogue, but is nevertheless painful to watch
because it is true and most of its victims are bystanders.
It is to the Coens credit that they pull off a difficult task with
agility and style; presenting a factual story as if it were a black
comedy without dishonoring those involved.  Their light steps from
darkness into light may be the cinematic balancing act of the year. 
Most of this is due to McDormand, who provides the film with a soul
that we can now see conspicuously absent from other Coen films.  Her
chipper equanimity persuades us that maybe she is the only ray of
sunshine able to penetrate the dark, cold world around her.  Her
performance, along with W H Macy, as an increasingly anxious car
salesman, and Steve Buscemi as, well, Steve Buscemi, make this the
Coen's best-acted film to date.  What's interesting is that the
storyline is so steeped with their usual trademarks that it makes one
wonder how long the Coens had looked for a true story before they 
found one that was a suitable reflection of their own fictions.

Title
Review for Catch-22 (1970)
There is a danger in producing films that take on `big themes',
especially if they spring from masterfully written source material:
they give more for the critics to pick over.  Despite much praise for
his first two features, stage-director-turned-film-director Mike
Nichols was unable to avoid dismissive reviews for his
much-anticipated film version of Joseph Heller's classic anti-war
novel.  But perhaps filmgoers were expecting too much - if not the
impossible.  As anyone who has read the book can tell you, adapting
Heller's labyrinthine work for the screen would be a monumental task
for even the most seasoned of film-makers.  It's time to give Nichols
his due: he and writer Buck Henry (who also appears in the film)
manage to retain the novel's panoply of characters and distinctive
blend of satire, philosophy, farce, and horror.  Nichols also makes an
effort to retain the mood of the book by casting Alan Arkin in the
pivotal role of Yossarian -  his charismatic performance effectively
guides the audience through the fractured narrative of Heller's story.
In essence, film is about Yossarian, a bombardier trapped in a WWII
airforce base situated on a Mediterranean island.  He wants out of the
war, but the army has conveniently provided a loophole - catch-22 -
that will prevent him from ever leaving until they are through with
him.  The circular logic of this catch is Heller's metaphor for the
self-serving logic of the military in wartime, and Nichols exploits
its farcial nature for all it's worth, keeping much of Heller's giddy
dialogue: sometimes it's hard to tell if a scene is being played
straight, or for laughs.  Nichols confounds this further by compiling
a staggering cast of actors both comic (Bob Newhart, Richard Benjamin,
Norman Fell, Jack Gilford) and dramatic (Martin Balsam, Anthony
Perkins, Jon Voight - memorable as Milo Minderbinder - Martin Sheen,
and Orson Welles, who was offered the part of General Dreedle after
being beaten to the punch by Nichols in adapting Heller's book for the
screen).  Who plays who isn't really important anyhow: each character
is so wound up in their own private routines, schemes, or enterprises
that they remain oblivious of their absurd situation.  It's only
Yossarian, who appears to be in a state of extreme agitation
throughout the film, that really seems to know what's going on - but
as he is brainwashed by the eponymous catch-22 even he can't be sure
whether or not he is crazy.
As would be expected from Nichols, performances from the cast are fine
all round, but he also uses his setting to explore cinematic territory
unavailable in the domestic scenarios of his earlier films.  He uses
every inch of the wide-screen frame to good effect - this is
definitely one to see in a cinema.  Also with:  Art Garfunkel, Paula
Prentiss, Charles Grodin, Bob Balaban.

Review for Gokiburi-tachi no tasogare (1987)
I imagine director Hiroaki Yoshida chose this title in preference to
`Day of the Cockroaches' (too apocalyptic) or `Night of the
Cockroaches' (too horrific) for this part-animated, part-live-action
tale.  But while `twilight' - evocative of a closing chapter/era - is 
really  more appropriate, it is simply wishful thinking to suggest that
cockroaches have had their time on Earth. 
This is one of those films that you watch and wonder why it was ever
made.  It's hardly box-office material: a love triangle between three
cockroaches during an ongoing war - the war in this case being against
two humans, the indifferent Mr Saito (Kaoru Kobayashi ) and his
neighbor the roach-hating Miss Momoko ((Setsuko Karasumaru ).  Using
real actors in the human roles makes it hard for us to fully identify
with the animated roaches, despite Yoshida's overripe
anthropomorphizing (these bugs make Jiminy Cricket look like E.T.) 
Furthermore, who really wants to identify with cockroaches anyway?  In
some cases it works: the low angle, POV floor shots; the sequence
where one of the older roaches scoots among the shadows to retrieve a
crumb on the floor (he does it on six legs as opposed to walking
upright!).  At other times it's just offputting.  Being a confirmed
roach-hater myself I didn't find anything cute about partying roaches
hanging around a toilet or crowded around leftovers.  Also, the
storyline rambles.  There's just too much to-ing and fro-ing, and at
one and three-quarter hours running time the film is overlong.  Film's
major saving grace is that at no time the roaches burst into song (a
la The Roches, perhaps?) - cartoon characters singing love songs to
each other is another of my pet peeves.  In fact, the simple, delicate
score may be the best thing it has going for it.
It's hard to recommend this movie because its audience is unclear. 
Obviously, those with an interest in animation should check it out. 
It's probably not offbeat enough for cult status (although it surely
marks the cinematic debut of a talking turd).  What's interesting is
that if this film had been made forty years earlier it would have
undoubtedly been seen as a political statement.  The comparisons with
Hiroshima and Nagasaki are plain: the roaches' allies in the
neighboring `country' across the backyard have German names; civilian
roaches are annihilated indiscriminately by insecticide bombs; the
roach army flies into battle on suicide missions; and of course, we
all know which insects will be most likely to survive a nuclear
holocaust, don't we?  This is a GODZILLA destruction allegory pared down
to insect level.  It still doesn't excuse the film from being dull;
the characters are largely static, uninteresting or cliched.  With
some judicious editing the storyline could have been tightened
considerably.  Forget trying to sympathize with cockroaches - watch
CREEPSHOW if you want to see some real roach action.  

Title
Review for General, The (1998)
John Boorman deservedly won the Best Director at Cannes in 1998 for this 
biopic of Irish criminal Martin Cahill (who was assassinated by the IRA four 
years previously).  It is one of his finest works, a film that manages to 
look both as the opus of a mature film-maker and the early work of a 
talented new arrival.  THE GENERAL is wonderfully assured and without the 
unevenness of earlier Boorman works, yet also appears an apotheosis of all 
that went before it:  we can see the black-and-white spirited 60s of CATCH 
US IF YOU CAN, another great performance from Jon Voight (DELIVERANCE), the 
criminal underworld of POINT BLANK, the nostalgia of HOPE AND GLORY, and the 
man-as-myth themes of EXCALIBUR and ZARDOZ.  Throw in a few giant locusts 
and you'd be able to pull EXORCIST II out of the hat as well (Boorman does 
make at least one in-joke by including a brief shot of a 'Squeal like a Pig' 
t-shirt that cites the most famous line from DELIVERANCE).
THE GENERAL scores on many levels - the acting is terrific (Brendan Gleeson 
makes the role entirely his own, and Voight's accent is faultless), the 
story engaging, and the viewpoint always open.  Boorman doesn't judge 
Cahill, although he does get us to admire his resourcefulness.  It's hard 
not to like him - unlike most other crime lords he does not create a 
dangerous heirarchy that places him significantly at the top.  True, he is 
the brains of his operation, but his shambolic, hangdog manner keep him in 
at grass roots level with the rest of his boys.  Even when resorting to 
thuggery (when one of the gang appears to have cheated the others), his 
organization doesn't appear as sadistic as others we have seen on screen.  
Really, Cahill is the antithesis of the gangster image popularised by films 
such as GODFATHER and CASINO.  Rather than grandstand in the manner of a 
mafia Don, Cahill shuffles about obscured by rainwear; he avoids eye contact 
and speaks quietly; his hand is always fluttering near his face, trying to 
hide it.  His rogueishness could almost win us over entirely if we were not 
reminded (by Voight's character) that his antics have lost several honest 
people their jobs and have terrified people inside their homes.  Cahill 
lives an extraordinary life but is determined to keep his lifestyle as 
'normal' as possible - all he wants is a nice house in a nice area for his 
family (in the meantime, he carries on what is seen as just a 'normal' 
affair with his sister-in-law!).  We hardly notice the conflict because the 
rest of the country is in turmoil anyway - by the time Cahill, the police, 
and the IRA are all on opposing sides, we've lost hope for anything ever 
attaining normality.  Maybe that's why one of the more memorable moments in 
THE GENERAL is an understated housebreaking scene, in which Cahill moves 
from room to room while a Van Morrison song plays quietly and magically on 
the soundtrack.  It's a sweet, distinctive cinema moment; we can only hope 
that Boorman will be bringing us more.


Title
Review for Olympia 1. Teil - Fest der Völker (1938)
Leni Riefenstahl's film of the 1936 Berlin Olympic games is considered to be 
among the greatest documentaries ever made.  It's important both as a 
historical document and as an example of film-making technique, but while 
the grandeur of the event and the film's mammoth running time do infuse it 
with an epic sense, modern-day audiences may find their attention wandering. 
  Hitler and Goebbels saw the spectacle of the games as an opportunity to 
show off the new Reich, but neither were responsible for employing 
Riefenstahl, who had made the jingoistic Nazi rally film TRIUMPH OF THE WILL 
a couple of years earlier.  Riefenstahl's attachment to the project, via an 
Olympic official, ensured that the film of the event would not escape being 
viewed as a propaganda piece in itself,  although this seems arbitrary 
insofar as the Olympics are a hype vehicle for every participating country 
anyway.  Riefenstahl, who had previously directed and acted in features, 
puts a creative spin on her document and utilizes different technological 
innovations.  She embellishes the events without changing facts, but lays 
herself open to charges of pro-fascist imagery - the opening sequence, for 
example, depicts buffed, nude athletes flexing their muscles against 
dramatic skies and has obvious Aryan overtones.  But if this is the case, 
why would she include so much footage of black athlete Jesse Owens winning 
event after event and debunking the Aryan supremacy myth right before 
Hitler's eyes?  Riefenstahl has always claimed her life's work as being 
artistically motived, and it's at least easier to believe this in OLYMPIAD 
than it is in TRIUMPH.  Notice that there wasn't any of this fuss when a 
group of directors similarly fetishized athletic bodies in the 1972 Olympics 
movie VISIONS OF EIGHT.
OLYMPIAD is split into two parts, 'The Festival of the People' and 'The 
Festival of Beauty'.  Part one focuses on track and field while part two 
looks at other events outside the stadium - but there's only so much running 
and jumping a viewer can endure.  By the time the film returns to pentathlon 
and decathlon events already covered in the first half, it starts getting 
tedious.  OLYMPIAD doesn't start off too excitingly (watching people 
throwing shot and hammers isn't too exciting at the best of times) but picks 
up once the races start - visually these are more involving because at a 
glance we can tell who is winning at any moment throughout the event, even 
if we don't know who they are.  You'd have to assume that Riefenstahl did 
the best job she could editing the 400,000 feet of film she'd retrieved from 
the 30 camera operators stationed around the Games, and there are some 
interesting moments to be found.  For example, the 1500 meters is filmed in 
one continuous take (it's odd seeing the New Zealand victor accompanied by 
sieg heils from the crowd);  we see a shot of Hitler looking deflated after 
a German relay runner drops the baton when victory appears imminent; 
Riefenstahl inserts shaky close-ups of hands and feet as a marathon runner 
is on the home stretch, projecting to us his physical and mental exhaustion; 
the horses on a steeplechase regularly dump their riders into a ditch and a 
pond; and in the film's famous closing montage, Riefenstahl makes high 
divers appear weightless by filming them at dizzying angles and variable 
speeds.  It's also interesting to see how much has changed since the days of 
the 11th Olympics - the stadiums and uniforms aren't plastered with crass 
product logos, the winners are presented with wreaths instead of medals, and 
the sporting equipment is simpler (e.g. non-flexible vaulting poles).  It's 
disquieting to see competitors on the shooting range firing at human-shaped 
targets when we know that World War II was only three years away.  Couple 
that with the final images of the flags of all nations bowing slowly to the 
ground and the smoke from the extinguished Olympic flame rising into an 
ominous sky, and you'll see why its impossible to view OLYMPIAD nowadays 
without irony.

Review for Day of the Woman (1978)
It was one thing to have films like this playing in cinemas back in the late 
70s, but another to have them on hand for home viewing in the years soon to 
follow.  I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE became one of the 'video nasties' that many 
self-appointed watchdog organizations condemned without really having being 
aware of its previous existence as a 'cinema nasty'.  It's unpleasant 
viewing, but not unwatchable.  Plotwise, it's as basic as you can get: a 
magazine writer (Camille Keaton) rents a house in the woods so that she may 
work on a novel.  She attracts the attention of a group of men who brutally 
assault her.  After recovering, she seeks them out for revenge.  It's the 
primal nature of the film that repels many viewers (it was banned in several 
countries), the inference being that a story this simple cannot have any 
redeeming subtext.  As if to flout this point, the rape sequence that caused 
most of the controversy is protracted unflinchingly.  It isn't helped by the 
murkiness of director Meir Zarchi's motives - is this scene out-and-out 
exploitation or is he trying to present the nature of rape in all its 
ugliness?  At least he can't be accused of making it arousing, exciting or 
titillating.  Keaton's attackers are a reprehensible bunch and you won't 
care what happens to them, but perversely the film-maker's dehumanizing of 
the men is just as bad as their dehumanizing of Keaton.   Two wrongs don't 
make a right, whether in a story a basic as this or as fluffed up as 1998's 
courtroom drama A TIME TO KILL.
I'm not suggesting that Zarchi included themes in his film so that it could 
be viewed on levels other than its obvious exploitation, but some strands do 
become noticeable.  It's a straightforward enough ploy to necessitate a 
character's isolation by making her a novelist, but it's interesting that 
the first thing we see Keaton do after recovering from her ordeal is write 
(anybody else would have contacted the police).  She creates her own 
scenario of revenge, playacting with the men and turning their own egos and 
machismo against them, while also using weapons and tools unwittingly 
supplied to her by the men themselves - the kind of thing that would appeal 
to any scenarist's inclinations of poetic justice.  She also arranges 
confrontations to take place in or near water, as if her writing 
sensibilities require any cleansing on her part to be represented 
symbolically.  It would be easier to give these notions more credence if 
Keaton didn't keep stripping off her clothes during these scenes.  In some 
ways the use of her body as a lure is in line with her sense of irony but it 
also comes across as just another cheap thrill from the director.  What 
finally deflates any serious intent of the film is the way that Keaton's 
vengeance falls apart at the conclusion: without a plan she simply becomes 
randomly murderous.  Is this any improvement on calculatingly murderous?  
That in itself is an idea worth developing, but you won't find any answers 
in this picture: the film's title change from the original DAY OF THE WOMAN 
pretty much established where the film-makers were standing on this one.

Title
Review for Frighteners, The (1996)
I suspect Peter Jackson's latest offering will mark a division between
his fans.  There will be those who accuse him of copping out with a
commercial soft sell (Michael J. Fox?  In a Peter Jackson movie??) and
there will be others happy to see the larrikin New Zealand film-maker
getting his foot in the Hollywood door.
Jackson and co-writer Fran Walsh (who'd collaborated with him on his
earlier film HEAVENLY CREATURES) have thrown together a grab-bag of
ideas for this big-budget comic thriller.   Fox plays Frank Bannister,
a conman who makes his living performing fake psychic cleansings
house-to-house in the small coastal town of Fairwater.  He is aided in
his work by three less-than-enthusiastic spirits who are awaiting
their crossover to the `other side'.  Apart from an unrecognizable
John Astin, this ghostly trio doesn't provide as many laughs as they
should, and Fox's familiar mannerisms don't promise to lift THE
FRIGHTENERS much above the level of a ho-hum supernatural sitcom.  But
not all is lost.  Jackson soon shifts gears, and as things begin to
get serious, so does Fox - his performance improves as the movie goes
on.  Oddball characters begin to spring out of the woodwork (notably
an unhinged FBI agent played by Jeffrey Combs), and the plot takes new
turns:  Bannister is trying to help nominal love interest Lucy (Trini
Alvarado) cope with the recent death of her husband;  Lucy is trying
to help a housebound woman (Dee Wallace Stone) escape from her
domineering mother; the local sheriff is trying to find the cause of a
series of fatal heart attacks plaguing the town; FBI agent Milton
Dammers is trying to pin the blame for these on Bannister.  At the
core of all this is a mysterious dark figure, at first glance the Grim
Reaper (marvelously realized as a furious, flapping streak of robes),
that is causing murder and mayhem throughout Fairwater.  It's up to
Bannister, of course, to stop it.
The most impressive thing about THE FRIGHTENERS is the amount that
Jackson has managed to stuff into it.  In fact there is almost too
much of everything: plot, laughs, suspense, special effects, action,
imagination.  Its only puzzle is why, ultimately, it fails to impress.
 The fans of Jackson's earlier films BAD TASTE and BRAIN DEAD will be
disappointed that his gore has now become computer-generated; fans of
HEAVENLY CREATURES will no doubt see his new film as a step backward
to his splatter days.  But for every weak moment there is a
directorial flourish that compensates (one of my favorites is a wild
scene in a cemetery where all four protagonists are fighting each
other off simultaneously); and who would have believed that a film
touted as a  comedy could contain a sequence as chilling as the one in
which Bannister relives flashbacks of a mass murder?  It is best,
perhaps, to think of THE FRIGHTENERS as Jackson's Ghost Train.  It is
an amusement park ride of a movie, although one tailored to the
director's own tastes.  As Jackson himself laughs it off, "I went to
Hollywood to make a movie, and I blew it".  It's obvious that he saw
his chance to grab the brass ring, and made the most of the ride while
he could.  As should any prospective audience of his new movie.

Title
Review for Punishment Park (1971)
You'll have to be persistent to catch a screening of this political SF 
from Peter Watkins - it's presently unavailable on video and (due to its 
high profanity content) unlikely to be screened on TV.  Film employs the 
usual quasi-documentary style favored by Watkins to depict an 
ultra-conservative America bent on rounding up (mostly young) dissidents 
and subjecting them to grueling tribunals that end either in 
imprisonment or a three-day ordeal in the desert known as Punishment 
Park.  At no stage is the purpose of the park is satisfactorily 
explained: we are to believe that it is a training ground for police 
officers and the National Guard, whose task it is to track down and 
recapture the dissidents who have been turned loose in the desert.  But 
I can't see how any such exercise involves useful skills on behalf of 
the pursuers - their quarry, who are a pretty fragile bunch, have to 
follow a predetermined route and don't pose much of a challenge for the 
armed and mobilized forces on their trail.  Is the park nothing more 
than an excuse for organized sadism?  The purpose behind the park - or 
at least the film's strategy of using the park - makes itself apparent 
when the activists argue amongst themselves about whether or not the 
whole thing is a set-up to shoot them all dead.  Is the state just 
messing with their heads?  It's an uneasiness we share with the 
characters because Watkins' convincing cinema-verite style contradicts 
what we know is an historical untruth.
The scenes in the desert become tense and genuinely scary: they are 
intercut with businesslike discussions among the assault forces and 
heated confrontations at the tribunal.  Towards the film's finale, 
Watkins loses the dispassionate voice he uses in his better-known films 
CULLODEN and THE WAR GAME, and becomes increasingly upset.  Eventually 
his anger makes us question the point behind his film.  It's undeniably 
well made, realistically acted, and arresting, but its agenda is 
unclear.  At first he is condemning the Vietnam war, the brutal 
suppression of student protests, and possible dangerous trends in 
right-wing politics, but then abruptly switches to an out-and-out 
condemnation of the law enforcement mentality that such governments 
breed.  These are, however, just the kinds of discussion points that 
Watkins wants to prompt.  He wrote part of the story and improvised 
others with his non-professional cast, but most notably, quoted much of 
the tribunal statements from actual transcripts.  It's a last grim touch 
that lifts this film out of the ordinary.


Title
Review for Near Dark (1987)
     On the face of it, there seems little that is exceptional,
storywise,with this reworking of the vampire myth.  A young farmhand
(Adrian Pasdar) meets up and falls in love with a young woman (Jenny
Wright) who happens to belong to a clan of vampires.  Once smitten (not
to mention bitten), he finds himself dependent on their wiles to
survive.  Naturally, he resists.  If this sounds like THE LOST BOYS,
also released in 1987, then you'll probably realize why NEAR DARK
became a victim of bad timing and lost attention at the box office.
     NEAR DARK is, however, a treat for horror fans.  The vampires are
genuinely scary--not so much by dint of their supernatural powers as by
their contemporary, thuggish attitudes towards violence (There's a
bratty kid who, as in Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, is bitter
with the knowledge that he is doomed to eternal life and will never be
able to "grow up"--he's like a social worker's worst nightmare).  Other
films in the vampire boom of the late eighties (e.g.  FRIGHT NIGHT,
VAMP, INNOCENT BLOOD) revitalized the myth by using urban American
settings and putting a quirky spin on their stories.  NEAR DARK is
different in that it doesn't play for laughs, and has the notable
distinction of avoiding nearly every image associated with vampires.
There are no wielded crucifixes, bats, wooden stakes, bloodstained
fangs--in fact, the word "vampire" isn't even mentioned--we are just
expected from our knowledge of popular folklore to assume they are so.
That they are creatures of the night is emphasized by their one true
fear:  daylight.  The title of the film points out how their lives are
dictated by the sunset-sunrise cycle.  This is, for all intensive
purposes, the only enemy these vampires have.  They are too savvy to
worry about stakes and crucifixes because they know that modern society
has no time or belief invested in their legend.  This group, roaring
across-country  in their blacked-out van, are successful survivors
because they have transcended the old-world thinking (and portrayal) of
traditional vampires and become the serial killer equivalent more
befitting  the psyche of the late 20th century. The arid desert setting
and menace of the sun help us empathize with the vampires' thirst.
Kathryn Bigelow's direction is broody and assured--the scene in which
the vampires take their time dispatching of their victims in a diner
will definitely be cut for television!  Tangerine Dream contribute
their customary one-size-fits-all score.

Title
Review for Fifth Element, The (1997)
McDonald's must be more than pleased with their product placement in
this lavish science-fantasy.  Not only are they shown as still being
in business at their fly-thrus in 2214, but the film is so heavily
decorated in red and yellow that by the end of it you'll be wondering
if it wasn't all some huge, sly, subliminal advertisement, and that 
the elusive 'fifth element' is actually McDonald's Secret Sauce.
Fortunately, I like red and yellow, I like science-fantasy, and I like
Luc Besson: he showed modest-budget visual flair with his early film
SUBWAY and big-screen visual flair with THE BIG BLUE (You can call it
THE LITTLE BLUE SQUARE if television is the only way you've seen it). 
In THE FIFTH ELEMENT he outdoes himself - not since Terry Gilliam's
BRAZIL has there been a film crammed with such visual bravura. 
Whether it's the costumes by Jean-Paul Gaultier, or the set designs by
Jean "Moebius" Giraud and Jean-Claude Mezieres (who turned out
hundreds of drawings), or the bizarre hairstyles and weird creatures,
the look of the film is astonishing, and it has surely met Besson's
vision as he conceived it.
THE FIFTH ELEMENT starts with the most well-worn of sci-fi ideas, that
of the link between Ancient Egypt and extra-terrestrials - but it is
delivered with such aplomb that it looks almost brand new.  Similarly,
the rest of the film operates on the simplest of premises.  In fact it
is so basic, and its conclusion that 'love conquers all' so trite,
that it is practically beyond reproach - Besson is more interested in
orchestrating his capricious storyline than providing a mindblowing
concept.  It works, because his enthusiasm for this project is so
pervasive (in every scene, in every new camera angle, in each new
gimmick) that you can't help share his sense of enjoyment. The cast he
has assembled also gets into the spirit.  Bruce Willis reprises his
reluctant-hero role for the part of Korben Dallas, a cab driver (or,
more accurately, pilot) on the skids.  He has a chance meeting with an
alien envoy (Milla Jovovich) that in turn leads him to an agitated
priest (Ian Holm) and a venal company director (Gary Oldman). 
Curiously, none of these people are responsible for his involvement in
an impromptu mission (to save the world, what else?) even though they
are all destined to meet again at the conclusion.  The four characters
are as wild and diverse as the four elements that they are in search
of, and just when you think the cast couldn't get more eccentric, an
egotistic, motormouthed DJ (Chris Tucker) is thrown into the mix. 
Everyone is playing it for laughs, including Besson, who indulges in a
welcome change of pace from his recent harder-edged stories.  After
two films about professional killers I was wondering if Besson had
lost his quirkiness: now I look forward to seeing his next production.
 If it's as surprising a choice as this one, I won't be disappointed.
There are several reasons to enjoy THE FIFTH ELEMENT, but a
significant one is the fact that we were allowed to see it without
being subjected to months of marketing hype beforehand.  Could it be
that studios have finally figured out that word of mouth is the best
advertising of all?  The only drawback now will be enthusiastic film
reviews (such as this one) that will have you expecting more than the
film can deliver.  So just forget everything I said.  And tell all
your friends.

Title
Review for U Turn (1997)
All I need to make me see something at the movies is a reason.  If,
for example, somebody told me that a new film of the Arthurian legends
had just opened, I wouldn't be interested in going to see it.  If
however I learned that it was directed by, say, David Lynch, or
Kathryn Bigelow, or Roman Polanski, I would have no hesitation.  And I
guess this is almost the only reason for me to patronise anything new
now.  Because new movies aren't new.  There was a time when movies
reflected life.  Now all they reflect is other movies: a long chain of
reference points that goes back to the first time a plot device was
used, a camera angle tried out, a technical breakthrough discovered.
There's nothing all that new about U TURN either, another of those
crime thrillers set in a quirky jerkwater town populated with
eccentrics.  It's the closest to a genre picture that director Oliver
Stone has come to in a long while, and it is obvious that he is
enjoying the change of pace (no significant 'An Oliver Stone Film' in
the credits of this pic; rather he makes sure we realise it is 'An
Oliver Stone Movie').  Homage, throwback, send-up, revision, call it
what you will, but now even the subversion of these genres has become
old hat.  So what is the reason to see it?  Oliver Stone.  It's
interesting to see how he works in the domain of film noir: for
starters, he uses high-contrast photography to turn it into film
blanche, otherwise the usual ingredients - the murder plot, the bag
full of money, the femme fatale, the double-crossing, and the low-rent
locations - are all there for us to enjoy.  
>From these elements you could make up your own plot which would be
fair stab at approximating U TURN's actual synopsis: Sean Penn breaks
down in a small Arizona town, gets involved with all the wrong people,
and ends up being a patsy in a murder.  Penn has no easy role to play,
but his performance strikes the right chord - even though we are
uncertain about how he can deal with the tailspin that traps him, his
refusal to cave in gives us some confidence that he will prevail (hey,
the guy was once married to Madonna, right?).  In fact, all the
performances from Stone's motley cast are a delight - Penn's
encounters with mechanic Billy Bob Thornton and town punk Joaquin
Phoenix are hilarious, and the leading players are obviously enjoying
the seediness Stone wants from them.  This includes the town itself -
a wonderland of peeling paint and rusting cars, it knows better than
anyone what is going on around its sultry streets.  Everywhere there
are murals, posters, signs, slogans, books, photographs, billboards;
all of which contribute to the backdrop a kind of subliminal
sentience.  Neither is it any safer outside the town: Stone throws in
several intercuts of animals that revisit the spirit bonding and
desert epiphanies he seems so fond of in his films (THE DOORS, NATURAL
BORN KILLERS).  All of nature seems to be on the game- or is it the
joke?  If the town don't kill you, the desert will.  Ayuh. 
U TURN marks another excursion into violence for Stone, but just as he
used it satirically in KILLERS so again he justifies it this time
around by dint of the prerequisite perversities of classic noir.  I
certainly don't find it as smug as Tarantino's own brand of violence -
talented as he may be he has yet to reach the level of assurance with
which Stone handles the medium so masterfully (personally I found the
wilful damage to the paintwork on a Ford Mustang more distressing than
any of the trauma inflicted upon human characters in the movie).  Once
again he collaborates with cinematographer Robert Richardson (this may
be the longest partnering of director and cinematographer I can
remember), and the flashy editing and switching between different
grades of film stock have become trademarks of theirs this last
decade.  It's fun seeing it all again this time around, but I must
admit to some concern about how much longer the fun will last.  I
wanted to see U TURN precisely for Stone's individual stamp on the
work, and wasn't disappointed.  But still, I wonder if some time soon
it wouldn't be a bad idea for Stone to give me a different reason for
seeing his films.  I seem to have run out of reasons for seeing
Tarantino's.

Review for Fiend Without a Face (1958)
Low-budget horror flick follows similar paths to most monster movies
of the 50's.  USAF Major (Marshall Thompson) is assigned to
investigate the death of a local farmer near an isolated airbase in
Canada.  There may be a link between other mysterious deaths and radar
experiments conducted by the base.  Meanwhile an elderly professor
(Kynaston Reeves) is pursuing research of his own.  Scenario falls
into the wave of horror productions that presented atomic radiation as
the new boogeyman of the postwar era.  Its monster, however, is not
the fallout-mutated freak favored by other B-pictures.  In fact, it's
not until the film's end that we see the creature(s) at all.  Story's
premise mixes telekinetic energy and nuclear radiation in a fairly
hodgepodge manner - the professor's simple mind-concentration
experiments might as well be witchcraft or demon-summoning.  Arbitrary
treatment of science almost loses only anti-war element film has to
offer.  The creature is clearly meant to personify the spirit of war
latent in mankind - after all, as the prof spells out, it is evil and
feeds on radiation (if it feeds on radiation then why is it attacking
people for mental energy?).  More revealing is the way the story
assumes that thoughts released to wander free of human minds will
automatically become amoral and harmful.  So much for the concept of
free will!  Besides, it's never established whether the creature is a
product of the id (as in FORBIDDEN PLANET, which came out a year
earlier), the ego, or the superego; or whether it is from the
reptilian, mammalian, or human parts of the brain.  At least these
details might have provided some rationale for the monster, instead of
simply writing off humanity as being inherently self-destructive.  In
spite of flaws, film is still a notch above most B-pics, thanks to a
couple of creepy moments, and a keen finale in a living room.

Title
Review for Raising Cain (1992)
After feeling compromised during the production of his flop BONFIRE OF THE 
VANITIES, Brian De Palma went back to his roots and set to work on what was 
essentially a home movie.  This unabashed reworking of his earlier thrillers 
and horror films was basically a 'Brian De Palma' film for a 'Brian De 
Palma' audience.  It's silly but also one of his more enjoyable outings.  
John Lithgow, who has played nice guys and villains in other movies 
(including De Palma films), gets a shot at both this time around: he's 
Carter Nix, a self-effacing doctor, husband and father, and Cain, his evil 
twin.  Just to round it off, he's also his father, a Norwegian scientist 
disbarred for doing unethical research on split personality.  But wait - 
does Carter really have a brother or is he just letting a dissociated part 
of his personality get away with murder?
You can spot the twists coming most of the time in this movie, but De Palma 
throws in so many that it doesn't seem to matter.  It's not as if he's 
giving you too much time to figure it all out anyway - the story starts 
moving right from the opening minute and doesn't slow down until his 
obligatory exposition scene in which a doctor delivers a long explanation to 
tie up most of the loose ends.  RAISING CAIN doesn't waste time with any 
supporting characters - everyone who appears in this film is an integral 
part of it, and they are introduced one by one as the tricky storyline 
unfolds.  De Palma keeps the pace of the film from flagging by using not 
only the flow of new characters but also diverse stylistic trademarks such 
as dream sequences, flashbacks, red herrings, slow motion sequences, shock 
appearances of characters into the frame and one of his lengthy one-take 
tracking shots (but not his usual split-screen effects which would be quite 
appropriate in this story!).  And inevitably, there is a PSYCHO ripoff, 
although this time it isn't the shower scene (which he'd already done in 
three other films) but the sinking of a car containing a body.
Many of De Palma's regular viewers objected to RAISING CAIN, considering it 
lightweight, clichéd and unambitious.  I think it's a very approachable film 
that works both as a valentine to the director's fans and as a user-friendly 
introduction for audiences unfamiliar with his earlier work.  I'd hate to 
think that the reason for its dismissive reception was only because it was 
lacking in the nudity, sexism or bloodletting that often (but not always) 
marred De Palma's previous efforts.  But then, De Palma is a director who 
has managed to annoy as many people as he's won over, so why should this 
movie be any different?  RAISING CAIN's climax is a multiperspective 
sequence that stands out as the film's highlight even though it lasts less 
than a minute (when I first saw this in a theater the audience laughed and 
applauded).  Unfortunately, it just doesn't work as well on television.  
Although it might help if you collected a batch of like-minded friends to 
form your own 'Brian De Palma' audience.

Title
Review for Miracle Mile (1989)
     Right from the pre-credits opening you'll assume from Anthony
Edwards' retrospective narration that you are about to see a quirky,
affectionate romance.  But by the time MIRACLE MILE has ended you'll
have realized that this is a cunning maneuver by writer/director Steve
de Jarnatt to plant a subconscious sense of reassurance in the minds of
the audience, one that will prevent most people watching from believing
that the worst can happen, right up until the very end.
     Ten minutes into the story, Harry Washello (Edwards) is late for
his second date with new romance Mare Winningham.  While waiting on a
street corner in the early hours of the morning he answers a phone
ringing in a public booth.  To describe the events that happen
afterward would undermine the surprising developments that Jarnatt has
in store, but suffice to say that Harry is informed that inadvertently
launched nuclear warheads are winging their way towards his sleeping
city.  Throughout the rest of the film we watch in frustration as Harry
gets swept up in the circumstances he sets snowballing into motion.  As
in our worst nightmares, he never gains control; he can't seem to get
beyond the same limited geographical area; he (like the audience) is
deprived of essential knowledge - we are never sure whether the missile
scare is real, a hoax, or literally his nightmare.
     Jarnatt juggles humor and action with ease, but it is at the
moment when the film's nightmare logic spills over into the daylight,
where it shouldn't belong, that MIRACLE MILE becomes just plain
chilling.  We watch his portrayal of suppressed panic, which breaks at
different levels for different people, and wonder if we would fare any
better in a similar situation.  Jarnatt and cinematographer Theo Van de
Sande create images that will stick with you, including an
unforgettable final shot viewed from within a helicopter cockpit.
MIRACLE MILE was Jarnatt's pet project after CHERRY 2000, but was held
over for release and undeservedly overlooked.  A film that looks good
on a big screen, with a characteristically persistent score by
Tangerine Dream.  For the sharp-eyed: Jarnatt plants a clue pointing
toward the conclusion of the film by inserting a shot of study notes
for Thomas Pynchon's book GRAVITY'S RAINBOW.

Title
Review for Brain That Wouldn't Die, The (1962)
The Brain That Wouldn't Die (1962) 92m. 
For bad-movie lovers only.  Hopeless horror pic, also known as THE HEAD 
THAT WOULDN'T DIE truly comes a cropper, aided in no small part by The 
Brain That Couldn't Direct and The Cast That Couldn't Act.  After an 
offscreen car crash, neurosurgeon-cum-mad scientist Dr Cortner (Jason 
Evers) somewhat casually relieves his girlfriend of her head and keeps 
it alive in his basement laboratory (the kind of setup that you already 
know is going to go up in flames during the picture's climax).  Arguing 
with her that "I want you as a complete woman, not part of one"  - did I 
mention that the head always has to have the last word? - he roams the 
town in search of the "right" body for his love (played by Virginia 
Leith, a discovery of Stanley Kubrick's).  As his search concentrates 
primarily on seedy nightclubs, beauty contests, and sleazy photography 
classes, it's not hard to gauge just what "right" means in this doctor's 
book.
Writer-Director Joseph Green's static direction (he has no idea how to 
stage extras or action), the boring, empty sets, and the amateur cast 
(as Cortner's girlfriend, Leith is required to act only from the neck 
up, an instruction Green appears to have inadvertently given the rest of 
the cast as well) make most of BRAIN very dull.  The outright stupidity 
of the production is entertaining at first, but becomes tiresome until 
the closing sequences - it picks up during Cortner's lab assistant's 
ridiculously protracted death scene (although this is cropped in some 
versions).  Because the narrative is so nonsensical it's easy to miss 
how tacky the film's agenda really is.  Women are objects - all that 
matters is how they look, whether they are burlesque dancers, models, or 
beauty contestants.  When two women get involved in a brawl Green has 
their room decorated with pictures of cats, and adds a meow at the end 
of the fight just in case we didn't pick up the joke.  Leith stands out 
as the only character that is totally independent - even while a 
disembodied head, she is in service to no-one.  Without a body, she 
isn't beauty, but 'brains' - it is only in this state that she stops 
being the doctor's obliging girlfriend and becomes his critic instead 
(he even has to gag her at one point).  To Green (and the doctor) body = 
object = control, which explains the change in the characters' 
relationship.  In other hands, these ideas might have been teased out to 
create a much more coherent and interesting film, but Green's cardboard 
characters and lazy, juvenile script pretty much put paid to that idea.  
Instead, it's just lousy.
THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE is one of Mystery Science Theater 3000's 
targets for spoofing.  As is usually the case, their own absurd dialogue 
doesn't get much worse than the original's (for example, the moment when 
Dr Cortner takes over another surgeon's patient, peels back his scalp, 
cuts open his skull, and plugs wires into his brain, assuaging any 
worries the surgical team might have by telling them "I've been working 
on something like this for weeks"!).  If MST3K want a real challenge, 
they should take on GONE WITH THE WIND


Title
Review for Boy Friend, The (1971)
Ken Russell's delirious, hilarious, visually dazzling version of Sandy
Wilson's stage play is his one film that most critics approve of. 
It's at once a homage to and send up of old Hollywood musicals
(especially those by Busby Berkeley): an ingenue is thrown into the
spotlight when the star performer calls in sick; a romance blossoms
between the two leading players; a movie mogul happens to be
talent-spotting during that very performance (this idea was based on
Russell's own experience of viewing the stage production).  It also
has the backstage intrigues of all other 30s-40s musicals, only the
major difference is that Russell allows them to spill onstage as well.
 He piles levels upon levels - it is as a
backstage-plot-within-the-play-within-the film that we, the movie
audience (and not the audience in the movie) are supposed to view
Russell's film.  In Russell's version, the plot of the play serves no
other purpose than to parallel his own storyline unwinding behind the
scenes - he is not interested in a straightforward film adaptation of
the play (it would be impossibly vapid) but a specifically cinematic
reworking of the show's many musical numbers.
The amount of musical set-pieces in this film (especially if you've
seen the full-length version) totals more than any other I can think
of in a film of this type.  Russell, who has always liked
choreographing his imagination to music, at last has the chance to
indulge himself for all he's worth (not that anything's really stopped
him before).  Scene by scene, we are treated to one flamboyant setup
after another - they are obviously well beyond the capabilities of the
run-down theater staging the play, but fit in seamlessly with the
film's several fantasy sequences, which is the main point of this, 
and indeed all of the musicals it acknowledges, i.e. to provide 
escape into a colourful world of happy endings.
THE BOY FRIEND is probably best known as the debut for 60s model
Twiggy, who had never acted or sung before but was assured by Russell
that she would be perfect for the role.  She pulls off her part
effortlessly and is ably supported by an excellent, high-spirited cast
(who were obviously tuned in to Russell's wavelength).  Having seen
both versions of this film (one cut is 25 minutes shorter) I would
question the inclusion of the Bacchanalia fantasy and a couple of the
less stagy songs.  Wilson's stage follow-up was the relatively unknown
DIVORCE ME, DARLING.  Watch out for cinema screenings in revival
houses - this one really has to be seen in widescreen Panavision. 
Cast includes Russell regulars Christopher Gable and Max Adrian.

Title
Review for River's Edge (1987)
Moody film by director Tim Hunter and scriptwriter Neal Jiminez has an
unsettling premise, but is populated with characters that are so
dysfunctional they'll have you shaking your head in distanced
amusement.  But maybe that's the point.  Story has serious societal
comment interspersed with black comedy: a teenager (Daniel Roebuck)
kills his girlfriend and leaves her corpse on the river bank.  His
high-school friends, including Matt (Keanu Reeves) and Clarissa (Ione
Skye Leitch) find out, but their reaction is largely unemotional. 
Ironically, the only member of the group to get worked up about the
incident (Crispin Glover) has sympathies that lie not with their dead
schoolmate but with her killer.
RIVER'S EDGE is about failure to communicate at every human level; the
dead girl might as well be the toy doll or the blow-up dummy that also
serve as friends/lovers and similarly end up pitched into the river. 
It would appear that Reeves, who at least supports his little sister,
is the chosen moral voice of this story,  but there's also his high
school teacher, who laments the loss of values he remembers as a
student himself in the 60s.  And then there's the reclusive, paranoid
Feck (Dennis Hopper), an unlikely choice for moral spokesperson, who
is one of only two characters (the other is Reeves) to make an act of
judgment upon the killer.  Feck provides a warped contrast between
generations - he too once killed a girlfriend, but at least in the
60's it was done for love.  It's a generation gap exemplified by
Reeves' family, none of whom understand each other, all of whom ignore
each other.  Suitably, his 12-year old brother - the harbinger of the
generation to come - is even more morally void than the teenagers
surrounding him.
Hunter's film portrays society breaking down on every scale, whether
it is generational, familial, or individual.  What it says about its
characters can be summed up by a design Reeves wears on his jacket -
that of a peace sign superimposed over a skull.  It is so arbitrary an
icon that one can see how ideally it reflects the inability of Reeves
and his friends to recognize choice.  When the teenagers speak of
hitting the road (just like EASY RIDER) we know they have no intention
of doing anything more than talk of it; when Leitch's teacher tells
her that progressive times mean that she and her friends are destined
to become career girls, she looks as if she'd rather not have any such
opportunity handed her.  It's not difficult to see these characters
still living in their town twenty years in the future.  Certainly
that's the case for Hopper's Feck, who has spent twenty years isolated
inside his own house - it's he and Glover who steal the show and
provide the most eccentric moments in the film.  Subdued photography
by Frederick Elmes and score by Jurgen Knieper maintain a cool,
barren, neutral atmosphere.  Most disturbing aspect of film is that it
was based on a real-life incident in central California.

Title
Review for Event Horizon (1997)
   It's not that EVENT HORIZON isn't well made.  It's just that I've
   been there before.  In fact, I'm hard pressed to think of another
   film more entirely fabricated of quotes from other movies.  Barely
   five minutes into the story I found myself sidetracked with
   references from obvious candidates like ALIEN, LIFEFORCE, and 2010,
   but the quotespotting soon brought forth non-SF films such as DON'T
   LOOK NOW and THE SHINING, and culminated with SOLARIS and, God help
   me, Disney's THE BLACK HOLE.
   Why is it - pardon the pun - that black hole movies always suck? 
   It's a fascinating subject that still hasn't been treated right by
   Hollywood.  In this case, the Event Horizon is not the rim of a
   black hole, but the name of a spaceship that reappears in Neptune's
   orbit after a seven year absence.  But maybe it's really a
   non-Event Horizon.  It's a Marie Celeste in Space scenario, the
   kind of story that early STAR TREK episodes bought the patent on
   years ago.  To be fair, the opening scenes are writ large upon the
   screen, at least proving once again that SF cinema was the reason
   that Panavision was invented.  The actors - Laurence Fishburne and
   Sam Neill head the cast - are all fine, the sets are great, the
   budget is big, there is some legitimate haunted-house atmosphere, a
   couple of gripping sequences, and at least one moment that made me
   laugh (when Fishburne decisively announces they're vacating the
   ship).  But there are still holes in the plot, and I don't mean the
   black kind either, that keep the film from being solidly grounded:
   the abandonment of all scientific rationale (even Neill's pragmatic
   Doctor gives up) shows that the film-makers were less interested in
   explanation than effect.  And, come to think of it, isn't there a
   crew member unaccounted for at the end?
   It may not be the movie's fault.  I guess I was expecting something
   more purely science-fictional, and instead got that SF-horror
   hybrid that seems to have consumed the genre of late.  If I had
   seen EVENT HORIZON fifteen years ago I would have no doubt loved
   it.  But you can only jump out of your seats from the same shock
   effects so many times, and after that there's not a lot left for a
   story to go on.  Which is a shame, because I wanted to enjoy this
   film more than I did.  Contrary to its title, EVENT HORIZON didn't
   take me into unchartered territory.  The most unexpected thing
   about the ending was hearing a song by the Prodigy played over the
   final credits.

Title
Review for Eye Creatures, The (1965)
Some movies are bad because of their writing, their acting, or their
directing, but nothing is spared in this insipid horror flick from the
60s.  Armed with a script that could have been written by your average
twelve-year old, our clean-cut young heroes Stan and Susan find
themselves spending most of their elopement trying to convince adults
that the local necking spot in the woods is being invaded by
saucermen.  Will they listen?  Of course not. 
It's hard to tell which is the single worst feature of this movie, but
the writing must surely be a likely contender for the top spot.  Every
phone conversation is ridiculous, and when the dialogue isn't
expository it's just plain dumb.  How about that line when Susan's
pop, who happens to be the city attorney, snaps at her hit-and-run
suspect boyfriend "You're lucky in one respect!  The man you killed
was a nobody!"  To take the heat off the script, the acting is pretty
rank, too (in some cases the cast is required to pretend they're
driving stationary cars and act at the same time).  At least Cynthia
Hull (Susan) has the foresight to distract audiences from her
performance with her vaguely ethnic, gravity-defying hairdo.  The most
unforgivable failing point of the movie, however, is the monster
attack itself.  Attack?  What attack?  I've never seen an alien strike
force so ineffective and vulnerable (one hopeless specimen walks off a
cliff at one point, for no apparent reason).  The eye creatures,
conveniently human-sized humanoids with bubbly heads, manage to do
away with at least one unfortunate bystander, even if it is only by
chasing him very, very slowly and pawing at the air in front of his
face, but after that the "attack" is all but over.  In any case, the
monsters have got to be less of a public menace than the neighborhood
crank who keeps stomping about the woods with his shotgun in search of
trespassing teens.
At first, the film appears to be indulging its young target audience
by portraying all adults and authority figures (parents, the military,
the police) as skeptical, patronizing, or incompetent.  It's a little
perverse when you consider the film was made by adults, which is why
it should be reappraised.  Sure, these teens save the day, but in the
end they're just as ineffectual and witless as the adults they
complain about.  In the final scene Stan and Susan have forgotten
about their marriage (their first step into adulthood, maybe) and
admit they're just a couple of self-professed "crazy kids" canoodling
along with the rest of the gang in their cars.  But what director
Larry Buchanan (of MARS NEEDS WOMEN fame) is most famous for in this
flick is his daring juxtaposition of daylight scenes with night-time
ones.  No, not really.  The production's day-for-night technique was
just as inept as the rest of the picture.

Title
Review for Twice Upon a Time (1983)
Inventive animated tale produced by George Lucas and directed by John
Korty and Charles Swenson.  The minds of sleeping Rushers (humans) are
being influenced by the dream-dispensing land of Frivoli and the
nightmare-inducing Murkworks.  The key to their power struggle is the
mainspring from the Cosmic clock, which controls all time.  Fast,
witty story isn't for all children, especially those who won't have
patience for its unique look and flippant, incidental storyline. 
Visually, film is a combination of rainbow-hued watercolors, pen and
ink, live action, and still photographs.  Its endearingly scrappy look
is matched by its throwaway dialogue - I can imagine this being the
kind of cartoon Robert Altman might produce. 
Hip characters provide many laughs, especially overenthusiastic
superhero Rod Rescueman (James Crenna), and a nonchalant fairy
godmother (Judith Kahan Kampmann).  There's also the nominal lead
character Ralph, a thing that looks like an extra from YELLOW
SUBMARINE (voice actor Lorenzo Music).  Film's main basis for
characterization is to play against stereotype - an idea we're overly
familiar with now, but don't mind in this case because the whole
production has such an easygoing feel about it.  The animators slip in
many visual gags, mostly to do with film and television - one of the
characters is an aspiring actress, another an aspiring writer, another
an aspiring heroic lead.  Consequently, story treats the manufacture
of dreams and nightmares as being akin to the movie-making industry. 
Most interesting visual effects occur when we see a nightmare
activated in the world of the Rushers. 

Title
Review for Georgy Girl (1966)
Lynn Redgrave was never more appealing than when she played the title
character in this breezy comedy-drama.  As was typical of many British
films of the period, this production has kinetic direction, crisp
black and white photography, pop music, urban realism, social issues,
and contemporary attitudes towards sex.  I must admit that I have
always found my interest in such films (TO SIR WITH LOVE also springs
to mind) to be prejudiced in favor of my enjoyment of their title
songs, which instantly evoke nostalgia and affection - unusual
considering it was an era I was never a part of!  It's a shame The
Seekers, who had a number one single with "Georgy Girl", didn't supply
a soundtrack throughout the film, as Simon and Garfunkel would do in
the following  year's THE GRADUATE.  They might have provided it with
a stronger sense of continuity/personality.  As it stands, the film is
crammed with music of varying styles - this at least reflects the
incidental storyline.  Putting it simply, Redgrave shares a flat with
her ungrateful, bitchy friend Meredith (Charlotte Rampling) as an
alternative to staying with her parents, who are live-in house help
for their rich employer (James Mason).  She is pressured to become
less dowdy and more ladylike.  But, being a product of the sixties,
she prefers to go her own way.
Refreshingly, Redgrave isn't portrayed as wacky or rebellious, as many
other young people were shown to be in other films of the time.  She's
a perfect alternative for young women who identified with her
conservative-yet-free-spirited persona and wanted to be themselves
without having to endorse drugs, alcohol, wild parties, or extreme
politics.  Her friends, however, are not so tame - their attitudes
towards premarital sex and abortion were no doubt included to remind
viewers of the changing times.  Film has spirit but its main problem
is that its characters are too mercurial to be taken seriously -
especially Alan Bates, who I find miscast here (he's ten years older
than Redgrave and Rampling, for a start).  By the end of the story you
won't believe anything they say - but think further and you'll realize
that they probably feel the same way too.  Every character is trying
to recreate unfulfilled wishes: Redgrave wants to set up a happy home
for Rampling's baby; Mason refurbishes his bedroom in the hope he will
have a mistress; Bates convinces himself that he's in love. 
Ironically, it is the nastiest of them all, Rampling, who really gets
what she wants, when she drives off in her new boyfriend's Mercedes
near the end of the film.  Ending remains open to many possible
outcomes until the last few frames. The lyrics sung over the closing
credits - which you won't find on the single - are unexpectedly
bittersweet, especially in light of the shift of expression on
Redgrave's face.  She and Mason were nominated for Oscars.  Silvio
Narizzano directed.

Title
Review for Krasnaya palatka (1971)
     General Umberto Nobile (Peter Finch), an explorer whose airship,
the ITALIA, crashed during a 1928 expedition across the Arctic, is
visited 40 years later by spirits from his past who have gathered to
judge him.  These include Hardy Krueger as a mercenary pilot, Sean
Connery as Roald Amundsen, and Claudia Cardinale, who looks as if she
just dropped by on her way back from the hairdressers (Connery gets top
billing but appears in only three scenes).  This lengthy pre-credits
sequence serves as a framing device for what is essentially a
based-on-fact adventure tale that comprises the bulk of the movie.
Film concludes with spirits - who are by now recognisable as key
characters in the story - delivering their verdict upon Nobile.
     Watching this film I can't help think that the producers must have
fought the temptation to release two versions - one as it stands, and
the other with all the present-day footage removed.  This latter cut
would certainly concentrate more on the dramatic survival scenes.  But
the film-makers seem to want to re-open the file on Nobile's story; to
exonerate him somehow by presenting perspectives of history as seen
then-and-now.  Flashback structure seems ill-fitting because events
from the past are not told exclusively from Finch's viewpoint, placing
viewers in the position of accepting the spirits of the present , who
are surely providing him with the full story, as real and not merely
conjurations of his guilty subconscious.  Why go to all the trouble of
providing newsreel archives and authentic locations to establish a
realistic atmosphere just to undermine its credibility with a fantasy
framework?  Fortunately, the arctic landscapes are all too real, and a
good anchor back to the world of fact: they are vast, beautiful, and
foreboding, where human figures are reduced to black dots on the ice.
     Film works best when it shows men grappling against the elements
     with barely-adequate technology.  The scenes with the icebreaker,
airplanes, and airship are all convincingly recreated - the initial
crash makes for a gripping sequence.  Strongest feature of any
true-life survival film is that there can be no calculated script
decisions over who will live and who will die, so (unless you've read
up on your history) there's no sure way to know the outcome.  Film's
eccentric atmosphere will likewise keep you offguard.  Movie buffs may
find it quirky to see Krueger and Finch playing a scene together inside
airship wreckage in the middle of the Arctic only six years after they
were similarly stuck in the middle of the desert in THE FLIGHT OF THE
PHOENIX.  Question to consider: If Nobile's expedition had been a
success, would anybody have bothered to make a film about it?

Title
Review for Toys (1992)
I doubt many people were prepared for this whimsical project from
Barry Levinson, especially considering the solid base of reality that
his previous works had been grounded in.  Apart from occasionally
flirting with the fantastic (allegory in THE NATURAL, hallucinations
in YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES) Levinson had not been pegged as a fantasy
director by the Hollywood establishment, so it's interesting to
discover that TOYS was intended as his directorial debut (he made
DINER instead).  It's just as well he postponed it for ten years -
given its ambitious nature and lavish production I don't see how he
could have made it back then.
Film is set in a toy factory (which looks like a kind of kiddie
METROPOLIS) inherited by a cashiered General (Michael Gambon) who is
less than happy about losing his career in the army for a future in a
toyshop, especially one run by his frivolous nephew (Robin Williams,
in another of his kid-who-never-grew-up roles).  The world of TOYS is
too innocent by half, which is why it comes as no surprise to us when
the General decides to exploit the factory's production concepts for
his own ends.  Story is inventive and otherwordly, but even after ten
years of thought it doesn't appear that Levinson has gotten it quite
right - I think the ending, while logical in light of where the film
is heading, is unsatisfying, for one thing.  But as TOYS is set in a
world where nothing is what it appears, any intangibility on
Levinson's part can only seem fitting.  It's as if he remembered a
dream and tried to visualize it for others to see.  I also like the
tone that he maintains throughout much of its length - it would have
been too obvious to go the way of black comedy.  TOYS definitely isn't
dark: its bright primary colors are mixed with pastels; everything we
see is supergeometric, shiny, and spotless.  Even the newly-enthused
General gets into his role as factory owner by switching the design of
his camouflage outfit over to cheerful colors.
The main reason to see TOYS is its look.  Its crystal-clear
photography and innovative sets deserve to be seen in a cinema -that
much was apparent to me when viewing it a second time on television
and seeing how lacking in atmosphere the opening sequence looked in
comparison.  Surreal visual sense (inspired by Magritte), magical
setting (the only scenes outdoors take place in a ubiquitous green
field), and naive, offbeat plot make for a perfect bedtime story. 
Simple message - 'War is bad' - will not be lost on children.  That we
think the meetings of the toy executives trivial and absurd is ironic
considering we think nothing of the more familiar (but equally absurd)
domain of the strategic military conferences in the film.  Williams
combines both levels of play (toys and soldiers) in his climatic
address to the factory toys, throwing in every jingoistic cliche in
the books, combining Gandhi, Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Henry V,
Lord Kitchener.  Rapper LL Cool J acquits himself well as the
General's son.  Joan Cusak gives a standout performance as Williams'
quirky sister, who sums up attitude of film in her line "the best part
is no-one got hurt".
TOYS is like a big toy itself, a grab-bag of novelties and visual gags
- there's a great bit where the General, under X-ray surveillance, is
spouting about war as if he is Death personified.  Sci-fi fans will
pick up the line poached from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL as the
last war toy fires its final shot (I don't know how many people share
this view, but contrary to film's message, I find the military toys
more interesting than the boring clockwork toys that seem to be the
factory's main product line).  Film's memorable trailer featured
Williams improvising in an open field, setting audiences up for an
out-and-out comedy that they didn't get.  This goes some way to
explaining its lukewarm reaction at the box office.

Title
Review for Mars Attacks! (1996)
I've looked forward to Tim Burton's credit sequences ever since the
delirious, operatic opening moments for BATMAN RETURNS.  On this
score, MARS ATTACKS! doesn't disappoint  - that he can make so much of
so little (namely, hokey-looking saucers flying through space) is
ample proof of his talent.  Unfortunately, it's so tantalizingly
powerful that - for a while at least - the rest of his film appears to
suffer by comparison.
The story, inspired by a series of trading cards, is so by-the-numbers
that it hardly seems worth recounting here, but for the record:  A
fleet of alien spacecraft take up position in orbit around the Earth. 
 The US president (Jack Nicholson), mistakenly persuaded of their
peaceful intentions, finds himself running for cover as the White
House and most of the surrounding neighborhood are suddenly laid to
waste.  He isn't the only one - the storyline jumps between several
characters in different locations, all faced with the same crisis.  If
you think this sounds like the same plot used in INDEPENDENCE DAY,
you're right - and this provides another rather troublesome area of
comparison.  ID4 was a megahit of a movie, a huge, global rocket-ride
with big effects that netted big box office.  MARS ATTACKS! is
deliberately cheesy, a skewed marriage of mainstream pop and Burton's
own eccentricity.  But Burton's film has a significant saving grace:
it is directed by Tim Burton.  While the aliens of ID4 leveled entire
cities with anonymous blasts from their huge starships, the Martians
of MARS ATTACKS! work on a more.....*personal* level.  It is at the
point when the Martians make their first appearance that the story
begins to pick up:  they are hilarious, but also provide the film with
an unexpectedly vicious edge.  Under any other circumstances, Burton's
grotesqueries would come across as merely violent (I don't doubt that
many younger viewers in the session I attended gathered enough
material for a few week's worth of nightmares) but his idiosyncratic
goofiness still presides.  
It's very likely that MARS ATTACKS! won't be as funny as some
moviegoers would hope, nor provide the big-budget sci-fi thrills that
others may be expecting.  The main reason to see it is to behold
Burton at work, once again re-inventing the pop culture that defined
his childhood.  And of course, there is the appropriately stellar cast
he has assembled - as if he didn't have enough to contend with while
wreaking havoc on the planet he also has to juggle enough screen time
for the likes of Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan, Glenn Close, Annette
Bening, Rod Steiger, Michael J. Fox, Sarah Jessica Parker, Martin
Short, Danny de Vito, Tom Jones, Natalie Portman, and Joe Don Baker. 
It's amazing that the Martians even get a look-in - but they'll be who
you remember most afterwards.

Title
Review for Party, The (1968)
Peter Sellers and director Blake Edwards decided to take the Inspector 
Clouseau concept from their Pink Panther collaborations and run with it in 
this simple but funny cult comedy.  There is no real story, just a series of 
gags and routines that unfold within the confines of a swanky but dry 
Hollywood party.  Sellers removes the bumptious aspects of Clouseau and 
keeps the walking one-man-disaster premise for his creation Hrundi V. 
Bakshi, an Indian actor who finds himself accidentally invited to a 
producer's party after wreaking havoc on the set of his GUNGA DIN remake (he 
literally only gets three steps from the front door before things start 
going wrong).  Why Sellers elected to make his character Indian is a bit of 
a mystery as there is no reason for it in the story other than to make him a 
complete foreigner amongst the Hollywood set (you can spot the lines that 
were inserted to give his nationality some 'relevance').  I'd say that 
Sellers wanted to utilize his gift for mimicry and accents in a way he 
hadn't tried before, at least not for the length of a feature - for those of 
us raised on THE GOON SHOW his choice of role comes as no surprise.  It may 
be an odd choice but it works beautifully and we do not question it: if 
anything, it helps cement the notion in our mind that he and fellow outsider 
Claudine Longet (playing an aspiring French actress) belong together by the 
film's end.
Film has many funny gags but slides in a couple of places.  Sellers is best 
when he is on the move and liable to get himself into trouble - when he is 
seated at a dinner table halfway through the movie the action instead must 
transfer to a tipsy waiter.  Similarly, the slapstick gets more hysterical 
and less effective when Sellers disappears for much of the movie's final 
quarter - having characters repeatedly take pratfalls into a swimming pool 
is just plain lazy.  That's not to say the film still can't be enjoyed - 
it's just that you have to switch gears from watching a Peter Sellers film 
to watching a 60s time capsule (the finale has go-go dancing, a 
brightly-painted baby elephant, and a sea of soap bubbles).  Film isn't just 
for Sellers fans - kids will enjoy the gadget-laden house and relate to his 
child-like reactions to the problems he causes (he tries to hide the 
evidence or disappear from the scene).  The party hosts' house may remind 
you of the tacky, modernised home in Jacques Tati's MON ONCLE, just as 
Sellers may remind you of Tati's creation Monsieur Hulot.  Regular Edwards 
composer Henry Mancini provided the music, and yes, pop singer Longet - 
remember her kitsch-but-cute 'Love is Blue'? - does get to sing in her 
distinctive, sugary style.

Title
Review for Butch and Sundance: The Early Days (1979)
     How do you make a sequel to a film in which the two lead
characters have been gunned down in a shootout?  The answer, as 20th
Century Fox figured, is to make it a prequel.  Fox obviously felt there
was more dollar potential to be milked from their 1969 hit BUTCH
CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (a winner for stars Paul Newman and Robert
Redford), but it was another ten years before Allan Burns took up the
reins as scriptwriter and delivered this modest, good-humored western.
Realizing that it would be impossible for "name" stars to replace
Redford and Newman, the producers opted instead for relative newcomers
William Katt and Tom Berenger, who had previously featured in a dozen
films between them.  The result is enjoyable on every level--Laszlo
Kovac's location photography, easygoing performances by Katt (Sundance)
and Berenger (Cassidy), and the tidy directing job undertaken by
Richard Lester.  While THE EARLY DAYS has Lester's sure touch, it
doesn't look like a "typical" Lester effort--I suspect he decided to
forego his usual edgy, improvisational choreography after seeing
dailies of Kovac's beautifully photographed scenery.
     As the title suggests, the story is little more than a series of
adventures, recounting the meeting of Butch and Sundance and the start
of their friendship/partnership.  From scene one, however, you won't be
able to shake the feeling that Berenger is not trying to play the part
of Cassidy as much as he is trying to persuade us that he is Newman.
Wisely, the beginning of the film concentrates on his character so that
by the time Sundance appears we have accepted Berenger in the Cassidy
role.  We can enjoy watching their escapades once their rapport has
been established because this time, at least, we know that they will
not die.  And the screenplay thankfully avoids the trap of resorting to
Plan B: "When audience knows lead characters are in no danger, provide
loved ones or long-time friends to kill off in tragic manner."  Lester
and Burns come up with many quirky spins on familiar standards (this is
the only western I've seen with ski-ing in it!), including the bank
holdup, the gunfight, and, of course, the train robbery.  Most
redeeming feature of THE EARLY DAYS is that it does not try to be a
phoney epic or copy scenes of the film that spawned it, as most sequels
generally tend to do.  Lester similarly avoids making it nostalgic or
sentimental.  Film, like its predecessor, ends on a freeze-frame -
otherwise it resists any ironical in-jokes pointing to the 1969
production.  It exists on its own terms.  Favorite moment:  Cassidy's
hastily-invented nickname for the as-yet-unnamed Sundance.  Supporting
players include Brian Dennehy, Jill Eikenberry and Peter Weller
(introduced as La Force, their nemesis of the earlier film).

Title
Review for Heathers (1989)
You'd think that a comedy about a topic as touchy as teenage suicide
would be box-office poison, but check this one out anyway. HEATHERS is
a cool, sharp, satire about a group of high school seniors who make
the discovery that you can be more popular dead than alive.  Winona
Ryder is Veronica,a satellite member of an exclusive tripartite
sorority in an Ohio high school.  Enter Christian Slater (in Jack
Nicholson mode) as JD - Jason Dean, a rebel without a conscience - who
sees more potential in Ryder than just another member of a school
clique.  The confusing relationship between Veronica and JD is what
sets events in motion: although Ryder is appalled at what he does, she
can't fully extricate herself from his schemes.  And what are those
schemes exactly?  Even JD doesn't seem to know ("Chaos is great!" he
exhorts) and his phony family life offers only the most rudimentary of
clues.  But the universe of HEATHERS is too out of kilter for us to
have any concerns about Slater's character - it's easier to simply
accept him as an agent of change who has breezed into town.  JD knows
he is fatally flawed (which probably explains his affinity with
Captain Ahab), involved as he is with an anarchic quest which no-one
apart from Veronica seems capable of understanding.  It comes as no
surprise that his preoccupation with murder and suicide (which are
both the same thing to him) escalates into a self-destructive climax.
Potentially offensive subject matter is defused right from film's
opening - if you're willing to believe that three girls all
coincidentally named Heather are running their campus then you'll go
along with the notion of death as just another cruel high school
prank.  The cast play every scene straight, regardless of its absurd
or unnerving context - but it's also this neutrality (i.e. neither
truly scary or laugh-out-loud funny) that leaves me wanting somehow. 
On the plus side it does have several quotable lines and a supporting
role by Shannen Doherty (who would reprise her Bad Girl on Campus role
in TV's BEVERLY HILLS 90210) as the second 'Heather' in the pecking
order.  Film's big fan following is a little disquieting when you
realize that two girls were poisoned by their fourteen year old 'best
friend' who was copying the murders she'd seen on screen.  It makes me
wonder how prominently the revenge element of the film features as an
attraction for its fans.

Title
Review for Shine (1996)
True story of David Helfgott, a teenage pianist who won a scholarship
to The London Royal College of Music, had a nervous breakdown, and
returned home to Australia a forgotten recluse (although after the
Australian release of this film, the public showed a renewed interest
in him and he responded with a successful nationwide tour).  Three
actors play Helfgott - as a boy, a teenager, and an adult - but it's
the latter performance by Geoffrey Rush that's most absorbing.  How
much time did Rush and scriptwriter Jan Sardi spend with the real-life
Helfgott to capture his flustered, stream-of-consciousness speech so
naturally?  Rush's performance is such a powerhouse one (he doesn't
use a hand double for the piano-playing sequences) that it's easy to
overlook the similarly fine turns by his younger incarnations.  And
don't forget Scott Hicks' seamless directing job - it would be
tempting for any director to use the tormented-genius premise as an
excuse to go over the top, but Hicks keeps a tight rein on his story.
Emotional core of the film is harder to pin down - clearly it must be
Helfgott himself, but since he has been repressed by his father (Armin
Mueller-Stahl), a Polish Jew whose own father denied him access to a
musical instrument, he's not given to emotion easily (until his
wordless, memorable final scene on stage).  Also it's kind of
difficult to empathize with (a) mental instability, and (b) musical
genius.  The emotional focus of the story is instead directed toward
Helfgott.  Everyone he comes in contact with responds to him
positively; everybody loves him -  writer Katharine Prichard (Googie
Withers), his mentor Cecil Parkes (John Gielgud, still going strong),
his wife-to-be Gillian (Lynn Redgrave), and his family.  Despite all
the feel-good overtones, story never gets sappy, sentimental, or
manipulative.  Only point to consider after viewing is why no
explanation is offered for the cause of Helfgott's dysfunction.  Was
it simply too much strain that led to a mental collapse?  Were his
problems impressed on him from the start by his obssessive father? 
Was it purely medical in cause?  Or are we to be left with the
assumption that genius goes hand-in-glove with it's own special
madness?  As the film doesn't say one thing or another about any of
these possibilities it is the last one that might leave you with the
strongest impression, and since the expression `shine' is never
equated with Helfgott during the course of the film it's natural to
assume that it refers to the light of his talent which burned too
bright and too fast.  Or perhaps he `shone' because his father was
part Polish.  I know, I know.  I'm sorry... it was too hard to resist.

Title
Review for Mahler (1974)
Eighth and last of Ken Russell's composer biographies (I think its
safe enough to discount LISZTOMANIA), which I walked seven miles to
see as a teenager when it appeared in a one-off screening.  Film is
still as difficult to see nowadays, but undoubtedly of interest to
Russell fans.  Story recaps the life of Austrian Jew Gustav Mahler
(Robert Powell) while he takes one last Freudian train journey back to
Vienna with his wife Alma (Georgina Hale).  Film doesn't reach the
heights of other Russell opuses but is still more interesting than
most slick productions you'll see in the mainstream.  The main problem
with it is that Mahler himself isn't that interesting and doesn't lead
a particularly exceptional life.  Granted, he did find fame and
success as a conducter (and something of a monstre sacre) but the same
could be said about a novelist, and the idea of watching someone
writing a book for two hours doesn't appeal to me either.  Another
problem Russell has to contend with is Mahler's music - it doesn't
have the instant appeal of other composers he has handled, and is an
acquired taste to anyone unfamiliar with 20th century composition. 
Neither does it seem to choreograph well with Russell's images - it
doesn't inspire me to buy the soundtrack, anyway, which I presume is
part of the reason Russell wanted to make this film, i.e.  to pay
homage to an artist he admired while bringing his life and work to a
mass audience with the same pop sensibilities he would use the
following year in TOMMY.
Russell gives his film visual impetus to keep his audience watching -
apart from the framing device of the train, MAHLER is made up almost
wholly of dream sequences, fantasies, and offbeat set-pieces.  But it
all seems flat this time around.  Maybe that's because many of the
heavily symbolic, hallucinatory images are immediately followed by
postscripts in which the characters explain to each other what we have
just watched.  However, I can also see this as Russell's way of
defusing accusations that he is being pretentious.  The most jarring
of these sequences is Mahler's conversion to Catholicism, filmed as if
it were a silent comedy (Russell himself is a Catholic convert, which
may explain his interest in this part of Mahler's life).  As a
stand-alone sequence it's a lot of fun, but it looks like it was
dropped in from a different movie.  MAHLER's preponderance with
visuals also reminds us that Russell is more of a technical director
than an actor's director.  His characters all sound alike - it's
obviously Russell dialogue that they're speaking.  Hale, as Alma, has
to switch from petulant to sweet to hardened to despairing, while
Powell just looks like a gloomy guy in a hat.  The logic behind
Powell's saturnine performance is explained at the end, when we
discover he has tonsillitis (a precursor to his death shortly after),
but by then it's too late for us to really care.
Still, Russell has enthusiasm, and does well with a limited budget
(instead of filming in Europe he once again returned to his favorite
location, the Lake District).  Mahler's daughter Anna, who was 70 at
the time of film's release, gave Russell permission to make his
biography after initial reservations about what he'd done with
Tchaikovsky in THE MUSIC LOVERS.

Title
Review for Tremors (1990)
     Remember that game you played as a kid, when you tried to walk
across, or around a room without touching the floor; or made it a
mission to get from one place to another without stepping on any part
of a "forbidden" zone?  That primal consciousness is, I believe, what
makes this film so instantly appealing to its fans.
     Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are two jacks of all trades who own a
pickup truck and little else, drifting from one job to another in the
small desert town of Perfection.  Meanwhile, a visiting seismologist is
investigating mysterious disturbances in the ground.  As it transpires,
these are not caused by earthquakes but earthworms, and big ones at
that.  Worse, these worms are predators, which detect their prey by the
vibrations of their footsteps.  It doesn't take long before Bacon,
Ward, and co. figure out what is going on, from which point the story
becomes the struggle for survival that we've seen in countless monster
movies before--with one major twist.  Most movies of this type (THE
THING, THE BIRDS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, et al) invariably hole up
the protagonists in a restricted location, which they defend against
the attacking hordes.  TREMORS turns this on its head: the characters
are not confined by the walls of some makeshift sanctuary, but by the
vast Nevada desert landscape itself, which they can't even set foot
on.  In fact, any contact with the ground is a bad move, so they end up
ON the buildings, not in them.  Most of the second half of the film
involves this assorted handful of characters arguing about their
predicament and hopscotching from one 'safe' zone to the next.
     There is no explanation for the creatures (their origins are
discussed arbitrarily in one brief dialogue exchange) and they seem
smaller-scale country cousins to the sandworms in DUNE (which are also
attracted by vibrations), but the film-makers never make their
creations laughable, or thankfully, their characters
disposable--there's no stock 'bad guy' amongst them for the
scriptwriters to sacrifice to the monsters; and it's fun watching the
can-do approach they take to their bizarre situation.  Film's highlight
for the gun crowd will be the scene in which two survivalist fanatics
unload nearly their entire arsenal into one of the attacking
creatures.  The desert setting, drowsy and stultifying on the surface,
is used to good effect, and Bacon and Ward give effortless performances
that match this to "Perfection."  Snappy pacing and canny writing make
this more than just a B picture.  Film's major problem was trying to
sell the idea of giant earthworms as effective movie monsters. Also
with: Michael Gross (from TV's FAMILY TIES), and Ariana Richards as a
pogo-stick hopping tyke, who'd later graduate from being terrorized by
giant worms to giant dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK.  Some kids have all
the luck.

Title
Review for Fast Company (1979)
While FAST COMPANY appears to be an unremarkable racing picture to the 
casual viewer, it's of some interest to film buffs because it is a most 
unusual entry in the oeuvre of horror director David Cronenberg.  If you 
were unaware of his filmography, you'd probably think that this was his 
debut feature - it certainly has that New World Pictures look about it, as 
if Cronenberg was part of the stable of up-and-coming film-makers recruited 
by Roger Corman during the 70s.  Its B-movie elements are also supplemented 
by a soundtrack of original rock tunes (which sound like a mixture of Bob 
Seger and Bruce Springsteen) and co-starring roles from exploitation 
regulars John Saxon and Claudia Jennings. 
The vehicles driven in FAST COMPANY are drag cars - fuelers and funny cars - 
which are an unusual subject for a film because their races are over as soon 
as they've begun, leaving little in the way of visuals.  It's this 
blink-and-you'll-miss-it factor that influences the documentary look of the 
racetrack scenes.  The cars look like hunched predators ready to strike, 
roaring, shuddering, and spitting fire as if they were machine-gunning each 
other.  They run not on gas, but a mixture of nitro and alcohol, and their 
edgy jockeying for position gives us the feeling of an imminent explosion - 
which their sudden, furious bursts of speed become.  Throughout, we're 
waiting for the crash that must be coming.  Racetracks generally make good 
metaphors for the film characters that inhabit them, but there's no endless 
looping around a static circuit in FAST COMPANY.  The short bursts of speed 
- their preparation, buildup and release - would fasten themselves easily 
enough to repressed, inarticulate characters, but paradoxically the drivers 
in FAST COMPANY are likeable and easy-going.  As the protagonist Lonnie 
'Lucky Man' Johnson, William Smith doesn't display any passion for racing.  
Instead he's simply resigned to spending his life on wheels, whether racing 
or in his lavish trailer (when he has conversations with people they always 
take place in or around vehicles).  This is America, as evidenced by the 
constant red-white-blue coloring of the film, and car culture is the thing 
that it's built on.  Cronenberg, who took on the project because of his 
interest in motor racing, doesn't attempt any of the body/machine collisions 
he is famous for in his work, but is settles for a more purely psychological 
approach: that in a motorized, mechanized age, those who make their livings 
around machines become consumed by them. 
There's little to distinguish FAST COMPANY from other speedway films, 
B-movie or otherwise, but it's still agreeable viewing and has a few 
interesting moments.  Somewhat uncharacteristically, Jennings is the only 
female member of the cast to keep her clothes on.  This would turn out to be 
her last film - ironically she would die behind the wheel in a car crash 
soon afterwards.  Cronenberg, of course, would go on to direct CRASH several 
years later, the seeds perhaps already having been sown by this earlier 
project.  As it turned out, FAST COMPANY became a victim of legal problems 
and the film's cinema release lasted about as long its drag races. 

Title
Review for Damned River (1989)
1972's DELIVERANCE was pretty much the last word on 
civilization-vs-wilderness pictures, but this didn't discourage many 
imitations.  In this one, four friends travel to Africa for a week-long 
rafting vacation down the Zambesi.  Their brusque guide Raymond (Stephen 
Shellen) treats them at first with indifference, then contempt.  As the 
water gets wilder, so does Raymond - he snaps at his passengers and then 
snaps in his mind.  Yes, the storyline is standard exploitation (or 
raftploitation?) fare but tries for better.  Shellen has a few good lines 
and heŐs amusing when yelling abuse at the rafting party without regard 
about how they might be 'feeling' about the whole experience (you get the 
impression that this was written by river guides as a revenge fantasy for 
every this-wasn't-in-the-brochure whining customer they've had to take on 
board).  Cinematography (all filmed on location in Zimbabwe) is good, and 
director Michael Schroeder makes an effort to keep things visually 
interesting:
Weight of film falls on Shellen's shoulders, and he does a reasonable job.  
It makes sense that we're supposed to link Shellen with the wilderness as a 
contrast to the controlled behavior of his passengers, but he seems trapped 
in a middle zone, neither truly natural/savage enough to belong completely 
to the river nor domestic/ethical enough to belong with the others of his 
party.  Note that Shellen follows every unexpected or violent act with an 
explanation, excuse, or justification.  Clearly the moral code he operates 
on is completely his own - that's why I don't think this film works at any 
potential allegorical level.  It's easy enough to explain Shellen's behavior 
by passing him off as a confused war veteran, but when his passengers refuse 
to fight fire with fire ("we're better than him") the film only makes a 
statement about one individual rather than a general human condition.  I 
know this kind of conjecture seems a little overwrought for this type of 
movie, but that's what makes DAMNED RIVER interesting.  I like the idea 
underpinning the film - that a group of people are forced to depend entirely 
on someone erratic and dangerous - and it would have paid to highlight this 
angle in deference to letting Shellen go over the top so soon.  With a 
tighter script DAMNED RIVER could have been considerably better; with any 
less production value it could have been a lot worse.  It's an exploitation 
film that doesn't come across as an exploitation film, but it doesn't really 
make it to 'legit' status either.  Film is like its central character, 
trapped in a middle zone.  As river movies go, it would rate a Class 3.  
That's somewhere between THE RIVER WILD and RACE FOR YOUR LIFE, CHARLIE 
BROWN.  And just for the record, crocodile does *not* taste like chicken.  
Who keeps spreading this stuff around?

Review for Return of the Living Dead, The (1985)
Dan O'Bannon, whose scripts always show inventive moments and wry humor, 
finally got the chance to direct with this suitably offbeat horror 
movie.  Part inspired by the zombie films initiated by George A. Romero, 
RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD elaborates wildly upon its predecessors.  This 
isn't a sequel - it's a reinventing of how zombies had been seen on the 
screen up to that point.  Story starts in a medical supplies warehouse 
(already, you begin to think "uh-oh") where newcomer Freddy is told by 
his supervisor the "truth" behind Romero's film NIGHT OF THE LIVING 
DEAD.  Sure enough, curiosity leads to meddling, and before you can say 
"Braaaaiinns..", the dead have been reanimated and Freddy and his 
dropout buddies are surrounded by a horde of ghouls.  
Film uses the 'siege' scenario of the Romero stories, but ironically its 
protagonists shelter in different storehouses of death - the warehouse, 
a cemetary, a crematorium, and a mortuary.  The dead are outside, in the 
land of the living; the living have barricaded themselves in the domain 
of the dead.  O'Bannon keeps playing with this intermediary zone until 
we can't remember any difference between a living body that is slowly 
turning undead or a dead body that is struggling back to life.  To blur 
the line further, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD's zombies don't act like the 
lethargic, green-hued somnambulists of other films that so distinctly 
separate themselves from their human victims.  These zombies talk, move 
adeptly, and get organized. Added to that, several characters in the 
film aren't your normal band of sympathetic protagonists - their 
eccentricity, vulgarity, or nihilism doesn't make us care too much 
whether they join the ranks of the undead or not (with the exception of 
one girl-next-door type whose association with her friends seems very 
unlikely).
RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD was a revelation at the time - its style has 
been much imitated since, though it owes a debt to the hip, humorous 
horror of AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON.  It manages the unlikely feat 
of turning a zombie film into an action piece; its demented plot veers 
in almost any direction right up until its conclusion.  Picture has 
everything you could in a zombie flick: splatter, rock music, and scream 
queen Linnea Quigley (who has surely fought more monsters than any other 
actor in living memory).


Title
Review for Last Unicorn, The (1982)
Thoughtful animated fantasy may be too wordy for some children but
should appeal to kids who read.  It's a little slow at the start but
worth sticking with.  The last unicorn of the title (voiced by Mia
Farrow) is searching for others of her kind.  She believes the answer
lies in a rundown castle near the sea.  This is the standard `quest'
material that most fantasy is made of, but in this case heroics and
spectacle are secondary to drama, which may explain the presence of
big names in the cast.  Alan Arkin, Jeff Bridges (who would play an
animated character of a different kind the same year in TRON),
Christopher Lee, Tammy Grimes, Angela Lansbury, Keenan Wynn, and
Robert Klein all voice characters that have a passing resemblance to
their real selves.  The animation, produced in Japan, isn't on a par
with Disney, and the female characters have those irritating oversized
eyes that are symptomatic of anime figures, but it holds up.  Story
has many original touches and deals with love, regret, myth versus
reality, and it's major theme, the subjectivity of truth.  Unlike most
animated films, this one doesn't throw in slapstick or comedy relief
(although Arkin has some light moments). Every character bears some
form of loss - unconsciously they join the unicorn on quests of their
own to look beyond illusion and archetype.  Not all of them find what
they're looking for.  Film doesn't handle these ideas in an
exclusively adult way (it still comes across as a children's cartoon),
and makes pleasant family viewing.  I can imagine it being watched at
home by mothers and their daughters during school holidays. Peter S.
Beagle adapted his own novel for the screen - he was also responsible
for the difficult task of adapting THE LORD OF THE RINGS for Ralph
Bakshi a few years earlier.  Pop group America perform Jimmy Webb's
songs and help add to the story's wistful mood.   Directed by the team
of Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr who had previously worked together
for ten years producing animated features for television.

Title
Review for Donner Party, The (1992)
Absorbing documentary by Ric Burns follows the format of his
successful television series THE CIVIL WAR and tells its story through
the use of old letters, diaries, sepia-tone photographs, maps,
paintings, and commentaries by writers/historians.  It's to Burns'
credit that he can sustain this approach for nearly an hour and a half
- but then his subject matter is entirely engrossing.  Film traces the
progress west of the 1846 wagon train that became known as the Donner
Party, which, after a terrible journey, became snowed in at the
foothills of the Sierra Nevada.
While it is the trek's gruesome outcome that people are mostly
familiar with, the Party's many hardships and dramas en route to
California are equally gripping.  There is enough material to fill a
movie script of epic proportions.  Curiously, the static appearance of
the film's frames (the only motion Burns allows is from the elements -
water, fire, clouds, and snow) may cause you to visualize your own
'action' and 'actors' and 'dialogue' as it goes on.  This distant, yet
respectful, approach has an authority which enables us to react to the
emotional core of the story without feeling as manipulated as we might
by a sensationalized Hollywood script (I know I shouldn't laugh in a
couple of places, but there're a couple of narrated footnotes that are
either too ironic or bizarre to resist).  As in his earlier work,
Burns employs actors to provide voice-overs for the various true-life
emigrants (Amy Madigan, Timothy Hutton, and Eli Wallach, but to name a
few).  It's one of a number of 'medley' devices he weaves together to
keep our attention from flagging, which also include his pan-scans of
photographs (many of which are shown repeatedly) and frequent
background music (ranging from languid Spanish guitars to brooding
themes from TWIN PEAKS' Angelo Badalamenti).  Keep an eye out for it.

Title
Review for Mister Johnson (1991)
It took director Bruce Beresford 25 years to get this project off the
ground.  Intelligent, sensitively-handled drama (based on Joyce
Carey's novel) is set in West Africa during the days of Britain's
empire-building.  It features a standout performance by Maynard
Eziashi in the title role as an Nigerian clerk working for the British
government in the village of Fada.  Johnson's eagerness to be accepted
as an English gentleman by his country's new landlords is a phenomenon
observable in several colonized provinces throughout history.  It's
also the kind of compromise that can only lead to misunderstanding
from both cultures.  The irrepressible, entrepreneurial Johnson is a
dreamer, who thinks big enough not only to see himself as a rich,
respectable businessman, but also to embrace the ambition of his
district officer (Pierce Brosnan) to build a 100-mile road.  The
completion of the road, which will make the Empire's civilizing'
processes even easier, tells us that the end of the village's (and
Africa's) innocence is nigh.  It's the kind of imperialism that we
instinctively blame for Johnson's downfall - but looking back we can
see that the real villain of the film is commerce.  Every scrape that
Johnson gets into is less a result of cultural clash than simple
mismanagement of money, and it's not only the British that he gets
into trouble with.  The opportunistic, ingenuous Johnson is just the
type we would expect to fall foul of the law, whether native or
British, as a matter of course.
Beresford seems to be drawn to assignments set in desolate landscapes,
and here he convincingly transports us to the 1923 colonies.  As would
be expected, he gets solid performances from Eziashi, Brosnan (whose
repressed character demands he be underplayed), and Edward Woodward as
a local store owner (more memorable here than in Beresford's BREAKER
MORANT).  There are several scenes you'll react to on an emotional
level - the quietly triumphant completion of the road and the
unforgettable final scene are the two most notable examples.  The
dusky photography by Peter James suits the film perfectly.  Definitely
worth your time - critics applauded it even though it sank without a
trace at the box office.   If it wasn't for the success of his
previous film, DRIVING MISS DAISY, Beresford may never have been able
to convince backers to produce a film featuring an unknown black actor
in the lead role.  Incidentally, this must be the only film I've seen
set in an African village that doesn't wind up with someone's house
burning down.

Title
Review for Cube (1997)
The less you know about this one beforehand, the better: avoid all video 
slicks, talkative friends, and careless reviewers.  This is engrossing 
science fiction that, once seen, is not easily forgotten.  In fact it really 
should be seen only once and then left to linger for years in the memory.  
Story opens with a group of strangers awakening to find themselves in a 
square room with identical doors set in the walls, floor, and ceiling.  Each 
door in turn leads to another room of the same design.  It's tempting to 
think that because each character has been roused from sleep CUBE is merely 
a dream or hallucination, but no: its story generates tension because what 
happens to the people in it is horribly real despite the absence of any 
rationale.  We are put in the characters' place, unaware of the meaning of 
the scenario while trying to puzzle it out as best we can.  But there's 
little time for us to think independently - the screenplay (by Andre 
Bijelic, Graeme Manson, and director Vincenzo Natali) moves us along at a 
relentless pace.  The claustrophobic setting and faceless appearance of each 
character (they wear drab prison outfittings) become hypnotic after a while; 
because they do nothing but move, sleep, and die it's about as purely 
existential an experience as you can find in cinema.  The writers are smart 
enough not to have their characters pontificate on these themes however - 
the premise does well enough alone without having 'meaningful' dialogue 
thrown in to remind us what it stands for.  As would be expected, there is 
the usual cross-grouping of character types to provide confrontation, but 
even these provide no anchor for our viewing sensibilities - characters 
change, sometimes in an instant.  Heroes, villains, defeatists, and 
pragmatists all switch among each other - every character in turn is brave, 
fearful, angry, and calm.  Only one thing is certain - every one of them is 
expendable.
Film has many offbeat, humorous lines and moments but is also unbearably 
tense at times - we are alerted early into the film that the labyrinth is a 
sadistic death trap.  One scene, in which there is no sound for several 
minutes, is unbearable to watch in a cinema (and strange as it may seem - 
given the limiting nature of its sets - this really is a film to be seen in 
a cinema).  Yet the major irony of the story is that the characters 
brutalize each other more than the sinister machinations of the Cube - in 
fact this is taken to excess near the film's conclusion, and is the only 
misstep the screenwriters make.  Otherwise CUBE is a perfect blend of 
thought and action.  You can sense the devilish fun that Natali and friends 
must have had assembling their intricate game - was this dreamed up by a 
frustrated Rubik's Cube owner??  Sensibly, the impressive effects are used 
only when needed.  Wonderfully edited, photographed, and directed 
(especially considering the limitations of the setting).  The cast, who 
provide the humanity - and inhumanity - central to our involvement with the 
story, command our attention on screen.  It's hard to say who stands out, 
but my pick would be Nicole de Boer (as a student who makes maths look 
pretty cool and exciting!), a determined Maurice Dean Wint, and Andrew 
Miller, as the least likely companion of the others).


Title
Review for Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, The (1980)
The Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle (1980) 104m.
One of two documentaries about seminal punk rock band the Sex Pistols 
released in 1980, one year after singer Sid Vicious died of a heroin 
overdose (the other being Lech Kowalski's D.O.A.).  If you didn't know 
anything about their rise to fame you'd swear you were watching a SPINAL 
TAP-style spoof on a fictional band.  That's because first-time 
writer/director Julien Temple treats his subject with wild, footloose
humor.  He mixes fictional narrative, archival footage, animated 
sequences, offbeat characters, and video clips of the band's most 
well-known songs.  Before the end the film's reflexivity is layered on a 
little too thick, part of the reason why some viewers may find it 
tiresome.  Others will just find it unwatchable, either because of
the film's puerile approach (the sex, profanity, and violence will 
ensure that it's never shown on television) or because of the subject 
matter itself.  Others may object to it on principle: that Pistols 
manager-cum-shyster Malcolm McLaren is having a big laugh at everyone's 
expense.  McLaren begins the film by enumerating the steps to make money 
through exploitation and demonstrates how he was able
to manufacture a phenomenon from scratch.  The swindle' isn't only 
perpetrated on record companies that were duped (for a time) but also on 
consumers that bought into a trend that was arguably either anticipated 
or entirely fabricated by McLaren.
For those unfamiliar with the McLaren/Pistols story, SWINDLE provides an 
insightful primer: it pointedly illustrates the role of music in the 
music industry - i.e. it is negligible.  Here is a document that proves 
all the cynics right - that it is only product that matters.  McLaren is 
completely at ease before the camera, making us even
more distrustful of him.  He admits his ulterior motives with such 
cheerfulness that we get the feeling we can't believe anything he says, 
even when he's letting us in on his formula for success (his ten-point 
plan looks like it has been constructed retrospectively and not 
conceived beforehand).  Film's wackiness gets labored in the last 
fifteen minutes or so.  Really, it would have been just as funny if 
Temple had played it straight and let this absurd story speak for itself 
(for example, when the Pistols played their first US tour, McLaren sent 
them straight to the heart of redneck country).  The Pistols' music 
actually holds up pretty well.  Or is that a sign that new trends sound 
even worse?


Title
Review for High Wind in Jamaica, A (1965)
An excellent adaptation of Richard Hughes' novel, and one of my
all-time favorite films.  If you've ever wondered what might have
happened to the Lost Boys if they'd left Neverland and taken up with
the pirates then this one-of-a-kind drama may show you some
possibilities.  An English family living in Jamaica decides to return
home after a hurricane destroys their house; also, the mother of the
family believes her children have lost the civilizing influence of
life in England.  The children barely make it out to sea before they
inadvertently end up on a freebooters' ship, captained by Anthony
Quinn and first mate James Coburn, from which point on the storyline
moves in quite unexpected directions.
Story is not told exclusively from the point of view of either the
adults or children, but rather from the ambiguous area where both
viewpoints meet in conflict.  We accept that each character's behavior
is completely rational (partly because we recognize the conventions of
adult life and still remember the world of childhood) but the
characters themselves fail to comprehend each others' differing world
views.  It's this conflict that eventually creates a strange power
play on board ship between the pirates and the children.  The sailors'
superstitions and fears become realized through the games and antics
of the youngsters - placed within a different context their innocent
capering takes on new, ominous dimensions - and it isn't long before
the entire crew is on edge.  Soon there is mutiny in the air.
Quinn and Coburn make great pirates, but it's Deborah Baxter as Emily
who you'll really remember - whatever happened to her?  Emily's
concerned eyes and searching expression tell us more about what's
going on inside her head than any other character: here is a girl who
is uncertainly taking the first steps into that nebulous zone between
childhood and adulthood - this voyage could be interpreted literally
as her rite of passage.  As this area is where the film's perspective
lies it could be that we are approaching the story from her viewpoint.
Unbelievably, one recent television screening cut the scene in which
Emily sits aloft with legs astride the mast, singing a love song while
the Captain gazes up at her.  Surely the sexual subtext in this scene
was too subtle to warrant it being censored - without it, the film's
final moments lose their real meaning: Emily, like Jenny Agutter at
the conclusion of WALKABOUT, looks back on a strange, dreamlike event
in her life and wonders if she has lost something, yet gained
something because of it.  Film's narrative is constantly engaging. 
Director Alexander Mackendrick handles the intelligent screenplay with
a deft touch that keeps the film from self-consciously recognizing
it's own offbeat quality.  Harmonica player Larry Adler wrote the
score, which makes good use of swoony, seductive Spanish themes and
contributes even further to the dislocated overall effect of the film.

Title
Review for Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965)
Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) 83m.
One of those rare things: A movie that is as good as its title.  However, 
such is its fame that first-time viewers may be expecting more than it can 
deliver.  The first time I saw it was at a double-bill with UP! which played 
to half a dozen people.  My second viewing, a few years later, was at a film 
festival with a full house.  What a difference an audience makes!
Russ Meyer's drive-in classic had considerable impact on many viewers back 
in '65 (among them cult director John Waters) but didn't get a stronger 
international presence until the early 80s, when cinema buffs who had seen 
B-Grade and Z-Grade films as youngsters began championing their favorite 
films in print.  What Meyer did to make his film so memorable was to 
transfer the film-making sensibilities he had developed in his earlier 
exploitation films to the limitations of commercial cinema, reshaping the 
B-movie and introducing his independent streak to new audiences.  As well as 
disregarding the conventions of studio pictures he also abandoned many of 
his own trademarks, among them flashbacks, flash-forwards, rapid 
intercutting, wraparound narration and fetishistic inserts of props.  
Perversely, the removal of nudity and sex - one of Meyer's most obvious 
selling points - gave the film-makers greater freedom, not less: without the 
distraction of obligatory flesh scenes Meyer and co-writer Jack Moran were 
able to keep the events on screen in service of the story.
In a gender reversal of Meyer's previous film MOTOR PSYCHO, PUSSYCAT opens 
with three free-spirited go-go dancers speeding their sports cars along a 
desert road (this image seems to endorse the film's title from the outset) 
where they meet a young couple performing time trials on a makeshift 
racetrack.  Varla, the leader of the trio (the role that established Tura 
Satana's place in cult history) provokes the boyfriend of petite, 
Gidget-like Susan Bernard into a fight which turns ugly.  The gals flee the 
racetrack, taking Bernard with them, only to find themselves on the property 
of a misanthropic old man and his two sons.  The rest of the film is a rondo 
of lechery, betrayals, bitching and plotting, as the volatile personalities 
of the assorted players all strive to outfox each other.
It's the women of PUSSYCAT (Satana, Lori Williams and Meyer regular Haji) 
that provide the basis for its fan following - they are assertive, brash, 
sexually uninhibited and as tough as nails, and in a post-1966 climate of 
political correctness they celebrate all that is 'right' about being 
'wrong'.  Satana steals the show as the constantly vicious, karate-chopping 
Varla, but interestingly, the more vulnerable Bernard is equally as 
memorable.  Dwarfed by the three Amazons that have abducted her, Bernard is 
convincing in a role that requires her to be constantly traumatized.  She 
also provides the film with its time element: everything is contingent upon 
an escape from what has become her nightmare.  Her attempts to run and 
reason her way out meet with failure each time, and only by confronting the 
story's 'monster' head on is she able to bring her ordeal to an end.
There's more to the central casting of PUSSYCAT than the attributes of its 
leading ladies, however - Meyer knew that he would be able to get away with 
much more in the story if he made the 'car club' female.  Consider the 
alternative response if it had been a male trio that had kidnapped the 
small, defenseless Bernard and put her through hell.  In fact, it's all 
something of a con: apart from a couple of seduction scenes, the women's 
roles in PUSSYCAT could be switched to men's with hardly any change of 
dialogue (in much the same way that Sigourney Weaver's role in ALIEN was 
originally written for a male lead).  To enforce the strength of the women, 
Meyer emasculates the men in the film by making them witless, bookish and 
disabled; furthermore the women kill and maim in distinctly male/phallic 
ways (using knives and cars) and all but one of the murders in the film are 
committed by women.  And then of course, there's that dialogue, made up 
almost entirely of double entendres and vicious putdowns - the dinner table 
scene is more shamelessly smutty than any other mealtime gathering you're 
likely to have seen.  In spite of all this, PUSSYCAT never come across as 
sleazy - at no point do you feel uncomfortably exposed to a low-rent 
exploitation flick.  Instead PUSSYCAT looks like a B-movie that somehow 
slipped sideways into cinemas through a crack that nobody had noticed at the 
time.  That opening has since sealed itself shut, so we can count ourselves 
fortunate that films like this live on to be viewed today.

Title
Review for Miami Blues (1990)
In George Armitage's adaptation of Charles Willeford's novel, Alec
Baldwin plays a wanted ex-con whose devil-may-care attitude
surprisingly hasn't yet led to his capture.  Upon reaching Miami he
meets up with ingenue hooker Jennifer Jason Leigh, adopts her as his
fiancee, and sets about supplementing their income with a string of
petty thefts.  Upon acquiring the cuffs, badge, and other
accouterments of cop Fred Ward, he discovers that larceny has never 
been easier.  Disarming black comedy-drama stands out among others in
the pack because its offbeat plot turns make it hard for the viewer to
match a rhythm to it.  The sex scene we all expect comes earlier than
expected, the initial meeting between Baldwin and Ward isn't how we
anticipate it, and Baldwin, the prime proponent of the film's
randomness, does not move to a predictable plan - he is psychotic
enough to kill on a whim, yet never rises above purse-snatching and
break-ins.  What's interesting is that while Baldwin is the cause of
so much random violence towards others, he is at the same time the
victim of spontaneous, violent acts.  It's not surprising that his
dismissive attitude treats everything as if it were a game: Baldwin
roleplays confrontations with himself (a la TAXI DRIVER), lies
continually, plays cop as soon as he gets hold of a badge, and plays
house with Leigh, whom he tells "Call me Junior".  It's an appropriate
nickname, and Leigh is a suitably ditzy companion for him.
In one picture-postcard scene, Baldwin and Leigh watch couples happily
playing with a frisbee against a Miami beach sunset.  No sooner have
the two of them set up house than they are playing with a frisbee
outside on the front lawn.  When Leigh, with an older and wiser glint
in her eye, tosses the frisbee aside at the film's conclusion, she,
for one, knows that the dream is over.  Unlike Junior, Ward,
world-weary and only one week from retirement, manages to finish what
he started.  Ward and his world are mundane and orderly, and the
antithesis of Baldwin, a character out of sync in a world out of sync.
 While convention dictates that the cop and his quarry remain separate
for the bulk of the film we nevertheless feel a connection between
them.  Their dinner together, in which Baldwin is cagey but jumpy, and
Ward is either dumb or just playing dumb, is a highlight.  Baldwin's
character is always interesting (how many films have you seen where
the criminal accompanies a house burglary with an improvisational
haiku?), Leigh somehow manages to play superficiality with a sense of
depth, and Ward fits into his role effortlessly.  Weird coincidence:
Baldwin steals a badge and passes himself off as "Sergeant Mosely". 
Two years earlier in MIDNIGHT RUN, Robert De Niro steals a badge as
passes himself off as "Agent Mosely".  Has anybody else noticed this?

Title
Review for Kirlian Witness, The (1978)
A woman is found dead - apparently murdered - on a rooftop.  Her sister 
(Nancy Snyder), unsatisfied with the official police findings, pursues 
inquiries of her own.  Here's what makes the rest of this genre piece 
different: her key witness is a potted plant.  It sounds like a joke, but 
the story handles its premise seriously.  Aware of the importance of 
suspending the audience's disbelief, first-time writer/director Jonathon 
Sarno provides a skeptical husband (Joel Kolodner) to voice our own doubts 
about Snyder's investigation as it progresses.  Does it make the story more 
believable if the central character is a woman?  I'd say that it was 
definitely a conscious choice of the film-makers, although it suggests the 
underlying message that women are more receptive to a broader view of 
science and nature than men.  Personally I don't see THE KIRLIAN WITNESS 
reaching any conclusions about polygraphs, telepathy, or Kirlian photography 
as a forensic methodology: ultimately, the circumstances of Snyder's 
investigation can be boiled down to hypothesis and autosuggestion.  It's an 
underplayed distraction to what really matters - that Kolodner and fellow 
murder suspect Ted Laplat become drawn into a paranoia that finds themselves 
believing in the occult and contributing to their downfall (the film's 
alternate title was THE PLANTS ARE WATCHING).  THE KIRLIAN WITNESS may be 
more a new-agey Poe update than a film about Gaia or cosmic communion.
Sarno is smart enough to keep the tone of his film quiet; the unspoken joke 
is that characters communicate better with plants than between themselves.  
It's hard trying to pin down how they relate to each other - their roles as 
sister, husband, friend, or employee are non-specific.  They don't even seem 
overly upset at the deaths that occur in the story (note that the violence 
towards plants is handled with just as much attention as that of the human 
characters).  With the exception of Laplat, who has some good exchanges with 
Kolodner, the novice cast doesn't give a performance that promises film 
careers - at least Sarno got Hollywood veteran Lawrence Tierney on board in 
a supporting role.  Film was marketed as a horror picture, although it is 
really an alternative take on crime thrillers.  The economical storyline 
provides only two suspects, but delivers a satisfying conclusion.  
Coincidentally 1978 also saw the release of the documentary THE SECRET LIFE 
OF PLANTS, better known by its Stevie Wonder soundtrack, which made the top 
ten.  The book of the same name can be glimpsed in Sarno's film.

Review for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)
Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) 92m.
In NEVER BEEN KISSED, Drew Barrymore played a writer posing as a student in 
high school to research a story.  In real life, 22-year old Cameron Crowe 
(later a writer-director himself) spent a year undercover' in a San Diego 
high school doing the same thing.  The resulting book and film, FAST TIMES, 
could easily have been written without recourse to such methods (maybe 
Cameron was just feeling nostalgic) but it's still one of the best of an 
undernourished genre.  Besides Crowe, you also have director Amy Heckerling 
and the quality cast to thank, several of whom went on to establish durable 
screen careers (You don't usually find an ensemble like Sean Penn, Phoebe 
Cates, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Rheinhold in most teen campus flicks).
Ostensibly a comedy, FAST TIMES grounds itself in reality and avoids the 
hi-jinks route that cripples many of its not-so-smart imitators.  If it is 
the intention of Crowe's script to hold a mirror up to contemporary high 
school students and show us their lives, then the absence of a contrived 
storyline is a good decision.  It's the lack of plot that makes this film 
repeatable viewing  if anything, FAST TIME improves a second time around 
because its fluctuating tone doesn't subvert your expectations.  The diverse 
characters wend their way through a collage of set pieces, retaining 
credibility  without coming across as stereotypes.  Even the film's most 
overt character, Sean Penn's spaced-out surfer dude Jeff Spicoli, seems 
naturally drawn (he pretty much established the archetype with this 
performance).  His dialogues with the dogmatic History teacher Mr Hand (Ray 
Walston) are the film's most enjoyable moments, leaving Jennifer Jason 
Leigh's character to carry the burden of FAST TIMES' downbeat side.  We 
watch Leigh go through one miserable sexual/romantic encounter after 
another, but at least her advice from the more experienced Cates is 
juxtaposed with Brian Backer's coaching from Robert Romanus to some humorous 
effect (after being told to use Led Zeppelin for make-out music, Backer 
plays the ominous, booming  Zep track Kashmir' on his car stereo).  
Surprisingly, the frequent discussions about sex are more blunt and crude 
when coming from the girls.  That doesn't mean these scenes are used for 
cheap laughs: FAST TIMES works well because we have the sense that, like 
Crowe, we are listening in.
FAST TIMES seemed worthy of attention in the early 80s because it hit the 
screen at about the time it looked like there was going to be a new wave of 
female directors (i.e. Susan Seidelman, Penelope Spheeris, and Martha 
Coolidge).  This didn't really happen, but the film seems to have made an 
impression on many viewers (although the main memory of anyone I've ever 
spoken to seems to be of Cates shedding her bikini top).  Nowadays the 
film's popularity is assured by fans who saw the film in cinemas when they 
were in high school themselves and have since claimed it as their 80s 
photograph album.  Even a moment as simple as Judge Rheinhold bopping to the 
radio while washing his car seems to be a perfectly-captured snapshot.  The 
great soundtrack is a bonus  though curiously the music itself doesn't date 
the film as much as its references to the likes of Pat Benatar and Cheap 
Trick.

Title
Review for Aria (1987)
This collection of operatic arias as interpreted by nine different 
directors (ten if you count Bill Bryden's linking story) was producer 
Don Boyd's personal project.  He was understandably anxious about its 
reception but should have realized that only the idea behind his film 
can be deemed a success or a failure - as a work itself, it is so 
diverse in nature that it can only be evaluated piecemeal: it becomes 
just as interesting an exercise in criticism as it is in film-making.
To summarize: Nicolas Roeg's segment replays an obscure moment in 
European history and comes of as nothing much more than a curiosity; 
Charles Sturridge's images of children trapped in an adult world 
complement the numinous aria accompanying them; Godard is just as 
irritating as ever, though he at least should be commended for proving 
that a professional piece of film can be created with a minimal 
production crew; Bruce Beresford's contribution, in which virtually 
nothing happens, is probably the most disposable entry; Julien Temple 
choreographs a bedroom farce to Verdi's 'Rigoletto'; Robert Altman, in a 
moment of pure perversity, shows us not the theatrical event but the 
audience watching that event (the joke wears thin pretty quickly); Franc 
Roddam expertly transplants the doomed lovers Tristan and Isolde into 
contemporary Las Vegas; Ken Russell takes us into a mystical mindscape; 
and Derek Jarman's clip is so generic that almost any piece of pop music 
could be dubbed onto it to much the same effect.
To view Boyd's project as a whole, we must really locate where its 
different directors agree about the essence of opera.  In this instance, 
it's pretty straightforward - sex and death.  It's also fun to see where 
they differ, in any number of binary choices: e.g., popular arias versus 
the esoteric; the adherence to or departure from the context of the 
original libretto; the refusal or indulgence of directorial trademarks 
(to this end, we can see evidence of Jarman's music videos and 8mm film 
paste-ups, Roeg's use of wife Theresa Russell, Godard's use of 
intertitles and soundtrack jumpcuts).  Surprisingly, it is from the two 
least expected sources, Sturridge and Roddam, that the potential of 
Boyd's concept is best realized - their sequences are as evocative and 
emotive as we would hope for.  But it is Ken Russell, who has always 
been adept at this sort of thing, where ARIA really coalesces in terms 
of concept, visuals, and music.  To say more would spoil it for you.  
Film is unlikely to produce imitators, so it may well remain one of a 
kind.  Sumptuous photography and superb music make it ideal theatrical 
fare.


Title
Review for Thalassa, Thalassa (1994)
Children's film from Romania like no other - if it is a children's
film.  It's a little hard to tell, although I can imagine the concept
of the story would be quite appealing to young viewers.  Simple plot
depicts the journey of seven Romanian children from their arid village
to the coast 40 kilometers away (I won't spoil things by saying how). 
This is almost a Romanian STAND BY ME - as with all road movies, the
journey is more significant than the destination - but it's light
years away from anything Hollywood would come up with.
The portrayal of children in cinema has been a long-running bone of
contention for me - they're always precocious, articulate, or cute. 
In short, they're always acting.  And it's pretty hard for children to
act like children when their lines are written by adults.  THALASSA
brings to the screen the most natural representation of children I can
remember seeing - everything they say or do is so real it'll make you
wonder if you were really like that at their age.  You were.  And
their world of logic is so abstruse it ultimately pervades the
structure of the story.  It's almost as if writer-director Bogdan
Dumitrescu has let his child actors choose the direction and events of
his film - it certainly has an improvisational feel to it.  But these
kids aren't the typically cute ensemble we've seen in countless other
films.  Their natures are capricious and arbitrary.  They switch
allegiances to each other and think primarily of themselves, and they
take absolutely nothing seriously.  As story progresses, film takes on
surreal overtones - the landscape is blasted and desolate; the
children dress in oversized clothes looted from a suitcase; and in
separate instances, a couple of the characters simply drop out of the
story - their disappearances are never explained, although we may be
right to suspect violence. 
It's worth bearing in mind that 100,000 orphans were still being
relocated around Romania at the time this film was conceived -
Dumitrescu may be taking a shot at the bureaucratical procrastination
which left a few thousand children contracting the AIDS virus in
substandard institutions.  His cast is as carefree and scruffy as any
group of street kids we would care to imagine.  Film doesn't really
have any feel-good moments until the ambiguous ending, which makes us
realize that no matter how much some children go through, the only
thing they really live for is the moment.  Does this trivialize the
rest of the film?  Who cares.  By the time they're openly celebrating
you'll be just as unconcerned about consequence as they are.  Worth
showing in a classroom, if only for the lively discussion which is
sure to follow. 

Title
Review for Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985)
This got terrible notices when first released but has earned a following, 
especially by fans of director Tim Burton.  The title would have you 
believing that this is a children's film, and you'd be partway right.  It 
marks the feature debuts of both Burton and its star, Pee-Wee Herman (Paul 
Reubens).  Reubens had previously introduced the Pee-Wee character in a 
television special and continued with a savvy children's show after his film 
got attention.  In case you haven't seen any of these: Pee-Wee is an adult 
who behaves like a child and dresses in the types of suits the Beatles might 
have discarded early in their grooming phase.  Basically, he's a boy who 
never grew up - the 'Big Adventure' of the title echoes Peter Pan's 
oft-expressed wish to someday experience a Big Adventure.  He lives in a 
glorified playhouse, speaks in a ducky, cartoon-character voice, and 
treasures a bike as his most valuable possession.  The bike turns out to be 
the catalyst for the story, an EASY RIDER spoof which takes the form of a 
quest.  It's the most suitable plot device for this character, who would 
probably drive you crazy if he was stuck in the same setting for too long.  
As Pee-Wee sets off across America to find his bike (which is stolen early 
in the film) he runs into a series of characters just as two-dimensional as 
he is.  It all ends with a chase, which might seem lazily predictable but 
makes sense here, as it's an ideal context for the spirited boy-and-bike 
reunion we've been waiting for.
PEE-WEE's BIG ADVENTURE communicates a genuine sense of eccentricity that 
keeps it bubbling along.  Former Oingo Boingo band member Danny Elfman is a 
perfect choice for composer, despite his only previous experience being a 
film score written for his brother; Burton had worked on two quirky animated 
features for Disney which were shelved; and Pee-Wee's bizarre track record 
speaks for itself.  Together these three outsiders created a product unique 
in cinema - even the non-Burton sequel BIG TOP PEE-WEE couldn't replicate 
it.  Pee-Wee manages to keep us from disliking him despite his flaws, 
although strangely we never feel sympathy for him either.  Even though he is 
in every scene of this movie we don't tire of the character because he lets 
the supporting cast handle most of the dialogue.  The film's biggest mistake 
is to put in a 'meaningful'  scene with a roadhouse waitress - it's really 
only a means to (a) have Pee-Wee menaced by a jealous boyfriend (this 
doesn't really go anywhere), and (b) have him undergo some kind of learning 
curve which he reiterates in a phone call to his non-girlfriend (he tells 
her he's changed, but he plainly hasn't, rendering the scene obsolete - 
unless the point of it is to prove to us that he will never change).  Some 
years after his films and television appearances as Pee-Wee, Reubens would 
suffer the embarrassment of being arrested for 'indecent exposure' at a 
porno house.  At the end of PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE his alter ego Pee-Wee is 
no more wiser or sophisticated than when he started.  Thank goodness.

Title
Review for What Dreams May Come (1998)
It's terribly frustrating to have read a book that no-one else you know 
has.  As it stands, I know but one other person who has read Richard 
Matheson's life-after-death novel 'What Dreams May Come', and that's 
only because I made her read it over a decade ago.  Now that the film 
version has hit the screens, I find myself at another level of 
frustration: that the film and the book are not quite the same thing, 
and I'm right back where I started from.  I still can't share the 
experience.
This shouldn't come as any surprise.  Matheson's intensively-researched 
novel was captivating because it took subject matter that was 
dangerously new-agey, pseudo-religious, or just plain gooey, and turned 
into something that managed to be thoughtful and somehow authentic.  
Obviously, such metaphysics lend themselves to the printed page more 
readily than the cinema screen, which is why I had never entertained for 
a second the idea that this book would ever be made into a film.  Yet 
here it is, with NZ director Vincent Ward at the helm.  So far, so good.  
Ward has a history of powerful visual imagery in his work to date and is 
an intelligent, discerning film-maker.  This is also the director who 
walked out on his first Hollywood assignment (ALIEN 3) as soon as it 
departed from his original concept and has refrained from taking on any 
other project since, so it would seem safe to assume that Ward would 
handle Matheson's book with some integrity.
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is titled after Hamlet's famous soliloquy about 
death, so it should not come as much of a surprise when Chris Neilsen 
(Robin Williams) shuffles off his mortal coil ten minutes into the story 
and eventually finds his way to an afterlife created by visual cues from 
the memories of those who inhabit it.  There is no judgment in this 
world, no heaven or hell save their simulacra.  For a while we share 
Chris' exploration of his new world, and it is as blissful as any you 
could imagine; but, as David Byrne says, heaven is a place where nothing 
ever happens, so it isn't too long before Chris is going further afield 
(read: hell) to reconcile himself with his wife Annie (Annabella 
Sciorra).  
The first half of Ward's film depicts a heaven-world so beautifully 
realized that it's almost as if he and his crew went there to get 
location footage.  It is like nothing else you've ever seen on film.  
For a while the vivid colors and intricate detail make this a spectacle 
which can be seen only on a large canvas.  But then something peculiar 
happens - as the story shifts from heaven-world to hell-world, the 
visuals become less impressive.  Furthermore, just at the point where 
Chris is finally taking action and doing something, the story gets piled 
up with flashbacks that interrupt the narrative and prevent his quest 
from becoming the epic it deserves.  Given the impressionistic, 
painterly world of 'Summerland' (as Matheson refers to it), it's only 
natural to expect Hell to be influenced by the works of Bosch, Hogarth, 
or even Gustave Dore.  Initially, the journey is promising (I like the 
way that Chris and Annie's initial boating encounter is perverted into a 
shoreline of wrecked vessels) but in the end Hell becomes gloomy and 
run-down, and Ward shoots most of the sequences there with Williams and 
Sciorra in close-up so that we don't even really get to see a lot of it.  
This may all be a dubious strategy on his part: just as the devil gets 
all the good lines, it is easy for a dramatic, chaotic hell to upstage a 
meditative, placid heaven.  So Ward's solution is to make Hell boring.  
After ten minutes we're pining for the wide open spaces of Summerland 
again, which is where everyone in this story belongs, and of course, 
ends up.
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a difficult film to gauge - you don't want to be 
unfair to it because it does manage to take you places you haven't seen 
before in the movies.  Yet the journey may just be too careful, too 
measured, and too contemplative for its own good, which is why it is not 
for all tastes (although anybody who is genuinely interested in film 
should check it out for its cinematic qualities alone).  Also, for a 
non-religious afterlife there seems to be an excess of guilt around, 
which gets a little wearying.  And even after Chris gets everything he 
wants, he still wants to get back to the 'real' world.  It's just as 
Schopenhauer has always said: satisfaction in human beings is 
impossible, because whenever one desire is fulfilled, ten others jump in 
their place; and even if they were all fulfilled, satisfaction would 
only become boredom.  I guess we all know this deep inside, which is why 
the final scene doesn't seem as corny as it otherwise might (the last 
line is really sweet, in a karmic kinda way). 
I appreciate the intelligence behind this film and the bold way it is 
set almost entirely in the afterlife, and ultimately, I felt that it did 
not do the book a disservice (as for visualizations of hell, it still 
doesn't beat a Strontium Dog comic I read serialized in 2000 A.D. when I 
was a teenager), and I suppose I should be satisfied with that: yes, it 
takes us into Hamlet's 'undiscovered country', and quite convincingly.  
It does at least make me want to read the book again.  And maybe this 
time I won't be the only one.  So if you liked the movie, read the 
novel.  And if you didn't like the movie...well, read it anyway.  


Title
Review for Punishment Park (1971)
You'll have to be persistent to catch a screening of this political SF
from Peter Watkins - it's presently unavailable on video and (due to
its high profanity content) unlikely to be screened on TV.  Film
employs the usual quasi-documentary style favored by Watkins to depict
an ultra-conservative America bent on rounding up (mostly young)
dissidents and subjecting them to grueling tribunals that end either
in imprisonment or a three-day ordeal in the desert known as
Punishment Park.  At no stage is the purpose of the park is
satisfactorily explained: we are to believe that it is a training
ground for police officers and the National Guard, whose task it is to
track down and recapture the dissidents who have been turned loose in
the desert.  But I can't see how any such exercise involves useful
skills on behalf of the pursuers - their quarry, who are a pretty
fragile bunch, have to follow a predetermined route and don't pose
much of a challenge for the armed and mobilized forces on their trail.
 Is the park nothing more than an excuse for organized sadism?  The
purpose behind the park - or at least the film's strategy of using the
park - makes itself apparent when the activists argue amongst
themselves about whether or not the whole thing is a set-up to shoot
them all dead.  Is the state just messing with their heads?  It's an
uneasiness we share with the characters because Watkins' convincing
cinema-verite style contradicts what we know is an historical untruth.
The scenes in the desert become tense and genuinely scary: they are
intercut with businesslike discussions among the assault forces and
heated confrontations at the tribunal.  Towards the film's finale,
Watkins loses the dispassionate voice he uses in his better-known
films CULLODEN and THE WAR GAME, and becomes increasingly upset. 
Eventually his anger makes us question the point behind his film. 
It's undeniably well made, realistically acted, and arresting, but its
agenda is unclear.  At first he is condemning the Vietnam war, the
brutal suppression of student protests, and possible dangerous trends
in right-wing politics, but then abruptly switches to an out-and-out
condemnation of the law enforcement mentality that such governments
breed.  These are, however, just the kinds of discussion points that
Watkins wants to prompt.  He wrote part of the story and improvised
others with his non-professional cast, but most notably, quoted much
of the tribunal statements from actual transcripts.  It's a last grim
touch that lifts this film out of the ordinary.

Title
Review for Eight Men Out (1988)
John Sayle's film about the 1919 Chicago White Sox scandal (in which 
eight players took bribes to throw the World Series) appeared in the 
middle of a 'baseball movie' revival at the end of the eighties.  The 
reason why it was not as popular as many of the others is simple: it 
does not portray ball players as larger-than-life heroes.  But it's 
easily one of the better pictures.  As would be expected from any Sayles 
production, the ensemble acting is terrific (no one 'star' outshines the 
others); no peripheral character is wasted.  The sense of period is also 
well evoked, aided in part by the leached photography.
The White Sox players are pulled into the fix early on in the story, 
leaving us to watch the Series, game by game, for the first half of the 
film.  It's not like the usual baseball pictures, where we're rooting 
for the team to win, and uplifted by some final spectacular catch or 
home run.  What makes the games compelling are the two opposing factions 
involved - there is always tension, regardless of whether the team is 
winning or losing.  In EIGHT MEN OUT the playing field is more like a 
minefield.  Half of the team doesn't know what the other half (who are 
on the take) are doing.  The half that is on the take are further 
divided - the younger players (John Cusack and Charlie Sheen) don't want 
to look bad, but know that they must 'fail' convincingly.  The coach and 
backstop are by turns bewildered and enraged.  The secret play signals 
become subterfuge.  The fans are confused.  The newspaper reporters (one 
of whom is Sayles, who at one point sings a sardonic version of 'I'm 
Forever Blowing Bubbles') are suspicious.  Behind all of this intrigue 
lie the gamblers, who have made their own arrangements around the fix.  
It's an interesting touch that they have all at one time been sportsmen 
themselves: the idea of playing a game on the level is for rookies.  The 
second half of the film, which is even more complicated, deals with the 
exposure and subsequent indictment of the players.
EIGHT MEN OUT is a fascinating picture because - like Robert Redford's 
QUIZ SHOW -  it deals with an event in history that undermined public 
faith and demonstrated that organized crime was able to corrupt what was 
regarded to be a wholesome, all-American institution.  Notice that while 
the public cries shame, they object to the scandal mainly on principal, 
and that it's the youngsters and the ball players themselves that it 
hits at gut level.  You won't exactly feel sorry for the team (Sayles is 
too smart to be that manipulative), but you will recognize the loss of a 
more innocent time.  The great final scene anticipates Kevin Costner's 
hit of the following year FIELD OF DREAMS, which fulfils many a fan's 
wishes and gives the eight 'Black Sox' a second chance. 


Title
Review for Audrey Rose (1977)
Robert Wise has been responsible for a number of classic 
sci-fi/horror/fantasy films in his time.  If any directorial trademark 
could link them together then it would have to be his restrained, 
intelligent approach to the material.  AUDREY ROSE is among the least 
seen of his efforts but I find it resonates more effectively than his 
other classics - it conveys a sense of despair I haven't discovered in 
most other horror films.  Actually, it's probably unfair to label this 
as a horror film, but the fact that it centers around a 'possessed' 
child pretty much seals its fate.  John Beck and Marsha Mason are the 
parents of a girl (twelve-year old Susan Swift, in her debut) who 
attracts the interest of Anthony Hopkins.  It turns out that Hopkins is 
convinced that the soul of his dead daughter has transmigrated into 
Swift's body, although it's not clear why the girl should relive panic 
attacks of her previous life at about the time that Hopkins shows up 
(her first moments of 'rebirth' take place in her bedroom, which is 
bathed in an embryonic pink light).  Premise sounds simple, but opens up 
a wealth of possibilities, touching on themes like identity, ownership, 
parenthood, and of course, life after death.  Most strongly it addresses 
the issue of loss - in many ways this is mainly a story about child 
custody.  When Mason watches her daughter overtaken by hysteria, she is 
horrified, but the expression on her face doesn't change when Hopkins 
steps in and calms the girl down - she sees that her daughter is 
becoming his daughter.  Her husband (Beck) is even more upset, coming to 
blows with Hopkins and warning him to stay away from his family.  Swift 
(who gives a convincing performance throughout) is the helpless pawn in 
the middle of this mess, shuffled between hospitals, schools, and one 
'parent' to another.  To top it off, the whole thing ends in a 
courtroom.  
Since this story is treated so rationally (Hopkins speaks softly and 
calmly throughout the entire film) any pseudo-supernatural elements come 
across as concessions to the film's inevitable 'horror' label (e.g.  
Swift's irrational attraction to a ritual pyre built in her school 
playground).  But where Wise and his young star really excel is in the 
final scene, which, unlike nearly all other horror films, requires no 
dramatic sets or special effects.  Swift is mesmerising as she undergoes 
hypnosis and revisits past memories in her subconscious.  Screenwriters 
Joe Wizan and  Frank De Felitta (who adapted his novel) include many 
provocative moments.  Single parents who have lost children in 
litigation will probably find this uncomfortable viewing.  Ending of 
film, though viewed positively, is nonetheless depressing.   


Title
Review for Ulzana's Raid (1972)
Robert Aldrich western finds Burt Lancaster in philosophical mood as
McIntosh, a scout hired by the cavalry to track down a renegade Apache
chief who has left an Arizona reservation to go on the rampage with a
small band of followers.  As is usual with these movies, Lancaster
knows the terrain, and the Indians, better than any other man around. 
And, as is also usual, he has an inexperienced young lieutenant (Bruce
Davison) to `educate' along the way.  But Davison isn't as feckless as
we might assume.  Actually, he holds up pretty well considering the
violence he is witness to.  Besides, Lancaster can't reply to anything
Davison says without making a snappy remark, leaving the young officer
to work things out for himself most of the time.
All conversations between characters are thoughtful, clear.  Davison
can't help comparing Apache values with Christian ones in his attempt
to understand Ulzana's way of thinking - or is he trying to
rationalize it?  Most revealing is Ulzana's excuse for his attacks on
the scattered settlers.  It is not simply a case of exacting revenge
for white colonization of his land.  Rather, he equates the
reservation with impotence - he wants to possess and assimilate the
spiritual power of those outside it.  It's up to Lancaster, Davison,
and their cavalry troop to second-guess Ulzana's every move and stop
him before he kills again.  Film's storyline suits a
cop-vs-serial-killer formula better than a western.  There's also
enough tension and gore to make it effective enough as a horror movie
(an ambush scene early in the story has an unexpected, shocking
moment).  Bearing in mind the year of production, film can be
interpreted either as yet-another-Vietnam parable (Ulzana's band are
as nameless and hidden as the Viet Cong), or a call-to-arms to
preserve the identity of Native Americans, which were then seen
politically as a growing part of the counter-cultural revolution.  But
I'm sure Aldrich really only wanted to make a western.

Title
Review for Pokémon the First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back (1999)
A POKEMON PRIMER!  MYSTERIES REVEALED TO THE UNINITIATED!  AND SOMETHING 
ABOUT THE MOVIE!
I love the idea of middle-aged film critics who have paid their dues, worked 
their way up the ladder, and secured their credibility now finding 
themselves in child-packed audiences watching a cartoon derived from a 
phenomenon that they find incomprehensible, all the time aware that they 
have to write about it afterwards.  The dilemma: this is a product with a 
very specific target audience.  To review it from a purely adult perspective 
would be uncharitable.  To leave its verdict in the hands of the 
ten-year-olds it was pitched at would bring only the conclusions that "it 
sucked" or "it was cool", or perhaps a little of both, if the ten-year-old 
in question had any future vocation as a film critic.
I'm not a fan of POKEMON but I find it more interesting and enjoyable than 
most other cartoons that are around, although it's hard to tell what may 
have been 'improved' in translation (the English-language version is crammed 
with puns).  For a start, the episodes are not stand-alone entries, but 
follow a story arc that enables minor developments to enter the growing 
storyline unobtrusively (this is why I imagine many adults find any 
randomly-tuned episode mystifying: POKEMON the series makes no apologies for 
the fact that you need to have been watching from the beginning - but isn't 
this true of many adult television series' also?).  The characters, too, are 
a little more complicated thanwell, let's say COW AND CHICKEN, why not?  
The central character, Ash, is overconfident, mulish, and has an obsession 
with Pokemon (a portmanteau of 'pocket monsters') that is destined for a 
major dysfunction.  Ash's friend Brock, meanwhile, has a fetish with women 
in uniform that's downright embarrassing, leaving their female companion 
Misty to provide the sole voice of reason (their adversaries, a trio known 
as Team Rocket, are just as single-minded but far more entertaining).  One 
can uneasily draw comparisons to the boy hero of this series and the 
Pokemon-crazed viewers watching him: each show begins with the signature 
tune "gotta catch 'em all", as simple a philosophy as you'd ever need when 
you're ten years old, and most likely the main reason this show has become 
so popular.  Despite its complex narrative, the core purpose - to find 
Pokemon and train them - is what drives its appeal.  Forming a roster of 
creatures from the Nintendo game upon which the cartoon was based, POKEMON 
offers its followers the irresistible urge to *collect*, either vicariously 
through Ash's adventures or more practically for a few bucks at K-Mart.  The 
whole collecting bug doesn't just stop at the Pokemon themselves: once 
caught the creatures are then used as pawns in staged combat to aid Ash's 
further obsession to collect combat badges (this show has the moral stance 
of cockfighting) which in turn will allow him to enter a higher level of 
arena in the Pokemon League, and so on and so on.
It may be that the values of POKEMON's protagonist have tapped into the 
unconscious of a generation that compulsively watches the show and codifies 
its critters without really knowing why.  This at least is a more valid 
platform for criticism against the show than its supposed violence.  Unlike 
POWER RANGERS and NINJA TURTLES and other intense (though short-lived) 
television crazes, POKEMON does not promote rough play in the schoolyard.  
In fact, any kid wanting to emulate the combat routines of their favorite 
Pokemon is going to have their work cut out for them.  Most of these 
monsters are just plain dorky and their attacks, reminiscent of the D&D 
role-playing game, diverse to the point of absurdity.  Some sing to their 
opponents and then scribble on their faces when they're asleep; others kiss; 
create gusts of wind; cause headaches; throw leaves; blow bubbles.  When 
it's time for the real fighting to get underway it usually involves a group 
of Pokemon hurling lightning bolts, water cannons, and flamethrowers at each 
other.  It sounds lethal, and it probably is - but Pokemon don't fight to 
the death.  At least not intentionally.  At least not in any scenario we'll 
ever get to see.
But now from the small screen to the big one, and where does this leave the 
movie?  It's the same, but a little different.  The candy colors of the TV 
show have gone, overwhelmed by shadows and voids.  The tone is less 
frivolous, so gone too are the opportunities for the often hilarious 
combination of Team Rocket to play out their hapless schemes.  As villains, 
they are outclassed by the newest and most powerful addition to the Pokemon 
catalogue, a genetically-created creature called Mewtwo.  Unlike its kin, 
Mewtwo is a figure of evil, more of the Manga mold than Pokemon, and the 
film is slanted accordingly.  It's an interesting move of the film-makers 
because it positions POKEMON: THE FIRST MOVIE as a 'safe' introduction to a 
more adult form of Japanese animation, as if they are aware that their 
audience is growing older and that they must grow with it.  Such themes 
synchronize with another significant element of the show, which in itself 
grew from simple beginnings like computer games and playing cards: Pokemon 
evolve from cuddly pets to more fearsome (but still tame) variations.  This 
is usually accomplished unexpectedly in the heat of battle and takes but a 
few moments, as if a hormonal rush has given them the growth spurt to end 
all spurts.  You can get as psychoanalytical about this as you want, but 
bear in mind that Ash's most precious creature, Pikachu, is unlikely to ever 
evolve into its mature counterpart.  As strongly connected as they are to 
each other, Pikachu and Ash will always be children, never 'evolving' or 
growing out of their play-fight universe.  It's about time they were shown a 
darker side of their world this time around, even if it has to bear forth 
the clumsy revelation that "Fighting Is Wrong!".
POKEMON isn't great, but it isn't bad either.  Regular viewers will 
appreciate the in-jokes (e.g. "Who's that Pokemon?") and first-timers 
shouldn't have any problem keeping up with the story.  The animation is 
serviceable, although not as eccentric as in the television series, and 
there are a couple of exciting action sequences involving a storm at sea and 
a panicky chase in a laboratory.  There's also the rare appearance of Mew, 
the much sought-after Pokemon that was circulated among a small percentage 
of the Nintendo games - I have a feeling that this movie will definitely 
boost his popularity.  Curious and playful, this powerful kitty will 
probably give even Pikachu a run for his money as the cartoon's unofficial 
mascot.  After all, he is colored a newborn pink, emerges from an embryonic 
bubble in the ocean, and is even less likely in danger of ever growing up.

Review for Monkey Shines (1988)
     George A. Romero wrote and directed this adaptation of Michael
Stewart's novel at a time when the renewed 'horror wave' of the 80's
was in its ebb.  It has an interesting hook: a quadriplegic, Allan
(Jason Beghe) is assigned a trained capuchin monkey by the name of Ella
to help him with simple routines that he is now incapable of.  Ella,
however, is the star pupil of a dubious laboratory experiment by
Geoffrey (John Pankow), one of Allan's friends. By the finale, we're
left with a dangerous situation:  after years of evolution, who has the
upper hand - an intelligent, angry monkey, or an intelligent,
incapacitated human?  Romero must have enjoyed choreographing this
final sequence - it was pretty creepy when I saw it the first time in a
cinema.  Film doesn't hold up as well in repeat viewings, but to be
fair, this is true of most horror films.  There are shocks (mostly of
the leaping-monkey variety) and deaths, which are surprisingly
bloodless.  Its safe to guess that after the excess of his zombie
films, Romero wanted to prove he could make a horror picture without
gore.
     The addition of a science-fiction element (Geoffrey has injected
Ella with a telepathy-inducing serum), which provides a kind of
mind-meld between man and monkey, is awkwardly posed to justify Ella's
behavior.  While it's reasonable to expect Ella to feel anger over
incidents in which Allan is mistreated, it's another thing to accept
her jealousy over his new girlfriend (Kate McNeil).  But if you can
believe a car getting jealous over its owner's girlfriend, as in 1983's
CHRISTINE, then a monkey shouldn't be too much of a stretch.  Story
could have done more with the notion that the evolutionary gap is
narrower than we would care to think, but instead only hints that
Ella/Allan are two sides of the same coin, and while their roles never
completely reverse, it comes close.  The newly-paralyzed Allan (whose
surname is Mann) comes to realize that he must not only rediscover his
worth as an individual but also his status as a man.  And Ella is a
worthy adversary - it's chilling seeing her hiss and hyperventilate as
her intelligent eyes fix upon Allan's face.  The cards are stacked
against her, however - we know from the outset that she is the villain
of the piece, so have no inclination to enjoy her cute antics in the
earlier moments of the film.  At least she doesn't ham it up as much as
Allan's nurse and mother, who give nagging, one-note performances, just
to provide Ella with a couple of targets and ensure, in the eyes of the
audience, that they 'deserve' what's coming to them.  Romero juggles
disparate elements and takes some risks (a sex scene, in which Allan
can move only his head, is either erotic or laughable, depending on
your point of view), but one gets the feeling that he'd be more at home
with a couple of shotguns and a bucket of viscera.  Still, as a
pint-sized flipside to King Kong, Ella has her place among movie
monsters.  I've often wondered if the title MONKEY SHINES was a jokey
reference to Stephen King's term for telepathy, THE SHINING.

Title
Review for Circle of Iron (1979)
Martial arts fantasy starring David Carradine as a blind wanderer who
carries a four-foot flute and dispenses koans to wannabee hero Jeff
Cooper.  Cooper, who plays a brash muscleman named Cord, is seeking
the path that will lead him to the Book of Enlightenment.  Naturally
there are trials along the way.  Oddball Kung Fu (or more accurately,
Kung Flute) movie has surprisingly little violence and disappointingly
little to offer in the way of martial arts.  As neither Carradine or
Cooper are sufficiently proficient fighters, their combat scenes
aren=92t terribly exciting - Carradine was obviously picked because of
his role in TV=92s KUNG FU; Cooper=92s trademark seems to be to strike
defensive poses with his hands as if he=92s preparing to make shadow
puppets.  Film has a low-rent atmosphere despite its technical polish,
but most striking feature is the careless mise-en-scene that permeates
the entire picture - most jarring for me was hearing an irrelevant
blast of Susato=92s Pavane Bataille inside a cave of monkey-men! 
Starting off in what appears to be a Tibetan monastary (with Roddy
MacDowell in a piece of miscasting worthy of the musical LOST
HORIZON), the film=92s first jolt comes upon utterance of Cooper=92s
booming, impossible American accent.  Playing the
barbarian-as-tourist, Cooper meets up not only with Carradine but also
a mixture of Mongols, Tartars, Berbers, and an elderly Hebrew couple
who seem to have strayed in from the biblical epic next door.
This total lack of unity (it was filmed in Israel, just to add to the
overall dislocation), while seen as CIRCLE OF IRON=92s greatest
liability, could also, however, be its biggest asset.  It really does
enforce the feeling of an alternate world.  It=92s as if the film-makers
were given a surplus of props and costumes and went to town with them
- even Carradine dresses up in four different roles.  Fortunately,
film doesn=92t take itself seriously, and Carradine has some good
one-liners.  I don=92t think it lives up to Bruce Lee=92s original story
concept however (he died before it went into production), and there=92s
never any real explanation about the true meaning of the quest for the
Book - just the pat pseudo-philosophical punchline you=92d come to
expect.  If anything, story lazily perpetuates the idea that those who
have Ultimate Knowledge also have the right to beat up anybody who
wants to ask them about it.

Title
Review for Undercover Blues (1993)
Straightforward spy comedy runs on one gag but gets a lot of mileage out of 
it.  Not unexpectedly, it does run out of gas before the end, but there are 
plenty of bright spots along the way.  The title refers simultaneously to 
undercover cops and, more irritatingly, to the surname of husband-and-wife 
team Jeff and Jane (Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner).  What it definitely 
does not refer to are any 'blues' suffered by agents feeling down about 
their job, and it is the free and easy manner projected by Quaid and Turner 
that provides this film with its heart.
Their holiday in New Orleans interrupted by a plea to return to service and 
extradite a visiting terrorist, the Blues wander fecklessly through one 
confrontation after another, seemingly improvising the investigation as they 
go.  The central gag: this 'normal' married couple are trained undercover 
agents, and in the manner of a long cinematic history of secret agents, 
manage to turn the tables on every unsuspecting foe they cross.  It's been 
done before, but this time it's different.  Cast your mind back to every 
other spy film you've seen (barring the more outlandish, surreal spoofs) and 
you'll know that no matter how infallible the protagonist appears to be, 
there will always be a moment of reckoning.  It makes screenwriting sense - 
if the character is invulnerable, there can be no element of suspense.  
UNDERCOVER BLUES throws that rule right out of the window: the reason it is 
so enjoyable is precisely because we have absolute confidence in these two 
characters.  Quaid, with his huge aw-shucks grin, is completely insouciant 
as he walks into one bad situation after another; Turner's sense of fun is 
barely concealed throughout her performance.  The reason why this approach 
works in UNDERCOVER BLUES where it would fail in other films is because of a 
third element - the Blue's baby.  Wherever Quaid and Turner go, the baby 
accompanies them: it's a prop to show us that nothing bad is going to 
happen, that the comedy isn't going to turn sour with a dubious 'serious' 
scene or random act of violence.  It's not until the film's climax that it 
there is one moment where the Blue's savior-faire may be about to come 
undone, but it is so fleeting that we've barely time to doubt them.
The investigation element of the story follows an unhurried, meandering 
track that blends in with both the New Orleans setting (which otherwise is 
never exploited) and the holiday mood that Quaid and Turner refuse to 
abandon despite their reassignment.  Their juggling of babysitters, 
sightseeing, and 'business' make the act of espionage as ordinary as the 
lives of the married couple they befriend in their hotel.  It's inevitable 
that this incidental treatment of the story's motive might turn off some 
viewers, but it's a logical approach when weighed against the mood 
UNDERCOVER BLUES is aiming for.  To add a little spark, Stanley Tucci gives 
a hilarious performance as a small-time crook ("My name is Death!") pursuing 
a hopeless vendetta against the couple.  He'd all but steal the show if 
Quaid and Turner weren't so perfectly congenial as his adversaries.  Also 
with: Larry Miller as a local undercover cop in awe of the Blues, and Obba 
Babatunde as his less-than-impressed partner.  Favorite scene: Quaid's 
confrontation with Tucci at the zoo.


Title
Review for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  (1998)  118m.
There are always a few posers to consider when reviewing a 
long-in-coming film adaptation of a well-known book.  Should the film be 
judged without reference to its source material?  Should you read the 
book first and then view the film as its visual interpretation?  What 
about reading the book afterwards?  Should you read it at all?  
Shouldn't a film be its own peculiar entity, irrespective of its 
ancestry?
I didn't have a problem with Terry Gilliam's film of Hunter S. 
Thompson's book, but I imagine several others will.  To begin with, it's 
one of those books that are tagged 'unfilmable'.  I was in the fortunate 
position of having read 'Fear and Loathing' several years ago in high 
school, so by the time of the film version I had forgotten nearly 
everything that had happened in the book (so, I suspect, had Thompson).  
But I did remember the overall 'nothingness' of the story, which was 
enough to prepare me for the movie.  The one-sentence plot can be 
summarized thus: Two men go to Las Vegas with a suitcase full of drugs 
and spend the whole trip off their heads.  It's pointless, plotless, and 
indulgent.  It was also the birth of what became known as 'gonzo 
journalism', a sort of stream-of-consciousness reportage where the 
journo drops all pretense of trying to say anything important and 
becomes his own story.
If Hunter's book is gonzo journalism then Gilliam's film is gonzo 
cinema.  It's gleefully self-destructive.  It is Gilliam fastening his 
lance to a Chevrolet convertible and charging at the windmills with his 
foot to the floor.  But where he really nails down the film with one 
solid thwack is the way that everyone involved with the project doesn't 
seem to care about the risk they are taking.  Nothing about it is 
subtle.  The acting and directing are uninhibited to the point of being 
sophomoric.  And nobody is going to apologize.  If FEAR AND LOATHING is 
trying to simulate Thompson's similarly reckless state of mind (as it 
was in 1971) then it has to succeed on that score at least.  It 
recreates the sensation that many of its prospective audience will 
undoubtedly relate to - that when you're stoned anything and everything 
can be funny.  The opening five minutes is hysterical, but it's another 
thing to keep repeating those five minutes ad nauseum to the same 
effect.  Gilliam tries to make it as attractive as possible 
nevertheless, at least to cinema-goers, and those most interested in 
FEAR AND LOATHING will be the ones going to see its heightened pop 
colors, drunken angles, and crystal-clear depth of field on the big 
screen.  Those who are less interested will grab it off the video shelf 
and sit through forty minutes before hitting the fast-forward button.  
This film isn't made for video.  It is not meant to be controlled by the 
viewer.  It's a film that controls the viewer.  It wants to be the rush, 
and you the user.  It's what I like most about Gilliam's project; 
there's an admirable folly in making a big-budget film supposedly for 
mainstream audiences and then telling them that they're going to have to 
learn to watch films differently if we ever want to get out of the 
Hollywood rut.  David Cronenberg has been pushing this element into 
commercial cinema for years now.  When he or Gilliam get around to 
making something out of a Thomas Pynchon novel, I know we'll have 
arrived.
And in the middle of this paranoid, hallucinogenic buzz sits Johnny 
Depp, adding to his collection of oddball characters, who is left to 
provide some sort of anchor to all the disorganization around him.  
Except Depp is just as flaky as everything else in the film, so even 
that idea gets torpedoed.  If you hate Depp's bewildered performance - 
like Groucho Marx after shock treatment - then you'll be one of the 
people that walks out early, something I'm confident happens in nearly 
every screening this film has.  Maybe they didn't read the book.  Or 
maybe they did.  Or maybe they just wanted to perpetuate the concept of 
gonzo-filmgoing by buying tickets for a movie they didn't want to watch.

Title
Review for Duel (1971/I) (TV)
Not technically Steven Spielberg's film debut, as it began life as a
TV-Movie, but it was expanded for theatrical release outside the US
after Universal saw its box-office potential.  Man-vs-truck story
brings together powerhouse talents of young director Spielberg and
fantasy writer Richard Matheson (they'd reunite for the TWILIGHT ZONE
movie and AMAZING STORIES series).  When David Mann (Dennis Weaver)
passes a truck on a desert road the truck driver retaliates by passing
him in turn.  From there begins a murderous fight for ownership of the
road.  Weaver becomes an unwilling David to the truck's Goliath.  Most
fascinating element of this film is that we don't really question the
unseen truck driver's motivation.  This is because Matheson's sharp but
simple story works almost entirely on a primal level: territorial
dominance and the battle for survival.  Despite millennia of evolution
the human brain still retains the instinct of the hunt.  Mann is quite
obviously Man, and his blood-red car is as nondescript and generic a
vehicle as you would find.  The truck, on the other hand, is an amalgam
of different archetypal beasts - it is a smoke-belching dragon (which
appears to be waiting in its cave at one point when it turns its
headlights on), a lumbering mammoth (witness its animal bellow at the
film's conclusion), and, it has been suggested, a precursor to the
shark in JAWS (we see menacing POV shots as it glides towards its
prey).
This is the production that really got studio heads taking notice of
Spielberg, and it's fun watching him at work.  As every frame was
storyboarded it makes an ideal piece  for perusal by film students. 
Extra footage for the cinema version includes scenes with a bus and a
railway crossing (although in retrospect I find these don't work as
well as the more basic cat-and-mouse bullying on the open road). 
Weaver, best known for his cowboy detective McCloud, is an unusual but
effective choice for the role of the bewildered, victimized motorist. 
Story is not too far removed from a Western anyway - there is a desert
setting, a bar fight, a cowboy-booted villain (the only glimpse we
really get of him), a collection of licence plates on the truck's
grille (in the manner of notches on a gun holster), a basic
good-vs-evil challenge to the death.  Instead of guns, the
protagonists use the next most significant instrument of murder in
civilized culture - their vehicles.  It may get you thinking about the
highways the way JAWS got you thinking about the beach.  Even though
it was intended for television, film's pacing and tension is hurt by
ad breaks.  Rent it or tape it.

Title
Review for Twonky, The (1953)
Curio from the 50s will be of interest to aficionados of SF fantasy.  
Teacher Hans Conried is given a television set by his wife to entertain 
him while she is out of town.  As he and friend Billy Lynn rightly 
guess, it is a television in appearance only - it may actually be 
technology from another time.  Part of the intrigue of Arch Oboler's 
film is that for most of it we are unsure of the purpose of the 
'twonky', as it is christened.  Is it benign or harmful?  The silly 
appearance of the twonky (not to mention its name), the comical aspect 
of several of the characters, and the whimsical, twittering woodwind 
score establish the film as a comedy from the opening scenes (Lynn's 
foggy football coach would be right at home behind the bar in CHEERS).  
but the same script, verbatim, could have been turned into a more 
sinister film if handled by a different director.
At first, THE TWONKY is a satirical swipe at television, the 'new' 
entertainment medium which became a significant threat to cinema in the 
50s: Conried flicks through a TV guide that contains only pap; the 
twonky/television controls his life; he becomes housebound; his tastes 
are directed from 'high' art to the mediocre; and thoughts of individual 
expression are discouraged.  And not only is television regarded as a 
poor substitute for cinema, it is also inferred to be an unworthy 
successor of radio.  Read between the lines: Writer-director Oboler was 
a prominent radio producer before switching to film, and it was he who 
changed the twonky (as it appeared in Henry Kuttner's short story ten 
years earlier) from a radiogram to a television set.  Oboler develops 
the Kuttner story satisfactorily, although the pace flags in places, and 
the anti-television theme loses its way.  The final scenes, however, are 
among the most enjoyable.  Special effects are unfortunately primitive, 
but given their simple requirements you'd think the studio would have 
ponied up some extra cash to make them a little better.  Ironically, THE 
TWONKY has a made-for-TV feel to it.  With a little cropping it would 
have made an ideal hour-long  episode for Rod Serling's TWILIGHT ZONE, 
and the domestic setting, comings-and-goings of peripheral characters, 
and gag ending follow standard sitcom conventions.  Dismissed with their 
usual smirking by the Medved Brothers in the Golden Turkey books - maybe 
they were running short of material. 


Title
Review for Lola rennt (1998)
Guaranteed big-screen crowd-pleaser from writer-director Tom Tykwer: it's a 
welcome change from the Teutonic gloom we normally get imported from Germany 
for film festivals.  Premise reads like a parallel universe joke, but is 
executed like a music video: Vermilion-haired Lola (Frunka Potente) gets a 
panicky phone call from her boyfriend Manni (Mortiz Bleibtreu).  He needs to 
come up with 100,000 marks in twenty minutes or his life is forfeit.  Using 
only a moment to think what to do, Lola immediately hot-foots it out of her 
apartment to save him.  Energetic, rocket-paced film dispenses with its plot 
in the twenty minutes - as promised - but then whips everything back to 
where it started to replay it a second, and then third time.  It seems that 
everything we do in life is so contrived of the most infinite circumstances 
that this story can replay itself endlessly with infinite conclusions: even 
the people Lola passes in the street have different destinies that are 
compressed to flash by us in seconds.
Despite the threat of assassination that hangs over the proceedings, RUN 
LOLA RUN is very light, and abounds with humorous twists and surprises (one 
hilarious moment finds Lola outside a bank confronted by the police).  
Appropriately, Tykwer has treated the exercise as a game: there is no need 
for us to be concerned about the lives or deaths of these characters as they 
are constantly re-invented.  He also has remixes of the same tune throughout 
the film complementing the 'variations on a theme' storyline.  And, notably, 
the cause-and-effect logic of the story is punctuated by constant collisions 
or near-misses - nearly everyone has a run-in with a car, bicycle, truck, 
ambulance, pedestrian, or stroller as if they were so many hypercharged 
electrons bumping off each other, splitting and merging into their own 
quantum-level parallel universes.  Another admirable element of the film is 
its purely cinematic value - you'll be so caught up in its constant movement 
(of course the only shot of the sky just has to have a passenger jet 
swooping by) that you probably won't even notice the absence of special 
effects.  Using every crane trick, slow-motion, pixillation, camera angle 
and editing device at his disposal Tykwer manages to pull off a highly 
visual treat created almost entirely within camera.  It's prime material for 
some needless, overbudgeted Hollywood remake.  And yes, Lola really does 
run.  Potente must have been exhausted by the time this shoot was over.


Title
Review for Moulin Rouge! (2001)
There's a windmill that keeps popping up in MOULIN ROUGE every few minutes.  
It's not central to the plot: it's just there, decked out with pretty 
lights, turning around in circles and going nowhere.  It's probably as good 
a metaphor for MOULIN ROUGE as any, although I'm tempted to think that 
director Baz Luhrmann originally intended it as a jokey aside to the 
Quixotic nature of his brash new undertaking.  You will either love or hate 
MOULIN ROGUE, or more likely both.  There's much that is wonderful and 
dynamic, and just as much that is irritating or hackneyed.  There's 
certainly not much in the storyline: Ewan McGregor plays a would-be bohemian 
writer visiting Paris at the turn of the 20th century, where he becomes 
besotted with Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star attraction of the infamous 
Moulin Rouge nightclub.  The fate of the nightclub is in the hands of an 
unscrupulous Duke (Richard Roxburgh) who also has his eye on Satine and will 
brook no competition from the lovesick McGregor.
It took me a while to figure out exactly what Luhrmann was trying to do with 
MOULIN ROUGE.  It's a natural, if predictable, progression from his previous 
two films STRICTLY BALLROOM and ROMEO + JULIET but at first glance seeks 
only to amplify them.  It wasn't until the melodrama of the film's final 
reel that I remembered its great opening credits, and realized that MOULIN 
ROUGE is intended to be a silent film - with music.  Luhrmann, who I suspect 
would be quite pleased to become heir apparent to the throne of Postmodern 
Cinema, throws every reference, in-joke and quotation imaginable into what 
he determines to be the 21st Century version of the Musical, a genre that 
was pretty much defunct after the 60s.  It would not suit the viewing 
sensibilities of modern audiences to play the story straight, as would have 
been done in the days of Judy Garland or Gene Kelly, so instead Luhrmann 
chooses to be campy and flippant.  This makes the film great fun, but also 
repeats the inconsistency of his previous ROMEO + JULIET: MOULIN ROUGE 
immerses us in a totally artificial (i.e. distinctly cinematic) world with 
over-the-top characters and then expects us to feel genuine emotion for them 
at the end simply by descending into pathos.
The death scene, a less successful rehash of R+J, is tiresome, but not as 
tiresome as the film's other patent flaw.  Luhrmann is a talented director 
with a wayward sense of humor, but in MOULIN ROUGE he has only one joke and 
it is repeated ad nauseam.  Worse, it is that laziest recourse of humor, the 
anachronism joke.  It first happens a few minutes into the film when Ewan 
McGregor bursts into a rendition of 'The Sound of Music'.  It's a forgivable 
gag when it occurs, because it points out to us the direction the rest of 
the movie is heading.  Twenty minutes later, when it becomes apparent that 
the characters are not going to stop quoting song lyrics as if they were 
prose, the joke has worn thin (and reminds us that Luhrmann had a better 
writer for his earlier picture!).  It also raises some confusion - there is 
a specific audience that will be of the right age to recognize the quotes 
(mostly from 1970s tunes) so the spoofy nature of the dialogue will be lost 
on many viewers.  It's one thing to have Prince's 'When Doves Cry' 
reformatted for choirboys in ROMEO + JULIET, but another to have McGregor 
and Kidman spouting Bernie Taupin lyrics as if they were poetry and talking 
in conversations made up entirely of lines from Jennifer Warnes, David 
Bowie, The Sweet, Wings, and other artists.  This might be the stuff of 
Postmodernism but it's also a depressing reminder that a number of new 
film-makers are cannibalistic: they don't make movies based on books any 
more, they make movies based on other movies.  Just to show how intertextual 
Luhrmann gets, Kidman's opening scene starts with her belting out 'Diamonds 
are a Girl's Best Friend', which is abruptly interrupted by a phrase from 
Madonna's 'Material Girl'.  Why?  Because the original Madonna video clip 
was itself a parody of the 'Diamonds' number from the film GENTLEMEN PREFER 
BLONDES.  At this stage Luhrmann isn't even making a movie based on a movie, 
but a movie based on a film clip based on a movie.  In the end, MOULIN ROUGE 
is left strutting its stuff like a Frankenstein monster covered in glitter.
Despite this pot-pourri approach, MOULIN ROUGE still manages to be 
refreshing and original.  This doesn't mean it's an original musical - the 
songs are well-known pop tunes that have been incorporated, mostly for 
humorous effect, into the storyline.  I don't have any complaint with this 
because it wasn't uncommon for musicals of the past to be made in a similar 
style, with tunes cobbled together from the likes of Gershwin, Porter and 
Berlin to ensure good box-office - even the classic SINGING IN THE RAIN is 
made up of songs taken from other films.  When it comes down to the bottom 
line, only one question needs to be asked: is this film worth seeing?  The 
answer is yes.  The high points outnumber the flaws (or, more likely, 
overwhelm them) and it is a gloriously cinematic spectacle which deserves to 
be seen and especially heard in a theater.  It outdoes everything Luhrmann 
has done to date, and while it may not be as cohesive as his earlier work it 
at least seems to have been the film he has always wanted to make.  Besides, 
anything featuring a cameo of pop princess Kylie Minogue as a hallucinatory 
green fairy has got to be worth checking out.

Review for Neco z Alenky (1988)
     This astonishing reworking of ALICE IN WONDERLAND was the first
feature to be made by Czech surrealist animator Jan Svankmayer after
two decades of producing short films.  He served his apprenticeship
well, employing all he had learned with his previous experiments to
fully realize this combination of stop-motion animation, live action,
and puppetry.  Lewis Carroll's classic story has always been too
erratically-paced and episodic to be successfully translated to film,
but Svankmajer makes the text completely his own.  It is his audacious,
subversive interpretation of Carroll's ALICE that makes this film so
fascinating.
     The Wonderland of Svankmajer's imagination is set entirely within
the confines of a series of connecting rooms.  We watch Alice
journeying down shabby stairwells and riding an industrial elevator,
and wonder if she is descending into some kind of Hell. At any rate,
the characters inhabiting it do that concept justice.  The denizens of
Wonderland are outcasts - they are assembled of leftovers (bones,
sawdust, furs ... the Caterpillar is merely a sock!) and do not inhabit
Wonderland so much as squat there. They're like the homeless and
down-at-heel of Wonderland, who have found a deserted building to
occupy.  Their faces are immobile and emotionless - the White Rabbit (a
scary character) has the same wild, fixed stare and clacking teeth
whether he's handing Alice an envelope or throwing plates at her.
Kristyna Kohoutova, who plays Alice, takes a neutral stance within
everything she encounters.  Svankmajer does not allow her much
expression - he even has her cover her face the only time she laughs -
and at several points in the story she actually becomes a puppet
herself.
     Svankmajer has gone on record as saying that all of his films are
political, but surely this comment is more appropriate to his short
subjects.  If what he says is to be taken literally then it is possible
to see a similarity between ALICE's Wonderland and the entropy of
postwar Eastern Europe.  There are cockroaches and nails in food, there
are re-animated animal corpses everywhere, rooms are littered with
debris, every door is locked and requires a key - it is certainly
barren and oppressive.  Is Svankmajer making a comment on his own
childhood?  It's certainly not for all tastes.  Cultists of the book
will find many of its familiar icons dramatically reworked in the film
(the Cheshire Cat is truly invisible - he's not even in it!) but should
bear in mind that as an animator, Svankmajer has adapted the story
primarily as a visual experience.  Hence the wordplay and verbal
conundrums of the book are gone, although there is the occasional
visual pun (e.g. socks in holes instead of holes in socks).  His unique
vision may be the most accurate representation of the mood of the books
since Tenniel established his original illustrations over a hundred
years ago.  A must-see - but definitely not with the intrusion of
television advertisements

Review for Freaked (1993)
Alex Winter, best known as Bill S. Preston in the Bill and Ted' films he 
made with Keanu Reeves, co-wrote, co-produced and co-directed this goofy 
schlock comedy.  It's almost a fanboy project dedicated to makeup FX films  
the kind of thing you wish would feature cameo appearances by Rick Baker, 
Dick Smith, Tom Savini and Rob Bottin.  Story starts with former child actor 
Ricky (Winter, who looks like a throwback to a 50s juvie feature) hiring 
himself out as a spokesperson for a big corporation with concerns in South 
America.  It's the last place in the world you'd expect to find a Freak 
Show, but that's what Winter and his friends run into, and then become a 
part of.  Usually this would signal trouble ahead for those in the audience 
who are less than impressed with the ick' factor that is the standard of 
most makeup FX sequences, but there's nothing to worry about in this story: 
the off-the-wall freak' makeup  and there is plenty of it   is in the 
service of comedy, not gross-out horror.
There's plenty of amusing material to choose from in the lineup of freaks 
that become Winters' allies, but my personal favorite would have to be Bob 
Goldthwaite's Sockhead' (that face! that voice!  a perfect combination!), 
who I find hysterically funny.  Randy Quaid, one of the few cast members not 
smothered in makeup, gives a jolly, cackling performance as the freakshow 
proprietor.  I'm impressed that Winter got the likes of Brooke Shields and 
Mr T to send themselves up so outrageously while also being game enough 
himself to be disfigured for most of the film's running time in laborious 
makeup (his buddy Reeves contributes an uncredited performance and is even 
more unrecognizable as Dawg Boy').  The humor of FREAKED is scattershot and 
falls flat a few times, but there's still a lot of gags to make it worth 
viewing.  And if you're tired of computer-generated visuals then you'll 
appreciate the domestic feel of the film's effects  there's a whole pile of 
latex on show and even some claymation (which includes a glimpse of the 
Cyclops from THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD).  It's an energetic, crafty piece 
which wears two faces: an independent feature that has overcome the 
limitations of a modest budget, and/or a slick studio effort that is 
low-tech by design.  Whatever the case, it still comes across as a personal 
project, as if Winter had always wanted to make a home movie with lots of 
cool monster makeup and saw his chance when he got into Hollywood.  It's 
clear that FREAKED is pitching for the youth market straight from its 
opening titles, which could easily stand alone as a video clip if you were 
to remove the credits.  Readers of Fangoria' will probably love it.

Title
Review for Smile (1975)
One of Michael Ritchie's better films:  a California town holds the state 
finals for the Young American Miss beauty pageant, and we are placed in the 
position of judges - not of the contestants but of the pageant itself.  
Since ridiculing beauty contests is  about as easy as shooting fish in a 
barrel, you'd be right to expect SMILE to be an all-out comedy.  It is funny 
(the kind of film that immediately attracts the phrase 'wickedly funny') but 
smart enough to keep its satire played relatively straight.  The pageant 
itself is low-key enough to be believable within the budget/facilities of 
the host town (Ritchie actually charged real audiences to watch the fake 
contest!) -  there's no need for high-stakes glitz-and-glamor  when we can 
see the same sort of facade exposed much more humbly and just as relevantly. 
  This approach also has the benefit of helping us sympathize with the 
contestants, who for the most part are a pretty down-to-earth and amiable 
group of girls.
The contestants' interviews, rehearsals and performances are the main thrust 
of SMILE's satire, but Ritchie and screenwriter Jerry Belson see a 
reflection in the small town itself.  I don't know who came up with the idea 
of casting Bruce Dern and Barbara Feldon as the pageant organizers but it 
was either a happy accident or just plain inspired.  What better role to 
exploit Dern's disarming grin and snake-oil voice than that of a car 
salesman?  And what better part for a car salesman to play than a beauty 
pageant judge - after all, the merchandise is similarly labeled, polished 
up, and displayed on stage to the accompaniment of smooth-talking patter.  
The connection between the contest and Dern himself is summed up when one of 
his friends mockingly accuses him of being just another Young American Miss. 
  I think it's more likely that Dern has become the pageant personified, a 
blatant symbol of all that is artificial.  It's impossible to tell when he's 
being sincere, even though he remains consistently loyal to the idea of the 
contest (when he utters down-home phrases like "holy heck" at points of 
exasperation, it seems to be the huckster in him still talking).   At the 
conclusion of the contest he sits alone at the judges' table, evaluating a 
lifestyle of dressing up for his lodge brothers, performing absurd rituals 
(even sillier than the pageant), selling used vehicles and judging contests 
("Gold this year!" he says approvingly when he sees his new official's 
badge).  It comes as a  nice moment when he finally drops his guard, loses 
his ever-present smile, and attempts to strike up a real conversation -  but 
then discovers that he can't be a 'real' person in his small-town world.
SMILE's matter-of-fact approach works well in its favor.  We might laugh at 
some of the cobbled-together items in the talent contest, but it's plain 
that these girls are only doing what they are best at, no matter what it 
turns out to be.  Despite the number of contestants, and their limited 
screen time, everyone seems to be a well-realized character (as opposed to 
the more satirical standards of caricature).  Familiar names in the lineup 
include Annette O'Toole, Melanie Griffith and Colleen Camp.  Charlie 
Chaplin's song 'Smile' is used effectively to open and close the film.  You 
have to wonder if Belson and Ritchie set the beauty contest in California 
just so they could get the Beach Boys' 'California Girls' on the soundtrack.

Title
Review for Bad Girls Go To Hell (1965)
....or, if they can't get that far, New York.  Shoestring-budget film 
making by NY auteur Doris Wishman, the only woman to really leave her 
mark in the exploitation industry, is recommended to those who are 
hell-bent on sampling everything from the sleaze/trash end of the cinema 
spectrum.  Everyone else would be advised to spend time elsewhere.  
Minimal plot concerns good housewife (Gigi Darlene) who inadvertently 
kills her sex-crazed janitor by knocking a plate over his head (breaking 
the plate would have probably sent the film over budget) and then goes 
on the lam to New York where she encounters several locals interested 
only in abusing her.  Film has several Wishman trademarks: a photo 
montage of opening titles, hand-held camerawork, bad dubbing (even the 
characters in SPEED RACER emote more believably than this), women 
dressing/undressing with their backs to the camera, women dancing in 
their underwear, and, of course, several closeups of feet.
Story bears analysis only as part of a phenomenon and not as any 
intrinsic artwork.  In the Wishman universe, women are helpless and men 
are bestial, but at least the consistency of her product develops its 
own reality.  Watch three of her films in a row and you'll find that the 
snazzy music, absence of sets/props, and confined apartment interiors 
become almost normal.  This works in favor of BAD GIRLS GO TO HELL, 
because the mindlessness of the story, which episodically relates the 
protagonist's bad experiences one after another, is in keeping with the 
idea of a World of Punishment: the innocent accidentally transgresses 
and must suffer by being inexplicably mistreated by everyone she meets.  
It finally gets to the stage when the sight of her appearing with her 
suitcases in hand is laughable.  There's more: you'll be bewildered when 
Detective 'Tom' enters a room via the wardrobe - did Wishman really 
expect us to believe it was a front door?  And you won't forget 
Darlene's 'acrobatic dance'.  At least these absurd touches prevent us 
from being offended by the film's sex and violence.  None of it is 
believable: characters don't behave or react the way we would expect in 
real life, but they do behave exactly the way we would expect them to in 
an exploitation movie.  *Everything*  Wishman does is in service to the 
genre.  Her dialogue (she uses pseudonyms on the credits) is not bad 
enough to be entertaining, but easy, predictable and banal.  You'll have 
heard every line of dialogue in a hundred other movies.  Still, while 
cheapies like this are easy to knock, they do occupy a valid place in 
cinema history.  For example, this is one of the few films of the time 
where audiences could see a married couple showering together!  And you 
have to give Wishman her due for entering a male-only genre and making a 
success of it.  I don't know if that's any excuse for her making such 
brain-numbing efforts as NUDE ON THE MOON, however.


Title
Review for Valentino (1977)
Typically raucous Ken Russell biography is a bit of an odd one out in his 
catalogue.  I'm not sure why he was attracted to the story of silent-movie 
idol Rudolph Valentino after several years of tackling composers and 
artists, but I would guess that the allure of recreating the old days of 
Hollywood is a pretty potent lure for any film director in love with his 
craft.
Despite flaws, and its liberal interpretation of the facts, VALENTINO at 
least introduces the man to those casual viewers that may have never heard 
of him.  At best, it implants the image of Rudolph Valentino as a screen 
phenomenon of the silent era and points out the distinctive impact of the 
medium.  It's summed up quite simply in one shot which shows an audience 
composed entirely of women watching a Valentino film while the camera moves 
in on one and transports her into the events on the screen.  Russell, 
however, is not one for understatement  to compensate for the lack of 
filmic events that take place in Valentino's life he inflates scenes with 
loud music and hysterical, obnoxious characters.  Given the right subject 
matter, Russell's excessive style can be effective (ALTERED STATES, THE 
DEVILS, THE BOY FRIEND, TOMMY).  Here, it's just puzzling  at least for any 
viewer unacquainted with the notorious director.
Cast as the central character is ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, who shares 
not only his forename with the screen idol but a workable physical likeness. 
  Aware that this was Nureyev's acting debut, Russell wanted him to speak 
more with body language than words, but the dancer saw this as a chance to 
develop an acting career (which ironically paralleled Valentino's own 
artistic progress).  At times he is striking in the part, particularly when 
he is on the dance floor.  He also alternates between wooden and hammy, but 
that conforms to our stereotype of silent film actors anyway and isn't 
necessarily a distraction.  The interesting cast also includes Leslie Caron, 
Felicity Kendal, Carol Kane, Michelle Phillips (from The Mamas and the 
Papas) and John Ratzenberger in a bit part.  And where on Earth did Russell 
dig up Huntz Hall?
By the film's end we are still left with the impression of Valentino as an 
icon, not a man.  It's a curious thing, which we might like to blame on the 
story, Russell's handling of the material or Nureyev's performance.  But I 
think the answer is simpler than that:  Valentino was and always will be an 
icon because although we know him by sight we have never heard him speak, 
henceforth freezing him in time exclusively by image.  He also died young, 
reinforcing that the image would never develop, grow old, or change.  
Valentino was, for all intents and purposes, the smoldering characters he 
presented on screen.  Could any biographical picture have transcended that 
legacy?  What attracted Russell to the project  Valentino's legend  is 
also the same thing that ensured his film would never be entirely 
successful.

Title
Review for Vérités et mensonges (1975)
Playful documentary by Orson Welles may make your head spin, especially 
the chop-and-switch of the first ten minutes.  Thoroughly hermeneutic 
work is quintessential Welles even more than any of his fictional 
features, showing us Welles the actor, Welles the raconteur, Welles the 
parlor-magician, and Welles the film-maker, who blends his subject (art 
forgery) into the business of film fakery with a devilish sleight of 
hand.
Film's hall-of-mirrors approach has danger of becoming irritating after 
a while, but Welles guides us through its strange events with 
confidence.  Most of it is concerned with art forger Elmyr de Hory, who 
quietly circulated fake 'unknown' works of artists from his home in 
Ibeza.  Once uncovered he became the subject of attention by writer 
Clifford Irving....who then upstaged him by himself becoming the 
perpetrator of a hoax upon producing a fake biography of Howard Hughes.  
Hughes gives a telephone interview stating that he's never heard of 
Irving - but there is no guarantee that it is really Hughes giving the 
interview.  Meanwhile, Hory suspects that Irving has stashed some of his 
forged paintings for future sales; others think that the handwritten 
Hughes documents were forged for Irving by Hory; there is even 
speculation that Hory isn't a real fake, but a fake fake, and that the 
so-called 'forged' artworks are real paintings.  Get the idea?  Welles 
revels in the duplicity of his subject, reminding us time and time again 
that we can't trust the medium of film either (remember, this is the 
individual who pulled off the biggest media hoax in history with his 
famous 'War of the Worlds' broadcast).
Film takes a break from the machinations of its tricky story after an 
hour while Welles talks of the events that led him to Hollywood to make 
CITIZEN KANE (which at first was going to be based not on Randolph 
William Hearst but....Howard Hughes!), then spends the last twenty 
minutes of the film recounting an anecdote about Picasso.  At first it 
seems that this has been included into the documentary because the 
Hory/Irving/Hughes material couldn't be stretched any further - but keep 
watching: Welles isn't through with that idea yet.  It's a delight 
seeing him playing to the camera, sitting at a restaurant with friends, 
laughing while interviewing a gallery owner, studying footage through a 
moviola, and entertaining a youngster with conjuring tricks.  As Welles 
prefers not to discuss his films in interviews it's the closest peek 
into his mind we're likely to get.   


Title
Review for O.C. & Stiggs (1985)
Everybody, including me, who'd read National Lampoon's magazine feature 
'Summer of O.C. and Stiggs' rejected this film version when it eventually 
showed up.  Firstly, it's just not that funny -  at least not in the way 
that the original stories were.  Secondly, it suffers from monumental 
miscasting - not of the actors, but of director Robert Altman.  I can't 
understand how Altman ever got involved with this assignment, as his 
distinctive, observational satire is poles apart from the sophomoric  humor 
that trademarks the Lampoon.  We'd already seen the magazine's classic story 
'Vacation 58' watered down for the film that would become NATIONAL LAMPOON'S 
VACATION, so in retrospect shouldn't have maintained high hopes for any 
further film projects based on their catalogue.  Perversely, NATIONAL 
LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE, which was a huge hit and did manage to capture the 
magazine's anarchic tone, was written for the screen first and translated 
into a magazine edition afterwards.
O.C. AND STIGGS would have been a tough sell anyway.  As written, the 
characters are hilarious because they are unconscionably cruel - their sole 
reason for existing is to pursue an ongoing campaign of persecution against 
the wealthy Schwab family.  It's easier to get away with this sort of thing 
in print than it is on film, so to make the characters more 
audience-friendly, the screen versions are given a background history.  This 
is a major mistake, because it's the absence of motive that makes the 
original stories so funny: it was the mission of O.C. and Stiggs to make the 
Schwab's life a living hell for no other reason than they were Schwabs.  
What the film-makers didn't recognize was that in this context the cruelty 
of the story couldn't be taken seriously (or offensively) because there was 
no rational framework on which it could hang.  At least Altman does manage 
to capture the surreal tone of the story to some degree.  His distinct 
directorial style finds actors ignoring the absurd subtext of the story and 
seemingly making up their own film within a controlled visual landscape of 
studied pans and slow zooms.
In the final reckoning it looks as though Altman is more at ease when he is 
directing the veteran players in his cast - Ray Walston and Dennis Hopper 
provide the film with its most amusing moments even though their approach 
and characters are entirely different.  It's amusing at first to see Hopper 
decked out like he was still a photojournalist in APOCALYPSE NOW, but less 
amusing when this connection is blatantly spoofed with a helicopter charging 
along to Wagner in the finale.  The ending of the film aims to be farcical, 
but Altman's pacing is all wrong.  It reminds me of the instructions that 
Alan Alda is given in SWEET LIBERTY, in which he is told that to make a 
successful film he must show nudity, destruction of property, and defiance 
of authority.  This would seem to suit the mission statement of the Lampoon 
quite happily, but not Altman -  he tries for two out of three, but it looks 
more like two falls out of three, and he loses both times.  Ultimately, O.C. 
AND STIGGS is either a disappointment or just bewildering, depending on 
whether or not you've read the source material beforehand.  It's easier 
going the second time around if you're willing to give it another chance, 
and it is definitely a unique product.  On those grounds alone, it can't be 
dismissed completely out of hand.

Title
Review for Let It Ride (1989)
Comedy set during one day at the racetrack may be torture for serious 
punters.  Richard Dreyfuss finds he is on an uncharacteristic winning 
streak, but instead of cashing in his ticket he keeps parlaying his bet.  
As each race runs its course he finds himself seduced by the new levels 
of track society that open up before him.  You'll find yourself wanting 
to scream "Stop!" when Dreyfuss is about to make what may be his last 
gamble.  Despite being restricted to one setting, Ernest Moreton's 
script (from a novel by Jay Cronley) contains a real sense of 
progression.  Dreyfuss starts his day kneeling before a toilet in a 
punter's bar, but gradually moves through the different strata of the 
racetrack world - the Jockey Club, the cashier's office, the counting 
room; similarly, as his winnings accrue and he starts planning what to 
do with the money, we see his future being laid out before us; and of 
course there are the relationships that keep developing throughout the 
course of the story as he gets more attention.  Here, having too much 
money is just as offensive to the regular high-rollers than having too 
little.  Jennifer Tilly, in another of her bubblehead roles, seems to be 
attracted to Dreyfuss only because of his newly-won money (or is it 
luck?) but remains strangely consistent throughout the story.  The 
others don't seem to have any particular stance - cashier Robbie 
Coltrane does a 180o  turn, Dreyfuss' friends keep vacillating, and wife 
Teri Garr is in a state of constant bewilderment.
Dreyfuss gives an energetically comic performance - the kind of thing we 
thought he'd left behind with THE GOODBYE GIRL (and just the role Jack 
Lemmon would have played if this film had been made twenty years 
earlier).  He's an ideal choice for the role of a small-time gambler - 
his slight stature, beady eyes, and moustache make him look right at 
home at the track.  Garr, an appealing actress, is once again saddled 
with the Wife/Mother role (she'd already had one marriage on the rocks 
with Dreyfuss in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).  The fringe characters, right down 
to the smallest bit parts, all have personality.  Everyone has their own 
system, mostly reliant on intuition - although LET IT RIDE doesn't give 
the impression that it is pro-gambling.  Rather, its message is that 
there is no workable system, and that everyone has one "really good day" 
inside them, whether at the track, the office, the sports field, or 
anywhere else.  It's a feel-good movie without the schmaltz - the dreamy 
look on Dreyfuss' face during the vital seconds of his last race 
indicate that in his mind he has already won.  Or, to adopt a truism, 
it's not whether you win or lose, but how you place the bet that counts.  
The racetrack is utilized well as the film's central setting -  it's 
nice for a change to see a cinema portrayal of the track which is sunny, 
friendly and lively, instead of the usual seediness and vice that 
usually ends up on screen.

Review for Railway Children, The (1970)
Heartwarming film written and directed by character actor Lionel
Jeffries from E. Nesbitt's novel.  It may remind you in spirit of
Julio Cortazar's beautiful short story `The End of the Game'.  Set at
the turn of the century, story relates adventures of three Edwardian
children who move to a country house in Yorkshire after their father
is mysteriously taken away by police.  As their mother refuses to
inform the children of the exact nature of their circumstances, the
country retreat, with its stone cottages and buttercup fields, becomes
a kind of balmy, nostalgic limbo.  It's an inbetween world where the
children must while away the hours until their father's return - if,
in fact, he will return.  Reason this classic is so popular must
surely be because of its prewar innocence that yet manages to capture
elements of what it was like for urban and suburban Britons during the
Blitz:  there are children being relocated into the country by
railway; a father absent from home on "government business"; a brave
mother making do; a family playing at "being poor".  This strong sense
of reminiscence is established right from frame one - in the first few
minutes of the film we see the camera pan lovingly over mementoes and
trinkets; we see a photograph being taken, a Christmas dinner, a
spinning zoetrope, a panto performance of Peter Pan - and while it is
all rather sentimental, it never becomes mawkish.
It's wonderful how Jeffries creates an idyllic world that is entirely
plausible, a world where strangers are kind and one good deed always
deserves another.  His splendid work is more than matched by a
sterling cast.  You'll really want to spend more time with these
children and share their adventures - from the older sister Bobby
(Jenny Agutter, who has as much poise at 16 in a middy blouse or a
pinafore than she would as an adult), the younger sister Phyllis (A
cheerful, brunette Sally Thomsett, who would later find fame as the
dippy blonde Jo in the sitcom MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE, and was actually
older than Agutter), and brother Peter (Gary Warren, who starred in
the cult children's BBC serial CATWEAZLE).  Their performances are
matched equally by the adults Dinah Sheridan and most notably Bernard
Cribbins as a humble-yet-proud stationmaster.
This film has such a generous, humane spirit to it that you may feel
your eyes mist over during several occasions.  The finale is a
guaranteed tearjerker, but I always get a lump in my throat at the
very end when Agutter softly tells the audience "Goodbye", knowing
that she could not realize she was well on the way to becoming a
celebrated and popular actress in the film industry.  THE RAILWAY
CHILDREN probably works even better now than it did then in 1970, as
the nostalgia it evokes for those times works in tandem with the
nostaliga of the story itself.  They don't make films like this
anymore.  William Mervyn, as a train-travelling old gentlemen, sums it
up in one word.  "Charming....charming!"   Footnote:  Agutter,
Thomsett, and their screen father Iain Cuthbertson were reunited a
quarter-century later when the British Film Institute brought them
back together to a cheering crowd at the Yorkshire Station, whereupon
their film was commemorated with a special plaque. 

Title
Review for Italian Job, The (1969)
Cult favorite is best remembered for its unexpected ending and a
robbery sequence featuring three Mini Coopers.  Michael Caine is
Charlie Croker, a small-time crook who sees his chance to make the big
time by hijacking a bullion shipment in Turin.  His plan is sponsored
by English gentleman Mr Bridger (Noel Coward), a high-class criminal
who lives the high life in a London prison.  As protagonists, Caine
and Coward couldn't be more different, but between them they encompass
the spectrum of all that is essentially English.  Coward, who waves
his hand like royalty, is accompanied throughout the film by a number
of pro-British anthems (Rule Brittania, God Save the Queen, The
British Grenadiers) that eventually culminate in a football chant from
his fellow inmates; Caine is a Jack-the-lad who hasn't lost touch with
people on the street.  Picture's tongue-in-cheek patriotism
(ostensibly the `real' motive behind the robbery) paints a world where
there is co-operation between the classes, between criminals and the
law, between the common laborer and the educated professional, all
united as a matter of national pride. 
The film's images of British criminals abroad - invading foreign turf,
so to speak - is well complemented by location shooting in Italy,
particularly the crowded Turin streets and the majestic alpine roads. 
Picture's highlight, of course, is the robbery itself, in which three
patriotically-colored Minis (which always drive in order of red,
white, and blue) weave through plazas and rooftops in order to make
their getaway.  Original ending, as written, tied up loose ends with
Caine's girlfriend and the Mafia (who simply drop out of the story in
the final cut), but the substitute ending is more in keeping with the
film's cavalier attitude.  Film has humor, action, but surprisingly
little suspense.  Caine, who was enthusiastic about this project, is
curiously flat and mannered - it's almost as if a Michael Caine
impersonater dubbed his voice. Peter Collinson, who seems to enjoy
filming cars rolling down cliffs, directed from an original screenplay
by Troy Kennedy Martin.  Quincy Jones supplied the music - an odd
choice!  Worth seeing in widescreen Panavision.

Review for Trollsyn (1994)
Jostedalen, 1349.  14th-Century Europe is ravaged by the Black Death,
but Norway is one of the hardest hit nations, losing nearly two thirds
of its population in the plague's wake.  Even given these astonishing
figures, you'd think that seven-year-old Maren (Julia Onsager Steen)
would have had at least one or two survivors to keep her company after
the pandemic strikes her family and friends.  But no, Maren is the 
only one to be spared.  If you ever wanted to view a film that depicts a young
girl wandering about a picturesque valley alone reciting rhymes to
herself, then this is that movie, and not much else.  The `Second
Sight' of the title refers only to the final scenes, in which Maren is
found by neighboring villagers and attributed with clairvoyant powers
(she wears her `birthcap' - umbilical membrane - as an amulet).  It's
a talent she's not sure she wants, or even has, although like everyone
else in her world she puts her faith in the powers of the arcane for
survival.  Almost the only time we ever hear her talk is when she is
chanting to drive away wolves, bears, or maleficent spirits.  Film
draws an interesting correlation between the talismanic manifestations
of child logic and the belief systems of the medieval era per se. 
It's fascinating to see her single-handedly and unconsciously keeping
the ritualistic sensibilities of her culture alive, even though we
know these beliefs to be doomed and misinformed.  
The lack of incident in the film might be overlooked if it was meant
to be, say, a lyric piece, or experience of awakening, but it strives
for neither.  This makes me think that its portrayal of events is
intended to be as simple as any medieval tale would aim to tell it. 
It could be that director Ola Solum wants his story to reach us at a
primal level:  we are not watching a story, we are merely watching
life.  Whatever, this leaves young Steen with the task of carrying the
bulk of the film, and she's not given a lot to do other than look
anxious and shout the occasional chant.  However, she makes a
believable peasant girl (it's amazing what a liberal application of
dirt can do) and looks right at home in her setting - I didn't realize
how taken in I was by her performance until the final freeze-frame. 
The surrounding countryside is also suitably wild and medieval:  Solum
employs a vertiginous handheld wide-angle lens to good effect. 
Director Anja Breien wrote the screenplay.  Jan Garbarek supplied the
rather eclectic score.

Review for Mission to Mars (2000)
I'm surprised at the hostile reaction that Brian De Palma's first foray into 
Sci-Fi has received from some critics.  While purposefully avoiding all 
prior knowledge of the film's content I was still aware of the scathing tone 
of many of its reviews.  Or perhaps it's just that those who would shout 
things down have the louder voices, relegating any more favorable comment to 
the sidelines.
Undeniably, MISSION TO MARS is patchy, but that's nothing new.  De Palma's 
track record is notorious for this kind of spasmodic final product, his most 
unified film THE UNTOUCHABLES being an exception.  At the other end of the 
scale, THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES has been his biggest flop, but even then 
it's still okay as a film: it's only when compared to Tom Wolfe's terrific 
book that it fails.  It's these comparative elements that may have irked 
many a reviewer of MISSION TO MARS.  The most obvious homage/ripoff (take 
your pick) is 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and De Palma's beautiful visuals (of 
artificial-gravity; the seemingly effortless, assured camerawork in the 
spacecraft; the figures in Martian orbit) evoke a sense of wonder and easily 
hold their own against that classic.  Conceptwise, it's another matter.  
Science Fiction has been all but milked dry (the last new big thing was 
William Gibson's notions of cyberspace), and when MISSION TO MARS makes it 
clear that it's heading towards a revelatory punchline it can only mean 
trouble.  There's very little left that's new, and I can see film's payoff 
causing SF buffs to roll their eyes and say `they did this in (insert name 
of book/film/TWILIGHT ZONE episode) already!'.
That leaves us with structure, and once again De Palma has shown that he is 
a craftsman of bravura set-pieces.  It's also reminded us that a lot of the 
stuff between those set-pieces doesn't hold together so well, and in MISSION 
TO MARS you can start picking at exact moments where the seams start to 
show.  On the negative side, the opening earthbound scenes appear to have 
been written from The Screenwriter's Guide to Expository Dialogue' (it's a 
made-up title; don't look for it);  the image of the alien at the end is 
embarrassingly twee; De Palma doesn't really know how to use music 
effectively in emotional/dramatic scenes  he seems to have used Ennio 
Morricone's score in much the same way that he overstated his Pino Donaggio 
scores to kitschy effect in his early thrillers; and the storyline is cut 
into two uneven halves, the first being realistic, the second being 
fantastic.
I don't necessarily regard this last criticism as a failing point; in fact I 
enjoy scripts that aren't straitjacketed into arcs' or formulas.  Also  
and in spite of those weak opening scenes  the tone of this film is unlike 
any other De Palma has made.  For once he presents his characters as if they 
were more than scripted pawns in a screenplay; as astronauts, Tim Robbins, 
Connie Nielsen, Gary Sinese, and Jerry O'Connell have an easy, natural bond. 
  And this time, when someone dies in a De Palma film, it resonates.  For my 
money, the pluses in MISSION TO MARS easily outweigh the minuses.  It looks 
fabulous on a big screen, plays out some great sequences, and has a genial 
mix of science and fiction.  Granted, there are several little stupid 
moments scattered throughout, but this at least may provide some 
post-screening entertainment if you see it with a group of friends (my vote 
for The Stupidest Bit is that dumb scene where the rescue team pauses to 
unearth the flag and replant itpersonally my priority upon reaching the 
objective of a six-month mission would have been to get inside the damned 
ship first).
It comes back to what I've always advocated - that the less you know about a 
film beforehand the better.  My guess is that the reviewers who have carped 
most about De Palma's film will be those who either felt he wasn't equipped 
to work in the genre in the first place, or those who were led to expect an 
entirely different experience.  Another 2001?  Not likely; there will hardly 
be another of those in our lifetime.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS?  No, that was 
pointedly one director's personal vision. APOLLO 13?  No, that was fact, and 
this is fiction.  MISSION TO MARS is.well, it's just MISSION TO MARS and 
that's all there is to it.  In the meantime, and until studios realize that 
hype is the worst enemy a movie can have, you would be best to take a leaf 
out of Alexander Pope's book and maintain a little ignorance before you buy 
your tickets.  Or to put it another way: the best way to watch a film is in 
the dark.
Postscript: It's reassuring to know that in the year 2020 the Dr Pepper logo 
will still remain the same.


Title
Review for Trap, The (1966)
There are at least half a dozen other films with this title, but this
is the one in which Canadian trapper Oliver Reed shows up in town with
a mind to take a wife back to his log cabin in the mountain
wilderness.  He buys mute Rita Tushingham for a thousand dollars, and
the expected scenes of conflict and resolution ensue.  Film's premise
relies heavily on the convention that the audience must witness - and
indeed, expect - change in the two lead characters in order to make
the story worthwhile (Personally, I'm not that worried by films which
refuse to change or develop their protagonists).  Reed, playing
against a character who is mute, seems to make it his duty to act
enough for the both of them, stamping through the scenery and barking
in a nearly unfathomable accent.  It's a very cartoony performance -
by the film's end he virtually becomes Pegleg Pete - but it's obvious
he's playing it broadly to give Tushingham ample material to react to.
Reed doesn't see Tushingham's muteness as a handicap, just as he fails
to recognize any other quality in her besides the immediacy of her
companionship.  The bearlike Reed understands only nature, red in
tooth and claw.  His business and existence revolve around the
hunting, trapping, and killing of animals:  he is the king of the
mountain, and all others, including Tushingham (who he refers to as
`rabbit') are subservient to him.  It's not surprising that his
surname is La Bete (`The Beast'), and indeed many parallels to the
story and situation of `Beauty and the Beast' can be drawn.  The
isolated wilderness might well be the far-off mysterious forests of
any fairy tale.  But they are the `trap' of the title, along with the
`marriage', the snowbound cabin, the inhibitions of the characters,
and of course the ever-present animal traps Reed carries with him.  It
is Tushingham that makes the more significant escape from these traps,
but I don't believe her newly-developed independence or
self-sufficiency are as important as her action to make a lifestyle
choice of her own.  By the film's conclusion it is not so much her
decision as her confidence that matters.
Pace of film doesn't flag and manages many dramatic moments for a
two-character piece.  The exciting (though improbable) scene where
Reed is being stalked by wolves could easily have been lifted from a
horror movie - this isn't wholly unexpected considering  Sidney Hayers
was director.  Composer Ron Goodwin cites this score as being his most
popular with concert audiences (how could it beat out 633 SQUADRON?). 
Reed would end up in a very similar situation twenty years later,
partnered with the considerably less inhibited Amanda Donohoe in
Nicolas Roeg's CASTAWAY.

Review for Stir of Echoes (1999)
In summary, this film can be outlined in a single sentence, which should be 
enough to trigger the warning SPOILER AHEAD in most people's minds.  I won't 
divulge its premise here if you've managed to avoid it thus far, but I will 
say this: for a basic story, STIR OF ECHOES does a pretty good job of 
looking like unfamiliar territory.
There's also a hint of the familiar involved as well, which is why I like 
this film: it constantly refers to its title.  Kevin Bacon is a 
self-confessed 'ordinary' working stiff who is put under hypnosis as part of 
a parlor trick and then finds himself haunted by hallucinations.  
Writer-director David Koepp puts his own spin on Richard Matheson's novel, 
revealing new characters and snippets of information in an effectively 
serpentine manner.  Bacon's visions are somehow connected to real events 
either happening in the past, the future, or the very present.  Sometimes 
they are unsettling flashforwards into his own life, other times unfocused 
scenes from places and people unknown to him (the film's one irony is that 
Bacon's occupation as a lineman requires him to 'make connections' and 
maintain lines of communication).  It's all very intriguing, but Koepp, more 
experienced as a writer than a director, makes a conscious choice not to 
sustain it.  Aware that there is only so much mystery an audience can take, 
he turns the second half of the story into a sort of practical reaction to 
the first.  By this point Koepp has been generous enough with his choice of 
visions to enable us to piece together the underlying story and even the 
pattern of events likely to follow.  In what amounts to a cleverly subtle 
crossover the audience is unwittingly placed into the protagonist's shoes, 
having the required amount of prescience to predict key images and scenes of 
its own.  And we have been very neatly prepped for this by the hypnosis 
scene, during which Bacon is told to imagine he is sitting in a darkened 
movie theatre (of course the screen turns black at this point, and it 
becomes *us* in that subjective chair), just one of many moments in the 
movie, creepy, funny, or just nifty, that may manage a smirk of delight from 
you.
It's what is operating below the surface that gives STIR OF ECHOES edginess. 
  Ask yourself why you feel this film seems to keep pushing itself anxiously 
forward and you might notice the restless backdrop surrounding its 
characters.  There is a sense of great masses of people journeying and 
relocating themselves, as if the voices of the unconscious are forever 
pressing around us.  The crossover/connection/journey motif is emphasized by 
background traffic noise, trains roaring by and passenger jets flying 
overhead; a line of stalled cars causes a precognition from Bacon which in 
turn leads to a crowded bus station; and even at the film's end, when all 
seems resolved, the last word we see drawn to the camera is 'Moving'.  
Significantly, the final frames linger on reflections from the windows of a 
moving car, the soundtrack implying that this particular journey is far from 
over.
STIR OF ECHOES has drawn much comparison with THE SIXTH SENSE, but only 
because of its timing.  The more obvious match, if you have to make one, is 
THE SHINING.  Here too we have a boy connected to the spirit world by an 
invisible friend; fleeting visions of the past and future; a family/marriage 
under stress; a father who shares a diluted version of his young son's 
telepathic powers; an older black man who recognizes these powers on sight; 
a father becoming unhinged (when he snaps at his wife in the back yard, 
Bacon seems a lot like Jack Nicholson - otherwise his performance is 
completely his own, and a finely-tuned one at that) and a bewildered 
wife/mother armed with a knife.  The last scene of the film needs only an 
intermission to separate it from the opening shots of THE SHINING, which 
could be a logical extension and conclusion to the fledging powers at work 
in this story.  The echoes continue to reverberate.  In-joke: the family's 
babysitter reads a Matheson novel, 'The Shrinking Man'.  I read 'A Stir of 
Echoes' several years ago, and have forgotten much of it except for some 
detail about a woman in a yellow raincoat.perhaps those echoes of long ago 
make me an ideal viewer for this film.  I even owned the exact same 
paperback as the babysitter.  I'm sitting in a darkened movie theater.I am 
getting sleepy.


Title
Review for Thrill Killers, The (1964)
After force-feeding my brain RAT PFINK A BOO BOO, I'd pledged never 
again to watch any film by Z-grade writer-director-actor Ray Dennis 
Steckler.  But I was surprised to find THE THRILL KILLERS a much more 
tightly-made piece of work.  As it stands, it's probably Steckler's best 
film, though admittedly that isn't saying a lot.  Tightly edited, with a 
jazzy score and some involving sequences, it's a cut above most other 
Z-features, but also shares their pitfalls.  Story basically recounts 
the encounters between psychotics and anyone unfortunate enough to run 
into them, providing Stecker with an excuse to string together a number 
of set pieces.  Its main problem is that characters belong to different 
stories - it's like Steckler started filming four different projects and 
then decided to put them all together for the last half.  At the start 
we're not even sure who the main character is supposed to be, or how 
other characters are meant to relate to each other.  
THE THRILL KILLERS' best feature is that it's wonderfully unpredictable, 
although this may be a natural consequence of Steckler's seemingly 
undisciplined approach.  He doesn't play by the rules of conventional 
movies and doesn't guarantee the safety of any of the characters.  This 
results in some inspired, demented moments.  My favorite is when one 
psycho makes a phone call to an even more psychotic acquaintance, asking 
for help to get away from his 'crazy' friends!  Steckler isn't really 
playing for laughs, though.  In fact much of the violence, though 
offscreen, is unsettling (Steckler himself is well cast as thug 'Mad 
Dog' Glick).   As a one-man show, Steckler has talent (next to Z-grade 
alumnus Herschell Gordon Lewis, he's Orson Welles), but it is uneven.  
It would have been interesting to see what he would have done if 
contracted by a studio with a bigger budget - I believe this could have 
been regarded as a classic B-feature if it had been made with more 
experienced actors and writers.  If you've never seen a film by an indie 
director before, have a look.  Just don't spend more than a dollar on 
it.


Title
Review for Body Snatchers (1993)
I don't know why anyone felt the need to produce another remake of 1956's 
classic sci-fi/horror film INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, yet here it is, 
and the lineup of creative talent behind it is promising.  Check out this 
intriguing combination:  writer-director Larry Cohen (screenplay credit), 
writer-director Stuart Gordon (story credit), and writer-director Abel 
Ferrara (who gets the directing chore despite being the only one of the 
three to show no previous interest in the genre).  It sounds as if the 
resulting film might be a body snatcher designed by committee, but the end 
result is a fairly tight product.
Prior knowledge makes this difficult viewing - there's little suspense or 
surprise because by now we have come to know the story so well: a few people 
discover that their family, friends, and neighbors are gradually being 
'replaced' by emotionally void duplicates and then find themselves running 
for their lives.  Story is faithful to the original (and the Jack Finney 
novel) in concept only.  Its two major changes are firstly that the central 
protagonist is a 17-year old girl (Gabrielle Anwar), and secondly that the 
small-town setting (changed to a big city in Philip Kaufman's 1978 version) 
has been overshadowed by a military base.  It would seem that what we have 
here is some ready-to-bake commentary on army personnel sacrificing their 
individuality to become a gestalt of emotionless drones, bla-bla-bla, but 
fortunately the story avoids this route and takes the more personal touch of 
paralleling the invasion of the alien 'body snatchers' with the 'invasion' 
of a new stepmother into Anwar's home (a creepy performance by Meg Tilly).  
As far as Anwar is concerned, her mother has already been replaced; the 
alien-invader scenario that follows is the realization/externalization of 
her fears now brought forth for everyone else to see.  Ferrara keeps the 
human element at the forefront of the story by shooting much of BODY 
SNATCHERS in closeup and midshot, letting faces and bodies fill the frame.  
This keeps the film real and down-to-earth until the first FX sequence, 
which may or may not be an improvement on previous versions depending on 
your point of view.  One of the more frustrating elements of the 1956 film 
for me as a young, first-time viewer, was the total lack of explanation 
concerning the body-transfer from seed pod to human copy.  
Ferrara/Cohen/Gordon present a simple, workable explanation - although it 
may be argued that it is scarier *not* to know anything of the process, and 
it was this lack of  information that contributed to the nightmarish quality 
of the original.
I don't think the FX are as big a problem as the decision to have Anwar 
narrating the story in flashback from frame one, however.  Automatically we 
are assured that her character will be still be around by the end of the 
story, which robs BODY SNATCHERS of a pivotal element of suspense.  I can't 
believe a writer as seasoned as Cohen would have let so obvious a slipup get 
by him.  But then again, I find it surprising to see Abel Ferrara packaging 
a film so uncharacteristic of his usual down-in-the-dirt urban dramas.  Has 
anyone checked their backyards for seed pods lately?


Title
Review for Wilby Conspiracy, The (1975)
Not the best-known film in the careers of Michael Caine and Sidney Poitier, 
but certainly worth catching.  Don't let the homogeneous Robert Ludlum-like 
title put you off - THE WILBY CONSPIRACY is an adventure yarn with enough 
odd flourishes to earn itself a cult audience.  Caine is a British mining 
engineer vacationing in Capetown who meets his new lawyer girlfriend 
(Prunella Gee) for lunch and ends up on the run to Johannesburg with one of 
her clients (Poitier), a black activist newly released from several years in 
jail.  It looks like some serious exchanges about politics, South Africa, 
and apartheid are being set up to take place between Caine and the 
handcuffed Poitier, (THE DEFIANT ONES springs to mind fairly quickly), but 
you'll have to watch Richard Attenborough's CRY FREEDOM if you prefer your 
chase movies to have a more political bent.  THE WILBY CONSPIRACY raises 
many provocative issues in its opening scenes and then leaves them to 
ferment as background material.  All we have to know about Caine and 
Poitier's escapade is that it is politically motivated - the specifics 
aren't necessary.
The best thing about THE WILBY CONSPIRACY is the wry, lurking humor 
displayed in its snappy dialogue and unusual asides (my favorite is when 
Poitier visits a fellow conspirator who runs a dental practice while Caine 
pretends to watch a movie in Hindi).  Throw in former Miss India Persis 
Khambatta and a very youthful Rutger Hauer piloting his own plane, and how 
can you resist?  But there's more:  the film is stolen by Nicol Williamson's 
laid-back performance as a chain-smoking government security officer who 
seems to occupy a South Africa all of his own, stramming about the 
countryside and remarking "All righty" whenever he's ready to move on.  The 
characters and cast alone could probably carry this movie, but the storyline 
is also engaging.  It splits easily into thirds, each section presenting the 
protagonists with a problem to solve, i.e. a flight from the authorities, an 
operation to retrieve some diamonds, and a plan to cross the border.  It's 
worth noting that this story would have been handled differently if filmed 
twenty years later - the fairly difficult but straightforward trials faced 
by the characters would have become over-elaborate and ultimately 
unrealistic set pieces replete with stunts.  The simplicity of the WILBY 
CONSPIRACY is what gives it its charm, but more importantly it places the 
protagonists' goals within their reach, preventing it from becoming entirely 
unbelievable.  THE WILBY CONSPIRACY is also a lot easier to enjoy now that 
the business of apartheid has been dispensed with in South Africa - it's 
probably just as well the story downplayed this element to begin with.  
Because of the touchy subject matter, director Ralph Nelson filmed on 
location in Kenya instead of South Africa.  Jack-of-all-trades Rod Amateau 
(a former producer, stuntman, actor and sitcom director) wrote the script, 
based on Harold Nebenzal's novel.

Title
Review for Black Cauldron, The (1985)
I can't believe it took nine writers to script what turned out to be an 
essentially simple story for this $25 million animated Disney feature.  THE 
BLACK CAULDRON tentatively tried some variation in approach for the studio, 
which hadn't produced any equal to its past classics for many years.  A 
younger generation of animators worked on the film for five years, included 
computer enhancement for the first time, and released it in 70mm.  It 
attracted some interest but didn't appeal to the public as much as the 
studio's future hit THE LITTLE MERMAID, which resulted in Disney sticking to 
its tried-and-true musical adaptations of fairy tales and folk stories.  
It's annoying, because it would have been intriguing to see what new 
direction THE BLACK CAULDRON might have encouraged had it been successful.
THE BLACK CAULDRON is a combination of the first two books of Lloyd 
Alexander's Prydain series.  The darker hues of these stories make them an 
unusual choice for Disney, but the film is effective entertainment for 
children and the animation is of the standard you'd expect so it seems 
churlish to grump about it as an adult.  Still, the characters aren't that 
engaging and the story could have done with more action. The only sequence 
which really contains a sense of movement is the one in which a pig is 
chased by a pair of gwythaints (dragonlike creatures), but this appears 
early in the film and even then it's too short.  It's also obvious that the 
writers couldn't really avoid including characters that, while central to 
the original stories, become superfluous in the film.  In the end, only the 
hero Taran, his pig Hen Wen, and a creature known as Gurgi (who is included 
for comic relief and sounds like Donald Duck calling long distance) are 
essential for the quest to find and destroy the evil cauldron of the title.
Given the nature of the story (which features lots of skulls, skeletons and 
demonic imagery), the film-makers may have wanted to keep the film from 
appearing too scary for their younger viewers - in my mind it looks like an 
edited version of a putative longer film.  THE BLACK CAULDRON hitches up its 
pants, says good-bye to Mom at the door, but then decides to go no further 
than the front yard.  Like Taran, the pig-keeper who wants to become a 
warrior,  THE BLACK CAULDRON is a film that wants to show us that it's 
growing up (it's one of the very rare Disney animations in which no animals 
talk and no characters sing) but it can't shake loose the Disney trappings 
it is garbed in.  Even though it is one of the least remembered efforts of 
the studio (unless it made an impression upon you as a youngster), it's 
still worth noting as a possible turning point.  Imagine, in a parallel 
universe, that this film was greeted with acclaim and success.  Imagine what 
new, daring projects this may have encouraged the studio to develop.  It 
didn't happen, but THE BLACK CAULDRON did help promote Alexander's 
well-crafted fantasy novels, so its investment wasn't altogether 
unprofitable.

Title
Review for Flim-Flam Man, The (1967)
Lighthearted film by Irvin Kershner should appeal to all ages. 
Traveling con man Mordecai Jones is tossed off a train passing through
North Carolina and is befriended by a young army deserter.  The older,
experienced Jones gets his newly-appointed partner to shill for him
while dodging the local county sheriff and several less-than-satisfied
`customers'.  George C. Scott puts a bit of W. C. Fields in his
portrayal of Jones, while Michael Sarrazin (his film debut) is
relegated to the role of sidekick (Kershner jokingly tilts the camera
during the scene where Jones introduces himself, just so we know he's
crooked).  Characters come across as being stock rather than
believable.  Pretty Sue Lyon, in one of only a handful of starring
roles she featured in after LOLITA, doesn't have a lot to do opposite
Sarrazin - sparks don't exactly fly between the two.  More interesting
could have been the relationship between Scott's Jones and Harry
Morgan's Sheriff Slade (it certainly would have been more fun) but
this isn't developed either.
Film still manages to be entertaining.  There are various chases and
escapes on trains, trucks, cars, and a paddleboat.  In keeping with
their shifty con tricks, the characters keep on the move.  It's also
fun watching them exploiting the greed of others, and seeing each step
of their tricks slide into place.  The scams themselves, however,
aren't that elaborate - they follow a similar formula throughout, 
involving either sleight of hand or misplaced trust.  You'll find trickier, more
absorbing ploys in THE STING and HOUSE OF GAMES.  But what the
characters of those two films lack is the philosophy Jones uses to
justify his self-professed trade.  He's not obsessed with getting rich
(he's still hopping freights), and sees himself performing a public
service: his victims will become better people after seeing the
consequences of their avarice, and those who are truly honest will not
yield to temptation in the first place.  Invariably, all his hustles
involve the desire of other people to make money.  It's Sarrazin who
pulls the film's final scam, though unfortunately it doesn't amount to
much more than a bluff.  But the whole movie is so easygoing that it's
unfair to nitpick.  Also featuring:  Jack Albertson, Slim Pickens,
Alice Ghostley.  Jerry Goldsmith wrote the music.  For history buffs: 
The alias that Jones uses in one instance - Titus Oates - refers to a 
17th century 'con man' who duped the English into believing there was 
a plot to assassinate their reigning monarch.  

Title
Review for Mad Dog Time (1996)
Trigger Happy (1996) 93m.  Originally released as MAD DOG TIME
Love it or loathe it, writer-producer-director Larry Bishop's debut
outing is destined for cult heaven.  In summary, story sounds like a
run-of-the-mill mob flick:  Gangland boss Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is
returning to his nightclub after being released from incarceration. 
Other would-be mob bosses (Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Gregory
Hines, to name a few) wonder how to use this situation to their best
advantage.  They don't wonder too hard - everyone's solution to
problems in this scenario is simply to shoot everyone else dead, which
is exactly what transpires, in one measured showdown after another,
until the film's conclusion.  
The lack of compunction or consequence resulting from this gunplay
pushes TRIGGER HAPPY well beyond the fringe of reality, but that's
understandable:  Vic is being released not from a prison, but an
asylum - this story may be taking place entirely within his head. 
That's one plausible reason, at least, for the over-tanned
blemish-free makeup smothering all the characters (Dreyfuss himself is
positively pancaked with the stuff) - the inhabitants of Vic's world
are as neat and tidy as the precise, bloodless killings within it. 
Then there's the opening narration about the entrance of a new
universe, the references to the Big Bang theory and Vic's
conversations with God, and the extreme closeup of Vic's eye in the
final frames.  Vic, as demented creator of an equally demented world,
is ubiquitous throughout the story: other characters talk about him
constantly whenever he is absent from a scene.  In fact, Dreyfuss
doesn't put in an appearance until considerable buildup has elapsed. 
It's an interesting effect, because despite our warnings that Vic is
totally insane, Dreyfuss never actually does anything crazy (no
crazier than his contemporaries, anyway).  He needs do nothing more
than stare benignly and let our imaginations wonder how psychotic he
really is. There's almost one moment of revelation during Gabriel
Byrne's awful rendition of Vic's signature tune My Way' (What else,
for a Creator?), surely the most memorable cinematic representation of
that standard since Sid Vicious mangled it in SID AND NANCY.  It's an
interesting moment because we can't be sure if Byrne is snarling
remarks like `You're a paranoid schizophrenic' between the lyrics or
whether we are finally seeing/hearing evidence of Vic's delusional
psychosis.
The contribution of Byrne, who speaks in an unfathomable accent, is
the most comic of the film.  He makes a great foil for Vic's hired gun
Jeff Goldblum (my favorite performance among his credits so far),
whose wry, schoolboyish looks suggest he is concealing some sly prank.
 He, Dreyfuss, and Byrne form the crown of a cast list that is
irresistible, including the likes of Ellen Barkin, Diane Lane, Billy
Idol, Rob Reiner, and Paul Anka.  Rat Packers Sinatra, Martin, and
Davis dominate the soundtrack.  The original title, MAD DOG TIME was
meant to be an anagram of MAD GOD TIME, highlighting Bishop's
intention that his film be seen as an allegory.  

Title
Review for Lost in Space (1998)
If any recent trend can bear witness to the all-too-often voiced
complaint that Hollywood has run out of ideas, then it is the
recycling of 1960s television shows into big-budget, star-powered
cinema updates. It's jump-on-the-bandwagon thinking, of that there is
no doubt, but unlike other recent trends - the 'based on video game'
film, the 'return to the 70s disaster flicks', the 'make a movie from
anything by Jane Austen' mini-booms - this bandwagon looks set to roll
on for some time yet.  Why is this happening, and why now?  It 
could be said that this flood of old television to the 
box-office is less a process of revivifying our cultural past 
than colonizing it - the simple fact that we are in a position to 
look back gives us the right for enlightened comment and critique.  
Or it could be some kind of fin-de-siecle anxiety, harrying us to 
polish and repackage these old shows before they are looked back on 
as some potentially embarrassing remnant of the 20th century (Oh 
yeah, we knew that show was stupid, but look, we made this out of it 
to prove that we knew).  It's really more simple than either of these 
ideas:  these TV makeovers are Hollywood's way of saying Yes, we know 
we've run out of ideas, we're just not trying to hide it any more, 
and you'd better get used to it because the Baby Boomers are running 
this asylum now, and we grew up with these old shows, so you're going 
to take this reheated hash and scarf it up just the same way you've 
always done, without any need for us to apologise for it.  Because, 
folks, postmodernism means never having to say you're sorry.    
This kind of honesty is almost beyond criticism.  It's Hollywood
waving its flag and saying, Look Ma, no ideas!   So, for the most
part, we've shut up and treated these films as the harmless
reminiscences they inevitably turn out to be.  Their treatment is
wholly predictable: part revision, part homage, all marketing.  But a
few exceptions have slipped through the net: Betty Thomas' necessarily
cruel (but affectionate - you can be as iconoclastic as you like with
this nostalgia as long as you stay affectionate) repositioning of THE
BRADY BUNCH; and Brian De Palma's take on MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, which
saw the Impossible Missions Force blown away in the first scene (a
move which several people were not pleased with, because with that one
cavalier stroke, De Palma demonstrated that he was sadly lacking in
that all-important affection for the original).
Which brings us to LOST IN SPACE, and another problem concerning TV
remakes, for it is impossible to separate the cinema experience from
the historical product that has imprinted its own identity so firmly
in our culture.  LOST IN SPACE was originally intended to be serious
science-fiction but descended into camp once Jonathan Harris (Dr
Smith, a murderous saboteur who was meant to be written out after half
a dozen episodes) started getting the most of the show's fan mail. 
Soon LOST IN SPACE became nothing more than 'The Dr Smith, Will
Robinson, and Robot Show', and as the budget became skimpier (which
explains why they would spend a whole season on the same planet, then
take off and land on another planet with the same rocks arranged
differently) and the not-very-special effects even cheaper, the
once-serious concept took on a wayward surrealism unprecedented in
prime-time TV.  In fact, for many young viewers the show's absurdity
made it frightening.  LOST IN SPACE went beyond all logic and thus
into the territory of nightmare.  One particularly terrifying episode
(for me, anyway) found Will and Doctor Smith in a fog-shrouded
minimalist street set of Chinatown talking about buying hot dogs while
oversized spiders lay lurking in the dark.  With a memory of the show
as vivid as that, how could any belated cinema remake stand alone?
Nevertheless, the 1998 LOST IN SPACE manages to pull off this
balancing act, and it does it by returning to the show's roots.  It
may be affectionate, spirited, even respectful in an odd sort of way,
but most importantly it manages to do what its television predecessor
could not - have the muscle to back up its intentions.  Its most
apparent strength is the special effects, not only in quality but also
sheer volume - this is one of the most FX-saturated movies you're
likely to have seen in some time.  It's strange that the 'biological'
effects - i.e. monsters and critters in general - don't hold up as
well as the rest, but in a strange way it is reflective of the
monsters in the original show, which were just plain lousy (Look! 
There's a woman with her face painted green!  Look!  There's a guy
wearing a sparkly bowler hat and a stocking over his head!)  The
second strength the 1998 version has is Akiva Goldsman's script, which
manages to employ several motifs and undercurrents of the show without
making them obvious in-jokes or necessary prerequisites with which to
'appreciate' the update.  There are spins on the businesslike
space-pioneer 'give-me-a-hand-with-the-force-field-Don' relationship
(or nonrelationship) between John Robinson and Don West; the
friendship/bonding between Will and the Robot; and most dramatically,
the unspoken (but apparent to those of us who were regular viewers of
the series) surrogate father relationship Will had with Dr Smith -
which in this version is pursued to a horrible conclusion the 
original producers could never have foreseen.
Fine so far, but will the fans like it?  Fandom is a difficult
demographic.  The elements of the series held in most affection will
be the same ones which most pointedly fail to deliver for several
viewers on several levels, but the most common point of focus will be
the replacement of new actors for old.  Who, for example, could
possibly replace Jonathan Harris as Doctor Smith?  I wouldn't have
thought it would have been Gary Oldman, but he does a creditable job. 
Jack Johnson similarly slips comfortably into the role of Will.  I 
suspect it may be Lacey Chabert's portrayal of Penny that will rankle 
many fans (pure prejudice on my part, since I had an enormous crush 
on Angela Cartwright as a kid), whose character does admittedly 
become more engaging and less whiny as the film goes on, but what 
does she keep complaining about? At least the Robinsons have to 
be a step up from the PARTY OF FIVE family she's been stuck with for 
the last five years.  Perversely, it is the only non-human character 
of the series that is the most significantly irreplaceable.  Hearing 
the voice of Dick Tufeld, the only actor from the original to reprise 
his role (the Robot) in the film, provides viewers with the most 
immediate nostalgic experience that LOST IN SPACE has to offer - 
that, and I suppose the revamped title theme played over the end 
credits (not the show's more memorable original theme, however - 
remember, it had two!) The only major departure from prewritten 
characterization would be Don, as played by Matt LeBlanc - really, 
it's just another version of his character Joey from FRIENDS - but 
it's a perversely satisfying change: at last we get to see Don 
hitting on John and Maureen Robinson's cute older daughter Judy.  And 
about time.
I'm wary of making a comment as general as 'Fans of the TV show will
love LOST IN SPACE',  because being the first kid on the block to see
it I haven't yet had a chance to compare reactions.  But I can say
personally that as a fan of the show I was enormously satisfied with
what the film-makers had done. LOST IN SPACE works.  It is able to
exist on its own terms as an imaginative and active space adventure,
while still catering to fans of the original.  I'd go as far as saying
that it is the most enjoyable adaptation of a TV show I have yet seen.
 But once again, this is prejudice on my part - I can't think of many
other shows (well, GET SMART was one) which spawned as many
catch-phrases in the school playground.  Most of them came from Smith,
whether it was "The pain, the paaaiin" (usually when filing out for a
PE lesson) or anything ending with "Dear boy" (I'm sure also that 
many teachers must have gotten sick of kids responding "Never fear, 
Smith is here" whenever they were appointed with some minor classroom 
task). However, as much as I enjoyed Smith I have to say it was Don 
who made me laugh the most when I revisited the show a decade or so 
ago. Humorless Don, who for all appearances seemed to be a walking
clockspring of repressed rage, and who could never speak to Smith
without snarling ("You're a 24-carat goldbrick!"), was where we could
see the reality outside the show intrude into its own peculiar
universe; for this was Don-the-actor voicing on behalf of the rest of
the Robinson Family with every snarl his extreme vexation about being
relegated to the periphery while a camp old ham merrily stole the show
right from under them.  It makes you think about why Jonathan Harris 
was one of the few original cast members not to get a walk-on this 
time around.
The series LOST IN SPACE has become something of an institution now. 
Some may ask why any studio would bother to make an enormously
expensive movie of a flimsy low-budget show thirty years later.  Fans
will reply that it has been a remake that has been too long in coming.
 The facts, according to the original show, stated that the Robinsons
blasted off into space on October 16, 1997.  It's a shame the film's
producers couldn't have arranged for their debut to coincide with date
and bring the whole LOST IN SPACE phenomenon full circle.  As it
stands, this new telling of that story has wisely reset the launch
date to September 30, 2058.  I guess we can look forward to
Hollywood's next onslaught of television remakes - remakes of remakes,
in fact - around about that time.

Review for Visions of Light (1992)
Superlative collection of movie scenes and interviews with
cinematographers was directed by Arnold Glassman, Todd McCarthy, and
Stuart Samuels, and won the 1993 Oscar for Best Documentary.  While it
may seem a little nepotistic of the film industry to give an award to
a documentary about the film industry, it is in this case well
deserved.  The stars of the show are the directors of photography who
have  contributed to movies over the last hundred years.  VISIONS OF
LIGHT reads like a Who's Who of cinematographers:  Nestor Almendros,
Vilmos Zsigmond, James Wong Howe, Gordon Willis are among the cast 
list enthusing and reminiscing about the images they and others 
have created.
Documentary traces the evolution of cinema chronologically, but what
makes it unique is seeing developments such as the advent of sound and
color exclusively through the eyes of the cinematographers (although I
find it odd that the invention of new lenses is never acknowledged at
any time).  The DPs come across as a closely-knit club - it's fun
hearing them talk about their work and admiration for their
contemporaries, friends, and heroes.  As one captivating film sequence
follows another you'll feel you are at their sides, flipping through a
family album of cinematic treasures. How could anyone not want to rush
out and see all of these films on a big screen afterwards? 
Films of every genre and era are ably represented, and what's
admirable is that there are few of the usual 'classic' scenes that
always appear in films of this type (one exception is the crane shot
of the wounded in GONE WITH THE WIND).  VISIONS OF LIGHT wisely
emphasizes the feeling of discovery - unexpected or forgotten moments
of film are unearthed and rediscovered from start to finish.  You
won't be anticipating segments from ROSEMARY'S BABY or IN COLD BLOOD. 
Other works like SUNRISE and McCABE AND MRS MILLER are impossible to
ignore.  Film packs a lot in for its 90 minutes.  You may have some
fun with friends later discussing what was left out (personally, I'd
like to know why BARRY LYNDON's breakthrough
photography-by-candlepower wasn't included).  A must for anyone
seriously interested in cinema.

Title
Review for A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)
A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001) 145m 
In much the same way that Spielberg included the adjunct 'EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL' 
to his film E.T., the self-explanatory 'ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE' has been 
tagged on to what was previously known simply as A.I.  One can't imagine the 
late Stanley Kubrick, who nursed the project for many years, making such 
concessions, suggestive as they are of a dumbing-down of the original 
concept, but for all intents Spielberg has brought his version of it to the 
screen with integrity.  While he and Kubrick are considered superb 
technicians and masters of film-making, their art is approached from 
viewpoints that couldn't seem more opposite.  Spielberg is an emotive 
choreographer; Kubrick a philosophical visionary.  Kubrick spent years 
developing his story for A.I. (so many that he died before getting a final 
script); Spielberg had finished principal photography barely a year after 
announcing his intentions to make the film.  Whether or not A.I. is a 
success or failure is almost secondary to the fact that it creates an 
irresistible intersection point between these two major talents. 
The 'Spielbrick' film, then, sees its genesis in a very short Brian Aldiss 
story, 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'.  In truth this story by itself 
makes more sense as a Spielberg project than it does a Kubrick one, a fact 
that Kubrick himself acknowledged when he handed the material over to 
Spielberg for completion.  Significantly, it became the first feature 
screenplay written by Spielberg for nearly twenty years.  A.I. concerns 
itself with cybernetic technology so advanced that it can formulate concepts 
about itself beyond the boundaries of its program.  Hence David, the 'boy' 
who is the central character of the film, believes he is capable of love and 
seeks it in return.  He simulates all emotional sensations to the extent 
that they resonate in his programming just the way they might influence 
themselves physically in a living human body.  What's intriguing about A.I. 
is that the subject matter itself almost requires the collaboration of these 
two very different film-makers - one could not have made it without the 
other.  David is both Spielberg and Kubrick, a work of technological 
craftsmanship searching for a soul, an answer, and a resolution. 
And here's the problem: A.I is multilayered, beautiful, unique and haunting, 
but early on it sets itself up for a resolution that it cannot possibly 
deliver.  David, drawing inspiration from the story of Pinocchio, wants to 
be a real boy.  This film may have fantastic elements, but it is not a 
fantasy, and no blue fairy is going to be waving a wand at its conclusion, 
which leaves only two outs: either David's mission will fail utterly or it 
will arrive at a compromise (which is another way of saying 'cop-out').  It 
appears that any likely ending is going to leave us wanting, but for a 
while, it looks like Spielberg has a chance of pulling it off.  On my first 
viewing of A.I. I had no idea of the film's length and thought that the film 
had reached its conclusion around the two hour mark, in a striking scene 
that found David confronting the object of his quest personified.  It was a 
moment I found profoundly moving, and the fact that it had drawn such a 
powerful emotional response from me was enough to prove itself entirely 
satisfying as the film's ending.  But as anyone who has seen the film knows, 
there is more to come beyond this scene, and A.I. still has a whole separate 
act to follow. 
As it happens, I find the 'actual' finale less satisfying if only for the 
reason that I'm not sure how I am  supposed to react to it emotionally.  
These narrative leaps of faith are more Kubrick's technique for storytelling 
than Spielberg's, and the film makes a habit of dramatically altering its 
tone and setting.  The first act is mesmerizing and intimate, and holds us 
in thrall with its world of possibilities; the second becomes visceral and 
nightmarish; the third a voyage of isolation, despair and hope.  It's an 
approach that will irritate many viewers, and at odds with the mass audience 
that Spielberg is accustomed to catering for.  If you're drawn into the 
story, then you won't care too much about its changing backgrounds.  The 
point is that the foreground remains the same throughout.  Haley Joel Osment 
is a wonder as David, pulling off the formidable task of making us believe 
he is an artificial life form, or 'mecha', from the moment he first appears. 
  His companionship with a pleasure mecha called Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and a 
'supertoy' teddy bear provides cinema with a trio like none other you have 
seen (some of these images seem destined as instant classics).  The rest of 
A.I. follows suit - its distinctive art direction, continuously provocative 
questions (it doesn't try to presume answers), and John Williams score 
(which follows in the footsteps of Phillip Glass) combine to create a film 
like nothing that Spielberg, or anyone else for that matter, has done 
before. 
But technical aspects aside, the major achievement of A.I. must be that it 
is able to funnel our emotional investment into a character that is a 
machine, and moreover, to do it without seeming manipulative.  We are never 
allowed to forget that David is not a real boy, but this does not stop him 
from gaining our empathy.  Even though we should know better, we don't 
discriminate between a human being with real feelings, or a simulacra that 
is programmed to believe it has real feelings (in much the same way that a 
crowd at a robotic demolition derby are instantly convinced that David is 
real when he shows fear).  Why do we accept David so easily?  Because years 
of going to the movies have taught us so; for what is any person we see on 
screen but a scripted character played by a hired actor?  Arguably, the 
success of any film is not dependent on our abilities to separate ourselves 
from its actors or acting, but our connection with the emotional content 
they are working in.  Kubrick had already proved this with non-human 
characters in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, during the justifiably famous scene in 
which the computer HAL is dismantled and 'dies' before our eyes.  A.I. 
relies on that part of us, as human beings, which projects itself on to 
inanimate objects, and in turn is projected back to us via the cinema 
screen.  Is it possible to identify the moment where our animatism turns to 
animism?  It's one many conundrums offered in the story, and even David 
himself is unable to tell, as is heartbreakingly proved by his belief that a 
simple statue has the power to grant him a wish.  He may be the most 
sophisticated creation of his time, yet he is still programmed with the 
reasoning of a child. 
In the end, A.I. is the kind of project that the term 'flawed masterpiece' 
is reserved for.  It reminds me of 'Tintin and Alph-Art', the final book of 
Herge's Tintin series that was unofficially completed in different 
capacities by other artists working from his notes and sketches.  It's 
there, and it's not there.  It almost feels like something that was never 
meant to be there, or something that you'd dreamed about but never expected 
to see in the waking world.  Even though Spielberg's heart is beating 
throughout A.I.  you still feel the ghost of Kubrick watching from hidden 
vantage points.  It may be disappointing, or it may be the stuff of genius.  
But the reasons I'd give for anyone interested in watching A.I. are the same 
I'd give for reading 'Alph-Art'.  The fact is, it was made, and we have the 
opportunity to see it at last, for better or worse: whether you think you're 
going to enjoy it or not, how could you bear never to know? 

Title
Review for Man in the Moon, The (1991)
A simple story well told.  When stripped down, it all appears so basic that 
you begin to wonder why veteran directors Robert Mulligan and Mark Rydell 
took it upon themselves to make it (Rydell produced).  I would guess that 
Mulligan knew well enough to trust his film to the right actors, if he could 
find them - and he did.  THE MAN IN THE MOON will probably be best known now 
for the debut of Reese Witherspoon, who impresses in her role as Dani, a 
14-year old girl living with her family in rural Louisiana during the 50s.  
A long-absent family friend moves in nearby, allowing 17-year old Court 
(Jason London, also making his debut ) to enter Dani's life.  But it isn't 
just Dani: her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield ) has noticed him too.
It works in the film's favor to have the story of a young girl's first crush 
presented in a basic manner.  The story opens, progresses and closes, and 
even though significant events have unfolded it's hard to tell if the girls' 
lives will be changed that dramatically.  This is what I like most about THE 
MAN IN THE MOON - it's like a chapter from a book, self-contained in its own 
simplicity.  There are no complications, subplots, or clutter to distract 
us.  It begins and ends with the girls on a front porch in the light of the 
full moon, suggesting that the story has completed its 'cycle' (everything 
takes place within a month).  It also allows its characters leisure to 
breathe, walk, and talk so naturally that we don't focus on the acting.  
Witherspoon at first appears to be a teenybopper, then perhaps a 'wild 
child', but is perfectly at ease dressed either tomboyishly or in skirts.  
Sam Waterston, as the father of the girls, initially appears to be a 
traditionally strict father of the 50s, but reveals more elements to his 
character as the film progresses.  Look at the nuances that slip through so 
effortlessly - for example, the priceless, dismissive look on Witherspoon's 
face when she first meets London outside her home.  These are 
blink-and-you'll-miss-them moments, too ephemeral to be written into 
screenplays or catalogued in critiques.  True, there are a few unsteady 
turns - the opening dialogue that explains the film's title (which really 
has very little to do with what follows), and some scenes that verge on 
melodrama - but they do not detract from the overall charm of the piece.
There's also another level that the film works on, and one which I believe 
is true of many features of the last decade that have showcased the talents 
of young, up-and-coming performers.  As is the case with so many of her 
contemporaries, Witherspoon has graduated from the simple pleasures of her 
debut and moved on to harder, darker, and decidedly more adult material.  
It's a common occurrence: young stars don't want to be trapped in 
PG-features when they can stretch themselves as 'serious' actors.  So while 
the nostalgia of THE MAN IN THE MOON isn't troweled on too thickly, the 
sight of a smart, ponytailed, wide-eyed Witherspoon automatically ensures 
that it will make itself an irretrievable memento.  Given the film's subject 
matter of first love, lost love, and coming-of-age, this all conspires to 
make perfect sense.


Title
Review for Salň o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (1975)
Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom (1975) 115m.
I've yet to read more than two pages of the infamous Marquis de Sade volume 
on which this film was based, but that's still enough to establish the 
cataloguing of carnality and scatology that appears to be the books raison 
d'etre.  After working his way ever more deeply into controversial subject 
matter such as sex, religion, and politics, director Pier Paolo Pasolini 
finally decided to go the whole hog and make a film from a text which 
single-handedly defined the term 'unfilmable'.  He would be bludgeoned to 
death near a soccer field shortly after filming was completed, making this 
his final opus - but after SALO he would have been hard pressed to come up 
with material for an encore.
SALO starts with gorgeous, summery photography of rural Italy but quickly 
moves indoors and stays there for the duration of the story.  This is Italy 
under fascism in the 1940s, and the mansion that is the central set of the 
film plays host to a number of appalling aberrations beneath its sunny 
skies.  In Pasolini's restructuring of the original text, a group of 
wealthy, corrupt fascists have rounded up young Italians and imprisoned them 
within a large country estate in order to play out the De Sade book as if it 
were a type of instruction manual (Pasolini actually kept his cast inside 
the mansion for nearly two months of shooting).  Whether or not they hope to 
learn something more about their own baser nature isn't even a subject for 
consideration as they humiliate and torture their hapless prisoners 
relentlessly.  SALO is, by its subject, a confrontational film, and was 
banned outright in different countries.  I think the charges brought against 
it are less a result of what is shown on screen than the sense that it 
appears so studiously committed to its own moral vacuum.  You'll see more 
graphic sex and violence in other films but these are usually punctuations 
within a wider context - in SALO these elements are present constantly.  Not 
for one moment are we offered any relief from the emotional and 
psychological torment being inflicted upon the fascist's victims, and just 
when we think the film is all bark and no bite, it offers a final scene that 
is horrific not only for what it portrays but because it can be the only 
logical conclusion.
I believe that SALO is not as controversial for its content as it is for the 
conditions it imposes upon the viewer from the outset: that there is no 
hope, that there will be no rescue, that these young people will suffer and 
that we will be witness to every moment of it.  Because we accept these 
conditions and view on regardless we get the feeling that we are conspiring 
with an agenda of the film-maker's.  Is it a film that exists more in the 
reaction to its content than the content itself?  Is the event of the film 
emulating the anarchic argument behind De Sade's own scandalous writings?  
What's problematic with SALO is that by means of blasphemy, cruelty or 
depravity it positions itself as a dialogue with which the audience cannot 
help but engage, overwhelming conventional attitudes of storyline or 
character.  I also can't help feeling that Pasolini's decision to update the 
text to a wartime setting is pure strategy on his part, as if allegory 
conveniently excuses his indulgence.  It's not a film that should be banned 
(there were lines around the block when I went to see it), or that people 
should be discouraged from seeing, or that most people should be encouraged 
to see, for that matter.  Ultimately, despite its controversy, I'm left with 
a muddled reaction to SALO.  It's certainly disturbing, but probably for the 
wrong reasons.  Just as De Sade's book tells you more about the man who 
wrote it than the work itself, so too do I think less of SALO as a film than 
the end-product of the man who made it.

Title
Review for Spice World (1997)
SPICE WORLD is like a jigsaw puzzle in reverse: you start with the completed 
picture and then dismantle it piece by piece, revealing how the whole thing 
was locked together to begin with.  It's an obvious metaphor for film 
criticism, but with a textbook example such as this, there is very little 
beyond the obvious.  The same processes for its criticism are responsible 
for its creation ; you can almost hear the production meetings behind every 
scene.
For a brief period near the end of the 90s, the five-girl pop group Spice 
Girls saw a meteoric rise to fame and fortune  would that shooting star 
have turned out to have been more akin to Halley's instead of the 
Shoemaker-Levy they might have lasted longer before plunging back down into 
the atmosphere just as suddenly  garnering legions of young fans and 
saturating the mass media with their visages and, occasionally, music.  As 
with any other product, the group was marketed with a slogan, Girl Power' 
and the Girls themselves were similarly packaged with the epithets Sporty, 
Angry, Ginger, Baby and Posh.  It's the same strategy that worked with the 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (substitute monikers for colors), and is aimed 
at pretty much the same age range, so why not?  It was only a matter of time 
when a Spice Girls movie was going to arrive on the scene, and just as 
inevitable that it would open itself up to criticism from those who were 
fast wearying of the group.  Using the tried and true template of the 
Beatles' A HARD DAYS NIGHT, SPICE WORLD follows the misadventures of the 
five Spices and their harried manager as they prepare for a big show.
Having established a pretty basic formula, the next decision of the 
film-makers was to ward off the expected criticism of the girls' images and 
the likely transience of their fame by getting their own scripted potshots 
in first.  The overall tone of the piece isn't self-deprecating enough to 
pull this off, although ironically the predictions of girls leaving the 
group, falling pregnant and failing to maintain the heights of their chart 
success did come true within a couple of years of the film's release.  
Instead we are left with the rather curious sight of the real' Spice Girls 
playing the characters of the Spice Girls who are trying to break out of 
their media conceptions and into the real' Spice Girls.  In the long term, 
we're left with no more insight in their feature than one of their music 
videos, and those who have never seen the five performers before will be 
hard pressed to see what the fuss was about or even to differentiate them.  
As far as the film is concerned, one is a bit more working class' than the 
others, one rolls her eyes a lot, one sucks a lollipop, one seems sulkily 
detached, and one has ginger hair.  If you need to learn more, tune into the 
wonderful music trivia show POP-UP VIDEO.
SPICE WORLD is so dedicated to distracting attention from itself that it 
fabricates an abundance of subplots and throws in a huge number of cameos  
the old tactic of endorsing a celebrity product by surrounding it with those 
who already have credibility (Jonathon King, Elvis Costello, Jools Holland 
and others).  The camera is almost afraid to linger on any one member of the 
group, so the dialogue becomes a string of one-liners.  Meanwhile, dance 
routines and songs drift in and out of the story, the Girls jump from one 
unrelated scene to the next and for a finale the film starts spoofing its 
own status as a vehicle for the group.  By its very nature SPICE WORLD is 
consumed quickly and then forgotten.  It's not a bad film (has anybody ever 
tried to watch that Pet Shop Boys movie more than once?), it's just that it 
was never possible for it to be particularly good.
As SPICE WORLD is primarily an exercise in promotion it would make criticism 
on cinematic grounds redundant (doubly so when you consider that its target 
audience of youngsters would not be the type to even read reviews) unless 
the purpose of the act was to be seen as providing a record of a cultural 
phenomenon.  Will the 12-year old girls who saw this movie in 1997 be 
reading the reviews out of interest or nostalgia many years later?  It looks 
as though even the Spice Girls read their demographic wrong: as the film's 
credits roll, Mel B stares into the camera lens and says decisively to the 
other members of the group that the audience is about to leave the cinema 
and go to the pub.  Hardly.

Title
Review for Godzilla (1998)
It's getting harder to stay ignorant.  In the mid-80s it was possible
to see films like ET or GREMLINS without knowing what the
effects-generated critters looked like beforehand.  It was a luxury
that imbued these films with a sense of mystery and event.  Godzilla
(the monster, not the movie) has been a different matter.  Toy
catalogues, film reviews, television advertisements, and every other
medium have been spewing out images of the Scaly One with such
prevalence that sneak previews of the lizard itself are almost
unavoidable.  And if it's not pics of Godzilla then it's the gossipy
giveaways of the storyline, or the reviews that get released even
before the movie makes it to the local multiplex.
I generally shut myself off from such spoilers, but this time around
the tone of the local reviews has made itself quite clear: The lizard
is a turkey; GODZILLA bites; the movie is a bomb.  So it was hardly
surprising by the time I got to the cinema that the non-expectations I
usually try to maintain had given way to very low expectations indeed.
 It was after seeing GODZILLA for myself, however, and thinking "This
isn't that badactually it's fun", that I suddenly realized I had been
missing the point all along: GODZILLA had been made specifically for
an audience of middle-aged film critics!  Not the teenagers and
families and SF/Fantasy/FX fans that filled the screening I had
attended.  They're not the target audience.  Obviously: they're not
the ones writing the reviews.  How could I have been so blind?
I'm aware that this is an old argument, and that sarcasm is a shoddy
platform on which to build it, but I don't see that it is any less
true.  Reviewing the reviewers, I discovered that every last grumpy
reptile-hating one of them had been over the age of 45.  I would
propose from this sample that this age henceforth be the point at
which all critics in the public domain are reassessed, in much the
same fashion that drivers licenses are renewed at certain age limits. 
It's clear to me that there are quite a few current reviewers licenses
that need serious re-examination, if not revoking.
It's clear also that the writing-directing-producing team of Roland
Emmerich and Dean Devlin knew the kind of critical reception their
popcorn movie would get, which explains why the film's most
ineffectual character is a non-too-subtle lampoon of critic Roger
Ebert, who had panned Emmerich and Devlin's earlier collaborations
INDEPENDENCE DAY and STARGATE.  I wouldn't think they are singling
Ebert out personally; it's just that he represents a critical
homogeneity they resent.  The collective hostility of this faction
will, I guess, be mainly directed to the contrast of two films,
JURASSIC PARK and the 1956 GODZILLA.  It's true that GODZILLA poaches
a lot of imagery from JURASSIC PARK and then simply amplifies it under
its self-promoted precept 'Size Does Matter', but if you view it in
terms of how Spielberg's film would look under the influence of a
couple of bennies then I don't see how you can miss the trippy,
demented fun of it all. If it's not a rush, it's still a ride.
It's the original GODZILLA, a cult movie with a huge following, that
provides the more challenging comparison.  It was a landmark film of
its type which established a new export market for Japanese films, but
at the risk of offending all Gojira fanatics, I have never understood
the appeal of the Toho-produced Godzilla films.  It was only when the
momentum of the series reached DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, in which every
available rubber suit was brought out of mothballs for one last
free-for-all scrap, that I could appreciate the divine absurdity of it
all.  Also going for the original was the large-scale destruction of
Tokyo (Godzilla's a lot meaner in his first appearance) which, again,
must have been impressive in 1956 - but isn't the destruction just as
impressive in 1998, even taking into account the current
sophistication of CGI?  And even the appeal of seeing cities flattened
was lost in the original series when the studios realized it was a lot
cheaper for Gojira and his cronies to slug it out in open countryside.
 From this point on it simply became men in costumes wrestling each
other, a trend which has still, mystifyingly, remained popular today
with such shows as POWER RANGERS.
But finally, I suppose, it is the allegorical connection that critics
will play as their trump card.  The original GODZILLA meant something:
it was a national psyche which watched itself being destroyed over and
over again, still smarting from the humiliation and disenfranchisement
of losing the war and the traumatisation of genbaku-sho and other
effects of the Holocaust.  How can the 1998 version compete with that?
 It can't, and it doesn't try.  Instead, it's a calculated,
hypermarketed cash cow.  If Godzilla allegorizes anything , then it is
the seemingly unstoppable power of the Hollywood money machine,
trampling merry hell over all those who have grown out of its
demographic.  GODZILLA becomes a battle of beasts; not just Ebert
versus a lizard, but the Godzilla of film critics against the Godzilla
of summer blockbusters.
At the end it appears I have not said one thing, good nor bad, about
GODZILLA itself.  But that's okay.  It may leave you free to see it
for yourself without any expectations.  And if you still have no idea
what the monster looks like, I take my hat off to you.  By this stage
that would be no mean feat.  But I should point out, however, that I
still do not know what happens in the final episode of SEINFELD.  Beat
that if you can.

Review for Romeo and Juliet (1968/I)
A beautiful adaptation of Shakespeare that has a place in many
moviegoers' hearts.  While I love Bernstein's musical version WEST
SIDE STORY, and enoy the flippant, shrieking, MTV-style 1996 update,
there is still no substitute for this Franco Zeffirelli gem. 
Shakespeare's classic love story doesn't fit the modern-dress scenario
as well as his tragedies or history lessons, no matter how timeless or
relevant his themes may be: the notion of romance is too strongly
intertwined with sentiment, innocence and longing - qualities we
associate with an irretrievable past - to make the transition
successfully.  So while the contemporary setting of 1996's ROMEO +
JULIET makes for great cinema, its own flashiness ultimately denies it
emotional resonance: it presents Romeo and Juliet's world as so
superficial, violent, and cheerless that you can't blame them for
wanting to leave it.  Their death scene is no tragedy, merely an exit.
Zeffirelli's renaissance Italy, on the other hand, is a place any of
us could be perfectly happy to spend our lives in.
It's hard to imagine a more definitive version of the play - this film
is how Shakespeare himself would have envisaged it, a world of
sundrenched piazzas, masked balls, rowdy swordsmanship, bustling
marketplaces, moonlight, meadows, and passion.  But most importantly,
teenagers were finally trusted with the roles of the two lovers - I
cringe at those adult `Hollywood' actors strutting across the stage
and going through all the motions in earlier film versions, because
more than anything Romeo and Juliet are two hormonally-charged
*adolescents* who are swept away not only by each other, but by the
mere idea of being in love.  Leonard Whiting is a naive, impulsive
Romeo; Olivia Hussey is the girlfriend of every boy's dreams -
voluptuous, spirited, and stunningly beautiful.  Together they
represent everyone who ever wanted to rebel against the dogmatism of
their parents and improve the way of the world.  This was surely a
message that the Woodstock generation took personally - these two
youthful, optimistic heroes were seen to endorse their views on peace,
freedom, sex, and love.  Subsequently Whiting and Hussey became minor
icons of the late sixties.
Zeffirelli's eye for detail presents us with an entirely believable
milieu - all his characters seem so real and natural it's easy to
forget they're speaking Shakespeare.  Every moment Whiting and Hussey
are together on screen they are completely alive - you'll know what
all-consuming love is, just as you'll sympathise with them every
moment they are apart.  Final scenes are among the cinema's most
heartbreaking - even after three cinema screenings they still make me
choke up.  Nino Rota's well-known and popular score contributes
enormously.  Film won Oscars for cinematography and costumes.  Also
with: Pat Heywood as a robust nurse and Michael York as a cocky,
pugnacious Tybalt - one of the reasons I couldn't take the 1996
version seriously was because Tybalt reminded me of a kind of Ferris
Bueller from Hell. 

Title
Review for They Live (1988)
At last, a movie for those of us who wanted those X-Ray glasses we saw 
advertised in comics when we were kids.  Forgotten by all but John 
Carpenter devotees, this SF-horror flick is worth checking out.  
Ex-wrestler 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper plays a drifter who hooks up with a 
bunch of shanty-town dwellers.  Inadvertently he becomes aware of an 
alien conspiracy which has been in effect on Earth for years.  Produced 
while Carpenter's career seemed to be in a lull, this is nevertheless 
one of his most enjoyable outings; a snappy-paced romp that stays 
offbeat until its closing frames.  What's probably most appealing about 
THEY LIVE is that it confines its global-conspiracy storyline to a 
radius of a few miles and a timespan of a few days.  Carpenter, taking a 
cue from his own favorite SF films of the 50s, realizes that he doesn't 
need to play it big - further proof that his best work is with 
restricted budgets.  Consequently, the most memorable moments are the 
simplest: Piper taking a slow walk down the block, newly aware that it 
is replete with aliens; Piper and work buddy Keith David stubbornly 
duking it out in an alley; Piper being struck by a woman he has taken 
hostage.  
Film is based on a (very) short story by Ray Nelson but also borrows 
from the Devourers in Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar stories, positing aliens 
not as intergalactic warlords or rapacious monsters, but as the ultimate 
force in asset stripping and insider trading.  In this scenario, Earth 
will be destroyed economically.  The twist is that most of the 
population are unknowingly contributing to its downfall.  Carpenter 
throws in references to various forms of mass inculcation: subliminal 
persuasion, Communism (which the human rebels are branded in order to 
turn the public against them), propaganda, evangelism (the rebels 
broadcast from a church, and one of them is a street preacher), and most 
pointedly, consumerism.  With this in mind, the invaders are credited as 
ghouls in the end titles - those who would feed off the dead.  It points 
the direction of the film's satire: that media-induced conformity has 
left us so drained of individuality/vitality that we have let ourselves 
become ripe for the harvesting (Since Carpenter has already worked with 
aliens, vampires, and ghosts, THEY LIVE could be seen as his 'zombie' 
picture). 
As with all Carpenter's films, this one is great to look at - he prefers 
to take his horror out of the shadows and into the hyper-real with 
sharp, clear photography and sparkling color.  Again, Carpenter 
contributes a businesslike, pulsating score (a touch bluesy this time 
around), and tosses in a minor trademark by having the characters 
watching an old horror movie on television.  Film has some shocks and 
violence but is mostly great fun - it's no coincidence that Carpenter 
counts it among his own favorites.


Title
Review for Last Supper, The (1995)
Drawing-room comedy for the 90s.  A group of postgrad students
(Cameron Diaz, Courney B. Vance, Annabeth Gish, and others) meet every
Sunday for dinner to socialize and discuss politics, art, and
philosophy.  After sharing their table with an unexpected guest they
come to the conclusion that talk is cheap, and that the only way to
make the world the better place they dream of is to set themselves up
as judge, jury, and executioners, and rid it of all the people that
would impede their vision.  From that point on, the dinner parties
become trials.  Film will hold your attention - its characters are
literate and varied enough to encompass a range of opinions - but is
really a one-note symphony.  The first dinner party is essentially a
setup for the last: looking back you'll see there is no need for the
several similar scenes other than to chart the development of the
characters' convictions or doubts.  To give us a sense that the story
is going somewhere, screenwriter Dan Rosen trails a subplot through
the film involving a police officer and a missing girl, but the fact
remains that the two dinner conversations that bookend the film
outweigh the others inbetween.  The first of these, with Bill Paxton,
blends wit and tension effectively enough for us to look forward to a
rematch with the postgrad's nominal nemesis Norman Arbuthnot (Ron
Perlman, who plays his TV broadcaster like Rod Serling in narrator
mode).  Paxton and Perlman are great, and certainly more likely to
remain in your memory than the walk-ons by Charles Durning, Mark
Harmon, and Jason Alexander.
Message of film can be summed up with tried and true 'what goes around
comes around' and when the students start turning into the persecutors
that they hate, the only real surprise is why none of them were ever
bright enough to see it happening (although Diaz is the first to voice
her disapproval).  They're also too caught up in what they're doing to
see that the people they are setting up as targets are becoming
successively less extreme and increasingly marginal as candidates for
their agenda.  It was an interesting choice to make the group's only
black character the most fascistic of the group.  Best moment of film
is also its most subtle, when at the height of their fanaticism the
characters are suddenly reminded of the real, normal world existing
outside their house by something as simple as a hold signal on a
telephone.  Problem: if we are to assume that one of the students is
responsible for the paintings we see in the credits, how does that
explain the last picture?

Title
Review for Paperhouse (1988)
     Catherine Storr's cult children's novel  MARIANNE DREAMS had
already been made into a British television serial, ESCAPE INTO NIGHT,
fifteen years before this film version appeared.  While the television
adaptation followed the plot and ideas of the story faithfully, Matthew
Jacobs' new screenplay takes liberties which fans of the novel may not
enjoy.  The premise is basically the same:  A young girl (named Anne in
the film) falls sick and is confined to bed for several weeks.  She
begins to have dreams about drawings she has made in a sketchbook and,
upon discovering that a boy (Elliot Spiers) in her dreams actually
exists in the outside world, becomes convinced that the control over
her dreams is linked with the direction of real events.
     Rather than the naive child of the novel, Anne's character is a
rebellious sub-teen whose fantasy dreamworld has now been redefined as
Freudian subconscious.  It's a difficult role for audiences to
sympathize with, but Charlotte Burke plays the part convincingly.  In
fact it is less her growing relationship with Marc (the boy) than her
ambivalent feelings toward her absent father that determines the
direction of the story.  These feelings cause her to (unconsciously?)
recreate him as the agent of her sexual awakening - he becomes
literally the man of her dreams.  The climax of the story, in which her
father drags her from the paperhouse employs imagery of a vaginal
(fiery fissures opening in the ground around them) and phallic (the
lighthouse waiting for her in the distance) nature, but is more
`climax' than conclusion.  The film seems to end three or four times
before Anne finally stands before the lighthouse - in the real world,
this time - at the edge of a cliff (she is at the brink of womanhood)
with her arms open, inviting what may come.  This subtext makes for an
interesting examination of the emotional confusion associated with the
onset of puberty, but in doing so loses the children's audience that
might have otherwise been attracted to the story.  Neither, however,
does the film seem intended specifically for adults.  The real appeal,
as in the book, comes from watching Anne's drawings materialize
three-dimensionally in her dreams, and Bernard Rose handles the
transitory sequences well, imbuing the dream (later nightmare)
sequences with their own plausible reality.

Title
Review for Bis ans Ende der Welt (1991)
     Wim Wenders must have considered this his dream film (literally,
as the story turns out).  His earler road movies (ALICE IN THE CITIES;
KINGS OF THE ROAD; PARIS, TEXAS) and preoccupation with transient,
questing characters finally comes to a head with UNTIL THE END OF THE
WORLD, a road movie that travels all over the planet, no less.
     The year is 1999, "the year the Indian satellite went out of
control", so we are told, and Claire (Solveig Dommartin), a freewilled
young woman, is given the opportunity of a lifetime when she lucks into
a cache of stolen money.  At almost the same time she meets an
enigmatic stranger (William Hurt) who steals a small amount of her
find, and so begins their global game of hide-and-seek, as Claire uses
the rest of her money to chase him from continent to continent.  This
chase, which drags in others (not the least of whom is Sam Neill,
Claire's former lover), seems to be the thrust of the film until about
halfway through when it abruptly stops in Australia (the end of the
world?), changes gear, and introduces a secondary cast and a new
story.  Suddenly Dommartin, Hurt, Neill, and others are involved with
Max Von Sydow's (Hurt's father) experiments to digitally reconstruct
images from the neo-cortex.
     Opinions will be divided among many over which half of the film is
better--or at least more enjoyable--but for some UNTIL THE END OF THE
WORLD will be just too much: too long, too big and too slow.  At the
outset, the material looks tailor-made for a whimsical fantasy (who
wouldn't like to chase someone clear across the globe?) but Wenders has
a curiously practical approach.  It's hard also to get a handle on
Dommartin's character.  Her motivation for hunting down Hurt is
unclear--is it obsession?  Romance?  The thrill of the chase?  Or does
she look upon her actions as the last expression of freedom and
spontaneity (her character is established as capricious right from the
start) beneath the decaying orbit of the satellite that hangs above her
head like a Damocletian sword?  Whatever the reason, she and Hurt do
not make a terribly convincing couple--but then again, perhaps they are
never meant to be.  Like the others in the cast, Hurt and Dommartin are
almost swamped by the scale of events Wenders places them in.  State of
the art technology (as it would be in 1999) is in every scene, and an
impressive soundtrack of original songs, specially commissioned by
Wenders, plays constantly throughout the first half of the film.
     It almost seems like Wenders' grand game, but we can enjoy
watching him shuffle the pieces because he never loses sight of the
humanity of the characters--witness the poignant scene in which Hurt
interviews his sister and her daughter.  And a final shot, capturing
the meditative wonder in Claire's face, is truly special, causing one
to reappraise the title of the film.  It's not a film to get serious
about and find fault with--you'd rather just let Wenders indulge
himself and take you along for the ride.  Naturally, with scale as
large as this, UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD is best enjoyed on a big
screen--the video version suffers badly, not only in picture but also
in content, with half an hour pruned out of it.  See it in a cinema
with a good sound system, if you can.

Title
Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
The fourth (or is it first?) STAR WARS movie is finally with us (I resist 
the urge to make any pun along the line of 'May the fourth be with you' as 
it's probably already been - oops; too late). So confident am I regarding 
the critical reaction to this film that this review has been written prior 
to any actual viewing of same. Critics around the world have made up their 
minds about it already, so why shouldn't I jump on the bandwagon too?
I should point out firstly that I am not a STAR WARS fan - never have been, 
although I've seen each episode on the big screen three times - so I'm not 
out to grind any axes. I just see the whole business as an interesting 
chapter in pop culture. It's taken the act of film reviewing out of the 
cinema and turned it into something else - a reaction not to a film but to a 
cultural and economic phenomenon. It's where Art and Commerce mix, in a 
galaxy not too far, far away from your local KFC or Toyworld. This of 
course, is anathema to Serious Filmgoers. Who said that these films were 
supposed to make money, especially lots of money? God forbid, that might 
actually empower producers and directors to make more movies in the series.
I haven't read any reviews for THE PHANTOM MENACE yet, but you can tell I've 
already guessed their tone. Nor have I seen any any Making Ofs, interviews, 
picturebooks, or trailers. If you're not going to listen to the anti-hype 
you don't listen to the hype either. But the little that I have heard 
telegraphs the direction many critics' arguments are sure to have taken. 
THE PHANTOM MENACE is devoid of humanity, quoth they. Its digital world - 
the computer generated sets, locations, and characters - will have them 
lamenting the film's lack of humanity (I guess there's nothing more 
upsetting than a bunch of aliens and robots with no humanity). They will 
also complain about how the latest episode is merely more of the same - 
bigger battles, the same story elements, the same STAR WARS icons, and 
another wall-to-wall John Williams score (although the Bond films have been 
following the same formula for decades and I don't remember anybody ever 
getting worked up about them at any time). They will object on principle: 
that actors should not be replaced by CGI fabrications because human actors 
deserve center stage on our screens, dammit (in that case, goodbye E.T, 
goodbye Pinocchio, Dumbo, the Muppets, HAL 9000, King Kong, everything by 
Ray Harryhausen, Stan Winston, Pixarjust write your own list). The critics 
have been sharpening their claws for months now, I'm sure. George Lucas 
copped a bad year - the pendulum of Fickle Favor has swung against him, just 
the same way it had swung in favor of James Cameron's TITANIC the previous 
year. The irony is that thirty years ago when he made THX-1138 he was 
receiving plaudits for the same 'dehumanization' that he's being taken to 
task for now.
But wait a minute. TITANIC was based on a real event, and THX-1138 had real 
humans. STAR WARS, on the other hand, is all made up.  It never happened.  
It's meaningless. Therefore it is just a gigantic conceit.  Furthermore, by 
purporting to be yet-another-episode in a larger saga it has franchised 
itself, a thought that is sure to get the critical bile rising. The 
universe is expanding, and the STAR WARS universe is no exception. It has 
become so all-pervading that it has replaced a simulacrum of reality with 
its own complete alternative. To which there can be only one argument: 
exactly. What validates THE PHANTOM MENACE's worth as a film (as opposed to 
a 'movie') is that it has used every tool available at its disposal to 
create something that would otherwise exist only in one individual's 
imagination. It *shares a vision*, surely the guiding precept of all 
cinema. I'm looking forward to THE PHANTOM MENACE.  It's going to be every 
comic book I read as a boy and every game I played with plastic action 
figures. Most of which, I might add, were never 'human'.
I have just seen THE PHANTOM MENACE. In lieu of a second protracted rant I 
offer the following observations:
ˇ It's interesting seeing Jake Lloyd playing the young, tousle-headed 
Annakin Skywalker - it's not until afterwards you remember that the 
cheerful boy hero of this film turns into the villain of the series, 
slaying his mentor, torturing his daughter, and attempting to kill  his 
son. It's in the nature of prequels to be ironic.
ˇ In this installment it is revealed that microorganisms within the   Jedi 
act as a conduit for the Force - maybe the next story could    take us 
into an inner universe as opposed to outer space.
ˇ The Jedi might be wise and powerful but they still can't cure Yoda of 
dyslexia. End every sentence on a verb he does.
ˇ The Trade Federation sound like Samurai and the Gungan speak like 
Jamaicans.
ˇ Conclusion to above point: Lucas has been spending too much time with 
Joseph Campbell.
ˇ Is Lucas trying to fit the phrase 'I've got a bad feeling about this' 
into every episode? This is at least the third film it   appears in.
ˇ Lightsabers are still the coolest weapons in the universe.
ˇ One too many 'oops' in Jake Lloyd's dialogue.
ˇ The twist involving Natalie Portman's character isn't too surprising if 
you can recognize Portman on screen and already know what part she plays.
ˇ The worst line of dialogue is easily the alien sports commentators use 
of that worn-out 90s phrase 'That's gotta hurt'
ˇ Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor make great Jedi Knights.
ˇ The screening was packed with families, reminding us once again that 
STAR WARS is not made for a bunch of stuffed shirts armed with notebooks 
and their own five-star rating system, but for people that like to have a 
good time.
ˇ Lucas and Spielberg are friends, aren't they? How about Spielberg   
directing one of the remaining two installments? The petition  starts 
here.


Title
Review for Nice Girls Don't Explode (1987)
Other film-makers could take a lesson from this comedy, which gets the right 
mileage out of its simple premise: April Flowers (Michelle Meyrink, a 
regular player in teen comedies) is kept away from boys by her 
overprotective mother (Barbara Harris) because fires have a tendency to 
spontaneously ignite whenever her hormones are aroused.  When it looks as 
though she's about to rekindle a friendship with an old flame (William 
O'Leary), Mom goes into overdrive. 
The film's title is suggestive of those disposable quickies from the Troma 
studio, but it's really nothing of the kind.  I don't know whether NICE 
GIRLS DON'T EXPLODE is underrated, overlooked, or just unknown, but it's an 
appealing comedy.  True, there are no great moments or humorous highlights, 
but the film's buoyant tone remains faithful from start to finish.  This is 
aided by the script's trimming of subplots and padding, so that the story is 
almost solely constructed of ongoing oneupmanship between Harris and 
O'Leary, with Meyrink caught in the middle.  Wallace Shawn plays a fourth 
character (a pyromaniac that has trouble making friends!) just to give the 
other three something to bounce off.  What I like about the film is that all 
four of the film's central players not only give totally different 
performances, as if they had been placed together from four separate 
comedies, but also relate to each other in very different ways - e.g. Shawn 
meets Meyrink in a psychiatrist's waiting room, sells incendiary supplies to 
her mother, and makes friends with her boyfriend in jail, yet is completely 
unaware that the three of them have any outside connection.  It's this state 
of inhabiting their own private universes that prevents everyone in the film 
from noticing anyone else's eccentricities - the spillover effect is that we 
don't think they come across as that unusual either. 
The whole idea of teenage hormones literally catching alight in the heat of 
passion makes NICE GIRLS DON'T EXPLODE a humorous reminder of those old 
public information films that American youth was shown in the 50s.  If it 
weren't for the clothes and cars, you'd swear that this film was supposed to 
take place in that era.  In fact, it is so wholesome in its execution that 
it almost could have been made back then - but it's plain that the film's 
appearance is meant to perpetuate the tongue-in-cheek 50s morality of the 
whole enterprise. 

Title
Review for Somewhere in Time (1980)
I wasn't too enthusiastic about this change of pace from writer Richard 
Matheson  after a diet of his sharp sci-fi and horror tales, but later 
viewings have softened my views.  Terribly romantic story of two 
star-crossed lovers goes one up on the Bard by separating them not by 
distance or walls, but by time.  What do you do when your lover lives 68 
years in the past?  That's what we find out when young Chicago playwright 
Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve), like Dana Andrews in LAURA, falls in 
love with the alluring Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour) after seeing her 
portrait.  The most daring stroke of the film (and novel) is to make the 
time travel aspect completely non-scientific: Reeve simply wills himself 
back to 1912.  It sounds laughable, but suits the mood of the film perfectly 
- I believe the reason why SOMEWHERE IN TIME has attracted its devoted 
following is not because of the Reeve/Seymour romance itself but that it so 
assuredly affirms that love is a force to which the laws of the universe 
cannot apply.  Who wouldn't want to do what Reeve does, to create 
simultaneity of time that in effect becomes a kind of eternal youth, without 
the prerequisite, impenetrable science?
Film's premise, lead characters, and magnificent backdrop (the Grand Hotel 
of Michigan's Mackinac Island) has made it popular with romantics, but 
personally I find Reeve's efforts to investigate and reach Seymour's past 
more involving than his arrival.  It's the nature of fantasy to make the 
fantasizing the best part of the journey - when it's actualised it is over.  
That's why I would have liked to see Reeve exploring his new, exciting 
environment for a while instead of heading straight for Seymour's door.  The 
screenplay doesn't give him much of a choice, however - the compressed 
timeframe of the story (and running time of the movie) means that the two 
protagonists don't have long to spend together and fall in love.  It doesn't 
really stretch their credibility - the time travel element has already 
planted the idea of 'destiny' in our minds for us to accept Richard and 
Elise as a couple.  Their final separation scene is startling and, coming 
when it does, highly effective.  Other scenes are more obviously 
manipulative but still work:  Elise squealing "Richard!" upon sighting him 
from the distance; Richard giving Elise just the right kind of smile for her 
portrait; and, in a highlight, Elise slipping out of character onstage to 
ruminate about the man she loves.
Film's ending is a little sappy but points the way directly to Matheson's 
following work, the life-after-death fantasy 'What Dreams May Come'.  
Matheson himself has a walk-on when Reeve passes him outside the hotel.  
Obviously the best way to see this film is at the Grand Hotel itself, where 
SOMEWHERE IN TIME weekends have become an annual event for the film's huge 
fan base.  In-joke: Reeve reads a book entitled 'Travels Through Time', 
authored by Dr Finney - a reference to fantasy writer Jack Finney, author of 
a number of time travel stories and novels.

Review for Hidden, The (1987)
In what could almost be a pedigree of his TWIN PEAKS role as FBI agent
Dale Cooper, Kyle MacLachlan plays an otherworldly FBI agent in search
of a psychotic killer on the loose in L.A.  He teams up with local
detective Michael Nouri after the killer has been cut down in a police
shootout and tries to convince him that their problems are far from
over.  As we quickly discover, the real killer is an alien parasite
that moves from body to body, rendering it nearly impossible to find. 
The good news is that almost immediately the new host exhibits
telltale behavior patterns, revealing the true nature of the alien
hidden within it.  The bad news is that these signs usually include
car theft, bank robbery, and homicide.  
Look at THE HIDDEN one way and it's almost a 50s Juvenile Delinquency
picture - the notion of alien-as-hedonist incorporates the same
elements used to drive a wedge between the cinematic generation gap of
that time: sex, fast cars, loud rock music, destruction of property,
and living like there's no tomorrow.  But even though all of the
alien's incarnations commit acts of casual violence the strange
overall impression is not so much that it is wrong to steal or kill
but that in a civilized society it is simply wrong to do whatever you
feel like.  Just to confuse the matter, the alien chooses middle-aged
subjects for its hosts (I suppose in some cases it doesn't have much
choice).  Was this because the portrayal of younger people going on a
shooting rampage was too uncomfortably close to reality?  It would
have at least drawn attention to the J.D. motifs in the film.  I'll
concede that it's the juxtaposition of the hosts' appearances against
their repugnant activities that provides much of the film's humor. 
Especially effective is the alien's second host body (William Boyett)
whose monosyllabic delivery, beady eyes and tight-lipped expression
make him both amusing and unsettling.  It's useful that Boyett gets
more screen time than the other incarnations because it gives us a
chance to compare him with the much more sedate (but equally elusive)
MacLachlan.
Film manages to make the old alien-parasite routine look fresh thanks
to great pacing that doesn't let up from the opening car chase
(exciting on a big screen), but thinking over the storyline and
script, you'll realize that this could have been a terrible film.  As
it turns out, Bob Hunt's script is served well by good acting, fine
cinematography, great effects, and energetic direction (by Jack
Sholder).  It's one of the few B-movies you'll see with an A budget -
don't  tell me that any film that totals a Porsche in the first scene
has a B-grade budget!  The ending, although strangely neutral (it's
neither totally satisfying nor unsatisfying) suggests in the final
shot that a whole new, different story is just beginning.  I'm glad
they left it up to our imaginations instead of churning out HIDDEN II.

Title
Review for Candy (1968)
Oh, those 60s.  Extravagant version of the novel by Terry Southern and Mason 
Hoffenberg is a lot of fun when seen with an audience in a theater; on 
television it may seem fairly pointless.  It has great curio value because 
it is so patently a product of its time - witness its wild editing, camp 
atmosphere, and rock soundtrack.  But more importantly notice its 
playfulness - we really don't care that the entire film crew is reflected in 
a giant mirror near the end, because it seems so appropriate for the era.  
At a time when directors and actors were turning the lens back on to 
themselves to deliberately break through the 'fourth wall' of the cinema and 
remind us all that 'it's only a movie' it was inevitable that several 60s 
productions would turn out embarrassingly trite or pretentious.  Not so 
CANDY - like its heroine it is infused with a sense of reckless innocence.  
Sure, it's self-indulgent and paints its satire with a broad brush, but if 
anything it's even more fun to watch now than it was in its own time.
Both novel and film are slim reworkings of Voltaire's 'Candide', which dealt 
with the misadventures of a youth in a society of dubious philosophy, 
religion, and morality.  The update is irrelevant for the film experience - 
as a screenplay CANDY could have been invented purely for the cinema (it 
certainly had to abandon the more pornographic elements of the book).  
Swedish teenager Ewa Aulin plays the title character in a suitably vacant 
manner (it's hard to tell whether she can act or not because she is only 
given one sentence at a time, and it is nearly always a reaction or a 
question); consequently it's easy to pass over how well she fits the role.  
She really does capture an oblivious aspect of Candy that prevents us from 
being truly annoyed with her.  It's just as well, because take a look at who 
she's up against - a bombastic, lecherous Richard Burton, an egotistical, 
lecherous James Coburn, and guru-like, lecherous Marlon Brando.  Throw in 
John Astin, Ringo Starr, Walter Matthew (all lecherous) and a few extras 
including an Italian director and a hunchback, and you'll see that Candy 
barely manages to get a word in edgewise.  At the time of  CANDY's release 
some critics saw the involvement of big-name stars as an embarrassment worth 
celebrating in their columns, but as is most often the case with such things 
the film has endured while the notices have been forgotten - modern 
audiences don't mind seeing Brando and Burton play-acting instead of method 
acting.
Of course, Candy is no spokesperson for any women's movement, and with very 
little correlation between her constant disrobing and the story's  satirical 
comment (against the military, the police, the literati, religion, the 
medical profession, and even film-making) she appears as a very doubtful 
heroine indeed.  In some ways she is like BARBARELLA (also released in 1968, 
and with a screenplay by Southern) and the cosmic visions that open and 
close the film allude to her as a traveler through space and time, 
journeying from one outlandish event to another, sampling each in turn.  For 
this reason I don't see Aulin's Candy as being a victim but rather an 
observer - most importantly, she appears unchanged by any of her liaisons 
except the last, at which point she has seen enough and transcends her own 
status of a character, almost literally walking out of her own movie to find 
re-invention elsewhere.  Is Candy an extra-terrestrial visitor?  It would 
explain her naiveté but not her background - unless her family and school 
are also fabrications.   Fortunately such speculation is brushed over 
lightly, sidestepping likely charges of pretension against the film (I don't 
know if this idea is presented in the novel).  This is less brain candy than 
it is eye candy.  It would make a good double bill with THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN, 
if only because of the involvement of Ringo and Southern in both, but then 
again that might be a tad too much for one sitting!  Energetically directed 
by Christian Marquand.  It looks and sounds great in a cinema, so watch for 
prints in revival houses.

Review for Soylent Green (1973)
In THE OMEGA MAN, Charlton Heston played the last human on Earth,
wandering an empty city alone.  Two years later he'd have exactly the
opposite problem - fighting for room in a city of 40 million.  The
year is 2022, and Heston is Detective Thorn, a New York cop
investigating the murder of a director of the Soylent Corporation, a
powerful food processing company responsible for the manufacture of
vegetable concentrate biscuits.  Thorn is impressed by the wealth of
the victim (in this future, "rich" means being able to afford running
water and strawberries), which enables comforts that he and his
roommate Sol (Edward G. Robinson) can only dream of.
In such an overpopulated world, it's only to be expected that life is
cheap.  People crowd like refugees, living from hand to mouth;
attractive young women are rented out with apartments and referred to
as `furniture'.  Whole film is downbeat; the future is not only
crowded but also polluted (everything outdoors is filmed through a
green haze), economically repressed, nearly bereft of all natural
resources, and suffering from the Greenhouse effect.  Director Richard
Fleischer doesn't show us huge mob scenes (apart from one riot
sequence) or grand views of an out-of-control, decaying megalopolis,
but instead gives us the sense of such a future by focusing on
elements of daily life that have irrevocably changed as a consequence.
 Robinson's Sol, who is pointedly the `soul' of the film, is our
emotional and philosophical connection to the unspoiled past - his
memories are supposed to be ours - and provides the film's only
touching moments.  It's a rare film that makes death (by euthanasia) a
pleasant and more preferable alternative than living, but in SOYLENT
GREEN humanity has reached a dead end: it posits that at a certain
level, there are no solutions.  In fact, the revelation at the film's
end (which you'll probably guess beforehand), if reappraised, may not
be the act of evil and exploitation you'll first think, but the only
viable plan left for survival - it will make you wonder about the
lengths humanity will go to in order to remain on the planet, and
whether it is even necessary if the more noble of human
qualities are to be forfeited as a result.
Film works when it operates at a shabby, grass-roots level (it was a
mistake to try to pass off a 1970's video game as 21st century
technology!) and makes the interesting, if depressing, point that
squalor never dates.  Harry Harrison wrote the source novel, MAKE
ROOM! MAKE ROOM!, and was critical of film's production.  Robinson
died soon after it was released (adding poignancy to his death scene).
 At least he left us with a solid, resonant performance.  Also
starring: Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, and Joseph Cotten.

Review for Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies, The (1963)
The Incredibly Strange Creatures That Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up 
Zombies (1963) 82m.  
This one must have been a nightmare for marquee titlers when it was 
first released.  Poverty Row flick is worth seeing as a conversation 
piece, and worth remembering if you're ever forced into a session of 
charades.  Like KILLER NUN; BILLY THE KID VS DRACULA; HEADS YOU DIE, 
TAILS I KILL YOU; and SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS (which at least 
features a ten-year old Pia Zadora with her face painted green) this is 
a film you see only for its title - a marketing tradition which 
video-schlock producers Troma seem to have adopted as their key selling 
point.  Actually, this one isn't as bad as you might think.  It's not 
that great, either.  Three teenagers (one of them played by the films's 
24-year-old director Ray Dennis Steckler) visit a fortune teller at a 
fairground and become involved in her murderous plans.  It's a simple 
enough plot and would take up only half of the film's running time if it 
wasn't padded out with musical numbers.  It's unusual that Steckler 
throws in so many songs (there is one good pop ballad, 'Someone That's 
Not You') because he's obviously more at home with action sequences - 
look at the way he handles the murder scenes, for instance.  They're at 
least better than the dance numbers.  The choreography in this film 
looks like it was done by two twelve-year old girls who learned their 
craft by dancing in front of the TV set.  
Film also looks better than many other indie productions of the time as 
far as costumes and sets are concerned (i.e. it actually has costumes 
and sets).  It was photographed by Vilmos Zsigmond, of all people, whose 
cinematography and co-ordinated primary colors help lift CREATURES out 
of the shoddy, gimcrack appearance of most Z-grade films.  To help make 
his film look less cheap, Steckler emphasises the tackiness of the 
production.  He exploits his low budget by setting his film in tawdry 
dives, carnies, and strip shows, where we expect everything to look 
cheap anyway.  He also manages to make a monster movie without monsters 
- although when it was first shown people in rubber masks ran through 
the aisles at a key point in the screening.  Story's definition of 
'zombies' is technically correct - human beings that have become 
automatons (in this case, by hypnosis) that in turn are labelled 
'monsters' the moment they are disfigured (by acid).  INCREDIBLY STRANGE 
CREATURES isn't as much fun as the title suggests, but is worth seeing 
as a curio of fringe cinema.  Film's finale on the beach is reminiscent 
of film noir B-movies.       


Title
Review for Robin and Marian (1976)
Director Richard Lester has worked with several icons in his career 
(Superman, Butch Cassidy, the Beatles, and the Three Musketeers are 
among the more memorable) and this time around he turns his attention to 
Robin Hood.  As would be expected from Lester, it is not a traditional 
portrayal.  In essence, ROBIN AND MARIAN provides all previous Robin 
Hood films with a final chapter.  Lester and screenwriter James Goldman 
replace images of young heroes galloping through the sward with 
middle-aged not-so-merry men eking out an existence in near-primitive 
conditions.  Story begins with a disillusioned Robin renouncing his 
service to King Richard and returning to Sherwood after many years 
abroad.  After losing his love for king and country he is now free to 
rekindle his desire for Marian.  Ironically, it means he must once again 
become an outlaw, thus also renewing old ties with his former enemy the 
Sheriff of Nottingham.
It's bold of the film to avoid all previous representations of Robin and 
Marian: Robin (Sean Connery) is bearded, has thinning hair, wields a 
longsword more often than a bow, and dresses in shabby, practical 
clothes rather than his more customary Lincoln green.  Likewise, Marian 
(Audrey Hepburn) is not a blushing maiden but a nun, trussed up so 
tightly in habit and wimple that for the first half of the film we see 
only her face.  The younger Hepburn would have made a great Marian 
earlier in the heyday of Hollywood costumers, and it makes sense to 
presume this is why she was chosen for this role (her ten-year absence 
from the screen also suits the 'return' theme essential to the film).  
Yet she is required to play against type, which makes her casting 
confusing.  It's not only Hepburn - all of the characters play against 
type: Marian is shown to be suicidal, the Sheriff is sympathetic, and 
Richard is psychotic.  The only traditional element seen to remain 
steadfast is the romance between Robin and Marian.
Despite John Barry's suggestively romantic score (which Lester wasn't 
happy with) and the prevailing love interest of the leads, Lester's film 
still has that neutral quality found elsewhere in his work - neither too 
grim/realistic, or stylized/lavish.  His trademark humor is also 
downplayed here.  He and Goldman work with their material intelligently 
(although it's too easy to label a film 'revisionist' merely by 
subverting the identities of historical personages), but their film's 
success inevitably boils down to the connection between Connery and 
Hepburn.  As in other Robin Hood stories, they get little screen time 
together, but in this instance it counts: their final scene is entirely 
memorable.  It also brings home one of the primary intentions of the 
film - to break their characters out of archetypes perpetuated by myth 
(not to mention films and books) and present them as real people.  
Film's ending, which would have been unimaginable in the days of Errol 
Flynn, will be offputting to many viewers.  Connery would return as King 
Richard in Kevin Costner's popular 1991 version.  Also with: Robert Shaw 
(the Sheriff), Richard Harris (Richard), Nicol Williamson (Little John).


Title
Review for Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982)
It helps if you're both a Steve Martin fan and an old Hollywood movie buff 
to get the most out of this fastidiously engineered conceit.  Martin, who 
co-wrote with George Gipe and director Carl Reiner, plays a private eye who 
is approached by slinky Rachel Ward (who brings her own performance to what 
might have otherwise just been a mock bombshell role) to find her missing 
father.  The first-person narration, black and white photography, art deco 
titles, and opening score by Miklos Rosza establish within moments that this 
is going to be spoof on Raymond Chandler crime thrillers, but if you were to 
enter this film without knowing its central joke, then you'd no doubt be 
surprised to suddenly see Alan Ladd walking down a corridor while Martin 
rummages through an office.  What DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID sets out to do - 
and it makes my head spin to think how many viewing hours must have been 
spent in order to knit this story together - is to seamlessly insert clips 
from classic Hollywood pictures into Martin's investigation.  Among his many 
encounters he has telephone conversations with Bogart, shares a train 
compartment with Cary Grant, and makes a date with Ingrid Bergman.  All in 
all, 18 different films and 18 different Hollywood players (some of them 
interweaving in and out of the same films) are edited effectively into the 
story.  It's the visual equivalent of David Thomson's one-of-a-kind novel 
'Suspects' - fortunately all the stars and their films are listed in the 
final credits so you don't have to drive yourself crazy trying to figure 
them out afterwards.  The mixture of material makes it hard to determine 
what era DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID is supposed to be set in - Martin's 
reference to the Kinsey Report would place it somewhere in the 50s, which 
seems a bit out of place considering that all but one of the contributing 
films were made in the 40s.
I admire the effort that's been made with the matching.  Not only the 
photography, but the sets, props and costumes (by no less than Edith Head!) 
are also tailored in service of the original footage.  For the most part, 
the clips have also been well selected.  The more familiar moments (e.g. 
Burt Lancaster getting plugged in THE KILLERS, James Cagney performing a 
casual execution in WHITE HEAT) don't work nearly as well - in fact it's 
annoying to see the Cagney scene, which was effectively chilling in the 
original, lifted out of context.  Contrast this to Veronica Lake's bit, 
which is funny even though she says only two words.  DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR 
PLAID was never meant to be a laugh riot - it's more an affectionate 
pastiche, if anything else - but some of Martin's hardboiled dialogue is 
hysterical.  There's a few in-jokes (the 'You know how to whistle' line from 
TO HAVE OR HAVE NOT; a reference to Charles Laughton's star turn as THE 
HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME) but the fun comes mainly from watching Martin 
delivering offbeat lines to Hollywood stars who are playing their scenes 
straight.  It should be noted that unlike many other comedies that integrate 
found footage, the tone of Reiner's film is never campy or patronizing to 
its older source material.  Finally, and most importantly, DEAD MEN DON'T 
WEAR PLAID has one rare distinction: it includes the only scene with an 
actor in drag that I've actually ever found funny.  Poor Fred MacMurray just 
didn't know what hit him.

Title
Review for Eyes Wide Shut (1999)
Yikes.  I'm not sure how many people are qualified to handle the critique of 
a new Kubrick film upon its release, but one thing is certain: time has 
proven many a detractor wrong.  Kubrick's films have always confounded 
expectations, which is why inevitably they become reappraised and treated 
more generously.  2001 was not the cowboys-in-space jingoism that sci-fi 
films of the time were built on; BARRY LYNDON was more like a walk through 
an art gallery than a lusty historical romance; FULL METAL JACKET avoided 
the path of all other Vietnam films and spent one half of its time at boot 
camp and the other half in burned-out rubble.  And even though I should know 
better, I've also fallen victim to my own preconceptions.  I was crushed 
after seeing the long-awaited premiere of THE SHINING - it just wasn't scary 
- but went back for a second viewing nonetheless, and then a third, and then 
a fourth.  It has become more insidious each time and has yielded a 
subterranean, primal quality that I find strangely engrossing.  I figure the 
same will happen with EYES WIDE SHUT.  The difference is that this time I 
was not disappointed.  That is, I didn't have any expectations.
I'm not prepared to tell anyone what EYES WIDE SHUT is 'about', either 
storywise or in terms of concept.  I think it's sufficient to say that 
Kubrick is at the top of his form - at the age of 70 he has retained the 
provocation and vivacity of his earlier works.  But I wonder how many 
critics will go into theaters with not only their mouths but their ears wide 
shut also.  Hypothetically: four people go to see EWS.  One person enthuses 
about it afterwards.  Another is bored senseless.  The other two are simply 
confused.  Guess which three of the above were silly enough to read 
tabloids, watch 60 MINUTES, look for gossip on the Internet, and end up with 
their own fixed vision of what EYES WIDE SHUT was 'supposed' to be.  No, 
there are no hot-and-heavy sex scenes between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, 
and no full frontal nudity on their behalf either (it's with much 
satisfaction that I browsed through all these misguided rumors that I've 
been saving up only after actually seeing the film for myself).  But you 
have to wonder how prankish Kubrick himself is in this regard - the film's 
theatrical teaser, in which Cruise wordlessly fondles Kidman before a 
mirror, is undoubtedly going to plant preconceptions in every viewer's mind. 
  In fact Cruise and Kidman spend only a handful of scenes together: the 
storyline is concerned mainly with Cruise's own journey of discovery. His 
character alone appears to be responsible for the film's title, Kubrick's 
metaphor for those who walk through an uncertain world with eyes wide open 
but seeing nothing, or at least nothing they can comprehend.  Cruise meets a 
variety of characters who are not what they seem:  they wear masks, 
costumes, or wigs; they have foreign accents or ambivalent sexuality; they 
appear by chance and then are unavailable when he seeks them; even the city 
he lives in has a hybrid idenitity - for the first half of the film we could 
easily believe it was in Europe.  He has elliptical conversations with his 
wife and doesn't know when his friend (Sydney Pollack) is telling the truth. 
  Everyone in this film wears a mask, even when they're not wearing masks: 
Cruise's trademark grin is different this time, a nervous reaction that 
seems to be covering frustration or cold panic.  Cruise starts 
investigating, and Kubrick's Steadicam sinuously keeps pace with him.  
Throughout the film he is primarily an observer - he encounters many women 
in various states of undress but is permitted only to look and not touch 
(two models at a party, a prostitute (and her roommate), a drug overdose, a 
corpse, a debauchery.  This frustration is obviously piling up on him - the 
first hour of the film is shot in warm and seductive flesh tones - and even 
when he takes action he remains an observer rather than a participant.  But, 
like Cruise, we will never know what the 'truth' behind this tale really is, 
and no doubt film buffs will be picking over clues for some time to come.  
It's worth bearing in mind, however, that Kubrick would not have wanted any 
one truth to emerge in the first place.
It's perverse that Kubrick should spend two years shooting a film that takes 
place over two days, but the results appear to be worth it.  Cruise and 
Kidman have never appeared so intense.  Cruise, carrying the weight of the 
film, does well in the preferred Kubrick style: the deliberately paced 
dialogue (each character takes their turn to speak), the way exposition is 
dragged out by characters who are nervous or awkward, the way one person's 
dialogue is repeated as a question by another.  All of this makes EYES WIDE 
SHUT unique among other contemporary films that throw up their pop offerings 
on similar subjects.  It is by turns playful, sensuous, menacing, funny, 
otherwordly, and elegant. It is a film that will get under your skin.  It's 
mesmerizing just to watch these people acting (the well-publicized constant 
retakes eventually shape the mannered performances preferred in Kubrick's 
productions), including scene-stealing supporting roles such as the rental 
shop owner and the desk clerk.  The fact that the married couple of the film 
are played by a real married couple also help give the film a little extra 
edge - that, and the knowledge that this was the master film-maker's final 
opus.
It's appropriate that Kubrick should go out with a deliberation on 
obsession.  It's fitting too that the final credit crawl should be 
accompanied by a waltz, given that his most indelible cinematic image has 
been that of spacecraft gliding to the strains of Strauss.  And despite the 
tentative plans for at least one further film, Kubrick probably knew all 
along that this was going to be his swan song.  He died only days after 
screening his approved final cut.  The abrupt, final line of the film can be 
read as Kubrick's last joke: he literally went out with a bang.
And ten years from now, I'll start thinking on what EYES WIDE SHUT is 
actually 'about'.
This might sound like the worst of cliches, but I saw 2001 at the age of 14 
and it changed my life.  Thank you, Stanley.


Title
Review for Sleepy Hollow (1999)
Did you ever see that short Disney cartoon when you were a kid, the one 
about the Headless Horseman?  Do you remember the wild finale, a mixture of 
scary slapstick, which had Ichabod Crane galloping for dear life towards the 
bridge that marked that essential piece of childhood myth, the Line Of 
Safety.  Tim Burton remembers, and I find it perfectly suitable that the 
former (though briefly-tenured) Disney animator should produce a live-action 
elaboration of that short piece.  Here's another gem from the Burton 
repertoire, and one which few others would have attempted in this day and 
age: a good old-fashioned horror film.
Set firmly in the 18th century and occupying a universe all of its own 
(although strongly derived from the Hammer films of the late 60s and early 
70s), SLEEPY HOLLOW succeeds because it refuses the self-deprecating 
concessions film-makers almost seem obliged to put in their films nowadays.  
No one-liners.  No provision for a sequel.  Its only nudge to the audience 
is a well-timed millennium reference (and, intentionally or not, a couple of 
images from THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS and PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, the 
visages of Jack Skellington and Large Marge respectively) and 
state-of-the-art FX notwithstanding, the end result could pass muster as 
some sort of lost classic unearthed in the Hammer Studio vaults - it even 
has that distinct indigo hue and those washed-out faces.  This movie is so 
out-of-era that it's simply wonderful: not exactly a homage, not even a 
revision - it's just a crackling good Gothic Yarn.  New York constable 
Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), is sent to the small agrarian township of 
Sleepy Hollow to investigate a recent spate of decapitation murders.  The 
townsfolk blame a local legend, which Depp airily dismisses - at first.  A 
first-hand encounter with the Horseman quickly turns him into a believer.  
Depp's transition from rational scientific enquiry to supernatural and 
arcane lore works seamlessly into the story: it doesn't seem wrong to us 
that he should 'switch sides' so easily, integrating a little of both into 
his investigation.  The seeds have already been planted, after all, in the 
skewed flashbacks to his childhood (although that haunted child reminded me 
more of a young Burton than a young Depp), so the appearance of Crane as a 
well-attired adult investigator poking around crime scenes in gloomy forests 
is no more peculiar to us than it would be if we were watching an episode of 
a protean X-FILES.
The concerns of the plot are duly interspersed with Horror intrusions (and 
how Burton loves to see those severed heads roll!) but by its finale SLEEPY 
HOLLOW has let slip its full melodramatic glory.  The usual lightning 
flashes and explosions of shattering glass easily become the type of genre 
standards that are included only because they're expected, but by the time 
you have sat through ninety minutes of SLEEPY HOLLOW, the clichés are no 
longer clichés.  Every swirling mass of leaves and gout of blood conspires 
to produce a cinematic, gothic opera: the Headless Horseman is brutal and 
frightening; the sky is perpetually grey or stormy; the trees are black and 
twisted; everything outside is muted with dampness; the scenes of the 
countryside, the feasts, the cornshocks, the windmills and the kitchens are 
reminiscent of Dutch and Flemish masters; similarly the striking faces of 
the cast could also have been lifted from portraits (although I wish 
Christina Ricci had been left with her raven tresses instead of those blonde 
curls), indicating that Burton's visual sense of the film was inspired by 
paintings.  Irrespective of its reference points, SLEEPY HOLLOW is its own 
entity.  But if it's "supposed" to be a Hammer film, a recreation of 
17th-century art, or post-Disney trauma, then I'll vote for the last on that 
list - if only to tantalize myself with the possibility that Burton might 
have something to say about the shooting of Old Yeller or the death of 
Bambi's mom in his future projects.

Title
Review for Hollywood Rated 'R' (1997)
Something special for all of those interested in exploitation films, and 
an education for those who've never seen any.  Appropriately 
exploitative documentary (there's nudity and coarse language) by 
directing team Doug Headline and Dominique Cazenave takes us through the 
fifties, sixties, and seventies and looks at the changes in 
non-Hollywood products, charting their evolution from nudity to violence 
to horror to drugs to blaxploitation.  There aren't many film clips but 
plenty of trailers, which unfortunately are of a very poor photographic 
quality and give the impression that these films looked a lot worse than 
they actually were (I have yet to see THE CRAWLING HAND, but after 
seeing the promo I think it should be a priority).  It should be pointed 
out however that the trailers were often more entertaining than the 
films themselves: nowhere today, for example, would you see a film 
advertised with the shrieking tagline (and possible solipsism) "See a 
human being murdered before your eyes!" 
Mostly, though, HOLLYWOOD RATED R is a collection of talking heads - as 
the interviews are delivered with such affection and interest for the 
subject, the one and a half hour running time passes quickly.  John 
Landis almost steals the show with his enthusiastic performance, but 
there are many other delights in store, often of the 
two-for-the-price-of-one variety: e.g. Charles Napier tells us about his 
career with Russ Meyer (and offers an interesting explanation for 
Meyer's use of remote locations); David Friedman talks of his 
collaboration with goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis; Barbara Steele 
gives a surprisingly animated interview about the role of women in film, 
referring to her work with Mario Bava and Jonathon Demme; and Forrest 
Ackerman and Joe Dante reminisce about the William Castle movies they 
saw as kids (how I envy those guys!).  I wish Headline and Cazenave had 
cut a couple of the slower interviews - there's a labored one which is 
intercut with all kinds of gags and sound effects, but it still doesn't 
come across as particularly interesting - and gotten someone like Paul 
Bartel on screen instead.  If you've never sampled this unique genre of 
films, then this may well whet your appetite.  Most interesting line 
comes from director Larry Cohen - "All movies are exploitation".

Review for Godzilla (1998)
It's getting harder to stay ignorant.  In the mid-80s it was possible to 
see films like ET or GREMLINS without knowing what the effects-generated 
critters looked like beforehand.  It was a luxury that imbued these 
films with a sense of mystery and event.  Godzilla (the monster, not the 
movie) has been a different matter.  Toy catalogues, film reviews, 
television advertisements, and every other medium have been spewing out 
images of the Scaly One with such prevalence that sneak previews of the 
lizard itself are almost unavoidable.  And if it's not pics of Godzilla 
then it's the gossipy giveaways of the storyline, or the reviews that 
get released even before the movie makes it to the local multiplex.
I generally shut myself off from such spoilers, but this time around the 
tone of the local reviews has made itself quite clear: The lizard is a 
turkey; GODZILLA bites; the movie is a bomb.  So it was hardly 
surprising by the time I got to the cinema that the non-expectations I 
usually try to maintain had given way to very low expectations indeed.  
It was after seeing GODZILLA for myself, however, and thinking "This 
isn't that badactually it's fun", that I suddenly realized I had been 
missing the point all along: GODZILLA had been made specifically for an 
audience of middle-aged film critics!  Not the teenagers and families 
and SF/Fantasy/FX fans that filled the screening I had attended.  
They're not the target audience.  Obviously: they're not the ones 
writing the reviews.  How could I have been so blind?
I'm aware that this is an old argument, and that sarcasm is a shoddy 
platform on which to build it, but I don't see that it is any less true.  
Reviewing the reviewers, I discovered that every last grumpy 
reptile-hating one of them had been over the age of 45.  I would propose 
from this sample that this age henceforth be the point at which all 
critics in the public domain are reassessed, in much the same fashion 
that drivers licenses are renewed at certain age limits.  It's clear to 
me that there are quite a few current reviewers licenses that need 
serious re-examination, if not revoking.
It's clear also that the writing-directing-producing team of Roland 
Emmerich and Dean Devlin knew the kind of critical reception their 
popcorn movie would get, which explains why the film's most ineffectual 
character is a non-too-subtle lampoon of critic Roger Ebert, who had 
panned Emmerich and Devlin's earlier collaborations INDEPENDENCE DAY and 
STARGATE.  I wouldn't think they are singling Ebert out personally; it's 
just that he represents a critical homogeneity they resent.  The 
collective hostility of this faction will, I guess, be mainly directed 
to the contrast of two films, JURASSIC PARK and the 1956 GODZILLA.  It's 
true that GODZILLA poaches a lot of imagery from JURASSIC PARK and then 
simply amplifies it under its self-promoted precept 'Size Does Matter', 
but if you view it in terms of how Spielberg's film would look under the 
influence of a couple of bennies then I don't see how you can miss the 
trippy, demented fun of it all. If it's not a rush, it's still a ride.
It's the original GODZILLA, a cult movie with a huge following, that 
provides the more challenging comparison.  It was a landmark film of its 
type which established a new export market for Japanese films, but at 
the risk of offending all Gojira fanatics, I have never understood the 
appeal of the Toho-produced Godzilla films.  It was only when the 
momentum of the series reached DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, in which every 
available rubber suit was brought out of mothballs for one last 
free-for-all scrap, that I could appreciate the divine absurdity of it 
all.  Also going for the original was the large-scale destruction of 
Tokyo (Godzilla's a lot meaner in his first appearance) which, again, 
must have been impressive in 1956 - but isn't the destruction just as 
impressive in 1998, even taking into account the current sophistication 
of CGI?  And even the appeal of seeing cities flattened was lost in the 
original series when the studios realized it was a lot cheaper for 
Gojira and his cronies to slug it out in open countryside.  From this 
point on it simply became men in costumes wrestling each other, a trend 
which has still, mystifyingly, remained popular today with such shows as 
POWER RANGERS.
But finally, I suppose, it is the allegorical connection that critics 
will play as their trump card.  The original GODZILLA meant something: 
it was a national psyche which watched itself being destroyed over and 
over again, still smarting from the humiliation and disenfranchisement 
of losing the war and the traumatisation of genbaku-sho and other 
effects of the Holocaust.  How can the 1998 version compete with that?  
It can't, and it doesn't try.  Instead, it's a calculated, hypermarketed 
cash cow.  If Godzilla allegorizes anything , then it is the seemingly 
unstoppable power of the Hollywood money machine, trampling merry hell 
over all those who have grown out of its demographic.  GODZILLA becomes 
a battle of beasts; not just Ebert versus a lizard, but the Godzilla of 
film critics against the Godzilla of summer blockbusters.
At the end it appears I have not said one thing, good nor bad, about 
GODZILLA itself.  But that's okay.  It may leave you free to see it for 
yourself without any expectations.  And if you still have no idea what 
the monster looks like, I take my hat off to you.  By this stage that 
would be no mean feat.  But I should point out, however, that I still do 
not know what happens in the final episode of SEINFELD.  Beat that if 
you can.


Title
Review for Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)
A few years ago I saw a festival release of Orson Welles' 1948
MACBETH, one of a number of Welles films screening during that week. 
Before it was halfway through the audience began to leave, until only
half were left seated for the final credits.  My viewing of the film
was distracted twofold: firstly by the slow exodus of patrons, and
secondly by the question that kept going through my mind: What Were
They Expecting?  You go to see Welles playing Macbeth....surely you
expect to see just that - Welles playing Macbeth.
I have never responded the same to film criticism since.  In the case
of THE LOST WORLD, this argument would translate thusly: You go to see
a movie about dinosaurs on the rampage, and what do you expect to see?
 Dinosaurs on the rampage.  Your expectations are satisfied.  If you
go in expecting to see insights of any interpersonal, religious,
philosophical, scientific, or religious nature; if you go in looking
for subtexts , or representations of the human condition, or the
growth and/or learning of individuals within group dynamics, then, my
friend, it is time for you to start reassessing your critical acumen,
or go see a different movie.
Having attended a preview of THE LOST WORLD I was in the fortunate
position of not having heard or read a single word about it (I confess
this took some effort of ignorance on my part - and thank goodness I
had no inkling about the final twenty minutes), yet I had a foreboding
about Spielberg's new film well before I saw it.  It may not be
fashionable to like Spielberg this year, and the critics may sneer at
his dinosaur movie.  Why?  That question could easily be answered with
another: What  Were They Expecting?  Or, more simply, it could be that
some people just don't like to see anybody else having a good time.
As for my own reaction?  As far as adventure movies go, THE LOST WORLD
is a peach.  It may be an even better ride than JURASSIC PARK, which
it reworks unabashedly.  The first forty-five minutes lack
involvement, but once Spielberg hits his stride (in a boffo set-piece
inside a trailer) the film never lets up.  The dinosaur attacks are
relentless - and the assorted dinos get far more screen time than in
the original - but even though THE LOST WORLD turns out to be a
wholesale human slaughter, we're never made to feel the dinosaurs are
villains.  Spielberg restrains sentimentality and doesn't get us
feeling they are the good guys either - they're simply enormous
animals, and there is no need to portray them as enraged monsters
(although there is a humorous reference to GODZILLA at one point). 
The dinosaurs work: not because they have been meticulously and
stunningly recreated by ILM, but because, as in JURASSIC PARK, their
behaviors and reactions are entirely believable.
Fans of Crichton's book JURASSIC PARK will be pleased to see some
moments from the original story make their way into the movie sequel -
notably the opening scene on a beach, and a sequence with a T-Rex at a
waterfall.  And it's great to see the raptors utilising one of their
scarier talents in the book by really leaping about everywhere. 
Screenwriter David Koepp, who worked with Crichton on the first film,
goes solo this time and eliminates most of the unnecessary
fussing-about -between-locations of the novel in favour of a more
linear narrative.  Spielberg choreographs his stunts and twists with
relish - his only misjudged moment involves a youngster and some
unlikely acrobatics - but there is a peculiar, distancing tone to his
work.  JURASSIC PARK's underlying philosophy was optimistic: the dream
of an enthusiast which turns out badly.  THE LOST WORLD is darker,
unsympathetic, and far from noble, in which the innocent as well as
the guilty pay the price.  This, ultimately, may be what prevents it
from being enjoyable to some viewers - while others may feel it 
plainly isn't dark enough.
Will there be a third?  If so, Spielberg does not feel, at this stage,
that he needs to helm it.  With THE LOST WORLD he has revisited
JURASSIC PARK and expanded on every set piece of that predecessor (the
knockabout scene with the raptors is a highlight) as well as adding
new surprises.  It's about as good as any dinosaur movie could be (Oh
yeah, there were human actors in it too - Jeff Goldblum, Julianne
Moore, Pete Postlethwaite - they're all fine) and if it winds up being
wearily dismissed by the ever-growing number of critics that seem to
have forgotten what it was like to go to the movies as a kid, well
then, one can only wonder if Spielberg might not do it all again after
all.  JURASSIC PARK 3: An island, a pack of raptors, half-a-dozen
Tyrannosaurs, and a hand-picked selection of  film critics.  I'd pay
to see that.

Title
Review for Nankyoku monogatari (1983)
     I've always been skeptical about the exploitation of animals in
Japanese films since THE ADVENTURES OF MILO AND OTIS, but this effort,
at least, carries a disclaimer stating that none of the dogs used in
the making of this film were mistreated.  Which is a relief,
considering what we see them go through.  Story, which is largely
speculative, recounts the survival of a dog team abandoned at a
Japanese research base in Antarctica towards the end of 1957.  Ken
Takakura and Tsunehiko Watase play two scientists exploring the pole.
When an expedition gets lost they turn to two of their most reliable
dogs to help save their lives.  It's an opening which impresses upon us
the hostility of the continent, so we are not surprised when the
research team abandons the base before the onset of the savage polar
winter.  It is while Takurara and Watase are on board the icebreaker
waiting for them outside the Antarctic shelf that they--as do
we--discover, to their horror, that it is impossible for them to
retrieve the dog team from the base.  Under protest, the two scientists
are taken home, and most of the ensuing film juxtaposes their lives in
Japan (they are disillusioned and feel shame) with  the lives of the
dogs as they struggle for survival.
     Film has many sad moments--we see the resourceful dogs die one by
one--but these are undermined a little by the uneasy mix of fact and
conjecture.  There are other lapses in judgment, such as a contrived
scene involving an attacking whale, but most intrusive is the use of a
narrator who anthropomorphizes the dogs and gives their scenes the kind
of stagey atmosphere reminiscent of early Disney animal stories--it may
be said however that this cutesifying of animals is not uncommon in
Japanese entertainment.  In any case, all of this is outweighed by the
spectacular scenery (let's face it, Antarctica looks good in any film),
especially some stunning shots of the team pulling their sled across
the ice, and the dogs running wild in their frozen wonderland. If you
have a dog, you'll probably want to run outside and play ball with it
afterwards.  Directed by Koreyoshi Kurahara, with a simple but
effective score by Vangelis.

Title
Review for Talk Radio (1988)
Oliver Stone's film of Eric Bogosian's stage play (they collaborated
on the screenplay) was received favourably by critics but ended up
unnoticed by the public amid Stone's bigger-budget successes.  It
begins and ends with marathon performances by Bogosian in the role of
Barry Champlain, a Dallas shock-jock on the verge of being syndicated
nationwide.  Everything about Champlain is on the edge, including his
rocky relationships with producer/girlfriend Leslie Hope, wife Ellen
Greene, and boss Alec Baldwin.  Isolated in his darkened studio, he
rants to unseen callers as if he were addressing his invisible demons.
 His listening audience is largely hostile, and he is always on the
attack.  At first we are prepared to accept Champlain as a champion
for the underdog; as more and more callers run the gauntlet of his
show we grow to mistrust him.  The moment we believe he has finally
lost his balance is when he turns on one of his admirers and insults
her mercilessly, using exactly the same time of confrontational and
interruptive tactics he reserves for the bigots, fascists, and junkies
that comprise most of his audience.
Champlain is so unpredictable and fast-talking that it is difficult
for us to figure out his real agenda.  But he doesn't seem to have
one.  It's the line he snaps to a detractor at a ball game that gives
him away, when he tells her the reason she doesn't like his show is
because she has no sense of humor.  Champlain is no activist, merely
an egotist who is running his own private put-on (similarly, TALK
RADIO masquerades as an issues piece but is essentially a character
study) and is concerned only with his ratings.  There are moments he
has on air when he looks as if he may let the mask slip - but 
he has gone too far to turn back now.
Clearly, enjoyment of TALK RADIO will depend on how much you like
Bogosian's performance.  The scenes with him on the air crackle thanks
to Stone's charged direction and tight editing by David Brenner and
Joe Hutshing.  If you've ever listened to late-night talkback and
found some of the callers unsettling, you're bound to relive that
feeling again in the paranoid atmosphere of Champlain's studio. 
Bogosian's  meeting with an incoherent teenager (Michael Wincott) is
by turns hilarious and chilling.  He's just one of several memorable
callers, many of whom were voiced by the same group of actors. 
Inspiration for both film and play was the assassination of Denver DJ
Alan Berg by White Supremacists - exactly the kind of audience that
would be incensed by Champlain's uncompromising broadcasts.

Title
Review for 'burbs, The (1989)
     Director Joe Dante has an affection for small-town communities,
even when he's unleashing all manner of havoc upon them.  It's evident
in his films, and is the subject of his 1991 television series EERIE,
INDIANA.  It should come as no surprise, then, to see his involvement
in THE 'BURBS, a film devoted to the subject.  Story takes place in the
suburb of Hinkley Hills, where enigmatic, unseen neighbors have just
moved into the rundown house next door to Tom Hanks and wife Carrie
Fisher.  Egged on by a couple of his neighbors, Hanks' paranoia about
the new arrivals escalates to absurd heights.  Picture runs out of
steam before the end, as the more recognizable idiosyncrasies of
suburbia in the opening sequences give way to situations that become
increasingly outlandish, preventing the film from becoming the
definitive statement on suburban neuroses that many moviegoers were no
doubt hoping for.  But if THE 'BURBS doesn't live up to its premise, it
still works effectively as a kind of goofy homage to suburbanites.
Dante's tendency towards cartoonish fantasy planes all satirical edges
off the story: the neighborhood he gives us is the type of communal
playground we would have liked to remember as children; a place of
eccentric, comical inhabitants (Bruce Dern, Rick Ducommun, and Corey
Feldman, to name a few), a weird gothic house (placed right in the
middle of a cul-de-sac!), friendly feuding, spying, night-time strolls,
and intrigue.  The film ends with the enthusiastic line "I love this
street", and by that time it's easy to share the sentiment.  We realize
that the characters belong in their suburban niche.
     As with other Dante films, THE 'BURBS is rife with references to
films and television - and his entire neighborhood set seems to be a
product of that as much as any other source.  Feldman invites friends
over to watch a scene unfolding on the street as if it were part of a
movie (which it is), and describes the activities of his neighbors to a
date as if they were characters in a story (which they are).  Dante
fans are used to such self-referential treatment -- as usual, he puts
his personal stamp on everything.  One of my favorite sequences is
nothing more than a walk down a path, which Dante shoots in flinty-eyed
Sergio Leone-style closeups.  It would be hard not to think that the
cast must have had a ball making the movie -- even Dern plays it
strictly for laughs, for a change.   I can't help thinking it would
come over better late at night at a drive-in.  A good companion piece
would be the surreal 1981 film NEIGHBORS.  Other faces on the street
include: Henry Gibson, Gale Gordon, and Dante regulars Robert Picardo
and Dick Miller.  Music by Jerry Goldsmith, who, in keeping with the
film's in-joke style, drops in themes from his score for PATTON.

Title
Review for Caveman (1981)
An engaging, low-budget flick (how much money do you need to make a caveman 
film anyway?) shot in Mexico by director Carl Gottlieb.  It was one of Ringo 
Starr's more appealing roles - aside from interesting projects like THE 
MAGIC CHRISTIAN and THAT'LL BE THE DAY he made weird cameos in films like 
200 MOTELS and LISZTOMANIA.  In CAVEMAN, Ringo's doleful expression and 
shambling  posture win us over from the start (I'm sure many a critic 
remarked at the time that the ex-Beatle's best acting performance to date 
didn't require him to speak).  Even though there is no dialogue in the film 
we learn that he is Atouk, a member of a tribe ruled by the burly, 
formidable Tonda (Oaklands Raider pro John Matuszak).  Dissatisfied with 
life in the tribe - and frustrated by his desire for Tonda's mate Lana 
(Barbara Bach, looking very sexy in furs) - he sets off on his own and 
gradually meets other loners.  Together they form their own tribe of 
outsiders.  Traditionally, in most 'serious' movies of this genre, a 
supposed misfit is ejected from the tribe and is eventually adopted into a 
more enlightened tribal society.  Here it's the opposite - Ringo's group is 
a proud mixture of minorities.  Yet it's they who discover fire, music and 
the world's largest poached egg, while the more traditional/conformist group 
gets nowhere.  By no means are you expected to draw any serious subtexts 
from these scenes - the group's accidental discoveries are played for 
laughs, though do get a little predictable after a while.  One of my 
favorite moments occurs when Ringo and friend Dennis Quaid simultaneously 
'learn' to walk erect and then immediately shrug off thoughts of returning 
to their less evolved former tribe leader.
Unfortunately, CAVEMAN resorts to physical comedy for its final act (the 
story starts taking weird turns when Quaid's character disappears down a 
river), and its lazy incorporation of classical tunes into the soundtrack is 
a little irritating, but it's still one of the more watchable cave-people 
movies.  Animator David Allen, whose creatures are generally better than the 
low-budget films they appear in, creates some comic dinosaurs that look as 
good as any found in major studio pictures of the time.  The simple 
vocabulary invented for the film consists of character names and a few verbs 
and nouns - you'll easily pick up the words for love, fire, monster, and 
others.  In one of the film's funniest elements, Evan Kim plays an Asian who 
cannot communicate with the other tribe members because of a language 
barrier - guess which language he speaks!  It's a good film for a group of 
young children to watch (one word may need to be bleeped) because its 
wordless presentation is bound to get them explaining the subtleties of the 
storyline to each other.  It's also fun for older viewers to see the 
pre-Hollywood lives of some of the cast being duplicated on screen:  former 
model Bach strikes a number of alluring poses on her bed, football player 
Matuszak finds himself on the receiving end of a dogpile, and drummer Ringo 
gets to join in an improv session around his tribe's newly-invented 
campfire.  He would go on to marry Bach shortly after production wrapped on 
the movie.  You won't have to watch it for too long to see why!

Title
Review for North West Frontier (1959)
Supremely enjoyable adventure yarn finds Kenneth More and Lauren
Bacall, among others, making a train trip to Delhi in 1905 India. 
British officer Captain Scott (More) is to escort a 6-year old Hindu
prince away from an uprising of Moslem rebel fanatics.  Accompanying
him are the prince's governess (Bacall), a cynical journalist (Herbert
Lom), an arms dealer, and a couple of representatives from the British
embassy.  With such a diverse group it's only likely to expect much
philosophical/political debate, and sure enough, everyone has their
say.  We don't weary of this, however, because their arguments never
sink to the level of bickering or breast-beating.  They are controlled
- almost polite - with each person a self-proclaimed expert on the
values of the others.  At any rate, they only get into discussions
while the train is on the move, and their journey is anything but
smooth.
Tidily-paced story has plenty of suspense, action, and interesting
characters.  Even though none of the passengers really know each other
they are always congenial, warm, and supportive.  Wilfrid Hyde-White's
dear old gentleman is unflappable no matter what the circumstances -
but he, like More, is simply displaying the distance of manners that
the British relied on to get them through those turbulent colonial
years.  More speaks in exactly the same snappy, chipper tone of voice
throughout the film (He's also the only one who seems to sweat) as if
he were rallying a scout troop.  It's easy to like these characters 
because they're always looking after each other.  Even  Gupta, the
Indian engine driver, has Victoria, his beloved engine, to fuss over. 
And Scott's relationship with Gupta is not of the sahib/menial
variety.  They genuinely enjoy each other's company.  It's great
seeing them relax and sing a cheerful boating song while the train
trundles along the empty frontier.  If this all sounds to good to be
true, then don't worry: there is still enough underlying tension from
one exponent of the group to provide a showdown at the film's end -
fortunately not to the expense of any of the other passengers.  Don't
you hate movies that set up characters with noble qualities just so it
will seem more poignant when they get killed off in some contrived act
of self-sacrifice?  Decent production values supply plenty of location
shooting, big crowd scenes, and wide-screen photography (I wish I'd
seen this in a cinema).  Strangely, the only image I remember from
first seeing this film years ago was that of the small prince standing
before a giant spinning flywheel.

Title
Review for Titanic (1997)
It's a safe bet that you have by now seen TITANIC.  Going by the size
of attendances it would seem that everyone is seeing it.  Of course,
the size of those attendances is probably one reason why many people
have been purposefully avoiding it.  Understandable, but that is not
to say the immediate cinema experience is not without its own quirky
merits.  Try going when the tickets are half price, for example.  I
did.  In the school holidays.  If the mob of passengers that was
trying to get to the lifeboats was half as big as the throng trying to
get into the cinema then my appreciation of what the survivors of the
Titanic went through was well assured.  We sat in the queue for an
hour and a half, which would have been enough time to see another
movie, and the doors opened to admit the rush.  It didn't end there,
because once inside the cinema our vicarious suffering was augmented
further by the incessant sub-polar breeze of the air conditioning
system, thus ensuring that by the third hour our empathy for the
passengers floating in the Atlantic was at a state approaching
Nirvana.  By the time the credits rolled I had barely enough
circulation left to get out before Celine Dion started singing.
So, how good is TITANIC?  Firstly, it comes as no surprise that
director James Cameron came to choose it as a project.  A glance at
his earlier work will tell you why.  This man makes the bluest looking
movies around.  THE ABYSS, ALIENS, THE TERMINATOR.  If his next film
isn't set in the North Pole I'll eat my hat.  Secondly, if you're
going to see this movie, then it has to be in a cinema.  If you'd
rather wait for the video release, then you might as well stick a toy
boat in the bath and watch that instead.  In the spirit of the old
Hollywood epics, TITANIC - no tautology intended - is big.
Cameron is to be applauded for resuscitating the Hollywood epic, but
what does he have to offer that's new?  I'd like to think it was more
than a budget blowout on huge-scale models and state-of-the-art
special effects.  This story, after all, has been told many times
before.  His film is definitely more engaging than the turgid 1953
TITANIC with Clifton Webb (after 45 minutes I was rooting for the
iceberg) but doesn't have the emotional edge of the classic A NIGHT TO
REMEMBER.  In fact, it's due to the latter that Cameron's TITANIC
failed to hit me at gut level.  I'd already seen the class divisions,
the injustice, the incompetence, the unlucky coincidences.  I was more
interested, this time around, to see how Cameron would transport me to
the scene of the disaster; how he would make me empathise with that
tremendous sense of loss and fear.
But instead, he backs off.  All the manipulative moments you would
expect never arrive: the panic for the lifeboats, the noble
self-sacrifices, the sudden topsy-turvy devaluation and re-evaluation
of human lives.  When I saw two silky Afghan hounds boarding the ship
early on I filed the scene away for later reference: Future Camera
Shot - Dogs Struggling Helpless and Bewildered in the Water.  A
sympathy-grabbing moment for sure.  He doesn't let it happen.  Cameron
is more interested in recreating the disaster, not reliving it, so
distils the humanity of the story into two characters.  You've seen
the promos so you know the rest - TITANIC is a love story between
third-class Leonardo DiCaprio and upper-class Kate Winslet.  And it
would not be a proper love story if it were not a triangle, which is
where Billy Zane comes in.  We know straight away that Zane is
completely wrong for Winslet (let's face it, after DEAD CALM who's
ever going to trust this guy on a boat again?) but it takes two hours
of screen time before he gets the message, by which time the ship is
sinking already, and the real reason we all went to see the movie
finally gets underway.  But even here the tragedy of the event is
absent - the story merely shifts from a romance on a floating ship to
an adventure on a sinking ship, and Cameron's throwaway moments of
comic relief prevent the terror from properly crystallising.
The sinking itself is certainly a spectacle, and you can see where all
the money went, but it seems that the whole thing is just too big for
Cameron to really enjoy himself with.  He isn't directing so much as
orchestrating, and even though he's tipped to win an Oscar for TITANIC
it's annoying that it doesn't have the same flair of his other films. 
A lot of TITANIC isn't original, and the ending, which has been a
staple of sentimental finales since the silent days of THE THREE
MUSKETEERS, is terribly cliched.  But TITANIC is still well worth your
time.  For three hours running time it has a terrific sense of pace,
and there is at least one moment that captures the essence of the
disaster perfectly: the camera switches its viewpoint to that of the
survivors in the lifeboats, watching the now nearly-vertical Titanic
from afar with incredulous horror.  By itself, this moment would be
nothing.  But placed as it is, amid an ocean of 194 minutes of film,
those few seconds become the only connection Cameron needs to make. 
It works because it taps into the one level on which we moviegoers can
truly empathise: not as participants in a tragedy, but rather as
observers of that tragedy.

Title
Review for eXistenZ (1999)
David Cronenberg's latest biotechnical carny show aims its sights squarely 
at Internet addicts and video-game junkies.  While the idea of people so 
dissociated from reality that they spend all their 'quality time' within an 
artificial environment has rapidly become overworked, Cronenberg still 
manages to come up with something that looks new.  Jennifer Jason Leigh 
plays a designer of ultra-sophisiticated virtual reality games (virtual 
actuality??), worshiped by players everywhere as if she were Lana Croft 
incarnate.  But you can't be this good at something and not expect to draw 
attention, so Leigh finds herself fleeing industrial assassins and 'reality 
activists' intent on sabotaging her latest multi-million dollar project.  
She and fellow fugitive Jude Law hardwire  themselves into the alternate 
universe of this game - 'eXistenZ' - as part of a routine diagnostic.  Soon 
they find more than they bargained for:  they discover  another new and 
sophisticated game within eXistenZ which, as players, they must once again 
plug themselves into, and....you get the picture.  By this time, walls of 
reality have truly dissolved.
The opening of eXistenZ indicates a computer-game version of Cronenberg's 
VIDEODROME - as a director he is well-known for his provocative recurring 
themes (mutation, the bonding of flesh and technology, surgery, hospitals, 
bodies in revolt) and it initially appears that we're about to get a more 
considered reworking of his earlier films.  It's the same, but different: 
firstly, the cyberspace setting is new territory for Cronenberg, but 
secondly (and more noticeably) his approach is considerably lighter.  
eXistenZ is the funniest thing he has ever put on screen - I would have 
never expected to see an audience having such an openly good time with a one 
of his films until now!  Of course, the humor of eXistenZ is pretty skewed - 
those familiar with the director's work will realize that they're laughing 
at the same gooey, organic gross-outs that he used to unsettle everyone with 
in his other movies.  One man buys a copy of a you-be-the-victim car 
accident game and we're instantly reminded of the director's previous CRASH, 
and the furore about the violent automobile games released in its wake.  
Even the cry "Death to enemies of reality" seems to be a lampoon of previous 
rantings about 'the new flesh' .  And if the line "Trust no one!", delivered 
in all seriousness, isn't a poke at the X-FILES, I don't know what is.  Even 
Leigh and Law try to loosen up and enjoy the game, even though Law figures 
there is something sick and wrong about it all (for this is Cronenberg 
country, after all, and cyberspace is not a spotless, computer-generated 
playing platform but a decayed, visceral fug).
And then of course there's all that sex, even though the characters never 
actually get down to having any.  eXistenZ oozes sex continuously, with one 
hilarious metaphor after another thrown up on screen with abandon.  Given 
Cronenberg's past history of equating sex with disease and death, this film 
must surely be seen as a kind of personal liberation.

Review for Lolita (1997)
I did not really want to like this film.  In a display of petulance 
befitting its title character, I spent the best part of two years rehearsing 
my gripe about how Adrian Lyne deserved to fail spectacularly for having the 
chutzpah to tamper with such a classic.  It wasn't just me.  It seemed 
everyone had a bone to pick with LOLITA - its long-delayed and highly 
publicized search for a distributor was ample proof of that.  There were the 
Nabokovians who didn't want to see their beloved classic - which rated #4 on 
1998's 100-Best-Books-of-the-Century list - fall into the hands of the 
director responsible for such pop-sleaze as 9 1/2 WEEKS, FATAL ATTRACTION, 
and INDECENT PROPOSAL.  There were the usual lobbyists who objected to the 
film's subject matter presumably on the pretext that it would somehow 
endorse underage sexual activity (this argument is true inasmuch as cartoons 
promote the wilful dropping of pianos onto pedestrians).  And then there was 
a smaller arena of controversy - for all I know, I was the only person in 
it, which reads as thus:  I just didn't like the thought of someone 
monkeying around with a story that had already been established as a film 
classic by Stanley Kubrick.  For years we've always thought of Kubrick's 
LOLITA as the one, the only, definitive film version, shot in tasteful black 
and white, boasting sharp performances by James Mason and Peter Sellers, and 
forever fixing in our minds the image of a B/W Sue Lyon and her heart-shaped 
sunglasses as the novel's heroine.
And then along comes Lyne.  I remember feeling furious when I first read of 
his intentions for a remake.  But maybe it's just as well that there has 
been a two-year hiatus as a cooling-off period, because by the time of 
viewing I was ready to accept Lyne's LOLITA as an alternative, not a 
replacement.  And here's the news, which surprises me more than anyone - I 
saw LOLITA and loved it.
Sticking faithfully to the text and events of the book (although Lolita is a 
couple of years older in the film, one concession Lyne felt obliged to make 
to take off some of the heat), LOLITA is a sumptuous, mesmerizing piece of 
work.  I can't think of anything else quite like it, although Visconti 
springs clearly to mind in the opening scenes.  Unlike Kubrick's cool, black 
comedy, Lyne's LOLITA displays a much broader emotional tapestry - with 
remarkable ease he moves between scenes of drama, humor, eroticism, and 
romance.  The storyline parallels Kubrick's version closely, reminding us 
that the 1962 film probably wasn't as much of a departure from the book as 
it first seemed: Humbert Humbert (Jeremy Irons) falls in love with 14-year 
old Lolita (newcomer Dominique Swain) and marries her mother (Melanie 
Griffith) just to be near her.  A few weeks after the marriage, he becomes a 
widower and finds he has 'Lo' all to himself.
The performances Lyne draws from Irons and Swain are arresting - these two 
have more intense screen time together than any other recent couple that 
springs to mind, and sparks are always flying.  Right from the tortured 
timbre of Iron's opening narration it's plain to see that this is a tale of 
the heart.  It's interesting because the romance is purely on Humbert's 
behalf (the film's prologue does well to establish his motivation as the 
pursuit of an ideal rather than lust-driven obsession), and even when Lolita 
draws her role in the story to a close with the unconsciously cruel remark 
about "the only man I was ever crazy about" (which he knows isn't him) he 
finds himself evermore besotted with her.  Nowhere in this story does either 
one of them say that they love one another - instead, all we hear is is the 
refrain "I'm sorry".
The on-screen relationship between Swain and Irons was always going to be 
Lyne's most difficult task, but he pulls it off well.  The obvious tack is 
to make Humbert the innocent one and Lolita the manipulator, but this is 
just as liable to elicit charges of unfair sexual politicking: that young 
teens are being grossly misrepresented as knowing carnal creatures.  
Instead, Lyne shows us how gauche Lolita is - the kind of thing that would 
be anti-erotic to anyone but idealistically-blinded Humbert.  Swain moves 
everywhere with lanky, lumpy gestures; she sprawls over furniture, chews 
gum, fidgets, sneers at her mother, thinks only of herself and depends on 
two favored expressions - sleepy and sassy. She is indifferent, a behavior 
that Humbert confuses with a power he believes inherent to all nymphets, yet 
far from naive - she for one has not mistaken their escapade for some wildly 
romantic journey.  If Nabokov's book is a portrait of the hedonistic 
bubblegum heart of America then Swain's Lolita ably incarnates his themes, 
and Irons' Humbert is suitably by turns amused, irritated, and bewildered.
Looking at the thoughtful and detailed work that Lyne has done with LOLITA 
it is easy to believe that this is his best film - certainly since his debut 
FOXES which in itself was not without Lolitaesque colorings.  He is able to 
include head-and-shoulder-only lovemaking scenes between Swain and Irons 
without making it offensive (at the point that Humbert is ready to 
acknowledge that their relationship would be seen as nothing more than the 
corruption of a minor, Swain interrupts and diverts him with the facetious 
remark "the word is incest").  It isn't sordid or exploitative, and while it 
may be romantic, and even arousing, it is held in check by a sense of 
mistrust.  Ennio Morricone's lush score and  Howard Atherton's beautiful, 
drowsy cinematography wrap LOLITA in a doomed wistfulness.  It's a good 
example of how human emotion can really be amplified in a cinema with the 
right use of images and sound.
It's a shame that LOLITA had such a troubled history.  I even feel guilty 
myself for doubting that it could have been anything other than an attempt 
to cash in on a controversial title.  And yet here I am, ready to move 
Kubrick's version to one side of the pedestal to make room for another.  As 
Lolita herself might have said, who woulda thunk it?

Review for Molly Maguires, The (1970)
     Molly Maguire was a peasant girl in 17th century Ireland, who
supposedly led an uprising against rent collectors.  But this film is
set in 1876, where we find Detective James McParlane (Richard Harris)
being sent to a Pennsylvania mining community, largely composed of
Irish immigrants, in order to infiltrate a secret society known as the
Hibernians.  He knows that within the society is an elite band of
activists, who have called themselves the Molly Maguires, intent on
sabotaging the mines in order to force the owners to upgrade their
working and living conditions.
     You'll be nudged one way and pushed the rest throughout much of
this film, as it is difficult to know who to sympathize with.  We never
really "experience" the terrible work conditions or poverty that the
Maguires are fighting against.  The closest we come to this is during
one scene at a wake, where an elderly miner's life looks to have been
wasted after 42 years in the mines.  But by and large, the community
doesn't appear too badly off (although they could do with a decent
football field).  On the other hand, it's difficult to stick up for
Harris' character because of the deceitful maneuvers and outright lying
he does to get the trust of the Maguires' leader.  Furthermore, both
the Maguires and the peelers (the local constabulary) use murder as a
means of getting their point across.  And just to confound things, the
protagonists are played by charismatic actors (Harris and Sean
Connery), which we would like to see both win.  Is there any chance
they will team up by the film's end?
     The most interesting element of the film is probably at what point
viewers will decide which side deserves their sympathy.   The deciding
factor may be that Harris is motivated only for his own ends while
Connery's actions are more political and altruistic.  What unites both
is that their motivations are the same--to find a better way of living
than is offered by the mines.  Story walks an intriguing tightrope.
You'll find yourself hoping that Harris' coolly-played ruse doesn't get
discovered.  But then, everyone else seems to be plotting too--the
community, innocous on the surface, harbors another community that is
literally underground.  Even the building interiors are lit as if they
were mines.  Both Harris and Connery play their roles wonderfully,
though Samantha Eggar, who shares above-title billing with them, seems
included only to provide Harris with an excuse to reveal his thoughts.
Direction by Martin Ritt is effectively unobtrusive, complemented by
Henry Mancini's wistful, folk-influenced score.

Title
Review for Siddhartha (1973)
This adaptation of Herman Hesse's novel was obviously a personal project 
for producer-director-screenwriter Conrad Rook.  Those who have embraced 
the book should be relieved that it was placed in good hands.  Simple 
tale recounts the life of young Brahmin Siddhartha who leaves his 
village to become a sadhu (a wandering holy man who lives on the charity 
of others) in order to achieve enlightenment.  Story appeals because it 
brings large philosophical ideas down to a basic human level that we are 
able to relate to.  Siddharta's journey takes him from Brahmin to 
ascetic to lover to laborer to father.  He undergoes a spiritual rebirth 
with each new step, until he becomes his own teacher.  What is most 
interesting about this film is that we never feel in any position to 
judge Siddhartha as he shifts from one lifestyle to another - we simply 
accept it as part of a learning curve he must put himself through.  
This, of course, is what Hesse is propounding all along.  But there is 
certainly no cause for us to feel smug: Siddhartha voices his thoughts 
and revelations so eloquently that we are always respectful of him (I 
particularly like his speech at the end of the film about the stone).  
Even though the characters sum up enlightenment in a few words 
("Everything returns"; "I can think, I can wait, I can fast"), it 
doesn't come across as axiomatic or trite: these simple expressions 
reassure us that such discoveries are not exclusive to holy men. 
Rook uses images (gorgeously photographed by Sven Nykvist in Northern 
India) and music to bring the book to life without sacrificing any of 
its gentleness.  The dialogue, as spoken by Shashi Kapoor (as Siddharta) 
and his companions, has a gentle rhythm of its own.  Even the name 
'Siddharta' alone is pronounced with a relaxing, peaceful lilt.  It's 
almost as if Rook knows just how far to go before making his audience 
nod off into sleep. Hesse's slim novel translates to the screen more 
comfortably than his other voyage-of-discovery story STEPPENWOLF.


Title
Review for WADD: The Life and Times of John C. Holmes (1998)
WADD: The Life and Times of John C. Holmes (1998) 110m.
Commendably objective documentary takes a frank look at the turbulent life 
of 70s-80s porn star John Holmes.  The film-makers obviously figured that 
this subject matter alone was going to earn their movie an R rating so they 
allow their interview subjects free rein on opinions and reminiscences - 
this doco has the highest frequency  for 'penis' synonyms in the first ten 
minutes than any other film you will have seen.  It's only to be expected: 
Holmes' claim to fame was 13 inches of talent (32.5 cm if you prefer 
metric), a fact that director Cass Paley recognizes as this movie's selling 
point.  The audience gets what it pays for (although the famous member 
itself is only glimpsed) with much made of the fact that Holmes was born for 
porn, but this is merely a starting point - there's a lot more than sex 
going on in this story.
Holmes' odyssey leads him from a hard upbringing in Ohio, a stint in the 
signal corps, and marriage in California.  After an introduction to the LA 
pornography market and the invention of private dick 'Johnny Wadd' (the 
script was written on the back of an envelope!), his career path is assured, 
and the rest should be simple.  Holmes has a fatal flaw, however: he is a 
pathological liar, whose endless evasions and fabrications become so 
habitual that he begins to experience some sort of slippage.  After being 
busted on pimping charges (along with others stuck with "conspiracy to 
commit oral copulation"), Holmes turns informant for the LAPD vice squad - 
effectively he is living out his own porn-detective alter ego.  He graduates 
from smoking joints to freebasing cocaine, blurring lines of reality even 
further.  By the time he's stealing cars while on the run from the FBI, the 
cops, AND the mob, Holmes' separation from everything and everyone in his 
life has become complete.  WADD is terribly confusing: no other documentary 
has been so replete with contradiction.  The most common adjectives used by 
interviewees to describe Holmes are 'gentle' and 'sweet' - yet this is the 
same man who caused the horrific murders of four people and wantonly 
continued having sex with women without informing them that he was HIV 
positive. Nearly everyone gushes about what a great guy he was, but who's 
kidding who?  By the end of the film you won't trust what anyone has to say 
except for his second wife who has at least suffered enough physically to 
make her testimony believable.  Just to bring everything full circle, 
Holmes' third wife (and porn star) Misty Dawn sued the film-makers a year 
after WADD's release for slander and "reckless disregard for the truth".
Much more than just a documentary on a titillating subject, WADD is equal 
doses of humor, poignancy, horror and fascination.  Many lines are quotable, 
but not subject for repetition in most review columns and as the star player 
is Holmes himself, several innocent sentences take on amusing innuendoes - 
my favorite is when his first wife talks of his carpentry skills, claiming 
he 'could make anything with wood'.   Among those interviewed: Ron Jeremy, 
Gloria Leonard, Kitten Natividad and Misty Dawn a.k.a. Laurie Holmes, who 
now maintains the official John Holmes website.  Film also includes 
non-explicit clips from various Holmes movies, including the Johnny Wadd 
series.  Musical score of documentary is suitably cheesy and could be 
recycled in spots as background for any real porno movie.


Title
Review for White Dog (1982)
When Julia Sawyer (Kristy McNichol) adopts a stray arctic-white German
shepherd she has no idea that it is a trained attack dog.  Worse, it
has been trained to attack - and kill - anyone with black skin. 
Examination of racial prejudice by uncompromising director Sam Fuller
sat on the shelf at Paramount for ten years because it was considered
too racially sensitive for general release and was not shown in U.S.
cinemas until it received retrospective festival screenings.  It's a
shame, because in WHITE DOG Fuller is able to relocate his familiar
themes of discrimination and combat into a more intimate and
recognizable setting - the transformation of a living being into a
killing machine is just as vivid here as in any of his numerous war
movies.  Film's key line comes, appropriately enough, from Keys (Paul
Winfield), the black animal trainer bent on rehabilitating the dog,
when he says "Dogs see only in black and white".  He is of course
speaking metaphorically for the narrow perspectives of the all
humanity.  While McNichol is sickened and wants the animal destroyed,
Winfield instead makes it his mission to reform it, as if he is not
just curing one dog, but triumphing over the unreasoning animal nature
of all men (or the bigoted ones, at least).  He in effect turns the
dog into *his* metaphor.  Fuller perpetuates this in one attack scene
with a shot of a stained glass window depicting St Francis (though he
looks more like Christ) standing over a white dog while we hear the
sounds of McNichol's dog savaging a black man to death out of frame. 
It's a cynical, distressing moment that is creepily identical to the
pseudo-religious `white is right' doctrine of the Ku Klux Klan.
The use of a dog as the villain is problematical because we are kept
aware throughout the story that it is not acting of its own free will.
 We feel the same ambivalence towards it as the other characters, but
by the picture's end you'll feel sorry for the dog, who is in obvious
mental torment, and angry at irresponsible owners who make this sort
of behavior happen.  The dog itself is fearsomely convincing.  Its
human co-stars, Winfield and Burl Ives, are well suited to their
roles, but it's McNichol who gives the most appealing performance. 
Fuller makes the most of her vulnerable-yet-determined looks by
shooting her frequently in close-up.  There's irony in her role as a
woman putting her pet through extensive therapy when we remember that
shortly after this film she herself suffered years of
(well-publicized) anxiety attacks.  Fuller and fellow director Curtis
Hanson wrote the screenplay, based on a story by Romain Gary.  Ennio
Morricone provided the superb, rather poetic score.

Title
Review for Akira (1988)
The mother of all manga (Japanese animation) films.  If you don't like
this sampling of the genre, then quit now - there aren't many that
come better, or at least bigger, than this.  AKIRA is the manga that
all others, for better or worse, are measured by (its popularity in
the West has helped this enormously).  As with others of its type, the
plot of AKIRA - which I won't even try to capsulize here - is
secondary to the visual action. Story is set 30 years after World War
III, which nominally makes it science fiction, and its convincing
portrayal of a high-gloss dystopia (a mix of BLADE RUNNER and
CLOCKWORK ORANGE) does stamp a strong SF feel onto the first half
hour.  Eventually this gives way to the personal torment and wholesale
destruction conventional of manga, and the SF element is consumed by
the quasi-religious ascension that appears to be the only logical
'out' that films of this type can conclude with.
At the time of production AKIRA was the most expensive animated film
produced in Japan, and it may well still hold that record.  It was
obviously a labor of love for writer/co-director Katsuhiro Otomo, who
also wrote the graphic novels on which it was based.  His meticulous
attention to detail (especially noteworthy are the finely-rendered
backgrounds and enormous palette of colors) shows that he approached
the task of animating his book as if he were making it as a
live-action film - the drawings were so finely rendered that frames
were drawn for 70mm film.  He also departed from the conventional
techniques of other Japanese studios by pre-recording the dialogue
before animating the characters.  Otomo and animation director Takashi
Nakamura use such 'live' camera techniques as slow motion,
focus-pulling, dollying, and tracking; infuse the soundtrack with a
rich variety of background/foreground noise; and revel in simulating
the effects of smoke, water, fire, wind, and speed.  Most impressive
is the way light sources (and their resulting shadows) are used,
especially when they 'flare' into the lens.  In fact, it's almost too
much of a good thing.  AKIRA is so consistently brilliant in its
execution that it's hard to keep appreciating just how good it is. 
There are the inevitable dull spots - it's over two hours, after all -
and some of the action sequences are never-ending, but it does manage
to pull through at the end to deliver a huge-scale climax.  If the
finale doesn't seem as impressive as the opening ten minutes (which,
like the rest of the film, deserve to be seen on the big screen for
real impact) its only because we've seen enough of it already.
I like AKIRA more than other films of its ilk (see ten minutes of
LEGEND OF THE OVERFIEND and you've seen the whole movie) but it's
distracting to see the characters speaking in American accents, and it
gets on my nerves hearing the characters screaming each others names
continuously.  There are also too many lantern-jawed Pekingese-nosed
he-men running around for my liking. Scenes of mass
destruction/carnage aren't as disturbing as the moments of more
personal one-on-one violence (we've seen Tokyo trashed on film too
many times to get upset about it now), which makes it distinctly
unsuitable for children.  Not that they'd be able to keep up with the
plot anyway, but then again, who can?  This also may be the only
cartoon with product placement - unless a new trend now catches on.

Title
Review for Road to Wellville, The (1994)
One-of-a-kind comedy by Alan Parker.  It boasts Anthony Hopkins at his 
most eccentric and appears to be an attempt to redefine the screen 
presentation of toilet humor - because nearly every moment of the story 
is devoted to a body function or orifice.  Story is set at the turn of 
the century, when the popularity of Dr John Kellogg's new breakfast 
food, corn flakes, was part of a society fad for health and fitness.  
Two storylines look at both sides of the craze - the main one has 
Matthew Broderick, who has chronic indigestion, checking into Kellogg's 
sanitarium with wife Bridget Fonda.  The second story follows attempts 
of John Cusack and Michael Lerner to break into the lucrative 
health-food market.  We take our morning cereal so much for granted that 
we don't think twice about the impact that the novelty of 'breakfast 
food' might have had on its first appearance.  Although he doesn't state 
it as such, Parker uses this idea to lampoon similar health crazes of 
contemporary times - the Victorian sensibility of going through personal 
suffering for a cleaner mind and body doesn't seem too far removed from 
the high-tech torture equipment of your local gym.  
Delivering one hilarious organic metaphor after another, Hopkins makes 
for a spirited Kellogg.  Every one of his scenes is a delight, 
especially those in which he confronts his rebellious, filthy son Dana 
Carvey - easily the biggest flake he was ever responsible for.  The 
flashback scenes to their early family life are highlights.  Kellogg's 
clinic puts every idea into practice - colonic irrigation, 
vegetarianism, aerobics, dietary restriction, mineral baths, surgery, 
and sexual abstinence.  As if that isn't enough, some of the female 
clients opt to undergo a highly suspect 'therapeutic massage' by a 
neighboring German physician.  Film is consistently entertaining, but 
nevertheless overlong.  It wouldn't have made much difference if the 
Cusack sub-plot had been cut entirely.  As with most comedies, this one 
is an acquired taste.  You may have to chew it over 23 times before 
swallowing.


Title
Review for What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966)
Early experiment by Woody Allen laid the groundwork for MYSTERY SCIENCE 
THEATER 3000 and the improvised soundtrack dubbings on the UK TV series 
WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY? -  consequently it doesn't appear nearly so unique 
nowadays.  We've probably all talked over the top of a movie on TV and added 
our own soundtrack or commentary (a group of friends and I managed to invent 
a most amusing pornographic narrative for BATTLESTAR GALACTICA one time), 
but Allen realizes the idea wholly.  By taking a serious Japanese thriller, 
KAGI NO KAG, and re-editing it with new, irrelevant comic dialogue, Allen 
invented a new way of getting a product into cinemas with relatively little 
expense.  If WHAT'S UP, TIGER LILY? (titled to cash in on the previous 
year's WHAT'S NEW, PUSSYCAT?) helped get his future projects off the ground, 
then its addition to the Allen oeuvre is more than justified.  Fortunately, 
it has the distinction of also being very funny.
Consider the way Allen was to approach his task:  he obviously had to keep a 
cohesive narrative throughout his film without sacrificing humor to 
exposition.  To this end, he employs a motif - a recipe for egg salad - that 
becomes the justification of all that happens in the film.  Having set up a 
running gag, the jokes in TIGER LILY then take on two forms - they either 
bear some relevance to the events happening onscreen, or they are totally 
off-the-wall (e.g. one early exchange has a young half-dressed beauty 
approach the film's hero, only to deliver the line "Name three presidents" 
).  It's the latter humor that is most characteristic of the Woody Allen we 
know from magazine articles, where his wild, offbeat lines are truly 
hilarious.  Perhaps TIGER LILY is most reflective of this writing style 
because, like a magazine piece, it allows Allen distance from the project - 
he appears not as an actor (or even voice) but as an observer.  It's a 
curious attitude, because after this project Allen's films were to become 
more and more intertwined with his life and persona.  Watching TIGER LILY 
today, one can't help think of his self-critiquing STARDUST MEMORIES, in 
which characters complain that he is no longer interested in making the 
"early funny stuff".  I hope Allen does not disown this film, as so many 
maturing artists do of their fledging work - it may lack the sophistication 
of his later films, but there is still "funny stuff" at hand here (I find 
the 'Hollywood impressions' sequence hysterical).  It's surprising how well 
the absurd dialogue actually synchs up with the actors in the original film! 
  Some filler is provided with Inserts of 60s group The Lovin' Spoonful - 
they don't add anything to the story.

Title
Review for Knightriders (1981)
Not the feature version of that TV show about the crime-fighter and his 
talking car, although it does sound just as silly in summary: A performance 
troupe in modern-day America motorcycles from town to town in full mediaeval 
regalia and stages combat with each other.  This would be an odd choice for 
any director, but is certainly out of character for George A. Romero, who 
until this point was known only for his popular (though heavily cult-bound) 
horror films.  I guess because it is so out of character that we have to 
assume that this was a personal project of the director's - the film he 
always 'wanted' to make.
Ed Harris is the self-appointed king of the motorcyclists, but there is a 
pretender to the throne (Romero's favorite makeup artist Tom Savini, who 
really looks the part as Morgan) who has more progressive ideas for the 
troupe.  The twist is that the microcosm - or microkingdom - of the 
traveling players is unconsciously playing out the last days of Camelot, 
chivalry, and the whole Arthurian mythos.  Harris is a throwback to an 
outmoded (and erroneous) notion of knights in shining armor - much like the 
legendary Arthur his world is overtaken by science (technology/machines) and 
reason (commerce/business).  His romantic milieu is breaking down, and its 
conflicts are plain to see - half of the troupe is named after tales of 
Arthur and Robin Hood while the other half is nondescript and ordinary; his 
minstrels are drowned out by disco music; dangerous weapons are 
indistinguishable from props; one half of his men must replay battles 
against the other, again and again; and of course his knights ride 
motorcycles instead of horses.  I have the feeling that this latter point 
was the main inspiration behind Romero's film (it dominated the film's 
advertising) and that the paradoxical image of knights jousting on 
motorcycles was of more interest to him that any desire to rework mediaeval 
mythology.  Unfortunately, it's only when Romero is aware of what he's up to 
that the film has its clunkiest moments - Harris' dialogue may be in keeping 
with his character, but if that's so, then his character isn't inspiring, 
just drippy (his scenes with Merlin, for example).  In fact any scenes where 
the characters address each other as 'my liege' or 'my king', or act as if 
they are bound to their artificial world are the ones that are least 
effective - whenever there's a conflict or confrontation we wonder whether 
it's based on personal issues or some wider concept inherited from the roles 
they have collectively locked themselves into.  By the end we're ready to 
believe Harris should step down as king only because he's been playing the 
role too long and should just get back in step with the times.
Issues like these are not the heart of KNIGHTRIDERS, however, and the 
drawcard for many theatregoers in 1981 would have been the expertly handled 
action sequences - it didn't hurt that these would have cashed in on the MAD 
MAX films that were also around at the time.  Abrupt conclusion to film 
pretty much denies all the naiveté that underpins its central idea.  An 
unusual  assortment of music helps this look like a product of the 
mid-seventies.  Actually, it could also be read as a palimpsest about the 
end of the 1960s, under the more obvious Arthurian analogy - these guys come 
across more as burnt-out hippies than historical role-players.  Watch for 
horror writer (and friend of Romero's) Stephen King in a cameo as a 
spectator.

Review for Dark City (1998)
I'm reluctant to put my thoughts of this film into writing.  My 
immediate impression of DARK CITY after viewing it is.well, an 
immediate impression.  It works like a dream: you dream something, you 
wake up with it vividly in your memory, a couple of hours later you 
remember its non-submersible images or emotions, a couple of days later 
its impact is almost completely gone.  Right now it has been three hours 
since I watched DARK CITY, and already its hypnopompic residue is 
settling somewhere in a dark, limbic city of my own.  That's fine by me.  
I don't want to go poking around in there just for the sake of analysis.
But it's safe enough to recount the fundamentals: This is 
writer-director Alex Proyas' followup to THE CROW (which in itself could 
have been titled DARK CITY).  Its most striking feature, like its 
predecessor, is its sepulchral photography, although DARK CITY may be 
even darker (but at least without all that rain): it seems that every 
wall is painted black or grey, every shadow overwhelms the light sources 
within the frame, every character is etched in chiaroscuro.  It's not 
just a noir gimmick.  Like the startling visual effects, the look of the 
film is entirely in service with its storyline: the titular city is part 
machine, part terrarium, part psychoid unconscious.  It's as Jung would 
have dreamed it himself - a place where the basic stories of our world 
might begin with a singular creative experience.
The city's governorship is in the hands of powerful beings known only as 
The Strangers (imagine a costume party where everyone shows up as 
Nosferatu and you'll get the basic idea), who impose mandatory 
hibernation periods upon its human residents.  It's when one of the 
citizens (Rufus Sewell) remains awake that the film begins.  Thenceforth 
a lot of strange stuff happens in DARK CITY, and Proyas stretches out 
the intrigue for just the right length.  Its arresting visuals and 
thundering soundtrack - this film must be heard in a cinema, not just 
seen in one - drive its narrative at a compelling pace, although the 
purely cinematic sensibility of it all makes Sewell and the other actors 
hardly memorable; only Keifer Sutherland's mannered performance stands 
out afterwards, for better or worse. 
The most noticeable thing about DARK CITY is that it makes perfect sense 
as an experience, but not as a story.  Here we have an alien gestalt 
capable of manifesting its consciousness; for all intents and purposes 
they appear invulnerable.  Yet they may be felled by a blow to the head 
just as easily as any of the humans in their charge.  As a friend of 
mine remarked, if the aliens had this kind of power then why didn't they 
arm themselves with psychically-generated rocket launchers instead of 
their less effective psychically-generated knives?  It's a fair point, 
and one which in turn leads to many other questions about the 
screenplay.  But it would do just as well to question why, in a dream, 
you see yourself flattened under a truck loaded with baked beans only to 
be relocated in front of a classroom of talking raccoons a split second 
later (this may be a stupid example, but at least it's a real dream).  
Putting it plainly, to question the logic of this film is simply 
unsporting.  Pick at one loose thread and you'll find that the story's 
entire fabric is made entirely of the same.  Nevertheless, Proyas makes 
the bold choice of establishing the feel of a 1940s detective movie, 
thus providing us with characters that are investigating his project's 
own meaning.  Admirable, when you realize it would have been a lot 
simpler for him to take a leaf out of David Lynch's book and cite the 
illogicality of dreams as his nightmarish film's raison d'etre.  
When I was a kid I used to drive myself crazy thinking about the 
universe - how big it was, where it ended, if it ended, what it was in 
when it ended (a bubble, maybe?  If so, what was the bubble floating 
in?).  There were times when DARK CITY reminded me of that feeling.  
It's a metanarrative intrigue into those huge creative spaces: the 
fabrication of storylines and scenarios, the endless possibilities and 
invention of characters and their relationships.  We're outside looking 
in, but at the same time there's a sense that this film has come from 
somewhere within and is projecting itself out.  It's easy to backtrack 
and point out a film history from which DARK CITY may have emerged - its 
seething architecture is mindful of BRAZIL and BLADE RUNNER, its 
existential vogue is similar to early Lars von Trier or Jeunet and Caro, 
etc, etc - but this kind of cross-referencing can go on forever.  I've 
resisted temptation to draw parallels this time around.  Let's face it, 
the only necessary base for comparison is much more primal: namely, our 
own dark cities.  You know the ones.  Just like in the film, they're 
torn down and rebuilt every night in our sleep.

Review for City of Hope (1991)
Mosaic by John Sayles is reflective of his versatility by virtue of
its multifarious nature.  Sayles, a writer-director-actor-editor,
makes pains to experiment with as wide a genre and mood available to
him in the landscape of commercial cinema.  At first glance, CITY OF
HOPE might seem his most 'ordinary': a story of the effect of corrupt
politics and business on different socio-economic levels. 
Straightforward enough, but Sayles wants to provide as broad a
spectrum as possible into his two-hour running time, so his constantly
mobile camera drifts in and out of the lives of a huge cast of
characters.  Some provide subplots that rhizomically link together;
some nudge each other in passing; yet others function only as
incidental bystanders.  It's a great dance that Sayles choreographs -
he obviously finds enjoyment in the immeasurable ways in which people
affect each others' lives.  CITY OF HOPE has obvious parallels with
Robert Altman efforts like NASHVILLE and SHORT CUTS, but Sayles'
approach touches base on a more human level.  His characters are for
the most part plain speaking and down to earth, and get an equal
amount of screen time (Vincent Spano has a little more than the rest
of the thirty-plus cast, giving him the film's nominal lead role).
It seems an obvious idea to tell the story of a city by using a
plenitude of voices instead of a sole representative one, but there
aren't many films like this one around.  Sayles shows us that it is
this chorus that unites to provide the one voice of the city itself . 
In CITY OF HOPE the people take center stage: the city has no name;
its streets are simply named after letters of the alphabet; we never
see an establishing shot of the city; much of the story is filmed at
street level (when we do see a view out of a high-rise, it's only of
the building opposite); the characters all work in service of the city
to keep its various mechanisms in running order.  When Spano quits his
construction job in the film's opening scene, he is setting himself up
for a fall: without any useful function for the city he automatically
becomes expendable - he fails to emulate the example of several other
characters who want to be recognized as separate identities in their
community (Sayles has everyone use each other's first name
repeatedly).  It's hard to tell if this is a city of hope or a city of
hopelessness - because of its unfixity it best serves as allegory. 
Like the building left unfinished halfway through the story, the
separate storylines remain largely unresolved.  Sayles gets away with
this by treating them in such a fragmentary manner that we don't
really expect all the loose ends to tie up anyhow.  Film's last shot
is inspired - it may linger in your memory for days afterwards.

Title
Review for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)
I'm going to break a rule with this one.  I'm going to use personal 
pronouns.  Look, there's two already.  In discussing this film I'm going to 
drop the mantle of 'reviewer' or 'critic' and reveal myself for all I really 
am: a guy who loves going to the movies.  And it all started here.  I was 
introduced to Stanley Kubrick's landmark of science-fiction cinema at the 
age of 14 by a friend and immediately saw it a second time with two other 
friends in tow.  Thus was established the pattern: no matter where or when I 
saw it, I would take an uninitiated companion along for the ride, the better 
that I might vicariously relive my own first-time viewing.  I have seen 2001 
in 70mm on a Cinerama screen; I have seen it in a lecture theater in high 
school (and then by request of the teacher delivered a lesson about it to my 
16-year old peers); I have seen it double-billed with BARBARELLA, of all 
things; I have seen it with the original overture and intermission in a 
small Australian cinema with no air-conditioning; I have seen it on a hill 
in the middle of nowhere as part of a three-day rock festival, projected on 
a big screen against a backdrop of real stars at 2 in the morning.
But I have never, never seen it on video.  Because if there was one thing 
that 2001 taught me about films, for which I am eternally grateful, it is 
that no matter how sophisticated a home entertainment center may be, there 
is simply no substitute for the cinema experience.  2001 should not be seen 
in a theater merely as some kind of preferable alternative to video, because 
it is not a film that is 'watched' so much as it is 'experienced' (my usual 
remark to friends immediately after the end credits is "So: can you imagine 
seeing *that* on television?" ).
Why did I take so long to review this, my favorite of all films?  In truth, 
there is little to say that is new, and I can't imagine that I would have 
anything further to contribute to the many books, articles and critical 
papers that have been devoted to analysis and appreciation of 2001.  Every 
angle has been explored and exhausted, leaving only the most desperately 
ridiculous of extrapolations untouched.  It's unimaginative of me to fall 
back on a schtick as obvious as reviewing the film in the year it was set 
but at this late stage it's the only window of opportunity I have, and I'm 
not going to let it pass me by.  Rather than rehash the film's plot, themes 
or interpretation I have decided to provide observations, each paragraphed 
separately, on what I feel makes the film either a different or similar 
experience to its first appearance 33 years ago:
FORECASTING:  It was obviously a bold move in 1968 to predict giant space 
stations and passenger spacecraft, none of which have come true in the 
dimensions that the film presents them (although 2001 was the year that saw 
the first civilian paying for a trip into space and the retirement of the 
Mir space station) but ironically it is the smaller details that now appear 
the most dated.  For example, there is no longer any Bell Telephone Company; 
BBC television has not expanded to the extent that it has 12 channels; a 
telephone call from space would certainly not cost a paltry $1.75; and the 
suit worn by that photographer in the conference room is just plain awful 
(we didn't suddenly lose our fashion sense after the 20th century).  
However, it is the size of HAL, the supercomputer in charge of running the 
spaceship 'Discovery', that a number of viewers find the most dated element 
of the film.  I've never understood the basis of this criticism, though I 
imagine that our familiarity with microprocessors, PCs and laptops have 
convinced us that large computer databanks are obsolete.  I don't disagree 
with the fact that storage alone takes considerably less space in the actual 
year 2001, but a computer system the size of a room isn't entirely 
unbelievable - just look at the amount of hardware packed around a special 
effects studio, for instance.  To say nothing of the amount that might be 
required for an interplanetary space voyager.
CLICHES:  One thing that makes me nervous about going to 21st-century 
screenings of 2001 is the potentially risible reaction of audiences to 
scenes which have become so well-known that they have been imitated, paid 
homage to, and parodied beyond count.  I usually forewarn any friends seeing 
the film that they may think "Oh, not this corny music" within its opening 
ten seconds, but to also bear in mind that 2001 was the film that 
established this, and many other science-fiction film conventions, when it 
was first released.  I'm relieved that audiences are usually sophisticated 
enough nowadays to recognize 2001 as being the point of origin for many of 
these motifs (although it could be that, like me, they are mostly made of 
repeat viewers).  Elements of the film that have become a standard part of 
much SF cinema include its prologue set in prehistoric times, the 
presentation of an alien intelligence as a godlike being, the soft-spoken 
computer that can't be trusted, the trippy special effects blowout in the 
film's final act, and even the image of a large spaceship traveling across 
the frame of the film until we become awed at the size of it.
SILENCE:  2001 is just as visually astonishing as when it first appeared, 
but for a different reason.  Among a barrage of contemporary films which 
manage to look impressive through use of computer imagery, tricks, stunts, 
kinetic camerawork and wild editing, 2001 is possibly more unique now than 
back in 1968.  There is no other film that sustains so many diverse silent, 
or at least wordless passages throughout its running time.  In my 
experience, audiences too become silent which make the events on screen even 
more compelling or meditative.  It also portrays space in a way that I've 
never seen before or since (one critic of the time stated that 2001 wasn't 
about space travel, but *was* space travel).  More than any other SF film it 
presents space as a vacuum - a cold, vast, dark, silent, airless eternity.  
Seeing men reduced to tiny specks in their spacecraft, journeying beyond the 
comparative safety of the mothership, makes the universe appear a lonely and 
frightening place indeed.
SPECIAL EFFECTS:  The quality of 2001's effects - one of the primary reasons 
for its enormous cult - has not diminished any over the years.  I still 
consider Douglas Trumbull's innovative FX work superior to that of STAR 
WARS, released 9 years later.  It's interesting that while Kubrick was 
confident enough to burn all his props and blueprints (stating that his 
finished film was indeed the definitive final word on the matter), George 
Lucas felt the need to refine and update the visuals in his 'Star Wars' 
trilogy before delivering the newest film of the series in 1999.
ICONOGRAPHY:  Watching the film today there is almost a delight in 
recognizing or revisiting images that have become indelibly stamped into our 
cultural psyche.  To see HAL's red eye, Moonwatcher raising his bone aloft 
like a weapon, the giant space wheel spinning above the moon, the 
featureless black monolith, the distinctive designs of the space vehicles, 
the Star Child staring enigmatically at the Earth, the jump cut from the 
Dawn of Man to the Space Age, or the brilliant psychedelic colors of the 
journey through the Star Gate (you owe it to yourself to see the best 
quality print you can), is to witness truly classic moments in cinema.  
Watching it now is almost like witnessing some grand historical document in 
motion.
2001's appeal is not purely about the look of the film.  Its storyline, 
which abandons any notions of a central character, and has no time for 
contrived plot colorings such as romance or heroism, still remains unique; 
and because it is unique it still looks 'new'.  2001's matter-of-fact 
handling of its narrative, its audacious concept, precise delivery, 
multitude of themes, enquiring philosophy and Zen-like sensibility make this 
one of the masterpieces of cinema.  But you don't have to read my 
enthusiastic account on the film on to be convinced - a friend of mine 
summed it up more succinctly and just as effectively when we saw 2001: A 
SPACE ODYSSEY earlier in the week.  The end title appeared after two and a 
half hours of absorbed viewing, and I heard her first word.  "Wow!"

Review for Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures (2001)
Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures (2001) 142m
It was a shame that we had to wait for one of the cinema's greatest 
directors to die before we got this overview of his career, especially since 
this documentary reveals that Kubrick had intended to give some interviews 
to 'set the record straight' after completion of his last film, EYES WIDE 
SHUT.  Nevertheless, there should be enough in its two and a half hours to 
satisfy most movie buffs.  As it's directed by Kubrick's brother-in-law Jan 
Harlan, and features interviews with his sister, daughters and widow 
Christiane, it's reasonable to expect a personal account of Kubrick 'the 
man'.  Instead, the film sticks to its title and presents a chronology of 
his movies, revealing incidental information about Kubrick along the way.  
It adds up to a great homage - as well as a generous selection of clips 
(including his debut documentary DAY OF THE FIGHT), we are treated to rare 
home movies, behind-the-scenes footage and a huge cast list of famous faces 
talking about their association with the director.  The expected film-makers 
make appearances - Spielberg, Mazursky (who starred in FEAR AND DESIRE), and 
Scorsese (reiterating views about BARRY LYNDON from his presentation A 
PERSONAL JOURNEY THROUGH AMERICAN MOVIES) - alongside a few odd choices like 
Woody Allen and Alex Cox.  There's also a surprising contribution from 
composer Gyorgy Ligeti.  Sadly, many of the star players of Kubrick's 
earlier films are no longer with us, leaving Peter Ustinov (SPARTACUS) as 
the sole representative of the old guard.  It's hard not to be satisfied 
with the lineup that A LIFE IN PICTURES presents but it would have been 
interesting to have heard the impressions of  Sue Lyon and Danny Lloyd, the 
only two actors to work with Kubrick as youngsters.
As the chronology progresses the amount of screen time spent on the films 
increases - in effect because Kubrick's work is becoming more ambitious and 
there are more interview subjects at hand.  There is even time spent on 
films that Kubrick didn't get to make: NAPOLEON was pulled from production 
after the poor box-office showings of a rival film on the same subject, 
ARYAN PAPERS was pre-empted and defused a little by SCHINDLER'S LIST, and 
A.I. was eventually handed over to Spielberg after years of development.  
It's as near-complete a filmography (and non-filmography) as you could hope 
for, although Kubrick's ill-fated association with Marlon Brando's western 
ONE-EYED JACKS is noticeably absent.   It's interesting to see not only the 
processes and rationale involved in making each film, but also the public 
and critical reaction afterwards.  As the documentary points out, Kubrick 
became his own worst enemy by having to follow up each successive film with 
something even better.  By the time of BARRY LYNDON and THE SHINING, 
expectations were crushing the productions well before their premieres.  It 
was impossible for Kubrick to be innovative for every new film (which may 
explain the increasing gaps between each new project) but A LIFE IN PICTURES 
also reminds us that his work nevertheless remained unique, copying from no 
other cinema product before it; even a practise as basic as the use of 
established music can be traced back to his incorporation of Vera Lynn in DR 
STRANGELOVE and Strauss in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.
A LIFE IN PICTURES opens with a barrage of newspaper clippings that label 
Kubrick as obsessive and reclusive.  By the film's end there would seem 
little evidence that would suggest otherwise, although Harlan manages to 
create a connection to the warmer side of Kubrick's personality by keeping 
the documentary's tone engaging (the film clips also provide much of its 
humor).  Many anecdotes from Kubrick's family and friends are funny because 
of the popular image of the director as a perfectionist or control freak 
(e.g. one of his daughters produces a set of instructions about the family 
pets that is meticulous to say the least).  The home movies of Kubrick 
goofing around for the camera as a child (in 1940!)are priceless - it comes 
full circle when we see him filming his own children.  Fittingly, it's 
Christiane, who he fell in love with while directing her in PATHS OF GLORY, 
that gets the film's great final line.  A LIFE IN PICTURES is more than a 
homage; it's also a gift.

Title
Review for Our Mother's House (1967)
Not the sentimental family story you might expect - in fact, after
viewing this film you might think of the title as spookily possessive.
 Jack Clayton directs a cast of mostly children in this adaptation of
Julian Gloag's novel.  Film begins with the death of the children's
bedridden mother, an event that upsets them terribly, but unites them
in a common purpose: to keep the legacy of their mother's household
management alive.  
The idea of children fending for themselves in their homes without
parental supervision has been done before in everything from comedies
to horror movies, and while OUR MOTHER'S HOUSE isn't the last word on
the subject, it does have a satisfying wholeness about it.  Story
recognizes the need for authority in young, impressionable lives -
most interestingly, the children allow their dead mother to continue
managing their affairs by channeling her spirit through one of the
older sisters, effectively placing consequence out of their hands. 
This transference of authoritative power from the material to the
ethereal - between which the children make no distinction - might
indicate that the story has something to say about religion, but this
idea is put aside once the children's long-lost father (Dirk Bogarde)
appears on the scene.  If their mother represents (in their eyes) a
benign divinity, then their shiftless father becomes the devil
incarnate.  Only Elsa, the eldest sister, refuses to fall for his
charms.  Gradually, the discipline of the household begins to crumble.
 Bogarde introduces `sins' such as alcohol, adultery, gambling,
forgery, seduction, and deceit, but significantly it is only when he
challenges the children's own faith with doubt(read: heresy)that he
finally goes too far. 
Clayton handles the story intelligently, although he gets a little
melodramatic towards the end.  Somber mood of film is probably helped
by casting of Bogarde, whose characters always seem to end up dead in
most of his work.  Georges Delerue wrote the tender score.  Worth a
look, even if it is regarded as one of Clayton's weaker films.

Title
Review for Yellow Submarine (1968)
One-of-a-kind animated fantasy by the Beatles - well not exactly: they 
contributed the music, but the story and voice acting was done without their 
involvement.  The animated Fab Four are asked to help save Pepperland, a 
musical paradise, from occupation by the music-hating Blue Meanies.  It's a 
magical world, and so can be reached only by magical means, viz. the 
submarine of the title.  Consider the year of the production, the recently 
released 'Sgt Pepper' album's flirtation with the drug culture, and the 
basic concept of a dimension-traveling submarine, and you'll see why the 
"trip" takes up most of the story.  The submarine image dominates the film's 
psychedelic world so comfortably that you may forget that it was originally 
derived from a children's song.  The Beatles may have suspected this 
juvenile treatment for the cartoon early on, which explains why one of their 
songs written specifically for the movie was a children's chant ('All 
Together Now').  While it's great to see animated sequences to classic 
Beatle songs - like prototypical music video clips - it's the newer material 
that synthesizes best with the look that the film-makers were striving for.  
'Only A Northern Song' and 'It's All Too Much' point the way to SUBMARINE's 
potentially wilder side; and while the script throws in 'Lucy in the Sky 
with Diamonds' the rest of the Beatles extant catalogue just doesn't have 
the 'acid' sensibility to promote a complete head trip.
It's probably a good thing, however.  Nothing dates more badly than an era, 
and while YELLOW SUBMARINE is recognizably the product of the late 60s it is 
not dependent on it.  There are the prerequisite acknowledgements to 
flowers, butterflies, and love but this is saturated with so much visual 
innovation and wall-to-wall puns that the entire film could just as easily 
be a contemporary construct paying a postmodern homage to the era (in fact 
YELLOW SUBMARINE has already been emulated in video clips by Michael Jackson 
and Oasis).  The entertainment value of the film is probably unquestionable 
if you're a Beatles fan, or an animation fan, or ideally both.  Children 
raised on cartoon slapstick and rocket-paced visuals may be a little 
bewildered by the film's reliance of wit over action, but it'll do them 
good.  Adults will find more to enjoy in the script's many conundrums and 
wall-to-wall puns, many of which refer to Beatles lyrics.  Film starts to 
wind down near the end - the Chief Blue Meanie gets really tiresome - but at 
least you know it's all bound to finish with a song.  It's a credit to the 
art direction by Heinz Edelmann that this feature has retained its entirely 
distinctive look decades later.  The soundtrack was digitally overhauled on 
the film's 30th anniversary and re-introduced in cinemas to stunning effect 
- now awash in an ocean of huge, crystal-clear sound, SUBMARINE's voyage is 
truly complete.

Review for Flight of the Phoenix, The (1965)
The Flight of the Phoenix (1965) 148m. 
I was mightily impressed with Robert Aldrich's enthralling story when
I was a youngster and was glad to see none of its power had been
diminished upon viewing it again as an adult.  James Stewart is a
pilot for an oil company whose cargo plane crashes 130 miles off
course in the Libyan Desert.  It soon becomes apparent to the small
contingent of survivors that they are beyond any hope of rescue.  When
it appears they have no other choice, Stewart reluctantly agrees to go
ahead with aviation designer Hardy Kruger's bold idea to construct a
new plane by cannibalizing parts of the old one - if they can stay
alive long enough to see their project through.
Absorbing study of men under pressure never flags: there is no wasted
dialogue, no maudlin 'I got a gal back home' or 'I was gonna open my
own business' soliloquies.  There is always a conflict, a new plot
turn, a grim revelation.  It's grueling just watching the men in their
despair, knowing that a stroll from the shade of their wrecked plane
can mean death.  The friction and tension between members of the group
only exacerbates their situation (it's fun watching Aldrich's sweaty,
confrontational closeups - you can almost see the testostersone
dehydrating off them in the desert heat).  There is no bonding of
survivors here - if anything, they split apart and dislike each other
even more intensely than when they were airborne.  Stewart isn't
interested in having us sympathise with his character - he's short
tempered and stubborn - but some viewers may prefer him to Hardy
Kruger's self-possessed designer (my favorite performance in the
film).  Their conflict is the hinge of the story, in which the need
for leadership within the group is eventually distilled down to these
two protagonists. Within the group two camps emerge, those who want to
organize and assume some form of control, and those who are unwilling
to do anything unless ordered (and even then do it begrudgingly). 
This highlights an interesting human/animal trait (is it purely
masculine?), namely the automatic higher positioning of any one
individual within a group and the behavior system's subsequent pecking
orders and heirarchies.  And in FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX's case, survival
isn't necessarily only for the fittest.
Acting performances all around are magnificent.  You'll admire Peter
Finch's captain, one of the few truly likable characters.  He's ably
supported by Richard Attenborough, Dan Duryea, Ernest Borgnine,
Christian Marquand, Ronald Fraser, and Ian Bannen.  Who survives and
who doesn't is almost abitrary by the film's end - you'll be more
concerned about the progress of their rebuilt plane than the
passengers themselves, especially at the heartpounding climax. 
Tragically, stunt pilot Paul Mantz was killed during these final
scenes.  Prolific novelist Elleston Trevor wrote the source novel,
Lukas Heller the sharp screenplay.

Title
Review for Stereo (1969)
Stereo (1969) & Crimes of the Future (1970) 65m each.
David Cronenberg once had ambitions to be an "obscure science fiction 
novelist" prior to his film-making career, and it shows through in these two 
trial works, which are so similar to each other and yet so distinct from his 
other films that they cannot help but be discussed together.  They are not 
recommended as general viewing but should be of interest to Cronenberg 
completists in that they establish the themes of sexuality, mutation and 
medicine prevalent in most of his subsequent work.
Cronenberg's debut STEREO is the result of his interest in underground film 
- it may aspire to be experimental but comes across more like a student 
project.  There is no live sound, but a voice-over spoken by different 
narrators who sound as if they are taking turns reading from the same 
medical journal.  The storyline - if it can be called that - describes an 
experiment by a research facility in Ontario to accelerate telepathic 
abilities among a group of young subjects.  As a kind of punchline, the film 
ends inconclusively, with the narration stating that all the events we have 
seen in the film are in need of yet further analysis.
It's hard to say whether STEREO succeeds or fails without knowing 
Cronenberg's real intent - as a stand-alone experimental film it's no better 
or worse than many other student features, but if its aim is to portray a 
fictitious medical report in a documentary style, then it does so suitably.  
All of this is to the expense of involvement, however.  The bloodless 
delivery of unending pseudoscience makes this difficult viewing, although 
there are some intriguing nuggets buried within (Cronenberg's wry take on 
heterosexuality, for example).  In fact, STEREO rejects the notion of film 
as a medium of communication and sets out, almost as a put-on, to alienate 
its viewers instead: Cronenberg is more interested in framing his 'actors' 
within chic, modernist buildings than providing his visuals with any human 
impetus; the lengthy silent passages give us a rest from the unwieldy 
narration but do not serve to clarify what anyone in the film is feeling; 
and the only real 'action' sequence, in which someone is chased through a 
building, is no more than a psychic projection.  I don't think this is 
misjudgment on Cronenberg's part.  By crafting his film in a subconscious, 
elusive manner, he may have hoped to simulate the subject of his story - 
because we see no characters speak and understand only fragments of what we 
hear in between the silences, it may be that STEREO tries to be a conduit to 
its own telepathic essaying.
STEREO has much in common with its nominal companion piece, CRIMES OF THE 
FUTURE.  They have identical running times, the same cast, and share the 
same filming approach (silent with voice-overs added) and visual sense 
(people continuously framed against architecture).  The narration of the 
latter is a little less technical, but just as oblique and delivered even 
more soporifically.  It is these similarities that make it hard to separate 
the two beyond the most technically apparent features - that is,  CRIMES is 
in color and its soundtrack is punctuated by intrusively dubbed biological 
sound effects.  But whereas STEREO examines the evolution of mental 
processes that would eventually culminate in films like SCANNERS and THE 
DEAD ZONE, CRIMES ponders on the evolution/regression/mutation of the body 
itself - ideas which Cronenberg would develop more fully in RABID, 
VIDEODROME, and THE FLY (THE BROOD would be his ultimate collision of both 
themes).  The storyline of CRIMES is more expansive and science-fictional: a 
young doctor explores different medical disciplines/factions that have 
evolved from research into an apocalyptic disease.  These vary in scope from 
dermatology to neo-venereal diseases to a sort of therapeutic podiatry - by 
the time it gets to this level you get the impression that Cronenberg is 
pulling the audience's leg as well his cast's.
Delivered once again in the stoic, emotionless manner of STEREO, CRIMES, 
like its predecessor, also serves to alienate, although this time it uses 
the device as a reflection of its characters.  Theirs is an austere, 
clinical world in which the child-bearing female population has all but died 
out.  The only purpose of the male survivors is to formulate, research, and 
experiment.  By the film's end their conclusions should be provocative but 
instead become just as detached as everything else that has gone before, 
leaving us to wonder what the 'crimes' of the future really are.  Or 
perhaps, ending where the film does, the title refers to crimes of the 
future beyond that of the present story.  It could be for this reason that 
in the final scene the protagonist sheds a single tear.  It's about time: 
after two features and two hours of calculation, Cronenberg is ready to put 
his obsessions to more direct work.  What's probably most interesting about 
this intimate pair of films is that they give no indication of the global 
cult status and success that their director was to earn.  Footnote: 
Cronenberg gave 1998's eXistenZ the working title CRIMES OF THE FUTURE, 
which led to many fans anticipating - or dreading - a revisitation of his 
early experimental style.

Title
Review for Robot Monster (1953)
     With the films of Edward D. Wood Jr having undergone a posthumous
lease of popularity, filmgoers are now more willing to invest time in
other, similar  "bad movies."  A prime candidate for some attention is
surely ROBOT MONSTER, a Phil Tucker-directed effort (I use the term
perfunctorily) that always gets unintended laughs from audiences.
Story shows us the attempts of  Ro-Man, the monster of the title, to
eradicate the last six  humans remaining on Earth in order to prepare
it for colonization by his fellow monsters, also from the planet Ro-Man
(and notRo-Planet, as you might expect).
     Don't expect logic from this scenario.  Why the entire invasion
fleet has to be put on hold because of the presence of a few humans is
never explained,  but you won't be concerning yourself with such
trivial details once you get a  look at the monster.  Ro-Man is an
inspired combination of (a) one gorilla suit,  (b) a deep-sea diver's
helmet, and (c) a portable television aerial.  Seeing Ro-Man waddling
through the rocky canyons of LA (where the film was shot in its
entirety), swatting irritably at bushes that aren't even in his way, is
a joy to  behold.  Poor Ro-Man's main purpose in the film seems to be
to walk from one end of the canyons to the other, and it's only a
matter of time before we stop thinking about the monster and start
wondering what imprecations are being muttered by the actor trapped
underneath the heavy, ungainly costume.  That Ro-Man is not designed
for running is obvious, given that his victims, in order  to be
attacked, have to walk right up to him or else stumble over while
running away.
     Film is a little slow to start (it's mainly Ro-Man being berated
by the Great Leader, who for some reason, he can't talk to without
shaking his fist--he must be the most nagged monster in movie
history), but by the time Ro-Man has gotten designs on the heroine
("The one they call Al-ice"), it's a riot.  ROBOT MONSTER doesn't have
the pitfalls of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE,  with which I have twice seen
it double-billed, but that's  only because it's not as ambitious:
there's no need for sets or a cast of more than half a dozen.  In the
long run, it looks like what the TV series LOST IN SPACE might have
churned out if they were told they could make a feature film.  Biggest
irony of the movie is that by the end of it you realize that the whole
story has been viewed through a child's perspective, and that
consequently the banal--and surreal--nature of the story, simple
dialogue (there's never a scientific term mentioned), and superficial
characters make perfect sense.  In that respect, it's almost a perfect
crystallization of the logic of children's fantasies or nightmares. But
unfortunately for the film makers, it's much easier to just laugh at.
As I have only seen screenings with audiences, I wouldn't know how well
the unintentional humor will translate to television.  Unbelievably,
this film was originally released in 3-D.  But you'd never guess it:
there is not one instance of this process being exploited in the
movie.  With the possible exceptions of Alice's tight top, and the
lettering of the title.

Title
Review for Motorama (1991)
Pre-packaged cult item was written by Joseph Minion, whose first produced 
screenplay was AFTER HOURS.  This has the feel of an earlier project that 
he'd spent previous years ironing out.  A ten-year old boy named Gus (Jordan 
Christopher Michael) steals a Mustang and drives through an imaginary 
America collecting cards for a game called Motorama, meeting various 
eccentric characters along the way and winding up in all sorts of trouble.  
I like to imagine MOTORAMA coming from the point of view of a boy in the 
back seat of a car during a long family trip, gazing out of the window at 
the empty landscape and having daydreams which are interspersed by pit stops 
at gas stations and diners.  Everything that happens in this film is 
possible (and if you don't believe a ten-year old can steal a car then I 
dare you to leave one parked outside a playground with the keys in the 
ignition) but that doesn't by necessity make any of it believable.  So it's 
neither real or unreal and too self-aware to be effectively surreal.  Is 
there anything left?
The best way to watch MOTORAMA is to think of it as an alternate-universe 
story.  Minion tells us as much by creating mythical States and a 
non-existent game as the story's framework.  This information isn't revealed 
to us from the outset, however, and I'm not sure if that's a wise move.  The 
first half hour may be irritating to some viewers ("Can't anyone see that 
this guy is just a kid?? Are they blind, or stupid, or what?") and the 
characters Gus encounters are phoney: he doesn't meet people, just guest 
stars.   It's a great supporting cast (Robert Picardo, Mary Woronov, Jack 
Nance, Michael J.  Pollard, Meat Loaf, Drew Barrymore and Dick Miller, to 
name a few) but because they're all veterans of offbeat/cult films we expect 
them to be weird before they even open their mouths.  It's OK once we figure 
out that MOTORAMA exists in its own universe, but until then it seems that 
Minion is trying too hard to show us how 'out there' his story is.  The 
point where it turns around, for me at least, is when Gus unexpectedly fouls 
up in the middle of one of his rip-off stunts and we realize that he's not 
just some wise-ass smart kid who is going to run rings around all the adults 
he meets.  In a film where extreme situations are treated lightly, it's 
surprising to find a scene mid-way through the story that has consequences.
The character of Gus is a difficult one to fall in step with.  Jordan 
Christopher Michael is neither appealing nor obnoxious in the role and 
MOTORAMA is not a film for kids, so he is expected to act and talk like an 
adult - so much so that you begin to think that the part of Gus could just 
as easily be played by an adult.  So why make the central character ten 
years old?  He's too savvy for this road trip to be treated as a learning 
exercise and is resourceful enough to get along without the support of 
adults (mostly, they're only a hindrance).  The only 'juvenile' element of 
his character is his obsession to collect game cards.  The decision to make 
Gus ten years old makes some sense in the final scenes of the film, which 
indicate that the alternate universe idea has been expanded into an 
alternate future.  Instead of a drowning man seeing his life flash before 
his eyes, a drowning boy sees his future flash before his eyes and the 
opportunity to change it has been implanted in his mind.  At any rate, Gus's 
life seems predestined.  The open road, a Mustang, and a gas-station game 
called Motorama: these all point the direction his life is to take.  And 
with a name like Gus, you'd pretty much expect him to wind up a pump jockey. 
  It's a future that would suit him fine - after all, consider the 
alternatives we've been witness to in the previous hour and a half.

Title
Review for Stupids, The (1996)
This silly comedy by John Landis could have been created for the screen 
without any reference to the children's storybooks by Harry Allard and James 
Marshall, but I suppose a copyrighted title like 'The Stupids' was too good 
to pass up.  The film utilizes the stories' characters and their pets 
(computer-animated in the style of Marshall's illustrations) but the plot is 
far trickier than their simple adventures in print.  What's great about THE 
STUPIDS is that its storyline is made of the flimsiest of ideas, thrown 
together with such abandon that you'll probably think scriptwriter Brent 
Forrester made the whole thing up as he went along.  Without giving away the 
gag that sets the story into motion, Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) believes 
there is foul play at work in his neighborhood.  After launching his own 
investigation he concludes that he has discovered a dastardly scheme of 
global proportions.  His wife and two children, who are just as oblivious to 
the real world as he is, don't need much convincing.  Living up to their 
family name, all four of them embark on a series of misadventures, which, of 
course, ends up with them unraveling a genuine conspiracy playing out right 
under their noses.
The humor of THE STUPIDS is a lot smarter than its title suggests, although 
like many comedies it resorts to slapstick for the finale.  The film's 
highlight has Arnold explaining his conspiracy theory to the rest of the 
family while we see it being played out for us in his mind (Christopher Lee 
is a hilarious asset to this scene).  It perfectly encapsulates both the 
world the Stupids live in and the rationale of the script, which derives its 
humor from the way that Stanley and his family create bizarre hypotheses to 
explain the most ordinary of day-to-day situations.  Clearly, the children 
have been brought up with the same insulated logic as their parents - they 
too misinterpret the most basic of encounters.  This allows the characters 
to interact in different combinations without having any one smarter family 
member offsetting the balance - for example, Father and Daughter believe 
they have died because the lights have suddenly been turned off (this is 
taken from the original stories); Mother and Son figure out that an elevator 
must be a time machine; Brother and Sister are convinced that their parents 
are being held for ransom in a Chinese restaurant; Mom and her children try 
to use a computer and blow up the office; Mom rushes into a wig shop to get 
a disguise and emerges covered entirely in wigs; and of course the family's 
patron, Stanley, creates mayhem wherever he goes on his crusade to save the 
world (he also gets to sing a hilariously complicated song about his family 
tree).
THE STUPIDS was generally slammed by critics and didn't do as well as other 
films by Landis, which is a shame as it has a goofy, easy-going charm that 
is absent in many of his later films.  One likely reason for its failure is 
that the public had had enough of Tom Arnold's tabloid-grabbing antics with 
former wife Roseanne Barr.  But I think Arnold, happily traipsing about in 
his powder-blue suit and straw hat, is a good choice for Stanley Stupid.  
Bigger comedy stars would have no doubt stamped their own brand of 
personality over the top of the character - they would have certainly 
outshone the rest of the family, whose parts are conspicuously underplayed.  
I have to assume that this flat acting style was a conscious choice of 
Landis, who didn't want his cast to mug it up.  Landis fans will also be 
quick to spot his trademark 'See You Next Wednesday' message incorporated 
into the film, a sight gag he uses to show that he has included material 
from an unused screenplay he once wrote as a teenager.  His other trademark 
- using fellow directors in cameos - is a little harder to spot, unless you 
really know your film-makers.  Film buffs may recognize Robert Wise as 
Stanley's neighbor.  Wise/Stupid.  Do you think that's another Landis 
in-joke?  Look for the re-named London Symphony Orchestra in the final 
credits.

Title
Review for Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967)
Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967) 138m. 
Easygoing spoof of early romantic musical comedies isn't nearly as
good as Ken Russell's wild version of THE BOY FRIEND but does mark the
only pairing of archetypal girls-next-door Julie Andrews and Mary
Tyler Moore (both played the role of nuns within a few years of this
film's release!).  There's also a surprising turn by James Fox as an
aimable playboy.  Millie (Andrews), determined to keep up with the
trendsetters in the Roaring 20s, meets would-be ingenue Dorothy
(Moore) in a New York hotel for young ladies.  They quickly become
friends, unaware that evil schemes are afoot below their rooms.  Film
has an old-fashioned look about it, even for 1967, and lacks the 
photographic verve of other productions by director George Roy Hill. 
Main joke, I suppose, is that what passed for progress in 1922 now
comes across as faddish - but as this is a criticism that can be
applied to any generation, screenwriter Richard Morris sensibly avoids
condescension (although I can't see many viewers endorsing Millie's
resolution "I don't want to be your equal any more - I want to be a
woman").  That leaves us with a sampler of twenties confectionary:
Vaudeville shows, roadsters, Gatsby-style parties, daredevil stunts
(right out of Harold Lloyd), candy-striped biplanes, flapper fashions,
and a subplot involving white slavery that could have come from any
old Saturday serial.
Film wants to be a comedy, a romance, a musical, and even an action
pic in places, but as a result it's too long.  The irrelevant wedding
sequence can be thrown out for a start; and the story really starts
sagging in the middle when Carol Channing's character shows up -
supposedly she's an embodiment of the Jazz Age, but I just found her
annoying.  Deliberately naive story and approach may work better for
children than adults - there's something too fake about the nostalgia
to make it work on any sophisticated level.  Still, as with any
sampler, you've got to take the marzipan with the creme.  Funniest
moment is when Andrews vamps it up in her boss's office.  Most
incomprehensible line:  "Machines, like love, should be either black
or white".  Produced by the king of gloss, Ross Hunter, who didn't see
eye to eye with Hill.  Sammy Cahn and James van Heusen wrote the
catchy title tune.

Title
Review for Savage Innocents, The (1959)
     Doozy of a film by Nicholas Ray, unlike anything else he'd done in
Hollywood.  Straightforward tale of life in the Arctic circle finds
Inuit hunter Inuk (A believable performance by Anthony Quinn) trying to
settle down with a wife and make sense of his recent contact with white
traders who have established a post several months journey from his
hunting grounds.  Story could have been incredibly trite but the
intelligent screenplay (by Ray) manages to keep one step ahead.  The
only times it falters is when an unnecessary and annoyingly folksy
narrator (you'll feel like strangling him), who could have been lifted
straight out of a True-Life Adventure, keeps interrupting and
explaining the characters' behavior.  This wouldn't have been done if
the film had been made today, but the film-makers apparently felt the
need to inform the audience that they had done their homework on Eskimo
lifestyles.  Also, the narration serves to add a documentary flavor to
their story.  But why bother?  Probably because the producers did not
want to be stuck with a film centered around characters that viewers
found too alien and were unable to identify with.  Perversely, the
voice-over nearly spoils any authenticity the film tries to maintain.
Besides, it's more fun listening to the quirky speech patterns of the
Inuit characters than any narrator (they do not have the personal
pronoun "I").  This dialogue, more than any other device, molds the
film's distinctive, alien milieu.
     When Inuk and his wife--whose point of view direct the
story--first encounter rudimentary elements of white civilization, we
get two alien worlds/viewpoints for the price of one.  The conflict of
values, which governs the narrative drive from halfway through the
film, provides the major theme of the story.  It's hard to tell if Ray
is more interested in this plotline or the punctuation of rituals
throughout it.  We see rituals for death, birth, eating, hunting, etc.
They at least give him an excuse to be incredibly daring for 1959--in
what other film of that time does the leading lady bare her
breasts?--and Ray could portray attitudes toward sex more frankly on
screen in this quasi-documentary fashion than he could with his
contemporary social dramas.  Some must have found the portrayal of the
permissive Inuit lifestyle scandalous, surely the main reason Rank
distributors opted to back the project in the first place.  What's the
bet they considered calling it THE INNOCENT SAVAGES first up?  This one
has cult movie written all over it.  Watch for an uncredited and dubbed
Peter O'Toole making his screen debut--he'd reach superstar status
three years later when he was reunited with Quinn in LAWRENCE OF
ARABIA.

Title
Review for Brewster McCloud (1970)
Even those who aren't taken with Robert Altman's style of film-making have 
to admire him for maintaining an affection for off-Hollywood (as in the 
manner of off-Broadway) projects throughout his long career.  Audiences who 
had enjoyed Altman's breakthrough anti-war comedy M*A*S*H* in 1970 were 
interested to see what he would come up with for an encore.  The result, a 
mere 11 months later, was his laconic fable BREWSTER McCLOUD.
Bud Cort plays the title character, a loner who lives beneath the Houston 
Astrodome working on a pair of man-powered wings that will enable him to 
fly.  While he is busy collecting the materials he needs, mysterious deaths 
by strangulation occur throughout the city.  What's the link?  Birds.  
Altman's running joke through this movie is that it is a birdwatching film, 
with avian references appearing everywhere, from the meals the characters 
eat to the license plates on their cars.  Over the course of the film a 
narrator (Rene Auberjonois) compares the appearance and behavior of people 
in the story with that of birds while increasingly becoming more birdlike 
himself.  These constant bird motifs would appear to reflect the 
flight-obsessed thoughts circulating through the characters' minds.  It 
seems to me that Brewster's desire to fly is not because he has some kind of 
Icarus complex or any affinity with birds in general (although he is rather 
owl-like) but that he is acting upon a type of race memory buried deep 
within him.  It's as if he knows that we were all once born to fly, but have 
forsaken and forgotten it.
Brewster is aided in his quest by Louise (Sally Kellerman), an elusive 
mixture of mother and mentor, but more pertinently a guardian angel, who has 
scars down her back that suggests she once had wings herself.  Even though 
all Brewster wants to do is take flight (the only time we see him happy in 
the film is when he finds himself airborne) it is never made clear why, or 
even where to.  Could it be that he is trying to reach a subconscious memory 
of heaven?  The redemption angle is reinforced further when Louise is 
dismayed to find that he has slept with a girl he has barely known (Shelley 
Duvall, who had never acted until her debut in this film).  These sins of 
the flesh equal a loss of purity that will 'ground' him, i.e. seal his 
mortality and prevent his entry into the angel-world.  The only would-be 
girlfriend of Brewster's to get approval from Louise is Hope (Jennifer 
Salt), who is able to get sexual satisfaction from their relationship while 
still keeping it entirely platonic (and, as Emily Dickinson said, "Hope is 
the thing with feathers", although I'm obviously straining the motif at this 
point).  Hope also appears in the guise of Dorothy, one of a few WIZARD OF 
OZ references in the film (there's also ruby slippers and a cameo from 
Margaret Hamilton).  I'm not sure why Altman included these - another 
man-bird meld would be the flying monkeys, I guess - but it could be to 
remind us that the whole film is 'only a story' (hence the narrator).  I'll 
go along with this until the film's closing credits, which abruptly 
introduces a circus troupe to present the cast, because I think it detracts 
from the film's conclusion.  Perhaps Altman didn't want viewers to think his 
black comedy had gotten too cynical.  There's touches of that, but there's 
also humor and contemplation.  Even though this isn't one of his 
better-known films I still find the scene of Brewster circling the Astrodome 
in flight one of Altman's most enduring images.

Title
Review for Kelly's Heroes (1970)
A mostly successful hybrid of two genres, the war movie and caper
film, which was popular with audiences upon release.  Clint Eastwood
is topbilled as a former lieutenant (he was busted down when the army
needed a scapegoat) fighting for the liberation of France in WWII.  He
hits upon the idea of robbing a bank behind enemy lines while the
country is in turmoil.  Eventually Telly Savalas and the rest of his
platoon, along with several outsiders, get involved in the plan.
Tone and feel of film on one hand portrays the chaos of war as a giant
shoot-em-up adventure playground, but on the other as a brutal and
unheroic campaign of destruction.  Director Brian G. Hutton and writer
Troy Kennedy Martin are intent on blurring the line; to show that in
ever-changing  battle frontiers there can only be ambiguity.  Most
ambiguous of all is that these unclear notions of heroism and crime
are being packaged as escapist, mainstream entertainment. Eastwood is
a complete cipher - he may as well be a carbon copy of the same
character he played for Hutton in the previous year's WHERE EAGLES
DARE - leaving the more overt roles to players like the cosmically
enlightened Donald Sutherland or hustling entrepreneur Don Rickles. 
Also, it's hard to reconcile the film's title with its events - since
when do mercenaries become classed as heroes? That their actions are
illegal are confirmed by Rickles, who gloats that their caper is `the
perfect crime'.  Of course, it could be the film-makers' intention
that there are no heroes in war, and that the only valor is getting
out alive.  Scenes of Kelly (coolly played by Eastwood) and his
platoon energetically mowing down German infantrymen become nothing
more than just another part of the adventure.  The biggest irony - and
it is what validates' Eastwood's actions - is that the platoon
unknowingly become heroes anyway - or at least as gung-ho general Colt
(Carroll O'Conner, in an amusing role) defines the term.
Film's finale is drawn out but comes at the end of much action, humor,
and brisk performances by the cast.  Fortunately, Hutton elects to
keep KELLY'S HEROES light (listen to that theme tune, for example) and
doesn't turn it into heavy-handed antiwar bloodletting.  For this
reason, it becomes one of those unusual things - a war adventure that
isn't interested in its own message.  

Title
Review for Little Romance, A (1979)
Light-hearted film by George Roy Hill shows once again how assuredly he 
is able to work in any genre of his choosing.  Two young teenaged 
geniuses (played by newcomers Diane Lane and Thelonious Bernard) meet by 
chance in Paris and pledge their hearts to each other.  They enlist the 
aid of an elderly gentleman (Laurence Olivier) to arrange themselves an 
interlude in Italy away from Lane's disapproving mother.  Amazingly, 
this film works despite what should be its only real weak point - Lane 
and Bernard's lack of chemistry together.  They are immediately likeable 
as individuals: Lane is impish yet level-headed; Bernard is savvy 
without being smarmy, and their friendship is believable.  Still, they 
don't demonstrate enough emotional highs and lows to prove themselves to 
us as lovers (although they are at least idealistic).  A LITTLE ROMANCE 
manages a perfect combination of elements: engaging performances, 
romantic European locations, a buoyant score (borrowed mostly from 
Vivaldi), and a smart, observant screenplay.
Hill avoids conscious stylistic elements and plays it low-key, making 
this more European and less American than his other films (Americans 
aren't portrayed flatteringly in this picture).  His shots of the 
youngsters watching movies or scampering through the city streets may 
remind you of Truffaut.  Hill also throws in a couple of references to 
his own movies, and has Bernard first meet Lane when he sneaks on to a 
film set - significantly, she is reading a book.  Bernard compares their 
partnership to Bogart and Bacall; Lane is more excited about being in 
the birthplace of Romeo and Juliet; Bernard is a fan of Robert Redford; 
Lane prefers Elizabeth Barrett Browning.  While both read literature, 
it's only Bernard who enthuses about film.  It's interesting, because 
while Bernard is the one more fascinated by the world of make-believe, 
it is the philosophy-reading Lane that wants to live out a romantic 
caprice.  And thrown into the mix is Olivier, going one step further and 
fabricating his entire life (as it turns out, nearly everyone in this 
film is living a lie of one kind or another).  Not one of this trio has 
the power to fulfil a fantasy on their own: it's the melding of their 
different forms of escapism that finally mobilize all three. 
Hill, a notoriously practical director, balances the romantic 
foolishness of his protagonists' escapade with a sense of studied 
feasibility.  What's really inspiring about A LITTLE ROMANCE is that it 
doesn't place its premise out of our reach - I don't doubt that several 
viewers have similarly sought out the story's special kiss on the 
waterways of Venice.  And of course it's great to see Olivier delivering 
a foxy performance as an old Parisian, enjoying the screen time he has 
with his much younger co-stars.  Like romance itself, this film has a 
timeless quality - it still holds up well after years of viewing.

Review for Fun (1994)
Few would have expected Rafal Zielinski, a director of simple teenage
sex comedies, to come up with this riveting study of two girls
detained in a juvenile correction facility.  Bonnie (Alicia Witt) and
Hillary (Renee Humphrey) meet on the side of the road one morning.  By
the day's end they have committed themselves to a lifelong friendship
sealed in a pact of blood.  William R. Moses and Leslie Hope play the
two adults trying to get to grips with the two girls and unearth the
full story behind their crime.  While both have common goals, their
motivations are different - Hope is a prim, businesslike prison
counselor determined to drive a wedge between the closed bond the
girls have formed; Moses is a magazine journalist who at first appears
out of his depth but gradually gains some insight into Hillary, the
more approachable of the duo.  His reasons for `getting the story'
have a resonance that is relevant to our experience of the film
itself: he feels it is Hillary's duty to explain every detail of her
senseless, violent crime so that she may share with his readers her
experience and help them understand what makes a young teenager go so
wildly off the rails.  Of course, we are undergoing an identically
vicarious situation by not only peering in on the interrogation of the
two girls but also reliving their crime through flashbacks.  Whether
or not, however, we gain a greater understanding of the girls is
murky.  Throughout, they insist on only one motivation for their acts:
fun.
I'm not sure why Zielinski chose to film the present-day sequences in
black and white and the flashbacks in color (other than to subvert the
convention of doing it the other way around) but they provide an
appropriate contrast of worlds - the word of adult reason, where there
is a clear definition of right and wrong/black and white; and the
girls' own world, an ephemeral, careless playground of `fun'.  As the
two teenagers, Witt and Humphrey are dazzling.  Witt is so natural
it's hard to believe her lines were scripted - what an ear for
dialogue writer James Bosley has!  Her delirious performance is what
you'll remember most from this film.  FUN is not for all tastes: these
girls are frank, vulgar, and frighteningly irresponsible - some
viewers may be disturbed that teenagers will identify with the
characters' high-octane teen angst and take their own best-friend
coteries to an illogical extreme.  This seems more specifically
pertinent when you remember that Bonnie and Hillary, who are greatly
influenced by movies and television themselves, appear uninterested in
forming any dissociation between their realities and fictions. 
Hillary frames her prison interviews the way they would exist in a
TV-movie; Bonnie, a habitual liar, persists in reciting a scenario in
which she is one of an army of invisible ninja.  The irony is that
this effect makes the movie appear even more real.  In fact, what's
most spooky about it is that its resemblance to based-on-fact
dramatizations is so strong there's virtually no distinction between
them.

Review for Lord Love a Duck (1966)
After half an hour of viewing this cult comedy you may feel a little 
disappointed that it fails to live up to the wackiness of its opening 
scenes.  But, like me, you may also find it easier viewing the second time 
around - after all, maintaining the high energy of its first few minutes for 
over an hour and a half is a difficult undertaking for any film.  Director 
George Axelrod probably chooses the right road: the main function of LORD 
LOVE A DUCK's daffy (no pun intended) opening is to set us up for the 
offbeat story which follows while also allowing various bits of weird 
nonsense to be dropped in here and there without having them feel jarringly 
out of place.
Roddy McDowall is a high-school genius who gives himself the nickname 
Mollymauk, after a type of albatross.  He surprises young Tuesday Weld one 
night and, with no explanation, immediately sets himself up as her mentor, 
protector, provider, and personal djinn.  He sets events into motion that 
make her wishes come true, but then whimsically creates minor obstacles 
which he in turn whole-heartedly sets about overcoming.  It's a strange 
relationship.  At the film's conclusion, McDowall (who has been relating the 
story in flashback) states emphatically that he did it all "for love".  The 
first time I saw LORD LOVE A DUCK I found this abrupt ending a little hard 
to swallow - especially since one of the wishes he grants Weld is marriage 
to a wealthy high school Senior.  Forewarned in the second viewing, it's 
apparent that there could be no logical reason for McDowall's behavior 
anyway, so settling for a motive as irrational as love is as good a reason 
as any.  I'm still not convinced, though: I think it's more likely that 
McDowall, as a genius, is terribly lonely and simply wants to share his 
perspective of the world with someone he has an interest in.  He represents 
himself to Weld by two symbols of freedom - birds and keys.  He even goes so 
far as to hypnotize Weld with keys, frequently dangling them in front of her 
face to establish himself as her personal liberator.  McDowall already has 
freedom - his superior intellect and physical prowess (he takes care of the 
school bruiser without getting his feathers ruffled) enable him to do pretty 
much whatever he wishes.  Choreographing Weld's life keeps him occupied 
until her desires are almost completely fulfilled, upon which he finds 
himself back where he started and can only respond by running amok.
The McDowall/Weld relationship is set against a satirical background which 
is just as odd as they are.  Their high school has become ludicrously 
'progressive' under the leadership of principal Harvey Korman (it's unusual 
to see him with black hair!); they make a deal with a movie producer who 
specializes in quickie Beach Party films; and while McDowall's family is 
absent throughout the film, Weld's parents are only half present - her 
mother picks up men in bars, and her father, who makes a memorable 
appearance in one of the film's most manic scenes, seems about two steps 
away from the booby hatch.  If that wasn't enough, Ruth Gordon also turns up 
halfway through the story as the mother of Weld's boyfriend.  It's another 
of her acerbic, domineering roles, in which she constantly berates her son 
for his failed suicide attempts (it's actually MacDowall who's cheerfully 
trying to knock him off!) and breezes through every scene as if she owns it. 
  LORD LOVE A DUCK is something of a grab-bag - it doesn't have something 
for everyone, but anyone with an interest in 60s cinema should give it a 
try.  There are probably more insights about the story and its characters in 
Al Hine's novel, if you can ever find a copy.

Review for ffolkes (1980)
Extortionists plant bombs on an oil production platform, a drilling rig, 
and a ship they have hijacked in the North Sea.  The British government 
sends gruff, eccentric troubleshooter ffolkes (Roger Moore) to 
counterattack.  Film looks like a TV-movie at the beginning (the flabby 
musical score doesn't help) but gets into gear once the head 
extortionist (Anthony Perkins) picks up a phone and makes his demands.  
Otherwise routine story has a few things going for it:  shipboard 
location work on heaving seas inject some atmosphere, and Perkins has 
snappy dialogue, but the main point of interest is seeing Roger Moore 
playing against his James Bond role.  In fact FFOLKES appears in the 
middle of Moore's run of Bond films, and you have to wonder how strongly 
he was attracted to the part just to escape that image.  It's a little 
jarring because while at first we see differences (ffolkes is bearded, 
reclusive, lives in an Aberdeen castle) we very quickly begin to draw 
parallels (like Bond, ffolkes is ex-navy, overconfident, and patriotic).  
And there is also Moore's plummy voice, which sounds very much like Bond 
underneath ffolkes' whiskers.
The most dramatic difference would appear to be ffolkes' attitude 
towards women - he is postively misogynistic.  But for those filmgoers 
who have known that Bond's own treatment of women reveals suppressed 
disdain for them, this is not so much of a departure after all, and 
makes FFOLKES even more interesting, in that it is Moore's own criticism 
of his more famous 007 role.  Veteran comedy screenwriter Jack Davies 
even throws in a pat 'explanation' of ffolkes' behavior (it was all to 
do with his childhood, of course).  That this is offered in a throwaway, 
comedic moment shows just how silly these supposedly enlightening scenes 
are.  It's obviously ironic that ffolkes is helped out by a girl in the 
end, but I think that it's just as perverse that the whole film finds a 
misogynist devoted to protecting installations that are referred to 
exclusively by their female names: Ruth, Esther, and Jennifer.  Film's 
businesslike approach to action sequences makes it more believable than 
the blockbuster excesses that would become the standard a few years 
later.  Similarly, Moore isn't required to be some kind of superhero - 
for most of the film he is surprisingly inactive.


Title
Review for Navigator: A Mediaeval Odyssey, The (1988)
The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey (1988) 92m.
New Zealand director Vincent Ward had some difficulty getting this,
his second feature, off the ground despite critical acclaim for his
debut VIGIL.  Story is seen through the eyes of Griffin (Hamish
McFarlane, who does too much earnest yelling for my liking), a boy
living in an isolated, snowbound village in 14th-century Cumbria.  His
older brother Connor (Bruce Lyons) has just returned home to bring
news of the plague decimating the surrounding lands.  Fearing the
wrath of God, an expedition is sent from the village to place, by way
of an offering, a cross atop a church on `the far side of the Earth'
(New Zealand).  Griffin claims he has already seen the journey (if not
lived it) and serves as the party's navigator - although what he is
navigating is not only space but also time and consciousness. 
Ward jumps the gap of six hundred years and the distance of half a
planet assuredly, but his unfixed narrative, interrupted by
repetitious flashbacks (which, since Griffin is using them to map
their future path, are simultaneously flashforwards), is less
comfortable.  This is a film based on an idea: Ward has a beginning
and an ending, but no strong narrative meat in the middle.  The
party's odyssey is over before it can reach the epic quality of a true
odyssey.  THE NAVIGATOR does not concern itself much with the spirit
of adventure (which would serve this particular story well) but
instead sticks to the more appropriately medieval doom-laden concerns
of God, death, and prophecy.  I'm glad at least that Ward didn't turn
his time-travel story into the kind of culture-shock cliche that
depends almost entirely on anachronism gags.  I also like the way he
keeps the nameless city (ostensibly Auckland) deserted and empty of
all activity save that of the machines and vehicles that prowl the
shadows like nocturnal scavengers.  His approach reinforces the notion
that everything Griffin is seeing is a dream (it's like an ultra-sober
WIZARD OF OZ - it's even bookended with black and white sequences and
features a journey to a magical city), but what prevents us from
dismissing his story as imaginary is the accuracy of his visions.
Griffin sees highways, television, a submarine, and even a glimpse of
a second potential apocalypse - the 20th century's nuclear update of
the plague.  This is Ward's nod to New Zealand's strong anti-nuclear
stance at the time, one which did not find favor with the US military
and caused much public debate.
Film has ambition and imagination, but still appears incomplete.  You
might come out of this feeling that something is lacking.  But you
have to admire Ward for sticking to his vision and producing something
other than the black comedies and urban/rural `social' dramas that had
the NZ film industry in a stranglehold.  His keen visual eye and deft
smoke-and-mirrors approach proves that a real director can still make
a class act out of a modest budget. 

Title
Review for D.O.A. (1988)
Remake of 1950 thriller is snappily directed, features popular lead
actors (Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan), and has a great premise, but is
ultimately torpedoed by a misconceived script.  Quaid is an English
professor (and has-been writer) on a Texas campus who finds out that
he has been fatally poisoned.  With only 24 hours left to live he
tries to find out who is responsible.  While I thoroughly enjoyed this
on first viewing, it doesn't hold up so well the second time around. 
Story, which belongs to the =91what would you do if the world was going
to end in ten minutes=92 school of speculation, treads the path a number
of us would no doubt choose - what Quaid wants is answers.
What drives D.O.A. is the notion that fear of death can be taken to a
further stage - the fear of dying without meaning or reason.  In fact
Quaid is more preoccupied with solving the mystery behind his imminent
death than  the physical act of dying itself.  
The most puzzling thing for Quaid (and the audience) is the crime=92s
motive.  There is no apparent reason why anyone should want to kill
him.  This intriguing element is one of the best things the film has
going for it until the denoument, which is so absurd it undermines the
whole premise.  Worse, it trivializes Quaid=92s death.  There are other
glitches, most obviously that by the time the bodies start piling up
(and there=92s way too many for such a weak motive) there=92s not a lot of
suspects left over to pick the murderer from.  There=92s also a
convoluted exposition scene with Charlotte Rampling that for all
purposes is irrelevant to the main story.  Nor am I convinced about
the neccessity for Meg Ryan=92s character.  Her brief interlude with
Quaid supposedly reminds him of the quality of life that he has let
slip by - but does anybody really need this just before they=92re about
to die?  On a purely filmic level, however, the film succeeds, and 
there are enough inventive moments to make it interesting.  A 
promising cinema debut for Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton - with all 
its plot holes it might have been a good idea for them to push style 
over content even further.

Title
Review for White Hunter, Black Heart (1990)
White Hunter, Black Heart (1990) 110m. 
Film based on a book based on a film based on a book.  Or, to be more
precise:  Clint Eastwood's film of Peter Viertel's roman-a-clef about
John Huston's film of C. S. Forester's novel `The African Queen'. 
Huston's production was quite an ordeal.  His cast and crew shot on
location in the Belgian Congo; their steamboat sank in the river;
filming was delayed by rain; and nearly everyone contracted malaria or
dysentery.  Eastwood/Viertel's retelling instead chooses to focus on
Huston's ambition to shoot a wild elephant.  Was his prime motivation
for travelling to Africa to enchance his film's authenticity or pick
up a hunting permit for a few hundred dollars and go on safari?  It's
the latter argument that drives Eastwood's monomaniacal director John
Wilson, who doesn't care about his creditors, his producers, his
audience, or even possibly his film.  He appears to be the worst type
of character to let be in charge of a film on location.  But Wilson
manages to persuade everyone to let him have his due - he is funny,
cynical, gruff, opinionated, and articulate.  You can see how Eastwood
was attracted to this role, particularly in the scenes when he cuts
someone down to size with one of his caustic monologues.  His
performance, whether it is based on Huston or not (let's face it, a
cigar-chewing, gravelly-voiced director isn't exactly a stretch for
Eastwood), dominates everything on screen.
Eastwood/Wilson keeps himself at a far remove from any other
characters and it is only through his peer/mentor relationship with
the more responsible screenwriter Pete (Jeff Fahey) that we see him at
his most approachable.  Pete provides the voice of Wilson's
conscience, i.e. the voice he does not listen to.  But it's clear that
Wilson is calling the shots, even in Pete's domain: early in the film
Wilson writes the lead characters out of his script by killing them at
the story's conclusion because as a film `god' it is his right to do
so.  We naturally expect the same reasoning behind his killing of an
animal, a notion Pete (who sees elephants as timeless beings) balks
at.  If a godlike human is superior to his human contemporaries does
that also confer him superiority over a godlike animal?  The answer to
this question is where the film seems to be heading from the outset. 
We do at least see a change in Wilson's demeanor at the conclusion -
upon one character's utterance of the film's title, it looks as if he
has finally been struck by a grim revelation.  It's ironic that
Wilson, given to lengthy invectives against his travelling companions,
is brought down to earth by nothing more than four words.  He is on
the receiving end of his own advice to Peter:  strip away all
complications and keep it simple.  Eastwood's film itself is also
deceptively simple - it ranks among his very best.  Unfortunately, the
public, more used to seeing Eastwood as a hero with a gun and not an
anti-hero with a gun, largely ignored it upon release.  Catch it if
you can.  

Title
Review for Belstone Fox, The (1973)
James Hill's film starts off as a children's story - Ashler, huntsman
for the Belstone estate, adopts orphaned fox cub and names him Tag;
fox forms bond with hound pup; huntsman returns grown fox back to
woods - but ends up like a landlocked version of MOBY DICK.  Once
released, the appropriately-named Tag leads the Belstone Hunt on a
cut-and-run chase through the trees and fields with an intelligence
beyond that of your average fox.  He's certainly smarter than the
humans chasing him, at any rate.  When one hunt ends with fallen
riders and dead hounds (in a stunt worthy of a Roadrunner cartoon) the
chase gets personal.  Ashler, who starts out as a sympathetic, fair
character, becomes driven by a vendetta that consumes him to the end
of the last hunt, where one of the two antagonists must die.
This is the stuff of a fine character piece, but we never really get
under the characters' skin.  Even the fox could have done with a bit
of development.  Hill spins an engaging yarn, but keeps neutral,
presenting neither Tag or Ashler as hero or villain (our tendency is
naturally to side with the fox).  Nor does he make any negative
comment about fox hunting.  But then, he doesn't have to: the sight of
grown men on horses stampeding about the countryside after a fox is
just plain risible.  The Hunt, heavily ritualistic, is a fair
representation of the human condition - civilized on the outside,
barbaric underneath - and those who break from the pack are
immediately outcasts, whether it is Ashler or his favorite hound
Merlin.  Film mixes individual-vs-conformity and man-vs-nature themes
easily and without pretension.  If it's a children's film then it has
more intelligence than the usual cutesy-animal flick of its type. 
Only slow point is the unnecessarily long birthday sequence.  Was this
included just for the sake of contrasting another `growth' ritual
against that of the Hunt?  Starring: Eric Porter, Rachel Roberts,
Dennis Waterman. 

Title
Review for One That Got Away, The (1957)
It was sporting of Rank studios to film this true story, which shows
Germans in a sympathetic - even heroic - light, only a dozen years
after WWII had ended.  It also makes for an interesting exercise in
the power of cinema.  Despite bitter postwar feelings it must have
been hard for Allied audiences not to root for the `enemy' POW trying
to escape back to his homeland.  And how many British films of that
time would have gambled with a German actor as its leading man?  As it
happened, this was a star turn for Hardy Kruger, who gives a
charismatic performance as Lt Franz von Werra, a Luftwaffe pilot
forced down over Kent and then shipped to a POW camp in the Lake
District.  His tenacious escape attempts throughout the remainder of
the film make for compelling viewing.  He tries so hard that you'll
really want him to succeed, especially by the end (in a sequence I
find quite surreal) when he is half-frozen and can't seem to manage
another step.
Picture succeeds because of two reasons: the humanization of
individual struggle negates the political ordinance of war; and
regardless of race, color, or creed, we always like to see someone
beat the odds.  For those of us who have seen many an escape story
featuring Allied heroes it comes as a breath of fresh air to see a
story told from the other side.  Film also shows us the reason for the
lack of such stories - how exactly do you escape from an island
nation?  But Werra has several plans.  His initial breakout is
absurdly simple - he runs when the guards' backs are turned - but his
efforts to remain free become increasingly audacious: he may be
fulfilling a desire or responsibility to live up to his flamboyant
(but largely fabricated) public image.  Film stays on its toes the
whole time.  I especially enjoy the way civilians are obliging, a
little bemused, and polite whenever they encounter Kruger's character
- I wonder if director Roy Ward Baker took some perverse pleasure in
showing easygoing Britishers being duped by Werra's confident
fast-talking and dashes for freedom.  This is the one subgenre of war
movies that makes it okay for us to view the antics of the characters
as if they were schoolboys larking about and dodging the headmaster:
the one type that doesn't demand we concentrate on the tragic elements
of war.  It acts, of course, as `escapism'.  Werra's escape is indeed
epic in scale - in reality he traveled nearly half a planet to make
his way home (the film stops about halfway through).  The fascinating
footnote contains enough material for another whole story.  

Title
Review for Falls, The (1980)
Another counting game by idiosyncratic director Peter Greenaway.  In many 
ways it is the ultimate Greenaway film.  Audacious feature has no story and 
seems like a put-on when you try to describe it to others.  A strange 
occurrence, known in the film as the Violent Unknown Event (VUE), strikes 
the planet one night and leaves 19 million victims in its wake.  The effects 
are mixed, sometimes benevolent, sometimes not, sometimes a little of both, 
but common symptoms can be identified.  Most pointedly, the victims become 
obsessed with birds and flight.  Several also begin talking in 
unidentifiable languages.  Greenaway elects to tell his story by excerpting 
92 biographies from a filmed catalogue of VUE victims, each name starting 
with the letters FALL.  For the first twenty minutes this doesn't look like 
easy viewing - by the fifteenth biography (they vary in running times) we 
realize there are still another 77 to go - but eventually we become familiar 
with the material and its recurring themes, and Greenaway's mammoth project 
becomes intriguing.
Anyone acquainted with other Greenaway films will know that his work is very 
much an acquired taste, which is why THE FALLS is not recommended to 
neophytes (but if you're feeling brave, go ahead and take the plunge).  Much 
of the fun comes from recognizing quotes from his previous short subjects 
and future features - there are the women called Cissie Colpitts (who would 
resurface - pun intended - in DROWNING BY NUMBERS); one subject's obsession 
with the letter H (H IS FOR HOUSE); the dreams of water (WATER); the 
characters who are watching another Greenaway film (VERTICAL FEATURES 
REMAKE); the blend of artwork and birds (A WALK THROUGH H).  THE FALLS also 
quotes from itself: there are 92 biographies, 92 trains, 92 VUE languages; 
characters do indeed 'fall' (from buildings, from homemade wings in the 
style of Icarus) and literally become 'falls' (one woman turns into a human 
waterfall, a man changes his name to Niagara).  Greenaway's punning and 
deadpan humour reinforce the futility of his project.  Much of the 
information compiled for the biographies is trivial and not particularly 
useful (e.g. one man's body heat is identical to the average temperature of 
sedentary passerines).  The randomness of the VUE symptoms add to its 
arbitrariness.  Nobody can agree on theories (the epicentre of the VUE) or 
even facts (the date in history when one man jumped from the Eiffel Tower).  
It appears that to Greenaway any collection of statistics is just as 
fanciful as a fiction, which may explain his project's concept.  THE FALLS 
presents facts and figures as ultimately fractal, where the very act of 
codifying creates a sort of unpredictable, baroque aesthetic.  And who 
better than Greenaway, an artist and former statistician, to present this?
This may be Greenaway's least accessible feature, but it has a lot going for 
it - it is markedly unique and highly personal.  Not merely an elaborate 
experimental film, it reminds us of the territories that cinema can create 
and then travel in.  But it's probably enough that THE FALLS runs for three 
hours - Greenaway has stated that he would like to make an even longer 
version for television.  Given his interest in computer/video technology, 
it's likely that the ultimate fate of THE FALLS is to exist as an actual 
directory on CD-ROM.  That's taking cinematic boundaries about as far as 
they can get.


Title
Review for Phantom Tollbooth, The (1969)
After making over two hundred animated shorts, Chuck Jones finally got 
to the chance to direct a feature with this adaptation of Norton 
Juster's children's book. It's a colorful effort, but patchy.  Children 
will be hooked by the film's live-action opening: a listless boy by the 
name of Milo is suprised to find a miniature tollbooth
and car in his bedroom.  The scene is set for some great adventure, but 
the switch to animation may lose the connection kids will have with the 
protagonist's real-life counterpart.  Story is a blend of Alice in 
Wonderland' and Pilgrim's Progress', relating Milo's adventures in the 
lands of Dictionopolis and Digitopolis.  It's one of
the few films of its type that doesn't have a presiding villain.  
Indeed, the point of it is that wasted time (through laziness, 
disinterest, ignorance) is the only real enemy of childhood.  As 
Juster's episodic book has been judiciously compressed, this
revelation (as it occurs to Milo at the film's end) isn't too 
convincing.  Film also has other flaws: there's too many songs in the 
first twenty minutes; character voices sound too much like Bugs Bunny, 
Daffy Duck, Augie Doggie, and others; and the most memorable character 
from the book, the Watchdog, is badly conceived (he looks just like a 
regular dog, and his fatherly voice doesn't jibe with his dewy eyes).
Film is recognizably a product of the Warners studio, although Milo is 
drawn noticeably in the Disney mold of child heroes.  It may be of more 
interest to fans of Jones than those of the book, although it doesn't 
reach the heights of his short subjects.  There's certainly less humor 
than you'd expect, and Jones makes almost no attempt at slapstick, 
sticking instead to the wit and wordplay prevalent
throughout the book.  To be fair, the book's abstract concepts would be 
difficult to adapt successfully to the screen.  Film is uneven but is 
interesting as an alternative to the dominant Disney features of the 
time - you have to wonder about Warners' timing, considering Disney had 
died shortly beforehand.  And it does improve as it
goes on.  It's no YELLOW SUBMARINE but you can see influences of 
psychedelia in the vivid colors and geometric patterns - it makes you 
wish that it would really cut loose with a couple of sequences more 
reminiscent of the zany cartoons the studio is famous for.     


Title
Review for Hitcher, The (1986)
     Hitch-hikers have always been good material for horror stories,
but this effort is classier than most.  That's not to say it is
entirely without its B-movie elements.  Story is at once simple and
complex.  Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell) picks up a hitch-hiker (Rutger
Hauer) on a Texas road in the middle of nowhere.  Within the next
quarter-hour of screen time, this hitcher has pulled a knife on him,
forced him off the road, narrowly missed running him down, and almost
blown him up.  This is familiar territory for most psycho-killer
stalk-and-slash fare, and audiences usually don't give the killer's
motives a second thought.  He's a psycho, ergo he's crazy and kills
people.  Enough said.  But THE HITCHER goes beyond this convenient
movie mindset and after a while it becomes clear that Hauer is not
trying to kill Howell (though he comes awfully close) as much as scare
the hell out of him.  It's almost as if he is a psycho 'playing the
part' of a movie psycho, and Howell is his audience.  In the creepy
opening sequence, in which Hauer evades all of Howell's questions, we
are given only one indication of the stranger's intent.  "Stop me,"  he
tells Howell.  From that point on Howell is plunged into a waking
nightmare, realizing that the hitcher is on a killing rampage,  and one
that he has unwillingly become a part of.
     It's the hitcher's motives that provide the puzzle in this film.
One possible explanation for his behavior is that he has totally
divorced himself from his conscience, and by externalizing it in the
form of Howell (who he may suspect is too weak to stop him), has passed
on all responsibilities for his actions so that he can commit his
violent acts with abandon.  As he realizes that Howell is too soft a
touch, he toughens up his campaign.  Which turns out to be bad news for
anyone Howell comes into contact with.  But a more intriguing idea
behind Hauer's motives is that he is a latter-day Flying Dutchman,
doomed to wander the hellish desert roads from one end to the other.
When investigated by the police he is found to have no past record,
driver's license, or any means of identification whatsoever.  He has
seemingly come from nowhere.  The name he gives Howell upon their first
meeting is the obviously pseudonymous "John Ryder".  Has he found a way
to end his curse--or worse, pass it on--by goading Howell to end his
life?  (When he places coins on Howell's eyes, he is suggesting that he
is damned).  Significantly, during their final confrontation, Hauer
drops a chain to the ground and smiles: he is free at last.
     The film has moments that are alternately nail-biting and exciting.
Top-notch cinematographer John Seale makes this one worth seeing on a
long screen, if only for the wonderfully-framed shot of two police cars
spinning end over end along the road.  Focused script and direction by
Eric Red and Robert Harmon respectively.  And Hauer makes a great
villain--we can't really hate him even though the things he does are
horrifying.  Also with:  Jennifer Jason Leigh (who'd already been at
odds with the villainous Hauer the previous year in FLESH + BLOOD).

Title
Review for Legend (1985)
     Forest-dwelling boy (Tom Cruise) takes pure-of-heart princess (Mia
Sara) to see unicorns and then loses them to Dark Lord underground.
With help from faerie folk of the wood, boy mounts rescue attempt.
Slight story is probably why Ridley Scott's 1985 fantasy was dismissed
as an overblown jumble, but that's no reason not to enjoy the sumptuous
vision he brings to the screen.  Some may be spellbound by this
film--others will find it tedious.  You'll be excused for thinking from
the start that Tolkien had hired him to make a TV commercial for
Middle-Earth.
     The thinly-drawn characters of Jack (surely Cruise's oddest role)
and Lili are obvious targets for criticism, but Scott is less
interested in unraveling a plot than he is in capturing the look and
feel of myth.  Lili (a.k.a. Lily, the symbol of virginity) and Jack
(whose name appears most frequently in folk tales and nursery rhymes)
are character types, not character studies.  We are never told what
Lili is the princess of; we have no idea what Jack does in the forest.
Everything is generic, nothing has a definite location in time or
place.  But I'm glad Scott didn't include any phoney-baloney character
development just because he was making a film in the progressive 80's.
He presents LEGEND in exactly the manner that the title would
suggest--as a universally recognized Jungian consciousness, where
archetypes replace personalities.  Unfortunately, this is to the
expense of Tim Curry's Dark Lord, the most memorable character in the
movie, who proves once again that the devil gets all the best lines.
Curry steals the show with his performance--it's a shame he doesn't
get a chance to do more in the picture.  Scott sidesteps his
uninvolving characters by keeping his frame as  busy as possible.
Never in my life have I seen so much "billowing" in a movie
before--leaves, snow, smoke, petals, steam--Scott keeps the air alive
(I think he's going overboard when he introduces soap bubbles) to
remind us that the story is steeped in a magical atmosphere, and also
to highlight the sentience of air as an elemental force.  The other
three elements of ancient cosmology--fire, water, and earth--are
similarly dominant throughout the story: Jack swims underwater, breaks
through ice, is covered by snow, journeys into the earth, battles
through steam and fire, and even harnesses the power of the sun.
     Picture is gorgeously photographed, and invokes a dreamlike
world.  Jerry Goldsmith's score functions so well it's hard to imagine
watching this film without it--yet it was unceremoniously dumped during
re-editing for the U.S. release and replaced by a synthesizer
soundtrack.  Catch the Goldsmith version if you can.  Film was cut
heavily before release, and it shows.

Title
Review for Timecode (2000)
In the 60s Andy Warhol was responsible for producing a number of experiments 
in cinema.  It wasn't so much the films themselves than the audiences that 
Warhol found interesting - by showing static, lengthy opuses he was actually 
encouraging his viewers to get bored and talk to their neighbors.  His 
experiments with simultaneous projection were pretty much cut of the same 
cloth: cinematic narrative is arbitrary and you watch what you want when it 
suits.  Bring on WOODSTOCK.   Bring on Brian De Palma.  Split-screen 
perspective was less about narrative deconstruction than it was of gimmickry 
- even Abel Gance knew that when he made NAPOLEON in 1927.  End of story, 
you might think, but not quite.  Developments in digital technology have 
once again allowed us to throw a fresh coat of paint on the old split-screen 
wagon.  In TIMECODE, director Mike Figgis uses the new lightweight Sony 
DSR-I to synchronize not two, but four narrative divisions on the cinema 
screen.  You want more?  The separate narratives have all been filmed 
simultaneously on one Friday afternoon.  Improvised.  In unbroken 93-minute 
takes.
Let's put aside the storyline - or storylines - for a moment and address a 
more obvious issue: how do you watch something like this?  More pertinently, 
how do you watch four screens when one of them always focuses on Salma Hayek 
in a snug-fitting top?    Figgis knows ahead of time which screen his 
viewers are going to be drawn to, and this is the most impressive aspect of 
his film.  The fast-tracking digital countdowns in the title credits are 
there to advertise the logistical feat that he has accomplished.  Although 
his actors and camera operators improvise around a preset framework of 
circumstances, they are each given a 'timecode' to follow - a sort of time 
clock which must be punched at intervals throughout the film.  This most 
noticeably occurs during periodic earth tremors, but also effectively in 
moments where all frames are simultaneously filled with close-ups of faces, 
telephone conversations, characters in restrooms, or contemplative scenes 
that allow the musical soundtrack to engage with the action.
You would think the theme underlying Figgis' work would be one of 
unification, but he takes the opposite tack, and it works just as well.  
TIMECODE is set in and around a small-time film studio, where we see actors, 
producers, writers, and directors sifting through the bric-a-brac that 
passes for their daily management.  It seems an amusingly perfect setting 
for TIMECODE's sensibilities: the studio execs' juggling act is in symmetry 
with Figgis' own deployment of images on screen, but there the similarity 
ends.  Instead of harmony we find duplicity.  The multiple screens become 
testament to untruths, causing us to debunk one character's assertion that 
the tyranny of montage (as per Eisenstein) has resulted in 75 years of 
manipulation and lies.  If the implication is that the opposite must be 
true, then TIMECODE rejects that also: unedited footage does not prescribe 
integrity, as evidenced by the continual deceptions perpetrated in real-time 
before our eyes.  But that's okay.  Figgis has undertaken his project with 
humor, and tips us a self-referential wink every now and then without coming 
across as smug.  His orchestrated synchronicities are not designed to dazzle 
us into an oh-gosh appreciation of his technical skill, they are there to 
elicit grins.  You smile because it's cute, because it all seems made up 
even though you know it isn't.   TIMECODE is a confidence that we have been 
taken into, and we enjoy participating in the director's game.
It takes a confident film-maker to place his work so heavily in the hands of 
his actors and camera operators (essentially second and third unit 
directors), and it's heartening to see another contemporary talent trying to 
mess around in the mainstream.  See this in a theater if you can, otherwise 
make sure you've got a big screen TV if video is your only option (those 
four divisions could get mighty small).  And don't touch that pause button.  
You know Mike wouldn't want you to.

Title
Review for Tank Girl (1995)
Most people who'd read the comics by Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett hated 
this live-action film version, although I think that says more about the 
quality of the comic books than the movie.  The setting is familiar enough: 
a post-apocalyptic future, mostly desert, with rag-tag rebels fighting an 
evil overlord for water.  TANK GIRL doesn't want to commit to being set in 
either America or Australia, so settles for both (or neither) which would 
make more sense if the rest of the story was treated in the same way, i.e. 
an excerpt from a larger scenario rather than a complete arc.  It was 
undoubtedly even more annoying for readers of the comic who saw Tank Girl's 
'history' being rewritten for the screen.
The film-makers may have made some bad decisions in TANK GIRL but they did 
get the casting right for the lead role.  Even though much of the casual 
vulgarity of the original character was removed, Lori Petty still makes a 
spunky, perky Tank Girl.  I don't think we need to see the processes 
responsible for her transformation into the heroine of the title, however, 
nor the introduction to her friend Jet Girl (less convincingly assumed by 
Naomi Watts).  Since Petty's character remains consistent throughout the 
movie, it wouldn't have mattered if Tank and Jet smashed their way on to the 
screen from frame one.  In fact, the whole story is just wrong for these two 
characters - they should have had more desert time, tank time and jet time 
instead of spending most of the movie indoors.  The rebel band of 
genetically modified kangaroo men ('rippers') is also a mistake.  Their 
scenes drag and they fare no better than animated action figures.  And 
lastly, the movie's potential star attraction - namely, the tank -  is badly 
wasted.  This overblown variation of the gun-as-penis metaphor is perfect 
for the sexually aggressive Petty (the theme from SHAFT plays when she 
drapes herself all over the tank's barrel, sighing "I'm in love" ) but 
appears too late into the story.  The tank, an effectively scrappy composite 
of Rube Goldberg punk, is relegated to night sequences which fail to show it 
off to its best advantage; similarly Jet Girl's stolen jet makes only one 
appearance in its newly-liberated form before it gets repainted back into 
its former military colors.
With its lead characters, props and source material, TANK GIRL could have 
been a blast.  Director Rachel Talalay was forced to cut material, but I 
doubt this missing footage would have improved the film.  You may find 
yourself wishing that the film-makers had decided to ditch the live action 
concept and extended TANK GIRL's two brilliantly animated sequences into a 
full feature instead.  Why not?  Petty's already got that cartoon-character 
voice down pat.

Title
Review for Heat (1995)
It's almost unbelievable that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino had never played 
a scene together until they appeared in this crime picture by Michael Mann.  
This alone would be enough to earn the film a following, but even if you'd 
never seen these two actors before, HEAT would still make good viewing.  It 
began life as a screenplay written by Mann in the 70s, which was then 
reworked as a TV-movie called L.A. SHAKEDOWN in 1989 and filmed again six 
years later as he had originally envisaged it.
With two veteran players like these it's a tossup as to who plays the cop 
and who plays the bad guy, and in a perfect world Mann would have made two 
versions of this film, with the De Niro and Pacino roles switched (that 
would have been an interesting concept!).  In this version, it's Pacino 
who's the good guy, a cop on the trail of career criminal De Niro, whose 
gang has just pulled off an armored truck robbery.  He's been in the police 
business too long and has seen too much, and De Niro is his polar opposite, 
although just as professional in his approach to his work.  While the pair 
of them reveal their more personal selves to women, they communicate 
primarily in terms of business with their male associates.  It's only when 
Pacino and De Niro meet face to face at the hub of the story that their 
dialogue becomes a meld of both personal and professional, confirming our 
suspicions that each of them has only the other to identify with in this 
world.
Mann's use of neutral colours (all slate greys and chilly blues) and urban 
settings also appear to freeze emotions throughout the film.  He doesn't 
allow any humor to relieve the tension of the film's three-hour running 
time, turning HEAT into a brooding epic of masculinity - the title isn't 
just referring to police and pressure but also to the testosterone powering 
its protagonists.  Pacino and De Niro make pains to show they're in control 
while also being aware that they operate on personal codes that protect them 
from being emotionally vulnerable.  On one hand, they provide each other 
with distraction from the issues of commitment that puzzle and hurt them; 
however they also know that they are helping each other tear their worlds 
apart.  When they're forced head to head, they come out with guns blazing.  
In most other crime films, this shootout would serve as the story's climax, 
but as it deals with the characters' conflict on a superficial, machismo 
level  we don't expect it to be any suitable resolution.  That's why Mann's 
lengthy story doesn't seem overlong - or rather, it doesn't seem 
inappropriate that it's overlong.  Beyond the shootout there must be another 
more intimate - but just as deadly - confrontation.  Mann's precise 
direction (the timing of every scene and cut seems flawless) and investment 
into the hearts and minds of the characters make HEAT something grander than 
the flashy crime films we're most often accustomed to.  Actors who have 
worked with him agree that he's a perfectionist, and here it pays off.

Title
Review for Baby, The (1973)
What did audiences make of this when they saw it in cinemas in 1973?  If you 
think Grant and Hepburn had problems bringing up Baby, then check this one 
out.  Social worker Anjanette Comer drops in on Ruth Roman and her grown-up 
daughters to assess their backward son, Baby.  But no ordinary case, this: 
the son is just as grown up as the rest of the family.  You may find 
yourself giggling with disbelief or maybe just embarrassment as full-grown 
adult David Manzy gurgles and coos in baby-talk and crawls on the floor in 
his diaper, while everybody standing around him acts as if everything is 
completely normal - which it would be after a while, I suppose.  
Nevertheless, watching Baby scrambling around at floor level while a room of 
men and women are going about their own business at a birthday party is 
still hard to swallow, and it's not as if we'd had plenty of opportunity to 
get adjusted to the film's screwy tone by that time.  The sheer excess of 
its sensibilities - look out for that cattle prod, Baby! - pushes it aside 
from any measurable notions of success or failure.  For a start, it's 
unclear exactly what genre THE BABY aspires to be (although the last half, 
complete with a musical score of dragging cellos and tinkly piano, heads 
unsteadily into horror territory).  Then there's the acting.  And the 
screenplay.  And the ending, which in any other film would be plain 
ludicrous, but at least here remains in keeping with the anti-logic of the 
rest of the story.
What makes THE BABY a sort of schlocky-campy classic (and surely a billing 
of 'Strange Film Festivals' everywhere) is its admirable disregard for 
reason.  You can't find holes in a story if there is no rational framework 
for them to exist in.  Nothing makes sense: characters do terrible things 
and earn no repercussions; Baby is an adult but still hasn't figured out how 
to step over the two-foot wall of his play pen; similarly, unless Baby has 
been castrated there's no reason for him to speak in a baby's voice (this 
very grating effect is dubbed in); and I don't see how can it be possible 
for any person in Baby's situation, irrespective of mental ability, not to 
be capable of learning a few words of English  - even kids raised by wolves 
learn to growl, for heaven's sake.  You won't be able to avoid asking 
yourself questions while you're watching, either - for example, what kind of 
babysitter would want to change a grown man's diaper? (not one I would feel 
comfortable trusting, that's for sure).  Manzy gets his expression of infant 
obliviousness down pat, but you have to wonder what was happening between 
takes - he was probably rightly figuring that his career was beginning and 
ending with this assignment.  I don't even want to contemplate the 
attraction this film might have amongst fetishists.  Everyone else should 
see it at least once.


Title
Review for Sands of the Kalahari (1965)
A chartered plane makes a forced landing in the Kalahari desert,
stranding its six passengers (five men and one woman) on a rocky
outcrop in the middle of nowhere.  Gripping, existential adventure
borrows from Nietzsche and Darwin - it is unlike any other survival
story you will have probably seen.  It seems at first that the
survivors in this case will not have to struggle too hard to stay
alive - they find shelter, food, and water less than a day's hike from
the downed plane.  Nor do they seem concerned about possible search
parties or rescue attempts.  But then the group dynamics set in. 
Susannah York, the only female, is the most obvious catalyst for
unrest among the other survivors.  In a godless world a leader must
emerge to take charge - and a mate.  It's plain that we're meant to
make the connection between the group of people huddled together among
the rocks and the tribe of baboons that also colonize the outcrop. 
The survivors are back at the dawn of humanity (this film will make
you think of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), living in a cave (with
pre-supplied paintings), hunting animals, and competing for dominance
in their habitat.  That they have intruded upon the baboons' domain is
clear: the apes are always seen from high up on the rocks, staring at
the people below, barking harshly and baring their fangs.  Humans are
right back down near the bottom of the food chain.  As O'Brien (Stuart
Whitman), the most energetic of the group, tells them, they are
nevertheless equipped for survival because they are more intelligent. 
But O'Brien has a feral quality that doesn't stay hidden for long. 
"He's the only one of us who belongs here,"  York says early in the
piece.  It's a signpost remark, and a little too pat, as are other
observations tossed off by the characters, who voice ideas and themes
in the movie as if they were supplying answers to an essay question on
it.  
There is still plenty to think about afterwards, nonetheless: are
characters meant to be thought of as villains because they are more
capable of survival than others?  Sturdevan (Nigel Davenport) behaves
like an absolute pig mere moments before he casually decides to
undertake a dangerous journey that may save the others; the oldest
member of the group (Harry Andrews), whose scientific knowledge
provides much reassurance for the others, turns out to be have been a
soldier working for the Nazis; and while we condemn O'Brien's
cold-blooded, methodical exploitation of the everyone else in the
group it's easy to forget that it was he who rescued their only
survival equipment from the burning wreckage of the plane.  Lastly,
there is York, the character we associate most strongly with
civilization (she's even named Grace), who at first only wants love
but then gives in to her sexual desires.  She doesn't become as
independent and assertive as we would hope. Theodore Bikel and Stanley
Baker round out the rest of the survivors.  With so much individual
discrepancy it's not surprising that we rarely see the same two
characters playing scenes together.  Their constant interchange is a
useful device to keep the pacing of the film brisk. This, and the
effective location shooting, makes the story very watchable - you
won't be expecting the provocative ending.

Title
Review for King Rat (1965)
Even those who don't like war movies are bound to enjoy George Segal's
assured performance as Corporal King in this adaptation of James
Clavell's novel.  Events take place in a Japanese-run POW camp in
Singapore towards the close of WWII.  Refreshingly, this film is not
about escape, or attempted escape - as the prologue states, it is a
story of existence within the camp itself.  Opportunistic King enlists
the services of British prisoner Peter Marlowe (James Fox) after
learning that he can speak Malay.  A bond forms between the two,
though its worth is not revealed until the film's end, when we see
their friendship more as a natural countermeasure against the
unwelcome attention of Lt. Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp's provost
marshal.  Grey is a strictly by-the-book one-man law enforcement
operation who divides his time between maintaining order in the camp
and staking out King's money-making scams, waiting to pounce on him at
the first opportunity.  He rightly believes in his own integrity but
fails to recognize the same quality in the other, less disciplined,
inmates of the camp.  Grey can't see that each POW has their own way
of dealing with their situation, or that his is to try to create
reason out of chaos. 
The camp struggles within a frail system of law and order: everyone
demands justice, revenge, compensation, a deal.  The Japanese seem
just as caught up in the power game as everyone else - control becomes
a shuffle of reports, reprimands, and reprisals.  In this environment,
a hustler like King is sure to thrive, just as any resourceful rat
would.  While the film refers to prisons within the prison (Grey's
jail, the cages beneath the American barracks, the cell they "hire" to
get some privacy), it is the prison within themselves that confines
the men most.  It seems obvious in the case of the repressed provost
marshal, the careworn, numbed surgeon, and the diversionary denial
that several prisoners indulge in, but King is perhaps the most
trapped of all.  "Before this,"  he says of the war, "everybody had it
made except me".  For him, the end of the war is a more pressing
concern than it's continuation: he believes that the Japanese will
kill all their prisoners before surrendering; Grey has vowed to get
even with him when the war is over; and a liberating soldier intimates
an investigation into his activities after the evacuation.  King will
no longer be king.
Subject matter sounds depressing, but KING RAT is actually quite funny
in places (particularly the sequences about a makeshift school lesson
and a secret dinner held for King's friends) and the dialog crackles
whenever Grey is at odds with King or Marlowe.  Courtney and Fox
couldn't be better in their roles.  Performances are first-rate all
round, from John Mills and Denholm Elliott right down to bit parts
like Leonard Rossiter.  John Barry wrote the elegaic score; Bryan
Forbes directed from his own screenplay.

Title
Review for Big Bus, The (1976)
     Larry Cohen took a break from his offbeat horror tales to co-write
this James Frawley directed vehicle (pun intended), a parody of the
disaster movies boom that surfaced in the mid-seventies.  The big bus
itself is the pride of the Coyote (not Greyhound) fleet, a
nuclear-powered luxury transit vehicle that is about to make its
inaugural run non-stop from New York to Denver.  Add to this the
following  plot ingredients:  a driver haunted by an incident from his
past, a collection of eccentric passengers, a disaster which sends the
vehicle out of control ... it's easy to see the similarity between THE
BIG BUS and the 1980 disaster spoof AIRPLANE! (actually, there's only
two minutes difference in their running times).  While I find both
films funny, the disconnected, rapid-fire gags of AIRPLANE! have been
recycled too often by the slew of similar 'zany' takeoffs that it
spawned to make it any longer unique--which leaves THE BIG BUS the
more distinctive of the two, by default.
     Joseph Bologna, Stockard Channing, and John Beck, as the principal
crew of the bus, have to play their roles fairly straight, leaving most
of the laughs to their oddball passengers, ably represented by--among
others--Richard Mulligan, Ruth Gordon, and Rene Auberjonois (he's a
cynical priest who beats the elderly Gordon to a window seat and smirks
"Where is your God now, old woman?").  Nobody has a particularly big
role--except for the bus, which really is big - but the 'star-studded'
cast of familiar faces is one of the conventions of disaster movies
that writers Cohen and Fred Freeman have stuck to.  They have also
incorporated into the plot elements of other notable disaster
flicks--specifically AIRPORT, AIRPORT '75, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (!),
and even a touch of EARTHQUAKE--though what's more interesting is their
choice of subject.  The film-makers obviously noticed the trend in
these movies to place frightened-but-resourceful passengers together on
any number of calamity -bound vehicles.  Along with the planes and
ships of the previously mentioned titles, these hapless casts have had
their lives endangered by  trains, airships, and even rollercoasters.
A big bus was all that was left.  This is, of course, absurd.  The
film's level of humor reminds me of a MAD magazine movie send-up
(Illustrator Jack Davis was even called in to design the movie poster)
and from what I've seen, its amiable, silly approach will be enjoyed by
early teens more than adults.  At least the producers didn't feel they
had to resort to cheap innuendo and "comic" violence.

Title
Review for Wonderwall: The Movie (1969)
This 60s 'head' movie flopped when it opened in theaters and would have 
vanished into obscurity had it not been for the instrumental soundtrack by 
George Harrison which kept it known for several years (a re-edited version, 
including a restored opening track by Harrison, was released in cinemas 
three decades later).  In keeping with the Beatles connections, Dutch design 
group The Fool (who also painted the wondrous wall on the Apple Boutique 
building) was hired to create artwork and fashions for the film.  WONDERWALL 
also has writer Gerard Brach (a longtime favorite of Polanski) and 
actress/singer Jane Birkin on board to help it earn cult status.
Jack MacGowran stars as a mousy professor (coincidentally, he had played a 
professor in Polanski's/Brach's THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS the previous 
year) who analyzes water samples and lives in a cramped apartment which 
looks like it is made up mostly of walls.  The monotony of his daily routine 
changes when he discovers a small hole through which he can peer into the 
apartment (a great set!) of neighbor Birkin.  The images he sees intrigue 
him and soon all his time is spent watching the room next door.  WONDERWALL 
is less concerned with a story than it is about an event and observes it 
with as much detachment as MacGowran studies the bacteria under his 
microscope.  The characters are as two-dimensional as the wall that 
separates them, their only purpose being to play out the film-makers' ideas. 
  But if this is so, then what is the idea being conveyed in WONDERWALL, if 
any?  Is it that old 60s saw that we all build barriers around ourselves 
that need to be broken to attain total freedom?  Does it suggest that drugs 
can enlighten one's consciousness? (one character, who appears in a fantasy 
sequence as 'LSD' is quite happy to discover that MacGowran has sugar cubes 
he can borrow).  I don't think filmgoers need to dig for a message to 
endorse WONDERWALL - it's enough that the film was pretty much overlooked in 
the era it was made and the cultural capital invested in it years later 
reclaimed it iconographically.  In other words, the main reason to see 
WONDERWALL 'now' is because it is a film that could only have been made 
'then'.
That's the extent of my affection for WONDERWALL, but I would have preferred 
to see the film go further than it does.  Why not let MacGowran demolish the 
wall with a vengeance so he can launch himself into the alternate universe 
he sees behind it?  In spite of its trippy feel, the basis of the storyline 
is surprisingly conservative.  MacGowran's visions look like photo shoots, 
which don't seem out of place when you remember that Birkin's character is a 
fashion model.  In fact, the whole thing is more than likely hallucination 
on his behalf.  Even something like a small hole in a wall becomes an avenue 
of escape from his dingy apartment - through it he hears music, inhales dope 
and entertains all manner of fantasies.  The early PSYCHO reference (stuffed 
birds, the appearance of 'Mother", and a guilty MacGowran crouched at the 
peephole spying on a girl) serves little point unless it's meant to tip us 
off that MacGowran is unhinged from the outset.  Interestingly, because what 
MacGowran sees is fanciful we don't think of him as a voyeur.  And besides, 
we don't really see him getting any gratification - at the end of the film 
he's just where he was at the beginning, making the whole exercise seem 
pointless.  I think, however, that like any scientist (quantum physicists 
excluded) MacGowran's character  knows that to achieve true results he is 
permitted only to observe, and nothing more.  At the point in the story when 
he finally stops viewing and starts interfering, the consequences are 
significant.  In short, he has broken a precept that has been fundamental to 
his work routine - in fact, his life - and that is enough to create some 
form of liberation, even if it is one that can't be seen outwardly.  It 
might not be our idea of a happy ending, but it's good enough for him.

Title
Review for Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)
Writer-director John Hughes was about the best thing to happen to
teenage audiences in the 80s.  His smart, focused characters were a
far remove from the jocks, bimbos, and nerds that usually dominated
teen-oriented fare.  I'm not as taken with FERRIS BUELLER as its
legions of fans, but I can see why it's so popular.  Its simple
wish-fulfilment storyline is appealing not only to the high school
seniors it targets but just about anyone who looks back on their
graduating years with fondness.
Basically, Chicago high schooler Ferris (Matthew Broderick) decides to
skip an exam and takes his two best friends Cameron (Alan Ruck) and
Sloane (Mia Sara, who has nothing to do in her role) along for the
ride.  Film is set in the same limited timeframe of several other
Hughes pictures and stays frothy and upbeat for most of the way until
his trademark teen angst infiltrates - via Cameron, the proverbial
skeleton at this feast - and brings the story back down to earth.  I
think this is one of the bad calls of the film, mainly because we've
seen it in most other Hughes productions of the period - this time I
would have liked to see Hughes follow his main character's advice and
take the day off himself.
My major reservation, however, is that there seems to be no reason why
we should accept Ferris as the big wheel on campus that he is made out
to be, especially when we only ever see him in the company of two of
his friends.  Other than to infuriate his sister (Jennifer Grey) there
is no real purpose for this hero-worship that I can find.  Clearly, we
are meant to accept Ferris on face value, which is why he addresses
us, the audience, throughout the movie.  He is part philosopher, part
guru, part Renaissance Man (how many teenagers know all the words to
'Danke Schoen', for example?) who can appreciate everything from ball
games and Ferraris to art exhibitions and the Beatles.  Matthew
Broderick makes Ferris an engaging character - as written, he would be
difficult to play without being smug or coy - and gets us on his side.
But hes just too infallible.  Ferris is so assured and thorough that
we never fear he is in any danger of being caught by truant-hating
principal Jeffrey Jones.  Furthermore, he avoids all confrontation by
'remote control', i.e. the meticulous preparation of tape recordings,
phone calls, answering machines, prop dummies, intercoms, computers,
and keyboard samplers.  Without these conflicts there is no tension -
I realize that this is the point of course, and that Bueller's 'day
off' also includes not having to deal with authority figures, but
there should have been more moments like the finale (when he has to
think fast and act on his feet) that might have given us the chance to
appreciate his quick-wittedness first-hand.
Broderick is at his funniest when playing the part of the loving son
to his parents, but the comic highlights come mainly from his nemesis
Jeffrey Jones: he and Hughes have wonderful timing together.  I also
love the way Hughes incorporates diegetic musical cues (upon the
mention of a character's name, upon the closeup of a face) to often
hilarious effect.  Overall, film has a relaxed, kick-back-your-heels
feeling to it: it's like driving along the road listening to one of
your favorite songs on the radio.  Hughes eventually weaned himself
off directing and turned to writing-producing instead.  A short-lived
TV series FERRIS BUELLER followed four years later - I'm one of the
few who liked it better than the movie.

Review for Big Wednesday (1978)
John Milius' cult favorite is awash with his usual buddy-bonding and
rites of manhood, but presents us with characters that are more
engaging and sympathetic than those in several of his other works. 
Story looks at four episodes in the lives of a trio of friends over a
period of twelve years.  Jan-Michael Vincent, William Katt, and Gary
Busey are believable as a group of L.A. surfers who grow up through
the sixties and witness the changes in each others lives.  As you
would expect from a Milius film, the men take center stage while their
lovers (Patti D'Arbanville and Lee Purcell) are merely bit players,
relegated to responding to each of the surfers' successes, failures,
and desires.  But what are wives and girlfriends compared to your
friends, who will stick with you - as surfboard craftsman Bear puts it
- through hell (Vietnam) or high water (the seasonal swells).
Milius plays off masculine iconography (beer, fistfights, cars, guns,
surfing, war, stripshows) against Bruce Surtees' subdued photography
and Basil Pouledouris' pensive musical score.  For this reason I
believe BIG WEDNESDAY imparts quintessential elements of the male
psyche more persuasively than Milius' other gung-ho action pictures. 
Also, it's a pleasant surprise to see him siding with characters who
are dedicated draft-dodgers.  Final episode of film, which should be
seen in a cinema for best effect, has a big, mythic feel to it.  Of
course Milius, a former lifeguard and surfer himself, has been aiming
for this all along: Jan-Michael Vincent's character is the archetypal
Legend in His Own Time, a latter-day Beowulf contesting the fury of
the deep; he and his friends enter their patch of the beach by a
ruined stairway that looks like the remains of an ancient temple;
Vincent's surfboard is passed on to him (in the manner of a sword or
any other powerful token) by a master craftsman who has foretold the
'Big Day' when it must be used; the three friends paddle into the
roaring ocean to brass fanfares, as if they were entering a joust. 
Was it any surprise that Milius would go on to direct CONAN THE
BARBARIAN after this?  Well-made film has the power to appeal to both
surfers and film buffs.
