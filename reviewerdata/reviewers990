Review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)
A film review by Aileo Weinmann - Copyright Š 2000 filmcritic.com
How the Grinch Stole Christmas (a film which should otherwise need no
introduction whatsoever) reminds me of that strange Christmas feeling
that hits about five minutes after all of the presents have been
opened.  It's that indescribable longing for more, even if nothing's
really missing.  There's so much expectation, so much buildup, that
somehow even though you're satisfied, it's not quite enough.
Jim Carrey is fabulous as the titular Grinch, that much is sure.  His
trademark physical antics fit "the mean one" perfectly, without stealing
the heart from one of Dr. Seuss' most notorious characters.  He proves
that he's up to the tall order of balancing two larger-than-life
personalities: himself and the Grinch.  The delicate mix that Carrey
strikes -- giving just enough of himself to the role without
obliterating the creature in the process -- is really the beauty of his
performance.
Overall, the film stays true to the message of Dr. Seuss' original 1957
story and the 1966 animated version, although there's a good deal of
stretching required to make it feature-length.  In this version, from
high atop Mt. Crumpit, the original killjoy is positively disgusted with
all the Whos in Whoville and their happy buzzing in preparation for
Christmas.  So he decides to go incognito to town, in an attempt to
muddle things up a bit, where he runs into Cindy Lou Who (Taylor
Momsen), who's struggling with her own doubts over the true meaning of
Christmas.  Intrigued by this chance encounter, Cindy Lou embarks on a
mission to discover The Grinch's past, interviewing all the Whos who've
known him and filling in a childhood that Dr. Seuss left up to our
imaginations.
At this point, the film rejoins the familiar tale, albeit dressed
spectacularly in computer animation and with the minimum number of
mature references to keep parents entertained.  With wonderful costumes
and sets made of pure fantasy, The Grinch should leave most viewers
feeling warm and fuzzy.  The only thing you shouldn't expect is to be
surprised, which I must admit I was kind of hoping for.

Review for Light It Up (1999)
[filmcritic.com presents a review from guest writer Aileo Weinmann.  You

http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/8323d4a70a47a4a3882568260009e241?OpenDocument
LIGHT IT UP smolders and spits out some smoke, but no fire.  The film
treads lightly on the volatile crossroads where disenchanted inner city
youth meet the desperate state of urban public education.  A la HIGHER
LEARNING, the prevailing simplification of issues concludes with empty
and confusing platitudes in answer to some complex stuff.
Queens, New York  it's about as bad as it can get at Lincoln High.
Almost nobody has textbooks, snow is blowing through broken windows in
dilapidated classrooms, and student favorite Mr. Knowles (Judd Nelson 
THE BREAKFAST CLUB, FROM THE HIP) was just fired for no good reason by
heavy-handed Principal Armstrong.  When Officer Dante Jackson (Forest
Whitaker  THE CRYING GAME, JASON'S LYRIC) struggles to detain gifted
student artist `Ziggy' Malone on bogus charges, Lester Dewitt (Usher
Raymond) takes matters into his own hands by seizing the Officer's gun
and taking Jackson hostage.  Now barricaded against the New York Police
Department, the basketball star Lester, the artist `Ziggy,' along with a
student council member, a punk-rocker, a hustler, and a gang banger have
to figure out what they are standing for.
Lester and the other students ultimately attempt to use their newfound
leverage to demand improvements for a decent education.  They use e-mail
to rally support from the community and dispel allegations by the media
that they are nothing but violent gang vigilantes.  As negotiations
fail, the stakes for Lester, the other students, and Officer Jackson
escalate.  The dramatic climax centers around whether loss of life can
be avoided as the NYPD closes in without meeting Lester's conditions.
Some may contend that LIGHT IT UP does well to leave its audience
frustrated with incomplete answers; after all, there are no easy
solutions to the problems it examines.  On the other hand, it seems
irresponsible to present such radical actions and then gloss over the
consequences in this incomplete fashion.  Call me old school, but I'd
rather `light it up' with a pint of JD than a ticket to this show  at
least a hangover usually has a few decent stories to go with it.

Review for American Movie (1999)
[filmcritic.com presents a review from guest writer Aileo Weinmann.  You
can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/1327fde39a3e33218825682e0025cae9?OpenDocument
Got a serious appetite for life?  Prepare to gorge yourself on AMERICAN
MOVIE's all-u-can-eat buffet of reality.  This documentary's menu:
Destiny, Failure, Family, Friendship, and enough Humor to warrant
bringing a pack of Rolaids for that warm feeling that will invariably
creep up from your gut straight into your heart.
Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin  Mark Borchardt (himself) is a man possessed
by a desire to make movies, budget black & white horror flicks, to be
precise.  After facing the reality that his current project won't get
done before he gets funding, Mark shifts his focus to making money by
finishing his previous film.  Titled Coven, it's about a
substance-abusing writer whose spiral leads him to a self-help group
that is less than supportive.  As Borchardt struggles through continuous
and severe setbacks, the audience comes to understand and care deeply
about his passion.  He is so charismatic that there may be a temptation
to attribute the power of this story to his charm.  Greater than this,
however, is his tenacious determination at what he says is the critical
juncture in his voyage.  With the financial backing of his 82 year-old
Uncle, seemingly inexhaustible loyalty of his friends and mother, and
(quite) a few beers, Mark's core of pure energy just might be enough to
fuel a victorious journey  it's certainly sufficient to infuse the
audience with inspiration.
Then there's Mike Schank (himself)  musician, (very) recently reformed
drug user, and source of some of the best laughs of the year.  Friends
with Mark since childhood, Mike is as true as they come.  He's the kind
of person who has somehow managed to hold on to that simple but profound
wisdom often attributed to children, that usually leaves us as soon as
we stop telling the truth all of the time.
In an odd sort of way, AMERICAN MOVIE gave me the same kind of
satisfaction that comes from really good down home cooking; neither
needs false pretense to make you happy.  In fact, it was so good, I'm
thinking about going back for seconds.

Review for Big Tease, The (1999)
filmcritic.com presents a review from staff member Aileo Weinmann.
You can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/59d470566965c60188256875000b31e5?OpenDocument
A film review by Aileo Weinmann  Copyright Ó 2000 filmcritic.com
Director:    Kevin Allen
Producer:    Kevin Allen, Philip Rose, Sacha Gervasi, Craig Ferguson
Screenwriter:   Sacha Gervasi, Craig Ferguson
Stars:     Craig Ferguson, Frances Fisher, Mary McCormack, David
Rasche, Chris Langham
MPAA Rating:    R
Year of Release:   1999
Cut, Curl, Crimp, Color.  THE BIG TEASE is a mockumentary tracing
flamboyant gay hairdresser Crawford Mackenzie's (Craig Ferguson  THE
DREW CAREY SHOW) unlikely journey from Scotland to Los Angeles in his
quest to win the World International Hairdressing Federation's (WIHF)
Platinum Scissors Competition.  The adventurous bumbling begins when
MacKenzie mistakes a form letter  asking him to be part of the audience
 for an invitation to compete against three of the world's top
stylists, including his idol and the reigning Platinum Scissors holder
Stig Ludwiggssen (David Rasche).
Accompanied by filmmaker Martin (Chris Langham  BBC's KISS ME KATE),
Mackenzie travels to LA, where he plans to finally claim the artistic
recognition and fame that his small Scotland hometown can't offer.
(Except for that time he got to dry Sean Connery's toupee after it fell
into some water on a golf course).  Upon arriving in California, he
kicks up his kilt and happily takes advantage of what he assumes are
complimentary hotel amenities, only to wake up to the reality of a maxed
out credit card.  His passport now held collateral on his outstanding
charges, he proceeds to WIHF headquarters, expecting to clear up the
confusion and get reimbursed.  Unfortunately, WIHF President Monique
(Mary McCormack) is not about to pick up the tab for Mackenzie's
misunderstanding, nor does she plan to allow him to enter the
competition.  Undaunted, the remainder of the comedy unfolds in his
search of any and every way to gain entry in the prestigious contest.
Antics include befriending celebrity promoter Candy Harper (Frances
Fisher), calling on Sean Connery (to return a favor), and visiting a
testosterone-oozing Senator whose company sponsors the WIHF event.
Ferguson plays the eccentric hairdresser with finesse  he's silly and
endearing in his portrayal of destiny to attain the coveted Platinum
Scissors.  Chris Langham does a fine job with his feeble character,
providing a constant if not invisible sidekick for Mackenzie.  Frances
Fisher is great in her role as Mackenzie's compassionate and determined
advocate, demonstrating her versatility, in contrast with more serious
roles in films like TITANIC, UNFORGIVEN, and TRUE CRIME.  Cameo
performances by Drew Carey, David Hasselhoff, Cathy Lee Crosby, and John
Paul DeJoria (a.k.a. John Paul Mitchell, stylist extraordinaire) are
sprinkled to provide that true Hollywood feel.
Overall, THE BIG TEASE holds no real surprises, but the culminating
scene is outrageously over-the-top and doesn't disappoint.  Although the
mockumentary format was strained and became somewhat annoying at times,
it's not enough to kill the general cuteness and entertainment of the
production.  Zany characters, bigtime costumes and an originally absurd
premise (a world championship of hairstyling ?!?) offer as many smiles
as I remember from spinning around in the chair at the barber shop.

Review for Drive Me Crazy (1999)
[filmcritic.com presents a review from guest writer Aileo Weinmann.  You
can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/eee2c32a6b0cf955882567fe000718d5?OpenDocument
Traffic advisory: plan alternate box office route to bypass DRIVE ME
CRAZY and gridlock of crazed teens.  At the screening I attended, it
would have been easier to find a share of internet IPO stock than an
open seat (I doubt the stingiest broker you know could be more ruthless
than the giddy girls saving seats for their friends).  If this romantic
comedy is successful, chalk up another victory for marketing and another
loss for pop culture.
A more appropriate title for DRIVE ME CRAZY would be `Highway Through
Nebraska'  the plot is flat, has no turns, and is completely devoid of
scenery.  At least this boring ride only lasts 90 minutes.  In this
rehashed tale of teen angst, next door neighbors Nicole Maris (Melissa
Joan Hart  CAN'T HARDLY WAIT, `Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,' `Clarissa
Explains It All') and Chase Hammond (Adrian Grenier  CELEBRITY, THE
ADVENTURE OF SEBASTION COLE) are neighbors with almost nothing in
common.  She's `in,' he's in the alternative crowd.  When the star of
the basketball team snubs her affection and he gets dumped, they find
common ground in a plot to scam everyone into thinking they are an
item.  If the plan works, they hope their ex-loves will come crawling
back.  Hmmm, care to take a wild guess what happens?
Chase Hammond did a fair job with his role, though the performances as a
whole were barely lukewarm.  Susan May Pratt's depiction of Nicole's
backstabbing friend provides a mild respite from DRIVE's many pitfalls,
including a soundtrack starring The Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears.
If you want to relive the adolescent experience of feeling trapped in a
situation you think will never end, DRIVE ME CRAZY can take you there.
Unfortunately, this is a result of the film's painfully slow and obvious
development, awkward performances, and completely unoriginal script.
Even Clarissa can't explain how a movie this bad made it to the screen.

Review for L5: First City in Space (1996)
[filmcritic.com presents a review from guest writer Aileo Weinmann.  You
can find the review with full credits at
http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/03095c15a1e715098825682d0020b9fa?OpenDocument
A film review by Aileo Weinmann  Copyright ? Aileo Weinmann
What should you expect from an IMAX? 3D film about a future space colony
where 10,000 people live while orbiting Earth?  Turns out, very little.
Hokey animation, overdone and often-pointless sound effects, and a story
that feels like an after-school special combine to create an overall
waste of time and the IMAX? experience.  In short, this is a huge
disappointment for anyone expecting a realistic glimpse into the future
of space colonization.  Although publicity promises wildly creative
computer graphics combined with data from NASA, L5 delivers more like
Buck Rogers meets Nickelodeon.
Set 100 years in the future, the film is narrated in by Chieko (voice of
Martha Henry), a seven year-old girl (played by Rachel Walker) native to
the flourishing colony.  A brief history of space exploration includes
the sole thrill of a slow motion shuttle launch from the Kennedy Space
Center as only IMAX? can deliver.  After an overview of L5 that is
devoid of any detail or serious scientific facts/processes, the story
quickly turns to a mission to save the colony from a water shortage.
Sound disjointed?  Yep.
Chieko's grandfather (Colin Fox) plans to solve the crisis by attaching
a rocket to a water-filled comet that can be used as a reservoir once
its path is altered to orbit L5.  When the rocket jams, however,
Chieko's father (Denis Akiyama) must embark on a daring  maybe absurd
is more accurate  voyage to land on the comet and fix the problem.
Mind numbing suspense, happy ending, cheesy last words, yawn, `Glad
that's finally over' as the lights come up.
Basically, L5 is a children's movie pitched to an older crowd in the
hopes that space enthusiasts will be sucked in by the gravity of IMAX?'s
enormous screen.  Unfortunately, neither audience will be satisfied by
this half-baked attempt to stretch 45 out of maybe 10 minutes of
worthwhile material.
