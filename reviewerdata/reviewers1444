Title
Review for Bamboozled (2000)
Directed by Spike Lee, from his screenplay. Starring Damon Wayans, Savion
Glover, Jada Pinkett Smith. Running time: 135 minutes. Rated R for
offensive language throughout by the MFCB. Reviewed on February 1st, 2001.
Some of the best -- and undeniably most provocative -- movies of the past 
half-century have studied the problem of racism. In American cinema, most 
(though, certainly, not all) of these works have dealt with prejudice 
against the black community, and one of the most successful purveyors of 
these films has been Spike Lee. "Bamboozled" is Lee's newest treatise on 
the subject, and this time around he has pushed the envelope one step 
further by examining bigotry toward African Americans not just from white 
people, but from black individuals as well. And in concert with this, Lee 
looks at the way people respond to what they see on television -- how the
medium itself can help what was once controversial, and even obscene, 
become an easily-accepted part of our culture.
Lee's key character is Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans), a black 
programming executive for a fictitious American network. Lee clearly sets 
up Pierre to be a person who, if he is not ashamed of his race, at least 
has set himself apart from it. Not only has he changed his name to make it 
sound upper-crust and distinctly non-black, but he speaks in such a 
bizarre, affected accent that even his own father questions him about it. 
With their ratings floundering, Pierre is charged by his boss (Michael 
Rapaport) with coming up with a new show to appeal to the underserved 
black population -- something which veers away from the formula ensconced 
by "The Cosby Show" and its imitators. (One of the questions Lee poses is 
why all black-centered programmes are sitcoms. This isn't strictly true -- 
"New York Undercover", from "Law & Order" creator Dick Wolf, was a 
moderate success on FOX in the mid-Nineties and featured a mostly black 
and Hispanic cast -- but Lee's point is valid all the same.)
In response, Delacroix invents a show designed to thrust the topic of 
racism back in the public spotlight by indulging in that very thing. 
Christening it "Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show", Delacroix 
envisions it as a modern update on the black exploitation vehicle of the 
mid-nineteenth century. He recruits two street performers, Manray (Savion 
Glover) and Womack (Tommy Davidson) to star in the programme: Manray will 
play the eponymous Mantan while Womack portrays his pal, Sleep 'n Eat. 
Amongst the supporting cast are such offensively named characters as 
Honeycutt and Aunt Jemima. And the racist ingredients don't end there: 
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat live on a watermelon plantation, are lazy and out 
of work, steal chickens, and generally indulge in every stereotype 
imaginable. Even more obscenely, all the actors in "Mantan" wear blackface
(Delacroix insists Manray and Womack make their own make-up, just like 
their forebears did a century and a half earlier). And yet, despite the 
show's heinous content, "Mantan" quickly becomes a nationwide hit, a 
success which presages serious ramifications for all those involved.
"Bamboozled" starts off very well. The audacity of Delacroix's idea is 
both frightening and compelling, and the burgeoning success of "Mantan", 
flying in the face of all common sense, is at once fascinating and 
horrifying. Within weeks, the concept of actors wearing blackface changes 
from an appalling taboo to a national craze -- amongst all demographics -- 
demonstrating the effect television can have even on our deepest-held 
beliefs. The implication is that if something is on TV then it's okay, no 
matter how bigoted it might really be. And this laissez-faire attitude
toward racial injustice applies not just to white viewers but black 
viewers as well, who seem heedless of the fact that the racism is 
targetted directly at them.
At the same time, Lee draws an intriguing parallel between the minstrel 
shows and the modern-day "gangsta rap" scene. One of the instrumental 
figures in "Bamboozled", played by Mos Def, is the brother of Delacroix's 
assistant Sloan (Jada Pinkett Smith) and the leader of an aggressive band 
called the Mau Maus. Lee's assertion is that bands like the Mau Maus do 
not tout African American rights but instead simply reinforce every 
negative black stereotype prevalent today: that they're violent, thieving, 
sex-crazed, hostile to everyone who isn't African American. In this way, 
suggests Lee, gangsta rap and related musical genres are scarcely 
different from the old minstrel shows. The trappings might be different, 
but the effect on public perception is the same.
It is the collision of "Mantan" and the Mau Maus that forms the climax to 
"Bamboozled". But unfortunately, this is also where the film runs out of 
steam. Having established such a thought-provoking premise, having posed 
so many intriguing and worthwhile queries, Lee ends up tossing it all 
aside in favour of a predictable, monotonous and gratuitous finale which 
hardly matches the invention of the movie's first hour. Instead of 
approaching his themes like a master workman, Lee takes a sledgehammer to 
them. At this stage, "Bamboozled" also loses sight of its characters and 
instead resorts to tedious, melodramatic shenanigans. Particularly 
ill-served is Pinkett Smith, whose astute characterisation in the first 
reel steadily deteriorates as the film winds on.
And this is disappointing, because it wastes both a great concept and some 
fine acting. Wayans is magnetic as the maladroit Delacroix, a unique 
character who manages to be intriguing and repugnant at the same time. 
Rapaport is very funny as Delacroix's boss, Dunwitty, a man who believes 
himself to be so in touch with African American culture that he tells 
Delacroix, "I'm blacker than you are," and yet thinks nothing of spouting 
a racially-motivated slur at his underling.
Lee is clearly trying to bring some great ideas to the fore here, and is 
on the verge of making a truly memorable film about racism; that the 
picture fails so badly in the end does not diminish this potential. If 
nothing else, this movie demonstrates that Lee has by no means run out of 
steam when it comes to this subject. But "Bamboozled", sadly, will go down 
as a lesser entry in the director's filmography.

Title
Review for Bring It On (2000)
Directed by Peyton Reed. Screenplay by Jessica Bendinger. Starring Kirsten
Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Gabrielle Union. Running time: 98 minutes. Rated PG
for mild language by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 28th, 2000.
Here we have it: "Bring It On", the first feature film targeted at ten
year-olds with the sensibilities of an adult. Or maybe at adults with the
mindset of a ten year-old; frankly, it's hard to tell. Either way, "Bring
It On" is an uncomfortable melding of an After-School Special plot with
distinctly mature humor. It's not quite paedophilia, fortunately, but at
times it comes disturbingly close. Whereas movies like "American Pie" are
up-front about their attitude toward sex and profanity, "Bring It On"
couches its mature content in a maudlin, juvenile storyline. Who is this
film aimed at? The swearing and sensuality is clearly not for the young.
The story will bore anyone out of knee socks and pigtails. "Bring It On"
tries to appeal to all demographics, and in doing so becomes a peculiar
hybrid suitable for none.
Torrance "Tor" Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is the new captain of the
cheerleading squad at Rancho Carne, a high school in a well-to-do San
Diego neighbourhood. Although the school football team is a perpetual
disaster, the cheerleaders are champions, having placed first in the
Nationals for five years running. The squad looks set for another easy
victory until new recruit Missy (played by Eliza Dushku, the psychotic
Slayer Faith on TV's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") realises that all their 
routines have been cribbed from the cheerleaders of East Compton High in
urban San Diego. Tor is faced with having to develop an entirely new set
of cheers in just three weeks, before the big showdown with East Compton
and its captain, Isis (Gabrielle Union), at the National Championships.
"Bring It On" reads like a litany of teen-melodrama cliches. There are, of
course, the snobby white girls and the hip but poor black girls. There's
Tor's unfaithful college boyfriend and the new boy who's perfect for her
-- if it weren't for the misunderstandings which keep them apart. There's
the leadership challenge Tor must endure, and the inevitable climactic
meet which will decide everything. Oh, and let's not forget the
syrupy-sweet conclusion in which all wrongs are righted, and everybody
goes home happy.
But most damning of all is the fact that, for long stretches of time,
"Bring It On" just isn't funny. Partly this is because the filmmakers seem
uncertain about whether they're making a satire or a serious movie, and so
the jokes just cease while they go about advancing the plot. And partly 
this is because the raunchy humor is such a poor fit with the general
attitude of the picture. Several jokes aroused only uncomfortable chuckles
from the audience during the screening I attended, accompanied by much
squirming and shifting in the seats. Scenes in which the cheerleaders
parade about in their underwear, or one in which a male cheerleader
"inadvertently" lets his fingers slip while holding up a pantie-less
female cheerleader, sit uncomfortably next to the simple moralising of
Jessica Bendinger's screenplay.
Indeed, "Bring It On" feels like a movie which underwent a major rethink
halfway through production. I'm not sure if it started out as a sharp
pastiche on cheerleading which was subverted into something more
homogeneous, or if it was originally just a standard kids' movie
later spiced up to bring in the adults. Without a doubt, I would have
preferred either to the end result.
To be fair, there are some good moments. For example, a sequence in which
a desperate Tor hires a professional choreographer to discipline her
troupe is a lot of fun, as the dancer (Ian Roberts) proceeds to tear apart
each and every member of the Rancho Carne squad. Dunst manages to preserve
her natural charm despite the poor quality of her material. She makes a
real effort here, but she's fighting an uphill battle and just can't make
the movie succeed on her own. Dushku is also very good, although the
script never really finds anything for Missy to do after her introduction
as a rebellious gymnast. She spends the rest of the film acting like
Dunst's shadow, the third wheel in the romantic subplot involving Tor and
Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford).
Less laudable is the movie's treatment of the East Compton squad. Their
appearances are so brief that none of them benefit from any character
development whatsoever, not even Gabrielle Union's Isis. This is
unfortunate because when she is on screen, Union demonstrates a real
presence, and I was hoping to see more of her. Further, the flimsy
portrayal of the East Compton troupe ensures that their rivalry with the
Rancho Carne cheerleaders is all but devoid of tension or excitement. It
is difficult for the audience to get excited about a competition when one
side is virtually unknown.
Also unimpressive is Peyton Reed's pedantic direction. Whereas movies of
this sort often excel at showcasing their subject material, if nothing
else ("Center Stage"'s exposure of ballet is a good recent example),
"Bring It On" does cheerleading no real favours. Despite the energy and
enthusiasm of the cast, their routines are filmed in a dull and
commonplace manner. As much time is spent on sending up the sport as it
is on portraying the real trials and tribulations it incurs. There is
little in "Bring It On" to suggest that cheerleaders are, as Roberts'
choreographer puts it, anything other than "dancers who have gone
retarded".
An ill-conceived motion picture from start to finish, "Bring It On" is one
of those rare films which isn't just dull or insipid, but is occasionally
embarrassing to watch. Only some lively performances save this from the
scrap heap of the truly dreadful. "Bring It On"? Do us all a favour --
please, don't.

Title
Review for Evolution (2001)
Directed by Ivan Reitman. Screenplay by David Diamond, David Weissman and
Don Jakoby, based on a story by Jakoby. Starring David Duchovny, Orlando
Jones, Julianne Moore. Running time: 104 minutes. Rated PG for frightening
scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 27th, 2001.
Synopsis: When a meteorite crashlands in the Arizona desert, community 
college professors Ira Kane (Duchovny) and Harry Block (Jones) are first 
on the scene. They discover that an alien lifeform has arisen from the 
rock and is evolving at an amazing rate. Soon the army, advised by Dr 
Allison Reed (Moore), moves in and forces Kane and Block out. But when the 
aliens begin to menace society, it may take the scientists' combined 
efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another 
lifeform: humanity.
Review: "Evolution" certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy. 
It's directed by Reitman, clearly trying to parlay his "Ghostbusters" 
success into a twenty-first-century counterpart. It stars Duchovny, and 
although one might question his judgment in lampooning his "X-Files" 
character so soon after leaving the TV series, it should certainly provide 
him with plenty of ammunition. And then there's Moore, who may not have 
much prior experience in comedy, but who has certainly proven her ability 
as an actress. A shame, then, that it all deteriorates into such a 
hopelessly unfunny morass. "Evolution" is a movie more concerned with its 
special effects (which are quite good) than anything resembling a 
consistently funny script. It has its moments (a scene in which Jones' 
body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining), but there are 
embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour. Moore is 
totally wasted, her clumsy shtick getting very old, very fast. Duchovny 
has stunningly little in the way of material to work with. And the story 
is so formulaic, it could have been written by monkeys. Part of what made 
"Ghostbusters" so wonderful was a combination of a great script and 
characters the audience could root for. "Evolution" is so mind-numbingly 
tedious that it's difficult not to start cheering for the aliens.

Title
Review for Hannibal (2001)
Directed by Ridley Scott. Screenplay by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian,
based on the novel by Thomas Harris. Starring Anthony Hopkins, Julianne
Moore, Giancarlo Giannini. Running time: 134 minutes. Rated AA for blood 
letting by the MFCB. Reviewed on February 19th, 2001.
I admit, I had some concerns about "Hannibal" heading into the theatre. 
Thomas Harris' novel of the same name (unread by me) was hardly a critical 
darling, and neither "Silence Of The Lambs" director Jonathan Demme nor 
Clarice Starling originator Jodie Foster -- in many ways the lynchpin of 
the earlier movie -- were returning for the new installment. Sequels are 
often a mixed bag, anyway: for every successful follow-up such as "The 
Godfather Part II", there have been dozens of odious imitators like "The 
Lost World".
As a sequel to "Silence" and as a movie in its own right, "Hannibal" falls 
somewhere around the upper middle of the pack. Certainly, it is very 
different from its predecessor -- whereas that film was a taught, 
atmospheric thriller, "Hannibal" tends toward dark comedy. "Silence" 
boasted a superb, absorbing plot; "Hannibal" is almost entirely a 
character piece, with a patchwork story which primarily exists as a 
showcase for the title cannibal. And make no mistake, this movie is 
entirely owned by the murderous Hannibal Lecter, played once again by 
Anthony Hopkins.
When last we saw him at the end of "Silence", Lecter had escaped custody 
and fled to Europe. "Hannibal" picks up the story a decade on, with Lecter 
masquerading as the interim head of a Florence art museum. Investigating 
the disappearance of the museum's previous director is the 
unfortunately-named Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), who soon 
uncovers the truth about Lecter's identity. Rather than bring his 
suspicions to his police superiors, however, Pazzi keeps the knowledge to 
himself, hoping to capture Lecter and win the substantial reward offered 
by American millionaire Mason Verger (Gary Oldman).
Verger, it transpires, was the only survivor of Hannibal's original 
killing spree. A paedophile, Verger had been placed in Lecter's 
psychiatric care, only to suffer abhorrent tortures at the murderer's 
hands, resulting in his gruesome disfigurement. Verger wants revenge on 
Lecter, and has secretly engaged the services of FBI lawyer Paul Krendler 
(Ray Liotta), who puts him in touch with Agent Clarice Starling (now 
played by Julianne Moore). Starling has problems all her own: a drug bust 
gone wrong has threatened her entire career. As Verger draws the threads 
of his plan together, it is only a matter of time before Hannibal and 
Clarice meet once more.
As good as Foster was in "Silence", few people will dispute that it was 
Hopkins' portrayal of Lecter that was the most memorable aspect of that 
much-laurelled film -- despite the fact that he was on-screen for less 
than one-fifth of the running time. In "Hannibal", Hopkins takes centre 
stage, and his performance is more than up to the challenge. Lecter is 
truly a quintessential movie villain, up there with Darth Vader and Bela 
Lugosi's Dracula. Despite his atrocities, no matter how inherently 
reprehensible his bloody lifestyle, Lecter is charming and captivating. If 
you had to be eaten by a fellow human being, is there anyone you'd rather 
have devour your kidneys than Hannibal the Cannibal?
Much of the attraction of the character comes from the deep conviction 
Hopkins brings to the role. Yes, by traditional human morality, Lecter is 
a monster. But, in Hopkins' hands, Hannibal is lifted beyond such 
pedestrian mores: he is a law unto himself, adhering to his own beliefs in 
spite of society. Even his murders have their own perverse logic and 
nobility. In some ways, then, he is a classic anti-hero (albeit as warped 
an anti-hero as they come), a man who refuses to let petty strictures 
deter him from how he wants to live his life. Consequently, it is 
difficult not to admire Lecter's clarity of self; add to this his 
gentlemanly demeanour and you have a perfect role model (well, if only he
didn't kill and devour people).
So engrossing is Hopkins' performance that all else pales in comparison. 
Particularly ill-served is Clarice, who is even more of a secondary 
character here than Hannibal was in "Silence". It is not surprising that 
Foster turned down the picture, which barely develops the character beyond 
her earlier appearance. Moore's version of the role is at best 
serviceable, but it seems clear that this is the fault of the script and 
not the actress.
Oldman does what he can with Verger, but his madman is doomed to toil in 
the shadow of Hannibal. So firmly ensconced is Hopkins in his role that 
Oldman simply cannot compete. Similarly, Giannini is never entirely 
satisfying as Pazzi -- the character lacks substance and motivation, and 
his ultimate fate is so clearly telegraphed that it is difficult to feel 
much connection with him.
But maybe that's entirely intentional. Rather appropriate to the European 
setting which dominates its first half, "Hannibal" is a rare Hollywood 
example of Grand Guignol, the late-nineteenth century French theatrical 
tradition of comedies thick with rape, murder and deeds equally heinous. 
Given how firmly established Hannibal's culinary preferences are in the 
minds of the audience, director Ridley Scott and scriptwriter Steven 
Zaillian (David Mamet authored an earlier, discarded draft) mine them for 
a number of creepy laughs. This builds up to a truly revolting -- yet 
somehow uncomfortably funny -- climax which will, I expect, cause the
cancellation of any number of dinner parties in the next few weeks.
But, for all the Grand Guignol trappings of "Hannibal", Zaillian and Scott 
have otherwise forgotten to give the movie a real sense of story. There is 
a disjointed, episodic feel to events: even the aforementioned dinner 
scene feels like a tacked-on coda rather than a natural development of the 
plot. As a result, "Hannibal" possesses none of the atmosphere of 
"Silence", and for all its gross-out moments is nowhere near as scary.
Were the movie theatre a circus, "The Silence Of The Lambs" would be the 
centre ring. "Hannibal", on the other hand, would be the freak show just 
outside the main tent -- watchable and even mesmerising in its own right, 
but not something that will have stayed with its audience ten years later.

Title
Review for Gift, The (2000)
Directed by Sam Raimi. Screenplay by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson.
Starring Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves. Running time: 112
minutes. Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on February 25th, 2001.
I enjoy a lot of different kinds of films, but none more so than the scary 
ones. There are few things more satisfying than sitting in a darkened 
theatre and feeling my heart pounding in my chest, sweat beading on my 
forehead, each breath coming just a little bit faster as the action on the 
screen unfolds. Being startled so much that I actually jump back in my 
seat -- that, to me, is perhaps the ultimate cinemagoing experience. It's 
the surest sign that I'm not just watching the movie, but am completely 
absorbed in it.
These days, sadly, Hollywood tends to favour the more low-brow slasher 
genre. Some of these are enjoyable enough in their own right (I'm a big 
fan of the original "Scream"), but too often they substitute gore for real 
terror, and that's a thrill that's far more ephemeral. Even the occasional 
movie which does harken back to more mature suspense frequently sacrifices 
atmosphere for cod mysticism -- last autumn's "Bless The Child" springs to 
mind.
"The Gift" attempts to reverse this trend. Its setting is a staple of the 
classic American thriller: the Deep South, in this case the backwoods town 
of Brixton, Georgia. Brixton is a place made up of rusted pick-ups and old 
Gothic mansions, murky lakes and gnarled old trees. The denizens are a 
superstitious lot making a pretense of living in modern times: they scoff 
at the unknown, until they have no other choice but to accept it. I was 
most reminded of the excellent but little-seen TV show "American Gothic" 
from the mid-Nineties (indeed, that programme's demonic sheriff, Gary 
Cole, makes an appearance here as a philandering lawyer).
The movie's title refers to the paranormal abilities of a woman named 
Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett). Annie's husband died a year earlier and she 
now supports herself and her three sons by telling people's fortunes with 
the help of a deck of Tarot-like cards. Amongst those who appeal to 
Annie's wisdom are a troubled mechanic (Giovanni Ribisi) and Valerie 
Barksdale (Hilary Swank), who is trapped in a marriage to abusive redneck 
Donnie (Keanu Reeves). When Donnie finds out that Annie has been 
encouraging Valerie to leave him, he threatens both her and her children. 
The local police are little help: not only are they friends of Donnie's, 
but they view Annie as little better than a Satan worshipper.
One evening, Annie and a friend go to the local country club to relax. 
There, Annie meets her son's school principal, Wayne Collins (Greg 
Kinnear). There is an obvious attraction between them, but Wayne is 
already engaged to heiress Jessica King (Katie Holmes), whose status as 
the town slut seems to be no secret at all, except to Wayne. That night, 
Jessica vanishes. Quickly exhausting their leads, the police reluctantly 
turn to Annie for help. Annie begins experiencing visions which help her 
uncover Jessica's grisly fate. But in the process, she puts herself and 
her boys at risk of an equally grim end.
In most good thrillers, the setting is as vital an ingredient as any 
actor, and director Sam Raimi does a fine job of filming his rural locale. 
Nature is filled with unseen menace, and we can readily believe that such 
an environment would have bred a woman like Annie. There is a palpable 
atmosphere in scenes such as one where the psychic wanders outdoors after 
experiencing a horrifying vision. We know that her ordeal is not finished 
yet, but the source of the terror could be anywhere.
Blanchett is in good form as the small-town seer, demonstrating that Annie 
is a normal woman who just happens to have a special talent -- no 
different than if she were a great pianist or a gifted surgeon. She sees 
her "gift" as simply a means to keep her family going. It is interesting 
to observe the role that Annie plays in the community of Brixton. While 
many view her with suspicion, for others she plays the same role that a 
psychiatrist might in a different setting. She doesn't just tell her 
customers' fortunes, but consoles them and advises them: she is as much 
counsellor as clairvoyant.
But despite these promising beginnings, Raimi, working from a script by 
Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson, isn't able to maintain his momentum. 
Things start off far too slowly, for one, as Raimi awkwardly brings his 
player on stage. And then, just when things get rolling, the movie detours 
into a by-the-numbers legal sub-plot, with Annie defending herself and her 
abilities before the courts. The idea of fortune tellers being mistrusted 
and feared is hardly a new one, and "The Gift" does not put a new spin on 
the concept. As a result, this extended sequence is just marking time,
dragging out the proceedings between Jessica's disappearance and its 
ultimate resolution.
Simply put, "The Gift" is too straightforward a story for a feature film. 
There are no real twists and turns, and those that do crop up are obvious 
and predictable. The entire movie is cliche piled upon cliche: the 
would-be frights are standard fare, the plot unravels without enormous 
surprise, and most of the characters are common stereotypes, such as 
Reeves' country redneck and the woefully miscast Holmes' high-society 
trollop. Even a last-minute "Sixth Sense"-like twist has been lifted 
wholesale from any number of old folk tales.
"The Gift" is the sort of movie that probably would have been better off 
as part of an anthology (if Hollywood made those). Cut down to an hour or 
so, with a better balance between the plot and the film's focus on Annie 
as a character, this could have been a nice atmospheric piece. As it is, 
"The Gift" is entertaining in places, but is simply too insubstantial and 
too typical of the genre to succeed as a whole. While it's great to see an 
old-fashioned thriller back in theatres, I don't think it's too much to
expect a few new ideas too.

Review for Pledge, The (2001)
Directed by Sean Penn. Screenplay by Jerzy Kromolowski and Mary
Olson-Kromolowski, based on the novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt. Starring
Jack Nicholson, Robin Wright Penn, Aaron Eckhart. Running time: 125
minutes. Rated AA for bloodletting by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 28th, 
2001.
Synopsis: Retiring detective Jerry Black (Nicholson) becomes involved in 
the case of a murdered girl, and promises her parents that he will find 
the killer. He purchases a gas station on a route he believes the killer 
takes, and there befriends Lori (Wright Penn) and her young daughter. As 
Jerry and Lori fall in love, can he do what must be done to fulfill his 
pledge?
Review: At first, "The Pledge" appears to be just another standard, if 
well-executed, crime drama. It is anything but; in its final hour, it 
turns the corner and becomes a riveting, terrifying study of its lead 
character, Jerry Black. Penn pays attention to all the trappings of the 
serial killer genre, but they are just window dressing. His interest here, 
unequivocally, is Jerry, a man so haunted by his pledge that it consumes 
the entirety of the his existence. At first, we see this only in small 
hints; some of his habits change, for instance, and he suddenly takes up 
smoking in a big way. But then, when Jerry buys the gas station and 
befriends Lori, the true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into 
focus. Nicholson is fantastic, portraying Black with rare subtlety and 
animus; Jerry's gradual descent into obsession is like a car wreck, a 
thing horrible to look at but impossible to turn away from. Penn coaxes 
good supporting performances from much of the rest of his cast, too. Only 
Eckhart disappoints as Jerry's replacement, Stan; he never seems entirely 
convincing, too much a tool of the plot. Penn's direction is astounding, 
each frame looking as though it is parched -- of water, perhaps, or of 
sanity. It all builds up to a shattering, devastating climax which lingers 
uncomfortably in the mind long after the house lights have come up.

Title
Review for Unbreakable (2000)
Directed by M Night Shyamalan, from his screenplay. Starring Bruce Willis,
Samuel L Jackson, Robin Wright Penn. Running time: 120 minutes. Rated PG
for mature theme by the MFCB. Reviewed on November 29th, 2000.
After the success of "The Blair Witch Project", there was likely no bigger
box office story in 1999 than "The Sixth Sense". Opening quietly in
mid-August, writer/director M Night Shyamalan's film gathered enormous
momentum and went on to become one of the ten highest-grossing films of
all time. It made Shyamalan and co-star Haley Joel Osment household names,
and coined one of the year's most popular catchphrases ("I see dead
people").
A year later, Shyamalan's highly-anticipated follow-up effort has arrived
in theatres. Like "The Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable" stars Bruce Willis in a
movie which contrasts the supernatural with the everyday. But unlike its
predecessor -- which was, fundamentally, a ghost story -- "Unbreakable" is
not easily categorised. Its paranormal elements are more subdued than in
"The Sixth Sense", and Shyamalan maintains an unusually moderate -- even
solemn -- tone throughout.
This may disappoint those expecting just another atmospheric thrill
ride: "Unbreakable"'s deliberate and erudite style makes for a very
different cinematic experience. Even more so than "The Sixth Sense", it
demands careful scrutiny to bring it together in the viewer's mind. Both
films tease with twist endings, but whereas "The Sixth Sense"'s was
cathartic, "Unbreakable"'s is devastating. Indeed, "Unbreakable" is
ultimately not as satisfying nor as entertaining as "The Sixth Sense". But
it is nonetheless very good in its own way, and stands out as one of the
most daringly different major releases this year.
Willis plays David Dunn, a security guard whose relationship with wife
Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and doting son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) is
deeply troubled. David's world is thrown into turmoil one day when the
train he is riding goes off the rails. David is the sole survivor of the
tragedy -- and, more eerily still, he bears no injuries whatsoever. Soon,
he starts receiving strange notes: "How many days of your life have you
been sick?"
The messenger is be Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), a comic book gallery
owner who suffers from a rare bone disease. Price's skeletal structure is
extremely brittle -- even at birth,  both his arms and legs were broken.
He believes that, if someone so susceptible to harm as himself can come
into being, there must therefore exist a person who embodies the reverse
-- who is impervious to damage. After years of searching, Elijah has
finally found David, who he believes is this unbreakable man.
If "Unbreakable" could be pigeonholed into a category, it would be the
super-hero genre. In the lingo of graphic novels, "Unbreakable"
constitutes an "origin story", telling how the hero learns about his 
powers and decides to put them to good use. But this is a very perfunctory
description of a film which is, more importantly, a super-hero story
transposed onto the real world. Whereas most movies of the genre (such as
this year's "X-Men") tend toward flashy, colourful, frenetic narratives,
"Unbreakable" dares to ask what would happen if a "super-hero" actually
did come into being. The basic axioms of the origin story are all here,
but Shyamalan has subverted them delightfully. While the "realistic
super-hero story" is not a new concept on the printed page, it is rare to
see it examined in such depth on the silver screen.
Shyamalan handles his material well, but not perfectly. Although the
almost sepulchral mood of "Unbreakable" is clearly intentional, Shyamalan
is not always successful in maintaining viewer interest. There are times
when the sombre timbre which pervades the movie goes beyond servicing the
carefully-constructed atmosphere, and causes "Unbreakable" to appear
simply slow and boring. But, more often than not, Shyamalan's scripting
and direction are sufficiently adept that he can establish such an unusual
tone and still keep the story rolling.
Unfortunately, in doing so, he virtually reenacts the entire structure of
"The Sixth Sense". Like that picture, "Unbreakable" opens with a
flashback; features a vital dynamic between Willis and a young boy, who
investigate occult phenomena; and slowly unveils the true nature of the
protagonist's powers. The picture then takes a detour into a heretofore
untapped subplot to establish the character's new status quo, before
shocking us with a surprise ending. Certainly, Shyamalan can be forgiven
to a certain extent because he has at least managed to envelop this common
foundation in a wholly new and different plot. But his adherence to a
recycled formula is disappointing all the same.
As in "The Sixth Sense", Willis shows that he possesses genuine acting
ability, and has done well to escape the action-movie grind in which he
was once trapped. His performance here is perhaps even more remarkable
because his character's personality is much like "Unbreakable"'s overall
tenor: subdued, elusive, revealed in small touches rather than grand
gestures. This makes it difficult for the audience to establish a rapport
with David, but Willis largely bridges that gap.
Jackson is given much more colour as Elijah, and he makes the best of it
with a wonderfully eccentric performance. Price is the sort of character
one can neither fully warm to, nor entirely reject, and Jackson trades
expertly on this uncertainty. Although his role is less substantial than
Osment's in "The Sixth Sense", Clark does a good job in the no less 
pivotal role of Joseph, continuing to demonstrate that Shyamalan has a
good eye for competent young performers. Similarly, Penn does excellent
work in her secondary but vital part. It is through his relationship with
Audrey that David's basic humanity and realism are established; without
it, "Unbreakable" would have a much more difficult time rising above
its four-colour roots.
Note that this should not be taken as an offhand dismissal of comic books;
on the contrary, some of the past century's great works have borne word
balloons and a six-panel layout. The graphic novel has made great strides
in the past twenty-five years in particular: consider everything from
Moore and Gibbons' "Watchmen" to Busiek and Ross' "Marvels". "Unbreakable"
finally finds a way to effectively translate that evolution to the big
screen.

Title
Review for Scream 3 (2000)
Directed by Wes Craven. Screenplay by Kevin Williamson and Ehren Kruger. 
Starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox Arquette. Running  
time: 116 minutes. Rated R. Reviewed on February 27th, 2000.
By the mid-Nineties, the slasher movie was all but dead, the heyday of 
the "Friday the Thirteenth" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" franchises just 
a distant memory. Then, in 1996, came "Scream". Perhaps not since "Star 
Wars" has a single film so revolutionized a genre. "Scream" was not just 
funny and scary and inventive, did not just boast an eager young cast. It 
exuded a hip self-awareness which both poked fun at and paid homage to 
its bloody legacy.
"Scream" was followed by a slew of imitators, including a sequel of its 
own. But in addition to some questionable casting choices, "Scream 2" 
(1997) failed by falling into some of the very pitfalls it laughed at, 
hewing too closely to the original.
Now comes "Scream 3", the (allegedly) last of the trilogy. This time 
around, series creator Kevin Williamson decided to draft only a story 
outline, handing script duties over to Ehren Kruger. Fortunately, my 
qualms about how this would affect the film's quality proved unfounded. 
While this final "Scream" doesn't match the original for ingenuity and 
suspense, it is better than "Scream 2", and is a good film in its own right.
In the fictional reality of the "Scream" series, the events of the first 
two films -- the serial killings perpetrated by madmen masquerading as 
"Ghostface" -- have been depicted in a pair of horror movies titled "Stab". 
Despite the lack of further Ghostface murders to latch onto, production 
is under way on the third "Stab" installment. Amongst the cast is 
Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), portraying reporter Gale Weathers. Not so 
ironically, Jennifer's boyfriend and bodyguard is Dewey Riley (David 
Arquette), the "real" Gale Weathers' former lover and a survivor of the 
previous murder sprees.
Start-up on "Stab 3", however, has the (unintended?) side effect of 
inciting a new series of Ghostface slayings, and this time the victims 
are "Stab" castmembers. The film is shut down -- to the dismay of hot 
young director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) -- but the body count 
continues to rise. At a loss, police detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick 
Dempsey) asks the real Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) to come to 
Hollywood to assist him. But it soon becomes clear that Ghostface's real 
target is once again Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), living in isolation 
somewhere in California. At the same time, Sidney begins having 
disturbing dreams about her mother Maureen (Linda McCree), the very first 
Ghostface victim.
"Scream 3" shares many similarities with its predecessors, from the 
opening "shock murder" to the utter impossibility of actually guessing  
who Ghostface is this time around. As such, it would be easy to write it 
off as just another clone of the original, and nothing more. But unlike 
"Scream 2", "Scream 3" does things a little differently. In particular, 
Williamson and Kruger take advantage of the Hollywood setting to comment 
not just on the nature of "trilogies" (perhaps realizing that there 
simply isn't much to say: movie trilogies are rare, and horror trilogies 
rarer still) but on thriller filmmaking in general.
The movie is also peppered with cameos which are as hilarious as they are 
unexpected. There are a number of clever in-jokes for the observant: the 
"Stab" actors, for example, are named after the current crop of young  
stars, like Freddie Prinze and Angelina Jolie. And some of the unpopular 
decisions of the previous movies are addressed, as with "Stab" actor 
Tyson Fox (Deon Richmond), whose character Ricky is an intentionally 
transparent replacement for Randy (Jamie Kennedy), killed off in the 
second "Scream"/"Stab" installment.
Returning stars Campbell, Arquette and Cox slip back into their roles 
comfortably. Unlike the first two movies, though, it is the latter pair 
who take the spotlight for much of "Scream 3". They do so ably, hamstrung 
only by a break-up at the start of the film which is never properly 
motivated and comes across as a very obvious plot device. Like any movie 
dominated by young actors, the rest of the cast is uneven. Posey does a 
great job aping Gale Weathers (and hence Cox) and Jenny McCarthy, as 
Sarah Darling, seems to have fun sending up her own public image. But 
Scott Foley is wooden as Roman, seemingly able to sustain only a single 
emotion per scene, and Emily Mortimer, who plays acting ingenue Angelina
Tyler, never really finds her groove.
As usual, "Scream 3" builds up the suspense deftly, weaving the mystery 
of Maureen Prescott's past with the usual Ghostface murders. The deaths 
are, for the most part, satisfactorily inventive (one sequence involving 
a fax machine is particularly fun) and the identities of some victims are 
sure to come as a surprise. It is unfortunate, though, that the movie 
doesn't abide by its own criticism of the genre and repeatedly dumbs 
down its characters to ensure they are in a position to be attacked. This 
is particularly galling when "Scream" veterans like Dewey and Gale start 
splitting up needlessly.
But these things are, in some ways, to be expected; while it would be 
nice to see a horror film rise above such cliches, it is hard to fault 
"Scream 3" for staying true to its roots. More disappointing is the 
movie's "surprise ending", which is not much of a surprise at all to 
anyone with a working knowledge of common literary twists. Indeed, after 
guessing the direction in which "Scream 3" was heading, I found myself 
hoping that I would be completely blindsided, as with the ingenious 
revelation of the second murderer in "Scream".
Alas, it was not to be: the movie ends in a manner which is neither 
without merit nor entirely satisfactory. Walking out of the theatre, I 
found myself pleased with the decision to make this the last "Scream". 
The trilogy has been good (sometimes even great), but I think it has 
played itself out. It's time for the Ghostface costume to go on the shelf 
next to Jason's hockey mask and Freddie's clawed glove, and the screaming 
to end once and for all.

Title
Review for Family Man, The (2000)
Directed by Brett Ratner. Screenplay by David Diamond and David
Weissman. Starring Nicolas Cage, Tea Leoni, Jeremy Piven. Running time:
124 minutes. Rated PG for mature theme by the MFCB. Reviewed on December 
27th, 2000.
Charles Dickens did it first, of course, and also did it best. His 1843 "A 
Christmas Carol" was, to my knowledge, the earliest major work in which a 
character finds redemption and turns his life around after witnessing 
other lives and times -- some real, some merely possibilities. Next came 
Frank Capra's classic 1946 film "It's A Wonderful Life", which spun the 
concept only slightly by having as its protagonist a truly good man, who 
is shown what the world would be like if he never existed.
"The Family Man" is another slight variation on the themes embraced by 
Dickens and Capra. The main character this time around is Jack Campbell 
(Nicolas Cage), who is a bit of a cross between Ebenezer Scrooge and 
George Bailey. Jack is "a credit to capitalism" according to his boss -- a 
pragmatic businessman who handles multi-billion-dollar mergers and his 
latest romantic conquest with comparable skill. Things could have been 
different. In 1987, Jack left his college sweetheart, Kate (Tea Leoni), 
for an internship in London. Despite his promises, he never returned.
But Jack is not a bad man. On Christmas Eve, he intervenes in a 
convenience store hold-up, talking the culprit (Don Cheadle) out of the 
store. During their conversation, Jack professes that he is missing 
nothing from his life, which gets a rise out of the would-be robber. The 
next morning, Jack wakes up to discover his life has changed. Somehow, he 
has been married to Kate for the past thirteen years, has two kids and a 
dog, and sells tires for a living. Again encountering the man from the
convenience store, Jack learns that he is being given a glimpse of the 
life he could have led, for reasons he is supposed to figure out for 
himself.
"The Family Man" hews predictably close to the structure laid out by 
Dickens. Jack is initially hostile toward his fate, refusing to accept a 
life of changing diapers, mixing chocolate milk, and hawking the BF 
Goodrich line. Gradually, he warms up to this life, learning that, even 
though his life with Kate is missing many of the perks of his "real" life, 
it is nonetheless richer in more important ways. Where "The Family Man" 
differs from its predecessors is that it is far less obvious how this new
understanding will affect Jack once he returns to his normal existence.
In some ways, this is "The Family Man"'s chief flaw. Unlike Scrooge or 
Bailey, both of whom were heading down indisputably dark paths, it's not 
all that obvious that Jack Campbell needs saving. There is something 
rankling about the film's implicit assertion that, because his life is not 
middle-America-perfect, Jack has made poor decisions. Sure, his existence 
might not be ideal, but it's not so terrible either. It leaves one to 
wonder why Cheadle is wasting his time with somebody like Jack when there 
are other people in the world in far more desperate need of divine 
intervention.
But despite its clunky execution, "The Family Man" resonates with 
undeniable warmth. Despite the thematic problems it creates, the movie's 
refusal to paint Jack as a Scrooge-type villain creates a refreshingly 
original feeling. This is not simply "A Christmas Carol" (or, for that 
matter, "It's A Wonderful Life") all over again, but an altogether 
different take on the concept. Jack is neither a blackguard nor a hero, 
but a regular guy caught in a seemingly untenable situation.
As a result, there is a certain authenticity to the scenes of Jack 
becoming accustomed to his parallel life. His relationship with "his" 
children, his attempts to engage in interests he himself never possessed 
(bowling, for example), and the occasional intrusions of his actual life, 
all strike a genuine chord. It's enough to make you wonder how we might 
react under comparable circumstances. By the end of Jack's "glimpse", the 
movie has convinced us that this other life is the ideal Jack should have 
been striving for, even if, objectively, that is not necessarily the case.
A large part of this is due to the splendid performances by Cage and 
Leoni, who demonstrate terrific on-screen chemistry. They make it clear 
that Jack and Kate are meant to be together, no matter what sacrifices 
had to have been made to accomplish it. One of "The Family Man"'s true 
delights is the slow revelation of all the little things that make this 
parallel life so gifted -- alternate-Jack's wedding anniversary surprises, 
for example, or the circumstances under which he came to work at the tire 
store. It is difficult not to be moved by Jack's gradual realisation of 
his deep, long-denied love for Kate, and this makes the viewer's knowledge 
of the impermanence (as Cheadle puts it) of Jack's experience all the more 
lamentable.
The screenplay, by David Diamond and David Weissman, has plenty of charm, 
even if it does occasionally indulge in its share of kitsch. A predictable 
scene in which Jack tries to change the baby's diapers, for example, is an 
excursion into unnecessarily sitcom-level humour which mercifully does not 
go on for too long. For the most part, though, Diamond and Weissman do a 
good job of balancing comedy and drama. They also successfully maintain 
the reality of Jack's alternate life, not demanding too much suspension of 
disbelief in the way other characters react to Jack's strange behaviour. 
Helmer Brett Ratner is even-handed in his direction, rarely letting the 
movie get too corny and providing some beautifully touching moments as 
well.
Sentimentality is a tough thing to pull off in movies. Handled well, it
can make for a memorable cinemagoing experience. Handled badly, the result 
is often a thoroughly rotten work of film. "The Family Man" is not 
perfect -- it certainly won't supplant "It's A Wonderful Life" as a staple 
of holiday viewing -- but it is one of the more successful sentimental 
films in recent memory. It's a movie that's difficult to watch without 
smiling, frequently. To do otherwise would be positively, well, 
Scrooge-like.

Title
Review for Bossa Nova (1999)
Directed by Bruno Barreto. Screenplay by Alexandre Machado and Fernanda
Young, based on the story "A Senhorita Simpson" by Sergio Sant'Anna.
Starring Amy Irving, Antonio Fagundes, Alexandre Borges. Running time: 95
minutes. Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on November 11th, 2000.
"Bossa Nova" is a movie so trite, it feels as though it got lost on its
way to the Brazilian version of "Must See TV". That it wastes some good
performances and touching scenes -- as well as an all-too-rare sensitive 
depiction of middle-aged romance -- makes the experience all the more
exasperating. Although it serves moderately well as a feel-good picture,
"Bossa Nova" is ultimately not dissimilar from a night spent carousing in
Rio: a dim impression of amusement, fading rapidly from the memory.
Amy Irving, wife of director Bruno Barreto, stars as Mary Ann Simpson, an
American teaching English in Rio de Janeiro. She becomes the object of
affection of contract lawyer Pedro Paulo (portrayed by prolific Brazilian
actor Antonio Fagundes). At the same time, Pedro is defending his father
Juan (Alberto de Mendoza) against litigation by his fourth ex-wife, which
may mean the loss of Juan's beloved tailor shop. Also employed at the
tailor shop is Pedro's half-brother Roberto (Pedro Cardoso), who is 
smitten with Pedro's pretty new intern Sharon (Giovanna Antonelli).
Meanwhile, amongst Mary Ann's other students are soccer star Acacio
(Alexandre Borges), who is developing an unhealthy interest in his teacher
while preparing to move to London with his gregarious manager Gordo
(Sergio Loroza), and the lonely Nadine (Drica Moraes). Nadine, trying to
encourage the solitary Mary Ann to meet someone, introduces her to the
world of Internet romance. Nadine herself has been involved in an online
relationship with a New York artist named Gary, and is trying to work up
the courage to visit him. She is encouraged in this endeavour by her
travel agent, Tania (Debora Bloch), recently divorced from none other than 
Pedro Paulo.
It is true that the existence of so many characters, all so completely
intertwined, strains at one's sense of belief. But within the confines of
this kind of movie, it is not in of itself an object of criticism -- it is
part of the grammar of this type of romantic comedy, which relies on the
timeworn gambits of mistaken identity and misunderstood dialogue to garner
laughs and propel the storyline. Indeed, "Bossa Nova" becomes even more
incestuous as it progresses -- for example, Pedro Paulo and Acacio develop
a strange sort of semi-rivalry, which leads to Acacio becoming a client of
Pedro's, which results in Acacio getting involved with Sharon, which means
that he and Roberto have also become inadvertent rivals.
Other films have utilised similarly unlikely set-ups and mined them for
great laughs. But the screenplay for "Bossa Nova", by Alexandre Machado
and Fernanda Young, is only fleetingly funny. More often than not, the
comedy is the sort reserved for short-lived network sitcoms, such as a
painful sequence where Nadine goes to apply for a visa and quickly talks
herself into trouble until Tania makes the rescue. And then there's the
appearance by Stephen Tobolowsky's geeky Trevor, who inexplicably insists
on referring to Pedro Paulo by the groan-inducing Anglicisation "Peter
Paul".
When "Bossa Nova" succeeds, it is usually when it concentrates on the
central relationship between Mary Ann and Pedro Paulo. Although the
plethora of competing subplots prevents this romance from being anything
but cursorily explored, it is a touching and effective pairing which
makes good use of the skills of both Irving and Fagundes. There is a
superb scene, for instance, where Pedro takes Mary Ann's measurements
thoroughly, without touching her or otherwise arousing her suspicions,
while they ride in an elevator, and then puts his long-dormant tailor
skills to use in making her a blouse. But even here the movie undercuts
itself: the blouse scene over with, it appears Machado and Young had
little idea what else to do with the concept, and quickly skip to the
inevitable result of Pedro's secretly sending it to Mary Ann.
There is too much going on in "Bossa Nova", and none of it receives the
attention it deserves. A subplot involving Tania and her Chinese lover is
almost criminally underexploited, such that it appears to exist only to
keep Tania from Pedro for a long period of time.Several characters receive
so little development that it is difficult to feel any reaction to the
unfolding of their respective story arcs. This is especially true of
Sharon, who flip-flops back and forth between Roberto and Acacio seemingly
at whim, without any clear motivation (in a cute touch, her backpack
changes shape to reflect her current allegiance).
Beyond Irving and Fagundes, only Borges and Loroza stand out. Although
neither has much to do individually, they do make for an amusingly 
arrogant double act. Although she looks very good, Antonelli never finds
her groove as Sharon, and feels awkward and out of place; the same can be
said of Tobolowsky. Others simply seem to be filling space. Consider
Cardoso and Bloch, for example, whose final fates are so offhandedly
treated that they come across as mere plot facilitators.
Director Barreto at least keeps the pace of "Bossa Nova" moving, such that
only a few scenes seem to go on well past their sell-by date (a
fortuitous accomplishment, giving the paucity of much of the humour).
But Barreto is also too preoccupied with showing off the beauty of Rio.
Right from the opening shots, Barreto allows his depiction of the
landscape to become gratuitous. And, ironically, sequences where he could
really show off the territory to good effect -- like Mary Ann's daily 
forays into the ocean -- are so tightly lensed as to be almost
claustrophobic.
Also disappointing is the incidental music by Eumir Deodato. Given the
movie's title, one could be forgiven for expecting a riveting and 
attractive bossa nova score. But Deodato's compositions are generally
tedious and sleep-inducing, and the music never becomes the crucial
ingredient that the filmmakers seem to be trying to set up. Indeed,
Deodato's score is perhaps emblematic of "Bossa Nova" as a whole -- not
really bad, in fact occasionally alluring, but for the most part simply 
failing to be at all interesting.

Title
Review for Almost Famous (2000)
Directed by Cameron Crowe from his screenplay. Starring Patrick Fugit,
Kate Hudson, Billy Crudup. Running time: 126 minutes. Rated AA for coarse
language by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 9th, 2000.
"Almost Famous" is the sort of movie that really shouldn't work as well as
it does. The coming-of-age film is as overused a genre as any, seeming
pretty much tapped out. But "Almost Famous" does work, splendidly.
Writer/director Cameron Crowe has fashioned a semi-autobiographical piece
which, although adhering broadly to the expectations of the genre, has a
genuine, honest quality to it far outstripping its usual coyness and
artificiality.
Certainly, the closeness of Crowe to his subject matter is important to
the success of the film. Like William Miller in "Almost Famous", Crowe was
a teenaged reporter for music trade paper "Rolling Stone" in the 1970s. It
is not hard to imagine that he found himself in situations similar to many
of those depicted in "Almost Famous". While there has no doubt been some
manipulation for dramatic effect, Crowe has managed keep things
authentic. As a result, instead of a young character drifting through
clumsily-staged set pieces, "Almost Famous" features a young character on 
a believable journey. He is transformed and matured not in great bounds
but subtly and gently, almost without our realising it.
William (Patrick Fugit) is a preternaturally intelligent fifteen year-old.
William's university professor mother, Elaine (Frances McDormand),
struggles to nurture her son while protecting him from the vagaries of the
world. Her efforts have already driven away William's older sister Anita
(Zooey Deschanel), the last straw being Elaine's condemnation of rock and
roll (grabbing a Simon and Garfunkel album, she points at their eyes and
intones, "Pot"). Anita, though, leaves behind her record collection for
William, and this leads to his burgeoning interest in the rock scene and a
meeting with famed critic Lester Bangs (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman;
Bangs is a real person, one of several actual industry figures populating
the movie).
Bangs' encouragement of William's writing leads to a commission from
"Rolling Stone" editor Ben Fong-Torres, ignorant of William's age. With
Elaine's grudging permission, William goes on tour with up-and-coming band
Stillwater. Originally intending to spend only a few days with the group,
William soon finds himself going cross-country in pursuit of his story.
Along the way, he cultivates relationships with a number of unusual
people, including Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and
an elusive follower, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).
The crowning glory of Crowe's script is his characters. There is not a
throwaway role to be found; every individual is well considered and the
casting is universally inspired. Newcomer Fugit is a real find. William
could easily have come across as a pencil-necked geek or a precocious
naif, but Fugit hits all the right notes in all the right measures. His
William is unusually talented and uncommonly sheltered, but that selfsame
intelligence breeds adaptability. William is sensible enough to recognise
the cutthroat nature of the music scene: to Stillwater he is "the Enemy",
and while the band occasionally forgets that, William does not. He is an
innocent, but he is by no means stupid.
Also terrific is Hudson as Penny, William's tour guide of sorts in his
odyssey. Penny Lane, we learn from the end credits, was inspired by a real
person, but she seems as much derived from Elton John's "Tiny Dancer" --
"pretty-eyed, pirate smile". (It is probably no mere coincidence that this
song plays during one of the movie's more cathartic moments.) Penny is an
enigma, but a mostly benevolent one, and Hudson clearly delights in her
complex mannerisms and motivations.
Crudup is well-cast as Russell, and plays particularly well off Fugit and 
Jason Lee, who portrays bandmate Jeff Bebe. Russell is a musician
ill-prepared for fame, and consequently he seems sometimes arrogant,
sometimes carefree, sometimes self-destructive, sometimes simply lost.
Bebe, Stillwater's front man, accuses him of trying to usurp his authority
(Russell is supposed to be "the guitarist with mystique") but this not
entirely intentional on Russell's part. He is as much finding his way as
William -- and perhaps more so, because William can at least avoid the
limelight.
Finally, McDormand does a terrific job as the put-upon Elaine, struggling
with her dual responsibilities of encouraging William's interests while
shielding him from harm. Having already lost one child, Elaine abhors the
thought of repeating her mistakes, but at the same time is unwilling to
simply throw William to the wolves. Her inner conflict is in some ways the
movie's most absorbing.
Crowe has also assembled an excellent supporting cast, including Hoffman
as William's mentor (obviously having fun with his words of wisdom -- his
musings on the role of the critic and the reason why he's always home when
William calls are hilarious, but still ring true), Deschanel as the
rebellious Anita, and Fairuza Balk and Anna Paquin in small roles as
Penny's fellow "Band Aides".
Crowe's pacing is terrific, giving exposure to not only William's 
experiences but also the crises facing Elaine, Russell, Penny and others.
Not unexpectedly, Crowe has assembled an enjoyable soundtrack of Seventies
music (plus some Stillwater "originals") but this does not interfere with
the movie; it sits in the background for the most part, adding to the
ambiance.
Indeed, Crowe's only misstep is a clunky scene set on an airplane.
Intended to spark emotional climaxes between many of the characters, it
feels intrusive -- all the more so because the rest of the film is so
wonderfully un-stagy. This may have been intended as a parody of the many
aviation incidents which pepper rock history (certainly, there is a sharp
strain of satire running through "Almost Famous") but it is too
heavy-handed at such a critical juncture of the story. Even a bit of
levity at the end feels awkward.
Even this miscue cannot detract from the movie as a whole, however.
Wonderfully written and acted, "Almost Famous" is an incredibly 
entertaining and moving film, the sort of moviegoing experience which is
to be treasured long after the house lights go up. This is the best movie
of 2000 so far.

Title
Review for Beyond the Mat (1999)
Directed by Barry W Blaustein. Screenplay by Blaustein. Starring Terry
Funk, Mick Foley, Jake Roberts. Running time: 101 minutes. Rated AA by the
MFCB. Reviewed on July 4th, 2000.
Pro wrestling, for me, has always been kind of like a traffic accident -- 
you don't really want to watch, but you just can't look away. I was a big
fan of the World Wrestling Federation back in the mid-1980s. These were
the days when Hulk Hogan was king of the ring, Andre the Giant was a
feared presence lurking in the background, and one of the WWF's biggest
heels (that's wrestling parlance for "villain") was -- wait for it -- an
Elvis impersonator.
I eventually grew out of wrestling, and for a decade I didn't really pay
it much attention. But the WWF (and its lesser-known competitors, the WCW
and ECW) have been increasingly hard to ignore in recent years. The action
is riskier, the characters sleazier, and the sexual innuendo almost
palpable. Wrestlers parade across the screen in the company of
enormously-endowed women, make profane gestures at the audience, shove
soiled underwear in their opponents' faces, and generally behave like
raving savages.
I consider myself a fairly discriminating viewer. I detest programmes that
insult my intelligence and flaunt gratuitous violence and sex. So why do I
find myself anticipating word of the latest WWF shenanigans? Why do I sit
in front of the tube and watch people pummel each other with any object at
hand? Witness choreographed posturing so exaggeratedly scripted as to
utterly defy suspension of disbelief? Good questions.
Barry Blaustein, the director of the new wrestling documentary "Beyond The
Mat" -- the first documentary shown in St John's theatres in my memory,
and quite possibly ever -- seems to be wondering these things too, 
although he never confronts the answer directly. Instead, Blaustein's film
is more of a travelogue, taking us from a sort of "minor league"
wrestlers' training school, to the WWF itself, to the careers of wrestlers
past their prime. It gives the documentary a somewhat lightweight feel,
but the subject matter is bleak enough that this might not be such a bad
thing.
Blaustein focuses mainly on three wrestlers. There's Terry Funk, a fifty
year-old grizzled veteran of the ring. We follow Funk as he visits his
doctor, and witness the x-rays that so tellingly demonstrate the effects
of his career on his health. His knees are devastated, and the doctor
sounds almost incredulous when he wonders that Funk isn't already in
extreme pain.
Then there's Jake "The Snake" Roberts, who was one of wrestling's big guns
when I was young. Roberts' career has taken a turn for the worse, as an
addiction to crack cocaine has caught up with him. Now he earns his keep
wrestling no-name jobbers in small towns, trying to support his habit. The
change between Roberts in and out of the ring is striking. In front of the
audience, he's almost the wrestler of old, working the crowd like a
master. Out of the limelight, he's a haunted, broken man. We learn of his
tragic past, including abandoning university for wrestling to earn the
love of his ex-wrestler father.
Most telling of all is Roberts' hesitant, detached reunion with his
estranged daughter. His only defense against her charges that he was never
there when she was young? That he had to wrestle, two dozen times or more
a month. If he had taken three months off to be with his family, WWF
President Vince McMahon would have had him fired. There are many careers
which take people away from their families for extended periods of time.
How many virtually hold them hostage in doing so?
But "Beyond The Mat" doesn't just dwell on wrestling's dark side. The
third featured wrestler, Mick Foley, clearly loves the game as much as
anyone could. We see him battering his body mercilessly, punishing himself
more than most of us could bear -- and survive it not just intact, but
grinning. At the time "Beyond The Mat" was taped, Foley was one of the
biggest draws in the WWF (he has since retired due to mounting injuries).
His charisma and enthusiasm leap off the screen.
But even this is tempered by scenes involving Foley's young son and
daughter. Before a big match, Foley reminds them that it's all just an
act, and the other wrestler -- the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) -- doesn't really
hate him. But when the Rock beats Foley with a steel chair over and over
and over again, his children still cry, and his even his wife looks on in
abject terror. When Blaustein shows Foley this footage, the wrestler is
uncharacteristically subdued. That he regrets what he puts his family
through is undeniable. But, as he himself says, if he didn't wrestle what
would he do?
"Beyond The Mat" is not a perfect film. Blaustein lingers too long on some
subjects. There is an overlong depiction of Funk's farewell bout, for
example, made all the more pointless by the revelation that he returned to
wrestling just months later. Some topics are glossed over or ignored
altogether -- for instance, the topic of women in wrestling merits just a
few soundbites from the wrestler known as Chyna (Joanie Laurer), and is
rather glibly assessed. Blaustein also neglects such popular controversies
as the death of Owen Hart, the betrayal of Hart's brother Bret by McMahon,
and the allegations of sexual impropriety by ex-wrestler Sable (Rena Mero).
But maybe what this points to is that there is more going on outside the
frame of the weekly wrestling programmes than can be contained in one
documentary. Certainly, Blaustein has more than enough material for
"Beyond The Mat II".
I noticed that the promotional poster for "Beyond The Mat" loudly declares
this to be "the movie Vince McMahon doesn't want you to see!" That's
because McMahon has forbidden the airing of the movie's trailer during WWF
broadcasts. But is this a genuine move to counter what I guess McMahon 
sees as negative publicity, or just a ploy for media attention? Where
wrestling is concerned, who can say?

Title
Review for Quills (2000)
Directed by Philip Kaufman. Screenplay by Doug Wright, based on his play.
Starring Geoffrey Rush, Kate Winslet, Joaquin Phoenix. Running time: 124
minutes. Rated R for graphic sexual content and explicit nudity by the
MFCB. Reviewed on August 28th, 2001.
Synopsis: Committed to an asylum, the Marquis de Sade (Rush) continues to 
publish pornographic literature, aided by young maid Madeleine (Winslet). 
Abbe Coulmier (Phoenix), who runs the hospital, disapproves of the 
stories, but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure. De Sade's craft 
and life are threatened when the Emperor dispatches Dr Royer-Collard 
(Michael Caine) to stop the Marquis' work, permanently.
Review: "Quills" is an exploration of the Marquis de Sade: his madness, 
his cruelty and his perversion, his obsession with sex in any form, no 
matter how obscene. But "Quills" also details the Marquis' determination: 
to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path, and to propagate his 
words to the masses. The extent to which de Sade is willing to go to 
practise his trade is amongst the movie's most intriguing elements, as 
when de Sade scribes a story in his own blood, or narrates a tale via of a 
chain of fellow inmates, cell to cell. To provide a contrast with the 
Marquis, Wright involves him with two very different characters. One is 
the Abbe, a handsome, charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by 
his oath to God. The Abbe lusts for Madeleine, but it is the wizened 
Marquis who is able to have her. And then there is Royer-Collard, a 
hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the Marquis' motley 
creations. Rush is splendid as de Sade, utterly inhabiting the character. 
Kaufman's direction is fine, and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre 
humour to the grim proceedings. The plot itself is rather mundane and 
plays out unsurprisingly, but this is virtually unimportant. For two 
hours, "Quills" acquaints us with the Marquis de Sade -- and, more 
frightening still, allows us brief insight into his scatological soul.

Review for Scary Movie (2000)
Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. Screenplay by Phil Beauman, Jason
Friedberg, Buddy Johnson, Aaron Seltzer, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans.
Starring Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Regina Hall. Running time: 86 minutes.
Rated AA for mature subject matter and offensive language by the MFCB.
Reviewed on July 7th, 2000.
How do you review a film like "Scary Movie"? Certainly not on the basis of
plot. The "story" of a spoof is usually just a framework for gags -- to
assess it on that criterion would be like judging a dress on the quality
of the hanger. Acting isn't really all that important either, as long as
the performers possess a certain amount of charisma and some notion of
comic timing. Direction? Virtually irrelevant. Cinematography? Get real.
No, all that matters in deciding whether or not "Scary Movie" is any good
are the laughs. And "Scary Movie" is the first parody I've seen in years
that has laughs in droves. But fair warning first: I'm a big fan of the
"Naked Gun" movies. I enjoyed "Spaceballs". If your sense of humor runs
contrary to my own, this review likely won't apply much to you.
"Scary Movie" started life as two separate screenplays -- "Scream If You
Know What I Did Last Halloween" and "Last Summer I Screamed Because Friday
The 13th Fell On Halloween" -- which were merged into one by director
Keenen Ivory Wayans. Ironically, the final moniker was a working title for
"Scream", the progenitor of the current crop of teen-oriented slasher
films. If you haven't already guessed, "Scary Movie" is a pastiche
of this whole genre. If you've been avoiding these sorts of pictures, you
might want to give this one a pass too, as you might not get many of the
jokes.
The storyline of "Scary Movie" broadly follows the plot of "Scream", with
elements of other films (notably "Scream 2" and "I Know What You Did Last
Summer") thrown in for good measure. We again start off with a Big Star
making popcorn. In "Scream" it was Drew Barrymore (playing "Casey 
Becker"), here it's Carmen Electra (playing "Drew Becker", wink wink). The
phone rings, and sure enough it's a serial killer on the other line,
wearing the same Ghostface get-up as in "Scream". The voice on the phone
wants to know what the noise is. Carmen explains she just farted. The
killer was referring to the popcorn.
Soon Carmen is racing through the house and across her lawn. She comes to
a signpost with arrows reading "Safety" and "Death" pointing in opposite
directions. You can probably guess the rest. The movie plays out
predictably from there, as teens are stalked and slain by the masked
villain -- or is it villains? But, really, who cares about the story?
It barely even makes sense, and the ending is particularly incredulous.
What is important is the way "Scary Movie" subverts its source material,
and this it does very well. The "Father Death" mask, for instance, has
gained the miraculous ability to reflect its owner's mood, generating some
bizarre visuals when the killer is toquing up. Toward the end, the(?)
murderer does a terrific imitation of Matthew Lillard, one of "Scream"'s
homicidal teenagers.
"Scary Movie" doesn't just target the slasher genre, either. Everything
from "The Matrix" to "Dawson's Creek" is up for grabs here, and there are
some great send-ups of human behaviour. One of my favourite scenes has
black actress Regina Hall attending a showing of "Shakespeare In Love". In
a terrific pastiche of rude moviegoers (and, in particular, the reputation
African-Americans have of talking back to the screen), Hall just doesn't
stop chattering. She even talks on her cell phone, loudly, to the disgust
of the all-white, upper-middle-class crowd. Ghostface slinks into the
audience to stab Hall, but the audience gets to her first, pulling out
their own weapons. "This is for 'Schindler's List'!" exclaims a
Hassidic Jew. You'll have to hear for yourself what film Hall ruined for
the Pope.
(When I saw "Scary Movie", there was a moron waving a laser pointer across
the screen during certain scenes -- the first time I've encountered this
particular brand of rudeness at a local theatre. Intriguingly, they 
stopped doing it after the scene I've just described. Coincidence?)
Not all the jokes are winners, though, and "Scary Movie" is hamstrung by
following the plot of "Scream" a little too closely; greater variation
would have made for a funnier, more dynamic film. Some of the humor is
rather tired -- the gag of giving the characters cutesy, referential names
("Buffy" Gilmore) was even done already in "Scream 3". And sometimes
"Scary Movie" just doesn't know when enough is enough, like the running
gag about Ray (Shawn Wayans) being a closet homosexual.
Furthermore, whereas the truly great spoofs set you up with an obvious
joke, then knock you down by taking it one step further, "Scary Movie" is
often content to go only halfway. A parody of the confession scene from
"The Blair Witch Project", for example, is an awful lot like every other
"Blair Witch" parody of the past year.
No doubt the most controversial aspect of "Scary Movie" will be the sheer
explicitness of many jokes. Remember two years ago, when the "franks and
beans" scene in "There's Something About Mary" was considered 
groundbreaking? Well, there's a "franks and beans" scene about every
fifteen minutes here, although for the most part they're pretty amusing,
fortunately. Consequently, parents may want to be wary of letting younger
children attend "Scary Movie". It strikes me as a movie for strictly high
school age at minimum, and even that might be pushing it.
Amongst the cast, the only real standout is newcomer Anna Faris, playing
Sidney -- er, Cindy Campbell, succeeding impressively at portraying the
virginal heroine while uttering and engaging in sheer filth. It's almost
eerie. Otherwise, the castmembers are basically just vehicles for the
jokes. There aren't characters here, just ciphers and cliches.
Yes indeed, "Scary Movie" is plotless, crude, and possessed of mostly 
marginal performances -- all the things film critics are supposed to 
abhor. But did I laugh my ass off anyway? You bet I did. Do I recommend
"Scary Movie"? God help me, yes.

Review for Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2000)
HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH (2000) / *** 1/2
Directed by John Cameron Mitchell. Screenplay by Mitchell, based on the
play written by Mitchell with music and lyrics by Stephen Trask. Starring
Mitchell, Michael Pitt, Miriam Shor. Running time: 95 minutes. Rated AA by
the MFCB. Reviewed on October 14th, 2001.
Synopsis: An East German homosexual named Hansel (Mitchell) falls in love 
with an American army sergeant. In order to cross the Berlin Wall and 
marry him, Hansel endures a sex change operation; but the procedure is 
botched, leaving him with a one-inch reminder of his true gender. Calling 
himself Hedwig, Hansel goes to America where, after divorcing hir husband, 
s/he begins a songwriting career. But when Hedwig's new boyfriend (Pitt) 
steals all hir songs and becomes famous, Hedwig starts a band of hir own 
and sets out in pursuit across the country.
Review: "Hedwig And The Angry Inch" is a kinetic, outrageous, enormously 
entertaining rock musical, a rare example of a genre which has all but 
vanished. But this is also a compelling exploration of gender. Hedwig is a 
transsexual, but more out of necessity than desire; the film chronicles 
hir acceptance of hir sex, embodied by the "angry inch" left between hir 
legs. Performances are fine across the board, including Mitchell in the 
challenging title role, able to maintain a campy, over-the-top persona 
without losing the audience's interest or sympathy. Also very good are 
Pitt as Hedwig's ex-lover-turned-rock-star and Shor as a band member whose 
relationship with Hedwig is never really defined and doesn't need to be. 
Mitchell's script has plenty of off-kilter laughs, and sensibly the film 
encompasses more humour than just jokes of a sexual nature; a look back to 
Hedwig's dysfunctional childhood (including days spent playing in the 
oven) is hilarious. Mitchell's offbeat direction compliments the story 
nicely: part-drama, part-documentary, part-music video, part-undefinable 
(including some amusing breaking of the fourth wall, as when Hedwig and 
his band invites the audience to sing along to a song). Also not to be 
missed is the movie's inspired soundtrack, mostly written by Stephen 
Trask, incorporating everything from punk rock to neo-country.

Title
Review for Final Destination (2000)
Directed by James Wong. Screenplay by Glen Morgan, Wong and Jeffrey
Reddick, from a story by Reddick. Starring Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr
Smith. Running time: 102 minutes. Rated R (MFCB). Reviewed on April 13th,
2000.
Since "Scream" revived the teenage horror genre, there hasn't been much
variation on its successful formula. Films like "I Know What You Did Last
Summer" and "Urban Legend" were largely direct knock-offs, lacking the
creative spark to try something different. Now comes the latest
youth-oriented thriller, "Final Destination", as usual sporting an
inexperienced cast culled from other recent movies and TV shows popular
with its target audience. But while the trappings of "Final Destination"
may seem familiar, it is not just another "Scream" wannabe -- its
screenplay is original, and more importantly does not speak down to its
audience. While by no means a movie for intellectuals, "Final  
Destination" is nonetheless possessed of an intelligence which I hope is
not lost on future scary movies.
As the film opens, a group of teenagers is boarding Flight 180 from JFK
Airport for a class trip to Paris. One student, Alex Browning (Devon 
Sawa), falls asleep before takeoff and has a dream in which the craft
explodes in midair, killing everyone on board. Convinced he has 
experienced a precognitive vision, Alex freaks out, trying to warn
everyone off the plane. He ends up fighting with jock Carter Hogan (Kerr
Smith, miles away from his character on "Dawson's Creek") and this results
in several of them being kicked off: Alex, Carter, Alex's best friend Tod
(Chad E Donella), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), nebbish
Billy (Seann William Scott), loner Clear (Ali Larter), and their teacher
Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke). Except for Clear, they all think Alex is
overreacting to a nightmare -- until moments later when, in a terrific
scene of building horror and anticipation, the plane does indeed blow up.
Alex is treated like a pariah thereafter. Some people (including the FBI)
believe he may be responsible for the explosion, while others just fear
him because they think he can see the future. But then, one by one, the
survivors of Flight 180 start to die under mysterious and highly 
improbable circumstances, and Alex keeps getting premonitions. He slowly
comes to believe that he and the others were not meant to survive the
explosion, and now Death is coming back to claim them. Having cheated
Death once, can he and the others do so again?
"Final Destination" is essentially composed of two types of scenes: scenes
where people die, and scenes where people talk about death. The former
might be, in a perverse way, the more enjoyable -- the movie boasts some
impressively elaborate ways of killing off its cast, some of them worthy
of Rube Goldman -- but it is the latter which sets "Final Destination"
apart. The script, by Glen Morgan and James Wong (of "The X-Files" fame)
and Jeffrey Reddick, does a good job of considering how death affects
people, and how young people in particular think about death. There's the
stereotypical attitude that teens think they're immortal, of course
(embodied in Carter), but also much discourse about fate and free choice.
What if the things we do today set in motion the events which will cause
our death years down the road? asks Alex. It is a question with deep
implications indeed.
But as much as "Final Destination" throws in touches of originality, in
too many ways it is also very predictable. The identities of those who die
and those who survive (or do they?) are not hard to guess, and as a
result the middle portion of the film is somewhat lacking in suspense. We
know people are going to die, we can pretty much guess who's going to die,
so we end up marking time until the next inventive death sequence. It's
not helped that almost every death is presaged by not just one but several
occurrences: gusts of chill wind, strange shadows, the strains of
"Rocky Mountain High" by the late John Denver ("He died in a plane crash,"
Alex notes early on). These touches added style to the killings the first
couple of times around, but by the end of the movie had been overused to
the point of farce.
The script is also hampered by a few gaps in logic. For example, after the
plane explosion, more than a month passes before any of the survivors is
killed, and then the deaths come in a rush. A similar stretch of time
passes later in the film. Did the Grim Reaper have to wait until his
calendar freed up? Also, we never learn why Alex has been gifted with
these visions, and while the answer to that question is not really
essential, I think some indication would not have been unwarranted. All
this said, "Final Destination" makes up for some of these imperfections by
eschewing the traditional Hollywood ending for something much darker and
more surprising -- albeit one that is really inevitable, in the context of
the movie. The writers deserve praise for sticking to their guns, instead
of tacking on a more palatable ending which would have only diminished the
picture as a whole.
The cast of "Final Destination" is generally solid, with Ali Larter
notable as the enigmatic Clear. Sawa spends a little too much time looking
wide-eyed and harried, but altogether does a good job in the lead role.
The direction, by co-writer Wong, is accomplished, developing the
atmosphere of paranoia without going overboard. Indeed, "Final
Destination" is a movie which is well aware of its more ludicrous
elements, and acknowledges them rather than trying to justify them --
witness a hilarious cameo by Tony Todd as a mortician, for instance.
"Final Destination" is not a great film, but as flawed as it is, it tries
valiantly to rise above the conventions of the thriller genre, to be more
than just another horror movie for teens. It doesn't just tell a story,
but tries to tell a story about something, and I can only hope that other
filmmakers follow its lead. "Final Destination" demonstrates that a movie
-- even a scary movie -- can have meaning, and still be fun.

Review for Pearl Harbor (2001)
Directed by Michael Bay. Screenplay by Randall Wallace. Starring Ben
Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale. Running time: 183 minutes. Rated
AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 27th, 2001.
Synopsis: Lifelong friends Rafe (Affleck) and Danny (Hartnett) join the US 
Air Force and are stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Rafe goes to England 
to fight alongside British pilots and is seemingly killed in action. Danny 
falls in love with Rafe's girlfriend, Evelyn (Beckinsale), but Rafe 
survives and returns to confront his former friend. Meanwhile, the 
Japanese sneak attack is imminent...
Review: "Pearl Harbor" is a perfect example of movies as product rather 
than as art. It is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo 
the masses, enticing them with big stars, big effects, and a big setting 
-- but no heart. It is difficult to criticise the actors, because they do 
everything the movie demands of them. Sadly, this amounts to barely more 
than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to 
see the script Randall Wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time 
as he was writing "Pearl Harbor" with his left. The plot here is pure 
cliche, and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop. There is no 
genuine exploration of what Pearl Harbor meant to the United States, and 
no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join World War 
II. Instead, there is just an assembly-line love triangle, some empty 
patriotic rhetoric, and a laughable attempt to placate Japanese viewers 
via the inclusion of some reticent Imperial commanders (when one intones, 
"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant", I nearly fell out 
of my seat). To the movie's credit, it does include a fantastic portrayal 
of the attack itself, an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers 
into the war. If only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such 
skill, perhaps this Memorial Day non-event would have been worth watching.

Review for Hurricane, The (1999)
Directed by Norman Jewison. Screenplay by Armyan Bernstein and Dan 
Gordon, based on the books "The Sixteenth Round" by Rubin Carter and 
"Lazarus and the Hurricane" by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton. Starring 
Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Dan Hedaya. Running time: 146 
minutes. Rated AA for controversial subject matter and offensive language.
Reviewed on February 23rd, 2000.
"The Hurricane" is the story of boxer Rubin Carter (Denzel Washington), a 
middleweight boxing champion who in 1966 was convicted of three murders, 
on the basis of a case steeped in racial prejudice. During Carter's stay 
in prison, his plight drew the attention of "the famous and the 
infamous", including celebrities such as Bob Dylan and Muhammed Ali. Despite 
this, Carter remained imprisoned until 1985, when a teenager named Lesra 
Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) -- inspired by Carter's autobiography 
"The Sixteenth Round" -- took up his cause.
"The Hurricane" has many things going for it. In particular, there is 
Washington's performance as Hurricane Carter, which has won him a Golden 
Globe award and an Emmy nomination. Washington practically disappears into 
the character, suffusing Carter with nobility, passion and determination.
This is not an easy role to play: Washington's challenge is to portray 
Carter as intense without turning him into a fanatic. He succeeds, with a 
performance broad enough to permit Carter not just great strength but 
also moments of weakness, especially as Lesra's efforts start to bear 
fruit. "I'm fifty years old," Carter laments to his lawyers at one point. 
He has been in prison more than half his life, and we feel the 
weight of every one of those years.
The defining moment of Washington's performance comes when, at the start of 
his life sentence, Carter refuses to wear a prison uniform because he 
will not wear the clothes of a guilty man. He is sent into solitary 
confinement for ninety days to reconsider his protest. In many ways, he 
never emerges: to cope with his imprisonment, Carter isolates himself 
from the rest of the world. He focuses on honing his mind and body, and 
congregates more with his own inner demons than with his fellow inmates. 
The scenes of Carter in jail are "The Hurricane's" most powerful, but in 
a sense are really just a backdrop for one of the movie's main themes, 
about redemption through the written word. This is made clear from the 
start: an early scene sees an uncharacteristically desperate Carter 
pleading with a friendly prison guard (Clancy Brown) that his cell not be 
searched, for fear of having his partly-completed autobiography taken. It 
is by writing his story, and by reading voraciously, that Carter survives 
the prison experience. "The Sixteenth Round" becomes the first book the 
barely-literate Lesra ever buys, and through it he discovers Hurricane 
Carter's plight. Carter and Lesra spend much of the movie communicating 
not by phone but by letters. And by the end, this odyssey of paper and 
ink has benefited both their lives.
Performances from the rest of the cast are respectable but not as 
well-rounded. This is not entirely surprising; "The Hurricane" is 
Carter's story, after all, and he deserves the spotlight. But the lack 
of development of the supporting cast is disappointing, particularly in 
the case of Lesra, a young man from a broken home whose encounters with 
Carter help him realize his own potential. Shannon's acting is capable, 
but the growth of his character is conveyed more by what we are told than 
what we are shown, transgressing a fundamental rule of storytelling.
Given rather less to do are Lesra's guardians (Deborah Unger, Liev 
Schreiber, John Hannah). They act virtually as a gestalt, often referred 
to simply (and irritatingly) as "the Canadians". We never really get a 
firm idea of why they do what they do -- why they are together, why they 
are taking care of Lesra, why they do so much to help Carter (even moving 
to New Jersey from Ontario!) -- and it seems little effort was expended 
in making them anything more than plot facilitators.
I was nine years old when Rubin Carter was released from prison and have 
no recollection of the events surrounding his eventual freedom, so I can 
offer little comment as to the historical accuracy of "The Hurricane". 
Indeed, I don't think a film need be bound by the letter of the truth, if 
a certain amount of license will make it better artistically. But I have 
to wonder if the wholesale invention of Detective Della Pesca (Dan 
Hedaya) does "The Hurricane" service from either a factual or an 
aesthetic point of view.
In the movie, Della Pesca is the man mainly responsible for setting up 
Hurricane Carter, a deed which is the culmination of a lifelong grudge 
against the boxer. In reality, he never existed. He is intended, I suppose,
to be a synthesis of all those who helped put Carter away, but Della 
Pesca himself is so crucial to "The Hurricane" that it is difficult to 
imagine how things 'really' happened. Moreover, he is almost 
embarrassingly one-dimensional, given no more characterization beyond 
his vaguely-motivated hatred for Carter. It almost feels as though Della 
Pesca should have worn a black hat and a Snidely Whiplash-style moustache.
Indeed, the movie's biggest problem is that the story itself ends up 
feeling excessively Hollywood-ized. Nowhere is this more true than in the 
climactic courtroom scenes, which -- true to reality or not -- feel like 
a disappointing cop-out after two hours of Washington's enthralling 
characterization. There were many issues "The Hurricane" could have dealt 
with more fully: the maturation of Lesra, the way an entire justice 
system can be blinded by prejudice, even the question of whether Carter 
really might have committed the crimes (the movie doesn't even raise the 
possibility). Instead of challenging us, the film settles for a routine 
trial scene surprisingly lacking in dramatic value, as if director Norman 
Jewison knew the ending was uninspired.
We already know how the movie is going to end, so emphasizing the court
proceedings is unnecessary. It is a shame that so gripping a performance 
as Washington's winds up being subordinate to a cliche. "The Hurricane" 
would have been better served by keeping its focus on the characters and 
their personal journeys, instead of the events through which they traveled.

Review for American Pie 2 (2001)
Directed by JB Rogers. Screenplay by Adam Herz, based on a story by David
H Steinberg and Herz, and characters created by Herz. Starring Jason
Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Thomas Ian Nicholas. Running time: 107 minutes. 
Rated AA for mature subject matter and sexual content by the MFCB. 
Reviewed on August 29th, 2001.
Synopsis: Home from college, Jim (Biggs), Kevin (Nicholas), Oz (Chris 
Klein), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) rent a 
beach house for the summer. Jim gets sex lessons from Michelle (Hannigan) 
while awaiting Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth); Kevin pines after ex-girlfriend 
Vicky (Tara Reid), and Finch for Stifler's Mom; and Oz is reduced to phone 
sex with Heather (Mena Suvari). Will their friendship survive the summer?
Review: Despite a cast of unknowns, 1999's "American Pie" was a hilarious 
hit, paving the way for many lesser imitators. And although the first 
"Pie" wasn't exactly screaming out for a sequel, its box office success 
made one virtually inevitable. The result is not as good as its precursor 
-- unsurprising, given that the sheer freshness of "American Pie" was part 
of its appeal -- but "Pie 2" is nonetheless an enjoyable romp. To a large 
extent, the best ingredients of the original "Pie" shine here as well: 
Biggs is fine as hapless Jim, Eugene Levy is terrific as his 
well-intentioned father, and Hannigan sparkles as sexually deviant flutist 
Michelle. And, once again, Nicholas and Reid are forgettable as former 
couple Kevin and Vicky, and Natasha Lyonne's Jessica is given nothing to 
do. There are a few additional missteps this time: Stifler, entertaining 
in small doses in the first film, grows wearisome in the expanded role 
he's given here. And Finch, so enjoyable last time around, is trapped in 
basically the same joke throughout "Pie 2". There is also a sketchier feel 
to the script, like a tacit admission that it has little reason to exist. 
Although a few sequences stand out -- including phone sex between Klein 
and Suvari, and hilarious lessons in sex from Hannigan -- it would not 
come as a complete disappointment if this was the final slice of pie.

Title
Review for Magnolia (1999)
Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Screenplay by Anderson. Starring Philip 
Baker Hall, Jason Robards, Tom Cruise. Running time: 188 minutes. Rated R 
for offensive language (MFCB). Reviewed on March 20th, 2000.
I am almost surprised to find myself reviewing "Magnolia", two months 
after viewing the film. But although I have seen several movies in the 
intervening weeks, the images of "Magnolia" have remained strong in my 
mind, and so here I sit at my keyboard. This is not to say that 
"Magnolia" is a perfect film; in some respects, it is deeply flawed. But 
it is one of those movies which demands to be viewed, contemplated, 
remembered, even if the verdict is not entirely positive.
"Magnolia" is the brainchild of Paul Thomas Anderson, and is a sequel of 
sorts to his "Boogie Nights", featuring many of the same cast and crew. 
Some critics have reviewed "Magnolia" on this basis, but I have not seen 
"Boogie Nights" (yet) and would prefer to discuss "Magnolia" on its own 
merits anyhow.
"Magnolia" tells the stories of several people on one day in California. 
Jim Kurring (John C Reilly) is a police officer who is well-meaning but 
sometimes too earnest. On a routine call, he meets drug-addled Claudia 
(Melora Walters). Claudia's father is popular game show host Jimmy Gator 
(Philip Baker Hall), who has recently learned he is dying and must now 
break the truth of his sordid private life to wife Rose (Melinda Dillon). 
The current star of Gator's quiz show is young Stanley Spector (Jeremy 
Blackman), both encouraged and terrorized by his father Rick (Michael 
Bowen). Stanley has raised the spectre of the legendary "Quiz Kid" Donnie 
Smith (William H Macy). Smith became famous on Gator's show, but has 
fallen on hard times as an adult and is now contemplating crime.
Meanwhile, Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise) is a "motivational" speaker who 
teaches men how to seduce women. Mackey's estranged father is rich TV 
producer Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), now on his deathbed in almost 
constant pain. Partridge is cared for by nurse Phil Parma (Philip Seymour 
Hoffman), who desperately wants to reunite father and son before Earl's 
imminent demise. Partridge's much younger wife is Linda (Julianne Moore), 
who married him for his money but has grown to love him, and does not 
know how to deal with his death.
There are a number of themes competing for attention in "Magnolia". The 
most obvious is that Strange Things Happen, introduced in three amusing 
opening vignettes. The movie, obviously, is awash with coincidence and 
happenstance, as characters from otherwise unrelated plot threads cross 
each other's paths. This theme is almost comically illustrated at two 
points in the film's second half: once when all the characters begin 
singing along to the excellent Aimee Mann soundtrack, and once shortly 
thereafter when a totally unanticipated event occurs. It would be 
criminal of me to reveal the controversial details of the latter, but 
suffice it to say that it is presaged by a few carefully-planted clues 
in the film itself (not to mention the prologue), and does not feel at all
out of place within "Magnolia"'s narrative framework. If the first event 
is the calm before the storm, the second is the storm itself; together 
they pave the way for the events that form the movie's conclusion.
While this in of itself would be the basis for an intriguing movie, and 
is certainly the fulcrum upon which "Magnolia" turns, there is a lot more 
going on. The struggle between fathers and children crops up often: 
between Hall and Walters, Robards and Cruise, Bowen and Blackman. Events 
have conspired to force each pair to confront their relationship, in one 
way or another, whether they want to or not.
Both Robards and Hall are dying. Both Moore and Walters wrestle with 
substance abuse. Both the Robards/Moore and Hall/Dillon marriages are 
built on a foundation of lies. Both Parma and Reilly are caregivers 
flailing in the face of their own impotence. Both Walters and Macy are 
looking for someone to take care of them. Macy has already suffered from 
the false glamour of childhood fame; now it looks as though Blackman may 
endure the same fate.
Even at over three hours, "Magnolia" is bursting with material, throwing 
so much at the viewer it is hard to get bored. But this is both its 
blessing and its curse: Anderson puts so much into the movie that some 
things get lost in the shuffle. It is difficult to tell if the movie 
really comes together, or just amounts to a lot of sound and fury. Early 
on, for example, Reilly investigates a murder which never gets resolved. 
Sure, it's not integral to the movie (Reilly's scenes with Dillon and 
Macy are much more important), but so much is made of it early on that 
ignoring it makes "Magnolia" feel incomplete. And a few of the subplots 
just don't feel as well-developed as others. Blackman and Bowen's 
relationship, in particular, gets short shrift compared to some of the 
other stories. It is ironic that, for such a long movie, one of the 
dominant feelings I was left with afterward was of wanting more. But 
maybe that isn't necessarily such a bad thing, either.
The large cast mainly rises to the quality of Anderson's script. Cruise's 
Oscar-nominated performance has gotten the most attention, and not 
undeservedly. Here he turns his public persona on its head in a role 
which matches "Eyes Wide Shut" for how deeply it plumbs. Also excellent 
is Hoffman, quiet yet passionate as Phil Parma. Really, only Moore 
disappoints, with a performance that can best be described as shrill. 
Although by no means bad, she does exhibit the skill shown in "The End of 
the Affair" and "An Ideal Husband".
"Magnolia" is a rarity in today's Hollywood: a film honestly deserving of 
the term 'epic'. Brilliantly acted, richly scripted, tantalizingly 
directed, it more than overcomes its flaws and proves to be a truly 
singular filmgoing experience. It is little wonder it has stayed so fresh 
in my mind so long; would that I could say the same about more movies.

Review for Original Kings of Comedy, The (2000)
THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY (2000) / * 1/2
Directed by Spike Lee. Starring Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, Cedric the
Entertainer, Bernie Mac. Running time: 115 minutes. Rated AA for mature
subject matter and coarse language by the MFCB. Reviewed on September
12th, 2000.
That's a cliche, to be sure, but it's also true. Much of it comes from the
fact that the act of killing is reasonably straightforward, whereas making
people laugh is considerably more elusive. And, by extension, it's because
while being dead is a pretty objective state (certain metaphysical 
concerns notwithstanding), being funny is a lot more personal and
subjective. What I find absolutely uproarious might be stupid or silly or
just plain boring to somebody else. Sense of humour is as individual as we
are.
As such, I will not really attempt to assess how funny "The Original Kings
Of Comedy" is. I will merely indicate that I didn't find it at all 
amusing. Certainly, there were moments which elicited a few chuckles, but
I spent most of the film's nearly two-hour duration sitting in my seat
slack-jawed, wondering what I was missing. Because not only does the
audience in the movie clearly love the act (it'd be a curious concert film
otherwise!) but many others at the screening I attended got a kick out of
it too. So the humour in the picture clearly has an appeal -- just not for
me.
All that said, though, there are aspects of "The Original Kings Of Comedy"
which are candidates for discussion and which are not quite so subjective
as the quality (or lack thereof) of its humour. It is in many ways a very
flawed undertaking and while those who appreciate its brand of comedy may
be able to overlook this, it makes the experience all the more intolerable
for those who do not.
"The Original Kings Of Comedy" is spliced together by director Spike Lee 
from two performances in Charlotte, on February 26th and 27th of this
year. The show consists of four respected (if not exactly famous) black
comedians plying their trade. DL Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and 
Bernie Mac are presented in single individual segments running about 
thirty minutes each. Introducing each act is Steve Harvey, which is to
basically say that Harvey gets three separate ten-minute blocks of stage
time to put on his act instead of an unbroken half hour like the others.
The picture is also peppered with brief behind-the-scenes clips which add
little to the proceedings as a whole.
The film's major problem is the sheer lack of variety amongst the four
comedians, virtually all of whose humour runs along similar lines. All
four indulge in lots of "black people versus white people" commentary
(which is often hilarious, but gets really tedious on its umpteenth
iteration in the span of two hours). All four stay confined to very 
broad-based topics, largely eschewing any political or intellectual
commentary. And all of them lace their monologues with an endless litany
of profanity. Whereas the best comedians know to use swearing to punctuate
their punchlines, here it is often used in place of one: a much lower
brand of humour for sure.
Further, there is little insight offered through the jokes. There is a lot
of racial content, but it mostly consists of potshots at Caucasians and/or
African-Americans. Certainly, we are afforded only the barest of glimpses
into what it is like to be a black man in America. These comedians are
happy to talk about the world around them, but reveal precious little
about themselves in the process. Most of the comedy is of sitcom variety,
and while this is fine in half-hour doses on prime time television, it
feels like an opportunity wasted in a major motion picture.
The comedian who comes closest to achieving some sort of relevance with
his segment is Bernie Mac, who discusses the effects of his sister's drug
habit on his family (he is now sharing custody of her three children with
his brother-in-law). Unfortunately, Mac couches this portion of his 
monologue in exceedingly unpleasant jokes, constantly referring to his six
year-old nephew as a "faggot" and talking about physically beating his own
child. Mac's brand of humor is extremely edgy, maybe too much so; it makes
for an uncomfortable performance which straddles the line between comedy
and cruelty and, perhaps, goes a little too far.
Mac's half hour also illustrates the restrictions imposed by recording
the film in a live environment. Mac has a thick accent (as does Cedric, to
a lesser extent), and I found that the concert's sound facilities --
obviously a poor comparison with anything that would be taped in a studio
-- often distorted his words to the point of unintelligibility. Lee is
also occasionally forced to choose some rather poor camera angles, though
in general he does a good job of setting things up to capture the 
performers at the best possible angles.
Of the four comedians, I found Harvey's material the best. This may have
been aided by the fact that, alone amongst the quartet, his screentime
is split up, so that he does not overstay his welcome. Intriguingly,
Harvey's best material comes when he is adlibbing to the audience. For
example, when a Rastafarian-looking man in the front row tells him that
he's doing computer technology education, Harvey retorts that the last two
words that come to his mind when he looks at the man are "technology"...
or "education". He also has a few amusing rehearsed skits, like one about
black people on the "Titanic".
But good gags like this are few and far between. I found "The Original
Kings Of Comedy" to be an unpleasant morass, a sterile waste of a long two
hours. Maybe my sense of humour just isn't geared in the right way. Maybe
I'm not the demographic that the "Kings" are appealing to. I guess much
the same reaction would be had if Newfoundland's comedy troupe Buddy
Wassisname and the Other Fellers were dropped off in the South Bronx to do
a show. If you understand the reference, I expect you'll see the point. If
you don't understand the reference... well, maybe that makes the point,
too.

Review for Nurse Betty (2000)
Directed by Neil LaBute. Screenplay by John Richards, from a story by
Richards and James Flamberg. Starring Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman,
Chris Rock. Running time: 110 minutes. Rated AA for offensive language by
the MFCB. Reviewed on September 17th, 2000.
The Summer 2000 movie season was characterised by a startling absence of
creativity. Film after film -- from "Gone In 60 Seconds" to "Hollow
Man" -- revealed themselves as tired retreads of timeworn formulas. Some
were at least made watchable by a nice performance, or good direction. Too
many, however, were entirely undistinguished, resulting in one of the most
disappointing theatrical summers I've ever endured.
Now, though, it's autumn (in the cinema world, if not the calendar), a
time when the industry traditionally moves away from big-budget,
mass-appeal movies to quieter, often more ambitious fare. Leading the way
this year is "Nurse Betty", which in some respects bridges the gap between
the summer and fall, inasmuch as it closely adheres to one of the most
popular cinematic traditions: the road movie.
All the usual plot points are here. The lead character is inspired to set
out on an unusual journey; has encounters en route which help to redefine
her purpose; and finally reaches her goal, only to discover that the road
she set out on is not the one she still travels. What makes "Nurse 
Betty" so different from other pictures of its ilk, however, is the sheer
cleverness exhibited by the John Richards and James Flamberg's screenplay
-- aided and abetted by terrific casting and solid direction by Neil
LaBute. "Nurse Betty" does not settle for being just a road movie. It uses
the familiar set-up to tell a story that is laudably different, yet
undeniably appealing.
Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) is a good person trapped in a lousy
life. She is married to the sleazy Del (Aaron Eckhart), a car salesman who
is having an affair and trafficking drugs behind her back. Betty's only
happiness comes from a soap opera, "A Reason To Love", and especially its
main character, Dr David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). One night, Del's sordid
misdeeds finally catch up to him when a pair of enforcers named Charlie
and Wesley come calling. Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is a sagacious veteran
of the trade; Wesley (Chris Rock) is a hothead up-and-comer.
Del ends up being scalped and killed by Charlie and Wesley. Unbeknownst to
them, Betty watches from another room. The event is so traumatic that, as
a defense mechanism, she blocks out her husband's death and comes to
believe that she is the ex-fiancee of "David Ravell". Determined to "win
him back", Betty sets out for California, not realising that Del has
hidden his stash in the car she's driving. Soon Charlie and Wesley are in
hot pursuit.
What is most interesting about "Nurse Betty" is that it is really two
conventional road movies put together, one mirroring the other. Obviously,
there is Betty and her search for "David Ravell" (actually an actor named
George McCord). In her delusion, Betty has conceived a mental image of the
man as her perfect paramour. By the same token, Charlie begins to develop
a crush on Betty. He envisions her as a symbol of all the loveliness he
forsook when he became a killer for hire. "Betty wouldn't come to a place
like this," he tells Wesley when they arrive at a roadside tavern.
Nonetheless, Betty had been there, and this is indicative of how Charlie's
fantasies about Betty are as imprecise as Betty's fantasies about "David".
Both Betty and Charlie are seeking deliverance from their undesirable
regular lives through an imaginary ideal love. They even begin to
fantasise in parallel: Betty imagines that "David" proposed to her at the
Grand Canyon and later, Charlie envisions Betty and he dancing at the same
spot. It is a dual reflection of how we, as a society, seek escape both
through entertainment and through those we love. The reality is that,
although these are helpful vehicles, neither is a perfect solution. We
have to make our own happiness, not rely on other people (or other
things) to deliver it to us.
Offsetting the more reflective tone of "Nurse Betty", Richards and 
Flamberg have gifted their screenplay with a great deal of humor. Some of
it will appeal to anyone; some of it is specifically targetted at those
familiar with Hollywood. For example, when Betty finally meets George
McCord and the producers of "A Reason To Love", they think she's method
acting, not deranged, and offer her a role in the soap opera.
Great acting abounds in "Nurse Betty". Zellweger delivers a performance
that should establish her as more than capable of headlining a film. Her
Betty is sweet but not saccharine, deluded without being crazy. Also
splendid is Freeman, who continues to quietly demonstrate why he is one of
the best actors of the past quarter-century. He brings a gentle dignity
and wisdom to his role, but does not forget that Charlie is, above all, a
hardened criminal. Charlie is a character tinged with sadness; he is a man
who clearly could have done much with his life, but has long since gone
down the wrong path.
Rock has a less substantial role, but is very funny and for the most part
manages to rein in the excesses he sometimes demonstrates in his stand-up
act. Between "Nurse Betty" and "Lethal Weapon 4", Rock has shown that he
is an actor as well as a comedian, and I look forward to seeing him take
on meatier roles in the future. Kinnear, meanwhile, is left in the rather
uncomfortable position of effectively playing two roles, neither of them
much more than caricatures. Excellent in supporting roles are Allison
Janney ("The West Wing) as McCord's self-assured producer, and Crispin
Glover, who plays Betty's nerdy reporter friend and, maybe, potential love
interest.
"Nurse Betty" hits all the right notes. It's well-made from any 
perspective and appeals on two important levels: as a hilarious dark
comedy for those in search of mere levity, and as a thoughtful parable
about the nature of perception and happiness for those wanting something a
little deeper. "Nurse Betty" gets the Fall 2000 movie season off to a
promising start.

Review for Jurassic Park III (2001)
Directed by Joe Johnston. Screenplay by Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne,
and Jim Taylor, based on characters created by Michael Crichton. Starring
Sam Neill, William H Macy, Tea Leoni. Running time: 94 minutes. Rated AA
by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 15th, 2001.
Synopsis: Original "Jurassic Park" survivor Alan Grant (Neill) is tricked 
by Paul and Amanda Kirby (Macy and Leoni) into leading an expedition to an 
island overrun by dinosaur, to rescue their stranded son. Grant's team is 
picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar, 
and Grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he 
previously thought.
Review: There is one reason why "Jurassic Park III" is better than its 
immediate predecessor, "The Lost World: Jurassic Park". The latter wasted 
129 minutes of my life; the former, only 94. The first "Park" was a 
marvellous film, full of awe-inspiring sights, interesting characters, and 
genuine thrills. Its two successors have been pale imitations, amounting 
to hundred-million-dollar B-grade horror movies. At least this third entry 
realises it; whereas "The Lost World" tried to justify its existence with 
a ludicrous and overextended plot, "Jurassic Park III" simply sticks its 
characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem 
begin. There is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie; 
the computer-animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting, and even the 
first-time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation. 
Remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the Park in the original 
movie? Nothing in this rehash even comes close. Add in execrable dialogue 
from screenwriters Buchman, Payne and Taylor, and phoned-in performances 
by the normally capable Macy and Leoni, and it is difficult to recommend 
the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts. At least Neill makes some effort 
to retain the dignity of his character, and there is much less gore than 
in "The Lost World", making this installment more suitable for children.

Title
Review for Pay It Forward (2000)
Directed by Mimi Leder. Screenplay by Leslie Dixon, based on the novel by
Catherine Ryan Hyde. Starring Haley Joel Osment, Helen Hunt, Kevin Spacey.
Running time: 124 minutes. Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on November
18th, 2000.
There are some nice ideas in "Pay It Forward". One of them is the central
premise itself -- that one person does "three big favours for three other
people", and then those people do three more favours for three more
people, and on and on. Better still, these have to be favours that the
other people "can't do for themselves" -- certainly not a minor 
proposition!
Admittedly, it's not a terribly realistic concept. I think that in real
life, far too many people would take advantage of the first part without
doing the second (or is that just my own cynicism peeking through?). But
in a cinematic context, there is nothing wrong with this per se, and
indeed the "pay it forward" philosophy has all the makings of a juicy
movie premise.
Unfortunately, the Mimi Leder picture just does not have enough faith in
its central idea. Instead of taking the ball and running with it, "pay it
forward" is used as a clothesline on which to hang a number of far less
rivetting, less original subplots. Despite its title, this is not a movie
about a philanthropic way of life, but instead concerns itself mostly the
broken people who become involved in that lifestyle.
And make no mistake, "Pay It Forward" is a film almost entirely populated
with broken people -- those suffering from abuse, alcoholism, drug
addictions, or simply neglect. Some have suggested the movie is
"Capra-esque", but it is Capra viewed through distinctly 21st-century
misanthropy. Those expecting a latter-day "It's A Wonderful Life" are
likely to be disappointed.
Middle schooler Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) is a latchkey kid
whose alcoholic father is long gone. Mother Arlene (Helen Hunt) works two
jobs and is so close to falling off the wagon that she must be scraping
pavement. Trevor's new social studies teacher is Eugene Simonet (Kevin
Spacey), a man who is himself scarred both physically and emotionally. But
Eugene is a good teacher, and on the first day of school, he challenges
his class to come up with "an idea that will change the world -- and put
it into action".
So quickly that you'd swear he must have been expecting the question,
Trevor devises the "pay it forward" philosophy. His first act is to let a
homeless man (James Caviezel) live in his garage. Then he tries to hook up
Arlene and Eugene, neither of whom have been able to cultivate a
functional love life. And for his third "big favour", he goes to the aid
of a classmate perpetually troubled by bullies.
None of these work out quite like Trevor had hoped. And yet, the script by
Leslie Dixon assures us that something good will come of it, because we
are privy to glimpses of four months in the future, when a reporter (Jay
Mohr) becomes part of "pay it forward" and begins backtracking through the
chain to find its originator.
Unfortunately, each of Trevor's "favours" are used not so much to propel
the "pay it forward" story forward, but rather as springboards, to a
greater or lesser extent, for subplots of inferior dramatic value. It is
these which dominate the movie. The most significant is the relationship
between Arlene and Eugene. Disappointingly, especially given two such
unusual characters and two such talented actors, this is nothing more than
a standard romantic storyline. It goes through so many timeworn stages of
misunderstanding, revelation, complication, separation, and reconciliation
that it could have been lifted directly from a screenwriter's how-to book.
If nothing else, these sequences do at least boast the acting skills of
Hunt and Spacey, who are in their usual fine form. That Hunt is able to
portray Arlene as such a complex, troubled individual without engendering
feelings of pity (or, for that matter, disgust) is somewhat remarkable.
Hunt doesn't forget that, while Arlene is burdened by a tremendous number
of issues, there is more to the character than just those issues. This is
best illustrated in a terrific scene with Angie Dickinson (playing a bag
lady), one of "Pay It Forward"'s few genuinely touching moments. 
Spacey, meanwhile, does an excellent job of alluding to the hidden depths
in Eugene's psyche without overplaying it. Consider the sequence in which
Eugene finally reveals the root of his problems. As scripted, it is
typical melodramatic fare, but Spacey never loses his center and plays the
scene sincerely, without caving into the overt sentimentality of the
moment, giving it some measure of credibility. Spacey also enjoys an
excellent on-screen rapport with Osment, who continues to demonstrate that
he is one of those rare child stars who actually knows how to act, rather
than just mug for the camera.
The other subplots are not so blessed, unfortunately. The chronicle of
Caviezel's hobo comes across as particularly disjointed, as the script
drops in on it only at emotional highpoints (or lowpoints, as the case may
be). It feels like we're just seeing the trailer for a more detailed
storyline.
The school bully arc, meanwhile, is plainly included only to provide "Pay
It Forward" with a convenient conclusion. This would not be so bad if that
ending were more meaningful, but as it stands, it constitutes nothing more
than indisputable viewer manipulation on the part of the screenwriters. I
will not divulge any details, except to say that rarely have I watched a
scene so clearly intended merely to provoke an obvious response from the
audience, without any thought given to how this might impact on the 
movie's overall theme.
As a result, "Pay It Forward" comes across as something of an oddity -- a
movie which not only shunts its own premise into the background for long
stretches of time, but indeed provides its own evidence to discredit that
premise. A few good performances do not come close enough to saving this
poorly-conceived film. "Pay It Forward" has the makings of something good,
but in the end it is much like the characters which inhabit it: broken.

Title
Review for Gladiator (2000)
Directed by Ridley Scott. Screenplay by David H Franzoni, John Logan and
William Nicholson. Starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie 
Nielsen. Running time: 153 minutes. Rated AA for blood letting and 
violent scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on May 8th, 2000.
The reign of Caesar Marcus Aurelius in the mid-second century A.D. is
often considered a golden age of the Roman Empire. Marcus was 
instrumental in securing peace in the nether regions of the Empire, but 
was also a philosopher of great renown. He died in 180 and rule passed to 
his son Commodus. The transition was an orderly one; Commodus was 
recommended to the Senate by Marcus, and indeed had been sharing power 
with his father since 177. Commodus' rule, however, would go down in the 
history books as disastrous, with the Caesar's demeanour descending into 
brutality and ultimately madness. In 182 his sister Lucilla and a group 
of senators tried unsuccessfully to have him assassinated. Commodus 
became obsessed with the gladiatorial games, and in 192 his own advisers 
had him strangled by a popular wrestler.
"Gladiator" is a condensed and largely fictionalised version of the true 
events. The most notable addition to the story is Maximus (Russell 
Crowe), a general who leads the Romans to victory against the German 
tribes to the north. Contradicting real life, Marcus Aurelius (Richard 
Harris) wants Maximus -- not Commodus -- to be Rome's new ruler after his 
death, with the aim of eventually turning the empire back into a republic. 
Before he can proclaim his decision, however, the deceitful Commodus 
(Joaquin Phoenix) murders his father and orders Maximus' execution.
Maximus escapes and tries to return home to Spain, only to discover that 
Commodus has had his wife and son killed as well. Gravely wounded in his 
flight, Maximus is captured and bought by Proximo (the late Oliver Reed)
to fight as a gladiator. Initially reluctant, Maximus soon embraces his
new role when it gives him a chance to travel to Rome, where the new
Caesar has declared 150 days of gladiatorial games to celebrate his 
ascension to the throne. There, Maximus' efforts to take revenge on 
Commodus involve him in the machinations of Commodus' sister Lucilla 
(Connie Nielsen).
The first blockbuster movie of the 2000 summer season, "Gladiator" is a 
visual feast. Expert set design and computer effects have been exploited 
in their fullest by director Ridley Scott to bring ancient Rome to life. 
Shots which pan overhead across the city to the Coliseum, teeming with 
spectators, are fabulous to behold. It is difficult not to feel  
transported eighteen hundred years back in time.
In some respects, however, Scott overdoes it with his cinematic trickery. 
Specifically, he portrays many fight scenes -- both with the gladiators 
and the legions -- using a choppy, strobe-like technique. Scott is 
clearly trying to achieve the sense of disorientation in battle that was 
so successfully conveyed in films like  "Braveheart" and "Saving Private 
Ryan". Instead, he merely makes these sequences disjointed and hard to 
watch. It is virtually impossible to follow the actions of even the 
principal characters, and so the viewer is left to try to piece together 
what is actually happening.
It has been more than thirty years since the last great Roman epic was 
made. In reviving the genre, the scriptwriters have elected to hew 
closely to tried-and-true storylines rather than break new ground. 
"Gladiator" does not deviate much from other examples of the genre, 
echoing everything from "Spartacus" to "Doctor Who". The mad emperor, the
resurgent war hero, and the gladiatorial games as a conduit for revenge 
are all familiar plot elements. Nonetheless, the story is entertainingly 
told, and while considerable attention is paid to the gladiator combat 
which is the movie's main attraction, this is not overaccentuated. 
"Gladiator" is no "Mortal Kombat", moving from meaningless battle to 
meaningless battle without pause. The film is very well paced, and the 
quieter aspects of the plot are not trivialised.
Perhaps as a result of this, "Gladiator" boasts some unusually fine 
acting for a big-budget action picture. Crowe, although by no means 
achieving the complexity of his Oscar-nominated performance in "The 
Insider", brings a pleasant depth to Maximus. The general is a man first 
and a hero second; he is driven to confront Commodus not by a love of 
Rome, but rather of a man who was as a father to him, and of a murdered 
wife and child whose deaths he must avenge. Crowe brings an evenness to 
the role which makes Maximus seem more real than similar characters in 
other movies.
Likewise, Phoenix does well not to overplay Commodus. The role of the
insane tyrant has often been an invitation to hammy overacting in the 
past, but Phoenix's portrayal is more subtle. Commodus' burgeoning 
madness is manifested largely through his body language, rather than any 
particular statement or deed. Also very good are Reed and Harris in 
supporting roles. Despite their comparatively short screen time (indeed, 
Reed actually died before filming was complete, forcing Scott to 
compensate using clever editing and digital effects), both grant their 
characters a sense of history and profundity.
Perhaps least successful is Nielsen as Lucilla, despite having what may be
"Gladiator"'s most involved role. Lucilla is Commodus' sister, and he 
obviously harbors inappropriate feelings for her. It is also strongly 
implied that she is Maximus' former lover. And she is a dispassionate and 
intelligent schemer, whose allegiances may be pivotal in determining 
Rome's future. But Nielsen comes across as detached throughout the 
proceedings, more so than is called for by her character. Even in scenes 
where Lucilla's reserve breaks, Nielsen feels removed from the action. 
Given her importance in how the events of the movie play out, this is an 
unfortunate central weakness.
But all in all, "Gladiator" is entrancing to watch, beautifully acted, 
and really just a lot of good old-fashioned fun. Although far removed from 
the greatness of classics like "Ben-Hur", it marks an entertaining and 
satisfying return of what was once one of Hollywood's favourite genres.
Indeed, given the possibilities offered by this age of increasingly 
sophisticated special effects, "Gladiator" is hopefully just the first 
of many forays back to the time of the great Roman Empire.

Title
Review for X-Men (2000)

Directed by Bryan Singer. Screenplay by David Hayter, from a story by Tom
DeSanto and Singer. Starring Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Ian McKellan.
Running time: 96 minutes. Rated PG for frightening scenes by the MFCB.
Reviewed on July 17th, 2000.
Unlike novels, comic books have traditionally proven extremely difficult 
to translate to the big screen. The list of quality film versions of 
comics is precipitously short: the original "Superman", the odd-numbered 
"Batman"s, "The Matrix", and little else. Marvel Comics -- historically 
one of the two dominant players in the comic book industry -- has been 
particularly inept in turning its super-heroes into box office gold, with 
most of its films either dying a quick death or going straight to video 
("Blade" being a notable exception).
Part of the reason for this is that several movies featuring Marvel's 
toplining characters have been stuck in development hell for years. 
Finally, however, their most popular franchise has made it into theatres as
"X-Men", a film about mutants, humans who represent mankind's next stage 
of evolution. Mutants develop extraordinary powers, but have incurred the 
suspicion and fear of normal people as a result.
Mutant abilities usually manifest themselves after puberty, as with 
Southern teenager Marie (Anna Paquin). While making out with her 
boyfriend, she discovers that her touch drains a person's "life force" -- 
whether she wills it or not. Panicking, Marie hits the road, assuming the 
alias "Rogue". Making her way into northern Canada, she meets Wolverine 
(Hugh Jackman), a mutant with a shadowy past who rapidly heals wounds and 
has metal claws which emerge from his hands.
Wolverine and Rogue are attacked by the super-strong Sabretooth (Tyler 
Mane). They are saved by Cyclops (James Marsden), who shoots lasers from 
his eyes, and Storm (Halle Berry), who controls the weather. Together 
with telekinetic Dr Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops and Storm are 
members of the X-Men, a team of mutants formed by Professor Charles 
Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who believes that mutants and regular humans 
should strive for peaceful coexistence. He is opposed by Magneto (Ian 
McKellen), whose Brotherhood of Mutants -- including the nimble Toad (Ray 
Park), shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), and Sabretooth --
is dedicated to the eradication of non-mutants.
The "X-Men" comic book was borne out of the social unrest of the Sixties, 
with mutantkind acting as a catch-all parallel for any oppressed 
minority. That metaphor is no less effective today, and the "X-Men" movie 
adroitly paints a world which resents mutants, without going over the 
top. We can understand why normal humans react the way they do, even if 
we disagree with them.
Particularly well-handled is Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), a 
McCarthy-like figure who wants to enact mutant registration laws and 
other rights-restricting measures. An early scene in which Kelly waves 
around a list of "known mutants" is chilling -- made all the more so by 
the excellent publicity strategy for the film, which saw real people 
"campaigning" for Kelly and the creation of an "anti-mutant" website.
"X-Men" boasts several fine performances, particularly Jackman as the 
feral Wolverine. He manages to infuse his anti-hero role with humor and 
nobility, creating an exciting, engaging character. Also commendable is 
Paquin as Rogue, the film's most tragic figure. She conveys the panic and 
confusion Rogue experiences without neglecting the spunk and 
self-confidence which propels her character. The other actors have more 
limited screen time but generally do a good job with their material. Of 
note is Park ("The Phantom Menace"'s Darth Maul) who turns the 
potentially farcical Toad into an enjoyable yet threatening character. The 
entire array of "X-Men" characters is well chosen, diverse in both power 
and appearance.
Visually, "X-Men" is inspired, making the most of its comparatively 
limited budget (about US$75 million, in an era when most movies of its 
stature cost twice as much). Magneto's island base and the X-Men 
headquarters are well-designed, and the special effects are low-key but 
convincing. The realisation of super-hero costumes has long been a sore 
point for the genre; "X-Men" eschews the heroes' comic book attire for 
stylish motorcycle uniform-type outfits. The film also boasts some lovely 
attention to detail. For instance, one young mutant (inspired by the 
comics character Iceman) has the power to instantly freeze moisture. When 
he speaks, you can see his breath.
Director Bryan Singer does an effective job, setting the tone with a 
faux-"Schindler's List" scene of a young Magneto in a Nazi concentration 
camp. (This has drawn some criticism for being inappropriate, but I 
thought it was tactfully handled, and established a palpable mood.) 
Singer avoids the extremes of the "Batman" franchise by not letting 
things get too campy or too grim. He allows for a lot of humor (including 
some cute in-jokes for fans of the comic book) without forgetting the 
serious nature of the allegory the film is drawing.
It is unfortunate, then, that the script (by David Hayter and a host of 
uncredited contributors) treats the anti-mutant subject matter only 
cursorily after the first few minutes. At one point, Wolverine asks Storm 
if she truly believes Xavier's side is the right one. But the question 
may as well have been rhetorical, so little doubt is there as to anyone's 
allegiances.
The movie's biggest flaw is that it spends so much time on set-up that 
the actual meat of the plot (Magneto's strike against mankind) seems 
almost an afterthought. To an extent, this is unavoidable, given the 
dizzying number of characters and concepts to be comprehensibly 
introduced. But I don't see why "X-Men" couldn't simply have been 
lengthier -- at just over an hour and a half, it is not exactly a long 
movie.
I can only guess that the filmmakers felt the need to pander to the 
attention span-deficient MTV generation, and feared that a protracted 
movie would be less commercially viable. But I never found my interest 
flagging at any point; indeed, I wanted to know more about these 
characters and see the plot better developed. I was sorely disappointed 
that these things did not happen. If nothing else, "X-Men" leaves me 
looking forward to the sequel for which it is so clearly paving the way.

Review for Me, Myself & Irene (2000)
Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly. Screenplay by Mike
Cerrone, Farrelly and Farrelly. Starring Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger,
Chris Cooper. Running time: 116 minutes. Rated AA for coarse language by
the MFCB. Reviewed on June 28th, 2000.
In a way, I have a lot in common with Charlie Baileygates. I consider 
myself, all things considered, a nice guy. I'm polite. I do favors 
without expectation of reward. I could count on one hand the number of 
times in the past five years that I've gotten really, blood-boiling, 
vein-in-the-neck-throbbing angry. Sometimes, I'm probably a bit of a 
pushover. I've often wondered what would happen if, one day, I just... 
snapped. The new comedy "Me, Myself & Irene" is devilishly entertaining 
wish fulfillment.
Charlie, played by Jim Carrey, is a Rhode Island state trooper. The film 
opens with a flashback to eighteen years ago, when Charlie married his 
sweetheart Layla (Traylor Howard). On their wedding day, Charlie became 
involved in an inadvertent fracas with Shonte (Tony Cox), a black midget 
limo driver who, like Layla, was a card-carrying Mensa member. Soon, 
Layla and Shonte were having an affair, and nine months later she gave 
birth to triplets: three African-American baby boys. Outwardly oblivious, 
Charlie raised the kids as his own (despite the fact that one is actually 
named Shonte Jr!).
Fast forward to the present. Charlie is rearing the boys by himself, 
Layla having run off with Shonte years earlier. His "sons" (Anthony 
Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, and Jerod Mixon) have grown into brilliant but 
foul-mouthed prodigies -- witness their hilarious, profanity-laden 
quantum mechanics study session. But gullible Charlie has become the 
state joke, and one day all his pent-up rage externalises itself... as a 
split personality, Hank, a gruff-talking, aggressive, no-nonsense jerk.
There's more to the plot than this, of course, as Charlie/Hank becomes 
involved with Irene (Renee Zellweger), who is being hunted by corrupt New 
Jersey cops because of her involvement with a crooked golf course owner. 
Or something. Frankly, the specifics of this whole storyline are made 
murkily clear at best, and really don't matter anyway. The point is just 
to keep Charlie/Hank and Irene together for an extended period of time, 
and embroil them in a series of wacky encounters.
"Me, Myself & Irene" is a funny movie, but it is in many ways a victim of 
its own publicity campaign. So much of the set-up has been revealed in 
trailers and in print that a lot of the humor which could have arisen 
from the unexpected and improbable scenario has been defused by our 
familiarity with the material. Imagine, for instance, directors Bobby and 
Peter Farrelly's last picture, "There's Something About Mary", if you 
knew Chris Elliott was Woogie. Few comedies can sustain the laughs no 
matter how well-acquainted we are with them ("The Philadelphia Story" 
does it for me; so does "Mystery Science Theater 3000"). "Me, Myself & 
Irene" is no exception.
There's also something of a miscalculation in the script by the Farrellys 
and Mike Cerrone. Hank starts off as an amusing character -- consider his 
revenge against a woman who skips ahead of Charlie in the supermarket 
line-up, for example -- but then the writers seem to assume that Hank as a
concept is good enough. However, Hank himself isn't funny; he's 
grotesque, really. To work, Hank needs to be doing funny things, but for 
much of the middle third of the film, he doesn't, and this contributes to 
long stretches of comparative tedium. There are also some really bizarre 
moments, like the late introduction of another companion for Charlie and 
Irene, the weird albino Whitey (Michael Bowman), whose inclusion seems 
almost an afterthought. Or the inexplicable cameo appearance by tennis 
star Anna Kournikova, which seems to exist just so we can realise, "Hey, 
that's Anna Kournikova!"
Fortunately, things pick up heading into the home stretch, especially 
once Charlie and Hank start to coexist simultaneously. It is these scenes 
in particular that really give Carrey a chance to shine, and he makes 
exhaustive use of his rubber-faced, marionette-limbed repertoire. Carrey 
also does a good job playing Charlie and Hank as truly different yet 
fundamentally interconnected, and it's a shame his material wasn't more
consistent. His interaction with the boys, for instance, is priceless, as 
he slips effortlessly into urban slang: "That be whack!"
Zellweger is also enjoyable, and gives Irene enough strength to hold up 
against the human onslaught that is Carrey. But Irene is a poor successor 
to Cameron Diaz's character in "Mary", because whereas Diaz was both the 
instigator and victim of comic moments, Zellweger is usually just left to 
react to Carrey's antics.
There has been some controversy surrounding "Me, Myself & Irene", and the 
erroneous association of the term "schizophrenic" with Charlie's split 
personalities. Although the term "schizo" is used on occasion in the 
film, it is never employed by someone who should know better -- instead 
they spit out "advanced delusionary schizophrenia with narcissistic rage" 
like it rolled right off the tongue. The purported "controversy" is a 
non-starter.
Indeed, I was surprised to find that the subject of multiple 
personalities is not just used as ammunition for jokes, but instead earns 
some serious consideration as well. There is a theme running throughout 
"Me, Myself & Irene" that many people assume fabricated identities, be it 
for profit, or escape, or just to cover up a mistake. This is true not 
just of Charlie, but also Irene, Whitey, the corrupt cops, even Shonte 
the limo driver. "Me, Myself & Irene" being the kind of movie that it is, 
the idea is not pursued to any great lengths, but I appreciated its 
inclusion nonetheless.
I had great hopes for this reteaming of Jim Carrey and the Farrelly 
brothers (they first worked together on "Dumb And Dumber"), and in the 
final analysis I'll admit to feeling a little disappointed. "Me, Myself & 
Irene" is not the best comedy for either, trying but failing to be as 
funny and outlandish as superior entries in their respective
filmographies. But it is very entertaining all the same -- and if it 
doesn't appeal to the Charlie in you, maybe there's a little bit of Hank 
lurking inside that will enjoy it instead.

Title
Review for Contender, The (2000)
Directed by Rod Lurie, from his screenplay. Starring Joan Allen, Gary
Oldman, Jeff Bridges. Running time: 125 minutes. Rated AA for coarse
language by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 28th, 2000.
One of the most pertinent issues to arise out of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal was the question of what information the public has the right to
know about its elected officials. Some argue that personal dealings
reflect strongly on one's ability to serve their office, while others
maintain that public figures should be evaluated solely on the basis of
public performance.
Given the hot-button nature of the subject, it was inevitable that it
would make the transition to Hollywood and the big screen. The first such
film out of the gate is "The Contender", written and directed by Ron
Lurie. Although it is by no means an exact parallel of the Lewinsky
affair, raising some different concerns and ignoring others (would Clinton
have come under such scrutiny if Lewinsky had not been an intern in his
employ, for example?), "The Contender" follows it in broad strokes by
putting a public official on both public and political trial because of
alleged sexual improprieties in her past.
When his vice-president dies midway through his term of office, United
States President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) finds himself in the
position of having to choose a successor. Jack Hathaway (William L
Petersen) seems the obvious choice, having recently been labelled a hero
by the media for his (failed) effort to save a drowning woman.
Furthermore, Hathaway is a good friend of Evans' Republican nemesis,
Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman), who will chair the House committee charged
with approving Evans' choice. But Evans, determined to put a woman into
the second-most powerful position in the government, opts instead for
Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), a former Republican now sitting for the
Democrats.
But Hanson's candidacy is threatened when Runyon's investigators uncover
photographs and witnesses suggesting that Hanson was at the center of a
sex orgy while still in college. When Runyon confronts Hanson about the
story during her televised hearings, Hanson refuses to confirm or deny its
veracity, averring that it is none of the committee's -- or the public's
-- business. It soon appears that Evans may have no choice but to bow to
Runyon's wishes by dismissing Hanson and appointing a new
vice-presidential candidate.
The first three-quarters of "The Contender" comprises a terrific political
drama. Lurie puts into play several absorbing issues, from the obvious
questions of whether Hanson's past indiscretions should have any bearing
on her becoming vice-president, to the very role of women in politics. 
Although Lurie's Democratic leanings are hard to overlook, he maintains a
reasonably even hand throughout.
Nonetheless, there has been some controversy in the press that Lurie
edited "The Contender" to demonise Oldman's character. This simply is not
borne out by the movie itself. Shelly Runyon is not a nice man, to be sure
-- he is aggressive, manipulative and, it transpires, something of a
hypocrite. But he is also a man with strong principles, and it appears
that, by and large, he does in fact have the interests of the country at
heart, or at least the interests of the way he believes the United States
should be. In these days when there seems to be a perpetual fire sale on
political belief, as elected officials waver back and forth over the
issues for reasons that have nothing to do with their own opinions (if
they even possess them), it is gratifying to encounter a man who is
willing to stick to his views, even if those views are not necessarily
ones we agree with. Oldman's vision of Runyon as the movie's "one true
patriot" is not merely rhetoric.
Oldman paints such a vivid character in Runyon, though, that he largely
overshadows his fellow castmembers. Despite the complexity of the issues
surrounding them, neither Laine Hanson nor Jackson Evans are particularly
well-conceived individuals, and neither Allen nor Bridges succeed in
overcoming this flaw. Indeed, both characters suffer from the fact that
they are defined by the issues, and the issues alone. They do not seem to
exist in any sort of greater context.
We are never really convinced, for example, that Hanson really is suitable
vice-presidential material. We are told she is, but where is the
proof? Laine is on the defensive almost the entire movie, her
characterisation revealed only in the way she reacts to others. Her
moments of strength are reduced to sound bites. The result is that Allen's
performance feels vague and half-formed. It is good on the surface, but
lacks real depth. Bridges, meanwhile, never finds his stride as President
Evans. He is sometimes buffoonish, sometimes deviously intelligent, and
Bridges never manages to merge these aspects into a consistent
portrayal. Instead of appearing multi-faceted, Evans seems to suffer from
split personalities.
This weakness of character is indicative of the real problem with "The
Contender", which becomes plain in its closing moments. This is a movie
which is happy to raise issues, but shies away from making any real
statements about them beyond the very obvious. After an engrossing ninety
minutes of political intrigue, "The Contender" veers suddenly into prosaic
speechifying and, worse, an inappropriate deux ex machina ending which
sorely undercuts the integrity of the film. True, this plot device allows
Lurie to lend a nice sense of closure to the movie. But it is entirely
artificial; it eschews the powerful themes set up earlier in the film in
favour of a tidy ending.
That said, it is difficult to ignore the potency of "The Contender" as a
whole. I have been harsh on the movie, I admit, because I felt the ending
was such a disappointing kowtow to cinematic convention. But even despite
the mediocre characterisation of some of the leads, "The Contender", for
the vast majority of its running time, makes for engrossing viewing. If a
movie like this gives its audience pause to reconsider their own attitudes
toward their political leaders, that can only be a good thing.

Title
Review for Greenfingers (2000)
Directed by Joel Hershman, from his screenplay. Starring Clive Owen, Helen
Mirren, David Kelly. Running time: 91 minutes. This film is not yet rated
by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 8th, 2001.
Synopsis: Inmate Colin Briggs (Owen) is transferred to an experimental 
open-air prison. There, he meets venerable Fergus Wilks (Kelly), who 
sparks in Colin a seemingly incongruous interest in gardening. Colin 
convinces the prison governor to allow him to start a flower garden on the 
grounds, bringing him in contact with expert Georgina Woodhouse (Mirren) 
and her lovely daughter Primrose (Natasha Little). Thanks to Georgina's 
influence, the convicts receive an invitation to a major gardening 
competition. But will their pasts catch up with them before the big day?
Review: "Greenfingers" is a good-natured British comedy very much in the 
vein of "Saving Grace". Indeed, both mingle gardening with criminal 
activity, and fans of the latter will likely find much to enjoy in the 
former. British comedy tends toward two extremes: movies filled with 
outlandish set pieces (like the "Monty Python" films) and movies in which 
the comedy arises directly from real life, without indulging in one-liners 
or awkward set-ups. "Greenfingers" is very much of this second type: the 
humour here is derived directly from the simple idea of a group of 
convicts taking an interest in gardening, and from the personalities of 
the chief players. Those raised on more sitcom-like fare may find this 
low-key approach dull, but audiences with a broader appreciation of comedy 
should find it thoroughly delightful and refreshing. Of course, this sort 
of movie is highly dependent on the performances of its leads in 
enabling us to relate to the circumstances. Fortunately, "Greenfingers" 
boasts several fine contributions, particularly from Clive Owen, whose 
Colin is sympathetic but nonetheless retains an edge which reminds us that 
he is, all the same, a criminal. Also highly enjoyable is Helen Mirren; 
although "Greenfingers" scarcely taps into the full range of her acting 
talent, Mirren is hilarious as a sort of British Martha Stewart.

Review for Rock Star (2001)
Directed by Stephen Herek. Screenplay by John Stockwell. Starring Mark
Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston, Timothy Spall. Running time: 106 minutes.
Rated AA for nude scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on September 24th, 2001.
Synopsis: Chris Cole (Wahlberg) is the lead singer of a tribute band which 
covers his heavy metal idols, Steel Dragon. But Chris is so obsessed with 
getting the imitation precisely right that he finds himself drummed out of 
the group. As it happens, this coincides with Steel Dragon's ousting of 
their lead singer, and soon Chris -- together with girlfriend/manager 
Emily (Aniston) -- finds himself summoned to audition for the gig of his 
dreams.
Review: "Rock Star" probably could have been a much better movie had it 
been either much more humourous or much more serious. As it stands, it's 
an uncomfortable hodgepodge of melodrama and comedy, stuck in a hopelessly 
formulaic script by Stockwell, uninspiringly directed by Herek. "Rock 
Star" is like "Almost Famous" without a soul; there are no true characters 
here to explore, no situations of genuine pathos or wit. Instead, we are 
subjected to yet another brainless average-joe-makes-good plotline; there 
are a few decent laughs -- a fight between two competing tribute bands is 
a definite sight to see -- but more which fall flat. Stockwell's script is 
marred by moments of truly bad judgment; a post-concert orgy is apparently 
intended to demonstrate the seedy side of fame, but simply feels 
gratuitous. Some of the performances are worthy of praise; Spall in 
particular is good as jaded Steel Dragon road manager Mats. And Wahlberg 
brings a lot of enthusiasm to Chris, despite his lack of depth. But 
Aniston is just dull as Emily, and the rest of the supporting cast is 
singularly unmemorable. (Actually, I lie: Matthew Glave has two great 
early scenes as Chris' brother, but sadly is thereafter forgotten.) So 
trifling is the synergy between characters and audience that by the time 
we get to the pat, syrupy ending, it's frankly hard to care much anymore.

Review for Original Sin (2001)
Directed by Michael Cristofer. Screenplay by Cristofer, based on the novel
"Waltz Into Darkness" by Cornell Woolrich. Starring Antonio Banderas,
Angelina Jolie, Thomas Jane. Running time: 119 minutes. Rated AA for
sexual content by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 14th, 2001.
Synopsis: Wealthy Cuban landowner Luis (Banderas) gets more than he 
bargained for when he sends away for an American bride. Not only does his 
new wife turn out to be the beautiful Julia (Jolie), she also harbours a 
secret past of dubious merit. Soon, Julia has absconded with both Luis' 
fortune and his heart, and as he pursues his wife through the Cuban 
underworld, Luis begins to realise that, for him, there is no turning 
back.
Review: Given the absurdism of its would-be plot, it's unlikely that 
"Original Sin" could have been turned into a reputable piece of 
filmmaking, regardless of writer, director or stars. This is, at its 
heart, B-movie junk: a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain 
nor the heart but to the nether regions. That said, "Original Sin" could 
at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its 
trashiness and indulged in it. Instead, Cristofer seems to have mistaken 
this for a serious production, and directs it as such. The result is a 
vapid, uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses, as 
likely to incite a yawn as a thrill. Consider the initial sex scene 
between Banderas and Jolie: brightly-lit and mostly filmed from above, it 
looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show. Cristofer doesn't 
even manage to capture the allure of Cuba; instead of portraying his 
setting as a steamy, sensuous island paradise, it appears bland and 
lifeless. At least Banderas and Jolie manage to inspire some interest; 
there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script, 
but aren't being given the chance. The same cannot be said of Jane, whose 
Billy is nebbish and transparent. Also unwise is the Jolie framing 
sequence, which practically gives away the film's denouement.

Review for Harry, un ami qui vous veut du bien (2000)
WITH A FRIEND LIKE HARRY (2000) / ***
   aka HARRY, UN AMI QUI VOUS VEUT DU BIEN [French; English subtitles]
Directed by Dominik Moll. Screenplay by Gilles Marchand and Moll. Starring
Laurent Lucas, Sergi López, Mathilde Seigner. Running time: 117 minutes.
Rated AA for mature subject matter by the MFCB. Reviewed on September 
23rd, 2001.
Synopsis: Michel (Lucas) and his wife Claire (Seigner) are en route to 
their rustic summer cabin with their three unruly daughters. In a rest 
stop bathroom, Michel chances to meet Harry Ballestero (López), a 
childhood acquaintance. Harry and his girlfriend (Sophie Guillemin) 
finagle an invite to the cabin, and soon Harry has enmeshed himself in 
Michel's personal life. Are Harry's deeds truly as philanthropic as he 
claims, or are his true intentions far darker?
Review: "With A Friend Like Harry" is reminiscent of "Suspicion", amongst 
other Hitchcock films. In both, the plot builds slowly; although we know 
straight away that something not quite right is going on, it remains 
subtle, unpronounced and reveals itself bit by bit. The result is a 
splendid character drama, a guest-that-wouldn't-leave story that begins as 
merely creepy and becomes gradually more disturbing. The film's success 
hinges on the performances of its leads, and López in particular is up to 
the task. He lends a sinister edge to Harry: he smiles a little too much, 
lingers a little too long. But López is careful not to take this too far; 
it is not clear, at first, whether Harry is malevolent or just socially 
inept. Lucas, meanwhile, is very good in the everyman role; we can easily 
put ourselves in his place and wonder just how we would handle someone 
like Harry. Moll's direction is assured, and despite its sometimes mundane 
aspects (especially early on), "Harry" never lags. Like Hitchcock, if 
there are no thrills at hand, Moll fills the silence with humour -- but 
never so much that the atmosphere is ruined. Only the movie's rather 
abrupt ending disappoints, preventing what could be the intriguing 
fruition of the relationship between Harry and Michel. But then, Hitch's 
endings -- "Suspicion" included -- weren't always the greatest, either.

Review for Shrek (2001)
Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson. Screenplay by Ted Elliott,
Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman and Roger SH Schulman, with additional dialogue
by Cody Cameron, Chris Miller and Conrad Vernon, based on the novel by
William Steig. Starring Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz. Running
time: 89 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 27th, 2001.
Synopsis: Shrek (Myers) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in 
the heart of a forest, until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures 
fleeing the rule of the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Farquaad agrees 
to relocate the pests, on the condition that Shrek rescues Princess Fiona 
(Diaz) -- whom Farquaad desires to wed -- from a far-off castle. 
Grudgingly, Shrek sets out, joined in his quest by an unwanted companion, 
Donkey (Murphy).
Review: One memorable aspect of Disney's "Aladdin" was that it finally 
gave Robin Williams a character -- the Genie -- to best take advantage of 
his comic talents. "Shrek" does the same for Eddie Murphy; ironically, 
though, Murphy's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass. All the same, 
"Shrek" does represent Murphy's best comic outing in years, and as Donkey 
he steals all the best lines. For instance, after getting belted with 
pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature, 
Donkey soars into the air and scoffs, "Now I'm a flying talking donkey!" 
And despite its many contributors, the script for "Shrek" is full of such 
comic gems. Myers is delightful in more of a straight man role, and 
Lithgow also gets some great moments (watch for a hilarious repartee with 
the Gingerbread Man). "Shrek" takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy 
tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts, and reserves a few delightful 
knocks at Disney in the bargain. Things do go somewhat astray during the 
film's middle segment, which concentrates too much on the main characters 
at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the 
movie's greatest strength. But even then, one can always sit back and 
enjoy the beautiful computer animation, whose remarkable use here 
represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology.

Title
Review for Straight Story, The (1999)
Directed by David Lynch. Screenplay by John Roach and Mary Sweeney.
Starring Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek, James Cada. Running time: 106 
minutes. Rated PG (MFCB). Reviewed on April 24th, 2000.
"The Straight Story" tells a tale that would seem too far-fetched to be 
believed -- if it hadn't actually happened. Based on true events from the 
summer of 1994, director David Lynch's newest film is an unusual choice of 
project for the man behind sometimes baffling fare like "Twin Peaks" and 
"Lost Highway". But "The Straight Story" is pleasant and engrossing, and 
is also a rare motion picture that dares not only to feature a largely 
elderly cast, but also to treat them with considerable respect.
Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is 73 years old, a World War II 
veteran who has seen better days. His hips are giving out on him and his 
emphysema is getting worse. He lives with his daughter Rose (Sissy 
Spacek), who is mildly retarded but bright enough in her own way. One 
stormy night, Alvin learns from a relative that his brother Lyle has 
suffered a stroke. Alvin and Lyle were once as close as brothers could 
be, but they had a falling out ten years earlier and haven't spoken 
since. Desperately aware of both Lyle's mortality and his own, Alvin 
decides he has to make the journey from his home in Laurens, Iowa to 
Lyle's place in Mount Zion, Wisconsin.
Neither Alvin nor Rose have a driver's license, and Alvin is too proud to 
ask anyone else for help. So Alvin decides to hitch a trailer up to his 
battered old riding lawnmower and set out for Wisconsin, travelling no 
more than five or ten miles a day. His lawnmower soon breaks down, but 
Alvin is not swayed: he trades it in and uses the last of his money to 
buy a 1966 John Deere mower, then starts the journey all over again.
Alvin's slow voyage from Iowa to Wisconsin provides the framework around 
which the bulk of the movie is built. As is often the case in these sorts 
of films, the destination here is not nearly as important as what happens 
en route. (Indeed, the ending of "The Straight Story" is a beautifully 
underplayed scene, a real lesson in minimality that demonstrates Lynch's 
trust in his audience.) "The Straight Story" is "The Odyssey" writ small, 
with Alvin trundling from episode to episode like a wrinkly old Odysseus. 
None of these little stories are particularly fascinating, but put together 
they form a touching mosaic. It is through these chance encounters that 
Alvin's character is most fully illuminated and, moreover, that we are 
afforded a glimpse of the effect his passage has on others.
Some of these meetings are funny. Alvin witnesses a collision between a  
car and a deer, and learns that the driver (Barbara E Robertson) has 
killed more than a dozen of the creatures along that stretch of highway in 
the past six weeks. The problem is that she has to drive that route, 
back and forth every day, to get to work. Beyond quitting her job or  
moving, she simply has no other choice. "And I love deer!" she wails.
Other meetings are more serious. Alvin is nearly killed when he loses his 
brakes going down a steep hill. Shaken up and out of money until his 
next welfare cheque comes in, he is taken in by Danny and Darla Riordan 
(James Cada and Sally Wingert). The Riordans' friend Verlyn Heller (Wiley 
Harker) is a WWII veteran like Alvin, and one day at the local tavern 
the two share stories of the horrors of war. This is a beautifully acted 
sequence and again, Lynch shows faith in his viewers by leaving it 
static and quiet so that the audience can conjure in their own minds the 
scenes that Alvin and Verlyn relate.
As Alvin, Farnsworth does a very good job in an Academy Award-nominated 
performance. He gives the character considerable depth; his delivery in 
sequences like the aforementioned tavern scene are tinged with a lifetime 
of emotions. The only real drawback to the role -- and the same could be 
said of "The Straight Story" as a whole -- is that Alvin comes across 
as just a little too sweet, too coy. Although the very fact that he chose 
to endure the six-week journey is indicative of Alvin's character, I 
found it difficult to believe that he could really be so cherubic (and 
indeed, reports suggest that the real Alvin Straight, who died in 1996, was 
not quite as lovable as the movie implies). I don't think viewer sympathy 
would have been lost by giving Alvin a bit more of an edge, and I think 
it would have made him generally better-rounded.
None of the other actors have substantial screen time, but there is not a 
poor performance in the entire movie. Lynch is successful in coaxing just 
the right note out of all his cast, be it dramatic or comedic.
Like Stanley Kubrick in "2001: A Space Odyssey", Lynch successfully  
conveys the lethargic pace of Alvin's trip. There are long periods 
consisting of nothing but shots of Iowa farmland, for instance, and more 
than once the camera pans up from Alvin to the blue summer sky in a 
traditional passage-of-time shot, only to pan down again to show him just 
a few yards further along. This may induce boredom in some viewers, but 
for the most part I felt Lynch handled such scenes judiciously. They go 
on long enough to achieve their intended effect, but not so long that I 
began glancing at my wristwatch. The fact that these sequences are 
accompanied by gorgeous fiddle music composed by Lynch's frequent 
collaborator Angelo Badalamenti doesn't hurt, either.
Quiet, unassuming, gentle, endearing, "The Straight Story" is a delightful 
film. Here is a testimony not just to the principle that truth is 
stranger than fiction, and not just to one man's character and 
determination, but also to the innumerable little stories that are out 
there, just down the road, waiting to be discovered.

Review for U-571 (2000)
Directed by Jonathan Mostow. Screenplay by Mostow, Sam Montgomery and 
David Ayer, from a story by Mostow. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Harvey 
Keitel, Jake Weber. Running time: 119 minutes. Rated PG for mild language
by the MFCB. Reviewed on April 30th, 2000.
For the past few years, most movies set during World War II have been 
more about the mentality and morals of war than about simple military 
adventure and heroics. Even the last great submarine movie, "The Hunt For 
Red October," was as much a character study of Sean Connery's Captain 
Marko Ramius as it was a Tom Clancy actioner. "U-571" bucks this trend, 
hearkening back to the simple but exciting Saturday matinee flicks which 
were so popular half a century ago.
The plot here is straightforward, existing mainly as an excuse for 
deep-sea dramatics. A British destroyer has crippled a German U-boat, 
the U-571. The Allies are aware that the submarine is equipped with an 
Enigma device -- the key to unlocking Nazi ciphers, and possibly to 
winning the War. An American sub is sent out to reconnoitre with U-571, 
poising as a German supply ship. The American troops are to seize the 
vessel, capture the crew, and bring the Enigma back to their ship. All 
this has to be done without the Nazis getting suspicious, because if they 
find out the Allies have the Enigma, they'll just change their codes and all
will be for naught.
The mission, led by young up-and-comer Executive Officer Lieutenant 
Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), goes smoothly at first. Then the 
American sub gets torpedoed, killing most of its crew except for the 
U-571 boarding party. Trapped on the damaged German submarine, Tyler and 
his remaining men have to find their way back to Allied territory before 
they're discovered by the Nazis.
In terms of being sheer popcorn fare, "U-571" does a pretty good job. 
Although the film takes too long to get going, things heat up nicely once 
the Americans are trapped on board the U-boat, and the tension keeps 
building from there. Particularly exciting is a lengthy sequence in which 
the sub is being depth-bombed by a Nazi ship. Having devised a desperate 
plan for survival, Tyler orders his crew to take the dilapidated vessel 
deeper than it should go even under normal operating conditions. The 
explosions get nearer and nearer; the groaning of the bulkheads grows 
constantly louder. It's an engrossing piece of cinema.
But other plot developments are more routine. For instance, in the 
aftermath of the explosion of their ship, the Americans find the Nazi 
captain of the U-571 (Thomas Kretschmann), still manacled after his initial 
capture, struggling to stay afloat. In an act of mercy, Tyler has him 
pulled out of the water and chained up in the engine room. I was counting 
the minutes until the captain betrayed the Americans, and my expectations 
proved correct on not one but two occasions. A lot of the movie feels 
like this: standard action/military scenes transposed onto the submarine 
setting.
"U-571's" biggest deficiencies, though, lie in its almost total lack of 
characterisation. Part of what makes other war movies, like "Saving 
Private Ryan," so good is that each of the soldiers involved are 
portrayed with depth and feeling. They might not have a lot of screen 
time, but they feel like real people with real lives nonetheless.
The same cannot be said of the cast of "U-571", who prove to be a 
faceless, unmemorable bunch. Even the main stars play cookie-cutter 
characters. Take McConaughey's Andrew Tyler, for example. At the start of 
the movie, he argues with his commanding officer, Mike Dahlgren (Bill 
Paxton) about whether he's ready for his own command. Dahlgren doesn't 
believe he is, and explains why. By the end of "U-571", surprise 
surprise, Tyler has learned exactly those lessons Dahlgren had described. 
You could almost check them off a list as they come up. Tyler is just a 
standard military action hero, and what attempt there is to flesh him out 
comes across as transparent and uninspired, like the above. McConaughey 
does a decent enough job as the heroic lead, but to propel it, "U-571" 
needs its lead to be more interesting than that.
The other headliners are similar non-entities. Harvey Keitel plays the 
Chief as if he'd just stepped out of any one of a hundred similar movies. 
He's an old sea dog who hands out spoonfuls of advice every few scenes on 
cue. Jon Bon Jovi, in his acting debut, is passable but forgettable as 
Tyler's best friend, Pete Emmett. Paxton is surprisingly lacking in 
passion or involvement as Dahlgren.
At least "U-571" looks good. Despite the limited choices of location and 
camera angles, director (and co-writer) Jonathan Mostow keeps our eyes 
glued on the screen. There are some nice shots, for instance, where the 
camera actually follows the submarine as it dives beneath the waves. On 
the other hand, one thing Mostow seems to attempt with success is to 
convey a sense of claustrophobia in the leaky submarine. Characters sweat 
and look about nervously, and water drips from every corner. But the feeling
that those metal walls are closing about them -- just barely keeping out 
the crushing ocean waves -- simply isn't there.
As light entertainment, you could certainly do worse than "U-571". It's 
fun and exciting, and every now and then might even set your pulse racing 
a little faster. But ultimately, as a big-budget update of those old 
postwar action films, Mostow has borrowed a few plot elements and 
characters too many. And in the end, that's what sinks "U-571".

Imagine a movie in which Adam Sandler stars as a perpetual underdog with a
speech impediment who dotes on a parent. Despite himself, he acquires a
girlfriend who's a bit of a social reject herself. He finds a purpose in
his life; it involves Sandler getting knocked down a lot. Oh, and Henry
Winkler appears.
Quick, am I describing "The Waterboy" or "Little Nicky"?
Indeed, Sandler's latest comedy effort, "Little Nicky", bears an awful lot
of similarities to his blockbuster "The Waterboy" -- it just has more
special effects and extraneous cameo appearances. The level of humour and
the appeal of the two films are virtually identical. Basically, if you
like Adam Sandler movies, you'll probably like "Little Nicky". Otherwise,
chances are you'll be better off steering clear.
In "Little Nicky", Sandler plays the title character, the third and
youngest son of Satan (Harvey Keitel). Whereas Nicky is timid and loves
his Dad, his brothers -- devious Adrian (Rhys Ifans) and powerful Cassius
(Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr) -- want nothing more than to supplant their father
as ruler of Hell. When the Devil tells his boys that -- instead of
retiring after 10,000 years like his father before him -- he's going to
stay on for another ten-millennium term, a furious Adrian and Cassius flee
Hades for Earth, freezing the gates of Hell behind them. This prevents the
souls of sinners from entering the realm, and without them, Satan quickly
begins to physically deteriorate.
This means that it's up to Nicky to travel to Earth and convince his 
brothers to go home, before their father disintegrates completely. But
Adrian and Cassius have already begun turning our world into their own
private Hell, beginning with New York (presumably because it was the least
work). They use their demonic powers to possess major public and religious
figures, and have them promote acts of sin and degradation. Nicky teams up
with the awkward Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a talking bulldog named 
Beefy (voiced by Robert Smigel), and a motley crew of other misfits to 
save the day.
"Little Nicky" constitutes a series of wildly uneven gags; some of them
are hilarious, others fall desperately flat, and many just sit there
uncomfortably. It is Adrian's and Cassius' shenanigans which provoke the
biggest laughs -- they cause the legal drinking age to be lowered to ten
years old, for example, and make Regis Philbin talk about committing 
homicide on national television (at least, I think Regis was supposed to
have been possessed; it's been years since I saw "Live With..." so maybe 
he's always like that now). Ifans is particularly delicious as the fey,
machiavellian Adrian, camping up the screen like a latter-day Dr
Frankenfurter.
The other characters, though, are a largely unimpressive lot. Sandler
feels as though he's running in place with Nicky -- the differences
between this character and his past roles, such as Bobby Boucher in "The
Waterboy" and Robbie Hart in "The Wedding Singer", are fairly minimal,
Sandler has shown some capacity for comic range in the past, and he needs
to start demonstrating it as part of his movie career soon. Otherwise, he
risks quickly winding up in the same has-been hell as Paulie Shore and
similar would-be talents. With Nicky, he is playing a character who is
simply too soft and timid to match the caustic tone of the film. Instead
of being the center of attention like a lead actor should be, Sandler
stands on the sidelines for "Little Nicky".
Similarly, characters such as Arquette's Valerie and Nicky's roommate Todd
(Allen Covert) feel out of place and underdeveloped, being mostly the butt
of staid old jokes. Only Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran, who play two
would-be Satanists ("Devil groupies" might be more appropriate), are
particularly funny, and even they get pretty old, pretty fast.
"Little Nicky" is littered with cameo appearances by Sandler's acting
colleagues, particularly ex-"Saturday Night Live" castmembers. Some of
these work well: Jon Lovitz is amusing as an ill-fate peeping tom, and
Reese Witherspoon is enormously charming as a Valley Girl-like angel. But
many of them are just bizarre and off-putting -- consider Dana Carvey as
an evil referee, and especially Quentin Tarantino, who hams up the screen
as a crazy preacher. Even Rodney Dangerfield, who plays Nicky's
grandfather Lucifer, can't mine his brief appearances for laughs of any
kind. By and large, these cameos are just gratuitous and unnecessary, and
detract from the overall flow of the film.
"Little Nicky" basically amounts to a lightweight version of "Dogma", last
year's wonderful Kevin Smith religious comedy. It is a movie which 
certainly has its moments; I admit, I laughed out loud on more than one
occasion. But it is frustratingly uneven, and settles more than a few
times for the sorts of immature, unfunny gags which have become the staple
of major comedies in the past few years. If you're hoping for a devil of a
good movie, look elsewhere: "Little Nicky" is a minor demon at best.

Title
Review for Tailor of Panama, The (2001)
Directed by John Boorman. Screenplay by Andrew Davies, John Le Carré and
Boorman, based on the novel by Le Carré. Starring Pierce Brosnan,
Geoffrey Rush, Jamie Lee Curtis. Running time: 110 minutes. Rated AA for
mature subject matter and coarse language by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 
28th, 2001.
Synopsis: British spy Andy Osnard (Brosnan) is banished to Panama, where 
his superiors believe he will be incapable of stirring up trouble. But 
Osnard soon enters into a shady arrangement with tailor Harry Pendel 
(Rush), whose wife Louisa (Curtis) works in the administration of the 
Panama Canal. With Harry's reluctant assistance, Andy begins to weave a 
complex plan involving rebels and the Canal to hoodwink his bosses; and 
Harry may get caught in the crossfire.
Review: "The Tailor Of Panama" comes across as the most cynical James Bond 
movie ever filmed. Brosnan is an obvious casting choice, devilishly toying 
with the audience's preconceived expectations; where Bond is stylish, 
charismatic and heroic, Osnard is stylish, charismatic and utterly 
selfish. And whereas the typical James Bond movie is larger than life, 
full of explosions and colourful villains, "Tailor" is more of a character 
piece, and avoids vilifying anyone in particular. This is a tale of the 
greed of men and the stupidity of nations: how some choose to profit from 
it, and some merely try to survive it. Rush is excellent as Harry, a man 
who quickly realises he is caught up in something over which he has no 
control. Curtis, though, feels a bit wasted as Louisa, and her character 
is the most ill-defined of the principal cast. Boorman impresses with his 
careful direction, achieving an even balance between the script's more 
adrenaline-fueled moments and its essential intricacy. He also takes great 
advantage of the lush Panamanian setting, the whole movie looking as 
though it was filmed through a haze of heat and humidity. The ending does 
feel a bit unsatisfying, with events moving so quickly that it threatens 
the movie's coherency. But as an example of an espionage picture without 
the usual cartoonish superheroics, "The Tailor Of Panama" is impressive.

Title
Review for Center Stage (2000/I)
Directed by Nicholas Hytner. Screenplay by Carol Heikkinen. Starring
Amanda Schull, Zoe Saldana, Susan May Pratt. Running time: 116 minutes.
Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on May 21st, 2000.
There is an undeniable formula to movies like "Center Stage". In their 
home towns, the protagonists -- usually young, athletic and attractive -- 
have enjoyed success in their field of choice (here, ballet). Then they 
are thrust into the limelight, and find things more difficult than they 
ever expected. Their struggles to overcome this adversity all lead up to 
a single pivotal event which will either make or break their futures.
There's no getting away from this recipe; audiences seem to enjoy it, and 
it's pretty easy to write. Hence it is rare to find a film in this genre 
which actually tries to do something different. "Center Stage" is not 
that film, and so the question becomes not whether it is creatively 
noteworthy, but whether it makes good use of familiar material. 
Fortunately, the answer is yes: "Center Stage" is by no means a milestone 
in movie history, but it is very enjoyable and even exceptional in 
certain respects.
More than anything else, what helps "Center Stage" to rise above the pack 
is that it exudes a feeling of authenticity. Director Nicholas Hytner has 
made the inspired decision to cast actual dancers in several of the lead 
roles. Not only are these actors really performing, then, but they've 
also endured many of the same ordeals that their characters encounter -- 
everything from blistered feet to demanding instructors. Often when these 
sorts of experiments are attempted in movies, they fail because the
neophyte actors don't actually know how to act. "Center Stage" does not 
fall into the same trap, and while none of the castmembers exactly shine, 
for the most part they don't fall flat, either.
That said, likely the best performance amongst the large cast of 
characters comes from one of the actors who isn't a dancer by trade, 
Susan May Pratt as Maureen. Pratt enjoys what is probably the most 
complicated role in the film, as the star pupil of the American Ballet 
Academy who also happens to be its biggest snob. But Maureen's demeanour 
is as much a result of her domineering mother, and she yearns for a 
normal life outside ballet. Again, these are all timeworn character 
staples, but Pratt does a good job with Maureen, and wisely avoids 
Veronica Lodge-like exaggeration. Her development over the course of the 
movie is involving and believable, especially once she acquires a 
boyfriend and finds out how "normal" kids her age live.
Maureen's roommates include Jody (Amanda Schull), who has a lot of 
potential but can never seem to do things right; and the hot-headed Eva 
(Zoe Saldana). It is around Jody that "Center Stage" really revolves -- 
her dispiriting tribulations at the ABA, her attempts to recapture her 
love of ballet, and her romantic entanglements with ABA star Cooper 
(Ethan Stiefel) and the nebbish Charlie (Sascha Radetsky, sadly rather 
wooden and vapid throughout). Her story is the most routine, and while 
Schull herself is pleasant to watch, her character's misfortunes become 
grating after a while. The extent to which she blunders at the ABA is 
stretched to the point of disbelief, and at times the movie risks making 
her seem not just overwhelmed but downright incompetent.
Eva, a somewhat more interesting if no less stereotyped character, is 
unfortunately shunted to the background for large chunks of the movie. 
Indeed, there are so many subplots running through "Center Stage" that it 
is a credit to screenwriter Carol Heikkinen that the picture rarely feels 
cluttered. And while some stories are emphasised to the detriment of 
others, Heikkinen at least ensures that all of them achieve a modicum of 
development and completion.
The action of the movie follows the students through a year at the ABA. 
To the surprise of absolutely nobody, it all comes together at a major 
end-of-term concert which serves as an audition piece for ballet 
companies, particularly the prestigious American Ballet Company which 
Jonathan runs. Only three boys and three girls can be accepted into the 
Company, and the identities of the lucky winners will probably not come 
as much of a surprise.
Fortunately, despite the relative lack of suspense, this closing 
performance is altogether enthralling. The music, the choreography, the 
production design, and the skill of the dancers all contribute to a 
dazzling sequence which provides the perfect climax for the film. It also 
marks a splendid showcase of both classic and modern ballet, and is the 
best of several such performances littered throughout the movie. Only a 
rather bizarre editing decision midway through mars this scene, throwing 
the audience briefly out of the reality of the performance.
Nonetheless, the scene echoes the best of the Hollywood musicals of the 
1940s and 1950s, and the work of actor/dancers like Gene Kelly, Fred 
Astaire and Ginger Rogers. After viewing "Center Stage", it is hard not 
to mourn the death of the movie musical. This is not to say that, as a 
film, it is up to the standards of "An American In Paris" or "West Side 
Story". But "Center Stage" does make a valiant effort, and more than once 
it succeeds delightfully.

Title
Review for Apocalypse Now (1979)
Directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Screenplay by John Milius and Coppola,
based on the novel "Heart Of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad, with narration 
by Michael Herr. Starring Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall. 
Running time: 202 minutes. Rated R for offensive language throughout by 
the MFCB. Reviewed on October 8th, 2001.
Synopsis: In the midst of the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Sheen) is 
ordered to travel upriver into Cambodia in search of Colonel Walter Kurtz 
(Brando), who went AWOL and fled into the jungle. En route, Willard is 
witness to many of the horrors the war has wrought upon the countryside, 
and upon the men and women brought in to wage it.
Review: Few movies are so shattering as "Apocalypse Now". It tells of a
journey up a river, but in reality it is a journey into the very heart of 
madness. Each stop is more evidence of this: a colonel obsessed with 
surfing, an attack on the boat not with gunfire but with arrows and 
spears, a final American outpost manned by soldiers long since descended 
into insanity. And it all ends with Kurtz, raising a kingdom of the mad in 
the midst of the jungle, who does not just recognise the insanity of war, 
is not just a victim of it, but who thrives upon it. Sheen and Brando are 
outstanding. One plays a steely professional, the other a philosophical 
monomaniac, but both are crazy in their own way. "Apocalypse Now Redux" 
extends the lengthy film by about forty minutes, if anything accentuating 
the dreamlike atmosphere of the narrative. Some new scenes work, like a 
delirious second encounter with the Playboy bunnies and extra commentary 
by Kurtz. But the longest new segment, set at a French plantation house, 
jars us out of the rhythm of the story; even the hypnotic incidental music 
becomes trite and inappropriate. When I first saw "Apocalypse Now", I was 
unsure whether I truly liked it, but my appreciation for Coppola's triumph 
has only increased in the intervening years. "Redux" is not a stronger 
film, but it is a no less effective and mesmerising cinematic experience.

Review for Score, The (2001)
Directed by Frank Oz. Screenplay by Kario Salem, Lem Dobbs, and Scott
Marshall Smith, based on a story by Daniel E Taylor and Salem. Starring
Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Marlon Brando. Running time: 124 minutes.
Rated AA for offensive language by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 21st, 
2001.
Synopsis: Nick (De Niro) is a world-class burglar on the verge of 
retirement. At the behest of his old pal Max (Brando), Nick agrees to one 
last job, stealing a priceless sceptre from a government facility. Nick 
reluctantly teams up with a con man named Jack (Norton), who has 
insinuated himself inside the facility. But as Nick formulates a complex 
plan to acquire the sceptre, can he continue to trust the ambitious Jack?
Review: "The Score" is an entertaining, well-made film, but one that -- 
given the potency of its stars -- just isn't as good as it probably should 
have been. The mechanics of an enjoyable heist thriller are competently 
executed, but the picture lacks heart. The hook of the "criminal pulling 
one last job" is too familiar, and efforts to flesh out and lionise De 
Niro's Nick generally fall flat. Indeed, scenes such as those involving 
Angela Bassett (as Nick's love interest) just bog the film down; they feel 
superficial and obvious, and the two actors share little chemistry. Brando 
is obviously having a ball hamming it up as the effeminate Max, and "The 
Score" benefits from his all-too-rare presence. But the real star of the 
show is Norton, whose turn here as talented but conniving Jack is terrific 
to watch. The screenplay itself is fine, throwing in the requisite number 
of crosses and double crosses to maintain audience interest. Oz does a 
good job of keeping things lively even when working through the seemingly 
tedious logistics of Nick's plan; the final half hour is undeniably 
rivetting. There is a sense, though, of an opportunity missed. It's rare 
to gather three generations of Hollywood star power in one movie, and to 
waste it on what is, essentially, just another by-the-numbers action film 
(even an unusually intelligent one) seems, well, criminal.

Title
Review for New Waterford Girl (1999)
Directed by Allan Moyle. Screenplay by Tricia Fish. Starring Liane
Balaban, Tara Spencer-Nairn, Mary Walsh. Running time: 95 minutes. Rated
AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on July 12th, 2000.
Confession time: though I live in Newfoundland, I don't watch many 
Canadian movies. This is not exactly by choice -- the simple fact of the 
matter is that Canadian films make up an exceedingly small fraction of 
those shown at local theatres. Indeed, the only Canadian picture which 
showed locally during the first half of 2000 was "Misery Harbour", a 
co-production with Swedish, Norwegian and Danish firms.
The reason for this, I guess, is that Canadian cinema has a reputation 
for being very "artsy" and inaccessible. In my admittedly limited 
experience, I haven't seen a lot to dissuade me from that opinion. Like 
it or not, audiences in general prefer more mainstream fare, and until 
Canadian filmmakers accept this, the situation isn't likely to change.
Fortunately, at least one Canadian movie this year does fit the 
"mainstream" bill -- and without sacrificing its artistic integrity. That 
movie is "New Waterford Girl", fresh from the 1999 Toronto Film Festival, 
set in the coal-mining town of New Waterford, on Cape Breton island in 
Nova Scotia. For the geographically-challenged amongst you, Cape Breton 
lies about 60 miles across the Cabot Strait from the south-west corner of
Newfoundland, and its culture and atmosphere share a lot in common with 
this province. Consequently, I could easily relate to much of the 
material -- the accents and attitudes found in New Waterford are not 
dissimilar from many outport Newfoundland communities.
That said, "New Waterford Girl" is a movie for everyone, not just 
Atlantic Canadians. I do wonder, though, how many Mainlanders will 
recognise the pinpoint accuracy of the seemingly exaggerated portrayal of 
a rural Maritimes community. (If you don't know whether you're a 
Mainlander, trust me, you are one.)
New Waterford in the 1970s is an isolated, conservative town where 
Catholicism is still a vital part of everyday life. Fifteen year-old 
Mooney Pottie (Liane Balaban) is a talented artist, but has resigned 
herself to a life of limited possibilities. When her eccentric high 
school teacher (Andrew McCarthy) secures her a full scholarship to 
prestigious New York art school, Mooney is initially exuberant. But her 
family, including father Francis (Nicholas Campbell), mother Cookie (Mary 
Walsh) and four siblings, are horrified at the prospect of Mooney leaving 
New Waterford, convinced that no good will befall her.
Into this desperate milieu arrive Lou Benzoa (Tara Spencer-Nairn) and her 
mother Midge (Cathy Moriarty), the Potties' new next-door neighbours. 
They come from the Bronx, where Lou's ex-boxer father got into some sort 
of hot water with the law. Despite being treated with suspicion by the 
locals ("You're not Catholic?"), the free-spirited Lou falls in love with 
New Waterford and quickly befriends Mooney, reinvigorating her dreary 
life. With Lou's help, Mooney concocts a scandalous scheme to escape New 
Waterford by ruining her own virginal reputation and then claiming she's
pregnant. This will ensure a trip to Antigonish (on the Nova Scotia 
mainland) to have the purported baby, from where she can travel to New 
York before anyone is the wiser.
Although the story of "New Waterford Girl" is fairly typical 
coming-of-age fare, rarely has this sort of tale been told with such 
delicious humor. The script, by Tricia Fish, is peppered with lovely 
moments. Witness the scene where Mooney feebly "tries out" for the 
national high jump team, for example, and patiently explains that her 
poor performance was because "these aren't my normal shoes". Delightfully 
inventive is a subplot in which Lou discovers that pugilism runs in her 
blood and becomes the enforcer for the lovelorn ladies of New Waterford. 
Only a climactic boxing match feels contrived.
There is also a certain authenticity to the proceedings: the teens of New 
Waterford get drunk and make out and argue with their families just like 
young people really do. There is little of the exaggerated behaviour that 
often characterises these sorts of movies; at times "New Waterford Girl" 
has an almost documentary feel.
The direction by Allan Moyle ("Pump Up The Volume") is very capable, 
abetted by Derek Rogers' cinematography. The stark, uncompromising beauty 
of the Cape Breton coastline is depicted superbly, without making the 
movie feel like a travelogue. The only tech problem is the sound, which
sometimes results in indistinct dialogue.
But "New Waterford Girl"'s biggest asset is its cast, excellent almost 
without exception. Newcomer Liane Balaban is a real find, looking not 
unlike Natalie Portman and -- more importantly -- with acting skills to 
match. Her Mooney is a wonderful character, neither too cynical nor too 
pitiable, and with a palpable intelligence. Mooney's scheme to fake 
pregnancy could have come across as goofy, but the conviction Balaban 
brings to the role makes it work.
Spencer-Nairn's Lou provides a good contrast, vivacious and daring. 
Mooney can't wait to get out of Cape Breton; Lou enjoys New Waterford, a 
welcome change from timeworn plot of the big city kid who moves to a 
small town and loathes it. Spencer-Nairn has terrific chemistry with 
Balaban and a real presence onscreen. The only thing that mars her 
performance is that the film seems to conveniently forget its implication 
that the Benzoas are on the run. That Lou seems utterly dismissive of the 
fact struck me as hard to swallow.
Amongst the supporting players, veteran actors Campbell ("Da Vinci's 
Inquest") and Walsh ("CODCO", "This Hour Has 22 Minutes") are grand as 
Mooney's parents, evoking both desperation and honest caring when 
confronted with Mooney's situation. As for the two big-name Hollywood 
actors, Moriarty is rather underutilised, but McCarthy delivers a 
laudable low-key performance.
It's unfortunate that more people don't have the chance right now to see 
"New Waterford Girl" (it's making its way only slowly across Canada, and 
the producers have yet to secure a US distribution deal so it will 
probably be confined to festivals). It is a touching and funny movie, and 
marks the start of a very promising career for Balaban. As "New Waterford 
Girl" ably demonstrates, Canadian cinema is alive and well. I, for one, 
am eager to see more of it.

Review for Thirteen Days (2000)
Directed by Roger Donaldson. Screenplay by David Self, based on the book
"The Kennedy Tapes -- Inside The White House During The Cuban Missile 
Crisis" by Ernest R May and Philip D Zelikow. Starring Kevin Costner,
Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp. Running time: 145 minutes. Rated PG for mild
language by the MFCB. Reviewed on January 19th, 2001.
It's sometimes said that today's society -- especially in North America 
-- is lacking a modern mythology. We have no counterpart to the Greek 
myths of two thousand years ago, the Norse sagas of the first millennium, 
or the Arthurian legends of the Middle Ages. But this really isn't true; 
we have developed our own mythology, but not one populated by gods and 
demons and magicians. Instead, it is made up of actors like Marilyn 
Monroe, singers like Elvis Presley, Prime Ministers like Pierre Trudeau... 
and Presidents, like John F Kennedy.
Few figures in recent history have accumulated such a body of folklore as
the thirty-fifth president of the United States. Much of this is derived 
from the mystery surrounding his assassination, of course, but it extends 
back further than that, to the various crises which highlighted JFK's term 
of office, his rumored romantic liaisons, and so on. And the mythology 
encompasses the rest of his family too, from his brother Robert to his
son, John Junior.
If John F Kennedy is a figure of modern mythology, then "Thirteen Days"
stands as one of the legends which make up his myth, an "Odyssey" to his
Ulysses. Like any good legend, of course, it is a fictionalised version of
the true events. But, although the screenplay by David Self plays fast and
loose with real history, it does so in a manner which avoids overt
sensationalism. "Thirteen Days" effectively portrays the tension and
paranoia of the time -- the feeling that one wrong decision could mean not
only the end of free society, but human civilisation itself.
"Thirteen Days" chronicles the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
During routine aerial surveillance of Castro-controlled Cuba, the American
military captures photographic evidence of Russian nuclear missile
emplacements on the island -- contrary to the Soviet promise that they
would not equip communist Cuba with offensive weaponry. Aware that the
combination of short- and medium-range missiles threaten the integrity of
much of the continental United States, a special committee of top White
House and military brass is quickly formed to map out strategy.
Leading these sessions are President Kennedy (played here by Bruce 
Greenwood, looking not very much like the real JFK but successfully
channelling his fire and sagacity) and Attorney General Robert Kennedy
(Steven Culp, looking very much indeed like the real Bobby). They're
assisted by their boyhood friend Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner). The
Kennedys quickly find themselves under pressure (especially from the Joint
Chiefs of Staff) to abandon any efforts at a diplomatic solution and
undertake a full-scale military deterrent. JFK is well aware that such a
maneuver carries with it the very real risk of nuclear war -- but with
just days left to go before the weapons in Cuba become operational, and
even more Russian ships steaming toward the island, time to find an
alternative is quickly running out.
Under the careful direction of Roger Donaldson ("Dante's Peak"), "Thirteen
Days" perfectly evokes the atmosphere of October 1962; it is difficult not
to feel transported back to the turbulent Cold War era. The film has
received some criticism for playing up the antagonism between the
administration -- particularly the Kennedys, O'Donnell and Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker) -- and the military brass over
appropriate tactics. There is a persistent implication running throughout
the movie that the Joint Chiefs are trying to bully the President and have
their own way in the Crisis: "this is a setup," intones O'Donnell.
But even if such scheming and dissension did not really occur behind the
scenes, their place in this film is not unwarranted. Because certainly,
even if the politicos were in accord, the general population was not --
the United States was a seething mass of opposing viewpoints. Just as many
people wished to avoid the possibility of war at all costs, there was
also a sizeable number who wanted to duke it out with the Reds at the
nearest opportunity. "Thirteen Days", then, transposes this mix of popular
opinion onto the nation's leaders, and is thereby able to bring such
conflict to the fore.
That said, the picture does not neglect the common man either. Indeed,
that's basically the role that O'Donnell is supposed to play. In real
life, he was a minor figure in the Crisis, a footnote in the historical
annals. In "Thirteen Days", he is used as the audience's point of view on
the proceedings, a man who has very little direct involvement in the
political maneuverings but who is nonetheless in a position to watch the
situation unfold from beginning to end. Donaldson's most successful use of
O'Donnell comes when he sends him out onto the streets of Washington
midway through the crisis, to see firsthand how the country is reacting to
the Crisis.
But unfortunately, O'Donnell's effectiveness in "Thirteen Days" is at best
mixed. While he has his uses, there are times when he feels more like 
extra baggage -- hanging around in the background of scenes and tagging
along after the Kennedys like a groupie in suit and tie. To make matters
worse, Costner is burdened with a laughable New England accent that
recalls his similarly ludicrous effort in "Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves".
It is not impossible to see beyond this and recognise that Costner
delivers a solid performance as O'Donnell -- consider, for example, a
well-acted scene in which he tries to persuade an Air Force captain to
betray convention and hide certain facts from his superiors for the
national good. But in order to work well, O'Donnell needs to be an almost
invisible presence in the film, and Costner's casting makes this virtually
impossible.
Still, "Thirteen Days" is a potent film which does an excellent job of
taking well-documented historical fact and turning it into a 
suspense-filled drama. Donaldson rarely falters, and the cast approaches
the material with perfect conviction. I wasn't alive during the Cuban
Missile Crisis -- but now I almost feel like I was there.

Title
Review for Hollow Man (2000)
Directed by Paul Verhoeven. Screenplay by Andrew W Marlowe from a story by
Gary Scott Thompson and Marlowe. Starring Kevin Bacon, Elisabeth Shue,
Josh Brolin. Running time: 112 minutes. Rated R for extreme violence and
offensive language throughout by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 7th, 2000.
What would you do if you could turn invisible? The possibilities are
virtually limitless. There are the cheap, visceral thrills, such as 
sneaking into changing rooms and dormitories. There are more noble
pursuits, like acting as a genuine force for good in your community.
Perhaps you could offer your services to the government as a crack
espionage agent. Well, if the makers of "Hollow Man" are to believed,
you'd probably take a page from any generic slasher movie of the past
twenty-five years and start hunting down your friends in gory, if not
particularly imaginative, ways. Uh huh.
Inspired by, though not really similar to, HG Wells' novel "The Invisible
Man", "Hollow Man" is about a team of scientists trying to create an
invisibility formula (here it's described as "going out of quantum synch"
with the universe, but of course that's just the technobabble 
explanation). The project head is Dr Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), an
arrogant genius with more than a slight streak of megalomania. His
assistants include ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and Matt (Josh 
Brolin), who are sleeping together behind Sebastian's back.
In fact, the team has already figured out how to make people become
invisible -- the problem lies in trying to reverse the effects. In a flash
of inspiration one night, Sebastian thinks he figures it out, and indeed
their test gorilla Isabelle is successfully made visible again. Without
informing his superiors, Sebastian decides to proceed to the next stage of
the experiment and test both serums on a human subject: himself. But
although he becomes invisible without undue difficulty, the antidote
proves to be useless on humans, and Sebastian is trapped in his
phantomlike state. Soon, the tantalising possibilities invisibility offers
become too much for Sebastian, and he begins to succumb to his base
desires.
"Hollow Man" falls short in all moviemaking fundamentals: plot,
characterisation, atmosphere. Even Paul Verhoeven's directorial flair, 
striking in "Total Recall" ten years ago, is absent here, as the director
continues the downward spiral most recently evident in the tedious
"Starship Troopers". I find it appalling that a movie can take such a
great, multifaceted concept -- invisibility -- and hogtie itself to a
standard old slasher storyline. And "Hollow Man" isn't even a particularly
good slasher film, because we're not so much as afforded an interesting
death sequence. Sebastian's murderous rampage, when it finally comes, is
without tension, excitement, or invention. It's just an invisible guy
killing people, as if that single gimmick would somehow enliven the entire
film. There's no effort to create any suspense, or to really shock the
viewer; it just feels like the filmmakers are going through the motions,
and rather feebly at that.
Personally, I'm more interested in special effects where I can see
something, rather than those where I can't. Sure, a good job is done to
achieve the appearance (as it were) of invisibility, and I'm sure it took
a lot of hard work, but the gosh-wow factor is exhausted pretty quickly.
The same goes for the scenes where Sebastian suddenly becomes
semi-visible, when he is immersed in water or smoke or whatever. The first
such sequence is appealing; the concept gets tired soon thereafter. 
Indeed, the only effects which really left an impression on me were the
scenes where the invisibility formula and its antidote are employed --
first on a gorilla, then on Sebastian. Instead of taking effect all at
once, the serums work layer by layer, giving us a view of the inner
workings of the bodies like an anatomy textbook brought to life.
Beyond this, there is little to recommend "Hollow Man". Kevin Bacon does a
reasonable job in a role in which his voicework is paramount. But 
Sebastian Caine is a desperately uninteresting character. We are robbed of
the chance to investigate whether or not it is invisibility which has
affected his mind, because he's clearly on the edge even before the
experiment. A far more interesting approach to have taken would have
been to give us a less unscrupulous character and really delve into the
temptations he experiences. Sebastian is already such a bastard that his
swift decision to abandon his already loose morals comes as little
surprise. I realise that "Hollow Man" is, first and foremost, a thriller,
and I am not suggesting that it should have been bogged down in ethical
posturing. But I think a more clever movie could have balanced its
protagonist's inner turmoil with the requisite action scenes.
To make matters worse, the screenplay by Andrew W Marlowe (from a story
co-conceived with Gary Scott Thompson) doesn't even come up with
interesting things for the invisible Sebastian to do. Indeed, of all the
scenes involving Sebastian's abuse of his power, the only one that's at
all intriguing is the very first one, where he molests a co-worker (Kim
Dickens), with her being only barely aware of it. There is a definite
eroticism to this scene, not the least because of the conflict previously
established between the two characters. But it's all downhill from there
-- we subsequently get another excuse for partial nudity, and then it's
slasher time. That such a fantastic premise is so thoroughly wasted is the
surest sign of the sheer creative bankruptcy of the movie.
Amongst the supporting cast, Shue and Brolin try gamely to play the
heroes, but neither of their characters have much personality to speak of.
The film's engagement in a bit of role reversal, casting Shue as the more
proactive of the pair, is but a minor triumph. Most of the other
characters are simply there to act as cannon fodder, although Dickens and
Joey Slotnick make the most of their small roles. No fair guessing who
survives and who doesn't, though. In order to surprised on that point,
there would have to be some imagination behind the movie. On the set of
"Hollow Man",  it seems that bodies weren't the only things made to
vanish.

Title
Review for High Fidelity (2000)
Directed by Stephen Frears. Screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink,
John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg, based on the novel by Nick Hornby.
Starring Cusack, Todd Louiso, Jack Black. Running time: 113 minutes.
Rated AA for offensive language (MFCB). Reviewed on April 12th, 2000.
Here they are, my all-time Top Five Things To Know About "High Fidelity":
1. The synopsis (well, every review's got to have a synopsis, right?).
Relationships and music, music and relationships -- that's pretty much
what "High Fidelity" is all about. John Cusack plays Rob Gordon, a
thirtysomething record store owner whose longtime girlfriend Laura (Iben
Hjejle) has just left him. Watching her drive away, Rob makes up a list
of his top five worst break-ups, and is delighted that Laura hasn't made
the cut. At a crossroads in his life, Rob decides to revisit each of these
five former lovers (including half the cast of "The Haunting"). He hopes
that in so doing, he will finally figure out why all of his romantic
entanglements turn out disastrously. Meantime, he's also got to decide if
he's happy spending his days running a record store, or if he wants to get
something more out of life.
There can be little doubt that this movie turns on John Cusack's everyman
qualities. Cusack has always had a broad appeal, even when he's portrayed
such unusual characters as a professional assassin ("Grosse Pointe Blank")
and a puppeteer with a mystical connection to John Malkovich ("Being John
Malkovich"). In "High Fidelity", for once he's playing a character who
isn't larger-than-life. Rob Gordon is a pretty regular guy, with a regular
job and regular problems; it's hard not to relate, so the movie is
accessible on a very fundamental level. His overriding passion is music,
and his life is replete with its trappings, but not to the point where we 
feel alienated from him. For example, to help himself get over Laura, he
reorganizes his record collection. "Chronologically?" he's asked.   
"Autobiographically," he replies, and our gut reaction is no different   
than if he were eating cookie dough ice cream. Rob is a well-crafted
character, and Cusack's portrayal of him is spot on -- if its main
character weren't someone the audience could relate to, "High Fidelity"
would have been a flop.
The toughest aspect of Cusack's performance is the fact that he makes
frequent asides to the audience; indeed, in several cases these asides   
become full-blown soliloquies. But Cusack knows how to deliver a
monologue; he keeps them lively and interesting, without exaggerating for
effect. Indeed, these are some of "High Fidelity"'s most enjoyable scenes,
which is an accomplishment, given that this kind of filmmaking device
often comes across as stagy and dull.
Cusack might be the high point of "High Fidelity", but it doesn't hurt
that he's been placed in pretty talented company. Of particular note are 
Todd Louiso and Jack Black as Dick and Barry, Rob's employees at the
record store, die-hard music buffs who were hired as part-time help years
ago and haven't stopped showing up since. Barry is the loud and boisterous
one, while Dick is reserved and polite. Together, they form one of the
best comic double acts in quite some time. Also very good is Iben Hjejle
as Laura. Hjejle's is the film's most complex role: for much of the movie,
she has to be convincingly at odds with the protagonist, but at the same 
time not come across as "the villain", nor forget that Laura and Rob did
once care about each other -- and, perhaps, still do. The relationship   
between Rob and Laura is meant to be realistic, and even though we're
seeing everything from Rob's biased perspective, this sense of realism
would have been shattered had Hjejle's performance not been so moderate
and considered.
In addition to the movie's main cast, a number of popular actors have    
extended cameos in "High Fidelity". These are a lot of fun, especially
since several of the actors are playing either exaggerated versions of   
their public image, or else totally against type. For example, Tim Robbins
is cast as Ray, an irritating, ponytailed faux-intellectual who is Laura's
new love interest. One of the movie's funniest scenes depicts Rob
fantasizing about all the things he'd like to do Ray when the latter
confronts him over Laura. Needless to say, the fantasies are neither
pretty nor anything approximating reality. Catherine Zeta-Jones,
meanwhile, plays Rob's ex-girlfriend Charlie, a sensuous high-society    
type who may not be everything Rob remembers.
Based on the 1995 novel by Nick Hornby, "High Fidelity" is a hilarious
and eclectic look at love, but one which will likely ring true to many
viewers. Particularly interesting is the way the movie's version of events
is subordinate to Rob's views on his life. Our introduction to various   
characters and situations is colored by his opinions and memories, and so
even though it might feel like we're getting the whole story, there are  
times when we're really only getting a Rob-biased perspective on things.  
As Rob uncovers the misunderstandings and misconceptions which have
dominated his love life, so too do we.
Probably the only real downside to "High Fidelity" is a subplot about
Rob's desire to be a record producer. Although it does arise naturally
from the film's subject material, it nonetheless feels artificially      
appended to the movie, there mostly to give the events a typical Hollywood
ending. But "High Fidelity" doesn't really need this; its proper climax
comes fifteen minutes before the credits roll, and the extra material
ultimately feels like padding. Funny padding, yes, but padding
nonetheless.
But this is a minor flaw. "High Fidelity" is a fun, lightweight movie
which derives its laughs not from scripted routines but from experiences 
most anyone who's ever been in a relationship (or even just wanted to be 
in a relationship) will be familiar with. It is a film which draws its   
audience in slowly, and plays out gradually, and this may lose people     
looking for a more high-octane ride. But in its totality, "High Fidelity"
is an experience which is not just entertaining, but also very true.

Title
Review for Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (2000)
BOOK OF SHADOWS: BLAIR WITCH 2 (2000) / *** 1/2
Directed by Joe Berlinger. Screenplay by Dick Beebe and Berlinger. 
Starring Jeffrey Donovan, Kim Director, Stephen Barker Turner. Running
time: 90 minutes. Rated R for offensive language throughout by the MFCB.
Reviewed on October 30th, 2000.
It comes as little surprise that "The Blair Witch Project"'s phenomenal
success in 1999 -- building up from film festival hype early in the year,
through to its box office domination in mid-summer -- would lead to a
rapid sequel. Unusually, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, the
masterminds behind the first film, had little to do with "Book Of
Shadows: Blair Witch 2" (they serve as executive producers only). Instead,
the reins have been turned over to documentarian Joe Berlinger.
What Berlinger has crafted is a film as unlike "The Blair Witch Project" 
as that movie was from its horror/thriller ancestors. There are key
similarities -- all the actors are relative unknowns who play characters
with their own names; amateur camerawork plays an important role,
although here it is more a plot device than a stylistic ploy; and the
ending is perhaps even more maddeningly ambiguous than the original,
leaving audiences again wondering just what it was they witnessed.
But while "The Blair Witch Project" was mostly an exercise in
atmospherics, playing upon primordial fears of being lost in the woods,
the curiously-titled "Book Of Shadows" (no such artefact appears in the
movie) favours a more conventional horror storyline to comment upon its
themes. "Video never lies," claims one character early on. "Book Of
Shadows" asks the question, what if a video (or film, or whatever) 
differed from your own recollections? In a way, then, "Book Of Shadows" 
deals with a very modern fear, but one whose roots are ancient -- the
paranoia of knowing you are innocent even if all the evidence suggests
your guilt. Berlinger ties this into an undercurrent about the supposition
that violent media breeds violent people, as well as some wry commentary
on the success and saturation of "The Blair Witch Project" in general.
Much like the original movie played with the conceit that it was Heather
Donahue's "actual" footage (and convinced millions that it was a
depiction of actual events), "Book Of Shadows" picks things up as hordes
of fans invade Burkittsville, the hamlet which, according to "Blair
Witch" mythology, stands on the site of the original Blair township. "Book
Of Shadows" muddles reality here -- many of the Burkittsville residence
are steadfast that "The Blair Witch Project" is just a movie and yet such
hallmarks as the ruins of Rustin Parr's house (where Heather Donahue and
Mike Williams met their final recorded fate) actually exist.
The first five minutes is a hilarious spoof of the "Blair Witch" frenzy. 
One woman, for example, explains how she used to sell "Blair Witch" stick
figures from her home and on the Internet, until one day a man dropped by
and also wanted to buy rocks from her back yard. So now she sells stick
figures and rocks -- but the rocks don't sell so well online "because
rocks cost more to ship". But this sequence almost threatens to undermine
the tension right off the bat, and a humorous vein running throughout the
movie is poorly conceived and unnecessary.
We next meet Jeffrey Donovan, a "Blair Witch" fan who is just starting up
a tour of the Black Hills forest called the Blair Witch Hunt. His first
customers include Stephen Turner and his pregnant girlfriend Tristen
Skyler, who are researching a book about the "Blair Witch" hysteria; Erica
Leerhsen, a Wiccan who sees Elly Kedward -- the purported Blair Witch --
as a tragic, misunderstood figure; and Kim Director, a Goth who seems to
possess telepathic abilities. Things start to get weird almost from the
word go when, upon reaching the foundations of Rustin Parr's house, they
discover an enormous tree has sprung up in its midst.
Despite this spooky occurrence, the five settle in for a night of 
carousing, interrupted only by a confrontation with another tour group
which tries to lay claim to the Parr ruins. They vow to party all through
the night, but awaken the next morning with the realisation that they
cannot account for five hours. More mysterious still, all the recording
equipment Jeff brought him has vanished -- except for the tapes
themselves, which are discovered in the same hollow as Heather Donahue's
tapes some years earlier. They return to Jeff's home in a dilapidated
broom factory to view the tapes and find out what happened during their
blackout. But eldritch visions haunt them, and they slowly realise that
something may have returned with them from the Black Hills.
Like the first movie, "Book Of Shadows" manages to coax decent 
performances from its essentially unknown cast. While none of the leads in
the sequel enjoy quite so powerful a moment as Heather's "I'm so sorry" 
soliloquy -- and the improvisational feel of the original is sadly absent
-- there is still some good work here, especially from Skyler and Turner. 
Director is fun, but doesn't really enjoy a lot of range. Leerhsen,
although very charismatic, is defined by her religion and never really
moves beyond that. Donovan, unfortunately, fails to establish a
consistency of portrayal, and is not helped by being saddled with the
picture's most puzzling character -- his status as a former mental patient
is constantly referred to, but this never really comes into play, and
hangs like a loose end.
Berlinger paces the movie well, piling on the strangeness without letting
the movie descend into utter confusion. Make no mistake: the actual chain
of events is not clear, and this may frustrate some viewers. But this is 
by design, not accident, and is the reason "Book Of Shadows" provides 
almost the same level of psychological trauma as its predecessor. It is
true to say that Berlinger makes some missteps -- his portrayal of the
Burkittsville locals, including a farcical sheriff, is downright insulting
at times, and his failure to develop the "Blair Witch" mythos in any
meaningful manner is disappointing. Nonetheless, "Book Of Shadows" is
an effective and worthy successor to "The Blair Witch Project". Now you'll
never think of camping or camcorders the same way again.

Title
Review for Vertical Limit (2000)
Directed by Martin Campbell. Screenplay by Robert King and Terry Hayes, 
from a story by King. Starring Chris O'Donnell, Robin Tunney, Bill Paxton. 
Running time: 126 minutes. Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on December 
16th, 2000.
I can remember clearly the moment I knew "Vertical Limit" was going to be 
a disappointment. Chris O'Donnell walks through a camp at the base of K2, 
the world's second tallest mountain. Another climber, played by Izabella 
Scorupco, spots O'Donnell. And that's when The Look transpires between 
them. They look, and they look, and they look. So artificial and 
transparent is the scene that it would have worked better had Scorupco 
been wearing a big sign around her neck reading "O'Donnell's Love 
Interest" -- at least that would have been worth a chuckle.
But "Vertical Limit" is short on imagination, and long on predictability 
and shallowness. It is populated by characters into whom very little 
thought has obviously been invested; they exist purely to fill their roles 
in the paper-thin plot and, once they have served this role, they are 
dispensed with, one way or another. That's how you know that, inevitably, 
Scorupco and O'Donnell will end up together. Or consider the mountaineer 
Skip (Robert Taylor). His purpose in "Vertical Limit" is to use his status 
at the K2 camp to goad others into joining O'Donnell on a rescue mission. 
This accomplished, an arbitrary whim of the story shunts him out of the
action, and he practically vanishes from the screen.
No more inventive are the plot twists, most of which hinge on the 
canisters of nitroglycerine the characters carry with them as they 
speedily ascend K2. It's bad enough that the explosive force of the nitro 
seems to vary depending on the needs of the plot (at one point, an entire 
crateful barely destroys a shed; later, a single canister nearly 
devastates a mountainside). It's even worse that the stuff seems to 
survive any amount of jostling, unless the story demands that it suddenly 
become a peril. But the sheer stupidity of the characters around it -- 
leaving a crate, which had been carefully stowed away, open in the 
sunshine for no good reason; or, later, sitting five feet away from it 
when they know there's a good chance it might explode -- is positively 
criminal.
To be fair, there are some good, tense moments. Mountaineering is an 
extremely hazardous sport, and "Vertical Limit" effectively conveys the 
many disasters which can befall even the most experienced climber. One of 
the best scenes in the movie sees Scorupco trying to save a fellow 
mountaineer, who is clinging by his pickaxe to the edge of a snowy ledge. 
As Scorupco edges out toward him, the ledge slowly starts to break away, 
threatening to pitch them both into the abyss beyond. Similarly, a scene 
where O'Donnell jumps a wide chasm and barely manages to hook himself into 
the opposite mountain face is genuinely exciting (even if, in reality, he 
probably would have torn his shoulders from their sockets).
But the dangers become too repetitive, too quickly. There's only so many 
times a yawning chasm, an incipient avalanche, or the ubiquitous 
nitroglycerine can be brought into play and still make the audience 
anxious. Director Martin Campbell ("Goldeneye", "The Mask Of Zorro") 
simply doesn't find a way to make each danger seem new and rivetting.
Of course, it's hard to expect much from a movie which borrows from 
Sylvester Stallone's "Cliffhanger" from the word go. O'Donnell plays Peter 
Garrett, a climber along with his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) and father 
Royce (Stuart Wilson). While scaling a sheer cliff face, the ineptitude of 
a couple of novice mountaineers puts the Garrett family in jeopardy, 
hanging from a single carabiner. Royce, who is on the bottom, tells Peter 
to cut him loose, since he knows the carabiner can't support the weight of 
all three of them. Reluctantly, Peter does so; in one of the movie's most 
gratuitous scenes, we then see Royce's body thud to the ground far below.
Three years later, Peter is a photographer for the National Geographic 
Society. He and Annie -- now a world-renowned speed climber -- are no 
longer on speaking terms, because she blames Peter for their father's 
death. By coincidence, Peter ends up in the vicinity of K2 at the same 
time as Annie, who is helping billionaire Elliott Vaughn (Bill Paxton) 
scale the peak as part of a publicity gimmick. Vaughn pretends that K2 
expert Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) is in charge of the ascent, but when bad 
weather hits and Tom wants to turn back, Vaughn goads him into continuing
on. Soon, the party is hit by a ferocious avalanche; everyone is killed 
except Vaughn, Annie and Tom, who fall into a crevasse. This leaves Peter 
to mount a desperate mission to save the trio before thirty-six hours pass 
and they all die from pulmonary edema.
Beyond this point, "Vertical Limit" transpires in typical disaster-movie 
fashion: a variety of supporting characters are introduced, only to be 
killed off one by one to show how truly fearsome the situation is. There 
is a villain, of course, and there is an old eccentric (Scott Glenn) who 
proves to be the key to the rescue mission, despite having a hidden agenda 
of his own. It is clear that scriptwriters Robert King and Terry Hayes 
have lifted this one step-by-step from "Screenplays For Dummies" -- 
there's not a single plot point you won't see coming a mile away.
Even worse, King and Hayes demonstrate no flair whatsoever for dialogue. 
"Vertical Limit" is full of overwrought, scarcely believable passages. 
There is precisely one good line in the entire film -- Taylor's 
description of Scorupco -- and even that probably won't have as much 
meaning for audiences outside of Canada.
Campbell does at least take good advantage of the tremendous Asian 
landscape; "Vertical Limit" is breathtaking visually, if in no other 
respects. But this is scarcely enough to save the movie as a whole. By the 
time the first wave of snow comes thundering down the mountainside, I 
found myself wishing it would sweep me out of the theatre, too.

Title
Review for Girl, Interrupted (1999)
Directed by James Mangold. Screenplay by Mangold, Lisa Loomer and Anna 
Hamilton Phelan, based on the book by Susanna Kaysen. Starring Winona 
Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldberg. Running time: 147 minutes. Rated 
AA for mature subject matter and offensive language. Reviewed on February 
28th, 2000.
Shortly after her 1967 high school graduation, Susanna Kaysen (Winona 
Ryder) nearly kills herself with a cocktail of aspirin and vodka. "I had 
a headache," she explains after being committed to the Claymoore mental 
hospital. But Susanna's brush with death is really symptomatic of the 
sheer aimlessness of her life. She is the only member of her class not 
heading off for college. While much of the United States is swept up in 
the furor of the Vietnam War, Susanna seems almost oblivious. So it is 
hardly surprising that someone so lacking in direction could allow control 
of her life to be handed to the doctors and nurses at Claymoore. At 
least now, direction will be forced on her if nothing else.
"Girl, Interrupted" is based on true events, depicted in Kaysen's book of 
the same title. Kaysen lost a year and a half of her life in a women's 
mental ward, and the film recounts the experiences which inspired 
Susanna to retake control of her own destiny.
Despite a lack of real incident, the first half of the movie is 
riveting. We are introduced to some of the other girls in Susanna's 
ward, including a disfigured young pyrophile named Polly (Elizabeth 
Moss); Susanna's roommate Georgina (Clea DuVall), who seeks refuge in the 
"Oz" books of L Frank Baum; and Daisy (Brittany Murphy), a woman with 
peculiar dietary beliefs. These characters are portrayed evenhandedly; 
their mental problems are neither sugarcoated nor demonized, and they 
seem real. Watching over everything is Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg), a stern 
but caring nurse who understands in minutes what the psychiatrists 
themselves never really figure out: that Susanna has come to Claymoore 
not for help, but simply to be. "Do not drop anchor here," Valerie warns 
Susanna, knowing that the doctors are perfectly content to keep her 
locked up forever. Since there is nothing really wrong with Susanna, how 
can she ever be cured?
Everything is stirred up by the arrival of Lisa (Angelina Jolie), an 
aggressive young woman who is no stranger to Claymoore. Despite the fact 
that Lisa herself has no desire to remain hospitalized (when we first 
meet her, she has just been recaptured after a two week absence), it 
is her presence which is Susanna's most attractive reason for staying in 
the asylum. Lisa plays the leader of the ragtag band of patients, taking
them on secret midnight excursions through secret passages and into 
restricted areas of the hospital. For a time, Claymoore seems less like 
an insane asylum and more like summer camp. Of course, a mental ward is 
not summer camp, and eventually events conspire to remind Susanna of this
fact. It is this reality -- and how Susanna reacts to it -- which 
comprises the film's second, more uneven half.
Much of "Girl, Interrupted" is a careful character study. We are witness 
to how insanity affects everyone from the delusional themselves, to those 
charged with their care, to the average people who by some happenstance 
come into contact with them. The film also observes how madness can be a 
relative and elusive concept. Some of Claymoore's patients have no 
business being there (Susanna herself, for instance), while some are 
there purely because of social tenets which today seem increasingly 
outdated (one woman's only "problem" is that she is a lesbian). But, more 
darkly, not all of those released and declared sane truly are, and this 
sets up the movie's most disturbing sequence.
Unfortunately, after an hour of terrific characterization and  
well-chosen set pieces, "Girl, Interrupted"'s final twenty minutes are a 
huge step backward into melodrama. These scenes feel awkwardly grafted 
onto the rest of the film, as though scriptwriters James Mangold (who 
also directed), Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan were afraid 
audiences would not be satisfied with a straightforward character study. 
Instead, the movie ends with a lot of contrived angst and, yes, even a 
chase scene (albeit one that is nicely photographed by Mangold).
The cast is well chosen; while it would be very easy to play any of the 
Claymoore inmates over the top, all the actors stay grounded in reality, 
and this lends authenticity to the picture. Jolie is terrific in a role 
that has already earned her an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe award. 
Of all the characters, it is Lisa who could most easily have been taken 
too far, but Jolie knows her limits. It is clear that she is having a 
great deal of fun in the role; Jolie really gets her teeth into the part, 
portraying as much of Lisa's personality in her body language and the 
inflection of her voice as in her actual words and deeds. Ryder's 
performance, meanwhile, is understated but not bland, projecting Susanna's 
uncertainty and desperation while making it clear that she should never 
have been committed.
Denouement aside, "Girl, Interrupted" is an absorbing venture inside the 
walls of a mental institution. Both scripting and acting are up to the 
challenge of translating Kaysen's experiences convincingly onto the 
screen. Although it lacks the power and drama of "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest", to which it is perhaps most readily comparable, "Girl, 
Interrupted" should not be overlooked.

Review for Possible Worlds (2000)
Directed by Robert Lepage. Screenplay by Lepage and John Mighton. Starring
Tom McCamus, Tilda Swinton, Sean McCann. Running time: 93 minutes. Rated 
PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 28th, 2001.
Synopsis: Two police officers investigate the murder of George Barber 
(McCamus), whose brain has been stolen. Meanwhile, George apparently lives 
on in a number of "possible worlds", where George is the same man but 
others are vastly different, including his perpetual lover, Joyce 
(Swinton). What is the nature of George's possible worlds, and how do 
these relate to his apparent murder?
Review: "Possible Worlds" is an interesting but ultimately unsuccessful 
exploration of the concept of "parallel universes". Profound questions are 
raised, but are sadly tangled in a weak, unsatisfying story. As the only 
constant in each of the "worlds", George should be a strong focal 
character, an anchor for the audience. Unfortunately, he is a virtual 
spectre, gliding through the movie with little trace of personality. The 
same cannot be said of Joyce, in any of her incarnations, a role to which 
Swinton brings strength and evenness. But each Joyce is so prickly and 
abrasive that it is difficult to relate to her; consequently, the audience 
is left without anyone to care for. And while there is a wonderfully 
ethereal aura pervading "Possible Worlds", Lepage is unable to find a 
balance in this. The result is that the film frequently feels too slow, 
even boring. Attempts to spice things up by injecting comical scenes with 
the police officers are failures too, because the contrast is too jarring, 
and the humour feeble. And while it is understandable that Mighton leaves 
unanswered the questions he raises, it is less acceptable that entire plot 
points go unanswered -- what, for example, was the significance of a man 
found drowned in a room with no water? And this pales in comparison with 
the film's farcical ending, which is right out of a Hollywood B-movie.

Title
Review for Big Kahuna, The (1999)
Directed by John Swanbeck. Screenplay by Roger Rueff, based on his play
"Hospitality Suite". Starring Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, Peter
Facinelli. Running time: 91 minutes. Rated AA for offensive language by
the MFCB. Reviewed on August 2nd, 2000.
"The Big Kahuna" is a movie about religion and business. About what
happens when the two ideologies clash, and how they're really not all that
different in the end. It's about how there are some people who are so
caught up in their faith that they're blind to everything else, and how
there are a lot of us, the great unwashed masses, who are stuck in the
middle and just trying to muddle through. And it's about the nature of
God, the ultimate Big Kahuna.
The film takes place over the course of twenty-four hours at an industrial
lubricant convention. Representing Lodestar Industries are Larry Mann
(Kevin Spacey), Phil Cooper (Danny DeVito) and Bob Walker (Peter
Facinelli). Larry is an intense go-getter; Phil is a more laid-back
marketing veteran; and Bob, a devout Baptist, is a fresh-faced novice sent
along for appearances. Their job at the convention is to secure the 
account of Dick Fuller, a major player in the field referred to as the
"Big Kahuna".
The Big Kahuna has promised that he'll come by Lodestar's tiny hospitality
suite at some point during the evening. But he never shows up. Or, at
least, so it appears until Bob (relegated to mixing drinks) mentions a man
he chatted with most of the night. It turns out that this man was Dick
Fuller, wearing somebody else's nametag. Larry is aghast to discover that
he and Bob talked about not lubricants but instead Fuller's dogs, and God,
and life and death -- taboo subjects for a potential client. However, the
Big Kahuna has invited Bob to a private party that night. Larry and Phil
reluctantly send him off, their last chance to secure the important
contract.
"The Big Kahuna" was written by Roger Rueff from his play "Hospitality
Suite". That the movie is based on a theatrical script should come as
little surprise. The emphasis on dialogue is enormous. Apart from the
leads, there is only one other credited performer (Paul Dawson as a
bellboy). The camera rarely leaves the hospitality suite's main room. I
first encountered this type of moviemaking with "Glengarry Glen Ross"
(also co-starring Spacey). That film at least had the benefit of a larger
cast, and I cannot deny that "The Big Kahuna"'s tunnel-vision-like focus
on just the three performers and single set grew tiresome on occasion.
But only on occasion. For the most part, "The Big Kahuna" is a
brilliantly-written, beautifully-acted movie that draws the best out of
its talented cast. It is hard not to enjoy a movie in which the actors are
so obviously relishing their dialogue. Spacey in particular is magnetic --
watching his verbal sparring with DeVito and Facinelli is the oral
equivalent of an Evert/Navratilova tennis match. He brings great energy to
the role, and gets most of the picture's funniest lines. But he does not
treat Larry as a funnyman; Spacey brings a raw, naked truth to the 
character. At one point, Bob and Phil debate whether Larry is honest or
just blunt. "He's blunt and honest," says Phil, and he couldn't be more
right.
DeVito's is a complex role, the sort that surprises you in the end with
just how many layers were revealed. Phil is at a crossroads. At a time
when he is supposed to be settling in and looking forward to retirement in
the not-too-distant future, his life is in an upheaval (he's newly
divorced) and he's looking for direction. I know how difficult that is at
twenty-three; I can only imagine how frustrating and demoralising it must
be at fifty-two. DeVito turns in a sombre, realistic performance that is
intelligently conceived, conveying Phil's inner turmoil in little steps
rather than one big leap.
As the relative newcomer of the trio, Facinelli is challenged to compete
with his veteran co-stars, and does good work. In a way, Bob is the most
difficult role. He believes no more fervently in his religion than Larry
does in marketing, but whereas Larry preaches something most of us can
relate to (namely, business), Bob adheres to something more idealistic,
and hence potentially more ludicrous. Facinelli does an able job of giving
Bob his own strength without seeming too coy or wishy-washy.
And this is important, because it is Facinelli's ability to face off with
Spacey that gives "The Big Kahuna" its impetus and its balance. Both Larry
and Bob are representatives -- priests, in a sense -- of their respective
religions. Bob cannot conceive of a conversation in which God is set
aside. We get the impression that Larry feels the same way about
lubricants, at least for the duration of the convention. They are both
seeking, in their own way, the Big Kahuna. For Larry, of course, this is
Dick Fuller. Nothing is more important than meeting him, courting him,
getting on his side. Bob's "Big Kahuna" is God, but Bob's intentions
toward Him are hardly any different, except that they are spiritual
rather than material. Larry and Bob are opponents in a literal sense, but
they are really preaching the same mindset.
It is Phil, then, who provides the pivotal counterpoint in the movie. He
is ambivalent and uncertain about both God and lubricants. He represents
the average person, who is not so firm in their convictions, and is 
unwilling to give himself over entirely to his faith (be it religion
or lubricants or anything else).
But perhaps "The Big Kahuna"'s most thoughtful observations are reserved
for the title character(s). Fuller is only barely glimpsed throughout the
movie; instead, he is revealed to us through reverential musings. But
Fuller is human, and we discover this only through the one character who
does not worship him. With Bob, Fuller is able to open up, and talk about
something other than lubricants. The implication -- symbolised beautifully
in a dream Phil relates to Larry -- is that maybe God, Bob's Big Kahuna,
is no different. He's just never had anyone to sit down with Him, have a
drink, and chat.

Review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)
HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (2000) / ***
Directed by Ron Howard. Screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S Seaman,
based on the book by Dr. Seuss. Starring Jim Carrey, Taylor Momsen,
Jeffrey Tambor. Running time: 105 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed 
on December 16th, 2000.
I have mixed feelings about the new big-screen version of Dr Seuss' "How 
The Grinch Stole Christmas". Don't get me wrong -- it's a very funny, very 
entertaining movie, and kids and adults alike should enjoy it. No, my 
problem (such as it is) is that, if I had to associated one name with the 
film, it would not be Dr Seuss'. Undeniably, that name would be Jim 
Carrey's.
More so than any of his previous pictures, Carrey owns "The Grinch". All 
its wit, drama, energy is derived from him. When Carrey isn't on-screen, 
the movie loses much of its appeal; it feels like a symphony missing its 
brass and string sections, both at once. And this is a problem only 
inasmuch as it makes a liar out of the film's advertising: this is not Dr 
Seuss' "How The Grinch Stole Christmas", but rather the same story 
filtered through Carrey's singular sense of humour.
Carrey, of course, plays the Grinch -- a green, hairy creature who lives 
atop fang-like Mount Crumpit, in a home littered with the garbage of the 
Whos. The Whos live in Whoville, at the base of the mountain, and they are 
as unlike the Grinch as it is possible to be. Where the Grinch is mean and 
scornful, the Whos are happy and carefree. And no time is more full of 
jollity in Whoville than Christmastime. Christmas is part of every apsect 
of the Whos' lives. They decorate for it, sing songs about it, and most
importantly, they shop for it. Every Who loves Christmas.
Every Who, that is, except little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), who has 
begun to question just why all the presents and ornaments and parades are 
supposed to make her happy. When none of the other Whos understand her 
concerns, Cindy Lou seeks out the one person she thinks might feel the 
same way: the Grinch. But in doing so, Cindy Lou reawakens old memories in 
the Grinch, of childhood rejection by town beauty Martha May Whovier 
(Christine Baranski) and humiliation by Mayor May Who (Jeffrey Tambor). 
This inspires the Grinch's infamous plot to steal Christmas from Whoville.
If there's one element of the story that director Ron Howard managed to 
keep true to Dr Seuss' vision, it is its actual appearance. Dr Seuss books 
are famous for their slightly off-kilter visual style, and Howard and 
production designer Michael Corenblith have not departed too much from 
"The Grinch"'s Seussian origins. The Whos look like regular humans, just a 
little warped (they have strange hairstyles, big noses, and rosy cheeks). 
Whoville is not dissimilar from a regular town -- if that town's chief 
architect had been Rube Goldberg. Everything is a riot of colour and 
activity and Christmas.
Also well conceived is Carrey's Grinch costume. Not only does this hew 
very closely to the Dr Seuss original, it also permits Carrey an almost 
full range of movement and facial expressions. And, given the animation 
the actor puts into his role, this is of key importance. Had the decision 
been made simply to slap Carrey in a mask, for example, "The Grinch" would 
not be nearly so successful.
The Grinch may be for Jim Carrey what the Genie in "Aladdin" was for Robin 
Williams: the ultimate expression of the actor's comic strengths. Carrey 
has it all here -- a character who is at once caustic and sympathetic, who 
is unbridled in what antics he can indulge himself in. Carrey's humour 
ranges from the obvious to the sublime (when a Whoville taxi won't stop to 
pick him up, he facetiously wails, "It's because I'm GREEN, isn't it?"). 
Only occasionally does he resort to sophomoric gross-out comedy. There
are hints of several past Carrey characters in the Grinch -- definite 
helpings of Ace Ventura, for example, and the Hank persona from "Me, 
Myself & Irene" -- leading one to believe that this is the role Carrey's 
comedic career has been building up to.
Unfortunately, though, none of the other performers can hope to match up. 
Tambor in particular tries gamely, but his Mayor lacks much depth. As for 
Momsen, she does passably well in the film's second-most important role, 
but fails to make as strong an impression as she should. Cindy Lou is made 
out to be intelligent and individualistic, but Howard seems far too 
interested in just playing up her cuteness. Anthony Hopkins, meanwhile, 
makes a good successor to Boris Karloff as the Narrator. His precise, 
sonorous tones sweep the audience instantly into the tale.
The Dr Seuss book has, of course, been greatly expanded in order to turn 
it into a feature-length film. Amongst the more notable additions made by 
screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S Seaman are a series of flashbacks 
to the Grinch's own youth, providing motivation for the character's nasty 
ways. Intriguingly, this somewhat subverts the original Seuss story, 
moving it away from its obvious Dickensian roots. Instead of simply 
telling the tale of a mean man who discovers joy in the spirit of 
Christmas, "The Grinch" is now more about accepting people's differences 
(although the original moral has not been totally dismissed, either). 
Combined with its staunchly anti-commercial streak, the film feels both 
more relevant and more substantial as a result.
Although some have suggested that "The Grinch" is too dark and 
mean-spirited for children, I don't believe this is really the case. 
Parents of very sensitive children may find the film inappropriate, but in 
general, it is suitable for the entire family, with plenty to offer young 
and old. Those who are approaching the movie expecting it to simply be the 
book (or 1960s TV version) writ large may be caught off-guard by the 
pervasiveness of Carrey's influence. But Carrey fans, and Seuss 
afficiandos prepared to accept a mild departure from the source material,
should find "The Grinch" to be a hugely entertaining Christmas movie.
So go see "The Grinch", and just you wait and see:
Yes, even your heart might grow a size, or two, or three.

Title
Review for Wonder Boys (2000)
Directed by Curtis Hanson. Screenplay by Steve Kloves, based on the novel
by Michael Chabon. Starring Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Robert Downey
Jr. Running time: 114 minutes. Rated AA. Reviewed on March 19th, 2000.
A quiet, understated character piece, "Wonder Boys" is the sort of movie 
which, when recalled afterward, seems more like a dream than something 
actually experienced. Slow-moving but never plodding, funny and original 
without being absurd, it is a pleasurable journey through one man's 
personal struggles.
Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a University of Pittsburgh English 
professor who wrote a critically-acclaimed novel seven years ago and 
hasn't published anything since. Most people think Tripp is washed up, 
but the truth is that his new novel just isn't finished yet; it is now two 
thousand single-spaced pages long and counting. Tripp, whose wife has 
just left him, is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara 
Gaskell (Frances McDormand). Sara's husband Walter (Richard Thomas) is 
the head of the English department and hence Grady's boss. Tripp's most 
promising student is James Leer (Tobey Maguire), a dour and eccentric 
youth held in disdain by most of his classmates. The lone exception is 
Hannah Green (Katie Holmes), who is also boarding with Grady and is 
clearly interested in taking their relationship beyond the academic.
The movie takes place during WordFest, a weekend-long writers' convention. 
The Gaskells host a party to kick off WordFest, during which Sara reveals 
to Grady that she is pregnant. Going outside for a draw, Tripp 
(aptly named, given that he spends most of the movie under the 
influence of drugs, both prescription and otherwise) encounters James, 
standing in the backyard with a gun he insists is just a fake. The two 
sneak upstairs to have a look at Walter's collection of memorabilia. 
When Grady is attacked by the Gaskells' dog, James shoots it dead. At a 
loss, Tripp ends up lugging the canine corpse around in his trunk until 
he can figure out what to do about it.
All this is just set-up for a sometimes harrowing, always amusing odyssey 
through the streets of Pittsburgh and the problems which plague Grady's 
life. He finds himself having to deal not just with the end of his 
marriage and the complication of his affair, not just with the dead dog 
and a stolen piece of Walter's collection, not just with editor Terry 
Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr) whose own job is riding on the publication of 
Tripp's new novel, but with the enigma that is James Leer. James isn't 
just a writer; the entirety of his behavior is one big creative process 
(at one point, intoxicated, he begins narrating out loud) and it is 
impossible to take anything he says or does at face value: the 
fake-gun-that-isn't is just the tip of the iceberg of James' fantasies 
and deceptions.
"Wonder Boys" is a smart movie that understands its characters and takes 
the time to develop and explore them fully. Written by Steve Kloves from 
the novel by Michael Chabon, it is populated by believable individuals who 
make believable choices, not ones dictated by stereotypical Hollywood 
expectations. For example, both Terry and James are clearly not strictly 
heterosexual, but when they finally do end up in bed together, it is 
dealt with almost offhandedly. The event is just a natural development of 
both characters, and the script does not grind to a halt to exploit it. 
Nothing in "Wonder Boys" feels staged or melodramatic; realism seethes 
from its characters, their relationships with each other, and the 
decisions they make.
But perhaps this is all to be expected. "Wonder Boys" is a movie all 
about making choices and the consequences of avoiding them, and a film 
with such a theme lives and dies on the conviction of its characters. Grady 
has spent the past half-decade evading decisions, and it has cost him his 
marriage. Here, then, is the story of how he comes to rise above his 
personal apathy and seize control of his life. Nowhere is this theme of 
making choices more clearly illustrated than with Grady's epic novel. Even 
Hannah, Grady's potential new love interest, finds it impossible to 
finish, but not because it is poorly written. On the other hand, Hannah 
thinks it is beautiful, but she tells Grady, "you didn't make any 
choices": Grady has not found the will to leave anything out of the text, 
and as a result it has ballooned to mammoth proportions. The manuscript's 
final fate depicts another important fact about decisions: that sometimes 
they're made for you, not by you.
The movie's dialogue is sparkling throughout, and there are plenty of 
laughs, many of them derived from the film's frank view of reality. 
Surprisingly for a movie which muses on so deep a theme, "Wonder Boys" 
has many of the elements of a screwball comedy, complete with mistaken 
identities and misplaced valuables. But the screwball elements are always 
in service to the overall plot, complementing it rather than fragmenting 
the film. As a result, "Wonder Boys" is appealing and enjoyable on a 
number of different levels.
The acting is uniformly excellent. Douglas finds just the right note as 
the harried Grady, portraying him as confused and aimless without making 
him seem weak. Maguire, always a quiet, reserved actor, is a perfect fit 
as James -- he is quirky, inspired and fragile, all at the same time. 
Amongst the supporting cast, Richard Knox gives a hilarious performance 
as a man who claims to be the real owner of Grady's battered car.
For a movie about choices, "Wonder Boys" makes all the right ones. It is 
smart and well-acted, and the top-notch script finds a good balance between 
drama and comedy. Although its sheer placidness may work against it in such 
a crowded box office, it should not be overlooked. This may be one of the 
first Oscar contenders of the year 2000.

Review for Insider, The (1999)
Directed by Michael Mann. Screenplay by Eric Roth and Mann, from the 
article "The Man Who Knew Too Much" by Marie Brenner. Starring Al Pacino, 
Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer. Running time: 188 minutes. Rated AA 
for offensive language. Reviewed on March 5th, 2000.
There are days when I'm flabbergasted by the power of big business. They 
have the power, the money, and the influence to seemingly do whatever 
they want. Governments kowtow to them, common man is overwhelmed by them. 
When a corporation can throw hundreds of thousands of dollars into a 
legal campaign, or use media connections to denigrate their opponents, 
how can Joe Average compete?
"The Insider" is the story of just such a battle, based on real events 
from the mid-Nineties. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), newly fired from 
his job as a research and development executive with tobacco giant Brown 
& Williamson, is asked by "60 Minutes" producer Lowell Bergman (Al 
Pacino) to assist him on a story related to the cigarette industry. 
Bergman soon realizes that Wigand's knowledge of evidence damaging to Big 
Tobacco extends well beyond the scope of his current story. He attempts 
to persuade Wigand to come forward with what he knows for a "60 Minutes" 
segment with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer).
This in of itself would make for a remarkable film. Wigand's inner 
conflict -- should he talk or shouldn't he? -- is poignant and involving. 
Not only does Wigand have to deal with the legal ramifications of going 
on "60 Minutes" (he has signed a confidentiality agreement with Brown & 
Williamson) but he soon finds his old bosses applying more dubious means 
of persuasion -- he is followed and sent threatening messages.
Or is he? In real life, none of Wigand's accusations about Brown & 
Williamson's tactics were substantiated. "The Insider" leans toward 
Wigand's side of the story, but leaves the question open. Is the man at 
the golf course spying on Wigand, or just watching him because Wigand is 
himself behaving oddly? Was a bullet left in his mailbox as a warning, or 
did Wigand put it there himself? Even Wigand's then-wife Leane (Diane 
Venora) has since accused him of the latter.
Making Wigand's conflict even more engrossing is the fact that he is 
married with children. Were he single, going on "60 Minutes" would be a 
noble and selfless act. But his entire family appears to be at risk (from 
economic hardship caused by the termination of Wigand's severance pay, if 
not from the tobacco giants themselves). Can he put the interests of the 
nation above his marriage? In many ways, Wigand is a tragic character -- 
no matter what he decides, people will be hurt, himself included. The 
ways in which he copes with this fact comprise some of "The Insider"'s 
quietest but most touching moments.
The engaging first act segues neatly into the second, where Pacino's 
character takes center stage. With the Wigand "60 Minutes" segment in the 
can, everything looks set until CBS's legal department intervenes. Lawyer 
Helen Caperelli (Gina Gershon) believes that because Bergman encouraged 
Wigand to break his confidentiality agreement, CBS could be liable for 
billions of dollars. To Bergman's horror, both Wallace and CBS News  
chief Don Hewitt (Philip Baker Hall) agree to edit the segment to remove
Wigand's interview, despite the supposed autonomy of the news division 
within the CBS hierarchy. To make matters worse, Big Tobacco begins a 
smear campaign against Wigand which, if successful, will destroy his 
credibility, making his interview worthless even if CBS does eventually 
acquiesce.
Although not as compelling as Wigand's personal journey, Bergman's 
efforts to fight both CBS management and the anti-Wigand publicity are 
exciting and provide a dynamic counterpoint to the film's emotional and 
ethical struggles. It is in these scenes that "The Insider" plays most 
loosely with the facts, building up Bergman as the hero of the debacle. 
This is to the detriment of people like Wallace and Hewitt, who come 
across more like corporate lackeys. Many of the feats the movie 
attributes to Bergman are exaggerations or wholesale fabrications -- 
feeding "The Wall Street Journal" information to disprove Big Tobacco's 
smear campaign, for example. (In reality, Bergman had nothing to do with 
the "Journal's" Pulitzer Prize-winning article.)
But I find it difficult to criticize "The Insider" on this basis. This is 
a drama, after all, not a documentary, and without a central hero in 
Bergman, the film would probably be weaker. It is also important to point 
out that both Hall and Plummer maintain their characters' core integrity 
throughout. Plummer has an especially powerful scene after a newspaper 
editorial accuses "60 Minutes" of dishonoring "the legacy of Edward R 
Murrow".
Both Crowe (in an Oscar-nominated performance) and Pacino are terrific 
throughout "The Insider". They find just the right note of realism in 
their characters, not playing them as overtly heroic but sustaining our 
interest nonetheless. Without this, scenes like the one where Wigand, on 
the slippery slope toward a nervous breakdown, hallucinates about his 
daughters would come across as farcical, not enthralling. Both Bergman 
and, in particular, Wigand are ordinary people thrust into extraordinary 
circumstances, and "The Insider" does well not to forget that.
Also excellent is Michael Mann's direction, which keeps up the pace while 
recalling that, at its heart, this is a very human story. There is a 
scene toward the beginning where Wigand and Bergman converse in the 
cramped interior of Wigand's car. It is raining, and they are parked near 
a lake, the car sinking slowly into the mud. It is little more than a 
static dialogue scene, but the setting conveys a sense of claustrophobia 
and isolation which makes it clear that there is already no way out for 
Wigand. He has to make his choice and bear the consequences, and he 
can escape neither.
In the end, "The Insider" shows that it is possible to beat big business, 
if one is willing to endure the inherent risks, and has a little help 
from friends in high places of their own. But we do not live in a black 
and white world, and no matter how noble the cause, such a struggle will 
have undesirable consequences for everyone it touches. The real question 
is whether the people involved will be transformed by these consequences, 
or destroyed.

Title
Review for Cell, The (2000)
Directed by Tarsem. Screenplay by Mark Protosevich. Starring Jennifer
Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio, Vince Vaughn. Running time: 107 minutes. Rated
AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 22nd, 2000.
Whatever the medium, surrealism is a difficult technique to pull off.
Often, it comes across either as overly complicated, an indulgment in
weirdness at the expense of a logical storyline, or as too mundane, taking
perfectly evident plot points and tarting them up needlessly. The first
type usually leaves its audience hopelessly confused (or, at best,
requiring multiple screenings) while the second frequently just makes one
wonder what all the fuss was about.
Although it makes a valiant effort, "The Cell" falls into this latter
category. The film, by first-time director Tarsem Singh (pretentiously
going only by his given name), tries to put a novel spin on the "bizarre
serial killer" concept popularised by films like "Silence Of The Lambs"
and "Se7en". Whereas those movies merely speculated about how the minds of
their antagonists worked, "The Cell" literally takes us inside its
villain's head. But while the visuals accompanying these scenes are
stunning, the sequences are too elementary in their conception, lacking
the shrewd symbolism which is the hallmark of great surrealism.
"The Cell" opens on a vast desert landscape, through which a woman in a
feathery white dress, Catharine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), is riding on a
black horse. We soon learn that all this is taking place inside the mind
of a young coma patient. Catharine, a child psychologist, has had her
consciousness inserted into the boy's mind using revolutionary new
technology, and is trying, so far without success, to coax him into
awakening.
Meanwhile, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) tracks down a serial
killer named Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio). Stargher has murdered
several women by trapping them in a sealed container which automatically
fills with water after forty hours. He then bleaches their flesh to make
them look like dolls before dumping their bodies. Just before his arrest,
Stargher experiences a massive seizure, plunging him into a coma from
which he will likely never emerge. Unfortunately, he has recently
kidnapped a woman, and has left no clues as to where she is being kept.
With less than two days to rescue her before she drowns in Stargher's
contraption, Novak turns to Catharine Deane, who reluctantly agrees to go
inside Carl's subconscious.
It is these scenes, set inside the mind of the killer, that form "The
Cell"'s centerpiece, giving Tarsem a tremendous opportunity to strut his
stuff. Having cut his teeth on such visually memorable music videos as
REM's "Losing My Religion", Tarsem brings a number of striking touches to
"The Cell". Consider, for example, a disturbing scene in which Catharine
walks through a gallery of Stargher's previous victims, all in various
stages of becoming doll-like and mechanically acting out vaguely obscene
movements. Also very impressive is Stargher's representation of his evil
side, a demonic-looking figure brilliantly realised by costume designers
Eiko Ishioka and April Napier. Tarsem does a fine job of filming
D'Onofrio in these scenes in a manner that gives him a sensation of
absolute enormity.
But one of the joys of surrealistic works is in deducing the meaning
behind the symbols. But Tarsem does not make much use of symbolism in "The
Cell". Though he does paint an eccentric and original mental terrain,
Tarsem mainly depicts Stargher's mindscape as simply a collage of moments
from his past. This makes the whole thing at times feel like nothing more
than a heavy-handed way to insert flashbacks into the narrative. Most
things in Carl's subconscious are exactly what they seem to be, and while
there is enough of the bizarre and the fantastic to impress the eye, I
found myself left with a slight feeling of hollowness.
Indeed, I was sometimes more intrigued by the boy Catharine is treating
than I was by the Stargher storyline itself. Here we do get flashes of the
sort of clever associations I was anticipating (inside his mind, the boy
lives in fear of a creature Catharine later reveals is derived from Mother
Goose), and it is unfortunate that these sequences were used only as
bookends for the main action. They had the potential to form the
cornerstone of a very intriguing movie in their own right.
The two main protagonists, Lopez and Vaughn, give passable performances.
Lopez's Catharine seems rather weak and half-formed throughout. This may
have been intentional, to contrast the character with the way she behaves
after falling under Stargher's thrall, but these sequences are too brief
to support the decision. Vaughn, meanwhile, plays Peter with little
variation on the standard FBI stereotype. Intriguing hints that he may
have gone through much the same childhood experiences as Stargher are
left disappointingly underdeveloped.
D'Onofrio, on the other hand, ably handles the variety of material he is
given, playing everything from a simpering child-man to an imposing beast.
The biggest problem is that Stargher just is not a particularly memorable
villain. Although scriptwriter Mark Protosevich gives him some interesting
characteristics (he has hooks embedded in his back so that he can hover
from ropes over his victims, for example), these just seem like so much
window dressing. Stargher's own personality is pushed to the background
for much of the film.
"The Cell" also goes a little overboard in trying to make Stargher seem
like less of a monster, passing the blame on to his abusive father.
Although this does provide some insight into Carl's motivations, it also
feels like something of a cop-out. And surely, if we are expected to
excuse (or, at least, understand) Stargher's behaviour on this basis, then
mightn't his father be worthy of the same consideration? Isn't it a little
too pat to just set him up as the ultimate villain?
It is unfortunate that "The Cell" does not tackle such issues, nor take
better advantage of its great premise. Instead, it ends up as essentially
just another serial killer movie. It can be recommended on the basis of
its visuals and sheer entertainment value, but it falls short of being a
great movie, unfortunately settling for just being pretty good.

Title
Review for Shaft (2000)
Directed by John Singleton. Screenplay by Richard Price, from a story by
Singleton, Shane Salerno and Price, based on the novel Ernest Tidyman.
Starring Samuel L Jackson, Christian Bale, Jeffrey Wright. Running time: 
98 minutes. Rated AA for offensive language and violent scenes by the 
MFCB. Reviewed on June 18th, 2000.
As I compose this review, I find myself resisting the temptation to write 
the whole thing in early-Seventies urban slang. Fortunately, I think I 
can last just long enough to grind out another nine-hundred-odd words. 
Can ya dig it?
The stimulus behind this bizarre compulsion, of course, is the new action 
movie "Shaft". I've not yet seen the original version, nor indeed any of 
the so-called "blaxploitation" genre which blossomed in the Seventies, so 
as I watched the updated edition I had little basis for comparison. 
However, if the first "Shaft" is as enjoyable as this one, it will be a 
rental to look forward to. The new "Shaft" is a good example of a summer 
movie done right.
John Shaft (Samuel L Jackson) is a cop "too black for the uniform and too 
blue for the brothers". He's an uneasy fit in the police department, 
straining at the rules and regulations which govern his actions, and 
sorely tempted by the offer of his uncle John (Richard Roundtree, 
reprising his role from the original "Shaft" trilogy in a handful of 
entertaining cameos, still oozing cool) to join his private detective 
agency.
One night, Shaft is called to an upper-class club where a black man has 
been brutally clubbed to death. Shaft soon identifies the killer as 
Walter Wade Jr (Christian Bale), heir to a real estate empire. But a 
judge lets Wade off with a bail amount insignificant in comparison to 
either his bank account or the severity of his crime, and soon Wade has 
fled to Switzerland.
Fast forward two years, and Shaft is tipped off to Wade's return to the 
United States. But he is again allowed to post bail, causing a fed-up 
Shaft to quit the force in disgust, vowing to get Wade his own way. Shaft 
sets to work tracking down Diane Palmieri ("The Sixth Sense"'s Toni 
Collette), the only eye witness to the murder, who has since vanished 
without a trace. But Wade is also trying to find Diane, and has hired 
another of Shaft's nemeses, drug lord Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright), 
to silence her.
This year's first big summer action flicks -- "Mission: Impossible 2" and 
"Gone In 60 Seconds" -- were both let down primarily by poor 
scriptwriting. "Shaft" bucks the trend: the screenplay by Richard Price 
is one of the film's biggest assets. The story is solid, engaging, and 
frequently funny, and the characterisation is mostly top notch. The 
action sequences are watchable if not really inventive, and enough twists 
and turns are thrown into the mix to keep interest high.
Samuel L Jackson is in fine form as the title character, bringing 
together an unusual mix of intensity and humor, not to mention Shaft's 
trademark suave. He looks very impressive in a wardrobe consisting mostly 
of long dark coats, with a bald head and a fearsome goatee. He seems to 
shift from "approachable" to "indomitable" with but a glance. Jackson's 
Shaft is in some ways reminiscent of his "Pulp Fiction" character, with 
the same edgy humor and penchant for violence. Whereas Roundtree's Shaft
was known as much for his promiscuity as his crime-solving skills, this
version is far more single-minded in his search for Diane.
"Shaft" boasts not one but two stellar bad guys in Wade and Hernandez, 
both very well-cast. Bale could easily have made Wade a continuation of 
his starring role in "American Psycho", but plays this character as a 
more grounded sort of villain, the kind that's evil not because he's 
mentally ill but just because he can afford to be. Wade doesn't so much 
kill because he enjoys it, but because he sees his victim as something 
far less than himself.
Wright, meanwhile, portrays Peoples as an almost fey character, but with 
a dangerous volatility all the same. Particularly pleasing is that both 
Wade and Hernandez are given their own distinctive, rounded personalities 
and individual raisons d'etre. "Shaft" avoids the trap of, say, the last 
two "Batman" movies where one headlining villain stole the spotlight and 
the other was relegated to grunt status. Some of the best sequences in 
the entire movie come when Bale and Wright are interacting.
Also notable is rapper Busta Rhymes, who does an impressive comic turn as 
Shaft's reluctant pseudo-sidekick, Rasaan. Further, the movie takes a 
very unexpected risk with the character Luger, a bigoted police officer. 
I thought Luger was being built up as the prototypical racist cop, but 
was delighted when the movie totally subverted my assumptions. Luger is 
not made out to be a nice or admirable character, of course, but I found 
it interesting that Price chose to acknowledge a few shades of grey in 
the midst of the usual racists-bad black-and-white palette. Lee Tergesen 
manages to find just the right balance in the role.
Indeed, there are few stereotypes to be found in "Shaft". The only
notable exception to this is Jack Rosselli, a cop on Peoples' payroll.
Played by Dan Hedaya, Rosselli is a strong echo of Hedaya's "The
Hurricane" character. But even here expectations are twisted, as
Rosselli's partner in corruption is black. Indeed, "Shaft" is not about
black guys kicking white guys' butts, but an action flick which handles
issues of race more competently than is often the case. Shaft is black,
yes, and the film does not trivialise or dismiss the fact. But there is
more to the character; his race is part of what makes up John Shaft, not
the only thing.
Which is not suggest, of course, that this is a movie bogged down in the 
politics of race relations. "Shaft" is foremost a popcorn movie, and does 
not dwell too much upon such notions. But that such observations can be 
drawn at all is indicative of the fact that "Shaft" is not just an action 
movie, but an action movie with a brain. It might not be overly 
ambitious, but it's definitely good entertainment. Damn right.

Title
Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Screenplay by Susannah Grant and Richard
Lagravenese. Starring Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart.
Running time: 129 minutes. Rated AA for offensive language. Reviewed on
March 29th, 2000.
It's said that everyone loves an underdog. In that case, the box office 
success of new Julia Roberts vehicle "Erin Brockovich" is all but assured,
for here is a movie all about celebrating the underdog. Not only is its
heroine essentially an everywoman with the same problems and worries that
confront the rest of us, but the villain of the piece is big business, a
favorite target of the common man. The fact that the movie is based on
real life events is merely the icing on the proverbial cake.
The story begins around 1992, when Erin Brockovich (Roberts), a 
twice-divorced mother of three, manages to gain employment at a legal 
firm run by Ed Masry (Albert Finney). Brockovich has no prior legal
experience and Masry initially balks at the proposition, but Brockovich
finally convinces him to hire her on a trial basis ("Don't make me beg,"
she quietly pleads with him in front of the entire office). Setting to
work as a legal secretary, Brockovich comes across some real estate files
which, to her consternation, include medical records. Gaining no insight
from her reluctant coworkers as to why this might be the case, Brockovich
visits the home of Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) to learn more.
The Jensens live in Hinkley, a small California town built around a
refinery run by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E). The family has been
plagued by medical problems, and Brockovich soon discovers that the cause
may be hexavalent chromium, a pollutant which has leaked from the PG&E
plant into the groundwater and has been contaminating the community for
the past thirty years. Soon it becomes clear that the health of not just
the Jensens, but indeed most of Hinkley's current and past residents, has
been damaged by PG&E's neglect and outright lies (the company actually
claimed at one point that the chromium in the environment was a type
beneficial to humans). Brockovich manages to convince Masry to take
on the Hinkley case, but must overcome people's perceptions of her own
shortcomings as the lawsuit proceeds forward.
As the title implies, this is a movie not so much about the legal battle
against PG&E as it is about Erin Brockovich herself. As such, it lives and
dies on the performance of Julia Roberts. Fortunately Roberts is up to the
challenge, demonstrating a facility for both the dramatic and comedic
elements of the role. This is not the sort of character one would
necessarily expect Roberts to take on, but it is not hard to see its
appeal. Brockovich is tenacious, brassy and self-confident, an extrovert
willing to speak her mind almost to the point of recklessness. Her life
has not been an easy one -- "I got pregnant too young" she admits at one
point, although there is no question that the overriding passion of her
life is her children -- but she is doing the best she can.
No doubt the aspect of the character which has received the most attention
has been Brockovich's provocative style of dress, but Roberts manages to
pull it off. Rather than making her looking slutty, the clothes help to
accentuate the idea that this is a woman who has her own way of getting
things done, who refuses to be cowed by the expectations of others.
But "Erin Brockovich" is so focussed on the title character that the rest
of the cast largely goes by the wayside. Finney does a respectable job as
Ed Masry, but lives out the movie in Roberts' orbit. Masry's entire
personality seems to be defined in terms of how he reacts to Brockovich,
and consequently he has no capacity to develop on his own. The other major
supporting actor is Aaron Eckhart, playing Brockovich's Harley-loving
next-door neighbor and romantic interest, George. It is here that the film
is at its weakest: their relationship is unconvincing from start to
finish, and the flimsy George is never given much characterization. He
seems to exist purely to either facilitate or complicate Brockovich's
life, and his disappearance from much of the last third of the movie is
all too easily overlooked.
"Erin Brockovich" does a decent job of portraying the real-life legal
struggles against PG&E. It is smart enough to balance the courtroom
dramatics with the more human elements of the case, such as the impact of
the medical problems on the Hinkley families, and the way Brockovich's
involvement affects her relationship with her children. It is peppered
with laughs, but avoids going over the edge into parody. However, the film
struggles to generate any real sense of incident. The lawyers representing
PG&E all come across as hamfisted and ineffectual, and there is never
much of a feeling of risk that things might not work out. Scenes such as
one where Masry discusses the possible bankruptcy of the law firm, and a
court proceeding where a judge could have dismissed the entire suit, are
quickly defused and feel tokenistic.
The movie is also plagued by moments of bizarre characterization. Much is 
made, for example, of Brockovich's love for her kids. And yet, when she
receives an anonymous phone call warning her to stop digging into the 
problems at Hinkley, almost nothing is made of it. This is not to say  
that her decision to proceed with the investigation indicates she doesn't
care about her children; on the contrary, it demonstrates how passionate
Brockovich is about both. But it seems inconceivable to me that she should
treat the incident so offhandedly, dismiss it so easily. This is only
exacerbated by the fact that the threat is never referred to again. What,
then, was the point?
"Erin Brockovich" is a good movie and a good vehicle for Julia Roberts.
But it sets the bar too low, settling for being just another popcorn movie
instead of striving for deeper characterization or a more compelling
screenplay. For a movie about a woman possessed of such determination and
conviction, it is unfortunate that "Erin Brockovich" does not possess
quite the same qualities.

the word "subscribe" in the subject line.
Shifting modes abruptly near the halfway point, "Jeepers Creepers" is
really two movies. The first is a full-fledged creep-out, with a shadowy
killer and his would-be victims placed in disturbingly intimate
circumstances. The second is an old-fashioned monster movie, showcasing
a brazen creature willing to go anywhere, including a packed police
station, to satisfy its vile needs.
What connects the two is Darryl (Justin Long) and his sister Trish (Gina
Philips), a pair of likable college kids who are dumb. Very dumb.
Extraordinarily dumb. I-believe-Miss-Cleo-is-on-the-level dumb. George
W. dumb.
"Jeepers Creepers" opens on a sunny day, as Darryl and Trish tool down a
long, empty highway in the country on their way home to visit the folks.
Their squabbling is interrupted when a weathered pickup truck nearly
runs them off the road. Minutes later, while they are still catching
their breaths, they spot the truck parked by an old church. The driver,
anonymous in a wide hat and long coat, totes what appear to be two
bodies wrapped in bloody sheets across the ground and dumps then down a
drainage pipe. Then, with his face in shadow from the brim of his hat,
he stands straight and looks directly towards Darryl and Trish.
The terrified siblings tear down the road, only to see that wretched
truck in the rear view mirror moments later. Like a scene out of a
nightmare (or Steven Spielberg's "Duel"), the truck rams them repeatedly
and the two barely survive the assault. When the truck finally moves on
into the distance, the kids sit, gasping and shaking over their brush
with death. And then Darryl turns to his sister, looks her deep in the
eyes and say, "We've got to go back."
"We've got to go back," he says. Trish stares at him as if he'd
suggested they go swimming in the ocean wearing chum-scented sunblock.
"We've got to go back," he implores. "What if they're still alive? What
if it was you back there?" Trish, showing a welcome glimmer of survival
skills, suggests they call the police, but the batteries in their
cellphone are dead and "who knows how far we'll have to drive before we
find a pay phone."
At this point, I fought the urge to scream, "What about the farmhouses
you pass every 30 seconds? Unless you're driving through Amish country,
they probably have phones! What the fuck is wrong with you people?"
While my head throbs, Darryl and Trish drive back to the church. Darryl
leans in over the drainpipe, while Trish notes aloud that they are
following the classic pattern of idiot teenagers in slasher movies. Then
Darryl faintly hears a voice cry "Help!" and climbs into the pipe. What
a guy. If he had been in "Jaws" when the shark began swallowing Robert
Shaw, he probably would have dove in after him.
Now I realize that movies like this must place vulnerable people in
godawful dangerous circumstances, but would it kill the screenwriters to
at least make a passing attempt to paint the heroes as something more
than imbeciles? For example, how about this scenario: Darryl and Trish
spot the figure lowering the bodies into the drainpipe. He sees them and
heads for his truck. They attempt to speed away but they run out of gas
and their engine dies. Frantically, they pull the car off the road into
a field and hide behind the tall cornstalks. The pickup truck backs out,
fails to see them and goes racing down the highway. Knowing they have
but a few minutes, one of them looks around the church grounds for a
source of gas, while the other checks out the pipe for signs of life.
Sure, my proposal is overly reliant on luck and good timing, but
compared to what is presented onscreen, it is pure genius.
Regardless of the amber waves of stupidity, the first portion of
"Jeepers Creepers" is still scary as hell. TV veterans Long ("Ed") and
Philips ("Boston Public") are credible as brother and sister, and the
opening sequence lasts long enough to allow us to bond with the pair.
Writer-director Victor Salva ("Powder") effectively taps into our primal
fears about strange goings-on in rural areas, aided by Don FauntLeRoy's
skewed camerawork and Bennett Salvay's jarring score.
There is little I can reveal about the latter portion of the film
without spoiling things. Suffice to say that it becomes a much more
traditional monster movie, with a number of people trying to fend off a
bizarre creature (Jonathan Breck) that knows exactly what it wants and
isn't the least bit hesitant in getting those items. While a needless
scene with a whacked-out cat lady (Eileen Brennan) and the presence of a
character with too many answers (Patricia Belcher) muddle up the flow,
the story still delivers a sufficient number of cheap thrills, with a
wrap-up that is both silly and shocking. "Jeepers Creepers" may sputter
in the last reel, but it still delivers enough style and scares to
warrant a look by horror aficionados.

Review for Charlie's Angels (2000)
Directed by McG. Screenplay by Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon and John August,
based on the television series created by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts.
Starring Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu. Running time: 103
minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on November 18th, 2000.
Let's be clear up front: "Charlie's Angels" is not intended to be a 
serious movie. It is corny purely by design. The tone is set right off the
bat: an airliner's in-flight film is "T.J. Hooker: The Movie", provoking a
groan of "not another movie based on an old TV series" from one of the
characters. This may come as a surprise to those expecting the film
version to resemble the original 1976-1981 TV series. Being young enough
that my memories of the programme are exceedingly dim, I had no such
preconceptions, and no problem with this kind of reinvention.
All that said, though, even taken on its own merits, "Charlie's Angels" is
not without flaws. The problem is that, in taking such a kitschy tact with
the material, the filmmakers simply have not gone far enough. For camp to
succeed, it must be embraced wholeheartedly. And while "Charlie's
Angels" certainly has all the trappings of cheesy celluloid, there is a
serious vein running throughout that rather spoils the whole thing.
The main offender is the plot, which could have been lifted, for all
intents and purposes, out of any given espionage movie. As with the TV
series, "Charlie's Angels" is about three spunky female detectives. The
"Angels" this time around are feisty Dylan (Drew Barrymore), klutzy
Natalie (Cameron Diaz), and well-bred Alex (Lucy Liu). They work for
Charles Townsend (voice, as before, by John Forsythe), a reclusive
millionaire who is heard but never seen, working through an intermediary,
Bosley (Bill Murray).
The Angels' case this time around involves the abduction of computer whiz
Eric Knox (Sam Townsend) and the theft of top-secret voice identification
software he was developing. Knox's business partner Vivian Wood (Kelly
Lynch) believes the culprit is Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), who recently
failed in a buyout attempt of Knox's company. Wood thinks Corwin plans to
use the voice identification code together with his own global satellite
network to create a system able to track down any person, anywhere in the
world.
Sounds pretty typical, doesn't it? For "Charlie's Angels" to truly 
succeed, it needed something grandiose and outlandish: a story more 
appropriately gauche to match the film's overall tenor. Instead, the
script (credited to Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon and John August, but in fact
massaged by several other writers as well) makes the movie appear uneven,
as though there were different trains of thought running through the
production process. This may well be the case: beyond the opening hook,
most of the script was put together during filming, rarely a strategy
which leads to a cohesive product.
And although the writers do throw in a few twists and turns, they are
still the kind of thing one expects from this genre (one in particular is
quite reminiscent of the most recent Bond flick, "The World Is Not
Enough"). The script, for the most part, plays within the bounds and
conventions of the genre rather than taking them and turning them on their
head. It is a disappointing and lacklustre direction to take.
The visuals, fortunately, are nowhere near as stale. "Charlie's Angels" is
a first-time effort from music video helmer McG (aka Joseph McGinty
Nichol). He proves himself a competent helmer, keeping the action scenes
alive and interesting, and showcasing the three principals well. McG does
a particularly good job filming the "Matrix"-like acrobatics of the Angels
and their opponents. The whole gravity-defying concept is taken just far
enough without becoming completely absurd (another important ingredient to
good camp, of course, is knowing how much is too much).
Amongst the stars, it is the always enjoyable Drew Barrymore (also serving
as co-producer) who does the best job, investing Dylan with just the right
amount of tongue-in-cheek humor. (Check out that moonwalk, though... oy!)
Diaz does a reasonable job as well, but her laughs mostly come as a result
of (her ignorance of) her overt clumsiness, which makes for a limited
repertoire of jokes. Liu is a little too straight-laced as Alex, never
quite finding the right note to complement her co-stars. On the other
hand, though, she does the best job with the action sequences.
What is troubling about Alex, Dylan and Natalie, though, is that the movie
satisfies itself with defining them mostly through their interactions with
men. Except for Wood, all the other characters are male. All three Angels
even have subplots about their love lives, constituting virtually the only
depiction of them outside their jobs. Worse, just one of these arcs is
executed well, featuring Barrymore and her real-life beau, outlandish
comedian Tom Green. Liu is saddled with Matt LeBlanc, who basically
reprises his Joey Tribbiani role from TV's "Friends" (his character is
even an actor), while Diaz's interactions with Luke Wilson are charming in
places, but don't really go anywhere.
"Charlie's Angels" also criminally wastes two of its highest-profile
actors. Bill Murray is entirely out of place as Bosley, given no material
to suit his skills. Tim Curry is similarly mishandled, which is
particularly unfortunate since -- despite the fact that he has been
largely typecast as a villain in recent years -- he has demonstrated
considerable comedic talent in the past ("Clue" and of course "The Rocky
Horror Picture Show" to cite but two examples).
The lone standout amongst the supporting cast is Crispin Glover, who plays
a creepy trichophiliac assassin. Glover's silent Thin Man is perfectly in
keeping with the tone of the film, and is reminiscent of similarly goofy
yet memorable villains as "Goldfinger"'s Oddjob and "Moonraker"'s Jaws.
In the end, "Charlie's Angels" is a bog-standard action movie crossed
uncomfortably with an entertaining cheesy comedy. The result is reasonably
diverting (and certainly deserves praise for featuring no less than three
aggressive, proactive female heroes), but bears the scars of its troubled
production. The inevitable sequel has the potential to be a real gem --
assuming that next time, they remember to write the script first.

Title
Review for Stardom (2000)
Directed by Denys Arcand. Screenplay by Arcand and Jacob Potashnik. 
Starring Jessica Pare, Dan Aykroyd, Charles Berling. Running time: 100
minutes. This film is not yet rated by the MFCB. Reviewed on January 24th, 
2001.
As moviegoers, there is a temptation to believe that we understand more 
about the actors and actresses than we really do. All too often, fans come 
to think that they know how the stars behave off-screen, when in fact 
they're merely extrapolating from the performers' on-screen personas. 
Natalie Portman, for example, stirred up a minor controversy last year 
when she dared to suggest that those "Star Wars" aficionados who would 
approach her thinking they could automatically be friends had the wrong 
idea.
Denys Arcand's new film "Stardom" takes this cult of celebrity as its 
inspiration. It's a movie about how stars are as much manufactured as they 
are born -- how the way a person appears on camera may not only be 
completely different from the way they really are, but even different from 
the way they want to be seen. In particular, Arcand examines the rise from 
obscurity of a model -- because, after all, what better embodies the 
notion of packaging over personality better than modelling, a career which 
is all about grooming your appearance, and very little else? In a scathing 
lampoon of the industry, "Stardom" depicts its inherent superficiality by 
examining the way that true identity is not only glossed over but, in 
fact, is virtually quashed.
Tina Menzhal (Jessica Pare) is a small-town hockey player in Cornwall, 
Ontario, who happens to be captured in a nationally-distributed 
photograph. Tina's alluring, enigmatic (but entirely accidental) pose 
captures the attention of fashion photographer Philippe Gascon (Charles 
Berling) and soon her star begins to rise on the Canadian modelling scene. 
But fame is a fleeting thing, and Tina quickly finds her stock dropping,
particularly after a disastrous attempt to give her face international 
recognition by working in Paris.
Just when it seems Tina's career is on the verge of fizzling as quickly as 
it came about, though, she has the good fortune to sign on with a powerful 
agent (Thomas Gibson from TV's "Dharma & Greg" in a delightfully subdued 
performance). Soon, Tina is a household name and a tabloid fixture -- 
especially as she finds herself the object of affection of various 
powerful men, including Gascon, restauranteur Barry Levine (Dan Aykroyd), 
and Canadian ambassador Blaine de Castillon (Frank Langella). As her fame 
grows, Tina's life starts careening perilously out of control.
The most striking feature of "Stardom" is Arcand's decision to relay his 
story about the medium through the medium: virtually every scene is cast 
in the form of a TV interview or documentary segment or something similar. 
En route, Arcand takes the opportunity to satirise such media stalwarts as 
Oprah Winfrey and Jerry Springer, and other programmes which use 
appearance and formula as a substitute for genuine content. Some of these 
are successful parodies, some less so. For instance, a spoof of MuchMusic 
(Canada's MTV counterpart) is manic and frenzied when programming on the 
real television station is laid back and relaxed; a takeoff on MuchMusic 
is not necessarily unwarranted, but Arcand adopts entirely the wrong 
approach.
Still, this narrative technique works well for a time. It allows us to see 
Tina's development in almost exactly the same way as her fans, with only 
an occasional glimpse behind the curtain. However, as the film wears on, 
the device becomes cumbersome, forcing Arcand to go to more laborious 
lengths to maintain the conceit. In particular, he eventually resorts to 
using scenes from a documentary being made about Tina by an eccentric 
filmmaker (Robert Lepage). In small measures, this would not have seemed 
so awkward, but because Arcand comes to rely on the "documentary" 
increasingly in the latter half of the movie, it begins strain disbelief. 
Its status as nothing more than a storytelling artifice becomes 
transparent.
Similarly, Arcand's entire parody of the fashion and television industries 
starts off fresh, but gradually loses steam as he fails to find much new 
to say. "Stardom" is amusing and intelligent enough, but has little 
insight not already imparted by numerous other treatises on the trade. It 
loses its way as Arcand getting caught up in the absurdities of his 
storyline.
Fortunately, "Stardom" does possess a fine cast to ease the way past its 
rougher segments. Jessica Pare, in her first major film, does a fine job 
as Tina. It might appear at first that Pare has little work to do, given 
that the whole point of her character is that she is a media-molded cipher 
whose personality extends no further than this month's magazine cover. But 
Pare doesn't forget that there is a real person beneath the glitter and 
lipstick, even if Tina's depths are never fully plumbed. One running gag 
is that, whenever Tina tries to offer her own opinions or say something
intelligent, she gets cut off mid-sentence, so instead she eventually 
resorts to speaking only in the sort of meaningless sound bites that too 
many reporters love. But before this happens, Pare effectively 
communicates the frustration -- more accurately, perhaps, the 
disappointment -- Tina feels at not being allowed to be more than just a 
model. It raises the question of how her time in the spotlight would have 
gone had she not been automatically pigeonholed as a mindless camera 
drone.
Also excellent is Dan Aykroyd as Tina's erstwhile paramour, Barry. Barry 
starts the film as every bit as much the media whore as Tina. But once he 
gets sucked into her orbit, his own fifteen minutes of fame quickly begin 
to wear out, until the only thing saving him from obscurity is his 
relationship with Tina. Aykroyd's degeneration from a savvy smooth-talker 
to a desperate, ranting lunatic is "Stardom"'s most fascinating story arc.
But in too many other respects, "Stardom" is just not very satisfying. It 
is not a bad film by any means, and certainly has a lot to recommend it, 
but it sets its sights high and misses the target by a fair margin. 
Ironically, its lack of true substance means that it suffers from the very 
deficiency it seeks to criticise.

Title
Review for What Women Want (2000)
Directed by Nancy Meyers. Screenplay by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa,
from a story by Goldsmith, Yuspa and Diane Drake. Starring Mel Gibson,
Helen Hunter, Marisa Tomei. Running time: 128 minutes. Rated PG by the
MFCB. Reviewed on January 7th, 2001.
"What Women Want" is a classic example of writers conceiving an 
interesting idea, and then sitting back and putting no effort into 
developing an equally worthy script to go along with it. The result is a 
promising core let down by hopelessly routine execution, a movie which 
could have been a superior comedy but instead will likely fade quickly 
from the collective memory. The few moments which are borne of genuine 
inspiration simply serve as reminders of what could have been, with just a 
little extra work.
Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) is a chauvinistic ad executive, a man who sees 
the opposite sex purely in terms of sexual conquests and menial servitude. 
To his horror, Nick is passed over for a promotion in favour of a woman: 
Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt), who has been brought in to help the company 
capture accounts for female-oriented products, a highly profitable sector. 
Then, one night, a drunk Nick accidentally electrocutes himself in his 
bathtub. Instead of dying, however, he awakens the next morning to 
discover that he can hear women's thoughts.
Nick is first horrified by his newfound ability, but gradually comes to 
appreciate the possibilities it offers. Nick begins using his power to 
poach ad ideas from Darcy's mind so he can pass them off as his own, in an 
effort to reinforce his position as the agency's number one designer. At 
the same time, though, Nick finds himself falling in love with Darcy, 
forcing him to make a pivotal choice between his emotions and his career.
All of this starts out well enough, Nick's initial glimpses into women's 
minds often proving hilarious. Particularly good is Nick's gradual 
discovery of just how overinflated is his understanding of how the women 
in his life perceive him. In one terrific scene, Nick walks through his 
office, being mentally whipped by his coworkers left and right -- and when 
he finally encounters his two most trusted office lackeys (Delta Burke and 
Valerie Perrine), he discovers that they don't think anything at all.
But things begin to slide downhill from there. Apart from the main Darcy 
McGuire storyline, the movie also introduces a number of other subplots, 
most of which simply seem to exist to kill time. One, in which delinquent 
dad Nick tries to make up for lost time with his daughter (Ashley 
Johnson), is amusing if rather predictable. Another, about a suicidal 
office clerk (Judy Greer) is shameless in its execution -- it's clearly 
present just to show us how much Nick's behaviour toward women improves as 
he makes use of his mindreading ability. It's the type of story element 
which reappears as needed, and is otherwise ignored completely.
But most frustrating are the sequences featuring Marisa Tomei as Lola, a 
coffee shop worker infatuated with Nick. After it claims considerable 
screentime in the movie's first half, it appears that screenwriters Josh 
Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa (working from a story they developed with Diane 
Drake) simply ran out of ideas for the Nick/Lola romance. Moreover, its 
development seems to run counter to the burgeoning Nick/Darcy romance. As 
a result, Lola is summarily dumped from the film, exiting in an abrupt 
scene which strains at the bounds of disbelief.
And this is all the more disappointing because Gibson and Tomei 
demonstrate far more on-screen chemistry than Gibson and Hunt. One of the 
movie's most serious flaws is that it never successfully make the case 
that Nick and Darcy are meant to be together; their relationship is never 
more than an artifice of the script. Indeed, the movie offers far more 
persuasive arguments for them to be adversaries instead of friends (let 
alone lovers). The interaction between Nick and Lola, on the other hand, 
is far more charming. I found myself longing for Tomei's return during the 
interminable Gibson/Hunt scenes which take up much of the film's second 
half.
That said, both principals do good work here, even if their pairing is 
less than successful. In particular, Gibson, who has always shown a knack 
for comedy even in his more action-oriented pictures, is clearly having a 
lot of fun. His misogyny at the start of the film is deliciously 
politically incorrect, and his reactions to the thoughts of the women 
around him are nicely portrayed. For instance, a scene in which Nick 
learns that his lovemaking technique has nowhere near the effect he 
believed is hilarious -- topped only by the way he then compensates for 
his deficiencies.
Much like the script, the direction from Nancy Meyers is a mostly routine 
contribution dotted with more impressive moments. In one nice shot of Nick 
and Darcy kissing, Meyers uses a close-up so extreme that Gibson and Hunt 
-- their profiles in shadow against the dimly-lit set -- seem to consume 
the screen. We are enveloped in their embrace. But Meyers also drops the 
ball more than once, particularly with an inexplicable scene toward the 
end of the movie which wraps up the matter of Nick's mind-reading ability. 
Meyers also does a poor job of maintaining the pace of the film, and the
result is a picture which feels very long at two hours and eight minutes.
As for the promise of insight into the feminine psyche offered by the 
title, it is sadly not to be. "What Women Want" really doesn't say 
anything more about the desires of the fairer sex than any one of a 
hundred other romantic comedies. Of course, based on the box office take 
of this film (well over US$100 million as of this writing) and reported 
statistics of the female percentage of the audience (about 60%), part of 
the answer to the question of what they want may be "movies like this 
one". If that's the case, then this is further evidence that I don't 
really understand women. But, like most guys, I already knew that.

Title
Review for You Can Count on Me (2000)
Directed by Kenneth Lonergan, from his screenplay. Starring Laura Linney,
Mark Ruffalo, Matthew Broderick. Running time: 100 minutes. Rated AA for
coarse language by the MFCB. Reviewed on March 28th, 2001.
Let's be honest: movies don't often deal with reality. Filmmakers tend to 
prefer high drama, incredulous farce, or invented fantasy, and while 
these genres can be effective and entertaining, their connection to our
daily lives is often tenuous. In cinema, there's usually a beginning, a 
middle and an end, all punctuated by moments of great suspense and 
emotion. In real life, the highs aren't so high nor the lows so low, and 
there's nothing but middle.
"You Can Count On Me" is a film which is as close an approximation of 
reality -- real reality, not movie reality -- as I've seen. The story it 
tells is one which began before the theatre curtains went up, and which 
continues on past the credits. Those looking for a plot in which 
everything is ultimately wrapped up in a neat, tidy package will probably 
be somewhat disappointed; the movie has an ending, but it is not the 
ending. On the other hand, audiences desiring a genuine portrayal of real
people with real problems should be very satisfied indeed.
Sammy Prescott (Laura Linney) is a loan officer in the small town of 
Scottsville, trying to raise young son Rudy (Rory Culkin) all by herself. 
Her parents died in a car accident when she was young, and this left her 
and her brother Terry to raise each other. Sammy had her wild phase but 
survived it. Terry, on the other hand, is a drifter who checks in with his 
sister only every few months and seems to be going nowhere in life.
One day, Terry (Mark Ruffalo) returns to Scottsville. He only plans to 
stay long enough to borrow money from Sammy, but ends up sticking around a
while longer. Terry begins bonding with Rudy, who has never had a father 
figure -- he takes him to a bar to play pool, and lets him help out with 
the plumbing. This meets with the disapproval of Sammy, however, who is 
concerned that Terry -- never having properly grown up himself -- is a 
poor role model for her son. At the same time, straight-laced Sammy is 
experiencing turmoil of her own: not only is she involved in a 
dispassionate relationship with her on-again, off-again boyfriend Bob (Jon 
Tenney), but she starts an affair with her nerdy new (married) boss Brian 
(Matthew Broderick).
"You Can Count On Me" is written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, a 
filmmaker who clearly understands people. Beyond an opening flashback to 
the accident which claimed the lives of the elder Prescotts, cinematic 
artifice is all but absent from the movie. This is a simple story told in 
a simple style, which is nonetheless absolutely perfect. Lonergan's 
approach is to be direct and sincere, neither too harsh nor too tender, 
thereby lending his situations and the characters a stronger sense of 
realism. Nothing happens simply for dramatic purposes, and even the 
picture's warm humour arises naturally from the goings-on, as opposed to
being artificially grafted onto the proceedings.
But this technique cannot be successful unless we believe in, and are 
engaged by, the main characters. Let's be honest again: more often than 
not, everyday life just isn't that interesting -- there's a reason why 
most movies don't follow this realistic approach. In the end, then, "You 
Can Count On Me" is an actors' movie. Without performances which are 
believable but still captivating, "You Can Count On Me" would be no more 
interesting than this morning's office gossip.
How fortunate we are, then, that Lonergan has assembled such a splendid 
cast. It is Linney who has received the most accolades, and for good 
reason -- quite frankly, it is Linney and not Julia Roberts who deserved 
the Academy Award. Sammy is a strikingly multifaceted character. On the 
one hand, she is a doting and responsible parent, straightlaced and
dependable. On the other hand, she's emotionally confused, and in the 
space of the film's running time we see her involved in no less than two 
ill-advised and potentially disastrous romantic liaisons. Linney 
demonstrates tremendous range, but does so without losing sight of the 
character she's playing. Too often, actors translate their roles into just 
a handful of convenient default demeanours. Linney approaches Sammy as 
though she is a real person, complete with a dizzying array of emotions 
and responses; as a result, Sammy becomes real.
No less impressive is Ruffalo. Screw-ups and black sheep are a staple of 
the family drama, but Ruffalo ensures that Terry does not fall so easily 
into these categories. Terry is a man who makes mistakes. Sometimes he 
learns from them and sometimes he doesn't. Sometimes he makes up for them 
and sometimes he doesn't. One thing he isn't is a man who behaves 
according to type. The complexity of the character is particularly 
evident in his interaction with Rudy: Terry is neither a godsend for the 
child nor a devil on his shoulder. Their relationship follows not a 
straight line but instead experiences any number of twists and turns, and 
is all the more satisfying because of it. 
Also fine is Broderick as the nebbish Brian, a man who is never entirely 
loathsome (or else Sammy's affair with him would be tough to swallow), but 
who always finds a way to rub the audience wrong. And Culkin shows that, 
like older brother Kieran, he is capable of genuine acting and not just 
mawking for the camera. Rudy is not preternaturally intelligent nor laden 
with problems nor unbearably cute; he's just a regular kid unique in ways 
all his own, and there aren't enough of those in the movies.
By the end of the picture, both Terry and Sammy have changed. And while 
the implication is certainly that they have both benefitted from the 
sometimes tortuous renewal of their family bond, I liked the fact that 
Lonergan doesn't overemphasise this development. Both siblings still have 
lives that are full of questions and problems, and futures with plenty of 
uncertainties. Just like you, me, and everybody else.

Title
Review for Coyote Ugly (2000)
Directed by David McNally. Screenplay by Gina Wendkos. Starring Piper
Perabo, Adam Garcia, John Goodman. Running time: 100 minutes. Rated AA by
the MFCB. Reviewed on August 11th, 2000.
Is there a story used more often in Hollywood films than the underdog who
makes good? I doubt it. We've seen it so often now that we know what
beats the film will hit even before it does. There's the optimistic 
opening, followed quickly by our hero getting a taste of sobering reality.
But our hero proceeds undeterred, slowly moving up in the world and
probably acquiring a love interest along the way. Then we hit the false
dawn, as everything seems to be going our hero's way when, suddenly,
everything goes wrong. Usually, this is linked to a complication in the
romantic subplot, and often to our hero misinterpreting an innocent
situation. Our hero spirals to his or her lowest ebb, about to give up
hope entirely. But then, out of the blue, there is a sudden source of
inspiration -- often a sacrifice or about-face by another character -- and
the hero gives it one last go. Everything ends in triumph -- and, of
course, a cuddly reunion with the love interest.
The underdog scenario is so familiar it almost feels like one of the
family. But so familiar, too, that it is difficult to get really worked up
about this kind of movie. Virtually every twist, every possible variation
has already been played out; the capacity for invention in the genre is
approaching nil. We cannot judge the movie on how creative it was, how
much it surprised us or affected us, because it is difficult to be
surprised or affected when you can guess where the film is going half an
hour ahead of time. Instead, the responsibility falls on the shoulders of
the filmmakers to take this timeworn concept and turn it into something,
if not novel, then at least entertaining.
The newest underdog movie is "Coyote Ugly", and the shoulders in question
belong mostly to Piper Perabo. Perabo plays Violet Sanford, an aspiring
songwriter who leaves her small hometown to go to New York City, where she
hopes to make a name for herself. What Violet doesn't realise is that she
can't just walk up to a record company and hand them her demo tape --
illogically, she needs to make a name for herself first. Unfortunately,
Violet has tremendous stage fright, and can't work up the courage to sing
her songs to a live audience. Meanwhile, she meets Kevin (Adam Garcia), a
charming Australian whom she mistakes for a club manager. Out of the
awkward meeting springs a budding romance, but one that is hamstrung by
Kevin's unwillingness to disclose his own secrets.
Violet gets a job working at a raucous bar called the Coyote Ugly, run by
tough-talking Lil (Maria Bello). At the Coyote Ugly, drinks are only
served straight and in shot glasses, and the bartenders are sexy women who
hop up on the bar to dance, spray the customers with water, and light
things on fire. Slowly, Violet begins to find a home at the Coyote Ugly,
but this brings her into conflict with both her father (John Goodman) and
Kevin, who thinks Violet is using her bartending job as an excuse not to
pursue her songwriting dreams.
What "Coyote Ugly" has going for it is a pair of charming performances
from Perabo and Garcia, who have a lot of screen appeal both together and
individually -- particularly remarkable since both are basically newcomers
to feature films. Perabo did a good job in a rather thankless role in
this summer's "The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle"; here she's on
somewhat surer ground. In some ways, Violet is rather unbelievable
character -- I found her complete naivete about the workings of the music
business hard to swallow, and I kept wondering why she didn't just go out
and find a singer to collaborate with (it's not like every songwriter has
a good voice, after all!). But Perabo manages to make Violet work; I look
forward to the day that she gets to sink her teeth into a more substantial
character. Garcia, for his part, demonstrates great comic timing and a
strong on-screen presence.
The script by Gina Wendkos -- another relative unknown -- has a number of
funny moments and nice little touches, like Kevin's comic book habit
("It's manly," he insists, while Violet counters that "it's sweet"). But
it also hews very closely to all the genre cliches, and at times
feels obscenely contrived. Plot developments jump out of nowhere for the
express purpose of manipulating our emotions, like a scene (never referred
to again) where Violet's apartment is broken into, and the emergency money
left her by a friend is stolen. Great movies slip such incidents
seamlessly into the flow of the film. That you can so easily see the
puppeteer's strings in "Coyote Ugly" is indicative of how much Wendkos and
first-time director David McNally still have to learn.
I was also disappointed that, given the movie's title, the Coyote Ugly bar
and its staff was used more as a backdrop than a pivotal element. The
bartenders, even Lil, are permitted very little development, which is
unfortunate because I got the impression that there were some good
characters and enjoyable performances lurking there, trying to break out.
It's unfortunate that more attention is instead paid to Goodman's
character, who is never much more than a convenient plot device. Although
Goodman is always fun to watch, he's pretty much cruising in neutral here,
playing his role like the first cousin of his Dan Conner character from
the sitcom "Roseanne".
"Coyote Ugly", then, is a fun, lightweight, but ultimately forgettable
entry into the summer roster. For the many neophytes who contributed to
it, it may well be looked back on in ten years' time as a good beginning
which paved the way to much better things.
If nothing else, viewers should keep an eye out for a cameo appearance by
Tara McLean, one of Canada's best but most underpromoted 
singer-songwriters, as an open mic night singer early in the film.

Review for Rang-e khoda (1999)
THE COLOR OF PARADISE (1999) / ** 1/2
   aka RANG-E KHODA [Farsi; English subtitles]
Directed by Majid Majidi, from his screenplay. Starring Mohsen Ramezani,
Hossein Mahjoub, Salime Feizi. Running time: 90 minutes. Rated PG for
frightening scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on November 7th, 2000.
To the best of my knowledge, "The Color Of Paradise" is the first Iranian
film to be screened in a Newfoundland cinema. I confess that I had little
idea what to expect heading into the showing. My general impression of
Iran, as a country, is less than favorable. I was raised during the
Iran-Iraq war and the reign of the Ayatollah Khomeini; when I reflect on
Iran, my first thought is of the infamous death threat made by the former
Ayatollah against author Salman Rushdie because of the content of his
book "The Satanic Verses".
But it would be a mistake for me to tar all Iranians with the same
brush. And indeed, "The Color Of Paradise" is a film totally divorced from
such international scandal. It is a very small, quiet, spiritual movie, as
far removed from world politics as it is possible to be. This is a story
not of political war or religious fanaticism, but of one sightless boy and
the way his blindness helps him to see God better than anyone else in his
life.
As the film opens, we are introduced to young Mohammad (Mohsen Ramezani),
who attends a school for the blind in Tehran. Classes have ended for the
year (city schools are better than rural schools, Mohammad later tells his
sisters, because they close earlier) and his father, Hashem, is supposed
to come and bring him home. But for a long time, Mohammad's father does
not come. When he finally does, it is a joyless reunion -- Hashem (Hossein
Mahjoub) asks the school officials to keep Mohammad for the summer. It
transpires that Mohammad's father, a widower, fears that having a blind
son around will impair his chances of finding a new wife, something he
wants very desperately.
Ultimately, Hashem is compelled to bring his son home. There, Mohammad
enjoys a happier existence around his two young sisters and his beloved
Granny (Salime Feizi). But Hashem eventually manages to pawn Mohammad off
on a blind carpenter (Morteza Fatemi), who agrees to take the boy in as an
apprentice. This decision precipitates an upheaval in the lives of all
Mohammad's family, and poses the question of who is truly blind -- the boy
or his father?
What is most striking about "The Color Of Paradise" is the way
writer/director Majid Majidi and cinematographer Mohammad Davudi have
managed to capture the simple beauty of northern Iran. Be it the humble
splendour of children playing in an alfalfa field, or the furious vista of
a summer rainstorm, the countryside is brought to vivid life, and is as
much a character as any of the people inhabiting the film.
This is accentuated by Mohammad Reza Delpak's excellent work on the
soundtrack. To reflect the enhancement of young Mohammad's other senses in
compensation for his blindness, the noises of the Iranian environment is
made as vital as its appearance. The movie is filled with the sounds of
nature, from the easily identifiable -- such as a woodpecker hammering at
a tree -- to the more mysterious and exotic. It brings a new dimension to
the movie, and demonstrates just how important and effective sound can be,
if handled skillfully.
Ramezani does terrific work here for such a young actor, delivering a very
natural performance as Mohammad. When the boy cries during an emotional
conversation with the carpenter, his grief is heartfelt and sincere.
Ramezani is not overly cloying or cute; even a rather sentimental scene in
which he rescues a baby bird which has fallen from its nest is not
overplayed. Ramezani makes Mohammad believable.
Less successful is Mahjoub, whose demeanour borders at times on the
preposterous. Majidi is wise not to portray Hashem as an entirely
villainous figure -- his motives in seeking a new wife are sincere, even
if his methods leave a lot to be desired. But Mahjoub cannot hope to 
compare to his young co-star's visceral portrayal, and this leaves Hashem
seeming weak and underdeveloped. Whereas Ramezani embodies his character,
Mahjoub feels very much like nothing more than an actor playing a role.
But although Majidi does an excellent job with the general presentation of
"The Color Of Paradise", he is less successful in its actual development.
These sorts of movies need a steady progression to maintain viewer
interest, but Majidi's story just stops for long stretches of time. As a
result, "The Color Of Paradise" makes for far less compelling watching
than it ought to, and indeed the pacing is so somnabulent in places that I
found myself almost disinterested. There just does not appear to be enough
substance in the movie to support its feature-length running time; I think
Majidi would have been far better served by transforming it into a short
film.
Also unfortunate is the movie's ending, which is so contrived as to strain
belief. It does, at least, deliver with an appropriate and moving pay-off 
which perfectly reflects the film's themes. But this is one of those cases
when you can see the puppeteer's strings; the events of "The Color Of
Paradise"'s climax appear to happen not because they are a natural
development, but simply because they were required to end the movie.
As such, "The Color Of Paradise" ends up being a well-intentioned movie
bogged down by clumsy filmmaking. Young people, who are presumably its
target audience, will likely be particularly bored by its slow movement
and lack of interesting characters (beyond Mohammad, of course).
Ramezani's performance and the beautiful imagery are commendable, though,
and ensure that a viewing of "The Color Of Paradise" is a memorable
experience.

Title
Review for Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)
Directed by Dominic Sena. Screenplay by Scott Rosenberg. Starring Nicolas 
Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Delroy Lindo. Running time: 121 minutes. Rated AA 
by the MFCB. Reviewed on June 11th, 2000.
Movies like "Gone In 60 Seconds" boggle my mind. Here we have a cast of 
Academy Award-winning actors. We have a scenario that promises lots of 
high-octane action and excitement. We have a screenplay written by Scott 
Rosenberg, who penned the entertaining "Con Air". We have that film's 
producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, who has also overseen such thrilling fare as 
"The Rock", "Crimson Tide" and "Beverly Hills Cop" (although, it should 
be noted, also masterminded that most gratuitous waste of celluloid, 
"Armageddon"). And yet despite these promising ingredients, we have a 
movie that just doesn't deliver. "Gone In 60 Seconds" feels like it can 
barely get out of neutral, let alone shift into high gear.
Nicolas Cage plays "Memphis" Raines, formerly California's best car thief 
and now retired to run a gas station and go-kart track. Unbeknownst to 
Memphis, his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) has followed in his footsteps 
and is trying to make his own name boosting autos. But Kip messes up one 
night while on the job for Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston), who 
took over when Memphis left town. Contacting Memphis, Calitri informs him 
that he needs to steal fifty rare cars in the space of four days, or Kip 
will be killed.
Reluctantly agreeing to reenter his old profession, Memphis starts 
getting back in touch with members of his old gang, including mentor Otto 
(Robert Duvall) and ex-girlfriend Sway (Angelina Jolie); Kip brings along 
his own young accomplices to fill out the ranks. But by the time the team 
has been assembled and the reconnaissance carried out, only twenty-four 
hours remain before Calitri's deadline, forcing Memphis and his friends 
to boost the fifty cars in a single night. And to add to their troubles, 
they must contend with veteran cop Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo), who
missed his chance to nab Memphis once, and does not intend to let it pass 
him by again.
"Gone In 60 Seconds" is based loosely on the popular 1974 drive-in 
feature by HB Halicki, and I headed into the theatre expecting one of 
those movies which sacrificed plot and characterisation in favour of 
relentless excitement. I was half right: there's not much plot and not 
much characterisation, but it takes an hour and a half before the film 
even starts trying to get the adrenalin pumping.
The big problem with the movie is that it feels like it was made from the 
first draft of the script rather than the final version. Rosenberg's 
storytelling is extremely clumsy. After a mildly entertaining opening 
bit, we are sucked into a dull and overlong middle section in which 
Memphis brings together his team, checks out the cars, and reencounters 
old sparring partner Castlebeck. Not only is all this extremely tedious, 
it feels almost unnecessary. Rosenberg is obviously trying to give each 
of the players a distinctive personality but lacks the skill to do so, 
and would have been better off spotlighting just a handful. The result is
that Memphis' team consists of a dozen people all with minimal 
characterisation, and none of whom we end up caring very much about.
This is particularly unfortunate because it means that some very talented 
actors like Duvall, Ribisi and Jolie are pretty much wasted in roles that 
struggle for screen time. Duvall, for example, is consigned to standing 
around a warehouse most of the time. Jolie appears just long enough to 
remind us of the tremendous charisma she brings to any role, and make us 
wish her part was more significant. Eccleston, as the malevolent Calitri, 
seems like he could have been a delightfully cartoonish sort of villain, 
but appears only briefly, in the film's first and last half hours. Cage, 
meanwhile, seems to be on autopilot as Memphis; he does what he can with 
the paltry material, but there is no real enthusiasm to the performance. 
Cage lowers himself to the standards of the script, rather than trying to 
bring it up to his own level.
Examples of these low standards litter "Gone In 60 Seconds". There are 
some sequences which are so contrived, and feel so obviously shoehorned 
into the plot, that I found myself shaking my head in the theatre. For 
example, late in the film, one of Kip's friends -- a computer wizard who 
usually stays behind a laptop rather than heading out into the field -- 
suddenly demands to go on a heist. That he nearly screws everything up 
should come as a surprise to no one. Rosenberg's dialogue also verges on 
the excruciating at several points; Calitri is described as coming after 
Kip "like stains on a mattress", for instance.
"Gone In 60 Seconds" finally gets moving when after an hour and a half -- 
gasp, shock -- we finally get some car chases. These are undeniably 
engrossing, although I was disappointed that they weren't a little more 
inventive. Certainly, they are inferior to such memorable chase sequences 
as, say, Gene Hackman's in "The French Connection". They are also 
somewhat hamstrung by Dominic Sena's otherwise competent direction. More 
than once, Sena is unable to keep the depiction of the car chases fluid 
and coherent, and this difficulty in following the action works against 
its entertainment value.
But perhaps the worst thing that can be said about the car chases is that 
they lead up to the film's routine, lacklustre and faintly ludicrous 
conclusion. It is here that the laziness of Rosenberg's script is most 
evident, giving us an ending which not only steals from every other 
B-grade action movie, but also totally dismisses one of his principals' 
established characterisation.
As mindless summer entertainment, "Gone In 60 Seconds" isn't bad, but 
even the most avid action fan is likely to be turned off by the movie's 
lethargic pacing. Compared to the film's two hour running time, the 
twenty minutes or so of car chases seems paltry, given that the 
anticipation of these scenes is the movie's main selling point. "Gone In 
60 Seconds" will make you wish you'd been gone from the theatre in a lot 
less than 119 minutes.

Title
Review for Shanghai Noon (2000)
Directed by Tom Dey. Screenplay by Miles Millar and Alfred Gough. Starring
Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu. Running time: 111 minutes. Rated PG
for mild language by the MFCB. Reviewed on June 5th, 2000.
The western genre is one that, in retrospect, seems kind of silly. Modern
revisionism like "Unforgiven" and "Dancing With Wolves" aside, the western
in general is a rather unfortunate black-and-white look at the mid-to-late
nineteenth century, with "the Cowboys" painted as the good guys, and "the
Indians" cast as the villains. The richness of the authentic era is often
supplanted by simpleminded melodrama, a litany of archetypes in spurs and
ten-gallon hats. Which is not to say that these movies aren't necessarily
a lot of fun -- it's tough to beat something like "Stagecoach" for sheer
exhilaration -- but it's hard to dismiss the notion that part of the
reason for the decline of the western was its strict adherence to this
imaginary, often offensive version of the past.
It's ironic, then, that a movie like "Shanghai Noon" -- which seeks to
be both a traditional summer action picture and a pastiche of the western
-- offers a surprisingly genuine view of the Wild West. This isn't the
kind of realism offered by the aforementioned Eastwood and Costner films,
where you could almost feel the heat of the desert and the gallop of 
the horses under your feet. But "Shanghai Noon" makes some surprisingly
astute observations about the whole Cowboy-and-Indian dichotomy which
is rather unexpected in this kind of comedy.
Jackie Chan plays the amusingly-named Chon Wang (which by itself should
give you an idea of the kind of humor of the picture), a Chinese Imperial
Guard who is sent to Nevada to rescue Princess Pei Pei ("Ally McBeal's"
Lucy Liu). The princess has been kidnapped from the Forbidden City by the
traitorous Lo Fong (Roger Yuan) and is being held for ransom in a work
camp populated by other enslaved Chinese. Chon's job is made more
difficult when he is erroneously pegged as the sidekick of train robber
Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), and then in a drunken stupor gets married to a
sly Native American woman (Brandon Merrill). Thrust into an uneasy
partnership and hunted by both Marshall Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley) and
O'Bannon's old gang, Chon and Roy have to team up to travel to Carson City
and rescue Pei Pei.
Much of the amusement of "Shanghai Noon" arises from the nature of Chan's
character: here is a figure who seems alien to both the settlers and the
Native Americans alike. One hilarious sequence really puts it all in
perspective. Chon, having saved a Sioux child from a tribe of Crow
warriors, is invited to join their revelries one night. Chon knows very
little English and no Sioux whatsoever but tries to discuss his mission 
with the Natives all the same. Groans one Sioux, "Now he's saying it
slower. Like that'll help." 
Similarly, there is a sequence involving the other Imperial Guards sent
to America, who have become separated from Chon Wang. Their interpreter is
murdered, but they manage to gain passage with a family of Puritans --
who figure they can't be Indians, so they must be Jews. The script, by
Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, cuts through the cultural barriers; by
showing how ridiculously people act toward Chon and the other Chinese, it
acts as a not-so-subtle reflection of the silliness underlying all those
old Western serials.
Indeed, "Shanghai Noon" as a whole does a very good job of finding just
the right balance between comedy, action, and social commentary. And while
none of these are done exceedingly well -- there aren't a lot of
absolutely uproarious moments, and Chan's stunts are accomplished but
rarely of the amazing variety -- they do come together in a pleasant, 
enjoyable package.
Owen Wilson didn't impress me much as a one-note character in "The
Haunting", but does a much better job here. It helps, no doubt, that he's
been given a pretty interesting character to work with: O'Bannon sort of
straddles the line between wearing white and black hats. He's a train
robber but he's always polite and never steals from ladies. He's torn
between rescuing Pei Pei because it's the right thing to do, and because
he might be able to steal the gold brought to America for her ransom. Even
though he's ostensibly a hero, Wilson maintains a believable roguishness
throughout the proceedings -- all given an almost surreal edge by the fact
that he's a cowboy who sounds like he should be surfing the waves off
Waikiki.
Chan does his usual capable job, although he plays the buffoon a little
too much early on, making his character's later competence seem 
incongruous. Liu makes the most of a small role, playing a princess who
possesses both strength and grace. Somewhat less successful is Merrill as
Chon's Native bride: although she handles the mostly silent part well, the
character itself forms the basis of the movie's most unsuccessful subplot. 
Obviously intended to be a parody of the many inadvertent, neglected and
often ill-fated Native brides in westerns (see "The Searchers", for
example), Merrill's character is used as a deus ex machina a few times too
many, and is an uncomfortable insertion into the story. Nowhere is this
more apparent than at the end of the film: the character's final fate is
contrived and almost nonsensical, as if Millar and Gough had no idea what
else to do with her.
Despite its unconventional marriage of martial arts and cowboy antics,
"Shanghai Noon" is not a movie that will reinvent the western genre. But
that's not what it sets out to do: it's basically an excuse for Jackie
Chan to do what he does best in a new environment, and get in a few digs
at popular cinema along the way. The combination might be unorthodox,
the material somewhat uneven, but somehow, it works pretty well.

Review for A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)
A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (2001) / *** 1/2
Directed by Steven Spielberg. Screenplay by Spielberg, from a story by Ian
Watson, based on the short story "Supertoys Last All Summer Long" by Brian
Aldiss. Starring Haley Joel Osment, Frances O'Connor, Jude Law. Running
time: 146 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 22nd, 2001.
Synopsis: David (Osment), a child-like robot programmed to express love, 
is given to a family whose son was placed in suspended animation because 
he suffers from an incurable disease. But when the son unexpectedly 
returns, David is no longer needed. His "mother" (O'Connor) abandons him 
rather than let him be destroyed. Finding friendship with another robot, 
Gigolo Joe (Law), David sets off on a quest to find the Blue Fairy, who he 
believes will help him regain his mother's love.
Review: How do we define a person? Where does "artificial" end and 
"intelligence" begin? Is there a difference between someone who loves us, 
and something programmed to do so? These are the questions raised by 
"A.I.", a film directed by Spielberg but so reminiscent of its originator, 
Kubrick, that his ghost haunts almost every frame. "A.I." wraps these 
conundrums in a quest, but at the end of the quest lie more questions. The 
answers are left to the viewers, who are pulled en route in every 
direction. Is David's longing for his mother proof of his humanity? 
Perhaps, but still, David is undeniably not human, as we are periodically 
reminded. Whatever one concludes, "A.I." is certainly one of the most 
thought-provoking films in recent memory. It is abetted by spectacular 
performances, with Osment proving he is perhaps the best child actor 
working today. David is endearing, but a persistent awkward edge reminds 
us of his artificiality. And Spielberg's visuals are stunning, perfectly 
complementing "A.I."'s central contradiction. His humans live in a stark 
world of clinical coldness; the robots inhabit a chaotic, colourful 
universe. The humans are passive and remote; the robots cling desperately 
to life. And although "A.I." does suffer from an extended coda that never 
quite works, it remains a fine tribute to the genius that was Kubrick.

Title
Review for Replacements, The (2000)
Directed by Howard Deutch. Screenplay by Vince McKewin. Starring Keanu
Reeves, Gene Hackman, Brooke Langton. Running time: 119 minutes. Rated AA
by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 26th, 2000.
There is a scene in "The Replacements" (actually, two scenes, since the
film has a tendency to repeat itself for the benefit of those with short
memories) where a dim-witted stripper-turned-cheerleader enthusiastically
joins in one of those "Give me an 'E'!" cheers, only to forget the letter
she's supposed to announce. Fortunately, though, she's so happy and so
dim that she just keeps going along with the others as if her gaffe had 
never happened in the first place.
This sequence is perfectly representative of "The Replacements" as a 
whole. This is a pretty dumb movie, but it is so cheerfully dumb that, in
the end, it's hard to really dislike it. It's got an embarrassingly 
recycled plot, tepid character development, and mostly lame humor. But 
Hollywood has produced far poorer movies, and maybe that's the best way to
think about "The Replacements" -- not great, but think of how it could
have turned out!
I can almost guarantee that you've seen the story before; it's the same
old underdog-team-makes-good template, just recast in a new setting. "The
Replacements" takes place during the 1987 professional football players'
strike, albeit in a parallel universe where the NFL teams have been
replaced by squads with different nicknames. Edward O'Neil (Jack Warden),
owner of perpetual also-rans the Washington Sentinels, is determined to
see his team finally make it into the playoffs after seven years. 
Washington just needs to win three of their last four games, and they're
in. O'Neil decides to finish off the season using replacement players, and
hires coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) to assemble them.
Instead of bringing in a semi-pro team like some other franchises have
done, McGinty seeks out a group of has-beens and never-weres. This motley
group includes such notables as a sumo wrestler, a pair of gangsta
brothers, and a lightning-fast receiver with permanent butterfingers. The
quarterback is Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a college star who has never
recovered mentally from a crushing Sugar Bowl defeat. The movie proceeds
in typical fashion from there. We experience the trials and tribulations
of the scab Sentinels as they try to bond as a team, deal with the
resentful striking players they've replaced, and find themselves on a
collision course with the inevitable Big Game which will decide the
season. No points for guessing how it all pans out.
There is, of course, an obligatory romantic subplot, between Falco and the
head cheerleader (Brooke Langton). This scenes are excruciating in their
contrivance. It is painfully obvious that the romance has been added to
the movie because the filmmakers felt it was a necessity of the genre,
rather than a natural outgrowth of the story. It is telling that the
camera and film editor do more work to establish the relationship than 
Reeves and Langton. The scene where they first meet is particularly
embarrassing -- just count the number of times we cut back and forth 
between their wistful glances at one another. It would be hilarious if it
wasn't played so straight. Langton's is the most superfluous character in
"The Replacements", and the fact that she never develops any semblance of
an interesting personality doesn't help matters.
And this is unfortunate, because the other subplot involving the
cheerleaders -- namely, the fact that the hastily-assembled squad is
mostly made up of exotic dancers -- is surprisingly well-handled. It's a
very funny notion, and is not carried too far. The only thing that doesn't
make much sense is just why a new group of cheerleaders would have been
required in the first place; why in the world would a players' strike
affect them? (Of course, the same could be said about the need for O'Neil
to hire McGinty.)
Neither Reeves nor Hackman turn in particularly memorable work here. It
seems obvious that the part of their brain normally devoted to acting is
instead being put to work figuring out just why they agreed to appear in a
such a run-of-the-mill movie. Some of the supporting players are more
effective, simply because they seem to be have a lot more fun. Rhys Ifans,
as the Welsh kicker Nigel "The Leg" Gruff, is a delight. Jon Favreau as
SWAT-team-member-turned-blocker Daniel Bateman, who seems to share a few
branches of the family tree with Animal from "The Muppet Show", is
enjoyable as well.
But perhaps the most curious aspect of "The Replacements" is its treatment
of the whole strike scenario. If it had just been left in the background
as an excuse for a group of sadsack football players to wind up in a major
game, that would have been fine. But instead, the striking players are
presented as the movie's villains, particularly Eddie Martel (Brett 
Cullen), the Sentinels' regular quarterback. Cullen portrays him as
arrogant, seedy, and thoroughly obnoxious. No thought is ever given to
the players' side in the labor dispute. Right from the start they're
painted as lazy and greedy: a player gives up a possible touchdown in the
dying seconds of the last game before the strike, rather than risk injury.
Certainly, it seems absurd that people already making millions of dollars
should go on strike to protest their wages. But what must be borne in mind
is that the owners rake in significantly more money and -- most
importantly of all -- the fans are willing to pay inflated ticket prices
to watch the games. Player salaries have attained these exorbitant levels
not through some artifice on the part of their union, but essentially
because this is what the market has determined they can and should earn.
Unfortunately, "The Replacements" is so eager to have a group of 
characters that can be labelled as the bad guys that none of this is so
much as considered. And that is as good an indicator as any of the
complacency which grips this project. The result is a movie which is good
for an occasional laugh but, before long, will be mercifully forgotten.
Reeves and Hackman deserve better.

Review for Zoolander (2001)
Directed by Ben Stiller. Screenplay by Drake Sather, Stiller, and John
Hamburg, based on a story and a character created by Sather and Stiller. 
Starring Stiller, Owen Wilson, Christine Taylor. Running time: 90 minutes. 
Rated PG for mature theme by the MFCB. Reviewed on September 30th, 2001.
Synopsis: Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is a male model in the twilight of his 
career who becomes brainwashed by fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell). 
Mugatu wants Zoolander to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, who 
plans to introduce new child-labour laws which will cripple the fashion 
industry. Mugatu's scheme is uncovered by reporter Matilda Jeffries 
(Taylor), who convinces Zoolander to join forces with his archrival, 
up-and-comer Hansel (Wilson), to stop Mugatu before Zoolander's 
programming is activated.
Review: "Zoolander" will no doubt invite comparisons with the "Austin 
Powers" movies, since both title characters are image-conscious dolts 
embroiled in global conspiracies. But whereas Austin was a satire on the
entire James Bond-style spy genre, Zoolander is just a pastiche on a 
specific profession: the male model, with the espionage elements grafted 
on rather arbitrarily. There is, therefore, comparatively less material to 
be mined in this release, but Stiller does a good job of working his 
premise for every last ounce of humour. As Zoolander, Stiller finds the 
right note somewhere between sympathetic dimwittedness and head-smacking 
stupidity. He matches up well with Wilson, whose performance here echoes 
his role in "Shanghai Noon"; his Aryan poster child, Hansel, exudes the 
right amount of brash confidence and, well, head-smacking stupidity. 
Taylor is more poorly served by the script, which provides her with little 
personality beyond "beautiful crusading reporter". And Ferrell is amusing 
-- and, fortunately, not overused -- as the fiendish Mugatu. Not all the 
jokes work, but there are flashes of brilliance, such as Derek's indignant 
reaction to the unveiling of a miniature school for underprivileged 
youngsters. And even when it's less than successful, the sheer vitality 
Stiller brings to "Zoolander" helps distinguish it from similar fare.

Review for Chicken Run (2000)
Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park. Screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick,
from a story by Lord and Park. Starring Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson,
Miranda Richardson. Running time: 84 minutes. Rated G by the MFCB.
Reviewed on June 27th, 2000.
"Chicken Run" is the first full-length feature from Nick Park, creator of 
the popular "Wallace And Gromit" series of short films. Like those 
movies, "Chicken Run" is done entirely in the Claymation style of 
animation (albeit far more advanced than those old Rankin-Bass Christmas 
specials from the Sixties that crop up on TV every December), and 
features a primarily British cast and setting. The result is a lovely 
family film, one which is sure to have tremendous appeal for the children 
while keeping the grown-ups quietly amused, as well.
The Tweedy Chicken Farm is home to hundreds of imprisoned chickens. Some, 
like Bunty (Imelda Staunton), RAF veteran Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow) and 
dimwitted Babs (Jane Horrocks) seem to accept their situation. Others, 
like the feisty Ginger (Julia Sawalha from "Absolutely Fabulous") and 
scientific Mac (Lynn Ferguson) are determined to escape. To this end, 
they devise numerous schemes of sometimes mindboggling complexity -- but 
every time, they meet with failure and are nabbed by the oafish Mr Tweedy 
(Tony Haygarth). Observes Ginger, it's not enough that just one or two 
chickens escape -- she wants everyone to be free of the Tweedys.
Then one day, Rocky Rhodes (Mel Gibson), a smooth-talking flying rooster 
from America, lands in the chicken coop with an injured wing. He claims 
he can teach the chickens to fly, igniting Ginger's hopes and dreams one 
more time. But the chickens' mission is given new urgency when 
profit-minded Mrs Tweedy (Miranda Richardson), tired of making 
chickenfeed (excuse the pun) selling eggs, purchases a fearsome new 
pie-making machine. "Chickens go in, pies come out," she declares. 
"Oooh," says Mr Tweedy, "what kind of pies?"
Visually, "Chicken Run" is a treat. It doesn't possess the same kind of 
awe-inspiring cinematography as the summer's previous kid-oriented 
picture, "Dinosaur", but rather allows the viewer to feast upon the 
details of its every frame. There's a lot going on in each scene of 
"Chicken Run", and I was particularly impressed by how so many of the 
Claymation puppets were given distinct mannerisms, like Babs' constant 
knitting. Claymation is a very different, more tactile style of animation 
than hand-drawn or computerised cartoons, giving the events an extra 
layer of reality, no matter how outlandish the goings-on.
This is particularly effective in scenes like one where Rocky and Ginger 
are trapped in the bowels of the pie machine. The dangers are still 
comical but they feel more real, and the entire voyage through the 
contraption is all the more fascinating because of it. Nowhere is this 
more true than in the movie's outstanding climax, a more thrilling and 
inventive ending than most films so far this year. You'll believe a 
chicken can fly... as it were.
The voicework is generally accomplished, particularly amongst the British 
cast: Mel Gibson does a fine job as Rocky, but he's clearly just playing 
a skewed version of his own public image here. The other artistes give 
their characters more personality, and as a result chickens like Ginger 
and Fowler come across as better-rounded individuals. Indeed, the animals 
of "Chicken Run" are by and large more interesting than the humans in most 
other movies this summer! Richardson, meanwhile, finds just the right 
note as the fiendish but not too-exaggerated Mrs Tweedy. And Horrocks is 
perhaps best of all as the simple-minded, put-upon Mr Tweedy, who is the 
only one aware that the chickens are plotting an escape ("The chickens -- 
they've organised!" he protests to his disbelieving wife).
As a comedy, "Chicken Run" is funny, but I suspect children will get more 
laughs out of it than adults. Certainly, I found the movie made me just 
smile more often than outright guffaw. That said, there are definitely 
elements intended for both age groups, and the screenplay by Karey 
Kirkpatrick slips in several references which only the grown-ups will get
-- the chickens meet in Hut 17, for example, a sly reference to the World 
War II internment movie "Stalag 17", starring William Holden. Viewers 
should particularly keep an eye out for the cleverly-named Nick and 
Fetcher (Timothy Spall from "Topsy-Turvy" and Phil Daniels), two rats who 
supply the chickens with merchandise -- for a price. This pair forms a 
hilarious double act, and steal virtually every scene they're in. Be sure 
to stick around for their post-credits conversation.
"Chicken Run" avoids the pitfall of many kids' movies by not being 
particularly preachy or heavy-handed in getting its message across. 
There's a lot of good stuff here, about teamwork and never giving up, but 
Kirkpatrick doesn't belabor the point. He trusts that his audience is 
intelligent enough to figure these things out for themselves; I wish 
other movies had this kind of faith.
Parents will also be glad to learn that, content-wise, "Chicken Run" 
should be suitable for just about any age. There are scenes of suspense 
(like the aforementioned journey through the pie machine), but these are 
tempered with a lot of humor and shouldn't prove notably frightening. 
Even scenes depicting the stark reality of the chicken farm -- a chicken 
who can no longer lay eggs is beheaded and cooked for dinner by the 
Tweedys, for instance -- are handled in a careful manner that gets 
the idea across without being unnecessarily traumatising.
"Chicken Run" is just what the box office needed amongst the tidal wave of 
big-budget summer actions flicks: a good-natured, funny movie that pretty 
much anyone can enjoy. Well-written, well-acted and certainly well-made, 
"Chicken Run" may by the best family movie this year.

Title
Review for Moulin Rouge! (2001)
Directed by Baz Luhrmann. Screenplay by Luhrmann and Craug Pearce.
Starring Nicole Kidman, Ewen McGregor, Richard Roxburgh. Running time: 128
minutes. Rated PG for mature theme by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 27th, 
2001.
Synopsis: In 1899, young playwright Christian (McGregor) travels to Paris 
where he befriends Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo) and visits the Moulin 
Rouge, the infamous nightclub-turned-theatre run by Harold Zidler (Jim 
Broadbent). There, Christian falls in love with dancer and would-be 
actress Satine (Kidman), and must compete for her affections with the 
Moulin Rouge's odious benefactor, the Duke of Monroth (Roxburgh). It soon 
becomes evident that Christian's masterpiece will determine not only his 
future with Satine, but also the fate of the Moulin Rouge itself.
Review: Amazing! Astounding! A breath of fresh air! "Moulin Rouge!" is all 
this and more. Audiences may find its opening moments hard to process; its 
hyperkinetic pacing and raucous visual style is a vast departure from the 
mainstream. But most viewers should be able to attune themselves to 
Luhrmann's offbeat filmmaking before too long; those who expend the effort 
will find themselves plunged into a superior cinematic experience that 
makes it all worthwhile. Combining visual effects, model work, live action 
and any number of inventive camera angles and motions, Luhrmann gives 
"Moulin Rouge!" a distinctive appearance which nicely evokes the movie's 
setting of 1899 Paris and the "Bohemian Revolution". And though it may 
seem almost contradictory, Luhrmann's use of modern music -- everything 
from "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" to "My Song" -- merely enhances 
the atmosphere (Broadbent's uproarious rendition of "Like A Virgin" is 
especially noteworthy). The performers hit all the right notes, especially 
McGregor, who achieves a nice mix of optimism and desperation. But 
ironically, so spoiled are we by the first half of "Moulin Rouge!" that 
when things calm down a bit and drift into more traditional melodrama 
thereafter, it comes as a disappointment. Still, "Moulin Rouge!" is an 
assault on the eyes and ears of rare truculence, and rarer pleasure.

Title
Review for Law of Enclosures, The (2000)
Directed by John Greyson. Screenplay by Greyson, based on the novel by
Dale Peck. Starring Sarah Polley, Brendan Fletcher, Diane Ladd. Running
time: 111 minutes. Rated AA for mature subject matter by the MFCB.
Reviewed on September 14th, 2001.
Synopsis: Sarnia, Ontario, 1991. Beatrice (Polley) and Henry (Fletcher) 
are a young couple newly fallen in love. Sarnia, Ontario, 1991. Bea (Ladd) 
and Hank (Sean McCann) are an older married couple, bitter and cold and 
full of loathing for each other. As the Gulf War rages in the background, 
we explore how Beatrice and Henry become Bea and Hank; and we witness the 
final effort of Bea and Hank to recover their beginnings as Beatrice and 
Henry.
Review: Initially slow and ponderous, "The Law Of Enclosures" gradually, 
almost imperceptibly, draws you in. Its structure is unusual, the 
characters comprising two groups of people living contemporaneously. One 
set is young and the other older, but apparently, impossibly, they are the 
same. The youthful group includes Beatrice, Henry, Myrah and Stanley; the 
elder consists of Bea, Hank, Myra and Stan. There's even a child 
Beatrice/Bea in a few scenes, also existing simultaneously. The point of 
this seemingly convoluted and heavily metaphorical set-up is to paint a 
cinematic palindrome: the dawn of Beatrice and Henry's relationship is 
mirrored by its twilight. Greyson includes several hints as to the nature 
of the movie; clocks get stuck, and numbers counted backward are a 
perennial feature. Also watch for reflected actions, particularly 
beautiful shots of lovemaking through a glazed window. The backdrop of the 
War, oil-rich Sarnia posing as a Western Kuwait and the relationship(s) as 
the arena of destruction, is effective but not overdone. Polley and 
Fletcher don't quite find the right note as Beatrice and Henry; they go 
through the motions of being in love, but it never quite feels genuine. 
Ladd and McCann, though, are spectacular, at first communicating a 
controlled animosity which beautifully transforms into something more.

Title
Review for Meet the Parents (2000)
Directed by Jay Roach. Screenplay by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, from
a story by Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke, based on an earlier
screenplay by Glienna and Clarke. Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller,
Teri Polo. Running time: 112 minutes. Rated PG for mild language by the
MFCB. Reviewed on October 23rd, 2000.
I started to get a sinking feeling about half an hour into "Meet The
Parents". I won't lie: it was a reasonably funny movie. There had already
been a number of amusing little set pieces -- like one where Ben Stiller
accidentally shatters an urn containing the remains of Robert De Niro's
mother and De Niro's beloved cat uses it as a litter box. There was just
one problem: I had already laughed at these scenes, two or three months
ago, when the previews came out.
Yes, "Meet The Parents" is yet another victim of its own publicity. In
between the various theatrical and television promos for the film, the ad
men seem to have successfully spoiled just about every joke in the movie.
Comedy relies on being unexpected; unless it's done exceedingly well, if
you can see a gag coming, your reaction to it is usually muted. And that's
the main problem with "Meet The Parents" -- the funny bits are either in
the trailers or are so blatantly telegraphed that they can be predicted
far in advance of the actual scene. (De Niro warns Stiller not to flush
the toilet in the bathroom adjoining his sleeping quarters; what are the
odds that, at some point, Stiller will forget and yet more chaos and
embarrassment will result?)
The premise of "Meet The Parents" is straightforward, but has a lot of
potential as a comedy vehicle. The unfortunately-surnamed Greg Focker
(Stiller) is in love with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), but decides he needs to
seek her father's permission before he asks her to marry him. Pam's sister
Debbie (Nicole DeHuff) is to be wedded soon, providing the perfect
opportunity for Pam to bring Greg home to meet the parents. Unfortunately
for Greg, Pam's father Jack (De Niro) turns out to be an intimidating,
no-nonsense figure whose sole concern is for the best interests of his
daughter. He seems to be utterly immune to Greg's affable attempts to make
friends.
What follows is a mounting series of catastrophes, as Greg tries 
desperately to ingratiate himself to Jack. But Greg's initial little white
lies soon turn into wholesale deceptions, and other forces conspire to 
make Jack think that Greg is about as far removed from proper son-in-law
material as is humanly possible. Everything that could go wrong does --
Greg makes himself look like an ass in front of Pam's rich and
multi-talented ex-fiance (Owen Wilson), inadvertently sabotages Debbie's
wedding on several occasions, and so on -- and it soon appears that not
only Greg's engagement plans but indeed his whole relationship with Pam is
in danger.
Preview spoilage or not, "Meet The Parents" could have been a delightful
little romantic comedy in surer hands. I can easily picture Jimmy Stewart
in the Focker role -- or, better yet, Buster Keaton -- bumbling his way
from misadventure to misadventure. But Stiller, although a good comedian,
does not possess an enormous reserve of innate charisma. Actors like
Stewart and Keaton generate sympathy naturally, but Stiller has yet to
learn how to do this. Unfortunately, the screenplay by Jim Herzfeld and
John Hamburg seems to operate under the assumption that we will naturally
root for Greg, no matter how absurd or extreme his behaviour.
For my part, though, I never really responded to Stiller in this way. In
"There's Something About Mary", we could at least see that Stiller's Ted
was a nice guy who became caught up in an unfortunate set of 
circumstances. In "Meet The Parents", Stiller's character is defined only
in terms of his affection for Pam. Is he really the right guy for her?
Should Pam's parents be accepting of him? This is assumed to be the case,
but is never really justified. Indeed, based on Greg's antics throughout
much of the movie, I found myself siding with Jack -- I wouldn't want this
guy marrying my daughter either!
De Niro is "Meet The Parents'" saving grace. He has seemed awkward in
previous comedies -- "Analyze This" and "The Adventures Of Rocky & 
Bullwinkle" are two recent examples -- but here he has found a character 
that suits him to a tee. He is not parodying his own past roles (as in
both the films cited), but is instead crafting something new and
interesting in its own right. As Jack Byrnes, he hits all the right notes.
He is neither too soft nor obscenely tough, and finds just the desired
level of exaggeration to portray every beau's worst nightmare.
Director Jay Roach does an acceptable job, but lets things drag in spots,
a situation further compounded by the sheer repetitiveness of the
storyline. "Meet The Parents" would have benefitted from the same manic
energy Roach helped bring to the "Austin Powers" movies, but ends up as
too lackadaisical. Only a hilarious encounter between Greg and a flight
attendant (Kali Rocha) in the movie's latter stages -- one of the few
comedy bits not spoiled by any of the advertising I saw, it must be noted 
-- really embodies the kind of comic intensity missing from a vast
proportion of the running time.
"Meet The Parents" is not a bad movie, exactly, and will no doubt appeal
more to those who have avoided the trailers and therefore will encounter
its major set pieces for the first time. But even getting beyond that, it
is still an all-too-formulaic movie which seems designed more for the
video shelves than for the big screen. Still, "Meet The Parents" does 
finally demonstrate that Robert De Niro can be a good comedy actor. Now he
just needs to find the right movie in which to strut his stuff.

Title
Review for Space Cowboys (2000)
Directed by Clint Eastwood. Screenplay by Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner.
Starring Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner. Running time: 130
minutes. Rated PG for mild language and mature theme by the MFCB. Reviewed
on August 7th, 2000.
There's always a certain appeal to a movie which brings together a group
of favorite actors. Regardless of the quality of the plot, the direction,
or whatever, there's an undeniable charm to watching stars of the screen
interact -- and the more, the merrier. A lot of it, I suppose, stems from
sheer fanboyishness (or fangirlishness, as appropriate). It's the same
spirit that makes us laugh with glee at, say, the "Stalag 17" references
in "Chicken Run". But it's also an acknowledgment of the class and skill
these actors bring to their profession, and of the enormous potential that
their banding together seems to promise.
"Space Cowboys" is this kind of movie, its big gimmick being the union of
several of Hollywood's top retirement-age actors. Headlining the film are
Clint Eastwood (70 years old), James Garner (72), Donald Sutherland (65)
and Tommy Lee Jones (still practically a baby at 53), joined by James
Cromwell (60) and William Devane (59). Eastwood plays Frank Corvin, former
member of Team Daedalus, a group of Air Force pilots who, in the 1950s,
were designated as the first men to fly into space. Then NASA was formed
and claimed the space program for itself, and Team Daedalus was
permanently grounded. Forty years later, a Russian satellite malfunctions
and slowly begins to plunge Earthward. The guidance system on board is so
old that none of NASA's current crop of engineers can understand it, let
alone construct software to interact with it, so project engineer Sarah
Holland (Marcia Gay Harden) turns to its designer -- Frank -- for
assistance.
Frank will help NASA on one condition: that he and the rest of Team
Daedalus be on board the space shuttle sent into orbit to repair the
ailing satellite. Grudgingly, Sarah's boss Bob Gerson (Cromwell) -- an old
nemesis of Frank's -- agrees to the scheme ("You sent up Glenn!" argues
Corvin). So Frank begins tracking down his former mates, including "Tank"
Sullivan (Garner), now a fumbling Baptist minister; Jerry O'Nell 
(Sutherland), a roller coaster designer with inch-thick glasses; and
"Hawk" Hawkins (Jones), whom Frank blames for the dissolution of Team
Daedalus. But in order to succeed at their mission, the oldtimers must
confront ageism on the ground and, worse, a deadly Russian secret awaiting
them in space.
What "Space Cowboys" does right, most of all, is that it collects together
a group of actors who know what they're doing. Eastwood, Jones, Garner and
Sutherland have starred in their share of classics, and they have more
than a few duds between them as well. But they're all classy veterans, 
entertaining to watch regardless of the situation. There is a nice
chemistry between them which overcomes the relative paucity of their
actual characters. Indeed, more thought seems to have been given to Team
Daedalus as a group than to each of the individual members, who are 
painted only in broad strokes. Sutherland is the ladies' man. Jones is
the wise guy. Eastwood is... well, Clint Eastwood, basically. They are fun
to watch, certainly, but there's not a lot of meat on their old bones,
metaphorically speaking.
This lack of characterisation extends to the supporting cast as well.
Particularly poor is Loren Dean, who plays astronaut Ethan Vance as though
he's a high school jock rather than a professional scientist ("I have two
Masters degrees!" he squeals at one point). Vance and Cromwell's Gerson
exist purely as opponents for the Daedalus crew; they are defined only in
relation to how they complicate the heroes' lives. There is little 
motivation to their actions, and as a result -- when the rather 
predictable truth about the Russian satellite is revealed -- they come off
looking pretty inept. Harden, meanwhile, is strong in her early scenes,
but is mostly pushed toward the background in the second half. Her romance
with Jones' character feels contrived and lacks chemistry, seemingly
inserted only because the movie would otherwise lack a romantic subplot.
The screenplay, by Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner, starts off well enough
while the astronauts are still on the ground. Certainly, there are plenty
of laughs -- witness Jones taking a dim-witted teenager for a wild
airplane ride, for example. But the going is slow, and the whole thing 
plays out all too convenient. For instance, the oldtimers overcome a plot
by Gerson to keep them on the ground not through any action of their own,
but instead thanks to the fortuitous presence of a press photographer.
Things get both better and worse once the action finally moves into space.
Better, because we get to witness some beautiful special effects shots of
the astronauts in space. Perhaps inspired in part by "2001", these are
quiet and majestic; the scene where Frank spins around to watch the Earth
revolving beneath him is simply gorgeous. This is one case where the
movie's lackadaisical pacing is to its advantage. There is a real
sensation of the weightlessness and absolute silence of deep space.
Unfortunately, the plot also becomes even more of a routine,
by-the-numbers exercise, coming across like a sort of dumbed-down "Apollo
13" (I was tempted to say "Armageddon", but nothing could be that dumb).
The ending is dull and cliched. There is no effort to provide a clever or
insightful conclusion to the character arc of the Daedalus teammembers;
instead, we just get another climax where it's up to the underdogs to save
the day.
Ultimately, "Space Cowboys" relies too much on the hook of seeing all 
these venerable actors together, as opposed to good old-fashioned 
storytelling and characterisation. Matters are not helped by director
Eastwood's pacing, which is more geriatric than the picture's stars. It
has its moments -- the middle third of the film is particularly delightful
-- and certainly exudes more charm in its first twenty minutes than in the
entire running time of most of today's teen flicks. But, like those early
efforts to reach Earth's orbit, "Space Cowboys" just never builds enough
momentum to work.

Title
Review for Small Time Crooks (2000)
Directed by Woody Allen. Screenplay by Allen. Starring Allen, Tracey
Ullman, Hugh Grant. Running time: 98 minutes. Rated PG for mild language
by the MFCB. Reviewed on June 20th, 2000.
At his best, Woody Allen's movies are a vehicle not just for amusing
social satire, but also for meaningful insight into our mundane lives.
When he's on his game, even the most seemingly inconsequential scenes
carry a weight and purpose of unseemly magnitude -- recall the lobster
incident from "Annie Hall" for example. But when Allen isn't in top form,
these seemingly inconsequential scenes are just... inconsequential. Sadly,
it is this latter category into which falls virtually the entirety of
"Small Time Crooks", Allen's thirtieth directorial outing. "Small Time
Crooks" is a trifle of a film, offering just enough classic Allen to leave
the viewer wondering how good a picture this could have been.
Ray Winkler is, you guessed it, a small time crook. He's never been
particularly successful at the job but has an inflated sense of his own
skills. During the two years he spent in jail for a failed heist, the
other inmates sarcastically nicknamed him "The Brain". Ray took it as a
compliment. Ray and his even dumber ex-con pals Denny (Michael Rapaport)
and Tommy (Tony Darrow) devise a plan to rob a bank, by renting a nearby
pizza parlor and tunneling from the basement straight into the vault. Soon
they embroil others in their scheme, including arsonist Benny (Jon
Lovitz), who used to be a fellow inmate of Ray's and has beaten him to
the punch by leasing the pizza place first (his original plan was to burn
it down -- he tells Ray he put his kids through college that way); Ray's
wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), a former exotic dancer who reluctantly
agrees to act as the front for the operation by selling cookies; and
Frenchy's dimwitted cousin May (Elaine May).
But nothing goes according to plan. Ray and his accomplices find
themselves digging into everything but the bank, while Frenchy's cookies
are an astounding success. In weeks, customers are lined up down the block
and camera crews are paying the store a visit. Frenchy's cookie business
grows into a multimillionaire dollar snack food empire, and the Winklers
are rich -- legitimately. But while Frenchy embraces her new social
status, Ray still prefers spending his time playing poker and watching old
gangster films. When Frenchy meets David (Hugh Grant), an ambitious art
dealer who promises to enrich her culturally-starved life, it may mean the
end of the Winklers' marriage.
"Small Time Crooks" starts well. The opening third of the film -- the 
abortive bank job and the initial success of Frenchy's cookie store -- 
boasts a number of very funny moments. Much of this is due to the
excellent ensemble cast Allen has assembled, who are obviously having a
lot of fun. Consider Rapaport's Denny, for instance, who is put in charge
of promotion for Frenchy's blossoming business. In one scene, he is
interviewed by a reporter who wants him to explain his thinking behind
placing advertisements for the cookies in magazines like "Playboy" and
"Hustler". In a perfect deadpan, Denny explains that if men are looking at
the pictures and salivating, and then turn the page to see an ad for
Frenchy's cookies, maybe they'll think it's the cookies that are
making them salivate, and then they'll want some.
Indeed, the entire sequence of the boys' misadventures as they try to dig
their tunnel is very witty, and the highlight of the film. But things go
off the rails after that. As "Small Time Crooks" shifts its focus to Ray
and Frenchy's social ascent and resulting marital strife, the laughs
become fewer and farther between. Much of the humor is obvious and stale,
like Ray's feeble attempts at small talk at a dinner party. To make
matters worse, the great supporting cast established during the first act
all but disappears, and Hugh Grant's David is just too dull and
transparent a character to make up for the loss.
Things pick up somewhat during the final half hour, but even this sequence 
-- as Ray tries to rob a priceless necklace with May's bumbling 
assistance -- is really just pure sitcom stuff. The big problem with 
"Small Time Crooks" (apart from the fact that outside of the first forty 
minutes, it just isn't very funny) is that there are no real surprises.
Sure, Allen throws in a couple of interesting plot twists and the opening 
set-up is rather dissembling, but thematically "Small Time Crooks" treads 
awfully familiar ground. Allen doesn't seem to have anything new to say
with his story of the Winklers' rapid climb up the social ladder. The 
characters' personal journeys and their ultimate mutual destination is 
obvious and predictable; the only mystery is exactly how they get there,
and it's a tepid one at best.
Allen's direction is typically competent, and occasionally inspired. 
There is one scene, for example, which subtly but effectively illustrates 
the difference in attitude between Ray and Frenchy once they've become 
rich. Having spent the night out pursuing separate activities, they both 
return to their apartment building at the same time. He's taken a cab; 
she, a limousine. But overall, "Small Time Crooks" is just too sedate and 
ordinary a story to give Allen much of a capacity for directorial flair.
Both leads give good performances, with the extroverted Ullman generally 
dominating over Allen. Indeed, Allen looks frankly worn out through much 
of the movie, though whether by accident or design I'm not entirely sure. 
I've already noted Rapaport's enjoyable performance. Also very good here 
is Lovitz, who manages to tone down his more annoying tendencies but is
sadly underutilised.
In the end, "Small Time Crooks" feels like a decent idea poorly executed. 
Neither as funny nor as observant as many Woody Allen films, it does not 
strike me as likely to appeal much to either his fans or the general 
moviegoing public. It has its moments, but ultimately "Small Time Crooks" 
is a small time movie.

Review for What Lies Beneath (2000)
Directed by Robert Zemeckis. Screenplay by Clark Gregg, from a story by
Sarah Kernochan and Gregg. Starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford,
Diana Scarwid. Running time: 129 minutes. Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed
on July 25th, 2000.
When I went to see "The Sixth Sense" for the first time last year, I was
dismayed by how much of the first two-thirds of the film was spoiled by
the trailer. The movie was obviously constructed with the assumption that
the viewer was unaware Haley Joel Osment's character could see dead
people. Otherwise, the entire opening act constituted a thinly-veiled
exercise in misdirection, and I have more respect for the picture than
to believe that. In the end, although I was very much entertained "The
Sixth Sense", I was left wondering how much more enthralled I would have
been had so much not been revealed to me in the promotional material.
A year later, and wouldn't you know that history has repeated itself.
This time, the offending party is the preview for "What Lies Beneath", the
new thriller starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford, and directed by
Robert Zemeckis ("Back To The Future", "Forrest Gump"). As
poorly-conceived as the trailer for "The Sixth Sense" was, its "What Lies
Beneath" counterpart is infinitely more risible. In this day and age of
inspired, creative marketing strategies like the "Blair Witch Project"
website and the "X-Men" political campaign, it amazes me that we are
still forced to endure such hamfisted efforts as this one.
However, I refuse to review "What Lies Beneath" on the basis of its
trailer alone (although I am rather appalled that Zemeckis has actually
condoned it because, essentially, he doesn't think people will see his
movie without knowing the plot beforehand). It is true to say that my
enjoyment of the film was hampered because I had too much foreknowledge of
the events. But I will make every effort to set this aside, and review
"What Lies Beneath" on its own merits.
As the film opens, Norman Spencer (Ford) and his wife Claire (Pfeiffer)
are seeing their daughter off to college, leaving just the two of them
alone in their old lakeside Vermont cottage. Spencer is a genetics
professor who sometimes seems married more to his work than to his wife.
As a result, Claire is often left alone in the house. When neighbour
Warren Feur's wife Mary (Miranda Otto) goes missing after an argument,
strange things start happening. Doors open by themselves, electronics
misbehave, and Claire thinks she sees a face in the water. She becomes
convinced that Warren (James Remar) has murdered his wife, and that she is
now being haunted by Mary's ghost. Norman, however, thinks his wife is
going insane.
With "What Lies Beneath", Zemeckis is clearly trying to evoke Hitchcock. 
Most obviously, the entire subplot about the Feurs is a lift right out of
my own all-time favourite movie, "Rear Window", as Claire spies on the
neighbours through binoculars and finds disturbing but circumstantial
evidence of foul play. But here is one way the trailer helps to undermine
the picture (and if you haven't seen it, skip to the next paragraph now).
We know that the ghost isn't Mary Feur, so the entire sequence -- which
occupies most of the first half of the movie -- feels exactly like the
elaborate red herring that it is. As a result, I found myself impatiently
wanting the movie to just get on with it.
Zemeckis does successfully create a creepy atmosphere; there are plenty of
scares in "What Lies Beneath", and some of the effects (the face in the
water, a message in the condensation on a bathroom mirror) are understated
but work very well. The movie is cheapened, though, by the use of several
thriller cliches -- the sudden appearance of a family pet, the best friend
with coincidental occult inclinations, the killer who just won't die. Most
notably, Zemeckis badly overuses the device of having a character suddenly
appear in the frame. This was effective the first few times, but it got
rather silly when I lost track of the number of times it occurred.
Helping to foster the sinister atmosphere is a fine performance by
Pfeiffer, whose character is vulnerable and confused, but not weak. She
remains a captivating actor, able to communicate more with her eyes than
many performers can with their whole body. Pfeiffer is particularly good
in scenes where she becomes possessed by the ghost, seemlessly assuming
an persona without exaggerating the change.
Ford starts off weakly, mumbling his way through the early scenes, but 
finds his stride in the latter half. It is good to see the actor return to
roles with a bit of an edge to them, unlike the straight-laced,
do-no-wrong heroes he has portrayed for much of the past decade in films
like "Patriot Games" and "Air Force One". Ford was always at his best
playing characters with something of an anti-hero bent, like Han Solo or
"Blade Runner"'s Deckard, and to an extent, "What Lies Beneath" is
reminiscent of that.
"What Lies Beneath" rides a consistent upward curve, as the supernatural
events (or are they?) continue and Claire gets closer and closer to
uncovering the secret behind the apparitions. Things fall off the rails a
bit when the identity of the villain (which, I'll admit, came as a
surprise to me) is finally revealed and the film takes a plunge into
"Scream"-type slasher fare. Rather extreme measures are taken to demonise
the character (like a reference to the villain's attention focussing next
on Claire's daughter) which come across as more than a little
heavy-handed. But things end well with a spooky, beautifully photographed
climax which is carried out with just enough conviction to make it work.
Although it by no means achieves the heights of deep-rooted, psychological
terror as, say, "The Blair Witch Project", "What Lies Beneath" is very
successful on a more visceral level, and is certainly one of the scarier
movies of recent times. It's not the sort of film that will give you
nightmares -- the frights are too immediate and short-sighted for
that -- but it is a lot of fun all the same.

Title
Review for Planet of the Apes (2001)
Directed by Tim Burton. Screenplay by William Broyles Jr, Lawrence Konner,
and Mark D Rosenthal, based on the novel by Pierre Boulle. Starring Mark
Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth. Running time: 121 minutes. Rated
PG for frightening scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 15th, 2001.
Synopsis: In the near future, astronaut Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) is lost in 
an electrical storm in space, and crash lands on a planet where apes are 
the dominant lifeform. Davidson comes to believe that they key to his 
escape lies in the remote Forbidden Zone. Allying himself with a ragtag 
band of humans, as well as human-friendly ape Ari (Bonham Carter), 
Davidson tries to reach the Forbidden Zone while being pursued by the 
malevolent ape leader Thade (Roth).
Review: Tim Burton is well-known for lending his films a distinct visual 
flair; in concert with a good script, this often produces a genuinely 
memorable moviegoing experience (such as 1999's "Sleepy Hollow"). Sadly, 
Burton's "re-visioning" of "Planet Of The Apes" is long on appearances but 
short on anything else. This is little more than a by-the-numbers action 
flick with an inordinate amount of money thrown at it. "Apes" is wonderful 
to look at; as good as the make-up was in the original, Burton's team has 
done an even more spectacular job in bringing the title creatures to life 
for the modern version. And there is much promise in an exciting early 
scene in which Wahlberg is captured by apes employing tactics that feel 
genuinely simian. But afterward, the picture degenerates into a standard 
chase story; there's even an annoying kid sidekick to complicate matters. 
The revelations which occur in the Forbidden Zone are likely to surprise 
very few, and a literal deus ex machina strains the bounds of coincidence 
much too far. Burton's biggest problem, though, is that he creates few 
characters of interest: Wahlberg is bland and unengaging, the villains are 
stereotypes, the other humans mere ciphers. Even Bonham Carter's unusual 
(and sometimes disconcerting) Ari simply services the plot. A pointless, 
tacked-on twist ending cements the banality of the whole exercise.

Review for Scary Movie 2 (2001)
Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. Screenplay by Shawn Wayans, Marlon
Wayans, Alyson Fouse, Greg Grabianski, Dave Polsky, Michael Anthony
Snowden, and Craig Wayans, based on characters created by Shawn Wayans,
Marlon Wayans, Buddy Johnson, Phil Beauman, Jason Friedberg, and Aaron
Seltzer. Starring Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans. Running time:
100 minutes. Rated AA for sexual content and coarse language by the MFCB.
Reviewed on August 22nd, 2001.
Synopsis: An unscrupulous college professor (Tim Curry) cons several of 
his students -- many of them survivors (and otherwise) of the first "Scary 
Movie" -- into spending the night at "Hell House". Cindy (Faris) and 
friends have to contend with an angry ghost, a demonic cat, a disturbing 
caretaker, and cheezy parodies of everything from "Poltergeist" to "The 
Weakest Link"...
Review: "Scary Movie" may have been the climax of the gross-out comedy -- 
the last hilarious, disgusting hurrah of a genre which seems to have worn 
out its welcome on the big screen. "Scary Movie 2" is like an echo of its 
predecessor: not as funny nor as vomit-inducing, but still possessed of 
some of the qualities that made the original so entertaining. The main 
problem seems to be that it lacks confidence in the very subject material 
it's lampooning. Whereas the first installment wormed considerable mileage 
out of parodying slasher flicks like "Scream", the sequel goes after the 
older genre of the haunted house movie. And even though its main targets 
include such recent fare as the 1999 remake of "The Haunting", it seems 
the small army of scriptwriters were not convinced that their target 
audience of teen boys would be familiar with most examples of the genre. 
As a result, numerous unrelated jokes are haphazardly strewn throughout 
the proceedings, making "Scary Movie 2" feel disconnected and cobbled 
together, a loose panoply of brief set pieces that are knocked down as 
quickly as they're set up. There are still some funny bits (especially the 
opening "Exorcist" rip), but the picture consequently builds little 
momentum. The filmmakers should realise now that the well is dry, and keep 
to the promise made in the tagline for the first "Scary Movie": no sequel.

Title
Review for Hearts in Atlantis (2001)
Directed by Scott Hicks. Screenplay by William Goldman, based on the novel
by Stephen King. Starring Anthony Hopkins, Anton Yelchin, Mika Boorem.
Running time: 100 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on September 
24th, 2001.
Synopsis: Bobby Garfield (Yelchin) lives in a small town with his 
mirthless widowed mother (Hope Davis). Bobby's world revolves around his 
friends, especially the spritely Carol (Boorem). Then one day, a new 
boarder arrives at Bobby's house. Ted Brautigan (Hopkins) is an enigmatic 
man to whom Bobby takes an immediate liking. As the bond between Bobby and 
Ted deepens, Bobby becomes privy to Ted's great secret, an event which 
will change both of their lives forever.
Review: A small but enchanting movie, "Hearts In Atlantis" easily recalls 
another King-inspired coming-of-age film, "Stand By Me", both in terms of 
its setting and the sentiment it conveys. "Hearts" is a tribute to the 
magic of childhood, to those summers when the days seem neverending, and 
nothing means more than your closest friends. Unlike "Stand By Me", there 
is a supernatural element to "Hearts", but although it is key to the plot, 
it is not prominent. Like "Stand By Me", this is a mostly character-driven 
film, and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting. Yelchin is very 
good as Bobby, finding a good mix of innocence and resignation. More 
splendid still is Boorem, whom I praised highly for her work in "Along 
Came A Spider" and who is simply radiant here as Carol. And then there is 
Hopkins, who despite playing such a quiet, introspective character as Ted, 
nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen. Less 
successful is Davis, whose strident Elizabeth comes across as overly 
cartoonish. I also found it odd that Bobby and Carol's other friend, Sully 
(whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device), is 
paid virtually no attention. But Hicks' direction is lovely without being 
cloying, and despite the movie's general lack of incident, it never ceases 
to weave its spell over the audience.

Title
Review for Perfect Storm, The (2000)
Directed by Wolfgang Petersen. Screenplay by William D Wittliff, based on
the novel by Sebastian Junger. Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg,
John C Reilly. Running time: 129 minutes. Rated PG for mature theme by
the MFCB. Reviewed on July 19th, 2000.
Few movies in recent times have attracted as much interest in 
Newfoundland as "The Perfect Storm". Showings have been selling out 
regularly since opening day, attracting not only the core movie-going 
teen and young adult populations, but people of all ages. This comes as 
little surprise: for five hundred years, the fate of Newfoundlanders has 
been inextricably linked to the sea. Reports of maritime tragedies are 
not infrequent occurrences on local newscasts, and every Newfoundlander 
is deeply aware of how a poor fishing season can break individual 
fishermen and indeed whole communities.
The subject matter of "The Perfect Storm", then, is near and dear to the 
people of this province. Few films could strike more directly at the 
heart of our communal conscience. Although the Newfoundland economy has 
diversified in the past century -- gone are the days when almost everyone 
was a fisherman, or at least related to one -- tales of fierce storms on 
the Atlantic and loved ones lost in the pursuit of the almighty catch 
still ring true to many.
"The Perfect Storm" is like the mother of such stories: the culmination 
of all those tales of horror and tragedy, made all the more chilling (and 
fascinating) because it is based on real events. It is a fact that around 
Hallowe'en of 1991, three separate weather systems -- Hurricane Grace 
coming up out of the Bahamas, a rainstorm crossing westward across the 
ocean, and a cold front sweeping down from the Arctic -- collided in the 
vicinity of the Grand Banks, the vast fishing grounds off the coast of 
Atlantic Canada and New England. The result was one of the worst storms
ever recorded, and the swordboat "Andrea Gail", out of Gloucester,
Massachusetts, was caught in the middle of it.
"The Perfect Storm" dramatises these events. Billy Tyne (George Clooney), 
skipper of the "Andrea Gail", is a once-great captain fallen on hard 
times. His catch for the season is down badly from previous years. 
Determined to turn things around, Billy and his crew -- Murph (John C 
Reilly), Sully (William Fichtner), Bugsy (John Hawkes), Alfred Pierre 
(Allen Payne), and rookie Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) -- elect to make one more 
trip, all the way out to the bountiful Flemish Cap far to the east. 
There, they enjoy a tremendous catch, until their ice machine breaks down.
The crew is by this time aware of the bad weather lying between them and 
Gloucester, but not its severity. Faced with either waiting until the 
storm subsides (and letting their catch spoil) or punching through it, 
they decide to head home. But the first hints of the storm knock out the 
radio, and so Billy is oblivious to the warnings of a friendly rival 
(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), that he is heading right into the 
epicentre of a meteorological powderkeg.
"The Perfect Storm" does not get off to a good start. The first half of 
the film moves at a glacial pace, depicting the toll that fishing takes 
on the crewmembers' personal lives. The problem is that none of these 
characters are particularly interesting; the acting, while serviceable, 
is uniformly unremarkable. Though a certain amount of character-building 
is necessary in order to involve us emotionally in the picture, it is 
simply overdone. Too much time is spent developing these characters (and  
not in particularly imaginative ways) than can be justified by the 
relatively insignificant and melodramatic payoff at the end.
The movie is just marking time, until the storm hits the "Andrea Gail" 
and the action really begins. We are therefore forced to endure contrived 
animosity between Murph and Sully, present for no other reason than to 
generate some spark during the early tedium. It says something that the 
most engrossing sequences of the first half have nothing to do with the 
"Andrea Gail" at all, but rather with a small luxury yacht, the 
"Mistral", sailing for the Bahamas and so caught up in the storm earlier 
on. The rescue of the "Mistral"'s crew by a coast guard helicopter is 
genuine edge-of-the-seat material. Indeed, the entire subplot involving
the coast guard unit (which later tracks the "Andrea Gail") generates 
many of "The Perfect Storm"'s best and most heartfelt moments.
Once the "Andrea Gail" and the storm do collide, the intensity of the 
movie finally picks up, and I cannot deny that I enjoyed these scenes 
mightily. Watching Tyne and his crew struggle against nature was both an 
inspiring and heartrending experience: I was already well aware of their 
ultimate fate, but I admired their determination to get back to port. 
These scenes are also nicely counterpointed by tense, quiet glimpses of 
the fishermen's family and friends back in Gloucester, gathered at a 
local tavern and waiting desperately for news while the storm rages
outside.
Unfortunately, while the action in the second hour is undeniably 
riveting, it is marred by poor production values. The computer-generated 
images of the "Andrea Gail" riding the towering waves are certainly 
impressive. But they are also very artificial: the water moves like 
textured jelly, and the boat is lit and outlined in a very unrealistic 
manner. Also off-putting are some of the onboard scenes, especially those 
set after dark, which are clearly shot in a water tank -- it is hard to 
shake the impression that the "ocean" ends about five feet off screen.
Admittedly, the power of the second half of "The Perfect Storm" is almost 
enough to make me forget all this. Almost. Perhaps if I hadn't been 
lulled into such listlessness by the first half, I would have been more 
easily drawn into the fiction. But "The Perfect Storm" is desperately 
unbalanced. The filmmakers should have taken a cue from the title that 
the real star is not the fishermen, but the storm itself. "The Perfect 
Storm" is simply a good disaster movie, in the tradition of "Twister". An 
excellent drama could no doubt be made about the trials of Atlantic 
fishermen, but "The Perfect Storm" is not that movie.

Review for Requiem for a Dream (2000)
Directed by Darren Aronofsky. Screenplay by Hubert Selby Jr and Aronofsky,
based on the novel "Last Exit To Brooklyn" by Selby Jr. Starring Ellen 
Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly. Running time: 100 minutes. Rated R 
for controversial subject matter by the MFCB. Reviewed on February 18th, 
2001.
The hiss of a burner. The thrust of a needle injecting into the 
bloodstream. The dilation of a pupil as the drug takes effect. These are 
the images director Darren Aronofsky invokes over and over again in 
"Requiem For A Dream", one of the most remarkable, affecting and 
devastating movies in recent history. This is a film about drugs and the 
people who are hooked on them. But Aronofsky, not content merely to 
portray their debilitating influence on the lives of his characters, also 
uses brilliant cinematic trickery to draw the audience into the addict's 
frame of mind. "Requiem" is a trip in its own right -- disorienting and 
exhilarating and exhausting -- and that is perhaps most disturbing of all.
Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a twentysomething junkie with an 
ever-present need to get high. He's not the only one: his best friend 
Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) are 
addicts too. Harry even goes so far as to steal furniture from the home of 
his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) to sell to a pawnbroker for a few bucks. 
(In one notable early scene, Sara drops by shortly thereafter and buys 
back the furniture: this is evidently a routine that has been repeated 
many times.) Harry and Tyrone dream of graduating from buyers to dealers; 
for his part, Harry hopes to repay his mother for everything she's put up 
with over the years, and wants to fund Marion's dream of becoming a
fashion designer. But neither of them really appreciates the peril 
inherent in their line of work -- from rival sellers, from the law, and of 
course from the drugs themselves.
Sara, meanwhile, is a widow who has all but given up on the remaining 
years of her life. She spends her time eating junk food and watching 
television, or sitting in a lawn chair in front of her apartment building 
with other aging belles, gossiping and getting sunburnt. One day, Sara 
gets a phone call which leads her to believe that she will soon appear on 
her favourite programme, a bizarre combination of game show and self-help 
promo. Sara seizes on this as an excuse to lose weight and get back in 
shape, and on the advice of one of the other women visits a doctor who 
prescribes her a daily menu of diet pills. At first, everything goes well 
and the pounds seem to drop off. Soon, though, the prescribed dosage just 
doesn't seem to be working as well as it used to, so Sara doubles up... 
and doubles up again... and again...
"Requiem For A Dream" benefits from several outstanding performances, none 
of them more exceptional than Burstyn's. Hers is as courageous, as 
difficult a performance as they come: Burstyn assumes an already pitiable 
character and exposes herself to indignity piled upon indignity. Sara 
Goldfarb represents what I expect many people dread as they age. She is a 
woman who no longer lives her days but merely endures them, whose future 
seems destined to consist of nothing more than the same tedious routine. 
She has no prospects, nor the energy to manufacture them.
It is hard, then, to not feel a glimmer of hope for Sara when she believes 
she might appear on her game show. It's fairly obvious from the start that 
this is a hoax, but perhaps this is just what Sara needs to reinvigorate 
her life. It is, therefore, all the more horrifying and disturbing to 
witness her downward spiral into diet pill addiction. Instead of Sara 
being lifted out of her routine, that routine has simply been made more 
terrifying. For instance, the fridge is no longer a source of transient 
comfort, but is now a monstrous nightmare: Sara hallucinates it burbling 
nastily and lurching toward her. The second half of the movie, as Sara's
appearance crumbles while her days race by in an addiction-fueled blur, is 
as scary as a formula slasher films put together.
Also well-handled is Harry's story, even though these segments are 
somewhat less absorbing -- perhaps because Harry and his friends just 
aren't as sympathetic as Sara. Leto gives a solid performance, mixing a 
naive optimism with the obstinacy and resourcefulness necessary to 
maintain his lifestyle. Harry's real tragedy is that he believes he can 
use drugs to his own advantage, when in reality it is the drugs that are 
using him. For instance, consider how, near the end, Harry willfully 
ignores the deterioration of his own health because he refuses to accept 
anything that might come between him and his fix. Wayans (so far removed 
from "Scary Movie" so as to be virtually unrecognisable) and Connelly turn 
in laudable supporting performances, as addicts who meet their own dismal
fates.
As important to "Requiem" as its strong acting is Aronofsky's direction. 
He embraces his medium here, employing such devices as quick editing, 
enhanced sound, and unusual perspectives to portray the universe from the 
disjointed point of view of his characters. (In most hands, the sight of 
an angry refrigerator would appear preposterous; here, it is petrifying.) 
In one notable scene, Harry and Marion are in bed together. Aronofsky 
divides the screen in two, with one half focussing on Harry and the other 
on Marion. Despite the fact that we know they are lying next to each 
other, their influence is barely felt beyond the edges of the other's 
frame. In this way, Aronofsky effectively conveys how the couple is 
together, and yet vastly apart -- a facet of their relationship which 
becomes increasingly pronounced later in the film, when a shortage of 
drugs drives them to desperate recourses.
Perhaps most astonishingly, Aronofsky successfully tells his story in 
"Requiem" without ever seeming preachy. This is a film of brutal, awful 
reality, not just another "Afterschool Special"-type exercise, and is 
infinitely more effective as a result. Forget narcotics and 
pharmaceuticals: after viewing "Requiem For A Dream", you'll think twice 
before popping so much as a vitamin pill.

Title
Review for Chicken Run (2000)
Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park. Screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick,
from a story by Lord and Park. Starring Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson,
Miranda Richardson. Running time: 84 minutes. Rated G by the MFCB.
Reviewed on June 27th, 2000.
"Chicken Run" is the first full-length feature from Nick Park, creator of 
the popular "Wallace And Gromit" series of short films. Like those 
movies, "Chicken Run" is done entirely in the Claymation style of 
animation (albeit far more advanced than those old Rankin-Bass Christmas 
specials from the Sixties that crop up on TV every December), and 
features a primarily British cast and setting. The result is a lovely 
family film, one which is sure to have tremendous appeal for the children 
while keeping the grown-ups quietly amused, as well.
The Tweedy Chicken Farm is home to hundreds of imprisoned chickens. Some, 
like Bunty (Imelda Staunton), RAF veteran Fowler (Benjamin Whitrow) and 
dimwitted Babs (Jane Horrocks) seem to accept their situation. Others, 
like the feisty Ginger (Julia Sawalha from "Absolutely Fabulous") and 
scientific Mac (Lynn Ferguson) are determined to escape. To this end, 
they devise numerous schemes of sometimes mindboggling complexity -- but 
every time, they meet with failure and are nabbed by the oafish Mr Tweedy 
(Tony Haygarth). Observes Ginger, it's not enough that just one or two 
chickens escape -- she wants everyone to be free of the Tweedys.
Then one day, Rocky Rhodes (Mel Gibson), a smooth-talking flying rooster 
from America, lands in the chicken coop with an injured wing. He claims 
he can teach the chickens to fly, igniting Ginger's hopes and dreams one 
more time. But the chickens' mission is given new urgency when 
profit-minded Mrs Tweedy (Miranda Richardson), tired of making 
chickenfeed (excuse the pun) selling eggs, purchases a fearsome new 
pie-making machine. "Chickens go in, pies come out," she declares. 
"Oooh," says Mr Tweedy, "what kind of pies?"
Visually, "Chicken Run" is a treat. It doesn't possess the same kind of 
awe-inspiring cinematography as the summer's previous kid-oriented 
picture, "Dinosaur", but rather allows the viewer to feast upon the 
details of its every frame. There's a lot going on in each scene of 
"Chicken Run", and I was particularly impressed by how so many of the 
Claymation puppets were given distinct mannerisms, like Babs' constant 
knitting. Claymation is a very different, more tactile style of animation 
than hand-drawn or computerised cartoons, giving the events an extra 
layer of reality, no matter how outlandish the goings-on.
This is particularly effective in scenes like one where Rocky and Ginger 
are trapped in the bowels of the pie machine. The dangers are still 
comical but they feel more real, and the entire voyage through the 
contraption is all the more fascinating because of it. Nowhere is this 
more true than in the movie's outstanding climax, a more thrilling and 
inventive ending than most films so far this year. You'll believe a 
chicken can fly... as it were.
The voicework is generally accomplished, particularly amongst the British 
cast: Mel Gibson does a fine job as Rocky, but he's clearly just playing 
a skewed version of his own public image here. The other artistes give 
their characters more personality, and as a result chickens like Ginger 
and Fowler come across as better-rounded individuals. Indeed, the animals 
of "Chicken Run" are by and large more interesting than the humans in most 
other movies this summer! Richardson, meanwhile, finds just the right 
note as the fiendish but not too-exaggerated Mrs Tweedy. And Horrocks is 
perhaps best of all as the simple-minded, put-upon Mr Tweedy, who is the 
only one aware that the chickens are plotting an escape ("The chickens -- 
they've organised!" he protests to his disbelieving wife).
As a comedy, "Chicken Run" is funny, but I suspect children will get more 
laughs out of it than adults. Certainly, I found the movie made me just 
smile more often than outright guffaw. That said, there are definitely 
elements intended for both age groups, and the screenplay by Karey 
Kirkpatrick slips in several references which only the grown-ups will get
-- the chickens meet in Hut 17, for example, a sly reference to the World 
War II internment movie "Stalag 17", starring William Holden. Viewers 
should particularly keep an eye out for the cleverly-named Nick and 
Fetcher (Timothy Spall from "Topsy-Turvy" and Phil Daniels), two rats who 
supply the chickens with merchandise -- for a price. This pair forms a 
hilarious double act, and steal virtually every scene they're in. Be sure 
to stick around for their post-credits conversation.
"Chicken Run" avoids the pitfall of many kids' movies by not being 
particularly preachy or heavy-handed in getting its message across. 
There's a lot of good stuff here, about teamwork and never giving up, but 
Kirkpatrick doesn't belabor the point. He trusts that his audience is 
intelligent enough to figure these things out for themselves; I wish 
other movies had this kind of faith.
Parents will also be glad to learn that, content-wise, "Chicken Run" 
should be suitable for just about any age. There are scenes of suspense 
(like the aforementioned journey through the pie machine), but these are 
tempered with a lot of humor and shouldn't prove notably frightening. 
Even scenes depicting the stark reality of the chicken farm -- a chicken 
who can no longer lay eggs is beheaded and cooked for dinner by the 
Tweedys, for instance -- are handled in a careful manner that gets 
the idea across without being unnecessarily traumatising.
"Chicken Run" is just what the box office needed amongst the tidal wave of 
big-budget summer actions flicks: a good-natured, funny movie that pretty 
much anyone can enjoy. Well-written, well-acted and certainly well-made, 
"Chicken Run" may by the best family movie this year.

Title
Review for Memento (2000)
Directed by Christopher Nolan. Screenplay by Christopher Nolan, from a
story by Jonathan Nolan. Starring Guy Pierce, Joe Pantoliano, Carrie-Anne
Moss. Running time: 115 minutes. Rated AA for offensive language and
violent scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 26th, 2001.
Synopsis: Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is a former insurance investigator on 
the trail of the man who killed his wife. Leonard has only a few clues to 
the murderer's identity; to make matters worse, he suffers from a 
condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories, meaning that 
Leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier. Because 
of this, Leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself. 
"Memento" traces the investigation back in time from its apparent 
culmination.
Review: "Memento" is the sort of movie I wish I'd written; I can think of 
no higher praise than that. I am envious that Nolan has concocted such a 
brilliant, involved, original movie as this. An instant film noir classic, 
"Memento" is virtually flawless. The script is unlike any I have ever seen 
-- a notable achievement in these days of recycled Hollywood homogeneity. 
Although the idea of starting at the "conclusion" of the plotline and then 
moving backward in time to the "start" is not entirely new, never before 
have I witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence. "Memento" is 
endlessly exciting and inventive, a rare story which keeps the viewers 
guessing during the film itself, and mulling over its connotations long 
after leaving the theatre. And it is not merely an exercise in 
cerebrality; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to 
keep the proceedings lively. Nolan's direction is equally effective, never 
losing its crispness and clarity despite "Memento"'s challenging gimmick. 
And to top everything off, all the performances rise to the occasion. 
Pierce is terrific as the troubled Leonard; Moss shows great range as 
enigmatic Natalie; and Pantoliano's Teddy achieves a splendidly affable 
yet sinister quality. "Memento" may be the year's best screenplay, and is 
certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001.

Title
Review for Training Day (2001)
Directed by Antoine Fuqua. Screenplay by David Ayer. Starring Denzel
Washington, Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn. Running time: 122 minutes. Rated R
by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 15th, 2001.
Synopsis: Young policeman Jake Hoyt (Hawke) wants to join an elite 
narcotics task force run by Alonzo Harris (Washington). As a trial run, 
Hoyt accompanies Harris for a day, only to discover that Harris' tactics 
are scarcely better than those of the crooks themselves. As Hoyt descends 
farther into Harris' world, it soon appears that he will have to give 
himself over to his mentor's point of view -- or face the consequences.
Review: Despite its topical nature, "Training Day" is a movie likely to be 
remembered less for its storyline than for the performances which enrich 
it. Washington and Hawke are incredible to watch, crafting rich characters 
with little obvious effort. As Harris, Washington treads just close enough 
to outlandishness to be memorable, without losing his gritty real-world 
roots. He is a villain, but one borne of all the corrupt bureaucrats and 
civil servants which darken our places of power. Hawke, on the other hand, 
is comparatively naive, but not to the point of ludicrousness. Hoyt is 
appalled by Harris' actions, but is worldly enough to accept them and try 
to deal with them; the concept of a man like Harris is not completely 
beyond the bounds of his reality. To these proceedings, Fuqua brings a 
raw, snappy directorial style, favouring minimality over excess. When Hoyt 
is high on pot, Fuqua reflects this with little more than a sickly yellow 
haze onscreen, eschewing more flamboyant effects. Unfortunately, while 
Ayer's script is riveting at first, it goes somewhat off the rails in the 
final reel, burdened with a dubious chain of coincidences and an overblown 
Hollywood climax. Nonetheless, as a character drama and as a stark 
reminder that life on the urban streets -- be it as denizen or as cop -- 
is never black and white, "Training Day" is compelling.

Title
Review for Way of the Gun, The (2000)
Directed by Christopher McQuarrie from his screenplay. Starring Ryan
Phillippe, Benicio Del Toro, Juliette Lewis. Running time: 140 minutes.
Rated R for extreme violence by the MFCB. Reviewed on September 12th,
2000.
It would be easy to dismiss "The Way Of The Gun" as just another rip-off
of Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction". Indeed, it would also be quite easy
to praise it as a worthy successor, and reviewers have taken both
approaches. But the similarities between the two movies are superficial at
best, limited to their avant-garde approach to violence, mixing bloodshed
with clever dialogue. Whereas Tarantino's masterpiece was an essay in
absurdism -- contrasting discussions of European fast food with a brutal
mob hit, for example -- "The Way Of The Gun" is more a reinterpretation of
a genre than a subversion. "Way" is, at its most essential, a post-modern
western. The movie by which it is most inspired is not "Pulp Fiction" but
rather "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid".
"Way" and "Butch" share a number of similarities. Most obviously (if
somewhat obscurely for those not intimately familiar with the 1969
film) is the fact that the main characters in "The Way Of The Gun" go by
the names Mr Parker and Mr Longbaugh, the civilian identities of the Paul
Newman and Robert Redford characters in the earlier film. Both movies
feature likeable outlaws who give up their traditional way of life in
search of greater glory. "We stepped off the path," says Parker in "Way",
"and went looking for the fortune we knew was looking for us." In both
pictures, the main characters concoct ambitious plans which go
unexpectedly and appallingly awry. And the two films each portray the
passage of the western into new times: "Butch" was set at the sunset of
the Wild West era, "Way" depicts a western of modern times.
Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro) are drifters in
search of the big prize. While earning small change donating sperm, they
learn of a woman (Juliette Lewis) who is being paid one million dollars to
act as the surrogate mother for the baby of the wealthy Chidducks. They
decide to kidnap the woman and hold her for ransom. But what they do not
realise is that Chidduck (Scott Wilson) is a money launderer with 
nefarious ties. Soon they are being pursued by Chidduck's singleminded
bodyguards and his veteran bagman, Joe Sarno (James Caan).
"The Way Of The Gun" was written and directed by Chris McQuarrie.
That McQuarrie assumes both key creative roles is the movie's blessing and
its curse. McQuarrie clearly understands the intricacies of his story
intimately. This results in a number of wonderful scenes of delightful
originality, often railing against the cliches of the genre. Every crime
movie must have a car chase, for instance, and McQuarrie obliges. But when
the scene comes, it is not a typical reckless race down a busy city 
street. Instead, McQuarrie's take slows the spedometer down to just a few
miles an hour, and takes place not on a freeway but in labyrinthine
alleyways. It is less a chase than a cat-and-mouse game, and is a
marvellous slice of cinema.
It would be tempting, indeed, to label "The Way Of The Gun" as a "thinking
man"'s crime movie. This is true not so much because the plot is
particularly complicated -- it isn't, and what twists and turns McQuarrie
does throw at the viewer are mostly related to character rather than
incident -- but because the film is populated by thoughtful, 
well-conceived individuals none of whom feel as though they've been  
summoned up out of stock.
The best of these is probably James Caan's Sarno, a wise master of the
business who has learned to divorce business from personal time. At one
point, he confronts his prey (Longbaugh) in a bar, and the two spend the
night conversing about their shared trade. "The only thing you can
assume" about a man his age, Sarno tells Longbaugh, "is that he's a
survivor." McQuarrie's script is peppered with such gems.
McQuarrie also demonstrates that he is as capable a director as he is a
writer. There are some well-crafted shots in "The Way Of The Gun", such as
a slow pan from a crowd of Chidduck's subordinates, setting off in hunt of
Longbaugh and Parker, up to Chidduck's wife, watching from a window.
But, as indicated, McQuarrie's role as both scripter and director is a
mixed blessing. This is most evident in the pacing of the movie, which
feels sluggish from start to finish and is especially torpid in the middle
third, before the action moves to a Mexican hacienda and even more "Butch
Cassidy" comparisons are invited (whether this includes Parker and
Longbaugh sharing the fate of their namesakes is left for the reader to
discover). "The Way Of The Gun" is a movie desperately crying out for an
objective viewpoint amongst its creators, somebody to recognise the
strengths of McQuarrie's screenplay while cutting down on his excesses.
The result is a film that lacks momentum, that spends so long in transit
that it is easy to miss the pleasant stops along the way. This is not
helped by the fact that, apart from Caan, none of the other actors quite
manage to establish themselves in the movie (though Del Toro comes 
closest, and his scene with Caan is especially impressive). Phillippe and
Lewis, amongst others, are disappointingly inconsistent -- very good in
places, never less than okay, but often fading into the background. Dylan
Kussman, as a gynecologist with secrets of his own, feels as though he's
just stepped off the bus from the prep school.
The result is that "The Way Of The Gun" is wildly uneven. It possesses
some truly remarkable moments, but these are trapped in an undisciplined
concoction, like nuggets of gold peeking out from the mud. McQuarrie
clearly has all the tools needed to be both a fine writer and a fine
director, and I have little doubt that he will one day create a movie 
which showcases both disciplines at their best. "The Way Of The Gun"
demonstrates that that day isn't here quite yet.

Title
Review for Judy Berlin (1999)
Directed by Eric Mendelsohn from his screenplay. Starring Bob Dishy,
Madeline Kahn, Aaron Harnick. Running time: 93 minutes. Rated AA by the
MFCB. Reviewed on October 14th, 2000.
Eric Mendelsohn's "Judy Berlin" is a quiet, beautifully filmed drama about
the mundanity of the suburban lifestyle. Perhaps taking its cue from "The
Twilight Zone" (explicitly referenced) which often dealt with similar
themes, "Judy Berlin" examines the way people become trapped in their 
day-to-day life by interrupting their routine with the unexpected, and
depicting their reactions.
Set in the Long Island community of Babylon, "Judy Berlin" takes place on
a Tuesday in September. It is the second day of school. It is the day the
title character, an aspiring actress, is due to leave for California. It
is the day of a total solar eclipse. The principal of the local primary
school is Arthur Gold (Bob Dishy). His marriage to Alice (Madeline Kahn,
in her final film role) has long since exhausted its supply of affection,
and he is now engaged in vague, tentative flirtation with teacher Sue
Berlin (Barbara Barrie).
Meanwhile, Arthur and Alice's son David (Aaron Harnick) has returned home
from Hollywood, where he has been working as a director. David has given
up on life, and now endures an aimless existence, wandering the streets of
Babylon. He runs into Sue's daughter Judy (Edie Falco), who is leaving
town for Hollywood to break into movies. Acquaintances from their high
school days, David finds himself inviting Judy to lunch despite himself,
but his own experiences in the film industry threaten to taint Judy's
sunny outlook.
It may not be obvious at first just why the movie is named after Judy
Berlin. She is just one of several vital characters, and comes across as
more of a supporting player in David's personal drama than a central
protagonist on her own. But unlike all the other characters, Judy is
trying to break free of the prison that is Babylon. Her dreams may be
pleasant delusions (certainly, her acting abilities are more than a
little suspect), her future may well be awash in doubt and uncertainty,
but at least Judy is trying to craft her own future. The other principals
are trapped in the endless cycle of suburban life. Even David, who did
leave town once upon a time, never shed that mentality, and may indeed
subvert Judy's intentions with his cynical naysaying.
It is through Judy, and the eclipse, and a elderly retired teacher (Bette
Henritze) suffering from Alzheimer's that Mendelsohn gives his characters
a chance to break free of this cycle and, concurrently, illustrates just
how firmly ensconced in their routine they truly are. The story arc
involving Arthur and Sue is probably the best example of this: By the dim
light of the eclipse, Arthur finally decides to leave Alice and pursue a
relationship with Sue. But he is acting on pure, raw instinct -- "I don't
know what I'm doing," he confesses, and he could not be more truthful. 
Nothing in his life to date has prepared him for this deed; it is foreign
to him, no matter how much he desires it, and he fumbles through the
encounter like a child riding a bike for the first time.
Alice, meanwhile, undergoes an experience of self-revelation via the
eclipse. She is the only one who is really aware that it lasts an
unnaturally long time, and this is representative of the way she is slowly
becoming cognisant what is happening around here. She knows beyond a
shadow of a doubt that Arthur has left her and, moreover, she understands
why. Alice tries to comfort herself by making light of the strange
eclipse, pretending that she and her housekeeper are "space explorers",
but in a sense this is a very apt description. The experiences of the day
have led Alice into alien territory, a terrifying and foreign realisation
of life beyond the suburban routine.
Unfortunately, although there are many nice character moments in "Judy
Berlin", the movie never quite seems to come together; it is less than the
sum of its parts. Mendelsohn maintains a decent pace despite his quiet,
sometimes tedious subject matter, but a lot of the movie still feels
insubstantial. This stems largely from the fact that he has not chosen
particularly interesting characters; they serve their respective roles,
but most of them fail to really engage us in their struggles. There is
nothing distinctive enough to properly draw us in, and as a result, the
observations made about them carry less weight than they should.
Certainly, this is not the fault of the actors, who give generally
excellent performances. Dishy in particular is great to watch, finding a
nice range and perfectly expressing Arthur's deep, fundamental
confusion. Harnick is also commendable as David, believably portraying a
man utterly disinterested in himself and life in general. Kahn, who died
just three months after "Judy Berlin" debuted at the 1999 Toronto Film
Festival, has fun with her material, but also has an opportunity to 
demonstrate her sometimes overlooked dramatic skills (Alice's realisation
that Arthur has abandoned her is particular good). Of all the character
arcs, though, hers feels the least thought-out, and never really finds a
natural conclusion.
"Judy Berlin" is recorded entirely in black and white, and this is a
laudable decision by Mendelsohn. Not only does monochrome film accentuate
the surreality of Babylon under the eclipse, in the movie's early scenes
it also serves to hammer home the sheer mediocrity of suburban living.
In a way, though, this only emphasises the fact that "Judy Berlin" is more
an exercise of style than substance. It is lovely to watch, boasts very
good performers, and contains some good ideas. But the execution is less
than successful, as Mendelsohn never quite finds the proper vehicles
through which to express his themes. "Judy Berlin" is kind of like the old
cliche about Chinese food: enjoyable at the time, but afterward you're
left looking for more.

Review for Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, The (2000)
THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE (2000) / **
Directed by Des McAnuff. Screenplay by Ken Lonergan, based on characters
created by Jay Ward. Starring June Foray, Keith Scott, Piper Perabo.
Running time: 100 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on July 10th,
2000.
I can remember watching "The Bullwinkle Show" when I was young -- it was 
in syndication by then, of course -- but I can't really say that I was a
big fan. It's hard to recall, but I think I found the primitive animation
somewhat off-putting, and I don't think I really caught on to the brand of
humor espoused by series creator Jay Ward. And Rocky's voice really got on
my nerves.
Nearly two decades later, I find my reviewing the characters' first
feature-length film, "The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle". Not only are
the title creatures back, but so are their Pottsylvanian arch-nemeses
Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader. Oh, and the Narrator. Rocky's voice
still bugs me a little, but I guess I've learned to accept it over the
years. If only that was the sole problem I had with this movie!
Unfortunately, "Adventures" has far deeper flaws than this, most of them 
stemming from this simple fact: movies are not just television on a bigger
screen. Although superficially similar, the two media are very different.
Story ideas which work well as an eight-minute cartoon short are often not
quite as successful as a ninety-five-minute big-budget film. But that's
what "Adventures" amounts to -- a movie which just takes a stock TV
plot, dresses it up with cornball "Rocky & Bullwinkle" humor, and does
nothing more to justify its existence. About the only nod to this being a
movie and not a TV episode are cameo appearances by big name stars 
(including Janeane Garofalo, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg -- as Judge
Cameo, no less). But with the exception of John Goodman, who gets one good
line, these are all gratuitous and boring.
And it's a shame, because "Rocky & Bullwinkle" feels like it could have
been a much better movie. Certainly, it has moments of inspiration. Take
the opening scene, which is done in old-fashioned Ward animation style. We
revisit Frostbite Falls, home of Rocky and Bullwinkle. The town has been
stuck in reruns for the past thirty-five years (Bullwinkle gets a
residuals cheque for three-and-a-half cents) and the downtime has taken
its toll. Buildings have fallen into disrepair, the forest has been
clear-cut, and even the Narrator has been reduced to living with his
mother and narrating the events of his own dull life.
Within minutes, however, this inventive beginning gives way to scenes set
in the Real World, and "Adventures" never quite recovers. There is some
nice wordplay, and some lovely in-jokes (the medical facilities at 
Bullwinkle's alma mater, Wottsamotta U, are housed in "J" Ward). But it is
all trapped in a desperately routine plot, with obvious and prosaic 
moralising and -- most glaringly -- a lot of gags that just aren't funny.
Consider the riff on Robert De Niro's famous "Are you talkin' to me?"
scene from "Taxi Driver": it's so uncomfortably shoehorned into the movie
that watching him endure it made me cringe.
De Niro plays Fearless Leader who, along with Boris (Jason Alexander) and
Natasha (Rene Russo), has connived a way to escape into our world.
Fearless Leader has concocted a scheme to brainwash America using his own
cable network, RBTV (Really Bad Television). The FBI decides that the only
people who can stop the Pottsylvanians are Rocky and Bullwinkle (voiced by
June Foray, returning from the original cartoon, and Keith Scott), so they
send Agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) to find a way to extract the
animated duo from Frostbite Falls. Soon, the three heroes are en route to
New York City, with Boris and Natasha dogging their every step.
There are enough jokes about the many cliches littering "The Adventures Of 
Rocky & Bullwinkle" that I'm honestly not sure if the movie was written
this way on purpose, or if the jokes were added in afterward when the 
filmmakers realised that their script wasn't quite up to snuff. But 
recognising a problem and actually doing something about it are two
different things, and so although acknowledging some of the movie's less
logical developments (why are Boris, Natasha, and Fearless Leader "real"
but Rocky and Bullwinkle still animated?) results in some laughs, it 
doesn't make up for the movie's much larger problems.
Perhaps the biggest flaw is the character of Karen Sympathy. Newcomer
Perabo has a lot of charisma and does a pretty good job with the material
she's given, but the character's pairing with Rocky and Bullwinkle is
ill-advised at best. From her first appearance onward, there is no doubt
that Karen is a "Rocky & Bullwinkle" fangirl, and while the movie makes
some pretense of her trying to act gruff, the effort is thoroughly
transparent. As a result, the interaction between the three heroes is
mostly bland and uninteresting -- there is little conflict between them,
even of a good-natured variety. Things would have been a lot more dynamic
if Karen had been replaced with a genuinely tough-as-nails agent, like her
FBI superior (who does share a hilarious scene with Bullwinkle).
De Niro, Alexander and Russo do their cartoon-character impressions well,
albeit with little substance. Just count the minutes between Russo's
first appearance and her first line of dialogue not spoken in concert with
Alexander! Foray picks up where she left off with Rocky as if not a day
had passed, and Scott is an effective replacement for both Bullwinkle and
the Narrator (substituting for Bill Scott and William Conrad,
respectively).
But "The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle" is one of those movies that is
ill-conceived from beginning to end. Kids aren't likely to get a lot of
the jokes, and adults are bound to be bored silly by the storyline. It's
not a terrible film, and it's affable enough that I'm reluctant to give it
a failing grade, but you need to dig awfully hard to find the good stuff.
Sadly, this is yet another in a long line of TV-to-movie disappointments,
seemingly designed to leave you in your seat groaning, "Oh no, not again!"

Title
Review for American Psycho (2000)
Directed by Mary Harron. Screenplay by Harron and Guinevere Turner, from
the novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Starring Christian Bale, Chloe Sevigny,
Willem Dafoe. Running time: 102 minutes. Rated R for extreme violence and
graphic sexual content (MFCB). Reviewed on April 17th, 2000.
Few movies have engendered such controversy as "American Psycho". Not only
has there been concern over its violent and sexual content, but the 1991
Bret Easton Ellis novel upon which the film is based is notorious for
having been read by Karla Homolka, accomplice of convicted sex murderer
Paul Bernardo.
But those who have sought to censor "American Psycho" have done so with
little merit. This is not a movie about murder per se, and any intelligent
watching of the film should make that obvious. Does the lead character,
Patrick Bateman, kill people? Yes, and the implication is that many more
die off-screen. But this very fact -- that much of Bateman's crime spree
is referred to only in passing -- makes it clear that the movie is less
concerned about his deeds than about Bateman himself.
The killings themselves are alternately comical and dispassionate. There
is none of the frenzied bloodlust of "Natural Born Killers" (another
good film about murderers, but one that is very different in its approach
to the material). In one of the movie's best scenes, for instance, Bateman
is more concerned with keeping his clothes and apartment clean, and with
discussing the merits of Huey Lewis, than with the actual process of
murdering a colleague.
Instead, "American Psycho" works on two levels. First, and most obviously,
it is a character study of Patrick Bateman, a complex and difficult role
played splendidly by Christian Bale. And second, it serves as a scathing
indictment of the 1980s, of the shallow and materialistic values which
were the hallmark of that decade and which still play an all-too-important
role in Western society.
Patrick Bateman is a mid-level executive in his late twenties. His day
seems to consist mostly of "meetings" with other mid-level executives,
which essentially amount to contests of ego (we never actually see them
doing anything work-related). Bragging rights are determined by the
quality of their business cards and their ability to secure reservations
at chic restaurants. Several of them are engaged, but this seems purely
for show; they fool around on one another with only the barest of nods
toward secrecy. Certainly, Bateman's relationship with his own fiancee,
Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon), is cold and loveless. Indeed, Bateman and the
others are so similar that it almost feels as though they have been
churned out on an assembly line. Their slicked-back hairstyles, their
style of dress, their mode of speech -- all are virtually identical. A
running gag is made of the way Bateman is constantly mistaken for others
(he doesn't even bother to correct the error, and just plays along).
But unlike his confreres, Bateman has a secret: he is a murderer, who
has already killed as the movie opens and kills again, many times, over
the course of the picture. "American Psycho" does not concern itself with
the whys of Bateman's psychosis; it is more interested in his mentality
now that he has succumbed to his murderous impulses. Bateman, we learn,
thinks of himself as nothing but an empty, hollow shell, as conveyed
effectively by a number of visuals. Early on, Bateman removes a
transparent moisturizing face mask to reveal the same face underneath:
his flesh hides no further depths. Later, Bateman gazes into a polished
surface, but there is only the barest of reflections. "There is simply
nothing there," he says of himself. Indeed, Bateman does not have a line
of dialogue which is heartfelt or honest. When he does speak, it is simply
to maintain appearances, and it is as though he is regurgitating words
heard or read elsewhere; his favorite subject is popular music, but his
opinions feel lifted out of the latest "Rolling Stone".
Bateman is entirely self-absorbed, seeking to mold the world to his own
preferences without fully committing himself to that world. He instructs
his secretary, Jean (Chloe Sevigny), how to dress, and treats himself with
a litany of body-care products. Indeed, the murders he commits can be seen
as the ultimate extension of this thirst for control. In one telling
scene, Bateman engages in a three-way sex scene with two prostitutes, but
spends the whole time watching his own performance in the mirror; rather
than arousing, the proceedings are perfunctory and emotionless (making it
all the more strange that this was the scene ordered trimmed from the US
release by the MPAA; the Canadian version, fortunately, is unabridged).
"American Psycho" grows increasingly bizarre as the story unfolds. The
reality of the film seems to be influenced by Bateman's own grip on
sanity, and as his psychosis grows, the movie becomes more and more
surreal. Unusually, for a picture with such disturbing subject matter, 
this lends an air of comedy to the whole thing. Some viewers may find this
juxtaposition uncomfortable, but director Mary Harron reaches the right
balance, and the humor only serves to further augment Bateman's dementia.
Apart from Bale's standout performance, none of the other actors are
memorable, mired as they are in vacuous and superficial parts. Willem 
Dafoe occupies a particularly odd role, as a detective investigating one
of Bateman's killings. It seems fairly clear that he knows Bateman is the
murderer, and yet this particular subplot simply peters out. Indeed, some
may take issue with the way the movie as a whole just kind of stops,
rather than reaching some kind of definitive conclusion. But I find it 
hard to take issue with this technique; the movie is, above all else, a
character sketch, and once it has nothing new to say about Patrick
Bateman, it sensibly ends. What kind of ending could "American Psycho"
really have had, without it seeming superfluous?
"American Psycho" is an excellent character piece, marred only by a lack
of supporting material. The look it provides into the mind of a serial
killer is both chilling and sobering -- for, despite Patrick Bateman's
obvious and self-confessed insanity, how far removed is he really from the
rest of us?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to return some videos.

Title
Review for Dinosaur (2000)
Directed by Eric Leighton and Ralph Zondag. Screenplay by John Harrison
and Robert Nelson Jacobs, from a story by Thom Enriquez, Harrison, Jacobs
and Zondag, based on an earlier screenplay by Walon Green. Starring D.B.
Sweeney, Alfre Woodard, Max Casella. Running time: 83 minutes. Rated PG by
the MFCB. Reviewed on June 13th, 2000.
When a movie targeted at children tries to appeal to adults, it usually 
does so by offering an additional, more mature level of dialogue and
humor: material which will go unnoticed by the younger set but
will be appreciated by the grown-ups. There is some of this in "Dinosaur",
but not a lot. Instead, what will entertain the adults is pretty much
exactly what will entertain the kids: a visually spectacular production
which takes the art of computer animation to a whole new level.
I first became aware of the possibilities of computer graphics when I saw 
"Jurassic Park". I can still remember the thrill I felt at actually being 
able to watch dinosaurs walk, eat, attack, and interact with one another.
And while "Jurassic Park" is still pretty impressive -- certainly, seven 
years on it has not dated badly at all -- on a technical level, it has
been altogether surpassed by "Dinosaur". For here not only do we see the
reptiles as more of a presence in their environment than ever before, but
we are witness to a tremendous variety of the creatures, all acting as
though they were real, individual beings. One of the most incredible shots
in the whole picture sees the camera pan up over a rise to show a massive
caravan of dinosaurs, dozens of them representing many different species,
all galloping off into the distance.
And the success of "Dinosaur" lies not just in these bold, epic scenes 
but also in the details. Check out the way the wind blows realistically 
through the hair of the lemurs, for example, or how the sand breaks under 
the feet of the heavier dinosaurs. Granted, the animation is not perfect: 
the dinosaurs feel entirely too textured and clean, and many of the faces 
(especially the lemurs) still bear a hint of their cartoon ancestry. But 
these are minor gripes; "Dinosaur" is the sort of movie you can just sit 
back and watch for an hour and a half, and let your eyes feast.
Of course, there's a story too, although it's a relatively simple one. 
Aladar (DB Sweeney) is a dinosaur who has been raised by a family of 
lemurs after his stolen egg was dropped into their midst by a flying
creature one day. (Realistically, mammals were nowhere close to this level
of evolution prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs, but in this case
the science gaffe is forgivable, with the lemurs acting as more
accessible audience identification figure than most of the dinosaurs.)
Aladar leads a happy, if somewhat lonely, life with the lemurs on their
verdant island for many years.
Then one evening, a violent meteor shower rains down upon the land,
forcing Aladar to flee the island with as many of his family as he can
carry. (This sequence is a wonderful example of mixing beauty and horror;
the storm is initially very beautiful, burning across a purple evening
sky, and very gradually builds in intensity and fury.) The survivors
include misfit "love monkey" Zini (Max Casella), young Suri (Hayden
Panettiere), Aladar's "mother" Plio (Alfre Woodard), and lemur patriarch
Yar (Ossie Davis). Swimming to the mainland, Aladar and friends discover
it to be a burnt, barren wasteland in the aftermath of the meteor storm.
(It's not made clear if this shower is intended to be the one which would
eventually lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs.)
They soon come upon a huge pack of dinosaurs in search of the fabled
Nesting Grounds, a secluded valley paradise. The dinosaurs are led by the
draconian Kron (Samuel E Wright), whose sister Neera ("ER"'s Julianna
Margulies) quickly attracts Aladar's eye. Kron adheres strictly to the
law of the survival of the fittest, and is perfectly happy to let the
older dinosaurs, such as Aladar's new friends Eema (Della Reese) and
Baylene (Joan Plowright), perish if it means stronger, younger pack
members will live. The dinosaurs soon find themselves crossing a long
stretch of arid desert a la "Lawrence of Arabia", with the terrifying,
fang-mawed carnotaurs at their backs and only the faintest promise of
reaching the Nesting Grounds ahead.
"Dinosaur" is well-written, although the simplistic, straightforward 
script by John Harrison and Robert Nelson Jacobs leaves little doubt
about the intended audience. But there are some very amusing sequences
(after Zini's ill-considered attempt to get Neera to notice Aladar, she
quips, "That, children, is what we call a jerkosaurus"), and the story
proceeds at a reasonable pace which shouldn't allow tedium to set in for
adults or kids.
After an opening ten-minute sequence in which none of the animals actually
speak, it is initially rather jarring when the lemurs and Aladar begin
conversing. But this feeling of displacement quickly fades, and the
voicework is altogether competent. Much of the characterisation is fairly
shallow, however, so the artistes don't have a lot to do besides read
lines. Only Davis, as the gruff but lovable Yar, really stands out.
The movie benefits from some luxurious cinematography by David R
Hardberger and S Douglas Smith. Images of the sprawling grasslands and 
waves pounding the ocean cliffs are beautiful even without the presence of
the animated dinosaurs. Also helping to raise the bar is the glorious
score by James Newton Howard, which adds an epic feel to the events.
Most kids will enjoy "Dinosaur", and the content is generally quite 
appropriate. There are some nice lessons to be learned about the value of
teamwork and the importance of caring for the elderly, and the movie
doesn't get overly preachy. Parents of very young or sensitive children
should be warned that a handful of scenes are quite savage, however. The
destruction of the lemurs' island and the antics of the carnivorous
dinosaurs, like the ferocious carnotaurs, have the potential to be
nightmare fodder for some. For the most part, though, "Dinosaur" is a
rousing and delightful adventure, another success from the Disney stable
of animated films.

Title
Review for Legally Blonde (2001)
Directed by Robert Luketic. Screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten
Smith, based on the novel by Amanda Brown. Starring Reese Witherspoon,
Luke Wilson, Selma Blair. Running time: 98 minutes. Rated PG for mild
language by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 22nd, 2001.
Synopsis: Before heading off to Harvard Law School, wealthy Warner 
(Matthew Davis) breaks up with Valley girlfriend Elle (Witherspoon) 
because she doesn't fit his image of a future Senator's wife. Nonplussed, 
Elle enrolls at Harvard to win Warner back, only to find herself looked 
down upon by faculty and students alike. Determined to prove herself, Elle 
wins a role as an assistant on a defense team for a murder trial, 
alongside kindly eccentric Emmett (Wilson), Warner... and Warner's new 
fiancee, Vivian (Blair).
Review: Proving again that Reese Witherspoon is one of the best comedy 
actresses of her generation, "Legally Blonde" is a joy from start to 
finish. A simple fish-out-of-water story at heart, rarely has the genre 
been blessed with such wit and verve. Elle would seem ludicrous if she 
wasn't so well-acted; neither too ditzy nor too smart, Witherspoon finds a 
happy medium which never grates and is genuinely endearing. The script by 
Lutz and Smith succeeds on several levels. Not only is it hilarious from 
beginning to end, but the laughs derive naturally out of the given 
scenario; there are no extraneous, grafted-on hijinks here. And, most 
importantly, real pathos is generated for Elle; when she finds herself the 
butt of student jokes and professorial scorn, it is hard for viewers not 
to be reminded of occasions when we've felt like we're in something over 
our heads. If "Legally Blonde" has a flaw, it's that none of the 
supporting characters can compete with Elle: this really is a one woman 
show. Nonetheless, good performances are turned in by Blair as the
supercilious Vivian, and by Jennifer Coolidge as Elle's hapless beautician 
confidante, Paulette. Only Wilson's Emmett feels somewhat out of place, 
his role as plot catalyst proving rather too obvious. Regardless, "Legally 
Blonde" may be this summer's best non-animated comedy.

Title
Review for Divine Ryans, The (1999)
Directed by Stephen Reynolds. Screenplay by Wayne Johnston, based on his
novel. Starring Jordan Harvey, Robert Joy, Pete Postlethwaite. Running
time: 93 minutes. Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 29th, 2001.
Synopsis: Just days after young Draper Doyle Ryan's birthday surprise for
his father (Joy) goes mysteriously awry, the elder Ryan is dead. Draper
(Harvey) is haunted by nightmares, while his mother Linda (Wendel Meldrum)
must contend with her strict Catholic inlaws, who want Draper and his
sister raised in proper Ryan tradition. When Draper begins to experience
visions of his father's ghost, only Uncle Reg (Postlethwaite), the black
sheep of the Ryans, may be able to help him come to terms with his
father's death.
Review: Although set in Newfoundland, "The Divine Ryans" draws as much 
from the national passion for hockey as from anything specific to the 
Rock. As such, it should prove more accessible to mainstream audiences 
than many movies originating in this province. That's not to say that "The 
Divine Ryans" isn't a distinctively Newfoundland movie: Reynolds makes 
great use of St John's-area locations (mostly in the city's venerable 
Downtown core), and the humour and characters are unmistakable for anyone 
who has visited these shores. Like most major Newfoundland pictures, "The 
Divine Ryans" features familiar local faces, including Mary Walsh ("This 
Hour Has 22 Minutes"). But it is British import Postlethwaite who really 
steals the show, lighting up the screen as eccentric but kindly Uncle Reg. 
Harvey, in the pivotal role, offers a fine debut performance, though his 
inexperience is clear on occasion when he looks as though he's mostly 
reciting lines. Joy's role in the movie is too small, denying us a better 
glimpse of the relationship between Draper and his father which is key to 
the story. And though the production as a whole is accomplished, there are 
moments of letdown, such as the ludicrous realisation of the "Momataur" 
which haunts Draper's dreams. Still, "The Divine Ryans" is touching and 
funny, and distinguishes itself from more commonplace coming-of-age films.

Title
Review for Road to El Dorado, The (2000)
Directed by Bobo Bergeron, Will Finn and Don Paul. Screenplay by Ted
Elliott and Terry Rossio. Starring Kenneth Branagh, Kevin Kline, Rosie
Perez. Running time: 91 minutes. Rated PG for frightening scenes (MFCB).
Reviewed on April 13th, 2000.
"The Road To El Dorado" is perhaps one of the most inappropriately-titled
movies of the year. That's because DreamWorks' latest attempt to challenge
Disney's animation stranglehold isn't about the quest for the fabled City
of Gold so much as it is about what happens after the quest has succeeded.
This is a movie not about adventure, but rather about friendship and
sacrifice in the face of temptation.
Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) and Tulio (Kevin Kline) are con artists in
sixteenth century Spain. After acquiring a map to the legendary El Dorado
-- a City of Gold built by the gods themselves -- they inadvertently stow
away on board the ship carrying none other than the infamous conqueror
Cortes across the sea to South America. Escaping the boat with the help of
the faithful horse Altivo, Miguel and Tulio eventually run aground
somewhere in the New World. Following the map, they soon discover El 
Dorado itself, where they are hailed as gods.
Although the journey to El Dorado could easily have been the focus of the
movie, here it is essentially just forms the preliminaries. The movie
really gets going once Miguel and Tulio have reached the City of Gold,
whose citizens are divided in their loyalties between the jolly Chief
(Edward James Olmos) and the sinister High Priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand
Assante). The Chief is suspicious of Miguel and Tulio's divinity from the
start, but sees them as a harmless way to keep his people happy.
Tzekel-Kan, on the other hand, believes the arrival of the "gods" signals
the start of the Age of the Jaguar, a time of blood and human sacrifice
when he will rule the people through fear. And meanwhile, Cortes himself
has arrived in the New World, and has begun to follow Miguel and Tulio's
trail toward unsuspecting El Dorado.
"The Road To El Dorado" is certainly not the most ambitious animated film
of recent times. Storywise, it borrows from a number of other sources --
the "quest for the City of Gold", the "white men hailed as gods", and the
"evil high priest seeks power" subplots are all tried-and-true staples of
the genre. There is not much new here: even Tulio and Miguel's trick of
pretending to argue with one another in order to get themselves out of
trouble is a classic ploy. But it's all done with a healthy dose of humor,
and the pacing is such that the movie never really drags. If nothing else,
the relationship between Tulio and Miguel is well-developed. Although
there's never really any doubt how things are going to turn out, the
evolution of that relationship in the presence of temptations like gold,
godhood and girls (in the form Chela, an El Dorado native who becomes the
pair's partner in crime) is interesting to watch.
The real attraction of "The Road To El Dorado", of course, is its gorgeous
animation. Much of the film is illustrated in the half-realistic,
half-cartoonish style currently favored by Disney, but the movie is not
bound by this technique. For example, some portions (the creation of El
Dorado by the gods and an energetic feast segment) are drawn in the style
of Seventies-era cartoons, employing two-dimensional shapes, unusual color
choices and psychedelic imagery. There is also some gorgeous computer
animation, particularly during sequences set on water.
The voicework in general is capable but not spectacular, with the
best performances given by Kline and Rosie Perez, who plays Chela. Perez
in particular is important because she provides a much-needed female
perspective in the otherwise male-dominated picture. The music by Elton
John is largely forgettable, with the most interesting track being one of
the two end-credit songs, "Someday Out Of The Blue" (also the first single
airing on the radio). But it's a song that doesn't really have much at all
to do with the movie itself, and the rest of the tunes lack the punch of,
say, "Be Our Guest" or virtually anything from "Aladdin".
Although not a spectacular entry into the field of family films, "The Road
To El Dorado" is a movie which both children and their parents should find
enjoyable. It's got humor which appeals to both age groups, and although
the story is timeworn and simplistic, it's told with enough energy to keep
the audience interested for an hour and a half. Dreamworks might not be
challenging Disney with this release, but it's not doing too bad a job in
its own right.

Title
Review for Urban Legends: Final Cut (2000)
Directed by John Ottman. Screenplay by Paul Harris Boardman & Scott
Derrickson, based on characters created by Silvio Horta. Starring Jennifer
Morrison, Matthew Davis, Loretta Devine. Running time: 100 minutes. Rated
R by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 2nd, 2000.
Two years ago, the original "Urban Legend" was a surprise, proving to be
the most worthy of the litany of "Scream" rip-offs. Although by no means
classic cinema, it was entertaining and boasted an entertaining premise,
taking typical slasher-film shenanigans and dressing them up in the
context of popular urban legends. Aided by good performances and energetic
direction, "Urban Legend" turned out to be ideal popcorn fare.
Now comes the sequel of sorts, "Urban Legends: Final Cut". Instead of
being a continuation of the first movie, this one is intended to be more
of a thematic successor. Its events are inspired by the original, and only
two characters carry over. Most notable is security guard Reese (Loretta
Devine), now working at a university whose film students compete for the
prestigious and lucrative Hitchcock Prize. One night, Reese encounters Amy
Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison), who is casting about for a topic for her
thesis film. Reese tells her about the events she endured at Pendleton
in the original picture ("but that's just an urban legend," Amy protests
in one of the more clever lines of dialogue) and this inspires Amy to make
her own movie about a campus killer who bases his murders on urban 
myths. But as production gets under way, somebody seizes on the Pendleton
"legend" in a far more literal manner, and begins killing film students in
the same style.
Or, at least, that's what's supposed to be happening. But "Urban Legends"
is so ineptly written by Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson that
the central motif is virtually forgotten about, or treated more as a
crutch. Although Boardman and Derrickson go through the motions of
dressing their murders up in "urban legend" style, this is largely just
used as an irrelevant backdrop while the killings are carried out in
typical slasher style. There is a startling dearth of imagination here:
even the deaths, usually the high points of any movie of this genre, lack
invention.
There is a similar lethargy to many of the other plot points. Characters
are introduced who are so obviously intended to be potential suspects -- a
rival movie director, a mysterious twin brother, an eccentric movie
groupie -- that they deserve little flags. Having introduced such
characters, Boardman and Derrickson make little effort to heighten the
suspense by developing them further; they are pretty much just thrown
out there, and it is expected that the viewer will generate his own 
mystery trying to figure out which one actually did it. "Urban Legends",
though, is so thoroughly unengaging that there is no cause to contemplate
such things; there are far greater mysteries, like why a studio would
greenlight such a paltry, third-rate script.
"Urban Legends" has the feel almost of a serialised drama, with each
incident happening seemingly in isolation. Characters appear just so that
they can serve as the next victim. People die and are not mentioned again
for huge stretches of time. The movie evokes the sense of filmmakers going
through the motions -- murders and other scary incidents occur not because
the plot demands it, but just to fill time. This is moviemaking at its
most mechanical.
There is little in the way of characterisation to speak of, and few of
the castmembers engender any interest or sympathy. The revelation that
one character has a twin, for example, is completely defused by the fact
that we knew nothing about the character in the first place. Morrison
proves a poor successor to "Urban Legend's" spunky Alicia Witt -- not
because she doesn't try, but simply because she is given no material to
work with. Amy is a dull, monotonous character, and the filmmakers seem to
assume that we will empathise with her simply because she's the main
character, not because they have established her as somebody worthy of our
interest.
Amongst the other characters, Devine is downright embarrassing as Reese,
having apparently graduated from the "Police Academy" stable. Matthew
Davis, who plays twins Travis and Trevor, is aimless in either role.
Perhaps the biggest name actor, Joseph Lawrence (best known as the guy who
says 'woah!' on "Blossom"), is confined to a forgettable one-note part.
John Ottman's direction is unremarkable and drops the ball more than once
during action scenes, where the sequence of events is frequently confusing
and difficult to discern. Certainly, Ottman does little to cultivate an
atmosphere of suspense or terror. But then, there is precious little
mystery anywhere in "Urban Legends" -- a particularly galling fact given
that the film invokes such names as Hitchcock and Welles. It all comes to
a head with the revelation of the killer, which is done so off-handedly
and absurdly that I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop (it never
does).
Indeed, it was moments like this that made me wonder if "Urban Legends"
was perhaps intended to be more a satire of slasher films than just a
standard entry into the genre. But if that is the case, then it is a most
incompetent effort, totally failing to illuminate any truths about slasher
movies (except, perhaps, that they're all but exhausted) and instead
wallowing in their most dubious cliches.
"Urban Legends: Final Cut" is, quite simply, badly made. The direction is
hamfisted. The acting is without merit. The writing is on about the same
level as that roomful of typewriter-endowed chimpanzees. It is amusing
that the movie is set at a film school, because you have to wonder how
much time its creators actually spent at one.
The only positive thing that can be said about "Urban Legends" is that,
in the end, it could have been a lot worse. It is never actively
terrible; it is just incredibly lazy, inducing more a sense of ennui than
of critical revulsion. Nonetheless, it is yet another example of how the
teen slasher genre is in desperate need of either fresh ideas or a long
rest. Hopefully, this is indeed the 'final cut' for the "Urban Legend"
mini-franchise.

Review for Where the Heart Is (2000)
Directed by Matt Williams. Screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel,
based on the novel by Billie Letts. Starring Natalie Portman, Ashley
Judd, Stockard Channing. Running time: 122 minutes. Rated AA by the MFCB.
Reviewed on May 11th, 2000.
There are some movies which, on a purely aesthetic level, you know you 
shouldn't really enjoy, but which are blessed with such charm that you do 
anyway. "Where The Heart Is" is this kind of movie. Its storyline lacks 
creativity and is sometimes hard to swallow, its dialogue is for the most 
part only serviceable, its direction is fair but undistinguished. But its 
characterisation is fun and unusual, and the performances of its cast -- 
especially stars Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd -- are so endearing that 
it's hard not to leave the theatre with a grin on your face.
Novalee Nation (Portman) is a pregnant teenager who leaves her Oklahoma 
home to head to California with boyfriend and would-be country music star 
Willy Jack (Dylan Bruno). On the way, they stop at a Wal-Mart so that 
Novalee can use the washroom. She returns to the parking lot only to find 
that Willy Jack has abandoned her. Alone, penniless, and well into her 
third trimester, Novalee hides out in the Wal-Mart until her baby is 
born. In the meantime, she meets some of the locals, including a 
recovering alcoholic named Sister Husband (Stockard Channing) and Forney, 
the eccentric librarian (James Frain).
Finally, in an unexpectedly stark scene, Novalee gives birth. In the 
hospital, she befriends nurse Lexie Coop (Judd) who is also an unmarried 
mother, though in her case her brood numbers four (all named after candy 
bars). Acting on a suggestion to give her daughter a strong, meaningful 
name, Novalee calls her Americus. (You'll notice the movie's penchant for 
bizarre phenomenology; and I haven't mentioned other characters like 
Moses Whitecotten or Mr Sprock!)
The rest of "Where The Heart Is" tells the story of Novalee and her new 
friends as she comes to find her place in the world. Covering five years, 
the film alternates between good, solid character development and an 
unfortunate tendency to substitute incident for real characterisation. 
Some sequences are genuine and amusing, like the formative stages of 
Novalee's burgeoning career as a photographer, or her keeping accounting 
of every little thing she has borrowed from the Wal-Mart she makes her 
temporary home. But others are obvious and clumsy plot devices. One 
unlikely scene, for example, sees Novalee nearly being swept into a 
tornado, clinging to a slowly disintegrating staircase and trying to save 
Americus at the same time. (I kept expecting Helen Hunt or Bill Paxton to 
show up, myself.)
As a result, "Where The Heart Is" has a somewhat disjointed, episodic 
feel to it. To be fair, I do wonder if this may be partly a consequence 
of trying to condense Billie Letts' novel down to a two-hour screenplay. 
But in the end, I wished the movie had spent less time on glaring set 
pieces and played more often to its strength, which is the often unusual, 
sometimes unexpected, but always very human incidents which color our 
days. "Your life can change in a breath," Novalee tells Lexie at one 
point. But those changes are rarely major show pieces, and sometimes 
"Where The Heart Is" seems to forget that.
It is somewhat astonishing to realise that "Where The Heart Is" is 
Natalie Portman's first leading role. Less surprising, however, is that 
she handles the extra duties with typical aplomb, despite the fact that 
Novalee may be one of her more difficult assignments. Many of Portman's 
characters in the past have been preternaturally intelligent or mature: 
Queen Amidala in "The Phantom Menace", Ann August in "Anywhere But Here" 
and Marty in "Beautiful Girls" all spring to mind. Novalee, on the other 
hand, is a character who has not had the opportunity to cultivate her 
intelligence, nor who innately possesses considerable maturity. 
Consequently, she represents a different sort of challenge for Portman, 
who has to let Novalee slowly develop these characteristics over the 
course of the movie. In successfully doing so, Portman demonstrates once
again why she is one of Hollywood's most talented actresses. (Portman has 
reportedly decided against doing any more movies other than the next two 
"Star Wars" instalments until her undergraduate education is complete. 
With doubt, Hollywood's loss is academia's gain.)
Also superb is Ashley Judd as Lexie. It would have been easy to make  
Lexie just a slightly older version of Novalee, but Judd carves her own 
niche, bringing to the proceedings an infectious enthusiasm which belies 
her deeply troubled character. Lexie is the unlucky sort of woman who is 
always looking for Mr Right but only manages to find Mr Wrong. The end 
result is four kids (and more as the movie proceeds). Judd conveys the 
difficulty of her life while still maintaining a believable, indeed 
admirable, positive outlook. This makes Lexie particularly endearing, and 
the rollercoaster she endures as the film unfolds truly involving.
The supporting cast is also very good. Frain finds just the right note as 
Novalee's friend and would-be lover, neither under- nor over-indulging in 
his character's idiosyncrasies. Despite limited screen time, Bruno brings 
Willy Jack to life, wisely portraying him as immature and misguided 
rather than out-and-out rotten. Indeed, I found myself at times wishing 
Willy Jack's story had earned a little more of the spotlight; it would 
make a fascinating movie in its own right. Similarly underutilised is 
Joan Cusack as Willy Jack's tough-as-nails agent Ruth Meyers. Indeed, the 
only disappointing performance is from Channing, whose Sister Husband is
surprisingly bland and uninteresting.
Although it is certainly a flawed movie, I nonetheless find myself 
recommending "Where The Heart Is". It's not often a movie can succeed so 
totally on the basis of its characters, but that is the case here. Many 
will find the film's unlikely elements off-putting, and I am 
hard-pressed to disagree. But this is the kind of movie that is best 
watched with your brain in the "off" position. Its target is the 
audience's heart, and in this respect it hits a bulls-eye.

Title
Review for Mummy Returns, The (2001)
Directed by Stephen Sommers, from his screenplay. Starring Brendan Fraser,
Rachel Weisz, John Hannah. Running time: 129 minutes. Rated AA for violent
scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 28th, 2001.
Synopsis: Ten years after defeating the mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), 
Rick (Fraser) and Evie (Weisz) must confront the immortal Egyptian menace 
again when his servants kidnap their son, Alex (Freddie Boath). With the 
assistance of their old friends, including Evie's brother Jonathan 
(Hannah) and enigmatic Ardeth (Oded Fehr), Rick and Evie must stop Imhotep 
from seizing the power of the Scorpion King (The Rock), an ancient warrior 
who controls the armies of Anubis, god of the dead.
Review: Although "The Mummy Returns" is by no means a model for all future 
movie sequels to follow, it's an enjoyable enough rehash of "The Mummy", 
1999's surprise hit. Writer/director Sommers hews closely to the original, 
but manages to throw in enough new material to keep viewers interested. 
The whole thing still feels like "Indiana Jones"-lite, and moves even 
farther away from its horror roots, but "The Mummy Returns" is fun summer 
popcorn fare nonetheless. The returning cast slide back into their old 
roles comfortably, and there is even a nice usage of the Egyptian mythos 
surrounding the Mummy to flesh out the background of some of our heroes.
For younger viewers, "The Mummy Returns" includes Alex as a point of 
entry, and fortunately Boath is not too cutesy or annoying. The inclusion 
of a new threat unaligned with Imhotep, the Scorpion King, is inspired, 
making the movie's final stages less predictable than would normally be 
the case. Visual effects are splendid, with the notable exception of the 
poor computer animation of the Scorpion King, which stands out like a sore 
thumb. Sommers' screenplay does feel sketchier and less cohesive than the 
first outing, though, and suffers from some appalling dialogue. When one 
character makes reference to the "next" Armageddon, the audience is left 
to wonder how we could have possibly missed the first one.

Title
Review for Shadow of the Vampire (2000)
Directed by E Elias Merhige. Screenplay by Steven Katz. Starring John
Malkovich, Willem Dafoe, Cary Elwes. Running time: 90 minutes. Rated AA by
the MFCB. Reviewed on April 8th, 2001.
Though it may seem hard to believe, movies have now been around for more 
than a century. One of the interesting phenomena accompanying this 
venerability is that the dawn of film history has begun to pass into 
modern mythology; names like Valentino and Griffiths seem as ancient and 
as far removed from the present day as Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria. 
As a result, cinema's early years have become fair game for speculative 
fiction: stories that wonder "what if" things had been just a little 
different.
"Shadow Of The Vampire" is just such a movie, depicting the making of the 
1922 German classic "Nosferatu", one of the earliest and most renowned 
horror pictures. Although "Nosferatu" does not quite date from the start 
of the film era, its mystique was amplified when the estate of Bram Stoker 
successfully sued its makers, claiming (quite rightly) that "Nosferatu" 
was a thinly-veiled reworking of Stoker's seminal novel "Dracula". An
effort was then made to purge all extant prints of "Nosferatu", and while 
some copies have (fortunately) survived, it has helped give the movie a 
legend all its own.
Even without it, "Nosferatu" would still be an ideal subject for this kind 
of film. It is, after all, a vampire movie made in the very Eastern 
European locales where vampire myths first arose. It features a rivetting, 
convincing performance by Max Schreck as the bloodsucking Count Orlok (or 
Orlock, a spelling disparity given sly reference -- one I can only assume 
was intentional -- by the makers of "Shadow"). And so effective was the 
make-up transforming Schreck into the baleful Orlok that it stands up even 
by today's standards.
In "Shadow", then, writer Steven Katz asks the obvious question: what if 
Max Schreck really was a vampire -- or, more specifically, "a vampire 
playing an actor playing a vampire"?
To explore the notion, Katz focusses on director FW Murnau (played by John 
Malkovich), who is painted here as a zealous, almost fanatical artist. 
Katz's point is clear: the medium of film can be every bit as 
life-draining as a vampire, and the director's fangs are far more deadly 
than those of any creature of the night. Murnau stalks about his sets and 
locations, often clad in dark glasses, looking every bit as fearsome as 
his star. For Murnau, there is nothing more important than the realisation 
of his vision. He will take any measures necessary to ensure that 
"Nosferatu" is completed, even making a deal with the devil; and, for all 
intents and purposes, he has.
In the fictional reality of "Shadow Of The Vampire", Murnau has sought out 
a genuine vampire (Willem Dafoe) living in the wilds of Hungary. Murnau 
christens him "Max Schreck" and pretends he is an old acting acquaintance. 
He explains Schreck's idiosyncrasies and bizarre appearance by claiming 
that Schreck is a consummate performer who totally immerses himself in his 
role, to the extent of not even removing his "costume". Schreck, 
meanwhile, has his own motivations, and soon begins to prey upon the cast 
and crew of "Nosferatu", putting not just the production at risk, but also 
the lives of all those involved.
Malkovich is terrific as the obsessed Murnau, but it is Dafoe who steals 
the show. His realisation of the vampire is unforgettable, neatly 
capturing the essence of the real Schreck's performance and extending it 
naturally to flesh out a full character. Dafoe completely eschews the 
suave modern vampires of Anne Rice and Joss Whedon; his Schreck is barely 
removed from vermin, constantly clicking his enormous claws and thinking 
of little more than his hunger. It would be an oversight not to also 
mention the work of make-up designer Pauline Fowler and her team. They 
have done a phenomenal job recreating the original "Nosferatu" design and,
moreover, making Schreck seem like a real, (un)living creature.
Under the guidance of director E Elias Merhige, "Shadow" successfully 
transports us back to the 1920s. This is particularly evident in Merhige's 
use of clips from "Nosferatu" itself. Rather than contrasting with 
Merhige's own footage, this material fits into "Shadow" seamlessly. And 
while "Shadow" is ultimately a dark comedy, Merhige does not let this 
interfere with the fearful, oppressive atmosphere he crafts: the two 
aspects of the picture work together to impact the viewer instead of 
diminishing each other.
Consider, for example, a terrific sequence in which Schreck joins other 
crewmembers who are drinking around a fire. The crew, still believing that 
Schreck is merely an actor who has immersed himself in his vampire 
"character", asks his opinion of "Dracula". Schreck responds that he views 
the novel as a tragedy, and cites the seemingly innocuous scene where 
Dracula prepares his dining room for Harker's arrival. Schreck views this 
with sadness because he sees it as a reminder of all that Dracula (and, by 
extension, himself) has forgotten in the centuries since he lost his 
humanity. And then, if this weren't bizarre enough, he grabs a bat out of 
the air and feasts upon it. Should we laugh? Should we be frightened? 
Merhige successfully inspires both emotions, no mean feat to be sure.
It is unfortunate, then, that "Shadow" gradually loses its way as the 
movie progresses. Like a particularly grotesque "Saturday Night Live" 
sketch, Katz and Merhige seem to run out of ideas of where to take their 
premise next. As a result, the film's final reel feels distinctly 
fragmented, with ideas and new characters (such as Cary Elwes' 
cinematographer, introduced when Schreck feeds on his predecessor) coming 
seemingly at random.
The ending is particularly disappointing, its unrelenting savagery 
delivering a poor climax to an original and intelligent concept. It also 
represents a major deviation from established movie history. The best 
speculative fiction leaves us with the lingering suspicion that maybe, 
just maybe, such events really could have taken place. "Shadow Of The 
Vampire" just makes us glad that they didn't.

Title
Review for Finding Forrester (2000)
Directed by Gus Van Sant. Screenplay by Mike Rich. Starring Sean Connery,
Robert Brown, F Murray Abraham. Running time: 135 minutes. Rated PG for
mild language by the MFCB. Reviewed on January 20th, 2001.
Of all the possible choices of career or hobby, writing is hardly the most 
glorious. It is, in general, a solitary pursuit, the sort of thing on 
which a person can labour for days, months, even years, and have little to 
show for it (or, at least, little of true quality). Writers are usually 
invisible behind their work, and even when an author does have the 
opportunity to discuss his metier in public, the content of the questions 
rarely rises above the cliche of, "Where do you get your ideas?"
It is refreshing, then, to have experienced "Finding Forrester", a movie 
which is not only about an author (in fact, two of them), but which 
depicts both the joy which comes from writing and the tenacity it demands. 
It is about much more than that, of course -- it is a coming of age story, 
and a teacher/student story, and a story about fighting injustice. But 
whereas director Gus Van Sant's "Good Will Hunting" -- to which "Finding 
Forrester" bears both notable similarities and enormous differences -- was 
about a mathematics prodigy but could have chosen any number of other 
subjects for the title character's expertise, writing is a fundamental 
component of "Finding Forrester".
Jamal Wallace (Robert Brown) is a black teenager growing up in the Bronx. 
He's a smart kid, but in order to gain acceptance with his peers, he only 
does enough classwork to pull off a C average, and instead concentrates 
his skills on the basketball court. The only outlet he permits his mind is 
his writing, which he keeps secret. Then two events occur, almost 
simultaneously, which force Jamal to rethink the direction of his life. 
First, his top marks on standardised tests invite the interest of a 
prestigious private school, which offers him a full scholarship and a 
chance at a very different life. Second, a friendly dare prompts Jamal to 
sneak into the apartment of a reclusive old man known only as "the 
Window".
When the Window scares Jamal away, the boy accidentally leaves behind his 
journals, filled with the stories he wrote. When he retrieves the 
notebooks, Jamal discovers that the Window has included critical comments 
on every page. Eventually, Jamal convinces the old man to speak with him 
face to face, and it turns out that the Window is Robert Forrester (Sean 
Connery), a Pulitzer Prize winner who wrote "the great American novel" 
half a century ago and hasn't been seen or heard from since. Forrester 
reluctantly agrees to become Jamal's mentor, while Jamal tries to 
penetrate the mystery of what caused Forrester to abandon the outside 
world.
Much of "Finding Forrester"'s success is derived from the two central 
actors. Connery is back in fine form after a drought of good starring 
roles. He captures all the key elements of Forrester's personality: his 
eccentricity, his paranoia, his tragedy, his innate benevolence, and most 
importantly, his love of writing. Although this is a role that could 
easily have been taken to extremes by a lesser actor, Connery never 
indulges himself. Consider the scene where Forrester finally emerges from 
his apartment only to panic when he finds himself alone in the midst of a 
bustling crowd. Instead of playing up character's response, Connery keeps 
his reactions subdued; he makes us feel Forrester's anxiety, rather than 
forcing it down our throats.
Newcomer Brown proves to be a real find, his performance here at least as 
much of a breakout as Matt Damon's was in "Good Will Hunting". Brown 
brings an extremely natural feel to the film; I have no idea what his 
background actually is, but he certainly made me believe he had grown up 
in an environment not unlike Jamal's. Despite the fact that Connery has 
decades more acting experience, Brown is a good match for the veteran 
performer, holding his own in scenes of considerable emotion and power.
The screenplay by Mike Rich is a tremendous piece of work, an excellent 
example of how economy in writing leads to a better product. In between 
the lines of the central storyline about Jamal's relationship with 
Forrester, Rich slips in a number of secondary tales -- Jamal's efforts to 
fit in at the private school (epitomised by a not-so-friendly rivalry on 
the basketball court), his budding romance with rich white student Claire 
(Anna Paquin), his difficulty maintaining ties with his friends from his 
old high school, and his need to decide between writing and basketball as
his true passion. During the movie, I started to fear that some of these 
threads would go underdeveloped, only to discover as the credits rolled 
that this was by no means the case. Rich tells each aspect of the film in 
perfect measure, for the most part neither leaving his subplots stillborn 
nor dwelling on them any more than necessary.
It's not all perfect -- one major storyline, in which Jamal is accused of 
plagiarism by a jealous teacher (F Murray Abraham) who doesn't believe a 
basketball player from the Bronx could possess such talent, is a little 
too familiar. The way it plays out recalls the denouement of "Scent Of A 
Woman" and many other films; it's a surprising concession from an 
otherwise highly creative movie. Paquin's character also goes slightly 
astray in the picture's closing minutes, as the subplot about her and 
Jamal never really reaches fruition. It's as though one last scene between 
them was accidentally omitted from the final cut. This is a particular 
shame because Paquin, as usual, gives a bright and energetic performance.
But whatever the faults of the screenplay, they are minor, and more than 
compensated for by Van Sant's excellent direction. There is an unusual 
liveliness to "Finding Forrester", and this is particularly impressive 
given the static nature of the subject material. Van Sant gives 
Forrester's lessons a palpable verve. It's enough to make you wonder why 
all English teachers can't be this passionate, and why they aren't all 
this successful at communicating that passion to their pupils.

Review for Fantasia/2000 (1999)
Directed by James Algar, Gaetan Brizzi, Paul Brizzi, Hendel Butoy,
Francis Glebas, Eric Goldberg, Don Hahn and Pixote Hunt. Screenplay by
Hahn, Irene Mecchi and David Reynolds, with the segment "The Steadfast Tin
Soldier" inspired by the story by Hans Christian Andersen. Running time:
74 minutes. Rated G by the MFCB. Reviewed on June 23rd, 2000.
The original "Fantasia" was Walt Disney's great experiment. Having 
demonstrated that a feature-length animated film could be a commercial 
(and critical) success with "Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs", Disney's 
next project was a movie introducing children to classical music by 
marrying it to animation in a series of vignettes. Sadly, the idea proved
unpopular in 1940, and so Disney's even grander plans -- creating a new 
version every so often by replacing some of the older segments -- had to 
be shelved.
Until now. At Christmastime, Walt Disney Pictures released 
"Fantasia/2000" to IMAX theatres. Unfortunately, Newfoundland does not 
have an IMAX venue, but now the film has been released in 35mm for a 
four-week engagement. Despite the smaller stature, even this version of 
the movie is so visually splendid, and the music so compelling, that it 
is an experience no one should miss.
"Fantasia/2000" follows essentially the same format as its predecessor. 
The only major change is the use of a different contemporary star to 
introduce each piece. These cameos, directed by Don Hahn, are mostly 
filler, and I fear will date "Fantasia/2000" rather quickly. But some 
sequences -- particularly those featuring Steve Martin and James Earl 
Jones -- are amusing, and they are brief enough that they do not distract 
too much from the proceedings.
The introductory piece is Beethoven's "Symphony No. 5, Allegro con Brio", 
directed by Pixote Hunt, and the animation is an abstract work featuring 
butterfly-like triangles. There are some glorious moments here, 
particularly the sight of thousands of the triangles in flight, and the 
play of color throughout the sequence is dazzling.
Next up is what may be the best part of the movie, set to Respighi's 
"Pines Of Rome" and directed by Hendel Butoy. Butoy has opted to toy with 
our preconceptions and, instead of drawing inspiration from the 
composition's title, presents a visually enthralling depiction of a family 
of whales cavorting in the sea, a series of ice caverns, and finally 
above the clouds themselves. Scenes like one where the whales dive 
through a thundercloud are truly breathtaking, and I felt my heart 
soaring alongside the creatures.
Up third is another superb segment, directed by Eric Goldberg. The music 
is Gershwin's "Rhapsody In Blue", providing a more modern addition to the 
line-up. I'm glad the producers recognised the fact that "Fantasia/2000" 
is meant to be an evolving, experimental format, and did not feel 
confined to using only prototypically classical works. The style of 
animation here also stands out, inspired by the illustrations of Al 
Hirschfeld. Even the color scheme is different from conventional Disney 
fare, keying each character to a specific hue. The stories of four 
Depression-Era New Yorkers -- a budding musician, a young girl, a 
sheepish husband, and a guy looking for a job -- are interlaced, to 
humorous effect. Especially funny is the husband's impromptu jig with an 
organ grinder's monkey.
Butoy returns to helm the next portion of the film, setting Hans 
Christian Andersen's "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" to Shostakovich's "Piano 
Concerto No. 2". It tells the story of a one-legged miniature soldier who 
falls in love with a toy ballerina and defends her from a lecherous 
Jack-in-the-Box. This is a beautiful rendition of the tale, warmly 
animated as though lifted out of an old storybook. Particularly effective 
is the portrayal of the Jack-in-the-Box, brimming with malice.
A short piece follows, accompanying Saint-Saens' "Carnival Of The 
Animals". James Earl Jones deadpans the introduction perfectly, promising 
the segment will answer that eternal question, "What happens you give a 
yo-yo to a flock of flamingos? Who wrote this?" Hilarious hijinks ensue, 
animated in a suitably simple style.
Next is the lone resurrectee from the original "Fantasia", "The 
Sorcerer's Apprentice", directed by James Algar. This was always my 
favourite portion of the 1940 version ("Night On Bald Mountain" running a 
close second), and it was wonderful to see it on the big screen. The 
grainy sixty-year-old animation does suffer somewhat in comparison with
the rest of "Fantasia/2000", and the fact that it is in the original 
(non-widescreen) aspect ratio gives it an archaic look. But the sheer 
jollity and imagination of the story still win me over, and Dukas' 
"L'apprenti sorcier" is a gorgeous composition.
We move from one Disney character to another as Donald and Daisy Duck 
take center stage in a story set aboard Noah's Ark during the Great 
Flood. As with "Pines Of Rome", this is an unusual accompaniment for the 
music, Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance". But it works, because director 
Francis Glebas concocts a story both amusing and heartfelt. Unfortunately, 
the opportunity for some really fantastic animation inspired by the flood 
and the many animals is passed up, leaving us with a standard Disney short.
The final sequence, directed by Gaetan and Paul Brizzi, similarly 
disappoints by not taking full advantage of the medium. Set to 
Stravinsky's "Firebird Suite", it depicts the story of a nature sprite who 
awakens a fearsome volcano spirit while bringing spring to the land. 
Although a nice fable, it plays out too straightforwardly, and altogether 
fails to convey the natural beauty and primal majesty that the Brizzis 
seem to be aiming for.
Otherwise, my only real complaint about "Fantasia/2000" is that it is 
weighted too heavily toward narrative-style segments, eschewing the more 
conceptual pieces which animation often portrays so well. The commercial 
motivations behind this decision are obvious, but "Fantasia" should be 
all about challenging the viewer -- not just through its presentation of 
classical music and unusual animation styles, but also by introducing new 
ideas. Further, I question the choice to run the two pieces starring 
popular Disney characters back-to-back, as it somewhat unbalances the movie.
These minor gripes aside, though, "Fantasia/2000" is a worthy successor 
to the original, and a fantastic, visually- and aurally-spellbinding movie 
for all ages. Parents who don't take advantage of this all-too-brief 
opportunity and take their kids to see it in the theatre are cheating 
their children. And themselves, too.

Title
Review for Skulls, The (2000)
Directed by Rob Cohen. Screenplay by John Pogue. Starring Joshua Jackson,
Paul Walker, Craig T Nelson. Running time: 106 minutes. Rated AA (MFCB).
Reviewed on April 2nd, 2000.
I'd be hard-pressed to name a movie more average than "The Skulls".=20
Scripting, acting, direction -- none of them are bad, exactly, but none=20
of them manage to impress much, either. This is the sort of movie where,
if you're paying any sort of attention, you can easily predict the plot
twists (to use the term loosely) before the first five minutes are up...
and probably come up with better ones, too. "The Skulls" is utterly
lacking in spark or invention, barely enjoyable as a mindless popcorn
movie.
"The Skulls" is inspired by Skull and Bones, a real Yale "secret" society.
This movie, too, takes place at Yale, though in one of several bizarre
decisions by screenwriter John Pogue, the university is never named --
despite the abundance of the letter 'Y', the name of the school sports
team, and other signs which should make the setting obvious. Luke McNamara
(Joshua Jackson) is a "townie" who has built himself up from meagre roots.
Now he's a scholarship student and the star of the school rowing team, and
has attracted the attention of the Skulls.
Inducted into the secret society, Luke is paired with Caleb Mandrake=20
(Paul Walker); the two become "soulmates", intended to watch each other's=
=20
back. Caleb's father, Supreme Court hopeful Judge Litten Mandrake (Craig T
Nelson) is the chairman of the Skulls, but their relationship is strained
over Caleb's indecision about his future. At first, life as a Skull seems
grand: Luke is given money, a car, women. But his newfound status -- and
the all-pervasive secrecy of the Skulls -- begins to cause tension between
him and his best friends Will (Hill Harper) and Chloe (Leslie Bibb).
To make matters worse, Will is covertly working on an expose of the=20
Skulls. This leads to a confrontation with Caleb and Will's death, which
the Skulls make to look like a suicide. Luke decides to betray his
benefactors and tell the police what he knows, but soon discovers that the
Skulls' power truly is as far-reaching as they claim.
Despite starting from a promising premise, the script for "The Skulls"=20
leaves much to be desired. Having come up with the basis for the movie, it
appears Pogue was content to write the rest of it with his brain stuck in
neutral. Usually, a conspiracy film at least hands its audience a few
unexpected twists to keep the suspense high, but even that is lacking
here. There is a feeling of inevitability surrounding the proceedings, an
unfortunate sense that we've seen all this before -- and often done=20
better.
But the movie's biggest problem is its conception of the Skulls itself.
Although they are obviously supposed to appear powerful and fearsome
(right from the start, we're told three Presidents have been Skulls and
the CIA owes its origins to them), the members instead come across as a
bunch of squabbling, scheming incompetents. I find it difficult to believe
that a society could remain so secret and so successful for two centuries
with its membership stabbing one another in the back at every opportunity.
But wait, there's another problem: just how "secret" are the Skulls
anyhow? Everyone on campus has heard of them, which isn't surprising given
that they advertise with a bloody great symbol on the roof of their
building. The night they induct new recruits is common knowledge, and each
member has a skull branded into his arm for all to see. (The movie
dubiously has the recruits don wristwatches afterward, as if this will
cover up the brand forevermore.) Their videotape records are cleverly
hidden in a secret room behind a bookcase in the campus library, accessed
by moving a certain book. This would be a foolproof scheme, I guess, if it
hadn't also appeared in about two hundred episodes of "Scooby Doo". Even
the Skulls' attempt to cover up Will's death are hamfisted. He has smacked
his head off the floor, so they make it look as if he hanged himself;
wouldn't it be a lot more convincing to just throw him off a building?
One good thing about "The Skulls" is that, in addition to main star
Jackson, a very good, action-oriented role is provided for Bibb as well.=20
To feature a woman who isn't entirely helpless is a rarity enough for the
genre; to feature one whose deeds are so pivotal to the outcome is unusual
indeed. Although wooden in places, Bibb does a capable job in a=20
commendable role, and it is only unfortunate that her contribution does
not extend to the movie's lackluster climax.
Jackson, although not a prototypical action hero in appearance, isn't bad
here either. He does a good job of portraying Luke as a man torn between
two worlds: not just between the Skulls and his friends, but between his
"misspent youth" and current Ivy League life as well. Sadly, his and
Bibb's chemistry leaves something to be desired; a sex scene, for example,
feels token and unnatural.
The rest of the cast is less impressive. Walker is given a lot of
potential as Caleb, but doesn't really run with it, turning in a
performance that is passable at best. Harper is vapid, albeit in a
transparently scripted, purely functional role. William Petersen, as
Senator Ames Levritt (who may or may not be Luke's only ally in the
Skulls) appears to be doing his best Bill Clinton impersonation
throughout. And Craig T Nelson is hard to take seriously in a dull and
cliched part, especially given that he seems to have borrowed Patrick
Stewart's mustache from "Masterminds".
Given that it boasts an intriguing premise and a couple of good young
castmembers, "The Skulls" could have been much better. As it is, this is a
mostly forgettable exercise in the paucity of the creative process. The
teenage market, at which this film is obviously aimed, has endured movies
much worse than this one. But it deserves better than "The Skulls", too.

Title
Review for Kippur (2000)
Directed by Amos Gitai. Screenplay by Gitai and Marie-Jose Sanselme.
Starring Liron Levo, Tomer Russo, Uri Ran-Klausner. Running time: 124
minutes. This film is not yet rated by the MFCB. Reviewed on September 
30th, 2001.
Synopsis: On the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur in 1973, Egyptian and 
Syrian armies attacked Israel. "Kippur" follows two Israeli soldiers, 
Weinraub (Levo) and Ruso (Russo), who become separated from their unit in 
the confusion following the incursion. Rescuing a military doctor 
(Ran-Klausner) whose car has broken down, Weinraub and Ruso join his 
rescue-and-retrieval operation, trying to ferry out the wounded while 
death rains down all around them.
Review: "Kippur" is less a drama about war than a meditation on its 
effects. There are no great clashes between opposing armies, no scenes of 
individual heroism (at least, not of the conventional sort). Indeed, the 
Egyptian and Syrian armies are never glimpsed, and the front-line Israeli 
troops who appear are, for the most part, either dead, wounded or in 
flight. Instead, Gitai paints "Kippur" with devastating images of what the 
war did to his country and his countrymen. We see great plains turned into 
seas of mud by the grinding tire tracks of the tanks. Officers are reduced 
to confused wretches, unable to differentiate the dead from the survivors. 
And Gitai impresses upon us the sheer monotony of war: long stretches of 
"Kippur" are spent watching the characters sit waiting in silence, or 
haplessly trying to rescue a casualty from a sodden battlefield. "Kippur" 
is a movie of impressions, not plot. With a running time of more than two 
hours, this does lend the movie an agonisingly repetitive feel, and it is 
unfortunate that Gitai does not develop better characters on which to hang 
the viewer's interest. But though the middle part of "Kippur" is a chore 
to get through, the final act exhibits some fine filmmaking, as Gitai 
effectively shocks us out of our complacency. And war, after all, is one 
thing about which we should never be complacent.

Title
Review for Fairy Faith, The (2000)
Directed by John Walker. Running time: 77 minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB.
Reviewed on March 22nd, 2001.
Last year, the wrestling chronicle "Beyond The Mat" became the first 
documentary to procure a regular engagement at a St John's cinema in 
recent memory. Now, the envelope has been pushed one step further, with 
the week-long screening of the Genie Award-nominated "The Fairy Faith" -- 
the first Canadian documentary to hit local theatres in probably an even 
longer time.
Of course, given the subject material, it makes sense that "The Fairy 
Faith" would find its way to this province. Newfoundland enjoys as close a 
relationship with rural Britain and Ireland as any region on Earth. 
Indeed, some outport communities probably bear a closer resemblance to the 
England of three centuries ago than anywhere in the present-day United 
Kingdom. And it is these sorts of places where the traditional fairy lore 
still holds some measure of influence -- where the oldtimers speak of 
strange things that happened to a friend of a friend, back in the day, and 
even the younger set is wary of peculiar shapes half-glimpsed in the
twilight mist.
"The Fairy Faith" is about these people: those who still adhere to the 
ancient customs, in spite of the onset of progress and skepticism. 
Producer/director John Walker is a man who was himself enthralled as a 
child by the stories of the Wee Folk, as told by his Scottish grandmother. 
His mission here is to explore why certain folk still have faith in the 
fairy lore -- why, to some, fairy tales are not mere bedtime fiction but 
indeed something unexpectedly close to the truth.
Much of the film is spent traipsing about the British Isles, from the 
Scottish highlands to the glens of Ireland. These scenes are beautifully 
filmed, often set to bewitching music. After giving a brief synopsis of 
the basics of fairy legends (accompanied by some lovely artwork in a 
variety of styles), Walker interviews several individuals who claim to 
believe in fairies. Unfortunately, there is little rhyme nor reason to the 
process of Walker's investigation. His subjects seem chosen haphazardly, 
and he strains sometimes to lend them credibility.
For instance, a university scholar and a Celtic harpist offer interesting 
insight into the subject at hand, and their segments are genuinely 
engaging. But then there is the man who avers that he has the power to see 
fairies; when he starts pointing out places where the creatures are 
supposed to be, things grind to an embarrassing halt. The camera, of 
course, captures nothing unusual, and Walker never really pursues the 
obvious questions. Why can this man see fairies but we can't? What is it 
that prevents us from seeing the curious sprite he insists is sitting at 
the foot of a cascade?
This failure of Walker's to strive for substance persists throughout the 
documentary. Later, he visits a castle in which is stored a piece of cloth 
allegedly once owned by a fairy. Walker describes being fascinated by the 
artefact when his grandmother brought him there in his youth. He comments 
that now it just looks like an old, ragged piece of material, possessing 
none of the wonder he formerly beheld. But he explores this no further. 
Why has his perspective changed? Does this mean his belief in the fairies
has wavered? Why? What does this say about him, given that he constantly 
insists to his interview subjects that he does, indeed, share their faith?
To make matters worse, for every well-presented conversation, Walker 
includes some testimonials which are sorely in need of the editor's touch. 
Consider, for example, the yawn-inducing story told by a bemused 
Englishman who claims his shadow was nearly stolen by two fairies. Or the 
extended detour in which Walker indulges, about a supposed fey tree on the 
verge of being uprooted to make way for a new bypass. "The Fairy Faith" is 
short enough at an hour and a quarter, so perhaps Walker felt the need to 
pad things out, but he could have done so by bolstering his analysis 
rather than just drawing out the proceedings.
Equally uneven is the latter third of the film, when Walker returns to 
Canada to examine how fairy lore persists in this country. 
Disappointingly, Walker confines his attention just to the Antigonish 
region of Cape Breton island in Nova Scotia. What about other parts of the 
country where the old legends are not yet forgotten, like Newfoundland or 
Quebec? While I enjoyed the parallels Walker drew between belief in 
fairies and the traditions of indigenous peoples, I felt a greater 
exploration was warranted of the translation of fairy legends to the New 
World. Are there any noticeable differences in the fairy folklore of Cape 
Breton and the British Isles? Have any characteristics arisen which are 
unique to Canada, or are things essentially unchanged?
Further, Walker spends so much time on his Native American angle that he 
largely neglects the more obviously Celtic-derived myths of the Atlantic 
region. When he does return to this theme, it's often without much 
coherence. For example, several minutes are spent with a schoolteacher who 
took photographs of a small cave in which fairies are thought to reside. A 
big deal is made about one photo, which is supposed to contain evidence of 
fey activity, and the camera returns to it on multiple occasions. The 
problem is that it's never explained just what that evidence is supposed 
to be -- it just looked to me like a bunch of shadows, and I had no idea 
what I was supposed to be seeing.
"The Fairy Faith" is a nice idea poorly executed. Fairy lore is a rich and 
fascinating topic -- there is, after all, a very good reason why it has 
survived down through the millennia. Unfortunately, Walker never probes 
far below the surface of the subject. The result is a movie which neither 
successfully examines the questions it poses, nor fully captures the sheer 
magic of the fairy realm.

Review for Patriot, The (2000)
Directed by Roland Emmerich. Screenplay by Robert Rodat. Starring Mel
Gibson, Heath Ledger, Jason Isaacs. Running time: 164 minutes. Rated AA
for blood letting and violent scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on July 4th, 
2000.
I find it amusing that one of the previews before "The Patriot" was for 
"The Hollow Man". That title so accurately sums up this picture: hollow. 
It's been a long time since a movie tried so hard to involve me 
emotionally, and fail so miserably. Don't get me wrong -- "The Patriot" 
looks great, and is broadly entertaining. But much of its almost 
three-hour running time is wasted on flimsy characters and tedious 
retreads masquerading as emotional high points. For once, I wish the 
filmmakers had just been trying to make a summer action pic.
Comparisons with star Mel Gibson's last historical epic, 1995's 
"Braveheart", are perhaps inevitable. Both movies feature Gibson as the 
leader of a band of insurgents against oppressive British rule. There he 
was trying to free Scotland, here it is the American colonies during the 
Revolutionary War. The death of Gibson's wife and ultra-realistic battle 
scenes figure prominently in both pictures. But "Braveheart" stirred a 
raw, genuine response from me. "The Patriot" clearly strives for the same 
sort of impact, but never achieves it. Is it just that I've become more 
cynical in the five years between the two films? Perhaps. But I think 
it's more than that.
"Braveheart", you see, featured real characters. Gibson's William Wallace 
was a compelling hero, and his fate left me both shattered and uplifted. 
Benjamin Martin in "The Patriot" is just Gibson on autopilot. He's not 
poorly-acted, but he's all window dressing with nothing underneath. I 
believed in William Wallace; I can't say the same for Benjamin Martin. 
The same criticism can be levied at Heath Ledger, who plays Ben's eldest 
son Christian. Ledger spends the whole movie mumbling listlessly, like he 
didn't realise rehearsal was over.
For a movie about family to work, we must be convinced of the bonds 
between them, no matter how strained, but "The Patriot" never forges 
those bonds. Indeed, so tepid is the interaction amongst the castmembers 
that it feels almost as if they each filmed their scenes individually, so 
that they could be composited electronically in post-production. Most 
unfortunate is the lack of chemistry between the two stars -- Gibson and 
Ledger feel more like passing acquaintances than father and son.
There is a good story underlying "The Patriot", if only it were in 
service to a better film. Benjamin is a veteran of the French-Indian War, 
but now preaches dialogue instead of combat. Against his father's wishes, 
Christian runs off to join the continental army. When the War of 
Independence comes as close as the Martins' South Carolina fields, Ben 
elects to care for the wounded on both sides, which happens to include 
Christian. But the brutal British Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs) has 
the Martin homestead burned anyway, and Christian is arrested for 
carrying colonial dispatches. When another of the Martin sons intervenes, 
Tavington shoots him dead.
This spurs Benjamin into action. Accompanied by two more sons, he 
ambushes and slaughters the British contingent bringing Christian back to 
their camp. That night, one son tells him he's glad he killed British 
soldiers. Here was a perfect opportunity to examine the effects of war on 
the young. But no, the movie passes it by, instead confining itself to 
safe territory well-trod by other movies. Judging from "The Patriot", 
pretty much the only negative ramifications of war are that men have to 
leave home for long spells, and sometimes they never come back. Well, duh.
Things go downhill from there. There are obligatory romances, one each 
for Christian and Benjamin. Christian's at least benefits from involving 
a somewhat charismatic paramour, Anne (Lisa Brenner). Benjamin, however, 
is shoehorned into an unconvincing attraction to his dead wife's sister 
(Joely Richardson). There is no spark between them, and the whole thing 
happens only because the movie demands it. Cliche after cliche is paraded 
across the screen: The bad guy who's not quite dead yet. The token black 
soldier. When a recalcitrant Benjamin is assigned to recruit civilians 
for a militia, the locals demur, until Anne gives a stirring speech. A 
pause and then... you guessed it, one by one all the naysayers stand in 
support of Ben.
The villains of "The Patriot" fare no better than the heroes. Isaacs' 
Tavington has no motivation, and no characterisation beyond "he's mean". 
Tavington was a real person, and his wicked depiction here has drawn the 
wrath of the city of Liverpool, which considers him a hero. Liverpudlians 
needn't worry: I doubt anyone could believe this portrayal is accurate, 
because no real person is so utterly devoid of personality. Tavington's 
superior is General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson), who is at least useful 
for comic relief -- although much of the humor here is so banal, it's 
barely worth a groan. When Benjamin's militia blows up a British supply
ship during a party at Cornwallis' estate, one dim-witted aristocrat
ecstatically exclaims, "Fireworks!"
It is when "The Patriot" concentrates on the war that it finally kicks 
into high gear. Director Roland Emmerich does the movie no favours by 
filming many of the battle scenes with a tedious, mechanical style (close 
up of American soldier, wide shot, close up of British soldier, wide 
shot, repeat), but the realism and intensity of the combat overcomes 
this, especially in the exciting final clash. Every now and then, 
Robert Rodat's script shows a spark of creativity, or at least reuses old 
ideas in entertaining ways -- look at what becomes of Cornwallis' dogs, 
for example. And the beautiful period detail is a major attraction, with 
the whole movie looking as though it was lifted from a Leutze painting.
But "The Patriot" is ultimately a disappointment -- although, given that 
Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin masterminded "Independence Day" and 
the 1998 "Godzilla", two films with the most grotesque 
budget-to-intelligence ratios in recent history, maybe that's actually 
not such a bad thing. This is "Braveheart" lite: great fighting sequences 
trapped in a shallow narrative.
And why, if the movie spans five years, do the Martin children never age 
a day?

Title
Review for Violet (2000/I)
Directed by Rosemary House, from her screenplay. Starring Mary Walsh,
Peter MacNeill, Andrew Younghusband. Running time: 105 minutes. This film
is not yet rated by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 23rd, 2000.
It has often amazed me that a place like Newfoundland, blessed with any
number of dazzling landscapes in which to film and more than enough
theatrical talent to go around, has had so little success at cultivating a
popular home-grown feature film. This is not to say that there are no good
Newfoundland movies; pictures such as "Secret Nation" (1992) put a lie to
that notion. But unfortunately, much of the quality Newfoundland output to
date has been nigh inaccessible to anyone not from the region -- "Secret
Nation", for example, was likely impenetrable to anyone lacking a
good working knowledge of Newfoundland history.
Now comes "Violet", a dark romantic comedy which, although possessing a
distinctly Newfoundland flair, can nonetheless be appreciated by 
cinemagoers everywhere. Having made its world premiere at the 2000
Montreal Film Festival in August, "Violet" was one of two headlining
Newfoundland films at the eleventh annual St John's International Women's
Film and Video Festival. It was screened before an overfull house on
October 19th, the second day of the festival.
"Violet" stars Mary Walsh in the title role as a middle-aged woman who
believes she will die shortly after her fifty-fifth birthday. Several
family members -- most recently her brother -- perished at that age, and
the superstitious Violet fears the curse will visit her next. She quits
her job as a librarian and retires to her home and nursery in the lush Mt
Scio area of St John's, Newfoundland's capital city, to await the
inevitable.
Alternately caring for and antagonising Violet are her three children, all
of whom have problems of their own. Carlos (Andrew Younghusband) flirts
with the groundskeeper's assistant but has fled his teaching position at
McGill University for reasons kept to himself. Rex (Barry Newhook) is a
perpetually broke wannabe music producer. And Ramona (Sue Kent) finds her
impending nuptials in turmoil just weeks before the scheduled date. 
Meanwhile, Violet's cousin Lynda (Bernie Stapleton) and uncle (Brian
Hennessey) scheme to seize the nursery from her -- whether by relying on
the curse or by taking an active hand themselves. And through it all, the
faithful groundskeeper, Rusty (Peter MacNeill), cultivates a secret
affection for Violet of which she is blissfully unaware.
Part drama about middle-aged life, part madcap comedy, "Violet" straddles
the line between the two and does so mostly successfully. The script by
Rosemary House (who also directed) does well not to take the darker
elements too seriously, nor to take its zanier moments too far (though
some of the comedy does fall rather flat). And while the pacing
occasionally drags -- there are far too many scenes, for example, of
Violet moping about in bed, a poor use of such an energetic performer as
Walsh -- House manages to keep things moving through effective use of her
subplots. There are several of these running through the movie, but they
never become overwhelming nor neglected. Ultimately, they serve to paint a
more complete picture of Violet and her family than otherwise would have
been the case.
Walsh is terrific as Violet -- even languishing in bed, she still puts
more character and feeling into her dialogue than many performers reaping
top-scale salary in Hollywood. Viewers familiar with Walsh only from the
CBC comedy series "CODCO" and "This Hour Has 22 Minutes" may be caught a
little off-guard by her more dramatic turn here, but the unmistakable
Walsh wit is a part of Violet's composition too. Violet is a woman who
feels that the best times of her life -- epitomised by a memorable trip to
Italy in her youth -- are behind her, never to be recaptured. Walsh 
portrays this despondency perfectly, and yet manages to keep Violet 
grounded in realism, not allowing her to become an altogether depressing
character.
MacNeill, meanwhile, brings a quiet strength and nobility to his role of 
Rusty. His is, in many ways, the key performance of the film. The movie
turns on our ability accept the Violet/Rusty relationship at all its
stages, and MacNeill convincingly pulls it off. Rusty is never too distant
nor too doting, and the resolution of their would-be romance is entirely
satisfying. MacNeill also demonstrates an almost clandestine sense of
comic timing. One scene in particular, in which Carlos begins to tutor him
in Italian (so that he may better court Violet) is an absolute classic,
and must be seen to be savored.
Amongst the secondary players, Younghusband stands out, showing great
range as Carlos. Although Carlos seems to be more of a comic figure
through much of the film, there is a vague seriousness underlying his 
words and deeds, and when the reasons for this finally come out, 
Younghusband makes the transition of character with enormous conviction. 
Stapleton and Hennessey are also a lot fun as an odd sort of comic duo,
although the script does allow them to go over the top a few times too
often, particularly toward the end.
House's direction is not quite as assured as her scriptwriting, though she
and cinematographer Nigel Markham do take great advantage of the beautiful
Mt Scio environs. House is generally competent throughout "Violet", but
there are several underwhelming moments. For example, when on the night of
her birthday Violet discovers a codfish on her porch which she believes is
a premonition of her impending demise, it is only through the dialogue
that the importance of the discovery is made clear. "Violet" is also
extended well past its natural conclusion with an unnecessary and
poorly-conceived coda which serves only to try the viewers' patience.
Although not the best feature film to come out of Newfoundland -- it has
too many flaws and is simply too conventional to earn that honour --
"Violet" is nonetheless an entertaining and multi-faceted movie which
should enjoy wide appeal. If nothing else, it is a terrific showcase for
local performers such as Walsh and Younghusband, who demonstrate that not
all the best Canadian actors have fled south of the border.

Title
Review for Others, The (2001)
Directed by Alejandro Amenabar, based on his screenplay. Starring Nicole
Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Alakina Mann. Running time: 101 minutes. Rated
AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on August 13th, 2001.
Synopsis: Grace (Kidman) lives with her young son and daughter on an 
isolated estate in the Channel Islands. Her children are photosensitive, 
and hence cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. The arrival of new 
servants precipitates strange noises and unexplained occurrences in the 
darkness-shrouded house. Is someone trying to drive Grace mad, or are 
unquiet spirits haunting her family?
Review: Haunted houses are a familiar staple of horror films, and "The 
Others" hardly reinvents the wheel. What it does offer, though, is a 
classy, gripping example of the genre: an unusually spooky and 
spine-tingling experience. Amenabar, making his first English-language 
movie, demonstrates his profound understanding of sound: his self-composed 
incidental music is effective, and silence plays an equally important role 
in building the suspense. Although Amenabar does spend a little too much 
time at the beginning of the picture laying his groundwork, things pick up 
noticeably through the final hour. The director makes judicious use of all 
the tricks in his toolbox of terror; there are enough frights to keep 
audiences on the edge of their seats, but not so many that they become 
commonplace. The inclusion of a nineteenth-century "Book of the Dead" is 
one of several particularly eerie moments. Kidman boosts the script's 
credibility with a terrific performance, playing Grace (think "Kelly") as 
a sympathetic woman who nonetheless possesses a singularly ruthless 
streak. Mann is notable as her creepy, strong-willed daughter. The film 
ends, "Sixth Sense"-style, with a surprise ending which Amenabar is wise 
not to overplay; his more subdued approach is likely to haunt even the 
steeliest of viewers.

Review for Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)
Directed by Simon West. Screenplay by Patrick Massett and John Zinman,
from a story by Sara B Cooper, Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, adapted by
West. Starring Angelina Jolie, Iain Glen, Daniel Craig. Running time: 100
minutes. Rated PG for frightening scenes and mature theme by the MFCB.
Reviewed on August 22nd, 2001.
Synopsis: When adventuress Lara Croft (Jolie) finds an ancient clock 
hidden by her long-lost father (Jon Voight), it sets in motion a desperate 
search for an ancient artefact called the Clock of Ages. Competing against 
Lara in the globe-spanning quest are Manfred Powell (Glen), agent of the 
insidious Illuminati, and Lara's old flame, fellow relic hunter Alex West 
(Craig). But the race also brings to light secrets from Lara's past, and 
even she may not be prepared to uncover the truth about her father.
Review: The video-game-to-film transition is always a dicey proposition.
These films are often unable to appeal beyond arcade aficionados, and 
suffer a rapid slump into rental store obscurity. "Tomb Raider", though, 
is a bit different. Not only does it largely eschew the fantastical 
tendencies of most video game properties, but it evokes another movie 
franchise, its lead character being essentially a well-endowed modern-day 
Indiana Jones. Make no mistake, Jolie is very good as Lara, achieving a 
nice mix of upper-crust panache and two-fisted determination. West brings 
the excitement of the game to life, and many shots look as though they 
were lifted right off the computer monitor. But West's adherence to "Tomb 
Raider"'s roots ultimately proves to be the film's Achilles' heel as well. 
So rapid is his pacing that any sense of thoughtful filmmaking goes out 
the window. Characters flit by without development: we are expected to 
jeer Manfred Powell, but mostly because we're told to. The behaviour of 
wild card Alex West just seems to follow the whims of the plot. And 
although the writers have come up with an entertaining modern-pulp 
storyline, it is bereft of much of the charm that made Indy's adventures 
so endearing. Ultimately, the experience of viewing "Tomb Raider" is 
hardly more satisfying than watching someone else play the computer game.

Title
Review for Remember the Titans (2000)
Directed by Boaz Yakin. Screenplay by Gregory Allen Howard. Starring
Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Hayden Panettiere. Running time: 121
minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on November 11th, 2000.
"Remember The Titans" is neither a great sports movie, nor a great movie
about race relations. Like Denzel Washington's last based-on-reality
movie, "The Hurricane", "Remember The Titans" is a simplified 
Hollywoodisation of true-life events, prettied up for the big screen. But
unlike "The Hurricane", "Titans" manages to maintain its integrity
throughout the proceedings, resulting in a superior overall product which,
while not the Oscar contender some have touted, is certainly worth the 
price of admission.
The setting is Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971. Due to the racial 
integration of the formerly all-white high school where he coaches 
football, Bill Yoast (Will Patton) has been demoted to serve under a new
black coach, Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). He stays on only to ensure
that his white players do not boycott the season, thereby ruining their
college eligibility. Boone, meanwhile, has been installed purely as a
public relations move, with the school board ready to yank him out of his
job as soon as his team -- the Titans -- loses so much as one game.
The result is a series of fairly predictable set pieces. There are the two
leaders of their respective group of players -- Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst)
amongst the white students and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris) amongst the
black -- who are first enemies, then grudging allies. There is the new
white player who does not subscribe to Alexandria's racial turmoil, and
the veteran Titan who refuses to accept the integrated team. There is the
inevitable growth of respect between Boone and Yoast, building up to a
crucial moment in the team's season. And, of course, there is the football
aspect of the film which, unsurprisingly, all hinges on a final climactic
game.
There is little new in "Remember The Titans" -- familiar buttons are
pushed both in terms of the race plotline and the football story -- but it
is at least handled well by screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard. Howard
keeps the tone of the story light without sugarcoating the racial tension
on which it hinges. There is irrefutable unpleasantness here, and not all
of it is resolved comfortably; consider a scene in which one of the white
players new to Alexandria convinces two of his black teammates to come
into a restaurant which refuses to serve African-Americans. But the
indisputable thrust of the film is toward racial harmony, and the final
outcome is sure to leave audiences smiling as they exit the theatre. 
"Remember The Titans" is a feel-good movie in every respect, and serious
scenes such as the preceding quickly give way to more upbeat fare.
Fortunately, even this material is well-scripted and amusing, such as an
increasingly hilarious game of one-upsmanship in the Titans' locker
room. Howard also mixes in some genuinely intriguing and moving subplots,
including one in which Bertier must choose between his football team and
his girlfriend (Kate Bosworth), who cannot bring herself to accept her
black schoolmates. Howard and director Boaz Yakin are fortunately able to
tone down the unavoidable schmaltz factor, keeping such scenes as the
resolution to the Bosworth subplot pointed and underplayed.
Yakin handles the directorial reins capably, and the material on the
football field is executed with particular skill, neither belabored nor
difficult to follow. He demonstrates wisdom in not exaggerating scenes
unnecessarily; a sequence at Gettysburg, for example, could have been
milked for all the patriotic, egalitarian fervour it was worth, but
instead Yakin keeps it subdued, almost subtle.
He is aided in this endeavour by both his lead actors, who concentrate on
their characters as people rather than representatives of societal
ideologies. There is an excellent scene toward the start of the movie
where Boone refuses to take Yoast's job away from him, because that sort
of thing was done to him at his old school. But when a throng of
African-Americans shows up at his doorstep to cheer him on in his new
position, Boone is forced to change his mind and coach the team despite
his personal preferences. Boone is not a noble campaigner for black 
rights, but rather a black man who finds such a role thrust upon him. 
Washington delivers a very even performance, accepting both Boone's
defects and his virtues.
Similarly, Patton plays Yoast as neither a stubborn redneck nor a
bleeding-heart liberal. His transition from being passively against the
integration of his high school to learning to respect African-Americans is
handled smoothly and without show. For example, Yoast's decision to let
his daughter Sheryl (Hayden Panettiere) stay at the Boones' house is not
treated as an earthshattering event, but is instead relayed almost
off-handedly, in a conversation with another coach. Indeed, Patton's
performance may eclipse even Washington's. Although Washington handles his
part with unsurprising skill, Patton has to convey a far greater range, as
Yoast makes the gradual transition from (broadly speaking) villain to
hero.
Yakin coaxes workmanlike portrayals from the rest of his cast, who are
mostly stuck in typical, formulaic roles: the jovial fat guy, the jock,
the religious guy, and so forth. "Remember The Titans" is sadly 
unambitious on this front. Very little true conflict is uncorked between
the characters, and is instead left to fester mostly with 
briefly-appearing cameo parts -- a corrupt referee, a local Hall of Fame
president, the aforementioned restaurant owner. When there is disagreement
amongst the Titans, it is, in general, easily dealt with.
This leaves the impression that bringing the team together wasn't much
work at all. This was likely not Yakin and Howard's intent, as it somewhat
undermines the tension of the film's opening hour. Indeed, viewers are
left wondering just why it took the rest of Alexandria so long to follow
suit. And while, in principle, this is a very valid question, the sad
truth is that reality is rarely so accommodating, and I expect the real
Titans did not come together quite as smoothly as this depiction would
suggest. It only works that way in the movies.

Title
Review for Best in Show (2000)
Directed by Christopher Guest. Screenplay by Guest and Eugene Levy.
Starring Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey. Running time: 90
minutes. Rated PG by the MFCB. Reviewed on December 4th, 2000.
I'm a cat lover by nature. The only pets I've ever kept have been cats,
and I have absolutely no interest in owning a dog. Sure, I like dogs in
general (well, some dogs), and I can appreciate the pleasure that others
derive from them. But I've never comprehended the more bizarre extremes
that dog owners can sometimes go to: dressing them up, trimming them in
bizarre patterns, that kind of thing. And I definitely don't understand
dog shows.
Christopher Guest ("This Is Spinal Tap") seems to share my perplexity. His
new mockumentary "Best In Show" is a delicious parody of the dog show,
complete with eccentric competitors, bombastic hosts, and even
idiosyncratic pets. It is not a scathing attack on dog shows -- the movie
is too gentle and bemused for that -- but it certainly has a lot of fun at
their expense.
Guest follows several dog owners as they make their way to the Mayflower
Kennel Club's annual show in Philadelphia. None of them are entirely
normal. There's Guest himself who portrays Harlan Pepper, the backwards
proprietor of a backwoods fishing gear store. Harlan's mood seems
perfectly matched by his faithful bloodhound, and it comes as little
surprise that his world is comprised of very little beyond his dog and his
store.
Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey play Hamilton and Meg Swan, a couple
whose pooch seems to have developed a severe case of depression. Meg
thinks it's because the dog walked in on them having sex, but maybe it's
because the two high-strung individuals are perpetually stuck in
hypertense mode. (Tellingly, they first saw each other at Starbucks -- not
the same Starbucks, of course, but two Starbuckses across the street from
each other). One of the movie's best scenes has Posey, desperate for a toy
to replace their dog's missing stuffed bee, entering a pet store and
irrationally ranting against the clerk (Hiro Kanagawa) because, although
he has several similar toys, he doesn't actually stock a plush bee. When
Posey finally picks a toy at random, the clerk is in disbelief: she has
successfully chosen the least bee-like toy in the store.
Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are Gerry and Cookie Fleck, a pair of
middle-aged losers. Gerry has two left feet -- literally -- while Cookie
seems to be intimately familiar with virtually every man on the dog
show circuit. The Flecks are completely obsessed with their dog, to the
extent of even composing songs (really, really awful songs) in his honour.
Then there's Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins as homosexual twosome
Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donlan. Scott is flamingly gay and loving it,
while Stefan is more of a sophisticate. It's telling that, of all the
couples in the movie, theirs is probably the most stable relationship.
Scott's prance when walking their shih tzu around the convention floor is
perfect: he's as much on display as the dog.
Jennifer Coolidge plays Sheri Ann Ward Cabot, the voluptuous wife of an
aged and sickly millionaire. One early scene sees Sheri Ann painfully
trying to provide examples of substance in their marriage. She ends up
asserting that they share great conversation, and equally valuable
"We could not talk or talk forever and still find things to not talk
about," she explains. Sheri Ann is the owner of a toy poodle (surely the
most nauseating canine in existence) which has won best in show at the
Mayflower two years running, and is competing for a third win. Assisting
Sheri Ann is professional trainer Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), who seems
as interested in Sheri Ann as she is in the dog itself.
Rounding out the principal cast are Fred Willard and Jim Piddock, who
portray the television commentators for the dog show, Buck Laughlin and
Trevor Beckwith. Buck is a loud, vapid man in the grand tradition of
American football announcers; he obviously knows as much about dogs as he
does quantum physics. Beckwith is his long-suffering sidekick, who
desperately tries to steer Buck back on-topic when he starts rambling
about dressing the dogs up in Sherlock Holmes outfits to improve their
chances.
With the feel of something that has been at least partly improvised, "Best
In Show" manages to maintain a spontaneous feel while still setting up a
number of hilarious set pieces. Guest is equally adept at capturing
smaller comedy moments, emphasising the strange habits and obsessions
which are brought out during events like these. Consider the hotel manager
(Ed Begley Jr) who offers a learned discourse on the topic of what 
cleaning agents are best for the variety of pet accidents he encounters.
On its own, it's a dry but reasonable topic; put into the context of "Best
In Show", its faint absurdity becomes evident.
"Best In Show" does lose its way somewhat around the middle of the film,
as the comic potential of the characters on their own seems to near
exhaustion. Fortunately, just as ennui starts to creep into the
proceedings, we move from the preliminaries into the dog show itself,
which revitalises the film. In particular, the introduction of the double
act of Willard and Piddock is wonderful, and their commentary is amongst
the picture's highlights.
Several of the actors also stand out, particularly Posey and Higgins, who
attack their roles with great gusto. On the other hand, a couple of
characters never quite seem to find their way; McKean's Stefan, for
example, lives in the shadow of the outlandish Scott, and surprisingly
Guest's own Harlan Pepper is a man who always seems to be building up to
a punchline but never actually gets there.
All the same, there is a lot to recommend in "Best In Show". Given his
success here, I'd love to see Guest tackle something which attracts
similar levels of obsession and hysteria in the future. If Guest let loose
at a dog show is this funny, I can only imagine the hilarity which would
ensue should he train his sights on, say, a science-fiction convention...

Title
Review for Topsy-Turvy (1999)
Directed by Mike Leigh. Screenplay by Leigh. Starring Jim Broadbent,
Allan Corduner, Ron Cook. Running time: 160 minutes. Rated AA for nude 
scenes. Reviewed on March 22nd, 2000.
Is there a historical era with which the movie screen seems more in love 
than the Victorian? I tend to doubt it; no other time in history is 
portrayed with more style, more panache than the late nineteenth century, 
and "Topsy-Turvy" is no exception. Indeed, with its concentration on the 
colorful world of theatre, writer/director Mike Leigh's latest movie is 
even more visually sumptuous than many other Victorian-era films. 
Combined with the wit and music of Gilbert and Sullivan, "Topsy-Turvy" is 
a real treat for the eyes and ears.
As the movie opens, William Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and Arthur Sullivan 
(Allan Corduner) have enjoyed a successful and profitable partnership for 
more than two decades. Gilbert writes the stories, Sullivan composes the 
music, and to this point they have enjoyed nothing but popular acclaim. 
However, their latest opera, "Princess Ida", has been received lukewarmly 
at best by critics and audience alike. To make matters worse, Sullivan 
has grown weary of what he calls Gilbert's "world of Topsy-Turvy-dom": he 
wants to write a grand opera with a more human, more emotional scope than 
the likes of "The Pirates of Penzance" or "HMS Pinafore". He feels 
Gilbert's ideas have grown repetitive and refuses to score his new plot, 
a blatant rip-off of a previous collaboration, "The Sorcerer".
With no end to the impasse in sight and the fate of the Savoy Theatre, 
run by Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), at stake, Gilbert's wife Kitty 
(Lesley Manville) drags him to an exhibition of Japanese culture. 
Impressed by the vastly foreign culture, he purchases a samurai sword to 
hang on his wall as a souvenir. When it nearly falls on his head one night,
Gilbert is inspired to write "The Mikado". The team of Gilbert and 
Sullivan appears to have another success on its hands -- but only if the 
opera actually makes it to the stage!
"Topsy-Turvy" can be more or less evenly divided into two acts. The first 
deals with the imminent dissolution of Gilbert and Sullivan's partnership 
and the struggles of their confreres to persuade one or both of the 
stubborn pair to give in. It is interesting enough, but feels somewhat 
meandering. These sequences do a good job of establishing the principal 
characters and the tribulations of Victorian theatre, but are rather 
lacking in incident and the whole thing basically just goes on too long. 
"Topsy-Turvy" clocks in at more than two and a half hours, and I think it 
would have been better served by shaving some time off this first half.
Far better is the second act, in which "The Mikado" goes into production. 
We are privy to all the details of the theatre business -- line readings, 
costume fittings, orchestra rehearsals, and so on, but done in such an 
entertaining manner as to avoid tedium. Of particular interest, we are
witness to the clashes of ego and the hints of scandal which envelop the 
play's cast and crew. It is here that Leigh's already fine script really 
shines -- a scene where the actresses from the "Three Little Maids" 
segment practise in front of real Japanese women is a highlight. The 
dialogue and pacing in this act is excellent. Unlike the first half of 
the movie, nothing is dwelt on for too long and as a result there is a 
real energy to these latter scenes. There is also a great deal of humor in 
"Topsy-Turvy", and fortunately it arises naturally from the circumstances 
rather than being grafted onto the script. The theatre is a funny and 
bizarre enough environment without being exaggerated, and Leigh is well 
aware of this fact.
Performances from the cast are uniformly excellent, with Broadbent a 
standout as Gilbert. He does a particularly good job portraying the 
playwright's moody disposition, sometimes appearing both jolly and dour
at the same time. Scenes like one in which he leads a read-through of "The 
Mikado" with a bemused, shorthanded cast really show off the depth of 
Broadbent's performance. He is funny without descending into caricature. 
Corduner is very good as Sullivan, but isn't given quite the same breadth 
of material to work with. Much is made of his desire to branch out into 
more serious opera, but his characterization doesn't extend far beyond 
that. For example, whereas Gilbert has some great scenes with his wife 
filled with both humor and emotion, Sullivan's scenes with his paramour are 
more sedate. I never felt we got to know Sullivan the way we did Gilbert. 
Ultimately, Corduner's performance is simply less passionate and more 
functional, and ends up being overshadowed by Broadbent.
The rest of the cast is solid in their supporting roles. While these may 
seem incidental to the movie as a whole, characters such as a leading 
lady with a sordid past and a sickly actor with a drug problem really 
make "Topsy-Turvy" feel complete. This is not just a movie about William 
Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, but about a Gilbert and Sullivan production, 
cast and crew included. It is in presenting these details that Leigh 
really sparkles. He does not focus on them, but rather serves them up 
for the consumption of the viewer, to be digested or ignored at will. 
They are not so much subplots in of themselves, but just further 
complications along the road to opening night.
Of course, the real star of any movie about Gilbert and Sullivan is the 
music, and "Topsy-Turvy" does not disappoint. In addition to a number of 
pieces from "The Mikado", the movie also includes selections from "The 
Sorcerer" and "Princess Ida", all lavishly presented on a 
beautifully-designed stage setting.
"Topsy-Turvy" is a lot of fun, especially for those with something of an 
appreciation for the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Even if you're not 
well-acquainted with their operas, the movie serves as an excellent 
introduction to them, and provides an enthralling glimpse into 
the hectic and complicated world of theatre. The movie's lengthy running 
time does work against it, but it is otherwise extremely well crafted. Here 
is a film that ably demonstrates that, even after a century, Gilbert and 
Sullivan's world of Topsy-Turvy-dom has never lost its appeal.

Review for Bless the Child (2000)
Directed by Chuck Russell. Screenplay by Tom Rickman, Clifford Green and
Ellen Green, based on the novel by Cathy Cash Spellman. Starring Kim
Basinger, Jimmy Smits, Rufus Sewell. Running time: 108 minutes. Rated AA
for controversial subject matter and violent scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed
on August 16th, 2000.
One of 1999's biggest hits -- and biggest surprises -- was "The Sixth
Sense", a thriller about a young boy with supernatural abilities. It was
only a matter of time before the formula was copied and thinly-veiled
knock-offs began hitting theatres. Almost exactly a year later, the first
of these has arrived in the form of "Bless The Child", a thriller about...
wait for it... a young girl with supernatural abilities.
But to pick at how "Bless The Child" is derivative of "The Sixth Sense"
would be too easy, even unfair. Surprisingly, "Bless The Child" is not a
bad film in its own right. Certainly, it is no classic -- it is too 
unambitious for that, stringing together timeworn plot pieces and boasting
acting and direction that are, in general, workmanlike at best. But it
does not embarrass itself, and is enjoyable in the kind of  
turn-your-brain-off way that often characterises summer movies.
New York City, Christmas 1993: Child psychologist Maggie O'Connor (Kim
Basinger) is met at her apartment by her estranged sister Jenna (Angela
Bettis from "Girl, Interrupted"), a drug addict who has been missing for
two years. Jenna has brought with her another surprise: a daughter, Cody,
just nine days old. Jenna alludes to Cody being a strange baby, but avers
that she was not born hooked on narcotics. (That the identity of Cody's
father is a mystery should come as a surprise to no one.) Minutes later,
Jenna runs off again, abandoning Cody with Maggie. Maggie decides to raise
the little girl on her own.
Six years later, New York City is being terrorised by a series of
ritualistic child murders. An FBI agent specialising in occult crimes,
John Travis (Jimmy Smits), is brought in to assist in the investigation.
Meanwhile, Cody (Holliston Coleman) has begun to manifest strange
abilities -- she can make objects spin, and brings a dead bird back to
life. It turns out that the murders are being committed by the New Dawn, a
cult run by Eric Stark (Rufus Sewell) who are looking for a special child
born on December 16th, 1993. This, of course, is Cody and soon Stark
shows up on Maggie's doorstep with the long-lost Jenna as his new bride.
When Maggie refuses to let Stark and Jenna take Cody, Stark has her
kidnapped. With the help of a renegade New Dawn member (Christina Ricci),
Maggie discovers that Stark and his cult are really Satan-worshippers,
who plan to turn Cody and her powers to their own dark cause.
Anyone who has seen even a fraction of Hollywood's thriller output is
likely to find much of "Bless The Child" rather familiar. Many aspects are
recycled from better works -- not just "The Sixth Sense", but also
"Rosemary's Baby" and others. The screenplay, by Tom Rickman, Clifford
Green and Ellen Green, based on the novel by Cathy Cash Spellman, is a
routine affair which unfolds predictably, with few surprises. The
characters are poorly balanced. Smits is kept in the background for the
first three-quarters of the running time, and enjoys no character
development whatsoever. Ricci, meanwhile, is present in only two scenes
and is a transparent plot device. Similarly, a religious group opposed to
the New Dawn is abruptly introduced late in the film, and just as abruptly
dismissed. Their sole purpose seems to be to explain some of "Bless The
Child"'s mythology.
And there are some rather murky plot details as well. For example, if
Stark has gone out and found Jenna, surely he's known for some time that
Cody is the child he's after. Why, then, do his followers hunt down other
children until just shortly before Cody's abduction? Also, the New Dawn
killed the youngsters after they failed some sort of test; why do we never
see Cody undergo this rite?
Despite these flaws, I still found myself enjoying "Bless The Child". 
Director Chuck Russell is no M Night Shyamalan -- he demonstrates few
distinctive directorial stylings here -- but his pacing is good, and he
seems to understand that less is more. For instance, when Maggie
experiences brief moments where she can see demons encircling the New Dawn
headquarters, these are held long enough to be effective but are gone
before we can start picking holes in the (well done but still very
obvious) computer animation. This principal is particularly well-employed
at the climax of a chase across a subway platform, the movie's most
visually striking scene. Indeed, the design work throughout "Bless The
Child" is above average -- keep an eye out for the atmospheric graveyard
exterior in the final act, for example.
Also very good are some of the supporting performances. Sewell is 
terrific, creepy without going over the top into sheer black-hearted
lunacy. Newcomer Coleman also does a fine job. The youngster is charming
without being overly coy, and she interacts well with the adults. Less
impressive are the two leads. Basinger is sleepwalking through "Bless The
Child", demonstrating a  limited emotional range; she clearly isn't trying
very hard. Smits just seems bored with his role, which gives him little to
do and seems to rely largely on his "NYPD Blue" TV character to 
substantiate itself in the minds of the audience. Ricci is sadly wasted in
her very brief role, although she tackles what little material she is
given with gusto.
As a sequel-in-spirit to "The Sixth Sense", "Bless The Child" is a pale
imitation, lacking the invention and surprises of that film's script, the
atmosphere and artistry of its direction, and the quality and conviction
of its performances. Judged on its own merits, though, "Bless The Child"
is reasonable popcorn fare, fun to watch and lacking any truly 
cringeworthy elements. Summer 2000 has been full of movies which don't
quite live up to our expectations, which settle for being passable when
they could have been more. Here, then, we may well have the poster "Child"
for the season.

Review for Whole Nine Yards, The (2000)
Directed by Jonathan Lynn. Screenplay by Mitchell Kapner. Starring Bruce
Willis, Matthew Perry, Natasha Henstridge. Running time: 100 minutes. Rated
AA. Reviewed on March 16th, 2000.
Sometimes, comedy is easy. Romance, sports, teen angst -- these topics 
and others have often been mined for the purpose of making us laugh. 
(Every now and then, it's even done successfully.) Other subjects have 
proved more difficult to capture successfully in a comedy format, 
however. Of these, few have been more elusive than the gangster genre.
"The Whole Nine Yards" is the latest attempt to marry mirth and the mob, 
telling the screwball tale of Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew Perry). 
Oseransky's life is less than idyllic: he is trapped in a loveless 
marriage, he's forced to pay off his late father-in-law's enormous debts, 
and he's a dentist. Just when things seem as though they can't get any 
worse, Oz recognizes his new next-door neighbor as Jimmy "The Tulip" 
Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a feared hitman who turned state's evidence 
against Chicago's Gogolack gang and has recently been released from prison.
Oz does his best to ignore the situation, eventually becoming friends 
with Tudeski. But Oz's scheming wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) has other 
ideas. She forces him to fly to Chicago to inform mob boss Yanni Gogolack 
(Kevin Pollak, with a hilariously ridiculous accent) as to The Tulip's 
whereabouts and collect a finder's fee, while at the same time telling 
Jimmy what Oz is doing, in the hope that Tudeski will bump off her husband. 
To make matters worse, in Chicago Oz meets Jimmy's wife Cynthia (Natasha 
Henstridge) and instantly falls in love with her. It turns out that she, 
Jimmy and Gogolack have entered into an agreement whereby if two of them 
die, the third gets ten million dollars. It is this deal which drives the 
final two-thirds of the movie, as the different players try to bump each 
other off, and Oz tries to save Cynthia while not losing his own head.
Like most mob comedies, "The Whole Nine Yards" faces the difficult task 
of juxtaposing laughs with the sheer brutality of the gangster 
profession. Some movies deal with this by indulging in the truly bizarre, 
like Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs". Others simply tone down the violence, 
so that the jokes seem less incongruous. "The Whole Nine Yards" does 
neither, and the result is a somewhat uncomfortable viewing experience. I 
found it difficult at times to laugh at the sitcom-level humor of the 
film, immediately after seeing four men blown away in a hail of gunfire.
Neither of the principals really seems to embrace the material, perhaps 
themselves uncertain how to reconcile the movie's plot with its comedic 
intentions. Willis looks like he's cruising in neutral as Tudeski. While 
The Tulip is given a number of interesting personality traits, they never 
really come together to form a convincing, complete individual. Perry's 
Oz is basically just his Chandler Bing character from the TV series 
"Friends" transplanted to a different milieu; even some of the vocal 
mannerisms are identical. He's likeable enough as a sympathetic Ordinary 
Joe caught up in events beyond his control, but just doesn't have the 
on-screen presence to really absorb the viewer into his plight.
Better are the supporting characters, particularly Amanda Peet as Jill St 
Claire, Oz's receptionist who harbors secrets of her own. Peet clearly 
relishes her role, and her electrifying performance helps her steal 
scenes from the more tepid Willis and Perry. Star of the TV sitcom "Jack 
and Jill", Peet appears to be a comedy star on the rise. Michael Clarke 
Duncan also has fun as Frankie Figs, one of Tudeski's hitman confreres.
"The Whole Nine Yards" is set for the most part in Montréal, and is 
attractively photographed. Surprisingly, though, it takes little 
advantage of the Francophone milieu. The movie is liberally sprinkled 
with the French language (and Arquette sports a grotesquely exaggerated 
Québecois accent), but virtually none of the humor arises from the unique 
culture, beyond a running gag about hamburgers and mayonnaise. This is 
unfortunate; were the comedy to arise more naturally from the film's 
situations and surroundings, instead of resorting to routine one-liners 
and pratfalls, I think I would have found the violent aspects of the plot 
less jarring and easier to swallow.
Like last year's "Analyze This", "The Whole Nine Yards" is an only 
partially-successful mob comedy. It has its moments, especially when Peet 
is involved, but the time between laughs is often lengthy, and many of 
the jokes just don't pack much of a punch, especially when paired with 
the violence of the gangster lifestyle. This is a film which desperately 
needs to eschew the conventions of the sitcom format and more wholly 
embrace its subject material. In essence, instead of falling back on a 
tired comedy format, "The Whole Nine Yards" needs to go the whole nine yards.

Review for Road Trip (2000)
Directed by Todd Phillips. Screenplay by Phillips and Scot Armstrong.
Starring Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, DJ Qualls. Running time: 94
minutes. Rated AA for mature subject matter, coarse language and nude
scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on June 9th, 2000.
"American Pie" was one of 1999's funniest films. Although it was most 
notorious for the way it pushed the envelope in terms its gross and 
outrageous content, it was also a very genuine and very funny movie, and 
this set it above other comedies of its ilk. Of course, any successful 
film is bound to spawn imitators, and "Road Trip" is, I'm sure, only the 
first of many. But "Road Trip" is basically just "American Pie" writ 
small. Although it tries -- and sometimes succeeds -- for the most part 
it's not as gross, as outrageous, or as funny as its predecessor, and 
most importantly it's lacking the heart which made "American Pie" such a 
success.
This is most immediately obvious in the movie's premise. Whereas 
"American Pie" told a very believable, unassuming story -- four 
teenagers' attempts to lose their virginity before the senior prom -- 
"Road Trip" is much more contrived. Josh (Breckin Meyer) and Tiffany 
(Rachel Blanchard) have been friends since kindergarten and a couple 
since their early teens. But graduation has meant separation, with Josh 
attending Ithaca University and Tiffany going to the University of 
Austin. Now the two are forced to communicate mostly by phone and
videotape.
But Josh is also the object of desire of fellow Ithaca student Beth (Amy 
Smart). When several days pass without Josh hearing from Tiffany, he 
assumes the worst -- that Tiffany has abandoned him for another guy. 
Giving in to his lust, he brings Beth back to his dorm room after a 
party. Beth suggests they videotape their romantic encounter, and the 
drunken Josh agrees. The next morning, he discovers his pal Rubin (Paulo 
Costanzo) has accidentally mailed the sex tape to Tiffany in place of his 
regular video-gram. To make matters worse, he then finds out that the 
reason Tiffany has been out of touch is because her grandfather died 
suddenly. Josh decides he must go to Austin and retrieve the tape before 
Tiffany returns to school in three days. He, Rubin, and their friend E.L. 
(Seann William Scott, who was Stifler in "American Pie") convince wormy
but vehicularly-enabled Kyle (DJ Qualls) to join them in a wild and wacky 
road trip south.
In the wake of increasingly ribald comedies like "American Pie" and 
"There's Something About Mary", I expected "Road Trip" would go even 
further in the gross-out department -- especially given the inclusion in 
the cast of Comedy Central grossmeister Tom Green. Surprisingly, though, 
it's really pretty tame; only a scene at a diner is notably crude. Other 
moments try to be disgusting, but ultimately the cringe factor is 
unexpectedly low. Or maybe I'm just becoming desensitized to that kind of 
thing. Even the nudity -- which is about the only category in which "Road 
Trip" outpaces "American Pie" -- is generally inoffensive, although that 
may be as much to prevent the film being prohibitively rated as for any 
aesthetic reasons.
To be fair, "Road Trip" is pretty funny, but it never manages to sustain 
its momentum. Many scenes work, but more than a few misfire, or aren't 
exploited to their full comic potential. For example, at one point the 
lads pretend to be members of a fraternity in order to get a place to 
crash for the night, only to discover its members are all black. The 
sequence starts off well, but the tension is defused surprisingly 
quickly, and the whole thing feels abbreviated. Part of the technique 
used by "American Pie" and "Mary" was to take a funny situation, and then 
push it farther than anyone could have anticipated (the infamous "franks
and beans" scene in the latter, for example). "Road Trip" seems unwilling 
to be quite so adventurous, and is really a conventional film making a 
pretense of being controversial.
Much of the disparity between "Road Trip" and "American Pie" stems from 
the lack of characterisation in the new release. Whereas most of the 
denizens of "American Pie" were well-crafted and convincing, the 
population of "Road Trip" is mostly forgettable. Only Kyle really works: 
Qualls somehow manages to carry himself with a quiet dignity, rather than 
just playing the stereotypical college nerd. Although he's still an 
exaggeration, no character is easier to relate to than Kyle, and his 
transformation over the course of the film is by far its most interesting 
element.
Also very good are two supporting players who enjoy subplots of their own 
away from the main "road trip" storyline. Green, as eternal Ithaca 
student Barry, handles his material well and looks like he could easily 
carry a leading role in the future. Indeed, although I find the quality 
of Green's television programme highly variable, he's consistently 
enjoyable here. Smart, from TV's "Felicity", is somewhat wooden when 
interacting with the other leads. But once her character is misdirected 
by Barry to Boston (instead of Austin) in pursuit of Josh, she becomes
more comfortable with the role, and the scenario plays out amusingly.
The rest of the cast doesn't do quite so well. Meyer is amiable but 
two-dimensional as Josh; this is unfortunate because a strong center 
could have really helped pull "Road Trip" together. Scott seems to be 
replicating his "American Pie" character, but his material here is not 
nearly as strong. And Costanzo wanders through the movie in a state of 
perpetual listlessness, a condition which can only partly be justified by 
Rubin's drug habit. The meagre attempt toward the end of the film to give 
the character a bit of substance seems tacked on and is a poor fit with 
the film's overall mood.
It would be unfair to say that "Road Trip" is a step back for the teen 
comedy genre, but it's certainly a movie that is satisfied to hold the 
course rather than forging into new territory. And given that what's made 
the genre successful in recent years has been a fervent drive to push 
ever farther, that's tantamount to failure in of itself. "Road Trip" is 
good for a few laughs, but it's no "American Pie".

Title
Review for Saving Grace (2000)
Directed by Nigel Cole. Screenplay by Craig Ferguson and Mark Crowdy, from
a story by Crowdy. Starring Brenda Blethyn, Ferguson, Valerie Edmond.
Running time: 92 minutes. Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on November 22nd,
2000.
"Saving Grace" is a cozy rural comedy -- about marijuana. That statement
by itself should convince you that either this is an incredibly 
poorly-conceived film... or else that it's British. And indeed, "Saving
Grace" is a delightfully amusing little English lark, possessing more than
enough charm to overcome any reticence viewers might feel about its
seemingly incongruous subject material.
Instead of relying on elaborate gags and set pieces, first-time director
Nigel Cole opts for the tried-and-true British practise of establishing a
familiar, comfortable setting which is just off-kilter enough to tickle
the funny bone. Much of the action is set in a small Cornish village in
the middle of nowhere, where everybody knows (and gossips about) everybody
else.
The town is populated by such unlikely -- but not absurd -- characters as
a police officer who searches doggedly for poachers while living in
ignorance of the barely-concealed local marijuana stash, and two
well-meaning old biddies who are hopelessly naive, and probably a little
dense to boot. None of these characters are gross exaggerations, but none
of them are entirely realistic. They're regular people reflected in a
slightly warped mirror.
As befitting their role in the movie, the major characters are somewhat
more believable (if only just). There's gentle but sheltered Grace
Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn), recently widowed, who learns that her late
husband has bequeathed to her a massive debt she cannot hope to pay off.
Then there's Grace's gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson, who also co-wrote
the script), a man reluctant to seize the responsibilities that come with
age, despite the efforts of his girlfriend Nicky (Valerie Edmond).
Matthew is trying to grow a small marijuana patch in a hidden plot in the
garden of the local vicarage. When his crop begins to turn sickly, he 
turns in desperation to Grace, whose gardening skills are a matter of
local legend. Reluctantly at first, Grace nurses the plants back to health
-- better than ever, in fact. Gradually, she and Matthew hit upon the idea
of using Grace's greenhouse to grow enough pot to sell to a dealer and
make the money Grace needs to save her home (not to mention Matthew's
job).
What follows is a fairly typical sequence of events, as Grace and Matthew
try to keep their new line of work from the townsfolk, avoid Grace's
creditors, and find a drug trafficker to whom they can sell their haul
without getting their throats slit. There are very few surprises in the
narrative structure of "Saving Grace", but the material is nonetheless
well-written enough that this hardly seems to matter. It is difficult not
to watch the movie without a smile permanently creasing your face; that
the film only rarely provokes a huge laugh is almost irrelevant.
Blethyn gives a very even-handed performance as Grace. She has been given
no easy role, because Grace has to appear closeted and unworldly, yet not
overly stupid or childish. Occasionally, the script lets her down -- a
protracted scene in which Grace walks the back roads of London looking for
a dealer, dressed incongruously in her Sunday best, is more groan-inducing
than truly funny -- but for the most part, Blethyn holds steady. This
serves her particularly well in scenes such as her confrontation with
drug kingpin Jacques Chevalier (Tcheky Karyo). Their disarming tete-a-tete
would appear ludicrous in less skilled hands, but Blethyn makes it work.
Also very good is Ferguson, whose Matthew is probably the most
well-rounded character in the piece. He nicely captures a portrait of a
man trapped between his undisciplined younger years and the undesirably
mounting obligations of later life. He is paired well with Edmond, who
does a good job with her material; but unfortunately Nicky is just not
drawn well enough to match Matthew, and this dulls the energy of their
scenes together. Martin Clunes is also laudable as Matthew's best friend,
Dr Bamford, the village medic. As played by Clunes, Bamford is the sort of
man who looks at the world through ironic eyes, as though he never quite
believes what he is seeing. Clunes is consistently funny throughout 
"Saving Grace", and it's just a shame his role is not more integral.
"Saving Grace" proceeds well through its first two acts, but unfortunately
does come off the rails as it heads toward its conclusion. Whereas the
opening hour is carefully measured, slowly but assuredly building up the
intertwining stories of Grace, Matthew and Nicky, and the general
bemusement of rural life, the final thirty minutes is a cacophony of
different ideas. Beginning with Grace's spur-of-the-moment trip to London,
a slew of new characters are thrown at the viewer, and only some of the
resulting storylines emerge successfully. The ending of "Saving Grace"
feels very much like somebody throwing a cupboard-full of plates into the
air and seeing how many they can catch.
As a result, some subplots (including, sadly, Matthew and Nicky's) feel
abbreviated or abandoned altogether (one of Grace's creditors finally
comes to see her in person, gets hijacked into a separate thread, and is
then promptly forgotten). The main story of Grace's efforts to get out of
debt is handed an unforeseen and largely unbelievable resolution, as the
film fast-forwards ahead a year or two. It is the sort of ending that
makes you think the screenwriters were trying too hard to come up with
something that would both provide closure and send the movie out on an
uproarious note. In reality, it just comes across as odd and contrived,
and therefore accomplishes neither goal.
Still, "Saving Grace" is infectious enough that it is quite enjoyable,
on the whole. And despite its contentious subject material, it should
enjoy a wide appeal because it manages to be a movie about marijuana,
without really coming across as either pro- or anti-pot. "Saving Grace"
illuminates both the pleasant and unpleasant aspects of the matter -- and
pokes good fun at it all.

Title
Review for Mission: Impossible II (2000)
Directed by John Woo. Screenplay by Robert Towne, from a story by Brannon
Braga and Robert D Moore, based on the television series by Bruce Geller.
Starring Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott, Thandie Newton. Running time: 125
minutes. Rated PG for mild language by the MFCB. Reviewed on May 26th,
2000.
When the original movie version of "Mission: Impossible" was released in 
1996, there was little doubt that a sequel would soon follow. The film 
provided the perfect framework for a long-running franchise in the form 
of the international espionage agency known as the Impossible Missions 
Force. Not only did the use of this multi-purpose organization provide 
reasonable breadth of storytelling, but it meant future films weren't 
contingent on a recurring cast. Sequels could always use a different IMF 
if need be. Even the star, Tom Cruise, could be replaced in a manner 
rather more palatable than, say, the revolving door Batmans of the past 
decade.
Of course, for "Mission: Impossible 2", only the first option has been 
employed. Cruise does indeed return to reprise his role as Ethan Hunt, 
one of the IMF's top agents. Hunt, once again, is a cool, poised man of 
action, possessing a seemingly endless array of skills. But unlike the 
first "Mission: Impossible", which cast Hunt in the role of a desperate 
agent abandoned by his organization, little is really done with Cruise's 
character in this sequel. Character development is slim to none, and a 
romance with a fellow agent feels lifted out of a James Bond picture. 
There is an unsatisfying sense of stagnation to Ethan in "MI2"; it's 
almost as if scriptwriter Robert Towne is taking a page from the "Mission:
Impossible" TV series in limiting Hunt's evolution. The problem is that 
this is a feature film, not a television programme. It's fine for TV 
characters to develop slowly, because with twenty-two episodes a year 
they have the time. A movie franchise which only churns out a new 
installment every few years cannot afford the same luxury.
The same problem plagues the other holdover from the first film, Luther 
Stickell (Ving Rhames). Stickell was engaging in "Mission: Impossible"; 
here he's shoehorned into the background, often isolated even from the 
other IMF agents. Stickell could just as easily have been replaced with a 
totally new character without damaging the film, and as a result his 
return here feels almost token. The third member of this version of 
Hunt's team, Billy Baird (John Polson) is similarly faceless; even Emilio 
Estevez's short-lived agent in the first film was more interesting than 
this guy.
The same cannot quite be said of the last of our heroes, Nyah Hall 
(Thandie Newton). A world-class thief, we first encounter Nyah in action 
trying to steal a valuable necklace, and it makes for one of the movie's 
most watchable scenes. Nyah is a promising character -- neither a typical 
damsel-in-distress nor some kind of uber-confident goddess. 
Unfortunately, that potential gets lost in the movie's second half, in 
which Newton has far less screen time. It's also regrettable that Nyah's 
role in the proceedings means that she rarely gets to demonstrate her 
skills; the script mostly just calls for her to stand around and look 
vaguely nervous. Nonetheless, I would enjoy seeing the character return, 
in a more proactive role, in future "Mission: Impossible" films.
This time around, the team has been assembled to investigate the 
disappearance of the mysterious genetically-engineered Chimera virus and 
its antidote, Bellorophon. These have been stolen by a rogue IMF agent 
named Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott, who does a good job of acting evil but 
can conjure no other personality traits from the character) posing as 
Hunt himself. Ambrose and his goons intend to auction off Chimera and 
Bellorophon to the highest bidder. New IMF recruit Nyah is also Ambrose's 
former lover, putting her in a unique position to get close to him and 
give Hunt and his team a chance to reclaim the stolen goods.
The plot of the original "Mission: Impossible" was criticised by some for 
being too labyrinthine, although I enjoyed the complexity and intrigue it 
offered. The sequel goes too far the other way. This is all standard spy 
stuff -- viruses, high-stakes auctions, jilted ex-lovers -- and the 
"rogue agent" subplot has been overused of late, in everything from 
"GoldenEye" to, indeed, the first "Mission: Impossible"!
And this isn't the only element of the movie that feels lifted from its 
predecessor. Remember that terrific scene with Tom Cruise dangling inches 
above a pressure-sensitive floor? Well, something similar occurs here, 
albeit with none of the tension or flair of the original. Indeed, "MI2" 
is sadly lacking in invention and suspense, with many of the action 
scenes being just routine material. There is little of the twisting and 
turning which characterised the first film. There, when a character's 
secrets were revealed they were astounding; here, they're easily predicted.
It is fortunate, then, that "Mission: Impossible 2" has renowned director 
John Woo at its helm. Woo knows how to inject some much-needed 
adrenaline into the picture, employing some creative action shots which 
only slightly overuse slow-motion effects. Even Woo cannot save the 
tedious and overlong middle third of the movie. But he is in fine form 
during the closing half hour, pumping up the tempo with an entertaining 
motorcycle chase and a heart-pounding hand-to-hand duel between Hunt and 
Ambrose. Also an asset is a fine multifaceted score by Hans Zimmer.
But ultimately, it's hard to shake the feeling that "Mission: Impossible 
2" is mostly an exercise in sound and fury. And while this is certainly 
nothing new for a summer blockbuster, I at least demand something with a 
bit of originality for my entertainment dollar. "MI2" just doesn't offer 
that; it seems content to just be adequate, relying on the memory of the 
superior first movie (and of course Cruise's star power) to fill the seats.
"MI2" isn't a bad film, but it is a poor sibling to the first "Mission: 
Impossible". That movie was fun consistently, this one only in flashes. I 
would not be dismayed if a third film in the series were to go into 
production. But I hope any such project will strive to bring some 
freshness and invention to the franchise. With "Mission: Impossible 2", 
complacency has already set in.

Title
Review for Chuck & Buck (2000)
Directed by Miguel Arteta. Screenplay by Mike White. Starring White, Chris
Weitz, Lupe Ontiveros. Running time: 95 minutes. This film is not yet
rated by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 7th, 2000.
Provocative, sad, funny -- "Chuck & Buck" is all these things, in measures
unusual for a feature film, even an arthouse release. Even more unusual is
the fact that the picture manages to be all these things at once, rather
than tackling them in turn. It is a strange movie, moving in strange ways
and telling a strange story. But it is well crafted and its subject matter 
inspires thought -- even if that subject matter is more than a little
uncomfortable.
"Chuck & Buck" tells the story of two childhood best friends who reunite
after years apart. Chuck (Chris Weitz) -- now Charlie -- moved to Los 
Angeles and has become a music producer. Buck (Mike White, who also wrote
the script) stayed home to care for his ailing mother, and never really
grew up. Buck is stuck in a weird kind of mental nexus between childhood
and adulthood: he still wears clothes his mother picked out for him, still
sucks on Tootsie Pops, still plays sing-along records.
Charlie and Buck are reunited at the funeral of Buck's mother. Buck
expects their friendship to pick up right where it left off -- and perhaps
more so, as he makes a half-drunken pass at his old friend. But Charlie
has a fiancee, Carlyn (Beth Colt), and a life totally divorced from
whatever he once shared with Buck, and makes it clear he is not interested
in rekindling the old relationship. Buck follows Charlie and Carlyn back
to Los Angeles where he insistently tries to worm his way into Charlie's
life. Finally, Buck writes and stages a play, "Hank & Frank", in a
desperate attempt to remind Charlie of what they once meant to each other.
Central to the film is the character of Buck, and White is more than up to
the task of portraying such a complex, offbeat individual. White is
clearly intimately familiar with his story, and manages to portray Buck as
a bizarre man-child without making him seem exaggerated or unbelievable.
The tone is set early on when Buck, bored after the funeral, asks Charlie
and Carlyn, "Do you want to see my room?" in exactly the way he would have
done fifteen years earlier. But Buck is not a feebleminded idiot -- he
manages to make the move to LA and even carve out some semblance of a life
for himself, albeit one which still hinges around Chuck.
Buck is made more complete a character through his interactions with two
of the movie's supporting players. One is his play's director, the
supercilious Beverly (Lupe Ontiveros, giving the film's most deliciously
entertaining performance), who understands Buck but does not judge him.
The other is Sam (Paul Weitz), an incompetent actor whom Buck nonetheless
casts in the role of "Hank", his play's Chuck-parallel (in a clever bit of
casting, Paul Weitz is Chris Weitz's brother). Seeing Sam as a substitute
of sorts for Charlie, Buck attempts a relationship with the actor. Like
Charlie, Sam makes it clear that he is not interested; but unlike Charlie,
Sam opens the door for the two to continue a platonic relationship,
providing Buck with mature interaction through which he is able to grow.
Buck, then, develops into a realistic portrayal of a stalker. Eschewing
all the Hollywood stereotypes, he is not a menacing, calculating figure
forever lurking in the background of Charlie's life. Instead, he is a
forlorn man who almost plaintively tries to get his old friend to notice
him. Buck's actions are repulsive and perturbing, but it is difficult not
to feel some glimmer of pity (if not sympathy) for him as well. As is made
clear by the fairy-tale stylings of "Hank & Frank", Buck sees himself as
Charlie's putative saviour, and so while his methods are certainly
suspect, his goals engender at least some measure of respect, no matter
how twisted they might be.
That said, though, Buck is no innocent, no hero, and White does not forget
this. There is an effective scene where Buck, attempting to bond with the
young actor who is to play the youthful "Hank", lets the boy injure
himself with fireworks because Buck himself just doesn't know any
better. (Buck attempts relationships with all the "Chuck"s in the film,
and none of them work out quite as he had hoped.) Buck is undeniably
deranged; what makes "Chuck & Buck" so good is that there is more to the
character than just his mental deficiency. It is unfortunate, though, that
the movie does not delve more deeply into exactly how Buck came to be the
way he is. There are vague references to his parents being "crazy", and
presumably Chuck's departure was a shattering event, but a clear picture
is not painted of how these things came together to make Buck the person
he is today.
Weitz, disappointingly, fails to deliver a comparable performance as
Charlie. To be fair, his is not nearly as meaty a part. But Weitz never
succeeds in connecting with his role, meaning that Charlie seems to float
through the movie without ever quite feeling part of it. This is not just
a consequence of the distance that has developed between the two
characters in the years since Chuck moved away; Weitz never cultivates the
sense that a friendship ever existed at all. Fortunately, he is anchored
in the movie by Colt, who delivers a solid performance in a difficult,
compromising role as Carlyn.
"Chuck & Buck" is filmed in a grainy, low-budget style by director Miguel
Arteta, but this generally does not detract from the film. Only a few
poorly-staged shots belie the movie's humble background. For the most
part, Arteta's visual style only serves to enhance the sensation that such
bizarre, awkward, conflicting events can actually play out in real
life. And, even beyond issues of denied sexuality and the implications of
friendship, that may be "Chuck & Buck"'s most disturbing observation of
all.

Title
Review for Waydowntown (2000)
Directed by Gary Burns. Screenplay by Burns and James Martin. Starring Fab
Filippo, Marya Delver, Gordon Currie. Running time: 87 minutes. This film
is not yet rated by the MFCB. Reviewed on March 7th, 2001.
I attend and work at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Virtually every 
structure on the campus -- academic, administration and residence -- is 
linked in some way, either via skywalk or by a sometimes labyrinthine 
network of underground tunnels. Fortunately, I don't actually live on 
campus, so at the end of every day, I escape that closed network for the 
real outdoors. Not everyone is so lucky; I've known people living in 
residence who have purposely planned their schedules so that they never 
actually need to go outdoors. For them, MUN is a sealed environment: they
experience the world beyond only second-hand.
So I can relate to "Waydowntown", directed and co-written by Canadian 
helmer Gary Burns. "Waydowntown" is set in Calgary, Alberta, which sports 
a similarly enclosed downtown complex, complete with restaurants, 
corporate offices, shopping malls and living accommodations: it's a 
universe unto itself. Four employees working for a company headquartered 
somewhere in this amalgamation of edifices have made a bet to see how long 
they can last without actually going outdoors; the losers each give up a 
month's salary.
The movie begins four weeks into the wager, when it's beginning to take 
its toll on all the participants. Slick but manic Curt (Gordon Currie) is 
longs for the pleasures of the flesh, and has set his sights on vulnerable 
co-worker Vicki (Jennifer Clement), whose relationship with her fiance is 
on the rocks. Randy (Tobias Godson) passes time engaging in meaningless 
conversation with dorky security guard Phil (James McBurney). Sandra 
(Marya Delver), newly saddled with the responsibility of keeping an eye on 
her kleptomaniacal boss, finds herself suffocating in the recycled air of 
the downtown. And the competitive Tom (Fab Filippo) finds himself assailed 
on all sides -- by an attractive but flighty woman with a possibly 
suicidal boyfriend, by his oddball officemate Bradley (Don McKellar), and 
even by fleeting visions of a superhero in tights.
Burns and co-writer James Martin have devised a clever concept in 
"Waydowntown". The general set-up may seem like something out of a 
"Seinfeld" episode, but it's also a nice reflection of the way modern 
society has become so focussed, centralised and ultra-efficient that the 
simple beauty of life is sometimes forgotten. Being able to, say, go for a 
walk in the park might seem frivolous and superfluous -- especially when 
there are "more important" things to do -- but imagine actually being 
unable to indulge in that kind of activity. All of a sudden, it doesn't 
seem so frivolous and superfluous. It's the sort of thing that places the 
pursuit of money and power and achievement in context; what's the point in 
making millions of dollars if it becomes the sum total of your existence?
Burns directs the film at a manic pace, evoking the hectic state of 
everyday existence. He even slips occasionally into the mindstate of his 
characters. For instance, Tom feels like he's just floating through life, 
and Burns actually portrays him levitating down the corridors and walkways 
of the downtown. Burns also nicely captures the claustrophobia and 
sterility of the complex, a feeling enhanced by his decision to shoot the 
movie digitally and then transfer over to film afterward. "Waydowntown" is 
relentless from start to finish, sucking the viewer into its warped vision 
of reality right from the unusual opening credit sequence, and not letting 
go until the very end.
But as good as the premise of "Waydowntown" is, Burns is never quite able 
to elevate his script above the central idea. There are a lot of funny 
sequences -- I liked the way Sandra kept chasing after her elderly yet 
elusive boss only to become a shoplifter of sorts herself, stealing 
perfume inserts out of magazines to give her something to breathe in 
besides the stale downtown air. And a scene in which Brad attempts to 
replicate a local legend with a pop bottle full of marbles is downright 
hilarious.
But too often, Burns and Martin fall back on rather dodgy sitcom-style 
humour. An extended subplot involving Tom and an expensive crystal vase 
plays out, for the most part, like something that might have been on last 
night's rerun of "Three's Company". Other elements just feel like they 
could have been milked for more: Curt's bathroom-stall conquest of Vicki, 
for example, ends not with a bang (excuse the pun) but with a whimper. And 
in some areas, the script simply feels as though it needed tightening. 
Randy's entire existence is never really justified: he enjoys no 
interesting subplot like the other three participants in the bet, and is 
really only takes part in a couple of genuinely funny sequences (one 
involving Sandra and a cell phone is delightful, but Randy's presence 
isn't particularly germane).
Still, Burns does manage to encourage a number of good performances. 
Filippo -- despite the distracting affectation of wearing dark lipstick 
throughout -- hits all the right notes as Tom, whose natural state of 
climbing the corporate ladder is challenged by his awakening appreciation 
of a broader view of life. Initially appearing as little more than a 
corporate smooth-talker, Tom steadily develops a conscience as 
"Waydowntown" progresses, and Filippo does a good job of portraying this 
growth. Meanwhile, McKellar plays his oddball part well, making Bradley 
sufficiently weird and distant without losing a sense of reality (or 
humour). Currie is saddled with a rather stereotypical role as would-be 
jock Curt, but handles his material well all the same. Also noteworthy in 
a smaller role is McBurney, who steals practically every scene he's in. 
Phil's abortive efforts to stand up to the businessmen who are oblivious 
to his existence account for some of the movie's most sublime scenes.
Given all this, then, it is unfortunate that "Waydowntown" isn't as funny 
as it could and should have been. Burns is clearly on to something here, 
but isn't aggressive enough in complementing his high concept with an 
equally challenging execution. But despite its flaws, "Waydowntown" 
remains an effective, entertaining and incisive parable for our times.

Review for Est - Ouest (1999)
Directed by Regis Wargnier. Screenplay by Sergei Bodrov, Louis Gardel,
Rustam Ibragimbekov and Wargnier. Starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg
Menshikov, Catherine Deneuve. Running time: 120 minutes. This film is
not yet rated by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 30th, 2000.
It's somewhat ironic that I saw "East-West" the evening after viewing Rod
Lurie's "The Contender". Both are politically charged movies which,
although laudable in broad strokes, fail to achieve their full potential
because they adopt an overtly simplistic approach to their subject 
matter. For "The Contender", it was a matter of dismissing potent dramatic
issues in favour of an easy, quick-fix resolution designed to make the
audience go home happy. In the case "East-West", the problem is somewhat
more ingrained.
Featuring French and Russian dialogue (with English subtitles), 
"East-West" is the decade-spanning story of Frenchwoman Marie Golovin
(Sandrine Bonnaire), whose husband Alexei (Oleg Menchikov) is one of
thousands of Russians being wooed back to their homeland in the aftermath
of World War II. The film, directed by Regis Wargnier, starts
beautifully as we watch the homeward-bound Russians celebrating in a 
sumptuous ship's cabin. Then, without warning, we are deposited into the
terrifying midst of the Soviet empire: as the passengers disembark, they
are immediately herded into two groups, depending on whether or not the
Kremlin believes them to be "imperialist spies".
Marie is initially amongst the condemned, and survives only because of the
pleas of her husband, a renowned doctor. They are sent to live in a
crowded residence housing several other families. Alexei becomes the head
of medicine at a factory while Marie does the laundry for a military
choir. They are constantly watched, though, and when the residence's
supervisor makes the mistake of revealing to Marie that she knows French,
she is soon relieved of her duties and taken away. The woman's grandson
Sacha (Sergei Bodrov Jr), now homeless, is taken in by the Golovins. 
Marie, disillusioned with her husband's apparent unwillingness to stand up
to the state, begins a passionate affair with Sacha. Together, they plot
to escape Russia by taking advantage of Sacha's position as a member of
the Soviet swim team.
"East-West" is a visual treat, as Wargnier fills the screen with contrasts
that are, naturally enough, both entrancing and horrifying. The stark
beauty of the Russian landscape is set tantalisingly against the sheer
brutality of the Communist regime. (The snowswept image of the pond where
Sacha trains, now frozen over with ice, is particularly memorable.) Scenes
of romance and tenderness are tempered by the knowledge that everyone is
being watched and nobody can be trusted. Even Sacha's triumph in
qualifying for the national swim team is offset by the fact that it has
been engineered for darker, more desperate purposes -- and the powers that
be may or may not be aware of the fact.
But unfortunately, Wargnier fails to conjure a story compelling enough to
live up to his stirring images. "East-West" is far too conventional in its
structure, dwelling not on the oppression of the Supreme Soviet but
instead on Marie's efforts to escape the country. It is the Cold War
reduced to its most simplistic form -- Communism is bad, democracy is
good, and shades of grey are all but nonexistent. "East-West" would have
been better served if Wargnier had opted to more strongly establish the
effect of the political climate on everyday Russian life. Instead, he
concentrates mostly on the more extreme aspects of the regime, such as a
Gestapo agent who is almost cartoonish in his villainy.
The result is that Wargnier loses touch with his characters. "East-West" 
is a movie that looks like a very personal drama, but is executed more
like a particularly slow-moving Tom Clancy thriller. None of the leads
enjoy much depth, and Menchikov is particularly ill-served by the flimsy,
tepid Alexei. Both Bonnaire and Bodrov bring a lot of vitality to their
roles, but have little personality. They are thinly-veiled stereotypes; 
Marie is the Westerner trapped behind the Iron Curtain, Sacha the
Easterner rebelling against his Communist masters.
Wargnier never effectively conveys the ties between the characters. Marie
and Alexei feel less like husband and wife than casual acquaintances. When
their marriage begins to break down and both begin affairs with other
people, it is an almost casual occurrence. "East-West" feels populated by
shadows, gliding through events without every truly becoming involved in
them. There is no resonance to the drama being played out.
Even Catherine Deneuve, portraying a French stage actress named Gabrielle
who may be Marie's most important ally, seems to be struggling to lend
substance to her character. To make matters worse, Deneuve brings such
presence to the film that she dominates any scene in which she appears; 
Bonnaire and the others simply cannot compete. This would be fine if
Gabrielle played a more central role in "East-West", but she does not; she
is a facilitator, whose emotional stakes in the drama are limited at best.
Ultimately, then, "East-West" is a lovely but disaffecting drama which
settles for simplicity when it should be striving for depth. Lacking the
complexity of characterisation and depiction needed to effectively explore
the themes it proffers, "East-West" ends up being little more than a
pretty (and chilling) pictorial of the Soviet Union in the middle part of
this century. This, in of itself, is not altogether without merit.
"East-West", however, could have been much more.

Title
Review for Filth and the Fury, The (2000)
Directed by Julien Temple. Starring John Lydon, Paul Cook, Steve
Jones. Running time: 108 minutes. Rated R by the MFCB. Reviewed on
September 20th, 2000.
"The Filth And The Fury" is director Julien Temple's uncompromising
chronicle of the notorious, short-lived, but incredibly influential punk
rock band, the Sex Pistols. Formed out of the social transformation and
unrest that characterised Britain in the 1970s, the Sex Pistols existed
for only about two years and released just one album in that time. They
were torn apart as much by inner strife and a propensity for 
self-destruction as by any external pressures. But they gave a voice, an
outlet to the chaos gripping the youth and the lower classes of the time,
and are still remembered as one of the most culturally important acts in
modern music history.
Much in the style of the Pistols themselves, "The Filth And The Fury" is a
frenzied, at times disorienting  piece of filmmaking. Temple eschews any
sort of clear-cut, linear history of the band in favour of something more
representative and anarchic. He skips from interview to interview, clip to
clip, event to event almost without warning. The faces and milestones do
not present themselves as distinct facts to be absorbed, but instead the
whole movie blurs into a surreal impression of those two heady years --
some good, a lot of bad, and a generous helping of weird.
Temple draws his material from a variety of sources. There are modern-day
interviews with the surviving Pistols: John Lydon, the erstwhile Johnny
Rotten; Paul Cook; Steve Jones; and original bassist Glen Matlock. All
four are filmed with severe backlighting, obscuring their faces, as if 
seeing the Sex Pistols in middle age would somehow diminish their 
mystique. There is also a 1978 interview with the late Sid Vicious, who 
replaced Matlock, recorded shortly after the Pistols broke up. Commentary
from the band's notorious manager, Malcolm McLaren, airs over scenes of a
man in bondage garb -- emblematic of McLaren's own fetishistic 
tendencies. Temple contrasts this with news reports of the time, cartoons
of the Pistols, and even clips from the Laurence Olivier version of
"Richard III".
Fortunately, "The Filth And The Fury" is not a fanboy's version of Pistol
history, but instead takes a seemingly honest and frank view of their time
on the stage. Witness, for example, Lydon's critique of his own lyrics for
"Anarchy In The UK", admitting to the terribly forced nature of the
central "anarchist"/"Antichrist" rhyme. Some events would appear almost
too ridiculous to be believed if they hadn't actually happened: A TV
interview in which the Sex Pistols taunt and swear at the host, who is as
inebriated as they are. The refusal of major music magazines to list "God
Save The Queen (She Ain't No Human Being)" as the UK's number one album,
resulting in a blank space at the top of the charts that week. The
Pistols'signing by a record label, only to be dropped twenty-four hours
later (the film keeps almost mirthful track of how much money the band
racks up thanks to their association with no less than three different
labels, although in reality it was McLaren who pocketed the vast
majority).
There is also little reticence in Temple's portrayal of the Sex Pistols'
final months: Of the conflicts between those who supported McLaren (Cook
and Jones) and those who wanted to oust him (Rotten and Vicious). Of the
ill-fated American tour which finally shattered the band once and for all
(culminating in a notorious one-song performance in which Rotten asked the
audience ironically, "Did you ever get the feeling you were being
cheated?"). And of Sid Vicious' relationship with the seemingly
universally-reviled Nancy Spungeon, which many believe contributed to his
debilitating drug addiction.
It is Vicious' story which is without doubt the most bizarre, even though 
he did not became a Sex Pistol until long after the group's formation.
Hired more for his looks than his dubious musical talent (Lydon notes that
sometimes they wouldn't even plug in Vicious' bass because he played it so
poorly), he became as synonymous with the Sex Pistols as Johnny Rotten. 
Soon, though, the combination of his newfound fame and his romance with
Spungeon led to a heroin habit, souring his relationship with his
bandmates (it is interesting to note that, despite the rebellious nature 
of the Sex Pistols, they are portrayed here as taking a dim view of hard
drugs). Months after the dissolution of the group, Spungeon was found
brutally murdered and Vicious was arrested for the crime. Before his guilt
or innocence could be established, Vicious himself would die of an
overdose. Those unfamiliar with the Sex Pistols may find the persistent 
references to Vicious at the start of the film somewhat confusing; their
patience pays off by the end, however, as Temple paints a dramatic
portrait of the man -- the "poor sod", Lydon mourns.
If "The Filth And The Fury" has a failing, it is that it satisfies itself
with chronicling only the years when the Sex Pistols were together,
neglecting the legacy the band left which would continue to be
influential long afterward. Temple seems to agree with Lydon's assertion
that the Sex Pistols "had to end when it did" ("but not how it did", he
continues) because they were starting to become as institutionalised as
the cultural sacred cows they were railing against -- inspiring fashion
trends, for example, an event which almost seems to mock the true,
destitute origins of the Pistols' ragged dress sense. But he does not
pursue this to its natural conclusion, by investigating how the Sex
Pistols would be perceived over the ensuing two decades.
The fundamental question of why the Sex Pistols are important, and why
they deserve to be documented in a movie like this, is never really
addressed. Whether this is because Temple assumes we already know the
answer, or whether he simply doesn't feel it's germane to his film, is
not clear. Nonetheless, "The Filth And The Fury" ends feeling incomplete
-- like a movie review with too much synopsis and not enough critique,
perhaps.

Title
Review for Dungeons & Dragons (2000)
Directed by Courtney Solomon. Screenplay by Topper Lilien and Carroll
Cartwright, based on the game created by E Gary Gygax. Starring Justin
Whalin, Marlon Wayans, Zoe McLellan. Running time: 107 minutes. Rated PG
for frightening scenes by the MFCB. Reviewed on December 21st, 2000.
Okay, I admit it. As a critic, I'm supposed to approach any movie 
objectively, but that isn't always the case. There are some films I'm just 
predisposed to liking -- anything starring Jimmy Stewart, for example.
"Dungeons & Dragons" falls into this category. I've been a participant in 
the role-playing game for thirteen years, and have anticipated its 
big-screen treatment for some time. To further whet my appetite, the film 
features a cameo by one of my favourite actors (Tom Baker, the 
curly-haired Time Lord with the immense scarf on the BBC's "Doctor Who"). 
And this is on top of boasting two traditionally excellent actors in 
Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch.
First, let's be clear: "Dungeons & Dragons" isn't really "based on" the 
role-playing game. That's because there's not a lot of source material: 
D&D, the game, is a set of mechanics sparsely peppered with vague 
background. You could just as easily create a movie based on "Monopoly" or 
"Yahtzee". The basic idea is to take the rules set down in the D&D game 
and apply them to a scenario invented by the players themselves.
The world depicted in "Dungeons & Dragons", the movie, is therefore 
entirely an invention of producer/director Courtney Solomon and writers 
Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright. At best, "Dungeons & Dragons" 
adheres to the rules laid down in the game, and then only loosely.
The Empire of Izmer is on the brink of civil war. Socially-conscious 
young Empress Savina (Birch) is locked in a struggle with the ruling 
Council of Mages, led by Profion (Irons). Profion desires power for 
himself, but Savina wields an enchanted staff which allows her to control 
mighty gold dragons. Through his brutish underling Damodar (Bruce Payne), 
Profion learns of another magical staff which would permit him to command 
red dragons. However, the roguish Ridley (Justin Whalin) uncovers 
Profion's plot, and sets out on a quest to find the staff first.
Ridley quickly accumulates a party of allies, including his thieving 
partner Snails (Marlon Wayans), apprentice magic-user Norda (Zoe 
McLellan), elven tracker Marrina (Kristen Wilson) and gluttonous dwarf 
Elwood (Lee Arenberg). (The name Elwood comes from the press material -- 
if the dwarf is ever actually named onscreen, I didn't hear it.) The 
amusing thing is that, with the exception of Snails, Ridley's companions 
accomplish nothing beyond serving as convenient hostages for the bad 
guys. One amusing scene, in which they confront Profion one after the 
other only to each be instantly despatched by the villain, tells the whole 
story.
His adventuring band assembled, Ridley endures a series of dungeons and 
mazes, eventually leading to the recovery of the fabled staff. With the 
dungeons dispensed with, what comes next but -- you guessed it -- the 
dragons. Lots of them. Apparently, someone didn't quite realise that 
"Dungeons & Dragons" is just a cute, alliterative name for the game, not 
its complete description.
Solomon allegedly spent a decade crafting the storyline for this film, but 
it scarcely shows. Frankly, I've seen better D&D adventures put together 
on the spur of the moment at the start of a gaming session. At its best, 
D&D allows participants' imaginations to soar. Solomon, on the other hand, 
has kept his story firmly rooted in the most laboured cliches of the genre 
-- everything from sliding walls to those boobytrapped floors where you 
have to step on just the right stones to make it across. It's telling that 
one of the movie's seemingly more interesting scenes, in which Ridley and 
Norda actually enter a magic map and confront the spirit dwelling within, 
is reported purely through dialogue.
The acting in "Dungeons & Dragons" is almost universally abysmal. Whalin 
(who was the second, far duller Jimmy Olsen in the "Lois & Clark" TV 
series) and McLellan have clearly been cast purely for their all-American 
good looks; their overacting is embarrassing to behold. Only Irons 
surpasses them in this regard, chewing the scenery with gusto literally 
every time he appears. Birch shows none of the prowess she demonstrated in 
"American Beauty" -- she utters lines of dialogue as though her mouth was 
filled with marbles, and she lives up to her surname for wooden acting. 
Payne apparently spends the entire movie under the misapprehension that 
talking in a raspy voice makes him sound menacing and not at all like a 
guy in need of some Vicks Vapo-Rub; he inexplicably wears silver lipstick 
throughout, to boot. Virtually the only reasonable acting is offered by 
Wayans, but this is mitigated by the fact that his role as the cowardly, 
covetous Snails verges on being a racist stereotype.
None of them are helped out by the clumsy, cheesy script concocted by 
Lilien and Cartwright. As bad as the delivery might be, in many cases the 
actual dialogue is even worse. Consider this hair-curling exchange. 
Profion: "I shall invent a NEW DESTINY of PAIN for you... and NEW SENSES 
with which to FEEL IT!" Ridley: "Not if I kill you first!" (Truly, the 
snappy comeback is a lost art.) And everything leads up to an ending which 
tries to be touching and inspiring, but only manages to be sappy and 
confused.
Visually, "Dungeons & Dragons" is respectable, with scenes of dragons in 
combat above Izmer looking particularly good (albeit clearly 
computer-generated). However, it does appear that the production was 
running low on funds for some sequences -- for instance, count the number 
of times Ridley and friends seem to pass the exact same copse of trees. 
(Then again, maybe they accidentally let Irons loose on that particular 
set.)
Otherwise, about the only thing "Dungeons & Dragons" has going for it is 
that it at least falls into the category of films so bad they're funny. 
It's difficult to be bored sitting through this one when you're spending
the whole time laughing at it (at it, mind you, not with it). If ever 
there was a compelling reason to revive the late, lamented "Mystery 
Science Theater 3000", "Dungeons & Dragons" is it.

Title
Review for Frequency (2000)
Directed by Gregory Hoblit. Screenplay by Tobias Emmerich. Starring Dennis
Quaid, James Caviezel, Elizabeth Mitchell. Running time: 121 minutes. 
Rated AA by the MFCB. Reviewed on May 4th, 2000.
One of the big problems with many movies about changing history is that 
they tend to get bogged down in its mechanics. The difficulty is that our 
modern understanding of time is still incredibly limited, so any such 
discussion will by its very nature come across as a load of gobbledegook.  
Good movies like "Back To The Future" ignore the subject altogether, or 
at most give it a passing acknowledgement. Their makers are aware that 
the fun thing about time isn't how it works, but how it can be used in a 
dramatic context. "Frequency" is such a film, and it proves to be one of
the most entertaining movies of the year so far.
John Sullivan (James Caviezel) is a cop in 1999 New York. He has just 
broken up with his girlfriend, drinks a little too much, and is all too 
aware that it's almost the thirtieth anniversary of the death of his 
father. Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid) was a firefighter who perished in 
1969 rescuing a transient from a warehouse fire. One night, John happens 
upon his dad's old ham radio, mothballed since Frank's demise. For old 
times' sake, he switches it on.
A lot of things were happening in New York around the time of Frank's 
death. The "Amazing" Mets were on their way to winning the World Series 
against the Baltimore Orioles. A serial killer murdered four nurses 
before vanishing without a trace. And the aurora borealis -- the Northern 
Lights -- was making a rare week-long appearance in the skies above the 
city.
In 1999, the Northern Lights have returned to New York for the first time 
in three decades. By some freak accident of nature, this allows John to 
speak to Frank in 1969 via the ham radio. John manages to convince his 
father that he really is communicating from the future by predicting 
events of the Mets/Orioles World Series, and gives him enough information 
about the warehouse fire to save his life. But this changes the whole 
pattern of history, and not all for the good. Somehow, Frank's survival 
has meant that the so-called Nightingale Killer's death toll was ten 
instead of four -- and one of the "new" victims was John's mother 
Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell). Frank and John must cooperate across the 
years to stop the murderer in time.
"Frequency" is not a particularly deep movie. In a way it's about the 
relationship between fathers and sons, and how profoundly the absence of 
the former can affect the latter. And of course it deals with the 
familiar science-fiction notion of how changing one seemingly innocuous 
event can have major ramifications on things long after.
But, in the end, the real point of "Frequency" is just to tell a good 
story, and in this it excels. There are a lot of great scenes in which 
Frank and John's altering of history is explored, not on a 
pseudoscientific level but on a purely visceral one. The movie doesn't 
try to justify its temporal mechanics (indeed, there are some 
inconsistencies in how Frank's actions ripple down to his son), but just 
taps into our sense of the fantastic.
For example, at one point Frank communicates with John by burning a 
message into his desk. John sees the letters appear one by one and 
touches them, expecting to find them hot. But of course they're not, 
because they were made thirty years earlier. Later, Frank acquires a 
wallet with the murderer's fingerprints on it, but can't go to the police 
in 1969 because they'd never believe his story. So he hides the wallet 
beneath a loose floorboard, where John retrieves it in 1999. "Wow," 
breathes Frank, and he is speaking as much for the audience as for 
himself. While these sorts of things are nothing new to the genre, rarely 
have they been done so well and with such enthusiasm. And there are a 
couple of particularly imaginative sequences, especially a visually 
awesome one at the movie's climax.
The only real downside to "Frequency" is that the serial killer storyline 
which dominates its second half is rather pedestrian. This is not to say 
that it's badly done -- it's intriguing enough in its own way -- but it 
just doesn't live up to the wonder which permeates the rest of the movie. 
Scenes like one where Frank is arrested for being the Nightingale killer 
seem commonplace, for instance, and the proceedings generally feel as 
though they've been lifted out of an uncommonly bizarre episode of "Law 
And Order".
But even this is energised by excellent performances from Caviezel and 
particularly Quaid. "Frequency" lives or dies on the conviction of their 
father/son relationship, made more challenging by the fact that their 
communications aren't face-to-face. But both actors are up to the task, 
bringing genuine emotion to the story. As a result, it's easy to suspend 
our disbelief and buy into the movie, and it's hard to suppress a cheer 
when Frank survives the fire, or when father and son team up to stop the 
killer.
Director Gregory Hoblit does a good job, especially in keeping the
frequent and potentially dull scenes of Frank and John talking on the 
radio alive and interesting. Also, he wisely chooses not to overplay the 
changes father and son have wrought on the present. Although some 
differences are highlighted, many others are left as subtle background 
detail. Like "Back To The Future", this gives the film a richness it 
would otherwise be lacking.
"Frequency" has a broad appeal that's rare in movies today. It's a 
science-fiction movie where the characters come first, where visual 
effects take a backseat to story and acting, but which is exciting and 
suspenseful nonetheless. "Frequency" probably won't win any Academy 
Awards, but it was one of the most enjoyable cinematic experiences I've 
had in a long time. And, in the end, I can't ask for much more than that.

Title
Review for Pitch Black (2000)
Directed by David Twohy. Screenplay by Jim Wheat, Ken Wheat and Twohy.
Starring Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser. Running time: 108
minutes. Rated AA for offensive language and violent scenes. Reviewed on
March 16th, 2000.
My first exposure to "Pitch Black" came when the preview was played in 
front of "Girl, Interrupted" a month and a half ago. The preview hinted 
at monsters which lived on a sun-drenched planet but could only come out 
in the darkness. Then: "an eclipse!" How convenient, I thought; I could 
see the whole movie playing out in my mind. I held out some hope that 
the filmmakers might surprise me, but sadly, actually watching "Pitch 
Black" did not prove to be a revelatory experience. "Pitch Black" is 
indeed as improbable, formulaic and predictable as its preview implies.
The film is set sometime in the future. Men travel the stars in enormous 
ships, cryogenically frozen for the duration of the voyage. One such 
spaceship is knocked off course and crashlands, killing all but 
a handful of the passengers and crew. The survivors include docking pilot 
Caroline Fry (Radha Mitchell), uneasy with authority and plagued by 
self-doubts; no-nonsense mercenary William Johns (Cole Hauser); and 
Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), a convicted murderer.
The planet on which they are marooned has three suns, and as a result is 
a dry, blasted terrain without plants or water. Soon, though, the 
survivors discover evidence of a previous human expedition to the planet 
which appears to have been violently wiped out. The culprits soon become 
obvious: in underground caverns live hideous creatures which thrive in 
darkness and emerge onto the planet's surface only during a total solar 
eclipse, which in a feat of mathematical and physical improbability 
occurs like clockwork every twenty-two years. Of course, the cycle is 
almost up and soon the survivors find themselves under assault from wave 
upon wave of the terrifying, merciless monsters which are almost 
invisible in the pervasive darkness. Their only hope lies with the 
enigmatic Riddick, whose eyes have been surgically altered to permit him 
to see in the dark.
Convenient indeed. But to be fair, films have to be permitted a certain 
degree of latitude when it comes to such coincidences; without them, in 
many cases there just wouldn't be much of a movie. This is particularly 
true of science-fiction movies, which are so totally dependent on the 
imagined and the improbable to begin with. But such a leap of faith would 
be far easier to make if it were in the service of an entertaining movie. 
"Pitch Black" simply is not.
The entire movie is little more than one long, drawn-out chase scene. The 
characters have to get from Point A to Point B while avoiding the 
monsters, and there isn't much more to "Pitch Black" than that. The 
movie is punctuated only by a few token nods to character development, as 
well as the obligatory deaths which occur with almost comical timing. It 
is so easy to forecast right from the start the identity of those 
characters who survive to the end, it's criminal. This is a classic 
example of writing by the numbers; the screenplay by Jim Wheat, Ken Wheat 
and director David Twohy could just as easily have been generated by a 
computer program, it is so routine.
The best aspect of "Pitch Black" is the computer-animated special effects. 
There are some beautiful shots of the spaceship cruising past the rings 
of a Saturn-like planet, and of the onset of the solar eclipse. The 
monsters are also well-designed, although they do seem to owe something 
to "Alien". Twohy at least has the presence of mind to keep the monsters 
mostly out of sight for much of the film, adding to their sense of menace.
Even when they are fully unveiled, the lighting and camerawork keeps them 
indistinct. It's a shame, then, that "Pitch Black" utilizes them in such 
tired, unimaginative situations. They hammer against doors. They follow 
the party just out of sight in the darkness. They pop out of nowhere in an 
apparently empty corridor. There aren't many genuine frights here, and 
even the rare creepy moments are obvious and predictable.
Part of the movie's problem is that it develops few sympathetic 
characters to generate viewer interest. I found it difficult to be 
absorbed into the atmosphere of terror "Pitch Black" attempts to generate 
when I had absolutely no emotional investment in the characters 
whatsoever. I think it says something about the movie that of the three 
principals, the most sympathetic is the mass murderer, Riddick. Sort of a 
hunky Hannibal Lecter with super-powers, Diesel does a good job of making 
Riddick an intriguing anti-hero while not forgetting that he is, after 
all, still a criminal. Mitchell and Hauser, meanwhile, struggle futilely 
with their unmemorable, unlikeable characters. The rest of the ragtag 
band is largely forgettable, although Keith David does what he can with the 
underdeveloped role of the spiritual Imam.
"Pitch Black" is a dismal and tedious exercise in moviemaking, failing 
even to provide the requisite thrills and chills, let alone living up to 
the enormous potential of the science-fiction genre. Sci-f provides 
filmmakers with the opportunity to exercise the entire breadth of their 
vision and creativity, to do things no other genre permits. It is all the 
more unfortunate, then, to see a movie like "Pitch Black" dismiss this 
opportunity in favor of the banal and the ordinary. While the characters 
spend the entire movie running around the deathtrap planet, the audience 
is well advised to run in only one direction: away from the theater. 
Either that, or go into cryogenic sleep until "Pitch Black" is over.

Review for Wo hu cang long (2000)
CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (2000) / *** 1/2
   aka WO HU ZANG LONG [Mandarin; English subtitles]
Directed by Ang Lee. Screenplay by Hui-Ling Wang, James Schamus and Kuo
Jung Tsai, based on the novel by Du Lu Wang. Starring Chun-Yow Fat,
Michelle Yeoh, Ziyi Zhang. Running time: 120 minutes. Rated PG for mature
theme by the MFCB. Reviewed on January 28th, 2001.
Some movies exist to make an important statement, or to shed light on a 
matter of great urgency. Some movies exist just to provoke a basic 
reaction -- to make us laugh, or cry, or scared silly. And then there are 
the movies which exist simply to be watched, that are so visually 
exhilarating that all other matters fall by the wayside. "Crouching Tiger, 
Hidden Dragon" is such a movie.
Director Ang Lee has made a film which is not, in principle, very 
demanding. It is a legend, taking place in the China of two hundred years 
ago, when more modern sensibilities had yet to take hold in the country. 
Being a legend, it weaves a simple, classical tale of love, honour and 
revenge, although it is been populated with characters of unusual 
perception. Even those who misguidedly loathe subtitled films ("Crouching 
Tiger" is in Mandarin) should have little to complain about here; although 
the dialogue certainly adds to the proceedings, they are not difficult to 
follow even without it.
The main attraction of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", though, is quite 
simply the amazing sights Lee arrays before us. He is aided in this 
endeavour by cinematographer Peter Pau, designer Tim Yip, and fight 
choreographer Woo-ping Yuen (who has already dazzled audiences with his 
work on "The Matrix"). It is rare to encounter a movie which is such a 
feast for the eyes. The vistas of the Chinese landscape -- from lush 
valley to desert steppes -- are gloriously filmed, and the unique feel of 
early nineteenth century Beijing is captured impressively.
And then there are the fight scenes. It would be inaccurate to suggest 
that the only reason to see "Crouching Tiger" is because of the material 
arts sequences, but they are undoubtedly the pinnacle of its success. Lee 
and Yuen have managed to elevate fighting to the level of the finest 
ballet, a poetry of fist and foot. Whereas combat has become almost 
perfunctory in most action movies these days, here an evident combination 
of planning and inventiveness pays off wonderfully.
All of the fight sequences are great, but one in particular stands out in 
my mind. In it, the great Wudan warrior Li Mu Bai (Chun-Yow Fat) and his 
young opponent, Jen Yu (the "hidden dragon" of the title, played by Zhang 
Ziyi), stand on branches atop tall trees, which sway as they parley with 
their weapons. (The martial artists in "Crouching Tiger" possess a number 
of superhuman abilities, the most striking of which is the ability to leap 
astonishing distances. It may sound far-fetched, but given the 
mythological trappings of the picture, it works nicely.) Despite their
precarious circumstances, Li and Jen battle on, not just ignoring their 
unusual circumstances but in fact using the unlikely environment to their 
advantage.
This is the sort of scene, like the mindboggling opening shot of the Star 
Destroyer in "Star Wars" or Marlon Brando in "A Streetcar Named Desire" 
crying out Stella's name like a wounded animal, which sears itself 
instantly into the mind. So exquisite and fascinating is it to behold that 
it will not quickly be forgotten. Even more impressive, in this era of 
increasingly sophisticated technology, is the fact that Fat and Ziyi were 
really up there in the trees; computers were used only to erase the wires 
and harnesses from around them in post-production. This lends an 
authenticity to the scene which modern computer animation cannot yet 
reproduce.
The events which lead Li Mu Bai and Jen Yu to those treetops are not 
complicated. Li wishes to retire from active duty, despite the fact that 
he has never gained vengeance against Jade Fox, a duplicitous woman who 
slew his master years earlier. Li gives his ancient, powerful sword, Green 
Destiny, to his longtime friend and fellow mercenary Shu Lien (Michelle 
Yeoh from "Tomorrow Never Dies"; she's the eponymous "crouching tiger") to 
deliver to a politician in Beijing who has been an ally to them. Not long 
after Shu Lien arrives in the city, however, the Green Destiny is stolen.
The culprit turns out to be Jen, the daughter of a minister who is 
destined to soon enter into an arranged marriage. Jen chafes at the 
restrictions placed on her future and longs for the life of the warrior. 
(She is a perfect counterpart to Shu Lien, who shares an unspoken love for 
Li Mu Bai which they can never consummate, and who wishes to settle down 
and lead a quieter life.) Jen is secretly the promising apprentice of Jade 
Fox (Pei-pei Cheng), and when Li Mu Bai arrives in Beijing and learns of 
the theft of his blade, history may be doomed to repeat itself.
The visual majesty of "Crouching Tiger" is supported by several fine 
performances, with Yeoh a particular standout. Like any good legend, there 
is a pleasing variety in approach: despite all the melodrama and melee, 
Lee leaves room for humour, such as when Jen takes on an entire bar full 
of hostile warriors. And there is also an unmistakable vein of 
spirituality running throughout the film, as Lee seeks to examine the 
notion of identity -- one of the meanings of the title is a reference to 
aspects of one's own personality which can lie buried until finally coming 
to the fore.
If "Crouching Tiger" has its flaws, it is in terms of the storytelling, 
which is occasionally awkward. For example, in the middle of the movie is 
an extended flashback, revealing the origins of Jen's rebellion. As a 
self-contained entity, it's well-conceived, but it is an unwieldy fit at 
this point in the film, basically forcing the main action to come to a 
lengthy halt.
Regardless, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is a real treat. And it is a 
film which absolutely has to be seen to be appreciated. Much as one 
picture is worth a thousand words, no amount of text could possibly come 
close to describing the majesty and beauty of its images.

Review for Traffic (2000)
Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Screenplay by Stephen Gaghan, based on the
miniseries "Traffik" by Simon Moore. Starring Michael Douglas, Don
Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro. Running time: 147 minutes. Rated AA for
controversial subject matter and offensive language by the MFCB. Reviewed
on January 10th, 2001.
"Traffic" accomplishes a rare feat indeed. A movie about one of the most 
prevalent issues confronting modern society -- the drug trade -- it 
nonetheless manages to rise above simple proselytising and offers a 
brutally uncompromising, essentially unbiased perspective on its subject 
material. In a world where even the best dramas tend to take sides, this 
is remarkable; even more noteworthy is the fact that it happens within the 
confines of one of the most gripping films of the year.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh, and vastly superior to his crowd-pleasing 
but underachieving "Erin Brockovich", "Traffic" tells three stories about 
lives affected by drugs. These are tangentially connected, but mostly 
stand up on their own -- it would not be difficult to remove any of the 
plotlines from the movie and view those segments in isolation.
In one story arc, Michael Douglas plays Robert Wakefield, an Ohio judge 
who has been named by the President to be the nation's new drug czar -- 
the nominal head of America's war on illegal substances. But unbeknownst 
to Wakefield or his wife Barbara (Amy Irving), their own daughter Caroline 
(Erika Christensen) has been lured into the drug culture.
Meanwhile, Douglas' real-life bride Catherine Zeta-Jones stars as Helena 
Ayala, whose husband Carlos (Steven Bauer) is secretly one of the 
country's top importers of narcotics. This is revealed to Helena only when 
Carlos is arrested by Agents Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Castro (Luis Guzman) 
following the apprehension of a lower-level dealer (Miguel Ferrer). Helena 
is soon embroiled in Carlos' world when the cartel he worked with 
threatens their son's life to keep Carlos from betraying them to the 
authorities. The only help Helena can turn to seems scarcely preferable -- 
including Carlos' perfidious business partner (Dennis Quaid) and a cunning 
cartel head (Benjamin Bratt).
Finally, there is the tale of Mexican policeman Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez 
(Benicio Del Toro), who fights against drug trafficking from his side of 
the border. Javier becomes caught in a war between two cartels (one of 
them Bratt's) and discovers that neither his partner (Jacob Vargas) nor 
the army general who professes to Mexico's biggest anti-drug crusader 
(Tomas Milian) are as dedicated to the task as they would have him 
believe.
Soderbergh's direction stands out in "Traffic". He employs a rigid, 
realistic style which thrusts the audience directly into the drama. Events 
unfold at a sometimes feverish pace, but Soderbergh keeps things lucid, 
often helped by focussing on a handful of very strong characters. He also 
distinguishes each of the three plotlines by filming each of them (or 
rather, each of their principle locations) in a different style. The 
Washington and Ohio locales of the Wakefield storyline look cold and blue, 
reflecting both the bureaucratic nature of the judge's new environment and 
the downward spiral which has gripped his family. The Mexico scenes, on 
the other hand, look hazy and washed out, as though the sunlight is
raining down on the desert and barrios. And the California locations for 
the Ayala segments are more lushly, naturally lit.
Each of the storylines boasts a number of fine performances. Douglas is on 
the mark as a man who is expected to serve a nation, but who finds he 
cannot even help his own flesh and blood. His desperation, as the 
pressures of his job conflict with his desire to heal his family, is 
effectively conveyed. Del Toro, meanwhile, is excellent as a little fish 
in the big and tumultuous pond that is Mexico, unable to completely trust 
anyone and often finding himself on the side of those whose actions seem 
no better than the criminals'. 
Zeta Jones is less successful as Helena, her character lacking consistency 
from scene to scene. To an extent, this is because the entire California 
subplot feels a little rushed. Unlike the other two storylines, which 
chiefly concentrate on just one character (Judge Wakefield and Javier 
Rodriguez, respectively), Helena competes for attention with other 
individuals, most notably the entertaining double act of Gordon and 
Castro. Indeed, Cheadle brings such intensity to his role that it seems a 
shame he does not feature more prominently in the film. There is a lot 
happening in the Ayala segments -- legal maneuvering, financial 
maneuvering, Helena's efforts to deal with Carlos' cohorts, the agents'
investigation -- and at times it feels rushed and jumbled. 
The same cannot be said of the superb Mexico scenes, which offer a 
blistering look at the blurred line between those who run the country and 
those who run the drugs. Here we see how easy it can be for a lawman to 
abandon his duty and turn the other cheek -- not only because it can be 
tantalisingly lucrative to do so, but because the deck already seems so 
overwhelmingly stacked against him.
The story of the Wakefield family is probably the most familiar and 
accessible to mainstream audiences, and the tale of a girl hooked on drugs 
and unwilling to commit herself to rehab is nothing new. But "Traffic" 
depicts this subplot with such stark honesty that it is far more effective 
than most treatments of the material. What happens to Caroline is horrible 
and sobering. The explanation offered by her boyfriend (Topher Grace, from 
"That '70s Show") for the stranglehold drugs have on the population is 
equally so.
"Traffic" reaches no conclusions, favours no sides. Some aspects of the 
film support the controversial notion of legalising narcotics, and suggest 
that the drug war is futile and doomed to failure. Others offer a spark of 
hope that, slowly but surely, America is winning this most insidious of 
battles. In the end, it is not clear that current policy is at all 
effective, but nor is it indisputably misguided -- the possibility for 
both exists.
What "Traffic" does accomplish is simply to raise the level of awareness 
of just how complex an issue this really is. Politicians and activists who 
attempt to dismiss or address the problem with glib words and handy 
catchphrases are neither helping nor, increasingly, fooling anybody.
