Review for Normal Life (1996)
With the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up, loading
their guns, kissing each other and uttering what sounds like "Rock and
Roll!" (actually, it's "lock and load"), you can't help thinking
Tarantino.  And of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in
love who turn to violent bank robbery, the film unapologetically takes
its place alongside all those other films from BONNIE & CLYDE to
NATURAL BORN KILLERS.   But if most of those movies have their roots in
pulp fiction, exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run,
NORMAL LIFE takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the
phenomenon.  "Inspired by true events" -- we've heard that one before,
and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly
demonstrated ... or so strangely poignant.  For this is a story of real
people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality, who in their
search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged.
Beginning with their final arrest, the film goes back to trace the
relationship between Chris (Luke Perry), a policeman, and Pam (Ashley
Judd), a factory worker. They fall in love and marry, but Pam's
increasingly erratic behaviour (going on spending sprees, slashing
herself with a knife after an argument) begin to trouble the solid and
stable Chris.  When Chris gets sacked, they find themselves heavily in
debt and near breaking up.  Then, Chris begins to rob banks ...
Luke Perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly
forget that he was ever in Beverly Hills 90210 or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE
SLAYER.  Moustached, with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and
eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation, he is perfectly cast
as the long-suffering husband. (It's another of John McNaughton's coups
of casting-against-type, after transforming Robert de Niro into nerd
and Bill Murray into gangster in MAD DOG AND GLORY).
But it is the character of Pam who commands centrestage, and Ashley
Judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity
and tenderness, making Pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating
person.  If the performance falls short of greatness, however, it is
perhaps because the role of the Mad Woman has been done so often before
it is virtually a staple of cinema, whether it's in BETTY BLUE, TOM &
VIV or GEORGIA.  As in those movies, there's the danger that the
performance seems mannered, a collection of screwy tics and tantrums
designed for the Oscar presentation piece.  Judd doesn't entirely avoid
this pitfall, but Pam's 'craziness' is best and most movingly presented
in counterpoint to the more 'normal' Chris.  When Pam reacts to her
father-in-law's death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and
blaring headphones, Chris' face is the picture of pained restraint.
Of course, it's the question of what is 'normal' that is asked in
NORMAL LIFE.  McNaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the
aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with
insanity.  It is the rational Chris that loves guns ("Shooting is about
precision, control") and the 'crazy' Pam that loves astronomy and
yearns for a dog (who is then called Chaos -- "Chaos and you and me
...  we're a real family", she notes wryly).  It is Chris' methodical
mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a
successful bank robber (his well-planned disguise as a bearded, roaring
man of terror is another piece of Method in madness).   In the carpark
where he sets out for his first robbery, a huge sign on a shopping mall
stands out in the background :"BUY-MORE" -- the perfectly respectable
consumption-crazy American dream that has driven Pam to her extravagant
purchases, and both of them into desperate situations.
It's not a perfect film. Some of the dialogue is a touch too banal
(perhaps intentionally?).  The use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in
Pam's crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional
disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from
the rest of the film.  Indeed, as in McNaughton's seminal film HENRY :
PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, it is the avoidance of glamour or
sensationalism, the denial of some of the standard thrills of the
outlaw film genre, that gives this determinedly unflashy, moving film
its great strengths.
McNaughton has filmed this story with a quiet, coolly 'realistic'
method that works far better than any NBK theatrics at unsettling the
viewer.  The suburbs, with their miles of white-fenced houses and
identikit malls, take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness. In its
very different way, this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide
open spaces in Terence Malick's BADLANDS.  While Pam shares the
yearnings of Malick's heroes to escape from ordinary life, Chris takes
up crime precisely so that they can lead a 'normal life' - their little
house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies.  But these
are dreams defined by, constrained by, and even doomed by, the
limitations of the 'normal', conventional world.  Pam's final scene
takes place at the edge of the suburbs, where wild bushes grow --
symbolically the frontier, the outer limits of her society, but also
quite literally the end of the road, where there is nowhere left to go
but to the final tragic denouement.
THE FLYING INKPOT's rating system:
 * Wait for the video.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.

Review for Kingpin (1996)
Directed by: Peter Farrelly and Bob Farrelly  
Written by: Barry Fanaro and Mort Nathan
Cast :  Bill Murray, Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, Vanessa Angel
Produced by : Brad Krevoy, Steve Stabler and Bradley Thomas
Rating : * out of *****
Theatres: Shaw Cinemas 
        According to the publicity material, with this movie the directors "hope to 
restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of American 
consciousness." Hmm.  You never know, they just might be on to something.  What 
with the rise of geek chic, lounge music and Seventies fashion,  the ever-contrary kids 
of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of 
Tackyana to claim as their own.  But then, I doubt if KINGPIN will have anything to 
do with it.  It's cheesy all right, but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film 
exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true 
kitsch.  
        That's a shame, because, in the first ten minutes or so the film promises 
to be a lot more. Woody Harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise, Roy Munson.  
The movie opens in the Fifties with Roy's Dad dishing out the Reader's Digest/Gumpian 
wisdom in scoopfuls, shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of Saturday Night Fever. 
The sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of Bill Murray, 
as the delectably slimy Big Ern Mcracken.  It's thanks to Murray that the first quarter 
of KINGPIN seems so good - he gives the wry, derisive edge to this otherwise rather 
unfocused comedy.
        McCracken dupes Munson into a hustling job, then abandons him to an angry 
mob who mangle Roy's hand.  Then it's fast forward 17 years later when Munson is a 
fat, balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand.  He's hopeless until he meets Ishmael 
(Randy Quaid), an Amish amateur bowler that Munson takes on as protege.  So 
together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in Reno, picking up 
pretty hustler Claudia (Vanessa Angel) on the way. 
        With the exit of Bill Murray, the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to 
go, and that's ...  DUMB AND DUMBER.  Yes, indeed, KINGPIN is brought to you 
by those modern proponents of laxative humour,  Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the 
directors of the aforementioned Jim Carrey vehicle.  So, prepare for much slaparound 
comedy with flying rubber hands, distended nipples, ridiculous hair and bull semen.   
Get set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy Roy puts on a beard and 
tries to blend in with the Amish community, or when suaku straitlaced Ishmael takes 
on smoking, striptease and unChristian neighbour-socking.  
        Now, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with cheap humour, and I 
had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with Woody and Randy.  The trouble is that 
these jokes aren't bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without 
much sense of direction.  It lurches from sports movie to Amish-mocking to road-trip 
to sentimental melodrama, (pausing for a broadside spoof of  INDECENT 
PROPOSAL, and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack), never 
quite getting it all together.   Some gags fall flat from a lack of  build-up, while 
there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don't do anything.  Why the long, 
unfunny fight in the car park?  Why TWO of these?  Why does that guy wear mascara, or 
that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it?   The film is full of these 
half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer, grip or makeup 
artist throwing in random stuff and saying, "wouldn't that be funny?".  Well, no, 
actually.
        The actors don't do the movie much favours either.   Woody Harrelson comes 
off okay, plausibly acting dumb, smart, cynical or innocent when the implausible script 
calls for it, but Randy Quaid is a ceaseless ham, and Vanessa Angel has no talent (like 
Schwarzenegger, she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a 
human -- take the TV series Weird Science...please ).  Even Murray hams it up when 
he reappears in the movie's climax.
        All in all, a fairly useless attempt at comedy, and a certified no-hoper at 
kickstarting the Bowling Renaissance.  We'll have to look to a reinspired John Waters, 
or perhaps somebody from Down Under ("Strictly Bowling", anyone?) for the 
definitive bowling comedy.

Review for Secrets & Lies (1996)
Directed by: Mike Leigh
Produced by: CiBy 2000/Thin Man Films/Channel 4 Films.
Cast: Timothy Spall (Maurice), Phyllis Logan (Monica), Brenda Blethyn
(Cynthia), Claire Rushbrook (Roxanne), Marianne Jeane-Baptiste
(Hortense)
Run Time:141 minutes
Rating: ****1/2 out of *****
Theatres: Lido
Jarvis Cocker of Pulp once said that he wrote Common People after
noticing Mike Leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling
that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the
well-off. Maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to
see Jarvis' own lyrics (obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the
wall) as a fetishization of lowlife, rather than Leigh's films. But
it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of
working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity',
let alone a good film. It's the triumph of SECRETS & LIES, then, that
it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a
probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in
everyday lives.
Following her adopted mother's funeral, Hortense, a young
black optometrist, sets out to find her birth mother, and is disturbed
to find out that she is white. It is Cynthia, a factory worker who
lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter Roxanne.
Cynthia's younger brother Maurice is a successful photographer who has
not seen his sister for ages, largely because of his wife's animosity
towards her. Hortense calls up Cynthia, who initially breaks down in
tears and refuses to see her. But their mutually suspicious meeting
gives way to a warm friendship eventually. Cynthia invites Hortense to
come along to a party, which Maurice is hosting...
SECRETS & LIES has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one
character puts it, "Best to tell the truth, isn't it? That way nobody
gets hurt.". But if the film delivers much more than a trite message,
it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly
truths, even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke
us.
Hence, Cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging (first to herself, then
to others) that Hortense is her daughter. One of her first reactions
to seeing Hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever "been with a
black man", before a long-suppressed memory seizes her. At the party,
Cynthia's pretense that Hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to
ever more convoluted lies, as agonizing as they are funny.
Little lies seep into every corner, like Maurice pretending that he's
"just dropping by" when he visits Cynthia after much deliberation.
Maurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side
comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that Maurice coaxes
to smile, a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring
and argue about his spectacles. One of the most startling images is of
a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs
the photo to look "as bad as possible" to collect insurance money, yet
the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies
behind the scars.
There are occasionally hilarious moments, as when Cynthia attempts to
give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception, "I've got a
Dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs"; or when Cynthia stares
at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells Roxanne, "If you've got
it, flaunt it, is what I say."
As played by Brenda Blethyn, Cynthia comes close to being a
caricature, with her nervous, somewhat disconnected way of talking.
But she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires
sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her, precisely
because she's so needy of love, perhaps. Indeed, the whole cast gives
warmly rounded, detailed performances. The script was developed partly
through improvisations, and the fusion of cast, script and director
shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the
same time, and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout.
In a very different way, but also using a long single shot, the scene
of Hortense and Cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8A achieves a
touching intensity, all the more for their reticence and unspoken
feelings.
The film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out
in Ibsen-esque revelations, and everybody hugging each other - is the
one thing that seems false about this film. However, it's a film that
truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the
character's lives. When Cynthia says near the end, This is the life,
innit?, you get the sense that, following the cynicism of his last
film NAKED, Leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all,
without comforting illusions.

Review for Stealing Beauty (1996)
Mmm, isn't Jeremy Irons lovely?  How he moves, how he talks, how his
saliva falls on to the hard rocky ground.  His svelte, skeletal frame,
his eyes that look at you with impossibly nosy curiosity, the way he
sucks with asthmatic ecstasy on a cigarette.  He speaks French, he
speaks Italian, and he's dying. Could anything be sexier?
Well, there's Liv Tyler of course. She glides through the film beguiling
everyone, whether she's in a swimsuit or a horrible frilly dress,
whether she's dancing, smiling blankly at social occasions or solemnly
writing her diary. And actually, she's pretty good, too.  Tyler is a
natural at playing the American beauty Lucy Harmon, poised between
adolescent gawkiness and adult self-awareness, who comes into an Italian
village to stay with family friends.
Lucy is aware of her beauty, flirting with it, toying with her role as
the pretty young thing amidst the old, the jaded and the sleazy.  Yet
she is still in the process of getting used to the attentions of men,
and more importantly, finding out what she wants and who she is.  A
double quest unfolds in the course of the film: one, to lose her
virginity, and two, to find out more about her mother's past, perhaps
even to discover her true father.
Aiding and abetting her in the first quest is Jeremy Irons, oozing his
uniquely foxlike charm out of every dying pore. As an invalid and old
person, he plays the part eunuch mentor to Lucy, but his busy probings
into her love life are a strange mix of leering, paternal and camp.  His
interests in her remain ambiguous to the end, when he falls sick and has
to be hospitalised soon after Lucy takes a man home.
STEALING BEAUTY could have been an interesting exploration of virginity,
innocence and experience. And with its dual search for absent fathers
and lovers, it nearly manages an incisive look at how a young woman's
identity is dependent on male figures, and on male constructions of the
female image (hinted at in the opening scene of a strange man
videotaping Liv Tyler sleeping in the train).
Unfortunately, Bertolucci's film touches on these themes but never goes
into them with much depth or energy.  The search for Lucy's first love
never rises much above the level of your typical teen movie. Indeed a
film like CLUELESS had a more ironic and revealing take on teen love,
poking fun at its conventions even while revelling in them.  By
contrast, STEALING BEAUTY seems to take all too seriously characters
like the sleazy American hunk, the cute-but-insincere Italian, the drunk
Englishman, and the truly-sincere-sensitive-shy guy.  Does Bertolucci
somehow expect us to see this string of cardboard figures as steps in
Liv Tyler's voyage of sexual awakening?
Perhaps the problem with the film is that it shares rather too much of
the teenager's perspective, with the adolescent's self-absorption and
exaggerated seriousness.   Hence the 'adult' characters surrounding Lucy
never quite take on a life of their own, seemingly spending all of their
time thinking and talking about her.  Rather than offering contrasting,
ironic perspectives on her character, they only seem to indulge her
sense of self-importance. And the scenes of Lucy writing in her diary,
supposedly our window into her inner life, look like MTV (or, worse,
KTV) ballad-sequences, with white handwriting gracefully squiggling
across the screen and Tyler's faux-naif girlish voice talking to us (be
warned: these contain scenes of graphic teen poetry).
But to carp too much on the shallowness of STEALING BEAUTY is really to
miss the pleasures of watching this movie. As in his previous films,
Bertolucci excels at providing manifold feasts for the eyes.  Here,
joined by hipper-than-hip cinematographer Darius Khondji (SEVEN, CITY OF
LOST CHILDREN), he gives us lush Tuscan landscapes, beautiful life-size
wood sculptures, kisses in a sunset-drenched meadow, Liv Tyler emerging
from a pool seemingly chiselled from marble (the pool, that is), Jeremy
Irons removing his cap to show a thin veil of grey hair.  There are
times when the images take on a stunning, iconic flair all their own, as
in the scenes of some beguilingly bizarre dancing at a party.  It is
actually not that hard to lose yourself in the simple charms of this
film, to get into the easygoing, gently interested pace of the plot, and
to even feel for Liv Tyler as she goes looking for love in all the most
photogenic places -- just don't take too seriously the pretensions of
the film to being anything complex or profound.
