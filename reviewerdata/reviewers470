Title
Review for Kundun (1997)
        With its unlimited budgets and nearly perfect technological mastery,
the real surprise of Hollywood might be why more films like Kundun don't
get made? (If you had the God-like power to create absolutely anything,
presumably you wouldn't confine yourself to bringing comic books to
life.)
        Kundun is the view from a time machine. If we'd had contemporary
technology faithfully recording the sights and sounds of the young Dalai
Lama's life in remote Tibet 50 years ago, we probably couldn't have
preserved a better record than what Martin Scorsese has created
after-the-fact. Kundun has that feel.
        Scorsese has performed a Hollywood trick, of course. He didn't actually
have a time machine. But, given that, and given that the acting is done
by non-actor Tibetans, and that the story (unlike Amistad, or The
Titanic, or Seven Years in Tibet) is painstakingly (NOT painfully, but
PAINSTAKINGLY) faithful to the historical record, Scorsese's is a much
trickier trick than animating Flubber or keeping Double-Oh-Seven
unscarred. Scorsese has informed this trick with a talent rare enough to
be genius. 
        Kundun is not, by any means, a flawless movie, but it makes you realize
what there is to be grateful for when commerce can bring us these
splendid tricks of light. Wealth and technology are not enough: we have
to be grateful to Hollywood for allowing Scorsese to surface and
succeed; we have to be grateful to Disney for having the corporate
courage to ignore the Chinese government's strong opposition to this
film; and we have to be grateful to Scorsese for his talent.  (And,
perhaps, too, we have to be grateful to the Dalai Lama. This visual
poetry is his life, after all. Or, at least, one of his lives.)
