Title
Review for Vanishing, The (1993)
     Well, I caught the opening of THE VANISHING last night.  I haven't
seen the original European film yet, but I imagine it's infinitely :^)
better than this Hollywood remake.
     I found the characters to be flat, without substance, especially
Barney (Jeff Bridges).  Perhaps the whole point of his character was
that you weren't *supposed* to understand it, but if that was the
director's intention, it certainly wasn't successful.  
     The first two-thirds of the movie were incredibly slow--not the
good kind of slow, where you can feel the tension building for the
movie's climax, but the bad kind of slow, where you just sit back and
have to say, "God, get on with it, will you?"
     The relationship between Rita, the waitress, and Jeff was also
completely without substance.  There was no chemistry between them
whatsoever, and although I wasn't quite sure how long they had been
involved before moving in together, the way they related to each other
was like complete strangers.  Again, perhaps this was intentional, since
it was necessary to the plot for Jeff to keep his big secret from her,
but it also wasn't successful.
     The role of Barney's family was pretty unnecessary, except that
there had to be a daughter so that the ending could turn out the way it
did.  Apart from that, there was almost no point in introducing them in
the first place.  There was potential there, however, to have his family
play a more important and developed role, especially with regards to
what motivated Barney to commit his crimes, and especially go to with
the "go past the edge" theme.  But again, no development here, and the
"what's the point?" feeling came back.
     But the worst part had to be the ending.  Apart from being
gratuitously bloody and revengeful, it was completely predictable, very
Hollywood.  What really got me at the end was that Jeff, having gotten
out of his burial box with the help of Rita and having killed
(presumably) Barney, simply looked at a nearby mound (coffin-shaped
mound, like his was), assumed that it was Diane that was buried there,
and looked relieved.  I couldn't quite grasp this.  Here he had spent the
past three or four years looking for Diane, not knowing anything about
how she vanished, where she was, whether she was alive or dead, and how
she had died (if she had), and the "not-knowing" was supposed to be the
driving force of his life up until that point.  He also knows that
Barney had tried to capture other women.  So, it could have been anyone
buried in that mound--why didn't Jeff look, just to be sure?  Wouldn't it
rest his conscience, as well as relieve his curiosity, to just dig up
the mound and make sure it *was* her?  I think that if they had done that,
it would also have cemented the ending of the movie.  (But that's
another Hollywood thing--you always have to leave room for a sequel.)
     On the positive side, the music was great (especially the requisite
"thriller music" during the scary parts), and the scenery of Washington
State was also fabulous.  I think it would have been much more effective
had the gas station/ MiniMart been in a really remote section of
highway, with forests and mountains all around, to give a real sense of
"vanishing into nowhere."  Where she *did* vanish in the movie was
pretty populated--one McDonalds, a Dairy Queen, plus a couple of gas
stations and *lots* of people around.  Too much hustle and bustle to be
effective.
