Title
Review for UHF (1989)
     Just saw UHF last night at a packed sneak preview at MIT.  I always wonder
if the free ticket and the rowdy crowd influences me at such previews, but I
truly enjoyed the film.  Of course it is really stupid but so was AIRPLANE, a
movie that you could easily compare UHF to.
     The movie was very funny with lots of sight gags, and it didn't stall very
often (in my humble opinion).  The beginning is very funny, with his parody of
Indy Jones, and of course one of the best moments had to be a song.  Weird Al's
version of "Money for Nothing" will leave you rolling, one of his best yet.
     Plot is simple: Weird Al takes over a loser TV station and makes it a
winner with such programs as "Wheel of Fish," "Wide World of Phlegm," and "The
Young and the Dyslexic."  Their star is the former janitor at the dreaded
Channel 8 which tries to put them out of business.  As in AIRPLANE, the plot is
a parody--"Just stand up and tell them ... .we're not going to take any dirty
floors!"
     Of course the crowd fave at MIT was the engineer!  And everyone went
berserk over a line which most others will think mildly amusing : "Congrats:
You just won a drink from the firehose."  Explanation: getting an education at
MIT is often likened to trying to drink from a firehose!
     Well, overall this was as good as AIRPLANE, but I'm sure a lot of people
won't like the silly type of humor, and might feel their 6 bucks wasted.  Who
cares!  It was free for me, and I laughed the whole night.
