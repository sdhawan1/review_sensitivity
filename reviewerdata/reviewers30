Title
Review for Street Trash (1987)
     First, I have to mention a disclaimer.  The budget of this gem is low.
The acting is poor.  The characters are unsympathetic, to put it mildly.  The
script is mediocre.  All in all, the technical quality is uniformly poor.
Fortunately, this is not why one would go see this movie.
     The basic premiss of this movie is that there is a case of tainted liquor
going around which is killing bums who buy or steal the stuff.  Tainted in the
sense that syphilis is mildly unpleasant.  The effect of this potent drink is
that it causes people to melt in a multi-colored and truly spectacular way.
But since there is only a limited supply of the stuff, the writers have the
bums mutilate each other to fill time.  The violence is so explicit and
thorough that it was personally surprising that it was not released with an X
rating.  I guess it was a small release and slipped through.  Despite the
violence, I found myself laughing loudly quite a lot.
     Only once in a while does a flick of this magnitude wander along.  Other
comparable titles are ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES and TEXAS CHAINSAW
MASSACRE.  I indeed feel fortunate for having seen it before it slipped away.
I'm sorry I have no more information other than the title, and it will be gone
before long, so seek it out.
