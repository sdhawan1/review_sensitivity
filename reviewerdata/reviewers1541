Title
Review for Mortal Kombat (1995)
Rating: 2.5/4  (Not nearly as bad as STREETFIGHTER.)
Preview:
     Saw the one hour making of/preview on cable, turns out they shot
on location in Thailand.  The guy who plays Liu Kang is in/famous for
many movies in Hong Kong, and he also helped choreograph a bunch of the
fighting.
     The guy who plays badass Shang Tsung is REALLY REALLY famous,
you'll recognize him easily.
     The documentary was interesting, and the walkthroughs of the sets
were nice--they put a *lot* of detail into 'em, and then you see'm for
30 seconds of the movie.
     Christopher Lambert (McCloud from Highlander) plays RAIDEN.
     Goro was entirely computer generated as every four armed badass
should be, but he wasn't utilized to his full potential.
     The plot kinda dragged, they went out of their way to explain WHY
there is this tournament, and WHY everyone has to kick/punch the shit
out of each other, but who cares right?  Get on with the fighting
already!
     And when it comes time to fight, some of these guys get wasted too
quick....
     I'd seen STREETFIGHTER the movie (rental) and was so thoroughly
dissapointed, but after seeing the previews, I knew this one couldn't
suck *that* bad....
     I guess it helped to be surrounded by a hundred kids yelling
"DAMN!", "Kick his ass! Yeah!" and "FINISH HIM!"
     To its credit, it kept a fairly quick pace, and the *music* really
punched it along!  Check out the soundtrack!
     Go see it *soon*, while the theatre will be full of screaming kids
and they'll have the soundtrack turned up to max and you should enjoy
it.
