Title
Review for Thin Red Line, The (1998)
Review of "A Thin Red Line" by Martin Gruber      lightwav@ix.netcom.com
How about the first film I've wanted to walk out on this year. Terrence
Malick's wanna-be epic tale of a World War II platoon is both boring and
confusing, and this, his first film in the last 20 years since "Days of
Heaven" is quite a disappointment. 
The problem with the film is that its been done before and offers nothing
new to the audience. We saw shell shocked veterans in the "Deer Hunter" and
"Apocalypse Now", we saw the gore in "Saving Private Ryan", and we saw the
politics and controversy in "Platoon", so why did Malick try to shove it
all into one. He smothers us with poetic philosophy, and drowns us with
"would-be" meanings. 
The only thing good about this film is the fact I honor that the actors
could turn out great performances with such a mediocre script, and the fact
that this film was beautifully shot under the direction of John Toll who
also did "Braveheart" and "The Rainmaker". The ensemble cast would have
made this movie fantastic if it hadn't been for Malick's poor idea,
screenplay and direction. It wasn't just me, after leaving the theater
people were shaking their heads and commenting on how slow and boring it
was. Dragging on forever I give this movie a C-, only because of the great
performances by all the actors who wasted their time with this film.
