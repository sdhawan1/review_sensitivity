Title
Review for Sherman's March (1986)
     SHERMAN'S MARCH is an interesting, somewhat offbeat movie by an indie
filmmaker.  A brief summary follows:
Scene New York:
     Young struggling filmmaker from the South gets a grant to make a
documentary about General Sherman's devastating march through the South.
Before he can start, however, his girlfriend dumps him and throws his life into
chaos.  He figures a trip through the South is just what he needs and so off he
goes with camera on shoulder throughout the entire trip.  
Scene 'The South":
     His family--somewhat distressed by his still single status--immediately
introduces him to every eligible (and somewhat wacky) girl they can think of....
     The movie eventually becomes a three-hour cinema verite' excursion into
life, love, survivalists, Southern Americana and even occasionally General
Sherman's march....  It's fun and funny--the limited narrative is very
understatedly and dead-pan funny--but it is a bit long and does drag toward the
end.  Overall I would recommend it, especially if you have any experience (or
interest) in making films, home videos, etc.
     I guess that's about it...hope you can find it--I don't think it was
shot being intended for general release....
