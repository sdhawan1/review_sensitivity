Title
Review for McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971)
 A young gunslinger stands on one end of a suspension bridge. On the other end,
a kind, young man (Keith Carradine) who simply wants to cross the bridge. The
gunslinger won't let him; he obstructs, badgering the poor fellow. The young
man has revealed his weakness; he doesn't want any trouble. Though the
gunslinger is eager to test him, and push him so he could kill him, which he
does.
"Let me see your gun," the gunslinger demands.
The young man stammers slightly before reluctantly pulling it out, with no
intention of using it. The gunslinger shoots the young man dead, as the
denizens of the town look on. The moment is directed with such casualness that
it feels more authentic than any kinetic gun battle Peknipah staged. Both of
the actors chosen for the minor parts add additional layers to the scene. The
kid who plays the gunslinger has harmless, cherubic features, resembling a
younger, chubbier Leonardo Di Caprio. This makes his actions appear much more
disturbing than if a more macho actor had played him. We get the feeling that
this kid has been raised in a culture where killers are lionized, and cowardice
is despised. He has found a prey that is weaker than him; therefore it would be
foolish not to attack. He's like a child playing COWBOYS AND INDIANS, only for
real. Keith Carradine acts so kind, and endearingly, it's dismaying to see him
die because of those very qualities. I think the scene's ultimate effectiveness
lies in its jarring placement. It happens mid-way through the film, and has
nothing to do with the "story". But it also has everything to do with it.
McCABE AND MRS.MILLER is a Western, though unlike most. Its "hero" is indeed a
mysterious stranger who rides into town as mysterious strangers often do in
Westerns. He's also a drunk, and a gambler, with little honor; he's not above
shooting an enemy in the back. Julie Christie plays his "love interest", a
surreptitious, drug-addicted madam with an incentive towards cash that
supersedes everything else. She is a hooker, and one with a heart of coal.
These cleverly employed details (details that turn the usual cliches upside
down and inside out) are trademarks of a director partial to deconstructing a
genre rather than perpetuating it. Robert Altman does just that, exploding
Western myths and putting his own in there place. This was a common practice of
directors in the mid-1970's. Speilberg did a similar deconstruction of the
action-adventure genre with JAWS.
The setting of McCABE is a dilapidated frontier town blanketed with mud and
snow. Interiors are dully lit by gas lamps, illuminating dirty faces with a
vague, red-yellow hue. Nothing is idealized in Altman's vision, not even the
hookers, who look just as dirty as the town.
The film was based on a conventional Western novel, written by Edmund Naughton.
Altman lobotomized the novel, taking it's basic story and improvising his way
through it, as is his style. This particular method has produced some
masterpieces (M*A*S*H, SHORT CUTS), and just as many abysmal failures (QUINTET,
READY TO WEAR). True to Altman's form, much of the speech is purposely muddied,
and occasionally words are drowned out by other words. The dialogue is
conversational (one man asks another if he should trim his facial hair), and
often amusingly so; we're not used to seeing characters make small talk in a
Western. This is the antithesis of a generic Sergio Leone flick; it's like
viewing a slice of life that just happens to take place in a Western setting.
Because of this, the plot points seem to come informally and not always when
expected.
Warren Beatty plays McCabe as a stubborn anti-hero with an unflappable cool the
actor can't seem to shake. Beatty's persona is an intermittent parody of a
traditional leading man, and a rendering of one. He speaks in a fearlessly
controlled tone, conveying his self-righteousness. And that self-righteousness
is his characters' inevitable downfall.
Julie Christie plays the madam (McCabe's business partner), Mrs.Miller. When
the two meet, they immediately dislike each other, trading insults as most
future lovers often do in the movies. We naturally expect them soften up, and
fall in love. That never happens, though they do have cold, calculated sex.
They're relationship doesn't go were it is "supposed" to, and I am forever
thankful for both of they're fates. Altman closes his film with some
understated, lyrically profound shots that are haunting and poignant.
To call McCABE a simple exercise in genre deconstruction would be a
misrepresentation. It's a work that is alive with emotion and lyricism.
Altman's greatest films have much in common; they rely on naturalistic,
meandering encounters, languidly building to a substantial close. And it works
the best when the characters are fascinating and multifaceted. That is the case
with this film. The seemingly inconsequential moments add up to something very
consequential.

Title
Review for Hollow Man (2000)
Screenplay: Andrew W. Marlowe, Gary Scott Thompson
Starring: Kevin Bacon, Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, William Devane, Greg 
Grunberg, Joey Slotnick, Mary Jo Randle, Steve Altes, Rhona Mitra
Paul Verhoeven, the Dutch auteur who dragged his violent, sexually aggressive 
aesthetic into American film, has never been what I'd consider a thoughtful 
director (though some of his films, notably STARSHIP TROOPERS, have been 
lauded as artistic achievements), but he is the kind of Hollywood film maker 
who's managed to, no matter what the budget, make his films distinctive and 
even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on 
which he toils. STARSHIP TROOPERS was essentially a B-monster movie remake of 
his enthralling Dutch War film SOLDIER OF ORANGE (a great film that's nearly 
impossible to find on video, yet SHOWGIRLS is everywhere), in which he cast a 
troop of stunningly attractive mannequins; the square jawed Casper Van Dien 
and Denise Richards (who may actually be 45% silicone), in what feels like an 
American propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage. It's 
not a completely successful film, but as a 
failure it's certainly an interesting (and mostly entertaining) one.
My favorite Verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores; 
SPETTERS, a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the 
sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned SOLDIER OF ORANGE (haven't 
yet gotten around to seeing THE 4th MAN or TURKISH DELIGHT). I believe his 
best Hollywood film to be ROBOCOP, a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic 
hero that's as touching as Schwarzenegger's in T2. That movie was violent but 
not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent Verhoeven pics. Its 
violence seemed to be there for a purpose, namely to create an atmosphere of 
unpredictable dread, not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience. 
There's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of ROBOCOP wherein 
the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him. He tortures the officer 
by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic. It's a startling moment of 
barbaric, maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that 
could be designated as splatter punk-noir.
In HOLLOW MAN Kevin Bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up, 
he impales a co-worker, drowns another and so on. But why? His character is 
introduced as a smug genius, the kind who's always impeccably dressed and 
races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the 
world to hear, sort of like a scheming uber villain from DALLAS or MELROSE 
PLACE, though once the character becomes invisible, this film has him pull a 
180 shift into a psychotic movie monster. The kind who just won't die. HOLLOW 
MAN's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist Linda 
(Elizabeth Shue, acting as if she were Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm) and her 
lover, a hunk of beef scientist played by Josh Brolin who's saddled with the 
film's worst lines ("I've lost cohesion again!"). They're a typical Aaron 
Spelling couple, good-looking but as vacant as George W. Bush's Republican 
National Convention speech (i.e. Bush referring to Clinton; "…so much 
promise…but to what end? To what end?"-- this actually got applause! Suddenly 
Warren Beatty doesn't look so absurd). The rest of the film's characters are 
all well past thirty, though act like annoying high school party animals 
insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners; Is it just me 
or have labored insults become Big Budget Hollywood's new character 
developing technique? Ahh, what a cynical time we live in…
As the picture opens we meet Cain (Kevin Bacon), an egocentric scientist 
working with the crew of 
aforementioned irritating scientists on a Top Secret (so Top Secret the 
government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to 
perform their extensive experimentation's) project with the goal to make 
invisibility a possibility (for what purpose is never hinted at). They've 
performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary 
causing Caine, in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's Late Show origins, to 
impulsively experiment on himself. Caine neglects to let the Pentagon in on 
his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest 
of the crew will think the Pentagon gave the go ahead. Our mad scientist is 
turned invisible (after several FX-heavy complications), then he inexplicably 
(it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more 
savage creatures, but this is never explored, and if that was the case why 
the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human?) begins 
raping, assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases, always with a lame 
wisecrack ready a la Freddy Krueger.
It grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's Verhoeven's films 
that have become hollow. Like the rest, this one is cold, heartless, and full 
of contempt for humanity, but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of 
wit, insight and makes no statement other than "audiences will pay for 
anything these days". It's an affront to anyone looking for something 
stimulating on an intellectual level, or even those hoping to spend a 
Saturday night with a fun, thrill-a-minute ride. Verhoeven has instead served 
up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason 
to care.
The previews make HOLLOW MAN look like an irresistible flick. How can one not 
have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art FX to illustrate an 
invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self? A couple weeks ago, 
after seeing the trailer, a bunch of friends and I got into a long discussion 
of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible 
individual indulging in their newfound ability. HOLLOW MAN looked like the 
first film to do so and whoa, in a serious manner to boot. But oh yeah, it is 
directed by Paul Verhoven not Atom Egoyan or Peter Greenway. Verhoeven 
delivers the sleazy "goods", but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing 
manner, here it just feels icky and uncomfortable. The director keeps his 
camera trained at his nubile actresses, caressing their breasts with his lens 
all while faux-PSYCHO music strains in the background. It's plainly obvious 
that Verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism (like in the classic PEEPING TOM) 
but exploiting it and not even doing that very well. It's funny that with all 
the technology $90 million can get you Verhoven is stuck at trying to figure 
out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand.
Most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet 
another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain 
can pop up for more attacks. In fact it's largely irrelevant that Bacon is 
invisible since, by the end, most of his potential victims don infer-red 
glasses that track his body heat. As in every Mad Slasher film we get the 
killers POV (a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses 
triggered unpleasant memories of SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE), and lots of scenes 
where people are unknowingly stalked.
The film only provides one moment that I found genuinely creepy. It happens 
when a lab assistant (Kim Dickens, who looks like she stepped out of Playboy) 
in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible Bacon, suddenly pauses. "Are 
you looking at me?", she queries, obviously haunted. It's a little moment in 
a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a 
plot that should have run its course by 1982 (the apex of the Mad Slasher 
craze). Those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being 
as bad as URBAN LEGEND or I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. And they're 
the only reason to check out HOLLOW MAN, preferably as a mid-week bargain 
rental. You've been warned. But you probably won't listen, will you? Tis' a 
pity…

Title
Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
Author: iysmall@aol.com (Ron Small)
Starring: Julia Roberts, Albert Finny, Aaron Eckhart, Peter Coyote, Marg
Helgenberger, Cherry Jones, Jamie Harold, Tracey Walter
ERIN BROCKOVICH is one of those rarities: a commercial star picture with
something of a brain. It won't bring about world piece or even provide much of
an emotional catharsis but, despite that we all know this story through and
through and can pretty much predict how it'll turn out, it entertains without
insulting anyone's intelligence. Perhaps what I appreciated most about the film
was its director, Steven Soderbergh's, attention to detail.
Most directors of big budget star vehicles don't give a rat's tuchas about
details. They simply tell their familiar story and rely on their star to bring
audiences in. Soderbergh is an indie filmmaker at heart (and I mean "indie" in
the best way possible). He came to fame with SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE, delved
into experimental film with SCHIZOPOLIS and THE UNDERNEATH, and most recently
has began toying with high concept films (OUT OF SIGHT, the upcoming OCEAN 11
remake and TRAFFIC), imbuing them with a playful cleverness. With ERIN he has
taken a product and put his own sensibilities all over it. And god bless him,
because I am a true fan of High Concept Hollywood films…when they are done
correctly. Problem is, they rarely are. These kind of pictures are grinded out
by studio hacks like Damon Santoslefano and Brian Robbins without an once of
joy or style. Films (PATCH ADAMS, STEPMOM, READY TO RUMBLE to name three) that
trot forth before our glazed eyes, amping up woebegone tunes so we know when to
cry, and wacky melodies cueing us to laugh. I think I can tell on my own, thank
you very much. Ignorant pricks, those High Concept directors are.
For the most part, Soderbergh stays away from such Hollywood bullying tactics
and tells this story in the cheeky, idiosyncratic manner for which he is known.
All the typical Soderbergh elements are prevalent, in the neo realist
direction, the hip score that doesn't call attention to itself the way most
self consciously hip scores often do, and all the little components the
director uses to flesh out his various characters.
As I said, ERIN is a star picture, and Julia Roberts is its incandescent star.
After several light-as-Flockheart comedies, she steps into something a little
divergent (but not much). ERIN isn't a heavy film by any means. In fact without
Soderbergh's direction or Roberts in the lead it wouldn't be out of the realm
of possibility that this picture would debut on SHOWTIME.
In BROCKOVICH Julia's attributes are constantly on display, from the very low
cut dresses she wears (demonstrating the power of Personal Trainers), to that
bright, wide smile that takes over her entire face. We always know we're
watching Roberts and not Brockovich, but it works because the film builds on
Roberts' sweet, snappy personality. Like Tom Cruise, the actress uses her smile
as a bit of a weapon. It's one of her actors' "tricks". Similar to the peculiar
George Clooney head bob, or Mark Wahlberg's intermittent scowl, it's something
she flashes like a defense mechanism, a conceit that draws attention away from
her performance, and into her attractiveness. I remember watching her in an
interview on Howard Stern's E! show where she had that smile plastered across
her face during the entire interrogation, all while Stern posed his usual
litany of scatological queries. She seemed phony, like she was in pain but had
to hide it with that wide smile. Like I said, it's a trick, but one that works
its desired effect and, believe it or not, Stern soon acquiesced. It's
important that actors be aware of their range, as Roberts seems to have become
after some ill-fated attempts at character roles. After all, Cruise may be
unable to do a passable Irish accent (see FAR AND AWAY, actually don't, just
take my word for it), but he sure can paste on that affable grin whenever he's
in trouble (which he did a whole lot in EYES WIDE SHUT).
And Roberts uses the smile well as Erin Brockovich, an accidental lawyer who
stumbles upon a PG and E scandal, then, along with her grizzled boss, a
veteran\amateur attorney (skillfully acted by Albert Finny in all his fog horn
glory), she attempts to bring down the company. Nothing new here. We've seen
this kind of thing in films from SILKWOOD to THE INSIDER, but this movie is
full of the style and charm that most of the others lacked. THE INSIDER sunk
because of its stubborn, unwavering attention to the procedure of its true
story, hardly focusing on the human element. It was skillfully made, but
ultimately dramatically inert. I saw SILKWOOD so long ago (I believe I was all
of ten years old) that I won't even bother commenting on what it did right or
wrong, though at ten anything without green mutated turtles bored me silly.
BROCKOVICH isn't academic, it's cheerful, and it's the kind of film that will
make you smile. In fact I felt, at first, that the plot worked against the film
(and maybe I still feel that a bit). It opens with Brockovich in a terrifically
unexpected accident, shifting to her hectic home life, an attempted pass from a
motorcycle jockey (played with a little too much smug intelligence by Aaron
Eckheart) who falls to the ground after being "shot down" by Brockovich (a
little detail I'm sure most directors would neglect to include), and her out
spoken attempts to get a job. This stuff is handled with such gleeful
naturalism that I might have given the film higher marks had it just gone along
as a simple character study of this marvelously fascinating women. But I doubt
most audiences would like that.
When the scandal is introduced the way it is I admit I was groaning for about
ten minutes, but things pick up. Soderbergh stages terrifically mild
confrontations, and the relationship between Finny and Roberts is subtly
charming. Really the only reason I stayed involved in the picture was because
of how fun Roberts makes the character of Brockovich. I would rather see that
character (who's based on a real person) go through a familiar story than no
story.
Though Soderbergh does make a TV movie-like plot more than watchable, I do wish
he had taken it a couple steps further. For instance there's a scene where a PG
and E lawyer comes down to the firm to meet with Finny and Erin. Right when we
see this bookish, rather mousy looking fellow we immediately know that he is
going to be played for laughs, and the good guys will come out on top. During
the meeting Brockovich stares (one of those if looks could kill stares)
directly at him, her eyes smoldering with disgust. Meanwhile the guy sort of
notices, and stammers a bit. It's a scene we've scene a lot, where, before the
big guys get involved, a little corporate weasel is sent in as damage control.
Well why not do something a little different? How about a big intimidating guy,
who's articulate and intelligent (maybe someone like Vin Diesel of BOILER
ROOM), come in as damage control, and stare back at Brockovich. Instead we get
a recognizable cartoon in a fairly recognizable scene.
The brief bits that feature the victims of the PG and E scandal (a scandal that
I'm just realizing I haven't yet gone into, so here's a quick, fragmented
summary for those of you who chose to read what I put in the parenthesis:
company lies, water unhealthy, people sick + need money = law suit) are common
as well. In one instance Soderbergh goes in for a slow, extraneous, extreme
close-up of a cancer stricken youngster. Isn't there another way he could have
conveyed the emotion, rather than doing what every director does when dealing
with sickness: close-ups of sad faces. I dunno, maybe stuff like that is needed
in big studio films, but surely Soderbergh could have imbued his victims with
some of the multi-faceted character traits he gives nearly everyone else. Then
I recall PATCH ADAMS, a movie so saccharine I had to shower after, and I can
imagine what BROCKOVICH would be like in the hands of Tom Shadyac, that films
director, or even Rob Reiner, who seems to be slowly losing all the talent he
once had on a film by film basis.
But I doubt audiences will even care about the details Soderbegh plugs in,
since the film would probably be just as successful if it was directed by a
studio hack who would give it no personality. Audiences are like that, they go
to see their favorite stars in familiar stories, and they generally don't care
to be challenged. Of course BROCKOVICH doesn't challenge anybody, but it does
raise the bar a bit on the quintessential star picture. I liked it, but I would
have really liked it if Soderbergh aimed just an itsy bit higher.

Title
Review for American Psycho (2000)
Author: iysmall@aol.com (Ron Small)
Screenplay: Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner
Starring: Christian Bale, William Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny, William
Sage, Cara Seymour, Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis, Guinevere Turner,
Justin Theraux
At one point during AMERICAN PSYCHO a naked, bloodied Patrick Bateman
(Christian Bale) pursues a very unlucky hooker through his posh, modernist
apartment all while brandishing a chainsaw at about crotch level. (Note: This
is the second time I can recall seeing a chainsaw being employed as a phallic
symbol in a film, the first being SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE, which was also
directed by a woman. Draw your own conclusions). The poor prostitute stumbles
into various rooms and closets, running into Bateman's other victims some of
which lay dormant in transparent, sealed bags, while others pop out of hiding
places as if to shout "Boo!" It's a true "mad slasher" moment--insane,
frenzied, and absurdly funny, containing all the giddy sleaze that eluded
recent antiseptic slasher films like URBAN LEGEND and DISTURBING BEHAVIOR. And
AMERICAN PSYCHO isn't even a slasher film. At heart it's yet another in a long
line of recent bitter satires of American culture, although its "slasher"
elements will probably keep many from seeing it as that. The book had a similar
problem.
AMERICAN PSYCHO is based on Bret Easton Ellis' much debated novel of the same
name. As of now it's Ellis' penultimate novel, a vicious satire of the Me
Decade featuring a yuppie serial killer as a metaphor for 80's culture and
values. Bateman is that killer, a competitive narcissist (not to mention,
psycho) whom we first encounter, in the film, adorning himself like a Christmas
tree with various male beauty products (lest anyone forget that the 80's was
the decade when it became cool for a man to care what he looked like). Like
many psychotics, his life has some kind of order, a routine: he performs
countless abdominal crunches while THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE plays in the
foreground, heads off to work where he snidely interacts with his equally snide
colleagues, parties in nightclubs (the cheery 80's music is the ultimate
anti-theses of Bateman's debauched machismoâŚthink PSYCHO set to the WEDDING
SINGER soundtrack), then caps off the night with frenzied sex and exaggerated
murder all while providing his commentary of popular 80's tunes to his
bewildered victims.
Though the movie contains much uncomfortable violence (but is really just about
as graphic as your average SCREAM flick), it's not nearly as detailed as its
source material was. In the film we see all this unfold in bits, never privy to
all of Bateman's acts, while the book is told entirely within Bateman's head.
We see everything through his subjectivity, and Bateman thrives on minutia. He
provides us with the various details of applying facial cream, choosing the
right suit, and so on. This is rather comical at first, till we soon realize
that he will use this technique to describe everything, even the heinous
murders he commits (some descriptions rattling on for five pages) going into
every thing he does to his victims, and every reaction he gets from doing so.
The result is vivid, but depressingly so.
Nonetheless, Ellis found a fresh way to comment on 80's greed and narcissism by
revealing the decade through the eyes of an upper echelon killer tweaked on a
culture that tells its young executives to destroy their opposition.
Bateman is a literal product of the 80's, caring only for his own
gratification. Throughout the novel we stay in his cluttered head, and marvel
at his contempt for everything except bland 80's music ("It's hip to be
Square!"). And we realize that the only thing that separates him from his
co-workers (all narcissistic and self-absorbed) is that he takes the wolfish
kill or be killed message quite literally.
It's to the film's credit that Bateman remains intact, expertly played by
Christian Bale as a man so far gone he's hardly a man anymore. Bale speaks in a
discombobulated growl, like an overly false parody of a how a "real man" should
talk. The affection isn't all that dissimilar from the ones his colleagues put
on. And on the outside Bateman doesn't seem terribly different from all the
self-absorbed brats who surround him. It's more than a joke that these guys can
hardly recognize each other; they're like drones with personalities that bleed
into one and other, and what a perfect place for a killer to get away with
murder ("Bateman? No he couldn't have done it, I had dinner with him last
nightâŚI think"). Problem with the novel is that it gets bogged down with the
excess of drugs, sex, and murder. Harron focuses her film more tightly on the
satire and absurdity of Patrick.
Still it's interesting that much of Ellis does get up on the screen up on the
screen (as opposed to the film adaptation of LESS THAN ZERO, which featured
nothing of the author). This feels like a Bret Easton Ellis movie yet it works
to a greater extent than his novels because it contains all that makes him a
wily social commentator and little of what makes him a vacuous provocateur.
Harron's film gets at things that may have been obscured by the novel's extreme
vehemence. She shows us the casual disgust that men have for women while around
each other in scenes that play a lot like IN THE COMPANY OF MEN. Only Harron
takes it further, driving the message into us. It's as if the violence
committed by Bateman (the angry male) on his mostly female victims is an
extension of all the disgust and anger that males harbor towards women. The
novel's graphic rhythms have been reconfigured slightly, and transplanted to
the screen as the ultimate horror movie for women. A horror movie in which all
the men are predators, but only one truly indulges in his vicious predatory
urges.

Review for Mission: Impossible II (2000)
Starring: Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Ving Rhames, Richard 
Roxburgh, John Polson, Brendan Gleeson, Rade Sebedzija, Anthony Hopkins
For about twenty minutes into MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 director John Woo (THE 
KILLER, HARD BOILED, FACE OFF) appears to have made an exciting, elegant, 
charming spy thriller, kind of a post millennium James Bond adventure with a 
strapping American (read: unsophisticated) hero more willing to drop kick 
villains than out fox them. Sadly, as the picture progresses, the final 
product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up, two-hour long 
episode of MAGYUVER. And not a particularly good one at that. What went 
wrong? MI2 begins flashily enough, that initial flash leading us to believe 
that it'll soon give way to something of a plot, but it only gives way to 
more flash, then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of 
itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad 
guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of Tom Cruise's firing gun just 
so they can die really cool.
Early on, during a car chase between soon to be lovers Ethan Hunt (Tom 
Cruise) and Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), Woo works some of his 
trademark magic. In one hypnotic, though completely inexplicable sequence, 
the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as Cruise and his 
stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexualityâŚ 
just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance, coming ever so 
close to toppling over a neighboring cliff. Prior to this we see the famed 
trailer opener of Cruise climbing a steep mountain, sans scaffolding, then 
leaping from one jagged rock formation to another. Why? I haven't the 
foggiest. I doubt even John Woo could provide you with a logical reply. With 
MI2 Woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine, the one that 
jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity 
defying effects. It's possible that these "spies" could be adrenaline junkies 
climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off, though 
of course this is never explored. The scenes I've described are really only 
included to titillate, not to give any insight into character. God forbid. 
Woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic, but they remain 
individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of 
beer commercial-like visuals.
Still in terms of crackerjack eye candy, the opening has much to cherish. 
Cruise and Newton first meet during a vigorous Flamenco dance featuring 
several welcome Woo devices (the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized 
movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals 
discovering how attractive the other is). Between the frantic dancing, Woo 
trains his camera on Cruise and Newton as they make with some sensuous eye 
contact. The scene is a little over the top in a Bon Jovi music video circa 
1988 kind of way, yet it has style and something of soul, and Woo casts a bit 
of a spell on us. Sure it's all smoke and mirrors, but we can see that there 
happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product. Thandie and 
Cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully 
charming as the Jennifer Lopez\George Cloony trunk meeting in OUT OF SIGHT. 
They flirt and exchange obvious double entendres. Newton bats her eyes 
flirtatiously. Cruise grins a little too slyly.
The Cruise character, Ethan Hunt, has been drastically altered since the 
first film. Here Cruise plays him more as a hip, sexual dynamo than the 
square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1. He's cool and dashing, which is 
precisely the kind of role we want to see Cruise in after watching him sleep 
walk through EYES WIDE SHUT (which might just be the longest episode of RED 
SHOW DIARIES ever committed to film), and blustered his way through MAGNOLIA 
(quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's). Sadly as the 
film progresses we see less of Cruise's initial "I'm the man!" charm and more 
slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug.
MI2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act, which 
is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop. The whole 
thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle (the first gun fight in 
the film), which really should be unheard of in a John Woo film, but alas 
this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from Renny Harlin to 
Joseph Merhi (of course excepting the "symbolic" pigeons who seem to find 
their way into every John Woo picture). We've all seen guys slide across the 
floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand. It isn't done any 
differently here.
The action is pure HARD TARGET\BROKEN ARROW theatrics with nothing to propel 
it but the apparent need to see Tom Cruise drop kick face less villains while 
his hair whips stylishly in the wind. He's cool for sure but he's made to be 
as empty as the movie. The actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as 
for his chiseled looks; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at 
literally any moment, be it during a gunfight, before one or after one. When 
he's not beaming away, he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to 
look mad as hell, but Woo's editing seriously undermines the effort. He 
fetishizes Cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a NAKED 
GUN style spoof. I half expected Cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal 
that he's really Austin Powers.
In a classic Woo action moment, Ethan Hunt struts past a fiery doorway 
glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death. The 
gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which 
turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for 
Cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual (one dumb bastard 
even jumps his bike over the gun toting Cruise, basically inviting our 
handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does). The lead bad guy 
(played by the appropriately British Dougray Scott) and Cruise face off in a 
mentally deficient game of chickenâŚon motorcycles. Though instead of jumping 
off to the side at the last moment, the two grown men leap directly into the 
other giving each other a mid air bear hug, only to fly about a hundred feet 
(still in bear hug position), land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano 
fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a "so you thought I was 
dead...". Not to worry, Cruise takes care of the problem without even 
breaking a sweat. What a hero!
You may have noticed that I opted not to describe an iota of MI2's plot. My 
reasoning is simple: I'm not sure of any good it would do. The film itself 
has absolutely no concern with story, only with hurtling forth to the next 
"special" effect. I wasn't kidding when I told a friend of mine that MI2 has 
less plot than the average Aerosmith video. Nobody will go to this for the 
plot, and if they do they'll surely regret it. As summer movies evolve (or 
devolve) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly 
nothing. In MI, the plot seemed to be built around Brian De Palma's (that 
film's director) stylistic flourishes, while in MI2 the plot only serves to 
give us an intermittent breather from Woo's non-stop masturbatory 
pandemonium. It's irrelevant in every sense, as is character. All that 
ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors.

Title
Review for Cell, The (2000)
Starring: Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn, Vincent D'Onofrio, Dylan Baker, 
Marianne Jean-Baptiste, James Gammon, Jake Weber, Patrick Bauchau, Gerry 
Becker, Tara Sunkoff, Jake Thomas, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Catherine Sutherland
THE CELL is chock full of some of the most repulsive imagery I've ever seen 
in a major motion picture. Also some of the most creative. Its director, 
Tarsem Singh, who comes from a music video and commercial background, is a 
visual stylist of the highest order and in some scenes he's orchestrated what 
could be called visual poetry. THE CELL is often a feast for the eyes though 
unfortunately almost never a feast for the soul.
Last week Roger Ebert and his smarmy co-host Richard Roeper breathlessly 
raved, deeming it a masterwork, one of the best films of the year. Just a 
week prior, Ebert panned COYOTE UGLY, exclaiming "There has to be something 
for the gray matter. Something". Well I've seen THE CELL and I don't recall 
it offering much of anything for the gray matter. It had promise (but doesn't 
every movie, hell, TEACHING MRS. TINGLE had promise), but it's more 
interested in operatic images than it is in story (the same of which could be 
said for a music video). The scenes between its characters feel oddly cold 
and removed like in many Stanley Kubrick films, but in those the stiffness 
served a purpose, Kubrick made satire and Tarsem has made a straight genre 
film, which should have likeable characters in order to make us, you know, 
give a damn. Whatever artistry the director brings to his visual palettes he 
clearly lacks with his actors; all their voices might as well be dubbed in 
seeing as how their delivery lacks discernable emotion. Tarsem is clearly not 
at all interested in them, but he realizes that he has to give those pesky 
characters some screen time before getting to his visual feast. And he 
complies, though obviously quite begrudgingly.
So I find myself in something of a quandary. While parts of THE CELL 
disgusted and even offended me, parts of it thrilled me and served as a 
reminder of what this medium is really capable of. THE CELL plays it safe 
with its story line, already described by some as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS meets 
MATRIX, but it doesn't in individual sequences, which is refreshing after one 
of the most conventional movie summers in some time.
Tarsem may not be much of human storyteller, but he manages to capture the 
dream state better here than in any other film I've seen. When the picture 
opens, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez under pounds of make-up), a 
progressive child psychologist, has been placed into her patient's 
subconscious by a group of scientists testing out a revolutionary new dream 
therapy that enables the patient to interact with their therapist in their 
own head, thus uncovering secrets that may be too painful to be revealed 
consciously. Once in the patient's head, Deane finds herself decked out in a 
flowing white gown amid a serene desert vista that could've been spliced in 
from a Calvin Klein ad. She's trailing up a sandy dune as Tarsem's camera 
lingers, watching from afar. Next she's on a black horse riding to her 
patient, jump to her with the patient, the horse behind her, now an inanimate 
life-size figurine. Tarsem captures the odd incongruous shifts that we 
encounter in our dreams, a state where unbelievable things occur and seem 
downright believable as they transpireâŚuntil we wake and ponder; wait a 
minute, I can't fly. In the world Tarsem creates, anything is possible.
For its first thirty five minutes THE CELL shows a great deal of promise, 
expertly cutting between three separate stories so as they build to their 
inevitable interlocking we feel tension from each overlapping into the other. 
In one, dogged FBI agent Peter Novak (a dulled Vince Vaughn) is narrowing in 
on Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a schizophrenic killer who performs some of 
the most revolting acts I've ever seen get past the MPAA with an R rating of 
approval. Stargher has constructed a cell encased in glass, containing only a 
toilet and a bench. He kidnaps women and locks them within it. He leaves them 
there, alone, setting a timer for water to intermittently shower down from 
the ceiling. He films them from a stationary camera as they drown, slowly. 
Later, after they've died, he takes their nude bodies, places them on a slab 
and levitates above them (you see this wacko has inserted steel rings into 
his back which he connects to chains that hold him above the bodies, his own 
skin stretching out like molten latex) while he masturbates over their 
corpses.
Audiences have always had a morbid fascination with how serial killers 
operate, and these sort of films have been growing decidedly more gruesome 
and kinky with their killer's fetishes, but THE CELL has crossed boundaries 
that I didn't have any desire to see crossed. I don't mind perversion if it 
has a point (as it did in SEVEN and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) but here it serves 
no purpose other than to titillate and jolt an audience that's probably sat 
through everything from KISS THE GIRLS to THE BONE COLLECTOR. THE CELL has 
gladly matched the evil we've seen in all those films and now we can sit and 
wait to see someone match it.
After discovering several clues that lead to the killer, the FBI tracks 
Stargher down, who lays in a coma, passed out after failing to get to his 
medication. The agents have discovered he has another victim in his cell, and 
it's only a matter of time before she drowns. Problem is they don't know 
where Stargher keeps the cell and since he isn't conscious they have no way 
of finding out. This is when the stories collide. The cops go to the 
revolutionary scientists with the proposition to put the progressive 
psychologist inside the killer's mind, befriend him and get him to confess 
the location of his cell. Thus begins the visual orgy.
Amongst the madness is Jennifer Lopez, who, here, lacks everything that made 
her so charming in OUT OF SIGHT. Lopez looks stunning always, her hair 
perfect, even when mussed it's stylishly so. Here, she truly gives a star 
performance, and I mean that in the worst way. Gone is the energy and glow, 
in its place a Melanie Griffith acting job complete with cotton candy affect 
and adorned with a small country's supply of lip gloss.
Another acting causality is the usually immensely likeable Vince Vaughn, a 
highly individual actor who's managed to inject personality in even the most 
banal roles (his cowboy serial killer in CLAY PIGEONS), though in this film 
he walks through the part looking tired, speaking in measured tones, not 
really doing much of anything. If you're gonna cast a talent like Vaughn why 
not give him something to do besides a tired Charlie Sheen impersonation?
Not to mention (but I'll do so anyway since it's sorta my job) the myriad of 
character actors given nothing roles, like Dylan Baker, Marianne 
Jean-Baptiste, and Pruitt Taylor Vince, though in a major motion picture this 
is to be expected. Vincent D'Onofrio manages to make something of an 
impression in early scenes when he plays his schizoid killer like a nerdy 
mouth breather type, seemingly more afraid of human interaction than death 
itself. Though once we get into his mind D'Onofrio's performance becomes more 
typically over the top.
The script's attempts to give us hints as to why Stargher turned out the way 
he did are awfully pretentious (you see, he was abused by his father who took 
to calling him "faggot"), but writer Mark Protosevich and director Tarsem 
Singh nonetheless deserve credit for birthing some of the most oddly 
compelling (and deeply disturbing visuals) I've ever seen in a picture not 
directed by Fellini or Argento. The visuals aren't total originals, but they 
come to life as such with Tarsem's world combining Tarot card images with odd 
religious torture devices into the grimmest fairy tale universe since 
CINDERELLA before it was sanitized. But ultimately, all those smoke and 
mirrors weren't enough to tide me over. I mean, there has to be something for 
the gray matter. Something. Doesn't there?

Title
Review for Boys Don't Cry (1999)
Author: iysmall@aol.com  (Ron Small)
Screenplay: Kimberly Pierce, Andy Bienen
Starring: Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton III,
Allison Folland, Alicia Goranson
The story of Teena Brandon is more than just that, it's the story of Mathew
Shepard, possibly even the story of Howard Beach. Shepard was killed for being
gay and Beach was killed for being black. Both were killed out of intolerance,
possibly fear as well. Teena was killed for being a girl who wanted to be a
boy. She changed her appearance (taped her breasts, cut her hair, developed a
swagger), and her name (took the Brandon and put it before the Teena) all to
become male. Shocking? Not really. When you strip away all the religious
propaganda and idiotic moralizing we've had stuffed down our throats since
tots, you'll find that this story is really a modernist fairly tale, like the
pauper who wanted to be a prince, it is the girl who wanted to be a boy. Though
unlike the homogenized fairy tales we're force fed as kids, this one doesn't
end happily.
I recall the first time I became aware of Brandon's story. It 'twas the night
before finals, a night filled with the worst kind of pre-performance anxiety
(well, maybe the second worse kind), but I was covered; I had studied with such
abandon (into the wee hours of morning) that my head was overflowing with
useless crap I would surely forget by the next week. Before heading to bed I
switched on Cinemax hoping for some soft-core porn, as is the usual programming
at 2:00 a.m. Instead I found THE BRANDON TEENA STORY, a horribly made, but
nonetheless gripping documentary about the brief life and sudden death of Teena
Brandon. It was a maddening story, viewing it was tantaumont to being privy to
an injustice that could have easily been countered. Maddening because of the
stupidity and ignorance of nearly everyone involved. And maddening because of
how this innocent was savagely beaten, raped and killed all for her desire to
be something she wasn't. And who among us doesn't at least fleetingly have that
desire? Is her wish to be a man all that hard to take in these supposedly
enlightened times? ("Enlightened" today means we all carry around the same old
prejudices, only now they're kept tightly underwraps only to surface in the
heat of the moment as DO THE RIGHT THING, Spike Lee's audacious film about
intolerance, showed us). After all, we don't think harshly of those who get
nose jobs, liposuction, breast implants, all the surgeries designed to make you
someone else; the person you want to be.
When Brandon is confronted about her switch (during a rape query no less) she's
practically forced into saying "I have a sexual identity crisis" when she
really doesn't, she's simply more comfortable as a man.
That damn documentary kept me up till 4:00 am, but it was well worth it. Teena
Brandon's story is more insightful than anything I picked up in the gargantuan
Psychology textbook I had been slogging through the very same night.
In BOYS DON'T CRY, Brandon is played by Hilary Swank in a performance that goes
well beyond simple macho posturing. With her close-cropped hair, thin frame,
and wide grin, Swank has the appearance of an extremely gawky Matt Damon. But
look closer at that smile, the earnestness in her demeanor, the good-natured
chivalrousness and she becomes loveable as a man. It's easy to see why a bitter
southern townie would fall for her. She has something the other males lack; an
aw shucks kindness. She comes with flowers while the others come with beer and
condoms.
As the film opens Teena leaves her hometown of Lincoln for Falls City, a
trailer park haven. Through a bar fight she becomes acquainted with two loutish
rednecks (both extremely well played by Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton
III), and their "girls". One of whom catches Teena's eye. She is Lana (well
played by Chloe Sevigny) a bitter townie, who like all bitter townies dreams of
escaping the confines of her town. Brandon is in a similar situation; she
dreams of escaping the confines of femininity. Teena woos her with sweetness,
something the men of this particular town seem to know nothing about (yes a
generalization, but a surprisingly appropriate one judging from the
documentary). Their relationship is the heart of the film, and it certainly
works to counter the almost clinical manner of its brutal, unflinching
conclusion. That heart makes the violence much harder to take; we've grown to
care about this character and the unrelenting cruelty towards her hurts, as it
should.
Kimberly Pierce (the co-writer\director, and certainly a talent to watch) ups
the lyrical undertones with in-between-scene segues filmed as heady rushes of
prairie life speeded up to the point where all we see are rapid lights blinking
with urgency. The film itself gradually becomes more urgent, and a bit more
difficult to watch. Pierce doesn't hide much from us. We see the murders, the
beatings, and the rape, but here it serves a purpose whereas in a major
Hollywood production like THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER it did not. In that movie the
rape was filmed by commercial director Simon West as a masochistic gang bang
fantasy. West used flashy camera moves and stylishly dank cinematography to
make, what looked like, a slick commercial for rape. Pierce hardly moves her
camera; she simply presents us with the facts. BOY'S DON'T CRY doesn't preach,
or moralize its characters, it chronicles events that did occur. And it gives
them life and meaning by taking us into a strangely touching romance that looks
to be so simple on the surface. It is simple in all its ROMEO AND JULIET tragic
romanticism, but complex because of the one major addition.
Pierce's film is uncompromising in its content. I can just imagine if it had
been made as a mainstream film (as was proposed). The movie features the kind
of raw intensity, taboo exploration, and emotional truths that used to be
(pre-Tarantino) the hallmark of independent film. Now amidst the rotting
corpses of irony laden "hipster" indies, BOYS DON'T CRY stands out as a
sobering experience.

Review for Body Shots (1999)
Starring: Jerry O' Connell, Tara Reid, Amanda Peet, Ron Livingston, Brad Rowe,
Sean Patrick Flannery, Sybil Temchen, Emily Procter
Pre-Review Note: Seeing as the only concern of BODY SHOTS is "sex", I will be
forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the
duration of this review. Because of this, I will try to vary word descriptions
of "sex" (meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms, and\or your name is
Jerry Falwell, you are kindly invited to hit the X up on the left corner of
your screen), so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot
comprehend, fret not, it's most likely just another way of referring to "sex".
I think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous
so I hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a
very boring review. Though not as boring as the movie which makes Steve Forbes
flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked Mathew Mconaughy play the
bongos while high on god knows what. 
BODY SHOTS is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are
filmed ominously, in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack.
It's about people who think about screwing, seek it out, and talk about it.
These are things we all do, sometimes. The characters in this film spend every
waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts. Their lives center
around the next sexual encounter, but they seemed depressed. It's as if fucking
is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek.
At its core BODY SHOTS is a message movie, the kind of thing I could picture
really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn
them off coition. Michael Cristoffer (who directed GIA, another film that
treated bumping uglies as if it where evil) is a moralist with nothing new to
say. His characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other, so
Cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by
speaking directly into the camera. They voice simplistic platitudes like "I
like to come" or "sex without love equals violence". Huh? And yes that is as
complex as this movie's observations get. The characters are stupid and
shallow, with not one registering as anything more.
The plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for
carnal pleasure, then the after math (the morning after) of such events. We
meet the characters as they speak directly to us, confiding in us with their
idiotic ruminations on intimacy. I would normally go into the characters and
the actors who play them, giving you the pros and cons, but for this film I
cannot. I'm not trying to be clever or witty, but I honestly hardly remember
anything that would set them apart from the others. With the exception of Trent
(played by Ron Livingston as a bargain basement Patrick Bateman), the rest fade
into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts, defined abs, pearly white teeth,
and creamy, flawless skin. I vaguely recall Brad Rowe as the sensitive one,
only because his character gets the worst lines ("sex without love equals
violence").
In between all the confessionals, Cristoffer films everything like a headache
commercial, with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning. The fact that this
director at one point won a Pulitzer Prize completely baffles me. This film is
made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its
tag line claims to be defining. If BODY SHOTS is meant to say that all
twentysometyhings are idiotic and f**k-obsessed, fine, I don't have any problem
with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way, but Cristoffer
only gives us one side. Additionally that one side isn't even entertaining; the
characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness. Or realism. One
sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the
two most sensitive characters. They suddenly have vigorous intercourse with
each other for no apparent reason (other than that they both happen to be
standing next to each other…alas, if it could only be that easy…kidding of
course), then, not only isn't it erotic, it isn't real. It doesn't feel like an
authentic sexual encounter. Every f**k scene in this film (and there are many)
is treated in the same unsexy manner. BODY SHOTS makes fornication dirtier than
the most scummy porno film. It shows us none of the pleasure that should go
along with it, and most of all, it fails to show us why its characters love
making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it.
The resulting search for nookie (and you can take that cookie…) over one
night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow. The main concern is
much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred. The film shows us two
separate versions of the possible rape (one where it is consensual the other
where it is not) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible
victim gets her shirt torn off. This is a topic that could be interestingly
explored if done intelligently, and if memory serves me I can't think of one
film that has done so, and yes I saw THE ACCUSED which may be one of the most
overrated movies of the 80's next to WALL STREET. Unfortunately nobody gives us
reason to care, not the writer, the director or the actors nearly all of whom
seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off.
Paul Thomas Anderson approached BOOGIE NIGHTS in a manner similar to what
Cristoffer does here, though BOOGIE NIGHTS succeeded. It was similarly
moralistic, but it gave us two different viewpoints; it showed us how the
lifestyle of porn enticed its characters, and it showed us the possible
fall-out of such a decision. The characters in BOOGIE NIGHTS were as idiotic as
the characters are here, but Anderson seemed to care about them. He gave them
heart. Cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones. He preaches to us, by
using his characters to preach to us. This is not the way to get any message
across. Why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of
hittin' skins? Cristofer kind of does that, though without an ounce of insight,
and with a helping of leering exploitation.

Review for Jesus' Son (1999)
Screenplay: Elizabeth Cuthrell, David Urrutia, Oren Moverman
Starring: Billy Crudup, Samantha Morton, Denis Leary, Jack Black, Holly 
Hunter, Dennis Hopper, Greg Germann, Will Patton, Mark Webber, Michael Shannon
(Note: This review originally appeared  on REELING in early June prior to its 
theatrical release)
As the month of June closes I can't help but look back on all the shitty, 
joyless, but damn expensive Summer flicks I've endured; the kinetic 
showboating of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2, the empty headed Toyota commercial 
visuals of GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, the boring platitudes coupled with jerky 
action and BRAVEHEART's plot in GLADIATOR, the non-stop gross out desperation 
of ROAD TRIP, and the Saturday Morning Cartoon drawings of TITAN A.E. They 
all looked fantastic and seemed to hold a wealth of possible treasures, you 
know, the Saturday Matinee thrill of adventure with maybe some good 
characterization thrown in, but no, they pandered and failed to even elicit 
the cheesy thrills of past summer crapola like DEEP BLUE SEA or THE 
FRIGHTENERS.
So I return, my childlike hopes squashed, to the ol' reliable art house. I 
don my spectacles, attempt to procure a three-day growth of beard and I 
enter, tail naturally between those legs of mine, one of my old theatre 
haunts. Pleasant memories waft my way-- the friendly security guard babbling 
about Fellini films, the male ticket ripper with the eye-liner and the 
RESERVOIR DOG's T-shirt, ahhh yes a world as full of magical incongruities as 
a Fellini film. You see in the early to mid nineties the art houses have been 
my refuge from the Hollywood crap that pollutes cities across this fair 
nation. I remember the hipster urgency of RESERVOIR DOGS, the sad\funny paces 
of TREES LOUNGE, the love of life found in BIG NIGHT, but that was long ago. 
I've been disappointed by these as well; most recently my trips to the art 
houses have been less fruitful; PECKER was John Waters homogenized (and he 
was the one doing the homogenizing, no lose), THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE 
was a choir to sit through, DESERT BLUE felt like a lame WB special complete 
with Kevin Williamson style quirks, and on. Most indie films are now just as 
manufactured as the mainstream ones.
Those "fringe" movies have spawned into their own little market full of 
flicks with their own brand of high concepts; the casual drug use, coolly 
unshaven men with tussled hair pontificating like philosophy scholars, hip 
white boys who use the "n" word like it's the ultimate badge of rebel cool, 
and the requisite Janeane Garafalo appearance. It's become just as tough to 
make a personal statement in that kind of arena so now previous indie film 
makers like Todd Solonz, David O Russell and Neil La Blute have migrated to 
major film, which is a good thing. It's about time for a shift.
JESUS' SON is chock full of the elements of indie films I've grown to 
loathe. It has the grungy-chic hand held photography, the medium close-ups of 
junkies shooting up, the quirky supporting characters, and it's a bit of an 
episodic, shambling mess vacillating wildly from one tone to another. But it 
has a certain lackadaisical charm, a bit of free wheeling gusto that those 
mapped out, formulaic big budget summer movies lack. Its actors and 
screenplay overcome the occasional handicaps, and maybe I would have given it 
an even higher grade had I not been so put off by its essential ingredients. 
(One can only sit through so many hiply off center philosophical junkie 
flicksâŚ). But it coasts on a sort of sedated charm that leaked through the 
screen and gently tap-danced on me. I felt like I was viewing something 
genuine, something with a distinct feel and voice and even some insight into 
its low lifes. This movie is at least alive while, nowadays, most indies come 
at us DOA.
Billy Crudup stars as F*ck Head (a nickname that stuck after he seemed to go 
out of his way to keep it) a passive drifter who lets life carry him 
wherever. He's a follower who stumbles into the junkie lifestyle after 
developing a dysfunctional relationship with a Michelle (Samantha Morton), a 
petulant junkie. He's a bit of a flaky idiot but a damn likeable one the way 
Crudup plays him. The actor gives FH a sort of off kilter John Cusack on 
smack vibe (the character could be the directionless Lloyd Dobler of SAY 
ANYTHING after being dumped by the Ione Skye character). He's charming in an 
enigmatic way with mannerisms that seem ever so slightly off. Crudup's an 
attractive actor (like a cross between Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise at their 
scruffiest) and for him to play this kind of loser with the same lived in 
baggage he gave heartthrob track star Prefontaine in WITHOUT LIMITS (the 
better of the two bio-pics of "the James Dean of track") marks him as not 
only a major talent but a very capable leading man just waiting to hit the 
mainstream.
FH wanders through several low down adventures, most unrelated, with a 
narrative that could kindly be called non-existent. The film is like a series 
of SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL shorts strung together, all featuring the same 
character and his progressions (or digressions). Each short has a guest star 
who most likely won't be seen in the next one. Dennis Leary, for once 
abandoning his rat-tat-tat delivery for subtle characterization, is one of 
those appearing briefly as a stoic drunk who tears apart his old home in 
order to sell the copper for money. Jack Black (HIGH FIDELITY) appears in the 
film's most amusing "short", as a hospital orderly who acts like a kid in a 
candy store. He has what may be the funniest scene I've seen all year; a bit 
involving mind-altering drugs, and incompetent staff and an impaled patient 
is like Preston Sturges meets Tarantino and all that implies. Dennis Hopper 
is sharper than usual as a craggy old drunk who got shot twice, by his two 
different wives and Holly Hunter acts exactly like Holly Hunter.
Samantha Morton (SWEET AND LOWDOWN, in which she was nominated for an Academy 
Award) appears in several of the shorts as the woman who loves and 
manipulates Fuck Head. Her child-like sweetness is matched with a world-weary 
quality that seems to be taking over. Their relationship is a passive 
aggressive one with the Morton character largely in control.
JESUS SON may be annoying to some for it's a film that's all ebb and flow, 
excitement and boredom. The film doesn't really end so much as run out gas 
which I suppose is appropriate considering the character's journey; if it had 
ended differently with some overly dramatic conclusion I'd probably be 
bemoaning it, though it seems that JESUS' SON overstays its welcome just a 
bit with its last twenty minutes seeming largely redundant, sort of like how 
it might be to watch Benjamin and Elaine from THE GRADUATE after they realize 
how wrong they are for each other (that had to be a real long bus ride) and 
begin getting on each other's nerves, eventually splitting up and returning 
to their old lives.
JESUS SON isn't a great film but in a time where indies seem to be dying a 
slow boring death, it's an appropriate return to what independent film should 
be doing. And after a month of wadding through high concept Hollywood crap 
it's just what I needed to get excited about the movies again.

Review for Wonder Boys (2000)
Author: iysmall@aol.com (Ron Small)
Starring: Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand, Robert Downy J.r,
Katie Holmes, Rip Torn, Jane Adams, Richard Thomas
In WONDER BOYS Michael Douglas plays an aged writer\professor with such
lived-in naturalism that I believe it may be his best performance. Ever since
WALL STREET, Douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing
variations on the shark in a suit Gordon Gecko character he personified in the
mid-80's. In those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of
cutthroat businessmen, with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his
bad intentions to the world. You'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped
tightly underneath a good-natured veneer, but from Gordon Gecko to Nicholas Van
Orton, Douglas played the role straight and out in the open. In WONDER BOYS his
performance isn't showy or a tour de force, it's simple yet truthful.
He embodies Grady, a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink
bathrobes. Grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a
follow up to the novel that put him on the map. When we first encounter this
curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop, we hear his sardonic narration on the
soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms. Grady
points out, in his narration, that they only do so out of jealousy. Their
target is the very writerly named James Leer (played by the always understated
Tobey Maguire), a student full of potential and one whom Grady develops a mild
affection for.
Leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions. He
speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the
edges. He's portentous and gloomy, as if modeling himself after the great
depressed writers, though his act is a little too calculated. He reminds me of
the self-imposed outcast film director, Jim Jarmusch (DEAD MAN, GHOST DOG).
Whenever I happen to catch Jarmusch in an interview I see the man speaking in a
toneless manner (the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for
his interviewer), exclusively dressed in black, and with his spiked hair dyed
snow white. Leer is similar, a guy who equates quirks with depth.
Tobey Maguire fits well in the role. With his round, sweet-eerie face he
resembles Bud Cort from HAROLD AND MAUDE. But unlike Cort, Maguire is easier to
warm up to; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility. Katie
Holmes plays Hannah, a beautiful, talented writing student just itching to get
in Grady's pants. This is a plot line I had trouble with. Douglas, in his old
age, is beginning to resemble Jerry Springer, a man who has actually paid for
sex on numerous documented occasions. At first I found it extremely difficult
to believe that someone as beautiful as Hannah would desire Grady (maybe it's
because I'm jealous, and wish Holmes was throwing herself at me, after all I
may just be a lowly internet critic but at least I still have all my teeth),
then I think of Douglas's real life companion, the breathtaking Catherine Zeta
Jones. Seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping. Suddenly my
mind has shifted from the task at hand (that being reviewing this completely
wonderful movie) and I'm pontificating on why the hell Jones would desire
Douglas. There is a movie in there somewhere.
Grady, rather chivalrously if you ask me, resists the charms of Hannah for Sara
Gaskell (a droll Frances McDormand), who is his age, but also married to
another professor. Okay, maybe not so chivalrous. There is a great line in the
film spoken by Douglas about Sara where he says, "She was a junkie for the
printed word. Lucky for me I manufactured her drug of choice".
Robert Downy J.r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering
transvestite on his arm. Downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate
wit of many a hipster intellectual. He's arrogant but completely likeable in
his utter arrogance. The actor is perfectly cast here, and remains a joyous
movie presence somewhere between a typical Tom Hanksian comic leading man and
edgy character actor. I wish WONDER BOYS had more of him.
Searching for a plot among the elements of WONDER BOYS would be pointless, for
it meanders through its running time, but that's part of its charm. And maybe
I'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary
academia, a place I'm greatly fond of, and a place rarely explored in American
cinema. Everyone has a sub-genre (be it war films, westerns, dance movies) that
they happen to be privy to. I'm privy to films about literary types i.e. those
individuals enthralled by the written word, and if you are not so inclined it
may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch.
The direction by Curtis Hanson is more akin to a European film with its
leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters, rather than
generic mapped out story points. Sometimes the dialogue is too clever, but
that's a problem I wish I found with films more often. Another minor quibble is
that early on the film seems a bit too introverted, like its characters, but as
the story progresses it begins to open up.
For me WONDER BOYS works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic
types, and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags. The gags
are like those in the great Robert Altman (M*A*S*H, THE LONG GOODBYE) movies,
where jokes exist as asides on the fringes, like jokes in life often do. The
broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog, and incessant smoking of
marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things.
Curtis Hanson, who before his last film, LA CONFIDENTIAL, toiled about with
exploitation fare like LOSIN' IT (an early Tom Cruise sex comedy) and THE HAND
THE ROCKS THE CRADLE, has graduated to more meaningful films. He directs WONDER
BOYS in an appropriately dour style, the comedy coming from the false gloom his
characters put up. The morose crooning of Leonard Cohen would seem an odd song
for the background of any party, but in a WONDER BOYS party, it fits.
The film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen. It's the
cinematic equivalent to a good read, novelistic in its approach with themes
rarely found in American movies. Many will find it slight, but I found much to
savor among its subtleties.

Title
Review for Nurse Betty (2000)
Screenplay: John C. Richards, James Flamberg
Starring: Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger, Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear, Aaron 
Eckhart, Crispin Glover, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Alison Janney, Tia Texada, 
Kathleen Wilhoite
The summer of 00' wasn't a very good one for devout cinephiles. It offered no 
BLAIR WITCHES or SIXTH SENSES; the best big budget Hollywood could do was an 
efficient X-MEN adaptation and a flawed but entertaining SHAFT update. NURSE 
BETTY signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the 
commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season, that 
battery-charging (at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o' 
shit that moseys into multiplexes) time of year when all those Oscar 
Contenders (read: "quality" films) compete for audiences. Alas BETTY has the 
dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new 
season. It's also indie director Neil LaBute's first attempt at something 
resembling a mainstream picture, and I'm sad to report it's a resounding 
failure (at least on this web site), a mess that's as hopelessly saccharine 
as people have accused LaBute's previous films of being unrelentingly 
masochistic.
I went in expecting something decent, for BETTY was gleefully praised, it's 
screenplay even winning an award at CANNES, but I exited shaking my noggin in 
bewilderment. Are critics so desperate for something unique that they're 
blind to how derivative the particular brand of "uniqueness" BETTY dolls out 
is? For the first time LaBute is working from a script he has not written, 
and he seems unsure of how to handle the material. BETTY tries to be hip like 
PULP FICTION (this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and 
articulate hit men), enchanting like THE WIZARD OF OZ (of which this film 
makes several allusions to) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite 
loveable misfit movie], but by the end it left me cold with its calculated 
desperation. It's LaBute's half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and 
he doesn't even seem to have half that heart in it.
NURSE BETTY concerns a soap opera addict, Betty (brilliantly played by Renee 
Zellweger), who witnesses the killing of her husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart 
playing the most casually loutish husband since Richard Benjamin in DIARY OF 
A MAD HOUSEWIFE) by two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock). She happens 
to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two 
realities. She's blocked out her husband's death and thinks she's a character 
in her favorite soap, A REASON TO LOVE. Betty sets out on the road to LA 
(with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk) searching for her soap 
boyfriend Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear) while the two bickering hit men 
follow in not so close pursuit.
The LaBute who birthed the extraordinary IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, slipped a bit 
(but not much) with his sophomore effort, YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, then 
fell straight on his ass with BASH, a play he penned that was recently aired 
on SHOWTIME. The play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist, only 
LaBute's persistence in wallowing in the horrid things "average" people do to 
each other, usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are. In the 
play, Paul Rudd, as an obnoxious jock, delivers a monologue detailing how he 
once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death, while 
his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as 
something along the old maxim "boys will be boys". Another character, 
schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his 
own baby! What was once so powerful about LaBute's work, the casual, 
nonchalant cruelty and selfishness (often elements we all have in us 
amplified to a disgusting degree) had become so over the top it was 
borderline comic. Obviously, at this point, LaBute could use a dose of some 
different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further, but NURSE 
BETTY isn't it. He clearly has little passion for what he's doing here, 
instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks (one of the hit men is a huge 
soap fan, and the character of Betty would be little more than a one joke 
gimmick if Zelllweger hadn't managed to transcend that) tailor made to appeal 
to the widest possible audience.
Nearly every scene between Chris Rock and Morgan Freeman fatally slows the 
picture down, as the two are made to enact soft-boiled Tarantino-esque 
dialogue. They evince little chemistry, with Rock constantly in over the top 
rant mode, acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit 
man (an occupation that's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays). 
I think Rock is a great comic yet he hasn't been able to bring his feral 
intelligence to movies, whenever he acts, and no matter the part, it's like 
he's doing the damn CHRIS ROCK SHOW. Surprisingly (at least considering her 
work in ME, MYSELF AND IRENE) Renee Zellweger gives a revelatory performance, 
building on her baby faced, apple pie looks. That wide-open face and helium 
voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her 
thirty-year-old body. It's the best work she's ever done.
Freeman is effective as always, though his performance nonetheless suffers 
because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it. The actor 
plays the role in his usual calm, collected manner, though the flick tries to 
insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and Betty's, suggesting 
that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality. That's 
interesting but the movie doesn't do anything with it other than crash land 
the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle.
The film has good moments (many of the scenes involving a very good Greg 
Kinnear, especially his confrontation with Zellweger), an almost soothing, 
lyrical score (and you know a movie's in trouble when the score sticks out as 
one of the best things about it) but nothing jells, it's parts, good or bad, 
are so disparate as to be opposing. The film might have worked had it settled 
on being one type of film, a mainstream, female FORREST GUMP or an oddball 
art film, but as both if it falls as flat as Diet Coke. BETTY's screenplay 
makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence, without which Betty 
wouldn't make any progress in the film. NURSE BETTY is a film driven by 
coincidence rather than charter, like how Betty becomes a nurse in the film, 
a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover; she 
happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting 
takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim's wound 
because she happened to see how on TV, which leads to her being offered a 
room with the victim's girlfriend who eventually gets Betty into a party 
where she meets KinnearâŚ a little too tidy, don'tcha think.
BETTY has an interesting theme, though it doesn't even seem aware of this. 
The current state of TV has been leaning towards reality television what with 
the enormous success of SURVIVOR and moderate success of BIG BROTHER, with 
more on the way. This is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her 
favorite soap opera is reality (ironically real-life SURVIVOR Sean Kennif has 
taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera GUIDING LIGHT). Instead of 
exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current TV craze (since 
the film does largely appear to be a satire of Television, albeit one that 
would feel more appropriate in the '80s than the '00s), the film simply uses 
Betty's delusions as a plot device to get her from point A to B. No progress 
is made and little is unearthed except that maybe LaBute could use a bit of 
rest and a lot of contemplation.

Review for Duets (2000)
Starring: Gwyneth Paltrow, Paul Giamatti, Huey Lewis, Andre Braugher, Maria 
Bello, Scott Speedman, Angie Dickinson
Expectations are an odd thing. (Here comes the segue…wait for it). Last week 
I went to see NURSE BETTY with high apple pie in the sky hopes, for you see 
the picture had not only garnered a screenplay award at the prestigious 
CANNES FILM FESTIVAL, but an A grade from the mostly trustworthy folk at 
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY, among a veritable avalanche of positive reviews. And I 
have no clue what any of them were talking about. The movie was a hodgepodge 
of indie irritations (I've taken to calling them "indieisms", an example of 
which could be those ever so common hip, articulate philosophy minded hit 
men) filtered through a mainstream feel-good sensibility; it's one of the few 
films aimed at both the audiences for schmaltzy STEPMOM-like hokum and 
cynical, ironical PULP FICTION-like grit. A week later I trudge into DUETS, 
my hopes dulled to nada just from glancing at its highly negative notices, 
plus rumors of Disney's uncertainty with the film, and some last minute 
re-shoots. Naturally I was expecting a train wreck. Instead I got a minor 
fender bender. A bicycle pile-up really. And I groaned and rolled my eyes a 
whole lot less than I did through BETTY. But oh yes, I did groan and roll my 
eyes. Though because of what I stated above in my oh so perceptive opening 
sentence, I can't really be mad at this flick; compared to what I thought I 
was in store for, DUETS was very nearly a blessing.
It's a strange film in that it has moments of greatness, coupled with clichés 
that should have been retired way before we entered the 90's. We get yet 
another pairing of a black guy and white guy who initially don't quite know 
what to make of the other, then eventually falling in love (…but not in a 
homosexual way), the estranged father and daughter (the father is a deadbeat 
type who wants nothing to do with his daughter, and frankly I'd feel the same 
way if she were played by Gwenyth Paltrow in blonde airhead mode), and the 
kind hooker who falls for the straight laced guy (nuff' said there). DUETS 
even includes a more recent motif; the family man who goes berserk like Kevin 
Spacey in AMERICAN BEAUTY, only instead of black mailing his boss and lusting 
after his daughter's teenage friends, he pierces his ears and paints his toe 
nails cherry red. Despite all that, I still found much to like amid this 
particular mess; it's sometimes clever, occasionally poignant, but just when 
you think you're watching a quality picture it slaps you in the face with an 
utterly dopey Nora Ephron moment (this occurs in nearly every scene with 
Paltrow).
The flick veers off into three separate stories, with only one worth paying 
attention to, not because it's so well done, rather because its performers 
manage to transcend all the lameness. We begin with Huey Lewis as a karaoke 
hustler (yep, that's when the first eye roll occurred), who stumbles into a 
bar looking like he doesn't know his right from left, trounces up to a 
bragging karaoke champ and mumbles "what the hell is this, karate-oke?" This 
leads to some spectacular singing by Lewis, which by the way is the one thing 
this film gets right every time. DUETS is like a modern musical, here, the 
actors have a reason to belt out tunes; they're performing. And even if the 
actors (all of whom do their own voice work with the exception of Braugher 
who was dubbed) don't hit all the right notes, they give confident and wildly 
energetic turns-- I practically had to hold myself in that sticky multiplex 
seat to keep from leaping in front of the screen and dancing like a fool. 
Even the weasel-voiced Gimatti does a fine job (after a purposely shaky 
start) with his rendition of HELLO IT'S ME by Todd Rundgren.
Huey Lewis doesn't give a great acting performance but I forgive him, 
considering that he has one the most interesting faces I've seen on the 
silver screen in a while. Time worn and handsome, his features are like a 
well-tread road map propped up by his inquisitive eyebrows. He looks like the 
beaten man he's playing. We find that he has an estranged daughter, Liv 
(Gwyneth Paltrow) who wants to get to know him, though he resists. Once this 
business starts, every scene between them becomes clichesville, with Paltrow 
pouting and scrunching her face up as if she were trying to capture the 
nuances of a Jennifer Love Hewitt performance. It's her most annoying work 
yet, though she kinda makes up for it when she gets to sing, which she does 
with sensuous aplomb. Nonetheless, their happy ending is a bit sudden and 
anti-climactic (nothing the characters do suggest the sudden change that 
occurs) though it too leads to some good stuff, notably a duet between 
Paltrow and Lewis to Smokey Robinson's CRUISIN' that had me smiling despite 
the falseness of its build-up. Like everyone in the film, the pair is on its 
way to Omaha for a karaoke showdown and, hopefully, some prize money.
Less annoying but still pretty bad, is the mini-story about the sweet-hearted 
hooker who meets a wannabe priest, now underachieving cab driver played by TV 
hunk Scott Speedman. I'm not familiar with Speedman and he's easily the worst 
link here with his dull line readings and utter inexpressivness; still, I'm 
convinced that once he masters a second facial expression they'll be no 
stopping him. This is one of those performances where the actor relies on his 
good-natured smile far too much, and it is indeed one of those sparkling 
"look at me!" Tom Cruise smiles. This smirk factory generates no chemistry 
with his female co-star, Maria Bello, who's so good she actually had me sorta 
enjoying the umpteenth variation on the ol' hooker with a heart of gold (see, 
she's different cause she sings too).
The third thread works out best, which is something, considering it has the 
most to negotiate. This is the one with Paul Giamatti as a sad sack 
businessman going certifiable, ditching his job and heading out on the road 
in search of freedom and, apparently, cigarettes. He impulsively picks up a 
hitchhiker played by the great Andre Braugher of the great (and no 
longer…R.I.P.) HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET. They have some terrific scenes 
together, particularly a thrilling bit where Giamatti teaches Braugher to 
drive, and does so very badly. The problem here is that they go from being a 
fairly genial couple (with vaguely haunted undertones) to a grim pairing 
after some completely out of place violence. This was the problem Disney had 
with the film, and they made the director, Bruce Paltrow (Gwyneth's father, 
again, nuff said), trim much of the objectionable material. So we don't 
really see anything, but the act is still there casting a pall over a film 
that spent most of its time working for a fairly light hearted tone.
The basic theme DUETS presents isn't a bad one; it being that the patrons who 
fill out karaoke bars ("it's a rush like you wouldn't believe," one character 
enthuses) are lonely and looking for some kind, any kind, of connection. 
Fine, but then don't make these characters so damn common, and don't put them 
through paces we've seen over and over (that was my personal aside to the 
film makers). The un-negotiable problem of the film lies in its screenplay; 
it's as if the writer, John Byrum, was too scared to tell a story too 
different, so he wound up filling his film with recognizable character types. 
And who's that gonna please?

Review for Play It to the Bone (1999)
PLAY IT TO THE BONE (2000)
GRADE: C-
Director: Ron Shelton
Screenplay: Ron Shelton
Starring: Woody Harrelson, Antonio Banderas, Lolita Davidovich, Lucy Lui, Tom
Sizemore, Robert Wagner
 
PLAY IT TO THE BONE reeks of desperation. It was written and directed by Ron
Shelton, who has managed to base his career on creating quality sports films
(and think of all the directors who can't make one good sports film). BONE is
his first major failure, a movie so derivative that a computer program using
only stock parts from past Shelton films could have assembled it. Here we have
the girl who is in love with the two completely opposite macho lugs (sounds a
bit like BULL DURHAM, and hey, TIN CUP as well). The two macho lugs are made to
compete against each other (TIN CUP, WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP). And the girl really
adores both of them but can never decide between the two, presumably because
the director can't either (BULL DURHAM). Though Shelton does throw something
new at us: This time all his female characters lack substance. BONE is
Shelton's own STARDUST MEMORIES, and like the Woody Allen movie, Shelton takes
every charming aspect of his work and overdoes it to the point of irritation.
Vince (Woody Harrelson) and Ceaser (Antonio Banderas) are two out of work
boxers offered a chance to fight each other on an undercard for a Mike Tyson
brawl. Okay, why not? A contrivance, or problem, depending on your perspective
(I prefer the former) arises. The fight is in Vegas and neither of the two have
any cash for airfare. (Forget about maybe asking the fight promoters to forward
them the money). So Caesar is hastened into begging his girlfriend, Grace
(Lolita Davidovich) for a ride. She agrees, though there is a catch: she is
Vince's former girlfriend. And hilarity ensues, right? Wrong. What ensues is a
lengthy, been-there-done-that ride through the desert, that had me incessantly
thinking, are we there yet? By the time we got there, I was just about to nod
off, but thankfully Shelton tosses some much needed (though completely
gratuitous) nudity on the screen. Thus, my interest was momentarily sustained.
Harrelson and Banderas are essentially doing the same jokey macho schtick
Harrelson did with Snipes in WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP. The actors work well
together, but everything they say, and every conflict between them feels
manufactured in order to pad out the running time. As characters they are both
underdeveloped except for some outrageous quirks that are supposed to be
amusing because they are so at odds with the characters other traits. Vince is
a womanizing, ex drug addict Jesus freak (he scribbles JESUS LOVES YOU on a
bathroom stall, which I admit, is a first), who occasionally envisions Jesus.
And, Caesar is a manly, velvety smooth Spaniard who went gay for a year after
losing a boxing match.
When the dynamic between the three grows tiresome, Shelton introduces another
character into the fray, Lia (Lucy Lui), a hitchhiker who practically demands
sex once she gets in the car. Lia is little more than a male sex fantasy kept
around for a while in order to get the male audience members salivating. Once
she abruptly exits the picture, Shelton has Davidovich change into an
alluringly slinky red dress with copious amounts of cleavage on display. She
even does a slow-motion walk out of the ladies room, while the camera
salaciously caresses her body. It's too bad Shelton never gives Davidovich
anything to do besides look real hot. She is personality barren except for her
love of "mountain striations" (another stupid quirk that I think was supposed
to make me chuckle but instead made me check the time on my wristwatch).
So how is the fight, you ask? Shelton goes for broke with his finale; techno
beats pulsate, the sinewy stars pummel each other into pulpy blobs, casual
views of celebrities in the audience (look it's James Woods in some hip
gold-tinted sunglasses!), and the aforementioned gratuitous nudity. Now how the
hell could a director manage to shove nudity in the middle of a boxing match?
Believe it or not, for some inexplicable reason Harrelson envisions silicon
enhanced topless ring girls in the midst of his battle. I doubt even Oliver
Stone could find meaning in that.
Now, I know, maybe I'm being a little hard on what is essentially a very 1980's
Don Simpson\Jerry Bruckheimerish buddy movie. What the hell was I expecting,
THE PIANO? No, but I was hoping for something a little less formulaic. Shelton
is the only director who has in virtually every film pulled off a compelling
story (with laughs and pathos) set amidst a sports backdrop. Here he takes the
easy way out, cribbing from his own material, as well as including nearly every
road movie cliché right down to the very antiquated, American car that is the
customary form of transportation in a road movie. Interesting that one of the
first releases of the new millennium would feel just as antiquated as that damn
car.

Review for Reindeer Games (2000)
Starring: Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, Gary Sinise, James Frain, Donal 
Logue, Clarence Williams, Dennis Farina, Danny Trejo
REINDEER GAMES is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by Ehren 
Kruger (SCREAM 3 and ARLINGTON RD are the others, each derivative in their 
own special way). The guy can't seem to write believable dialogue (Sample 
from REINDEER GAMES: "Rule #1: Never put a car thief behind the wheel"), 
create multi-faceted characters, or even engineer coherent plots but he sure 
knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns (no matter if each 
one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely). His screenplay for 
REINDEER GAMES turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching 
the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight. 
I can just envision Kruger laughing behind his keyboard, "Oh you thought my 
movie was gonna go here, f*ck you jack ass, take that twist, decipher this 
mother f*cker!" It's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling 
out money to see his stupid movie. And why the hell would anyone want to 
invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for 
no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is? Auteur 
theory be damned; it's Kruger's "style", not the director's that winds up on 
screen.
Kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "sometimes less 
is more". And his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals; ARLINGTON 
RD's ending is a direct steal from the much better Alan J. Pakula thriller 
THE PARALLAX VIEW, and in REINDEER GAMES we get this ol' gem; Character 
incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know (pronouns used 
to protect the gender of the "character"...grammar be damned). "How did you 
know that?" the stunned protagonist asks, suddenly realizing that the 
character was in on the whole thing all along. . .
Since twist endings are currently so in vogue, and seeing as how Kruger's 
screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending, I guess 
it's no wonder why he works so frequently. He's quickly becoming MIRAMAX's 
Mickey Mouse; the company has already signed him to work on several of their 
upcoming projects. This is appropriate considering that MIRAMAX (which used 
to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films) has 
quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports (LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL) 
and Freddie Prinze Jr. vehicles. Their company's current logo could be "We 
ride the trends".
REINDEER GAMES stars Ben Affleck as Rudy, a supposedly hardened criminal 
spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing 
atop his head. Although Affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to 
insinuate bad assness, he plays the role like Steve Guttenberg preciously 
mugging through a POLICE ACADEMY flick. Affleck is such a puppy dog that it's 
impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without 
becoming nearly everyone's bitch.
The role itself is so badly written (the character only grows balls when the 
plot calls for it), the twists so outrageous, and the directing so self 
consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as I can recall 
a recent "serious" movie getting. It may have been wiser had the film makers 
simply went all the way in that direction, casting Jerry Seinfeld as the 
hardened criminal and Howard Stern as the sniveling bad guy (who's played 
here by Gary Sinise in yet another over the top villain performance)
James Frain is Nick, Rudy's cellmate, a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal 
in the gorgeous Ashley Mason (Charlize Theron). Ashley is a prison groupie 
who sends Nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one 
picture of him. Which works out fine since the character is killed in a 
near-riot, and Rudy (who was to be paroled on the same day as Nick) takes his 
place, which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between Ashley and 
Rudy (so frenzied it kinda looks like rape) and a surprise visit from 
Ashley's brother, Gabriel (Gary Sinise), who waltzes into their shabby hotel 
room flanked by his thuggish co-horts. He plans to rob an Indian Casino on 
Christmas Eve with the assistance of Rudy who he thinks is Nick who, 
according to what he wrote in the letters to Ashley, used to work as a guard 
in the Indian casino. Though by the end, the film pulls the rug out from 
under us so frequently that everything I've described might as well be 
irrelevant.
This is what you can expect should you chose to take this Reindeer on; 
several scenes in which, after catching his prey, the bad guy proceeds to 
stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and 
crack a stupid one-liner. Included: Two (2) scenes of two (2) different bad 
guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him 
(one following the other no less). Though it's an action film, the ending is 
more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered 
character actor after another while 
Affleck looks on, incredulous as the audience.
The flick was directed by John Frankenheimer, a straightforward action 
director who lucked into THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE early in his career, fell 
off the A-list following a string of flops and now, in his old age, is slowly 
climbing his way back up. It would be a success story if he were choosing 
better scripts but his last major film was RONIN (one of those almost but not 
quite movies) which followed THE ISLAND OF DR.MORNEAU (you remember, the one 
with Marlon Brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo), and now 
this. He films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which I like 
considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond 
flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped MTV audience to 
pick apart. Problem is these action scenes (nearly all failed escapes) serve 
no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to 
remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed 
radio play.
Character problems abound; Rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door 
earnestness and hard edged wiseacre, the latter of which is not (at least at 
this point) something Ben Affleck is capable of pulling off. The former he 
can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while 
those around him growl and swear. But then suddenly Affleck starts growling 
and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a Tarantino 
gangster.
Charlize Theron, an extraordinary talent, is, like Affleck, playing whatever 
part the script requires her to play, whether it be vulnerability at one 
moment, anger at the next. She never has a chance to evince any charm or make 
much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes (Frankenheimer 
has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this.
Gary Sinise has played this role frequently, and here, as in SNAKE EYES, he 
does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol (the guy must 
be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of 
control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more), that it 
becomes more of an annoyance (oh there he goes againâŚ) than a threat. These 
are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with 
little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its 
audience.

Review for Keeping the Faith (2000)
Starring: Ben Stiller, Jenna Elfman, Edward Norton, Anne Bancroft, Milos
Foreman, Ken Leung, Kryss Anderson, Eli Wallach, Ron Rifkin, Rena Sofer, Lisa
Edelstein,
I could picture Paul Mazursky (NEXT STOP GREENWICH VILLAGE, BLUME IN LOVE,
TEMPEST) making this film in the 70's, possibly casting Richard Benjamin in the
Ben Stiller role and Donald Sutherland in the Edward Norton role. He would give
the film an edge, address ideological concerns, and make us laugh. Norton, who
also directed, just makes us laugh, and I'm not the least bit ungrateful (well
maybe a wee bitsy bit) but it would seem that an actor so edgy in his roles
(from THE FIGHT CLUB to AMERICAN HISTORY X) would want to do more than make
what feels like an homage to the innocuous fare of Rob Reiner and Gary
Marshall. But like I said, it made me laugh, so I'll excuse Norton for aiming
lower than I would have preferred.
In KEEPING THE FAITH Ben Stiller plays Jake, a renegade rabbi (yes, you did
read that correctly) eager to jazz up those "boring" religious services with
some unconventional techniques like group meditation and even inviting a gospel
chorus to belt out prayers. Meanwhile nearly every female member of the
congregation is just itching to get into Jake's tallas. Norton gives himself
the decidedly bland role of Brian the priest, a character who mostly functions
as Jake's best friend. These two are childhood chums along with a third, Anna,
a sweet Irish girl who moved away just when the trio's friendship was
blossoming. She returns fifteen years later to meet them in New York. Now the
sweet little girl is a beautiful blonde businesswoman played by Jenna Elfman,
who is getting less and less annoying with every consecutive picture she
appears in (see her at her most irritating in a movie I'm still trying to
forget, KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBEâŚeven typing that title conjures up awful
celluloid reminisces). Though both men develop crushes on their old friend,
Jake is the one who gets lucky when Anna reveals that she has similar feelings
for him. They begin a love affair without telling Brian.
The film works mostly on the strengths of its performers. Norton shines,
proving as adept at physical comedy and clever witticisms as he is at
controlled intensity. Milos Foreman (who directed Norton in THE PEOPLE VS LARRY
FLYNT) effectively fulfils all the requisite duties as Brian's wise old mentor.
Anne Bancroft is thankfully restrained as the Jewish mother, a type of role
that many an actress (Hello Shelly Winters!) have gleefully over-exaggerated.
Jake's prospective paramour's are well played by the very funny Lisa Edelstein
as a fitness buff who asks Jake to punch her, and Catherine Zeta Jones
look-alike Rena Sofer as a self-involved news anchor who seems completely
intoxicated by her own good looks. Elfman is unusually charming, and judging
from her performance here, I can actually see myself warming up to her as a
leading lady.
KEEPING THE FAITH also generates some (unintentional) laughter from a severe
height difference between the statuesque Elfman and midget-like Stiller. In the
awful film version of FRANKIE AND JOHNNY (directed by Gary Marshall) the crew
reportedly had to dig ditches to put Michelle Phieffer in, in order for her
love interest, the diminutive Al Pacino, to appear her height. Stiller gets no
such consideration, instead he must hop around Elfman looking like a little
puppy dog angling for a kiss. The actor, who I found enormously annoying just
six years ago in REALITY BITES, has grown into a rather likeable comic leading
man. He has mastered the witty-hang-dog charm of (take your pick) John Cusack
and Robert Downy Jr., and let go of the faux-Woody Allen impersonation that
brought down the bar on most of his early performances. Despite the
unintentional (I think) sight gag of Stiller and Elfman (a visual I will
picture in my head whenever I feel glum) those two do generate a considerable
amount of chemistry, unlike Julia Roberts and the blinking, stuttering mess
that is Hugh Grant in NOTTING HILL. Compared to NOTTING HILL and most other
contemporary studio romantic comedies, KEEPING THE FAITH is a winner. Its cast
has appeal to spare, but I couldn't help but wish they were using it at the
service of a more challenging screenplay.
There are so many directions in which this story could have gone that it
disappoints me a little to see it take such a worn out route. How about a love
story between the priest and the rabbi? This is not only new, but we still have
the sight gag of a tiny Stiller bounding around a towering (by comparison)
Norton. Or maybe a SHAMPOO-like comic character study, but instead of a
womanizing hairdresser, a womanizing rabbi. Stiller's performance hints
slightly at low key insolence, he could be the kind of guy capable of taking
advantage of all the affection his ardent female fans offer him. I would have
liked to see that taken somewhere. But alas we must settle for predictability.
The characters go and do what we expect. They follow an outline, though Norton
and writer Stuart Blumberg make them mostly intelligent, funny, and charming,
even added comic relief from a wily Asian salesman (a hilarious Tony Leung) and
an Indian\Irish bartender work, when in most films they wouldn't rise above
annoyingly insincere caricatures. Here they are still caricatures, but fun
caricatures, given entertaining post millennium multi-cultural back-stories.
Norton gets a hand full of kudos for making good use of the New York City
locale; a city known for its richness in diverse ethnicities, a fact that Woody
Allen's films always ignore. Allen sees New York as a haven for elitist Jews
rather than the cultural melting pot it is.
But I still feel Norton missed out on an opportunity to make a substantive
comic drama about opposing religions between pals, the kind of film we would
remember in the future the way many recall the THE GRADUATE or CARNAL
KNOWLEDGE. Instead he chose to make a product, one that is glossy, well made,
and amusing, but one that feels manufactured rather than from the heart.
Despite all my caveats I still find myself, days after watching the film,
thinking about and smiling at Stiller's wry delivery or Leung's chuckle worthy
rendition of Rick Springfield's JESSE'S GIRL. If I weren't so damn picky I'd
probably give the film a solid B, but then I'd be plagued with guilt so we'll
leave it as it is. And as it is it looks as if Edward Norton would like to
follow in the footsteps of Rob Reiner, which is something you can take however
you wish.

Review for 8MM (1999)
Author: iysmall@aol.com (Ron Small)
8MM (1999)
Grade: D+
Director: Joel Schumacher
Screenplay: Andrew Kevin Walker
Starring: Nicholas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare,
Anthony Heald, Catherine Keener, Myra Carter, Christopher Bauer
 
The subject matter that is dealt with (and I use that term lightly) in 8MM is
an undeniably sensational one. It's too bad that its filmmaker's seem less
interested in the film's lurid topic then in the simplistic conventions of the
action genre. 8MM is ostensibly a private eye flick that aims for something
more, though ends up with something less.
Tom Welles (a morose Nicholas Cage) is a young private investigator searching
for a case that will propel his career to the level ofâŚSam Spade, I guess.
Such a case is presented, and he jumps at the chance to solve what might be a
murder filmed on 8mm film. The reel was discovered in the vault of a recently
deceased socialite, and Welles has been hired by the socialite's unsuspecting
widow to determine if the "killing" is the real thing.
The existence of snuff films (the definition of "snuff film" being a film in
which a real murder occurs) is the stuff of urban legends. I have actually met
people who claim to know someone, who dated someone, whose grandmother viewed a
snuff film (or something along those lines). Yeah whatever, and Elvis lives. As
far as I've been able to gauge within my twenty years of experience on this
planet, there is no market for this sort of thing. But it doesn't seem entirely
impossible, does it, what with FACES OF DEATH (a collection of "accidental"
deaths captured on videotape and packaged for your entertainment) readily
available in many video stores.
What a completely compelling subject matter for a film to explore, right? A
topic that is in touch with the most sadistic portions of the social zeitgeist
and contains a built in sensationalistic lure. This is the stuff of great pulp
thrillers. And the opening led me to believe that for once Schumacher (the
imbecile who ran the BATMAN franchise into the ground) was on the right track.
The first ten minutes are appropriately ominous; the colors stylishly muted,
and the score an extraneous, Arabic sounding something or other that fits
nicely with the proceedings. As it turns out, 8MM isn't so much an
investigation into snuff, as it is a full-length feature film version of one of
those crime reenactments regularly staged on AMERICA'S MOST WANTED.
The imagery we are shown is dark and garish, but it's equally over done and
fallacious, like a Hollywood set that calls too much attention to itself. I was
reminded of Julie Salamon's book THE DEVIL'S CANDY, which was a guide to the
production of the adaptation of Tom Wolfe's masterful novel, THE BONFIRE OF
VANITIES. One passage recounts how the film crew littered the streets of the
Bronx with extras dressed as stereotypical pimps, hookers, and drug dealers to
fill out the scenery, and generate fear within the white middle class audience
wherein the film was aimed. They even included burning cars for additional
hyperbole, as if it was needed. Shumaker does something similar. When Tom
Welles contacts Max, an adult video store clerk (played with maximum quirkiness
by Joaquin Phoneix), he is eventually led into an underground porno ring. The
set looks like a dungeon straight out of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, with dingy,
florescent lights barely illuminating the nightmare. The film later implies
that this dungeon is supposed to be spooky, yet somewhat stimulating as well.
It only succeeds at the former; the movie fails to show us how any of this
stuff could be any thing more then revolting.
The porn dealers, are presented as a ravaged bunch, who hardly speak a word,
and when they do speak, its so damn creepy we wish they'd stop. They are the
Hollywoodized vision of porn dealers, miles from the real thing. I suspect the
real guys would be just as scary, but in the way that that egomaniac Quentin
Tarantino is scary, rather than the quietly menacing figures 8MM gives us.
Welles and Max explore bondage clubs that look like HBO's REAL SEX series meets
HELLRAISER complete with Euro trash porn dealers decked out in ebony latex.
However the primary villains are depicted as conventionally evil louts who
wouldn't be out of place in a LETHAL WEAPON movie. That especially goes for
Peter Stormare, who plays the main antagonist in such a laughable, over the top
manner he could be auditioning for the role of lead villain in DIE HARD 4.
This wouldn't be as grating if it were put to the service of a typical action
romp, but Schumaker is supposedly charting new out territory with a subject
matter that is indeed, deeply disturbing; so disturbing that it's maddening to
see it given such a "commercial" treatment.
The film draws you into its satiated web, but for all the wrong reasons: It
trots out an abundance of home video recorded "killings", that are graphically
realized for no purpose. 8MM obviously isn't interested in exploring the topic
in a serious manner, so why present us with torturous scenes of grisly violence
if it's at the service of such an ordinary Hollywood crime thriller. (THE
GENERAL'S DAUGHTER tried the same thing to the exact same effect).
The detective portion of the story is comparatively weak: Characters are
identified by tattoos, and Cage stumbles upon a diary that the cops should have
found a year earlier.
Ahh Cage, what happened to that Nicholas Cage? He was so charismatic in FACE
OFF, but so dull in everything since. He continues that backward trend,
appearing drowsy and delivering all his lines in a tone as flat as diet coke.
But since this is a Schumacher film, he at least looks cool in a fully black
ensemble that gives him the appearance of death freezed over. For most of the
movie his character is a detached bore who, towards the end, abruptly
transforms into a psychotic nut case. In visual terms that means that Cage
contorts his face like Jim Carrey's evil twin brother while breathlessly
muttering things like "It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay". But never mind
that, the incongruous switch in character makes no sense. Nothing that preceded
it suggests any monumental change is coming; it just happens. I suspect the
switch has more to do with Schumacher's desire to further pander to his
audience's blood lust rather than genuine character motivation. Following the
transformation, in an incredibly bullying denouement, Cage appoints himself as
an Angel of Death executing every one guilty of wrongdoing. The repulsive
crimes committed by the villains give us reason to cheer for Cage as he coldly
dispatches them ("I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie") with less care
then Charles Bronson in DEATH WISH. Schumacher makes his bad guys so
un-redeemably evil that they laugh when they feel pain, and challenge Cage to
"do it already". We crave for them to die horribly, and the movie indulges in
our reactionary fantasies.
Should this film be lauded because it looks as a good as a commercial for
grime, and pushes all the right buttons? I don't think so. The meat of the
movie could be called entertaining, but in the same way it might be
entertaining to watch those lurid FOX "shocumentaries".
Some have criticized me for lauding movies like SEVEN and THE FIGHT CLUB,
claiming that they are cut from the same cloth as 8MM. I disagree. Both of
those films offered insight into the horrifying violence that they presented.
Schumacher may think he's doing that, but I doubt he could ever make a truly
gritty film without commercializing it (see FALLING DOWN). His nihilism is just
as stylized as the candy colored cartoon world of BATMAN AND ROBIN; it's also
just as phony. Like the extreme porn that is the subject of 8MM, the film
itself is an extreme, sexualized violent fantasy filmed like the most
conventional potboiler

Review for Meet the Parents (2000)
Screenplay: James Herzfeld, John Hamburg
Starring: Robert De-Niro, Ben Stiller, Terri Polo, Blythe Danner, James 
Rebhorn, Owen Wilson, Jon Abrahams, Phyllis George, Thomas McCarthy, Nicole 
DeHuff, Judah Friedlander, Kali Rocha
In MEET THE PARENTS, Robert De Niro, one of our most studied character 
actors, progresses further into staking out a little niche in playing 
identifiable caricatures. De Niro does this with about as much laid back ease 
as he employed energetic gusto for the wounded anti-hero roles he used to 
essay in the 70's. I'd rather see him in more movies like TAXI DRIVER or 
RAGING BULL, but I can't deny that he's been very (if not equally) effective 
in his latest ventures. Playing the aging, sad sack Mafia man in ANALYZE 
THIS, he indulged in a heightened variation of the wise guys he used to excel 
at dramatically, his face crinkled and pained with a tone thick, as if full 
of pasta; it was a terrific counterpoint to Billy Crystal's nervous nilly of 
a psychiatrist. Though I didn't really care for that film (it was more a 
series of skits [albeit some funny] that didn't really come together) I 
nevertheless enjoyed the anxious chemistry cultivated between Crystal and De 
Niro.
MEET THE PARENTS is also like a series of skits, these connected by the 
nightmare conceit of a groom attempting to impress his possible in-laws to be 
over one horrendous weekend. But here the skits hang together rather nicely, 
and Ben Stiller makes an even more likeable comic leading man than Crystal's 
callow invention. And De Niro's more interesting too; we've already seen him 
do the Mafia schtick more than we've seen George W. Bush make a mockery out 
of the human language (see, I follow politics), but I can't recall him ever 
playing a creepily wholesome, grandfatherly type; I'm guessing his research 
here amounted to viewing a slew of FATHER KNOWS BEST reruns.
But the film takes a while to get good; it opens pretty badly with a nearly 
nauseating shower of sweetness. We start with a scene in which the earnest, 
eager to please, and very unfortunately named Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) 
proposes to an off screen paramour. He's so sincere and puppy doggish, his 
blue eyes twinkling with hope, that we just know some kind of gag is 
a'brewin, and of course the camera angle switches to reveal that he's really 
proposing to an old man. Cue the laugh track. He's actually practicing for 
the real one, an easy guffaw, and the next scene continues in this dubious 
vein with Stiller attempting to propose to his girlfriend, Pam (Terri Polo) 
while several (contrived) interruptions manage to stop him from doing so. At 
this point I'm debating on whether or not to high tail it outta here and 
sneak into the new Stallone picture next door (his fifth come back vehicle, I 
believe, which should at least be good for a few laughs).
Thankfully the picture hits its stride in the very next scene, in which 
Stiller insists on spending the weekend with Pam and her parents, giving him 
the opportunity to do the right thing, that being, to ask for her beloved 
father's approval. On the way to the parents, the picture settles into a 
comedy of extreme errors, with the world seemingly conspiring against Greg. 
After a big hubbub with some bag checkers, he checks his mini-suitcase at the 
airport, later finding his worse fears confirmed; it's been misplaced, 
(presumably by the ear muff wearing blue collar folk in whose hands we must 
entrust our sacred belongings), along with it, the engagement ring and all 
his clothing. Poor Greg warily stumbles to a busy customer service lady, who 
pooh-poohs him away just as a baby upchucks all over him and the only clothes 
he has left.
Now Greg must go to already one of the most nerve wracking meetings 
in his life, stinking like "sour milk" which certainly doesn't leave a great 
impression on Pam's stern authoritarian father (yup, Bobby D.), who's so 
square and twinkly eyed he's damn near psychotic. We first meet De Niro as he 
peeps out the second floor window, his eyes narrowing like a Cheetah ready to 
pounce. (Additionally, menacing thriller music pipes up to let us know this 
guy means business, as if we couldn't already tell). Their first meeting is a 
gem with Stiller, at his awkward best, trying so visibly hard to say the 
right thing, but flubbing horribly, which always gets a laugh, then the 
camera clicking over to De Niro's frowning mug, incredulous that his daughter 
is sleeping with such a fool, which gets a bigger laugh.
Stiller, essentially playing the same role he essayed in FLIRTING WITH 
DISASTER (my favorite of his bumbling duffas trilogy) and THERE'S SOMETHING 
ABOUT MARY (a close second), has become an expert at flustered comic 
awkwardness. He's like a handsome Woody Allen, with his nervous tics closer 
to reality and less exaggerated than that little pipsqueak's (I use the term 
affectionately). Stiller has one of those common faces; look at him quick and 
you might mistake him for someone else like Hank Azaria or John Cusack or the 
guy who bags your groceries. He's an every man-type, almost immediately 
likeable, maybe because he reminds us of someone we know, and maybe because 
as an actor, he isn't afraid to look foolish or even let himself be upstaged 
by bodily fluids. Stiller is such a likeable presence that despite his 
character's occasional idiotic tendencies, we remain in his corner, almost 
protective of him; we might laugh at the guy as he's making a fool out of 
himself but ultimately we want him to win.
The wry Owen Wilson (SHANGHAI NOON) pops up in a bit part that could be 
described as the anti-every man. He's Pam's ex, a self-made millionaire and 
one of those fellows who likes to list his amazing achievements in an off 
hand way as if to say "ahh shucks, it was really nothing". Terri Polo has a 
bigger role, though isn't required to do much beside look at Stiller with 
either lust or concern. Blythe Danner is the WASPy mother whose greeting to 
her daughter, "There's my whittle girl", actually made me blush. Along the 
way director Jay Roach includes some amusing broad caricatures in minor bits, 
like the overweight stoner behind the supermarket counter who gets laughs 
because he isn't as stupidly over the top as he would be in an Adam Sandler 
picture, or the monotone stewardess who acts like a robot with a glitch in 
her system.
The film itself is little more than Stiller's non-stop attempts to ingratiate 
himself to De Niro and then the beautiful, cringe-inducing backfire, 
concluded by Stiller's hilariously perplexed mug, his jaw practically down to 
his knees, and De Niro, scowling as if to say "who is this man and what the 
hell is he doing in my house?" There isn't any emotional pull (well, a little 
bit but it's all arbitrary stuff about fathers not letting their little girls 
grow up, stuff that probably won't resonate with anybody who's watched a 
steady diet of sitcoms), or unnecessary sub plots or much of anything to get 
in the way of the film's sole desire to make its audience laugh and maybe 
even nod its head in recognition. There are occasional lulls (not many, but 
enough to note) that exist solely because the film isn't concerned with 
giving us much of anything besides the laughs (yes a minor complaint, but a 
picture like FLIRTING WITH DISASTER is so much more satisfying because of its 
added humanity).
Still, MEET THE PARENTS is very funny and well put together, especially for a 
broad mainstream comedy. The comic set pieces are similar to those found in 
the NATIONAL LAMPOON VACATION films, where despite that most of the gags are 
projected before they occur, they still get laughs; in this movie they work 
because of director Roach's canny comic technique (it's all in the reaction 
shots). In one scene we see a typical comic misunderstanding in which Stiller 
gets what he thinks is his suitcase back. It isn't. He leaves the room, and 
we see De Niro pick the lock to go through it, checking up on his daughter's 
suitor to, I guess, make sure he isn't some kind of wacko (which in itself is 
kind of wacko). Before he opens the thing we just know there's gonna be 
something odd inside, and therie is, but what sells the bit is De-Niro's 
slight facial grimace; we can feel his disgust.
For the most part MEET THE PARENTS doesn't follow the string of recent 
comedies that mistake oozing bodily fluids for punch lines (the descendants 
of MARY, I'm thinking of ROAD TRIP in particular). Though it does what's 
logically next in line; it mines the embarrassment of Greg's situation for 
all it's worth and then some. Right when you thought they were down with the 
poor fellow, the film makers make every little social lie, every tiny misstep 
take on near epic proportions, like when he lets the cat out of his sight, or 
smokes a cigarette on the roof, again, we know what's going to happen, but 
the laughs come in seeing it happen well.

Review for High Fidelity (2000)
Screenplay: D.V DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack, Scott Rosenberg
Starring: John Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Jack Black, Todd Louiso, Lisa Bonet,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, Tim Robbins, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Sara Gilbert, Joelle
Carter
John Cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his
respective film roles. So effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there,
much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors (anyone
who can put the name James Rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat
themselves to a product from one of my sponsors). Example: The other day my
mother asked me (the expert, of course) if there were any movies out worth
seeing, never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- I'll never
forget the day she recommended that I go see A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY for god
sakes, and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that GO!
was a lot of fun (which it is), so I didn't see this as anything more than a
futile attempt at conversation. I muttered, with a little trepidation, that she
might enjoy HIGH FIDELITY. She responded with her usual query," Whose in that
one?" This is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the
kind of movie you went to see. If the reply is Julia Roberts you probably
assume it was something wispy and light, a Sylvester Stallone movie and you
picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing, and a
Woody Allen movie means hyper articulate white people (usually of the Jewish
faith) fretting about in some Upper East Side palace. Anyway, when I answered
"John Cusack", she replied with a rather stunned "Who?", as if it was
unreasonable for her to know whom I was referring to.
Now I know for a fact that my mother has seen several Cusack movies, most
recently BEING JOHN MALKOVICH and PUSHING TIN, but I suppose it's
understandable that she would not recognize the name, after all, for most,
names are tougher than faces. I showed her a picture of Cusack's mug in the
paper hoping for an "Oh - him, yes he's quite good" instead I got a "No - I
don't know him". At this point I was way beyond frustration into a realm of
nose hair yanking anger (yes, filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into
the nose hair pulling zone), till I realized something: I doubt that much of
America would recognize Cusack's relatively bland visage, or even the name
which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise,
one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding
car.
Cu-sack. Cu-sack - no, not quite as cool. I'm sure that twenty years from now
Cusack will forever be referred to as "the guy from (add in the Cusack film of
your choice)". He's not a brand name, and his movies usually aren't big
moneymakers, but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius.
With his pleasant, common man looks, and charming semi-articulate blatherings
he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's. From
THE SURE THING to SAY ANYTHING Cusack has merged the talents of early Tom Hanks
and early Jack Lemmon. Despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is
a variation of the character before it (the schlumpy every man), he's a
constantly enjoyable screen persona, like Albert Brooks or Woody Allen. And he
knows how to chose scripts, while the Stephan Baldwin's and Val Kilmer's seem
to put them selves in everything (the former actually had the insight to follow
up Oscar winner USUAL SUSPECTS with a Pauly Shore vehicle, and judging from his
latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent), Cusack
generally picks rewarding projects (save for the unwatchable HOT PURSUIT, a
1988 film also featuring a young Ben Stiller).
HIGH FIDELITY is his second collaboration with hit or miss English director
Stephan Fears (THE GRIFTERS, THE HI-LO COUNTRY), and it's a hit. It was also
co-written by Cusack, and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy,
GROSSE POINT BLANK. It's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film,
but as it progresses in its meandering fashion, the movie cast something of a
spell over me. HIGH FIDELITY begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal Rob,
a vinyl record store owner, who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall
with much abandon and educating us in his "top 5 break ups list". This is
something Cusack does the entire film a la FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. At first
the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed, mostly
because it reminded me so much of the film BODY SHOTS which used a similar
conceit, but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to Cusack's witty
delivery. He's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us.
Gradually the film settles into a SHAMPOO-like tragi-comic character study, of
a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure
out the true person he is (yes it's all very existential). Though that
plot-line is mostly enjoyable, the thing I liked the most about the film is how
much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters, all of whom (now
this is really something) are terrific enough to warrant their own films.
The best of which is Jack Black (of the very funny show TENACIOUS D, a program
that sadly went the way of Bruce Willis' hairâŚunfortunately that annoying
smirk remains), an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into
buying exactly what he wants them to buy. He's the kind of guy I'm sure we've
all met before, a blowhard who thinks he's always right and will do anything in
his power (be it yell, argue, insult) to hoist his opinion onto others. But I
like this guy, because of how Black plays him. The actor is portly with a round
baby face and crazy eyes, but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic
speed freak (which might be a bit of a redundant description, seeing as how all
the speed freaks I know are manic). He's the kind of supporting character who
would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films. (Look at what
that hack Jan de Bont did to poor Phillip Seymour Hoffman in TWISTER). But
Fears and Black never let that happen. The character, for all his shucking and
jiving is steeped in reality. He's over the top, but in a way we can all
probably relate to.
Catherine Zeta-Jones, in her brief role, gives a vivid portrayal of a women
completely enamored with her own "charm". Tim Robbins registers in an even
tinier part as a New Age-type, a character played entirely for cartoon yuks,
but still manages to work its desired comic effect. The one exception in the
acting department is a bit of a doozy, the main love interest played by Danish
actress Iben Hjejle (MIFUNE), who completely obliterates any trace of a Danish
accent, replacing it with a stilted American phonation. I give her kudos for
attempting such a contradictory role, but instead of being likeable, she comes
across as rather robotic, and as such it's hard to see why Cusack's character
would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful, intelligent
writer (Natasha Gregson Wagner) potentially waiting in the wings. This reminded
me of SAY ANYTHING, where the charming Cusack was paired with the charmless
Ione Skye, and in MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL where the poor
bastard had to put up with Alison Eastwood (whose unbelievably more wooden then
father, Clint for those "special people" whose wheels turn a little slower). In
fact Cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his, though I'd
bet that if Laura and Natasha switched roles, the result would be more
effective.
HIGH FIDELITY works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and
performances. Fears' direction is somewhat stilted, and the script is sometimes
a little too (and this is a word I'm beginning to hate to use but alas I must)
quirky for its own good (I think I'll blame that on Scott Rosenberg, who
judging from what he did with BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, CON AIR, and THINGS TO DO IN
DENVER WHILE YOUR DEAD, has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits
of this movie). But Cusack really does deserve an award, for being so
damnâŚCusackian. I'm afraid that his talents are so understated that he may
have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of
his considerable talent. His character, Rob (whose sort of like an older, more
bitter Lloyd from SAY ANYTHING) is funny and tragic without being pathetic, and
that Cusack can do all this, and still not imprint himself onto the minds of
most audiences, is something of an achievement.

Title
Review for Black and White (1999)
Starring: Power, Bijou Phillips, Brooke Shields, Robert Downy Jr., Ben Stiller,
Jared Leto, Allan Houston, Raekwon, William Lee Scott, Mike Tyson, Eddie Kaye
Thomas, Joe Pantoliano, Method Man, James Toback, Gaby Hoffman, Brett Rattner,
Kim Matulva, Claudia Schiffer, Marla Maples, Kidada Jones
In 1957 a young writer by the name of Norman Mailer composed the infamous
essay, THE WHITE NEGRO, a post-war musing designed as one of many strategies to
shock his way into becoming a major literary figure of Hemingwayesque stature.
Though the essay itself is consciously offensive (heralding the "Negro" as the
definition of coolness), but perhaps in spite of himself, Mailer caught sight
of a trend that was in its zygote stages; the glamorization of the black
lifestyle, a lifestyle that indicates fashionable oppression as its
provocateurist white members see it. The blackness projected by whites who want
to be black (somewhat offensively designated as wiggers) is all surface
hipness, for of course they cannot truly know what it means to be black, they
want to be the black they see presented on that dictator of youth culture, MTV.
They call each other "niggaz" and seek out black sex partners because they see
them as exotic, and they want to make themselves exotic and different. James
Toback's film is mostly about upper middle class whites who take on so-called
black vernacular, adorn themselves in the latest hip hop fashions, and steal
the attitudes of commercialized black culture.
Toback himself (like Mailer) has seemed in awe of this culture ever since the
early seventies when he began his film career. His screenplay for THE GAMBLER
(directed by Karel Reisz) was about a man who gambled, not for the money but
for the utter thrill of that win or lose moment. It wasn't the result that
propelled him but the process and by the end of the film when the gambler
ventures out into a dangerous black neighborhood, we realize that it is nothing
more than another gamble (one with his life). It's seen as the ultimate test of
man hood, and I don't doubt for one second that the gambler is a stand in for
Toback.
He explored a similar character in his directorial debut, my favorite Toback
film, FINGERS, which ended with a sensual menage a trois between two lithe
white women and a big burly black man (played by an eroticized Jim Brown) that
soon turned dangerous. This all while the white protagonist watches as if
viewing an animal make love to, then inflict pain upon his prey. The blackness
Toback gives us in BLACK AND WHITE is similar. At first it's presented as
sensual with ripe exoticism as the ultimate aphrodisiac, then titillation gives
way to fear--the message being one I'm sure Spike Lee would approve of: that
our cultures can never really mix it up without severe repercussions. Sadly,
Toback doesn't explore the issue, he exploits it. With this film he's making a
blaxploitation flick that thinks it's anthropology. He's so enthralled by rap,
by the very essence of soulful ebony sexuality (mostly male) that he forgets to
make an actual movie and by the end nothing is illuminated, except that Toback
clearly has issues.
The writer\director lays his themes out like bumper cars, all his various views
colliding into each other resulting in a mess of provocative ideas. It is
reported that about 85% of the film was improvised, and that certainly shows.
Improvisation is a chancy way to approach film. When it works it can be highly
invigorating as in some of he better Robert Altman films, though when it
doesn't, it can be torturously awkward as in some of the lesser Altman films.
In BLACK AND WHITE we get helpings of both, though I think by the end the
latter response wins out. Most of the invigorating exchanges happen when Robert
Downy JR (as an eccentric gay man, though acting completely different from the
eccentric gays he portrayed in HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS and WONDER BOYS) is on
screen. Much of the film's comedy comes from when he hits on various unassuming
men, one of those being Mike Tyson (who is fetishized here in the same way that
Jim Brown was in FINGERS), who comes across a little brighter than you would
expect, though reacts exactly the way you'd expect. Another terrific example is
a scene wherein a bunch of black gangsters confront a white club owner (Scott
Caan) over salary, with guns instead of negotiating tactics.
But alas, those are like a Janeane Garofalo appearance in a poorly made film
(i.e. just about her entire output). The energy of those scenes only work to
show how good the film could have been had Toback reigned himself in. Much of
the movie becomes repetitive with elliptical conversations that don't lead
anywhere. It's as if Toback blew his load early on and had nothing more to say
so he simply repeated himself. That's a shame because the essential idea, to
explore an identity crisis among white teenagers aching to be black (hip), is
one of great promise.
But Toback doesn't explore these ideas, or points of views, he simply has his
characters yap at us, using such devices as a documentarian who asks the white
kids direct questions (giving them a chance to provide lengthy explanations),
or unfocused conversations between blacks ("What do these white people want
from us"). Instead of exploring the culture, he presents us with diatribes and
monologues (all be it highly improvised, but Toback still controls the content)
given by a crew of actors all in hopes of getting to the "truth". Whatever
truths we get come entirely from these Hollywood actors (from teen idols like
Jared Leto and Elijah Wood to ex-supermodels making an attempt at artistic
credibility like Brooke Shields and Claudia Schiffer) attempting to emulate a
culture I doubt they know much about.
In the Tobakian tradition he intertwines a pulp thriller plot with his
ponderous anthropological explorations. That plot concerns a hyper verbal cop
(Ben Stiller) who offers a college basketball star (real life point guard Allan
Huston in a relatively bland performance) a bribe to throw a game. This plot
doesn't go anywhere interesting, nor does it cohere with the rest of the film,
but Toback has found something interesting in Stiller's character, who isn't
much unlike the James Caan character (Toback's stand in, I'm convinced) in THE
GAMBLER. He's an ex-con (referred to by others in the film as "the gambler")
searching (not too swiftly) for some sort of redemption. The character is so
interesting on his own that I would like to see him get his own movie. Ditto
for Downy and (trust me this was a big surprise) Claudia Schiffer. Though her
character is a typically beautiful, cunning, female fatale (whose motives still
remain unclear to me) Schiffer plays her with such a cold, detached ideation
that she transcends the Sharon Stone-esque similarities and becomes a rather
potent and chilling force. Her final bit (during the end credits) gave me
chills because of there not-so-subtle ramifications. Unfortunately Toback gives
the majority of screen time to the stoical, emotionless Power whose cold stare
never hints at anything beyond coldness.
I know I've given the film a harsh review, but I still applaud Toback for the
effort. He's a true renegade, and it's quite extraordinary that he got such an
eclectic cast to perform with such intemperance. He gets these stars to do
things we've never seen them do and with a terrifically reckless abandon. He's
also exploring the American culture with a kind of film that, at least on the
surface, resembles the inventive cinema of the early 70's. Currently, we
occasionally get Oliver Stone's bombastic ramblings on American institutions,
but those are pandering at best. Even the majority of independent films shy
away from cultural examination, opting instead for gleeful family dysfunction
and cool detached white gangsters. (Though to be fair within the last year
we've seen several films attempting to get back to this). Toback is
unsuccessful, but he clearly had a vision and while he might not have tapped
the pulse of the zeitgeist, he at least hit the wrist, which is something, I
guess. It was reported that Toback ended up with four hours of possible footage
to cut down. I'm willing to bet that there is a truly brilliant film in there
somewhere. Instead Toback fished out a mediocre one.

Review for Boiler Room (2000)
Starring: Giovanni Ribisi, Nicky Katt, Vin Diesel, Nia Long, Ron Rifkin, Ben
Affleck, Scott Caan, Tom Everett Scott, Jamie Kennedy
In 1987 the stock market crashed, and Oliver Stone's WALL STREET was released
to critical acclaim and packed movie houses. WALL STREET lucked out in its
timing; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had, and
though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated, that very
ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential Reagan-era
businessman. Stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs. evil tale
relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange. Critics and
audiences lauded WALL STREET, elevating its status to that of a contemporary
classic. I'm proud to say that I will never be counted as one of them. I found
WALL STREET to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of Stone's
output with its thin caricatures, obvious sentiments, and a charisma barren
performance by the young Charlie Sheen. Stone goes for broke in every scene
(the same could be said for nearly all of his works). This approach tends to
bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions. He directs stock
exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as
if they were in a plummeting airplane. It's all an excuse for Stone to ratchet
up the emotion with false intensity, rather than explore what these situations
are really like. I have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically
manipulative (as they are presented in BOILER ROOM) rather than laughably over
the top. These guys are salesmen after all, not televised judges.
More than anything I am baffled by why so many adore WALL STREET. The only
possible solution I can muster is its release date. And not just the timeliness
of the "Greed is Good" subject matter: The film was plumped down in the
eighties, a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form, and a
group of glamorous Brat Packers smirked their way through inane high concept,
low result movies. In my mind, the eighties will forever be remembered as a
decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies, but bad music, bad hair,
and bad clothes. Maybe Stone's After School Special set in Wall Street was
viewed as a welcome change of pace.
BOILER ROOM is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to Stone's
piece of crap. They both feature a consequential father-son relationship,
though BOILER ROOM'S is much more subtle and touching. And they are both
concerned with the power of greed, yet the men in BOILER ROOM are akin to
poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth, heartless
Gordon Gecko figures of WALL STREET. BOILER ROOM is a message movie as well,
though (at least until the end) doesn't shove it in our faces.
BOILER ROOM is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will
go for that cash. As I said, this film is indeed timely in a society where WHO
WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE is the number one prime time show every day (bringing
about a revolution of prime time TV watching that hasn't been seen in quite a
while); not only do we want to be millionaires, we want to watch other people
become millionaires! In our super-judgmental, power-oriented culture the desire
for money supersedes everything; when you have money, you have it "all".
And Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) wants it "all" the easy way. He's a well-intentioned
college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage
firm (the kind that sells junk stock) whereupon he meets others just like him.
Ben Affleck is cast as Jim, the company headhunter, who struts in commanding
the room like a frat boy Gordon Gecko. His job is to influence trainee's into
becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their
man hood. It's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of B.S that
they're told to dish out to prospective buyers. Affleck's character is
obviously supposed to recall Alec Baldwin's similar character in GLENGARY GLEN
ROSS, and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance. Affleck shouts,
curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like Baldwin, minus the edge.
When Alec played the scene he became the part, spewing those brutal lines as if
they were his own. By comparison Affleck simply looks as if he were doing a
really hammy line reading.
The brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks: They storm
to work like football players on the way to the big game. Rap music thumps on
the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are:
intellectual gangsters. They aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood
especially during leisure time where the lumbering Scott Caan seems all too
eager to use his fists in minor disputes. We drink up this world along with
Seth, and watch him become seduced by it, just like we might be.
As in all cautionary tales, BOILER ROOM begins with seducing us into its
illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing, then smacks us with the
consequences of all the recklessness. I know this story. We all do. But it can
work if it's told with intelligence and energy, and that is how writer\director
Ben Younger tells it. As a director of (please excuse my French) mise-en-scene
Younger has much to learn. His style is sitcom bland. But his writing isn't.
Younger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch; his dialogue
is like a junior David Mamet.
Despite the moderate camera work Younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with
tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script. The
brokers\hucksters counter every customer objection, gently bullying them into
buying stock. These moments are filmed like psychological action scenes: a
tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he
is one.
With the exception of Affleck's brief appearances, the performances are truly
exceptional. Ribisi, who has the edgy looks of a character actor, is extremely
potent here, working his pale angular face, and eerie, plaintive stare for all
their worth. He conveys child-like vulnerability (his character seems to hide
in a corner whenever things aren't going his way) in some scenes, and in others
he's ferociously cut throat. The Jekyll and Hyde contradiction works well in
the movie: Ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone, but cowardly
in front of authority figures including his abrasive father (authoritatively
played by Ron Rifkin).
BOILER ROOM thankfully avoids WALL STREET-like histrionics in the sales-pitch
sequences; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological
ploys. Those ploys are taught to Seth by Chris (Vin Diesel), a kind broker who
alternates between Seth's friend and his mentor. Diesl shines in his minor
role. This week I saw the sci-fi opus PITCH BLACK in which Diesel plays a
completely different role in an equally effective manner. In that film he has
the kind of role that might have gone to Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 80's, and
in BOILER ROOM he has the kind of role that might have gone to Elliot Gould in
the 70's. Nicky Katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what
he can't have.
Nia Long, as the firm's secretary, (a lone black women amongst many white men)
is Ribisi's love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant
as most of the parts this talented actress gets, but develops into something
more interesting. The two make an oddly likeable couple. Long is smart and
brash, and Ribisi is charmingly aloof. At one point he says to her "I'm just
lookin' for some chocolate love". It's a terrible line but Ribisi delivers it
in such an innocuous child-like way, it becomes sweetly endearing.
Unfortunately, towards the end, the BOILER ROOM turns a tad schmaltzy. There is
much crying, hugging, and sorrowful stares. This is okay when taken in small
doses, but Younger's conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo
moments, one following the other. A particular misstep is his attempt to show
the effect that Seth's manipulations have on one of his poor victims. It's not
a bad idea but the execution is lacking, with those scenes feeling tacked on to
further spell out the message. That message being, "Greed is Bad". Yes it's
patently obvious, but BOILER ROOM conveys it by introducing us to a culture
that I haven't seen much of in the movies: The disenfranchised twenty something
entrepreneur. And all WALL STREET did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy
world of saints and sinners. BOILER ROOM offers neither extreme. It gives us
what is in between, and for that I am thankful.

Review for Dogma (1999)
DOGMA (1999)
Grade: C
Director: Kevin Smith
Screenplay: Kevin Smith
Starring: Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Jason Mewes, Chris Rock,
Salma Hayek, George Carlin, Jason Lee, Alan Rickman, Kevin Smith, Alanis
Morissette, Janeane Garofalo
 
"You know, pregnant women can have sex up until their third trimester," one of
the holy prophets so eloquently points out just as this bloated flick ambles to
its bloated finale. The prophet is played by perennial Kevin Smith stoner,
Jason Mewes, who utters all his dialogue in witless colloquialisms. Mewes
reminds me of the members of Howard Stern's Wack Pack: The radio host regularly
invites individuals with peculiar speech impediments to invoke scripted lines
on his show. Their is the stutterer who harasses celebrities with queries like,
"A-a-a-are you s-s-still in sh-showbizness?", the Woody Allen soundalike made
to say...well you can imagine. Mewes is a comparative performer, a one-noter
who delivers all his lines (no matter what they are) in a similarly loopy,
zonked out, phonation.
Admittedly, I did laugh at Mewes' stoned-beyond repair schtick in Smith's
earlier works, but this act has not aged well. Must this dimwit be in every
Kevin Smith movie? To call him one-dimensional would be rather complimentary.
Smith's insistence on sticking with the character smacks of insecurity with his
new material. That being DOGMA, a religious comic fantasy, in which Smith
sprinkles his philosophies regarding organized religion and Catholicism amid a
flurry of dick jokes.
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck play two fallen angels, whom we first encounter in
an airport discussing a loophole in Catholic Dogma that could possibly get them
back into heaven. Damon and Affleck both posses an affable charm that suites
the blandly attractive stars well. They play their roles like a couple of frat
boys presuming to emulate religious entities.
British thespian Alan Rickman is a good angel on a mission to obstruct the evil
frat boy angels, who will unknowingly negate our existence if they succeed in
their plan. He approaches a lapsed catholic, abortion clinic employee (sorry
for being so verbose, I just couldn't resist putting the words "abortion" and
"catholic" in the same description), Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) to aid him in
the crusade. Bethany's character is later related more relevantly, but I won't
give that away. She sets out on an adventure with two "prophets" (Jay and
Silent Bob), and a black apostle, Rufas (Chris Rock), who falls out of the sky
bare-ass naked.
As Smith uses his story to jump back and forth between both predicaments, he
manipulates his characters as vessels in which to voice his own (presumably)
religious ideologies. Whenever this occurs (and it does frequently) the flick
falls into preachy didacticism; the proceedings are halted for Professor Smith
to give us a little lesson.
We do get some of Smith's trademark raucous humor, but delivered without the
panache that is desperately needed. Smith knows that comedy is about
unexpectedly juxtaposing incongruities, unfortunately, here, he doesn't seem to
realize that timing is equally important.
Also problematic is his severely dull directing "style". The director has yet
to become aware of film as a visual medium. Nor is he conscious of how to
properly position his actors in front of the camera. The frame is constantly
cluttered, as if everyone had fallen into place. Smith has never been a great
director, but this was less than noticeable in low budget movies about impudent
clerks or slackers passing the time in a mall.
With DOGMA, Smith has switched genres. He's making an adventure. One that is
without action or movement, a stagnant talkfest with lessons! This wouldn't be
so bad if he were able to elicit more laughs from his cast. Oddly enough, most
of the actors seem rushed, and unsure of the material they are proclaiming.
Rickman speaks so rapidly we miss many of his punch lines. Mewes doesn't seem
to be aware of where his punch lines are. It's as if everyone were in a hurry
to get to the conclusion. Though that's doubtful; the conclusion is easily
DOGMA's weakest, most incoherent sequence.
Damon and Affleck give the most seasoned performances, at least early on. Damon
plays the more pugnacious of the two, an angel of death who gets off on taking
out his wrath on the not so innocent. Affleck plays good angel to Damon's bad
angel. Constantly fretting over Damon's irate jabbering, Affleck's hang dog mug
and Caesar hair cut conjures up that of an emasculated puppy. Watching the two
riff off each other is the movies prime regalement. I kept envisioning a much
better DOGMA, one that focused solely on these rascally fellows.
Suddenly, without warning their dynamic is incongruously switched. Following an
embarrassingly staged brawl aboard a train, Affleck's character is altered from
puppy dog to bull dog. He has an epiphany, turns certifiable and regenerates as
his own angel of death. The switch is completely out of character, and
pointless; there is no pay off.
As for the other actors, never have I seen such a talented group do more
execrable work. The usually deft, husky voiced Fiorentino is laughably miscast;
like Demi Moore in STRIPTEASE, she doesn't seem to be aware that she's acting
in a comedy.
Chris Rock is adept at handling the one liners (when asked if he knew Jesus,
Rock delivers the best line; "Knew him? Nigger owes me $12 bucks!"), but unable
to inject anything in the corny You-can-do-it speeches he ladles on Bethany.
Jason Lee, another Smith regular, overacts his demonic role, aggrandizing each
line. He's like a child, playing demon, but never becoming the malevolent
figure he's ostensibly aiming for.
Other appearances include Salma Hayek (as a stripper who never strips yet
somehow manages to pull in large quantities of dough), comedian George Carlin
(as a gravel voiced priest), a mute Alanis Morisette, and Janeane Garafolo in a
cameo too tiny to even comment on.
The disjointed performances puzzled me more than anything. Where these talented
thesps so mis-directed as to act as if they were appearing in a lousy high
school play, not a major motion picture?
I like Smith's other films. I even believe his much-maligned MALLRATS has some
merits, but his talents are beginning to seem increasingly limited. The
slacker\stoner whimsy that imbued the Jersey Trilogy (CLERKS, MALLRATS, CHASING
AMY), with contemporary mid-90's immaturity (albeit wily immaturity) has grown
tiresome.
And I didn't even mention the shit monster. . .

Review for Space Cowboys (2000)
Screenplay: Ken Kaufman, Howard Klausner
Starring: Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, James Garner, 
James Cromwell, William Devane, Marcia Gay Harden, Loren Dean, Courtney B. 
Vance
SPACE COWBOYS is a middle age fantasy. It's the kind of film where the old 
guys get all the best lines while the young guys take it with sheepish grins 
or straight faced anger, and the audience laughs and cheers "You tell em, 
Clint!" Critics have taken to calling it GRUMPY OLD ASTRONAUTS, which it sort 
of is for its first two acts, then, once these grumps get into outer space we 
get a slowed down to pace maker speed ARMAGEDDON where everything goes wrong 
and one of the boys must sacrifice his life (it'll be increasingly obvious 
who'll do so by the forty five minute mark) to make things right. The final 
shot is as haunting as it is implausible as it is completely out of sync with 
everything that came before it.
Surprisingly, SPACE COWBOYS contains more self deprecating humor than you'd 
expect from a movie directed by Eastwood and featuring such "manly" men as 
Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, and James Garner, who grin and grimace amid a 
flurry of false teeth jokes, losing eye sight jokes, everybody I used to know 
is dead jokes, out of shape jokesâŚthese guys are truly too old for this shit. 
Much of the movie has the screenwriters devising one humiliating, torturous 
physical test after another; the senior citizens grunt and wheeze through 
eight mile jogs, they barely survive a bench press session, and at one point 
they're made to stand, sans trousers, in all their saggy assed glory before a 
young chick doctor. And by the way, if my ass looks half as good as 
Eastwood's when I'm seventy I'll surely die a happy man. But 
please, oh please don't give me Sutherland's ass.
The film commences with an old stand-by; a group of friends, none of whom 
have seen each other since their collective hey day, reunite to do another 
job on the ask of their unofficial leader Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood, so 
damn grizzled I practically expected him to growl when he first appears). 
Corvin, in his prime, was a hot shot NASA rocket scientist (!) who designed a 
Cod War-era satellite that, today, is on its way to crashing out of orbit. 
It's such an antiquated piece of machinery that none of the "dim bulbs" 
currently counting the days to retirement at NASA have the foggiest notion on 
how to fix it. Corvin is asked to provide the information needed to repair 
the gizmo but he stubbornly refuses, countering with the suggestion that NASA 
fly him and his old crew up into space. Well, it at least makes more sense 
then beaming up a bunch of psychotic oil drillers.
This leads to the traditionally wacky encounters wherein the hero finds his 
old friends in unexpected positions, like the craggy James Garner as a 
bargain basement Baptist priest, a pony tailed Donald Sutherland as the guy 
who tests roller coasters for speed, and Tommy Lee Jones (bull necked as 
ever) as a nutty prop plane pilot. Following the intros, all the 
aforementioned grunting and wheezing commences, punctuated by wisecracks and 
shouting matches between Eastwood and the mission leader played by James 
Cromwell (LA. CONFIDENTIAL) who acts so downright despicable he might as well 
have a British accent.
Clint seems to have paid a bit of mind to some of the criticisms hoisted upon 
many of his films, particularly how he often seems to cast community college 
graduates as his love interests. Here he casts an older lady (Barbara 
Babcock) as his wife (though she isn't given much screen time), Tommy Lee 
Jones romances the mature NASA lieutenant Sara Holland (Marcia Gay Harden), 
rather than her daughter, it's only Donald Sutherland who chases young girls, 
though he's playing the part of comic lecher. Eastwood also seems more game 
than ever to goof on his tough guy image, though not so much as to have him 
be any less than a superhero who succeeds in spite of all odds.
In many ways SPACE COWBOYS is like a less mature, vaudeville companion to 
Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN, the most brilliant film Clint ever lucked into. That 
was more a middle age nightmare about men past their prime, coming to grips 
or in some cases embracing old haunts. SPACE COWBOYS is about goofing on 
clueless youngsters, and acting even more heroic than they when it comes down 
to it. Much of the movie coasts on the chemistry of its quartet; these guys 
are legends and it's tough not to derive some pleasure from seeing them send 
up their cut in stone images. But still, when I go to a movie I tend to look 
for more than a plethora of old timer gags
I can't say that I thoroughly enjoyed it but, nonetheless, I had a pretty 
good time at the showing. This is an amiable crowd pleaser that will probably 
appeal to youngsters dreaming of space travel as well as those middle aged 
men hoping to see Eastwood quit that whining he did through THE BRIDGES OF 
MADISON COUNTY, drop the negative character traits of his dogged reporter in 
TRUE CRIME, and just return to the figure of ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN and 
HONKYTONK MAN; the tough straight man with a hint of comic wile.
SPACE COWBOYS is the last film in who knows how long that will sit privy to 
the sounds of middle aged laughter. And that's something that shouldn't be 
discounted when for the last two years film makers seemed to be trying to 
make stars out of the collective casts of the WB. These guys are like vintage 
wines, and while I didn't grow up idolizing them (I was born in '79, and it 
did take me a while to warm up to Eastwood's particular brand of wooden 
minimalism) I can certainly admire their ripened talents. The movie itself is 
more of a crusty homage to the old stars' personalities with silly space 
machinations thrown in. I didn't really care for that. I would have liked to 
see them at the service of an actual story. But many won't mind either way 
and if you're a long time fan you'll likely lap this one up.

Review for Jesus' Son (1999)
Screenplay: Elizabeth Cuthrell, David Urrutia, Oren Moverman
Starring: Billy Crudup, Samantha Morton, Denis Leary, Jack Black, Holly 
Hunter, Dennis Hopper, Greg Germann, Will Patton, Mark Webber, Michael Shannon
As the month of June closes I can't help but look back on all the shitty, 
joyless, but damn expensive Summer flicks I've endured; the kinetic 
showboating of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2, the empty headed Toyota commercial 
visuals of GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, the boring platitudes coupled with jerky 
action and BRAVEHEART's plot in GLADIATOR, the non-stop gross out desperation 
of ROAD TRIP, and the Saturday Morning Cartoon drawings of TITAN A.E. They 
all looked fantastic and seemed to hold a wealth of possible treasures, you 
know, the Saturday Matinee thrill of adventure with maybe some good 
characterization thrown in, but no, they pandered and failed to even elicit 
the cheesy thrills of past summer crapola like DEEP BLUE SEA or THE 
FRIGHTENERS.
So I return, my childlike hopes squashed, to the ol' reliable art house. I 
don my spectacles, attempt to procure a three-day growth of beard and I 
enter, tail naturally between those legs of mine, one of my old theatre 
haunts. Pleasant memories waft my way-- the friendly security guard babbling 
about Fellini films, the male ticket ripper with the eye-liner and the 
RESERVOIR DOS T-shirt, ahhh yes a world as full of magical incongruities as a 
Fellini film. You see in the early to mid nineties the art houses have been 
my refuge from the Hollywood crap that pollutes cities across this fair 
nation. I remember the hipster urgency of RESERVOIR DOGS, the sad\funny paces 
of TREES LOUNGE, the love of life found in BIG NIGHT, but that was long ago. 
I've been disappointed by these as well; most recently my trips to the art 
houses have been less fruitful; PECKER was John Waters homogenized (and he 
was the one doing the homogenizing, no lose), THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE 
was a choir to sit through, DESERT BLUE felt like a lame WB special complete 
with Kevin Williamson style quirks, and on. Most indie films are now just as 
manufactured as the 
mainstream ones.
Those "fringe" movies have spawned into their own little market full of 
flicks with their own brand of high concepts; the casual drug use, coolly 
unshaven men with tussled hair pontificating like philosophy scholars, hip 
white boys who use the "n" word like it's the ultimate badge of rebel cool, 
and the requisite Janeane Garafalo appearance. It's become just as tough to 
make a personal statement in that kind of arena so now previous indie film 
makers like Todd Solonz, David O Russell and Neil La Blute have migrated to 
major film, which is a good thing. It's about time for a shift.
JESUS' SON is chock full of the elements of indie films I've grown to loathe. 
It has the grungy-chic hand held photography, the medium close-ups of junkies 
shooting up, the quirky supporting characters, and it's a bit of an episodic, 
shambling mess vacillating wildly from one tone to another. But it has a 
certain lackadaisical charm, a bit of free wheeling gusto that those mapped 
out, formulaic big budget summer movies lack. Its actors and screenplay 
overcome the occasional handicaps, and maybe I would have given it an even 
higher grade had I not been so put off by its essential ingredients. (One can 
only sit through so many hiply off center philosophical junkie flicksâŚ). But 
it coasts on a sort of sedated charm that leaked through the screen and 
gently tap-danced on me. I felt like I was viewing something genuine, 
something with a distinct feel and voice and even some insight into its low 
lifes. This movie is at least alive while, nowadays, most indies come at us 
DOA.
Billy Crudup stars as Fuck Head (a nickname that stuck after he seemed to go 
out of his way to keep it) a passive drifter who lets life carry him 
wherever. He's a follower who stumbles into the junkie lifestyle after 
developing a dysfunctional relationship with a Michelle (Samantha Morton), a 
petulant junkie. He's a bit of a flaky idiot but a damn likeable one the way 
Crudup plays him. The actor gives FH a sort of off kilter John Cusack on 
smack vibe (the character could be the directionless Lloyd Dobler of SAY 
ANYTHING after being dumped by the Ione Skye character). He's charming in an 
enigmatic way with mannerisms that seem ever so slightly off. Crudup's an 
attractive actor (like a cross between Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise at their 
scruffiest) and for him to play this kind of loser with the same lived in 
baggage he gave heartthrob track star Prefontaine in WITHOUT LIMITS (the 
better of the two bio-pics of "the James Dean of track") marks him as not 
only a major talent but a very capable leading man just waiting to hit the 
mainstream.
FH wanders through several low down adventures, most unrelated, with a 
narrative that could kindly be called non-existent. The film is like a series 
of SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL shorts strung together, all featuring the same 
character and his progressions (or digressions). Each short has a guest star 
who most likely won't be seen in the next one. Dennis Leary, for once 
abandoning his rat-tat-tat delivery for subtle characterization, is one of 
those appearing briefly as a stoic drunk who tears apart his old home in 
order to sell the copper for money. Jack Black (HIGH FIDELITY) appears in the 
film's most amusing "short", as a hospital orderly who acts like a kid in a 
candy store. He has what may be the funniest scene I've seen all year; a bit 
involving mind-altering drugs, and incompetent staff and an impaled patient 
is like Preston Sturges meets Tarantino and all that implies. Dennis Hopper 
is sharper than usual as a craggy old drunk who got shot twice, by his two 
different wives and Holly Hunter acts exactly like Holly Hunter.
Samantha Morton (SWEET AND LOWDOWN, in which she was nominated for an Academy 
Award) appears in several of the shorts as the woman who loves and 
manipulates Fuck Head. Her child-like sweetness is matched with a world-weary 
quality that seems to be taking over. Their relationship is a passive 
aggressive one with the Morton character largely in control.
JESUS SON may be annoying to some for it's a film that's all ebb and flow, 
excitement and boredom. The film doesn't really end so much as run out gas 
which I suppose is appropriate considering the character's journey; if it had 
ended differently with some overly dramatic conclusion I'd probably be 
bemoaning it, though it seems that JESUS' SON overstays its welcome just a 
bit with its last twenty minutes seeming largely redundant, sort of like how 
it might be to watch Benjamin and Elaine from THE GRADUATE after they realize 
how wrong they are for each other (that had to be a real long bus ride) and 
begin getting on each other's nerves, eventually splitting up and returning 
to their old lives.
JESUS SON isn't a great film but in a time where indies seem to be dying a 
slow boring death, it's an appropriate return to what independent film should 
be doing. And after a month of wadding through high concept Hollywood crap 
it's just what I needed to get excited about the movies again.

Title
Review for Shanghai Noon (2000)
Screenplay: Alfred Gough, Miles Mallar
Starring: Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Lui, Brandon Merrill, Xander 
Berkely, Roger Yuan, Rafael Baaz, Ron Guang Yu, Russel Badger
In SHANGHAI NOON Jackie Chan, once again, is given the opportunity to beat 
villains with various bits of scenery while Owen Wilson is given his first 
chance to truly shine in a major film. By now Chan has become something of a 
cultural icon, and unlike many flash in the pan symbols (Mr. T, The Brat 
Pack, The Backstreet Boys…well, one can hope, can't he?) he has endured. His 
Bruce Lee by way of Buster Keaton schtick not only hasn't atrophied, it's 
gaining popularity with each new AMERICAN film he puts out. And yet the guy 
can still pull the proper punches and perform more than the necessary stunts 
with a crazed kamikaze glee that he's retained since his start in 70's Hong 
Kong pics. Less established is Wilson, who by now is a veteran of third 
banana comic relief roles in noisy, empty-headed blockbusters like ARMAGEDDON 
(where he was one of the first to die though, because of Michael Bay's 
severely haphazard direction, I hadn't noticed that he had died until the 
credit crawl when I was able to decipher that the fellow was MIA for half the 
picture hence he must have been killed, unless Bay simply lost track of him) 
and ANACONDA (a film in which he became snake chow within the first thirty 
minutes…not as bad a fate as poor Eric Stoltz who had to spend that film's 
entire duration in a coma…sadly his career has yet to come out of one), but 
began his career co-writing idiosyncratic gems like BOTTLE ROCKET (in which 
he also starred) and RUSHMORE with college buddy Wes Anderson. Here he could 
be playing an ancient ancestor of his BOTTLE ROCKET character, a wannabe bad 
ass with shades of ironical California surfer dude. 
When we're first introduced to Wilson his character is stalling in the midst 
of a train stick up he helped orchestrate, in order to flirt with a hot 
chick; "Is this your first robbery," he coos. With his sun-bleached hair and 
oddball, corn-fed Zen cadence Wilson gives off a self effacing Harrison Ford 
vibe…it's like he's winking at the audience as if to say "not to worry, when 
I'm on screen we're gonna have fun". And we do. Unfortunately the film's 
talented duo is made to twaddle about in a threadbare Saturday Morning 
Cartoon plot with a script that mistakes ingenuous puns for wit.
Placing these wildly disparate performers together in a Western buddy flick 
is surely inspired (certainly more inspired than the pairing of Wilson's much 
less charismatic brother, Luke, with Big Momma himself, Martin Lawrence in 
BLUE STREAK). Yet they never come together to ignite the chemistry of Gibson 
and Glover in LETHAL WEAPON or even Stiller and Norton in KEEPING THE FAITH. 
With the exception of one very amusing bit (a Chinese drinking game that the 
two play while sharing a bubble bath; a scene that belongs in a much funnier 
movie), they seem too enamored of their own considerable talents to ever 
create any palpable comic tension.
Stars as energetic as these can certainly make bad movies more tolerable 
(depending on how much screen time is allotted to their improvisations… 
sometimes this can turn out badly as well…just check out MYSTERY MEN if you 
doubt me), but they can rarely turn them into bonafide good movies. It has 
happened but such an occurrence is as rare as Steak Tar Tar. The original 
BEVERLY HILLS COP was a formula thriller given hints of social satire solely 
because of Eddie Murphy's inspired clowning, but what of THE GOLDEN CHILD or 
BEST DEFENSE, turgid feature length skits that sunk despite Murphy's 
charisma. His presence may have made those films less torturous, but it also 
served to italicize how good those flicks could have been had the material 
been up to par. As a result, most films like these feel bizarrely uneven. 
Example: Chris Tucker's fast paced performance in the very slow paced MONEY 
TALKS.
SHANGHAI NOON surely would have been much worse without Chan and Wilson, both 
of whom seem to be improvising through much of the been there\done that story 
line which, here, is a good thing. Whenever the film focuses on Chan and 
Wilson playing off their surroundings, and sometimes each other, it works. 
But it all comes back to the plot and the boring paces each character is put 
through. For every inspired bit we get three uninspired formula moments 
designed to push the creaky plot forward: the initial dislike between 
characters who will inevitably love each other in a very heterosexual way of 
course, the bonding, the mistrust, and so on.
It's not a bad idea to put Chan in a Western and have whites mistake him for 
an Indian (or on one occasion, a Jew,) but the possibilities of an Asian in 
the Old West are never explored other than at a juvenile pun level (which I 
suppose is fine if you happen to be ten years old). In the film, Chan plays a 
Chinese imperial guard who travels to America with fellow guards (all quickly 
dispatched) in order to rescue Princess Pei-Pei (see what I mean?). He 
stumbles across Roy O' Bannon (Owen Wilson), a good-natured thief in the 
middle of performing a train robbery that goes awry when Roy's buddies turn 
against him. Chan and O' Bannon don't like each other but since fate keeps 
tossing them together, they ultimately choose to partner up and save the 
princess. Many pee-pee jokes ensue.
The majority of Jackie Chan's foreign imports (most of his films) may be 
lacking in the script area, but they do however provide some breathtaking 
action sequences. So far, Chan's American endeavors have not. In RUSH HOUR, 
another dopey buddy movie nearly saved by the pairing of Chris Tucker and 
Jackie Chan, director Brett Ratner hardly used Chan's physical strengths at 
all, and when he did, the action was shot lethargically; Chan was adequate 
but he was essentially asked to perform the same kind of stunts Steven Seagal 
used to do back in the days when he was able to lift his leg. Why hire Chan 
if you're gonna treat like Van Damme or some other action star who can't 
really fight? Dey makes better use of him, though he doesn't seem to know how 
to film him. Dey keeps his camera up close on Chan while the actor performs 
his gonzo stunts, making it more difficult to see exactly what the hell he's 
doing. In Chan's Hong Kong films the directors knew to pull back and let Chan 
do his thing. In America, this terrific performer has yet to be fully taken 
advantage of.
Note: I present to all those loyal readers out there (yes, all three of you) 
an exclusive thought that came to fruition within my cluttered noggin 
approximately seven minutes following the writing of this review: As I 
scanned through my nitpicky write up I realized that maybe I've been a wee 
bit harsh on what is basically a piece of cornball escapism that I probably 
would have cherished in my pre-teen years. It may be unfortunate that since 
then I have become much more jaded and harder to please. Which is to say if 
you are a child (or one at heart, to borrow the cliché…trust me I'm returning 
it right this second) you'll most likely really dig this hodgepodge of corny 
sh…jeez there I go again. But if you happen to be an elitist film snob like 
myself, the kind who prefers THE FRENCH CONNECTION to LETHAL WEAPON 2, well, 
than you know the drill.

Title
Review for Urban Legend (1998)
Starring: Jared Leto, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, Robert
Englund, Tara Reid, Michael Rosenbaum, Brad Dourif, Natasha Gregson Wagner
The great actor James Woods once said (and I'm paraphrasing), "If sex isn't
messy, then you're not doing it right". A truly profound statement, and one
that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre (just replace "sex" with
"your mad slasher film"). For those uninformed souls, the mad slasher genre (or
sub-genre) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service
of a plot that follows an identical outline: a usually masked but always crazed
killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la HALLOWEEN.
URBAN LEGEND is a mad slasher flick, but one that is so sanitary, bloodless,
and nudity free, that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful (though not
overly talented) cast, it more closely resembles an overlong WB television
special. For film makers, gore is one of the two weapons they have at their
disposal in a stale, fright-free horror movie, as Stephen King once said (again
paraphrasing) "If you can't scare your audience, gross em' out, if you can't do
that, make em' laugh". Alas, URBAN LEGEND succeeds only at the latter, though
not by intention. I actually find the fact that this film became a minor
success ($40 million domestic box office gross) more frightening than anything
in it. It seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree
that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt. The
promotion for URBAN LEGEND sure promised thrills, but how can anyone with a
three digit IQ argue that it provides them. Unfortunately, these kinds of
flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations;
one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized
audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise
a good time without the added pressure of delivering. If anyone disagrees I
would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like BATMAN AND
ROBIN, WILD WILD WEST, and GODZILLA.
But forget all that, it goes without saying that Mad Slasher films (or any
other exploitation off-shoot) will be made without an ounce of craft
(especially considering the sheer volume that are produced). Allow me to
present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film: the lack of
enthusiastic exploitation. These flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty
aspirations, so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time?
Sadly out of the literally hundreds made, I would estimate that maybe three are
at all worth while. And URBAN LEGEND would certainly not be included amongst
those three. Despite its considerable production value and the absence of any
boom mics slipping into frame, it is just as awful as any no budget entry in
the slasher sweepstakes.
As far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation URBAN LEGEND's
setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities: It takes place on a
college campus, which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed
killer. You see, the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young
people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the
surface. All those young people are growing up together, going through all
kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows, so naturally some weirdness is
expected. All the better for that elusive crazed killer. Coupled with the
copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around, and the introduction of
a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task.
But alas, URBAN LEGEND is not only idiotic and clichĂŠ full; it's way too
clean, a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity, little gore, and
much stupidity. This is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims
from the scene of the crime for no reason other than, I dunno, exercise. It's
the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey,
yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing
techniques. It's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as
a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack. I really wish filmmakers would
just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing. Yes the audience jumps,
momentarily frightened, but wouldn't anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly
infiltrated a quiet room.
I lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in URBAN LEGEND about
ten minutes in when I caught a glimpse of the killer. Apparently filmmakers are
running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers. In SCREAM it was a
ghost mask (scary enough), in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER it was a fisher
man's rain slicker (in the middle of summer no less), and in URBAN LEGEND the
disguise sinks to the level of Mel Brooks parody: the villain wears an
oversized parka with a fury hood (oohâŚscary) intended to conceal his/her
identity. For URBAN LEGEND 2 I humbly suggest a Donald Duck costume.
Though I must admit, URBAN LEGEND does have a winning premise for what could
have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film. The film's killer slices
and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends (you
know, like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that
they're coming from inside the house). I won't spoil the surprise as to what
urban legends are used, after all the film does offer fine 2:00 am cable
viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough. Sad to say, it doesn't include
my favorite urban legend: A fairly graphic antidote concerning Richard Gere and
a very unhappy gerbil. Now that would be scary.
Before I leave you, I would like to bring to your attention the third most
irritating thing about the film (the first being the lack of craft, the second
the lack of exploitation)-- its characters, all of whom are just about the most
annoying group of people I've ever spent an evening with. Only Jared Leto
(looking like a carbon copy of Rob Lowe from back in the day) and Alicia Witt,
as the resilient heroine, avoid vexatiousness. The most annoying of the bunch
is a tie between Noxima girl Rebecca Gayheart and sitcom star Michael
Rosenbaum, as a supremely irritating lout (so irritating I actually cheered his
painful death, and I am not a cruel person). Ironically those aggravating sacks
of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film; if viewed as a
vicarious fantasy URBAN LEGEND can be mildly entertaining. After all this is a
movie that features the kind of faux hipsters I can't stand getting
slaughtered, which is at least better than watching an entire film about people
I can't stand not getting slaughtered.

Review for 28 Days (2000)
Author: iysmall@aol.com (Ron Small)
Starring: Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Steve Buscemi, Reni
Santoni, Mike O' Malley, Alan Tudyk, Elizabeth Perkins, Azura Skye, Diane Ladd
I tried, I really did. I wanted to feel Sandra's pain. I wanted to be moved,
and cry with all the others flanking me in that theatre, but instead, I found
myself laughing. I laughed loud and with much derision, I'm ashamed to say. I
laughed at the obligatory death scene, the emotional talk between sisters ("I
should have helped you with your homework!"), the drunken mother flashbacks
(oh, so this how our main character ended up like this), and most of all I
laughed at the dopey ending which I won't describe for those saps who choose to
ignore my cautionary review (you know who you are). I left the theatre
un-moved, but all that laughter did me good. Maybe I was just in a weird mood.
28 DAYS is not a movie I planned to see ever, save for maybe when it would
inevitably pop up on pay cable where I catch most of the movies I never plan on
seeing (think 8MM, THE CORRUPTER, MESSAGE IN A BOTTLEâŚthink, but don't see).
It came with a trailer that made me gag, and starred Sandra Bullock who seems
utterly incapable of choosing a good script. It's directed by Betty Thomas, who
managed to make Howard Stern likeable in PRIVATE PARTS, but then again, it's
directed by Betty Thomas, the woman who turned DR.DOLITLE into a two hour potty
joke (or so I've heard, I could never actually bring myself to sit through yet
another supposed Eddie Murphy comeback). Steve Buscemi (who's been MIA ever
since he graced the otherwise execrable ARMAGEDDON) is featured prominently in
the trailer. I like him a lot. Viggo Mortensen is also in the film, though he's
advertised a bit less prominently. Mortensen may be the most talented leading
man who has yet to become a leading man. And it was written by Susannah Grant
who wrote the cheeky crowd pleaser, ERIN BROCKOVICH.
So, I didn't really want to go, but I was curious (it was this same curiosity
that got me into trouble when SHOWGIRLS frolicked into town--curiosity may have
killed that damn cat, but in my case, all it ever did was get me to pay good
money to see bad movies), and when it received glowing reviews from two critics
I regularly pay attention to (Roger Ebert and Owen Gleiberman for those
curious) I decided to push my doubts aside, and give Sandra and Betty another
chance.
I'm not really sorry that I did. I feel rather indifferent about the whole
debacle. It's an improvement over FORCES OF NATURE and HOPE FLOATS (two films I
caught on HBO, and just had to turn off because they stunk so badly), but it's
not really, you know, good. The script is like a LIFETIME weepie, which is to
say that it's well made for a made for TV flick that would air on that
particular channel. It isn't, however, well made enough to shell out seven
bucks to see. (Or more, if you happen to be unlucky enough to live in New York,
a city where not only the mosquitoes are poisonous, but the movies are eight
whopping bucks and going higher I hear).
In my review of Grant's other movie, ERIN BROCKOVICH (which she provided the
screenplay for), I noted that without the star power of Julia Roberts and the
clever Steven Soderbergh at the helm, it would be little more than a passable
TV movie. Judging from 28 DAYS, it appears as if Grant is only capable of
writing scripts for TV movies (though I certainly wouldn't mind it if she
proved me wrong one of these days), so I plead to any LIFETIME execs that may
be reading this: please hire this women! Either that or pair her up with a
director as bright as Soderbergh. Not that Betty Thomas is horrible, she just
isn't distinctive. Which is to say her films are indistinguishable from the
rest of the mainstream crap currently stinking up a multiplex near you. Which
maybe does mean she's horrible.
While this flick's noxious trailer would have you believe that it's a comedy
with hints of drama, there are very few laughs, and plenty of scenes designed
to make you ball like Haley Joe Osmet after the little pisher was denied a
Golden Globe. 28 DAYS is a very mainstream melodrama about the out of control
Gwen (perky Sandra Bullock acting as petulant as she can), an alcoholic who
shimmies into her sisters wedding drunk, then causes huge amounts of
faux-drama, all while her smarmy British boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West)
chortles about. Our bitter heroine must either go to jail or a rehab clinic.
Which would you pick? Well if you saw this clinic you might just want to be
thrown in jail. It's the kind of rehab where people sing and interact with farm
animals. It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway for the sake of
completion) that at first Gwen is very opposed to all this goofiness, then she
eventually warms up to it, and everything most likely ends happily. Trust me, I
haven't given a thing away.
The drama of alcoholism is presented with some reality, but never to the point
where we really become involved in the suffering of it all. Sure we see Bullock
scrunch up her nose in pain and all that but we never feel it, and personally I
didn't care to. Bullock has made a career out of playing sweet, airy
girly-woman, like your bestest pal in the whole world, who just happens to be
really hot. She has a freeness about her, a sunshine quality that doesn't seem
faked (as, at least for me, it does with Gwyneth Paltrow). Here she is stripped
of all that, and her characterization is adequate, but something is missing.
She doesn't seem comfortable when she drops the nice-girlness, and I admire her
for trying, but this is really a role better suited for someone like Janeane
Garofalo, who seems just as bitter as this character requires. (I felt the same
thing, only the opposite with Garofalo attempting to play sweet in THE
MATCHMAKER).
Viggo Mortension is the sometimes-love interest, a rehabee, with a penchant for
unwanted paternity suites. The actor plays the part in a laid back Mathew
McConaughey drawl, and makes the most of his nothing-role. Busemi is featured
in about three scenes the entire movie, yet he registers more than Bullock did
for me. He plays a drug counselor (ex-junkie and alcoholic) with a gentle,
quite intelligence. He looks at Bullock with sad, helpful eyes, and we get the
feeling that this guy really cares. Others present are third-tier character
actors, all equipped with their one identifiable character trait. They're an
overly wacky bunch, just the kind of rehab people you'd expect to find in a
film by the director of DR. DOLITTLE. One of those quirky souls is Andrea
(played by sitcom star Azura Skye), a morose addict whose fate seems obligatory
in a movie such as this.
Thomas directs in hand held camera mode as if to announce that she's attempting
something grittier than the average Bullock vehicle, but all that grit just
paves the way for more cheap pathos. In retrospect I realize it's mighty
telling that in Roger Ebert's review he notes: "28 Days is rated PG-13 and
might be effective as a cautionary tale for teens". In a sense, that is a lot
of what's wrong with the film, it's too damn cautionary. The movie is like an
overly moral tale that an ex-rehab clinic might tell to his grand children.
It's too damn safe. Even the grittiness eventually leads to saccharine lessons.

Review for Titan A.E. (2000)
Director: Don Bluth, Gary Goldman, Art Vitello
Screenplay: Hans Bauer, Randall McCormick, Ben Edlund, John 
August, Joss Whedon
Starring (Voices): Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman, Nathan Lane, 
Tone Loc, Jim Breuer, John Leguizamo, Janeane Garofalo, Ron Perlman, Alex D. 
Linz
TITAN A.E is like a Saturday Morning Cartoon version of STAR WARS. I didn't 
really care for it, but then I didn't like STAR WARS either. That film, for 
all its ingenious crossover marketing coups, is one helluva hollow space 
opera, a movie that managed to single handedly turn one of the most 
fascinating film genre's into bargain matinee trash all while audiences and 
critics cheered on. The effects of STAR WARS are still felt today, seen in 
lame brained space westerns of recent years like BATTLEFIELD EARTH, LOST IN 
SPACE, WING COMMANDER and SUPERNOVA. I loathe STAR WARS for what it did to 
science fiction. And TITAN A.E proudly carries on its tradition. Twenty years 
later, after the cinematic death of intelligent science fiction, TITAN A.E 
comes at us with everything that made STAR WARS crap (lame comic relief, 
horrible dialogue, non-existent characters) and its few strengths (terrific 
visuals) as well.
Don Bluth's (THE SECRET OF NIMH, AN AMERICAN TAIL) production replaces the 
typical gee-whiz Mark Hamil kid-hero with a more modern, cynical Luke 
Skywalker figure, Cale, voiced with wry Will Hunting sarcasm by Matt Damon 
whose affect rarely reveals anything beyond vague annoyance. He's as equally 
bland as Skywalker but in a wry self-aware DAWSON'S CREEK sort of way. He's 
the wiseacre hero for the late 90's\early millennium, all those "gosh, golly 
geeisms" replaced with "Whatevers".
As the film opens we meet Cale as a young mop topped child who's forced to 
flee the earth with his well-built father (who might have walked in from a GI 
JOE cartoon). It's actually quite a scene- a near classic moment as the peace 
of a barren earth is rapidly interrupted by monstrous, bug-like space ships 
blasting away at everything in sight. Cale and his father are divided, the 
mop topped one escaping in a separate ship that flys past earth just as our 
beloved planet explodes into a glitter of galvanic rock. It's exciting and a 
bit unsettling. For just a moment I was ten years old again, re-living the 
thrills of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (the only truly great film in the STAR WARS 
quartet, one that melds substance with excitement in a way the original 
didn't even attempt) and creating massive space operas of my own with GI JOE 
and TRANSFORMER action figures. This could be it, I thought. This could 
finally be that summer movie I'd been pinning for. I smiled ear to ear, laid 
back, then to my extreme dismay, some annoying Jar-Jar esque comic relief 
figures arrive, which served to immediately shake me from my state of child 
like wonder back into the state of nitpicky movie critic.
It's years after the prologue and Cale is now drawn to look like a BACKSTREET 
BOY. He's a laborer drilling away at space rocks as the camera hyperbolically 
spins to and fro while rock music blares. Yes this is one of those. Our hero 
is approached by a gruff soldier (voiced by Bill Pullman, doing his best 
Tommy Lee Jones), who informs him that the location of the TITAN, a spaceship 
that his father engineered, is etched in Cale's DNA. Cale is interested 
enough to join the captain's ship crew and aid in the search of this mythical 
craft. Aboard the ship we meet the R2D2 and C3PO stand ins; a Kangaroo like 
creature with a pig-like snout voiced with added cynicism by sarcasm 
personified, Janeane Garofalo, and a tortoise-like creature, Gune (voiced by 
John Leguizamo), who like Jar-Jar has the temerity to refer to himself in 
third person. Meanwhile Cale falls for the only other human shipmate (what, 
you got somethin' against inter species dating, Cale?), Akima (an Aeon Flux 
look-alike voiced with valley girlish apathy by Drew Barrymore), who 
immediately dislikes Cale which cues us to believe that by the end, they'll 
be smooching arm in arm.
The story is largely irrelevant, as the movie seems to spend the brunt of its 
energy on creating eye-popping visuals, nearly all of which are suitably 
enthralling. The most effective being a blood-pumping chase through the Ice 
Rings of Tigran, a locale made up entirely of large, reflective ice crystals 
that shatter with the slightest tap.
For science fiction purists (the kind who read L. Ron Hubbard like it's the 
bible or something) TITAN A.E may be a bit too unrelenting in its anime meets 
Playstation visuals set to constant Alterna rock; it's almost like an 
advanced, scripted version of those psychedelic 60's film reels that 
counterculture rebels goggled at while passing joints. The various directors' 
certainly go the distance visually; their attempts to mix 3-D computer 
animation effects with the traditional 2-D animated drawings is near-seamless.
Despite the inventive eye candy, I began to desire a bit more substance with 
my FX demo, but really, what did I expect from a cartoon? TITAN A.E is about 
on par with Don Bluth's other workmanlike animated attempts to usurp Disney. 
It has some unexpected moments like a bit wherein our heroes attempt to foil 
a big, dumb looking guard who actually turns out to be quite intelligent. But 
then it has far too many scenes like the one where Cale and Akima fix a 
gigantic run down space craft during a montage that makes it look about as 
easy as jump starting a Mustang. Or the one where the lead baddie yells to 
his minions (while in the midst of battle),"Destroy the ice shield that 
protects the Titan". Oh, that ice shield. To paraphrase former NEW YORK 
magazine film critic John Simon, "TITAN A.E will do very nicely for those 
lucky enough to be childish or unlucky enough never to have grown up". I'm 
sure Mr.Lucas is very pleased.

Review for Way of the Gun, The (2000)
Starring: Ryan Phillippe, Benicio Del Torro, James Caan, Juliette Lewis, Taye 
Diggs, Scott Wilson, Nicky Katt, Dylan Kussman, Kristen Lehman
WAY OF THE GUN is brimming with surprises, some good, most bad. One of the 
good ones is Ryan Phillippe's surprisingly halfway decent performance. After 
the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill 
like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, he hinted at a bit growth in last 
year's CRUEL INTENTIONS with his amusingly contemptuous John Malkovich meets 
James Spader performance, though his acting in that film faltered around the 
third act mark, precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart 
(presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans) and start bellyaching 
about how he'd fallen for his "target". It was a dramatic shift that neither 
Phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate. But he seems to be trying 
and that shouldn't be overlooked (or probably over praised) seeing as how, at 
this point, he really isn't required to do much but look pretty. Here, 
Phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard, his hair askew and his 
affect altered to sound something like James Cagney in all his "Look here, 
see" glory. It's tough to believe a pretty boy like Phillippe as a hard ass, 
but his performance actually helps with the illusion. Unlike Ben Affleck's 
puppy dog approach in REINDEER GAMES, Phillippe is believable and not too bad 
at that.
As for the plot, well, that's one of the bad surprises; Phillippe and the 
great Benicio Del Torro play two moronic (and not even remotely likeable) 
criminals (introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly 
pick a fight with about twenty people) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a 
surrogate mother (Juliette Lewis) after overhearing that she's carrying the 
baby of Painter (Scott Wilson), a very well connected wealthy man. The 
kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and 
many are killed. But the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit 
man (James Caan) and two scheming bodyguards (Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt) 
remain in pursuit.
Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the screenwriter who won an Oscar for his 
work on USUAL SUSPECTS, an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles 
(this one included), WAY OF THE GUN is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs 
that just oozes eye rolling familiarity. Unlike Phillipe, McQuarrie doesn't 
seem to be growing at all; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of 
plot all snatched from movies I know I've seen before and worse, it feels 
like it. The film lacks even a fresh approach (like what Soderbergh did OUT 
OF SIGHT or THE LIMEY) to its clichés, all of which are spewed before us in a 
picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to 
notice how common it is. It features characters living by a code they seemed 
to have picked up in Sam Peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life. 
Even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene 
where enemies James Caan and Benicio Del Torro stop in their tracks to have a 
cup of coffee and pontificate on life, philosophy, etc. I didn't like the bit 
much when it first appeared in HEAT, here, it's even more self consciously 
"dramatic".
USUAL SUSPECTS, which also featured a bunch of low lives that 
seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies, worked to some degree 
because of that astonishing twist ending. Nowadays an astonishing twist per 
ending is de rigeur, never mind if it deems all that transpired before it 
completely inconsequential. Thus, nearly every character in WAY comes with at 
least one dirty little secret (most amateurishly projected before they 
appear) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end (nothing earth 
shattering, like in the USUAL SUSPECTS) but I admit, I didn't see it coming, 
and I smiled. However most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation 
scenes between Palminteri and Spacey in USUAL SUSPECTS: a lot of faux huffing 
and puffing with no rhythm or reason. Or substance.
It's just as overplotted as SUSPECTS, and often dull as any overplotted movie 
without interesting characters, a distinctive style, or a good script would 
be. Even the good stuff, most of which involves James Caan (doing a fine 
job), feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like "Karma is 
only justice with out the satisfaction" are clever. At one point Caan laments 
"Need is the ultimate monkey" a line so inexplicable he might as well have 
said "love is like hippo ass". I've seen porno with better dialogue. And some 
with better plot lines too. But rarely has porn offered up such a talented 
cast (I mean, can you even compare James Caan to Ron Jeremy). Caan slips into 
this role with seeming ease, he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy 
in a coma, but he manages to give his character depth and weariness. Benicio 
Del Torro is always welcome, though here he plays it fairly straight (rather 
than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in 
USUAL SUSPECTS and EXCESS BAGGAGE), adopting a Brad Pitt-esque quizzical pout 
to go along with his heavy swaggering. Speaking of Pitt, his ex, Juliette 
Lewis, is a weak link, either shouting her lines with ear shattering 
shrillness, or waddling about like a silly goose. Nicky Katt was brilliant in 
a brief role in THE LIMEY, here his role is just as brief only he seems 
wasted; he's only kept around for his cold presence. Taye Diggs has a similar 
function, cool as ever, but never a character, though the guy has one helluva 
death scene.
For the most part WAY is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo's 
ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than 
simplistic pawns. It's vaguely Tarantino-ish, but in a bad TRUTH AND 
CONSEQUENCES NM way, with Phillippe, in one scene, leaping into a stupid rant 
about "faggots" migrating to Los Angeles. You know the routine. The final 
shoot out is pure bargain basement John Woo (who himself seems to be doing 
bargain basement John Woo) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot 
at. But those gun shots sure crack like thunder. Just the other day I was 
watching an old DIRTY HARRY movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak 
elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from Harry's fetishized Smith and 
Wesson. Oh how far we've come.

Review for Prince of the City (1981)
Screenplay: Jay Presson Allen, Sidney Lumet
Starring: Treat Williams, Jerry Orbach, Richard Foronyjy, Don Billet, Kenny 
Marino, Carmine Caridi, Anthony Page, Norman Parker, Paul Roebling, Bob 
Balaban, James Tolkan, Steve Inwood, Lindsay Crouse
Let me open this one with a confession: I love cop movies. I adore them with 
such an unwavering, near foolish passion that I was actually one of the first 
in line to see 1998's ONE TOUGH COP starring the smirkiest of the Baldwin 
brothers, Steven. Was it any good? Well, just about as good as Baldwin's 
Steven Seagal impression (for those I've confused the answer is a resounding 
NO!). Now let me clarify, I don't love just any cop movie; I'm not too keen 
on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly 
(gulp) returning thanks to Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. I'm partial to those 
gritty, earthy cop dramas like SERPICO, DONNIE BRASCO, and THE FRENCH 
CONNECTION. Problem is these films come along just about as often as George 
W. Bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "true" cop movie does hit 
multiplexes, I come running towards it like an eager puppy…and inevitably I 
leave, head bowed, tripping over my squiggly tail.
So what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to 
shell out $7.50 for a movie called ONE TOUGH COP (which actually sounds a lot 
like a WISEGUY spin-off, no?)? Truth is I'm a sucker for those barren 
streets, that gritty, graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous 
criminals lurk and cops, like modern day knights, must shield us from their 
iniquitous clutches. Yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish, which, 
I'm guessing, is precisely where these feelings come from. As little tots us 
boys are brought up to create our own wars with GI JOE'S, enact cops and 
robbers or cowboy and Indian fantasies, etc. The best gritty cop films tap 
into those gleeful adolescent fantasies, and heighten them, turning it all 
into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos. As 
an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically; sure I can get a 
cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a Krzysztof Kieslowski film, 
but I still delight at the promise a "guy" film could potentially bring.
Now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones? Ooh that one really gets 
me going, these protectors using all that at their service, taking advantage 
of others for their own gain. Throw a courtroom drama (yech!) into the pot 
and you have the tremendously absorbing Sidney Lumet film PRINCE OF THE CITY. 
How absorbing is PRINCE OF THE CITY, you ask? So damn absorbing that when the 
film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama (a sub-genre 
I loath the way Kristy Swanson must loath Sarah Michelle Gellar) I remained 
completely and utterly involved.
The film stars Treat Williams, who gives the kind of performance that should 
have skyrocketed his career up to the level that Brad Pitt currently resides 
at. Since I was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of PRINCE OF 
THE CITY, I cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't. (Though judging 
from his recent roles in tripe like DEEP RISING and DEAD HEAT I would guess 
that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves). Like 
Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts (both of whom are currently doing time in 
direct to video purgatory) Williams is a talented leading man who didn't make 
it to where he should have. (If there was any justice in this dog gone world 
Keanu Reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell). Here, the 
actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from Al Pacino's in SERPICO 
(also directed by Lumet).
Williams plays Danny Ciello, a member of an elite squad of police officers 
who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-Juliani streets of New York. 
They work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes. And that 
analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into 
using corrupt means to get the job done. The squad relies entirely on 
informants (low level junkies) to gain access to the big wigs, and in order 
to obtain the info they seek, they sometimes have to provide the junkies with 
the junk of their choice. Danny has done this, and though he's a fairly 
honorable guy, who took the job in order to do good, his intentions have 
gotten a bit skewed along the way. He seeks redemption and concludes that the 
best way to go about getting it is by talking to Internal Affairs who then 
convince him to go undercover as a "double agent". He does so with one 
condition: He will not rat on his partners. Right away we know that that is 
exactly what he'll have to do. And watching the movie build to that is 
thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be.
Undercover cop films are almost innately exciting, even the kind that pull 
out all the cliches (like IN TOO DEEP). How can one not be moved by the 
issues of betrayal, ambiguity, and the danger in putting oneself in such a 
risky position? PRINCE OF THE CITY takes all this and charges it with a 
perceptive, hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro 
Sidney Lumet, as well as a handful of intense performances, most notably by 
Treat.
Lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back, and lets the 
camera soak up the action. His scenes transition rapidly from one to the next 
building layers of tension, and he rarely holds for reaction shots, instead 
he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking. Lumet's 
worst tendency is one that many film makers (especially Oliver Stone) tend to 
overuse: He relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at 
each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension. This isn't as much 
a problem here as it was in NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN, Lumet's most recent 
cop\lawyer endeavor, a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching.
Though of late Lumet has made several really awful career choices (maybe he 
and Treat should get together for a drink or something), the most recent a 
completely unnecessary remake of GLORIA, here he was ON, sustaining tension 
in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot.
Some of the formula pictures I like the best are the most simplistic. 
Hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even 
tolerable. Of course cop movies aren't popular anymore (yes buddy cop flicks 
are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the 
punch lines), but just look at the average Hollywood action movies, flicks so 
bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves 
no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't 
gay, the lame comic relief character who's never funny, and on and on. 
For all its moral ambiguities PRINCE OF THE CITY is a back to the basics 
cop\courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills. It 
focuses completely on its story, and its characters all of whom are 
completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies.
There's a great scene early on where an irate Williams shouts at an IA 
officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny BRAVEHEART 
inspirational speeches, but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and 
begins sobbing. This is a scene that would never make it into a Michael Bay 
film (even though Bruce Willis sacrifices his life at the end of ARMAGEDDON, 
not one damn tear) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that 
makes him too human, excuse me, weak. In the very next scene Danny speaks in 
a hushed raspiness, straining to get the words out. He's lost his voice. Does 
that little itty bitty detail matter? Maybe not to most, but it sure made my 
night. And in a sprawling epic of corruption, greed, betrayal and violence 
it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things.

Review for Magnolia (1999)
Starring: John C. Reily, Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Jeremy Blackman, April
Grace, Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards, Phillip Baker
Hall, William H. Macy, Melora Walters
In MAGNOLIA, Tom Cruise struts and jives, pervading his boyish voice with the
inflection of a soulful preacher, William H. Macy babbles about his past, and
Melora Walters snorts a lot of coke. Like a Robert Altman film (McCABE AND MRS.
MILLER, SHORT CUTS), Paul Thomas Anderson's (BOOGIE NIGHTS) interests lie in
communities, and the people who co-exist within them. He leaps between
disparate narratives and characters (all with comparative issues), the audience
instinctively assuming that he will eventually bring everyone together for the
finale (as is usually the case with such a film). But Anderson has something
more complex up his sleeve. Without giving too much away, MAGNOLIA is not so
much about its characters as it is about the volatile life that surrounds them.
And it's not particularly interested in traditional plot lines, but
thematically, everything relates. The film concludes in a manner, that made me
think of the lack of supremacy we have over our lives.
As the millennium approached, various religious zealots predicted the end of
the world. These knuckleheads made the assumption that Earth would be no more
because of a passage in the bible hinting that "something" would happen
following the commencement of the millennium. Of course nothing did, and
besides we have no idea when the millennium is; date and time are man-made and
as such we're not on any schedule! (Please excuse me for being so obvious, but
trust me, this half-hearted semi-rant is going somewhere). These kind of
sentiments have much to do with man's desire to be in control of his existence
when really he's just another "spoke on the wheel", to quote one of the
characters from MAGNOLIA. We like to think that we have control over our lives,
but the sad truth is that we have very little say in the way things ultimately
pan out: a plane could crash into our house while we lay in bed, a psycho path
might gun us down in a shopping mall, an earthquake may trap us under a
building. Life is a series of moments where we often must put our trust in the
world that we inhabit.
I don't believe that most audiences will walk out of MAGNOLIA liking it as much
as I did, or getting from it what I did. Some will say that its ending is
irrational, a "cop out", but it resonated with me, and I feel as if I "get"
what Anderson was doing. However, one somewhat vocal member of the audience did
not. This man chortled loudly at the films concluding moments, obnoxiously
proclaiming "This is ridiculous!" I don't think it is. The ending coheres with
the basic theme the movie sets up in its opening, and though it is not
traditional, it does succeed.
Often when a filmmaker attempts to construct his film solely out of themes, the
end result is manipulative and pretentious. But Anderson puts just as much care
into his very human characters as he does into his "plot". His story takes
place in the "real" world, so when astonishing things happen it's just as
stupefying for the characters as it is for us. They exist in their own hectic
worlds, never privy to everything that occurs around them. But we see it all,
and what it leads up to will only make sense to some of us.
So what is this thing about? It's about our past and how it haunts us no matter
how hard we try to escape it, and it's about a redemption that for most never
comes. But we expect it to come. Maybe those who react negatively to this film
do so because they didn't know what to expect. There is nothing predictable or
formulaic about MAGNOLIA. Anderson has brazenly gone in a direction that I
think few will comprehend (judging from the plethora of puzzled faces that I
noticed, following the screening). Audiences may like being force-fed surprise
endings (even if at times they defy logic: THE USUAL SUSPECTS), but when
presented with something that is seemingly inexplicable, they would rather
dismiss the entire film than put their thinking caps on.
Anderson introduces his intentions with a prologue about chance and coincidence
that is so dazzling and free from usual film constrictions, I found myself
marveling at its propulsive cleverness. Other scenes left me with the same
breathless wonder.
The characters are introduced in a manic ten-minute montage. Jason Robards is
an aged producer, plagued with a cancer that is slowly draining the life out of
him. Julianne Moore (essentially acting out her BOOGIE NIGHTS coke frenzy scene
for the duration of this film) plays his trophy wife. Robards is looked after
by a kind, plump nurse, Phil Parama (a slack jawed Phillip Seymour Hoffman).
Tom Cruise is Robards' estranged son, a wolfish "self help guru" who instructs
horny losers, in a profane workshop on how to pick up chicks. Cruise is
constantly over the top screaming out lines like, "Respect the cock!" with such
conviction he could be a hopped up Moses relaying the TEN COMMANDMENTS to his
people. It's a brave performance, but one that doesn't always work. Cruise has
a virtuous little boy voice, and to hear him acting with such macho indignation
is a bit like watching David Schwimmer in the Andrew Dice Clay role. Though
Cruise does put his trademark grin to good use as a mask of narcissistic
endearment; he seems to be saying, "Yeah I'm an asshole, but I'm just too damn
charming".
Another character is afflicted with cancer, this one game show host, Jimmy
Gator (Phillip Baker Hall). Hall speaks in an urbane, grandfatherly pitch,
textured with wisdom and worldliness. He has a likeable demeanor, and as such
it's effectively dismaying when we discover his past indiscretions. Gator's
pug-nosed, crumpled visage seems to be slowly deteriorating in guilt. He
remains estranged from his cokehead daughter, Rose (Melora Walters). Rose is so
traumatized by events in her past, that she denies herself any kind of
emotional relationship, only engaging in purely sexual ones. This doesn't stop
a kind-hearted cop (John C. Reily) from falling for her. If anyone has the most
screen time it's Reily, and that's a good thing; the actor is adept at playing
naďve, yet admirable characters. Along with Hoffman, Reily offers glimmers of
hope amid the human wreckage permeating Anderson's tale.
The Game Show is an old fashioned Quiz show, in which child geniuses' match
wits against challenging adults. The current child star is Stanley Spector (an
emerald eyed Jeremy Blackman). Spector is idly in the process of becoming
estranged from his loutish father. Then finally, there is a jittery William H.
Macy as former whiz kid Donnie Smith, now just plain old current loser, Donnie
Smith.
Anderson shoots this with the same audacious camera motions he employed in
BOOGIE NIGHTS. At times he seems too in love with his own film making
abilities. He utilizes expansive pans, and whooshing, stylized hand-held
movements, simultaneously jacking up the volume on the soundtrack at just the
right moment for impact. While that's a sure way to increase the energy in one
scene, it becomes a bit exhausting if over done, as is occasionally the case.
The film has constant climaxes, realizations, and emotional outbursts all
handled relatively well. In one affecting sequence Blackman breaks down on air,
directing his malice at Jimmy Gator for heaping so much pressure on innocent
children. It's a distressing moment, because the kid has no idea how to convey
his feelings; they just come bursting out of him like a flood of pent up
sentiments. The reaction is substantially real, and one that thankfully isn't
accompanied by a bullying Hollywood score.
Though MAGNOLIA is chock full of great actors (some of whom doing their best
work here) it is Anderson who deserves much of the credit. His dialogue and the
way the actors use it, is authentic; the characters have a certain middle class
vagueness about them. They stutter, stumble over words, and interrupt each
other like genuine people. They talk about inconsequential things, and they
don't always communicate their emotions in ways that we're used to seeing.
Anderson takes a big chance with this movie; it's not typically mainstream, and
not one that even many critics have agreed on. But it's well worth it for
adventurous filmgoers. At three hours, MAGNOLIA is a constantly surprising epic
that bridges the gap between the believable and the unbelievable.

Review for Almost Famous (2000)

McDormand, Jason Lee, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Faizura Balk, Anna Paquin, 
Noah Taylor
After his tremendous success with JERRY MAGUIRE, writer\director Cameron 
Crowe was given a reasonably big budget, final cut and major studio backing 
to make ALMOST FAMOUS, the most personal of his films. It's a situation 
similar to the one Paul Thomas Anderson found himself in after BOOGIE NIGHTS 
(which was more of a critical darling than a huge success). Anderson chose to 
follow that up with MAGNOLIA, a film that displayed the fervency and scope of 
his earlier picture but was also granted leeway to include some artistic 
gambits that might've been frowned upon by studio heads. Some of them worked 
(I kinda dug the frogs, so sue me) and some of them didn't quite work (the 
musical interlude for instance, though I know people who disagree) but even 
the worst of his stratagems were sorta interesting for you could so clearly 
see the passion brimming behind them. With all that freedom Cameron Crowe has 
constructed a movie that's like the filmic equivalent of a classic rock song 
by Led Zepplin or The Doors. It's rambling, warm, whimsical, observant, and 
with a tinge of melancholy, though nothing that rudely announces itself via 
PATCH ADAMS-like obscene sentimentality.
ALMOST FAMOUS is Crowe's semi-autobiographical story of a fifteen year old 
prodigy, William Miller (newcomer Patrick Fugit, standing in for Cameron) 
who, on the encouragement of rock critic Lester Bangs (played with throaty 
charm by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), sets out to pursue a career as a rock 
writer. He manages to wrangle a freelance job with ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE and 
is sent on tour for several days with the about-to-hit rock band STILL WATER, 
headed by a low key Jim Morrison-type, Russell (Billy Crudup). Actually the 
lead singer is Bebe (Jason Lee, looking like Charles Manson's kinder, more 
docile brother), a whiny runt upstaged by Russell, the guitar player whose 
"looks are becoming a problem". Among them are the hanger ons, or groupies, 
seemingly led by uber-flower child Penny Lane (a sleepy eyed Kate Hudson).
The camera is just daffy over Hudson, or more likely Cameron is, for he 
trains it on her incessantly, caressing her pert, wide-open face as if it 
were an endangered monument. Penny comes with a bright all-knowing 
countenance, as if she were chock full of wisdom, though it's mostly an act 
to get Russell's attention. I'm not sure if this was the intent but I found 
Hudson's character to be more pathetic than loveable, though it hardly 
matters; she's an innocent seeking to meld herself with an image of cool. She 
is, of course, being used by Russell (who sleeps with her, then tosses her 
away like a used condom), which she may or may not be aware of. Penny chooses 
to see herself as something of a muse; it's her sex that inspires Russell to 
make the music she adores. A delusion, but a lovely one at that.
Other groupies include Faizura Balk as a scary-cool hipster and the apple pie 
Anna Paquin who says "lets deflower the boy" (referring to Fugit's William) 
and they do. Fugit is as doe eyed as they come, cherubic and cute though he 
doesn't make much of an impression but that's okay since he mostly serves as 
a tour guide to the other, more stimulating characters. Though still, the 
film suffers an itsy bit because it isn't endowed with a strong central 
character a la JERRY MAGUIRE or SAY ANYTHING. In the latter film, Crowe 
created a complete original with Lloyd Dobler (brought wonderfully to life by 
John Cusack), the oddly charming, hyper verbal sweetie that Cusack has been 
aping in some way or another his entire career (though I can hardly fault him 
for it, he does it so well). Fugit isn't nearly as memorable; in fact I'd 
probably have forgotten him had I not had to think about him in order to 
write this here review.
Hudson is a better character, an oxymoronic combo of giggly fangirl and 
blossoming independent; she's Crowe's most intriguing female creation. 
Meanwhile Russell, accurately played by Billy Crudup (JESUS' SON) as a 
regular guy inching towards the spotlight, (he's half prima donna, half "guy" 
guy) is more of a periphery character, as is Frances McDormand's mother and 
the quirkily named Zooey Deschanel the expressive actress who shows up in two 
scenes as William's older sister, rumpling his hair and cooing to him "Don't 
worry, someday you'll be cool". Even less a periphery character is the wildly 
charismatic Lester Bangs, played lovingly by Hoffman as a cynical dork 
savant. I would've loved to see a movie with this wily fellow as the 
protagonist, but he remains a brief, delightful presence, his screen time 
hardly totaling in at 5 minutes.
Nevertheless, those complaints are of mere crumbs amid a beatific cake; it's 
to Crowe's credit that he has us wishing we could spend more time with nearly 
every minor character. And ALMOST FAMOUS works to an equal to or greater 
degree than his past projects, none of which have been any less than good. 
(Even his much-derided SINGLES offered some insight into Gen X-ers, and I 
can't think of any other movie that came close to suggesting that this 
particular Generation was anything more than ironic, pop culture obsessed lay 
abouts).
ALMOST FAMOUS is as fun as JERRY MAGUIRE, but less muddled and without all 
that pesky soul searching. It has the infectious sweetness of SAY ANYTHING, 
though is visually much more confident. And there's also that zeal, the buzz 
you get when a filmmaker expresses his passions with the sure hand of a 
crackerjack veteran. Crowe is the rare mainstream director who loves his 
characters the way Paul Thomas Anderson loves his, and he's practically 
protective of them, as we become. For instance, the complete affection in 
which he gives us William's overprotective mother (whose mantra is "don't do 
drugs") is refreshing considering the adults in youth movies tend to be 
authoritative dolts. The character (played by Francis McDormand in pretty 
much the opposite of a shrill Shelly Winters performance) is a kind 
intellectual who wants her kids to read Shakespeare, and forbids them to 
listen to rock music because she desperately wants them to trek through life 
un-corrupted. As played by McDormand she's real hard not to like. Compare 
that to the hideous chain smoking, god loving, anti-rock caricature of a 
mother Lin Shaye played in DETROIT ROCK CITY, which, by the way, is similar 
in many respects to ALMOST FAMOUS except in how awfully stupid it is.
Here is a movie that loves its audience while most flicks come with barely 
concealed contempt for their audiences. And it also loves its music and the 
glorious, sometimes tragic effects of those melodies on the fans whose best 
memories are the amplified ones. Cameron captures this in a heartbreaking, 
silent ten seconds; he trains his camera on a prancing Kate Hudson, twirling 
about in a cleared out stadium amid floating litter. It's as if she just has 
to squeeze every last bit of energy she can from the showâŚeven well after its 
end. Crowe has made a movie that cheerfully greets us with open arms as if to 
say "Welcome to the party". And what a party it is.

Review for Deep Blue Sea (1999)
SPARKLER (1999)
GRADE: D
Director: Darren Stein
Screenplay: Darren Stein, Catherine Eads
Starring: Park Overall, Veronica Cartwright, Freddie Prinze Jr., Jamie Kennedy,
Steven Petracca, Don Harvey, Sandy Martin
 
The rise of certain indie filmmakers is somewhat baffling to me. You have a guy
like Morgan J. Freeman who directed HURRICANE STREETS, a flick that was lauded
as a "gritty" street drama, and ended up being about as authentic as
confederated products. His picture was a Sundance Film Festival favorite paving
the way for more mediocrity from Freeman (namely, DESERT BLUE). Then you have a
talented guy like Larry Fessenden, who directed the chilling urban\gothic
horror tale, HABIT on 16mm film, because he could not secure a budget large
enough to make it on 35 mm. Maybe this is because of the increasing
"mainstreaming" of indie films. Is HAPPY TEXAS (1999's Sundance champ) a clever
indie, or a very 80's one-joke buddy movie? It feels an awful lot like the
latter, yet it received many accolades for essentially being a low budget
throwback to the days of WHAT ABOUT BOB? So many indies are being produced
(every major studio has an indie wing that specializes in "alternative" films)
that many have began ripping each other off (example: ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE
is DRUGSTORE COWBOY minus Matt Dillon plus James Woods). The independent film
makers who kick started the "indie revolution" in the early 90's (David
O.Russel, Robert Rodriguez, Richard Linklater, Todd Solondz) have turned to
major studios for their funding, while Tarantino wannabes churn out the junk
that now passes for independent film.
This brings me to Darren Stein, who directed SPARKLER in 1997, later released
in 1999 presumably because of Freddie Prinze Jr.'s rapid rise to stardom. This
picture gave Stein a chance to direct the similarly awful JAWBREAKER (also
released in 1999). Both films bare the mark of an overzealous film geek with
little to say of his own. JAWBREAKER was like a Puff Daddy remix of popular
teen flicks from the past and present, incorporating bits form CLUELESS,
SCREAM, HEATHERS, the T.V show PARKER CAN'T LOSE, and CARRIE to form a
look-at-how-hip-I-am pastiche of bubble-gum teen alienation with nary a genuine
emotion to be found amid the stolen celluloid. So, SPARKLER'S gotta be better
right? After all this was the film that studio executives at Sony Pictures saw,
thus giving them the incentive to sign this guy, and fork over the cash for him
to direct JAWBREAKER.
Well, it isn't the first time nor will it be the last time that studio
executives were wrong. And I knew I was in trouble after the first five minutes
whereupon we are introduced to a group of stereotypically cartoonish trailer
trash. The SPARKLER is Mattie (sitcom veteran Park Overall) a little girl stuck
in a middle-aged woman's body (figuratively of course). She's a
head-in-the-clouds dreamer, who finds an opportunity to pursue her dreams after
discovering her husband is cheating on her. She dresses herself in a bright
green, sparkly get-up and saunters off to a local bar. Meanwhile three city
boys on their way to Vegas converge at the bar after a flat tire stalls them.
The leader of the click appears to be Brad (Freddie Prinze Jr.), a bossy
aspiring Hollywood agent. Joel (Steven Petracca) is a grumpy, hapless fellow
with a secret, and Trent (Jamie Kennedy) is the sweet puppy dog of the group.
They spot Mattie from far away, commenting on her fashion sense ("Wow, somebody
actually morphed a human being and a disco ball"). She approaches the boys
querying them for a dance, to which only Trent responds. He is enchanted with
her for whatever reason. However the boys find it more difficult to ditch her
then they originally thought. Following circumstances too moronic to recount,
she winds up meeting them in Vegas, while searching for an old high school
friend, Dottie (Veronica Cartwright). Dottie is an ex-showgirl, now a stripper
in a scruffy lesbian strip joint, complete with overzealous transvestites.
Meanwhile Mattie's redneck husband comes looking for her.
At first Stein's movie is like a sweeter, less satiric, more amateurish, John
Waters film. Like Waters he pores on the sleaze (we get the aforementioned
transvestite strippers, cursing old biddies, and Dottie's attempted molestation
of Freddie Prinze Jr.), though unlike Waters he isn't intelligent about it. His
sleaze serves no purpose. None of it is well done enough to be entertaining,
nor is it thoughtful enough to be absorbing. It's just there. His characters
are all caricatures (just like in all Waters' films), but they aren't smartly
drawn caricatures. They're simplistic and predictable.
It's a shame that Stein had to cast Overall in his hodgepodge of rubbish. She
seems to have really invested in her part. Overall has a smokey-hickory
southern accent that's both grating and comforting. She's an aged dreamer with
a shimmering naďve smile, and the actress sometimes suggests depth and
poignancy in simple gestures. It's too bad that it's at the service of this
dull tripe.
While I actively disliked both of Stein's films don't think I'm dooming his
career. After all M. Night Shyamalan directed two completely forgettable
formula pictures (PRAYING WITH ANGER, WIDE AWAKE) before turning out the very
well made (though still slightly flawed in my book) THE SIXTH SENSE. Sometimes
talent seemingly springs out of the places you least expect it to. Maybe Stein
will grow up by his next endeavor. Then again, maybe it will take longer than
that: His upcoming project has been described as a combo of SEVEN and BLADE
RUNNER.

Review for Pay It Forward (2000)
Starring: Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osmet, Angie Dickinson, James 
Caviezel, Jay Mohr, Jon Bon Jovi, David Ramsey, Gary Werntz
When critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like PATCH ADAMS or more 
recently PAY IT FORWARD as I am about to do, their opinions are often greeted 
with a backlash of angry e-mails, sometimes even mock death threats from 
those who (I suppose) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their 
entertainment. Even politicians (!) tend to dismiss film critics as heartless 
cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising "filth" 
like PULP FICTION. These [fill in the derogatory term that you are 
comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic's job is to review the 
movie, not the message, however sweet and endearing that message may be. 
Thusly PATCH ADAMS isn't a bad film because it's about a doctor who cares for 
his patients; it's a bad film because it's a calculated piece of brazen 
audience exploitation. Similarly while PAY IT FORWARD may have its heart in 
the right place (though I even doubt that, stay tuned, an explanation is 
forthcoming), it's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess.
The picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher (a 
somewhat similarly guarded Kevin Spacey), with a burn scared face and equally 
singed attitude, who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of 
doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world. 
12 year old Trevor (Haley Joel Osmet), a Disneyfied do gooder who takes care 
of his alcoholic mother (Helen Hunt), comes up with the notion to PAY IT 
FORWARD; this entails a person doing one good deed (call it an uber favor) 
for three others, then telling them to do the same for three others and 
before long we're all living in a Frank Capra movie. Meanwhile in a parallel 
story, a weasely reporter (Jay Mohr) tracks the "movement" which has 
apparently begun to grow.
PAY IT FORWARD has odd ideas about tone; at certain points it hurls a 
smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate 
antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core. It's as if director Mimi 
Leder didn't have the confidence to make PAY IT FORWARD the way she intended, 
and compromised out of fear that her film wasn't "gutsy" enough to earn the 
acclaim it has clearly been made for. So the picture adds grit (a child 
molester propositions Trevor, a homeless man returns to heroin after being 
"saved", a character is knifed while doing a good deed, etc) though it seems 
shallow, incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn't 
quite sure if it's ready to buy into its own utopian blather.
PAY IT FORWARD offers "crowd pleasing" elements for general audiences; Jay 
Mohr's umpteenth variation on the WASPy sleazeball, Angie Dickinson's earthy 
alcoholic bag woman, and the jive-talking "black hoodlum with a heart of 
gold" (coming on the heals of the black, god-like inmate embodied by Gabriel 
Casseus in BEDAZZLED, this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty 
white liberal cliché. Hurray for Hollywood) who actually calls the Mohr 
character a "nigga" and says things like "can you feel me?" Leave it to PAY 
IT FORWARD to happily include a little minstrel act for our further 
enjoyment. (Maybe Spike's flick wasn't so misguided after all). These scenes 
feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather 
than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you'll find yourself trapped in 
should you not heed my warnings.
While the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope 
this is a film that could make the world a better place, to me the final 
product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting 
cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience. It's a picture that looks to be 
tailor made for Academy consideration, with the main players (all previous 
Oscar winners or nominees) given big emotional scenes that are practically 
variations on their most lauded turns. One scene in which a slightly 
de-glamed Helen Hunt (de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion 
victim [her look is somewhere between Goth queen and trailer park mama], 
Hunt's hair is also natty and badly bleached) verbally castigates Spacey, 
feels right out of her AS GOOD AS IT 
GETS Oscar clip. Spacey, of course, responds in his cultured monotone, that 
could be straight from his low key AMERICAN BEAUTY performance. Maybe the 
actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously 
irritating; though how can he not, even when he's emoting Spacey seems 
somehow shielded by a wry indifference.
The usually talented Helen Hunt is the worst offender. In one atrocious 
TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL moment Hunt slaps Osmet, immediately covering her mouth 
with the guilty hand in that very same stroke, and with said hand still on 
said mouth, she actually begins convulsing (dry heaving really), then (and 
I'm not making this up) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart 
in a frenzied search for alcohol. The scene is so hokey it could very nearly 
be construed as a parody of hackneyed TV movie blow-ups; it's all very 
theatrical, especially Hunt's performance, which feels like a pathetic plea 
to the Academy for another Oscar. PAY IT FORWARD has the dubious distinction 
of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn't 
get Academy Awards. The picture unknowingly affirms that Oscars transform 
nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists.
Even Haley Joel Osemt, the wunderkind who was nominated for an Academy award 
for his unforced performance in SIXTH SENSE, seems more divisive about his 
expressions and inflections. His acting has become broader, less intimate; 
it's as if we can make out the little munchkin's thoughts: "boy this outta 
floor em". Naturally Osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies 
children, a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother, lectures her on the 
ills of drinking, and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual 
teacher. Never mind that the two couldn't be more dissimilar; his mother is 
trailer trash dopey, and the teacher is one of those Dennis Miller-ey 
intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary. 
Nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair 
together in a scene that recalls PARENT TRAP-ish cornball antics. But oh how 
we love bright, articulate, self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by 
their bootstraps and guide them through life. They're so adorable.
Of course the blame can't all be hoisted onto the actors (though with the 
exception of the little kid, they probably should have known better), instead 
the brunt of it should be passed on to Mimi Leder, who directed one of the 
most thrilling episodes of ER, then went on to make two awful genre films in 
a row. The first being THE PEACEMAKER, a witless post-Cold War George Clooney 
vehicle, and DEEP IMPACT, one of the two films of 1998 to squander the 
premise of Earth's possible demise by a crazed meteorite.
The first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clichés, and a complete 
absence of any kind of emotional involvement, not aided by an ending which 
actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with 
digital read out (apparently present for an invisible audience). DEEP IMPACT 
has more in common with PAY IT FORWARD; it's a movie that treats Earth's 
impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms, completely ignoring the 
havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet 
would be a goner within days. The film was full of inspirational speeches 
where people really said nothing, though the sappy score swelled up to make 
it appear as if they were being profoundly touching. In PAY IT FORWARD Leder 
continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming 
almost like a rebuttal: "See my movie isn't as naďve as you 
might think" she seems to be saying. No, it's just horribly confused.

Review for Gladiator (2000)
Screenplay: David Franzoni, John Logan, William Nicholson
Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neslson, Djimon Hounsou,
Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi,Richard Harris, David Schofield, John Shrapnel, Tomas
Arana
   GLADIATOR is one empty spectacle. But damn, what a spectacle it is. The film
is Ridley Scott's attempt at a post millennial sword and sandals epic akin to
SPARTUCUS or BEN HUR though the final product bears a closer resemblance to
CONAN THE BARBARIAN plus some added pretension. With GLADIATOR it's obvious
that Scott really wanted to make an important film rather than an exploitive
action yarn like CONAN, though his expository scenes are dull and lacking in
the charge of his spastic action sequences. Still, even those sequences really
don't work on quite the level they're supposed to.
   The opening battle (easily the worst action scene in the film) is a
hodgepodge of pompous Hans Zimmer patriotic marching crap that sounds like a
Puff Daddy remix of the composer's scores from CRIMSON TIDE, BROKEN ARROW and
THE ROCK, sped up film stock, and quick cuts of graphic carnage all building up
to a long slo-mo digression complete with much gratuitous howling. It must also
be mentioned that the scene is so murkily downcast for no reason other than
Scott's seemingly fetishistic attraction to grungy palettes. (Remember it was
Ridley Scott who filmed his GI JANE training sequences like lessons in
stylistic masturbation complete with, yes, Hans Zimmer, rain, lightning, mud,
saliva, sweat, everything but semen). This makes the screen appear as if Scott
and his crew smeared shit over the camera lens in order to create some sort of
epic sword and sandals-noir!?!??? It wants to be all moody and fill us with
ominous dread, but all it did was make me want to hose the screen down with a
vat of Windex.
   Thus begins our supposed epic: Maximus (Russell Crowe in what would have
been the Jean-Claude Van Damme role had this film been made a mere seven years
ago) is picked (for very hackneyed political reasons) by the emperor of Rome
(Richard Harris, seething with Shakespearean glee) to be his replacement, but
the emperor's son Commudus (Joaquin Phoenix) will have none of that. He's a
greedy, whiny brat who wants to rule so badly that he kills his own father,
takes his throne, then orders his guards to lead Maximus out into the woods and
have him killed. The plan goes awry for Commodus when the mighty Maximus (I
smell a HERCULES spin-off waiting in the wings) escapes in a rousing and
appropriately brutal getaway. He races on foot back to his picturesque commode
hoping to be greeted by his family, only when he arrives they've already been
killed by Commudus' minions. Our hero passes out and is eventually picked up by
slave traders--the kind of slave traders who roam the countryside searching for
unconscious victims of those corrupt Romans. You know the kind. He's sold to
Proximo (Oliver Reed, sharper than ever in his final performance), a former
gladiator and current trainer. After Maximus endures some qualifying bouts
under the reluctant guidance of Proximo, he makes his way up to the
much-dreaded Coliseum.
   Everything seems to be in place for one helluva an epic, the sort of epic
that will be cherished forever amongst many generations 
to come. And don't get me wrong, for many this will be just that. Allow me to
elaborate: before dolling out a review I customarily scan those of other film
critics, in a search of opinions that clash with my own. I looked far and wide
for a negative review of GLADIATOR and all I could find was Roger Ebert's pithy
write up. Judging from a quick scan of that review (I make it a habit never to
read an entire review before writing one of my own because I'm so darn serious
about my craftâŚpathetic, no?) I noticed that the portly critic seemed to be
all up in arms about historical inaccuracies, none of which (to show how awful
I was in History) I even noticed. Others are calling it the best film of the
year, a sure Oscar contender, and audiences definitely like it as well; the
crowd I saw it with reacted just as positively to the film as the crowd I saw
STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE with reacted negatively. However a promising
story, good performances, and decent art direction does not a classic make.
   My biggest caveat with the flick is how hollow its script is. No emotion
feels true; it's as if the screenwriters poured over BRAVEHEART in an attempt
to transport that story to the time of the Coliseum. And with no help from
Ridley Scott who seems to think that he can compensate for that lack of depth
by giving us lengthy expository scenes and making his characters overly gloomy
(I think Russell Crowe smiles maybe once throughout the entire film).
   Those expository scenes are akin to (sorry to bring up Lucas's steaming pile
of celluloid waste, but I must for I am far too lazy to think of a better
example) the political trial scenes in STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE, which
virtually everyone will agree were dramatically inert, passionless, and, well,
boring. GLADITOR's expository scenes are just as tedious, and while the
dialogue is mostly decent and the performances are above par, there's nothing
behind it all, no subtext, no character. Instead of becoming involved in the
picture I found myself stealing glances at this very attractive blonde woman
sitting below me to my right. She seemed so into the film. I wish I could have
been that involved.
   When I wasn't gazing at the blonde I was hoping for more of Scott's
stylistic excesses, which probably would have annoyed the piss out of me in any
really good movie, now, at least they kept me attentive. Those action sequences
try to enthrall us the way SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did, and Scott employs a similar
technique, choosing to film his action up close rather than from afar. But RYAN
grabbed you by following its characters through the nightmarish obstacles of
war in a documentary like fashion that made the audience feel as if they were a
part of the horrific undertaking. Scott, instead, opts to film his battles as a
series of jerky movements and quick cuts. While RYAN drew you into the action,
GLADIATOR continually flinches away from it.
   Much has been said about how Scott is filming this old-fashioned epic with
all the modern technology at his hands. Sure the film is always nice to look at
(though not nearly as nice as that blondeâŚ) but we are always aware that the
Rome we see is an effect (while I'm positive the blonde was real). Nobody in
the audience will mistake the Coliseum for the Coliseum. The structure we see
looks about as authentic as textbook art placed up on the big screen. Which
isn't to say that it looks bad, it just doesn't look authentic.
   Where Scott really goes wrong is not in the design but in the conception. He
seems to believe that all he needs to make a great movie is the ingredients of
one; scorned hero, duplicitous bad guy, parables of today, ad nausemum. What he
neglects to include is the passion that is essential to become involved on a
deeper level. Some may think the film is deep because everything is in place
for it to be. But look closer as the tag line for AMERICAN BEAUTY screams. And
if you do all that you will see is an abundance of Scott's fabricated rage.

Review for Bring It On (2000)
Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford, Gabrielle Union, Clare 
Kramer, Huntley Ritter, Tsianina Joelson, Nicole Bilderback, Rini Bell, Ian 
Roberts, Richard Hillman
BRING IT ON is CLUELESS for those who felt that particular movie was too 
leisurely paced. Akin to much of the current teen dribble being ladled on 
audiences like so much cheese, it moves at a rapid MTV-ized pace, its camera 
hardly able to keep up with the fast walking pretty actors as they speedily 
deliver the latest (stylized) teen lingo ("Dyke-a-delic!" a teen princess 
squeals). And it's one of those flicks where every scene commences with the 
blasting of some current top 20 hit, its volume rising depending on the tenor 
of the scene, or some times just rising for the sheer hell of it. Like most 
teen-pop fairy tales it takes place in a posh high school that looks more 
like a heavenly resort than even the ritziest private school. And it happens 
to be populated by a gaggle of muscular, runway-ready hunks and obviously 
silicon-enhanced honeys. Come as it has during the dog days of August, BRING 
IT ON may just be the best back to school commercial ever made. But as a 
feature length film its merits are more questionable.
The flick centers on the trials and tribulations of a cheerleader squad 
populated by the usual sexy, valley girl\porn star types. Meaning that all 
major set pieces revolve around hyperbolic cheerleading routines in which the 
girls smile brightly and cartwheel about, hinting, not so subtly, at their 
coquettish sexuality while pulsating techno and alterna-rock attempt to 
energize the audience into feeling something…anything. 
(Am I the only one who finds cheerleaders a bit on the creepy side? 
With their false ear-to-ear grins and programmed sunny disposition they 
remind me of female clowns, manic-expressives not so much having a good time 
as laboriously trying to create the illusion of F-U-N) 
BRING IT ON reminds me of one of those 70's Roger Corman exploitation pics 
(BIG DOLL HOUSE, CANDY STRIP NURSES) but unlike those this one finds itself 
confined to a PG-13 rating, though it obviously would prefer to be R. 
Included are several scenes that feel very soft core pornish. There's one in 
which the bikini-clad cheerleaders sexily grind up against cars, soap 
dribbling from their taut flesh, sexual innuendoes involving antennas abound, 
in other words, a bikini car wash scene approved to unspool before the glazed 
eyes of many thirteen year old boys.
Much like most of the Corman pictures, BRING IT ON even tries to sneak in a 
bit of a social message amidst all that jiggling. We find that the bratty, 
affluent (read: white) cheerleaders have been stealing routines from a bunch 
of tough, inner city (read: black) cheerleaders. As is to be expected this is 
embarrassingly explored with even less insight than one would find in an 
average AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL, but I suppose the movie had to be about 
something.
BRING IT ON demonstrates to us cynical types that cheerleaders have 
consciences too, with its plucky heroine, Torrance (Kirsten Dunst playing a 
bright eyed combo of her dopey teen caricatures in DICK and DROP DEAD 
GORGEOUS) scrunching up her face and exclaiming "It just isn't right!" No it 
isn't, and this bleeding heart even goes out of her way to make things right 
by pleading to her well-off father to puhleeze sponsor the inner city 
cheerleaders for the inevitable cheerleading competition (wonder of wonders, 
such a thing really exists), victory be damned. 
A myriad of sub plots find themselves scrunched in between all the mid-riff 
baring; Eliza Dushku (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER; the show, not the movie) is 
the sarcastic rebel chick who shows up at the very end of one of those goofy 
[cheerleading] audition scenes where each candidate is more inept and 
clueless than the proceeding one. Dushku is, at first, sniveled at for her 
punky appearance but she regales the crowd by leaping and flipping like a 
deft ninja. Despite the show she puts on, the preppy cheerleaders still hate 
her, but nonetheless let her into their little cult, for it would be plain 
rah-rah retarded to deny her Olympic-like athletic ability. She has a 
brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford, giving us little more than a slanted smile) 
who cozies up to Torrance in the film's second best scene which has them 
brushing their respective teeth in unison, bizarrely trying to one-up each 
other with the amount of foamy toothpaste they can spit up. 
The best scene is the one where, after reluctantly hiring a choreographer, 
they meet the psycho. Played with sniveling malice by Ian Roberts, the guy is 
like a wacky drill instructor, barking orders and insults ("Cheerleader's are 
dancers gone retarded") rather than offering anything resembling guidance. 
Roberts is so good, he just about steals the movie in only about seven 
minutes of screen time. That should virtually guarantee him some odd MTV 
MOVIE AWARD nomination. 
At the center of it all is Kirsten Dunst, who I've liked before. Here she 
comes across as something of a young, sickly sweet (and phony) Kathie Lee 
Gifford and that's not a good thing. I'd call her caricature clever if I 
wasn't so damn annoyed by how one-dimensional it is. Better is Eliza Dushku, 
the cynical one, who at least doesn't call attention to herself. Most of the 
cast seems to have learned their acting style from repeated viewings of SAVED 
BY THE BELL, which actually serves them just fine in a picture such as this. 
By the end, at the aforementioned cheerleading competition, the film has 
degenerated into a series of interchangeable routines, made even more 
interchangeable by the director's constantly flinching camera; the entire 
finale looks like a cut and paste job. And then there are the victors who 
should be fairly obvious once you realize the film is as guilty and liberal 
as its impossibly pert heroine. But the film makers sure try hard, giving us 
some fun teen dialogue ("Do you speak fag?"), a bit of unnecessary projectile 
vomiting (I thought SCARY MOVIE was supposed to be next door) and a 
surprisingly well placed fart gag. Roger Corman would have a ball. As would 
his grand kids.

Title
Review for Guinevere (1999)
Author: iysmall@aol.com (Ron Small)
Starring: Stephan Rea, Sarah Polley, Jean Smart, Paul Dooley, Gina Gershon,
Sandra Oh, Jasmine Guy, Francis Guinan, Carrie Preston
When Robert Redford courts Kristen Scott Thomas in THE HORSE WHISPERER, the
dynamics of age are conspicuously absent from the proceedings. They're ignored
or accepted for the purposes of fantasy, but GUINEVERE does neither. The most
refreshing bits of the film center on how and why these relationships come to
fruition. It gives us some low key humor and dollops of the kind of gloomy
romantic angst that those French seem to enjoy so much (yes, that is a broad
generalization). But it also rather refreshingly challenges the male half of
the older man\ younger woman equation. Unfortunately it loses focus when it
isn't dealing with that issue.
In Tinseltown it's expected that aging hunks like Warren Beatty and Sean
Connery romance women young enough to call them grandpa. Though whenever we see
such a couple on the street we immediately assume that the man in question must
be a damn Rockefeller and the women in question must be a gold digging tart who
would gladly appear on WHO WANTS TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE? Only in Hollywood (a
mythical region where hotties like Lara Flynn Boyle throw themselves at baldies
like Jack Nicholsen) is such an oddity looked upon as normal. As I type this
Katie Holmes is wooing Michael Douglas (a man so old his wrinkles have
wrinkles) in multiplexes everywhere. Interestingly enough after filming WONDER
BOYS (in case you were curious) Douglas gets to enact the fantasy that Katie
Holmes presented by going home and banging the stunning (and just of diapers)
Catherine Zeta Jones. (Though I'm assuming the fantasy ended when Douglas
accidentally, again my own interpretation, impregnated the mighty Zeta. Oops).
In GUINEVERE's most effective scene, an effete snob (well played by Jean Smart)
confronts her 21-year-old daughter's middle aged lover: "What do you have
against women your own age?" she snarls. Connie, the middle aged man in
question, is photographed beneath her as if shamed by her bluntness. She
doesn't let him answer; instead the woman provides a contemptuous monologue
that's also painfully correct: Connie seeks out young, inexperienced women
because they look up to him as a noble savant. He's like rogue artist with much
wisdom to impart, a man who ever so romantically shuns the rich and lives for
his art in a ratty little apartment. And he believes in them, pushing them to
their full potential the way nobody else cared to do. But he wants something
from them in return. Connie wants more than respect, he wants them gaze upon
him with gooey eyes full of awe, and they do. He draws these pups in by giving
them the adoration that they've lacked in their lives. Connie is a predator,
though too sad to be malicious, he's the kind who rationalizes his faults by
"helping" his prey while simultaneously hurting them.
Harper (Sarah Polley) is a rich, shy young woman, unfairly picked on by her
family of elitist snobs. She isn't as out going, charming, or obedient enough
to be loved by them. Harper is like a modern day Cinderella with her presumably
more beautiful sister getting all the adulation. She finds the parental love
she lacks in Connie (Stephan Rea), the middle aged photographer who fancies
himself an artist. He treats her like a goddess (Queen Guenivere he calls her).
For her, this is new; nobody has ever given her this much affection. And before
long she has moved into his apartment and become his assistant as well as
lover. And Connie is in ecstasy. He is a man that enjoys the act of falling in
love rather than being in love and clearly this is the start of a new cycle.
The scene between Connie and Harper's mother is so psychologically captivating
that I wish the film had retained more of that edge. GUINEVERE's biggest flaw
is its reluctance to follow through on its most enthralling bits. However it
provides some nice understated psychological moments between Connie and Harper.
At one pont he somberly asks her "Whose my good little girl?" to which she
replies (after a stunned glance) "Me". It's sadly touching that her need for
that kind of affection puts her in the position of a helpless little child. If
someone asked me if I was a good little boy (or a good little girl for that
matter) I doubt that I would stick around after my stunned glance no matter how
down on myself I felt. Harper not only stays but basks in his misguided love.
She is his good little girl.
Sarah Polly, as Harper, is extraordinary at playing a self-conscious young
woman just as effectively as she played a wild child in GO. Her face is a
myriad of simplistically complex expressions; facile looks and gestures take
you inside her character's mind. At other times she's less subtle, but just as
effective. In scenes where Connie tends to become overly intense she breaks
into giddy fits of laughter. It reminds us that for all the grown up postures
she attempts that Harper is still an insecure child.
Stephan Rea is stoic, appearing like an emotionless brick of a man, too
self-conscious to let any emotions bleed through his sturdy exterior. Though
his guard is pummeled down in one scene where an angered Harper rapidly snaps
off pictures of him, using her Nikon camera like a weapon. Rea is the kind of
actor who tends to fade into the background. He isn't commanding (at least not
in a typical movie star way) but understated which sometimes both helps and
hurts his roles. Rea played the lead in THE CRYING GAME, where he appeared in
nearly every scene with the same placated self he presents here. As such I
found it difficult to get into his character (a character that lingered in the
background when he should have been in the foreground) in that film. In
GUINEVERE his minimalist style works more effectively because he's playing a
cerebral character who expresses himself through photographs, not outward
charm.
Unfortunately the screenplay lacks the edge that the film's actors bring. It
feels a little too safe. Writer director Audrey Welles (she wrote the
screenplay for THE TRUTH ABOUT CAT'S AND DOGS) has clearly tapped into
something personal but I don't think she had the balls to take it further into
darker places. She also flounders a bit in a silly denouement that feels
awfully forced (and one that steals liberally from ALL THAT JAZZ). It includes
a supposed sisterly connection that is formed between all of the various
Guienvere's Connie has cultivated (or maybe they cultivated him), and an absurd
fantasy sequence that's both poignant and, well, absurd.
At its best GUINEVRE is a thoughtful exploration of why these
O'Keefe\Streiglitz relationships begin (and how they end), at its worst it's a
Lifetime Television Special gloss on the obsessions of Woody Allen. I seriously
doubt Michael Douglas would recommend it.
