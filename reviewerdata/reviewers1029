Title
Review for Deep End of the Ocean, The (1999)
_The_Deep_End_of_the_Ocean_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Michelle Pfeiffer turns in an impassioned performance of often
gut-wrenching intensity in a film that deserves far less.  It's not that
the basic story is without promise.  Beth Cappadora (Pfeiffer) loses her
three-year-old son, only to have him resurface on her doorstep nine years
later with no recollection of his former family (Ryan Merriman plays the
now-12-year-old son).  It's a setup ripe with psychological and emotional
conflict, and apparently Jacquelyn Mitchard did it justice in her novel of
the same name, which was not only a bestseller but none other than a
selection in Oprah Winfrey's book club.
However, director Ulu Grosbard and scripter Stephen Schiff follow
pedestrian TV-movie-like paces, from the abrupt and overly tidy ending to
the rebelliously-bitter-yet-guilt-ridden older brother, well-played by
Emmy-winning _General_Hospital_ star Jonathan Jackson.  In fact, all the
characters are well-played by the actors.  It's just that the material is
about as shallow as its deeply metaphoric title (the meaning of which, for
the record, is never explained in the film).

Title
Review for X-Men (2000)
As geeky as it sounds, I must admit it--when it comes to _X-Men_, I am
what is called a "fanboy."  I grew up fervently following the comic book
exploits of the team whose membership is made of genetically evolved,
superpowered "mutants."  Seeing a group of guys and gals kicking serious
ass with their superhuman abilities is undoubtedly a major factor in my
(and many others') interest, but what has made _X-Men_ so popular--and
very passionately so, at that--are the realistic characters, authentic
people who just happen to have powers.  And while most comics treat their
heroes' and heroines' abilities as simply a cool gift, for the X-Men and
mutants in general, it is also very much a curse; much like any other
minorities, mutants face severe prejudice from the rest of the
population.
So adapting _X-Men_ and its sprawling, 30-year-plus history into a
100-minute feature film is a dicey proposition for any filmmaker, and
even moreso for one who was not a fan to begin with--such as Bryan
Singer, who is at the helm of Fox's lavish, long-awaited $80-million
extravaganza.  Not only must he appease the fanboys by not deviating too
far from the source material, he must also make what is essentially a
three-decade-long-and-counting soap opera accessible to the non-fan.  And
contrary to fans' greatest fears, Singer's _X-Men_ is an exciting,
fast-paced adventure that will satisfy both audiences.
For a summer blockbuster--especially one based on a comic book--an
$80-million budget is a pittance, but it's an appropriate figure for
_X-Men_.  Spectacular visual effects are called for (and are effectively
employed) to bring the team's powers to life, but the budget limitation
forces the filmmakers to make the effects a carefully used enhancement of
the story and characters, which are hence given more weight (as they
always had been in the comic).
For the most part, credited scripter David Hayter and a gaggle of
uncredited scribes (including Singer's Oscar-winning _Usual_Suspects_
partner Christopher McQuarrie and _Buffy_ maestro Joss Whedon) succeed in
making the characters mirror their counterparts on the page.  The X-Men
is a team of mutants led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), a
powerful telepath who runs a school for "gifted youngsters" and fights
for mutant tolerance.  As the film begins, his team consists of Jean Grey
(Famke Janssen), a telekinetic (i.e., can move objects with her mind) and
a telepath herself; Scott Summers, a.k.a. Cyclops (James Marsden), who
cannot control his deadly optic blasts; and Ororo Monroe, a.k.a. Storm
(Halle Berry), who can control the weather.
Those established members, however, take a backseat in the film to the
new recruits, Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna
Paquin).  The wild, mysterious Wolverine is perhaps best known for his
retractable, razor-sharp claws made of the indestructible metal
adamantium (his entire skeleton is also bonded with it), but his mutant
abilities are heightened senses and a rapid healing factor.  Rogue can
absorb a person's lifeforce, personality, and memories (and, in the case
of other mutants, powers) with a single touch.  After discovering her
ability after kissing her boyfriend, a distraught Rogue flees her native
Mississippi for snowy Canada, where she meets Wolverine.  When the two
are attacked by the evil and animalistic Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), it's
Storm and Cyclops to the rescue, and Wolverine and Rogue soon find
themselves getting acquainted with the ways of Xavier's school.
Jackman, an unknown Australian actor known for his musical theater
credits, and the teenage Paquin were Singer's two most controversial
casting choices.  Only one will completely win over skeptical fans:
Jackman, who completely inhabits Wolvie's wild, woolly persona; from his
first scene, fans should have no doubt about the actor's ability to
embody the character's trademark ferocity.  Paquin will have a harder
time of convincing the fanboys.  Young, waifish, and unglamorous, she in
no way resembles (in appearance and temperament) the sexy, sassy,
voluptuous, and now-20something comic book Rogue (the team's most popular
female member).  But within the context of the film's story--that is, as
a "starting point" Rogue--her casting is understandable, and aside from
an inconsistent Southern accent, Paquin is perfectly adequate.  Even so,
for the inevitable sequel, I suggest Singer pull an Anakin Skywalker and
age Rogue a few years by way of a recast--and thus bringing to the screen
the true Rogue fans know and love.
Needless to say, Rogue is the character that is least true to her
printed incarnation.  In addition to the change in age, she is given a
real name (Marie), and her upbringing by evil mutant shapeshifter
Mystique (and, hence, Rogue's history as a villain) is completely
jettisoned.  Mystique does appear in the film (played by Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos), but only as part of a fairly faceless support team (along
with Sabretooth and the aptly named Toad, played by Ray Park) for the
film's central villain, Magneto (Ian McKellen).  Magneto is an old friend
of Xavier's, but the two drifted apart over their difference of
philosophy.  Xavier believes that there is hope for regular humans to
accept mutantkind, but Magneto doesn't, preferring to go to war with
them.
Magneto's dastardly scheme to bring humans and mutants to level genetic
ground is the focus of the plot, and this thin story is indeed the film's
weakest element.  But the shortcoming is easy to forgive when the
atmosphere and smaller details feel so right.  The whole allegorical
issue of "mutant hysteria"--perpetuated by bigoted U.S. Senator Robert
Kelly (Bruce Davison)--is well-developed and played with the earnestness
it deserves, as is a WWII-era-set prologue that faithfully details
Magneto's beginnings.  In fact, the serious--though never
pretentious--tone of the film perfectly matches that of the comic, never
veering into the camp sensibilities that have marred other
comic-to-screen adaptations.  Singer and the writers must also be
commended for doing a bang-up job with the character relationships.  The
tense triangle between Scott, Jean, and Logan is perfectly played out;
and Wolvie's bond with Rogue is also nicely handled.
But, being a fanboy, I'm not above nitpicking over certain things. 
While the Wolverine/Rogue relationship works in the film's context, in
terms of the comics it bears more resemblance to his bond with two other
young mutants, Kitty Pryde and Jubilee (both of whom have cameos in the
film), than anything he ever had with Rogue.  Another throwaway mutant
appearance, that of Iceman (here referred to only by his real name,
Bobby), is sure to upset purists; he's a teen and Rogue's kinda-sorta
boyfriend at Xavier's school.  Rogue's young age also means the erasure
of the fascinating sexual tension between her and Magneto, which could
have come into play at a crucial juncture of the film.  And pity poor
Storm.  While Berry gives the character appropriate poise and elegance,
the writers give her very little to do.  Her forceful leadership
abilities are gone, as are her claustrophobia (which should have been a
factor in one scene) and sisterly relationship with Jean.  Plus, what is
the deal with that woefully unconvincing wig and her brown eyes (they
should be blue)?
But some things have to give when adapting a comic to film (much like
any book-to-screen translation), and for this fanboy, it's a relief that
overall _X-Men_ the film bears uncommon fidelity to its source material. 
And as a critic, it's a relief to see an effects-laden popcorn movie
offer a bit more meat than is traditionally required of such films.  That
said, _X-Men_ is best seen as just the jumping-off point for a possible
big screen franchise--one whose full potential can be realized in
subsequent installments.

Title
Review for Double Take (2001)
_Double_Take_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
Eddie Griffin, stand-up comic and star of the defunct UPN sitcom
_Malcolm_&_Eddie_.  Orlando Jones, co-star of _The_Replacements_ and
commonly recognized as the "7Up Guy."  Put these two together, and you
get an action comedy that can be called just about anything... but funny.
Despite what the ads lead one to believe, _Double_Take_ is not about
swapping identities so much as simply swapping outfits.  When some
heavies target Wall Street banker Daryl Chase (Jones) thanks to some
dirty dealings at his firm, he trades clothes with loudmouth street
hustler Freddy Tiffany (Griffin) to get out of a sticky situation.  After
the danger has been avoided and the two take a long trip to Mexico for
safety, for some reason the pair never think to switch back, and for
equally inscrutable reasons they start to play at being the
other--leading to all sorts of mistaken identity situations.  Never mind
that their impressions of each other wouldn't fool anybody, nor the fact
that Griffin and Jones simply LOOK NOTHING ALIKE--in changing from formal
to casual wear, they are taken as completely different people.
Maybe writer-director George Gallo was trying to make some
sociopolitical comment about how non-blacks think all blacks look alike,
but that's giving him way too much credit.  Besides, Gallo has a lot of
other things on his mind: namely the convolutions of his overly plotted
script.  _Double_Take_ appears to be a lark of an entertainment, but
there are so many sudden doublecrosses and reversals that it's
bewildering.  Not that deciphering the plot is worth the effort; the
explanations Gallo offers are crude at best.  If there's anything Gallo
successfully does, it's confuse the audience.
And if there's one thing Gallo certainly does not do, it's make the
audience laugh.  Given the right material Griffin and Jones can be funny,
but one would never know that from the few amusing moments they are able
to create here.  Jones' more lively qualities are muted in the straight
man role, and the goofy Griffin is hardly convincing when called to do
gunblazing action, not to mention he's just hampered in general by the
PG-13 limitations.  He was a lot more effective in the misbegotten Master
P vehicle _Foolish_--a far worse film than _Double_Take_, mind you, but
at least there he wasn't required to rein in his more profane (and more
effective) comic instincts.
But a lack of joyous abandon is the least of _Double_Take_'s problems. 
So what is the greatest?  A writer-director with a half-baked script and
not the vaguest clue of how to bring it to life.

Title
Review for Instinct (1999)
        Jon Turteltaub has proven to be an effective popcorn director for
Disney: among his credits are 1995's irresistible Sandra Bullock-Bill
Pullman romantic charmer _While_You_Were_Sleeping_ and the pleasant 1996
John Travolta fantasy-drama _Phenomenon_.  Like many a popcorn filmmaker
before him, Turteltaub has apparently felt need to prove his dramatic
chops, hence his name at the helm of the psychological drama _Instinct_. 
But instead of coming up with something reminiscent of, say,
_The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_ (whose spirit Turteltaub clearly tries to
evoke) the soggy result is more along the manipulative lines of
_Patch_Adams_--which, coincidentally enough, was an attempt at a "heavy"
effort by "light" director Tom Shadyac.
The _Silence_ similarity shines through most brightly with the presence
of Anthony Hopkins, who plays another diagnosed psychotic in _Instinct_:
primatologist Ethan Powell, who returns to the United States from the
African wilds a silent, quick-tempered, animalistic murderer sentenced to
a prison for the criminally insane.  More shades of _Silence_ come in
when an ambitious youngster--in this case, psychiatrist Dr. Theo Caulder
(Cuba Gooding Jr.)--is called on to unlock Powell's brilliant but
disturbed mind.
If Turteltaub and scripter Gerald DiPego had left _Instinct_ that basic,
the film would not have been great, but it certainly would have been
better than it currently is.  Living up to their reputations as
Oscar-winning actors, neither Hopkins nor Gooding embarrass themselves,
delivering respectable performances and displaying a convincing rapport. 
What is embarrassing, however, is the amount of sappy manipulation
Turteltaub and DiPego slap onto this primary plotline.  Of course,
_Instinct_ is not only about Powell's mysterious African adventure but
also how he and Caulder change each other.  But it did it have to be
quite so maudlin, with Caulder delivering a histrionic "This Is How I've
Changed" monologue that also doubles as a teary farewell scene?
Perhaps that should not have been so surprising, since, contrary to
outward appearances, the film's main concern is not the divide between
man's animalistic and civilized nature but shameless tearwringing.  The
reality of Powell's time in Africa and the reasons for his change are
considerably less interesting than they promise to be; at the heart of it
is none other than the L-word, love--for a family of gorillas.  Also, the
_Patch_Adams_ comparison is actually quite apt, for one prominent subplot
deals with mistreatment of inmates at Powell's prison, led by a brutal
guard (John Ashton), who, in turn, is overseen by a hardass warden (John
Aylward) who won't hear of Caulder's ideas of gentler treatment.  One
pivotal scene where all the inmates finally take a stand for themselves
is every bit as gagworthy as _Patch_'s infamous hearing with the
red-nosed cancer kids.
After seeing the abomination that is _Instinct_, it is understandable
why Hopkins toyed with retirement from film acting; it is soulless
exercises in manipulation such as this that robs any of the enjoyment or
genuine excitement of  cinema.

Title
Review for Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)
I am not a "Trekker," so I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed the
last big-screen installment of the long-running film and television
franchise, 1996's _Star_Trek:_First_Contact_.  Delivering thrills and a
terrific adversary (the menacing Borg race) for general audiences to chew
on, and enough of the trademark techno-talk to appease the geekiest of
Trekkers, director/co-star Jonathan Frakes had his cake and ate it too.
After _First_Contact_'s critical and popular success, it comes as no
surprise that Paramount and _Trek_ producer Rick Berman tapped Frakes to
helm _Trek_ movie#9, but not even he can break this series from its curious
"even/odd" curse--that is, even-numbered installments = good, odd = bad (or
at least not good).  To be fair, Frakes's direction is not the problem with
_Insurrection_--it's the weak script by Michael Piller, from a story Piller
co-devised with Berman.  This time out, Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick
Stewart), Commander Will Riker (Frakes), android Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent
Spiner), Lt. Cmdr. Geordi LaForge (LeVar Burton), Dr. Beverly Crusher
(Gates McFadden), Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), and Michael Dorn's
Lt. Cmdr. Worf (again on loan from his current TV home on
_Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine_) commit the titular act of insurrection
against their higher-ups at the Federation when they set out to protect the
population of a peaceful planet from a maniacal, Federation-allied alien
(F. Murray Abraham) determined to harness the planet's power of granting
perpetual youth.
_Insurrection_ is a far cry from the violent, "Resistance is futile" Borg
antics of _First_Contact_ in terms of action, excitement, and,
unfortunately, interest--to non-Trekkers, that is.  A lot of the time is
spent on light character moments, such as Data bonding with a
technology-fearing young boy, Riker and Troi rekindling their romance, and
Worf re-experiencing Klingon puberty, thanks to the perpetual youth bug.
Trekkers will eat that stuff up; others will be looking elsewhere for
something engaging, which cannot be found in the by-the-numbers story or
the incredibly boring villain.  What they will ultimately fix their
attention on is the always-commanding presence of Stewart and the typically
polished effects and makeup work.  Aside from that, this subpar outing has
nothing to offer anyone outside of the _Trek_ faithful.

Title
Review for Snake Eyes (1998)
_Snake_Eyes_ is less a description of the film it titles than the manner
in which director Brian DePalma wields his camera--like a serpent,
slithering its way through the halls and over the walls of an Atlantic City
casino.   The title takes its cue from the differences in people's visual
perception from what really happens, and DePalma runs with the idea.  A
seamless 20-minute shot opens the film, following cop Rick Santoro (Nicolas
Cage) through the labyrinthian walkways of the casino's arena before and
during a championship boxing match.  Later, there's a flashback where a
subjective, point-of-view camera suddenly becomes objective without a
jarring break.  That's just one in a series of instances where DePalma uses
a subjective camera to enable the audience to see through characters' eyes,
which is a clever gimmick when assuming the fuzzy perspective of a woman
who has lost her glasses.  Then there's the use of a split screen to
document simultaneous action, a trick DePalma used to great effect in
_Dressed_to_Kill_.
I tend to meet a director's decision to juice up the visuals with a raised
eyebrow, for it generally signifies that he or she is trying to distract
the audience from a problematic script.  And that is certainly the case
with _Snake_Eyes_, a pro forma conspiracy whodunit written by David Koepp
from a story he devised with DePalma.  The U.S. Secretary of Defense is
assassinated during a boxing match, and out to solve the crime is Santoro,
along with best friend Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise, in a role originally
pegged for Will Smith), a Navy commander who was in charge of security.
Somehow figuring into the mystery is a mysterious blonde-wigged woman
(Carla Gugino) who took a seat in front of the Secretary seconds before the
shooting and caught a bullet herself.
DePalma guides the audience through overlapping flashbacks and a flurry of
plot points with a rapidly-paced yet clear-eyed finesse.  But craftsmanship
is all anyone will get a sense of, from the direction to the strong acting
by Sinise and especially Cage, who adds another oddball characterization to
his resume with the fast-talking, Hawaiian shirt-wearing, morally
questionable Santoro.  The twists are thoroughly predictable, but even if
any tension and suspense were generated, it would all be squandered by the
film's contrived fizzle of an anticlimax, which is not only disappointing
but makes little sense.
For all its metaphoric meanings, the title _Snake_Eyes_ is derived from a
line of dialogue.  One character tells another, "You have nothing.  Snake
eyes."  With his bottomless bag of stylish visual tricks, DePalma does have
"something" to offer in _Snake_Eyes_, but, ironically, it is that
"something" that points up just how much "nothing" lies underneath.

Title
Review for Fallen (1998)
January is known as a cinematic wasteland, a dumping ground where studios
to unload the dreck they've been hiding in the dark corners of their
shelves.  So it's quite refreshing to see premiering in the first month of
the year a film with some degree of intelligence such as Gregory Hoblit's
Fallen.  While the basic ideas behind this supernatural thriller remain
more intriguing than their development and execution, Fallen is nonetheless
an effective chiller that entertains and leaves audiences plenty to think
about.
The setup as shown in the film's previews is deceptively simple.  The
execution of serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas, picking up where he
left off in Crash) does not spell the end of his conflict with idealistic
homicide detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington).  Apparently, the
execution has only freed his evil spirit to inhabit other bodies to do his
sadistic bidding, passing from vessel to vessel through mere touch.
As the film progresses, it is revealed that the force that Hobbes must now
confront is much larger than expected, and this is where Fallen becomes
deeper and more intriguing than most fright shows.  Interesting points
about theology and the nature of evil are brought up by screenwriter
Nicholas Kazan and director Hoblit, who enable the audience to suspend
their disbelief by giving it time to digest the supernatural occurrences
and explanations after they are served up a little at a time (though Hoblit
allows the viewers a bit _too_much_ time--the film's pacing should have
been much tighter).  However, this is also where Fallen runs into some
trouble, for a few points are not resolved to satisfaction.  For instance,
it is never satisfactorily explained why the spirit can easily enter some
people and not others; "purity of soul" is offered as a reason, but what
exactly distinguishes that?
But these quibbles can be swept under the rug, due to Hoblit's stylish
direction and, most of all, the presence of the ever-charismatic and
convincing Washington.  He has such a natural rapport with the audience
that we instantly believe what he does, and when he is finally convinced of
what exactly is going on, we have no problem accepting the situation,
either.  His supporting cast, which includes John Goodman (as Hobbes's
partner, Jonesy) and Donald Sutherland (as their superior), isn't given a
whole lot to do (Embeth Davidtz, as a theologan who helps Hobbes, plays
merely a walking vessel of exposition).
Fallen is a flawed film, but it at least requires the viewer to think,
especially after the jolting conclusion.  That's a lot more than most
January releases have to offer; then again, I'd venture to guess that
that's a lot more than what most releases this entire year will have to offer.

Title
Review for Big Lebowski, The (1998)
Leave it to the Coen brothers to use a man urinating on a rug as the
catalyst for an entire film's events.  No, an Oscar win and wide-spanning
critical acclaim has not put a mainstreaming damper on the reckless
imagination of bros Joel and Ethan, who have made an instant cult hit with
their warped but hilarious comedy-thriller, The Big Lebowski.
Said urinating man is a thug out to collect a debt owed by Bunny Lebowski
(Tara Reid), young trophy wife to Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston),
wheelchair-bound Pasadena millionaire.  The problem is, he urinates on the
rug of the _wrong_ Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), a.k.a. "the Dude," a
lazy loser who wastes his days drinking and bowling with his buddies Walter
Sobchak (John Goodman), a short-tempered Vietnam vet; and Donny (Steve
Buscemi), a slow-witted ex-surfer.  When the Dude attempts to receive
compensation for his soiled rug from "the Big Lebowski," he sets off an
outrageous chain of events that involves everything from kidnapping,
ransom, double crosses, and pornography to a writer for the vintage TV
western Branded, a gang of German nihilists, and their lethal pet marmot.
Needless to say, The Big Lebowski's story is intricate, out-there, and
distinctly Coenesque; it is just about impossible to sum it up in a single
sentence.  While the Coens' unpredictable, ridiculously complex, and
consistently funny plotline is one of the film's greatest virtues, the most
pleasures lie with the cast of colorful characters.  Standing first and
foremost is the easily excitable Walter, prone to violent outbursts and
suspicious of just about everyone. Goodman, in the film's standout
performance, brings him to life with appropriate bluster without going too
far; he's a blowhard, but he's a very loyal and helpful one, and as such we
understand why anyone would want to be his friend.  Making their marks on a
smaller scale are Julianne Moore, who continues to shine as the perpetually
robe-clad Maude, the Big Lebowski's sophisticated feminist artist daughter;
John Turturro as flamboyant bowling adversary Jesus (_not_ pronounced the
Spanish way) Quintana; Philip Seymour Hoffman as the Big Lebowski's geeky
assistant; and Buscemi, who is endearing, if underused, as the
mild-mannered link in the Dude-Walter-Donny trio.
But what about the Dude?  Out of the odd array of characters in The Big
Lebowski, he is by far the least interesting.  Sure, he's a layabout; he
pays grocery bills for 69 cents by check; he likes drinking White Russians
and smoking a joint here and there; he always looks like he just got of
bed; he loves Creedence Clearwater Revival; and he has vivid fantasies
involving bowling, including one elaborate Busby Berkeley-style musical
number complete with dancers wearing bowling pin headdresses.  He's
certainly not a conventional mystery "investigator" hero, and Bridges
manages to make the slob likable, but he's a downright bore compared to,
say, the vibrantly boorish Walter or even cameo characters such as a giddy
art world contemporary of Maude's played by David Thewlis.
To call The Big Lebowski "strange" or "quirky" would be an understatement;
at times it's flat-out weird.  Its unconventionality (another
understatement) is sure to leave many a moviegoer perplexed, but that's
exactly what makes the film such a fresh and imaginative piece of
entertainment.  (opens March 6)

Title
Review for Dirty Work (1998)
_Dirty_Work_ has a premise of deliciously mean-spirited
potential. Mitch Weaver (Norm Macdonald) and his lifelong best friend
Sam McKenna (Artie Lange) are losers in life: they were constantly
picked on in school, and now they cannot hold regular jobs.  But as
the trailer goes, "There is one thing Mitch Weaver is good
at--revenge."  So he and Sam parlay their unmatched skill in
getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business
called Dirty Work Inc.
This should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy,
but for a film called _Dirty_Work_, what ensues is rather clean of
spirit.  In fact, what makes Mitch and Sam start up their business is
not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine, but
rather a more sappy reason: Sam's father (Jack Warden) needs a heart
transplant, and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient
list, his compulsively betting doctor (Chevy Chase) asks the guys for
$50,000 to pay off his bookie.  So for all the scheming that goes on,
beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp!--a heart, which undercuts the
inherent nastiness of the premise.
Not that there isn't a lot of nastiness on display--there is, but of a
different sort.  There are frequent sexual references, most
prominently in the form of prostitutes and Sam's impotent father's
ongoing lust for them.  And for a film rated PG-13, director Bob Saget
(yes, that Bob Saget, of _Full_House_ and
_America's_Funniest_Home_Videos_ fame) and writers Frank Sebastiano,
Fred Wolf, and Macdonald himself, stretch the boundaries of good taste
rather far--arguably a bit too much so (was not one, but two separate
instances of sodomy between animals really necessary?).  But the
issue, of course, is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in, is it
funny or not? The answer is a resounding no.
It's not that Macdonald isn't a funny guy.  He was one of the more
consistently funny performers on _Saturday_Night_Live_ before his
much-talked-about firing, and his dry brand of smartass wit translates
well to the big screen; it also doesn't hurt that he's a natural,
likable screen presence.  He is able to give some of his lines a nice
acid touch, but, for the most part, the oneliners, as written, are
flat, and the broad slapstick gags just don't work (one running gag
has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot). Still,
Macdonald's few shining moments are just about the only moments the
film has. The late Chris Farley, as hysterical as he ever was, is
amusing in a cameo role, but, as a whole, the supporting players are
amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance.
Saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by Gary
Coleman, Adam Sandler, and John Goodman, but their minimal novelty
value cannot prevent _Dirty_Work_ from sputtering to the end of its
brief 81-minute running time.  The film closes on a sad note of
desperation, an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those
involved in the production would derive any amusement.  Come to think
of it, I cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to
find much amusement in the entirety of _Dirty_Work_.

Title
Review for Castle, The (1997/I)
  Although Roger Ebert has called it "this year's _Full_Monty_," I'm not
entirely certain that this Australian import will connect with American
audiences like that flashy British sensation of two summers ago.  In fact,
the comparison is entirely unfair, for this lower-key, character-driven
comedy is, for my money, better than that overrated fluke Best Picture
nominee.  The castle in question is the Kerrigan house, a modest abode
situated next to the runway of an airport and underneath a bundle of power
lines.  When a proposed airport expansion threatens to claim his happy home
and those of his neighbors, patriarch Darryl (Michael Caton) dares to take
his case to court.
To be honest, this simple and straightforward "little guy versus the
system" tale does not pack too many gutbusting laughs.  In their place are
smaller but ultimately more rewarding delights: a consistent stream of
giggle-worthy lines and situations and, best of all, a wide variety of
sharply defined personalities.  Proud and loving Darryl is indeed the main
character (played without a single false note by Caton), but the rest of
the Kerrigan family and the other peripheral characters are allowed to
carve out their own memorably quirky niches.  Making the strongest
impressions are Darryl's trading post-obsessed, "ideas man" middle son
Steve (Anthony Simcoe) and Darryl's incompetent lawyer (Tiriel Mora).
_The_Castle_ is as light and disposable as it appears to be, but there's no
denying how efficient (the film runs a scant 89 minutes), crowdpleasing,
and heartwarming an entertainment director Rob Sitch and writing
collaborators Santo Cilauro, Tom Cleisner, and Jane Kennedy have created.

Review for Orgazmo (1997)
I am not a fan of _South_Park_--never have been, likely never will be.  So
I was surprised to find myself laughing during the early moments of this
big screen comedy written, directed, and starring the popular adult
animated series's co-creator (with Matt Stone, who also has a small role
here), Trey Parker.  He plays Joe Young, an innocent door-to-door Mormon
preacher who unwittingly finds himself an adult film superstar after
naively agreeing to play the title role in a pornographic superhero flick
called _Orgazmo_.
But as amusing as the setup and a few jokes (an old lady's F-word-ridden
tirade about Mormons, a title card reading "Hollywood" appearing on a shot
of the Hollywood sign) are, recurring gags that initially garner a giggle
wear thin fast.  An ebonics-spouting Asian sushi bar owner named G-Fresh
(Masao San) is funny the first time we see him, the joke grows old with
each subsequent appearance.  The same can be said for the knowingly cheesy
chopsocky action scenes and Orgazmo sidekick Choda-Boy's (Dian Bachar) vast
array of dildo-derived gadgets.  (The pervasive presence of sex toys
undoubtedly factored in the MPAA's decision to brand this crude but quite
tame film with an overly restrictive NC-17 rating.)  Before long, the
entirety of the film follows suit, straining to fill the rest of its slim
90-minute running time with a dull subplot in which Joe must fight off some
heavies harassing G-Fresh.
What is consistently funny, however, are the songs on soundtrack.  The
Parker-penned opening theme, "Now You're a Man," is a hilarious parody of
"macho" hard rock ("What makes a man?/Is it the woman in his hands/Just
'cause she has big titties?").  Even better is the closing tune, a bossa
nova groove that is quite seductive... until it gets to the hilariously
absurd title lyric, which is repeated ad nauseum in the chorus: "Sorry
about your penis."

Title
Review for Beach, The (2000)
After the global phenomenon that was _Titanic_, Leonardo DiCaprio truly
was the "King of the World" (sorry, James Cameron), having the newfound
power to choose whatever follow-up project he wanted--and at any price. 
But much like his co-star Kate Winslet, DiCaprio has shunned obvious
blockbuster efforts and instead opted for more uncommercial works--such
as Woody Allen's _Celebrity_ and now _The_Beach_, a stylish and
unconventional drama that certainly won't earn him much favor with his
fanbase of screaming teenage girls.
That demographic may appreciate the fact that _The_Beach_ gives the
twentysomething DiCaprio ample opportunity to show off his shockingly
pre-pubescent physique.  Such flesh-baring may lead one to think that
Danny Boyle's adaptation of Alex Garland's novel is a glamour project,
but it isn't.  In fact, I don't think that young female audience will
otherwise find much interest with the fairly dark story of DiCaprio's
Richard, an American on vacation in Thailand, who sets out to find a
legendary island paradise along with a French couple (Virginie Ledoyen
and Guillaume Canet).  They succeed, only to find a secret society led by
the mysterious Sal (Tilda Swinton), who, after some initial trepidation,
welcomes the newcomers into the exclusive and self-sufficient community,
which is sort of a perpetual beach resort.
The message of _The_Beach_ does not take long to come clear; it is
rather obvious that reality will ultimately creep in and shatter the
delusion of such a utopian lifestyle.  The romantic subplot, involving
Richard and Ledoyen's Françoise, never really catches fire.  That fact is
partly due to the screenplay by longtime Boyle collaborator John Hodge,
which doesn't quite establish strong character foundations on the page,
hence making some of Richard's late character turns feel arbitrary.
However, _The_Beach_ is a less a film about its narrative than its
style, and as he has in the past (excepting his last film, the
disastrous-on-all-levels _A_Life_Less_Ordinary_), Boyle is able to engage
the audience with his style when the script falters.  His forays into
surrealism are especially inspired, such as a strange scene where
Richard's jungle adventures literally turn into a video game.  This scene
was met with much derisive laughter from the audience with whom I saw the
film, but it is actually a rather inventive way to show how immaturely
and lightly he takes such a real and serious situation.  Boyle is ably
supported by cinematographer Darius Khondji, who makes the beach as
impossibly beautiful as it should be.
Adding immeasurably to _The_Beach_'s watchability is, indeed, DiCaprio. 
His teen idol status may be the primary reason he gets so much ink in the
press now, but his talent will keep his name in the memory for years to
come.   _The_Beach_ is certain to fail at the box office (I can see the
headlines now--"Leo's Post-_Titanic_ Bellyflop"), but it further proves
DiCaprio to be an interesting and boldly risk-taking actor--even if the
risks don't always completely pay off.

Title
Review for Outside Providence (1999)
Ever hear ssomeone tell supposedly amusing tales of their childhood and
adolescence that seem only to hold the slightest bit of interest to the
person telling the story?  That's the sense I felt while watching
_Outside_Providence_, based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Peter
Farrelly.  Yes, that's Peter as in Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the warped
minds behind the likes of _Kingpin_ and _There's_Something_About_Mary_. 
But anyone looking for their brand of grossout humor will be disappointed
by the wistful _Providence_, scripted by the brothers and director
Michael Corrente.  Then again, anything looking for humor, period, will
be disappointed, for the film is strangely devoid of laughs.
_Providence_ is set in 1974, when teen Tim Dunphy's (Shawn Hatosy)
aimless, pot-fueled antics leads his father (Alec Baldwin) to ship him
from their home of Pawtucket, New Jersey, to Cornwall Academy, a stuffy
prep school in Connecticut.  A fish-out-of-water scenario where all
manner of hilarity should ensue, but what unfolds is bizarrely lifeless
and often simply boring, with Tim regularly running afoul of an uptight
headmaster (Tim Crowe) when not running after Jane (Amy Smart), a
fetching student at the girls' school.  Every so often Corrente cuts to a
scene back in Pawtucket, usually with Old Man Dunphy playing poker with
pals.  It's as exciting as it sounds.
The actors playing the only two recognizable characters are the only
thing that holds interest in the film, aside from Corrente's keen eye for
period detail.  Baldwin does an admirable job of disappearing into his
character, obviously wearing a few (to say the least) more pounds than
usual and speaking in a very convincing Jersey accent.  But there's more
to his performance than a mere physical transformation; Baldwin infuses
the macho blowhard with a palpable warmth.  Not as showy is the work of
Hatosy, who has a natural, understated ease about him that makes slacker
Tim more likable than he otherwise would be (as played by another actor,
he probably wouldn't be at all).
A more compelling semi-autobiographical tale of adolescence can be found
in _West_Beirut_, written and directed by Ziad Doueiri.  The film indeed
is set in Lebanon in the late '70s to early '80s, when civil war divided
the country and split the city of Beirut into a Christian-run East and a
Muslim-run West; against this backdrop, we see the development of young
Tarek (Rami Doueiri), Omar (Mohamad Chamas), and their Christian friend
May (Rola Al Amin), as well as the effects the unrest has on Tarek's
parents (Carmen Lebbos and Joseph Bou Nassar).  Despite more than a few
serious turns of events, there are plenty of moments of humor as the
teens simply go about their business of having fun, learning about life,
and growing up as any others would in any corner of the globe.  Paying no
mind to the setting and situational differences, _West_Beirut_ is more
effective a film semi-memoir than _Outside_Providence_ for one simple
reason--it actually feels like a story worth telling.

Title
Review for Patch Adams (1998)
_Patch_Adams_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
_Patch_Adams_ tells the true story of an American original: Hunter
"Patch" Adams (here played by Robin Williams), a former mental patient
turned doctor who pioneered a philosophy of treating patients with a
strong prescription of humor. 
However, the film itself is far from original, following an all-too
familiar checklist for assembly-line "heartwarming human comedy-drama." 
Williams breaks absolutely no new ground playing a goofy guy who is
really brilliant but _misunderstood_.  Check.  He bucks convention and
draws the ire of a sternly traditional authority figure (Bob Gunton's med
school dean).  Check.  The hero takes a liking to an icy young lady
(Monica Potter) initially turned off by our lovable eccentric but
eventually comes around.  Check.  An arbitrary and completely predictable
tragedy causes the  confident hero to question his beliefs and abilities.
 Check.  Friends tell him how special he is, but our hero only finds new
inspiration after receiving an apparent sign from a divine source. 
Check.  The hero then faces the authority figure and wins.  Check.
As if the by-the-letter formula of _Patch_Adams_ weren't bad enough,
writer Steve Oedekerk and director Tom Shadyac (yes, they of
_Ace_Ventura_ infamy) drown the proceedings in a sea of schmaltz that is
even more insulting than it is nauseating.  Patch's tear-wringing
monologue at a climactic hearing is sappy enough, but was it really
necessary to follow that with a group of cancer-stricken youths donning
red noses in support?  It's enough to make anyone gag--that is, if they
don't go into insulin shock first.

Title
Review for Jui kuen II (1994)
_The_Legend_of_Drunken_Master_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
At long last, the American masses will get a glimpse of what Jackie Chan
can really do with the long-overdue wide release of his classic 1994 Hong
Kong production _Drunken_Master_II_, rechristened by Miramax as
_The_Legend_of_Drunken_Master_.  Considered by many Chan fans (including
myself) as the star's crowning achievement, _Drunken_Master_ compensates
for what it lacks in plot with hearty laughs and truly spectacular action
sequences--which still pack the same punch in this re-edited edition.
_Drunken_Master_, like all of Chan's Hong Kong efforts, has a plot that
is functional at best.  Chan plays Wong Fei-Hung (a character popularized
by the other HK martial arts superstar, Jet Li, in the
_Once_Upon_a_Time_in_China_ series), son of a doctor (Ti Lung) in
early-1900s China.  A master of the self-explanatory "drunken boxing"
style of martial arts, his skills come in handy when he inadvertently
stumbles upon a British scheme to steal Chinese artifacts.
A Chan film wouldn't be complete without comedy, and while he does some
great physical gags that emerge from the action scenes, the best comic
moments do not come from Chan but co-star Anita Mui.  A movie and music
sensation in Hong Kong--not to mention frequent Chan co-star--Mui is an
absolute riot as Fei-Hung's stepmother (a most welcome revision from the
original version, in which the visibly younger Mui played Chan's
biological parent).  As adept at tossing off verbal barbs as she is
selling broad slapstick that in lesser hands would be simply
preposterous, Mui has expert timing and darn near walks away with the
picture.  Thankfully, the surprisingly passable dubbing job does no
disservice to her work; likewise, neither does Miramax's subtle retooling
desecrate the Hong Kong cut: simple main titles as opposed to the lavish
credit sequences that are usually tacked on; a new score that actually
retains a strong Asian flavor; the wise excising of the original's
ludicrous coda.
Keeping Chan in full command of the film, however, is his amazing
fighting skill, which has never been showcased quite as well as it is
here.  Chan's Hollywood productions and his HK reissues tend to have a
big showpiece stunt, like the big fall he takes at the end of
_Rush_Hour_.  _Drunken_Master_, on the other hand, is a pure showcase for
his raw martial arts ability, which proves more dazzling than any huge
death-defying stunt could ever be (though, of course, said fighting is
dangerous in its own right).  From the exciting first fight--a
sword/spear battle that starts under a train--to the awesomely
choreographed, expertly staged final confrontation with a baddie played
by Ken Lo (Chan's real-life bodyguard), _Drunken_Master_ delivers action
goods that are sure to leave everyone absolutely breathless.
That is, everyone who shows up at the theatre--which, sadly, will likely
be a small group.  Thanks to some curious release choices
(_Twin_Dragons_?), reissues of Chan's HK work have suffered a steady
decline at the box office.  It's utterly baffling that Miramax waited so
long to release _Drunken_Master_; if released four years earlier to
capitalize on the heat of his spring 1996 breakthrough,
_Rumble_in_the_Bronx_, it would have surely sent Chan's stateside status
skyrocketing beyond the mid-level stardom he currently enjoys.   But if
there's any justice, the ever-dazzling _Drunken_Master_ should reverse
the trend of diminishing returns--if even for just this one film.

Title
Review for U.S. Marshals (1998)
U.S. Marshals (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
Sequels to popular action films are difficult to pull off as they are, and
the odds are further stacked against them when (1) the original hero is
nowhere to be found, and (2) the original was embraced by critics.  This
fact--and the failure of last year's tangentially related, critically
lambasted sequel to Speed--makes the effectiveness of U.S. Marshals all the
more surprising.  An ostensible sequel to the Best Picture-nominated The
Fugitive, the new film spins off Dr. Richard Kimble's determined pursuer,
federal cop Samuel Gerard, in an entertaining adventure that could very
well lead to a successful franchise.
Tommy Lee Jones, who won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his
performance in The Fugitive, once again plays Gerard, reinhabiting the role
with the same infectious gusto and zeal he brought to the original.  Once
again, Gerard, this time reluctantly teamed with government special agent
Royce (Robert Downey Jr.), is chasing after a fugitive, an assassin (Wesley
Snipes) known at various points as either Mark Roberts, Mark Warren, or
Mark Sheridan.  Sheridan (as which I will refer to him) had been imprisoned
for the murder of two government agents, and, with the help of his dutiful
girlfriend Marie (Irene Jacob), he attempts to elude the ever-focused
Gerard and--yes--clear his name.
Director Stuart Baird and screenwriter John Pogue follows The Fugitive's
rough outline fairly closely, and a couple of scenes are direct analogues
to ones in the original.  In a spectacular scene, Sheridan makes his escape
after a plane crash, much like the original film's signature train wreck;
and one memorably outlandish stunt echoes Kimble's daring leap from a dam.
As a whole, though, the new film does not nearly measure up to the
original.  Snipes, as usual, is charismatic and plays his role well, but
his character is not as fascinating and complex as Harrison Ford's Kimble.
Sheridan has none of the emotional baggage that shaded Kimble; he simply
wants, as he calls it, "righteousness."  Kimble, on the other hand, was
continually racked with guilt over his wife's death.  The emotional angle
between Sheridan and Marie is a big zero; Snipes and Jacob muster little
chemistry, but that is due in part to the fact that they do not share too
many scenes.
On its own terms, though, the diverting U.S. Marshals makes for a
promising "pilot" for a potential Gerard series.  Jones is obviously
energized by the more physical role Gerard plays in this installment, and
while his pacing is not as tightly wound as that of Andrew Davis, the
original's helmer, Baird crafts some suspenseful and exciting chase scenes
without resorting to gratuitous bloodshed.  A few climactic plot
developments are a bit contrived, but Baird and the able cast glide through
them with enough panache that they are not a problem.  Slick, well-made,
and fun--The Fugitive was all this and much more, but even without that
something extra, U.S. Marshals gets the job done.

Review for October Sky (1999)
To a certain extent, Joe Johnston's fact-based film is every bit the piece
of manipulation its advertising suggests.  In 1957, after seeing the Soviet
satellite Sputnik traverse the October sky (we have a title!), young Homer
Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and a group of fairly nondescript friends (with
the exception of ubergeek Quentin, played by Chris Owen) is inspired to
take up rocket science.  The problem is, he's just a kid in a small West
Virginia coal mining town (aptly named Coalwood), and his father (Chris
Cooper), who runs the mine, wants nothing more than for Homer to follow the
family and town tradition of mining.
Lewis Colick's script goes through familiar paces: Homer runs into a
series of obstacles in pursuing his dream, but he keeps at it, egged on by
a kindhearted teacher (Laura Dern) and others.  But as manipulative as the
film is whenever the proceedings threaten to degenerate into treacle,
Johnston pulls back; as such, the unforced and honest power of the emotion
ever so quietly sneaks up on you by film's end.  This understatement and
sensitivity extends to the actors, especially Gyllenhaal, one of the rare
young newcomers who actually displays some real promise.

Title
Review for Replacement Killers, The (1998)
Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat is a living legend, and it's about time
that mainstream America found out.  The ever-charismatic Chow will
certainly have no trouble winning new fans with his English language debut,
Antoine Fuqua's brisk, explosive The Replacement Killers.
In comparison to the dark, complex collaborations with John Woo (who
executive produced) that made Chow an international superstar, Replacement
is not exactly the sturdiest of vehicles.  The entire storyline of Ken
Sanzel's thin script can be summed up by its title.  Chow plays John Lee, a
hitman who wants out of a contract with his mob boss employer (Kenneth
Tsang), who hence dispatches "replacements" to kill him and his ally, a
document forger named Meg Coburn (a game Mira Sorvino, running around in an
open shirt).
The plot is just the glue that holds together what is essentially one long
series of wildly choreographed gunfights, which is far from a bad thing.
Fuqua, whose slick style is best described as a cross between Michael Bay
and (of course) Woo, wisely lets Chow be Chow--in other words, do all the
things that makes him the coolest actor around.  Throughout the film, I
found myself breathing sighs of relief as the outrageous derring-do from
the Chow I know and love appeared onscreen--sliding on floors, flying
through the air, rolling around and flipping, firing from each hand.  Early
on, though, Fuqua makes a serious miscalculation by having Chow hold a gun
with both hands (believe it or not, Columbia Pictures reportedly brought in
someone to teach trigger-happy Chow how to shoot a gun), and his discomfort
is obvious.  But there is only one scene where he does so, and soon after
Chow is allowed to ease into his normal routine.
As well as Chow is serviced by The Replacement Killers, it still only
scratches the surface of his talent.  His dour role erases all traces of
his appealing sense of humor; Fuqua, perhaps caught up in his reverence for
the man, takes Chow's character a bit _too_ seriously, sometimes eliciting
an odd chuckle from the audience.   And the depth of his dramatic range is
only hinted at in the silent, subtly acted scene where Lee cannot go
through with what is to be his last hit. But I suppose all depth will
have to be reserved for when Chow reunites with Woo (which he is slated to
do in the forthcoming action comedy King's Ransom).  Until then,
Replacement will do.  It delivers all the mayhem and thrills one would
want--and expect--from a popcorn action film and serves as a perfectly
adequate American introduction to the living legend that is Chow Yun-Fat.

Title
Review for Real Blonde, The (1997)
The Real Blonde (R) 1/2* (out of ****)
        A woman's face, an arm, some pumped-up pectorals, blond hair, a man's sad
face, slender legs, a random hand here and there.  As the opening credits
of Tom DiCillo's The Real Blonde unfold, these scattered, fractured
glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief-clad
man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman, his head concealing her
unclothed breasts.  If only the rest of this formless, aimless ensemble
comedy assembled so coherently.
        Joe (Matthew Modine) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs
in commercials or soap operas.  He's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his
relationship with his live-in love, Mary (Catherine Keener), who holds some
subconscious hostility toward the male gender.  Mary, a makeup artist,
regularly works on model Sahara (Bridgette Wilson), who is obsessed with
the underlying messages in Disney's The Little Mermaid.  The bottle blonde
has a turbulent on-again, off-again relationship with Bob (Maxwell
Caulfield), a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde, which
he finds in co-star Kelly (Daryl Hannah).  As the film unspools, a variety
of other characters pass through: fashion photographer Blair (Marlo
Thomas); Mary's shrink (Buck Henry) and self-defense instructor (Denis
Leary); Joe's casting agent (Kathleen Turner) and hardass boss (Christopher
Lloyd); and a mystery woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who keeps on crossing Joe's
path.
        Where exactly does all this go?  That's a question best posed to
writer-director DiCillo, who doesn't appear to have the slightest clue
himself.  His meandering, largely unfunny script and direction are like
hopelessly lost drivers, turning into dead-end narrative streets only to
reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac.  And another.  And
another.  At one point Bob, frustrated with the soap scripts, complains to
the head writer (Jim Fyfe) that his and Kelly's characters keep on going in
circles, with no hint of development or growth.  That is most certainly the
case here.  Joe gets a job and ultimately botches things; he and Mary
bicker; they make up, only to have the pattern repeat itself.  Unhappy with
his bottle blonde, Bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied; he returns
to the faux and is still unsatisfied.  If there is a point to all of this,
DiCillo dances around it, spending his time on apparent digressions that,
as it turns out, aren't digressions at all.
        The Real Blonde is not without some amusements.   It does have the
occasional funny line and situation; Leary, Henry, Lloyd, Steve Buscemi,
and Dave Chappelle shine in their small roles; Keener is a likable,
refreshingly earthy lead; Berkley's appearance is mercifully brief (she
receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute
role); and there is the irony of having Caulfield play a wildly popular
soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket (last year, the actor was fired
from the daytime drama All My Children after a scant six months--due to
lack of viewer interest).  But on the whole, The Real Blonde is a
frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be
glossy on the surface, but there's nothing going on inside.  (opens

Title
Review for Sleepers (1996)
Sleepers (R) ***
        Based on a true story or not, Barry Levinson's adaptation of Lorenzo
Carcaterra's best-selling novel is a perfectly competent Hollywood revenge
fantasy.  The problem is, the film is not quite as great as it thinks it is.
        This story of "friendship that runs deeper than blood" opens in
Hell's Kitchen in the late 1960s, where we meet a group of four young boys,
Michael (Brad Renfro), Tommy (Jonathan Tucker), John (Geoffrey Wigdor), and
the author himself, Lorenzo, a.k.a. Shakes (Joseph Perrino).  These
troublemaking but well-meaning kids get more than they bargained for when a
prank goes awry and they land in a hellish boys' reform school, where they
are treated to violent physical and sexual abuse by four of the guards, led
by one nasty fellow by the name of Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon).
        After the kids finish their sentence, the film flashes forward to
1981, where the film's problems begin. The four guys have now just about
gone their separate ways and lost touch with each other--is this what you
call a "friendship that runs deeper than blood"?  John (former ER recurrent
Ron Eldard) and Tommy (Billy Crudup) are now bigtime hoodlums, and, in a
fortuitous coincidence, they run into and fatally shoot Nokes in a
restaurant.  Enter Michael (Brad Pitt), who is now a New York assistant DA,
who agrees to prosecute the case against John and Tommy--and, unbeknownst to
this two childhood friends, plans to intentionally throw the case to let the
two off and have their revenge.  Helping in the elaborate revenge scheme is,
yes, Shakes (Jason Patric), now a clerk for the New York Times, who also
engineers the downfall of their other three tormentors at the school.
        I suppose it goes without saying that all works out in the end--but,
of course, not without an easily overcome glitch or two.  And those seeking
a glossy revenge tale in which the baddies get their just desserts won't be
disappointed with Sleepers; well-acted and smoothly directed, it gets the
job done... but only on those terms.  Watching the film I could not help but
feel other grandiose intentions at work, ambitions that weren't quite met.
The impressive cast (which also includes Robert DeNiro as the kids' priest
and a hilarious Dustin Hoffman as John and Tommy's alcoholic, drug-addicted
defense attorney), John Williams's shockingly understated and somber score,
and Patric's flat, pretentious voiceover narration ("Hell's Kitchen is a
place of innocence ruled by corruption") suggests a big Oscar-worthy tale.
But it isn't, at least not in this critic's opinion.  The "true" story
relies too heavily on contrived coincidences and, worst of all, shortchanges
major characters.  Despite their role in killing Nokes, John and Tommy are
virtually invisible in the second half; never do we get a glimpse of insight
as to what they are feeling during the trial, seeing their friend "trying"
to put them away.  It is quite obvious why director-scripter Levinson
focused on matinee idols Pitt and Patric, but their side of the story is
perhaps the least interesting.  Also, DeNiro's character is called on to
make a major ethical and religious choice, and we never really get a sense
as to why and how he arrives at his ultimate decision; it just happens.
        As mentioned before, the cast, to varying degrees, does a good job.
Top honors go to DeNiro, Hoffman, Perrino, and Minnie Driver as the four's
pal.  Bacon exudes appropriate menace in the one-note role of Nokes.  Patric
and Pitt are adequate, but they, Patric especially, suffer from accent
inconsistencies.  Perrino has a very thick New York accent, and Patric
barely makes an effort to use one; while time has passed, I doubt that a boy
with that thick of an accent could shake it off so completely no matter
where he lived or whatever speech coach he may have had.  The only star
whose accent is in line with his or her younger counterpart is Driver, whose
very convincing accent comes as somewhat of a surprise, considering her
natural British lilt.  Eldard and Crudup don't make enough of an impression
because they are called on to do so little.  Crudup has been hailed along
with the likes of That Thing You Do!'s Johnathon Schaech as a Hollywood "it"
boy, a superstar of tomorrow; based on his limited work here, it is hard to
see how that buzz originated.
        It may appear as if I didn't enjoy Sleepers, but I did; I got caught
up in the story and the characters.  But this good film had the potential to
be a great film, a true Oscar contender that, alas, didn't quite make it to
the screen.

Title
Review for Gun Shy (2000)
Sandra Bullock co-stars and produces; Liam Neeson, whose recognition is
at an all-time high thanks to a certain sci-fi prequel, is the lead;
character actor extraordinaire Oliver Platt plays Neeson's foil.  An
impressive assemblage of talent headlines _Gun_Shy_, yet Buena Vista is
only giving the film an initial regional release.  It could be argued
that the comedy's unconventional nature factored into that decision, but
a more convincing argument would be that the film simply falls far short
of its ambitions.
Neeson, in a rare comic role, gamely but awkwardly plays Charlie Mayo, a
deep cover DEA agent whose legendary toughness has been broken after one
particularly traumatic failed sting.  Even so, he is assigned to bust
mafia hitman Fulvio Nesstra (Oliver Platt) and Colombian drug dealer
Fidel Vaillar (Jose Zuniga) in a complex money laundering scheme.  The
newly-spineless Charlie is deathly afraid of the famously hot-tempered
Fulvio, but behind his cold stare hides someone decidedly less vicious.
Writer-director Eric Blakeney was obviously shooting for something along
the lines of a previous Buena Vista release, _Grosse_Pointe_Blank_: a bit
of the madcap tinged with a bit of the dark.  The difference is that
while the makers of that film aimed for smart, ironic humor, Blakeney
contents himself with cheap physical and bodily function gags.  Fidel's
associate Estuvio (Michael DeLorenzo) gets a testicle shot off and walks
strange for the rest of the film.  An even more tiresome running gag is
Charlie's stress-related illness; he cannot control his bowels, so every
so often we hear his stomach grumble and see him run to toilets--not
exactly what I'd call hilarious.
Charlie's health is what leads him to meet Judy Tipp (Bullock), a nurse
for whom he quickly falls.  This romantic angle never feels of a piece
with the rest of _Gun_Shy_, and the blame falls largely on Bullock.  She
is an easily likable actress, and she looks beautiful throughout the
film, but she isn't right for the part.  Not only does she have no
chemistry with Neeson, she is a bit too generically sunny to belong in
this darker world.  Blakeney also holds some blame, for Judy isn't a very
interesting character to begin with; she's just the token love interest.
In fact, the only truly interesting--and truly funny--characters in
_Gun_Shy_ are the henpecked Fulvio, played marvelously by Platt, and his
tough cookie wife, Gloria, played by a scene-stealing and unrecognizable
Mary McCormack.  One wishes that Blakeney had written a film that focused
squarely on them, for Charlie's story and the half-hearted mystery
revolving around who's really behind the shady deals never catches fire. 
Platt and McCormack ignite from the start, and one gets the sense that
_Gun_Shy_ would have had they been the main characters.

Title
Review for Barney's Great Adventure (1998)
"I hate you/You hate me/Let's hang Barney from a tree." Count me among
the many who simply cannot stand the Jesus Christ of kids'
contemporary pop culture icons, Barney the dinosaur. As I walked into
the child-packed auditorium for a matinee showing of the dino's
big-screen splash, Barney's Great Adventure--The Movie, I took a deep
breath in preparation for what I knew would be a descent into
cinematic hell.  And that it was--at least for someone my age.
The ostensible story involves two young siblings, Cody (Trevor Morgan)
and Abby (Diana Rice), who are sent to their grandparents' farm home
for a week. Abby and her (token African-American) friend Marcella
(Kyla Pratt) are big Barney fans and devout followers of his gospel of
imagination; stick-in-the-mud Cody hates doing "child-like" things and
despises the dino. Before you can say "PBS," Abby and Marcella's
stuffed Barney has come to full-size life, trying to instill some good
ol' child-like imagination in Cody, who then wishes upon a star for a
great adventure--which he gets, courtesy of a large, psychedelic egg
of extraterrestrial origin that just won't stay in one place.
Of course, Barney can't go long without singing a song. His first
appearance comes with a tune called "Imagine," and moments before Cody
makes his wish, he leads the two girls in a rendition of "Twinkle
Twinkle Little Star." It is during this number that he encourages the
audience to join in, at which point my already-cringing self was
reaching for a vomit bag.  The torture continued to escalate with an
"Old McDonald" set piece (complete with the Barnmeister decked out in
overalls) and, most excrutiatingly, a visit with bird expert Miss
Goldfinch, which results in a full-blown production number whose
appallingly inept choreography had me yearning for the halcyon days
where Debbie Allen lent the Oscars her ever-innovative dance moves,
such as having dancers hold up hula hoops during the 1995 "Circle of
Life" number.
That should have been enough to send me bolting to the exit, but then
I started to look at Barney's Great Adventure from a more academic
perspective, at which point the film began to queasily fascinate.  As
we see the jolly dino and his friends visit a parade, a circus, and
snooty French restaurant in pursuit of that elusive egg, I was oddly
mesmerized by this creepy alternate universe where no one finds the
sight of a plush, purple dinosaur (or for that matter, his
lighter-shaded but equally plush sidekicks Baby Bop and B.J.) followed
intently by a group of children the slightest bit unusual.  When
Barney takes to the restaurant stage and rocks the house with a jazzy
little ditty, the snobby patrons are less taken aback (if at all) by
his big, cuddly presence than they are by his less-than-formal
behavior.
But I suppose films like Barney's Great Adventure rightfully demand
some amount of suspension of disbelief, which will come rather easily
for the film's target audience, preschool and pre-preschool aged
children.  And in terms of that audience, Barney's Great Adventure is
completely harmless, if banal.  Barney doesn't really teach anything
to kids, but he does reinforce positive ideas--look both ways before
crossing the street, believe in your dreams, keep a healthy
imagination.  Granted, the latter point is more thoroughly and
entertainingly explored in any given episode of the delightful 1980s
animated series Jim Henson's Muppet Babies, but the accomplishment of
an entertainment that is magically able to keep the tykes in the
audience virtually still and silent for a full 75 minutes cannot be
discounted.
So, yes, Barney's Great Adventure--The Movie was a predictably
mind-numbing experience for me; one would have to shell out some big
bucks to get me to sit through it again.  But even though I am at the
younger end of the age spectrum for film critics, I am far older than
the movie's intended audience, and that audience will likely eat up
every last second of it.  Although its entertainment value to adults
is negligible, it is a safe, harmless bet for families, one parents
will neither regret nor fondly remember after it's over.

Title
Review for Senseless (1998)
Senseless (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
        Marlon Wayans is a very talented physical comedian, and it is that gift
that brings Senseless moments of life.  Alas, moments are simply that,
moments, which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its
one-joke premise.
        Granted, that one joke is initially amusing.  When Wayans's Darryl
Witherspoon, an economics major at Stratford University, hits some dire
financial straits, he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that
heightens all five senses.  After some initial side effects and problems
controlling his superhuman senses, Darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of
his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed
corporate firm.
        At this point, the film sounds more like Senseful than Senseless, but
through some turns of the plot, Darryl finds himself only able to use four
of his five senses at once, essentially leaving him--yes--senseless.  This
sets up some showcase moments for Wayans's gift for physical comedy,
especially when Darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes
completely, hilariously limp.  But these gags, and the gag behind the
entire movie, quickly grows stale.  Once Darryl is shown without the use of
all of the senses, instead of exploring any new comic territory, director
Penelope Spheeris and screenwriters Greg Erb and Craig Mazin take the easy
way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness.  Wayans approaches
each go-round with gusto, but by this point he's simply treading water for
the rest of the film's unfunny duration.
        Senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn't strive to be
anything more than a comic trifle.  However, the raucous and often raunchy
comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity.  Darryl goes through the
experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family, and this "serious"
angle seems to come from an entirely different movie.  Unlike Wayans's last
starring vehicle, the surprisingly effective (and serious) The 6th Man, the
"emotional" content of Senseless is forced and unconvincing.  Any attempt
at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--Darryl's romance
with Janice (Tamara Taylor), a young woman who yearns for a man who is true
to himself, does not generate sparks of any kind.
        Once his WB television sitcom The Wayans Bros. comes to an end, the
genuinely funny Marlon Wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of
him.  But if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as
Senseless, his film career could go the way of his once-promising older
brother, Damon, who is now set to make his comeback--on television.

Review for Strike! (1998)
        It's become obvious that the teen movie glut has not only reached
critical mass, but also creative bankruptcy.  The latest entry in the
youth horror sweepstakes, _Final_Destination_, not only had Death
claiming most of its characters, but also any real inspiration.  In the
comedy department, all accounts have the new _Whatever_It_Takes_ sinking
even lower than the depths slogged through in its immediate teen laugher
predecessor, _Drive_Me_Crazy_.  So when someone aims to do something
different with a youth-targeted film film, as the makers of
_All_I_Wanna_Do_ and _Here_on_Earth_ have, it comes as somewhat of a
relief.  But relief from the norm is one thing, and being refreshing is
entirely another--and only one of these two fits that bill.
        That compliment goes to the one that would appear to be less likely to
receive it: _All_I_Wanna_Do_, a comedy set in an all-girls boarding
school in New England.  While the film does cover the usual high school
comedy conventions--raging hormones (heightened, of course, by the
virtual absence of the opposite sex), gross-out humor--the estrogenic
setting and the time period (1963) gives the film a distinct point of
view.  Writer-director Sarah Kernochan does take her time to get to her
main point; a good portion of the film is devoted to simply hanging out
with the main group of girls, who form the secret society D.A.R.
(Daughters of the American Ravioli).  Its members are the scheming Verena
(Kirsten Dunst); wannabe slut Tinka (Monica Keena); smart girl Momo
(Merrit Wever); bulimic Tweety (Heather Matarazzo); and outspoken Odie
(Gaby Hoffmann), the new girl at Miss Godard's Prep School for Girls.
        Once the audience gets to know the group, the main story comes to the
fore: dire financial realities look to force Miss Godard's into going
co-ed, and the D.A.R., refusing to bow down to what they winkingly call
"the hairy bird," do what they can to keep the tradition of their school
alive.  While many teen films feature headstrong heroines, most of those
have the females' independent, intelligent attitudes melt away in the
arms of a handsome hunk.  Here, though, not only do the girls maintain
their voices, they grow louder and stronger as the film progresses. 
Rarely does one see a youth film quite as female-empowering as
_All_I_Wanna_Do_, and that fact would explain both former distributor
Miramax's barely noticeable test run of the film (then titled _Strike!_)
in 1998 and the ensuing years in distribution limbo; the prevailing
Hollywood mindset holds that girl power = limited commercial prospects. 
But any film as energetically performed (all the actresses, even the
usually annoying Hoffmann, are first-rate), entertaining, and rousing as
_All_I_Wanna_Do_ clearly has the potential to cross the demographic
barriers--that is, if given the chance.
        On the other hand, I can't imagine any audience other than weepy girls
falling for the teen tearjerker _Here_on_Earth_.  However, there are two
things going for this story of a small town girl torn between a wealthy,
big city suitor and a longtime friend: (1) the film is a romantic drama,
which is a nice change of pace for the teen market; and (2) a talented
and appealing cast.  Leelee Sobieski displays real grace and poise as
Sam, the girl caught in the middle; Josh Hartnett (who still doesn't use
a comb) displays some surprising depth as childhood sweetheart Jasper;
and the ever-promising Chris Klein radiates real movie star presence as
rich prep school boy Kelley.
        It's a shame that their talents are put at the service of such a mawkish
and poorly constructed piece of melodrama.  The love triangle never
catches fire because Jasper never seems a formidable romantic adversary
for Kelley; once that part of the story has long been exhausted, writer
Michael Seitzman and director Mark Piznarski trot in a lame bit of
potential weepiness that is made all the more annoying by its arbitrary
nature.  The three leads' impressive work confirms their potential for
major stardom, but _Here_on_Earth_ is far from the vehicle that will put
them over that plateau.

Title
Review for Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie (1996)
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        In adapting a popular television series to the big screen, one must
be careful not to stray too far from the source material so as not to offend
the die hard fans, which is exactly what this past summer's TV-inspired hit
Mission: Impossible managed to do with a single plot twist.  Fans of the
cult cable series Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MSTies, as they are called)
need not worry, for in the trip from small screen to big, little, if
anything, of what made the show so smart and funny has emerged unscathed.
        For those of you unfamiliar with the basis of the show, the premise
is simple yet brilliant: mad scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester (Trace
Beaulieu) holds average joe temp worker Mike Nelson (Michael J. Nelson)
captive in a satellite in space and forces him to watch some of the worst
movies imaginable.  This thin plot is really just a setup for the heart of
the show, in which Mike and his two robot friends, Crow T. Robot (Beaulieu)
and Tom Servo (Kevin Murphy) crack wise at the screen, gleefully saving
every awful detail of every awful movie.  This time around the target is the
1955 piece of sci-fi cheese This Island Earth, in which an alien race of
creatures with large heads try to take over earth.
        MST3K: The Movie is just like any other episode, and that's why it
works so well.  The makers of the film--producer-director Jim Mallon,
writers Nelson, Beaulieu, Murphy, Mallon, Mary Jo Pehl, Bridget Jones, and
Paul Chaplin--are also the crew behind the show, and they wisely didn't go
overly big-budget Hollywood with the film.  While the sets are more sturdy
and elaborate, and the wires that control the robot puppets have been
digitally erased, as a whole the film retains the low-budget charm of the
source material.  The look of the film is fairly irrelevant, since the true
"star" of MST3K has always been the writing, and there are far more than a
few good quips here though the commentary is slightly more crude than usual,
with an occasional profane word here or there (shame on you, Tom Servo).
Some critics have knocked MST3K: TM for cutting away from the movie within a
movie for sketches involving the cast, but I like their inclusion here, for
the film wouldn't truly be MST3K without the interludes with Mike, Crow, and
Servo on the Satellite of Love.
        I do have a couple of bones to pick with MST3K: TM, but this is
mostly due to my being a MSTie (#70623, to be exact).  The bouncy opening
theme song, which very succinctly and wittily sets up the story, is sorely
missed, as is the presence of a few players from the television series.  Dr.
Forrester is as wacky and fun as ever, but the character works better with
his dimwitted assistant, TV's Frank (Frank Conniff), who left the series
after the sixth season.  Michael J. Nelson is a very capable and likable
lead, but I always preferred the more dry, acerbic presence of original host
(and series creator) Joel Hodgson.  Gypsy (Mallon), the robot who pilots the
SOL, is thankfully given a greater presence in the film, but it doesn't make
up for the absence of Cambot (which shot the TV show) or the amorphous Magic
Voice.  These two never really played a major part of the show, but it just
isn't quite the same without them.
        The biggest problem of MST3K: TM, in my opinion, is that This Island
Earth, while certainly cheesy and ripe for ripping, isn't as prime cannon
fodder as some of the true dreck the threesome tackled in the television
series.  Mike and the 'bots still have more than enough to work with in This
Island Earth, but since the film isn't _that_ awful, MST3K: TM doesn't
measure up with some the funniest episodes of the series, such as ones in
which they rip the so-bad-it's-good 1975 Joe Don Baker action yarn Mitchell
or, my personal favorite, Pod People, a disjointed, laughably inept '80s
E.T. ripoff.
        The appeal of Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie will probably
fly over the heads of a lot of people--after all, watching three guys making
wisecracks about a bad movie may seem like dubious entertainment for
some--but it is a fast (only 74 minutes) and very funny treat that will go a
long way in converting those who _do_ get it into new MSTies.

Review for Mumford (1999)
Loren Dean is Mumford, the leading psychiatrist in the small town that
shares his name.  To paraphrase the press notes, while Mumford the town
has its share of secrets, Mumford the shrink has the biggest of all. 
This secret, treated in the film as a surprise but divulged by the film's
advertising campaign, is simple: Mumford is no licensed psychotherapist.
So who is Mumford, exactly?  While writer-director Lawrence Kasdan comes
up with a strangely convoluted backstory, it boils down to one simple
thing: he's a nice guy.  And what is _Mumford_, exactly?  Simply a nice
film.  But that's not as much of a compliment as it sounds.
This light ensemble comedy is pleasant to watch, and a lot of that ease
can be traced to the film's appealing ensemble cast, namely its standout
players.  Hope Davis shines as Sofie Crisp, the chronically-fatigued
patient for whom Mumford develops an unprofessional attraction.  Jason
Lee is, to borrow his character's catchphrase, "far out" as another of
Mumford's patients, Skip Skipperton, a young billionaire with a knack for
skateboarding (a characteristic that gives Lee the opportunity to flaunt
the skills that won him a number of international titles in his
pre-acting career).  Alfre Woodard radiates an inviting warmth as diner
owner Lily, who is also Mumford's landlord.
I make no mention of Dean, and that is not an accidental oversight. 
There is nothing particularly wrong with this performance, and his gentle
demeanor goes a long way in making the audience believe that people would
want to open up to him.  It's just that as a screen presence, Dean is
completely faceless, which makes him a perfect match for his character,
which similarly has neither quirks nor a distinct identity.  And that's
the film's central flaw; the only thing that is certain about Mumford is,
as mentioned before, that he's a nice guy.  While that indeed makes for a
likable protagonist, that doesn't make for a terribly interesting one.
The same can be said of the film's trite point.  There are a couple of
other (and bonafide) shrinks in town, Dr. Ernest Delbanco (David Paymer)
and Dr. Phyllis Sheeler (Jane Adams), but more people turn to Mumford. 
Not only is he easier to talk to, here's the kicker--unlike those two, he
actually _helps_ people.  Yes, the message of this film is the painfully
obvious: Mumford may not have a license, but his therapy works, and
that's what matters.
The banality of _Mumford_ wouldn't have mattered all that much if the
film had enough laughs, but those are in short supply.  Most come from a
running gag involving the television show _Unsolved_Mysteries_, and the
film's most comically promising character, a slimy lawyer played by
Martin Short, is barely a presence in the film.  So what's left are one
half of an interesting romance (the beguiling Sofie deserves someone with
a bit more zest than Mumford) and a handful of smiles.  Nice, yes.  But
nothing all that especially memorable.

Title
Review for Legally Blonde (2001)
_Legally_Blonde_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
        With its premise of a pampered, ditzy girly-girl somehow making her way
into Harvard Law, _Legally_Blonde_ has been dismissed as "_Clueless_ goes to law
school."  Actually, the film is more than that.
        In all seriousness, though, _Legally_Blonde_ is able to transcend its
unpromising origins due to two words:  Reese Witherspoon.  While the film goes
through its unsurprising paces from start to finish, Witherspoon keeps the
proceedings so perkily likable that one will be too busy smiling to complain.
        Director Robert Luketic isn't nearly as ambitious as Alexander Payne,
who used Witherspoon to such dazzling comic effect in her best film, _Election_;
whereas Payne mined her perkiness for subtly sinister satire, Luketic simply
uses it for the easy lightweight laugh.  That's just as well, for screenwriters
Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith clearly aim low.  Witherspoon's Elle Woods
is a very rich, very blonde, very _Clueless_ sorority girl about to graduate
with a degree in fashion marketing.  When her ambitious beau Warner Huntington
III (Matthew Davis) dumps her instead of popping the question before heading off
to Harvard Law, Elle makes like the WB's Felicity Porter and works her butt off
to gain entrance to the same school.  Needless to say, flamboyant Elle is like
the proverbial fish out of water in the stuffy Ivy Leagues, but don't
underestimate the power of blond ambition.
        Even with such modest goals, Luketic and the writers don't quite hit
every mark.  The climax brings to mind Marisa Tomei's classic testimony in
_My_Cousin_Vinny_ but quite pales in comparison since _Legally_Blonde_'s take is
rather abrupt, not to mention the film's central trial plot leaves a lot to be
desired.  But hitting every required mark and many in-between is Witherspoon. 
Not only is she a superb verbal and physical comedienne with precise timing, she
pulls off the critical task of making Elle ditzy in personality, not in nature. 
When Elle inevitably starts to prove her naysayers wrong, it's completely
believable--even if the surrounding circumstances are less so.
        _Legally_Blonde_ may get a bit heavy-handed and obvious in its conveying
its trite "Believe in yourself" and "Don't judge a book by its cover" morals,
but Witherspoon's finesse with the funny makes everything else go down fairly
easily.

Title
Review for Permanent Midnight (1998)
_Permanent_Midnight_ (R) ** (out of ****)
Arriving fairly fresh off the blink-and-you-thankfully-missed-it run of
Terry Gilliam's _Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas_ is another adaptation of a
drug-dazed book, this time a non-fiction one: _Permanent_Midnight_, the
celebrated autobiography of TV writer Jerry Stahl.  While the resulting
film is nowhere near the disaster Gilliam's was, screenwriter-director
David Veloz's glimpse at one man's real-life walk on the wild side rings
just about as false as that surreal work. 
The true story of Stahl would appear to make an intriguing film.  While he
was a successful writer for such television shows as _thirtysomething_,
_Moonlighting_, and _ALF_ (the latter recreated in the film as
_Mr._Chompers_), Stahl also led the life of a heroin junkie.  This double
life scenario does hold some promise, and with the vibrant Ben Stiller
playing Stahl, first-time helmer Veloz appeared to be onto something
interesting.
Veloz, however, shoots himself in the foot just about right from the
get-go.  Not content to follow Stahl's story straight ahead, he comes up
with a woefully unconvincing framing story.  We meet Jerry as he works in a
fast food joint as part of a drug rehab program, and he gets picked up by a
mysterious woman named Kitty (Maria Bello).  Jerry and Kitty hole up at a
motel, and in between (and sometimes during) attempts at sex, Jerry tells
Kitty of his turbulent life: the out-of-control heroin abuse and the
devastating effects it had on his marriage of convenience to a beautiful
Brit (Elizabeth Hurley, trying her best in a thankless role) and his
once-thriving writing career.
The Jerry-Kitty subplot fails the test as a simple framework, yet Veloz
somehow got the wrongheaded idea that this already-weak part of the story
could serve as the film's emotional core.  Past catches up to present by
the end of act two, when Jerry finishes his story and he parts company with
Kitty; just when one thinks that's the last of Kitty, act three's focus is
on Jerry's inexplicable romantic feelings for her.  According to the
script, Jerry and Kitty form an unbelievably strong bond during their
nights together, presumably due to the "similar pasts" they purportedly
share.  But one is never given a clear idea of Kitty's past; she alludes to
having similar troubles, but she never gets a chance to deliver her whole
story (or, at the very least, _enough_ of it).  Bello is terrific (she
could very well have a successful film career after suddenly bolting from
TV's smash _ER_), investing great warmth and humanity to her role, but,
still, Kitty never becomes a fully developed character.
The same, unfortunately, can be said about Jerry.  Stiller's immersion
into the role is admirable (he lost 30 pounds), and as a whole, he turns in
an impressive dramatic turn.  However, as written by Veloz, Jerry is less a
person than a set of tics: shaking, manic talking.  It does not help that
one is never treated to a glimpse to what Jerry was like before the drugs,
thus never lending the audience to a standard of comparison.  Even worse,
there's no clear turning point in Jerry's story; the film feels like it's
missing a scene where he realizes his mistake and decides to turn his life
around.  While one pivotal event is _said_ to be his turning point, its
depiction leaves little of that sense.
I have not read _Permanent_Midnight_, but based on what I've read about
it, the film is a pale shadow of what is said to be a work that is quite
harrowing and even funny.  Of course, what apparently makes the book work
even more is that it is all based on fact.  If I had not known that detail
in advance, I would not have been able to glean it from
_Permanent_Midnight_ the movie, which comes off as manufactured and
synthetic as most Hollywood product.

Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
It is not so much for that reason that _American_Beauty_ defies
conventional categorization than the manner in which it blends disparate
elements; that is, incredibly seamlessly.  Credit Ball and especially
Mendes, who knows not to simply strike the major note of each given scene
but also touch on the undertones that will take prominence in others. 
Even in the more outrageous, laugh-inducing moments, a darker, more
serious undercurrent can always be felt.  Part of this has to do with an
ominous piece of information that Lester divulges in voiceover in the
film's opening minutes: "In less than a year, I will be dead." 
The deft meshing of the comic and the tragic is best exemplified by the
characters.  This group of people is far from the most likable bunch one
can encounter; in fact, often they are flat-out unlikable, and much of
the film's humor is derived from that point.  But for all their comic
value, the characters aren't caricatures; they're painfully human. 
Underneath their frequently selfish actions lies their shared motivation:
a grave emotional desperation.  That deeper dimension comes through in
every one of the actors' performances; even the younger members of the
cast hold an impressively firm grasp of their characters' complexities. 
The most difficult acting job, of course, belongs to Spacey, whose
extraordinary performance not only makes Lester's newly rebellious life
course wickedly hilarious, but heartbreakingly sad as well.
_American_Beauty_ has been described as both a comedy and a drama, but
neither one is the most fitting description.  In retrospect, the term
that springs  to mind is mystery, but not necessarily because of the
questions surrounding Lester's eventual demise, though they do figure
prominently.  The film's central mystery is that of the meaning of its
title.  The answer that is eventually arrived at may not be all that
surprising, and perhaps a bit trite for some.  But what comes as
something of a shock is how profound and exhilarating the experience of
its discovery is--not so much for any of the film's characters, but for
the audience.  (opens September 15)

Title
Review for Independence Day (1996)
Everyone knows the story--"July 2... they arrive.  July 3... they
attack.  July 4 is... Independence Day--the day we fight back."  The
question remains, does the hype monster ID4 live up to its massive buildup?
In a word, no.  Despite some awesome effects, the just OK Independence Day
is done in by too many uninteresting subplots and not nearly enough action.
The major players in this '90s-era disaster tale of alien invasion
(told in three labeled sections: "July 2," "July 3," and "July 4") are: Air
Force fighter pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith, cool as ever); his stripper
girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica Fox); scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum,
doing another variation of his roles in Jurassic Park and Powder); his
father (Judd Hirsch in an embarrassing Jewish stereotype); alcoholic
cropduster pilot Russell Case (an excrutiatingly hammy Randy Quaid); United
States President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman, back in boring mode); his
wife (Mary McDonnell); and the White House communications director (Margaret
Colin).  As in the tradition of '70s disaster flicks, these and other
characters lead their own dissimilar lives until a larger-than-life disaster
(in this case, a hostile worldwide alien invasion) unites them.
And there lies ID4's ruinous problem--director/co-writer Roland
Emmerich and producer/co-writer Dean Devlin (the people who perpetrated
StarGate) spend too much time (and, in the process, bloat the running time
to nearly two and a half hours) establishing these frankly, with the
exception of Smith's engaging wisecracker, boring characters and even more
boring problems.  I like a good soap as much as the next person, but ID4's
"human element" is not a good soap--uninvolving and devoid of any interest,
not to mention credibility straining and, at times, unnecessary: was it
really necessary to have Goldblum and Colin's characters be ex-spouses?  If
Devlin and Emmerich were smart, they would have just let Goldblum be just a
scientist and Colin just a presidential adviser, in the process shaving off
15 minutes of interminable screen time devoted to their relationship
problems.  The same can be said of Quaid's drunk pilot and completely
colorless trailer park family, all of whom appear to have wandered in from
another film.  Their "bittersweet" storyline, along with the "tearjerking"
one of the President and the First Lady, are supposed to add some human
"emotion" to the proceedings, but the melodramatic moments feel forced and
are not the slightest bit involving.
Devlin said recently at a Los Angeles comic book/science fiction
convention that special effects don't matter if you don't care about the
characters.  However, the spectacular visual effects and production design
mattered much more to me than the cardboard space fillers passed off as
characters.  ID4 only comes to life during the elaborate effects sequences,
which _do_ deliver.  The explosive annhilation of New York and Los Angeles
truly must be seen on the big screen to be believed (I shudder to think how
all the spectacular effects would look on the small screen,
panned-and-scanned, no less), as do the gigantic, cavernous interior of the
mothership, and the two aerial battle sequences, which brings me to another
problem with the picture: lack of action.  Those two battle scenes, one in
the middle and one at the end, are pretty much all ID4 have to offer in
terms of action.  That would be acceptable if (1) the film weren't so
aggressively hyped as a big action extravaganza and (2) there were something
interesting going during the down time; alas, all we get are a few good
lines from Smith, by far the breakout star of the film, and the excrutiating
"human dimension."  For the slam bang action connoisseur, ID4 is a bust.
The script also gives the aliens the short end of the stick.  With
the exception of one violent lab scene reminiscent of Alien, the audience
and the earthlings never experience any up-close terror with the aliens;
virtually all of their damage is done via their massive spacecrafts, and, as
a result, they aren't nearly as terrifying and menacing as they should be.
What is missing is more direct contact with the invaders.  In the end, it is
more a question of whether or not the humans can defeat the alien technology
than defeat the aliens themselves.
My lukewarm reaction to the film appears to be in the minority, for
ID4 has already grossed a truly astounding $95 million in its first 5 1/2
days, and general audience opinion has been ecstatic.  But, as with all
insanely popular films, some sort of backlash is bound to happen sooner or
later.  Here's hoping it's sooner, for the mega-hyped ID4, while not
especially bad, is far from anything great.

Title
Review for Deep Blue Sea (1999)
In this most uncommonly eclectic summer of films--which has offered just
about everything from record-shattering space epics to potty-mouthed
animated kids--it's ironic that the one thing that has been missing is
_the_ typical summertime staple: the all-out, full-throttle action
extravaganza.  Leave it to popcorn director extraordinaire Renny Harlin
to fill the void in explosive fashion with his exciting super-shark
thriller _Deep_Blue_Sea_.
The killer shark theme of _Deep_Blue_Sea_ will inevitably (and
understandably) invite comparison to _Jaws_.  However, Harlin's film is
more reminiscent of the _Alien_ films, with a group of people trapped in
a confined space as murderous monsters stalk the halls: in this case,
three sharks that have large, genetically-altered brains--and a larger
appetite for blood to match.  If one must describe _Deep_Blue_Sea_ in
terms of other films, the best way to do so would be as "_Aliens_ meets
_Jaws_ meets _The_Abyss_," for the sea laboratory setting also means that
our human cast must also evade, as in that third film, violent rushes of
water.
If I said there weren't much more going on in _Deep_Blue_Sea_ aside from
sharks chasing people, I'd only be half lying.  There is a plot behind
the mayhem; something about how the enhanced sharks are part of scientist
Susan McAlester's (Saffron Burrows) experiments in developing a way to
regenerate human brain tissue.  But all plot pretty much goes out the
window once the first of her three test sharks breaks loose, setting off
a chain reaction of events that traps Susan and five others (played by
Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, Thomas Jane, Michael Rapaport, and
Jacqueline McKenzie) aboard the lab facility, which floats somewhere in
the ocean.
Of course, Harlin does take a break here and there from the ensuing
action in the interest of plot.  In theory, this would make this thrill
ride a bit more well-rounded, but the dialogue scenes play as excess
baggage--and often of the most ludicrous variety.  Many of the quieter
moments were met with derisive laughter by the audience, and it's no
surprise considering how laughable much of writers Duncan Kennedy, Donna
Powers, and Wayne Powers's dialogue is.  The characters (and actors) are
pretty much faceless mice placed into an experimental maze, and the
heavyhanded "dramatic" moments meant to correct the situation just end up
hurting the film.
Despite the hamfisted stabs at dramatic substance, Harlin never loses
his wicked sense of fun, best exemplified by how one character's
earnestly over-the-top monologue is punctuated by the fatal chomp of a
shark.  Fun is the intent of pictures such as _Deep_Blue_Sea_, and Harlin
delivers the goods, as he has many times in the past (most recently in
the underrated 1996 machisma-fueled shoot-'em-up
_The_Long_Kiss_Goodnight_).  Those breath-catching pauses for talk do not
derail the propulsive momentum of the film, which is essentially one long
run from the water and sharks.  There may be no emotional attachment to
any of the characters (though LL Cool J's wisecracking chef proved to be
an audience favorite, and indie stalwart Jane ably holds down the action
hero role), but the suspense and fright factor are definitely felt as
they are hunted down by the trio of sharks.
_Deep_Blue_Sea_ is indeed a triumph of Harlin's style over a lack of
substance, but when the results are as exciting and exhilarating as this
fast-paced thrill ride, any such complaint is moot.  After all, what more
can anyone ask from an unpretentious piece of pure action escapism?
On the other hand, "exciting" and "exhilarating" aren't the words I'd
use to describe the season's other "killer creature in the water" movie,
_Lake_Placid_.  "Bizarre" is more like it.  I hesitate to call Steve
Miner's film, in which a giant crocodile gobbles up anyone who sets foot
in a still Maine lake either a thriller or a comedy, and not because it
fairly seamlessly blends both of those genres.  It's that it doesn't do
either aspect much justice.  The "scare" sequences fail to do so,
especially due to the less-than-effective croc effects; and the humorous
touches thrown in by writer David E. Kelley--yes, the same David E.
Kelley responsible for such TV series as _Ally_McBeal_ and
_The_Practice_--aren't so much smart as they are silly.  The cast, which
is led by Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson, and
an amusingly foul-mouthed Betty White, is game enough, but they cannot
elevate the weak material beyond the watchable junk level.

Title
Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
On paper, _Erin_Brockovich_ bears more than a passing resemblance to
1998's _A_Civil_Action_.  Both are vehicles for major Hollywood stars
(respectively, Julia Roberts and John Travolta); both are based on true
stories; and both stories are about a legal crusader helping the
residents of a small town battle a large corporation that has been
contaminating the local water supply.  Despite these striking
similarities, there remains one key difference: while treating its
serious subject matter with the gravity it deserves, _Erin_Brockovich_
also manages to be a lot of fun.
That fact owes a lot to the film's vibrant title character, one that I
imagine even Hollywood would have difficulty creating if reality hadn't. 
Erin (Roberts) is a vivacious, twice-divorced mother of three who, as we
meet her, is not doing a very good job selling herself at a job
interview.  The scene is short, but its few minutes vividly depict the
delicate balance that Roberts and director Steven Soderbergh achieves
throughout the film's entire two-hour-plus running time.  The scene is
undeniably funny, its humor heightened by Erin's trashy mode of dress and
the increasing desperation of her words.  But one laughs at the situation
and not her; in Roberts' eyes one can catch the underlying sadness and
seriousness of the situation, plus the gradual awareness that she's
fighting a losing battle.  For the most part, _Erin_Brockovich_ plays in
a similar way; one is consistently engaged on a purely--for lack of a
better term--"entertainment" level, but providing an underlying
foundation is something that lends the proceedings a bit more dramatic
weight.
The major "something" in _Erin_Brockovich_ is the aforementioned case
involving the residents of Hinkley, California, whose water supply has
long been contaminated by the large PG&E corporation.  Through some
not-terribly-convincing plot machinations, Erin gets a job as an aide to
attorney Ed Masry (Albert Finney), and it is through her work there that
she gets personally involved with the plight of the Hinkley citizens,
many of whom are suffering grave illness due to prolonged exposure to the
poisoned water.
Erin is brassy, smartmouthed, and, most important of all, not a lawyer,
and the bulk of the film's enjoyment derives from the ballsy, carefree
way she conducts her research and life in general.  She is also
unabashedly a woman, not afraid to call upon her feminine wiles to get
her way--allowing Roberts to be more brazenly sexual than she has since
her career-making turn in _Pretty_Woman_.  Roberts also has never been so
ideally cast since that film; the kookiness of her character gives her
ample opportunity to flash that trademark smile of hers (not to mention a
few other assets) while giving her a chance to stretch comfortably as an
actress.  Not only are there plenty of the light moments for the fans,
there are just as many heavier dramatic scenes for her to display her
serious acting chops.  That these two sides seamlessly gel into a
full-bodied character is as much a compliment to her as it is to
Soderbergh.
Soderbergh's sure direction keeps the action moving briskly enough, the
actors believable enough, and the audience's emotions and interest
engaged enough to forgive the overall familiarity of the story.  Erin is,
above anything else, an average woman, and this is a traditional tale of
how she bucked the odds and scored a big triumph for herself and her
fellow common folk.  What aren't so easily forgiven, however, are other
formulaic wrinkles in the script, which is credited to Susannah Grant. 
Chiefly problematic among these is her relationship with the next-door
neighbor, a kind motorcyclist named George (Aaron Eckhart).  Their
relationship begins prickly, warms to a friendship, then heats up into a
romance.  Roberts and a barely unrecognizable Eckhart are well-matched,
but their skill and rapport are shoved into some pedestrian plotting.  As
Erin gets more involved in her case, George and her kids feel neglected,
leading to the usual resentment.  It is here where Soderbergh comes up
with the one moment that rings completely, ridiculously false: tending to
Erin's kids at a barbecue, George longs for his more freewheeling days
after watching a gang of Harley-riding bikers roar by.
The entirety of _Erin_Brockovich_ achieves its desired--and highly
commercial--effect so well, though, that most viewers, including myself,
won't ultimately care about such awkward moments.  Soderbergh loyalists
may be a bit dismayed that this film is not as risky and experimental as
his other works, but only a filmmaker with his  fresh savvy could take a
well-worn formula and make such a satisfying entertainment.

Title
Review for Romeo Must Die (2000)
_Romeo_Must_Die_ (R) *** (out of ****)
The big challenge faced by hot Hong Kong talent looking to make the
transition to mainstream American stardom is to expand their audience
without watering down the special qualities that earned them cult U.S.
followings to begin with.  More often than not, it's a losing
battle--witness director John Woo's lacking initial stateside efforts,
_Tomorrow_Never_Dies_' fleeting taste of Michelle Yeoh's considerable
capabilities, and the disappointing Jackie Chan lite on display in
_Rush_Hour_.  Against all odds and expectations, however, martial artist
extraordinaire Jet Li has managed to buck that dismaying trend, first
with his movie-stealing villain turn in _Lethal_Weapon_4_ and now his
first U.S. starring vehicle, the satisfying actioner _Romeo_Must_Die_.
As is so often the case with films such as these, the story of
_Romeo_Must_Die_ cannot be called satisfying in itself.  The main concern
of the plot is a routine bit of business involving a pair of rival crime
syndicates--one Asian, the other African-American--engaged in a violent
war over the control of waterfront property in Oakland.  The first
casualty is the Asian crimelord Ch'u Sing's (Henry O) son, younger
brother of Hong Kong convict Han (Li), who breaks out of prison and
travels to Oakland to, per usual, settle the score.  Such a familiar
story would not be complete without Han taking a liking to someone with
rival gang ties--namely, Trish  (Aaliyah), headstrong daughter of the
African-American gang's boss, Isaak O'Day (Delroy Lindo).
While the script by Eric Bernt and John Jarrell doesn't break any new
ground--its twists won't surprise anyone--it does provide a sturdy enough
foundation for what everyone pays admission to see: fight scenes.  And
these scenes deliver; first-time director Andrzej Bartkowiak (who had
previously made his name as a cinematographer) just about steps out of
the way and lets Li and fight choreographer Corey Yuen do their thing.   
Fans of Li's famous high-flying wire stunts will get their fix, but that
effect is wisely used in moderation, generally to punctuate some of Li's
already-impressive maneuvers.  Bartkowiak isn't completely hands-off,
though, and he puts an innovative x-ray visual effect--with which one can
literal see victims' bones crack--to good, measured use.  Some fight
scenes obviously exist just for the sole purpose of having them, serving
no real necessity to the story, but when they are as polished and
exciting as they are here, it's petty to complain.
Li was undoubtedly cast for his athletic prowess, but he also fares
pretty well in the other scenes, coasting on an easygoing charisma when
his English skills falter.  He shares a gentle rapport with R&B chanteuse
Aaliyah, who is the real revelation of the film.  For a screen neophyte,
she delivers a relaxed and impressively natural performance, even pulling
off some challenging emotional scenes.  The veteran of the cast, Lindo is
a welcome presence, adding some needed gravity to the proceedings; and
it's a pleasure to see Russell Wong, who had previously proven his
fighting chops in the short-lived television series _Vanishing_Son_, back
in action as Ch'u Sing's head enforcer.
The title _Romeo_Must_Die_ is a vague allusion to the even vaguer
allusions to Shakespeare's _Romeo_and_Juliet_ in the film.  Thankfully,
that's as pretentious as the film gets.  All _Romeo_Must_Die_ claims and
wants to be is one brisk jolt of action, and that's exactly what it is.

Title
Review for Friends & Lovers (1999)
_Friends_&_Lovers_ no stars (out of ****)
Late in _Friends_&_Lovers_, one character says, "Well, this sucks.  This
_really_ sucks."  This realization will come _much_ sooner for anyone with
the misfortune of watching George Haas's smug, self-satisfied ensemble
"comedy" _Friends_&_Lovers_,  about a circle of friends who in some way,
shape, or form cross over into the latter territory during a holiday in the
winter wonderland of Park City, Utah.
Among those in the cast, if you care (not that you should--or will):
Claudia Schiffer, whose debut turn as an aspiring model is enough to make
anyone forgive Cindy Crawford's _Fair_Game_; Robert Downey Jr., so
over-the-top as to be in his own earth orbit as a German ski instructor;
Stephen Baldwin, cementing his reputation as the least discriminating
Baldwin bro as a cocky (pun intended) womanizer; and Alison Eastwood, who
obviously believes that doing energetic nude sex scenes will be ticket out
from underneath her father's shadow (it isn't).  There is no structure or
dramatic tension to the film, which is just a bunch of aimless scenes of
people exchanging witless, pseudo-hip dialogue--that is, until Haas tries
to jolt the slumbering audience awake with a farcical fuckfest finale.  Too
much, too little, and _much_ too late: by the time the end credits began to
mercifully unspool, I was the _only_ person remaining in the auditorium,
the other five or so people in the audience having wisely bailed somewhere
along the misbegotten way.

Title
Review for L.A. Confidential (1997)

L.A. Confidential (R) **** (out of ****)
        Curtis Hanson's adaptation of James Ellroy's crime novel L.A.
Confidential earned a strong buzz after premiering at Cannes this past May,
and it's easy to see why: it is Hollywood moviemaking at its finest--a
classy piece of entertainment made with equal parts passion, style, and fun.
        The seemingly idyllic Los Angeles of the early 1950s provides the
glitzy backdrop for the grisly crime that is the focus of the story: a
bloody mass murder in an all-night coffee shop.  One of the victims is Dick
Stensland (Graham Beckel), a subpar police officer who was forced into
retirement after a brutality incident not too long before his death.
Heading the investigation into the murders are Stensland's former partner,
Wendell "Bud" White (Russell Crowe); ambitious but naive Edmund Exley (Guy
Pearce); and vice cop Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), who soon find out the
case is not as open and shut as it appears to be.
        Yes, L.A. Confidential is an uncommonly complex and intelligent
mystery; the ever-twisting plot continually surprises the audience without
insulting its intelligence, and the wry sense of humor Hanson and
co-scripter Brian Helgeland keeps the film from coming off as self-important
and pretentious.  But as sturdy as the story is, the film would not have
come to life in such fabulous form without its richly drawn characters,
particularly the All-American pair of Ed and Bud, played in career-making
turns by Aussies Pearce and Crowe.  For the most part, the central character
is Ed, a prototype for the "new" officer in the LAPD being introduced at
this time--one who prides himself on high moral principles, seeking justice
and truth without beating it out of a suspect.  While the intelligent Ed is
able to negotiate himself into a high position within the department, he
doesn't have the street smarts or toughness that commands respect from his
peers or elicit fear from his enemies; his reliance on eyeglasses only adds
to the problem.  On the other hand lies Bud, the "muscle" cop known to take
a brutal stand against perps, especially women beaters.  He is what is
perceived as the ideal cop, but as the film progresses, we see how his
hot-tempered style is quickly becoming obsolete, setting up an interesting,
intricate contrast.  Ed and Bud are not so much opposites in the manner of
black and white as they are in the yin and yang sense--they contrast, but
neither is clearly right nor wrong, and while they appear flawed and
incomplete on their own, together their qualities make an ideal whole.
        Surrounding Ed and Bud are an equally colorful cast of characters,
played to perfection by the impressive ensemble.  Spacey is terrific as
Jack, the spotlight-seeking cop who regularly busts showbiz personalities
with gossip rag editor Sid Hudgins, played with the right balance of smarm
and charm by Danny DeVito.  Kim Basinger is stunning, dangerous, and
vulnerable as glamorous top-dollar whore Lynn Bracken, even if her character
is one of the least effectively developed in the film.  James Cromwell (as
Capt. Dudley Smith), Ron Rifkin (as District Attorney Ellis Lowe), and David
Strathairn (as wealthy, shady Pierce Pratchett) also make lasting impressions.
        In the end, the reason why L.A. Confidential is such a juicy piece
of pulp fiction is that it is, quite simply, a good story told exceptionally
well.  It is superlative Hollywood entertainment--the type of picture that
Tinseltown likes to congratulate itself for making come March.

Title
Review for Alien: Resurrection (1997)
Alien Resurrection (R) *** (out of ****)
1992's Alien3 marked not only the death (by suicide) of its popular
protagonist, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), but, in many ways, the Alien
franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic, thanks to poor audience
word of mouth; and the critics who rallied around the first two
installments, 1979's Alien and 1986's Aliens, savaged David Fincher's slog
of a sendoff (myself included).  Hence, Weaver, director Jean-Pierre
Jeunet, and the others behind Alien Resurrection faced a two-fold
challenge--not only somehow resurrect Ripley, but also rescue this
once-profitable series from the scrap heap.  Despite the odds, they have
succeeded, even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to
the excellent first two.
Writer Joss Whedon devises a quick, easy, and painless answer to the dead
Ripley problem--clone her, which is what shady military scientists do using
some blood left behind on Fiorina 161, the prison planet of the third film.
 That done, the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her.  Alien
introduced Ripley as smart and resourceful; Aliens simultaneously toughened
her up and made her more vulnerable, exploring her maternal side; Alien3
saw her undergoing the seven stages of death.  What could be next?  Whedon
comes up with a clever spin: since the original Ripley died while
impregnated with an Alien queen, the blood used for the clone is also
"infected" with Alien DNA.  So the new Ripley is, indeed, new--a
human/Alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength, a
psychic bond with the deadly species, and a more predatory attitude.
Unfortunately, that is where Alien Resurrection's clever streak in writing
stops.  The Alien series is known for having stronger stories than most
creature features.  But the story in Resurrection is more of an
afterthought.  The movie begins with a plot involving some military types
attempting to train Aliens to do their bidding, but once the creatures
break free, it is once again Ripley and a ragtag crew (this time a bunch of
interstellar smugglers, including tough waif Call, played by a game Winona
Ryder) trying to exterminate them.  And the Alien Ripley scenario is
ultimately not exploited to its full potential; I would have liked deeper
exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent
her entire life trying to destroy. 
While the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting,
the formula is tried-and-true for a reason, and Jeunet tackles the
proceedings with giddy abandon.  The Alien, after all these years, is still
terrifying, and a new breed that is introduced is no less so.  The violence
is appropriately grisly and extreme, and the action set pieces are
suspenseful and exciting, most notably an extended underwater sequence.
The film is absolutely mesmerizing visually, thanks to the solid work done
by production designer Nigel Phelps and cinematographer Darius Khondji.  As
technically adept as Jeunet's direction is, perhaps his (and, for that
matter, Whedon's) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this
notably downbeat and serious series.  A sense of humor may seem to go
against everything this horror show stands for, but the self-awareness of
the excess just adds to the fun.
No, Alien Resurrection is not the great film that Ridley Scott's Alien or
the even greater film that James Cameron's Aliens was.  But after the
dauntingly slow gloom and doom of Fincher's Alien3, Jeunet's Resurrection
is a welcome return to its roots as a wild, reckless thrill ride.  That is
what made the Alien series so popular in the first place, and that is what
will keep the series popular in any future installments.

Title
Review for Tarzan (1999)
If there were anything in terms of the movie world as certain as death
and taxes are in terms of life in general, it's the iron-clad formula for
Disney animated features.  Tune-heavy musicals ready to be adapted for
the Broadway stage, with comic relief broad enough to appeal to wee ones
and grown-ups alike and happy endings calibrated for maximum
crowdpleasing, The Formula has been sturdy and reliable enough to be
worked year after year, like clockwork, to satisfying effect. 
Though last year's _Mulan_ put their animation grosses back on the
upswing, box office for Disney animated features had been in steadily
decline since _The_Lion_King_'s high-water mark in 1994.   Factor in the
recent raising of the animation ante by DreamWorks's sumptuous epic
_The_Prince_of_Egypt_ and to be further elevated, if buzz is to be
believed, by the forthcoming _The_Iron_Giant_ from Warner Bros., that
Disney formula--as tried-and-true as it is--is looking ripe for
reinvention.   And that's what the Mouse has done with _Tarzan_, a highly
enjoyable adventure that takes risky devations from The Formula--and, for
the most part, succeeds.
As can be gleaned from the title, this 37th full-length Disney animated
feature is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs's legendary man of the apes
(voiced as a child by Alex D. Linz, as an adult by Tony Goldwyn), who was
raised by a family of gorillas after his parents were killed when he was
an infant.  Directors Kevin Lima and Chris Buck memorably cover the
backstory--the arrival and settling of Tarzan's parents in the African
jungle, their death at the hands (paws?) of a vicious leopard, Tarzan's
adoption by gorilla matriarch Kala (Glenn Close)--with an efficient and
stunningly animated prologue scored to the rhythmic Phil Collins-penned
and -performed tune "Two Worlds."  The song effectively conveys the
primary theme of the film: that of Tarzan being caught between the world
of gorillas and that of humans, a conflict that comes to the forefront
when a human expedition team, including the beguiling Jane (Minnie
Driver, extremely well-cast), arrives in the jungle.
"Two Worlds" is one of five tunes heard during the course of _Tarzan_,
but, unlike nearly all of Disney's animated output, the film is _not_ a
musical.  It was a daring move, but it was a wise one.  Collins's songs
function well as an underscore (in terms of music and in terms of the
story's themes), and in this story, to have the characters burst into
spontaneous song would have simply felt odd--not to mention have been a
distraction.
And that's exactly what the film's sole production number, the clumsily
integrated "Trashin' the Camp," is--a needless distraction that stands at
odds with the rest of the film.  The song is a showcase for Tarzan's ape
best friend Terk, who is voiced by Broadway's most famous fan, Rosie
O'Donnell.  As has been widely reported, O'Donnell agreed to do the film
only if she were given a song to perform.  While her involvement gives
_Tarzan_ some negligible marquee name value, it wasn't worth the expense
to the film as piece; it not only is out of place, it also stops the film
dead in its tracks.  Even worse, the number, which (as the song's title
implies) has Terk and her pals destroying the humans' camp, is, quite
simply, not much fun.
The same can be said for Terk and her elephant pal Tantor (Wayne
Knight), the designated comic relief of the film.  Plainly said, they
just aren't very funny; their phoned-in small guy/big oaf routine is a
poor man's imitation of _The_Lion_King_'s classic comic team of Timon and
Pumbaa.  I cannot think of any good reason for there to be any comic
relief in _Tarzan_ other than to make a safe concession to The Formula. 
Surely Lima, Buck, and screenwriters Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker, and Noni
White could have seen that there is enough situational comedy built into
the story, as clearly evidenced by the hilariously, adorably awkward
first meeting between Tarzan and Jane and the refined Jane's clumsiness
in the wild forest. 
The forest is indeed wild--and wonderfully alive--in the hands of Lima
and Buck, for _Tarzan_ signals another advancement for Disney in the
visual arts.  _Tarzan_ is by far the most inventive Disney effort in
terms of animation; the aforementioned opening is a wonder in and out of
context, and with none of the restrictions present in the flesh-and-blood
world, the exhilarating abandon of Tarzan's vineswinging can truly be
captured in its high-flying glory.  Because of the interspecies language
divide, _Tarzan_ is highly dependent on facial expressions, which the
animation crew has refined to an even greater level of precision than
previously seen in Disney films.
I wouldn't rank _Tarzan_ among the very best of the recent Disney
animation crop, but for all its shortcomings, it is still family
entertainment of the highest order, with great appeal to both kids and
adults.  It also represents a crucial turning point for the Mouse's
animation house: a brave step away from The Formula and toward a new,
more varied direction for the new millennium.

Title
Review for Omega Code, The (1999)
_The_Omega_Code_ (PG-13) 1/2*  (out of ****)
I'm all for family-friendly entertainment with a minimum of sex,
violence, and foul language--that is, when done right.  And while
_The_Omega_Code_, a squeaky clean thriller financed by Christian
programming network TBN, may be right from religious perspective, it's
wrong just about everywhere else.  Stick a pro-faith overlay on poorly
made cheese, and it's still poorly made cheese, no matter how positive
its message is.
_The_Omega_Code_'s title refers to the secret code of the Bible, whose
hidden prophecies govern every move of Stone Alexander (Michael York), a
trusted politician bent on world domination.  The fate of the world and
mankind rests on the shoulders of Dr. Gillen Lane (Casper Van Dien), a
motivational speaker who comes into the possession of a computer program
that unlocks the Bible code--and is the final missing piece in Stone's
dastardly plot.
But we mustn't forget that this is a TBN production after all, and thus
come in all the added religious trimmings.  Gillen, while a proponent of
the Bible code, has lost faith in God after the years-ago death of his
mother, who was deeply religious.  Needless to say, he will have to
accept Jesus Christ as his lord and savior in order to save the day. 
Then again, saving the day is not so much up to Gillen, of course, as it
is to God, and _The_Omega_Code_ features what has to be the first literal
deus ex machina since the theatre of ancient Greek times.  As
faith-affirming as it may be, the wrap-up is hokey and maddeningly
unsatisfying.
Connoisseurs of camp will be the only people who will find much
satisfaction from the acting.  Van Dien is his usual unconvincing and
completely embarrassing self; did anyone believe this smug, stiff pretty
boy could convince as being a "Dr."?  He is matched in the stiffness
department by Catherine Oxenberg as a talk show host and, as Gillen's
wife, an unknown actress whose name doesn't much matter because you're
certain not to hear it again in the future.  As Stone, York oozes slime
and sleaze, which wouldn't be a problem for the villain role if he
weren't supposed to be a _trusted_ and _loved_ political leader.  Only
Michael Ironside, in his typical shady element as Stone's main enforcer,
does any work that is the slightest bit dignified.
And when I say "only," I mean only--the direction (by Rob Marcarelli) is
flat; the special effects are laughably cheap; and the script is
amazingly lunkheaded (Gillen's wife lets him know that their house is
bugged by writing "BUG" on a paper, only to then discuss their "secret"
plans verbally).  In the end, the only thing that can be considered the
slightest bit worthwhile is its spiritual message, but its something one
can get at a fraction of the time--and for free--by simply tuning to TBN.

Title
Review for Brokedown Palace (1999)
_Brokedown_Palace_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
The perky print ads for this gravely earnest drama suggest a cosmetics
campaign and, ironically enough, end up painting a more accurate picture
of what the film is really like--and, hence, what is so wrong with it. 
After high school graduation, best friends Alice Marano (Claire Danes)
and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale) decide to take a clandestine trip to
Thailand, where they meet an affable Australian stranger (Daniel Lapaine)
who, after charming them both, frames them for a drug deal.  Suddenly
both of our heroines are each serving a 33-year sentence in the
"Brokedown Palace," and their only hope is an oily American lawyer (Bill
Pullman) with a practice in Bangkok.
_Brokedown_Palace_ shares the basic Americans-in-dirty-foreign-prison
setting with 1978's _Midnight_Express_ and last year's
_Return_to_Paradise_, but that's where the similarities end.  The
"Brokedown Palace" certainly is brokedown, but, compared to most prisons,
it is somewhat of a palace.  What horrors do our normally pampered teens
face?  An involuntary haircut (Alice even admits that she's had worse)
and a bitchy, troublemaking inmate who stuffs fish heads in Alice's
bedroll and coaxes her into touching some (literally) forbidden fruit. 
The rest of the time, the prison resembles nothing more than an unusually
strict and exceptionally unsanitary day camp.  As a result, all drama and
suspense is diminished, and then vanquished completely by Jonathan
Kaplan's glossy direction (the song soundtrack actually would sound at
home in a fragrance commercial) and David Arata's formulaic and
unconvincing screenplay.

Title
Review for Players Club, The (1998)
A mix of Showgirls, Striptease, and '70s Blaxploitation.  Sounds like a
surefire recipe for camp, but against all odds, Ice Cube's directorial
debut The Players Club, if a bit uneven, works a lot better as a serious
drama than its individual ingredients would make it appear to be.
The Players Club is the name of a seedy Southern strip bar that counts
among its stable of dancers Diana Armstrong, a.k.a. "Diamond" (newcomer
LisaRaye).  Like Demi Moore in Striptease, college senior Diana dances to
support her child and better her life (and pay her tuition).  The Showgirls
ingredient comes in Diana's feud with lesbian-leaning bitch queen dancer
Ronnie (Chrystale Wilson), who has a lustful interest in her adversary.
Like a Blaxploitation heroine, Diana is also a headstrong superwoman,
determined to protect her naive, also-stripping younger cousin Ebony
(Monica Calhoun) from falling prey to the job's dark side; and more than
willing and able to kick whatever ass stands in her way.
Cube, who also wrote and has a small role, one-ups his film's stripping
cinematic cohorts by for the most part succeeding in his intentions.  The
Diana-Ronnie feud, thanks in no small part to the solid performances by
Wilson and LisaRaye, never comes off as ridiculous.  Cube has his cake and
eats it too--he even delivers the knock-down, drag-out catfight that
Showgirls promised but never delivered.  And unlike Striptease, most of the
humor works.  Earning the lion's share of laughs is Bernie Mac as the
club's sleazy malapropism-prone owner Dollar Bill; Jamie Foxx also has some
effective comic scenes as Blue, the club's DJ.
However, that's also where Cube runs into some trouble.  The broad humor
and more cartoonish characters (like Dollar Bill and his right-hand man
L'il Man, played by A.J. Johnson) are never seamlessly meshed with the
film's largely grim, gritty tone and earnest story.  Some laugh lines fall
flat (one reference to co-star John Amos's former role on the TV show Good
Times is too obvious and in-jokey to be funny), as does some of the
dialogue in general; Cube sometimes offers hackneyed lines such as "I
walked into the Players Club a girl... and came out a woman."
But overall Cube guides The Players Club with a sure hand, and he makes a
true acting find with the commanding LisaRaye, whose diamond-hard charisma
recalls the young Pam Grier.  Diana's mantra "Make the money; don't let the
money make you" is neither the most profound nor original statement, but
LisaRaye is able to make you believe it--and believe _in_ it.

Title
Review for Goodbye Lover (1999)
_Goodbye_Lover_ (R) *** (out of ****)
Imagine you're the head of a major studio.  You have an interesting little
film that is hard to categorize, yet you have enough faith in the project
to unveil it at a major international film festival.  Your faith is
confirmed when the film receives, on the whole, a warm reception.  What do
you do now?  If you're the head of Warner Bros., apparently you don't do
anything.
Despite good notices at Cannes last May, Roland Joffe's
description-defying _Goodbye_Lover_ has been sitting on the studio shelf
ever since, its release date being randomly tossed around the schedule like
a hot potato (until recently, it had been targeted for a release in
January... of 2000).  But after much headscratching in the WB marketing
department, the studio has now finally decided to bite the bullet, setting
an all-but-concrete mid-April release.  So what exactly was the problem?
After watching the film, it's easy to see why Warner was at a loss as to
what to do.  _Goodbye_Lover_ is a very enjoyable lark of an entertainment,
but the film's virtues are exactly what made it such hell to market--it's a
deliciously unpredictable thriller with a dark, very offbeat sense of
humor.  That the film juggles both elements is unusual enough; that the
film juggles them as well as it does is even moreso.
A lot of the enjoyment to be had with _Goodbye_Lover_ hinges on surprise,
so I'll speak of the plot in the vaguest possible terms.  Sultry Los
Angeles real estate agent Sandra Dunmore (Patricia Arquette) is married to
Jake (Dermot Mulroney), whose career as an ad exec is threatened by his
little drinking problem.  Jake's older brother is slick, pompous public
relations exec Ben (Don Johnson), who is dutifully served by staff
underling Peggy Blaine (Mary-Louise Parker).  Needless to say, nothing is
quite as it seems in this twisted little circle, and eventually a crime
within it brings the group to the attention of burned-out police detective
Rita Pompano (Ellen DeGeneres).
 Warner Bros. is describing _Goodbye_Lover_ as a "film gris" (as opposed
to noir), and the description is apt (for the French-challenged, "gris"
means grey).  In the most basic sense, its underlying, tongue-in-cheek
sense of humor keeps it from reaching the darkness of pure noir, yet the
mordant nature of the humor doesn't exactly make the film a sunny romp,
either.  But the "gris" label also fits how seamlessly Joffe and writers
Ron Peer, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow meld their two genre worlds.  They
have their cake and eat it too, coming up with a comic thriller that
genuinely surprises or, rather, a twisty comedy that delivers
laughs--though, it must be said, that a number of wisecracks, which
primarily come from the mouth of Pompano, clang.
However, the occasional groaner is forgivable when there is such an
intriguing cast of characters.  All are well-played by the actors, but
there are two cast members who stand out the most.  The most interesting
character is Sandra, who looks and dresses like a siren, yet she's also a
devout churchgoer (a volunteer, no less) who loves listening to
self-improvement tapes and _The_Sound_of_Music_.  Arquette's typically flat
line delivery, which often fails her (most recently in
_The_Hi-Lo_Country_), is actually works here, a perfect fit for the
character's ambiguity.  DeGeneres has an ideal film showcase as the heard-
and seen-it-all Pompano, and though her character's sarcastic asides don't
always hit the mark, she delivers them with aplomb.
The greatest irony of year-long marketing-mulling session on
_Goodbye_Lover_ is that regardless of what direction Warner Bros. decides
to take with its publicity campaign, the film is just about certain to
flop; its sensibilities are much too warped to appeal to a wide audience.
Nonetheless, its fresh, unique voice will likely win _Goodbye_Lover_ a
devoted group of admirers, as it did nearly a year ago at Cannes.  (opens

Title
Review for Bringing Out the Dead (1999)
_Bringing_Out_the_Dead_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
There's an interesting movie about a paramedic struggling to come to
grips with a past trauma through a flurry of destructive chemical
indulgences, but Martin Scorsese's _Bringing_Out_the_Dead_ is not the one
I have in mind: it's Scott Ziehl's _Broken_Vessels_, a similarly-themed
low-budget indie that received a very limited theatrical run earlier this
year.  This is not to say that Scorsese's slicker studio effort does not
feature its share of virtues--in fact, there are many--but, to use a
tired cliché, its whole amounts to less than the sum of its often
exceptional parts.
One such part is Nicolas Cage, who plays graveyard shift New York City
paramedic Frank Pierce.   Having already played a drunk to Oscar-winning
effect in _Leaving_Las_Vegas_, Cage breaks no new acting ground as Frank
gradually falls deeper into booze and other substances to shake off his
malaise with the nightly work grind and ease pain over the loss of so
many patients, namely that of a young girl named Rose (Cynthia Roman),
for whose passing he feels especially responsible.  But it's a role he
plays well, and he lends a great deal of sympathy to the role even when
he's at his most obnoxious.
But this adaptation of the Joe Connelly novel shows Frank mostly being
sad and frustrated during three nights of frenzied paramedic activity
that Scorsese stages with flashy, frantic energy.  While these scenes,
punched up with a lot of sped-up motion and other visual tricks,
effectively capture the insanity and intensity of the high-wire living,
it gets redundant when repeated three times over--especially after it
becomes apparent that Frank is paired with paramedic partners in the
order of their portrayer's placement in the credits (first John Goodman,
then Ving Rhames, then Tom Sizemore).
Despite all the chaos and bleeding bodies, the narrative through-line of
Paul Schrader's script is made obvious from the start: Frank must come to
grips with losing Rose (whose face in those of every person his ambulance
passes by) and accept the reality that he cannot save them all.  Leading
him to this ultimate realization is dealing with a dying heart attack
victim (Cullen Oliver Johnson) kept alive only by the occasional electric
shock.  There's no suspense or mystery to the tale; in _Broken_Vessels_,
the main character's secret--and hence his reasons for a lot of his
behavior--is gradually revealed through the course of the film; in
_Bringing_Out_the_Dead_, Frank divulges just about everything in an
opening voiceover.
So it's up to the actors to engage the attention, and they're up to the
task.  All three of Cage's partners hold their own and make their own
unique stamp; best is Rhames, who is quite amusing as a medic who
preaches the gospel.  Two other actors give admirable performances but
are hampered in other areas.  Patricia Arquette is convincingly pained as
Mary, the daughter of the heart attack victim and Frank's eventual object
of affection, but she and Cage are another of those real-life married
couples who don't exactly ignite onscreen.  Salsa sensation and
newly-minted pop star Marc Anthony is hits the right notes as crazy
street person Noel, but he's less a character than a time filler, asking
for water in the hospital, escaping, causing trouble, getting beaten by
Sizemore's character, and then repeating the cycle.
It's too many repetitions--drunken drives in the ambulance seen in
hyperspeed, the heart attack victim flatlining then getting shocked,
Frank seeing Rose's face--that stretches _Bringing_Out_the_Dead_ to its
two-hour running time and ultimately beyond complete effectiveness.  If
the film had been trimmed down, some of the film's dark atmospherics
would have undoubtedly been lost, but it would have been a more tightly
focused and compelling picture.

Title
Review for Simply Irresistible (1999)
_Simply_Irresistible_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
They say that the way to a person's heart is through his or her stomach,
so one would think that before _Simply_Irresistible_, a food-centered
romance would have hit the big screen...
...oh, I forgot--_Like_Water_for_Chocolate_ got there first.
Then allow me to rephrase: one would think that one would come up with a
romance that was not only food-centered, but a fantasy where the besotted
chef's emotions magically manifest themselves in her cooking...
...oh, I forgot--_Like_Water_for_Chocolate_ covered that, too.
That leaves writer Judith Roberts and director Mark Tarlov with nary a
fresh idea between them, and stars Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick
Flanery with nothing fresh to work with.  The latter fact is especially a
shame, for Flanery and the luminous Gellar are wonderfully matched as,
respectively, wealthy department store manager Tom Bartlett and the young
woman he eventually falls for, a mediocre chef at a struggling New York
restaurant named Amanda Shelton.  The two Meet Cute at a street food
market, where a mysterious stranger sells Amanda a basket of crabs, one of
which is magical (!) and pinches Tom's leg.  Forcing a meeting between
Amanda and Tom is just the first trick up the crab's sleeve, for he turns
Amanda into a master chef, winning the hearts of many, not least of all
being the commitment-phobic Tom's, with her divine culinary masterpieces.
This setup plays about as dreadful as it sounds, with only the appeal and
chemistry of Gellar and Flanery keeping it watchable.  But around the
midpoint, with the appearance of the object of its original
title--_Vanilla_Fog_--_Simply_Irresistible_ starts to develop some low-key
charm.  At this juncture, Tarlov and Roberts appear to realize that the
mere presence of magic does not a magical film make.  As exhibited in
Alfonso Arau's absolutely enchanting 1993 film _Like_Water_for_Chocolate_,
fantasy elements must be firmly rooted in the characters and story in order
to really work, and once the fog appears and lifts, the emphasis is placed
less on the magic than the characters, and as such that element feels more
like a necessary part of the story and not an arbitrary gimmick.
Even so, it's too little too late--the damage caused by the unpromising
opening and the annoying plot device of the crab (which, like the stranger
who sells it to Amanda, is never explained) is done, and the effectiveness
of _Simply_Irresistible_'s latter half merely serves as a glimpse of what
might have been had the filmmakers been more focused.  As such, this murky
and ultimately bland effort lives up to that former title--_Vanilla_Fog_,
indeed.

Title
Review for Ransom (1996)
Every once in a while there comes a "can't miss" project that, once
it hits the screen, falls flat on its face.  Ransom isn't one of them.  The
involvement of director Ron Howard and stars Mel Gibson and Rene Russo add
up to a powerful, riveting thriller that engrosses from beginning to end.
Touchstone has advised the press to keep the lid on some plot points
(one of which, I think, is fairly obvious), so I will be as succinct as
possible.  Gibson and Russo play Tom and Kate Mullen, he a successful
airline magnate, she his glamorous wife.  They have it all--a penthouse in
New York, money up to their ears, and a young son, Sean (Brawley Nolte, son
of Nick)...  Alas, things fall apart when Sean is kidnapped and held for $2
million ransom, which Tom eventually refuses to pay and instead offers as a
bounty on the head of the kidnapper, much to the dismay of Kate and an FBI
agent (Delroy Lindo) dealing with the case.
It is always a disappointment when the filmmakers have a good thing
going then botch things up through carelessness.  While the makers of Ransom
don't botch the film, carelessness does lead to the film's two major
gaffes--the clear presence of boom microphones in two different scenes.
This is especially a shame, since both boom cameos take place during some
key dramatic moments; in one, the drama and passion of a Gibson monologue is
severely undermined by the boom.  Instead of listening intently to the
speech and paying attention to the story, the audience at the press
screening could not help but roar with laughter.
Unwanted booms aside, Ransom is first-rate entertainment.  Richard
Price and Alexander Ignon's smart script wisely does not make Tom into a
hero of impossible goodness; in fact, Tom is more than a little
unsympathetic and morally ambiguous.  His virtue--and sanity--is naturally
called into question when he offers the ransom as a bounty, but his values
are even more questionable when we learn that he paid a bribe to save his
airline... yet won't pay for the safe return of his son.  Gibson, in a fine
performance, does not sugarcoat anything and creates a complex, difficult
character.  We see and feel his genuine love and concern for his son and can
understand his desperation, but one cannot help but think that he's going
about the whole thing wrong, that maybe he's lost his mind.  What's more,
he's not exactly sure that he's sane, either.
Howard garnered many an accolade for his directing chores on Apollo
13, but I feel his work here is just as accomplished, if not more.  He
mostly shoots the film matter-of-factly, free of flashy edits, and this
restraint helps build the tension more naturally and makes the emotions feel
more real.  Howard's most notable achievement is with his cast, who all turn
in solid work.  In addition to Gibson, Russo also impresses, having more
than her share of standout moments.  Her role could easily be branded as
thankless, but here she's given an opportunity to show more of her acting
chops than ever before, painfully conveying the grief and anguish over her
child's disappearance and her husband's questionable actions.  Lindo has
perhaps the most thankless role as the stock fed, but he still makes a
lasting impression, and Gary Sinise is ideally tough and smart as an NYPD
detective who gets involved in the case.
"Someone has to pay," reads the tagline for Ransom.  After seeing
this smart and, yes, thrilling thriller, it is no mystery  who that
"someone" is--the moviegoing audience, who is sure to pay some major bucks
to see this surefire box-office winner.

Title
Review for Urban Legend (1998)
What hath Kevin Williamson wrought?  While the horror movie revival
spurred on by his _Scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the
genre--_I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_, _Halloween:_H20_, and _Scream_2_
--it must be noted that Williamson himself had a hand in the writing of
those films.  Those Williamson-less post-_Scream_ efforts, among them
_Wishmaster_ and the recent _Disturbing_Behavior_, have been frightening
all right--frighteningly, insultingly _bad_.  Add to that list
_Urban_Legend_, which takes a promising premise and runs it through a
predictable meat grinder of idiocy.
The influence of Williamson on screenwriter Silvio Horta is clear in two
key areas.  First, the opening sequence, like that of _Scream_, is an
extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial
ball rolling.  This sequence, in which Pendleton College coed Michelle
Mancini (Natasha Gregson Wagner) is decapitated while driving, also reveals
the other obviously Williamson-esque touch: the killer's look.  Dressed in
a large hooded parka, wielding an axe, the killer bears more than a passing
resemblance to the _I_Know..._fisherman, sans the hook.
One thing Horta does not borrow from Williamson, however, is the
intriguing premise.  Students at Pendleton are being killed by way of urban
legends--those contemporary bits of "mythology" passed from person to
person, group to group, year to year that become so embedded in the social
consciousness.  It hardly matters if they are true or not, such as the tall
tale that Mikey from the Life cereal commercials died from a fatal
combination of Pop Rocks and Pepsi (he didn't).  Michelle, slain by the
"killer lurking in the backseat" of lore, is but the first to fall prey to
an urban legend come true; as the body count rises, fellow Pendleton
student Natalie (Alicia Witt) suspects not only a link between the murders,
but a personal link to her past as well.
The setup shows promise, but the story never takes off, due in large part
to Horta and the director, the aptly named Jamie Blanks, who fires round
afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares.  Too many of
the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues, and the
film's chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _Scream_ tried to
subvert, like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends
when they should--and could--run out the front door.  But that is just the
tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches; there's also the climactic
villain confession, in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is
revealed, not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick,
which is a cliche in any film genre.  Banks and Horta's (intentional)
attempts at humor are also lame; the fact that the best gags are lazy,
in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars Joshua Jackson and
Rebecca Gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor.  Some
laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is
revealed, but I'm not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it
were meant to be so.
The filmmakers don't get much help from their onscreen talent.  I was far
from a fan of bland _I_Know..._ starlet Jennifer Love Hewitt, but I'd talke
her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic Witt, whose inept
attempts at emoting were often met with laughter; Witt has a pefect foil in
her equally pesence-challenged leading man, Jared Leto.  _Dawson's_Creek_
star Jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo; Gayheart displays all
the depth and range of, well, a Noxzema spokeswoman; and Robert Englund
lends the film little more than his Freddy Krueger pedigree as a folklore
professor.  Granted, the cast
is hampered by their material.  Loretta Devine, who has done some fine work
in films such as _Waiting_to_Exhale_, is saddled with the ridiculous role
of a Pam Grier-worshiping campus security guard.
The recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one
man--namely, Kevin Williamson--to stay alive.  If other filmmakers continue
to make such shoddy product as _Urban_Legend_, the genre looks to once
again go the way of screen slashers' many victims.

Title
Review for Message in a Bottle (1999)
_Message_in_a_Bottle_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
I am a sucker for a shamelessly romantic confection, and the swoony
trailer for Luis Mandoki's adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's bestseller
_Message_in_a_Bottle_ promised the tear-stained goods.  A woman finds the
titular item and is so touched by the letter that she seeks out the letter
writer--and finds him.  Along the way, we hear such wonderfully saccharine
lines as, "Don't you think it's brave--to love like that in this world?",
"Choose between yesterday and tomorrow," and, most memorably, "You were my
true north."
But as _Message_ dashed headlong into its tear-wringing final frames, the
audience at the screening I attended was noticeably dry-eyed and -nosed,
with very few audible sniffles.  And it's understandable why, for I
certainly was not one of those few.  I don't mind a formulaic film if the
film goes about the formula in an interesting way, or the story is strong
enough to sweep me away, formula be damned.  _Message_ does neither.  It is
a rather conventional and conventionally told tale where a lonely woman
(here, Chicago newspaper researcher/divorced single mom Theresa Osborne,
played by Robin Wright Penn) finds a kindred spirit in another lonely soul
(North Carolina widower Garret Blake, played by Kevin Costner, the author
of the message), but his devotion to a lost love (dead wife Catherine)
keeps him from committing.
There is nothing wrong with that story in and of itself, and Costner and
the radiant Wright Penn are a natural screen pair.  But director Luis
Mandoki and scripter Gerald DiPego wrap it in _too_much_ formula.  Theresa
and Garret fall for each other, but there's a Big Secret that threatens the
future of their relationship, the revelation of which naturally comes at
the pinnacle of their happiness (read: after they first make love).  (The
Big Secret in question, of course, is that Theresa found Garret's bottle
and sought him out.)  But even way before the story gets to that point,
there are other irksome cliches, in particular Theresa getting an early
wrong impression Garret after spying him in a brawl with his former
brother-in-law.  Speaking of in-laws, too much time is spent on a pointless
subplot involving Garret's strained relationship with them.  As if that
weren't damaging enough as it is, the thread is resolved in an overblown,
wordless, melodramatically-scored scene that borders on the laughable.
Perhaps the most disappointing thing about _Message_in_a_Bottle_ is that
it really could have turned out to be something.  The story has a proven
hook, and the casting is dead-on.  Wright Penn is captivating and likable;
Costner's typical stiffness is compensated by his rapport with his female
lead; and they are well-supported by Illeana Douglas (as Theresa's best
friend/co-worker), Robbie Coltrane (as Theresa's boss), and, in a
scene-stealing turn, Paul Newman (as Garret's father).  But these
individual elements are just that, elements, floating in a  large, overly
familiar sea.

Title
Review for Baby Boy (2001)
        Given the fact that _Baby_Boy_ marks writer-director John
Singleton's cinematic return to the 'hood of South Central Los Angeles a
full decade after his acclaimed debut _Boyz_N_the_Hood_, it makes sense
for Columbia Pictures to play up the connection to that seminal double
Academy Award nominee in its advertising campaign.  However, the
sure-to-be constant comparisons (which are further encouraged by
erroneous reports calling _Baby_Boy_ a sequel to _Boyz_) will only be a
disservice to what is a distinctive and worthy film in its own right.
        While not a _Boyz_ sequel, _Baby_Boy_ can be seen as a companion
of sorts since it also traces a young African-American man's coming of
age in South Central.  Similarities end, though, with the central
character, Jody (Tyrese Gibson).  Jody is 20-years-old and father of two
children by two different women, yet he's a layabout who still lives with
his rather young mother, Juanita (A.J. Johnson).  Jody, who spends most
of his days hanging out with his equally directionless best friend
Sweetpea (Omar Gooding) is every bit as selfish and immature as he
sounds, and while this has an unavoidable distancing effect on the
audience, it's a credit to Singleton and Gibson that they don't sugarcoat
Jody's unsympathetic qualities.  Whenever his girlfriend (and mother to
his eldest child) Yvette (Taraji P. Henson), Juanita, or her O.G.
boyfriend Melvin (Ving Rhames) express their frustration with Jody's
behavior, one feels their impatience right along with them--as one
should.
        Jody's belligerent act is often laid on a bit thick, as if his
outbursts are less a natural result of his short temper than it is the
manner in which he believes people expect him to behave.  His biggest
problem, it becomes clear, is not his attitude but his buying into the
fatalist mindset of the young inner city black male.  The image of his
own death recurs in his dreams and thoughts, but the visions don't really
"haunt" him per se; he seems to welcome them, as if being a "man" is to
constantly prepare himself for dying.
        But Jody isn't beyond redemption and/or redirection, and
ironically a great deal of his buried sincerity comes through in his
rather destructive relationship with Yvette.  _Baby_Boy_ may in essence
be a study of Jody, but the heart of the film is Jody and Yvette's
tortured romance.  Their moments of tenderness, and the chemistry between
Gibson and Henson, convince that these two people genuinely love and care
for each other.  But those pure moments are rare, and one is left to
wonder if their feelings are worth all the pain they put each other and
themselves through.  Singleton points no fingers, for both parties do
their part in perpetuating the vicious love/hate cycle.  "Baby boy" Jody
constantly cheats on her; the ever-suspicious but easily forgiving Yvette
can't bring herself to leave him, at least not for very long.
        The two screen newcomers are nothing short of exceptional in the
leads.  Given how abrasive his character is a lot of the time, the strong
charisma that Gibson has previously exhibited in his music, TV hosting,
and modeling careers is key to the character's engagement of the
audience.  Gibson's natural presence hooks the viewers in, and thankfully
he has the solid acting chops to keep them riveted.  He's more than able
to hold his own with the seasoned likes of Rhames and Johnson (who are
also terrific), and he is able to subtly convey what's behind Jody's
tough veneer: vulnerability, self-doubt, and, to a certain degree,
self-loathing.  Considering a number of Yvette's scenes involve her
angrily yelling at Jody, the true worth of Henson's work  can all too
easily be discounted; there's real soul behind the sometimes shrill
surface.  Most indelible is a nonverbal scene where a teary Yvette
envisions--as he sexually services her--what a life spent with him could
be like.  If pictures speak a thousand words, the looks on her face speak
a million.
        The largely internal nature of the drama in _Baby_Boy_ is
gripping enough that it's a bit of a letdown when external conflict
arises.  When Snoop Dogg turns up as Rodney, Yvette's just-paroled--but
hardly reformed--convict ex,  Singleton ends up retracing steps he and
many other filmmakers have taken in the past.  This is not to say that he
doesn't find some fresh spin, but for a film that had taken a hard look
at difficult people in difficult situations, this narrative direction
seems a bit too easy, making way for a resolution is a little too tidy.
        Nonetheless, however diluted the film's initial power feels at
the end, with _Baby_Boy_ Singleton has again succeeded in making a
thoughtful and provocative film that long resonates in the mind.

Title
Review for Made (2001)
        After the success of 1996's _Swingers_, it would have been easy
for writer-star Jon Favreau to follow up the cult comedy fave with
another excursion in nouveau hipster catch phrases and swingin' big band
music.  But for _Made_, his directorial debut and long-awaited reunion
with co-star Vince Vaughn, Favreau has rather admirably taken a
different, unexpected route, and the ride is certainly a witty and
entertaining one.
        Knowing that _Made_ is completely unrelated to the Doug
Liman-directed _Swingers_ (that is, aside from sharing common talent) may
still not prepare fans of the previous film for this one's distinctly
darker flavor.  Favreau and Vaughn again play friends here, but the
relationship between struggling L.A. boxers/construction workers Bobby
and Ricky is far more volatile than that of _Swingers_' Mike and Trent,
as summed up by film's opening scene.  As the two face each other in a
bout, Vaughn's cocky Ricky openly mocks Favreau's no-nonsense Bobby,
setting himself up for a big pummelling.  The cycle constantly repeats
itself in a figurative sense after the pair are tapped by their
construction boss, small-time mobster Max (Peter Falk), to handle what
should be a quick and easy job in New York City.  Bobby wants nothing
more than to just do what he's told and collect the payment that could
provide a more stable life for him, his stripper girlfriend Jess (Famke
Janssen), and her daughter Chloe (Makenzie Vega, rid of the painful fake
lisp she sported in _The_Family_Man_).  Ricky, on the other hand, fancies
himself an instant organized crime big shot, leading him to do a number
of none-too-bright things that draw the ire of Big Apple big boss Ruiz
(Sean "Don't Call Me 'Puffy'" Combs, who fares better than expected in
his acting debut), his underling Horace (Faizon Love), and most of all
the increasingly impatient Bobby.
        Favreau doesn't give an artificial and inappropriate sunniness to
_Made_'s criminal milieu; this film even lacks a certain spring in its
step as far as pacing.  The slower, more rambling progression works well
in this context, though, for it adds to the dark undercurrent that runs
through the film.  While Ricky's antics are a primary source of light
amusement, the sense of foreboding lends an edge of danger to his
bumbling actions; there is always the real possibility that any one of
his wrong moves could be their final one.  The largely hand-held camera
work by cinematographer Christopher Doyle also adds to the gritty
atmosphere.
        Traces of grave seriousness turn up in _Made_ (particularly in
Bobby's side of the story), but there is no mistaking that Favreau has
cast a comic tale inside this dark world.  At the center of all of the
laughs is Ricky, whose delusions and general cluelessness make for
someone truly abrasive and annoying--which is exactly the often-hilarious
point, and Vaughn nails the role so perfectly that you may just want to
beat some sense into him, much like how Bobby tries to at various
junctures.  Favreau puts the pair in physical conflict once or twice too
many, but the banter that typically leads up to fighting, while not
_Swingers_ quotable, is spirited and sharp, as is the dialogue on the
whole.  False notes are rare among the entire cast, including those in
customary throwaway roles; even the likes of a briefly seen flight
attendant (Jennifer Bransford) and hotel bellboy (Sam Rockwell) exhibit
some level of colorful personality.
       Despite their clear cut differences in tone and style, comparisons
between _Swingers_ and _Made_ are inevitable, so to answer the burning
question: with its many memorable lines and scenes (the classic one with
the answering machine most quickly comes to mind) _Swingers_ is the
breezier, funnier, more enjoyable film.  But the reasons for my
_Swingers_ preference once again points up the fundamental differences
between the two.  _Swingers_ is more a movie of moments while _Made_ is
more about the larger picture--a picture that may not end up with the
fervent following of its flashier predecessor, but one that is definitely
worth a look.  (opens July 20 in New York and Los Angeles)

Review for Shakespeare in Love (1998)
_Shakespeare_in_Love_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
This Brit-set period romantic comedy had been in the development stages
since 1990, with star pairings ranging from the promising (Kenneth Branagh
and Winona Ryder, currently displaying a nice rapport in Woody Allen's
_Celebrity_) to the potentially ghastly (Daniel Day-Lewis and...
accent-challenged Julia Roberts?!) attached.   _Shakespeare_ has now
finally arrived onscreen, and, I am glad to report, in the right
hands--those of director John Madden and stars Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth
Paltrow.
If Fiennes and Paltrow's charming lead turns as, respectively, the Bard
and Lady Viola, the woman who melts away his writer's block and inspires
_Romeo_and_Juliet_, is the lifeblood of this film, then its vigorous body
is the deliciously witty script by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, full of
great lines (most delivered by Judi Dench's Queen Elizabeth) and peppered
with intelligent details (sly allusions to Shakespeare's _Twelfth_Night_).
Madden is the film's spirit, coaxing memorable work from his cast--or,
rather, _most_ of his cast (co-star Ben Affleck is too contemporary to
convince as a pompous Elizabethan stage actor)--and striking a nice blend
of light and heavy, achieving true emotion in its finale.  However, the
scale is definitely tipped toward the "light" side, for this fine film is
frothy fun.

Title
Review for BASEketball (1998)
The freshness date for the joke-a-second comedy style pioneered by the
writing-directing team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker in
1980's _Airplane!_ has just about expired--look no further than Abrahams's
latest ZAZ-flavored solo effort, _Jane_Austen's_Mafia!_ (which is being
promoted as just plain _Mafia!_ in spite of the onscreen title prefix).
While Abrahams had been able to keep the style, which crams ridiculous
sight and verbal gags within single scenes and shots, fresh, and funny in
his _Hot_Shots!_ films, most of the gags in the film (which he co-wrote
with Greg Norberg and Michael McManus) are simply uninspired.  A spoof of
_The_Godfather_, _The_Godfather_Part_II_, and _Casino_ (including riffs on
_The_English_Patient_, _Forrest_Gump_, _Child's_Play_, and even
_Showgirls_), _Mafia!_ packs no big laughs, only a handful of
smile-inducing jokes.  Not helping matters is the lackluster efforts of the
cast, led by a bland Jay Mohr as the Al Pacino stand-in and the late Lloyd
Bridges, noticeably frail, as the Marlon Brando-esque don.
While Abrahams tries to milk the old ZAZ formula for more riches (and
coming up mostly dry), one of his former cohorts, David Zucker, tries to
modernize it by incorporating the background-gag style into a '90s lowbrow,
gross-out comedy.  The result, however, is simply disastrous.
_BASEketball_, about two losers (Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of
the cult hit TV series _South_Park_) who create a baseball/basketball
hybrid that becomes the national pastime, is a painfully unfunny would-be
satire of the commercialization of professional sports--or, rather, it
_initially_ sets out to be a satire, with its sharply written prologue
about how money became the center of all things athletic.  But once that
passage is done, Zucker, Robert LoCash, Lewis Friedman, and Jeff Wright's
script degenerates into a tedious series of unamusing and rather forced
gross-out gags, such as milk squirting from male nipples and the licking of
a vibrator.  There was only one funny gag, and that was when a familiar
buddy-buddy reconciliation scene culminated not in a warm hug, but in a
long, wet, tongue-heavy kiss (now that I've given that joke away, there's
no reason for you to see the movie).  As actors, Parker and Stone are...
well, creators of a cult cartoon show.  One has to wonder about Universal's
marketing campaign that boasts "starring the creators of _South_Park_."
I'm a big fan of _The_Simpsons_, but that doesn't mean I'll watch a film
starring creator Matt Groening.
As low as Zucker or the modern masters of lowbrow comedy,
_There's_Something_About_Mary_'s Farrelly Brothers, go, no one can tap into
the uniquely warped wavelength of writer-director John Waters.  His latest,
_Pecker_, features more of his singular brand of cinematic dementia.  Among
the hilariously eccentric pieces of Baltimore white trash featured: a
sweets-obsessed young girl named Little Chrissy (Lauren Hulsey), who
guzzles Jolt cola and eats sugar straight from the sack; her mother Joyce
(Mary Kay Place), a thrift-shop owner who enjoys offering her fashion
"expertise" to the homeless; Chrissy's older sister Tina (Martha Plimpton),
who works at a gay male strip bar known for "teabagging" (don't ask); and
Chrissy's grandmother Memama (Jean Schertler), whose sacred statue of the
Virgin Mary not-so-miraculously "speaks" (she makes the voice herself).
Toss in running gags about the pubic hair on lesbian strippers, and what
could possibly be wrong?  In short, the film doesn't have much of a pecker.
 The title character (a truly dazed Edward Furlong) is Little Chrissy's
perky older brother, who snaps photos of everyone and everything he sees
around him.  Pecker's photos of his "culturally challenged" family and
community come to arouse great interest in the New York art world, building
to a rise to fame that causes the inevitable friction with his family; his
girlfriend Shelley (Christina Ricci, wonderfully acid as always), who runs
her laundromat with an iron fist; and his gleeful shoplifter of a best
friend, Matt (Brendan Sexton III).  This main thrust of the film, however,
is downright flaccid compared to the comic potency of the fascinating and
wildly amusing weirdness of all else.  There's quite a bit to laugh at in
_Pecker_, but the sturdy jokes stand up at the periphery of a very limp
center.  (_Pecker_ opens September 25)

Title
Review for Other Sister, The (1999)
_The_Other_Sister_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
A couple of days ago a friend told me about a conversation he had with
screenwriter Robin Schiff about a sequel she had written to her fun,
frothy _Romy_and_Michele's_High_School_Reunion_.  In this promising
second installment of the bubbleheaded blonde best buddies' adventures,
Lisa Kudrow's Michele gets hitched, and she and Mira Sorvino's Romy open
up their own restaurant, complete with--yes--a lunch special for
businesswomen.
Sadly, Touchstone turned down the script, citing that it would not draw
an audience even though the original was a midsize hit.  But if Buena
Vista's idea of audience-drawing films are projects like
_The_Other_Sister_, the Mouse is in serious trouble.  In this film,
Juliette Lewis stars as Carla Tate, a mentally challenged young woman who
wants to be treated like an independent adult once she returns home after
years at a special school.  Her parents, however--especially her
overbearing mother (Diane Keaton)--are hesitant to let her go.  Carla's
romance with Danny McMahon (Giovanni Ribisi), another mentally challenged
student at her vocational school (the scenes at which were all filmed at
my and Cameron Diaz's alma mater, Long Beach Polytechnic High School),
gives Carla's parents more reason to worry.
I could see this story possibly working as a drama; Lewis is
particularly effective, delivering an understated and often touching turn
as Carla.  But director/co-scripter (with Bob Brunner) Garry Marshall
play the material for laughs.  Cheap laughs.  For a film that aims to
empower the mentally challenged, almost all the attempted comedy comes at
the expense of Carla and Danny.  Marshall would probably argue that the
audience is laughing with them, but when a scene where Carla loudly yet
earnestly describes human reproduction is played for comedy, the audience
is clearly supposed to laugh _at_ her.  The same thing goes for the
entirety of Ribisi's performance, which is over-the-top to the point of
mockery.  The press notes describe _The_Other_Sister_ as "uplifting" and
"bittersweet"; a more accurate description would be "insulting."

Title
Review for Dancer in the Dark (2000)
_Dancer_in_the_Dark_ (R) **** (out of ****)
Without question, the love-it-or-hate-it reaction that greeted Lars von
Trier's _Dancer_in_the_Dark_ at this year's Cannes Film Festival will be
duplicated as the film slowly rolls out in theatres across the country. 
The controversial winner of this year's Palme d'Or is a film that not
only challenges conventional explanation, it also defies easy analysis. 
But given the dramatic effect--both positive and negative--that it has on
audiences, it can be agreed that Dancer in the Dark is a film like
no other, and even if only to simply bear witness to such a bold,
experimental work, it commands a viewing.
However, I believe there is a lot more to _Dancer_ than simple curiosity
value, and I think my--and the rest of the film's fans'--embrace of the
film stems from an idea suggested in a comment that von Trier made (which
has also been echoed by co-star Catherine Deneuve) about the film's star,
Icelandic music sensation Björk (who won the Best Actress prize at
Cannes): "She can't really act; she can only feel."  Similarly, I think
the key to appreciating _Dancer_ is not to watch it, but to "feel" it--to
experience the raw gamut of emotions it thrusts upon the audience
throughout its 140 minutes.
This idea of "feeling"--and the big debate over the film--is established
long before a single image appears on screen.  _Dancer_ begins with a
somber five-minute overture accompanied by a black screen, and it would
be easy to dismiss it as a pompously pretentious move.  But it also
clearly announces two of von Trier's objectives in this film: first, to
evoke the spirit of the grand melodramas of yesteryear; and second, to
immerse the audience the point of view of his main character, Selma
Jezkova (Björk).
Selma, a Czech immigrant trying to carve out a living as a punch press
operator in the 1960s Pacific Northwest, is going blind.  Keeping Selma
going as her condition rapidly deteriorates is the love of and for her
12-year-old son Gene (Vladica Kostic) and her love for the lavish
Hollywood screen musicals.  The latter initially manifests itself in
Selma's life in her ability to imagine music out of everyday sounds. 
While the strains of the overture don't derive from such a recognizable
source noise, this opening gets the general idea across: the audience
sees darkness yet can hear music, much like how Selma experiences her
reality.
A number of writers as well as distributor Fine Line Features have been
remarkably indiscreet about divulging details about _Dancer_'s story; in
fact, the film's trailer gives away one critical plot point.  I won't do
that myself though I will say this  much more about the story: Selma's
condition is hereditary, and she puts away every single penny of her
negligible factory wages toward an operation that would save Gene from
her literally dark fate.  To say more than that is to say too much,
making the temptation to include spoilers quite understandable--there
really isn't much to von Trier's story.  That has also been leveled as a
criticism of the film, but I think it's a deliberate move; the
straightforward plot again reflects old-fashioned screen melodrama dating
back to the silent era.
There is another cinematic spirit von Trier conjures up, and that is of
the classic, cheery Hollywood musical.  References are everywhere--Selma
regularly attends showings of Busby Berkeley tunefests with her best
friend and co-worker Kathy (Deneuve), who often has to verbally describe
the onscreen action to her; Selma and Kathy spend a number of their off
hours rehearsing for a community theater production of
_The_Sound_of_Music_; and, most notably, Selma has elaborate fantasies of
her life as a musical.  These numbers, which are shown in a glorious
mock-Technicolor splendor, starkly contrast with Selma's reality not only
in a visual sense (the shaky hand-held camera work and washed out,
_Breaking_the_Waves_-style hues evaporate in favor of a vibrant faux
Technicolor and quick cuts between what reportedly are up to 100 fixed
digital video cameras) but in an emotional sense--these scenes are all
unbridled joy while the rest of the film bears an unshakable air of
misfortune and misery.  Much has been said about von Trier "reimagining"
musical conventions by marrying high-kicking production numbers with a
grim story, but, again, he's not so much attempting something fresh than
reviving what had been an out-of-fashion aesthetic: that of classical
opera, which invariably is tragedy set to music.
Granted, however, these are non-traditional musical numbers, beginning
with the music itself.  Björk composed all of the songs, and like her
other work they are characterized by a dissonant marriage between
orchestral arrangements and more manufactured sounds--an admittedly
acquired taste for general listening, but a perfect match for this
context; nearly all of Selma's numbers are triggered by a real world
noise, which lingers as a song's backbeat.  That makes just about none of
the songs instantly hummable nor memorable (though the pivotal "I've Seen
It All" leaves a haunting impression); consequently, each appearance of a
musical number--which are all heavily choreographed--is made all the more
jarring and, in certain cases, annoying.  Nonetheless, a strange effect
is achieved; a couple of the interludes don't quite work as you watch
them, but when looked back upon as part of the bigger, completed picture,
a method is revealed to the madness.  Selma's imaginings grow more
outrageous as her situation grows more dire, and it becomes clear that
her dreams are not so much an escape route from her real life than her
only way of actively and effectively living that life.
If, as the comment goes, Björk can't act but only feel, von Trier could
not have made a better choice for his lead.  Selma's story is all about
emotion, and in order for _Dancer_ to succeed, her portrayer must make an
instant connection with the audience.  And that Björk instantly achieves;
Selma may be rather naďve (another point of criticism for the hate-its),
but she is endearingly, honestly so, and one is easily willing to
accompany her on her flights of fancy and stand by her during her many
trials and tribulations.  While von Trier's radical storytelling and
directorial hand are a large factor, the astonishing, unadorned force of
the film's finale would not have been achieved with an "actress" playing
Selma.  Björk simply is Selma--and the film itself.
Given von Trier's reputation as an insincere provocateur, the
impassioned hate-it contingent for _Dancer_in_the_Dark_ is not only
understandable, perhaps it's even correct in pegging the film as a
fraudulent come-on.  _Dancer_ could very well be read as some sick joke,
a cynical jab at an America that invites foreigners to its land with
sunny propaganda (here, movie musicals) only to plop them down in the
diametrically opposing genre--tragic melodrama; or even an experiment in
shameless audience manipulation.  But if von Trier's machinations are
able to wring such a genuine and profound emotional response from the
audience by the final frame (and I speak not only of the overwhelming
sense of loss and devastation it brings the film's admirers but also the
equally fervent anger it incites in its detractors) how can the work
be--as the now-infamous _Daily_Variety_ review of the film put
it--"artistically bankrupt on every level"?  (opens September 23 in New
York)

Title
Review for Talented Mr. Ripley, The (1999)
_The_Talented_Mr._Ripley_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
The big surprise of the year-end awards season has been the strong showing
by this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel, written and directed by
Anthony Minghella.  The raft of accolades is somewhat understandable; this
'50s-set thriller is certainly one of the most laid-back suspense films I
have seen in recent years, and its pleasures are accordingly unconventional.
The chief strength is how the film slowly seduces rather than relentlessly
prods the audience, lulling it into its spell--much like how the title
character, Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), eases his way into the good graces of
Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law, in a star-making turn), whom Tom is paid (by
Dickie's tycoon father, played by James Rebhorn) to drag from his new home
of Italy back to the United States.
As Tom gets to know Dickie, his friendly girlfriend Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth
Paltrow), and their carefree, jazzy lifestyle, he falls in love with his
newfound best friend.  When Dickie's attention to him starts to wane, and it
becomes clear that his affection cannot be reciprocated, Tom uses his talent
for impersonation and forgery to have Dickie's life as his own.  Needless to
say, myriad complications are in store, not least of which is an
ever-elongating line of dead bodies.  But this is no traditional,
exploitative thriller, and the understated--but no less violent--way in
which Minghella depicts the murders succeeds in genuinely unsettling the
audience rather than giving them a cheap shock.
There is a bit of a problem in the center of _The_Talented_Mr._Ripley_, and
that is Mr. Ripley himself, adequately played by Damon.  Minghella has taken
great pains to make him a rather sympathetic character (unlike in René
Clement's 1960 French adaptation of the novel,
_Purple_Noon_(Plein_Soleil)_); Tom here is a gawky, insecure young man whose
underlying motivation for killing is his frustration with having to hide his
"true self."  The problem is that one never gets a sense of who this person
is since he's seen in an act of impersonation (to one degree or another)
right one from frame one.  With no clear idea of who the real Tom Ripley is,
it's hard to completely feel for him--a task which is already difficult
considering all his victims are, indeed, innocent.  Nonetheless, Minghella's
film is, overall, an effectively disturbing work.

Title
Review for Trainspotting (1996)
(R) *** 1/2
        While ID4 ate up all of the mainstream press the months leading up
to its release, the independent film community was all abuzz over
Trainspotting, which had gone on to be the second-highest grossing British
production of all time (behind Four Weddings and a Funeral).  Danny Boyle's
heroin drama has finally washed up on U.S. shores, and this sometimes
surreal, always harrowing film truly is unlike anything anyone has ever seen
in recent years.
        This brisk, darkly humorous, 95-minute ride follows one Mark Renton
(Ewan McGregor of Boyle's Shallow Grave), an aimless Scottish youth who,
with his buddies--the dimwitted Spud (Ewen Bremner) and Sean
Connery-obsessed con artist Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller)--choose not to
"choose life," opting instead for the empty but pleasurable life of heroin
addiction.  The film follows Mark and the gang as they quit and get hooked
again, have disastrous flings with women, have a couple of sick--but
hilarious--mishaps with feces, and get in trouble with their violent,
hard-drinking (but not drug-using) friend Begbie (Robert Carlyle).
        Trainspotting, based on Irvine Welsh's controversial novel of the
same name, has been accused of glamorizing heroin, and it does... to a
point.  While Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge, through the use of a
voiceover delivered by Mark, never deny the pleasure in shooting heroin, the
visual cues speak for themselves: everyone lives in filthy, cramped
apartments on the brink of collapse; everyone appears unclean and is prone
to passing out and defacating on oneself.  The more surreal moments, which
Boyle uses to capture the addict's state of mind, may hold some appeal and
serve as convincing pro-heroin propaganda for the most impressionable
viewer, but, as a whole, Boyle and Hodge don't smooth over all of the rough
edges--witness the manic, bizarre, but unsettling withdrawal scene that
occurs about halfway.
        If Trainspotting has a major flaw, it is in the area of character
development.  McGregor is a likable actor, and he thus makes Mark
sympathetic to the audience, but Mark remained somewhat of a mystery.  Sure,
he tosses off a couple of good one-liners and enjoys heroin, but I wasn't so
sure what motivated him, save for that abstract concept of "not choosing
life."  This becomes especially bothersome come halfway through the film,
when his personality and look on life takes a dramatic turn; it is
apparently brought on by a comment made by his teenage sometimes-lover
(Kelly Macdonald), but I'm not completely convinced that was all that
motivated it.
        Miramax seems to be touting Trainspotting as the next Pulp Fiction,
but I don't think it'll catch on here as it did overseas.  While it is a
fine example of efficient, resourceful filmmaking, with the sharp writing
and dark humor that characterized Pulp, it is not as easily accessible, at
least not for an American audience.  All of the actors have thick Scottish
accents and speak in the local slang, which will be largely inscrutable to
Yankee ears, and I'm not so sure the bulk of America is ready to embrace an
admittedly odd film about the glories of heroin addiction.  What it will
attract is a loyal--and sizable--cult following.

Title
Review for General's Daughter, The (1999)
_The_General's_Daughter_ (R) *** (out of ****)
It appears that the "in" thing for directors of popcorn fluff to do
these days is tackle projects of greater weight--witness _Ace_Ventura_
helmer Tom Shadyac's _Patch_Adams_ and _While_You_Were_Sleeping_ director
Jon Turtletaub's _Instinct_.  Yet while those films proved--all too
painfully--the limits of their respective directors' skills, _Con_Air_
director Simon West respectably stretches beyond slam-bang action
theatrics with the largely absorbing mystery thriller
_The_General's_Daughter_.  
However, West is not completely immune to regressing to his
commercial-bred bag of tricks.  That's not necessarily a bad thing; in
fact, West channels that energy into some effective sequences.  The quick
edits during a big fight scene between Army investigator Paul Brenner
(John Travolta) and a weapons-trading baddie are initially distracting,
but they do succeed in ratcheting up the tension level.  The frenetic
visual style works even more effectively in a harrowing rape scene, where
the cuts keep the onscreen happenings from being overly graphic and
exploitative, all the while still jangling the audience's nerves.
What does become problematic, though, is West's insistence on pleasing
the audience in the broadest terms.  The story, based on the best selling
novel by Nelson DeMille, revolves the brutal murder of the title
character, Army captain Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson), an Army
captain; brought in to solve the crime is Brenner and rape investigator
Sarah Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe).  It soon becomes clear that the two have
stumbled onto something bigger, and must (as the tagline goes) "go behind
the lies" to find the truth.  Complex issues of honor, military code, and
loyalty are brought up along the way, and they are all fairly
intelligently handled--that is, until the underwhelming end.  A big
explosion at the climax serves no real purpose other than to inflate the
budget and sate audiences hungry for pyrotechnics.  The film rebounds
with a thought-provoking coda, but instead of leaving audiences with
something to chew on, West spoils the mood with an arbitrary (perhaps
test screening-mandated?) closing text card that divulges the ultimate
fate of one key character.  As if not knowing when to quit, he ruins
things further with rolling the end credits over a pointless shot of
another character literally driving off into the sunset.
Nonetheless, these missteps do not fatally dilute
_The_General's_Daughter_'s effectiveness.  While Christopher Bertolini
and William Goldman's script takes some interesting twists and turns,
what keeps the film gripping are the actors.  Apparently learning a page
from his _Con_Air_ producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, whose instincts at
casting are rarely less than keen, West's actors are a perfect fit for
their roles.  Travolta is ideally cast as the alternately goofy and
no-nonsense yet always on-target Brenner; Stowe, exuding her usual air of
intelligence, works well off of him.  James Woods is in his element as
Elisabeth's shady and slimy mentor; just as intimidating, if not more, is
Clarence Williams III as a colonel loyal to the general (James Cromwell,
carving out a nice post-_Babe_ career as an all-purpose character actor).
Although it has more dramatic heft than a _Con_Air_,
_The_General's_Daughter_ is a fairly comfortable step for West; in the
end, it's still unmistakably a Hollywood entertainment, which kept his
wrong turns from being ruinous ones.  Nonetheless, it is an important
step for him, one that shows that he has a grasp on substance as well as
style--and, as such, making him a filmmaker to keep an eye on.

Title
Review for Avengers, The (1998)
_The_Avengers_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
Before I take a closer look at anything within a film--the acting, the
script, whatever--it must first pass the "WTF" test.  That is, I must be
able to safely watch the entire film without once seeing something so
incredibly, stupefyingly insulting, at which point I am left to (audibly)
utter, "WHAT THE FUCK?"  The mega-budgeted big-screen update of the cult
'60s spy TV series _The_Avengers_ failed the WTF test around the 25-minute
mark, when the villainous Sir August DeWynter (Sean Connery) has a
conference with his partners in crime.  While that doesn't sound out of the
ordinary in and of itself, DeWynter and his conspirators, seated at a long
table, are all wearing fuzzy teddy bear suits.  Each one in a different
color of the rainbow.  Everyone together now: "WHAT THE FUCK?"
Exactly what is this completely incomprehensible bore perpetrated by
"director" Jeremiah Chechik and "writer" Don Macpherson about?  No, it's
not about superslick British spies John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Dr. Emma
Peel (Uma Thurman) and their world-saving adventures.  Nor is it about
DeWynter's mystifying plan to somehow destroy the world by way of a weather
machine.  Far from it.  _The_Avengers_ is about the superstylish fashions
sported by Academy Award-nominated models Fiennes and Thurman.  Here's
Ralph in a classy gray flannel and silk suit with matching bowler hat and
umbrella.  Now it's Uma, looking fetching in a skin-tight, neck-to-toe
vinyl catsuit with four-inch heels.  And so on.  Yes, there is something of
a story stringing the fashion show together, but since Chechik and
Macpherson obviously didn't give it a second thought, neither will I here.
Granted, the photogenic Fiennes and Thurman make an attractive pair.  But,
as with even the best models, things go straight to hell once they open
their mouths.  The two are talented actors, but there's nothing they or
anyone can do with Macpherson's witless idea of comic repartee.  The
tension that consequently builds between Steed and Peel is not sexual but
of a different sort--the type you get when oil and water meet (so I guess
you can say there is some kind of chemistry going on).  The Oscar winner in
the bunch, Connery, is even more lost, so over-the-top as if to be "acting"
in a completely different film from another planet. 
For the entire film, the audience with whom I saw _The_Avengers_ was stone
silent... until the end credits started to roll, at which point a lone
voice from the rear of the auditorium snapped, "That shit was stupid."
While no one offered an "amen," I'm certain that's exactly what everyone
was thinking.

Title
Review for Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999)
_Black_and_White_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
_Ghost_Dog:_The_Way_of_the_Samurai_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Earlier this week, the _Los_Angeles_Times_ ran a story on how "hip-hop
aesthetic" has moved beyond the traditional cinematic barriers of urban
crime movies and into the work of established white filmmakers, as seen
in two films, _Black_and_White_ and _Ghost_Dog:_The_Way_of_the_Samurai_. 
Aside from that shared sensibility, however, the two films could not be
more different--in intent and quality.
The trailers for James Toback's _Black_and_White_ make it look like a
run-of-the-mill 'hood drama, but Toback has a deeper concern in mind.  As
the title suggests, his film wants to explore the relations between
blacks and whites, namely the influence of hip-hop culture on white
youths--this issue in addition to telling a crime story as a hook.  His
intention is noble, but it's in Toback's execution that he manages to
fail in everything he sets out to do.
Toback makes a fundamental miscalculation in his exploration of
hip-hop-influenced white kids.  While he does stick with a fairly large
core of characters (played by Bijou Phillips, William Lee Scott, Elijah
Wood, Gaby Hoffmann, and Eddie K. Thomas) as they are followed by a
filmmaker (Brooke Shields) doing a documentary on the subject, the focus
of this group is narrow.  The two characters that are given the most
attention--the ones played by Phillips, Scott, and Thomas--are from
wealthy families, and while they say otherwise, it's too easy to read
their embrace of hip-hop culture as an act of rebellion against their
strict parents.  Where are the hip-hop-loving white kids from
lower-income families, the ones who can best relate to rap's common theme
of the ghetto life?
Toback has slightly better luck with the more traditional
cops-and-crooks plot thread, which served as the main selling point in
the trailer.  A college hoops star (Allan Houston of the New York Knicks)
gets caught accepting a bribe to throw a game, and the only way he can
get himself off the hook is to rat out a childhood friend (Power), a
gangsta with aspirations in rap music.  Ben Stiller, as the police
detective on the case, gives the story a manic urgency that it would not
otherwise have, for the inexperience of two other key players--Houston
and Claudia Schiffer, who plays his girlfriend--shows up too clearly on
the screen.  But better performances would not be able to offset the
story's unsatisfying resolution.
Similarly, some smaller pleasures to be found in _Black_and_White_
cannot justify the excess baggage that comes with them.  The
much-discussed, and indeed memorable, mid-film scene between Robert
Downey Jr. (playing Shields' gay husband) and Mike Tyson (playing
himself) isn't worth having to sit through Downey's indulgent theatrics
the rest of the way--especially in the woeful climactic scene between him
and an even worse Shields.  Throwaway cameos, from everyone from Method
Man to Brett Ratner, provide fleeting interest but don't add much to the
mix aside from clutter--which contributes to how one most easily
remembers _Black_and_White_ as being: a mess.
The plot of Jim Jarmusch's _Ghost_Dog_ could easily be ripped from a
standard urban crime film: a hitman (Forest Whitaker, superbly subtle)
working for the mob has his employer turn on him when a hit goes awry. 
But this being a Jarmusch film, there has to be an idiosyncratic twist,
and here it is the hitman's philosophy of living by the code of the
samurai.  Instead of being a quirky gimmick, this character trait
enhances the film, turning what could be an average pulpy yarn into
something at once more solemn and exciting to watch: a poetic meditation
on mortality and honor that delivers the action and suspense of any good
gangster film--all set to a moody rap score (by RZA).  
Unlike _Black_and_White_, which is content to adhere to hip-hop's common
perception--that is, being brash and in-your-face--_Ghost_Dog_ is more
interested in exploring the additional possibilities of the aesthetic's
use.  While that alone doesn't make Jarmusch's film more effective, it
certainly is a major reason why.

Title
Review for Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The (1999)
_The_Messenger:_The_Story_of_Joan_of_Arc_ (R) ** (out of ****)
Although the exact reasons for their estrangement have not been made
public (aside from the catch-all "irreconcilable differences"), after
seeing _The_Messenger_, I can only conclude that Milla Jovovich's
woefully unconvincing performance as the title character was a prominent
reason for director/soon-to-be-ex-husband Luc Besson's split with her. 
Joan of Arc, the legendary teen who guided the French army in their war
against England after hearing a message from God, is the role of a
lifetime for any young actress, calling on its portrayer to run the full
gamut of emotions: spiritual euphoria, steely determination and strength,
and ultimately great sadness.  The role calls for great range, and
Jovovich proves to not have any.  She wears the same look throughout the
entire film: eyes bulged, nostrils flaring, teeth gritted--the latter,
that is, when she's not shrieking at the top of her lungs.  Jovovich is
at her best when asked to use her modeling skills to serve as a blank
presence, as in her previous collaboration with Besson,
_The_Fifth_Element_; and what is in my opinion her defining role--the
slutty French exchange student who stole all of Kelly Bundy's boyfriends
on an episode of _Married..._with_Children_.  Required to do more as she
is in _The_Messenger_, Jovovich is clearly at her worst.
So when Joan meets her end tied to a burning stake, there is no sense of
tragic loss, only one of relief.  But that's clearly Jovovich's fault and
not that of Besson (though he must be blamed for casting with his
crotch), who works overtime to give the film a larger-than-life epic
quality that his heroine lacks.  He actually succeeds in part,
particularly in the visual department; his sometimes-surreal imagery is
divinely haunting.  He also gets some decent work from Jovovich's acting
support; John Malkovich and Faye Dunaway are creepy and creepier,
respectively, as the dauphin of France and his scheming mother-in-law. 
However, Besson makes other questionable choices, such as bringing Joan's
conscience to life in the final act in the form of... Dustin Hoffman. 
His distracting presence undercuts any dramatic momentum and tension
Besson could ever hope to build, with or without Jovovich in the lead.

Title
Review for Life Less Ordinary, A (1997)
A Life Less Ordinary (R) 1/2* (out of ****)
        While the extremely peculiar A Life Less Ordinary does live up to its
title, a more appropriate moniker would be A Movie More Misguided, for this
confused, confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster
from the talented Trainspotting team of director Danny Boyle, producer
Andrew Macdonald, and screenwriter John Hodge.
        At the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and, yes,
ordinary--premise.  After Robert (Boyle regular Ewan McGregor), an aspiring
writer of trashy novels, is fired from his janitorial job at the Naville
Corporation, he kidnaps Naville's (Ian Holm) spoiled daughter Celine
(Cameron Diaz) and holds her for ransom.  The joke here is that Celine is a
willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially, so she
wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the
brains behind the scheme, teaching the inept Robert a thing or two about
kidnapping... and, ultimately (didn't we see this one coming?), love.
        So far, so mediocre.  But mediocre is better than dreadful, which this
film is, thanks in no small part to the Hodge's contextual frame for the
romance.  It turns out that God is displeased with the divorce and romantic
breakup rate on earth, so the chief of Heaven's police, Gabriel (Dan
Hedaya) dispatches two angels, O'Reilly (Holly Hunter) and Jackson (Delroy
Lindo), to earth to hook up Celine and Robert--or lose their angel status.
This conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral
role in the entire picture.  But it could have easily been cut without any
clear loss to the film; as it stands, it is simply a waste of time that
distracts from the romance at hand.
        Not that there is much of a romance to begin with.  Try as Diaz and
McGregor may, Celine and Robert are too one-note to become very endearing
characters.  Celine is rich bitch; Robert is a dullard.  As such, it is
quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again,
they never seem to really connect with each other.  When Celine and Robert
start to overtly act on their "feelings," it comes off more like something
scripted than anything natural.
        But I am not exactly sure if Boyle and company's point was romance;
honestly, I am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish.  Boyle
juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz, but it remains
just that--energy, not energy in service of a story or even acting.  The
cast seems lost, especially Hunter, whose performance is so adrift as to be
baffling.  And then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the
film: some violent confrontations involving the angels, who are not exactly
angelic--in fact, they end up staging their own ransom scheme; some
mystical hokum in the climax; and a cutesy Claymation epilogue.  Watching
much of A Life Less Ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell,
stockpiling quirks in the name of cool.  Instead, the film just gives
quirky a bad name.
        My best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an
atmosphere of warped womantic (yes, misspelling intended) whimsy, which
comes through in only one scene: an extended musical number where Celine
and Robert sing "Beyond the Sea" at a karaoke bar.  After a verse or two,
the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos, and
engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter.  The scene works not
only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try
too hard, just relying on the innate charm of the leads, allowing them to
build a romantic rapport.  Alas, not nearly enough is built, for this
moment comes to an abrupt end.
        I applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses,
but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill.  A Life Less Ordinary
certainly delivers something "different," but by the time the film was
over, I was clamoring for A Life More Ordinary.

Title
Review for Leila (1996)
This subtle and thought-provoking drama from Iran tells the modern-day
story of the title character (Leila Hatami), a young newlywed who forces
her very loving husband Reza (Ali Mosaffa) to take another wife after she
learns she cannot bear children.  The decision, however, is not so much
hers as it is that of her manipulative and selfish mother-in-law (Jamileh
Sheikhi), who plants seeds of doubt in Leila regarding Reza's love and
loyalty; and that of society in general.
Dariush Mehrjui's film may end on a (forced) bittersweet note, but it is
overall a film of great sadness, the tragedy of a love torn apart by each
partner's overeagerness to please the other.  While the relationship
between Leila and Reza is the film's focus, the film belongs to Leila,
beautifully played with great understatement by Hatami.  Her despair and
desperation dominates the film, and the audience feels it quite
intimately--due not only to Hatami's extraordinary work but that of
Mehrjui, who wisely never strays from Leila's point of view, enabling the
viewer to experience her uncertainty and resulting confusion.

Title
Review for Batman & Robin (1997)
Batman and Robin (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
Holy Bat-astrophe!  The Batman film franchise as we know it is dead,
thanks to Batman and Robin, director Joel Schumacher and screenwriter Akiva
Goldsman's campy and most disrespectfully lighthearted reinterpretation of
Bob Kane's Dark Knight.
To most clearly and thoroughly address all that is wrong with this
Bat-flick, I will first review the film character by character:
Bruce Wayne/Batman (George Clooney):  Clooney has gone on record
that his aim in taking on the role of Batman was to wipe off the scowl from
under the cowl and lighten up the Caped Crusader.  Big mistake.  What seems
to be lost on Clooney, Schumacher, and Goldsman is that angst and brooding
is what makes Batman Batman--strip away that and you have in effect stripped
away the meat of the character, not to mention the whole motivation behind
millionaire Bruce's nocturnal adventures in a rubber rodent suit.  So what
Clooney serves up is a not-too-interesting guy with a grin perpetually glued
onto his face, a flat, distant character we have absolutely no insight into
whatsoever.
Dick Grayson/Robin (Chris O'Donnell): I am not a Robin fan; I never
have been, and I probably never will.  However, despite a shaky, whiny
beginning, O'Donnell made me tolerate the Boy Wonder by the end of
Batman Forever by simply calming down.  In Batman and Robin, though, Dick
and Robin are back in ultrawhiny mode, playing up the petty jealousy and
brash youth and naivete which are the very characteristics which annoy
Robin-haters the most.  Presumably, the audience is supposed to sympathize
with Dick/Robin's frustration with not being treated as an adult by
Bruce/Batman, but based on his behavior in the film, there is no reason for
Bruce/Batman to treat Dick/Robin as anything but the whiny kid he comes off as.
Barbara Wilson/Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone): The big problem with
Batgirl is that no one figured out how to fit her into the story.  Unlike
the introduction of Dick/Robin in Forever, which tied directly into the
storyline with Two-Face, Barbara, Alfred's (Michael Gough) niece, simply
turns up on the Wayne Manor doorstep in act one and, in a most superfluous
subplot, is revealed a closet biker chick in act two.  There is an attempt
at convergence in act three, when Barbara becomes Batgirl (though her
ear-less getup makes her more resemble Robingirl) and aids the dynamic duo
in their cause, but her most significant contribution is pulling an Ariana
Richards in Jurassic Park (that is,
hack into a computer).  The zaftig Silverstone is a good enough sport, but
she never appears completely comfortable as either biker Barbara or brainy
Barbara (or, for that matter, in her rubber costume).
Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger): The filmmakers seem the most
confused with how do deal with Dr. Victor Fries.  Schumacher and Goldsman
use the tragic origin for the character from Batman: The Animated
Series--Dr. Fries experimented with cryogenics in an effort to save his
terminally ill wife, Nora (played by supermodel Vendela), but a lab mishap
made him unable to survive in non-freezing temperatures.  Instead of leaving
it at that, in an apparent concession to the casting of Schwarzenegger in
the role, Mr. Freeze is a wisecracker, which is totally at odds with the
tragic depiction that is also presented.  What results is a most jarring
mess of a character.  Case in point: one early scene shows a somber Freeze
wistfully watching old home movies of him
and his wife.  Suddenly, an underling comes in and interrupts his viewing
with some important news.  Freeze turns around in his chair, freezes the guy
with his freezing gun, and quips, "I hate it when people talk during the
movie."  Just what exactly are Schumacher and company going after here?
Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman): The one character that is the slightest bit
done right is that of seductive eco-terrorist Pamela Isley--but it's more
due to Thurman's lively performance than anything done by the filmmakers.
Like Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman in Batman Returns (though not nearly as
good), Thurman has a firm grasp on the key to her character: she's not a
vamp, she's a natural wallflower acting like a vamp--thus the act is that
much more extreme.  Thurman pulls it off beautifully, but, in the end, even
she's not immune to Schumacher and Goldsman's camp.  For a gifted scientist,
her master plan--to populate the world with toothed, tongued plants that
come straight out of Little
Shop of Horrors--is idiotic.
Bane (Jeep Swenson): Idiotic doesn't quite cover what is done to the
character of Bane, who definitely is the most ruined character in this film
treatment.  In the Batman comics, Bane is Batman's ultimate challenge--not
only is he physically stronger than Bruce Wayne, he is also smarter.  The
problem is that the venom which coarses through his veins makes him crazy.
In Batman and Robin, the only thing left of Bane comic fans know and love is
his bulk and the venom.  Bane is nothing more than a generic, grunting,
intelligence-impaired, muscled henchman to Poison Ivy.  The saddest thing
about the raping of Bane, he being a rather recent addition to the Batman
comic universe, is that most
mainstream moviegoers won't even know that anything has been done wrong.
Schumacher and Goldsman's wrongdoing do not end with the characters.
Their most heinous crime is the overwhelming atmosphere of camp, from Batman
pulling out a Bat-credit card during an auction to Mr. Freeze's bunny
slippers, polar bear pajamas, and freezer full of frozen dinners.
Schumacher has said that he wanted to "put some 'comic' back in comic book,"
but he forgets what comic book he's dealing with--Batman, which is a "comic"
book in name only.  In camping everything up, Schumacher, who claims to be a
comic book fan, just reinforces the most widely held stereotype about
comics--that they're just for kids.  The irony is, of course, that the film
Batman and Robin is more juvenile than any Batman comic you'd find on the
stands today.
I can go on about what is wrong with Batman and Robin, but I must give
some credit where credit is due.  B&R does boast the most impressive visual
effects of the series; effects supervisor John Dykstra (of the recently
closed Warner Bros. effects house) comes up with some very convincing for
Freeze's freezing weapons and Ivy's pheremone dust.  Production designer
Barbara Ling provides another striking vision of Gotham, with its towering
buildings and statues.  And, yes, I guess I can say something "positive"
about Schumacher's work--he's an equal opportunity exploiter.  Not only are
we treated to a Batman and Robin suiting-up sequence filled with butt,
crotch, and chest shots, their female counterpart is similarly exploited
when she gets her chance to suit up.
The most telling indication of Batman & Robin's shoddiness is the
audience reaction at the screening I attended.  When the lights dimmed and
the curtain rose, the crowd cheered, and it applauded the names of the five
main stars.   When the film ended with the image of Batman, Robin, and
Batgirl running in front of the Batsignal, there was a smattering of tepid
applause, but mostly boos.  Let the Bat-lash begin.

Title
Review for Almost Heroes (1998)
While he had a number of memorably funny moments during his starmaking
stint on _Saturday_Night_Live_, the late Chris Farley's big-screen starring
vehicles--_Tommy_Boy_, _Black_Sheep_, and _Beverly_Hills_Ninja_--ranged
from bad, worse, to amusingly bad.  Sad to say, his final film,
_Almost_Heroes_, is every bit as sloppily made as his previous starring
efforts--a virtually laugh-free comedy that puts a sad end to the woefully
lackluster screen career of a talented comic.
It's hard to believe that Christopher Guest, who directed last year's
smart and funny mockumentary _Waiting_for_Guffman_, helmed this disastrous
enterprise.  Then again, no director could have salvaged the witless script
by Mark Nutter, Tom Wolfe, and Boyd Hale.  Matthew Perry and Farley play
Leslie Edwards and Bartholmew (sic) Hunt, two explorers determined to beat
the legendary Lewis and Clark to the Pacific Northwest territories in 1804.
 Needless to say, the effete Edwards and the boorish Hunt are in over their
heads, falling into a number of precarious, would-be comic situations (such
as running into a merry band of evil conquistadors) en route to the
Pacific.  The odd-couple teaming of Perry and Farley sounds promising, but
the two generate little comic chemistry.  While this is partly the fault of
the actors (a distracted-looking Perry seems more concerned over
maintaining his uppity New England accent than selling one-liners), the
script never gives them much opportunity to play off their contrasting
comedic styles--Perry's deadpan wit and Farley's wild physicality.
Instead, the writers succumb to the lazy trap that befell the scribes
behind Farley's previous starring vehicles--jam as many "fat guy falls
down" gags as possible.
This time around, though, these obvious gags have an underlying tone of
sadness, since Farley's frustration with such gags has become well-noted
after his death.  Even more troubling are the gags centering on Hunt's
alcohol consumption.   These jokes would have been only moderately amusing
at best had Farley lived to see this film's release, but in light of the
substance abuse-related circumstances of his death, the gags come off even
cheaper, not to mention all the more insulting to the late star.
In my review for another unscreened-for-critics (wonder why) from Warner
Bros., the awful _Major_League:_Back_to_the_Minors_, I noted that not even
the guy in the audience who laughs at just about anything let out a single
chuckle throughout the movie.  The most I can say about _Almost_Heroes_ is
that the laughing guy was back in his element, greeting many a joke with
explosions of laughter.  Everyone else, though, was stonefaced and
silent--at least those strong enough to not walk out of the auditorium.

Title
Review for Onegin (1999)
Only a couple weeks after Neil Jordan's wrenchingly beautiful
_The_End_of_the_Affair_ comes another Ralph Fiennes-starring period
romance adaptation, based on the verse novel by Alexander Pushkin.  In
1820s Russia, the arrogant city-bred sophisticate Evgeny Onegin (Fiennes)
moves to a country estate bequeathed to him by his late uncle.  There, he
becomes the object of admiration for Tatyana (Liv Tyler), sister to the
fiancée (Lena Headey) of his neighbor Vladimir (Toby Stephens).  Onegin
rejects Tatyana, and a tragedy leads him to travel abroad for years; upon
his return, he suddenly feels affection for her, but it may be too late.
Thus the stage is set for grand romantic tragedy, but there's a bigger
difference between _Affair_ and this film than the setting and the
co-star.  Where that film was fiery and passionate, director Martha
Fiennes (yes, Ralph's sister; another Fiennes sibling, Magnus, provided
the score) takes the approach of Onegin--cold and distant.  That
principle is applied to the pacing as well, making the film that much
less involving, even though the two leads--in particular the radiant
Tyler, very at home in period garb--do admirable acting jobs.

Title
Review for Shooting Fish (1997)
Shooting Fish (PG) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
Dylan (Dan Futterman) and Jez (Stuart Townsend) have made a career out of
"shooting fish"--i.e. pulling off con jobs.  Dylan is the cocky
smooth-talking Yank who masterminds each elaborate schemes; the Burt
Bacharach-loving Jez is the socially-impaired British technogeek whose
electronic wizardry makes such swindles possible.  A host of complications,
romantic and otherwise, arise after sweet medical student Georgie (Kate
Beckinsale) joins their fold, helping the boys out in the belief that the
illegally-obtained proceeds go toward building an orphanage.
Director/co-writer (with Richard Holmes) Stefan Schwartz has crafted a
light, easy-going fluff piece whose pleasance is elevated by the appeal of
the top trio of actors, particularly the pixie-tressed Beckinsale.
Unfortunately, her main subplot about a loveless engagement is so poorly
developed it seems like an afterthought, even as it eventually takes center
stage toward film's end.  But the more curious miscalculation is that, for
a comedy, Shooting Fish is rather light on real laughs.  There's a sly dig
at the musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber, but a number of the big con scenes
are more amusing than funny.  However, there is a certain amount of charm
about the film, which is as agreeable as it is refreshingly unpretentious.

Title
Review for B. Monkey (1998)
He is Alan (Jared Harris), elementary school teacher by day, volunteer
hospital disc jockey by night.  She is Beatrice (Asia Argento), who, when
not sitting at a desk for a nondescript company, is the best jewel thief
in London.  Somehow, some way, these two fall in love.  Which leads to
the question--why?
_B._Monkey_, named for the heroine's criminal moniker, only
satisfactorily answers one half of that question.  It is easy to see why
Alan would be so taken with Beatrice when he first spots her in a
pub--she is an exotic Italian beauty, and the sexy spunk that Alan
discovers once he gets to know her just adds to her allure.  In a sense,
it is also fairly easy to understand why Beatrice would initially be
drawn to Alan.  Tired of the criminal life, Beatrice wants to go
straight, and the square Alan presents the ultimate act of rebellion
against rebellion.
Their romance shows Beatrice the joy of a normal life, but it does not
convince the audience quite so easily.  Chalk it up to Alan and Harris'
dry portrayal--he's nice and stable, all right, but did he have to be so
boring?  Beatrice's relationship with Alan may be more functional than
that with her former roommates and partners-in-crime, drug dealer Paul
(Rupert Everett) and his lover Bruno (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), but it's
also considerably less interesting.
So it's no surprise that _B._Monkey_ springs back to life whenever Paul
and Bruno reenter the picture, and when Beatrice's ties with them pulls
her back into the game.  Of course, she goes along with it with great
reluctance and hates every minute.  However, it would have been more
compelling if scripters Michael Thomas and Chloe King added a bit more
conflict--that is, when put back in the pressure cooker, Beatrice felt
some of the thrill that kept her in crime for so long.  One would think
she would, yet she doesn't, completely "cured" by Alan's love.
_B._Monkey_, director Michael Radford's follow-up to 1995's 
_Il_Postino_, had been sitting on Miramax's shelf for the better part of
two years, and that's more than likely due to the film's many differences
with that beloved Oscar-winner.  Aside from the obvious differences in
tone and style, it is also, quite simply, just not nearly as effective a
love story; it's a cold piece of machinery from a filmmaker whose last
film moviegoers recall with great warmth.

Title
Review for Waterboy, The (1998)
The premise is as absurd as one would expect from an Adam Sandler vehicle:
Bobby Boucher (Sandler), a softspoken 31-year-old college football
waterboy, becomes a gridiron star himself as a lean, mean tackling machine.
 However, what makes this film more tolerable than most of Sandler's
previous work is that his character isn't such a prick.  Bobby is nice, if
more than a little naive, guy who, above all else, loves his domineering
mother (Kathy Bates, who should do more comedy), with whom he still lives
in a backwoods cabin.
That said, _The_Waterboy_ is the definition of an "average" film--a
hit-and-miss affair that in neither bad nor especially good.  For every
chuckle-worthy gag (Bobby's mother's taste for, to put it lightly, exotic
cuisine), there's another that never gets off the ground (a perpetually
drunk cheerleading squad).  The familiar sports movie formula (a big,
climactic game) gets a workout here, but it does have some charm in this
context.  And, of course, there's Sandler's mugging, which can be either
amusing or flat-out annoying.  In short, _The_Waterboy_ exactly what the
trailers and TV commercials advertise.  Based on those, you should know
whether or not this film's your cup of tea (or, rather, H2O).

_A_Map_of_the_World_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of an Iowa farm wife/school nurse accused
of child abuse is indeed worthy of all the accolades it has received,
most notably a Golden Globe nomination.  The role of Alice Goodwin is an
exceedingly difficult one; her portrayer must have enough of a dark side
to make the accusations plausible while at the same time remain likable
enough to make the audience care.  Weaver's achievement is not only
pulling off the balance but making a real person.
        Unfortunately, Scott Elliott's film as a whole is far less convincing. 
_A_Map_of_the_World_ is the second in the new subgenre of drama I call
"the Oprah film": a woman faces adversity of a domestic nature in a story
usually coming from a novel on Oprah's book club list.  That should tell
you how gooey with sentiment the film is, not to mention the outcome of
the entire affair.  Nonetheless, Weaver and the rest of the stellar
cast--which also includes Julianne Moore, David Strathairn, Arliss
Howard, and Chloë Sevigny--do their best, even while saddled with some
very "movie" dialogue (e.g., a sobbing Moore laments, "It's amazing how
much a person can cry!").

Title
Review for Hak hap (1996)
After stealing the show from Mel Gibson and company in _Lethal_Weapon 4_,
it was only a matter of time before American distributors started invading
the vault of Jet Li's Hong Kong work.  The first of what is sure to be a
long line of wide American releases is _Black_Mask_, a gritty, hyperstylish
1996 adventure that plugs Li's talents into a superhero yarn.  However, as
fun and exciting as the film often is, it is far from Li's best showcase.
That distinction belongs to _Fist_of_Legend_, an electrifying 1994
reworking of the Bruce Lee vehicle _The_Chinese_Connection_ whose American
distribution (through Quentin Tarantino's Rolling Thunder Pictures) was
scrapped.  However, it is easy to see why _Black_Mask_ ended up as his
first HK effort to widely reach U.S. screens.  It isn't so much that the
film is a diverting entertainment (which it certainly is), but that it is
one of Li's few actioners set in contemporary times.  Most of his
high-flying films, from _Fist_of Legend_ to his starmaking
_Once_Upon_a_Time_in_China_ series, were set in period China--not exactly
inaccessible to Yank audiences considering the amount of action in these
films, but a difficult sell nonetheless.
_Black_Mask_ is much more easily marketable: a dark, extremely violent
comic-book-style adventure where Li plays Tsui, a medically-enhanced
supersoldier who escapes the shady outfit that created him.  He attempts to
live a quiet existence as a pacificist librarian, but soon he jolted back
to action when his former cohorts have taken to killing off all of Hong
Kong's drug lords.  His identity kept a secret under a black mask (hence
the title), Tsui, with the reluctant help of aptly named policeman Rock
(Lau Ching Wan), attempts to set things right.
_Black_Mask_ has much more of a technical sheen than any of Jackie Chan's
fun yet rather crudely produced HK imports.  The English dubbing job is
actually competently done (Li doesn't do his own dialogue, but his stand-in
does an adequate job).  There is some inventive production and costume
design, as well as some often stunning cinematography.  Director Daniel
Lee's strong suit is definitely his visual style, which appears to be
influenced by the frenetic camera techniques of Michael Bay.
While the glossy approach keeps the film never less than visually
stimulating, it also shortchanges the many fight sequences, which, of
course, are what people see Jet Li films for.  Granted, no amount of
MTV-style editing can rob Li's acrobatic martial arts skills of their
electrifying effect, but the quick cuts do dilute it a bit.  One is left in
greater awe when one is actually able to see what Li can and does
do--without any flashy frills.
But until _Fist_of_Legend_ or any of his better showcases--such as
_Once_Upon_a_Time_in_China_, _Fong_Sai-Yuk_, or _The_Tai-Chi_Master_, the
latter which co-stars _Tomorrow_Never_Dies_ scene stealer Michelle Yeoh--is
made available to the masses (those films are all available, though on a
fairly limited basis, on video), _Black_Mask_ nicely gets the job done as
either a showcase for Jet Li's athletic talents or an undemanding blast of
action and mayhem.

Title
Review for Saint, The (1997)
After briefly trying on the cowl of the caped crusader, Val Kilmer
has found a role that's an even better fit for his blend of charisma and
cockiness--master thief The Saint.  It's too bad the rest of Phillip Noyce's
big budget update of the Leslie Charteris character is so mediocre that
future adventures seem far from likely.
Kilmer perfectly embodies Simon Templar, an ace thief, master of
disguise, and all-around rogue who uses his charms and quick wit to ensnare
any woman for his personal gain.  For the first time, Simon reaches a crisis
of conscience when he develops genuine feelings for scientist Dr. Emma
Russell (Elisabeth Shue), who holds the commodity which he has been hired by
a mafia-affiliated Russian billionaire (Rade Serbedzija) to steal--a working
formula for cold fusion.
Kilmer has a perfect grasp on the character, pulling off convincing
accents in his different guises (the fairly plain makeup work, however, does
leave something to be desired), and keeping a great sense of humor
throughout.  Simon is not only good at what he does, but he has a lot of fun
doing it.  On the other side of the token, there's the completely miscast
Shue.  Emma is supposed to be kooky yet so brilliant as to perfect a formula
that many scientists have been trying to discover for years.  We first meet
Emma when she lectures a class on cold fusion.  The scene is absolutely
crucial to establishing the credibility of the character, and Shue blows it.
She plays up the character's quirks and nervous foibles, and any hint of
real intelligence is lost in the process.  Instead of being brilliant yet
kooky, Emma is just kooky--kooky and vacuous.
The character of Emma also gets short shrift from screenwriters
Jonathan Hensleigh and Wesley Strick.  One of Emma's key defining traits is
a heart ailment she's had since childhood, and early on a lot is made of her
need for medication.  But lo and behold, act three rolls around and suddenly
Emma's heart condition is written off in a single line of dialogue.
Hensleigh and Strick also don't give any convincing reasons as to why Simon
would feel any differently about Emma than any of the other women he's used.
The implication is that Emma "understands" the real Simon, but their
relationship isn't developed thoroughly enough to make that clear.
The lackluster romance shouldn't come as too big a surprise, since
The Saint is directed by Noyce, a skilled craftsman whose work, most
recently the Jack Ryan films Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger and
the voyeuristic thriller Sliver, is characterized by their technical
achievement and emotional chilliness.  Noyce creates a number of exciting
and suspenseful moments, in particular an extended chase midway, and the
film is visually enthralling.  But with the "heart" of the picture, the
romance between Simon and Emma, so unconvincing, it's easy to just be
superficially interested in the picture without really caring about the
people involved.
Simon Templar is an interesting character with infinite promise as
the protagonist in a series of films, and Val Kilmer is the perfect man for
the job, but based on this unexceptional initial outing, Kilmer may soon
regret giving up his Batman meal ticket.

Title
Review for Recess: School's Out (2001)
        At one point in this film, an adult character says something
along the lines of, "Even grown-ups know the value of recess." 
Similarly, the appeal of _Recess:_School's_Out_, a big-screen extension
of the popular TV cartoon series, won't be lost on the older viewers in
the audience.  Make no mistake--this is a film made for the kiddies, and
it's the young 'uns who will take the most from the animated antics.  But
there's enough likable qualities displayed here to keep the parents
interested though not entirely bowled over.
        Part of the problem is the film's no-frills animation style, that
makes the film look exactly like what it is: a big-screen blowup of a
Saturday morning cartoon.  Even the _Rugrats_ films exhibited some
greater ambition with its visuals, however slight.  Here, all we get are
a couple of too-obviously computer-generated overhead shots, one for the
very beginning, and one for the very end.  Making matters worse is the
fact that the CG shots hardly feel of a piece with the traditionally
drawn bulk of the film.
        This complaint is of little consequence to the target audience,
who will certainly eat up this amusing kids' fantasy.  As the title
suggests, school is out, and mischievous T.J. Detweiler (voiced by Andy
Lawrence) is looking forward to a summer of fun with friends Gus
(Courtland Mead), Gretchen (Ashley Johnson), Vince (Rickey D'Shon
Collins), Mikey (Jason Davis), and Spinelli (Pamela Segall).  However,
that doesn't appear it will be the case, for he is the only one of the
gang not going to a special camp for the summer.  But when he stumbles
upon an evil plot involving what appears to be a large laser cannon (!)
being cooked up within the closed walls of Third Street Elementary, T.J.
must break out his friends to set things right.
        The kid-aimed story is interesting and fast-paced enough to keep
the adults somewhat amused, but there are also touches in
_Recess:_School's_Out_ blatantly designed to  engage the adults: an
extended flashback to the late-'60s-set early careers of Third Street
Principal Prickly (Dabney Coleman) and the main bad guy, a former
secretary of education (James Woods); and an especially effective running
gag involving Mikey's impressively developed singing voice (provided by
Robert Goulet).  But when it all comes down to it, the comedic fights
(some involving ninjas) and slapsticky chases that make up most of
_Recess:_School's_Out_ were meant for viewers that are in the same age
range as the main characters, and unless you have kids, there's nothing
here that's compelling enough to merit buying a ticket.

Title
Review for Bound (1996)
Bound (R) **** (out of ****)
        On paper, the noir thriller Bound did not seem like the most
promising of cinematic prospects.  Writers-directors Larry and Andy
Wachowski's only other major credit was for writing Richard Donner's
entertaining but overblown Assassins; lead Jennifer Tilly has a tendency to
be grating, to say the least; and co-star Gina Gershon was just coming off
her overwrought camp queen turn in Showgirls.  But thanks to a clever
script, strong performances, and very accomplished direction, Bound is one
of the year's biggest surprises.
        I thought my low expectations were being met during the film's first
twenty minutes, in which mafia moll Violet (Tilly) tries to seduce the
lesbian grease monkey ex-con (Gershon) next door.  With Tilly delivering her
come-hither lines in an even softer, squeakier voice than usual and
Gershon's Corky keeping one eyebrow perpetually raised, these opening scenes
play like Showgirls 2; in fact, some of the dialogue is reminiscent of the
infamous "tit" discussion scene in Joe Eszterhas's notorious script.
Needless to say, Violet and Corky finally do end up in bed, and the big sex
scene is actually done very discreetly and tastefully though it still
elicited some giggles from the audience.
        These opening moments are something of a joke.  It's as if the
Wachowskis knew expactly what the audience was expecting--cheesy lesbian
sex--so they delivered it in all its campy glory.  But in doing so, it gets
that lesbian angle out of the way quickly, so when the main plot does get
into gear, the audience is not distracted by the anticipation of the big sex
scene.  As laughable as the opening minutes are, they are key to
understanding the relationship between the two women, and they take on a
greater dimension in retrospect as the movie unfolds.
        After the sex scene, the tone quickly shifts, and the main plot is
set into motion.  Violet, fed up with the violent antics of her boyfriend,
mob launderer Ceasar (Joe Pantoliano), wants to leave him--but not without
absconding with $2,000,000 of the mob's cash.  And who does she enlist to
help her in her scheme?  Why, none other than Corky, who cooks up a
"foolproof" plan to steal the cash and frame Ceasar for the theft.  However,
you know what they say about the best laid plans of mice and men...
        This all sounds fairly formulaic, and, to a certain extent, it is.
But what makes Bound so special is the work of the Wachowski brothers.
Their script piles on twist after twist and close call after close call, and
the developments are very believable and not out of left field.  For
example, in a particularly suspenseful scene, a mob figure (John P. Ryan)
breaks out a set of lockpicks to open a locked case, much to the shock of
Ceasar; this revelation does not come off as gimmicky because, earlier, he
nonchalantly unlocked a door without a key.  The Wachowskis pay close
attention to those little details, ones that the audience does not typically
pick up on, using them to rattle the audience later on without insulting
their intelligence.
        Another refreshing aspect of the script is the presence of three
strong and intelligent characters.  At first, it appears as if Corky is the
only one with brains, but as the film progresses Violet and especially
Ceasar prove to be not nearly as dumb as they appear, giving just as good as
they get.  The casting of Tilly and Pantoliano is perfect; Tilly's squeaky
voice and Pantoliano's New Yawk accent and buffoonish demeanor would make it
easy for someone to underestimate them.
        As well-crafted as their script is, the Wachowskis energize it with
a hefty dose of style.  The film is always visually interesting, using
varieties of camera angles and movements, occasionally venturing into
slow-mo without overusing it.  One of their more interesting touches is
aping certain visual cues from other films and putting their own twisted
spin on them: Jurassic Park's famous image of quivering water is
duplicated--in a toilet bowl; and the bravura opening shot of Krzysztof
Kieslowski's Red, which travels along long-distance telephone lines, is
evoked in a clever and hilarious way.  Unlike some directors, who go for the
good-looking shot, plot credibility be damned, the Wachowskis come up with
some stunners that work well within the story, such as when a person gets
shot while standing in a pool of white paint, eventually falling in.  It's a
great-looking image, with the blood clashing against the white, but the
presence of the paint is explained by the fact that, earlier in the film,
Corky is shown painting her apartment.
        Bound has just come off of a tour of various film festivals,
becoming an audience favorite at every one of them.  As it embarks on its
run in (mainly arthouse) theatres, I am sure it will become a favorite of
everyone fortunate enough to be sitting in the auditorium.

Title
Review for Glass House, The (2001/I)
_The_Glass_House_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
        Even if the trailer didn't give away darn near every turn of its plot,
one would still have had an easy time predicting the course of events in
_The_Glass_House_.  A formulaic film that is more typical than terrible,
_The_Glass_House_ still makes for frustrating viewing, given the level of talent
involved.
        Topping that list is Leelee Sobieski, whose natural poise lends the
preposterous proceedings a certain level of credibility.  Her Ruby Baker is
introduced as a rebellious high schooler, but she quickly becomes more
well-behaved when her and her younger brother Rhett's (Trevor Morgan) parents
are killed in a mysterious auto accident.  Ruby and Rhett are then put in the
care of wealthy family friends Terry (Stellan Skarsgĺrd) and Erin (Diane Lane)
Glass, who not only live in a large hilltop home made of (yes) glass, one of
their cars has the license plate "24KGLSS."  With all the heavy-handed
symbolism, could it be possible that this newly formed household could be in
danger of being shattered by a stone?
        But of course, and after Ruby rather conveniently happens upon some
suspicious conversations involving Terry, she finds out that her new guardians
don't have the most crystal clear of intentions.  Director Daniel Sackheim, who
cut his helming teeth on numerous episodes of _The_X-Files_, somehow manages to
generate an air of suspense even if he sometimes too easily falls in the trap of
dropping shady "hints" with all the subtlety and grace of a trowel.  Ultimately,
Sackheim and his able cast cannot overcome the increasingly overdone twists of
Wesley Strick's script (based on his output since, one wonders just how much of
the gripping 1991 _Cape_Fear_ remake was his doing and not director Martin
Scorsese's).  Did an unexceptional, unsurprising thriller need to morph into
another one of those films with a villain that just won't die?
        Then again, that's just another example of how by-the-numbers and
off-the-rack _The_Glass_House_ is.  Sobieski does intermittently rise above the
occasion, doing what she can with the film's only halfway-realistic role; some
usually reliable co-stars fare less well: Skarsgĺrd gives in to the histrionics
of the script too easily while Lane is stymied by a role that's a nonentity on
the page.  Perhaps Lane's part is most reflective of the whole of the film:
neither here nor there, and easily forgotten.

Title
Review for Cradle Will Rock (1999)
1999 appears to be the year where filmmakers pay tribute to the
entertainment medium that paved the way for celluloid: theater.  This
summer saw the release of John Turturro's stage-set _Illuminata_, and
opening this month are Mike Leigh's _Topsy-Turvy_ and Tim Robbins'
_Cradle_Will_Rock_.  All films bear their own unique qualities (on a
basic level, _Illuminata_ is a complete fiction, while _Topsy-Turvy_ and
_Cradle_ both have some grounding in historical fact), but Robbins' film
stands apart in that in addition to providing a portrait of the New York
stage circa the 1930s, it also aims to capture the political climate at
the time.  It's a grand ambition, but Robbins is able to pull it off, if
only in the end.
While politics loom large over the film, Robbins, as one well knows, is
an actor himself, and thus the theatre plays no small part in _Cradle_. 
The film is titled for _The_Cradle_Will_Rock_, a politically-themed,
pro-labor-union musical composed by one Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria). 
The production, directed by a tempestuous young Orson Welles (Angus
Macfadyen), is the focal storyline of the film, but it's also not the
only one.  Elsewhere, wealthy Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack)
commissions Mexican artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) to paint a mural
in the lobby of his new building.  Margherita Sarfatti (Susan Sarandon),
a representative for Mussolini, gives valuable paintings to millionaires,
one of whom is one Grey Mathers (Philip Baker Hall), in return for their
support of the Italian war effort.  The American government conducts
hearings that will determine the future of the Federal Theatre Project,
which is valiantly defended by its head, Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones);
but helped taken down by a low-ranking employee (Joan Cusack), who in
turn is pursued romantically by a ventriloquist (Bill Murray).
With so many characters and so much going on, _Cradle_Will_Rock_
meanders with no clear agenda for most of its running time.  As messy as
it gets, the proceedings are kept watchable by the work of the stellar
cast, which also includes Emily Watson, John Turturro, Vanessa Redgrave,
and Cary Elwes.  Everyone does a fine job with their roles--though Jones
impresses the most.  The actors also have an infectious ball working
together; pairing two live wires like Cusack and Murray proves to be an
especially inspired move on the part of Robbins.  Even so, as the film
bounces between characters and plot threads, interest flags at times.
But all the disparate elements and ideas in Robbins' screenplay
gradually weave together and then cement into a rousing climax that
powerfully makes its points about the importance of artistic freedom.  In
the end, _Cradle_Will_Rock_ proves to be a very apt title; it sways
haphazardly for a while, but it does eventually find its steady rhythm.
At two hours and forty minutes, _Topsy-Turvy_ runs about a half hour
longer than _Cradle_Will_Rock_, but writer-director Leigh doesn't take
quite as long as Robbins does to find his film's footing.  A lot of that
has to do with _Topsy_'s more modest ambitions; Leigh only aims to make a
light tribute to the genius of the musical team of lyricist/librettist
William Schwenck Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and composer Arthur Sullivan
(Allan Corduner).  And Leigh has succeeded in a most delightful way,
offering a witty and engrossing behind-the-curtain look at the rocky
making of one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most celebrated works,
_The_Mikado_.  Broadbent and Corduner are the stars of this film show and
both do a splendid job (in particular Corduner), but what makes the film
an especially enjoyable romp are the supporting players who do a
wonderful job of performing selected scenes from the actual musicals. 
The long but snappily-paced _Topsy-Turvy_ isn't as deep or "important" a
work as Leigh's best-known film, the Oscar-nominated _Secrets_&_Lies_,
but it certainly a lot more fun--which is the point.  (_Topsy-Turvy_
opens December 17)

Title
Review for Return to Paradise (1998)
_Return_to_Paradise_ (R) *** (out of ****)
Give up three years of your life or let a friend hang.  That is the moral
dilemma facing two young men in _Return_to_Paradise_, a largely intriguing
drama whose by-the-numbers paces are elevated to a higher level by the
strong acting ensemble.
Sheriff (Vince Vaughn), Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix), and Tony (David Conrad)
meet and bond during a month-long vacation in Malaysia, where they engage
in all the pleasures "paradise" offers them: women, booze, and especially
cheap hashish.  When the month expires, Sheriff and Tony return home,
leaving Lewis, who stays--in a not completely convincing plot point--to
study endangered orangutans.  Two years later, Sheriff and Tony, both in
New York, learn from attorney Beth Eastern (Anne Heche) that Lewis has
spent the ensuing years in a Malaysian prison, awaiting hanging for drug
possession.  According to Beth, if both Sheriff and Tony return to Malaysia
and share responsibility for the hash, Lewis's life would be spared.  In
turn, however, they would also have to serve, along with Lewis, three years
of hard time.
It's an intriguing moral dilemma, but with the unfortunate title
_Return_to_Paradise_ (the film's original, comparatively less snappy title
was _Force_Majeure_, the name of the 1990 French film on which it is
loosely based), the decision that Sheriff and Tony arrive at appears to be
a foregone conclusion, and director Joseph Ruben's slack pacing of Wesley
Strick and Bruce Robinson's competent script does not add much in terms of
suspense.  Thus the effectiveness of the piece is reliant on the actors,
and it is their effort that elevates _Return_to_Paradise_ into something
special.  The slick, selfish Sheriff follows a predictable character arc,
but his evolution is made natural and involving by the charismatic Vaughn.
He shares a nice rapport with Heche, who, after displaying her flair for
light comedy earlier this summer in _Six_Days,_Seven_Nights_, shows she has
strong dramatic abilities to match.  As touching as she is, the emotional
linchpin of the film is Phoenix, who creates a highly sympathetic and
tragic figure with a minimum of screen time.  Of the cast, Jada Pinkett
Smith comes off the least impressively, but that's mostly due to her
shallowly written and developed character, M.J. Major, an ambitious
reporter bent on creating an sensational international incident with
Lewis's case.
_Return_to_Paradise_ is not a great film, but its weighty concerns and the
care and craft with which they are addressed make it a diverting dramatic
oasis in the substance-parched late summer movie season.

Title
Review for Misérables, Les (1998)
Les Miserables (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
The calendar year has not even reached its midway point, but that hasn't
prevented Columbia Pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more
befitting of the winter Oscar-bait season.  Bille August's high-profile
adaptation of Victor Hugo's classic Les Miserables delivers everything one
would expect from a classy Hollywood epic--handsome production values,
strong performances by a top-notch cast, a literate screenplay--with one
critically missing element: emotional sweep.
For those not familiar with Hugo's original novel or the hit stage musical
it inspired, the hook of Les Miserables essentially boils down to something
like a 19th-century French-set version of The Fugitive.  After serving 19
years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread, the brutish Jean
Valjean (Liam Neeson) is paroled.  Immediately upon release, he steals
valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night; he
is caught by authorities, only to be forgiven by the bishop, who lets
Valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow.
That he does, and in doing so breaks his parole, which sets the obsessively
determined Inspector Javert (Geoffrey Rush), who was one of the guards in
Valjean's prison camp, on his trail.
Thematically, however, Les Miserables is a story about redemption, which
Valjean finds through his dealings with two women, the hard-luck
factory-worker-turned-prostitute Fantine (Uma Thurman), and her
illegitimate daughter, Cosette.  Years after breaking parole, Valjean
becomes mayor of the town of Vigau, where he forms a warm friendship with
Fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by Javert.  Valjean promises
the gravely ill Fantine he will rescue the young Cosette (Mimi Newman) from
her cruel caretakers, the Thenardiers, and raise the child as his own.  The
"father" and "daughter" eventually land in Paris, where the teenage Cosette
(Claire Danes) falls for dashing student revolutionary Marius (Hans Matheson).
The decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of,
and the Danish August turns in his most accomplished English-language work,
following the underrated 1994 superstar soap The House of the Spirits and
last year's stylish but highly preposterous mystery Smilla's Sense of Snow.
 He and screenwriter Rafael Yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear
focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace.  Production designer Anna
Asp, costume designer Gabriella Pescucci, and cinematographer Jorgen
Persson give Les Miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is
mostly matched by the efforts of the cast.  Neeson is commanding yet
endearingly vulnerable; Rush's finely modulated menace is far more
rewarding than his overrated, Oscar-winning theatrics in Shine; and Thurman
disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role.  The younger members of
the cast fare less well.  Danes is convincing as Cosette, but her overdone
lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction; and Matheson,
while competent, is a less interesting Robert Sean Leonard.
As technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is, by the time Les
Miserables was over, my emotions had only been superficially involved.
While I was touched by Valjean's relationships with Fantine and Cosette, I
was not moved.  Not even reaching the "touching" level is the
Cosette-Marius pairing.  My only previous experience with Les Miserables is
with the musical (as I am sure many others' is), and I was dismayed to see
Eponine, a friend of Marius's who selflessly dies in the name of her
unspoken love for him, almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation
(the daughter of the Thenardiers, here she is only briefly seen as a
child).  Her presence would have added some much-needed conflict and
emotional heft to the youthful romance, but I suppose August and Yglesias
felt one tragic heroine (Fantine) was enough.
Even so, as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season, Les Miserables is
a thoughtful, well-made, entertaining film, one that will sate moviegoers
hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex.

Title
Review for Gattaca (1997)
Gattaca (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
        What if the world somehow found a way to make discrimination into a
science?  That is the provocative question presented by Gattaca, the
intriguing and atmospheric debut of writer-director Andrew Niccol.
        Those looking for a more effects-laden science fiction film will be
disappointed by Gattaca, which centers more on drama than on pricey
pyrotechnics.  Set in "the not-too distant future," the film is set in a
society where one's station in life is determined solely by genetics.
Advances in genetic engineering have made natural breeding obsolete; to
ensure a promising future for their children, prospective parents turn to
geneticists to create their babies in a lab, where they take the most
desirable genetic traits of the parents--and weed out their most
undesirable--to create a "perfect" child.  This genetic elite, called
"Valid," are given all the golden opportunities in life--jobs,
wealth--while the "In-valids," those created from natural breeding, make up
the poor lower class.
        One of these "faith children," as they are called, is Vincent Freeman
(Ethan Hawke), a precocious young man who dreams of flying to the stars.
Even though his genetic makeup makes it impossible for him to realize his
dream, he does so anyway--by dealing with a black market DNA broker (Tony
Shalhoub), who arranges Vincent to swap places with Jerome Morrow (played
with scene-stealing gusto by Jude Law), a valid whose genes are of no use
after being paralyzed from the waist down.  As Jerome, Vincent builds a
successful career at the aeronautics corporation Gattaca and is all set to
fly on a mission to Titan, one of Saturn's moons.  But after the director
of Gattaca is murdered, and an In-valid eyelash is found in the ensuing
investigation, it seems like only a matter of time before "Jerome" is exposed.
        Much of this material harkens back to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, but
I must give credit to Niccol, who paints a vivid, funny, yet disturbing
portrait of this future society.  The best moments come from the little
details in the script.  For example, when Vincent is born, the doctors can
immediately determine his lifespan and what illnesses he is likely to
suffer from; In-valids are sometimes referred to by the slur
"de-gene-erate"; and some rather curious dating rituals: when Vincent
expresses interest in Valid but slightly imperfect colleague Irene (a
strangely uninteresting Uma Thurman, in a thankless role), she offers him a
strand of her hair for a DNA check and says, "Let me know if you're still
interested."  Niccol's fascinating vision also extends to the striking
cinematography, production and costume design by Slawomir Idziak, Jan
Roelfs, and Colleen Atwood, respectively.  They obviously did not have a
substantially large budget to work with, but they succeed in creating an
otherworldly look through minimalism.  Buildings are shiny and smooth;
people dress up in nice suits; and color is all but absent--everything
seems constantly bathed in some shade of grey or silver, perfectly
conveying the sense of coldness and lack of passion that dominates this
glacial society.
        Niccol's attention to detail does not extend, however, to Gattaca's basic
plot mechanics, which are rather contrived.  The murder mystery plot turns
out to be little more than a device to put Vincent in danger of being
discovered and does not reach a satisfying conclusion on its own.  A
supposed plot twist involving one of the murder's investigators (Loren
Dean) is predictable and uninspired, and a sibling rivalry subplot explored
early in the film between Vincent and his genetically engineered younger
brother is revisited later to very little effect; it just serves as an
extraneous, redundant underscoring of the point that genetics are not
everything.  The one relationship that is supposed to lend some warmth to
the proceedings, the romance between Vincent and Irene, fails to ignite;
Hawke and Thurman may have generated sparks off camera, but very little, if
any, of that rapport is displayed onscreen.
        When I first saw the trailer for Gattaca, I and a few other people
snickered at the terribly banal tagline "There is no gene for the human
spirit."  As cornball as it is, that simple statement quite effectively
sums up the true nature of the film.  For all of its big Hollywood sci-fi
trappings, Gattaca is essentially an intimate human story, and an
unexpectedly moving and inspiring one at that.  By the time it is over, one
may just find oneself with (somewhat) renewed faith in the human race.

Title
Review for Pushing Tin (1999)
_Pushing_Tin_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
_Pushing_Tin_ is not, as a friend of mine erroneously yet understandably
concluded from its title, about aluminum siding salesmen.  However, the
occupation held by its main characters, Nick Falzone (John Cusack) and
Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton), is indeed one not typically given center
stage treatment in the movies: air traffic control.  Directing planes into
a collision-free course onto the tarmac may not sound like the
action-packed stuff movies are made for, but director Mike Newell makes the
challenging yet seemingly tedious job appear incredibly exciting.  The
rivalry between cocky hotshot Nick and the serious, even more skilled
newcomer Russell threatens to turn their very real and serious job into one
big game, and their battlefield of computer blips certainly resembles a
video game.  However, they--and the filmmakers--never lose sight of the
lives that hang in the balance with every move of the cursor, lending Nick
and Russell's faceoff-at-the-console scenes a certain amount of suspense in
addition to their driving intensity.
Nick and Russell's rivalry naturally leaks out into the world beyond the
workplace, and that's where Newell and screenwriters Glen and Les Charles
run into turbulence.  In fact, _Pushing_Tin_ is less about Nick and Russell
as air traffic controllers than it is their domestic lives.  While this
inherently is not a problem, its familiarity is, and it takes about a good
hour of exposition before the film touches a crucial, and eventually
central, point--that each appears to fancy the other's wife.  Nick is drawn
to Russell's vivacious 19-year-old wife Mary (Angelina Jolie), and Russell
starts to pay some much-needed attention to Nick's largely neglected
homemaker wife Connie (Cate Blanchett, acquitting herself nicely in a
contemporary role).  This side of the story is well-played by all involved
and there are more than a few funny moments (a musical interlude in a
restaurant is a highlight), but instead of enhancing the film, it only
serves to make what was an original premise into something far too
conventional.

Review for O (2001)
        Leave it to Hollywood to make a bold, challenging film for teens (and
adults) only to let it collect dust on a shelf as proposed release dates were
set, then scratched, many times over.  Such was the sad and unfair case with Tim
Blake Nelson's _O_, which original distributor Miramax seemed ready to consign
to direct-to-video oblivion after scuttling their final planned theatrical
release date in April 2001--three years after the film's production.  Luckily
for the film and audiences everywhere, Lions Gate came to the rescue of what is
by far the most successful modern-dress adaptation of a William Shakespeare
work--and the rare teen-targeted film to have something of real substance to
say.
        The "O" of the title is Odin James (Mekhi Phifer), the only black
student in a ritzy South Carolina prep school.  The star player of the
basketball team, Odin has the respect and love of his peers, not to mention the
team coach (Martin Sheen), who favors him over his own son, Hugo (Josh
Hartnett).  Bitter and jealous, Hugo sets out to destroy the too-trusting Odin
by planting seeds of doubt about his girlfriend Desi's (Julia Stiles) fidelity.
        Placing the Bard's _Othello_ in a modern high school context was a most
inspired idea on the part of director Nelson and screenwriter Brad Kaaya, for so
many elements in the original play so seamlessly translate to the charged
atmosphere and psychology of adolescence: the destructive rumors that are too
easily taken for truth (in a way, _O_ the cautionary tale last year's horrid
_Gossip_ wanted to be); the unspoken but ever-present prejudices; the selfish
pride; and--perhaps most crucially--the melodramatic tendency to blow petty
events and any resulting emotions into an out-of-proportion life-and-death
matter.  That last point in mind, the story's inevitable leap to violence is all
the more real--and hence more disturbing and deeply tragic.
        The emotional intimacy and intensity of the piece owes a huge debt to
the performers.  The charismatic Phifer is a perfect match for the charming and
(over)confident Odin; his natural likability makes his simmering jealousy and
rage that much more upsetting.  Before that happens, though, he forges a strong
rapport with the radiant Stiles; their early scenes have a genuine tenderness
that doesn't come off as sticky.  Delivering the breakthrough turn is Hartnett,
who wisely eschews the urge to overplay; his rather quiet, understated turn adds
to the menace of the character, not to mention it makes Odin's misguided but
unwavering faith in him easy to swallow.
        Nelson, however, deserves most of the credit for making a Shakespeare
play not only work but feel relevant in a contemporary context.  A part of that
success is definitely due to his and Kaaya's decision to not retain the
Shakespearean dialogue, which had such a distancing effect in Baz Luhrmann's
_Romeo_+_Juliet_ and Michael Almereyda's _Hamlet_.  It may not retain the Bard's
words, but _O_ works better than those films due to a fidelity of a different
kind: that to the spirit of original piece.  There's no blatant pandering to
youth (as in _R+J_'s quick-cut, MTV-ready eye candy) or contemporary audiences
in general (_Hamlet_'s aggressive push of modern settings and products, as in
the infamous Blockbuster Video-set "To be or not to be" scene).  _O_ is as
unflinchingly dark as its source material, and seeing the physically and
emotionally violent story play out--with little strain in believabilty--in the
here and now just makes it more unsettling.
        Miramax failed to see the big picture with _O_, zeroing in its violent
content without paying attention to context; as such, the film's release was
tabled countless times due to real-life instances of high school bloodshed. 
It's quite a sad statement on the movie industry that between '98 and now, a
number of youth-targeted films--be them of the horror, action, or even comedy
genres--that exploited violence as a means of stimulation have easily seen
release while a film that seriously deals with the issue and its aftereffects
has had to languish in limbo.  _O_ is the type of film that one should want to
release in the aftermath of a high school shooting: a film where the acts of
violence are shocking not because of graphic gore or sensationalism, but because
one can profoundly feel the lives being destroyed.

Title
Review for Fifth Element, The (1997)
The Fifth Element (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
The cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for
quite sometime now: "IT MU5T BE FOUND."  So what, exactly, is The Fifth
Element?  After seeing Luc Besson's ambitious, much-shrouded-in-secrecy
science fiction fantasy, I could not help but be let down by the actual
answer, which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think.  But
what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole, a wildly imaginative
feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films
do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen.
The biggest irony of The Fifth Element is that the one thing that
has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most
conventional, dismayingly so, element (pun intended) of the film.  Speaking
in the vaguest possible terms, the basics of the plot are as follows: in the
year 2259, a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth, and only
the four elements--earth, wind, fire, and water--united with a fifth element
can stop it.  Figuring into all of this are New York cabbie Korben Dallas
(Bruce Willis); a shady, Southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of Zorg
(the hilariously hammy Gary Oldman, picking up where he left off in Besson's
The Professional); a priest (Ian Holm); and a mysterious creature named
Leeloo (Milla Jovovich).  All of the pieces come together in a tidy and
somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion, but there is no denying
that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest.
What remains interesting and exciting, however, after brief glimpses
is the fascinating world Besson has created with production designer Dan
Weil, director of photography Thierry Arbogast, visual effects supervisor
Mark Stetson, and the crew at Digital Domain.  The look is absolutely
mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last.  The frenzied
cityscape of New York, with its vibrant day-glo colors, tall buildings
penetrating high into the clouds, and the swarm of cars, cabs, and other
vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways, is absolutely breathtaking to
behold, especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film.  But
it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people
inhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting, and are they ever.
In addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this
world, from bulky robots to dog-like Mangalores, the humans are outfitted in
costumes by eccentric designer Jean-Paul Gaulthier, best known for creating
Madonna's pointy bustier get-up in her Blonde Ambition tour.  Gaulthier's
outlandish creations, such as a number worn by Leeloo made entirely out of
white straps, feel more at home in Besson's futuristic vision than on any
fashion runway in the world; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about
the film.
While Besson's bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film, it
also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience.  For all its
imagination, certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and
bizarre.  I really do not know what middle America will make of the most
outrageous character of the film, Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker), a flamboyant
disc jockey who makes Dennis Rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous
entrance dressed in an animal print dress, sporting a blonde hairdo in the
shape of a hair dryer, speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed.   At
first this character's hyper energy is funny, but the act wears out its
welcome very quickly.  Not irritating, but just as strange, is a musical
number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse Diva (Maiwenn LeBesco), who
sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and
techno.  The tune, as with the entirety of longtime Besson collaborator Eric
Serra's innovative score, is haunting, but it is also completely jarring.
Then there are the campy touches of humor Besson and co-scripter Robert Mark
Kamen sprinkle throughout, which too often are silly and forced; a comic
sexual encounter between Ruby Rhod and a flight attendant is highly
distracting and not very funny, to boot.
The story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of
The Fifth Element.  While still visually and aurally spectacular, the events
detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be.  The big,
serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers, and it
ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to
work toward.  As such, at the end there is a sense that there was something
bigger at work here, that there was still more left to be said about this
story and these characters.  This suspicion was confirmed by Besson himself,
who told me in the lobby following the screening (imagine that, the
filmmaker watching the film with the "enemy"--the critics) that what had
made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original
Fifth Element screenplay and that the second half--now titled Mr. Shadow--is
still waiting to be made.
Still, despite the story problems, The Fifth Element is an artistic
triumph for Luc Besson; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come to
the screen in all its audacious, undiluted glory.  It is a fascinating
example of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audience
into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams.

Review for Elizabeth (1998)
In 1558, the young, naive Princess Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is
proclaimed Queen of England after the death of her devoutly Catholic
half-sister, Queen Mary I (Kathy Burke).  Being Protestant and illegitimate
(she was borne of an extramarital affair by King Henry VIII), Elizabeth
arrives on the throne with a fair share of enemies within her country as
well as abroad.  As forces ranging from French queen Mary of Guise (Fanny
Ardant) and the Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston) plot against her,
Elizabeth takes a stand with the help and guidance of ever-loyal Master of
Spies Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).
Anyone expecting a typically stately, in manner and in pace, British
historical drama will be jolted by Shekhar Kapur's stylish and fast-paced
"historical thriller," in which Queen Elizabeth I's rise to the throne and
resulting loss of innocence plays not unlike that of--yes--Michael
Corleone's in _The_Godfather_.  Michael Hirst's screenplay does not offer
any true insight into what made Elizabeth tick, Blanchett's effortlessly
commanding Queen is no less a fascinating character.  Blanchett is just one
of a uniformly excellent cast, which also includes Joseph Fiennes as
Elizabeth's love interest, Lord Robert Dudley.   Even if I did not
particularly learn anything from it, I was completely engrossed by
_Elizabeth_, which not only makes the traditionally stuffy and aloof
British costume drama accessible, but entertaining and exciting as well.

Title
Review for Let's Talk About Sex (1998)
_Let's_Talk_About_Sex_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
Let's not.  Troy Beyer's directorial debut (she also wrote and stars)
offers plenty of the bawdy talk the title promises.  But it's wrapped
around a load of dreck.  Advice columnist Jazz (Beyer) aspires to be a talk
show hostess, and the candid woman-to-woman interviews she shoots for an
audition tape send Jazz and her two roommates, Lena (Randi Ingerman) and
Michelle (Paget Brewster), on that dreaded "journey of self-discovery"
traveled in too many independent films.  Jazz unlocks a secret trauma that
keeps her from committing to her perfect man (Joseph C. Phillips); slutty
Lena realizes she just wants to be loved; bitchy Michelle realizes that her
coldness comes from fear.
And the audience, what does it discover about these characters?  They're a
bunch of crybabies.  Make that just "babies," because the duct-challenged
Beyer, Ingerman, and Brewster cannot muster a single tear between them,
which is a glaring problem once the film settles into its almost laughably
dissonant tone: raunchy interview segments alternating with soppy,
melodramatic crying scenes that sent my eyes rolling.  The film's
hilariously overblown housework-as-grieving climax, complete with cleanser
cans being thrown in frustration, has to be a cinema landmark of some sort.
 As for the film's purported insight into female sexuality (most of the
interviews are done with real people, not actors), to me it seems that
Beyer simply chose the most outrageous segments for inclusion in the film,
rather than the most honest.  Terrible writing, terrible acting, terrible
direction--terrible film.  (opens September 11)

Title
Review for Scary Movie 2 (2001)
_Scary_Movie_2_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
        "No mercy.  No shame.  No sequel."  If only those two groups of
brothers--Wayans and Weinstein--had heeded the last part of that tagline for the
original _Scary_Movie_.  But since that tiresome wallow in bodily fluids was the
shock blockbuster of last summer, here now is, indeed, the sequel--even though
the first film more than drained the well of teen slasher movies to lampoon.
        So what's left for _Scary_Movie 2_ make fun of?  That the first film's
primary target/model was _Scream_ and that this one's is Jan DeBont's justly
maligned remake of _The_Haunting_ says everything about _Scary_Movie_2_'s
creative bankruptcy.  The story--which simply has the characters from the first
film stay in a haunted house--is supposed to get its (for lack of a better term)
"inspiration" from thrillers of a supernatural bent such as _The_Haunting_,
_What_Lies_Beneath_, _Poltergeist_, and _The_Exorcist_.  But in this film more
than the last, director Keenen Ivory Wayans and the writing crew headed by stars
Shawn and Marlon Wayans depend on tangents based on non-genre films and other
pop culture items of the moment.  That wouldn't be a problem if the bits
actually paid off, but all the gags in the film either start well then sputter
at the end (e.g. the opening _Exorcist_-inspired sequence, which for all its
eventual shortcomings is still the most effective in the film; an overlong
takeoff on a Nike commercial) or are dead on arrival (a forced _Weakest_Link_
reference).
        But _Scary_Movie_2_ fails less because of its lack of laughs than its
lack of shocks.  _Scary_Movie_ was by no means a good film nor a particularly
hilarious one (though, admittedly, it had its moments); the only reason I can
come up with for its wild popularity was the startling and unexpected extremes
of its vulgarity.  For this sequel, audiences are fully expecting the gratuitous
semen jokes and cartoonish raunch, thus whatever novelty the crassness had the
first time around is severely diminished.
        Not diminished, however, is the appeal of returning lead Anna Faris. 
Her Cindy Campbell is now a stand-in for Lili Taylor's rather dour role in
_The_Haunting_, and as such Faris has considerably fewer chances to flash her
natural comedic instincts; nonetheless, she makes the most of what little is
given her.  Someone cast her in a real movie, please--not a slapdash, rushed
hack job like _Scary_Movie_2_.

Title
Review for Mask of Zorro, The (1998)
Despite numerous vehicles designed to break him out of the fold, Antonio
Banderas still remains right on the cusp of major Hollywood stardom.  He
came out with both guns blazing in _Desperado_, yet he didn't exactly blow
away the box office; Rebecca DeMornay literally sunk her teeth into his
naked ass in _Never_Talk_to_Strangers, but he himself came away with
nothing to chew on; he rode Sylvester Stallone's fast-falling coattails in
_Assassins_; no one cared to see how he and his current wife, Melanie
Griffith, met on the job in _Two_Much_.  Now, holding some momentum after
his well-received supporting turn in _Evita_, Banderas has his best--and,
perhaps, last--shot at Tinseltown superstardom, the rousing romantic
adventure _The_Mask_of_Zorro_.
In a season and an age ruled by action films reliant on post-production
effects, the barebones approach of an old fashioned swashbuckler is rather
refreshing.  As this update of Johnston McCulley's enduring character
begins, the legendary masked, sword-wielding defender of the weak and
oppressed is really one Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins), aiding
Mexico's independence effort against Spain.  His double life is soon
discovered by the evil Spanish governor Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson),
who kills de la Vega's wife Esperanza (Julietta Rosen), throws him in
prison, and claims their infant daughter, Elena, as his own.  Twenty years
later, de la Vega escapes, at roughly the same time Montero returns from
Spain to the now-independent Mexico with the grown Elena (Catherine
Zeta-Jones) in tow.  Montero, of course, has a dirty scheme up his sleeve,
and seeing that he is a bit long in the tooth to reassume the mask of
Zorro, grooms young, scruffy, revenge-minded bandit Alejandro Murieta
(Banderas) to take his place.
Naturally, this sets the stage for extended training sequences, which are
far from anything new but made watchable by some funny repartee written by
scripters John Eskow, Ted Elliot, and Terry Rossio; and the effortless
mentor-student rapport between Hopkins and Banderas.  Unlike some films,
though, while Alejandro pretty much passes his training, he still does not
perfect certain things (namely, horseback riding) which gives this fantasy
some element of reality--and keeps the film from taking itself too
seriously.  It's this lighthearted, light-on-its-feet tone that makes
_Zorro_ such agreeable entertainment.  Director Martin Campbell delivers
the goods in the many exciting swordfights throughout the movie, but he
also displays a nice, breezy touch throughout, particularly in the scene
that received the biggest crowd response: a cute and sexy
swordplay-as-foreplay scene between Alejandro and Elena.
Although the Alejandro-Elena romance is somewhat underwritten, the pairing
comes to life, thanks to palpable chemistry between Banderas and the
breathtaking Zeta-Jones, who share a sensual dance scene midway through the
film.  Actually, Banderas heightens the energy level of every scene he's
in.  He has always been a charismatic screen presence, but he has never
been quite so charmingly roguish and playful, which is perfectly suited to
the character.  Also well-cast is Hopkins, who appears to be having a ball
taking on a more physical role for a change.  Less effective, though, is
the casting of the villains.  Wilson is only slightly more menacing than
the weak brand of villainy he leant _Lethal_Weapon_3_, and Matt Letscher,
playing the military captain who killed Alejandro's brother (hence the new
Zorro's thirst for vengeance), seems no match for the masked swordsman.
While _Armageddon_ and _Lethal_Weapon_4_ pummel moviegoers with mayhem
(and quite effectively, at that), it's almost soothing to watch an action
film as comparatively laid-back as _The_Mask_of_Zorro_.  It is a fairly
relaxed yet confident, competent entertainment, one that is not afraid to
bypass a hard sell and allow its innate charms to elegantly seduce its
audience.

Title
Review for Notting Hill (1999)
_Notting_Hill_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
While their careers are far from flagging, neither Julia Roberts nor Hugh
Grant have quite recaptured the heights of the projects that propelled them
to stardom.  This has been especially the case with Grant, whose last
project, the 1996 medical thriller _Extreme_Measures_, found the actor
acquitting himself surprisingly well in a serious role, but it offered
little reminder of self-effacing British charms that broke him through in
1994's _Four_Weddings_and_a_Funeral_.  Roberts, on the other hand, has had
(to put it lightly) her fair share of successes since 1990's
_Pretty_Woman_, but few of the hits she has had possessed the simple magic
of that modern-day romance classic that made her career--even her role in
1997's entertaining smash _My_Best_Friend's_Wedding_ had her stretch
somewhat, playing, to use the words of her character, "the bad guy" (albeit
a charming one).  Roberts has always been best at being, as in
_Pretty_Woman_, a glowing presence--something she has never been content to
do since.
_Notting_Hill_, from two of Grant's _Four_Weddings_ collaborators, writer
Richard Curtis and producer Duncan Kenworthy (director Roger Michell is new
to the mix), casts the two likable stars in their well-trodden element.  As
such, the film does not uncover any new talents that they might have buried
within, but it gives audiences exactly what they want from them--and in a
smartly written and wholly irresistible package.
Many stars have been accused of essentially playing themselves in film,
but never has that been more blatantly the case with Roberts's role in
_Notting_Hill_: that of Anna Scott, a world-famous movie star whose private
life is often fodder for the tabloids.  (Further blurring the Julia/Anna
divide is the opening montage of red carpet arrival footage, most of it
culled from actual news coverage of Roberts at gala events.)  This may reek
of shameless self-indulgence, but the movie star conceit allows Roberts to
poke fun at her image and, more effectively, enables Curtis to deftly let
off some pointed barbs at the Hollywood machine.  One hilarious sequence
perfectly captures the often ridiculous nature of a press junket
(naturally, this section received the best response from the all-media
audience); and in one single, simple line, Curtis takes a stinging jab at
the writing-by-committee tactic so often used for so-called "blockbusters."
The main intent of _Notting_Hill_, however, is not satire but romance, and
Curtis and Michell have crafted a truly enchanting one.  The premise is
pure fantasy: one day Anna walks into the travel book store of Notting Hill
(a neighborhood in London) resident William Thacker (Grant, comfortably
back in _Four_Weddings_ stammer mode), and in quick time this average joe
finds himself striking a friendship with the glam starlet that eventually
develops into something deeper--which, of course, leads to some problems
with anonymity.  As far-fetched as the story is, it is done with such style
and grace--the latter especially the case with Roberts and Grant's
effortless rapport--that there is no difficulty in suspending disbelief.
While Roberts and Grant make an immensely appealing center, the characters
at the periphery provide memorable support.  Emma Chambers, Hugh
Bonneville, Tim McInnerny, and Gina McKee are all given their individual
moments to shine as William's sister and close friends, respectively.
Likely to generate the most talk, though (aside from a funny surprise cameo
by a name star), is Rhys Ifans, a scene stealer William's disgusting slob
of a flatmate, Spike.
If there is a misstep made in _Notting_Hill_, it is the ending.
Admittedly a crowdpleaser, it's also so overdone as to be the only moment
in the movie that is far less than convincing.  But by that point, Roberts,
Grant, and everyone and everything else will have so effortlessly endeared
the audience that such a complaint is moot.  That one moment may ring
false, but what remains true throughout is the enrapturing spell this
sparkling entertainment casts upon the audience.

Title
Review for Reindeer Games (2000)
_Reindeer_Games_ (R) ** (out of ****)
Ben Affleck is such a gosh-darn likable fella.  In every film (not to
mention talk show appearance) he does, he projects an ebullient, affable
charisma that easily endears him to the audience.  However, it's that
very quality that defeats him and the entirety of _Reindeer_Games_
-- though, in all fairness, there are plenty of others to blame for how
the film goes wrong.
_Reindeer_ was written by Ehren Kruger, and after making a strong debut
with last summer's chilling _Arlington_Road_, he is beginning to look
like a one-trick pony.  He ruined the _Scream_ trilogy with his weak
script for its final installment, and now comes this film, which, I must
admit, has the seed of a good idea at its core.  Affleck plays Rudy
Duncan, a just-released convict who decides to pose as his just-murdered
cellmate Nick to get some action with Ashley (Charlize Theron), with whom
Nick shared a passionate mail correspondence.  But the roll in the hay
comes at a price--turns out that Ashley's brother Gabriel wants "Nick" to
help in the robbery of a casino where "Nick" once worked.  Of course, the
problem is, not only is "Nick" not really Nick, but he also hasn't the
slightest idea how to pull off a heist--Rudy served time for grand theft
auto.
Numerous twists ensue, and per Dimension's request (as stated in a
disclaimer at the top of the press notes), I won't reveal any more. 
While a number of the turns are genuinely surprising, they soon spring
out of control.  By the final reel, the script twists for the mere sake
of twisting, going for the cheap shock at the expense of all logic or
sense of reality.  It could be countered that Kruger never takes the
material too seriously, throwing in numerous one-liners to break the
tension.  But, as evidenced in _Scream_3_, Kruger isn't much of a comedy
writer, and the failed attempts at humor end up taking viewers out of the
increasingly complicated story rather than making it more enjoyable.
With such a script so uneven in tone, it's little wonder that the
performances are wildly varied.  One minute Sinise is a sinister villain,
the next minute he's somewhat of a buffoon.  At least he tries to ride
along with the material, unlike the other two leads, who nail one extreme
and stick with it.  Theron is a good actress and a stunning screen
presence, but she plays her character much too straight, making certain
turns of events that much more preposterous.  Affleck plays up the
jokiness of the script, and while that famously light approach has worked
elsewhere, it isn't quite what's needed in this type of action thriller. 
Certainly Bruce Willis cracks wise in all of his action vehicles, but
when it came down to business, he was a convincing tough guy; Affleck, on
the other hand, has a look of smug bemusement on his face most of the
time, as if to knowingly mock the ridiculous affair.  If our hero doesn't
appear to believe--or believe in--what's going on, how does one expect
the audience to?
The audience may not believe in _Reindeer_Games_, but director John
Frankenheimer does his best to at least keep them superficially
interested.  The film is fast-paced; the numerous suspense and action
scenes are all smoothly done, and every now and again one is able to get
a momentary adrenaline rush.  But the excitement is just that, momentary
and very fleeting--proving that without a story or characters to really
care about, an action thriller is, to borrow the term Gabriel uses in the
film, just a silly little reindeer game.

Title
Review for Road to El Dorado, The (2000)
_The_Road_to_El_Dorado_ (PG) *** (out of ****)
_The_Road_to_El_Dorado_ is a reasonably entertaining animated feature,
which is more than enough to satisfy the family audience the film
courts--and, thus, enough for me to recommend it.  But a merely adequate
effort is somewhat disappointing coming from DreamWorks, the studio that
had so spectacularly redefined the barriers of feature animation with
their 1998 epic _The_Prince_of_Egypt_.  Instead of advancing the medium
even further, _El_Dorado_ finds the studio--and feature animation in
general--simply treading water.
El Dorado is the legendary lost city of gold hidden in South America,
where Spanish con men Tulio (voiced by Kevin Kline) and Miguel (Kenneth
Branagh) find themselves after escaping a ship piloted by the evil Cortes
(Jim Cummings).  The natives believe these strangers to be gods, and the
two play along in order to get their share of the riches.  Aiding in
their scheme is the saucy, sassy local  Chel (Rosie Perez), who keeps
their secret in exchange for a cut of all that's given them.
The premise is thin, and the set pieces that are hung upon it are
accordingly light.  Tulio and Miguel exchange good-natured barbs at each
other's expense; Chel incites some chaste looks of lust from the pair;
the duo get caught in slapsticky chases and sporting events.  These
elements are not without their simple charm, due in large part to some
sturdy art and animation and game vocal performances.  Perez's famously
squeaky voice, which often grates in her flesh-and-blood roles, is right
at home in a cartoon context.
But sometimes the light nature becomes "lite"--as in inconsequential and
forgettable.  The villainy--Cortes, a deceitful high priest named
Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante)--never seems particularly threatening; the
big problem in the case of Cortes is that he doesn't have enough screen
time to establish himself as a major threat.  The songs by the
_Lion_King_ team of composer Elton John and Tim Rice, which are mostly
sung by John himself, are better suited to lite FM radio stations than an
animated feature.  The song score also suffers from the miscalculation I
call "_Tarzan_ Syndrome": if a film is going to use the tunes as an
underscore, it should not insert a big production number where the
characters sing.  Trying to have the best of both worlds--as Disney did
with _Tarzan_, shoehorning in a completely gratuitous Rosie O'Donnell
musical showcase--ends up shortchanging the film as a whole, especially
when the tunes are as unmemorable as they are here.
But those two complaints aren't so much annoyances as they are
distractions in a work that, while being completely pleasant to watch,
never really captivates.  As mentioned before, the animation and art are
fine, but there is nothing particularly distinctive about it.  After a
promising avant garde prologue that recounts El Dorado's legendary
origins, there is nothing in the way of fresh sights.  Tulio and Miguel's
number "It's Tough to Be a God" is meant to be the big animation
highlight, but anyone who's seen a Disney animated feature in the last
ten years won't find anything that one hasn't seen or done better before.
But maybe that was what directors Eric "Bibo" Bergeron and Don Paul were
hired to do: keep things familiar and, hence, comfortable for the
audience.  _The_Road_to_El_Dorado_ indeed fits that bill, a film as easy
to enjoy as it is to watch.  And while that's enough for me to give
_El_Dorado_ the seal of approval without hesitation, I cannot help but
feel that I would be more excited about the film had it been a bit more
of a challenge to like it.

Title
Review for Double Jeopardy (1999)
_Double_Jeopardy_ (R) ** (out of ****)
_Double_Jeopardy_ boasts a hook that is killer--literally.  A woman is
framed her husband's murder and is accordingly sentenced to prison. 
While in the pen, she discovers that her husband is, in fact, alive and
kicking.  Informed of the "double jeopardy" law--that is, that no person
can be tried for the exact same crime twice--she decides to serve her
time and, once she's released,  _really_ off her not-so-dear hubby. 
After all, no officer of the law can touch her for committing a crime she
has already "committed," no?
The few times I saw the trailer for _Double_Jeopardy_, the clip where
the woman in question, Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd), is told about double
jeopardy by a fellow inmate (Roma Maffia), was greeted with hearty
applause.  And during my screening of the film, that same scene, in its
complete form, was met with the same approval.  But that's just five
minutes in a film that lasts at least 100, and in time it becomes clear
that the hook is all there is to _Double_Jeopardy_, with nothing equally
as interesting or surprising left to fill in the blanks.
The presence of Judd in the lead does go a long way in keeping the film
watchable.  Libby breaks her parole in Washington state and tracks down
her deceitful husband Nick (Bruce Greenwood) all the way down to New
Orleans, Judd is never less than believable, and as such there is little
difficulty buying into the often-preposterous proceedings.  Also
contributing to the urgency is Tommy Lee Jones, whose strongly
_Fugitive_-esque role as parole officer Travis Lehman is indeed one he
can play in his sleep, but that doesn't mean that he's any less
entertaining.
With the actors doing the best they can, the blame for this
less-than-thrilling thriller falls on director Bruce Beresford and
writers David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook.  From the premise, it's quite
obvious how the film's going to end.  After all, can you imagine just how
let down the audience would feel if she _doesn't_ commit the dirty deed? 
(And if the film didn't end that way, a test screening would have surely
changed that.)  So it's up to the filmmakers to flesh out the whole, and
all they come up with is the idea of lost children.  In an obvious effort
to keep Libby from being too coldblooded, her main motive to find her
husband is not to even the score, but to see her son again; to add some
sort of bonding point between her and Lehman, he's saddled with an
arbitrary back story where his own daughter was taken away from him after
a DUI infraction.  The more action-oriented "suspense" points that come
along the way aren't much more effective.  One too many scenes has Libby
smash up a car, and one critical scene down the stretch has the villain
committing the mistake made by _Austin_Powers_' Dr. Evil--that is,
assuming the heroine is left for dead when it would be much easier to
make quick work of her.
But most people won't think of these things while watching
_Double_Jeopardy_, and the film may end up sufficiently entertaining
audiences.  However, it must be said that while there was some clapping
at the end of the film, the applause was nothing compared to that which
greeted the "double jeopardy" scene.  It just goes to show that while a
great hook does count for something, it takes a lot more to reel an
audience in.

Title
Review for Battlefield Earth (2000)
_Battlefield_Earth:_A_Saga_of_the_Year_3000_ (PG-13) no stars (out of
****)
Although trailers for _Battlefield_Earth_ have been playing in
moviehouses since December, the reaction has remained constant over the
last few months.  With each new audience for each different film at each
different time of day, no less than thunderous peals of derisive laughter
greet the sight of John Travolta done up like a ten-foot-tall alien beast
bearing talons and a moptop of dreadlocks.  The television ad campaign,
bearing the ludicrous catch phrase "Get Psychlo!" (Psychlo being the name
of the monstrous alien race), has done little to change the negative
public perception.
That said, I must give credit to the Warner Bros. marketing people.  As
poor as all the ads look, they don't even begin to touch upon the
unfathomable awfulness of _Battlefield_Earth:_A_Saga_of_the_Year_3000_
(the film's full, onscreen title).  Not only is it hardly presumptuous to
declare it the worst film of the year 2000, it is no exaggeration to call
this wretched piece of incompetence one of the worst films ever made.
As stated by the complete title, the film takes place in the year 3000
A.D., where the planet is in post-apocalyptic ruins after being taken
over by the evil alien race from the planet Psychlo a thousand years
prior.  "Man is an endangered species," as an insanely large text card
states, with most of the remaining humans being held prisoner and/or
enslaved by giant, grotesque Psychlo.  A certain few, however, live
freely as primitives in secluded mountain villages.  One such person is a
bright, resourceful young hunter (Barry Pepper) who may very well be the
one to lead the human race to winning back its freedom from the alien
invaders.
That summary could've been written by anyone who had just seen
_Battlefield_'s trailer, which makes clear what is completely incoherent
in the complete film.  _Battlefield_ tells a simple, simplistic story,
but somehow director Roger Christian and screenwriters Corey Mandell and
JD Shapiro have made it virtually incomprehensible.  After twenty or so
dead-end minutes of people wandering through an obviously
matte-composited wasteland comes the first of the showcase action
scenes--which are all haphazardly cut and slow-mo'ed to oblivion. 
Pepper's doozy of a character name--Jonnie Goodboy Tyler--is not made
evident until about halfway through the film.  But at least his name has
a consistent pronunciation, unlike that of Terl (Travolta, who also
produced), the "head of security" for the aliens' Earth operation;
sometimes it rhymes with "girl" and other times it rhymes with "Carol." 
However you say his name, Terl devises some sort of evil scheme against
his superiors after being passed up for a cushier job (yes, even aliens
get frustrated by career stagnation), but it beats me just how exactly
it's supposed to work.  Even so, his plan is not nearly as nonsensical as
the humans' plan for revolt.
Travolta has called Terl "the definitive evil character."  With creature
designer Patrick Tatopoulos failing to come up with a menacing look for
the Psychlo--their appearance looks ridiculously slapped together from
bits of cheap leftover Klingon and rastafarian costumes, with a touch of
bondage gear thrown in--it's up to Travolta to turn Terl into a
convincingly vicious, truly hateful villain.  But his smug, jokey take on
the character is a complete miscalculation.  A similar approach worked
for him as the bad guy in John Woo's _Broken_Arrow_, but there that flip
cockiness fit the quirky character.  Terl is supposed to be pure,
unironic evil--not so much a character to hate as one to feel genuinely
threatened by.  With Travolta punctuating nearly every passage of
dialogue with a ridiculously overdone "evil" cackle, it's little wonder
that Terl--and, consequently, the film--can never be taken seriously.
However, the filmmakers take _Battlefield_Earth_ extremely seriously,
and their reverence of the source novel--and its writer, Church of
Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard--blinds them to the fact that the
story they're trying to adapt is nothing more than a pulpy genre piece,
not an "important" work of literature.  Hence, the film is riddled with
laughable and utterly baffling moments of self-importance: a crowd is
inspired to give exuberantly savage grunts and barks--by flowery
statements about the value of freedom; pseudo-profound ruminations about
destiny incongruously pop up during a big prison break sequence.  People
who treat lines like "We're gonna blow up their planet.  Needless to say,
we're gonna need more supplies before we do that" with grave seriousness
are in no position to condescend to their audience, but that's exactly
what Christian does.  At one point, Jonnie is shown reading a
reproduction of the Declaration of Independence, but so ignorant are we
movie audiences that he has to then flip to a page that says "Declaration
of Independence" in huge type.
Usually a subpar sci-fi film can at least fall back on its visuals, but
_Battlefield_Earth_ can't even count that as a saving grace.  Forget the
not-so-special effects--Christian and his crew can't even get the basics
right; the rubbery Psychlo creature design is just the tip of the
iceberg.  Matte paintings are not only obvious, the image compositing is
shockingly inept; the three-dimensional actors are clearly standing in
front of flat backdrops.  The would-be futuristic weaponry and gadgets
don't look quite as state-of-the-art as stuff you'd find on a toy store
shelf.
Catch Travolta on any talk or magazine show, and you'll see him all
smiles over  _Battlefield_Earth_.  Exactly why is up for question.  Given
the fact that he's tried to bring to the project to the big screen for
nearly twenty years, the obvious read is that he's beaming with pride
that it finally came to fruition.  But after seeing the  final product, I
cannot help but think that maybe, just maybe, he's laughing that he was
able to sucker otherwise sensible people into pouring tens of millions of
dollars toward making such an unspeakable, inexcusable waste.

Title
Review for Requiem for a Dream (2000)
_Requiem_for_a_Dream_ **** (out of ****)
Darren Aronofsky's _Requiem_for_a_Dream_ is less a film than a journey,
a torturously exhausting one at that--and in this case, that's the
highest compliment that can be paid.  In his visionary adaptation of
Hubert Selby, Jr.'s novel, Aronofsky doesn't merely make one bear witness
to four characters' harrowing descents into drug addiction; he forces one
to experience their euphoric highs and, above else, their shattering
lows.  This is, as Aronofsky himself calls it, a horror film--one that
not only shocks, but scars.
Set in New York, _Requiem_ follows two parallel storylines whose
foundations are different but ultimately become more or less the same. 
One follows a trio of young people: Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his
girlfriend Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), and his best friend Tyrone
(Marlon Wayans).  Marion's goal in life is to become a fashion designer,
and in order to finance the opening of a boutique, Harry and Tyrone
become drug dealers--which intensifies their already strong habit. 
Meanwhile, Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn), after receiving a notice
that she could appear on a TV game show, goes to dangerous lengths to
lose weight, namely a steadily increasing intake of diet pills.
The narrative line is obvious as the film passes through the seasons: a
sunny summer, an aptly named fall, and an even bleaker winter.  But this
isn't a film about the story so much it is about feeling.  Aronofsky
proved he can effectively unsettle viewers with his award-winning debut
_pi_, and he takes his ability to the next level in _Requiem_.  Much has
been made about the vast number of cuts in the film, but these are no
superficial exercises in style; they immerse the viewer in the
perspective and mindset of the characters.  The hyperactive early stages
of their addictions are especially captured well, and a split screen
device that could've come off as overkill reinforces the subjective point
of the view of the film.  The sensory barrage also slyly sidesteps the
explicit while ironically intensifying the feeling.  For all the shooting
up, snorting, and pill popping that occurs in the film, rarely are the
acts ever graphically shown; Aronofsky instead employs the same quick-cut
montages of heroin being cooked, straws taking in lines of coke, pill
bottles being opened, and pupils dilating.  Jarring and visually exciting
at first, these images become rather boring through their incessant
repetition--much like how the initial euphoria of drug use evolves into
mundane routine.
When I say _Requiem_ is about feeling, it should be noted that I mean
that in terms of sensation and not emotion.  The only character with much
depth is that of the lonely Sara (superbly played by Burstyn), and even
so she's still kept at the same arm's length emotionally as are the other
three.  This initially struck me as a flaw (especially in terms of the
Harry/Marion romance), but it reflects the greater ideas that Aronofsky
is trying to evoke.  The film being told from the point of view of the
addicts, the detachment is all but appropriate since they're not really
concerned about others or even themselves, just the fix.  Additionally,
the distance also reflects the way outsiders generally look at drug
addicts--as in, they don't, choosing to safely turn a blind eye. 
_Requiem_ doesn't give the audience the option of complacency; as its
last 30 minutes brutally detail everyone's raw ruin, the film seems to
dare the viewers to look away.  And it's a testament to Aronofsky that as
difficult as it is, it is impossible not to watch.
There may not be a profound emotional connection to any of these
characters, but the actors make them into convincing human beings, the
destruction of whose lives we witness before our eyes.  The resulting
feeling with which one walks away from _Requiem_for_a_Dream_ is not
sadness, but a heavier, emptier sense of loss--one that's even harder to
shake.

Title
Review for You've Got Mail (1998)
_You've_Got_Mail_ (PG) **** (out of ****)
Of all the delights to be had while watching the enchanting romantic
comedy _You've_Got_Mail_, none gave me more joy than the performance of
co-lead Meg Ryan.  The reigning queen of romantic comedy, Ryan, not so
surprisingly, delivers another turn of irresistible charm as bookstore
owner Kathleen Kelly.  But what I paid conscious attention to this time
around was the ease with which she tackles the deceptively simple-looking
job of romantic comedienne.  It's no easy task to project a natural blend
of sweetness, strength, wit, and genuine, hard-earned heart, yet Ryan has
effortlessly pulled it off year after year, in movie after movie--without
ever receiving her rightful recognition from the critics.
Sadly, _You've_Got_Mail_ will likely not change that, but that's mostly
because so much of the film is so good.  The film reunites Ryan with her
_Sleepless_in_Seattle_ partners Tom Hanks and director/co-writer (with
sister Delia) Nora Ephron in a plot that, not so coincidentally, appears to
be a variation of that 1993 blockbuster.  Ryan's Kathleen owns the small
children's bookstore The Shop Around the Corner, whose long life as a
Manhattan neighborhood staple is threatened by the nearby opening of a
Barnes and Noble-like superstore called Fox Books, owned by wealthy Joe Fox
(Hanks).  Naturally, it's hate at first sight for Joe and Kathleen, but
little do they know that appears to be their first meeting really
isn't--they have anonymously been conducting a romance over the Internet as
"NY152" (Joe) and "Shopgirl" (Kathleen).
Now, it would have been easy--and completely understandable--for the
Ephrons to completely mirror _Sleepless_'s proven formula to the letter,
but they manage to come up with some wrinkles that are often as
unpredictable as they are funny.  The biggest deviation from _Sleepless_ is
the increased interaction of Hanks and Ryan, who spent most of their last
collaboration apart--which called into question if the two truly had any
chemistry.  _Mail_ proves once and for all that Hanks and Ryan are a screen
duo for the ages, equally convincing trading comic barbs or longing
glances.  Their sparring sessions have real bite, and their more mellow
moments are so warmly tender that only the coldest hearts won't be at least
slightly moved.
This isn't to say that the film doesn't make a concession to what has
become the Ryan romantic comedy formula--namely, a man she is already
attached to, here in the form of Greg Kinnear's politically-minded reporter
Frank Navasky.  The new rub here is that Frank, while a bit stuck on
himself, is a nice guy and a much more appealing romantic choice than
ruthless businessman Joe, who, in turn, already has a partner of his own:
Patricia Eden (Parker Posey), who works at a publishing house.  While the
nice and perky Kathleen is clearly better than the ever-frantic Patricia,
it is easy to see why Joe would be with her; her high social station makes
for a "comfortable" choice, and it is in line with his hard-as-nails
attitude--which, of course, hides the truly gentle soul that he bears only
to "Shopgirl."
Similarly, Hanks does a bang-up job playing (to use Joe's term) a "pill,"
but he has a natural gentleness that he buries just deep enough and
gradually brings to surface as the film progresses.  Ephron has said that
_Mail_'s central question is "Can Mr. Wrong turn out to be Mr. Right?" and
that evolution is made involving and convincing by Hanks, who instead of
making Joe's progression from black to white, makes it a more realistic
shift between opposite shades of grey.
Again, though, _Mail_ is ultimately the glowing Ryan's show.  Her Kathleen
is fun and more than a little (hilariously) pathetic at times, but her
flightiness is grounded in real, complex emotion.   This is especially the
case in one late shot of her face, which displays surprise, disgust, anger,
and ecstatic, teary delight--all in a matter of seconds.  If that's not a
difficult acting task, I don't know what is--and it comes to Ryan as second
nature.
Cynics will probably dismiss _You've_Got_Mail_ as disposable fluff for
suckers for shamelessly romantic hokum.  If that truly is the case--and,
admittedly, there's no evidence to suggest otherwise--then I wear the title
of "sucker" with pride.

Title
Review for Girlfight (2000)
        Karyn Kusama's _Girlfight_ quite literally hits theatres with the
formidable force of enthusiastic reviews and strong Sundance audience
buzz behind it.  But as is the case with a number of film festival
favorites, the film's impact in a traditional cineplex setting, while
potent, doesn't quite bowl one over.   However, one thing about the film
plays explosively in any viewing context--the blazing performance by
newcomer Michelle Rodriguez.
        _Girlfight_ would be unthinkable without Rodriguez as Diana Guzman, a
Brooklyn teen whose hot temper often gets her in trouble at school. 
Diana inadvertently finds an outlet for her aggression when running a
simple errand for her father (Paul Calderon) at the gym where her younger
brother (Ray Santiago) takes boxing lessons.  Seeing this as a way to
gain respect from others--but, most importantly, herself--Diana starts
taking lessons from her brother's coach Hector (Jaime Tirelli) without
her always-disapproving father's awareness.
        Kusama's story of empowerment and self-actualization follows a familiar
narrative trajectory.  Diana's new confidence gives her the courage to
confront long-simmering issues with her father.  Diana meets and falls
for talented fellow boxer Adrian (Santiago Douglas), which plants the
seeds for an easily foreseeable climax.
        The audience may know exactly where _Girlfight_ is going, yet the film
is still compelling, due in no small part to the grit Kusama brings to
the picture.  The  locations and the largely unfamiliar (only Calderon, a
bit player in _Pulp_Fiction_, is recognizable) faces add immeasurably to
the authenticity of the piece.  It also helps that the actors have the
chops to make the contrived convincing.
        Kusama's most impressive accomplishment is the character of Diana and
her believable transition from uncontrollable, disrespectful kid to
disciplined young woman.  Especially realistic is how fairly
unspectacular of a boxer she becomes, underscoring that it's not so much
the physical ability Diana gains but the mental adjustment.  A standard
Hollywood production would lose sight of that in favor of flash and
completely change her into an invincible superwoman; Kusama remembers
this is amateur boxing after all, and Diana becomes a capable, competent
fighter whose full potential has yet to be realized.
        The same can't exactly be said about the Rodriguez, who is simply
astounding in this, her professional acting debut.  Rodriguez doesn't
ever downplay Diana's harsher side, but her natural magnetism instantly
hooks the viewer, and as Diana subtly oftens and grows to care more about
herself, so does the audience about her.  It's an amazingly fluid,
complex performance, and if _Girlfight_ is just the beginning for
Rodriguez, there will be no stopping this luminous talent.

Title
Review for Cop Land (1997)

Cop Land (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        James Mangold's Cop Land is one of those films that looks better on
paper than on screen, a picture that is more fun to anticipate than actually
watch.  Despite the presence of a vast array of impressive acting talent, a
provocative premise, and a great deal of pre-release hype, this star-studded
morality tale is a letdown, overblown and undercooked.
        Sylvester Stallone makes his much-ballyhooed return to "serious"
acting as Freddy Heflin, sheriff of Garrison, New Jersey, whose population
mainly consists of New York police officers.  Serving as law enforcement for
a town inhabited by law enforcement does not come with much true authority,
but it gives Freddy some satisfaction--deaf in one ear and a little slow in
the head, he can never serve as an officer of his much-revered NYPD, but at
the very least he is the closest thing to being a real cop.
        Freddy's admiration for the big-city cops is put to the test with
the arrival of Internal Affairs officer Moe Tilden (Robert DeNiro), who
comes to Garrison investigating the secret affairs of the town's
badge-wielding residents after a hotshot young cop (Michael Rapaport) takes
a mysterious dive off of the Brooklyn Bridge.  Figuring prominently in his
investigation is Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel), a well-connected cop who
spearheaded the police migration into Garrison through some suspect deals.
But there's only so much Moe can do on his own, so it's mainly up to Freddy
to restore some order to the town and the NYPD.
        That right there is enough fodder for an interesting film, but
Mangold does not seem to know where to stop, including a number of
additional characters and plotlines.  Freddy impaired his hearing years ago
rescuing Liz (Annabella Sciorra), whom he still pines for although she's
married and has a child with blowhard cop Joey Randone (Peter Berg), who, in
turn, is warming the bed of Ray's wife 
Rose (Cathy Moriarty).  Also on the canvas is Gary Figgis (Ray Liotta), an
undercover officer with a weakness for coke, whose partner's mysterious
death could have something to do with a grander scheme.  Then there's
Janeane Garofalo as Cindy Bretts, one of Freddy's two deputies, an
idealistic newcomer to Garrison who doesn't like what she sees.  And so on.
        The glut of characters and stories would be richness if everything
were explored in some semblance of depth.   However, in their existing,
crudely developed form, they just serve as distractions from the main
plot--which in itself, as written, does not equal the sum of its promising
parts.  With so many characters and plot threads dangling, let alone its
main story not jelling in the most satisfying of manners, Cop Land would
appear to be better served with a longer running time.  Yet I don't think
even that would have helped too much, especially without anyone for the
audience to latch onto emotionally.  Freddy is too low-key and distant to
sympathize with or root for.  When Freddy gets his day, it's supposed to be
exhilarating, but it's hard to get excited when one does not really care for
him.
        Stallone fares well enough in this dramatic role, his star presence
disappearing into the character behind 40 extra pounds of fat, but perhaps
he disappears a bit too much.   He does not embarrass himself alongside the
likes of DeNiro and Keitel, but I can't exactly say he holds his own,
either.   While it's a relief to see the typically overwrought Sly trade in
histrionics for subtlety, he's so subdued that he cannot help but appear
bland when sharing the screen with the more accomplished actors, who add
color to their roles without overdoing it.  Keitel and DeNiro shine in what
are fairly limited roles (Ray is shady; Moe is determined), and Liotta gives
his best performance in a long time as the most interesting character,
straddling the line between right and wrong.
        With Cop Land, Stallone proves the point he set out to make--that he
can play a serious role, and fairly well at that.  However, I don't know
exactly what writer-director Mangold's point was.  Is it that cops can be as
bad as the crooks?  If so, I got that message within the first fifteen
minutes, and even then, it's a rather obvious premise (I do, after all, live
in L.A.).  Or is it just to turn out an entertaining yarn?  If that was the
case, he could have fooled me--with its  Oscar-ready cast and pretentions
toward a novel-deep tapestry of rich characters and intricate, interlocking
plotlines, I could have sworn he was striving for something more profound.
Yet even if the latter were so, this overstuffed and shallow film does not
come close to meeting any epic aspirations.

Title
Review for Cruel Intentions (1999)
_Cruel_Intentions_ (R) *** (out of ****)
Before she found widespread recognition as TV's vampire-slaying heroine
Buffy Summers, Sarah Michelle Gellar first made quite a different name for
herself on the ABC's _All_My_Children_.  In her two-and-a-half year,
1993-1995 stint on the daytime drama, the then-teenage Gellar made a
striking impression as Kendall Hart Lang, a conniving hellraiser in her
mid-20s.  Kendall did everything she could to make her mother's (Susan
Lucci's Erica Kane)--and just about everyone else's--life miserable: she
made numerous attempts to seduce her stepfather; bedded his son, then cried
rape at his father's hands; perjured herself on the witness stand and
served a jail sentence--and this was all in her _first_ year.  In the
process, Gellar earned two Emmy nominations, one Emmy win, and a legion of
loyal fans--including myself (though not Lucci, whose working relationship
with Gellar reportedly mirrored their characters').
_Cruel_Intentions_ marks Gellar's big return to the type of role us
original fans know and love the best--the no-holds-barred bitch--and the
act has only gotten better with age.  Now in her 20s herself (though now,
ironically, playing a teen), Gellar exudes a captivatingly carniverous
carnality as Kathryn Merteuil, a bored, insanely wealthy NY prep school
student for whom selfish psychosexual mindgames provide the ultimate
thrill.  The film is at its tawdry best during her erotically-charged
scenes with Ryan Phillippe, who stars as Sebastian Valmont, Kathryn's
stepbrother and comrade in sin.
If the characters' surnames sound familiar, they should--writer-director
Roger Kumble's film is a high-gloss, ultracontemporary, youth-infused
revamp of Choderlo de Laclos's 1782 novel _Les_Liasons_Dangereuses_, whose
most notable film adaptation was Stephen Frears's powerful 1988
_Dangerous_Liaisons_.  Despite the '90s setting and adolescent characters,
Kumble hews fairly close to his source material in telling the story of how
Merteuil and Valmont wager on whether or not he can bed a virtuous girl
(here, Reese Witherspoon's Annette Hargrove).  Of course, with the change
in time and age demographic come new wrinkles: while Sebastian's prize is
indeed an encounter with Kathryn, hers is his vintage Jaguar car; and
Annette initially catches the attention of Sebastian by writing a virginity
manifesto in an issue of none other than _Seventeen_ magazine.
The latter touch is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as is a lot of
_Cruel_Intentions_.  The film's first hour fits Sony's description of the
film as a "wicked comedy," offering some gleefully mean-spirited laughs as
Kathryn and Sebastian not only plot Annette's ruin, but that of the
innocent and naive (to put it mildly) Cecile (an effectively over-the-top
Selma Blair, Zoe of the sitcom _Zoe,_Duncan,_Jack_&_Jane_), whose boyfriend
rejected Kathryn.  Kumble gives Gellar some choice catty lines, and one
bold scene between her and Blair is bound to make viewers see the two WB
stars in a whole new light.
But Kumble ultimately remains faithful to his tragic source material, and
as the tale becomes more and more serious, the casting of the dramatically
limited Phillippe becomes increasingly problematic.  His natural woodenness
is an adequate fit for Sebastian's cold detachment, but when the script
inevitably has Sebastian fall for Annette, the pathetic Phillippe can't
follow.  No convincing expression, let alone emotion, registers on his
blank face, making Sebastian's purported change wholly unbelievable.  With
this latest colorless performance (following _Playing_by_Heart_ and the
disastrous _54_), former _One_Life_to_Live_ star Phillippe--unlike the
ever-impressive Gellar--reinforces the stereotype that actors with a soap
pedigree have no discernible acting talent.  On the other hand, Witherspoon
(Phillippe's real-life fiancee, as it is) holds up her end of the romance,
radiating purity, vulnerability, and a crucial underlying strength.  But
without an at least equally involving match, her efforts are for naught,
and the outcome of the story fails to make any profound impression.
Even if the dramatic pretensions of literary fidelity get the better of
him in the end, it is Kumble's sense of humor that makes _Cruel_Intentions_
a step above recent then-to-now translations such as
_William_Shakespeare's_Romeo_+_Juliet_ and _Great_Expectations_.  While
those two films got bogged down with the self-importance of their "radical"
artistic ambitions, Kumble has the keen sense to not take himself too
seriously, making _Cruel_Intentions_ something that those films never
were--entertaining.

Title
Review for Practical Magic (1998)
_Practical_Magic_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Akiva Goldsman.  If those two words don't strike fear in the hearts of
moviegoers everywhere, I don't know what will.  The _Lost_in_Space_ and
_Batman_&_Robin_ scribe is true to sloppy form with _Practical_Magic_, a
muddled melange of genres that fails to come up with a distinct identity.
Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman play Sally and Gillian Owens,
respectively, sisters who carry on the family tradition of witchcraft.
Slutty Gillian loves to use her powers, especially to lure men, while the
reluctant but more powerful witch Sally yearns for a normal life--and a
true love that, according to an apparent curse on all Owens women, can
never come.
After the basic setup, _Practical_Magic_ heads in a number of divergent
directions.  The film is being sold as a whimsical lark, and at times the
film is light and agreeable fluff, especially when Sally and Gillian's
proud witch aunts Jet (Dianne Wiest) and Frances (Stockard Channing) are
onscreen.  But then there are the sober sister bonding scenes, where Sally
and Gillian, generally teary-eyed, profess their love for and devotion to
each other.  Then there's a taste of macabre comedy, where the sisters find
themselves disposing of the body of a man whose death they accidentally
caused.  This sets the stage for a romantic subplot between Sally and the
police officer (Aidan Quinn) investigating the man's death.  Lest we forget
this is a movie about witches, events take a turn toward straight horror,
with an evil spirit threatening the life of Gillian and everyone and
everything around her.
The all-encompassing scope of _Practical_Magic_ would not be a problem if
these elements blended into a convincing whole; _Ghost_ proved that it is
not an impossible task.  But the reason why that film was able to
successfully cover a number of bases was that, for all its genre-hopping,
it had a clearly defined central concern: the undying love between the two
main characters.  Goldsman, co-scripters Robin Swicord and Adam Brooks
(adapting Alice Hoffman's novel), and director Griffin Dunne don't appear
to have a central concern other than to try to make the film as many things
as possible to all people.  As the film jumps from place to place, so does
one's idea of what the film is exactly about.  Witchcraft?  Sally's search
for love?  Sally and Gillian's relationship?  The evil spirit?  The Owens
women's "curse"?  Anyone's guess is as good as mine. 
If the makers of _Practical_Magic_ had kept things simple, it could have
been an amusing little popcorn flick.  As in all her films, Bullock is
instantly likable, and Kidman is fun as the wild witch.  That said, the two
have little sisterly chemistry, which brings to mind a direction the film
could have taken: the comical feud between two rival sister witches, one
reckless, the other reluctant but more powerful.  OK, maybe that's not such
a great idea.  But at least it's a clear direction, something the unfocused
_Practical_Magic_ is in constant search of.

Title
Review for Superstar (1999)
Lorne Michaels and his SNL Studios have better luck with this big-screen
outing of meek Catholic school girl Mary Katherine Gallagher (Molly
Shannon) than they did with their previous _Saturday_Night_Live_
adaptation, last fall's horrendous _A_Night_at_the_Roxbury_.  That's
because, unlike _Roxbury_'s head-bobbing Butabi brothers, there's more to
the character of Mary than a single characteristic--there's also a lot of
heart.  Although director Bruce McCulloch and writer Steven Wayne Koren
do offer a taste of what Mary is known for--that is, reciting movie
monologues and knocking over and/or breaking stuff--what keeps the film
engaging, albeit superficially, is the gentle sweetness that Shannon
gives her.
But, much like an _SNL_ skit, _Superstar_ ultimately misses more than it
hits.  The story has Mary trying to impress her dream guy (Will
Ferrell)--and earn her first kiss--by entering a school talent
competition, and from this thin wisp of a story emerges a few funny and
amusingly bizarre set pieces, notably a memorable scene with a tree and a
couple of musical production numbers.  Between those moments, however,
are too many gags that don't work, namely a bunch of unfunny fantasy
sequences: recurring appearances by a groovy Jesus Christ (also played by
Ferrell), a strained send-up of _Armageddon_, and, most painfully, a
supermodel photo shoot.  Forced bits of padding such as those just show
that the concept really doesn't merit more than the five minutes its
allotted on Saturday nights.

Title
Review for Dogme 1 - Festen (1998)
_The_Celebration_(Festen)_ (R) **** (out of ****)
The title of this Danish import couldn't be more ironic.  First, there's
the literal level, in the plot: the sixtieth birthday bash of a wealthy
patriarch Helge (Hennig Moritzen) becomes something decidedly less festive
when his successful eldest son Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) disrupts the
event with some shocking allegations about him and Christian's dead twin
sister.  On a deeper level, there's the irony of tone: while the charges
being made by Christian are as serious as they can get, the situation is
played for some gleefully venomous laughs--making the overall mood sort of
a "celebration" of everyone's misery.
It's a fine line to walk, that between comedy and misery, but
director/co-writer (with Mogens Rukov) Thomas Vinterberg handle the
balancing act magnificently.   While one is often laughing at and with
Christian's shamelessly disruptive antics, one can feel the pain that
compels him to do so.  The real balancing act, though, is how Vinterberg
keeps the truth largely ambiguous through his characters; they are
portrayed equal parts bad and good, so it's often up to question whether or
not Christian is telling the truth or merely spiting his father.  It's that
heightened sense of reality--in accordance with the Danish film movement
called "Dogme 95," which sets standards for realism and "purity"--that
lends _Festen_ an uncommon power, even if some "realist" techniques become
somewhat irksome (i.e. shaky, cinema-verite hand-held camera work).

Title
Review for Enemy of the State (1998)
Anyone who thinks that the key to Will Smith's big-screen success lies
solely on his attitude and charisma will be proven wrong once and for all
by his work in Tony Scott's smart, stylish thriller.  Aside from a handful
of wry wisecracks delivered in the early going, Smith's Robert Clayton Dean
is a straight arrow, a labor attorney who is hunted down by some shady
government types after coming into possession of a videotape of a
congressman's (Jason Robards) murder.  Dean has trouble evading his
pursuers--and their high-tech surveillance equipment--until an equally
shady former NSA agent (Gene Hackman) arrives on the scene to offer some
reluctant help.
As amusing as Hackman and his riff on his character in _The_Conversation_
is, it is with his first appearance (which doesn't come until about an hour
in, if not more) that _Enemy_of_the_State_'s tightly coiled tension begins
to unravel somewhat; there is much more suspense when Dean, a common man
with no combat skills or the like, is called on to evade government
professionals solely on his wits.  But on the whole, David Marconi's script
is solid, intelligently bringing up realistic issues regarding privacy
while serving the slam-bang thrills required of any Jerry Bruckheimer
production.  Pulling the entire enterprise together is Scott, who uses his
large bag of dazzling visual tricks in good service to the plot; and Smith.
 He paints a vivid portrait of paranoia and fear, and his natural presence
and rapport with the audience is invaluable in creating a likable character.

Title
Review for Fight Club (1999)
Hear or read a story about _Fight_Club_, and chances are it's about
violence--that is, the film's amount and glorification of it.  Indeed,
there is a fair amount of brutality on display in David Fincher's
adaptation of the Chuck Palahniuk novel (after all, the film is called
_Fight_Club_), but that's just a mean to an end.  And the end--in every
sense of the word--is but one of the many striking blows this
electrifying, electrified film deals its unsuspecting audience.  Physical
violence may give the initial sting, but it's the film's psychological
violence that leaves the lasting impression.
For all the carnage on display, what comes as the greatest shock while
watching _Fight_Club_ is realizing that the film is a _comedy_--albeit a
dark and very cynical one at that (and what else could it be, coming from
_Se7en_ and _The_Game_ maestro Fincher?).  The tone is set by our
nameless, Everyman narrator (Edward Norton, award-worthy as usual) whose
boredom with his mind-numbing job and life leads to a perpetual case of
insomnia.  To fill his sleepless nights, he indulges in some strange
addictions: first, shopping from catalogs, in particular those of IKEA;
then attending support groups for people with ailments he never has and
likely never will suffer himself.  But when he discovers another
unafflicted person, one Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter, cast way
against type and delivering), making the rounds at his meetings, he finds
himself without a worthwhile time-consuming vice.
The ultimate addiction comes after the narrator returns home from a
business trip to find that his apartment and all his precious
catalog-purchased items have been lost in a mysterious explosion.  With
nowhere else to turn, he impulsively calls homemade soap salesman Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt), whom he met on the returning flight.  After having
perhaps too many beers, the two get into a playful but no less brutal
fistfight outside of a bar, catching the attention and inciting the
involvement of a few other patrons.  Thus begins the strange underground
society of senseless organized beatings known as Fight Club.
Which leads to numerous scenes of men graphically pounding each other
into a blood-drenched pulp, which, in turn, has led to charges that
_Fight_Club_ glorifies violence.  There is some evidence supporting that
argument: the fisticuffs fuel our emasculated narrator's spiritual
liberation; and Fincher, never one to shy away from grisliness in
previous films, doesn't pass up an opportunity to linger over every last
gory detail.  It is overkill, no doubt--but that's precisely the joke. 
The violence is so extreme as to be over-the-top, much like everything
else in this film--to ridiculous effect.  The fight scenes are really not
all too different opening sections of the film, which detail the
narrator's goods-obsessed lifestyle in often literal detail (at one
point, prices and product descriptions appear in his apartment out of
thin air, turning it into a living catalog page).  In doing so, Fincher
underscores the absurdity of that life--and in the violent scenes, all
the blood just drives home the idiocy behind the
beat-or-get-beaten-to-self-fulfillment philosophy.  
As the underground Fight Club mutates into the very visible Project
Mayhem under Tyler's guidance, the narrator comes to see the light and
sets out to stop his partner-in-crime, which turns out to be much more
easily said than done, but not in the way he expects.  This point of the
story has also been debated about (and will leave a number of audiences
talking), with the negative comments calling it a cheap trick.  Far from
it.  More than just a powerful reinforcement of the film's theme of how
the rigidity of society reins in the freedom to express and simply be who
one is, it also ties into Fincher and scripter Jim Uhls' slyest joke.  I
won't give it away, but it's related to an idea Tyler expresses where
identity itself is a product, with public figures being the walking
billboards for an unattainable ideal.  In that respect, the casting of
Pitt--who does a terrific job in any respect--reveals itself to be
especially canny.
_Fight_Club_ is about submission, but not the bloody submission many men
pummel each other into through the course of the film.  It is, however,
about a different type of submission--that of unique human identity to
the homogenization of consumer-driven culture.  The brave, subversive,
and wholly intoxicating way in which Fincher makes his point is far more
shocking than any fight scene in this stunning and important cinematic
work.

Title
Review for Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2000)
_Hedwig_and_the_Angry_Inch_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        Never mind the fact that she's an East German transsexual whose botched
sex-change operation left her with the titular "angry inch"--the character of
struggling glam rocker Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell) is an absolutely
refreshing screen creation simply due to her appealingly real personality: a mix
of exuberance, self-effacing humor, and unabashed romanticism.  In a similar
vein, _Hedwig_and_the_Angry_Inch_ is an absolute breath of fresh air, due to the
very authentic talents of Mitchell.  As writer, director, and star of this
adaptation of his popular Off-Broadway musical, he pulls off a stunning
cinematic hat trick that's all too rare for a first-time filmmaker.  Not to be
discounted is the invaluable contribution of Stephen Trask, who composed all of
the film's memorable, toe-tapping tunes (I dare anyone to not sing along to the
central production number "Wig in a Box") and has a supporting role as well.
        Being based on what is essentially a one-man show on the stage, _Hedwig_
the film cannot completely overcome one key shortcoming (no pun intended): the
flatness of all characters surrounding Hedwig.  She is the only character
developed to any substantial degree, a problem when it comes time to addressing
secondary but no less key issues such as her current husband Yitzhak's (Miriam
Shor, in an inspired bit of opposite gender-bending) relationship-threatening
desire to don wigs and dresses.  The sketchy development of supporting players
also affects one of the film's main concerns, Hedwig's relationship with
ex-lover Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), who went on to rock stardom with the songs
she wrote; one never quite gets why she is so hung up on such a shallow young
twit, and Pitt's vacant performance (Trask provides Tommy's incongruously
passionate singing voice) fails to fill in any gaps.
        But _Hedwig_ is ultimately about her ongoing pursuit of love and
fulfillment, and that journey is intensely involving.  Through Mitchell's
vibrant performance and smart directing choices (the use of abstract animation
interludes is especially novel), not to mention Trask's indelible melodies, one
gets to know the character so intimately that her unusual life circumstances are
a non-issue.  Hedwig comes to life as a living, breathing, warts-and-all person
who wants nothing more than to be happy and whole, and Mitchell's emotional and
entertaining execution of this universal story resonates long after you've left
the theatre... and made your way to the record store to buy the soundtrack.

Title
Review for Matrix, The (1999)
What is _The_Matrix_?  A derivative mélange of elements borrowed from
other science fiction films, including _Dark_City_, _The_Fifth_Element_,
the _Terminator_ films, _Aliens_, and even this past January's deadly
_Virus_.  Factor in the presence of wooden Keanu Reeves, whose last venture
into the realm of sci-fi was the unspeakable _Johnny_Mnemonic_; Laurence
Fishburne, a fine actor whose talents were lost in uneventful spacefarer
_Event_Horizon_; and Carrie-Anne Moss, arguably the worst actress in the
tantalizingly trashy, much-too-short-lived Aaron Spelling sudser
_Models_Inc._ (which is saying _a_lot_), and expectations aren't exactly
set soaring.  In fact, they come crashing down.
Fraternal writing-directing duo Larry and Andy Wachowski put themselves in
a similar situation with their 1996 debut _Bound_.  In that revelatory
film, they took the unpromising, tin foil-level pairing of Jennifer Tilly
and Gina Gershon as larcenous lesbian lovers and turned into cinematic
gold--no less than one of the best films of that year.  And with
_The_Matrix_, the Wachowski Brothers have once again achieved such a feat
of alchemy, blending these modest parts into a stunning whole that really
has no business working as brilliantly as it does.
Reeves's blank demeanor is a perfect fit for the often befuddled character
of Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer who leads a second life in
cyberspace under the name "Neo."  One night he is contacted by the
enigmatic hacker Trinity (Moss) on behalf of the even more enigmatic
Morpheus (Fishburne) regarding a mysterious concept that has been haunting
him for ages--"the Matrix."
None of this may make much sense in and of itself, but to go into more
detail is the ruin one of the great pleasures of the film: that of
discovery--that of the story's the secrets as the layers are gradually
peeled away and of an entirely new world as imagined by the Wachowskis (and
brought to spectacular visual life by special effects producer Matthew
Ferro).  Once again, they have come up with a story that is smart,
challenging, and completely unpredictable, and their direction is
characterized by an uncommon attention to detail.  For example, the line
deliveries by Hugo Weaving (who plays the sinister Agent Smith) initially
strike one as laughably stiff, but it is eventually revealed to serve a
purpose.
_The_Matrix_ is more than a head trip, however; the Wachowskis deliver the
action goods and then some.  They are the first American filmmakers to
successfully duplicate the wild abandon of the Hong Kong action style, from
a number of exhilarating martial arts fight scenes (choreographed by Yuen
Wo Ping, director of such high-flying HK films as _Iron_Monkey_ and
_Wing_Chun_) to some of the best Woo knockoff shootouts one is likely to
find anywhere.  As viscerally exciting as these passages are, what is
especially impressive is how the Wachowskis come up with an underlying
explanation for all the gravity-defying derring-do--something no Hong Kong
filmmaker has ever bothered to do.
If this review has struck you as incredibly vague, perhaps maddeningly so,
then I have done my job.  As Morpheus tells Neo, ""Unfortunately, no one
can be told what the Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself."  But I
will say this much more: one of Morpheus's repeated urgings is to Neo is,
"Open your mind," and while watching _The_Matrix_ the audience would be
wise to heed that advice.  Fortunately for all of us, the Wachowski
Brothers already have--and the visionary products of their unbridled
imaginations are free for everyone to experience.  (opens March 31)

Review for Quest for Camelot (1998)
With the visually spectacular and entertaining Anastasia, Fox declared
itself a worthy contender to Disney's feature animation throne.  Now comes
the Warner Bros. stab at animation riches, Quest for Camelot, and if this
shoddy enterprise is what it considers topline animated entertainment, the
studio is a mere pretender to the Mouse's throne.
As is the case with most underwhelming live action films, one of the roots
of Quest's mediocrity is the script, written by Kirk DeMicco, William
Schifrin, Jacqueline Feather, and David Seidler from Vera Chapman's novel
The King's Damosel.  The story is just about nonexistent, boiling down to
an extended, uninteresting search for a sword.  Dastardly former knight
Ruber (voice of Gary Oldman) steals King Arthur's (Pierce Brosnan) magic
sword Excalibur, only to lose it in the forest.  Ruber and his crew of
baddies search for it, as does the courageous daughter of deceased knight
Lionel (Gabriel Byrne), Kayley (Jessalyn Gilsig), who is joined in her
quest by the blind loner Garrett (Cary Elwes) and the two-headed
(conjoined?) dragon(s) Devon (Eric Idle) and Cornwall (Don Rickles).
Anastasia set the bar for non-Disney animation high with its opening
glimpse of a stunningly realistic, computer-animated music box.  Quest
counters with a shot has become cliche in live action features: the trusty
camera-travelling-over-water shot.  But this is a minor quibble in a film
teeming with visual problems.  The art is strictly Saturday morning-level,
a point which is underscored further a scene where Kayley and Garrett face
a computer-generated giant ogre; unlike in Anastasia or any given Disney
effort, the CGI and the traditional cel animation do not mesh convincingly
at all.  The ogre, as impressive as it looks, looks completely out of
place, appearing to have wandered in from a better, bigger-budgeted film.
The worst visual sin committed by director Frederik DuChau and the
animation crew is the sloppy lipsynching, especially during the musical
numbers, where the voices often do not match the characters' mouth movements.
Even more distracting is the noticeable difference between the characters'
singing and speaking voices.  In Disney features (or, for that matter,
Anastasia), the singing and speaking voices can plausibly originate from
the same set of vocal cords.  Although there are a couple of
exceptions--Gilsig and Andrea Corr sound remarkably similar as Kayley; and
the Jane Seymour/Celine Dion teamup for Kayley's mother, Lady Juliana,
works surprisingly well--too often the voices are wildly dissimilar.  When
Garrett breaks into song, Elwes's soft, Brit-accented tones suddenly change
into those of raspy Yank country-western singer Bryan White.  The biggest
stretch of all is the tandem for King Arthur: current 007 Brosnan and...
former Journey frontman Steve Perry?!  The stretch casting would be
forgivable if David Foster and Carole Bayer Sager's songs were the least
bit memorable.  Suffice it to say, they aren't.
Quest for Camelot follows the tried-and-true Disney formula fairly
closely--"I Want" song, villainous scheme number, love duet, final
confrontation--but DuChau fails to realize that the key to Disney's success
in animation is not necessarily the formula but a generous helping of
imagination and magic to go with it.  While their Anastasia was not a
complete triumph, directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman were able to create
some superb, haunting moments that rank with, if not surpass, some of
Disney's.  If Quest is any indication, Warner Bros. Feature Animation,
which enjoyed a successful launch with 1996's Space Jam, is severely out of
its depth.

Title
Review for Liberty Heights (1999)
_Liberty_Heights_ (R) *** (out of ****)
_Liberty_Heights_, writer-director Barry Levinson's fourth cinematic ode
to his hometown of Baltimore, plays like a memory, and with that
description comes everything it entails.  While a work of great affection
for the time and place it so painstakingly recreates, the film also
suffers from a problem not unlike one described by the narrator at the
film's end: the images in his memory are not always as sharp as he'd like
them to be.  Similarly, the meandering focus of Levinson's script isn't
quite as sharp as it should be, but there is nothing muddled about the
warm feelings the film strongly evokes.
_Liberty_Heights_ takes its name from a Jewish neighborhood in 1954
Baltimore, the setting for the coming-of-age stories of brothers Ben (Ben
Foster) and Van (Adrien Brody).  University student Van's storyline
follows his attraction to a blonde gentile beauty (Carolyn Murphy) who,
unbeknownst to him, is the girlfriend of his rich preppie buddy Trey
(Justin Chambers).  The more interesting thread belongs to high schooler
Ben, who falls for Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), a fetching young lady who
shares his homeroom.  The complication, however, is that she's
African-American.
Speaking in terms of plot, there is not much at all to either of these
storylines.  But on these thin threads, Levinson hangs a number of
smaller details that lend the film its beguiling and universal flavor. 
While the stories are told from a Jewish perspective circa the mid-1950s,
anyone can relate to the awkwardness and bliss of first love; the pursuit
of that love in the face of adversity, societal or otherwise; the
challenging of stereotypes; and living through a time of sweeping social
change.  The likable cast, in particular Foster and Johnson, make it even
easier to get involved in the proceedings.
Unfortunately, however, _Liberty_Heights_ is not entirely a
coming-of-age of youth, but that of an entire family.  In addition to the
stories of Ben and Van, the other prominent plot thread involves their
father (Joe Mantegna), a burlesque house owner and numbers racketeer who
finds both of his businesses being irreversibly affected by the changing
times.  This thread, which also comes to involve an errant drug dealer
(Orlando Jones), never feels quite of a piece with the gentler youth
stories, and the (inevitable) convergence with Ben's storyline feels
forced.
Levinson obviously enjoys remembering the times of his youth, and like
people often do while reminiscing, he loses track of time.  At 120
minutes, _Liberty_Heights_ is overlong by at least 20 minutes, its energy
dissipating and ultimately completely draining by the time the final
credits start rolling.  But what  remains strong as ever by that point is
the wistful emotion the film evokes, the bittersweet affection that comes
with looking back at an era that was, for better and worse, much simpler.

Title
Review for Fantasticks, The (1995)
        Not all the talk surrounding Lars von Trier's _Dancer_in_the_Dark_
revolves around the film's love-it-or-hate-it qualities (though most of
it is).  With _Dancer_ taking the top prize at Cannes this year and Baz
Luhrmann's _Moulin_Rouge_ on the horizon for next summer, there's been
lots of rumbling about the "return" of the movie musical.  The reality
is, however, it never really went away, just mutated--into the "dance
musical," which is a rather commonplace find at the cineplex these days.
_Bootmen_, the latest of this "dancing yes, singing no" brand of musical
follows a rebellious young male steel worker in Australia wants to become
a tap dancer.  No, producer Jerry Bruckheimer hasn't taken his act down
under and made a reverse-gender spinoff of _Flashdance_.  Not that his
absence from the credits makes much difference, anyhow, for _Bootmen_
plays very much like typical Bruckheimer--all shiny surfaces with nothing
underneath.
For the most part, pretty boy star Adam Garcia perfectly personifies the
faux Bruckheimer feel.  His winning smile should be familiar--he was the
vacuous slab of beef that sent hearts aflutter in _Coyote_Ugly_ (a bona
fide Bruckheimer production, not so coincidentally).  Unlike in that
film, though, Garcia displays some talent in _Bootmen_--the talent to
dance.  That is certainly fortunate since he plays the aforementioned
"rebel" tap dancer, who has real, raw talent but little patience for
uptight tradition; a promising gig with a major Sydney dance company is
taken from him as quickly as he wins it.  So he and a few old friends
decide to pursue an unlikely dream--form their own dance group in their
industrial hometown of Newcastle.  But "Bootmen" (as they call
themselves) isn't your mother's tap troupe--a mix of traditional tap with
the musical cacophony of STOMP and Björk's first musical number in
_Dancer_in_the_Dark_, they're every bit about attitude as they are about
dance.
Director Dein Perry is the creator of the popular Bootmen-like group Tap
Dogs, so it comes as no surprise that the film's dance numbers are the
energetic highlights.  But a Bruckheimer knockoff wouldn't be one without
a dose of treacly and completely bogus emotional content, and Perry and
screenwriter Steve Worland don't fail to deliver.  The threads designed
to lend the film are obvious and heavyhanded--Sean's romance with a
hairdresser (Sophie Lee), who also had a dalliance with his car thief
younger brother Mitchell (Sam Worthington); Sean's relationship with his
disapproving father (Richard Carter), who wants his son to forget his
dreams and hold down an honest job in the factory.  These stories offer
nothing in the way of surprise--except perhaps the amount of violence in
Mitchell's subplot.
With the plot leaving a lot to be desired, _Bootmen_ is left to sink or
swim on the merits of its star--for better or worse.  Whenever the film
gives him an opportunity to flash his fancy footwork or simply stand
there and exude cocky charisma, Garcia is able to coast by. 
Unfortunately, the dance sequences are too few and far between, as are
the moments of silence, thus leaving him too much space to open his mouth
and "act"--something he simply cannot do.  Wisely (though not
surprisingly), Perry ends his film with one big--and, crucially, mostly
dialogue-free--dance extravaganza, but it's too little, too late.
It is tempting to call _The_Fantasticks_, Michael Ritchie's
long-on-the-shelf (it was completed in 1995) film of the long-running
off-Broadway musical as being too little, too late to revive the form of
film musical that is indeed dead--the traditional type where characters
burst into song (and, often, dance) at the drop of a hat and a full
orchestral backing (and chorus) materializes just as spontaneously.  The
film is based on a play perhaps second-best known (behind the popular
pair of tunes "Try to Remember" and "Soon It's Gonna Rain") for its
minimalism in staging and story.  And in remaining true to the spirit of
the original production, Ritchie's _The_Fantasticks_ is hardly
revolutionary; a trifle of a film based on a trifle of a show--and in its
resolutely old-fashioned ways is where its ingratiating charm lies.
The writers of the original play, Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt, wrote
the screenplay, and as such the simple story remains intact.  Neighbors
Bellomy (Joel Grey) and Hucklebee (Brad Sullivan) pretend to feud in an
effort to bring Bellomy's daughter Luisa (Jean Louisa Kelly) and
Hucklebee's son Matt (Joe McIntyre) together.  Their plan works, and they
enlist the aid of mysterious carnival magician El Gallo (Jonathon Morris)
to "resolve" the "feud."  After a long night during which the elaborate
plan plays out and Matt is crowned a "hero," all's right with the
world--that is, until the harsh light of day makes clear how less than
ideal things really are.
_The_Fantasticks_ had long been considered unfilmable since it is
typically performed on a bare stage with virtually no props.  Since such
minimalism is unthinkable for the big screen, Ritchie has opened up the
play to the extreme, filming in full Panavision glory--all the better to
capture Fred Murphy's gorgeous photography of the film's adopted setting
of the '20s American Midwest.  The stunning images, plus the
reorchestrated score (adapted from Jones and Schmidt's original
arrangements by Jonathan Tunick) gives simple scenes such as Luisa's big
"I Want" song, "Much More," an epic quality that harkens back to the
grand screen musicals of yesteryear.
While Ritchie adjusted a number of things in the translation to film,
the one thing he curiously didn't weren't the performances.  On one hand,
this is a good thing; he employed new digital technology to capture the
actors' singing live on set rather than lipsynch to a prerecorded track
(the standard procedure for all other musical films).  But the sense of
intimacy achieved by the live vocals is cancelled out by the broad, stagy
performance quality he coaxes from his cast.  While a seasoned theater
pro like Grey and the luminous ingenue Kelly are able to get away with
some exaggerated mugging, such an approach proves nearly ruinous for the
new kid on the block (in every sense), McIntyre.  Luckily, his
all-too-evident inexperience as an actor is compensated by his sweet
rapport with Kelly.
It also helps that McIntyre, widely thought to be his former boy band's
best singer, can indeed carry a tune, for after all the key to
_The_Fantasticks_' enduring stage success are those memorable, hummable
tunes.  Just as the story is as flimsy and inconsequential as ever, the
music--invigorated by the actors' spirited vocal performances--is still
able to cast a magical spell.   Unfortunately, in this day and age most
people's society-nurtured cynicism has immunized them to the quiet and
decidedly old school delights of a film like _The_Fantasticks_, which is
much too modest to spur on a full-on revival of this type of movie
musical (and, to no one's surprise, its box office returns have been soft
at best).  But for those who still bear a sense of that unabashedly
innocent, almost naive romanticism, _The_Fantasticks_ presents an
inviting opportunity to "try to remember" a cinematic art that has sadly
been all but lost.

Title
Review for Limbo (1999)
For 99% of its running time, the latest unconventional, uncommercial
opus from writer-director John Sayles clearly had me and the entire
audience with whom I saw it.  _Limbo_ is set in sleepy Port Henry,
Alaska, where lounge singer Donna (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, belting
her own vocals) and fisherman Joe (David Strathairn), both damaged from
their pasts, take their first, tentative steps in a romance.  One such
step is Donna, reluctantly accompanied by self-destructive daughter
Noelle (Vanessa Martinez), agreeing to join Joe on a boat trip that
quickly goes awry in a number of ways, leaving the three to fend for
themselves against all manner of threats in the Alaskan wilderness.
The audience was completely engrossed by the intelligently crafted story
and involved in these believably complex characters, all terrifically
played by the lead trio (newcomer Martinez is particularly affecting). 
When the ending came, however, everyone was noticeably upset, as was I. 
Without giving too much away, Sayles extends these characters' emotional
limbo into something literal, and while I understand what he was going
for, it doesn't quite work.  Ultimately, he leaves his characters (and
the audience that grows to care for them) in, as one of the definitions
listed in the film's trailer goes, "a state of oblivion or neglect," all
in the name of a gimmick that is less clever than it is fatally
distracting.

Title
Review for Go (1999)
Since the surprise success of the 1994 Quentin Tarantino film, many films
have tried to become "the next _Pulp_Fiction_."  Films ranging from studio
efforts like the 1996 MGM release _2_days_in_the_Valley_ to the recent
British indie import _Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels_ have, in the
name of achieving commercial success and cinematic "cool," purloined at
least one characteristic of that modern-day classic: the seedy underworld
milieu, quirky canvases of characters played by large ensemble casts,
twisty plot threads linking these characters, "hip" dialogue heavy with pop
culture references, and--above all else--ultraviolence.  More often than
not, though, the films end up not so much cool but cold--as in dead (on
arrival).
With its large cast, crime world setting, and timeline-overlapping
storylines, _Go_, written by first-timer John August and directed by Doug
Liman (who created a different brand of cinematic "cool" with 1996's
_Swingers_), could not tempt failure more dangerously.  Yet of all the
_Pulp_ knockoffs I've seen, this is the first that truly understands and
captures what made that film such a triumph.  It wasn't the casting (though
that definitely helped); it certainly wasn't the violence; nor was it the
snappy dialogue of Tarantino and Roger Avary's Oscar-winning script--at
least not that aspect of the screenplay, anyway.
The elusive quality in question is the element of realistic surprise.
_Go_ spans one eventful 24-hour span, during which the life paths of Ronna
(Sarah Polley), a teenage supermarket clerk who tries her hand at drug
dealing; Ronna's British co-worker Simon (Desmond Askew); and friends Adam
and Zack (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) constantly crisscross through Los
Angeles and Las Vegas.  While following these three threads, August and
Liman find unpredictable yet completely plausible ways to link the stories
and take them in their own wild, roller coaster-like directions--without
ever falling into the cheap trap of gratuitous violence.  To say anymore
would be to rob the viewer of this film's greatest delight: that of discovery.
Not too far behind is the August's sharp sense of humor (suffice it to
say, his hilarious dialogue and original comic situations do have snap) and
the sterling ensemble.  Everyone does a standout job, but especially
noteworthy are Polley, so good in Atom Egoyan's _The_Sweet_Hereafter_, who
takes a surefooted step toward the mainstream; Askew, a newcomer to this
side of the Atlantic; creepy William Fichtner, playing a cop with a hidden
agenda; and Katie Holmes and Taye Diggs shine in more secondary roles.  Not
to be ignored, though, are the efforts of Liman.  He shows a disarming
visual flair never hinted at in _Swingers_ (which was more of a
script-dependent movie than a director-dependent one), and it is his
guiding voice that assembles the numerous parts into a finely calibrated
thrill machine.
Because of its largely youthful cast, _Go_ is in danger of--and, in fact,
already has, to some extent--being pigeonholed as a "teen _Pulp_Fiction_,"
and given the films' similarities, that title is not entirely undeserved.
But _Go_ deserves a more favorable comparison.  While not in the same
league as its precursor, what August and Liman have done is use _Pulp_
basics to create a film that is, by its own merits, a fiercely original and
exhilarating entertainment.

Title
Review for Violon rouge, Le (1998)
Francois Girard's _The_Red_Violin_ is at once a film of great ambition
and simplicity.  In the latter sense, the film is ultimately about its
title: a violin that is red in color.  The ambition comes in following
the title object as it is passed down from person to person, place to
place over the course of three centuries.  The film's artistic success
comes in how it makes its individual pieces interlock smoothly as a
whole.
Although not an anthology film per se, _The_Red_Violin_ suffers the same
pitfall that those films often encounter: inconsistency.  With its main
character an inanimate object, one's interest and involvement depends on
the flesh-and-blood characters and plotline that surround the violin in
any given vignette; as such, some episodes are bound to be more effective
than others.  A major reason for some pieces' greater success than others
is that they simply work well within a limited space of time.  For
example, one affecting story about a orphaned six-year-old violin prodigy
(Christoph Koncz) who is taken under the wing of a French music teacher
(Jean-Luc Bideau) teacher in Austria is simple yet nuanced enough to work
within a 20-minute or so time frame.  On the another hand, the tale that
immediately follows it, about the strange erotic power the violin holds
on a popular concert violinist (Jason Flemyng) in England, feels
truncated and superficial, its enticing psychosexual themes barely
touched on.
Others who come into contact with the violin are a group of gypsies
(their brief, wordless musical interlude bridging the Austria and England
stories together) and a Chinese woman (Sylvia Chang) caught up in her
country's Cultural Revolution, when all instruments of Western
Culture--such as a violin--were destroyed.  While each section of the
film has its merits and importance, the most pivotal points in
_The_Red_Violin_'s journey is its beginning--its creation in 17th century
Italy--and its end: in contemporary Montreal, where the instrument is set
to go on the auction block after a thorough investigation by an expert
(Samuel L. Jackson).
Girard and writing collaborator Don McKellar (who also appears in a
supporting role in the Montreal segment) have come up with two strong
points of unification for the individual stories, one stemmed in Italy,
with one taking strong root in Montreal.  In Italy, the violin maker's
(Carlo Cecchi) pregnant wife (Irene Grazioli) gets a tarot card reading,
which eerily foretells the points of the violin's journey.  Key to the
investigation in Montreal is the mystery behind the instrument's unique
coloring; though the answer doesn't come as much a surprise, the mystery
is an effective unifying overlay.
Of course, the strongest unifying device is the beautiful score,
composed by John Corigliano.  Filled with haunting, often melancholy
melodies that seem to longingly weep, it is a carefully constructed work
of passion--a description that can be applied to the entirety of Girard's
lovely _The_Red_Violin_.

Review for Story of Us, The (1999)
_The_Story_of_Us_ (R) ** (out of ****)
The screen pairing of macho action star Bruce Willis and serious actress
Michelle Pfeiffer appears to be an odd one, and it is the tale of their
surprising electricity together that is the only story worth telling from
_The_Story_of_Us_--certainly not the messy contrivances of this wannabe
weepie romantic comedy-drama.
Director Rob Reiner is a proven hand at romantic comedy, as seen in
_The_American_President_ and, most famously, _When_Harry_Met_Sally..._. 
The shadow of the latter looms large over _The_Story_of_Us_, but it's not
because their stories bear any resemblance.  The "us" whose story is told
is Ben and Katie Jordan (Willis and Pfeiffer), who, after 15 years of
marriage, discover that life is far from blissful.  The film's fragmented
time structure reflects the couple's state of mind as they look back on
their union: the good times and the not-so-good ones that led them to
ponder a breakup.
With these flashbacks ranging from short to long and occurring at the
drop of a hat, _The_Story_of_Us_ is already a mess without a needless
enhancement that Reiner and scripters Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson
somehow felt the need to include: every so often, Ben and Katie are
separately shown sitting on a sofa, bearing their souls directly to the
camera.  It's not quite as annoying as the throwaway interview segments
with old couples that Reiner cut into _When_Harry_Met_Sally..._, but it
has the same obtrusive, distracting effect.  I'm not a terribly big fan
of voiceovers, but if their internal comments were simply heard and not
seen, the film would flow a bit more smoothly.
 And one wonders why the Jordans' marriage hasn't gone so smoothly.  The
audience isn't given a clear idea exactly why things go bad other than
some vague suspicion on Katie's part that Ben is having an affair.  There
are also a number of brief bits showing the two angrily yelling at each
other, and Willis and Pfeiffer play the angry scenes for what they're
worth, but those passages aren't terribly convincing because one usually
doesn't know why exactly what leads to each incident.  The cozier scenes,
which comfortably showcase the two stars' unforced rapport, are more
believable, and as such, the film is heavily skewed toward their happy
times and leaves little suspense as to how things turn out.
Willis and Pfeiffer are ably supported by the likes of Rita Wilson, Paul
Reiser, and Reiner himself; the standout is Wilson, who gets most of the
film's too few good laugh lines.  And that pretty much says all that
there needs to be said about _The_Story_of_Us_: a collection of
performances that are more than the creaky material deserves.

Review for Rang-e khoda (1999)
_The_Color_of_Paradise_ (PG) *** (out of ****)
Like his crowdpleasing _Children_of_Heaven_, the latest from Iranian
writer-director Majid Majidi is also a tribute to the spirit and
innocence of a child.  Here, the subject is a smart blind boy named
Mohammed (Mohsen Ramezani, superb), who is unwanted by his heartless
father, Hashem (Hossein Mahjub).  Hashemsees his son not as a person, but
as an impediment on his forthcoming marriage and a burden on his life in
general.
Majidi takes his time to reach the inevitable crisis where Hashem is
confronted by his duties not only as a parent but a human being, but the
time getting there is fairly well-spent.  While he drives home the point
of Mohammed's good nature a bit too hard (I could've done without the
scene where he takes a fallen baby bird and puts it back in its nest),
the sight of the Northern Iran countryside is stunning; thanks to
Mohammad Davoodi's breathtaking photography, it's easy to see the colors
of paradise.  All this is just a prelude to the grabber of a final shot,
a simple image that is haunting in its ambiguity.  Similarly, the entire
film is memorable in its sweet simplicity.

Title
Review for Object of My Affection, The (1998)
Frothy romantic comedies have become so commonplace at the cinema that
filmmakers now generally resort to gimmicks to set their films apart.  Two
romantic comedies currently in release, The Object of My Affection and
Sliding Doors, each employ a twist that gives its film a certain
uniqueness, but in both cases the gimmicks work.
The Object of My Affection roughly fits the romantic comedy mold.  It has
its share of humorous moments and a romantic issue at its heart, which is
where its twist lies.  After being jilted by his lover Dr. Robert Joley
(Tim Daly), gay elementary school teacher George Hanson (Paul Rudd) moves
in and instantly becomes best friends with social worker Nina Borowski
(Jennifer Aniston).  When Nina discovers that she is pregnant by her
less-than-reliable boyfriend lawyer Vince McBride (John Pankow), she asks
George to be the child's acting father.  His acceptance, not surprisingly,
leads to some emotional complications for the both of them.
More of a surprise is that these complications don't necessarily come
dressed in laugh-ready packages.  Director Nicholas Hytner and writer Wendy
Wasserstein, working from the novel by Stephen McCauley, while frequently
throwing in a comic zinger or situation or two, deal rather seriously with
the relationship issues being raised.  While this approach will certainly
disappoint those looking for a lark like Aniston's Picture Perfect, it was
perhaps the best way to go.  To go for cheap laughs would have been to
cheapen the characters, in particular Nina, whose ever-growing but hopeless
love for George achieves true poignancy.  Adding to the poignancy is the
terrific, natural chemistry between Aniston and Rudd; even though one knows
a romance is impossible, they are such a perfect screen match that one
cannot help but develop a rooting interest for their coupledom.  I just
wish that the character of Vince was better written.  One minute he's a
jerk, the next he's surprisingly gentle; he doesn't quite make sense, and
as such, Nina's initial devotion to him doesn't quite either.
On paper, the twist of Sliding Doors appears too high-concept for its own
good.  Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow, sporting the flawless British accent she
adopted in Emma), freshly fired from her job at a PR agency, rushes to
catch the next train home.  The doors on the train car close just as she
reaches them.  But wait--the film rewinds, and suddenly Helen manages to
squeeze her way into the train as the doors close.  From here on out,
Sliding Doors intercuts between the parallel tales of the two Helens: Helen
"A," who misses the train, and Helen "B," who makes the train. 
Helen "B," having made the train, arrives home in time to find her live-in
boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) in bed with sultry, slightly unhinged former
flame Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn).  In a tiff, Helen leaves him, gets a
makeover, and starts a relationship with James (John Hannah), a friendly
Scottish gent she met on the train.  Helen "A" not only misses the train;
she is also mugged, which makes her arrive home long after Gerry and
Lydia's tryst, of which she remains not-so-blissfully unaware.  In
following the two Helens, writer-director Peter Howitt shows how one
simple, chance occurrence can alter the course of a person's life.
Or does he?  What makes Sliding Doors so unique and rather
thought-provoking is how Howitt holds true to the idea of chance while at
the same time subscribing to that of destiny.  The two stories are
distinctly different, but Howitt comes up with clever "intersections"
between the plots, with certain touchstone events occurring in both stories
(albeit in slightly altered ways), believably showing how, no matter what
happens, the hand of fate is inescapable.  Also inescapable is the type of
person one is, and this is best exemplified by Gerry, who is a cheating
lout in both stories--which is the film's one problem.  Although he appears
to have some genuine fondness for Helen, he is on the whole an unappealing
character, making the story of Helen "A" less vibrant and involving than
the "B" tale, which is highlighted by Hannah's delightfully witty James.
Ultimately, however, the effectiveness of The Object of My Affection and
Sliding Doors is not due to the gimmicks themselves but the filmmakers who
use them with care, intelligence, and style.  If it weren't for their
talent and savvy, the two films could have easily fallen into the gimmicky
romantic comedy scrap heap, an undistinguished group that includes the
execrable likes of Made in America and Mrs. Winterbourne.  And for that,
every moviegoer in the world owes a debt of gratitude.

Title
Review for Steal This Movie (2000)
        Just about one thing separates _The_Cell_ from a pulpy thriller
you'd find premiering on late night cable or your local video store.  But
it's that solitary difference that not only makes it special, but a
cinema landmark or sorts--the visionary imagination of director Tarsem
Singh.  In the hands of this music video veteran and first-time feature
director, a by-the-numbers story becomes the incidental backbone of one
of the most visually arresting films of recent memory.
        Writer Mark Protosevich obviously enjoyed
_The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_, for much of _The_Cell_'s story particulars
mirror those of the Oscar-winning film.  There is a young woman (Tara
Subkoff) trapped in a specialized prison in a dog-loving serial killer's
(Vincent D'Onofrio's Carl Stargher) lair--in this case, a glass cell that
is timed to incrementally fill with water, ultimately drowning the
prisoner.  There is an intelligent, resourceful young woman (here,
psychologist Catherine Deane, played by Jennifer Lopez) who must find out
the location of the latest victim before it's too late.  The high concept
twist?  Stargher is quickly captured, but soon comatose--and the Hannibal
Lecter whom Catherine must consult with is Sargher's own unconscious
mind, by way of a futuristic technology that enables her to enter the
dangerous world inside the killer's head.
        The sci-fi spin is intriguing, but not much else Protosevich
comes up with is.  For a film that is a psychological thriller, the
psychology is dismayingly simplistic.  In her exploration of Stargher's
mind, Catherine uncovers the root of his psychosis, and it's nothing
particularly shocking, if not completely predictable.  There is also a
fleeting reference to an incident in Catherine's past that is implied to
have factored in her career choice as child psychologist.  The heady
issues that are addressed are obvious and shallow.
        But when speaking of Singh's final, finished film, complaints
such as these are almost moot.  _The_Cell_ is a clear, classic case of a
director's vision invigorating standard material.  The film moves at an
effectively erratic pace: action in the real world moves fairly swiftly,
but once it's in the world of the mind, the pace becomes more languid,
befitting the surrealism of dreams.  It is in this latter realm that the
film really soars.  Dream worlds in movies are nothing new--witness the
oeuvre of David Lynch or, for a less highfalutin example, the
_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_ series--but the visual ideas put forth by Singh
are spectacular and unique; there's an atmosphere of excess that hasn't
even been reached in Lynch's famously bizarre work.  Tom Foden's
production design and Eiko Ishioka's costumes are gloriously outré, one
standout being the garishly frightening look of the "demon" Stargher and
his "throne room."  Also adding immeasurably to the mood are Paul
Laufer's grainy yet vibrant cinematography and the CGI work by visual
effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug.
        For all the film's flights of fancy and the script's derivative
nature, _The_Cell_ maintains a foothold in reality through the cast. 
Lopez is convincingly, appealingly smart and vulnerable as the headstrong
heroine; Vince Vaughn is effective in the by-the-book role of FBI Agent
Peter Novak; and D'Onofrio manages to make a lasting, eerie impression in
a very dialogue-light role.  The smaller roles surrounding the lead trio
are all played by familiar, reliable actors, such as Dylan Baker,
Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and Pruitt Taylor Vince.
        It has been said that it's not what you have, but what you do
with it, and that statement applies to Singh and _The_Cell_.  As written,
the film is not terrible, but just average; as executed, _The_Cell_ is,
to use a cliché, something that truly hasn't been seen before.
        D'Onofrio has a lot more lines--and more of a character to work
with--in _Steal_This_Movie_, Robert Greenwald's biography of legendary
'60s activist Abbie Hoffman.   D'Onofrio plays Hoffman, who is best
remembered as the flamboyant leader of the Chicago Seven, a protest group
that stood trial for inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National
Convention.  This, as well as Abbie's retreat to the underground in 1974,
are the key moments in Greenwald's decades-spanning film, which uses a
flashback framework where a reporter for _Newsweek_ (Alan Van Sprang)
interviews loved ones (Abbie's wife Anita, played by Janeane Garofalo),
associates (Abbie's lawyer Gerry Lefcourt, played by Kevin Pollak), and
Abbie himself for a piece sometime in the '70s.
        Aside from Anita--and to a lesser extent Gerry and Johanna
Lawrenson (Jeanne Tripplehorn), the woman with whom Abbie hooks up while
underground--the background players in _Steal_This_Movie_ are barely
developed.  When the Chicago Seven stands trial, the presence of the
other six are barely noticeable, and we don't get to see exactly how some
relationships with key cohorts deteriorated.  However, this being a film
of Abbie Hoffman's story, this isn't too troublesome.  Greenwald (through
his energetic, sometimes anarchic, direction) and D'Onofrio (through his
charismatic performance) bring the man to vibrant life--emphasis on the
word "life."  Aside from the requisite "what happened" text card, the
film doesn't go near the circumstances surrounding his death, which is
perfectly in line with this engrossing film's intent: to be an
inspirational story about standing up for who you are and what you
believe in.

Title
Review for Sweet November (2001)
        If you cast Keanu Reeves in a film with the expectation of him
actually being good, you'd better have a have a role that fits
comfortably within his limited range.  Take, for instance, the films in
which the notorious laughing stock has actually been passable or better:
the _Bill_and_Ted_ films, which made ideal use of his natural blankness
for laughs; _Speed_ and _The_Matrix_, which used his inexpressiveness as
a veneer of toughness; and the recent _The_Gift_ well, credit must go to
Sam Raimi for pushing the non-acting actor into effectively playing a
villainous part no one would think he could ever pull off.  
        Then there's the strange matter of the 1995 romance
_A_Walk_in_the_Clouds_.  Technically speaking, Reeves is his usually
horrible self; witness the embarrassing `Don't you realize how alive she
is?  How _special_ she is?' monologue to see just how wrong he is for the
part of a soulful ex-G.I.  Yet somehow those disastrous displays were
forgivable in the end, and that's because he had such superb chemistry
with leading lady Aitana Sanchez-Gijon.  From their first gaze, those two
smoldered, and when it comes to swoony love stories, that's what counts. 
_Sweet_November_, a remake of the 1968 weepie of the same name, is a
like-minded film that once again finds Reeves in a part clearly not
suited for him: Nelson Moss, a selfish, flamboyant, workaholic
advertising executive.  The difference here is that there is no romantic
rapport to redeem his woeful work or the film itself.
        The lack of spark should come as no surprise, for Reeves'
_November_ co-star is Charlize Theron, with whom he previously
teamed---and displayed little chemistry--in the supernatural thriller
_The_Devil's_Advocate_.  She plays Sara Deever, the type of kooky free
spirit who always comes into the life of the uptight protagonist not only
at just the right time, but in an oh-so-contrived Meet Cute: they
initially encounter each other as they take a DMV written exam.  Somehow
sensing the stress in his life, Sara makes him an unusual offer: to be
the latest in string of one-month-only lovers.  For a mere 30 days, she
will attempt to make his life easier and give him all the benefits of
having a female companion (read: limitless sex), and in return all he has
to do is devote just about every waking moment of said time period with
her.  Once the time expires, so does their relationship, with no
questions asked, no hard feelings.
        So why exactly does Sara do this?  The trailers and television
spots have made the reason abundantly clear, and there's no reason for me
to spoil the late-in-film revelation for those few still interested in
seeing this film.  But even with her motivation in mind, the premise
seems overly mechanical, not to mention dated.  The modern-day
accoutrements (cell phones, a transvestite neighbor/best friend for Sara)
brought in by director Pat O'Connor and screenwriters Kurt Voelker and
Paul Yurick to update the story actually hurt the film even more.  In
this contemporary context, nothing about Sara (aside from
promiscuity-according-to-schedule) seems terribly eccentric.  She's a
single twentysomething.  She's a pet groomer.  She has a lot of plants. 
She has a fondness for scarves.  How any of these rather run-of-the-mill
qualities can make some ice cold slickster somehow change his whole way
of thinking is hard to swallow.
        Of course, there is the fact that Sara comes in the gorgeous form
of Theron, but this usually capable actress manages to make Sara's
perceived quirkiness less than charming.  Theron tries too hard to be
flighty and daffy, and as such Sara appears to be putting on some forced
act, not to mention a bit too pushy.  Reeves' `efforts' fail to make the
strained attraction any more natural--not that anything about his work in
this film can remotely fall into that description.  His stiff yet
overdone swagger as Norman `A' is ridiculous; try not to laugh when he
lets loose what is supposed to be an evil, mischievous cackle toward his
boss.  With the abrupt change to sensitive Norman `B' comes the flip
side: instead of overdoing it, Reeves reverts to his usual screen
catatonia.
        When it comes to these movie romances, however, chemistry between
leads holds a lot of redemptive value.  Unfortunately, Reeves and Theron
are as tepid together here as they were in their last collaboration. 
They fail to convince that what we are told are growing feelings between
Nelson and Sara are indeed signs of true love, let alone some sweeping,
larger-than-life, world-changing passion.  Considering the film's fairly
effective and unusually (for this genre) understated close, `Sweet
November' could very well have been one primo slice of melodramatic
manipulation with the right pair of actors.  Then again, I imagine that
already happened--back in 1968.

Title
Review for Guinevere (1999)
In recent years, onscreen romantic pairings of older men and much
younger women have become more and more commonplace (Michael Douglas and
Gwyneth Paltrow, Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, to name two
noteworthy examples).  However, rarely, if ever, do films make an issue
of vast age difference, even when the audience is slightly discomfited by
the fact that these man can, indeed, be these women's fathers. 
_Guinevere_ is a film far removed from the Hollywood mainstream that
perpetuates that trend, but its intelligent examination of the girl-man
romantic dynamic is a refreshing change of pace.
No female character in _Guinevere_ actually shares her name with the
legendary queen of Camelot, but the pet name is given to Harper Sloane
(Sarah Polley), a directionless recent college graduate, by Connie
Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea), a photographer whom Harper meets at her
sister's wedding.  Connie is much older than Harper, and not exactly the
most handsome man out there, but his way of making her feel special and
wanted makes for the ultimate attraction.  But as Harper soon finds out,
she is only the latest in a long line of Guineveres.
Although the point of view of the film is distinctly female (the
writer-director is a woman, Audrey Wells), _Guinevere_ doesn't stack the
deck against Connie; in fact, the treatment of the relationship is
surprisingly evenhanded.  While there is no doubt that Connie takes
advantage of Harper's youth and naivete, he also helps her and his past
Guineveres find their ambition and direction in life (in Harper's case,
photography).  The extent to which he exploits the young women and that
to which he helps them is left open to debate, but there is no doubt that
the inspiration he gives his "students" is more than sexual.
But that doesn't mean there aren't darker edges to the character of
Connie, and Rea, while always exhibiting a layer of vulnerability that is
crucial to the film's success, also doesn't downplay the somewhat
unsettling mystery about him.  When Harper's uppity mother (Jean Smart)
cuts him down in a most refined yet menacing manner (it's a terrific
scene that could very well win Academy attention for Smart), while one
hates her bitchy attitude, one can still see where the objections are
coming from.  But the film isn't called _Guinevere_ for nothing, and
Polley is the clear standout of the impressive cast.  Not only is she
never less than convincing as both a a girl at the beginning and a woman
at the end, she believably develops into the latter as the film
progresses.
Unfortunately, Wells isn't able to come up with a wrapup that matches
the impact of Harper's journey.  The final scene is a nice and
interesting one, but it seems a bit too sugary to really feel of a piece
with the rest of _Guinevere_--which is smart and compelling enough as a
whole to overcome that comparatively minor misstep.

Title
Review for Rosewood (1997)
In 1923, the predominantly black town of Rosewood, Florida was
burned to ground, its population almost entirely decimated, by white men
from the neighboring town of Sumner... all because of a lie.  This subject
matter provides the basis of director John Singleton's latest film, the
absorbing and potent historical drama Rosewood.
The event that triggers the massacre does not come until about a
half hour or so in, when one Fannie Taylor (Catherine Kellner), a white
housewife, claims that she was assaulted by a black stranger (in actuality,
she was assaulted by her lover, who was also white).  The exposition that
precedes this incident, which establishes everyday life in Rosewood, is slow
going; while it can easily be dismissed as a failure on the part of
Singleton and screenwriter Gregory Poirer, but it's actually a smart move,
for it eventually serves to highlight the human toll of the ensuing massacre
and serves as a counterpoint to all the brutality that follows.  Poirer's
script believably shows how this single claim sets off the whole horrific
chain of events, how a search for one man snowballs into an all-out hunt
against an entire race.  There is also a great understanding of the mob
mentality, as we see the town's white sheriff (Michael Rooker) join take
part in all the killing even though he's never completely convinced by
Fannie's story.
Recently another Hollywood studio production, Ghosts of Mississippi,
documented an actual historical event and attempted to address its impact on
race relations in this country--only to come off as glossy, self-important,
uninvolving, and, most of all, synthetic.  Rosewood, on the other hand, does
feel authentic because it simply doesn't try too hard.  Everything on the
film is done on a smaller scale--there are no superstars on board to
distract from the story, and Singleton, often criticized for being overly
preachy (a criticism that is not entirely undeserved), lets the film's
message be gleaned from the story itself instead of bludgeoning the audience
with it (which he did in his last film, Higher Learning).  He also doesn't
smooth over the material's rough edges; the killings aren't graphic to the
point of being exploitative, but they are graphic enough to convey the sheer
brutality and animal nature of the massacre.
 Similarly subdued to equal effect are the actors.  It goes without
saying that Ving Rhames, who plays Mann, the noble stranger to town--who,
with white shopkeeper John Wright (Jon Voight), helps a number of women and
children flee to safety--is a physically commanding presence onscreen, and
his brawn is well-suited to the role.  But there's real vulnerability and
soul behind the bulk, evident in his expressive eyes and in his warm scenes
with the charming Elise Neal, who plays Scrappie, a teen who falls for Mann.
Don Cheadle, as the vengeful Sylvester Carrier, smartly doesn't overplay his
character's rage--the controlled fury he brings to the role is much more
effective than any histrionics would have been.  The only actor who does
resort to broad histrionics is Kellner; while the woman who causes all the
madness should be shrill, she's shrill to the point of inducing a headache.
Singleton, who made such a memorable debut with 1991's
Oscar-nominated Boyz N the Hood, followed that effort with the disappointing
Poetic Justice and the mostly effective but underachieving Higher Learning,
leading some people to doubt his ability.  However, with his triumphant
return to form with Rosewood, his talent as a filmmaker should no longer be
called into question.

Title
Review for Pokémon the First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back (1999)
_Pokémon:_The_First_Movie--Mewtwo_Strikes_Back_ (G) * 1/2
with _Pikachu:_The_Movie--Pikachu's_Vacation_ (G) *
The question when it comes to
_Pokémon:_The_First_Movie--Mewtwo_Strikes_Back_, is not whether or not
it's any good (and, let it be known from the get-go, that it isn't).  The
question is just how much money it will make in what surely be a huge
opening weekend, for children across the country will undoubtedly make
their parents take them to this theatrical spinoff of the popular
animated TV series/trading card game.  The film could simply be a
_Pokémon_ screensaver projected onto the silver screen, and kids would
want to go anyway, regardless of any objections parents--or anyone
else--may have.
A _Pokémon_ screensaver is what the pre-feature short,
_Pikachu:_The_Movie--Pikachu's_Vacation_, sometimes resembles.  For the
uninitiated, Pokémon are "pocket monsters," little animals kept in "Poké
balls" and are pitted in battles against each other by their human
trainers.  The thin plot thread holding together the twenty minutes of
_Pikachu's_Vacation_ has the most popular Pokémon, the adorable
electrical-powered Pikachu, going to a retreat for Pokémon; the intent is
to study the creatures' behavior while in "a state of complete
relaxation."  Relaxation--to the point of drowsiness--is likely to be
felt by the adults in the audience during this "mini-movie," for nothing
of interest to anyone over 10 happens.  Pikachu and his fellow critters
get into all sorts of competitions and petty conflicts before working
together to get one out of a jam--literally: a Pokémon gets his head
stuck into a pipe, and the others collectively try to pull him out. 
Every so often, as a new Pokémon is trotted out, the screen fills with
its repeated image, not unlike a computer screensaver.  The only
difference is that I've seen screensavers that are better drawn and
animated, not to mention more entertaining to watch.
The jaunty tone takes a surprising turn to the dark side once
_Pikachu's_Vacation_ and _Mewtwo_Strikes_Back_ begins.  The main feature
opens with a scene that seems to be torn from a much more mature animé,
with Mewtwo (voiced by Philip Bartlett), the most intelligent and
powerful Pokémon, murderous rebelling against the scientists who created
him.  Even the narration is strangely pretentious; the first lines spoken
are, "What is the meaning of life?  That is the question that human and
Pokémon alike have pondered for years."
But before long, it's familar Pokémon battle time as we meet our heroes
Ash (Veronica Taylor), Misty (Rachel Lillis), and Brock (Eric Stuart);
and their nemeses, Jessie (Lillis) and James (Stuart), a.k.a. Team
Rocket.  Ash, trainer to Pikachu and others, is invited to take part in a
big Pokémon tournament taking place at a remote island.  Little does he
and his fellow invitees are walking into a trap set up by Mewtwo, who
plans on proving his superior intelligence and strength as well as that
of his troop of Pokémon super-clones.  Naturally, this is just the first
step of a world domination plot by Mewtwo, who hates Pokémon as much, if
not more, than humans, for they allow themselves to be "enslaved."
Obviously, the makers of _Pokémon:_The_First_Movie_ are striving for 
something weightier than the daily cartoon show.  It's an admirable
ambition, to graft on a message while they have the kiddies' unfettered
attention.  What is questionable, however, is the choice of message.  The
tournament on Mewtwo's island becomes one huge free-for-all between the
Pokémon and their super-clones, and the trainers look on in horror at the
violent display.  One character even says something to the effect of,
"It's OK for them to battle, but NOT LIKE THIS!"  Excuse me, but I fail
to see any real difference between this battle and the ones the trainers
routinely stage, except that in this case, everyone's going at it all at
once.  It goes without saying that everything resolves itself in the end,
but what do our heroes learn?  Nothing, apparently, for it's back to
individual Pokémon battles as usual.
If _Pokémon:_The_First_Movie--Mewtwo_Strikes_Back_ had simply been a big
screen version of the cartoon show, it would have been better than the
overreaching, hypocritical mess that it is; why bother with a message if
it goes against what the show is, and then not even follow through with
it?  Children obviously will miss the point, as best summed up by my
7-year-old nephew's reaction after the screening.  While he said he liked
the film, he complained, "There wasn't even a winner."  Of course, one
side lesson of the film is that winning doesn't matter, but you try
explaining that to every child who walks into the theatre expecting, as
the ads and commercials promise, "the Pokémon match of all time."

Title
Review for Phenomenon (1996)
In the summers of 1990 and 1994, two offbeat, quieter films managed
to become major word-of-mouth sleeper hits amid the loud, frenetic action
blockbusters--Ghost and Forrest Gump, respectively.  This year, comparable
sleeper status may possibly come to Phenomenon, a slight but agreeable blend
of comedy, drama, and whimsy.
John Travolta plays George Malley, a simple-minded, goofball auto
mechanic who, after seeing a bright light on his 37th birthday, develops not
only vast intelligence but the ability to move objects with his mind.
Naturally, George's new abilities cause a stir in the Northern California
town he calls home, attracting the attention of Berkeley scientists.
However, there is one person he can't seem to get to pay him enough
attention--chair maker and single mom Lace (Kyra Sedgwick), the Jenny to his
Forrest, if you will.
A lot of Phenomenon resembles another recent Buena Vista release
that dealt with supernatural powers, Powder.  But one of the big reasons why
this new film is as enjoyable and fun as the other was unwatchable and
ridiculous is its healthy sense of humor.  A great move on screenwriter
Gerald diPego's part was to keep George's change a mere physical one, not
also a personality change.  George may become a genius, but he is still a
goofball, as shocked as anyone else at his power.  Since he remains just an
average guy in spirit, George becomes a much more convincing and likable
character than the straightfaced albino "saint" that is Powder.  Vignettes
in which George uses his powers to help others, such as where he tries to
find a lost boy and another moment where he tries to fix his lonely Diana
Ross-loving best friend (Forest Whitaker) up, are funny and cutesy without
being overly cloying.
But that is not to say that there are not moments when director Jon
Turteltaub (While You Were Sleeping) lays on the sap a bit too heavily.  By
far the worst part of the film is an interminable "foreplay" scene in which
Lace gives George a haircut and shave while the easy listening sound of
Aaron Neville fills the soundtrack; the moment is so blatantly designed to
be touching and sweet that it left me wanting to gag.  In fact, Phenomenon's
calculated manipulative tendencies are what keeps it from falling short of
the level of a Gump.  When the tale takes the obligatory melodramatic turn
in the third act, virtually all of the offbeat humor vanishes, and I found
myself not caring as much about the story as I did earlier.
Still, Travolta's effortless charm and charisma kept me emotionally
involved in the picture.  He is one of those stars who is instantly likable
from frame one, and he is put to ideal use here--funny, sweet, with a good
sense of self-aware humor.  It's hard to imagine anyone other than Travolta
(except, perhaps, Tom Hanks) in the role; he's such a perfect fit.  The
supporting cast, including Sedgwick, Whitaker, and Robert Duvall, make the
most of their small but pivotal roles.  Star Trek's Brent Spiner is
particularly memorable in a hilarious bit where he (as an FBI researcher)
attempts to test George's IQ.
Phenomenon is not as satisfying or enjoyable as a Ghost or a Gump,
but it certainly has its charms, and that may very well be enough to insure
its place among the top box office grossers of the summer.

Title
Review for Big Kahuna, The (1999)
_The_Big_Kahuna_ (R) *** (out of ****)
_The_Big_Kahuna_ is based on a play (_Hospitality_Suite_ by Roger Rueff,
who also wrote the screenplay), and first-time feature director John
Swanbeck doesn't hide that fact.  Aside from a couple of location
(Wichita, Kansas) establishing shots and fleeting detours into the
outdoors, the film is set in (as the title of the original play implies)
a hotel hospitality suite that serves as the venue of philosphical debate
between three industrial lubricant salesmen: hotshot Larry (Kevin Spacey,
who also produced), veteran Phil (Danny DeVito), and neophyte Bob (Peter
Facinelli).  Not exactly the most promising jumping-off point for an
exciting, thought-provoking drama, but that's exactly what
_The_Big_Kahuna_ evolves into. As the bickering trio's arguments shift
from business practices to how one should practice one's life in general,
Rueff's script freely confronts thorny issues of loyalty, morality, and
religion.  No easy answers are offered, but enough food for thought is
given to nourish just about any conclusions the audience may arrive at.
_The_Big_Kahuna_ is pretty much all talk, but the three actors bring to
the words fire, feeling, and meaning.  Spacey does a good job, but the
role of a sarcastic, flamboyant slickster is one he can easily do while
comatose.  Swanbeck is able to draw out surprising range and poise from
Facinelli, who had previously done little of note in such timeless
classics such as _Supernova_ and _Can't_Hardly_Wait_; the deeply
religious--but _not_ fanatical--Bob is the crux of the story, and
Facinelli  proves able to handle the demanding task.  His performance is
a revelation, but it's not the best; that distinction belongs to
DeVito's.  Usually called on to play the wacky person in the mix,
DeVito's world-wise and -weary Phil is a beautiful work of gentleness and
subtlety.  In a film of large ideas and screaming voices, his center of
calm speaks the loudest.

Title
Review for Fille sur le pont, La (1999)
_Girl_on_the_Bridge_(La_Fille_sur_le_Pont)_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Very few actors, let alone young ones, can pull off what 20something
chanteuse-turned-actrice Vanessa Paradis does in the opening minutes of
Patrice Leconte's romantic drama.  In a single take broken only by an
occasional white-on-black credit card, Paradis' Adele confides to an
unseen interrogator the reasons for her depression.  It is never
explained exactly to whom she is speaking and in what type of situation,
but that is of little consequence--in these scant minutes, the audience
instantly is given a vivid portrait of what the character is all about:
her youthful recklessness and naďveté, her sexual abandon and her
romantic soul.  While kudos go to writer Serge Frydman, it is Paradis who
brings the scene and Adele to robust life.
However, in Adele's eyes, her life isn't quite so healthy, and as such
she becomes the titular girl on the bridge, ready to jump when she meets
Gabor (Daniel Auteuil), a knife thrower in need of a new target.  Since
she clearly has no fear of danger, Adele is a perfect match--though it
comes to a surprise to both of them just how well they complement each
other, for these two historically down-on-their-luck characters find
themselves on an incredible streak of good fortune as they wow crowds
throughout Europe.  But as with all things, what comes up must come down.
_La_Fille_sur_le_Pont_ is a magical film in all senses.  On a literal
level, the surreal psychic bond that develops between Adele and Gabor
pushes the film into the realm of magical realism, and their knife
throwing scenes bear a not-so-subtle, otherworldly erotic charge.  But
the real magic comes in watching the warm sparks between Paradis and
Auteuil and following their characters' beautifully unconventional
relationship.  Jean-Marie Dreujou's stunning black-and-white
cinematography and Leconte's smart choices in music (there is no original
composed score) add to the film's whimsical, timeless spell.

Title
Review for Night at the Roxbury, A (1998)
_A_Night_at_the_Roxbury_ (PG-13) 1/2* (out of ****)
Two party guys bob their heads to Haddaway's dance hit "What Is Love?"
while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub.  It's
barely enough to sustain a three-minute _Saturday_Night_Live_ skit, but
_SNL_ producer Lorne Michaels, _Clueless_ creator Amy Heckerling, and
Paramount Pictures saw something in the late night television institution's
recurring "Roxbury Guys" sketch that would presumably make a good feature.
Emphasis on the word "presumably."  _A_Night_at_the_Roxbury_ takes an
already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking
point--and that of viewers' patience levels.
The first five minutes or so of _Roxbury_ play very much like one of the
original "Roxbury Guys" skits.  With "What Is Love?" blaring on the
soundtrack, the brotherly duo of Doug and Steve Butabi (Chris Kattan and
Will Ferrell) bob their heads, scope out "hotties" at clubs, and then bump
a select few with violent pelvic thrusts.  There is one crucial difference,
however--these guys speak.
That little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence,
that the Butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new
set of doors for the characters.  The doors opened by director John
Fortenberry and screenwriters Steve Koren, Ferrell, and Kattan are new,
that's for sure, but they all lead to comic dead ends.  There is no story
per se, only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots.  The
brothers literally run into (or, rather, get run into, as in by car)
Richard Grieco of _21_Jump_Street_ fame, and through him they gain entrance
into the exclusive Roxbury club.  There, they meet a hotshot club owner
(Chazz Palminteri, conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him?), who takes
an interest in an idea of theirs.  Meanwhile, the bros' overbearing father
(Dan Hedaya) wants them to stop clubbing.  When Doug refuses and the
dimwitted Steve obeys his father, a rift is created between the two.
The narrative messiness of _Roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all
that went on were the slightest bit funny, but virtually none of it is.
The assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the
entire film, with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end.
Alas, the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _Jerry_Maguire_--will only strike
a chord with people who have seen that film.  Granted, a lot of people
_have_ seen _Jerry_Maguire_, but the fact that the film's best joke is
completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot
about _Roxbury_'s lack of inspiration.
That lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters
themselves.  Like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of
_Saturday_Night_Live_, "The Roxbury Guys" is a one-joke sketch that never
once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive
outside of the sketch context.  After watching one of the "Roxbury" skits
on SNL, this is what you come away with from the characters: they bob their
heads to "What Is Love?", bump unsuspecting women, and... that's all.  After
watching _A_Night_at_the_Roxbury_, you'll be left with exactly the same.

Title
Review for Siege, The (1998)
Denzel Washington and director Edward Zwick have had an amazing track
record together, working on two of the most powerful war films in recent
cinematic history: 1989's aptly named Civil War epic _Glory_, and 1996's
underappreciated Gulf War mystery _Courage_Under_Fire_.  For _The_Siege_,
their third collaboration, Washington and Zwick work with a fictional
war-like situation, and the mediocre result is dismayingly unworthy of
their combined talents.
_The_Siege_ would appear to take an original spin on a basic political
thriller.  After the efforts of an FBI team led by special agent Anthony
Hubbard (Washington), aided by shady CIA operative Elise Kraft (Annette
Bening), fail to end a rash of terrorist bombings in New York City, the
White House takes drastic action--deploying a squadron of Army troops to
enforce martial law in the Big Apple.
This should be the point at which _The_Siege_ takes off, but it instead
takes a turn for the worse.  What had been a rather thoughtful thriller
with some effective suspense sequences (notably a scene with a bomb-rigged
bus, which is prominently featured in the tell-all trailer) becomes
formulaic and, at times, insufferably didactic and sappy.  After some
investigation, the bombing culprit(s) is determined to be Arab, so the
troops round up the entire Arab-American population and hole them up in a
stadium.  This not only leads to some scenes of races uniting to protest
the injustice, but one of the detained is the son of Hubbard's partner
Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub), setting the stage for tiresome "concerned
father" moping and a teary father-son reunion (oops, did I spoil something
for anyone there?).
At the center of _The_Siege_'s problematic final act is Bruce Willis and
his character General William Devereaux, who leads the Army in New York.
Writers Zwick, Lawrence Wright, and Menno Meyjes never figure out what do
to with the character.  Devereaux is shown in the White House earlier in
the film expressing his reluctance to be involved in the enforcement of
martial law, yet by film's end he's become a gung-ho, power-mad zealot,
getting in touch with the _Judge_Dredd_ within and angrily declaring, "I AM
THE LAW!"  An understandably confused Willis, wearing a ridiculously
godawful wig (his hair stylist, Bunny Parker, should be shot), plays
Devereaux as only he can--as if he wandered in from the set of his latest
action opus.  Apparently that bug is contagious, because the overwrought
standoff climax (complete with, yes, a preachy speech) the writers cook up
is straight out of a standard-issue Hollywood actioner.
On the other hand, Bening and especially Washington deliver reliably
strong, passionate performances.  However, as stunning on the whole as
Roger Deakins's cinematography is, his camera is inexplicably unforgiving
on these two powerful screen presences.  Washington looks more than a
little chunky, and the usually luminous Bening looks shockingly haggard.
That mix of the largely good with some glaring bad spots pretty much sums
up the rest of _The_Siege_.  (opens November 6)

Title
Review for Digimon: The Movie (2000)
_Digimon:_The_Movie_ (PG) * (out of ****)
If you think a passing familiarity with _Pokémon_ is preparation enough
for _Digimon:_The_Movie_--the big screen debut of the _Pokémon_
knockoff/rival television series--think again.  In fact, nothing but an
extensive knowledge of the DigiMythos will make the story of this
animated feature the slightest bit comprehensible.  Not that it really
matters, anyway--when it all comes down to it, this is just one
exhausting 70something-minute exercise in hyperactive visuals and sound. 
_Pokémon_ on speed, if you will.
After a baffling and completely unnecessary pre-film vignette about a
rabid _Digimon_ fan waiting in line at a movie theatre and imagining
herself in a _Digimon_ adventure (this piece of work makes the Pikachu
shorts that precede the _Pokémon_ films look like Oscar bait),
_Digimon:_The_Movie_ wastes no time in getting the plot underway.  A
brief voiceover narration by the character Kari (voiced by
_Gimme_a_Break!_ alumna Lara Jill Miller) dispenses some exposition
before the first of what are many battles between Digimon.  Now what
_are_ Digimon, you ask?  The nearest I could figure is that they're some
strange breed of monster that originates in cyberspace but sometimes
crosses over into the real world by way of an egg that somehow emerges
from a computer screen.  How or why this happens, I don't know.  Maybe it
was covered in that narration, maybe not--it is delivered so quickly that
it's impossible to not miss something.
Why do these Digimon fight?  I suppose it all comes down to some being
"bad" and some being "good."  The "good" ones are able to be summoned by
children called the DigiDestined (how they are selected and what they are
destined to do is beyond me) to defeat the "bad" ones in the digital
world.  In the first half of the film, the bad Digimon is a computer
virus that threatens to wipe out the world's computers, and its up to
Kari's big brother Tai (Joshua Seth), the rest of the DigiDestined, and
their Digimon to save the world.  It's no spoiler to say that Tai and
company do... but then the story picks up four years later, with some new
characters and an older Kari facing some remnant of said destructive
Digimon.
All this, of course, would make sense to the target audience of
6-year-olds who watch the _Digimon_ television series every weekday
afternoon on Fox.  But that's a moot point for them, since the show and
the film are all about the fire-breathing, bomb-exploding, all-stops-out
battles between Digimon.  And the makers of _Digimon:_The_Movie_ don't
skimp, barely taking a breath between action scenes.  While this ensures
that the tykes won't ever get antsy, it also guarantees one big
headache--and a severe case of motion sickness to match--for adults.  The
violence may be between the Digimon, but it's the older viewers in the
audience that feel the pain.
The pace may be quicker and the action louder and more extreme than in
_Pokémon_, but that doesn't necessarily make _Digimon_ better.  With the
assaultive nature comes the absence of any slight bit of humanity.  Say
what one will about _Pokémon_ poster critter Pikachu, one must concede
that he has personality, and there is some warmth to his relationship
with trainer Ash Ketchum.  Here, all the characters, human and Digimon
alike, are merely interchangeable pieces in a mechanical game--an apt
description for _Digimon:_The_Movie_, a "movie" in name only.

Title
Review for He Got Game (1998)
The tagline for He Got Game--"the father, the son, and the holy
game"--provides a very clear and accurate ordering of writer-director Spike
Lee's concerns in the film.  While the game of basketball is the film's
unifying subject, this uneven but engrossing drama is foremost an
exploration of a father-son relationship.
The father in question is Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington), a prison
inmate who is granted a temporary release to convince his son Jesus
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen), high school senior and hoops superstar,
to attend the governor's university alma mater the following school year.
The task is not quite as easy as it sounds, for Jake's relationship with
his son became virtually nonexistent following the death of Jesus's mother
and Jake's imprisonment.  The issue of reconciliation is what drives He Got
Game, and Lee deftly escalates the emotional stakes by gradually revealing
Jake and Jesus's turbulent past and the tense circumstances that ultimately
led to their estrangement.
When staying with the driving father-son dynamic, He Got Game often
achieves moments of power, buoyed by a predictably strong performance by
Washington.  Allen is relaxed and assured in his acting debut, but his work
suffers away from Washington; when he is called on to carry scenes on his
own, he tends to stiffen up, and his line delivery comes off a bit flat.
As such, he is a slightly less-than-commanding presence during the
Jake-less scenes, in which Jesus deals with other pressures, such as his
sports-agent-pushing girlfriend Lala (Rosario Dawson) and Chick (Los
Angeles Laker forward Rick Fox), a baller from a prospective university,
who tempts Jesus with horny groupies.  Granted, the air of doubt works in
showing how vulnerable Jesus is to pressure, but it also diminishes
audience interest and involvement.
To be fair, Washington also suffers away from Allen, but this is because
of the comaparatively weak material he is saddled with.  Jake's unlikely
friendship with Dakota (Milla Jovovich), a prostitute who lives in the
apartment next door, is completely superfluous, not to mention
unconvincing; Lee offers no insight as to how or why Jake would develop any
feelings, deep or otherwise, for her.  Lacking in any payoff, and
showcasing an awful performance by Jovovich, this subplot just about begs
to be completely cut out.
He Got Game could have used a clearer focus, but what does come sharply
into view registers strongly: not just Jake and Jesus, but their and, above
all, Lee's passion for the game of basketball.  From the majestic, Aaron
Copland-scored opening shots of people of all ages and places shooting
hoops to the halftime cameos by various NBA stars (yes, including _him_,
who gets the honor of delivering the film's title line) to the late
glimpses of Jesus and Jake alone on different courts, Lee shows how easy it
is to fall under the sport's spell.  Audiences may leave He Got Game not
exactly loving the film, but it is quite possible that they could grow, to
quote the NBA's promotional slogan, "love this game."

Review for Why Do Fools Fall In Love (1998)
_Why_Do_Fools_Fall_in_Love_ (R) *** (out of ****)
As the summer popcorn season winds down, and the weightier fall/holiday
season begins, here arrives a smoothly executed "transition" film, which
tackles some fairly serious subject matter in a fun, entertaining,
guilt-free package.  _Why_Do_Fools..._ centers on the court battle between
the late doo wop singer Frankie Lymon's (Larenz Tate) three
wives--glamorous singer Zola Taylor (Halle Berry), petty thief Elizabeth
Waters (Vivica A. Fox), and demure schoolmarm Emira Eagle (Lela Rochon)--
for his estimated $4 million estate .  Testimony-stemmed flashbacks
chronicle Lymon's quick rise to fame as the lead singer of the Teenagers
(famous for the classic title song), his equally quick fall into obscurity
and drugs, and the circumstances behind his untimely death.
Director Gregory Nava's recreation of Lymon's late '50s-early '60s
performances are exuberant, buoyed by Tate's charismatic performance,
which, in turn, provides a sympathetic anchor when things turn dark.  The
lighter court storyline is a bit more cliched and stereotyped, with all the
verbal catfights between the women, but the appealing trio of Berry,
Rochon, and especially Fox (in the showiest role of the three) make the
proceedings enjoyable.  These two contrasting sides, Lymon's tragically
short existence and the battle between the three widows, are meshed
together with ease into a pleasing cinematic confection by Nava, a proven
hand musical biographies (_Selena_).

Title
Review for Next Stop Wonderland (1998)
_Next_Stop_Wonderland_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
A fresh location, likable lead actors, a cute concept.  The destination of
the romantic comedy _Next_Stop_Wonderland_ would appear to be moviegoers'
hearts.  But as charming as the film often is, something crucial feels
missing on this journey.
That something missing is not the main character, Erin Castleton, played
with a nice balance of edge and sensitivity by Hope Davis.  Erin, a
registered nurse in Boston, is soured on love after her political activist
boyfriend (Philip Seymour Hoffman) ditches her to take part in a protest.
The last thing on her mind is finding a new man, but her freespirited
socialite mother (Holland Taylor) takes out a personal ad in Erin's name.
Suddenly, Erin finds herself fielding the romantic interests of a number of
not-so-gentlemanly callers.
Of course, the ideal man for her is not among the ad respondents.  Could
that elusive guy be former plumber/aspiring marine biologist Alan Monteiro
(Alan Gelfant)?  Alan is a nice, upstanding guy who, when not attending
school full time, volunteers at the Boston Aquarium and tries to raise
money to pay off a loan shark (Victor Argo).  Alan and Erin's paths
frequently cross, but in the film's central conceit, keep on narrowly
missing each other, creating a "will they or won't they" romantic tension.
Or at least that's the presumption made by director Brad Anderson and his
co-writer, Lyn Vaus (who appears in the film as one of Erin's suitors).  As
pleasant as _Next_Stop_Wonderland_ is, never did I get the feeling that
Alan was truly _the_guy_ for Erin.  He's certainly nice, but Anderson and
Vaus never establish any concrete reason why these two should connect other
than the fact that they, the filmmakers, want them to.  Hence, any rooting
interest I had in their meeting came from less an ardent interest in a love
connection than a simple curiosity as to what would happen.
Still, the film holds a quiet, unassuming appeal, due to some witty
moments (an extended sequence in which Erin interviews her ad respondents is a
comic highlight) and, most especially, the endearing performances by Davis
and Gelfant.  While one may not be terribly invested in them as a pair,
they are each so likable that one is definitely invested in them as
individual personalities.  If that weren't the case, the ultralightweight
_Next_Stop_Wonderland_ could have easily been _Next_Stop_Slumberland_.

Title
Review for American History X (1998)
_American_History_X_ (R) *** (out of ****)
"A Tony Kaye film."  "Directed by Tony Kaye."  Whether he likes it or not,
after a still-developing war of words (and very expensive trade ads) with
the higher-ups at New Line Cinema and the Directors Guild, the embattled
first-time feature director has his name on the credits of the release cut
of _American_History_X_.  Much has been made of the issues of artistic
integrity and free speech, but precious little has been made of the film
itself--except that, according to Kaye, it no longer reflects his original
vision.  I do not know what exactly Kaye had in mind for his _X_, but the
film I saw, flawed though it may be, definitely works on its own merits. 
The main reason for the film's effectiveness the impassioned work of
Edward Norton.  He stars as Derek Vinyard, a young man who turns to a
racist gang after his firefighter father is murdered.  Head shaven and with
a swastika tattooed to his chest, Derek is hate incarnate, and his rage
leads to the brutal murder of two black men and a prison sentence.  After
three years, Derek emerges from prison a changed man, determined to let go
of a violent life that, of course, won't so easily let go of him.  It's a
formulaic character progression, but Norton's intensity makes it fresh and
involving.  His depth and nuance convincingly meshes his character's two
sides: utterly despicable and chilling as the skinhead Derek and
sympathetic but--crucially--no less edgy, as the post-prison Derek.
The character of Derek and his personal journey are riveting, but less so
are writer David McKenna's additional narrative touches--namely the focal
relationship between younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), who idolizes
his brother and appears headed down the same destructive path of hate.
Derek's attempts to steer Danny in the right direction is the central
dramatic issue, but there's no real tension.  Danny is less a character
than a plot device, with no clearly defined personality trait other than
his emulation of his brother, thus there's very little suspense as to
whether or not Danny will change.
While Kaye has disassociated himself from all aspects of the film, one
other thing his name is attached to aside from the direction is the
cinematography, and he does a stunning job.  The story mostly unfolds in
flashback, with Derek's despicable actions and brutal prison experience
shown in black-and-white--no doubt a visual extension of the race theme.
But the absence of full color also lends the more violent scenes an added
roughness, and, in turn, a heightened sense of reality.
_American_History_X_ ends on a fairly predictable note, but the resolution
effectively reinforces the film's strong anti-hate, anti-violence message.
Perhaps in Kaye's editing hands the film would have been more well-rounded,
less formulaic, and, as such, more powerful and profound.  Alas, as it
currently stands, the incendiary _X_, for all its faults, still makes a
lasting, thought-provoking impression.  (opens October 30)

Review for Hsing hsing wang (1977)
_Mighty_Peking_Man_ no stars; **** for camp value (out of ****)
On many occasion, Quentin Tarantino has gone on record to say that he
loves _Showgirls_ (in a serious way), so it comes as no shock that the
latest rescue effort by his Rolling Thunder revival label would be a
landmark in grade-A cinematic cheese.  This 1977 Hong Kong knockoff of
_King_Kong_ stars Danny Lee (who would go on to co-star in John Woo's 1989
masterwork _The_Killer_) and blonde Swiss bombshell Evelyne Kraft--or,
rather, Kraft's left nipple, which plays peek-a-boo from behind her
barely-there animal hide top.  For all the ample physical gifts with which
she was blessed (which are heavily displayed throughout the film for
maximum ogling value), Kraft might as well just have been that single
nipple, for she displays just about as much acting range as one.  Take the
scene where she thrashes about after getting bitten by a snake; it's hard
to tell if she's in excruciating pain or in the throes of orgasmic ecstasy.
But, of course, acting ability is of little importance in a brainless
no-brainer such as this, in which a gentle oversize gorilla (make that "guy
in a gorilla suit") who raised an orphaned lass (Kraft's monosyllabic
Samantha) in the Himalayan wild goes on a destructive rampage when brought
to the urban jungle of Hong Kong.  But before the big third act
smash-o-rama, director treats the audience to some of the most
unintentionally hilarious footage ever committed to film.  The biggest
whopper is a doozy of a love montage (involving jungle cats being spun
around in amorous delight) that is made even more of a howler by its
overwhelming earnestness.  When the gears are shifted to the city and the
demolition skills of the big ape, the laugh percentage takes a dive, but
the cheese quotient skyrockets, in the form of some awfully unconvincing
miniature and rear-projection effects.  Though Tarantino may argue
otherwise, _Mighty_Peking_Man_ is one terrible movie, but rarely are bad
movies quite this giddily laughable--making it ideal midnight movie fodder.

Title
Review for Big Tease, The (1999)
_The_Big_Tease_ (R) *** (out of ****)
        Watching the opening moments of _The_Big_Tease_, my heart immediately
sank.  Here was another comedy using the much-exhausted mock documentary
format (last used, to ill effect, in _Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_) only to
frequently break its rules--as in, how the heck did they get all these
angles with one camera?  Furthermore, director Kevin Allen was not
executing the premise--Scottish hairdresser Crawford Mackenzie (Craig
Ferguson, who also co-wrote) comes to Los Angeles for the premier
hairdressing competition, "the Platinum Scissors"--beyond the obvious:
broad, cutesy, and obvious fish-out-of-water gags.
        Then a strange thing happened from the 25-minute mark: I began to be
charmed by this film.  The key to the big turn is that Allen, Ferguson,
and his writing collaborator Sacha Gervasi stop trying so hard to be
outrageously funny and trust the absurdity of the story to speak for
itself--resulting in some golden comic moments, such as one where
Crawford wins over a snooty publicist to the stars (Frances Fisher) by
identifying her entire hair care regimen with a simple glance. 
_The_Big_Tease_ is far from original--it fits squarely in the
_Full_Monty_ tradition of feel-good comedy from the British Isles--but it
gets the predictable job done.

Title
Review for Spice World (1997)
OK, I admit it--I find camp amusement with the Spice Girls.  Yes, the same
Spice Girls of the gimmicky individual "identities," they of the annoyingly
infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of "Girl Power."
But not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn't enough to carry their big
screen debut, a junky mess which would be more aptly named Shite World than
Spice World.
The film begins amusingly enough, with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence
in which the British quintet--"Scary" (Melanie Brown), "Baby" (Emma
Bunton), "Sporty" (Melanie Chisolm), "Ginger" (Geri Halliwell), and "Posh"
(Victoria Adams)--are introduced one by one (to, much to my surprise,
excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience) as they
croon the silky ballad "Too Much" (a tune that would sound right at home in
an actual James Bond film).  A few minutes and an Elton John cameo later
comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the
film: (1) the Spicy ones go on a European publicity tour leading up to
their first live concert at London's Royal Albert Hall; (2) a film producer
(George Wendt) and a screenwriter (Mark McKinney) pitch various film ideas
to the Girls' manager, Clifford (Richard E. Grant); (3) a documentary film
crew follows the Girls; (4) a pregnant "mate" (Naoki Mori) of the group
rapidly approaches her due date; and (5) a tabloid publisher (Barry
Humphries) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky
shutterbug (Richard O'Brien).  Capped off by a live rendition of the Girls'
bouncy hit "Say You'll Be There," a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure
to follow, right?
Wrong.  It's all downhill from there as Spice World collapses into a
series of misfired comedy sketches.  I must give the Girls credit for their
refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves, but writer Kim Fuller and
director Bob Spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them, much
less a organized framework for all the "wacky" goings-on.  Spice World
jumps from vignette to vignette, subplot to subplot with no direction and
little sense, at one minute having the Girls meet with aliens (no joke) and
at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall
into the water during a boat ride.  While a decent joke slips through the
cracks here and there--during a "dance bootcamp" scene, the Girls sing the
lyric "We know how we got this far/Strength and courage and a
Wonderbra"--much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level.
Some gags are just plain pointless, such as Roger Moore's recurring role as
the mysterious Chief, who dispenses cryptic, metaphor-heavy advice to
Clifford.  The only reason why I can think anyone would find that funny is
the fact that Moore once played James Bond.  Ha ha.
As weak as the script is, I think there's one insurmountable problem with
even attempting to make a Spice Girls movie, and that is the Girls
themselves.  The point is not that they can't act (and, for the record,
they really _can't_) but that their individual personas, which works as a
gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video, are too thin to survive
outside of the truncated, video bite MTV world.  Posh (who garnered the
most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions) comes off best by
default because her persona (rich bitch) most easily translates into
character in a film.  Baby's persona (young innocent), to a lesser extent,
also works, but the remaining Girls' identities are a little harder to
flesh out.  There really isn't much to do with Sporty besides having her
exercise every so often (which is _exactly_ what Fuller and Spiers do),
and, after all, what exactly entails being "Ginger" or "Scary"?
Apparently, just their wardrobes.
Spice World manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a
flashback performance of the Spices' signature hit, "Wannabe."  The song is
as grating as ever, but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a
much-needed shot in the arm, setting the stage for a wave of
self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters' film ideas (the film
almost mirrors Robert Altman's The Player in the way the film snails into
itself).  This section of the film, involving all manner of derring-do
involving a speeding bus, is perhaps its most effective, but it also points
up how all the other storylines (the publisher, the documentary crew) lack
a satisfactory payoff.
Spice World is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family, and
it will please the Spice faithful.  But this sloppy enterprise surely won't
win them any new fans, which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its
rapidly waning Girl Power in the States.  Once the hype disappears, Spice
World will likely serve as the the Spices' final hurrah in America.

Title
Review for Jack Frost (1998)
This family fantasy can best be described as a cross between
_Frosty_the_Snowman_ and _Ghost_, with a bit of _Wide_Awake_ thrown in.
The young star of _Wide_Awake_, Joseph Cross, appears to have the "family
film about death" market cornered with this film, in which he plays
Charlie, a young boy learning to cope with the year-ago death of his loving
but neglectful blues musician father (Michael Keaton, who does his own
singing) named Jack Frost.  That name is a bit too apropos, for when
Charlie wishes for his father to come back, he does--in the form of a snowman.
Thus sets the stage for kid-snowman bonding antics that will certainly
delight the kids.  Adults will be delighted by the snowman effects, which
seamlessly mixes computer animation and puppetry.  (Some clumsy compositing
on certain matte shots are easy to forgive.)  However, the novelty of the
snowman effects wears thin after a while, and the older ones in the
audience may find their attention wavering; mine was.  Nonetheless, the
able cast (which also includes Mark Addy and Kelly Preston) keeps the
affair interesting, and the requisite emotional conclusion plucks the
heartstrings with an admirable--and most welcome--dose of restraint.

Title
Review for Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999)
_The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_ (R) *** (out of ****)
The original version of _The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_, released in 1968, is
an ideal project to be remade.  The sleek Norman Jewison-directed, Steve
McQueen-Faye Dunaway-starring caper is an entertaining film, but
certainly not a great one, leaving a sizable margin for improvement.  The
1999 version, directed by John McTiernan and starring Pierce Brosnan and
Rene Russo, isn't that much better a film than its predecessor, for its
inspired updates simply make it an enjoyable romantic romp in its own
right.
The most dramatic alteration is the central act of theft pulled off by
bored billionaire Thomas Crown (Brosnan) is an art heist, not a bank
robbery, and the film is better for it.  An art museum proves to be a
vastly more interesting setting than a bank, leaving a lot more room for
creativity in the caper scene.  (Jewison obviously strained to keep
things visually interesting in his film, employing a busy split-screen
technique that appears terribly dated through contemporary eyes.)  After
pulling off a clever and oh-so-slick scheme, Thomas comes away from the
museum with a Monet valued at $100 million--and with chic insurance
investigator Catherine Banning (Russo) hot on his tail.
And when I say "hot," I mean hot: Catherine may indeed be interested in
recovering that painting, but she's much more interested in Thomas
himself, whose suave, carefree ways arouse--and, in many ways,
mirror--her.  The dangerous affair they eventually fall into makes for
the heart of both this and the 1968 film, and it is in this area that the
newer film makes a stronger case.  Despite the palpable electricity
between McQueen and Dunaway, the original's romance felt rushed and
therefore somewhat forced; here, screenwriter Leslie Dixon (who shares
screenplay credit with Kurt Wimmer, who, in a unique arrangement, handled
only the action scenes) fleshes out the love story, showing how their
basic desire develops into real affection.
That said, the updated romance _does_ have more than its share of
sizzle--and how could it not when it pairs two of the most attractive
magnetic stars (and both north of 40, no less) in film today?  Brosnan's
presence may seem cool to the point of freezing for some, but that's the
key to his allure--his debonair detachment, which is a strong fit for
Thomas.  The stunning Russo, however, is all fire.  A veteran of
adventure films, Russo has finally found a role that enables her to blend
her popular brand of vulnerable machisma with a strong dose of natural
feminine wiles, and she obviously relishes the chance to vamp it up.
This is no clearer than in the centerpiece seduction scene, where Thomas
and Catherine's attraction erupts to a boil during a torrid dance.  (In a
nice touch, the song they dance to is an uptempo rendition of the
original film's Oscar-winning theme song, "The Windmills of Your
Mind"--which also recurs as the couple's instrumental love theme.)  The
scene smolders--and how could it not, especially with Russo shimmying in
a slinky see-through dress?--but it doesn't hold a candle to its classic
counterpart in the original film, where Thomas and Catherine engage in
the steamiest chess game ever committed to film.  While the new scene is
all about sex--and how--what's missing is the added dimension of
intellectual seduction that took place as the two ever-so-erotically
matched wits on the chess board.
McTiernan, of course, has made his name as a crack action director
(anyone _not_ remember _Die_Hard_?), so naturally this remake features a
more elaborate action climax.  What is surprising, though, is that the
complexity comes not in the amount of pyrotechnics--there aren't any--but
in the imagination and smarts behind it.  I won't give anything away, but
the clever machinations are more exciting than any big explosion could
ever be.
_The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_ may be a bit too laid-back and older-skewing
to be a blockbuster hit, but it gives the summer something it has been
sorely lacking: a strong sense of class, which is more than welcome in
this season of crass.

Title
Review for Head On (1998)
A simple "trick" is what young Gabriel (Christian Campbell) has in mind
after he picks up male go-go dancer Mark (John Paul Pitoc) one lonely
night on a New York subway.  But what they get is something more than
either of them bargained for: countless obstacles, from Gabriel's pushy
best friend Katherine (Tori Spelling) and his even pushier (straight)
roommate (Brad Beyer) to bitter drag queen Miss Coco Peru (Clinton
Leupp), prevent the two from sealing the deal.  However, that's just as
well; as their shared night grows longer and longer, Gabe and Mark
experience, as the press notes say, "something more gratifying than a
one-night stand."
Like last year's entertaining _Billy's_Hollywood_Screen_Kiss_, sexual
orientation is moot in first-time feature director Jim Fall's breezy,
single-day-spanning romantic comedy.  The point is not that the main
characters are homosexual but that they are, like anyone in the world,
searching for some type of human connection--not just with others, but
with themselves, for aspiring Broadway composer Gabriel must learn to
find the passion within himself to fuel his work.  Adding greatly to the
film's universal accessibility is the likable pair of leads and an able
supporting cast--yes, even notorious over-hacktress Spelling, who is
perfectly cast as the histrionic and pretentious off-off-off-Broadway
hacktress Katherine.
On the other hand, "accessible" and "likable" aren't exactly the words
I'd apply to_Head_On_, a dark 1997 Australian gay-themed drama just about
to receive exposure on this side of the Pacific.  The main character of
Ari (Alex Dimitriades) is about as unlikable as one can get: lazy and
selfish, he spends his days and nights indulging in drugs and reckless,
anonymous sex when not arguing with his strict (and completely oblivious)
Greek parents and anyone else who dare cross him.  Consequently, as
director Ana Kokkinos unflinchingly tracks one typically destructive
24-hour span of Ari's directionless existence, one watches with the same
emotional detachment with which Ari tackles his own life.
But there is a method to this madness, and a universal, if rather bleak,
message to the film.  "I'm not going to make a difference, I'm not going
to change a thing," concludes Ari late in the film, and while most people
are afraid to admit it, that's pretty much the futile fate of every
single person on this planet, regardless of what good one attempts to
make of one's life (a certain recent outside event has certainly taught
me that); it's just that Ari bears no illusions about himself or how the
world works.  It's a testament to the sheer gutsiness of Dimitriades's
uninhibited performance that the audience bears no illusions about Ari
either.  _Head_On_ is certainly a film more easily admired than enjoyed,
but there is much to admire in this bold, unsettling film.  (_trick_
opens July 23; _Head_On_ opens August 13)

Title
Review for Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, The (2000)
_The_Flintstones_in_Viva_Rock_Vegas_ (PG) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
When Universal announced plans to make a prequel to its horrendous 1994
live-action take of the beloved '60s animated TV series, the general
reaction was, "WHY?"  No one liked the film; in fact, most flat out hated
it (myself included), yet it still eked out $100 million-plus gross
(thanks to the hype machine)--which, of course, is justification enough
in Hollywood.  Hence, it would have been easy for returning director
Brian Levant to continue to be lazy with the development of the script
and simply just pay attention to the production design, as he did in the
first film.  It appears, however, he felt he had something to prove after
the original film's near-universal thrashing.
With _Viva_Rock_Vegas_, Levant is getting a better idea as to how to
bring the modern Stone Age family to life.  Unlike the original film, the
prequel actually has a story, and a cute and interesting one at that: the
courtship of Fred (Mark Addy) and Wilma (Kristen Johnston) as well as
that of Barney (Stephen Baldwin) and Betty (Jane Krakowski).  There are
complications, namely the machinations of the wealthy Chip Rockefeller
(Thomas Gibson), whom Wilma's snooty mother Pearl (Joan Collins) deems a
more suitable match for her daughter.  Addy, Krakowski, Baldwin, and
Collins are much better fits for their roles than their predecessors
(John Goodman, Rosie O'Donnell, Rick Moranis, and Elizabeth Taylor,
respectively).  Baldwin is especially a surprise; while he looks nothing
like his cartoon counterpart, once he opens his mouth, he simply _is_
Barney.  As much as Levant does get right here (including, of course, the
production design and costumes, which are again perfect to the last
detail), two missteps keep me from giving a recommendation.  The Great
Gazoo (Alan Cumming), a tiny green alien that appeared in a number of the
TV episodes, is needlessly and awkwardly incorporated into the story; and
Johnston never convinces as Wilma--the look, voice, and attitude is all a
bit off.  Replace her with the far superior original Wilma, Elizabeth
Perkins, and Levant has the makings for a potentially successful third
installment--that is, if his writing crew (which, for _Viva_, is far
smaller than the infamous 32-person committee employed by the original)
can come up with another engaging story.  Given the unfavorable odds, all
involved would probably be better off leaving well enough alone.

Title
Review for Virus (1999)
You got to love January--where else can you find such cinematic schlock
that studios not only spent millions of dollars on, but also believed
would make millions for them in return?  It seems that every January at
least one studio dumps a pathetic excuse for a sci-fi thriller upon the
moviegoing audience.  In 1997, it was _The_Relic_, which should have
remained undiscovered; last year, it was _Phantoms_, which will surely
continue to haunt the careers of all involved, especially Hollywood "it"
boy Ben Affleck.  This year's selection (sacrifice?) is _Virus, a
thoroughly ridiculous sci-fi yarn whose abundance of unintentional laughs
fail to compensate for the lack of thrills.
_Virus_ had been bounced around Universal's release schedule like a hot
potato, most recently scheduled for a July opening.  Universal's official
reason for this latest shelving was the conflict with another Jamie Lee
Curtis starrer, _Halloween:_H20_; but watching the film, it's obvious
that the true reason was something much simpler: the film just plain
stinks.  _Virus_ does get off to an interesting enough start, though,
when a mysterious electrical force of alien origin makes its way onto a
Russian ship through a transmission with the Mir space station.  Days
later, the high-tech is found abandoned by an American shipping crew, who
decides to poke around.  Of course, this proves to be a deadly mistake,
for the alien life form has taken over the ship.
As with any action flick, the film is only as good as its villain, and
once _Virus_ offers a glimpse of our alien, all hopes of a decent thrill
ride are instantly dashed.  The alien lacks a body, so it constructs its
own out of parts found on the ship.  It sounds somewhat interesting, but
in execution is laughable, especially some fearsome creatures which are
little more than video cameras atop metal spider legs.  Oooh, scary.  The
more elaborate creations, featuring human body parts mixed with
electronics aren't especially frightening because the audience has seen
it before--it's just another gloss on _The_Terminator_.  The "main"
creature is especially disappointing, a large mass of scrap metal that
bears a striking resemblance to the unmenacing title robot adversary in
the dreary sequel _RoboCop_2_.
I haven't yet mentioned the actors because, frankly, they don't really
matter in a film such as this.  Even so, it must be noted that there is
some dreadful performances on display here.  Vying neck-and-neck for
worst acting honors (no small feat here) are Donald Sutherland and Joanna
Pacula, both varying grades of ham as the Yank crew captain and the only
survivor of the Russian crew, respectively.  Billy "refer to me as
William" Baldwin fares better here than in his previous action role in
the famous folly _Fair_Game_, but that's not saying much.  By default,
Curtis comes off best, but her earnest performance would be better suited
for a more intelligent, exciting script, one where "What the hell was
that?" and "What the hell is going on?" don't make up 95% of the
dialogue.
The latter quote is likely one that will be asked by audiences as they
are watching _Virus_, and the former once they walk out of the theatre. 
_Virus_ is one of those cinematic disasters that leaves one wondering
what the hell everyone involved--from the cast and crew to the studio
production heads who greenlighted the project--were thinking.

Title
Review for One Night Stand (1997)
One Night Stand (R) ** (out of ****)
        One Night Stand began life as another Joe Eszterhas sex romp, but after
Leaving Las Vegas's Mike Figgis came on board to direct and extensively
rewrite the script, Eszterhas amicably relinquished all writing credit.
Figgis's resulting film is perhaps more serious-minded than Eszterhas
originally intended, but after a promising start, this look at adultery
loses its way--and, in the end, anything resembling a point.
        The film begins rather oddly, with Max Carlyle (Wesley Snipes, who won the
Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his fine performance) emerging
from a New York hotel and introducing himself directly to the camera.  He
is a successful Los Angeles commercial director, with a large house, a
beautiful wife named Mimi (Ming-Na Wen), and two young children.  Max's
family does not accompany him on this trip, which he makes partly for
business but mostly to reconnect with his former best friend, gay,
AIDS-stricken performance artist Charlie (Robert Downey Jr.).
        Unexpected chaos and confusion (involving a hotel clerk played by Figgis
himself, hiding his moptop under a bad Elvis-like wig) prompt Max to stay
in New York for an extra night, and by chance he meets Karen (Nastassja
Kinski), a mysterious blonde who is also married.  The traumatic
circumstances that lead to the titular adulterous encounter are mechanical,
but, under the director's capable hand, they are quite believable, and when
the two do fall into bed, it is depicted in a non-exploitative (and very
non-Eszterhas) fashion: brief glimpses, sensuously scored by Figgis
himself, punctuated by fadeouts (the latter a visual flourish Figgis comes
to overuse as the film progresses).
         The next day Max returns home to L.A. feeling removed from his life, and
this is where the film starts running into some trouble.  While the reasons
behind his feelings of detachment are completely understandable, those
behind the strain between Max and Mimi are not.  Certainly the one night
would cause some marital turbulence, but it is implied that their marriage
already had some underlying problems, a point which is poorly established
(the only detectable problem is Mimi's aggressiveness in the bedroom).
More strain comes a year later, when Max, this time with Mimi in tow,
returns to the Big Apple to visit the now-bedridden Charlie, and
reencounters Karen, who, as it turns out, is married to Charlie's brother
Vernon (Kyle MacLachlan).
        With his discreet handling of the one night, Figgis successfully
establishes that the Max and Karen's initial encounter is not about a cheap
thrill.  But it is also meant to show a passionate spiritual connection
being made between Max and Karen, which I could not grasp; instead I simply
saw two people clinging to each other in a moment of weakness--no more, no
less.  So when the reunited Max and Karen try hard to not give in to their
feelings, one wonders exactly what those feelings are.  Lust?  No; their
night together is shown as more than a cheap thrill.  Love?  That seems to
be the intent, but one never gets a clear idea of it, especially since we
get no real insight into what Karen feels the whole time, and Kinski adds
no dimension to her flatly written role.  In fact, the only characters that
are not written with any depth are Max and Charlie (marvelously played by
Downey), who, not surprisingly, serves as the voice of reason.
        Figgis told Entertainment Weekly that he does not think that any of the
original Eszterhas script remains in the film, but one would never guess
based on the pair of twists that cap the film.  Lacking in any concrete
buildup, subtle or overt, these developments seem to come straight out of
Eszerhas's manipulative bag of tricks.  As problematic as I found One Night
Stand to be for much of its running time, at the very least it appeared to
be setting up a point.  But by the time the conclusion rolls around, you
wonder if Figgis ever really had one.

Title
Review for Love & Sex (2000)
        Speaking from the story perspective, _Love_&_Sex_ doesn't cover
much of anything that hadn't already been addressed in other romantic
comedies.  But at the center of writer-director Valerie Breiman's
Sundance crowdpleaser are the special qualities that would make the most
familiar scenario completely fresh: a breakthrough performance by star
Famke Janssen; and sparkling chemistry with her leading man, Jon Favreau.
        Janssen, most widely known for the empowered female types she's
played in films such as _X-Men_ and especially _GoldenEye_, is a
revelation as Kate Wells, magazine writer and perpetual screw-up in the
ways of romance.  In a role that for once neither relies on her imposing
physicality nor stunning beauty, Janssen reveals a beguiling
vulnerability and wonderful comic flair as Kate revisits her romantic and
sexual misadventures while attempting to write an article about finding
the perfect man--a subject that could not be more foreign to her.  Nearly
every one of Kate's stabs at romance has ended in disaster, from her
first crush in elementary school to a fling with a married man, with an
ill-advised dalliance with her high school French teacher taking place
somewhere in between.
        But there was one man who could have very well been "it"--Adam
Levy (Favreau), an artist with whom Kate has had her most rewarding and
least dysfunctional relationship.  Favreau, who was most recently
stripped of his innate likability as a one-dimensional tough guy in
_The_Replacements_, reminds why his big splash, _Swingers_, remains an
indie fave nearly four years after its initial release.  Sporting an
unruly haircut with scruffy sideburns and often wearing paint-stained
casual wear, his Adam certainly doesn't look like a typical movie leading
man--but Favreau's portrayal nails down harder-to-achieve allure: low-key
confidence and a down-to-earth, playful sense of humor.
        That latter area is where Kate and Adam, Janssen and Favreau, and
Breiman and the audience really connect.  There is a sense of fun when
these two are together, and not the artificially sunny type of movie
happiness; just as doing a typically awkward striptease in front of a
camcorder is good for a laugh, so are more grounded moments like pointing
out each other's physical flaws; nonchalantly doing what would normally
be embarrassing in the comfort of bed; and coming up with knowingly dumb
yet intimately special terms like "I cheese sandwich you."
        But as the film reveals from the beginning, this relationship
turns sour as well, and here Breiman also runs into some trouble. 
Numerous situations come out of the school of sitcom contrivance, such as
Kate and Adam trying to make each other jealous by fawning over others;
and an all-too-coincidental bump-in between Kate, Adam, and his new
girlfriend at a movie theatre.
        Those are just the most familiar moments in _Love_&_Sex_, which
indeed takes a few more steps on a well-worn cinematic path.  However,
the success of films like these is largely dependent on the stars, and
with Favreau and especially Janssen--who should find a host of even more
varied acting opportunities open to her after this--striking real sparks,
_Love_&_Sex_ is an engaging and satisfying love story that deserves to
break out of the arthouse pack.

Title
Review for Lolita (1997)
After seeing Adrian Lyne's much-talked-about screen version of Vladimir
Nabokov's _Lolita_, I can easily see why it's taken the better part of two
years for the film to find an American distributor--but it's not for the
reasons you might think.  Lyne's take on the classic tale of pedophilic
lust is just about the opposite of what one would expect from the director
of bankable, tawdry zeitgeist-tappers _Fatal_Attraction_ and
_Indecent_Proposal_.  It is nicely composed, careful, tasteful... to the
point of frigidity.  For all the taboos it covers, _Lolita_ is strangely
staid and uninvolving piece of work, a film whose only commercial prospects
with in the manufactured controversy surrounding it.
Unlike Stanley Kubrick's blackly comic 1962 version of Nabokov's novel,
Lyne and screenwriter Stephen Schiff take a stately approach to the
controversial story.  This works for the general setup, especially the
elegant prologue, in which the sexual proclivities of professor Humbert
Humbert (Jeremy Irons) are explained: when he was 14, he was deeply in love
with a same-aged girl who eventually fell ill and died; ever since, he has
lusted over nyphets.  Flash forward to 1947, and Humbert finds his ultimate
object of desire in Dolores Haze, a.k.a. Lolita (Dominique Swain), the
feisty 14-year-old daughter of Charlotte (Melanie Griffith, her shrillness
working for once), the widow in whose home he rents a room.  To remain
close to Lolita, Humbert impulsively marries Charlotte, which sets off a
chain of events that leads to Humbert taking stepdaughter Lolita, now his
very willing lover, on wild road trip across America.
Once _Lolita_ hits the road, Lyne's glacial style keeps the audience at a
distance and saps just about all the energy from the film.  The film soon
settles into a cyclic stop-and-go rhythm where Lolita's naturally childish
behavior incenses Humbert, he pines for her, she uses it to her advantage
and gets him back, only to anger him again.  Lyne is understandably
discreet with the sexual encounters between Humbert and Lolita, and his
adherence to taste is admirable.   However, the most effective moments in
_Lolita_ are those where Lyne doesn't play it safe and dares to unsettle
the audience, which is what he's built his entire career on.  Particularly
effective is a disturbing scene where a mad--with lust, and in the literal
sense--Humbert tries to fuck a confession out of a hysterically laughing,
lipstick-smeared Lolita.  It's a creepy scene, one bound to get under
moviegoers' skin.  But it's likely the only one that will elicit any type
of emotional reaction from the audience--not even the inevitable tragic
conclusion packs much of a punch, if any.
What makes  _Lolita_ all the more disappointing is that it is clearly less
than the sum of its parts, which all-too vividly display signs of life the
entire film the could have had.  Irons gives a beautifully nuanced
performance; while the audience is repulsed by his actions, one cannot help
but have some understanding for what he feels and why.  The
then-15-year-old Swain, who went on to co-star as John Travolta's
Lolita-ish daughter in _Face/Off_, more than holds her own, playing Lolita
as equal parts victim and vixen.  Ennio Morricone's score is hauntingly
sensual, as is the soft lensing of cinematographer Howard Atherton.  It's
unfortunate that their superlative work is in the service of a mediocre
vehicle.
With films such as _Fatal_, _Indecent_, and _9_1/2_ Weeks_ under his belt,
Lyne seems to pride himself on making provocative films about sexuality.
_Lolita_ should have been the most provocative of them all; all the
individual ingredients were in place for a thoughtful, daring, yet
nonexploitative work.  Alas, his _Lolita_, with its distant earnestness and
leisurely pace, might as well have been a Merchant Ivory production.  (airs
August 2 on Showtime; "officially" opens in theatres September 25)

Title
Review for George of the Jungle (1997)
George of the Jungle (PG) no stars (out of ****)
        Hollywood's track record in bringing old television cartoons to real
life in the big screen hasn't exactly been good, to the say the least: in
1980, Popeye came to theatres in Robert Altman's musical oddity; 1994 saw
the heavily hyped but thunderously boring The Flintstones.  The track record
doesn't get any better with Sam Weisman's thoroughly unwatchable treatment
of Jay Ward's 1960s animated series.
        Brendan Fraser stars as the title character, the wide-eyed king of
the jungle who has a problem with crashing into trees; Leslie Mann is the
love interest, heiress Ursula Stanhope; John Cleese provides the voice of
George's simian sidekick, an ape named Ape; and Thomas Haden Church is the
villainous Lyle Van de Groot, Ursula's fiance.  So what is the film about?
Don't ask scripters Dana Olsen and Audrey Wells.  Their script is a mess,
heavy on slapstick pratfalls ("when in doubt, have George slam into
something" seems to be their philosophy) and groaner one-liners, light on
anything resembling a plot--and without any dramatic structure, the film
seems to drag on and on and on (and then some) without any rhyme or reason.
Olsen and Wells try to infuse some irony into the proceedings through the
use of an unseen, pompously self-aware narrator (Keith Scott).  The attempt
at self-mocking is admirable, but the writers just don't seem to realize
just how bad it all is, from the overly broad performances (Fraser's George
is more of an annoying dimwit than a charming innocent) to the cheap-looking
jungle sets.  The one thing one would think the film would at the very least
get right is the nostalgia kick from its bouncy theme song.  Alas, even that
is botched--instead of using the original version from the TV show during
the main titles, Weisman serves up an alterna-rock-inflected version by the
Presidents of the United States of America.
        At a tick over 90 minutes, the painfully forced, unfunny George
feels three times its actual length, if not more.  At the media screening,
the guy sitting behind me could be heard loudly snoring during the third
act.  We should all be so lucky.

Title
Review for Ready to Rumble (2000)
_Ready_to_Rumble_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
Professional wrestling has long suffered the criticism that it caters to
the most lowbrow audience with its barely organized displays of violence.
 But as low as wrestling goes, rarely does it plunge to the crass depths
explored by the wrestling-themed comedy _Ready_to_Rumble_, which goes out
of its way to prove that tastelessness does not equal comic inspiration.
To their credit, writer Steven Brill and director Brian Robbins satisfy
their crudest instincts in the film's early stages, which concerns
fanatical World Championship Wrestling (as opposed to World Wrestling
Federation) fans Gordie (David Arquette) and Sean's (Scott Caan) search
for their hero, dethroned and disgraced wrestling champion Jimmy King
(Oliver Platt).  Gordie and Sean work in sanitation--namely, the cleaning
of portapotties--so leave it to Brill and Robbins to not leave any raw
sewage joke uncovered.  They even go the extra mile, venturing beyond
mere jokes about excrement and flatulence into the territory of crab
lice.  Prefer cheap slapstick over bodily function humor?  Worry you
not--the film's opening "match" set in a convenience store is but the
first in a very long line of brutal fights unsuccessfully played for
laughs.
_Ready_to_Rumble_ is rated PG-13, and it provides ample ammunition for
the argument that the MPAA ratings board is extremely lenient when it
comes to violence.  Very little blood is shed in _Rumble_, but many
severe beatings are suffered by a number of characters, including a
"Nitro Girl" cheerleader named Sasha (Rose McGowan) at the hands of her
"boyfriend" Gordie.  While there is no doubt as to the less-than-serious
intent, there is nothing particularly cartoonish about the execution:
those are real kicks and punches being thrown, and genuine body slams and
other wrestling maneuvers being performed.  While being inundated with so
much brutality for such a long while, it's impossible to stop lightly
giggling (which is the most any of the mayhem will induce) and start
cringing.
While such poor content makes it mighty tempting to walk out of the
auditorium and never return, I remained curiously fascinated for a couple
of reasons.  First, the film is so audacious in its stupidity I had a
masochistic urge to see just how low it would go.  Second, I was taken
aback by the actors, who displayed some admirable conviction in their
work--a fact made more admirable by the questionable nature of their
material.  Gordie and Sean do find "the King" and help him mount a
comeback, and the uphill struggle back to glory is given some
surprising--and wholly undeserved--resonance by Platt.  And though
they're called on to do nothing more than play obnoxious jackasses for
the entire run time, there's also no question that Arquette and Caan
succeed in fulfilling that requirement.
In the world of professional wrestling, the World Championship Wrestling
organization is widely regarded as being a bit more tasteful and--dare I
say it--classy than its raunchier (and more popular) rival, the World
Wrestling Federation.  I guess the WCW higher-ups figures that if they
can't beat 'em, join 'em, for the big screen commercial that is
_Ready_to_Rumble_ just proves that the WCW can sink to the same lows in
taste, albeit in a more spectacular, big-screen fashion.

Title
Review for Still Breathing (1998)
A plot contrivance of mammoth proportions threatens to sink the romantic
comedy _Still_Breathing_ just as it makes its first attempts to get off the
ground.  San Antonio, Texas street performer Fletcher McBracken (Brendan
Fraser) somehow, someway sees a vision of one Roz Willoughby (Joanna Going)
narrowly escaping a mugging attempt on a Hollywood street.  Convinced that
Roz is his soulmate--apparently, his father, grandfather,
great-grandfather, and so on had envisioned their eventual wives before
ever meeting them--Fletcher flies to the left coast to find her.
This rather hard-to-swallow bit of magical realism, ironically enough,
sets the stage for some very effective magic of a different sort--that of
assured writing and direction, courtesy of first-timer James F. Robinson.
It is revealed that Roz is far from the angel that Fletcher thinks she is;
in fact, she is a con artist who teases and fleeces wealthy men, and she
hooks up with Fletcher believing him to be a rich Texan mark set up by a
friend (Ann Magnuson).  While Roz's less-than-pure, emotionally detached
nature is not the most original plot complication in and of itself, a
complication stemming from this trait adds a fresh wrinkle to the formula.
In most contemporary romantic comedies, the lovers fail to realize they are
perfectly matched until the last reel.  Here, Fletcher and even Roz
recognize their unique compatibility fairly early on.  So it is not a
question as to whether Fletcher is the right guy for Roz--it's whether or
not Roz, who has long renounced true love and emotion in favor of
admittedly empty riches, is willing to allow herself such happiness.
Roz's emotional predicament is brought to vivid, sometimes heartbreaking
life by the luminous Going, of whom I've been a big fan since her
television days (am I the only one who fondly remembers her work on the
1990 revival of _Dark_Shadows_?).  She also shares a natural rapport with
Fraser, who is her perfect screen complement.  He has much less of a
character to work with--Fletcher is simply a nice, somewhat naive
romantic--but he fills in the blanks with an appealing dose of charisma and
self-deprecating humor.  Fraser's effortlessly charming performance makes
it easy to see how Fletcher can win over a hard cynic like Roz.
For all its freshness, _Still_Breathing_ ends up exactly where one would
expect.  But as with many journeys, the trip is more important than the
ultimate destination, and the one taken by Roz and Fletcher is sweet,
moving, and with an irresistible magic all its own.

Title
Review for Red Planet (2000)
The latter half of _Mission_to Mars_, directed by Brian DePalma and
released by Disney earlier this year, justifiably left viewers with a bad
taste with its high-minded but lame-brained artistic pretensions.  But an
unfortunate side effect was that the decent first half of the film,
capped by a suspenseful domino-effect disaster sequence, was completely
forgotten.  In the case of _Red_Planet_, however, there's nothing of
merit to forget--or, at least, the film's only redeeming quality, its
perfectly solid visual effects, show up onscreen constantly enough to
remind us of the wasted effort turned in by the FX crews.
The year is 2050, and we are told through voiceover by one Commander
Kate Bowman (Carrie-Anne Moss) that the earth has become so polluted that
it will soon no longer be able to sustain life.  All sights have been set
on Mars, where algae has been planted by unmanned probes to generate
oxygen.  But something has gone wrong, and a crew led by Bowman has been
sent to the red planet to figure out what.  After a shuttle landing
mishap strands Gallagher (Val Kilmer), Burchenal (Tom Sizemore),
Pettengill (Simon Baker), Santen (Benjamin Bratt), and Chantilas (Terence
Stamp) on the Mars surface and leaves Bowman aboard the main orbiting
spacecraft, the crew is given even more problems to solve.
Their problems, however, are none compared to the ones faced by director
Antony Hoffman, who is given the arduous task of making Chuck Pfarrer and
Jonathan Lemkin's script into a watchable film.  Simply put, nothing
really happens, and the whole "earth in danger" framework becomes moot as
Gallagher and company simply search for a way to get back aboard the
mothership and go home.  The only real conflict in the script are the
weak attempts the writers make at creating "villains": a crew member who
accidentally causes a problem early-on, then is retroactively made out to
have evil intent later in the film; and, more prominently, AMEE, a
scouting robot who turns from gentle to killer with the flip of a switch.
 Guess which setting she ends up on when the shuttle crashes?
Hoffman, a commercial director making his feature debut, simply throws
his hands in the air and instead focuses on what he knows best: the look.
 As mentioned before, the visual effects are impressive, particularly the
completely CGI AMEE; and the ship sets and desert locations convince. 
But looks can't count for everything, and Hoffman appears to completely
bank on the attractive appearances of stars Moss and Kilmer to make the
romance between their characters work for the audience.  Needless to say,
it takes more than Ultra-Brite smiles to conceal the fact that this
undercooked subplot was sloppily grafted on to give the film more appeal
to females--who are instead likely to be insulted by the love story's
completely arbitrary nature (as will all other demographics).
As ludicrous as _Red_Planet_ is, the copy writers at the WB publicity
department actually one-up the makers of the film by pasting on a loud
disclaimer at the top of the press notes that urges the media to not
reveal the film's ending.  This blurb would lead one to believe there's
some big surprise in store, but perhaps the only shock up the film's
sleeve is how closely it hews to everyone's formulaic expectations.

Title
Review for From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)
>From Dusk till Dawn (R) ***
        A jarring hybrid of tense psychological drama and campy, B-grade 
exploitation horror, director Robert Rodriguez and screenwriter Quentin 
Tarantino's From Dusk till Dawn is bizarre, bloody... and a blast.
        Roughly the first hour of the film is a riveting 
killers-on-the-lam psychodrama, with the treacherous Gecko brothers, the 
relatively level-headed Seth and paranoid, hotheaded sex offender Richard 
(George Clooney and Tarantino), fleeing the authorities 
following Richard's jailbreak of Seth and their subsequent killing 
spree.  The two take former preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his 
daughter Kate and son Scott (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) hostage, using 
the family's RV to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.  Once in Mexico, the group 
hole up at the Titty Twister, a seedy stripper bar, where Seth and Richard 
intend to rendezvous with an associate.
        Following a steamy table dance by one Santanica Pandemonium 
(Salma Hayek), From Dusk till Dawn abruptly shifts gears into a vampire 
thriller when all the dancers and a number of the bar patrons reveal 
themselves as bloodsuckers, with Santanica being the queen.  From here on 
out, the film is a gleefully bloody homage to B-grade horror films of the past
as the Gecko brothers and their hostages, with the aid of bar patrons Frost 
(Fred Williamson, doing a fun sendup of his image as a blaxploitation 
action icon) and Sex Machine (Tom Savini) fight for their lives.
        Tarantino has gone on record that he and Rodriguez intend to 
"offend sensibilities" with this film, and based on the reaction of some 
of the audience members with whom I saw the film (first show, opening 
day, of course), they have succeeded.  During the nearly hour-long 
bloodbath of a finale, a number of people walked out of the theatre.  
Seeing the film, it's easy to see how someone could be appalled by the 
carnage; however, it's done in such a pleasingly cartoonish manner that it 
can't be taken too seriously; one can't help but have fun with it.  
Rodriguez and Tarantino are well aware that for the second half, he's 
making a "balls-out exploitation flick" (albeit one with a top-flight 
cast), and the honest lack of pretensions is refreshing.  The filmmakers 
set forth a modest goal and make no bones about it.
        Tarantino especially also appears to have offended critics' 
sensibilities with the hybrid narrative, which has been the major 
criticism of the film (one person who had walked out, who had sat in front 
of me, appeared to have been a critic of some sort, for I could see him taking
notes during the film).  However, I feel that the leap from drama to 
horror is a justifiable one, and not just on the basis of audacity and 
cleverness and shock value--it works on a thematic level.  For the first part
of the film, we see the Fuller family being put through a metaphorical hell, 
and in the second half, it takes a tangible form in the Titty Twister, 
which, ironically, also entraps the creators of that hell, in effect, giving 
the Gecko brothers their ultimate comeuppance--a taste of their own medicine. 
Also, the vampires serve as Seth and Richard's true rendezvous; they come to 
the Titty Twister to meet with an associate, and the bloodthirsty monsters are
"associates" on a deeper, spiritual level.  The Gecko brothers in a sense 
are seeing a reflection of themselves, albeit an exaggeration akin to a 
reflection in a fun house mirror.  I know I'm grasping at straws, 
trying to find a subtext in a film that by all intents and purposes is
supposed to be a shallow trifle, but for those searching for a "logical" 
reason for the abrupt genre shift, it's there.
        Rodriguez brings his usual expert craftsmanship to the numerous 
action set pieces, but his usual quick cut razzle-dazzle appears to be 
softened for this film; in fact, he borrows a thing or two from the 
handbook of Tarantino, such as the now-familiar "looking out from the 
trunk" shot.  A clever touch was to include references to their 
previous works; the Big Kahuna Burger logo from Pulp Fiction is 
emblazoned on the fast food bags Seth carries, and a crotch cannon only 
seen in Desperado is actually put to use here.  And in keeping with the 
spirit of B-grade exploitation flicks, the makeup effects are good but 
not all that convincing; in fact, they are kind of overdone, which adds 
to the air of excess and unpretentiousness.
        Clooney reveals himself to be a bonafide screen presence with his 
intense portrayal of Seth.  While level-headed as a whole, one can see 
the fire in his eyes, the dangerous killer ready to erupt should the need 
arise.  He's captivating to watch.  Tarantino is also quite effective 
here; his rather innocuous-looking exterior works for the truly psychotic 
Richard--it makes him that much more frightening when he explodes into 
violence.  Keitel, despite a labored Southern accent, lends quiet dignity 
to his role, providing a cool relaxed anchor in reality when the story 
turns toward the fantastic.  The same goes for Lewis, who, as in Cape 
Fear, perfectly captures adolescent awkwardness and insecurity and makes 
Kate's tranformation into, as Tarantino says, a "badass" entirely 
believable.  Hayek is also memorable as the sexy Santanica, but her 
appearance is much too brief; and Cheech Marin is a scene-stealer in 
three different roles, especially as a sleazy guy by the name of, ahem, 
Chet Pussy.  The only one not turning in a decent performance is newcomer Liu,
who is adequate during the first half of the film but whose second-half 
emoting is quite amateurish.  Rodriguez made a similar gamble casting young 
unknowns for his segment in Four Rooms; while it paid off incredibly well 
there, it does not here.
        One's enjoyment of From Dusk till Dawn depends entirely on one's 
expectations going in.  Those expecting a straight action/horror vehicle 
(which the ads are making it out to be) will be disappointed.  However, 
anyone wanting to see an interesting marriage of two seemingly unlinkable 
genres and a fun tongue-in-cheek gorefest that both spoofs and celebrates 
the glories of B-grade exploitation vehicles are in for an entertaining 
treat.
IN CURRENT RELEASE
(full reviews of the following can be found at Mr. Brown's Movie Site)
Bed of Roses (R)
        Storybook romance involving a workaholic banker (Mary Stuart 
Masterson) and a secret admirer (Christian Slater) who sends her 
elaborate flower arrangements.  The original title of this one was Amelia 
and the King of Plants, but I guess that was deemed too offbeat.  Slater 
proved he could pull off romance in the sweet Untamed Heart, but 
Masterson, whose romantic appeal eludes me, fizzled in the horrendous Benny 
and Joon, so the jury's out on this one.
Big Bully (PG)
        Tom Arnold is the bully of the title and Rick Moranis is his 
victim in this comedy delayed from last summer.  Never a good sign.  Also 
not a good sign is Arnold carrying a film.  Decent character actors do 
not always good leads make.
Screamers (R)
        Sci-fi thriller with Peter Weller battling killer alien 
"screamers" on a distant planet.  Sounds like nothing out of the ordinary 
in the sci-fi genre.
Jade (R) ***
        Granted, this fixture of many worst lists is very misogynistic 
and doesn't make complete sense, but I think it is a fairly entertaining 
whodunit involving a DA (David Caruso), his ex-flame (Linda Fiorentino), 
and her husband (Chazz Palminteri).  The obvious shortcomings of Joe 
Eszterhas's script are made up for by the good performances and stylish 
direction by William Friedkin, who includes a great car chase here.  A 
guilty pleasure that isn't a bad rental choice.  (Paramount Home Video)
Waterworld (PG-13) **
        Nearly $200 million down the drain, and you get this 
astonishingly mediocre action wannabe-epic about a half-man, half-fish 
anti-hero (Kevin Costner) who aids a woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and her 
adoptive daughter (Tina Majorino) search for the legendary dry land in a 
world completely covered in water.  The sets, stunts, costumes--none of 
it appears to justify the inflated budget.  Displaced director Kevin 
Reynolds proved he could make a rousing action spectacle with Robin 
Hood: Prince of Thieves, but Waterworld, being neither boring nor 
particularly exciting, just sits there, leaving no impact on the viewer.  
(MCA/Universal Home Video)
Love and Human Remains (R)
        Canadian drama that chronicles the romantic travails of roommates 
(Thomas Gibson and Ruth Marshall) while a serial killer preying on women 
stalks the streets.  (Columbia TriStar Home Video)

Title
Review for Election (1999)
Don't let outward appearances make you lump _Election_ with such shoddy
teen-targeted product as _She's_All_That_ and _10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_.
 Despite a cast largely comprised of young adults and an MTV Productions
pedigree, adults will be the ones to truly appreciate the satirical sting
of Alexander Payne's hilarious high school comedy.
The "election" in question is that of student body president at George
Washington Carver High School in Omaha, Nebraska.  Ambitious Tracy Flick
(Reese Witherspoon) seems to be a shoo-in, and rightfully so; not only is
she insanely dedicated to her civic duty at Carver, she is also unopposed
in the race.  That is, until well-liked student government advisor Jim
McAllister (Matthew Broderick) taps injured football star Paul Metzler
(Chris Klein) to put some excitement into the race and throw his hat into
the ring.  Not too long after that, Paul's younger sister Tammy (Jessica
Campbell) follows suit, and Tracy becomes even more doggedly determined to
secure what she feels is her destiny.
>From that synopsis, _Election_ sounds like typical teen fodder.  However,
I neglected to factor in some of the wonderfully warped wrinkles that Payne
throws in.  Tracy, it turns out, had a torrid affair with a now-fired
teacher who was McAllister's best friend; Tammy decides to run after an
ex-girlfriend (yes, she is a lesbian) redirects her affections toward Paul.
 It may seem as if I have divulged some plot surprises, but I haven't given
away anything that isn't covered within the first half hour (at the most).
That Payne can use outrageous twists such as those as a mere starting point
is a testament to his diabolically witty imagination.
Payne's dark comic vision is given pitch-perfect life by his actors.
Witherspoon commands the film as terrible Tracy; her incongruous blend of
wholesome all-American looks and relentless, often maniacal ambition is not
only funny, it's quite scary.  The two unknowns playing her challengers,
Klein and Campbell, similarly strike no false notes; their assigned
territory is ditziness and ballsy attitude, respectively, and they are
right on target.  What does strike a false note, though, is a domestic
subplot given to Broderick's character; while he does a convincing job as a
whole, he can't redeem a thread involving McAllister's marriage.  It fails
too hook as strongly as the high school action simply because the writing
isn't as inspired.
That misstep doesn't prevent _Election_ from being the most biting youth
comedy in recent memory.  It is the film that _10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_
claimed, but failed, to be--a dark, wildly entertaining romp that wears its
cynicism on its sleeve and sees no reason wash any of it off.

Title
Review for American Psycho (2000)
_American_Psycho_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
As the sugary sounds of Phil Collins' "Sussudio" blare in the
background, a man has rough, sweaty sex with not one, but two women.  
It's a common male fantasy brought to life, but the man is less
interested in the sex act than himself, his gaze fixed on himself in the
mirror as he flexes his muscles while thrusting away.  Now, can anyone
imagine Leonardo DiCaprio in this role?
Neither can I, especially not after seeing Christian Bale so
effortlessly pull off this scene as the title character in
_American_Psycho_, a part that at one point been offered to--and very
nearly been accepted by--the golden boy of _Titanic_.  This adaptation of
Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel of sex and serial murder in the
image-obsessed '80s would be absolutely unthinkable without Bale, who is
a stunning revelation as the social status-minded sociopath.  It is also
difficult to imagine the film being as wickedly satirical--while
genuinely disturbing--as it is had it not been made by
director/co-scripter Mary Harron.
The notorious reputation of _American_Psycho_ the novel comes from its
extremely graphic depictions of violence, a point with which Harron has
cheeky fun from frame one.  As the credits unspool on a white background,
drops of a red liquid fall across the screen, followed by the image of a
knife slicing in the air.  But then it's revealed that the knife is
cutting meat (not of the human variety), which is then placed on top of a
plate sprinkled with the previously seen red sauce, making one of those
insanely artistic dishes served at swank gourmet dining establishments.
The film's tone is further set by the formal introduction to the
_Psycho_ of the title, Wall Street hotshot Patrick Bateman (Bale). 
Patrick narrates his typical morning routine, which is not unlike most
people's--get up, exercise, shower.  The difference is how his attention
to hygiene borders on obsessive narcissism, going through a veritable
laundry list of products in the shower and even more than that for a
post-shower facial treatment.  It's overkill by most people's standards,
but Patrick's unironic, matter-of-fact narration makes it clear that it
couldn't be a more natural part of taking care of himself.  In fact, the
names of the products Patrick uses is the most specific information given
about him; no clear background is ever established--but then perhaps all
is said in one revealing comment in this opening voiceover: "There is no
real me."
Like Patrick's waking rituals, Bale's vocal performance seems a bit
much, at least at the beginning.  The British actor adopts not just than
an American accent for this role, but also the perfectly enunciated and
overwrought cadences of a TV announcer.  But as the film goes on, his
speech proves to be in perfect alignment with the film as a whole.  This
is not necessarily because _American_Psycho_ grows more outrageous--and,
it could be easily said, over the top--as it progresses (and it does),
but because it is a double-edged reflection of the film's deeper concerns
about identity and conformity.  On one hand, to make oneself sound more
bombastically important is an attempt to stand out from the crowd in the
"Me" decade; on another, in sounding so self-important, Patrick actually
makes himself that much more like his preppy peers, in essence defeating
the whole purpose.
There is one characteristic of Patrick Bateman that distinguishes him
from the rest of his power suit-sporting kind, and that's his pesky habit
of slicing and dicing people.  Unlike Ellis, whose novel lingered on
every last grisly detail, Harron doesn't show more than she has to; she
leaves most of the action to the imagination, opting for shots of blood
splattering on Patrick instead of those of blades tearing into flesh. 
The technique serves its purpose; it makes the killings more disturbing
while not being so harsh as to steal the focus away from real point,
which is satire.
The surface satire in the script by Harron and Guinevere Turner (who
also appears in a small role) is fairly facile; much of the humor derives
from Patrick and his peers' fascination with status symbols.  But Harron
and Turner go about it in an efficient, creative, and very funny way; the
absurdity of their pursuits is perfectly and inventively captured by a
scene where Patrick and co-workers engage try to outdo each other's slick
business cards.  (The cards themselves are indicative of Harron's fine
attention to detail; another witty touch I enjoyed are the overdone theme
menus for the fancy restaurants.)
Such broad strokes threaten to make _American_Psycho_ cartoony, but
Harron achieves compensation in reality through her actors.  Providing
effectively earnest counterbalance are Willem Dafoe as a policeman
investigating the disappearance of one of Patrick's victims, and a trio
of actresses playing the film's comparatively more grounded female
characters: Cara Seymour as a prostitute whom Patrick employs, Reese
Witherspoon as Patrick's high-maintenance fiancée, and the
ever-impressive Chloë Sevigny as Patrick's sweet and devoted secretary.
There's no denying, however, that the film belongs to Bale, who handles
the tricky task of playing a character as an exaggeration yet not a
caricature.  Patrick's hyped-up eccentricities--such as his pre-murder
pontifications on the pop songs he uses as background music--are indeed
comical, and Bale milks them for every sick laugh they're worth (which is
plenty).  Yet there's never anything inherently funny about the character
himself; he's a psychotic murderer, and Bale (and Harron) doesn't
sugarcoat Patrick's murderous rages.  In fact, Bale goes the extra mile
and infuses him with an almost sad desperation--for what, exactly, is
left for the audience to decide.  His repellent actions could easily be
just a sick way to grab more attention for himself (he doesn't do too
discreet a job of hiding his guilt during the cop's interrogations); they
could be read as a dementedly cathartic release for his frustrations;
they could be an interchangeable nobody's extreme attempt to become a
unique somebody.  Whatever way, Bale's achievement is in  suggesting far
more dimensions than his character would ever admit to having.
As Patrick's mind increasingly unravels, so does the film to an extent;
the final act lacks some of the urgency and bite of the first two thirds.
 What it does maintain, and even enhance, is the atmosphere of dread that
always lingered beneath the surface.  Given how unsettling the film's
ultimate effect is, it almost seems inappropriate to call
_American_Psycho_ "enjoyable," but most of this wild and perverse trip
can easily be classified as being so.

Title
Review for Central do Brasil (1998)
_Central_Station_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
By all outward appearances, this Brazilian drama is a standard road
movie--and to a certain extent, it is.  Central Station in Rio is what
brings together the film's unlikely traveling duo: Dora (Fernanda
Montenegro), former schoolteacher, now letter-writer; and Josue (Vinicius
de Olveira), an orphaned 10-year-old boy, whose mother was one of the
Dora's customers before her untimely death.  The two set off on a rough
journey across the country to find Josue's long-lost father.
_Central_Station_'s travellers follow the beaten cinematic path, but the
film is made unusually compelling by the lead characters.  This is because
they are so recognizably human; neither Dora nor Josue are the most likable
of characters.  Dora is, at times, unbearably bitter; Josue is often
unnecessarily cruel to his de facto guardian, often ridiculing her haggard
appearance.  What keeps the audience involved in the plight of this prickly
pair are the actors.  de Olveira, a shoeshine boy who was discovered by
director Walter Salles after the boy asked him for change, is a remarkable
find, exuding the right balance of toughness and vulnerability.  The same
can be said, but to a greater degree, about Montenegro (who has been named
Best Actress of the year by both the National Board of Review and the Los
Angeles Film Critics Association); she rightfully sees Dora's bitter anger
as less a weariness with the world than with herself, a desperate,
self-destructive mechanism to keep the world even more distant than it
already is.  The nuances of Montenegro's work--and the film--are too subtle
to notice along the way, but by the film's poignant yet understated
conclusion, they are powerfully felt.

Title
Review for Bamboozled (2000)
With the NAACP once again criticizing the four major American broadcast
television networks for the lack of racial diversity--and a limited
variety roles for African-Americans--in the new television season, the
time is ripe for a film like _Bamboozled_, which satirizes the TV
industry's arguably racist practices.  And who better than Spike Lee to
direct such a confrontational film, right?  But it's one thing for a film
to wear an agenda on its sleeve, and quite another to do what Lee does
here--bludgeon the viewers with his message, preaching to them rather
than making them think while entertaining them.
For a little while, though, Lee achieves that balance.  A good example
is an early scene where Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans), the sole black
writer for the fictional Continental Network System, is told by the
network's white, ebonics-spouting programming head Dunwitty (Michael
Rapaport) that he's "blacker" than he is.  In addition to wringing
pointed, biting laughs, this scene also concisely pints up a real issue:
the Harvard-educated Pierre wants to create respectable series
spotlighting the oft-ignored African-American middle class (think
_The_Cosby_Show_) while Dunwitty wants to see the slang- and slapstick-
heavy sitcoms that are the predominant television showcase for blacks
(think _Homeboys_in_Outer_Space_).
So, in an act of spite, Pierre gives Dunwitty exactly what he wants--to
the nth degree: _Mantan:_The_New_Millennium_Minstrel_Show_, featuring
street performers Manray (Savion Glover) and Womack (Tommy Davidson) in a
throwback to the offensive comedy/variety stereotypes of yesteryear. 
Watermelon patch dwellers "Mantan" and "Sleep 'N Eat" wear burnt cork
blackface and get into all sorts of misadventures--always as a direct
result of their ignorance and laziness.  But every once and a while,
Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat break out into spirited song and dance numbers
while backed up by their house band, the Alabama Porch Monkeys; and their
dance troupe, the Pickaninnys.
The parallel Lee draws between TV (and entertainment in general) of
today and yesteryear is clear--blackface aside, the common portrayal of
African-Americans on the tube is disconcertingly similar, if not nearly
identical.  As the film firmly establishes this provocative point through
that plot development, it would only follow that _Bamboozled_ would then
build into even more incendiary satire.  What ignites instead, however,
is Lee's need to vent about a variety of other issues.
Much like how _Mantan_ slips out of control as it becomes an unexpected
runaway success, _Bamboozled_ soon flies off the reins.  Now a media
sensation, Manray indulges in the high life and believes his own hype;
similarly, Pierre, who could already be pegged as a sellout with his
ridiculously "refined" accent and diction, basks in the attention and
accolades for a creation that he designed to die on the vine.  Lest one
think one of the film's messages is to "keep it real," the Mau Maus, an
afrocentric rap group headed by the brother (Mos Def) of Pierre's
assistant Sloan (an impressive Jada Pinkett-Smith), is similarly raked
over the coals and then some; for all their talk of revolution and
staying true to their roots (for example, Sloan's brother changed his
name from Julian to Big Black Africa), they spend most of their time
guzzling forties and smoking weed.
Despite the muddiness caused by all the peripheral concerns, Lee never
makes one forget that _Bamboozled_ is, foremost, an attack on racial
misrepresentation in entertainment.  It's impossible to sight of that,
given how increasingly heavy handed his technique gets as the film wears
on, crossing the line between satire and sermon; sly, stinging wit makes
way for earnest and overblown preachiness--as exemplified by a lengthy
montage of racist images in entertainment through the years that comes
late in the film.
Amplifying the sense of bombast is a violent, melodramatic
wrap-up--which, in itself, reinforces another stereotype: that
African-American-themed films end with some type of bloodshed.  Is this
another point on Lee's list or an unfortunate coincidence?  With the
bungle that is _Bamboozled_, anyone's guess is as good as mine.

Title
Review for Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997)
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (R) *** (out of ****)
After spending three years on the bestseller list, John Berendt's
Midnight and the Garden of Good and Evil has been brought to the screen by
Clint Eastwood in a film that is not likely to stay too long at the top of
the box office charts--provided it even gets there at all.  While Midnight
is, in the end, an intriguing and handsome production, watching this very
long, leisurely paced film is like reading a book--not necessarily a bad
thing, but not exactly what one is in the mood for when watching a film.
At its core, the fact-based Midnight is a courtroom drama, documenting the
1981 trial of Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey), a wealthy Savannah antiques
dealer charged with the murder of Billy Hanson (Jude Law), one of the help
at Jim's estate and his sometime lover.  Writing a book on this sensational
case--and investigating the truth behind the fateful night--is John Kelso
(John Cusack, playing a fictional stand-in for Berendt), a New York writer
originally sent down to Savannah to write a Town and Country magazine
article on Jim's swanky annual Christmas party.
The plot, however, appears to be of little concern to Eastwood and
screenwriter John Lee Hancock, who, in trying to capture the feel of
Berendt's book, are more interested in the colorful array of characters
John encounters through his research and investigation.  Among those he
gets involved with are Jim's smooth talking attorney, Sonny Seiler (Jack
Thompson); Joe Odom (Paul Hipp), an ex-lawyer who dreams of opening a piano
bar; Mandy Nichols (Alison Eastwood, Clint's daughter), a free-spirited
flower shop worker in whom John develops a romantic interest; Minerva (Irma
P. Hall), a voodoo priestess who aids Jim's case; and, most notably, The
Lady Chablis (played by him/herself), a flamboyant transvestite who lived
with one of Billy's lovers.  Yet while these are all interesting people who
together make up a varied cross section of the Savannah population, most
have little more than a tangential connection to the main proceedings,
serving to further bloat the running time, which, as it stands, clocks in
at over two and a half hours.  The presence of a large, novelesque canvas
of characters is commendable, but Hancock cannot quite make it work
because, interesting as they are, they are not given much to do that is of
equal interest; the background players' main duty is to react to Jim's
crime and subsequent trial.  An exception to this would be Minerva, but
even this voodoo angle, which comes to play a major role, is not
incorporated into the story in the smoothest of manners, popping up out of
nowhere midway (to lend the film its title) only to resurface at center
stage in the final act.
Eastwood-directed films are known for their slow pace, and Midnight is no
exception.  Any slowly-paced film runs the risk of losing its audience's
attention, but Midnight does not, thanks to an engrossing plot hook and the
polished work by cinematographer Jack N. Green, production designer Henry
Bumstead, and the acting ensemble, which is strong across the board.
Spacey, not surprisingly, does a finely modulated job, managing to make Jim
sympathetic without diluting any of his unsavory nature; he just may have
nailed his second Oscar nod for the year (the first would be for his superb
supporting work in L.A. Confidential).  But as good as he and Cusack are,
the movie is stolen from right under them and all else involved in the
picture by The Lady Chablis.  True, he/she is playing him/herself, but
he/she does it with such brash, go-for-broke insouciance that everything
take a backseat to him/her whenever he/she is onscreen.  A Supporting Actor
nod should be in his/her future, but given the notoriously conservative
tastes of the notoriously conservative Academy, that can be safely ruled out.
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil did keep me engaged all through
its lengthy running time but perhaps not in the way it should have.  As a
film, Midnight is a good _read_, paced slowly to accommodate thorough
exploration and digestion of the little details that are interesting if not
particularly important.  However, a bit more tightening and focus would
have made the thoughtful and literate Midnight a better _watch_.

Title
Review for Blair Witch Project, The (1999)
_The_Blair_Witch_Project_ (R) *** (out of ****)
Spanning two centuries and encompassing (among other things) mysterious
disappearances, gruesome acts of violence, a rare book, chilling film
footage, and a legendary witch, the sprawling mythology that filmmakers
Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez, Greg Hale, Rob Cowie, and Mike Monello
have crafted around _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ is massive and murky enough
to make _The_X-Files_ creator Chris Carter proud.  It's almost a shame
that the film that inspired it all barely scratches the surface of this
elaborately constructed piece of modern folklore.
Since unexpectedly jolting audiences at this year's Sundance Film
Festival, _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ has been riding a wave of hype and
high expectations leading to its July theatrical release.  But the fact
that _Blair_Witch_ is an ultra-low-budget indie doesn't make it any more
immune to the inevitable feeling of disappointment that accompanies any
studio-manufactured object of ballyhoo.  Don't get me wrong; the
well-made product is a testament to the triumph of imagination and
creativity over financial limitations.  But it functions more effectively
as part of a larger multimedia entertainment experience than as a
stand-alone film.
The premise is simple enough that it is summed up in one tidy title card
at the beginning of the picture: "In October of 1994, three student
filmmakers diappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while
shooting a documentary.  A year later their footage was found."  That
faux vérité footage is what makes up _The_Blair_Witch_Project_,
chronicling from the first person director Heather Donahue, sound guy
Michael Williams, and cameraman Joshua Leonard's ill-fated filmic
investigation into a legendary witch that haunts Burkittsville, formerly
known as Blair.  The project quickly turns from fun--such as interviewing
sometimes wacky locals about the legend--to a harrowing struggle for
survival as they become lost in the forest, where a mysterious force
stalks the trio.
Of course, we all know where this is going, thanks to that opening
blurb.  So it's up to writer-directors Myrick and Sanchez to come up with
a compelling journey, and they largely succeed.  The perpetually shaky
camerawork is annoying at times, but it contributes to the film's
greatest virtue--its air of authenticity.  Adding to that is the use of
unknown actors convincingly playing humanly imperfect characters named
after themselves.  The audience believes they are witnessing real people
experiencing real pain, real frustration, and, ultimately, real fear.
That sense of fear extends to the audience, but not quite as strongly as
has been made out to be.  There are two scenes in particular that struck
me as particularly frightening, but that was about it, and they come
fairly late in the game.  In fact, _Blair_Witch_ in just in the midst of
developing a head of steam when it ends.  While the film concludes on an
appropriately eerie and ambiguous note, its fairly abrupt nature is far
from satisfying.
For greater satisfaction, one must see the Sci-Fi Channel's forthcoming
tie-in special on the _Blair_Witch_ legend or visit the website, which
offers a wealth of information on the _Blair_Witch_ mythology, from the
legend's origins to events that take place after those depicted in the
film--not to mention the "story" behind the piecing together of the "lost
footage" into the 87-minute film.  A taste of this information is
provided in the press notes, which I did not read until after the film. 
Reading them has indeed made the experience and understanding of the film
a bit richer, but that doesn't change what is printed on the celluloid. 
As smartly conceived and executed as it is, _Blair_Witch_ the film is
basically a fairly familiar tale of three people who must learn to live
together and fend for themselves when lost in the forest.
Which is basically to say that _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ isn't quite as
special as it has been made out to be; it won't be the breakout hit
Artisan Entertainment is hoping for, just a sizable arthouse success. 
This is not to say that the film is not worth a look; it is a diverting
work of great ingenuity and invention.  It's just that to appreciate the
full breadth of the five filmmakers' vision, one must bone up on the
supplemental materials.  _Blair_Witch_ the film is ultimately as much of
a teaser for its website as is vice versa.  (opens July 16)

Title
Review for Forever Fever (1998)
_That's_the_Way_I_Like_It_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
This '70s-set import from Singapore may be named after the song by K.C.
and the Sunshine Band, but that dominates the film is that of the Bee
Gees--namely, their contributions to the _Saturday_Night_Fever_
soundtrack.  In fact, that emblematic film of the disco era dominates
this film about Hock (Adrian Pang), a young man who ends up stumbling
into a theatre playing _Forever_Fever_ (the film's thinly veiled stand-in
for the real thing) and redirects his adoration for Bruce Lee toward John
Travolta and the disco scene.  As Hock enters a dance contest with his
longtime friend Mei (Pam Oei), every plot development can be seen a mile
away; the contest's outcome is never in doubt.  
But when the execution is as spirited as it is here, it doesn't matter. 
What is especially delightful is how writer-director Glen Goei in paying
tribute to the culture of the glitter ball era, he doesn't downplay the
kitschiness of it all; in fact, Goei embraces it.  The Tony Manero
stand-in (Dominic Pace) that comes off the screen to give Hock advice
neither looks nor sounds anything like Travolta, and a climactic Bruce
Lee-style martial arts sequence is over-the-top ridiculous, but it it all
feels pitch-perfect in this funny and immensely charming trifle.

Title
Review for Sugar Town (1999)
        For her follow-up to her underseen 1996 effort _Grace_of_My_Heart_,  
director Allison Anders returns to the musical milieu explored in that
film, albeit in a different time and place.  _Sugar_Town_, written and
directed in tandem by Anders and Kurt Voss, is an exploration of the
contemporary Los Angeles music scene by way of an Altman-esque tableau of
interlocking characters and storylines.  The central thread revolves
around a comeback album being pitched by a once-big '80s rock band.  As
is the case with ensemble films such as this, each individual member has
its own personal drama to deal with on his own.  Clive (John Taylor) must
deal with the sudden appearance of illegitimate son Nerve (Vincent
Berry), much to the chagrin of his wife, Eva (Rosanna Arquette), an
actress.  Deluded, stuck-in-the-glam era Nick's (Michael Des Barres)
policy of only sleeping with 20somethings (or younger) is tested when a
wealthy 40something's (Beverly D'Angelo) potential financial backing
rides on a roll in the hay.  The third member, Jonesy (Martin Kemp),
doesn't have much of a presence in the film, but that slack is picked up
by other loosely connected characters.  Guitarist Carl's (John Doe)
fidelity to his very pregnant wife (Lucinda Jenney) is tested by an
attraction to the fetching singer Rocio (Lumi Cavazos).  Eva's production
designer friend, Daisy (Ally Sheedy), desperately looks for true love as
her new housekeeper, conniving singer Gwen (Jade Gordon), sets her sights
on the band's producer Burt (Larry Klein) in her ongoing scheme to make
it big.
        Ensemble pieces are almost always uneven, with some storylines more
engaging than others.  _Sugar_Town_ is no exception.  The Carl thread,
which also encompasses his ne'er-do-well brother's (Richmond Arquette)
attraction to his wife, isn't quite as much fun as, say, the
Clive/Nerve/Eva storyline.  But the lesser storylines are redeemed by the
uniformly fine performances and the occasional bit of witty
dialogue--making the film a fun, if lightweight, romp.
        The same cannot be said of another film about a rock-'n-roll comeback,
the terrible so-called comedy _The_Suburbans_.  The title is the name of
a (fictional) one hit wonder '80s rock quartet, which is revived under
the guidance of a young record exec named Cate (Jennifer Love Hewitt, in
one of her better performances).  The reluctant revival creates drama in
each individual member's life.  Rory (Tony Guma) and Gil (Will Ferrell)
would rather concentrate on other things; the presence of Cate adds
strain to Danny's (Donal Lardner Ward) relationship with his longtime
girlfriend Grace (Amy Brenneman), who wants a lasting commitment. 
However, the womanizing Mitch (Craig Bierko) relishes the renewed time in
the spotlight.
        Unlike _Sugar_Town_, where the lesser plot threads are evened out by
more interesting ones, the focus in _The_Suburbans_ lies squarely on the
film's least interesting character: Danny--hardly surprising, since Ward
is also the director.  The character with the second-most screen time is
equally dull Rory--again, no surprise, since Guma co-wrote the script
with Ward.  Bierko and Ferrell give more colorful performances, but they
are shoved into the background.  Better than those two, however, is
Brenneman, who is a refreshing breeze of believability amid the inanity;
and the killer duo of Jerry and Ben Stiller, who deliver the film's only
funny moments as Cate's father-son superiors at the record company.  That
the Stillers only have (at most) five minutes of total screen time shows
how tedious and, worst of all, painfully laugh-free the rest of the
film's scant running time is.  (_The_Suburbans_ opens October 29)

Title
Review for Mouse Hunt (1997)
MOUSE HUNT (DreamWorks) 
Starring: Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, Maury Chaykin, and Christopher Walken. 
Screenplay: Adam Rifkin. 
Producers: Alan Riche, Tony Ludwig, and Bruce Cohen. 
Director: Gore Verbinski. 
MPAA Rating: PG (slapstick violence, profanity, sexual innuendo) 
Running Time: 97 minutes.
Reviewed by Michael Dequina.
Rating: ** 1/2 out of **** (fair)
        With its three inaugural releases, megabucks studio DreamWorks SKG has
just about covered all the bases: middle-of-the-road action (THE
PEACEMAKER); highminded "Oscar bait" (AMISTAD), and now lowbrow comedy with
MOUSE HUNT, a slapstick comedy that will please the tykes but will leave
the rest of the family less than satisfied.
        The basic plot setup (a pair of down-on-their-luck brothers inherit a
rundown--and, as it turns out, valuable--house from their string
manufacturer father) is rendered irrelevant once the "star" of the movie
enters the picture: a tiny little mouse (a charmer by the name of "Jenny
the Mouse"), who immediately ruins the house renovation plans of the two
siblings, Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (Lee Evans) Smuntz.  What ensues is
one long, frenzied pursuit in which the two bumbling brothers make attempt
after attempt to find and kill the mouse, who outsmarts them every time.
        MOUSE HUNT is little more than HOME ALONE with a mouse in the lead, which
should give you a clear idea about the bulk of the comedy in this film:
broad physical schtick.  Granted, this type of humor goes a long way with
the film's target audience--children--and a handful of the gags did make me
smile, but after a while I (and, I suspect, most adults in the audience)
grew tired of the pratfalls.  After all, a man getting hit in the head by a
blunt object can only be so "hilarious" after the first two or three times
it is done.
        What keeps the incessant slapstick from becoming completely monotonous are
the engaging performances.  Even though they are set up as the villains of
the piece, Lane and Evans, who develop a nice brotherly rapport, remain
likable and sympathetic; at certain points I found myself simultaneously
rooting for them _and_ the mouse.  And it is through the acting that the
film is able to maintain a slightly twisted edge.  Lane delivers his acid
one-liners with malicious glee, and an effectively creepy Christopher
Walken comes close to walking away with the movie as overzealous and
slightly psycho exterminator Caesar.
        MOUSE HUNT, like its destructive but well-meaning protagonist, is
harmless, a fairly safe bet to keep the little ones entertained for 97
minutes.  But anyone looking for a film that truly is fun for the whole
family is better off checking out the opulent ANASTASIA or, better yet,
Disney's modern classic THE LITTLE MERMAID, which is enjoying yet another
rerelease this week.

Title
Review for Stir of Echoes (1999)
"If you liked _The_Sixth_Sense_, then you'll love _Stir_of_Echoes_." 
I'm actually a bit surprised that Artisan Entertainment isn't going that
cornball route with their film's publicity, for David Koepp's adaptation
of the Richard Matheson novel shares a remarkable amount in common with
the surprise box office phenomenon of the summer.  Unfortunately, one of
those common traits is falling short of complete success.
For all their similarities, _Stir_of_Echoes_ is a completely different
animal from M. Night Shyamalan's film, especially in terms of style. 
Koepp approaches his material in a much more conventional fashion than
Shyamalan, a fact that can best be summed up by a simple comparison.  In
_The_Sixth_Sense_, the now-famous "I see dead people" is spoken roughly
an hour into the film.  In _Stir_of_Echoes_, the psychically gifted
child, Jake Witzky (Zachary David Cope), asks "Does it hurt to be dead?"
to an invisible (but not to him) apparition at about the five-minute
mark.
This sixth sense also comes to be possessed by Jake's father Tom (Kevin
Bacon) after he is put under hypnosis by his sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana
Douglas).  What is meant as a harmless lark during a party turns natural
skeptic Tom into a true believer, for he soon has haunting visions of a
mysterious stranger lurking about his house--apparently the same
heretofore invisible one with whom his son has been regularly conversing.
The reasons for the ghostly stranger's visits recall similar points in
_The_Sixth_Sense_, and that's about where the similarities end.  There is
a more menacing edge here that was fairly absent in that film.  A point
that comes into play in _Stir_of_Echoes is how ghosts get angry when not
paid attention to, resulting in some effective scare scenes where Tom and
his family are actually threatened.  The darker shades are reinforced by
Koepp, who employs an effectively flashy visual style that lends an
eeriness to even the more sedate sequences, such as the clever staging of
Tom's hypnosis experience.
The absorbing style and urgent pace of _Stir_of_Echoes_ kept me
interested as it progressed, as opposed to the glacial crawl of
_The_Sixth_Sense_.  In the end, though, my reaction to _Echoes_ was the
inverse of mine to _Sense_: where the latter's much-talked-about ending
nearly redeemed the entire slow-going film for me, the dismayingly
conventional conclusion to _Echoes_ left me soured on the picture.  It's
a contrived standoff/hostage setup that belongs in much lesser film, and
needless to say it completely kills the otherworldly atmosphere that
Koepp had meticulously created.  Never have I seen reality come crashing
down in a film in a more literal--and disappointing--way.
For all its fantastic elements, Rupert Wainwright's supernatural
thriller _Stigmata_ will hold a grounding in reality for a lot of viewers
due to its religious themes.  Any film that deals with religious issues
inevitably comes under fire (witness the storm surrounding Kevin Smith's
forthcoming _Dogma_), and _Stigmata_, which touches upon a fictional
conspiracy within the Vatican, has already been denounced by the Catholic
League.  However, I think the film provides something
valuable--surprisingly serious and intelligent food for thought about
faith and supernatural phenomena.
While the film deals with serious themes, _Stigmata_ is foremost a
thriller, and Wainwright delivers the requisite shocks in telling the
story of Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), an unreligious young
Pittsburgh woman who becomes violently afflicted with the wounds of
Christ on the cross, or stigmata.  Wainwright--perhaps not an obvious
choice for a thriller, given that his last credit was for directing
_Blank_Check_, a Disney vehicle for former _Family_Ties_ moppet Brian
Bonsall--stages these bloody scenes in quick-cut MTV style (not
surprising, since he's also a veteran of music videos), and the usually
annoying effect of such a style works quite well in this context,
succeeding in jolting the audience.
Naturally, a priest enters the scene--Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel
Byrne), a onetime scientist who now serves as an investigator for the
Vatican.  In dealing with Frankie, Father Andrew must come to terms with
his own doubts about his faith.  Sounds very much like _The_Exorcist_,
and much of _Stigmata_, including some of the special effects scenes,
recall that classic.  Also like that film, _Stigmata_'s effects are
lavish without feeling particularly exploitative.  However derivative
some individual aspects are, the fresh ideas of Wainwright and writers
Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage, along with the believable performances of
the cast, give _Stigmata_ its own identity.
Not all of the ideas work, however.  Wainwright's visual style careens
into overkill during the quieter scenes; there are one too many shots of
drops of blood falling into water, not to mention some unnecessarily
emblematic closeups of menial things, such as coffee being poured into a
cup.  He also overuses a device that repeats dialogue spoken in a scene
as a voiceover on the following scene.  The virtual absence of any police
hasn't stopped Lazarus and Ramage from indulging in the reliable cop
cliché where an officer is taken off the case by a superior (in this
instance, Father Andrew by Cardinal Daniel Houseman, played by Jonathan
Pryce).
Even so, _Stigmata_ leaves the audience with more to chew on afterward
that any of the other thrillers currently crowding theatres--including
_The_Sixth_Sense_.  While that film makes one think about things you've
seen during the course of its progression, _Stigmata_ makes one reflect
upon one's personal beliefs and values--and therein lies all the
difference.

Title
Review for Caligula (1980)
Since its initial release in 1979, no film quite like _Caligula_ has
ever been made--and with good reason; it is widely known to be one of the
worst films ever made, and anyone who's seen it would be hard-pressed to
argue with that assessment.  But as with a lot of bad would-be art, this
cinematic oddity holds a truly bizarre fascination, especially in this
fully restored, 20th anniversary edition, which is slowly making its way
around to big screens around the country.
On the big screen is the only way one can, ahem, "appreciate" this
gaudy, flat-out bizarre exercise in cinematic fragmentation.  Whatever
chance this film had of turning out well was done in by the participants'
conflicting intentions, which can be broken down into three perspectives.
 From one, there are original screenwriter (the adapter remains
uncredited) Gore Vidal and the Serious British Actors (including no less
than Sir John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole), who obviously believed they
were making a serious exposé of the decadence of the Roman empire, namely
the reign of the megalomaniacal title character (Malcolm McDowell).  Then
there's original director Tinto Brass, whose insistence on filling every
last shot of film with some artfully-lit nudity comes straight from the
school of mainstream exploitation cinema.  Last--and certainly not
least--comes (in _every_ sense of the word) producer and _Penthouse_
publisher Bob Guccione, who wrested control of the film from Brass and
then shot and edited in some balls-out (literally) hardcore pornography.
The finished product, as one can glean, is one giant mess.  Any given
scene can shift from McDowell's overacting to nonchalant glimpses of full
frontal men and women to explicit closeups of sexual penetration.  It
makes for a jarring watch--but certainly never a boring one.  In fact,
it's this identity crisis that lends the film its biggest virtue:
unintentional comedy.  As disgusting as it is for most audience, how can
one _not_ laugh at the film's centerpiece cum shot, which has to be the
first and only in screen history that has been scored to a full-blown
orchestral crescendo and climax?
These "additional scenes directed and photographed" by Guccione and
Giancarlo Lui come out of nowhere and have only tangential connection to
the story--no surprise since the main actors were called on to do just
that, and only anonymous extras get down and dirty.  For example, the
film's famous girl-on-girl scene is sloppily intercut with a rather tame
threesome between Caligula, his wife Caesonia (Helen Mirren, whose role
consists of standing around in various states of undress, spouting very
little dialogue), and beloved sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy).  The
tiny plot "thread" that connects them is that the two women ("played" by
_Penthouse_ pets Anneka DiLorenzo and Lori Wagner) spy on the three from
a secret room, get hot, and get it on; eventually, their activities win
more screen time than those of the three bonafide characters.  I must
admit that the lesbian encounter is the only hardcore interlude that can
be considered remotely erotic, but that doesn't make its inclusion any
more ludicrous, especially in light of the fact that the secret room,
which is shown in an earlier scene as being dark and empty, features a
big, fully made bed and is lit with a seductive red light.
But it's not as if there's a whole lot of plot to begin with, anyway. 
The apparent point of the film is to show that Caligula was--to put it
bluntly--one sick motherfucker.  He was hungry for power; he indulged in
sexual excess; he exacted violent action upon his enemies.  It's a point
that comes clear within a half hour at most.  But _Caligula_ drives home
that point over and over again until, after two-and-a-half-hours,
Caligula's reign meets a suitably bloody end.  Before that point,
however, we see Caligula's sadism in graphic detail; in one especially
notorious scene, Caligula's guards cut off a man's penis--in tight
closeup--then feed it to dogs.  We also see everything--and I mean
everything--that goes down (literally) at the many orgies Caligula
stages.  And then there's Caligula himself.  To McDowell's credit, he
threw all inhibitions out the window and spared no risk in taking this
role.  But then there's the matter of the risks he's made to take: he
prances around in a skimpy toga; he wildly dances in the rain completely
nude; he vomits in slow-motion; he rapes the bride at a wedding
reception, then fists the groom; he licks a dead female body up and down;
he even gets to sleep with a horse.  That McDowell performs these tasks
with such deranged gusto actually helps--what would otherwise be
stomach-turning and offensive is rendered ridiculously laughable.
Which is what _Caligula_ is behind all the violence, sex, and various
bodily fluids: an idea so preposterously bad as to be hilarious
(big-budget pornographic historical epic?).  The rerelease poster boasts,
"Just as shocking twenty years later."  Indeed it is, but not in the way
intended.  Moreso than, say, the sight of a group of guys ejaculating
into a bowl (yes, that's in there), what is truly shocking is that
_Caligula_ ever got made.

Title
Review for Soul Survivors (2001)
_Soul_Survivors_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
        With its ripped-from-the-pages-of-_YM_ cast (Eliza Dushku, Wes Bentley,
Casey Affleck, and newcomer Melissa Sagemiller), at first glance
_Soul_Survivors_ looks just like the lot of teen-targeted horror films that have
infected screens the past five years.  However, those going in expecting the
usual slice-'n-dice will instead get something quite different.  But "different"
doesn't exactly mean "good," and this surprisingly sedate supernatural story
proves that point quite well.
        The focal foursome are introduced with a backstory knotty enough to fill
a season of _Dawson's_Creek_.  Sean and Cassie (Affleck and Sagemiller, who
perhaps not coincidentally has a Gwyneth-ish vibe about her) are in love, but
Cassie's ex Matt (Bentley), who also happens to be Sean's best friend, still
carries a torch.  Meanwhile, Cassie's freespirited best friend Annabel (Dushku),
who is apparently cozy with Matt, remains unaware--or at least pretends to
be--of his lingering romantic feelings for her buddy.  Got that?
        Actually, it doesn't matter, for one fateful night where Sean discovers
Cassie and Matt in a clinch becomes more dramatic when the quartet are involved
in an auto wreck.  The accident claims one of them, and while the other two
survivors appear to have escaped unscathed both mentally and physically, Cassie
is plagued by disturbing visions.  What is real?  What isn't?  Will you care?
        Not likely.  Between the accident scene and its conclusion,
_Soul_Survivors_ is an exercise in spinning wheels, a muddle of images, ideas,
and characters (such as Angela Featherstone's androgynous lesbian role) that
don't go anywhere, let alone make any sense.  Writer-director Steve Carpenter
was obviously going for a dream-like atmosphere, but even when taking such a
surreal bent, events should follow some sort of internal logic.  They don't
here; one scene has Cassie having a major row with a friend, and the next scene
has the friend cheering her on at a swim meet.  Cassie's visions are supposed to
instill horror, but would-be shocks such as a rather violent nosebleed and a
shot of blood going down a bath drain aren't exactly the stuff that nightmares
are made of.
        Artisan's much-publicized decision to recut the film from an R to a
PG-13 may have indeed diluted Carpenter's original vision, but when the
"meaning" behind _Soul_Survivors_ becomes clear, issues of explicitness become
moot.  That Carpenter didn't have the heart to come up with one halfway creepy
scene, even in PG-13 form, speaks of his true intent, which reveals itself to be
far more gooey and touchy-feely than one would have expected--and, hence, a lot
less fun.

Title
Review for 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)
_10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
It would be easy to do take the cutesy and oh-so-precious route and make
this review a list of "10 Things I Hate About This Movie," but the truth is
I didn't exactly hate this film.  At its center, in fact, is a major thing
to like: newcomer Julia Stiles, who effectively plays the improbably named
Katarina Stratford, the "shrew" who comes to be "tamed" in this teen
modernization of William Shakespeare's _The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_.  Kat is
mercilessly bitter with the world, and she's not afraid to show it--to her
fellow students, her younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), and even her
doctor father (Larry Miller).  Even so, Stiles subtly instills enough
underlying vulnerability to make her relatable to the audience.
Also relatable are Kat's reasons for lashing out; the characters that
surround her are so vacuous, it's completely understandable why she
wouldn't want to associate with them.  These people include, in addition to
Bianca, her shallow best friend Chastity (Gabrielle Union); Bianca's two
suitors, egotistical model/actor Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) and dull nice
guy Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); Cameron's geeky friend Michael
Eckman (David Krumholtz); and, to a certain extent, the guy who eventually
thaws our ice princess, mysterious loner Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger, who
actually has some nice chemistry with Stiles).  They're all nice, selfish
targets for the full concentration of Kat's venom.  The problem is, while
director Gil Junger and writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith often
let Kat bare her fangs, she is given little to no opportunity to actually
bite.  Though this is a reworking of _The_Taming_of_the_Shrew_, the scale
is too heavily tilted toward the "taming" and not the "shrew."  Anyone
looking for the wickedness promised by the film's title or its taglines
("How do I loathe thee?  Let me count the ways" and "Romeo, oh Romeo, get
out of my face") will instead find a light dose of bile and a strong one of
the warm fuzzies.  (opens March 31)

Title
Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
_Austin_Powers:_The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
_Austin_Powers_ is one pop culture phenomenon that has flown clear over
my head.  The shagadelic spy's first screen outing, 1997's
_International_Man_of_Mystery_--whose box office grosses topped out at
just north of $50 million, yet became a sensation on video--was
definitely a likable, high-energy affair, but for me, that wasn't enough
to redeem a script whose hit-and-miss stabs at humor were more amusingly
silly than genuinely hilarious.  The bigger, though not necessarily
better, sequel, _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_, doesn't pretend to be anything
more than it is--more of the same.  Whether or not that's a good thing,
however, depends on who you are: fans of the original are indeed likely
to find this installment to be groovy (as did the rowdy fans at my
screening), but for me, it was another scattershot adventure with a few
good chuckles but not quite as funny as it believes it is--or should be.
One of the key problems I had with the original film was that about
three-quarters of the way through, the schtick of Austin Powers (Mike
Myers) was exhausted.  He's a defrosted British secret agent still stuck
in the swinging '60s who is perpetually up for a shag and believes
himself to be irresistibly sexy.  That's it.  By the time he performed
his climactic striptease to "I Touch Myself," I wasn't laughing but
silently grinning, if even that.
After _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ gets past a brief prologue that writes
off the love interest of the previous film, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth
Hurley), the film dives headlong into an elaborate credit sequence:
Austin prances through a hotel in the buff (with strategically placed
props, natch), culminating in an Esther Williams-style aquatic production
number.  Once this is all over, Austin is, to borrow one of his catch
phrases, "spent"--creatively speaking.  It's not so much that Myers,
co-writer Michael McCullers, and returning director Jay Roach do nothing
new with Austin in terms of story (again, he must thwart the
magalomaniacal Dr. Evil, who has travelled back in time to 1969 to steal
Austin's "mojo") than in terms of his thin character.  Austin's "Yeah,
baby!" one-liners, retro wardrobe, bad teeth, and swinging attitude--all
mined for their entire worth and then some in
_International_Man_of_Mystery_--haven't gotten better, just older.  Even
the diehards in the audience got bored; after Austin's umpteenth scene
transition dance number, one once-howling fan was overheard saying, "That
was stupid."
For me, Austin's archnemesis, the idiotic, hopelessly square, but no
less dastardly Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) was always more
interesting.  Surprisingly, _The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ focuses more on him
than it does Austin, and the film benefits from that fact.  Unlike their
laissez-faire treatment of Austin, Myers and company have actually taken
Dr. Evil in a fresh direction.  In the first film, Dr. Evil's antiquated
'60s sensibilities clashed with those of the '90s; in this one, the
opposite is the case, with his new pseudo-hip, ultra '90s mentality a
jarring anachronism in 1969.  It sounds less than inspired in concept,
but in execuation it fuels the film's best moments, most of which involve
his new midget clone Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer), whom a doting Dr. Evil
prefers to his black sheep biological son Scott (Seth Green, also
returning).
The rest of the film is a study in give and take.  Heather Graham cuts a
shagadelic figure as Austin's new sidekick/love interest, CIA agent
Felicity Shagwell, but Hurley's icy hauteur in the first film made for a
more effective foil.  As enjoyable as the bulk of Mini-Me's antics are,
his knock-down, drag-out fight with Austin is a less effective retread of
the MTV Movie Award-winning Ben Stiller-Puffy the Dog confrontation in
_There's_Something_About_Mary_.  Rob Lowe does an even better Robert
Wagner than Wagner himself as the '60s incarnation of Dr. Evil's yes-man
Number Two (Wagner also briefly reprises his role as the '90s Number
Two), but he is underutilized.
As with the original film, my just-OK assessment of
_Austin_Powers:_The_Spy_Who_Shagged_Me_ is sure to be in the minority,
and the film's certain success will cement _Austin_Powers_ as a New Line
franchise.  And as lukewarm as my take on these first two films are, I'd
welcome a third--that is, if there can somehow be an _Austin_Powers_ film
without Austin himself.

Review for Save the Last Dance (2001)
_Save_the_Last_Dance_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
At quick glance, Julia Stiles' filmography is far from impressive.  The
teen comedies _10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_ and _Down_to_You_.  Michael
Almereyda's woefully misguided Y2K-set adaptation of _Hamlet_.  Even the
one step she has seemingly taken in the right direction, David Mamet's
_State_and_Main_, is a decidedly subpar effort from its celebrated
writer-director.
But if one actually saw all of these projects, one thing is abundantly
clear: while the films as a whole do not deliver, Stiles always does. 
She gave _10_Things_ the sharp edge that the rest of the movie sorely
lacked; she radiated warmth and intelligence that was otherwise absent in
_Down_to_You_; and she more than kept up with the top-drawer ensemble
casts in _Hamlet_ and _State_and_Main_.  Stiles' latest starring vehicle,
_Save_the_Last_Dance_, continues this pattern: she rises to the occasion
in an enterprise that is beneath her game efforts.
After the death of her mother, Stiles' Sara Johnson moves to Chicago to
live with her errant father (Terry Kinney), with whom she has
relationship that's tense at best.  Sara has slightly less difficulty
finding comfort at her predominantly African-American high school, for
she is quickly taken under the wing of Chenille (Kerry Washington), an
outgoing single mother.  While Sara and Chenille quickly become best
friends, that soon pales in comparison to Sara's burgeoning relationship
with Chenille's ambitious brother Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), who helps
reawaken her dream of becoming a dancer--a goal she abandoned after her
mother's untimely passing.
Unlike most teen-targeted films, _Save_the_Last_Dance_ cannot be accused
of not being about anything; in fact, it tries to be about too much.  In
addition to being the story of Sara finding her place and reclaiming her
dream, it's also about the Sara/Derek romance, complete with all the
outside stumbling blocks that come with an interracial union.  It's also
about Derek's criminal past, and whether or not he'll fall back on the
wrong side of the law with best friend Malakai (Fredro Starr).  And last
but certainly not least, it's about a lily white girl learning to put
some soul into her dance moves.  With so many balls in the air, director
Thomas Carter and writers Duane Adler and Cheryl Edwards are bound to
drop some, and indeed they do; their biggest slip comes in the hackneyed,
overblown climax.
What works best in _Save_the_Last_Dance_ is the Sara/Derek pairing, and
that's because Stiles and Thomas are so well-matched.  Not only are they
instantly likable and have a genuine, gentle rapport, they also have the
chops to bring real pathos to overly familiar dramatic situations.  But
with the title _Save_the_Last_Dance_, acting ability is somewhat
secondary to dancing ability, and Stiles and Thomas can definitely hold
their own on a dance floor.
Ultimately, this talented twosome can only do so much with a script that
continually lets them down at about every turn.  With yet another
impressive turn to her credit, Stiles has once again earned her stripes
as someone to watch.  But until someone puts her in a real movie, it'll
be hard to maintain the desire to keep watching.

Title
Review for Gift, The (2000)
The modestly budgeted _The_Gift_ marks a homecoming of sorts for
director Sam Raimi, who returns to his roots in the cinema of the
supernatural after a largely lambasted spin on the big-bucks mainstream
field with the Kevin Costner starrer _For_Love_of_the_Game_.  But unlike
his landmark _Evil_Dead_ splatter laffer series, Raimi is going for
straight-faced chills this time around--in a way, melding his flamboyant
_Evil_Dead_ instincts with the more cerebral thriller elements he
successfully tried on for size in _A_Simple_Plan_, his big studio
breakthrough.  To twist a tired cliché, the whole is a step short of the
sum of its parts.
One of the strongest parts in question is the central performance of
Cate Blanchett, shedding her usual period piece garb for the role of
Annie Wilson, a widowed mother of three sons in modern-day Brixton,
Georgia.  The gift of the title is Annie's clairvoyance, which enables
her to earn a modest living as a psychic reader despite the protests of
the town's more religious residents, who see her ability as the work of
the Devil.  When Jessica King (Katie Holmes), a vivacious young member of
Brixton high society, mysteriously disappears, Annie's gift forces her
into a prominent--albeit reluctant--place in the investigation. 
Blanchett's modulated turn is key to the psychological horror of the
piece; her controlled work as Annie finds herself increasingly unable to
control or make sense of her visions adds a layer of subtlety that not
only makes the proceedings a bit more unsettling but also consistently
grounded in a convincing reality.
For the most part, Blanchett's co-stars provide able support.  The big
surprise is Keanu Reeves, a real embarrassment as a villain in the
atrocious-as-a-whole _The_Watcher_, in the role of this film's main
baddie, hot-tempered redneck Donnie Barksdale (a part that would have
been a perfect fit for one of _The_Gift_'s writers, Billy Bob Thornton). 
As Donnie's abused wife and Annie's loyal client Valerie, Hilary Swank
makes an impression--unfortunately, however, one not as strong as the one
left by the ridiculously awful hair extensions she wears.  Holmes
memorably reveals another side of herself in every sense as the sexy
Jessica, and Greg Kinnear is ideally cast as her nice guy fiancé (though
one wonders why he's the only guy in town without an accent).  Sticking
out like a sore thumb from the rest of the cast is Giovanni Ribisi, who
plays a troubled young mechanic befriended by Annie.  Ribisi is a
talented actor, but he has a tendency to fly way off the handle if not
held properly in check--and that is the case here; it's hard to believe
that his scenery-devouring turn once generated some Oscar buzz.
And any preliminary awards buzz _The_Gift_ may have once had is
ultimately done in by Thornton and Tom Epperson's script.  To their
credit, they do succeed in setting up the flavor of this tiny Southern
town, and the character of Annie and her plight are well-drawn before
Blanchett's performance is factored in.  But the film is more a genre
piece than anything else, and it's under these more modest demands that
the script falls short.  While a few of the puzzle pieces come together
in an interesting way and there is the occasional creepy sequence (though
a lot of the credit for both goes to Raimi's ever-inventive visuals), the
film's central mystery is less than one.  The revelation of the person
responsible for Jessica's disappearance isn't so much a twist as an
inevitable, easily foreseeable turn; a fairly humdrum climax fails to
compensate for the disappointing lack of surprise--rendering this _Gift_
more akin to a lump of coal, albeit one with an uncommonly inviting
sheen.

Title
Review for I'm Losing You (1998)
_I'm_Losing_You_ ** 1/2 (out of ****)
The one time the titular line is uttered in Bruce Wagner's adaptation of
his own novel of the same name is within the context of a cellular phone
conversation--as in, one is "losing" the signal on the phone.  But the
"loss" that is the main concern of this downbeat drama is the ultimate
one--loss of life.  Television producer Perry (Frank Langella) learns he
has terminal cancer at the beginning of the film, and that is indeed just
the start of it.  His struggling actor son Bertie (Andrew McCarthy) sells
life insurance policies for dying AIDS patients, and he falls in love
with a deceptively healthy-looking HIV-positive woman (Elizabeth
Perkins).  When Bertie's adoptive sister--and natural cousin--Rachel
(Rosanna Arquette) begins to learn the truth about her birth parents'
deaths, it sets her life on a morbid journey of self-discovery.  And so
on.
Well-acted and competently directed, _I'm_Losing_You_ does accomplish
what Wagner has obviously set out to do, which is create this
overwhelming and exhausting sense of melancholy.  But a few flaws in his
script keep the film from being a complete success.  Some late-inning
plot developments are forced and contrived; even less convincing is the
annoyingly inconsistent character of Rachel, who undergoes radical shifts
according to the needs of the plot.  As the film wears on, the title
could very easily be something Wagner says in reference to the audience.

Title
Review for Nurse Betty (2000)
        Neil LaBute, writer-director of the cynical (and brilliant)
bile-fests _In_the_Company_of_Men_ and _Your_Friends_&_Neighbors_, would
be the last person one would expect to bring a fairy tale story to the
screen, but that's exactly what he has done with _Nurse_Betty_.  But this
being LaBute, this is an atypical fairy tale story made even more so
through the filter of a decidedly dark lens--and the film would not be
quite the subversively funny and all-around memorable entertainment that
it is without him.
        Given the lightness at the heart of _Nurse_Betty_, it's not
surprising that this is the first LaBute film to not have a screenplay
credited to him.  The scribes responsible are John C. Richards and James
Flamberg, and what a deliciously delirious story they weave in their
Cannes Fest-winning screenplay.  To give too much away would be criminal,
so I'll leave the synopsis simple.  When we first meet Betty Sizemore
(Renée Zellweger), she is a waitress and loyal viewer of the soap opera
_A_Reason_to_Love_.  After witnessing a traumatic event, Betty, under the
delusion that she is a nurse, hits the road toward Los Angeles to find
her true love, Loma Vista Hospital's Dr. David
Ravell--_A_Reason_to_Love_'s resident heartthrob doc, played by actor
George McCord (Greg Kinnear).  Did I also mention that in hot pursuit of
Betty are hitmen Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock)?
        This just sets the stage for even wilder twists, which point up
the irony of the film: as Betty actively pursues life in a soap, the real
life she ignores becomes just as, if not more, outrageous than one.  But
even for a film as plot-heavy as _Nurse_Betty_, characters, not story
points, are what's to be savored the most, and the actors effortlessly
navigate their roles' often bizarre evolutions.  Betty's
transformation--which really isn't one so much as a shift from one side
of her personality to another--is fluidly handled by Zellweger, and she
is mirrored by the more subtle, gradual change that overcomes Freeman's
Charlie the closer he gets to his prey.
        With this fascinating pair at the center of the film, it would
seem to follow that supporting players get the short shrift, but each
role, regardless of how small, is nailed by their respective portrayer. 
Kinnear's usual smarmy charm bit gets a new freshness within the wildly
creative context; Rock, while tossing off the expected profane
one-liners, is rather shocking in his portrayal of his ferocious hothead
character.  Also lending most welcome flavor and zing to the picture are
Tia Texada as Betty's bewildered L.A. roommate, Alison Janney as the
producer of _A_Reason_to_Love_, and LaBute regular Aaron Eckhart as
Betty's sleazy car salesman husband.
        Lest you think that _Nurse_Betty_ is all wacky zaniness, don't
think LaBute's naturally dark sensibilities never enter the picture--they
do, and in the form of some graphic violence.  Other critics have
criticized the film because of it, but the bloodshed--and the sometimes
excessive nature of it--provides a necessary contrast that keeps the
audience off-kilter; one never knows when Betty's fantasy world could
take a hairpin turn back into brutal reality.  That unpredictability and
tension, as further carried out by the top-notch performances and
writing, give _Nurse_Betty_ the drive to carry the audience past any
lingering disbelief and into some silly, smart, and strange cinematic
heights.

Title
Review for Lost Highway (1997)
David Lynch's reputation as master of the surreal is not in any
danger with the release of his first film in five years, Lost Highway.  In
the new film, Lynch's bizarre, dream-like approach is as fascinating as
ever... and every bit as frustrating as well.  Lynch's gift has always been
his curse, and his latest work is just more evidence supporting that fact.
The "plot" defies traditional explanation, but I'll try anyhow.  The
excellent first act introduces us to married couple Fred and Renee Madison
(Bill Pullman and Patricia Arquette).  Immediately we get the sense that all
is not well here: Fred, a jazz saxophonist, suspects that his pretty
brunette wife could be up to no good whenever he is away performing at a
club.  Things get creepy when the two start finding videotapes anonymously
dropped off on their doorstep each morning.  These tapes begin innocently
enough--an exterior shot of their house--but each successive tape goes
further, entering the house, eventually showing things that should not be
seen by outsiders.  Somehow figuring into this is a white-faced Mystery Man
(Robert Blake), who, in a genuinely spooky moment, confronts Fred at a
party.  This segment of the film is Lynch at his best; with the aid of
cinematographer Peter Deming and master composer Angelo Badalamenti, he ably
creates a chilling atmosphere of dread that gets under the skin.  We know
something bad is bound to happen; we just don't know what.
Needless to say, things do get bad; unfortunately, the bad extends
to the audience.  Lynch's fervid imagination once again gets the better of
him, as the weirdness of plausible situations clears out to make way for the
just plain weird.  Fred is sentenced to Death Row for a brutal crime
depicted on one of the videotapes, and after suffering a series of massive
head pains, he wakes up one morning a new man--literally: 19-year-old
mechanic Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty), who is promptly released from
prison.  Pete eventually gets sexually entangled with Alice, the sultry
blonde girlfriend of a local gangster/pornographer (Robert Loggia).  The
"clever" twist?  Alice is also played by Arquette.
To describe anything that goes on beyond this stage is pointless,
for at this point it becomes clear that the film, which began so
promisingly, is actually about nothing; all established characters and plots
are virtually irrelevant.  What Lynch and co-scripter Barry Gifford (who
also had a hand in Lynch's horrid mess Wild at Heart) ultimately appear to
be after is an experimental exercise in elliptical dialogue and situations;
in non-linear, circular narrative.  Granted, this _is_ an interesting
experiment; I can't say I was ever bored.  But I just wish there were some
kind of accessible story within this interesting framework, a real plot on
which to hang all the graphic sex and gruesome violence--in short, a point
to all of this.  Say what you will about Lynch's last film, 1992's
much-maligned Twin Peaks--Fire Walk with Me, but at least that film, its
many baffling "Lynchian" touches aside, had a genuine story at its core;
distinct characters and plot can be delineated.  Here, there's a lot to feed
the visceral senses, but nothing else.
Lost Highway, like other Lynch films, does stay with you long after
it's over.  But for once I'd like to know exactly why it does.  In the end,
Lost Highway lives up to its title--a long, winding road that will leave all
travellers lost.

Title
Review for X Files, The (1998)
The X-Files (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Fox's _The_X-Files_ one of television's most curious phenomenons.  It's
not a question of quality; though it has a dud episode here and there, the
science fiction sensation is a consistently engrossing, well-thought and
-put-together series that deserves all the critical accolades it has
garnered in its five seasons.  What makes the series' hard-fought-for mass
popularity so astonishing is the uncommon demand it places upon the viewing
audience: concentration.  This is especially the case with its trademark
"mythology" episodes, which address a ridiculously convoluted conspiracy
involving the coverup of extraterrestrial life.  Now FBI agents Fox Mulder
and Dana Scully take their quest for the "truth" that lies elusively "out
there" to the big screen, and the result is a most unusual summer
blockbuster: one that delivers the thrilling goods with an uncommon dose of
intelligence and complexity.
As fans of the show (_X_-philes, as they are known) such as myself are
aware, _The_X-Files_ centers on Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully's
(Gillian Anderson) ongoing investigations into paranormal phenomena--cases
called, yes, X-Files.  Of course, Mulder and Scully are mismatched
partners.  Mulder is a true believer in the fantastic after having
witnessed his sister Samantha's abduction by aliens when they were young;
medical doctor Scully is a skeptical woman of science who was paired with
Mulder by FBI superiors to debunk his work.  In a move that, surprisingly
enough, does _not_ alienate any _X_-virgins, the film (unofficially
subtitled _Fight_the_Future_) begins where this past season's cliffhanger
left off, with the X-Files closed and Mulder and Scully reassigned to
standard FBI duty and a seemingly standard case: the investigation of a
terrorist bomb threat in Dallas.
The operative word there is "seemingly," for some suspicious circumstances
surrounding the case thrusts Mulder and Scully neck-deep into the ongoing
conspiracy that has served as the backbone of the series.  Much effort has
been made by Fox and the _X-Files_ cast and crew to keep the plot under
wraps, so I will not divulge any specifics here.  What I will reveal,
however, is that this time around Mulder and Scully find some hard answers
to questions that have long lingered in the series, such as the true nature
of the conspiracy and the "black cancer," the oily alien goo that infects
human hosts.  It should be noted, however, that many of the series' focal
mysteries, such as the identity of the enigmatic conspirator known as the
Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis), remain unanswered when the end
credits roll.
What I just wrote may sound baffling to _X_ newcomers, but series creator
and screenwriter Chris Carter (working from a story he devised with Frank
Spotnitz) accomplishes the impossible--making the knotty story accessible
to new viewers.  Mulder and Scully's backstories are efficiently explained
in succinct passages of dialogue, as is all the background knowledge
required to follow and understand the conspiracy.  A few bones are thrown
to appease the _X_ faithful, such as vague allusions to the harrowing
ordeals Scully has gone through in the series, and a cameo by the Lone
Gunmen, a trio of conspiracy freaks that often assist Mulder and Scully.
But by and large, no one is likely to be lost.  In the lobby following the
screening, I overheard a fan answer a newcomer's questions, and his queries
were about issues that are irrelevant to the general understanding of the
film.
A large part of what makes _Fight_the_Future_ satisfying to all audiences
is the highly suspenseful story Carter and director Rob Bowman tell.  The
plot is as intricately structured and unpredictable as the conspiracy
itself, and while there is a greater emphasis on action and spectacle here,
those sequences are integral to the story and free of gratuitous violent
shocks.  Bowman is a veteran of many _X_ episodes, and as such, he knows
how to milk the maximum amount of tension from Carter's labyrinthian
scripts.  He also handles the film's increased yet still
modest-by-Hollywood-standards budget quite well, employing some imaginative
effects to create some truly scary creatures.  Bowman's huge
miscalculation, however, is one that could have been easily sidestepped:
the virtual absence of Mark Snow's (who also composed the film's score)
memorably eerie theme music.  A single bar of the theme's trademark whistle
accompanies the film's first frame, and an upbeat interpolation is featured
in a sequence where Mulder and Scully drive.  But that unmistakable _X_
theme is featured more in the trailers than the film itself--a fact that is
sure to irk even the most casual of _X_-philes.
For all the scary aliens and other creatures that pop up in _The_X-Files_
week after week, the key to the show and, now, the movie's success is its
leads.  Duchovny and Anderson's natural rapport shines through even
stronger on the big screen, and apparently Carter recognized this, for the
sexual tension between Mulder and Scully reaches unprecedented heights of
palpability in _Fight_the_Future_.  I won't spoil anything, but Carter
comes up with a clever way to have his cake and eat it too, one that will
please all series fans.  The solid work of the other series semi-regulars,
Davis, John Neville (the Well-Manicured Man), and Mitch Pileggi (FBI
Assistant Director Walter Skinner) carries over to the big screen; however,
members of the Pileggi "Estrogen Brigade" are sure to be disappointed with
Skinner's diminished role in the film.  Martin Landau (filling the Deep
Throat/X/Marita Covarrubias "informant" role) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (as a
conspiracy figurehead) join the ensemble, and they appear very much at home
in the _X_ world.
For a big screen, interseason episode of a series that is still running
strong on the small screen, the satisfying _X-Files_ movie is remarkably
self-contained.  Yet it should come as no surprise that, in addition to the
existing unresolved questions, some new ones arise--ensuring plenty of
fodder for many more TV seasons and feature films.  As one character
declares, "One man cannot fight the future."

Title
Review for Living Out Loud (1998)
_Living_Out_Loud_ (R) *** (out of ****)
All signs seem to indicate that New Line is at a loss as to how to market
_Living_Out_Loud_: the poster is simply three candid headshots of the stars
(Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito, and Queen Latifah) unimaginatively arranged on
a black background, and the dull trailer left every audience I've seen it
with making audible groans.  It's a shame, for hot Hollywood scribe Richard
LaGravenese's directorial debut is a nice surprise, a refreshingly adult
romantic comedy-drama.
When I say "adult," I don't mean as in raunchy but as in mature--in
attitude and characters.  The central pair are two lonely, divorced people
north of 40.  Judith (Hunter) has lost all direction and meaning in life
after her successful surgeon husband (Martin Donovan) left her for a
thirtysomething (Tamlyn Tomita); she drinks heavily, spending most of her
days in her apartment and her nights listening to her favorite crooner Liz
Bailey (Latifah, who does her own singing) perform at a jazz club.  Pat
(DeVito)'s marriage, already troubled by his gambling, was dealt a fatal
blow when his daughter succumbed to cancer.
There's a lyric in a key song in the musical _Rent_ that goes, "What was
it about that night?/Connection in an isolating age."  Such a connection in
such a night is the pivotal event in _Living_Out_Loud_, but it's not
between the pair one would expect.  One night at the club, Judith receives
a passionate kiss from a mysterious stranger (Elias Koteas), which shakes
her out of her malaise.  Her renewed sense of romantic hope leads her to
engage in idle conversation with her posh building's doorman, Pat, and
gradually their talk grows deeper--eventually resulting in the profoundly
touching connection between Judith and Pat.
There is not much plot in _Living_Out_Loud_, but LaGravenese's main
concern here are, rather, the characters and their relationships, and he
succeeds in creating genuine, recognizably human characters that are
sympathetic to the audience.  This is not to say that they are incredibly
wholesome; they are generally good but flawed individuals, especially in
the case of Judith, who is often angry and more than a little
self-centered.   These characters connect with the viewer because the
viewer can see a little of themselves in everyone: bitter Judith, broken
Pat, and the (mostly) sensible Liz.
The most well-rounded character is, of course, Judith, and the film's
title is what she must learn to do: live "out loud" and not in her head.
LaGravenese delves into _Ally_McBeal_ territory by depicting Judith's
imaginings on screen, and the results, for the most part, are effective,
generating some of the film's best laughs.  (Especially memorable is one
where she jumps from her bedroom window to her death, which is then
immediately reported on the news.)  But LaGravenese sometimes doesn't know
when to quit.  A delightful dance floor epiphany, with Judith and other
dancers suddenly breaking into synchronized, choreographed moves, is marred
by its heavyhanded, unsubtly symbolic conclusion where she literally
embraces her younger self.
LaGravenese makes up for his occasional missteps (the origins of Judith
and Liz's friendship is unconvincing) with his musical choices.  George
Fenton composed the silky score, which effectively extends the mellow
jazz/R&B sounds  beyond the walls of the nightclub.  The smooth, soothing
soundtrack could not be a better fit for the laid-back, low-key, unforced
appeal of _Living_Out_Loud_.

Title
Review for Chinese Box (1997)
Chinese Box (R) **
Comrades: Almost a Love Story ****
        Director Wayne Wang is understandably passionate about China's July 1,
1997 takeover of Hong Kong; having been born and raised there, and it is
not surprising that he chose to address the issue in a film.  But instead
of taking the predictable route and focusing on the politics of the
changeover, Wang, with the help of writers Jean-Claude Carriere, Larry
Gross, and Paul Theroux, decided to use the upheaval as the backdrop for a
love story.  Not a bad decision in theory, but definitely one in practice,
for the resulting film, the disappointing Chinese Box, is as cold and
uninteresting as a smaller HK-set romance currently in release, the modest
HK production Comrades: Almost a Love Story, is lively and touching.
        The obvious passion that Wang has for his homeland does not visibly extend
his two tortured lovers, John (Jeremy Irons) and Vivian (Gong Li).  John is
a terminally ill British journalist who has lived in Hong Kong for 15
years; former Mainlander Vivian is a bar owner trying to live down her past
as a prostitute.  John, who left behind a wife and children in England, is
deeply in love with Vivian, but her foolish hope that high-society
boyfriend Chang (Michael Hui) will marry her keeps them apart.  This should
be an involving triangle, but it never once engages the emotions, due in
large part to the ill-defined backstory between John and Vivian.  What
passes for insight comes in the form of a brief, dialogue-free, and
extremely vague flashback in which John, through a voiceover, says in so
many words that he and Vivian met in Shanghai, grew close, "should have"
become lovers but did not.  It is hard to develop a rooting interest in
their potential romance if there is never a clear idea of the bond they
supposedly share.
        Even more problematic is the character of Vivian--that is, if she even
qualifies as one.  The stunning Li is mainland China's premier actress, and
anyone familiar with her work in films such as Ju Dou know that her
exquisite beauty is more than matched by her formidable acting ability.
However, anyone seeing her for the first time in Chinese Box will come away
with a strong idea of the former but not the latter.  Since this film marks
Li's English-language debut, it is understandable that the filmmakers would
keep her English lines to a minimum.  But just how little dialogue she is
given is beyond ridiculous: "What?", "John," "Your problem, I fix it,"
"Bye," "Excuse me," and "Thank you" covers about half of her lines; her
dialogue in Chinese adds up to little more.  So for most of her screen
time, Li is called on to do little more than look gorgeous, with Vivian
coming off as more of an object than a flesh-and-blood person.
        If anything holds any audience interest in Chinese Box, it is the
supporting character of Jean, played by versatile Hong Kong superstar
Maggie Cheung.  Jean is a streetwise hustler whom John interviews for a
video account of colonial Hong Kong's final six months, attempting to put a
finger on the nation's "soul."  Jean is a fascinating character, whose
hardened exterior hides the deep emotional scars that match the one that
brands her face; she was abused by her father as a child, and she still
pines for the true love of her teen years, a Briton whose rejection of her
prompted a suicide attempt.  But much like the other threads in the film,
her storyline does not reach a satisfying resolution, and the conclusions
that Chinese Box does reach are simple and obvious.  I am not spoiling
anything when John comes to the ultimate realization that the elusive
"soul" of Hong Kong is not defined but constantly changing.
        Hong Kong's perpetual evolution is also used as the backdrop for a romance
in Peter Chan's 1996 decade-spanning masterpiece Comrades: Almost a Love
Story, which also stars Cheung and is currently rolling out across the
States on a city-by-city basis.  The comrades of the title are Qiao
(Cheung) and Xiaojun (Leon Lai), two native Mainlanders, who, as the film
begins, live in Hong Kong.  Their shared homeland is just about the only
thing the worldly wise Qiao and the naive Xiaojun have in common.  Xiaojun
maintains strong ties to China, in Hong Kong only to earn enough money to
marry his sweetheart back home while the ambitious Qiao hides her mainland
origins, working every minute of the day to achieve her dream of a wealthy
livelihood.  The two first meet in 1986 at a McDonald's, where she holds
down one of her numerous jobs.  Although her involvement with him should
end once she refers him to a language school (earning a commission, of
course), the two form an unlikely and often humorous friendship that leads
to love.  It's just that the two are much too proud to admit to it--even as
they spend more than one passionate night together.
        As the years pass, their chosen life paths take Qiao and Xiaojun in
opposite directions (literally and figuratively), but fate constantly
brings them back together, only to be pulled apart at every juncture by
conflicting dreams, love affairs, or both.  It sounds rather contrived, but
the stream of plot developments that Chan and screenwriter Ivy Ho devise
are entirely believable, which makes every reunion/breakup cycle all the
more heartbreaking.  The story's poignance is further elevated by the
electric chemistry between Lai and Cheung, whose work here won her the 1997
Hong Kong Film Award (one of the film's nine, including Best Picture and
Best Director) for Best Actress.  Lai is quite good, but Cheung is the real
marvel.  Her wonderfully expressive features are used to full effect by
Chan, whether to convey Qiao's spunky haughtiness at the beginning or her
eventual soul-aching longing (a simple, late-in-the-film gaze she casts
upon Xiaojun as he walks away from her car is particularly gut-wrenching).
        Both Chinese Box and Comrades: Almost a Love Story tell simple romances,
but their difference in effect can be attributed to the effort behind it.
The beauty of Comrades comes in how it does not try too hard; everything
about it feels natural and real.  On the other hand, Wang and company, as
much as they wanted to make a Hong Kong story, were obviously straining for
an idea; as such, what should have been the emotional hook of Chinese Box
is forced and unconvincing, rendering that talent-heavy film shockingly
impotent.  (Chinese Box opens April 3)

Title
Review for Snatch. (2000)
Fans of Guy Ritchie's 1998 cult fave
_Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels_ will be happy to learn that
shacking up with Madonna and siring her a son have had no discernible
effect on the writer-director--at least not one noticeable in his second
film, _Snatch_.  (There is, however, one blatant concession to the union,
and that is the prominent placement of the Material Girl's vintage tune
"Lucky Star"--hardly a bad thing, if you ask me.)  In fact, nothing
appears to have affected or changed Ritchie at all between this latest
film and his last, for _Snatch_ is a full-throttle comedic crime caper
that more than resembles _Lock,_Stock..._ yet remains a rollicking good
time in its own right.
Like _Lock,_Stock..._ and just about every other entry in the
neo-noir-laffer genre, _Snatch_ takes an assortment of eccentric
characters and tosses them in a blender of danger, double-cross, dark
comedy, and a dog (OK, the last element is specific to this film).  Our
guide through the convolutions of this twisty tale is Turkish (Jason
Statham), an unlicensed boxing promoter who is business partners and best
friends with Tommy (Stephen Graham), who is in the slot machine business.
 When Turkish and Tommy's plans to fix a fight for bigwig Brick Top (Alan
Ford) go horribly awry, thus begins a chain of chaos that links with a
large stolen diamond.
This is but a short strand of the knotty yarn that is woven in _Snatch_,
not to mention an even smaller sampling of the shady sons-of-bitches that
populate Ritchie's grimy London underworld.  In addition to the
pig-farm-owning, dog-fight-loving Brick Top, there's hard-to-kill Russian
badass Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia); Sol (Lennie James) and Vincent
(Robbie Gee), pawnbrokers who, along with heavyset getaway driver Tyrone
(Ade), make an inept robbery team; Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), an Irish
gypsy bare-knuckle brawler with an unintelligible accent; Doug "the Head"
(Mike Reid), a gentile jeweler who pretends he's Jewish to benefit
business; American crook Avi (Dennis Farina), who gets the ball rolling
by hiring ace thief Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) to steal that
big ol' diamond.
With such a large canvas of players--and there are more than a few
others I haven't mentioned--it is indeed difficult at first to keep track
of them, even after each one is stylishly introduced with a freeze-frame
title card.  What doesn't take so long, however, is getting caught up in
these colorful characters and the swirl of events that sweep them
together.  Ritchie's stylized visuals do bear a show-offy sheen, but
there's no denying the eye candy makes an effective initial hook.
And once hooked, it isn't so much Ritchie's consistently interesting
visuals that keeps the audience interested than his clever,
unpredictable, breakneck plotting and memorably off-center characters. 
He can't take full responsibility for the latter matter, though, for most
of the credit must go to the actors.  While Del Toro's Franky is another
of his tiresome, trademark marble-mouths, Pitt makes shockingly good use
of his character's verbal tic, the basis of many a good laugh.  Ford,
Farina, Ade, Gee, and James also make their mark without the benefit (or
hindrance) of a funky accent.  Providing a welcome center of calm amid
all the quirkiness is the quietly captivating Statham.
With its considerable similarities in style and tone with
_Lock,_Stock..._, _Snatch_ cannot be considered a real creative step
forward for Ritchie; the film doesn't reveal anything especially new
about his ability (except, perhaps, his effective direction of
bigger-name actors).  That said, I do think _Snatch_ is a step _up_;
while Ritchie essentially covers the same ground he did in that last
film, here he does it with more confidence and panache.  But given his
obvious talent and potential as a filmmaker, here's hoping Ritchie
doesn't trap himself in this scuzzy/funny crime milieu--though if he
continues to work the genre, let's hope he can do so with the same level
of energy and imagination.  (opens December 6 in Los Angeles for one week
only; opens everywhere January 19)

Title
Review for Air Force One (1997)
Air Force One (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        If the President's private plane, Air Force One, were hijacked, it's
highly unlikely that President Clinton (or any real-life Chief Executive)
would go mano y mano with the terrorists.  But this is Hollywood, where
wimpy presidents just don't sell.  So we have Wolfgang Petersen's Air Force
One, an exciting, entertaining variation of the Die Hard formula where our
kick-ass hero is none other than the President of the United States.
        Right from the get-go, we know Harrison Ford's President James
Marshall is one take-no-crap guy.  We first see him at a dinner at the
Kremlin, where he and the Russian president (Alan Woolf) are celebrating the
capture of General Alexander Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a fascist tyrant whose
brutal tactics wreaked havoc in Kazakhstan.  It is during this dinner that
he gives an impassioned speech saying that the United States will no longer
take action against such atrocities at the last minute, striking at the
first signs of trouble.  President Marshall gets his chance to back up his
words when, en route to Washington, Air Force One, is hijacked by a group of
Radek loyalists, led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman), demanding the
general's release.  With his wife (Wendy Crewson), daughter (Liesel
Matthews), and numerous staffers held hostage, it is up to President
Marshall to defeat the baddies and reassert America's reputation as the
leading global power.
        The basic conceit is a little far-fetched (then again, what action
movie plot isn't?), and given some of the clunky dialogue by screenwriter
Andrew W. Marlowe, sometimes it sounds ridiculous, too.  But while watching
the film, you buy it hook, line, and sinker, due in large part to the acting
talent on board.  Ford's commanding presence lends a sense of authenticity
to every project he's in.  It is one thing to be a convincing kick-ass
action hero and quite another to be believable as "the leader of the free
world"; not only does he pull off both without a hitch, but he also pulls
off the task fairly seamlessly.  When he is wacking a terrorist with a
stool, we also believe that this the president, doing what it takes to
protect his country; similarly, in more sedate presidential mode, we believe
that, when push comes to shove, he is capable of acting in such a violent
way.  Another huge acting asset is Glenn Close, serving as the plane's (and
the film's) dramatic anchor to reality as Vice President Kathryn Bennett,
who is the focus of the action in the White House.  Oldman is appropriately
restrained as Korshunov, wisely resisting the urge to camp it up as a lot of
action movie villains do these days.  Anything too over-the-top and outre,
like Oldman's turns in the Luc Besson films The Professional and The Fifth
Element, would seem too out of place here.
        But this is not to say that Air Force One is a gravely serious and
self-important championing of the American presidency.  Even though
President Marshall is a combat veteran who can more than hold his own in a
fight, he still is a desk jockey by trade.  He's no know-it-all gadget whiz
MacGyver; a lot of times he doesn't know what he's doing or how to do it.
The little comic touches, from little one-liners to scenes such as one where
he reads an instruction manual to a cellular telephone work not so much
because they are funny but because they also ring true (after all, wouldn't
the president have someone make his calls for him?).
        Air Force One does not offer as much character nor plot to chew on
as Petersen's last thriller involving the presidency, 1993's terrific Clint
Eastwood starrer In the Line of Fire, but it still delivers the goods--a
brisk pace, explosions, gunplay, fights, lots of airborne action, strong
acting, and, last and certainly not least, the legendary Harrison Ford.

Title
Review for Black Dog (1998)
In 1990, the surprise success an unheralded little movie called Ghost
instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above-the-title
stars, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg.  Eight years later,
Moore and Goldberg's careers aren't exactly thriving, but they have had
their share of screen successes since; the same can't be said of Swayze,
who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named
Black Dog.
Forget the Mortal Kombat movies--this trucksploitation flick is the
closest the movies has come to video games.  Good truck driver Jack Crews
(Swayze) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from Atlanta to New Jersey.
Along the way, Jack and his crew of three run into a number of
obstacles--such as a highway weigh station, evil truckers, and deadly
Uzi-firing motorcyclists.  Every so often, like at the end of a video game
"level" or "stage," the main baddie pops up: Red (Meat Loaf, fresh from the
triumph of Spice World), who wants to steal the cache of guns. Just in case
you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who's driving what,
all of Red's vehicles, be it a pickup or a big rig, are painted--you
guessed it--red.
I could go into more of the plot specifics (such as Jack's dream of having
a nice home with his family, the past trauma that sent him to prison and
cost him his trucking license, the FBI/ATF crew tracking the cargo), but
they are of little importance.  All that matters to director Kevin Hooks
and writers William Mickelberry and Dan Vining are the obstacles Jack
confronts in his drive from point A to point B.  But they fail at even this
modest goal, for none of the highway chaos, as credibly staged as it is, is
terribly interesting, let alone exciting. Once you've seen a couple of
trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time, you've
seen it every time.
As dreary as Black Dog is as an entertainment, the saddest part about the
film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen; it's that Swayze has to
reduce himself to such work.  While far from the best of actors, he is
certainly not horrible, and he is a charismatic presence. I don't know if
it's his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to
involve himself with bombs such as Black Dog.  Regardless, if he continues
on this career track, could a TV series be far behind?

Title
Review for Sparkler (1998)
Director Darren Stein's debut film is on the flip side of the coin
occupied by his recently released, much-maligned sophomore effort,
_Jawbreaker_ (which I actually happened to like).  The micro-budgeted indie
_Sparkler_ is as grainy and rough around the edges as the studio effort
_Jawbreaker_ was slick and flashy.  The "sparkler" of the title, trailer
park queen Melba May (Park Overall), is as sweet and good-natured as
_Jawbreaker_'s main character, high school uberbitch Courtney Shayne, was
unrepentantly evil.
However, there is one overlying thing that the films have in common: in
both, Stein is aping the voice of other, better directors.  While he
channelled _Heathers_'s Michael Lehmann and _Clueless_'s Amy Heckerling in
_Jawbreaker_, in _Sparkler_, Stein goes after the demented vibe of John
Waters. Our white trash main character travels from Victorville, California
to Las Vegas to find a trio of young men (Freddie Prinze Jr., Jamie
Kennedy, and Steven Petrarca) she met by chance at a local bar.  Along the
way, she and the audience encounters such Waters-esque touches as
underground strip clubs and a butch lesbian wearing a T-shirt reading
"PUSSYWHIPPED."  The difference there isn't enough energy to the direction
to hide the fact that there is really no plot, just some loosely
strung-together of individual events; nor is there enough to make anything
barely cross the "amusing" mark.  (now playing in New York; opens in Los
Angeles April 2)

Review for Home Fries (1998)
Hollywood Hotline Featured Review
_Home_Fries_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Being fairly tired of the assembly-line product foisted upon us by the
Hollywood studios, I'm generally all in support of something offbeat.  But
it's one thing to be offbeat, and another thing entirely to be off-pitch.
The quirky dark comedy _Home_Fries_, I'm afraid, falls under the latter
category.
Don't be fooled by Warner Bros.'s misleading marketing campaign, which
sells this strange film as a light-as-a-feather romance.  At the center of
_Home_Fries_ is Henry Lever (Chris Ellis), whose upright dead body is found
in the middle of a field.   Harry, who had a heart ailment, was quite
literally scared to death by his two National Guard helicopter pilot
stepsons Dorian (Luke Wilson) and Angus (Jake Busey), who chase him down
with a chopper as a favor to their unhappy mother (Catherine O'Hara).
Since it all happened in the middle of nowhere, there are no witnesses--at
least by eye.  Possibly overhearing everything, thanks to some crossed
radio signals, is Sally (Drew Barrymore), a very pregnant young woman who
works the drive-thru at a local burger joint.  And, as it always
conveniently happens in the movies, the father of Sally's baby is the late
Henry.
To get close to Sally and find out what she may or may not know, Dorian
takes a job at Burger-Matic himself.  But he gets more than he bargained
for, slowly but surely falling for her.  _Home_Fries_ could have worked if
writer Vince Gilligan and director Dean Parisot kept things simple and left
the film at that.  But real-life loves Wilson and the always-engaging
Barrymore aren't given much breathing room to build an on-screen rapport;
they're all but drowned out by all the strange goings-on that compete for
attention.  Lurking in the background and occasionally stepping up to
center stage is the conniving Mrs. Lever, who has a Machiavellian grasp on
Angus, who will do anything he can to make his mother happy--even kill.
Gilligan obviously intended this subplot to give the film an
unconventional, dark edge, but it is largely unfunny, too broadly played,
and too much of what springs from it feels out of place.  Does there really
need to be a go-for-broke copter-car chase climax?
While I applaud the filmmakers' ambitions in creating something different,
I cannot help but feel that _Home_Fries_ would have been better if it were
more conventional.  Ironically, despite all the quirkiness being bandied
about, it is the film's most conventional aspect--the romance--that
remotely holds any interest.  Everything else, as offbeat as it is, is
simply a bore.

Title
Review for Truman Show, The (1998)
>From the moment he signed his name on the dotted line, _The_Truman_Show_
has been touted as Jim Carrey's big dramatic breakthrough (never mind that
he won numerous critical kudos for his work in the Emmy-nominated TV movie
_Doing_Time_on_Maple_Drive_).  Carrey indeed does a fine job in Peter
Weir's clever fantasy, but to focus all attention on his refreshing
change-of-pace turn is to discount the superior accomplishment of those
behind the scenes--and to give Carrey a bit _too_much_ credit.
Carrey's Truman Burbank has a nice house, white picket fence and all, in
the idyllic oceanside community of Seahaven; a loyal wife, Meryl (Laura
Linney); an even more loyal best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich); and a
cushy desk job.  If it sounds like a pretty picture from the TV screen,
that's because it is.  Unbeknownst to Truman, the entire life he has lived
is mere programming for a 24-hour television network.  Seahaven is one
large soundstage, where all events are scripted and all the inhabitants are
actors--that is, except for Truman, who was adopted as an infant by the
Omnicam Corporation, and has had every step of his life traced and molded
by _The_Truman_Show_'s creator, Christof (Ed Harris).
In addition to having an inventive plot hook, Andrew Niccol's screenplay
is expertly structured.  In its first minute, the basic outline of the
complex premise is made perfectly clear through a faux television credit
roll and soundbites from Meryl, Marlon (or, rather, the actors who play
them), and Christof.  For about the next hour, Niccol and Weir thrust the
audience directly into Truman's world, allowing them to experience for
themselves the surreal, synthetic way of "life" in Seahaven before going
into a more detailed backstory that fills in the few holes.  In the
process, the viewer is given a much more vivid and entertaining picture of
Truman's situation.
Truman is not as dumb as Christof or other crew members think, and he
begins to catch on to the grand charade that is his life when no one will
let him leave town.  The resulting conflict, within himself and with
everyone and everything around him, provides Carrey ample opportunity to
stretch while staying within comfortable acting bounds.  He gets to cry
(and convincingly at that) onscreen and play a fairly earnest character as
a whole, but he does make concessions to his core comedic audience.  When
Truman's suspicions grow, the more unhinged he gets, setting the stage for
some funny rubberfaced antics (no butt-talking, though--thankfully).
However, his performance is not the Oscar-baiting tour-de-force that a
number of sources would lead you to believe.  Carrey's shortcoming is most
clearly brought to light in one key subplot.  Although he likes Meryl, the
love of his life is Sylvia (Natascha McElhone), a fetching young woman whom
he barely knew in college.  Like the rest, Sylvia was an actress playing a
part, but when she broke script and actually fell for him, she was hastily
removed from the Seahaven set and the _Truman_ cast.  Truman was told that
she and her "father" moved to Fiji, and it's his longing for her that makes
him want to leave town.  This thread is supposed to be _Truman_'s emotional
hook, but it doesn't quite work for a couple of reasons.  The character of
Sylvia, who goes on to be the leader of the "Free Truman" movement, is
sketchily written, as are the reasons behind her deep feelings for Truman;
and, as evidenced in _Liar_Liar_, Carrey just isn't that convincing when it
comes to sentiment.  Granted, _Truman_ is nowhere near as sappy as that
film (not to mention the sap felt out of place there), but, while he is a
likable presence, Carrey doesn't have much of a natural emotional rapport
with the audience or, for that matter, his co-stars.  As such, one may
empathize with Truman's desire to break free, but not necessarily feel for
the romantic plight that motivates that desire.
Hence, the bravura work on display in _The_Truman_Show_ is that of Niccol
and Weir, who have crafted a subtly layered, perceptive, and pointedly
truthful commentary on the media and its and our own voyeuristic
tendencies.  While the ostensible villains of _The_Truman_Show_ are
Christof and his crew, coming off every bit as guilty is the viewing
audience, which is shown eating up every second of Truman's pre-packaged
"life" as their own lives idly waste away.  As outlandish as the entire
premise may seem, isn't _The_Truman_Show_ (in which one's life is
completely exploited as an entertainment "escape" for others) but just one
logical, merging step away from the current likes of _Jerry_Springer_'s
ongoing parade of dysfunction and those real-life "caught on tape" video
shows?

Title
Review for Gossip (2000/I)
Gossip.  While most people wouldn't like to admit it, a juicy rumor has
a certain allure--one that is often greater than that of truth.  The
thriller _Gossip_ takes its promising cue from this idea, but then the
film rapidly goes nowhere with it, growing more and more ridiculous with
each successive turn of the plot.
_Gossip_'s premise is simple.  For a project in their journalism class,
university students Derrick (James Marsden), Jones (Lena Headey), and
Travis (Norman Reedus) decide to plant and then trace the growth and
evolution of a rumor: that freshman Naomi (Kate Hudson), known for her
strict attitudes on sex, did the dirty deed with boyfriend Beau (Joshua
Jackson) while drunk at a party.  While the intent in harmless, the lie
quickly takes a life of its own, and soon everyone is suffering from the
fallout--not least of which the trio that started the whole mess.
The initial 20 minutes of _Gossip_, in which the three come up with
their bright idea and unleash it upon the campus, exploits the potential
of the premise.  Director Davis Guggenheim employs a creative and
succinct way to show how the gossip spreads and mutates: numerous people
directly address the camera, recounting the story as they heard it (or,
rather, think they heard it).  Straight-to-camera confessionals are a bit
cliché in the age of _The_Real_World_ and its ilk, but the energized
editing captures the excitement that accompanies a particularly enticing
piece of hearsay.
But much like how the Naomi-Beau rumor spins out of control, so does
_Gossip_.  The interesting premise established, Guggenheim and writers
Gregory Poirer and Theresa Rebeck proceed to do nothing with it.  Before
long, the subject that lends _Gossip_ its title comes to bear less
importance, and the film becomes a dismayingly conventional thriller
where characters end up having secret paths that provide needless added
motivation for certain actions.  Even on these dumbed-down terms,
_Gossip_ falls far short of the mark, but that doesn't stop Guggenheim
and company from also making the film a high minded "issue" movie.  I
won't say exactly what issue (to do so would reveal one of the film's key
"twists"), but the film tackles it with a fraction of the depth you'd
find in an afterschool special.
The cast certainly doesn't help the not-ready-for-the-big-screen feel. 
Marsden doesn't do anything here to counter the vacuous _Teen_Beat_ pinup
image he projected in _Disturbing_Behavior_; in fact, his performance
here is even more embarrassing, making the credibility-straining turns
his character undergoes even harder to swallow.  Headey is simply miscast
on a surface level.  She clearly looks much older than the rest of the
cast, resembling a mature woman among a group of kids; her American
accent is also pretty shaky.  Reedus does little to redeem what is
already a bad part: an artist who inexplicably finds a new, almost
obsessive inspiration in Naomi and her plight.  Speaking of Naomi, Hudson
is the only person who delivers a slightly credible performance.  More
seasoned stars, such as Sharon Lawrence, Edward James Olmos (both playing
police detectives), and Eric Bogosian (as the journalism professor) are
wasted.
It's only fitting that _Gossip_ will undoubtedly fall victim to its own
hook.  When word-of-mouth spreads--and it will, and quite quickly at
that--the film will take a much greater trouncing than the one felt by
its mischief-making characters.

Title
Review for Bug's Life, A (1998)
_A_Bug's_Life_ (G) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
With the release of Disney and Pixar's _A_Bug's_Life_, the first
head-to-head Disney-DreamWorks animation battle has officially taken place.
 The winner?  Well, there isn't one--it's a draw.  While their respective
studios continue their war of words and massive publicity, _Bugs_  and
_Antz_, it turns out, can peacefully co-exist, each carving out their own
delightful, distinctive niche in the computer-animated insect milieu.
The similarities between _Bugs_ and _Antz_ begin and end with the facts
that they are completely computer animated, center on ant colonies, and
that the two main characters are a worker ant (here named Flik, voiced by
Dave Foley) and an ant princess (Atta, voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus).
Ne'er-do-well Flik is ordered by the Princess to find warrior insects to
help his colony in their ongoing conflict with a gang of grasshoppers led
by the maniacal Hopper (Kevin Spacey).  Flik finds a willing group in the
praying mantis Manny (Jonathan Harris); his moth wife, Gypsy (Madeline
Kahn); male ladybug Francis (Denis Leary); walking stick Slim (David Hyde
Pierce); caterpillar Heimlich (Joe Ranft); black widow spider Rosie (Bonnie
Hunt); rhino beetle Dim (Brad Garrett); and pillbugs Tuck and Roll (Michael
McShane).  But as warrior-like as these bugs may appear, they are actually
gentle circus performers desperate for a gig after being fired by flea
circus owner P.T. Flea (John Ratzenberger).  Realizing his error, Flik
nonetheless tries to make a counteroffensive against the grasshoppers work,
lest he let down the colony once again.
The script for _A_Bug's_Life_, credited to co-director Andrew Stanton,
Donald McEnery, and Bob Shaw (from a story by Stanton, Ranft, and
co-director John Lasseter), lacks the sharp, satirical, sociopolitical
subtext of _Antz_.  For that matter, neither is the story as hilarious and
smart as that of the previous Disney/Pixar collaboration, _Toy_Story_.  In
telling a simpler story, _Bugs_ holds more kid and general family appeal,
but that does not mean that there isn't enough witty dialogue, funny
situations, and entertaining characters to amuse the adults in the crowd.
(In fact, the film's best gag, which comes during the end credits, is
clearly aimed at adults; I wouldn't dream of giving it away, but I will say
that, with any luck, it should kill a lazy trend in recent film.)  The most
memorable characters are distinguished by terrific voice performances:
Spacey completely inhabits the menacing Hopper with malicious glee;
Louis-Dreyfus is nicely neurotic as Atta; and Ranft fits Heimlich with a
hilarious, almost effeminate German accent.  As a whole, though, the
ensemble here won't make you forget the work of the more stellar cast of
_Antz_; Foley does an adequate job voicing Flik, but, not surprisingly, he
doesn't hold down the center of the movie as well as Woody Allen in the
other film.
Where _A_Bug's_Life_ is clearly superior to _Antz_ is in the visual
department.  The art by the Pixar crew is stunningly detailed, from the
gritty walls of the ant colony tunnels to, most impressively, the insects
themselves, namely the amazingly lifelike grasshoppers.  Lasseter and
Stanton also employ more ambitious camera work than their DreamWorks
counterparts, especially during an exciting aerial chase sequence set
during a rainstorm.  PDI did a terrific job with the animation on _Antz_,
but _A_Bug's_Life_ shows that Pixar is still the king of feature computer
animation.
And, by default, so is Disney, and, with its broader demographic appeal,
_A_Bug's_Life_ should handily outpace _Antz_'s impressive box office
grosses.  But DreamWorks has already established itself as a worthy
contender in the animation field, and the Mouse should watch out when the
big SKG fires its next assault, next month's hotly anticipated epic
_The_Prince_of_Egypt_.

Title
Review for Armageddon (1998)
For all the talk about their shared "the sky is falling" theme,
_Armageddon_, about an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, can best
be described as the opposite side of a coin shared by its counterpart, the
serious falling comet tale _Deep_Impact_.  That said, on its own, unique
terms, the slam-bang _Armageddon_ is a reasonably satisfying summer
blockbuster, with all the flaws and virtues that come with that label.
In addition to the "end of the world" theme, _Armageddon_ and
_Deep_Impact_ do have another thing in common: successfully overcoming a
setup that borders on the ridiculous.  After a group of top government and
scientific advisors determine that the only way to possibly prevent (yes)
armageddon is to detonate a nuclear bomb inside the asteroid, NASA
executive director Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) recruits expert deep-core
driller Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis, inexplicably speaking in a wildly
inconsistent drawl) and his crew to do the job.  Of course, these drillers
aren't astronauts, which means a slow-going hour-long passage in which the
roughnecks undergo extensive training and evaluation for their outer space
mission.  A lot of what goes on, including psychological and physical exams
and a side trip to a strip club, is supposed to be funny.  But with the
exception of a couple of one-liners dryly delivered by the
always-entertaining Steve Buscemi (as horny geologist Rockhound), the
comedy is merely tedious--just as tedious, in fact, as the setup of
_Deep_Impact_, but in a different way, ineptly aiming for cheap laughs as
opposed to earnestly setting up hokey, all-too-familiar disaster epic plot
threads.
_Armageddon_'s light touch is just one in its long line of differences
from its more grave counterpart.  While _Deep_Impact_ was a dramatic
treatment of a doomsday scenario, _Armageddon_ takes a gung-ho,
action-oriented approach.  Director Michael Bay (who appears fleetingly as
a NASA technician) wastes no time putting the special effects dollars to
work; before he hits the basic training lull, Bay treats the audience to a
curtain-raising space shuttle explosion and a spectacular meteor shower in
New York City.  With this different angle comes a pivotal change of
perspective, focusing on the outer space rescue mission as opposed to
_Impact_'s cross-section of Earth dwellers.  So, in essence, it can be said
that _Armageddon_, with its scrappy crew doing their best to "fight the
future," is a film about living, not dying, the ominous inevitability of
which was the Earth-centered _Impact_'s main issue.
Ultimately, the difference between _Armageddon_ and _Deep_Impact_ can be
boiled down to a fundamental one: male and female.  As
_Entertainment_Weekly_'s Lisa Schwarzbaum observed in her review, the
touchy-feely _Deep_Impact_ was a "woman's action movie"; _Armageddon_, from
notoriously testosterone-heavy producer Jerry Bruckheimer, is clearly one
for the guys.  In addition to all the full-throttle spectacle,
_Armageddon_, like all Bruckheimer films, barely has enough time for the
onscreen females.  Liv Tyler is prominently featured in the marketing
campaign, but her slim role is merely an amalgam of two cardboard female
stereotypes: rebellious daughter (to Harry) and devoted girlfriend (to
driller A.J. Frost, played by Ben Affleck).  There is one female on the
space crew, ballbusting co-pilot Watts (Jessica Steen), but, in typical
Bruckheimer fashion, she's literally shoved out of the way at a critical
moment.
So when _Armageddon_ picks up steam with the shuttle launch at about the
one-hour mark, it is momentum of the hard-driving, Hollywood action sort
that takes over, not the subtle, surprising poignance that _Deep_Impact_
eventually took on.  Bay, as shown in his previous two films (also
Bruckheimer productions), _Bad_Boys_ and _The_Rock_, is a crack action
director, and he successfully generates tension and excitement from
otherwise been-there, done-that situations such as the last-second
disarming of a ticking bomb (complete with, as Roger Ebert terms them, an
"RDR"--red digital display) and a narrow escape from an exploding complex.
All of the mayhem comes bathed in Bay's trademark, music-video-honed visual
razzle dazzle, heavy on the quick cuts and slow-mo moments, which keeps the
proceedings interesting.
_Armageddon_ is a sturdy popcorn extravaganza; if only Bay and the writing
crew of Jonathan Hensleigh, J.J. Abrams, Robert Roy Pool, Jonathan
Hensleigh, Tony Gilroy, and Shane Salerno were content to keep it that way.
 But, seeing they were telling a larger-than-life story (and perhaps swayed
by the estrogen of producer Gale Anne Hurd), they decided to go for
emotional content to match, with smaller-than-life results.  While there is
nothing here nearly as embarrassing as the laughably dreary "How Do I
Live?"-scored reunion between Nicolas Cage and family in _Con_Air_, the
general lack of subtlety in _Armageddon_ (and, for that matter, other
Bruckheimer productions) prevent the conclusion, which is to supposed to be
a profoundly moving, from completely convincing; the "human drama" comes
off every bit as calculated as the effects.
Although two films are quite different, in the end the question will
always be "Is _Armageddon_ better than _Deep_Impact_?"  For me, it's pretty
much a draw, but one that can be decided depending on what it is one wants
to see.  If it's drama, _Deep_Impact_; if it's action, _Armageddon_.  I'd
venture to guess that it's the latter quality most moviegoers would go for,
and, consequently, the box office answer to the question would be an
emphatic yes.

Title
Review for Supernova (2000)
_Supernova_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
        Now, the movie so bad, not even Alan Smithee wanted his name on it.  OK,
perhaps that's really not the case--"Thomas Lee" was the agreed-upon
pseudonym by director Walter Hill and MGM--but this long-delayed,
much-tinkered-with sci-fi film is the year's first unqualified disaster. 
Sometime in the future, the crew of a space paramedic vessel answers a
distress signal, picks up a mysterious stranger (Peter Facinelli), and,
as the poster says, "all hell breaks loose" over an even more mysterious
alien artifact the stranger brings along with him.
        Perhaps the original script lived up to the promise of the intriguing
premise because the film, as released, certainly doesn't.  In the midst
of the many re-edits the film underwent on the long road from shooting to
screen, all sense of coherence was lost.  For most of the running time,
it's hard to understand or care about what's going on, and some of the
ideas thought up in the 11th hour--such as the addition of a second
zero-gravity sex scene, with James Spader and Angela Bassett's heads
digitally attached to the bodies of the principals in the film's other
weightless shag, Facinelli and Robin Tunney--just add to the confusion. 
As lost as the audience gets, no one in the auditorium can come close to
the bewilderment exhibited by the cast.  Spader is somnambulently morose;
Bassett's earnest intensity seems ridiculously out of place for a piece
of cheese such as this; the bland Facinelli exhibits no air of menace
whatsoever; Lou Diamond Phillips, Wilson Cruz, and Robert Forster (who
receives third billing for a five-minute part) simply go through the
motions; and a clueless Tunney makes you wonder if she could possibly be
the same person who gave such a bravura turn in 1998's _Niagara_Niagara_.
 I would call _Supernova_ this  year's _Virus_, but that film was at
least laughable.  _Supernova_ just lies on the screen dead, boring as all
hell.

Title
Review for Boogie Nights (1997)
Aside from a fleeting glimpse of a sign reading "2nd Annual Adult Film
Awards," the trailer for Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights does not
offer a single clue of its porn-industry setting.  This might seem
misleading, but in skirting the provocative issue, the prudish preview
ironically gives a more accurate sketch of what this fascinating,
decade-spanning drama is truly about.
The adult film industry is front and center as the film opens in the San
Fernando Valley in 1977.  Anderson introduces the major players
GoodFellas-style with a single shot winding through a crowded discotheque:
producer/director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds); stars Amber Waves (Julianne
Moore), Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly), and
Rollergirl (Heather Graham); production manager Little Bill (William H.
Macy); and 17-year-old waiter Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), who catches the
attention of Jack.  Jack sees superstar potential in the fresh-faced Eddie,
and he is right--propelled by his large natural endowment and its ability
to perform on camera, Eddie becomes an overnight porn sensation under the
name of Dirk Diggler, sweeping the Adult Film Awards every year and
creating a popular franchise character in secret agent Brock Landers.
Tragic gunshots ring in the 1980s, and at this point Anderson uncovers
Boogie Nights's true nature.  As Dirk's fortunes take a slide and advent of
video changes the adult entertainment industry forever, the film reveals
itself as not a mere portrait of the porn business but above all else a
study of the people involved, the hopes and dreams within this makeshift
family.  For some, porn is just a means to a greater end: Buck dreams of
opening up his own stereo shop; Reed would rather be a full-time magician.
But a lot of the time, involvement in the business proves to be an
insurmountable and humbling obstacle, a large skeleton in the closets of
all involved.  While the porno setting hooks the viewer and remains as a
backdrop thoroughout, but it is the characters that carry the audience
through.
Ironically, though, the focal character is one of the least interesting.
Eddie/Dirk starts off as an ambitious, naive kid and becomes an ambitious,
naive, and egotistical man.  Wahlberg, who gives a very competent
performance, conveys the naivete and eventual arrogance well, but he needs
to work on his vulnerability; above all else, Eddie/Dirk is portrayed as a
dreamer, but I could not connect with the distant Wahlberg.  More engaging
emotionally and in every other way are Moore's Amber, the porn vet who
yearns to be a mother to her absent son; Cheadle's Buck, who prides himself
on being a real actor; and Graham's Rollergirl, a parentless high-school
dropout whose freewheeling ways hide deep anger and pain.  Reynolds should
be on his way to a real comeback with his confident, relaxed work as Jack,
the idealistic porn auteur who strives for some legitimacy.
Most of all, Boogie Nights is a showcase for 26-year-old
writer-director-producer Anderson, who proves himself a major talent to
watch with this, his second feature (following the acclaimed Reno
underworld saga Hard Eight). Not only does he effortlessly juggle a wide
canvas of characters and storylines, coax fine performances from his entire
cast, and employ some bravura camera work, he shows an amazing eye for
detail.  The tacky '70s hairstyles, costumes, and dance moves are so
dead-on as to be almost painful to watch.  Also hilarious are the porn
sequences; the wafer-thin premises, lame dialogue, flaccid line readings,
cheap production values, suggestive character names--all of the most minute
details are paid attention to.  Adding even more authenticity is the great
soundtrack filled with numerous '70s and '80s standards (though, curiously,
the title tune is nowhere to be heard).  Anderson's wry sense of humor
shows through in the most subtle of ways; title cards stating dates are
frequently posted onscreen, the last of which drolly reads "one last thing
(long way down)".
Boogie Nights rounds out its swift 152-minute running time with a scene
that is simple and quiet, yet deceptively so.  With the mere sight and
sound of one character talking to himself, Anderson sums up the joy and
optimism of dreamers everywhere, as well as the sadness that come with the
ultimate awareness of one's limits.  "You're a star," goes the film's final
line.  Truer words cannot be spoken about Paul Thomas Anderson.

Title
Review for Curdled (1996)
Curdled (R) ** (out of ****)
2 days in the Valley (R) ** (out of ****)
        Those looking for evidence that Quentin Tarantino is the most
influential filmmaker of the moment need look no further than not one, but
two recent releases, the macabre comedy Curdled and the ensemble
comedy-thriller 2 days in the Valley.  Pairing black humor with bloody
violence, both attempt to duplicate, to paraphrase the Coens' Barton Fink,
"that Tarantino feeling"... and come up short.
        Tarantino himself executive produced Reb Braddock's Curdled, based
on Braddock's short of the same name.  The film centers on Gabriela (Angela
Jones), a Miami woman who has a had a fixation on death since she was a
little girl in her native Colombia--she even keeps a scrapbook of newspaper
articles about murders, drawing depictions of the crimes next to each
article.  When she sees a TV ad recruiting people for a company that cleans
up after murder scenes, she knows she's found her calling and immediately
signs up.  Of course, her new job puts her into contact with danger, namely
one Paul Guell (William Baldwin), a.k.a. the Blue Blood Killer, who stabs
and beheads women from Miami's upper social echelon.  It also just so
happens that Paul's murder spree is Gabriela's latest morbid obsession.
        The plot is enough to sustain 28 minutes, which is how long the
original Curdled short lasted.  Stretched out to a little over 90, the
thinness of the premise is all too evident; a number of scenes and
characters feel like padding, and the movie doesn't kick into full gear
until the last act, when Gabriela and Paul finally meet.  And for a black
comedy, writers Braddock and John Maass are a little too heavy on the
"black" and too light on the "comedy."  While the entire package is amusing
and never boring (look out for the connections to From Dusk till Dawn), real
laughs are few and far-between; however, the film never skimps in terms of
blood, the letting and collection of it.  The wallowing in gore is more
sensational and exploitative than anything else, and it is bound to turn off
many a moviegoer.  I suppose Braddock was trying to get under people's skin,
but the subtler moments, like Gabriela's haunting
retrace-the-steps-of-the-murder-victim dance, are more disturbing and funny
than, say, the gruesome finale, which comes equipped with a joke that's more
cheesy than hilarious.
        The performances are a mixed bag.  Jones and her fascinating
character of Gabriela (of which she played a variation in Tarantino's Pulp
Fiction) are by far the best thing the film has going for it.  Gabriela is
an interesting paradox--a woman who  always wears dresses and speaks in
soft, accented, little girl tones but on the inside is far from an innocent.
Baldwin, on the other hand, picks up where he left off in the awful Fair
Game, relying on a single facial expression to convey certain
characteristics.  In Fair Game, Baldwin made his eyes bulge and gritted his
teeth to convey toughness; here, he constantly makes his upper lip curl to
signify evil.  Mel Gorham is quite good as Gabriela's all-business cleaning
partner, and MTV personality Daisy Fuentes makes her acting debut as another
co-worker, but her role is so minute that it's still not clear whether she
can really act or not.
        Strong performances are about all there is to second-time
writer-director John Herzfeld's 2 days in the Valley, an interesting but
none-too-funny ensemble piece.  Herzfeld's knotty scenario has a murder in
California's San Fernando Valley link ten diverse characters: an Olympic
skier (Teri Hatcher); a no-nonsense hitman (James Spader); his icy Swedish
girlfriend (Charlize Theron); a past-his-prime hitman (Danny Aiello) deathly
afraid of dogs; an effete British art dealer (Greg Cruttwell); his put-upon
assistant (Glenne Headly); his nurse half-sister (Marsha Mason); a has-been
TV director (Paul Mazursky); and two vice cops (Eric Stoltz and Jeff Daniels).
        Actually, I should say _nine_ characters, for Daniels's racist cop
disappears midway through the action and thus has really nothing to do with
anything.  Aside from his anomalous presence, Herzfeld does find interesting
and creative ways to link these characters.  But structure isn't everything
to a picture, especially not a comedy, and 2 days's slapstick farce is more
labored and silly than funny despite some high points (the vicious brawl
between Hatcher and Theron being the highest).  With his wide assortment of
oddball characters and flashes of violence, Herzfeld was obviously shooting
for a mix of Tarantino and Robert Altman--Pulp Fiction meets Short Cuts, to
use the popular comparison.  The film does come off as a Tarantino/Altman
hybrid, but it's more like Four Rooms meets Pret-a-Porter.
        So just what does the mediocrity of the Tarantino-inspired Curdled
and 2 days mean?  Quentin, get thee back behind the camera--quick.

Title
Review for Haunting, The (1999)
_The_Haunting_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
        I never thought I'd see the day when Lili Taylor would carry a
big-budget, big studio summer blockbuster wannabe.  But here she is, the
indie queen herself, playing the lead in $80-million-plus _The_Haunting_.
 One could be led to believe that Taylor's surprising involvement would
indicate a popcorn film that manages to blend the best of the worlds of
art and commerce.  Alas, this all-flash, no-substance--and no
_scare_--thriller is a textbook example of the soulless, money-burning
Hollywood hype products she had so valiantly rebelled against throughout
her entire career.  Hope you enjoyed cashing that paycheck, Miss Taylor.
        I suppose I could see why _The_Haunting_ attracted the attention of
talent such as Taylor and co-stars Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. 
It's an adaptation of Shirley Jackson's novel
_The_Haunting_of_Hill_House_, which had been memorably adapted to screen,
also under the title _The_Haunting_, by Robert Wise in 1963.  Also, the
man at the helm is Jan DeBont, who made his directorial debut with one of
the best and most exciting action thrillers of the decade, 1994's
_Speed_.
        However, _The_Haunting_ continues a disturbing trend that has been
evidenced in DeBont's work since _Speed_: an emphasis on effects and
pyrotechnics over story.  He was able to get by with this approach on the
utterly-brainless-but-fun _Twister_, but it did not serve him well on the
misbegotten _Speed_2:_Cruise_Control_ and is certainly the case here. 
Granted, the storyline of _The_Haunting_ does play like a countdown to
the inevitable grand effects sequences.  Eleanor (Taylor), Theo
(Zeta-Jones), and Luke (Owen Wilson) agree to stay in the large, isolated
old New England mansion named Hill House for an insomnia study conducted
by psychologist Dr. David Marrow (Neeson).  Dr. Marrow, of course, has a
hidden agenda--it is not insomnia but fear he is interested in, and the
creaky, creepy Hill House provides the perfect venue.  But he and his
three test subjects--especially the frightened but fascinated
Eleanor--get more than they bargained for when things do more than go
bump in the night.
        This is when the special effects kick in and the film should kick into
gear.  The physical effects of the living sets, the digital effects used
for the various ghosts, and the sound effects that lends every bump its
boom are of the highest technical order.  But all the polish can't gloss
over one cold, hard fact: none of what the effects bring to life is the
slightest bit scary.  The eye candy is especially enticing, but audiences
are more likely to be in awe of their visual splendor than scream in
fright.  With no jolts nor a sense of a haunting atmosphere, the lapses
in logic in rookie screenwriter David Self's hole-ridden script are made
all the more clear.
        As safe as this trip in a haunted house is, there was one moment during
_The_Haunting_ where many the screening audience did jump in their seats
(some even screamed).  Did it have anything to do with one of those
digital phantoms?  No.  The "living" set design?  No.  What caught
viewers so off guard was... a basic prop skeleton, no more special than
any one you can see in a typical B-movie.  Isn't it nice to know that
these big Hollywood budgets are being used so effectively?

Title
Review for Woo (1998)
The title of the comedy Woo is a lie.  Taking its name from its party girl
protagonist, this sporadically amusing lark seems less concerned with Woo
than the more oddball characters and situations circling her.
Woo roughly fits the bill of a romantic comedy, and this angle of the film
holds some promise.  Woo (Jada Pinkett Smith), a fiery, independent young
woman who is fixed up on a blind date with square paralegal Tim (Tommy
Davidson) by her cousin Claudette's (Paula Jai Parker) boyfriend Lenny
(Dave Chappelle).  The conflict between Woo's free-spirited, partying ways
and the conservatism of the "stuffy" Tim leads to one long, disaster- and
embarrassment-filled night for the both of them--but mostly for Tim, of
course.  In general, the comic complications moderately amuse, but some,
like a restaurant fire that Woo inadvertently causes, crash and burn (no
pun intended).  However, all of this remains watchable, thanks to the two
appealing leads.  They have a terrific rapport, and Davidson's hilariously
high-strung, put-upon straight man manages to upstage the sexy spunk of
Pinkett Smith, who never looks less than gorgeous throughout the entire film.
If writer David C. Johnson and Daisy v.S. Mayer had stuck with Woo and Tim
exclusively, the film wouldn't have been great, but it would have been
better than the often meandering movie the complete Woo is.  Too often the
film becomes sidetracked by the more eccentric peripheral players, such as
Claudette, Lenny, and Tim's trio of obnoxious buddies, Frankie (Duane
Martin), Romaine (Michael Ralph), and Hop (Darrel Heath).  Claudette and
Lenny are given a raucous, raunchy showcase scene that is worth a few
laughs, but they disappear completely after that, making its necessity
questionable.  Frankie, Romaine, and Hop are funny at first, but their
broadly boorish antics grow old long before they  are shown on a side trip
at a drag club.  Completely out of place is an earnest, barely developed
subplot involving Woo's strained relationship with her brother (Dartanyan
Edmonds).  It's quite telling that the two most memorable supporting
characters only appear in one scene each: Darryl (LL Cool J), Tim's slick
ladies' man neighbor; and Crayola (Nicci Gilbert), a gossipy police
department desk clerk with an attitude problem.
Adding to Woo's problems is its jarringly abrupt ending.  Although I did
not particularly care for the film as a whole, I would not have minded the
additional 20 minutes or so dealing that the ending point suggests; it
would have given Woo and Tim's relationship a more satisfying and
well-rounded closure.  But perhaps that would not have been a problem if
the entire film had focused entirely on the central couple, which would
have made Woo a more satisfying and well-rounded movie.

Title
Review for Dance with Me (1998)
_Dance_with_Me_ (PG) ** (out of ****)
_Dance_with_Me_'s original title was _Shut_Up_and_Dance_, and that
confrontational moniker would have been a more apt name for this dance
musical.  But it's not because the film in question is in-your-face
exuberant; rather, "Shut up and dance!" is likely what audience will be
saying to the characters of this draggy romantic drama that is too heavy on
talk and too light on fancy footwork.
Granted, the dancing that _is_ featured is quite impressive.  The central
location of _Dance_with_Me_ is a Houston dance studio, and one of its
featured instructors is Ruby (Vanessa L. Williams), a former professional
Latin dance champion determined to recapture her former glory.  Also
working at the studio, but as a handyman, is fresh-from-Cuba Rafael Infante
(Chayanne), an untrained but equally skilled dancer himself.  The slightly
cool Ruby and the fiery Rafael (and, for that matter, Williams and
Chayanne) strike immediate sparks, but these two opposites truly ignite
when they dance together, generating a palpable sexual tension and
electricity with their sizzling salsa steps, nimbly choreographed by Daryl
Matthews and Liz Curtis.
Matthews also wrote the screenplay, and, frankly, he is overextended.
While the pas de deux between Ruby and Rafael is an engaging enough core,
the pro forma plot elements surrounding it are tedious filler.  Rafael
comes to America to meet the father he never knew, John Burnett (Kris
Kristofferson), who owns the dance studio, which, in turn, is struggling to
stay afloat.  Ruby, who has never stayed in one place long enough to have a
"home," is not eager to put down roots, geographically or emotionally.
Meanwhile, a big dance competition in Vegas looms in the immediate future.
Ironically, Matthews, a former professional dancer himself, piles on these
familiar, trite subplots so heavily that they far outweigh the dancing in
terms of screen time.
Fortunately for Matthews and director Randa Haines, in Williams they have
a star who capably handles both the dance and dramatic chores.  Though her
character's baggage is strictly by the book, Williams is able to breathe
some depth into Ruby, especially in one climactic dance where her eyes
speak volumes of feeling.  As it is widely known, Williams also has vocal
chops to match, and her wide-ranging talents would make her an ideal star
for a lavish Hollywood screen musical (that is, should a studio ever be
game enough to mount one).  The jury, however, is still out on her co-star,
Chayanne, who is a major music star in Latin America.  He certainly can
move well on the dance floor, but he is rather stiff everywhere else,
likely due to unease with the English language.  Haines tries to hide
Chayanne's unease by making him flash his megawatt smile every other
second, but no amount of smiling can bail you out of a film as surprisingly
talk-heavy as this.
In the press notes, producer Lauren C. Weissman says, "What initially
attracted me to this script was the human drama."  Ironically, the
attraction for Weissman is exactly what will keep most audiences _away_
from _Dance_with_Me_, a film that falls short as a dance extravaganza, and,
for that matter, as a "human drama."  (opens August 21)

Title
Review for Basket, The (1999)
Clean, proper, and brimming with good intentions, _The_Basket_ is one of
those films that people say "aren't made anymore."  That comment is only
partially true.  Films like _The_Basket_ indeed aren't made anymore--for
the big screen, at least, for this type of maudlin, medicinal family film
is a dime a dozen on the tube, where it belongs.
The title _The_Basket_ has a number of meanings.  First, it is the title
of a (fictional) German opera that newly-arrived schoolteacher Martin
Conlon (Peter Coyote) presents to his students in a small Washington
town, circa 1918.  The opera's twisting, mystical story soon captures the
imaginations of everyone in town, its plot developments being discussed
and dissected much like those of a modern day soap.  Second, it is a
reference to the other new thing that Conlon brings to the youth: the
game of basketball.
The round ball especially captures the interest of young Helmut Brink
(Robert Karl Burke).  Helmut and his older sister Brigitte (Amber
Willenborg) are orphaned German refugees, and with WWI raging--and one of
the local boys having returned from the warfront severely injured--the
two face prejudice from all around.  The anti-German sentiment also
extends to Conlon for teaching a work originating from America's enemy.
That already is enough plot for a feature film, but like an overstuffed
afterschool special that wants to be all things, _The_Basket_ doesn't
know where to quit.  Writers Rich Cowan (who also directed), Don Caron,
Frank Swoboda, and Tessa Swoboda throw in a "forbidden romance" between
Brigitte and a brother of the injured soldier, an intrigue subplot
involving Conlon's down-low dealings with shady characters, and a "big
game" sequence where Helmut gets his shot at hoops glory.  The obvious
intent is to give each character on the large canvas a chance to shine,
but the individual elements are undercooked on their own terms, yielding
less-than-satisfying payoffs.
The performances also don't feel quite formed.  Coyote is likable but
hampered by a strange accent.  Less strange but more distracting are the
German accents of Burke and Willenborg, which are just as awkward as
their overall performances.  Karen Allen, as the mother of the soldier,
makes the most significant impression, but her role is only a few lines
away from being a mere walk-on.
There's no denying that _The_Basket_ will foster warm feelings in its
audience; it's a nice film that addresses worthy subjects and does so in
a manner accessible to the entire family.  But in a time where "nice" is
often equated with "boring," the undistinctive, earnestly good-for-you
_The_Basket_ does nothing to alter that perception.

Title
Review for Simple Plan, A (1998)
_A_Simple_Plan_ (R) ****
_Very_Bad_Things_ (R) ****
        _A_Simple_Plan_ and _Very_Bad_Things_ are films of two opposing
genres--drama and comedy--but both are actually so similar that their
titles could very well be interchangeable.  Both are about botched secret
schemes that lead to downward spirals of transgression; both are bound to
leave audiences unsettled--and both are among the most memorable films of
the year.
        Although his filmmaking career has spanned twenty years, Sam Raimi has
always remained on the fringes of Hollywood, scoring no big box office hits
but amassing a fiercely devoted cult following and with his trademark brand
of dark humor (more often than not tinged with gore) and wildly kinetic
camera work.  More than a few Raimi cultists weaned on the likes of his
_Evil_Dead_ trilogy will undoubtedly cry "sellout" after seeing
_A_Simple_Plan_, which neither looks nor feels like a traditional Raimi
film.  Instead, it looks and feels like  a simply "traditional" film: no
flashy camera work, no excessive violence, no macabre humor.
        Thematically, on the other hand, this adaptation of Scott B. Smith's
bestselling novel is exactly what one would expect from the auteur.  Bill
Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton play Midwestern brothers Hank and Jacob
Mitchell, who, with friend Lou (Brent Briscoe), discover a downed plane
containing a dead body and a bag full of money--$4.4 million, to be exact.
Their plan, as the title states, is simple: split the money between them,
but only after the plane is discovered and it is determined that the
authorities are not tracing the cash.
        As they say, "the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry," and
that's exactly what happens.  As jealousy, greed, and suspicion enter the
picture, a tense and ever-twisting turn of events follows, in which the
most innocent characters reveal their more sinister tendencies--and vice
versa.  This theme of the ever-shifting tides of evil within people is a
perfect fit for the dark sensibilities of Raimi, and he made a wise
decision in keeping his showy visual tendencies in check.  Any of Raimi's
usual visual theatrics would have detracted from Smith's tightly-wound
script, and his restrained approach intensifies the suspense of the story.
        Adding to the complexity and power of the story are the actors, whose
multidimensional performances create complex characters the audience
sometimes hates yet maintains a certain empathy for.  Thornton is likely to
receive the most attention for his heartwrenching turn as the sad sack
Jacob, who may be slow-witted but is nobody's fool.  Equally as impressive
though certain to be overlooked in Thornton's shadow is Paxton's subtle,
slow burn as the often-conflicted Hank.  Bridget Fonda's role as Hank's
wife Sarah seems simple at the start, but as the character gradually takes
on sharper edges, so does Fonda's performance.  The film's richness of
character lends its  conclusion a poignant and haunting impact.
        As badly as the characters in _A_Simple_Plan_ behave, nothing they do
comes off quite as reprehensible as the deeds perpetrated by the characters
inhabiting _Very_Bad_Things_, the audacious writing/directing debut of
actor Peter Berg.  Stuffed with scenes of stylishly shot splatter, this
film is as violent as any that has been released as this or any year--and
it's all played for _laughs_ (coincidentally, much like Raimi's earlier
work).  That shameless, eager-to-shock energy, with a crafty script and a
flawless ensemble cast to match, make this beyond-black comedy a very good
thing indeed. 
        A few days before his wedding to Laura Garrity (Cameron Diaz), Kyle Fisher
(Jon Favreau) heads to Las Vegas for a big bachelor blowout with his
buddies: self-improvement-obsessed realtor Robert Boyd (Christian Slater),
quiet auto mechanic Charles Moore (Leland Orser), straightlaced family man
Adam Berkow (Daniel Stern), and Adam's boorish younger brother Michael
(Jeremy Piven).  Mix these five men, gallons of booze, pounds of cocaine
and marijuana, and a stripper into a hotel room and something bad is bound
to happen--and it does.  A rather grisly "complication" during sex with
Michael leaves the stripper dead, and the ever-cunning Boyd comes up with,
yes, a simple plan to correct, as he calls it, the "105-pound
problem"--bury her body in the desert.
        Predictably, this rash decision just leads to more trouble.  What isn't so
predictable, however, is the severity of the troubling situations Berg puts
his characters in.  These developments will undoubtedly offend some, but
most people would be laughing too hard to be offended.  An obvious
comparison would be to the Farrelly Brothers' surprise sensation
_There's_Something_About_Mary_, but the brands of humor are distinctly
different; whereas the Farrellys dabbled in "gross-out" bodily function
humor, Berg's violent variety of comedy can best be described as "shock"
humor.  But however different their specific sensibilities are, the
Farrellys and Berg share the same go-for-broke attitude when it comes to
generating laughs, going so far as to seem to dare the audience not to
laugh.  "Shock" gags would not mean anything if they didn't organically
emerge from the story, and like _Mary_, the very bad things of the title
are firmly rooted in the script.
        But there's more to Berg's assured writing than his ability to jolt the
audience into laughter; there are also some juicy roles, and each cast
member tackles their respective job with aplomb.  The characters truly take
shape, and the actors achieve liftoff, after the stripper incident, when
everyone experiences different types of emotional fallout.  The fact that
Kyle's increasing anxiety can be palpably felt while not exactly seen is a
tribute to Favreau's firm grasp of the character, who tries to maintain a
veneer of composure throughout.  Adam becomes mad with paranoia, leading to
some effectively hammy hysterics by Stern.  Nicely playing off of him is
Piven, whose all-attitude Michael undergoes the most dramatic arc in the
film.  Slater's often irksome Nicholson-channelling works like a charm for
Boyd.   As his self-improvement philosophy becomes increasingly, shall we
say, dark, Slater's devilish Jack-like grin and swagger could not be more
perfect; it's his best performance since _True_Romance_.  As the wedding
date nears and the tension mounts, the chirpy Laura seems less like
herself--or is that _more_?--and Diaz obviously has a blast.  Even a
relatively peripheral player like Adam's wife Lois (Jeanne Tripplehorn)
takes on greater depth as things get more and more horrifying; only Orser's
barely-heard Moore remains an enigma, but I believe that was the point.
Berg falls a little short at the end; his ultimate resolution doesn't quite
live up to the raucous build up, but it closes the film with an
appropriately acidic sting.  (_A_Simple_Plan_ opens December 4;
_Very_Bad_Things_ opens November 25)

Title
Review for Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)
_Gone_in_Sixty_Seconds_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Given the presence of Angelina Jolie--and how prominent her presence is
in the film's advertising campaign--one would be led to believe that
_Gone_in_Sixty_Seconds_ is the first Jerry Bruckheimer-produced actioner
with a strong female presence.  With Jolie, a wild child who is just as
ballsy, if not more, than any male counterpart, Bruckheimer has a female
star that he could run with.  If only he could see it that way.
No, not even the force of nature that is Angelina can combat the rampant
testosterone in _Sixty_, a reworking of the 1974 film of the same name. 
But that is but one way the film is typical Bruckheimer.  There are all
the glossy visuals and stylish cutting; there are the awkwardly forced
moments of "emotion"; there is a pumped-up soundtrack scoring accordingly
amped-up action scenes; there is a talented cast that is wildly
overqualified to do this type of popcorn fodder.  This time around,
however, the surface thrills that it does deliver aren't quite enough.
Nicolas Cage stars as Randall "Memphis" Raines, a reformed car thief who
is forced back into action when his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi)
runs afoul of the evil car thief Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston).
 In order to spare Kip's life, Memphis must steal 50 cars within 72
hours.
Of course, Memphis and his crew don't strike until the the last night,
so we can have the familiar race against time finale.  As such,
_Gone_in_Sixty_Seconds_ doesn't start to deliver the anticipated action
until well into the third act.  While director Dominic Sena ably shoots
and stages it with all the heavy style that one associates with a
Bruckheimer production, the climactic car chase cannot erase the memory
of the draggy and often tedious two acts that precede the mayhem.
The audience's interest is supposed to be held by two things during the
film's first acts.  First is the obligatory group of eccentric supporting
players.  Among Memphis' partners in grand theft auto are mentor Otto
(Robert Duvall); former partner Atley (Will Patton); wisecracking buddy
Donny (Chi McBride); silent muscleman the Sphinx (Vinnie Jones); ex-flame
Sara, a.k.a. "Sway" (Jolie, in an absolute throwaway of a role); and
Kip's gang of young techies and lunkheads (Scott Caan, James Duval, TJ
Cross, and William Lee Scott).  This is indeed a quirky bunch, but not
necessarily a colorful one.  Aside from McBride (who has some good
lines), Duvall (still a commanding presence), and Jolie (alluring eye
candy), the group is uninteresting at best and annoying at worst.
Second, one is supposed to be engaged by the purported emotional
connections between the characters.  Kip only wants to be accepted and
respected by his brother; Memphis wants to prove to Sway that his leaving
her was for the best.  But anyone who's seen a Bruckheimer knows that
pyrotechnics are his strong suit, not quiet moments--and when they do
come, they are laughably heavy-handed and jarring (witness, for example,
the conclusions of _Con_Air_ and _Armageddon_).  Sena and writer Scott
Rosenberg don't do anything to change that track record; if possible,
he's managed to carve a new low with the jaw-droppingly maudlin final
encounter between Memphis and the cop (Delroy Lindo, great even in this
ridiculous context) who's chasing him.
Somehow, however, I get the feeling that real problems such as these
will be lost on the casual viewer.  The screening I attended was
sweetened with non-press people, and I overheard many of them raving
about the film afterward; one even said, "I haven't been this entertained
by a film in a long time."  Either that guy doesn't get out much, or
(more likely) _Gone_in_Sixty_Seconds_ will be another summer success for
Bruckheimer--actual quality be damned.

Title
Review for Winterschläfer (1997)
_Winter_Sleepers_(Winterschläfer)_ *** (out of ****)
The poster blares "from the director of _Run_Lola_Run_," but anyone
looking specifically for such an adrenaline rush would be advised to stay
away.  There are smatterings of director Tom Tykwer's flashy _Lola_ style
in this slow, two-hour-plus drama: the pulsing techno score; some
bravura, highly kinetic shots.  For the most part, though, this is a film
not about forward momentum but stagnant meditation.  _Winter_Sleepers_,
which predates _Lola_ by a year, is one of those "people intersected by
chance" films, but its less-than-sprawling canvas of five
characters--three of whom are already linked as the film opens--and
snow-drenched, resort town setting should give one an idea of how plot
comes secondary to atmosphere.  In fact, one of the threads is  rather
mundane: a translator named Rebecca (Floriane Daniel) is involved with
ski instructor Marco (Heino Ferch), a womanizer.  Despite some good
performances, this familiar bit of business is a little tedious, and it
predictably does not stop 'til one of them wises up.
Far more involving are the other two storylines.  Rebecca's housemate
Laura (Marie-Lou Sellem), a nurse and aspiring actress, falls into a
quiet relationship with René (Ulrich Matthes), a movie projectionist. 
Laura doesn't know that he is tragically linked to a farmer named Theo
(Josef Bierbichler) and his dying young daughter, whom Laura cares for at
the hospital.  Then again, neither is René aware of any connection, for a
years-ago injury has done irreparable damage to his short-term memory; to
compensate, he constantly takes photographs of his surroundings.  The
Laura/René and René/Theo threads don't resolve themselves in an easily
predictable fashion, which is why they make a more lasting impression
than Rebecca/Marco.  Actually, if it weren't for them, _Winter_Sleepers_
would've been a picturesque and well-acted near-miss instead of the
unconventionally affecting film that it is.

Title
Review for Eye of the Beholder (1999)
        Beauty may be in the _Eye_of_the_Beholder_, but a dud is a dud,
regardless of the perspective.  And this long-delayed thriller (it bears
a telling 1998 copyright) is unmistakably such a failure, rendered even
more disappointing by the level of talent aboard and the amount of
promise evident in its earliest stages.
        A wan Ewan McGregor portrays the nameless "Eye," a British intelligence
agent who becomes dangerously attracted to an alluring young woman named
Joanna Eris (Ashley Judd, looking great and dong nothing more) who also
happens to be a vicious serial killer of men.  Make that "obsessed," for
soon the Eye leaves behind genuine surveillance missions in favor of
watching the fetching femme fatale 24-7, shadowing her every move.  He
does not so much want to have Joanna as he wants to "keep" her--he not
only watches her, he looks after her, in a sense protecting her as a
perverse type of guardian angel.
        Writer-director Stephan Elliott, working from the basis of Marc Behm's
novel of the same name, has a hypnotic visual style that serves the dark
atmosphere of obsession well, particularly in the opening stages.  The
tricks, such slow motion and complex dissolves, have a sensual quality
that give the film an enticing erotic kick.  One scene where the Eye
caresses a wall that separates him and a bathing Joanna has a subdued but
no less electric sexuality.
        What ultimately fails Elliott is his writing.  After establishing the
voyeuristic premise, the film gradually unravels and makes less and less
sense.  Much of this has to do with Elliott's need to make Joanna more
than a chic murderess; he wants to make her a wounded soul with
deep-seated psychological reasons for her psychosis.  Not a bad idea, but
when the reasons are so murky as to make very little sense, it makes for
a source of needless confusion.  Elliott is a little more successful on
the Eye's end; suffering from the loss of his wife and especially his
daughter, he has a recurring hallucination of his daughter (played by
twins Ann-Marie and Kaitlin Brown), but this conceit is dropped without
explanation somewhere along the line.
        The supporting characters get even worse treatment.  Genevičve Bujold
plays Joanna's former mentor, who figures into the muddled explanation of
Joanna's behavior, meaning her character doesn't make that much sense,
either.  Patrick Bergin is dull as a wealthy blind vintner to whom Joanna
attaches herself; I'm not so sure if we're meant to think that she truly
falls for him or not, for there is little in the way of writing or
chemistry to shed any added light.  A dirty and bleached-blond Jason
Priestley wanders in from a different movie as a violent drifter; and the
no-frills role of Hilary, the Eye's sole contact to the outside world, is
done in by an awkward performance by k.d. lang.
        But nothing in _Eye_of_the_Beholder_ is so awkward as the film becomes
as the Eye follows Joanna all across the country, collecting snow globes
in each city and watching, watching, and watching.  Although very little,
if any, tension and suspense is built, all the waiting and watching makes
one anticipate some type of a payoff, but there isn't one; there isn't
really an ending, per se, so much as a stoppage.  Perhaps Elliott was
trying to make a point about the futility of voyeurism, and if that's the
case, it backfires, for it brings to light how much of a waste watching
_Eye_of_the_Beholder_ is.
        For some real voyeuristic thrills, one cannot do better than Universal's
sparkling remaster of Alfred Hitchcock's timeless (that is, aside from
the dated, soundstagey production design) 1954 classic _Rear_Window_. 
The sharp Technicolor hues really place the audience behind the eyes of
wheelchair-bound L.B. "Jeff" Jefferies (James Stewart), whose interest in
watching his neighbors becomes dangerous when he suspects one of murder. 
The enhanced colors also make Grace Kelly, who plays Jeff's jet-setting
girlfriend, even more stunning.  But even if the print were as muddy as
it had been before the painstaking restoration, this would still be a
first-rate thriller, suspenseful, creepy, and wittily written (by John
Michael Hayes), featuring fine performances by the entire cast.  That the
film looks as spectacular as it does (though, I must say, not quite as
spectacular as the 1996 restoration of Hitchcock's _Vertigo_, which, in
addition to a visual refurbish, was given a crystalline DTS soundtrack)
is just an added treat.

Title
Review for Psycho (1998)
Of all the talk leading up to the release of Gus Van Sant's update of
Alfred Hitchcock's _Psycho_, none was quite so intriguing as a rumor that
began circulating a few months ago.  This bit of gossip stated that instead
of being a complete shot-by-shot "recreation" as announced, the new film
would only be a duplicate until an hour in, at which point it would veer
into a completely original direction.  At about the one-hour point, there
arose a split-second moment where it looked like the rumor could be true:
motel keeper Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn) nearly opens a folded-up
newspaper.  (Anyone who has seen the original would know the significance.)
 Alas, he only _nearly_ opens it, and this _Psycho_ is exactly what Van
Sant promised (threatened?), a virtually shot-by-shot, line-for-line copy
of the seminal 1960 chiller.  And, as everyone knows, copies never come out
nearly as sharp as the original.
Ironically enough, the copy-then-diverge strategy probably would have been
more in line with Hitchcock's original sensibility; after all, his film was
a big bait-and-switch (or, rather, "Bates-and-switch").  What begins as a
yarn about a larcenous lady on the lam (Marion Crane, here played by Anne
Heche) suddenly switches gears midway through, shifting its focus to the
mysterious Bates, a hermit whose entire life centers around his invalid
mother.  When Marion and the money she stole from her employer disappears
without a trace, her lover Sam Loomis (here played by Viggo Mortensen) and
sister Lila's (here played by Julianne Moore) search leads them to the
nearly-deserted Bates Motel.
Everything in the new film plays exactly as it did in the film from nearly
40 years ago, with a few contemporary wrinkles thrown in by Van Sant and
Joseph Stephano, scripter of the original.  The $40,000 that Janet Leigh's
Marion stole has been upped to $400,000.  Vera Miles's prissy Lila has
become Moore's Walkman-wearing, ball-busting tough chick.  John Gavin's
pompously stuffy Sam has become Mortensen's roughneck cowboy.   Norman now
masturbates while spying on Marion in the bathroom.  And in a truly bizarre
move, Van Sant delves into Oliver Stone's bag of tricks, arbitrarily
slipping in subliminal shots of storm clouds and deer (among other things)
during the murder scenes.  (Also worth mentioning is a brief shot of a bus
stop Marion drives by--featuring a poster for _Six_Days,_Seven_Nights_,
Heche's romantic comedy from this past summer.  Given Van Sant's otherwise
obsessive determination in re-creating the feel of the original, hopefully
that distracting in-joke was unintentional.)
With the original updated yet completely intact, from the story to the
music (Bernard Herrmann's famously chilling score has been adapted by Danny
Elfman) to the opening titles (adapted by Pablo Ferro from the legendary
Saul Bass's original design), it's easy to see how Universal and Van Sant
thought this experiment could work.  But a crucial fact about the original
film is lost on them: while rightfully regarded as a classic, when seen in
this day and age, _Psycho_ works best only when its original historical
context is in mind--that is, as a film emerging from the year 1960.  There
are more than a few things in the original that comes off as dated when
seen through contemporary eyes: the deliberate pacing, the low body count,
and, most infamously, the horrible "this is why it all happened" closing
expository speech delivered by a psychiatrist (here played by Robert
Forster).  Having all of this distinctly '60s material played out by '90s
performers in living color makes for a film that feels jarringly
anachronistic; those modern wrinkles just accentuate the time era conflicts.
What isn't so confused, however, is the troupe of actors--for the most
part, that is.  Heche and William H. Macy (as private investigator
Arbogast) are especially effective.  (However, it must be noted that
perhaps Heche's most memorable contribution to the role, as good as she is
actingwise, is wearing a truly hideous straight-from-the-thrift-shop
wardrobe that the original's Janet Leigh wouldn't be caught dead in.)  The
big shortcoming is the cast, though, is Vaughn.  He is a terrific actor,
and, technically speaking, he delivers a decent performance.  But there is
something inherently wrong about his casting as Norman; a lot of his appeal
and effectiveness on-screen comes from the natural, almost subconscious
self-confidence he exudes, which does not fit the awkward, socially inept
Norman at all.  Granted, this is Vaughn's most muted performance to date,
but the creepy ambiguity of Anthony Perkins is nowhere in sight;
consequently, there is no suspense leading to, nor any surprise coming
with, the climactic twist, even if one has not seen the original.
All comparisons to any other films aside, the measure of a thriller is its
suspense and scariness factor, and, on its own terms, Van Sant's _Psycho_
is a suspiciously average undertaking--watchable, competent on technical
terms, yet strangely safe.  _Psycho_ '98 doesn't ruin anyone's memory of
the original; in fact, it only makes one appreciate that film more--which,
ironically, appears to have been the point that Van Sant has been accused
of not having.

Title
Review for Universal Soldier: The Return (1999)
_Universal_Soldier:_The_Return_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
When one goes to a Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie, one doesn't
expect certain things they would from a typical film--for example, decent
acting, a strong storyline, interesting characters.  True to Van Damme
form, _Universal_Soldier:_The_Return_ boasts none of these qualities. 
The problem is, neither does it possess the one thing for which one would
watch a Van Damme vehicle in the first place: excitement.
_The_Return_ is, as can be gleaned by its title, the third sequel (the
Van Damme-less numbers 2 and 3 went straight to cable) to the Muscles
from Brussels's 1992 sci-fi thriller, created by overpaid uberhacks
Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin.  That film was far from a
masterpiece--in fact, it was quite bad--but it did have its share of
diverting moments, not to mention a casting gimmick that proved to be the
film's biggest drawing card: pit against Van Damme as the baddie was
another lower-tier action star, Dolph Lundgren.
With Lundgren's character having been fed into a wood chipper at the end
of the first film, there really is no novelty left for _The_Return_.  All
that remains are the formica acting and still-below-average English
skills of Van Damme and the plot concept of having dead soldiers
reanimated into invincible supersoldiers.  The nothing plotline cooked up
by _The_Return_'s "writers" (I won't dignify their "work" by mentioning
their names) has the computer in charge of a new advanced brand of
UniSols, SETH (eventually played in human form by Michael Jai White, a
charismatic actor who at one point seemed to have a promising career),
going berserk and hence making his UniSols go on a killing spree.  The
only one who can stop them of course, is Van Damme's Luc Deveraux, one of
the original UniSols.
There is plenty of mayhem in _The_Return_; the film begins with an
extended jetski/boat chase, and numerous fights and shootouts follow. 
Sounds interesting, and, if anything all the wild goings-on keep the
viewer awake.  But since they are so conventionally, matter-of-factly
shot and staged by director Mic Rodgers, none of it was particularly
exciting; one generic set piece comes after another, ultimately blurring
into one unmemorable whole by the end of the film.
Perhaps Rodgers thought the mere presence of Van Damme would compensate,
or that of one of his co-stars--Bill Goldberg, of World Championship
Wrestling fame, who plays the evil Romeo.  While not at the level of
Lundgren's casting in the original, seeing Goldberg on the big screen
does hold some curious interest.  At least, that is, until it becomes
painfully (if unsurprisingly) evident that Goldberg can't act a lick, and
his one showcase scene, where he rips off his shirt for no apparent
reason and dispatches some foes using some wrestling maneuvers, just
makes his presence in the film even more ludicrous.
Van Damme has expressed his interest in making a break from the hard
action scene and going into more classy thriller territory, ŕ la
_The_Thomas_Crown_Affair_.  It's a ridiculous idea, but from Van Damme's
standpoint, it's understandable.  With the complete failure of
_Universal_Soldier:_The_Return_, it's obvious that the action route is
keeping him stranded in his career cul-de-sac, and he'd be stupid _not_
to look for an alternate way out.

Title
Review for Jackie Brown (1997)
Three years and numerous talk show appearances, acting gigs, and media
potshots after the release of his landmark Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino
has finally directed a full-length follow-up, Jackie Brown.  But those
expecting the blood-drenched, trigger-happy Tarantino of old are in for a
surprise--his adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel Rum Punch is a more
mature, only moderately violent, and a most unexpectedly romantic and
moving caper comedy/drama.
OK, I know what you're thinking--a good review from me is just about
guaranteed for Tarantino, right?  No.  I walked into the screening with my
expectations dramatically diminished, partially based on some early
positive-but-not-great notices and the virtual lack of buzz attached to the
finished project.  My expectations were neither boosted nor diminished
further by the amusingly kitschy, retro-'70s opening credit roll, with Pam
Grier's title character moving on one of those airport conveyor belt
walkways, the hard-driving soul of Bobby Womack's "Across 110th Street"
blaring on the soundtrack, and the appearance of a copyright notice under
the film's title card.
Jackie is a 44-year-old, down-on-her-luck flight attendant for Cabo Air
who also works as a money courier for arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L.
Jackson).  When the Feds, led by ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton),
catch onto her extracurricular activities (without knowing exactly whom she
works for), Jackie devises a complex scheme to rob Ordell of
$500,000--_and_ stay in the good graces of law enforcement, whom she pits
against Ordell.  Figuring into her plan is her bail bondsman, burnt-out
50-something Max Cherry (Robert Forster).
Leonard's basic storyline is pretty standard, but Tarantino tells it in a
straightforward fashion, but not without a certain amount of his unique
panache, albeit slightly altered in some respects.  Predictably, his
dialogue has great snap, but while there are the trademark pop culture
references, they are noticeably in shorter supply--a wise move, so the
speech never distracts from the twisting plot.  His penchant for nonlinear
storytelling shines in a brilliantly handled climactic money exchange
sequence, told three times over, each from the perspective of a different
character; however, that sequence is an exception, for the rest of the way
he uncharacteristically follows the story linearly.  Naturally, this being
a Tarantino film, there is also violence, but, oddly enough, these
incidents are depicted with a minimum amount of bloodshed.  These instances
still shock, though, mostly because the actual depiction of violence is
surprisingly sporadic; there is always the mere threat of it hanging in the
air, and Tarantino milks that threat for maximum tension.
But what makes Jackie Brown so surprising is its (gasp) heart.  For all
the caper antics and profanity, the film essentially boils down to an
earnest love story between Jackie and Max.  At first the romantic angle
plays less like a genuine angle than a joke; when Max becomes enamored of
her at first sight as Bloodstone's classic "Natural High" plays in the
background, it is hard not to snicker.  Also pretty comical is how Max goes
to Sam Goody and buys himself a tape of the Delfonics' "Didn't I Blow Your
Mind This Time" (which becomes the de facto recurrent "love theme") after
first hearing it at Jackie's apartment; he then plays it in his car and
lipsyncs along.  But the underlying romantic nature of their
relationship--which is played out as a mere business alliance--is so
skillfully and subtly developed that I was taken aback by how much I felt
for the pair by the film's close.
Jackie and Max's likability onscreen owes a great debt to the actors who
play them.  As proven by his resurrection of John Travolta in Pulp Fiction,
Tarantino has a great eye for forgotten talent, and he has once again hit
the jackpot with Grier and Forster, who should be Oscar contenders next
year.  Former '70s blaxploitation queen Grier is an immensely appealing
performer; not only is she blessed with a natural beauty and sexiness, she
is able to project a sympathetic vulnerability even when violently showing
everyone who's boss.  Forster, who has long toiled in anonymity in films
such as Original Gangstas (which, as it happens, also starred Grier), is
more than up to the tough task of suggesting Max's love for Jackie without
clearly spelling out his true intentions.  As is the case with Tarantino's
previous efforts, the rest of the ensemble is also solid.  Jackson is his
usual first-rate self, and Robert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda  develop an
irreverent comic chemistry as Ordell's dim loser sidekick, Louis Gara, and
Ordell's beach bunny stoner girlfriend, Melanie Ralston, respectively.
Jackie Brown is not a complete return to Pulp Fiction form for Tarantino;
though the film is consistently engrossing, at 155 minutes, it is overlong
by at least 20 minutes, and the unspectacular climax is quite
disappointing, especially when compared to the terrific money exchange
sequence.  Nonetheless, the very well done Jackie Brown marks the welcome
return of the filmmaker who revolutionized independent cinema.

Title
Review for Wild Things (1998)
Aaron Spelling meets Joe Eszterhas!  Not exactly words of praise, but they
are in reference to John McNaughton's erotic thriller Wild Things, which
shamelessly melds the best of both trashy worlds with a most welcome sense
of humor.
The Wild Things of the title are two high school girls that could have
come straight from a Spelling soap: snotty, upper crust Kelly Van Ryan
(Denise Richards) and punky Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell), the average girl
from the wrong side of the tracks.  These two opposites are united when
they both cry rape at the hands of school guidance counselor Sam Lombardo
(Matt Dillon), who has a reputation for being a womanizer.  These sordid
charges set off a chain of bewildering, ever-twisting chain of events that
come to entangle a surprisingly varied cross-section of Blue Bay, Florida's
population.
Wild Things wouldn't be an erotic thriller without sex, and McNaughton and
Peters pull off some of the most heated doozies this side of Joe Eszterhas.
 Most notorious of these scenes is a steamy menage a trois; on paper it
would appear to be a shock tactic on the Eszterhas level, but the act plays
an important role within the context of the story.  The actor whose role
shoulders most of the sexiness duties is Richards, and she proves to be a
smoldering carnal presence, whether merely coming out of a pool or standing
still in dripping wet clothing.  Too bad she can't act worth a damn,
proving that her painfully inept work in Starship Troopers was no fluke.
The assembled media in the audience could not control their laughter during
a straight-faced crying scene (think Elizabeth Berkley, but with tears),
nor could they hold it in as a stiff pout remained glued to her face when
Kelly is treated to a poolside grilling by detective Ray Duquette (Kevin
Bacon).
The trailer to Wild Things gives away a key plot twist (which I still
won't reveal here), but even if you have seen that trailer, there are
plenty of surprises up the film's sleeve.  That's just one of strengths of
Stephen Peters's well-crafted script, which spins plot reversals that shock
without completely violating logic or common sense.  Yes, some twists _are_
outlandish, and that's where his refreshing sense of humor is tonic.  I
don't believe Richards meant to be funny, but there is plenty of
intentional humor that keeps this knowingly trashy story from taking itself
too seriously.  When two at-odds characters display a surprising affection
toward each other, this out-of-left-field development is made more
tolerable by Duquette's absolutely priceless comic reaction to it.
Humor also springs from Peters's wide, sudsy canvas of characters.  Bill
Murray is a hoot as Sam's neck brace-wearing shyster attorney, who has
built a career on fraudulent insurance claims.  Also adding quirky laughs
to the proceedings are more peripheral characters, such as rich, pompous
attorney Tom Baxter (Robert Wagner) and Kelly's slutty mom Sandra (Theresa
Russell).  It is to Peters's credit that these minor players make as
distinct and lasting impressions as more prominent ones, such as Suzie,
Sam, Kelly, or detectives Duquette and Gloria Perez (Daphne Rubin-Vega).
But Wild Things remains a plot-driven movie, and the story is never less
than engrossing and, in the end, satisfying.  And I mean the _very_ end.
Don't be fooled by the "The End" card that appears to conclude the action.
Even more developments--and important insight--are revealed as the final
cast list unspools.    The wild ride that is Wild Things is indeed
manipulative trash that appeals to audiences' basest instincts, but at
least it makes no bones about it--and works.

Title
Review for Midsummer Night's Dream, A (1999)
_William_Shakespeare's_A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream_ (PG-13) ***
The assembled talents of an all-star cast are exploited most delightfully
in Michael Hoffman's adaptation of
_William_Shakespeare's_A_Midsummer_Night's_Dream_.   While as sunny and
sweet as the Bard's original romantic comedy of errors, this update isn't
always dreamy, but its classic romantic spell should leave moviegoers
swooning.
The "dream" of the title is actually one very real night in the forest
where lovers are star-crossed, criss-crossed, or just plain made cross,
thanks to the magical machinations of Oberon (Rupert Everett), the King of
Fairies; and his impish right-hand sprite, Puck (Stanley Tucci).  Into the
forest that night come the hopelessly besotted Lysander (Dominic West) and
Hermia (Anna Friel), the latter of whom is lovelessly betrothed to
Demetrius (Christian Bale), who, in turn, is pursued, however clumsily, by
the unloved-by-anyone Helena (Calista Flockhart).  A few drops of a
flower's magical juice later, and a bewildered Helena finds herself the
object of desire for both Demetrius and Lysander, leaving Hermia by the
wayside.  The juice is indeed loose, for also falling under its power is
Oberon's wife Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer), who becomes enamored of an
ass--literally and figuratively.  His apt name is Nick Bottom (Kevin
Kline), a pompous ham of an actor who is transformed into a
half-man/half-donkey monstrosity by a playful Puck.
This section, being the part that gives the play its title, is the focal
point of the play and the film, but, strangely enough, it's also the part
that works the least well in the film.  Of course, it has nothing to do
with the parent text; Shakespeare's timeless barbs (mostly delivered by a
comically cruel Lysander to a disbelieving Hermia) would never lose their
edge in any translation. Neither are the actors at fault; they are all up
to the Shakespearean task.  The biggest revelation is Flockhart, who
displays exquisite comic timing as the very un-Ally Helena.  What is at
fault, is Hoffman's staging, or, rather, his stage.  This entire second act
was filmed on a soundstage, and it shows: the backdrops are flat; the same
tree sets are recycled over and over again; and--most distracting of
all--it's ridiculously overlit (it may be midsummer, but it still is
_night_).  A certain level of unreality should be brought to this
section--we are dealing with fairies and man-asses here--but it's one thing
to be unreal (as in a fantasy) and entirely another to appear artificial
(as in synthetic).
Hoffman has better luck with other directorial choices.  Most notable is
his change of setting from ancient Greece to 19th Century Italy, and this
adds a fresh new dimension to the material: fresh locations, fresh costumes
(no tights!), and, most notably, the advent of the bicycle, which adds some
needed movement to static scenes.  Hoffman also doesn't force fake British
accents upon his non-Brit stars (Pfeiffer, Flockhart, Kline, Tucci, David
Strathairn, and Sophie Marceau), sparing them and the audience a Kevin
Costner-as-Robin Hood-type embarrassment that would only distract from the
poetry of Shakespeare's words.
It is the timeless appeal of those words, the impassioned performances,
and a bring-down-the-house third act (in which Bottom and his inept troupe
of actors put on a hilariously disastrous play) that make this
high-spirited, if a bit overlong (115 minutes), production live up to its
title: a dream indeed--not without its fuzzy areas, but on the whole "a
most rare vision."  (opens May 14)

Title
Review for Flawless (1999)
With a title like _Flawless_, writer-director Joel Schumacher has set
himself up for the easy critical jab, so allow me to get it out of the
way right here, right now: _Flawless_ is anything but.  However, this
small-scale character drama from the poster child for studio-manufactured
bombast is not without its flashes of perfection even if the whole is the
opposite of its title.
_Flawless_ may take its title from a drag queen beauty pageant that
figures not-at-all-prominently in the plot, but it best serves as a
description of the terrific performances featured in the film.  First and
foremost there is Robert DeNiro, who initially does not break any new
ground as retired New York security guard Walt Koontz, a homophobic macho
man who is constantly annoyed by the drag queens who practice singing in
the apartment across the way.  But after Walt suffers a paralyzing
stroke, DeNiro turns in some of his most impressive work.  His physical
mannerisms are entirely convincing largely because he doesn't overdo
them; he shows remarkable control as Walt's condition slowly improves
through the course of the film.
That improvement is in no small part due to the drag queen who is Walt's
main target, Rusty (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who reluctantly gives Walt
singing lessons as speech therapy.  Hoffman's performance is the direct
opposite of DeNiro's, all flamboyance as opposed to subtlety.  It's a
showy part, no doubt, and Hoffman far from downplays Rusty's theatrical
nature, creating more than a few funny moments.  But his work also
conveys genuine heart; one easily feels the pain behind Rusty's heavily
made-up exterior.
Even the more peripheral supporting players are noteworthy, in
particular Daphne Rubin-Vega, who is touching as Tia, a young tango dance
hall patron who carries a torch for Walt.  But performances do not
entirely a movie make; there has to be an interesting story to tell. 
Unfortunately, Schumacher doesn't come up with one.  As can be gleaned,
the focus of _Flawless_ is the unlikely friendship that develops between
Walt and Rusty, and while the relationship is not without its
charms--DeNiro and Hoffman play, pardon the term, flawlessly off of each
other--there's nothing terribly distinctive with how it develops.  Adding
another layer of contrivance is a tired thriller element Schumacher
places on top of it, involving some shady characters looking for stolen
money.
Schumacher obviously intended _Flawless_ to prove that he can pull off a
small-scale film, but he's only half-succeeded.  The strong performances
show that he can coax winning work from his cast within more modest
settings.  While that proves his ability at a director, his dull script
shows his writing ability lags far behind.

Title
Review for Wing Commander (1999)
_Wing_Commander_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
Last week, the sad announcement was made that the hilarious,
bad-movie-skewering cult TV hit _Mystery_Science_Theater_3000_ was ending
its run after its forthcoming tenth season.  That announcement is even
sadder by the release of _Wing_Commander_, the latest entry in the dubious
"based on a video game" film genre--my, what a field day Mike Nelson and
his robot pals would have had with this prime piece of sci-fi schlock.
Based on the popular computer game of the same name--and directed by no
less than the game's creator, Chris Roberts--_Wing_Commander_ takes place
during a war between humans and the evil Kilrathi alien race in the year
2564.  But that's actually more plot details than anyone really needs.
Essentially, the film is about a bunch of guys in spaceships trying to
shoot down and/or blow up enemy ships.  But someone forgot to tell Roberts
that.
I doubt I have read a more pretentious statement than one Roberts gives in
the press notes: "_Wing_Commander_ is a hard-core war movie set in space.
In some ways, it has more in common with _Midway_ and
_The_Battle_of_Britain_ than with a science-fiction film....  I wanted to
make a film about people under the incredible tension of battle."  It's
more about actors under the incredible tension of poor writing, direction,
and all other facets of filmmaking.  Stars Freddie Prinze, Jr., Matthew
Lillard, and Saffron Burrows (the latter being the "wing commander" of the
title) are all atrocious, but the fact that they've all done acceptable
work in other films (yes, even Prinze) puts them at less blame than Roberts.
The story that he and scripter Kevin Droney have come up with is a messy
mish-mash of elements of _Star_Wars_ (Prinze's metaphysically-gifted
character must save the day with The Force, more or less), _Star_Trek_ (the
gibberish-speaking Kilrathi look like papier-mache mutations of the Klingon
race), and bad soap opera, which manifests itself in the form of cornball
"emotional" scenes and even more painful dialogue.  Among other things,
lines such as "My adult life I've taken crap because I'm part Pilgrim!" and
"He's a good guy, Angel.  There's no reason to hate him" left the preview
audience overcome with laughter.  (And, no, hearing the lines in context
does _not_ help.)
Movies like _Wing_Commander_ make me continue to question the logic of the
whole video-game-to-film practice.  After all, isn't the idea of
interactivity what makes a video game popular in the first place?  Wouldn't
anyone rather sit at home playing the game than pay eight bucks to watch
some dreary feature-length commercial, which is essentially what these poor
excuses for films are?  Then again, in terms of _Wing_Commander_, I'd
rather do just about anything than sit through it another time.
To think that we could have actually been spared the agony that is
_Wing_Commander_: the film had been languishing on Fox's shelf until the
inexplicable success of a certain movie called _She's_All_That_ brought
some luster to Prinze and Lillard's names.  Just another reason to thank
the general moviegoing public for their exquisite taste.

Title
Review for I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998)
_I_Still_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_ (R) * (out of ****)
It is now official--_Scream_writer Kevin Williamson is a genius--that is,
when it comes to writing horror movies.  Everyone else who attempts to
write in the genre these days are hacks, as shown by the recent
_Urban_Legend_ and now _I_Still_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_, the unscary
and thoroughly boring Williamson-less sequel to the Williamson-penned
sleeper of last fall, _I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_.
A sequel to _I_Know..._--no more nor less than an effective formula genre
piece--was just about doomed from its inception.  To start, in addition to
the absence of Williamson (Trey Callaway and Stephen Gaghan wrote this
installment), there's the absence of who was by far _I_Know..._'s most
interesting and magnetic star, Sarah Michelle Gellar, whose character was
among the film's body count.  Then there's the title:
_I_Still_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_?  In the new film, two years have
passed since the pivotal hit-and-run accident that kicked off the original.
 _I_Still_Know_What_You_Did_Two_Summers_Ago_ or simply _I_Still_Know_ would
have been a better fit.  Also, any continuation of the story would
completely negate one of _I_Know..._'s most unexpected pleasures, a shock
ending where snooze-inducing heroine Julie James (the vapid Jennifer Love
Hewitt) got her just desserts, being put out of her--and the
audience's--misery by the hook-handed killer fisherman.
A line of dialogue early in _I_Still_Know..._ explains away that jolting
conclusion as that all-too-familiar of cinematic copouts, a dream.  Julie
is still alive and kicking, attending college as she was at the end of the
last film.  Btu she's still haunted by the thought that Ben Willis (Muse
Watson), the vengeful hook-handed fisherman she and her friends hit with
their car and left for dead in _I_Know..._, is still out to get her.  She's
right.  As Julie and some new friends head for a vacation in the Bahamas,
so does Ben, leaving the usual trail of bloody bodies in his wake.  But
fortunately for Julie, not too far behind is her true love, Ray Bronson
(Freddie Prinze Jr., also returning), who knows that Ben is back.
It's a standard slasher sequel set-up, and that's the problem.  Part of
what made _I_Know..._ work was the mystery of the killer's identity and the
lingering suspicion that one of the four friends was behind the killings.
With the killer now clearly known to be Ben, _I_Still_Know..._ plays like a
cheesy '80s era chiller, a la any given _Friday_the_13th_ sequel.  That
formula extends to the new supporting players, each summed up by one
characteristic: Julie's spunky roommate Karla (Brandy, acting as if she
were still in a _Moesha_ episode), her horny boyfriend Tyrell (the talented
Mekhi Phifer, braving an insulting role), and Julie's nondescript suitor,
Will (nondescript Matthew Settle).  As thin as those characters are, they
are prime steak compared to the background characters in the Bahamas, in
particular a snooty hotel desk clerk (Jeffrey Combs), a tough cookie
bartender (Jennifer Esposito), and, most annoyingly, a perpetually stoned
white rastafarian pool guy.  Needless to say, I didn't care if any of these
characters lived or died.
Characters, or course, are not the point of a film like _I_Still_Know..._;
it's the scares, and in that department, Callaway and director Danny Cannon
fail miserably.  The first hour's purported scares are mostly telegraphed
fakeouts, some of which violate logic.  In one scene, as Julie washes her
hair in the bathroom sink, the fisherman can be seen leaving the room in
the background, punctuated by an ominous cue on the soundtrack.  Suddenly,
Julie lifts her head and starts to look around.  How could she suspect
anything unless she heard the music?  When the film supposedly kicks in to
high gear toward the end, the unsuspenseful chases and unimpressive gore
are not worth the wait; there's nothing as scary as the beauty pageant
murder or the store/alley chase-and-evasion sequence in the
original--there's just nothing scary, period.
Callaway and Gaghan are poor substitutes for Williamson, who gave the
original some flashes of wit and, for the most part, managed to sidestep
the irksome thriller cliches.  Cliches are in full force this time around,
never so clearly in a scene where a scared Julie slowly walks in a darkened
apartment; if she's so scared, why doesn't she turn on a light?  Plot is as
irrelevant as character in this film, but the number of holes in Callaway
and Gaghan's story are ridiculous.  For example, an injured Ray escapes
from a hospital back in the States and calls Julie's hotel in the Bahamas
from a pay phone.  How did he know what hotel she was staying at?  More
ruinous, though, are some key plot developments which attempt to shed some
light on Ben's past.  I won't give anything away, but one twist makes
absolutely no sense within the context of the first film, and the new
backstory cheapens the original, in a sense letting the four irresponsible
friends off the hook.
_I_Still_Know..._ leaves the door open for more sequels
(_I_Will_Always_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_?
_I_Still_Know_What_You_Did_the_Last_Three_Summers_?), but, if there's any
luck, after this dreadful installment the franchise will heed the words of
its heroine: "JUST FUCKING DIE!"

Title
Review for G.I. Jane (1997)
G.I. Jane (R) *** (out of ****)
        In recent years, Demi Moore has been better suited to promoting her
films than starring in them.  Her audacious claim that "not that many people
have read the book" resulted in a lot of press for Roland Joffe's disastrous
The Scarlet Letter, but she seemed out of time and place, to say the least,
on screen as Nathaniel Hawthorne's tortured heroine.  Moore seductively
shimmied with Barbara Walters, stripped down for David Letterman, and urged
women everywhere to do a little Striptease for themselves, but her grave
earnestness was completely at odds with the ridiculous goings-on in last
summer's notorious would-be comedy.
        However, Moore could not have been more perfectly cast as the
strong-willed heroine in Ridley Scott's surprisingly effective G.I. Jane.
Moore stars as Lt. Jordan O'Neil, a Navy intelligence officer who is chosen
as the first woman to enter the rigorous training for the Navy SEALs.  How
rigorous?  We are told early on and at various points throughout the film
that the dropout rate is 60%--that statistic, of course, reflecting only
men.  Will Jordan beat the odds, overcome the sexism of her commanding
officers, and complete her training?
        Yes, the scenario served up by writers David Twohy and Danielle
Alexandra is rather predictable, and one late development where Jordan must
prove her mettle in true combat is contrived, but they manage to throw in a
few wrinkles to make the proceedings consistently interesting.  Jordan is
not the prototypical "G.I. Jane" of the title from the get-go; early on, she
struggles as badly as one would expect a woman, and when the men say that
she's in over her head, the statement does hold some water.  Naturally,
Jordan does become a stronger soldier, but the changes do not occur
overnight--it is a gradual process, one she is still going through by the
end of the film.  Also, there is more to the story than Jordan overcoming
adversity; there is also an interesting subplot about how she is used as a
pawn in a feminist senator's (well-played by Anne Bancroft) political
wheelings and dealings.  It's unfortunate that the intelligence evident in
certain parts of the script didn't extend to the dialogue, which at certain
points is fairly laughable (my favorite line is the destined-to-be-quoted
"Get your dick back in here!").
        Scott directs G.I. Jane with a quick rhythm and (naturally) a visual
slickness, and he elicits fine performances all around, notably from Viggo
Mortensen as Jordan's iron-fisted master chief.  As good as Mortensen is,
the star of the show is clearly Moore; I cannot imagine this film working as
well as it does without her in the lead.  One of her most defining
characteristics is her steely determination, and while that same quality
seemed so wrong for The Scarlet Letter and Striptease, it is what is exactly
called for by the role of Jordan.  We not only believe that Jordan can
survive the hellish training, we also buy the fact that she actually _wants_
to go through with it.  Moore is also a bit of a revelation during the more
action-oriented sequences; she is convincing in the more physical fight and
combat scenes, showing potential as--if she ever elected to go that
route--an action heroine.
        Newsweek caused a stir earlier this year when the magazine published
an article speculating that Moore, who has not had a hit film in years, has
become an audience deterrent.  The true test of that theory comes with G.I.
Jane.  Unlike her previous solo starring efforts, it is a solid piece of
entertainment, and if its grosses go the way of Striptease, then she really
must be box office poison.

Title
Review for Vita č bella, La (1997)
_Life_Is_Beautiful_(La_Vita_E_Bella)_ (PG-13) **** (out of ****)
It would seem impossible to make a "Holocaust comedy," but Roberto Benigni
has not only made one, he has made a terrific one.  A national treasure in
his native Italy, Benigni co-wrote (with Vincenzo Cerami), directed, and
stars in the funny, poignant tale of Guido (Benigni), a Jewish bookstore
owner in fascist WWII Italy whose "beautiful" existence with wife Dora
(Nicoletta Braschi) and son Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini) is disrupted when
the entire family is sent to a concentration camp.  Although he is equally
terrified by harsh camp life tas anyone else, Guido is nonetheless
determined to shield his son from the truth of their horrific reality,
coming up with an elaborate, if desperate, cover story to convince Joshua
that everything is fine.
And that's how Benigni is able to maintain what would seem an improbable
balance: the film wins hearty, heartfelt laughs through Guido's creative
lies while never once downplaying the inhumane horror of the concentration
camp situation.  While one may often laugh at Guido's ruse, each laugh
comes with the lingering threat of death, which Benigni vividly yet fairly
subtly depicts (people being called for "showers," a brief glimpse of
charred bodies).  _La_Vita_E_Bella_'s lasting impression is not made by its
laughs or sense of reality, but its huge heart.  Strip away the harrowing
Holocaust setting, and Benigni's story is a simple, timeless, uplifting
tale of the ways (in this case, through laughter) love can bring out the
unlikely, but no less brave, hero in any man.  (opens October 23)

Title
Review for Down to You (2000)
_Down_to_You_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
        When Miramax's publicity department announced that their youth romance
_Down_to_You_ would not be screened in advance for critics because they
were running behind in getting prints finished, it was easy to peg that
excuse as a bunch of hooey.  After all, this _is_ January, the
traditional dumping ground for cinematic refuse.  While I don't think the
film is quite at that low level, it does suffer from a big problem--one
that is, interestingly enough, suggested by Miramax's no-screening
reason: in terms of content, the film feels unfinished itself.
        First-time writer-director Kris Isacsson does have his basic components
in place.  The heart of the film is the love story--told in heavy
flashback--between two New York college students, aspiring chef Al
(Freddie Prinze Jr.) and artist Imogen (Julia Stiles).  Their love is
first love--meaning passionate, impetuous, and in many ways immature. 
For the most part, what is not immature is Isacsson's honest portrayal of
such a type of relationship.  This being a standard-issue Hollywood
romance, it's not a spoiler to say that Al and Imogen are destined to end
up together.  Adding authenticity to such a convention is the unforced
rapport between Prinze and Stiles.  Yet as easily as their chemistry
convinces that these two do belong together, one does get the sense that
these two characters aren't quite ready to make the commitment to match
their natural compatibility.  They're human, but they're also quite
young, and thus prone to do things that make little sense, least of all
to themselves--and Al and Imogen hold true to that fact.
        While Al and especially Imogen come off as real people, their supporting
cast is sketchy at best.  Selma Blair is wasted in a throwaway role as a
porn star attracted to Al; Rosario Dawson is similarly squandered as
Imogen's flaky friend Lana.   At one point, Al gets on the outs with his
actor/also-porn-dabbling friend Monk (Zak Orth), but one never gets a
clear idea of who Monk is and how close he is with Al that it's
impossible to care.  The background players that remotely make any
impressions are those used for cheap comic relief: Al's workout-happy
roomie Eddie (Shawn Hatosy) and Al's TV chef father (Henry Winkler).
        But even those two fail to serve their real purpose: they really aren't
all that funny.  Then again, neither are all of the stabs at comedy in
_Down_to_You_.  This being a PG-13 film, the numerous porn and sex gags
are not only dumbed-down but played-down, thus rendering them pointless. 
In fact, all the attempts for laughs feel pointless, for they serve to
distract from the real matter at hand--the Al/Imogen romance. 
_Down_to_You_ feels unfinished largely because Isacsson never decided
what he really wanted to make: a straight romance, or a romantic comedy. 
As such, we have a love story whose charm is often undercut by silly
would-be comedy such as one character's attempted suicide by shampoo
ingestion.
        Like its title, _Down_to_You_ ultimately comes down to one person, and
that is Stiles.  As she demonstrated in _10_Things_I_Hate_About_You_, not
only is she an actress blessed with beauty and real presence, she also is
quite talented; she is able to suggest a depth to Imogen not necessarily
written in Isacsson's script.  She is also able to bring out a charm in
her co-star that I had never before seen in his other films.  I look
forward to seeing her in a real movie, for underachieving fluff such as
_Down_to_You_ fail to serve this promising new star any justice.

Title
Review for Quills (2000)
The thought that most immediately comes to mind with the mention of the
Marquis de Sade is that of sex--not just any sex, but the kinkiest acts
of fornication imaginable.  Yet Philip Kaufman's provocative account of
the infamous 19th Century French writer's final days is titled _Quills_,
and the reason is simple: this powerful version of Sade's story is one
ultimately not about sensationalistic salaciousness, but the power--and
price--of self-expression.
But sex--both the forced act of and graphic writing about it--is, after
all, what lands the Marquis in various forms of captivity: prison and,
ultimately, an asylum.  It is in the latter, Charenton, where Sade
(played by Geoffrey Rush) is introduced, submitting his latest torrid
text to a publisher through unlikely supporter Madeleine (Kate Winslet),
a young laundress.  Immediately upon publication, Sade's sexually
explicit _Justine_ is the talk of France, leading an outraged Napoleon to
send self-righteous Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) to Charenton and
give Sade the discipline he had not been receiving under Abbé Coulmier
(Joaquin Phoenix), the young priest in charge of the asylum.
The clashes and collisions that power _Quills_ don't necessarily derive
from differences in one's nature than differences in one's ideals.  The
conflict between Royer-Collard and the Marquis is the film's most heated,
but they are two sides of the same proverbial coin.  For all his talk
about morality, Royer-Collard is himself engaged in a scandalous
affair--that with Simone (Amelia Warner), his very young, almost
child-like bride; the hypocritical doctor shields what would otherwise be
a frowned-upon indulgence under an "upstanding" societal
convention--marriage--while Sade is shameless in expressing his darker,
deep-seated urges.  The seemingly angelic Madeleine is, in fact, Sade's
closest match.  She is quite comfortable with and honest about having
those base instincts, but she knows her place in her constricting world;
hence, she enjoys her natural naughtiness in the expanse of her mind,
whose limitless imagination is further fueled by possibilities presented
by Sade's incendiary prose.  For the Abbé, his most-valued belief in a
divinity overpowers--barely--his simmering attraction to Madeleine.
The psychological conflicts, both internal and external, are lent
immediacy by the actors.   Caine, in a much more impressive performance
than his Oscar-winning _Cider_House_Rules_ turn, is a subtly formidable
foil to Rush, who gives the Marquis genuine vulnerability as his veneers
are gradually stripped away.  The complexities of Madeleine are handled
with characteristic ease by the ever-astonishing (and -ravishing)
Winslet, and Phoenix proves his versatility with his nuanced portrayal of
the anguished Abbé.
Given the subject matter, _Quills_ could have been unbearably heavy, but
Kaufman and writer Doug Wright (adapting his own play) infuse the film
with a decadent playfulness befitting a film about the Marquis--a spirit
that is perfectly embodied by the exuberant Rush.  This quality does act
as reinforcement of the film's endorsement of uninhibited expression, but
to Kaufman and Wright's credit, they don't sidestep the negative fallout
that could occur along with the obvious benefits of artistic freedom.  
Prices, both fair and unfair, are paid all around, and those costs
continue to be felt even after _Quills_ etches the disappointingly
contrived images of its lackluster epilogue.

Review for Theory of Flight, The (1998)
_The_Theory_of_Flight_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
As part of a community service sentence, Richard (Kenneth Branagh)
becomes the caretaker of Jane (Helena Bonham Carter), a headstrong young
woman stricken with ALS, the degenerative neurological disease better
known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.  It sounds like a garden variety
disease-of-the-week TV movie, but director Paul Greengrass and writer
Richard Hawkins have managed to come up with something fresh and offbeat,
focusing not on Jane's illness, but her desire to lose her virginity
before she dies.  This is not, however, to suggest that the film is a
downer; in fact, the tone of the film is quite light and never sappy,
thanks to the eccentric characters and often comical situations they get
themselves into.
But it's one thing to be offbeat and unconventional and quite another to
be unbelievable, and what keeps the film from truly taking flight is that
too much of Richard's behavior falls under the latter category--namely,
his scheme to rob a bank to buy a gigolo's services for Jane.  In fact,
his main character quirk--to achieve flight with a homemade plane pieced
together from unwanted articles from his past--is also a bit hard to
swallow.  Nonetheless, the film does achieve some emotional resonance,
due to solid performances by the leads (Bonham Carter is especially good,
barely recognizable and completely convincing) and their effortless
chemistry.

Title
Review for Slums of Beverly Hills (1998)
_Slums_of_Beverly_Hills_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
In late August, the Fox network is premiering a new period sitcom called
_That_'70s_Show_.  If I didn't know any better, I would have believed that
the pilot had already aired--on the big screen, under the title
_Slums_of_Beverly_Hills_.  For her first film, writer-director Tamara
Jenkins has served up a well-meaning, often engaging comedic slice of 1976
SoCal life, but even its pleasures would seem more at home on the tube.
This is not to say, however, that _Slums_ is without big screen-worthy
virtues.  First and foremost, Jenkins offers an unusually frank depiction
of a teenage girl's sexual awakening, that of 15-year-old Vivian Abramowitz
(Natasha Lyonne).  Vivian is neither completely excited over nor frightened
of her burgeoning womanhood, as films often depict; instead, she occupies a
more realistic, tentative middle ground.  A sore subject for her is her
ever-increasing breast size, but she is not afraid to use the allure of
such assets, allowing a
potential paramour (Kevin Corrigan) to touch them during what is only a
second meeting.  Jenkins also deserves credit for showing Vivian experiment
with a vibrator.  While she deserves credit for the mere inclusion of such
a scene, Jenkins's real accomplishment is making it tasteful, realistic,
and not at all ridiculous.
Lyonne is an endearing lead, and her performance is well-supported by the
rest of the cast, including Alan Arkin as her father, Murray; and Marisa
Tomei as her recovering drug addict cousin, Rita.  However, the cast is
ultimately only as good as the material, and Jenkins's script, while
consistently amusing and full of nicely droll one-liners, is fairly thin.
The title refers to the seedy areas on the fringes of the Beverly Hills
city limits where the divorced Murray insists he and his three
children--Vivian, wisecracking older brother Ben (David Krumholtz), and
nondescript youngest Rickey (Eli Marienthal)--make their home (he wants
them to get the education only the Hills of Beverly schools can provide).
Or, rather, homes--the family rarely stays in one location for longer than
a month, setting the stage for a few location changes that would suit an
ongoing television series.  Then again, a lot of _Slums_ would suit a
series, for the film feels like a pilot for a made-for-Showtime series,
with its formulaic episodes of zaniness (the growing comic complications in
a scene with an unconscious Rita follows a predictable "let's top this"
crescendo), a family member who pops in to stir the pot as a "guest star"
(Rita), plot threads eventually tied together into a cutesy little bow, and
an open ended resolution that screams out "to be continued," all of which
is laced with enough raunch to keep it from seeing broadcast network airwaves.
_Slums_of_Beverly_Hills_ is a reasonably enjoyable lark whose 91 minutes
go down smoothly.  You're guaranteed a laugh here and there, and plenty
more smiles.  But it's the snack food equivalent of film--it satisfies for
a while, but it doesn't fill you up in the long run.

Title
Review for Pleasantville (1998)
_Pleasantville_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Thanks to a magical remote control, '90s fraternal twin siblings David
(Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) get sucked into the
wholesome, black-and-white, 1950s TV sitcom world of Pleasantville.  It's a
gimmicky premise, one that would appear to set the stage for a
too-cute-for-its-own-good film.  But writer-director Gary Ross uses the
gimmick as the springboard for a wildly clever fable of self-discovery in
which the two teens' contemporary sensibilities break the citizens of
Pleasantville from their antiquated bonds of repression.  Spiritual
awakening is not without its side effects, most visibly being a
part-by-part transformation from drab duotones to vibrant
Technicolor--which leads to a sly (and most unexpected) satire of racial
politics.
The beauty of _Pleasantville_ is while it tackles some issues that are
high-minded, the film itself is not.  Ross has his cake and eats it too,
being socially relevant without being preachy, never once forgetting the
film's duty to the audience is to entertain--and that it does.  The script
is as funny as it is wholly original, and it is filled with memorable
characters, such as the seemingly happy marrieds George (William H. Macy)
and Betty Parker (Joan Allen) and timid malt shop owner Mr. Johnson (Jeff
Daniels).  If the script has a shortcoming, it is that the arcs of the two
main characters, '50s-loving David and wild '90s girl Jennifer, are rather
predictable.  The one element of _Pleasantville_ that is perhaps attracting
the most attention is the special effects wizardry used to mix black and
white with color; while the resulting visuals are stunning, what makes the
effects work all the more impressive is how they are used to support story
ideas rather than to serve as gratuitous eye candy.  (opens October 23)

Title
Review for Bliss (1997)
Joseph (Craig Sheffer) and Maria (Sheryl Lee) appear to be the
perfect young married couple, but there's one pesky problem--Maria fakes her
orgasms.  Enter Balthazar (Terence Stamp), a physician specializing in the
healing powers of sex--or, as he's referred to in one scene, "Dr. Fuck"--who
trains Maria and, ultimately, Joseph in the art of achieving spiritual and
sexual bliss.
The international media audience with whom I saw Lance Young's
long-delayed film (it had been held up for a year due to ratings trouble)
could not take the film nearly as seriously as he would have like it to
be--and how could they, especially when a lot of the dialogue inches into
Joe Eszterhas territory (my favorite exchange--Joseph: "I can't come!"
Maria: "Too bad, MOTHERFUCKER!") and the stabs at comic relief play as pure
camp?  It got to the point where the audience started to mock the more
"serious" passages.  When Balthazar tells Joseph, "You have to make love
with love and adoration," someone in the back of the audience started
clapping, and everyone laughed; a similar reaction came when Maria is
finally able to climax.
Bliss finally falls apart beyond repair in the third act, when,
without warning,  the film takes a gravely serious turn, becoming in effect
what can best be described as a lost, alternate reality chapter of Twin
Peaks, Lee's former television series--What if Laura Palmer had lived and
gotten married?  As seen in the Peaks feature, Fire Walk with Me, Lee does
some good emoting, but Sheffer is too much of a lightweight to completely
convince in his big emotional scene with Lee.  Stamp, on the other hand, is
the only one involved in the film with some handle on how ridiculous much of
it is, dispensing his character's carnal wisdom with tongue firmly in cheek.

Title
Review for Frequency (2000)
The science fiction thriller _Frequency_ asks a number of questions, a
few of which are showcased in its trailer.  "What if you could reach back
in time?"  "What if you could change the past?"  "What if it changed
everything?"  The most important question, however, is left uncovered:
"What if you had an interesting premise and then went about it all
wrong?"  The answer to that query is the disappointing film itself.
The root of that problem is clearly evidenced in the trailer.  Buzz
around Gregory Hoblit's film had been building steadily the past few
months, and at first the preview proves why.  The idea behind Toby
Emmerich's screenplay is intriguing.  In 1999, cop John Sullivan (Jim
Caviezel) discovers the old ham radio that belonged to his fireman father
Frank (Dennis Quaid), who died in action nearly 30 years to the day. 
Somehow, some way the 1999 radio is able to pick up signals from 1969,
namely those of Frank.  John, who never had a chance to really know his
father, suddenly finds himself bonding with him through time and space by
way of the radio.  But the seemingly innocent talk proves to have
far-reaching consequences, altering the past and future in ways that are
not always for the better.
So far, so good, but then the trailer ends on a completely wrong note:
Frank and a weeping Jim saying "I love you" to each other.  It's a
jarringly maudlin note to end an ad for what had been sold as a thriller,
and it's to Hoblit and Emmerich's credit that in the film, the father-son
emotional angle is more smoothly embedded into the story.  Even so, such
sentimentality is far from the director's strong suit.  Hoblit's previous
feature credits are _Primal_Fear_ and _Fallen_, two films that are
characterized by--and whose success was largely due to--their darkness
and cynicism.  Those aren't exactly the best qualifications to tackle
something with as severe a case of the warm fuzzies as _Frequency_, and
as is typically the case with underqualified directors attempting
something "deep" and "emotional," sentimentality becomes schmaltz.
There is one big problem hidden by _Frequency_'s trailer, and that is
the wrongheaded shift that occurs about midway.  Up until that point, the
interesting premise has its appeal and wonder, but it suddenly morphs
into a typical serial killer thriller, with John attempting to nab a
murderer of nurses.  The special wrinkle is that the killings take place
in 1969, and Frank has to do the legwork under the advisement John gives
in 1999.  That proves to be just a minor detail, though, for we get the
familiar scenes of Frank skulking around bars, following suspicious
characters and having suspicious characters follow him.  Even more
familiar is the fact that the killer's reach extends to Frank and John's
family.
There's still that great hook, though, but in retrospect there is
another miscalculation at work.  With premises that delve into the
fantastic, one should either offer a thorough explanation or none at all;
you either try to make logical sense, or just make the audience accept it
as a given.  Emmerich and Hoblit wrongly attempt at a middle ground.  It
is implied that Frank and John are able to communicate through time
because radio transmissions are trapped over time in the Aurora Borealis,
but there's nothing beyond a vague reference or two.  Such a
half-hearted, unclear reasoning is sure to leave no one satisfied.
The two leads, however, do not disappoint.  Quaid hasn't had a major
league role in years, and he proves here that, when given the chance, he
can deliver.  Frank is a good, upstanding guy, and Quaid makes the
character a lot more interesting than that basic description would make
him out to be.  Caviezel first caught my--and many other's--eye with his
standout work as the de facto lead in _The_Thin_Red_Line_, and the
reasons why I like him so much may very well be the reasons why he may
never become a big star; he's an introspective, subtle performer who
doesn't resort to broad theatrics.  His internal approach works well for
John, who must hide his inner pain and inadequacy under the tough façade
of a police detective.
They--and the rest of the strong cast--deserve better than _Frequency_. 
Then again, the idea behind _Frequency_ deserves better than _Frequency_,
which proves that having an inspired idea is only half the battle in
making a good movie.

Title
Review for Being John Malkovich (1999)
_Being_John_Malkovich_ (R) **** (out of ****)
There has never been anything quite like _Being_John_Malkovich_, and
there likely never will be again.  No imitator--a number of which the
film is sure to inspire--could ever capture the clever, surreal dementia
of this "comic fantasia" written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by music
video wunderkind Spike Jonze.  It begins on a somewhat offbeat but
deceptively normal-seeming note: unemployed New York puppeteer Craig
Schwartz (John Cusack) takes a job with a filing company and becomes
infatuated with Maxine (Catherine Keener), who works at a neighboring
company on the 7 1/2 floor (don't ask) even though he is married to dowdy
pet store worker Lotte (Cameron Diaz).  Then comes the absurd wrinkle to
the tale: one day at work Craig stumbles onto a secret tunnel that
leads... into the mind of actor John Malkovich (who plays himself).
Rarely does one ever get to see with one original twist, let alone the
wild and completely unpredictable entirety of _Being_John_Malkovich_; the
portal conceit is merely the jumping-off point for an exploration of
celebrity, identity, sexuality, and other issues that is never less than
imaginative--not to mention insanely funny and consistently surprising. 
Kaufman's giddily complex script and Jonze's adept direction never hits a
false note; even the most outrageous hairpin twist feels like a logical
development. Deftly handling the demanding material and giving it a
certain something more is the amazing cast; Cusack, Diaz, and Keener are
not only funny, but they lend a real pathos to their characters that
lends some genuine emotional involvement to the story.  Best of all,
though, is Malkovich, absolutely hilarious and the epitome of a good
sport as the bewildered man whose head becomes a metaphysical amusement
park for others.  A work of stunning originality, _Being_John_Malkovich_
is an amusement park thrill ride in itself, constantly twisting and
turning its audience in new and unforeseen directions--but unlike the
case with most roller coasters, this film's passengers will walk away
completely satisfied.

Title
Review for Loss of Sexual Innocence, The (1999)
_The_Loss_of_Sexual_Innocence_ (R) * (out of ****)
Writer-director Mike Figgis has described _The_Loss_of_Sexual_Innocence_
as his most personal film, and one would be hard-pressed to argue.  So
personal as to be self-indulgent, so self-indulgent as to make not a
single iota of sense to anyone _but_ him, this admittedly captivating but
wholly incoherent and utterly baffling experience will likely leave
everyone else dumbfounded.  That the film has no plot is of little
consequence; I actually applaud Figgis for being so boldly experimental,
studying his main character, filmmaker Nic (played as an adult by Julian
Sands), through key yet completely unrelated episodes throughout his
life.
But when one goes for broke, one can often crap out, and that's what
Figgis has done here in every sense that expression can be taken. 
Despite the stunning cinematography of Benoit Delhomme, his interesting
idea becomes increasingly less so as the film progresses, for few of the
vignettes make any lasting impression.  It is telling that the most
effective of the episodes has the least to do with Nic and, hence, the
entire film: a haunting sequence (eerily scored by Figgis) detailing the
chance meeting of now-adult twins (Saffron Burrows) who were separated at
birth.
But the individual vignettes' lack of interest is the least of Figgis's
problems--his largest is his self-important pretentiousness.  In a truly
headscratching move, he has Nic's (for lack of a better term) "story"
intercut with wordless scenes of Adam (Femi Ogumbanjo) and Eve (Hanne
Klintoe) frolicking in the Garden of Eden.  (Included is a laughably
earnest scene where Adam and Eve watch each other in wonder as they both
urinate.)  The Nic episodes by themselves don't make any collective
impact nor sense, let alone when grouped with the (as billed by the
on-screen intertitle) "Scenes of Nature."  Appropriately enough, Figgis's
artistic fall is best exemplified by his description-defying depiction of
the Fall: Adam and Eve are run out of the Garden of Eden by military
police, accompanied by the requisite barking hounds; awaiting the couple
just outside the gates are swarming paparazzi, who chase them into the
night.

Title
Review for Apt Pupil (1998)
Bryan Singer's adaptation of the the Stephen King novella _Apt_Pupil_
opens with images one would associate with such a title.  A high school
student receives an "A" on a paper and then shuttles off to the library,
immersing himself in research as the opening titles unspool.  As this dark,
often disturbing psychological thriller progresses, the title's meaning
remains the same, except it gradually takes on a much more sinister
perspective.
The apt pupil seen at the opening of the film is 16-year-old high school
student Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro), whose intense extracurricular research
on the Holocaust leads him to discover that one Arthur Denker (Ian
McKellen), an old man whom he has seen around town, is really Nazi war
criminal-in-hiding Kurt Dussander.  But instead of turning him in, Todd
proposes an odd exchange: his silence in return for Dussander's first-hand
accounts of wartime atrocities.
Of course, dredging up the past brings to the surface Dussander's fascist
tendencies, but _Apt_Pupil_ goes one step further in that the stories bring
forth Todd's capacity for evil as well; it is this psychological seduction
that lends the film a queasy fascination.  Singer and screenwriter Brandon
Boyce also go against the populist Hollywood grain by boldly making the
already fairly unsympathetic characters _moreso_ as the film goes on.
While the absence of a likable lead character will certainly off-put many
moviegoers, and one contrived plot development is a bit hard to swallow,
audiences are nonetheless more than likely to remain riveted by Renfro and
McKellen's dead-on performances.  Renfro's evolution from curious
adolescent to hateful manipulator is unsettlingly believable while
McKellen, speaking with a perfect German accent, gives Dussander an air of
quiet majesty that is as frightening as it is deceiving.
While he heavily uses quick cuts and horrifying imagery, Singer admirably
eschews easy "shock" gimmicks to jolt the audience out their seats.
Instead, he appears more concerned with the collective effect of a variety
shocks, visual and otherwise, on the viewer's psyche.  As such, _Apt_Pupil_
gets under the skin like few thrillers do.  A mad slasher with an axe does
not necessarily constitute a successful frightfest; what does is the
feeling of terror that comes with being pursued by such a force of evil.
_Apt_Pupil_'s primary force of evil may be axe-less and of poor physical
health, but his--and the film's--subtle brand of cerebral terror cuts
sharper and deeper than anything found in a more conventional horror movie.

Title
Review for Mercy Streets (2000)
_Mercy_Streets_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
        _Mercy_Streets_ is the latest feature film project from
Providence Entertainment, the makers of last year's abysmal
Christian-themed thriller _The_Omega_Code_--and, as that fact suggests,
there is an aggressive pro-faith agenda at work in this drama.  For
devout viewers of the Trinity Broadcasting Network, that element will be
enough to not only send them flocking to theatres, but also spread
enthusiastic word-of-mouth (as was the case with _Omega_).  For everyone
else, however, that angle is the only thing that separates this plodding
melodrama from most cheap direct-to-video fare.
        The not-ready-for-the-big-screen indications come early, when we
see that the top-billed star is none other than straight-to-tape stalwart
Eric Roberts.  Roberts, in fact, only has a supporting role in
_Mercy_Streets_, taking a back seat to the real lead, a justified unknown
by the name of David White (who also produced).  White plays John, a
recently released convict who quickly falls back under the wing of mentor
Rome (Roberts) and into the criminal life.  John tries to double cross
Rome, but when the plan unravels, John seeks out estranged brother
Jeremiah, a gentle guy studying to become an Episcopal priest.  The
twist?  Jeremiah and John are twins, setting the stage for laughably
primitive camera tricks (the brothers never face the camera at the same
time; composite shots have an obvious dividing line; etc).  When Rome
inadvertently kidnaps Jeremiah, John must assume his brother's identity,
and Jeremiah has his darker instincts brought out by Rome's persuasive
ways.
        While not especially fresh, there's nothing inherently wrong with
the basic premise of _Mercy_Streets_.  But such a twin-switch scenario
sinks or swims with the actor tackling the dual role, and White isn't up
to the task.  He is completely overwrought and unconvincing as the tough
John (an early scene that's designed to establish the character's mean
side is especially embarrassing), and while he fares better as the nice
Jeremiah, White isn't able to convey what should be the conflicted
anguish of that character.  The air of realism that director Jon Gunn so
clearly strives for is also ruined by Roberts' scenery chewing theatrics.
        Then there's the matter of the religious agenda.  Don't get me
wrong; I have no problem with a film that tries to push a personal belief
as long as it goes about it in a compelling way (e.g. _The_Contender_). 
Gunn fails to do so; despite some arbitrary visual flourishes (slow
motion and freeze frames), the film is slowly, lazily paced, and he and
co-writer John W. Mann clunkily incorporate the Gospel message--somewhat
baffling considering one of the main characters is a
minister-in-the-making.  As such, when the film suddenly shifts to talk
of God and His word, the moments stick out and feel even more preachy
than they otherwise would have been.
        The softhearted spiritual talk also feels less than sincere
considering the amount of violent content in _Mercy_Streets_.  Bloodshed
is fairly minimal, but there are some brutal moments, in particular a
couple of fistfighting scenes and one unexpectedly intense beating scene.
 The positive message behind _Mercy_Streets_ is good for the entire
family, but it seems like wasted effort when the vessel for the message
isn't entirely appropriate for all audiences.

Title
Review for Jing cha gu shi III: Chao ji jing cha (1992)
Jackie Chan should have no trouble keeping his new American fans--or
gaining new ones--with Miramax/Dimension's wide release of Supercop,
enormously entertaining 1992 second sequel (originally released as Police
Story III: Supercop) to his 1985 classic Police Story.
Supercop, directed by frequent Chan collaborator Stanley Tong,
boasts a sturdier story than Chan's recent American breakthrough, the
messily-written Rumble in the Bronx (which was also helmed by Tong).  Chan
once again plays Hong Kong cop "Kevin" Chan, who this time teams with tough
mainland security officer Yang (the incredible HK superstar Michelle Khan,
a.k.a. Michelle Yeoh) on an undercover mission to befriend a criminal (Yuen
Wah) to take down his drug kingpin brother (Ken Tsang).  The title is
something of a joke--the mainland forces recruit Kevin because his past
extraordinary feats make him out to be a "supercop"; however, while he's
definitely good at what he does and delivers in the pinch, he's also a cocky
goofball.  The true "supercop" is the no-nonsense Yang, who could very well
be tougher than he is.
Miramax/Dimension has altered a few things in reworking the film for
a stateside audience.  There's a sharp new opening credit sequence (which
rivals Mission: Impossible for best opening of the year) in place of the
original's brief flashing of the title, stars, and director;  and the film
now opens with Chan's entrance, which originally came about five minutes in,
after some lengthy exposition.  But not all of the changes are for the
better: there's (of course) a mostly ineffective English dialogue track
(thankfully, though, Chan and Khan do their own dubbing); a new score by
Joel McNeely, complete with some out-of-place rap tunes, that doesn't
improve on the perfectly adequate original music; and the de rigueur closing
outtake reel is scored to an excrutiating Tom Jones cover of that '70s camp
gem, "Kung Fu Fighting."
The less successful alterations, though, don't detract from the
film's existing charms, which, of course, is explosive action.  Chan doesn't
engage in as much martial arts as he did in Rumble, and the action here is
more in line with Hollywood productions (i.e. more explosions and gunplay).
But that is not to say the Supercop does not deliver some knockout
sequences, which it definitely does.  The most notable set piece is the
incredible final 20 minute chase, which involves vans, cars, motorcycles,
helicopters, a train, and some unbelievable derring-do from Chan and Khan.
Khan is perhaps the real star of the film, engaging in more of the physical
stunts than Chan, and matching his moves punch for punch, kick for kick (in
fact, Khan and the character of Yang caused such a sensation that she was
given her own spinoff starring vehicle: the disappointingly tepid, virtually
action-free Supercop 2, a.k.a. Once a Cop, a.k.a. Project S, a.k.a. Police
Story III Part 2).  She and Chan also make a formidable pair between action
scenes; their spirited verbal sparring packs as strong a kick as their
martial arts moves.
What is especially notable about Miramax/Dimension's version of
Supercop is what they _didn't_ take out--the comedy, which New Line mostly
removed from Rumble.  While the Americanized Rumble was an entertaining
action flick, it didn't really show a lot of the comedic prowess that makes
Jackie Chan so special and unique; thankfully, the revised Supercop keeps a
great comic scene in which Kevin's girlfriend (played, as in the first two
Police Story films, by the stunning Maggie Cheung) thinks he's cheating on
her with Yang.
Supercop is a double-barreled blessing for Hong Kong action fans.
Number one, it continues the long-overdue stateside success of Jackie Chan;
number two, it unleashes the mighty Michelle Khan on an unsuspecting
American public.  Now, if only John Woo muse Chow Yun-Fat could make _his_
U.S. breakthrough...

Title
Review for Game, The (1997)
The Game (R) *** 1/2
        "What do you give the man who has everything?"  A few days of living
hell, apparently, and it is exactly that, concentrated into two hours, which
director David Fincher serves moviegoers in The Game, a wonderfully
unsettling and suspenseful thriller that launches PolyGram's new film
distribution wing with a bang.
        Michael Douglas is in his element as wealthy businessman Nicholas
van Orton: cold, calculating, and looking out for no one but himself,
Nicholas is exactly the type of sinful-guy-due-for-a-comeuppance Douglas has
built his career on playing, and, predictably, Douglas nails the role
perfectly.  When Nicholas's brother Conrad, a.k.a. "Connie" (Sean Penn, in a
role meant for Jodie Foster), gives him an invitation to a mysterious game
as a birthday present, the seeds of Nicholas's destruction are planted.
After extensive testing at the offices of Consumer Recreation Services, the
company in charge of the Game, Nicholas soon finds himself in one
life-threatening situation after another, which leads him to wonder if he is
indeed just playing a game (albeit a really twisted one) or if someone
really wants him dead.
        It is that question of illusion versus reality that propels the
intricate, unpredictable, if implausible storyline cooked up by writers John
Brancato and Michael Ferris.  Unlike too many mystery-thrillers, the writing
and directing remains one step ahead of the audience; just when one is led
to think one way, something twists our beliefs in the other, creating a
chilling atmosphere of uncertainty.  This is not surprising coming from
Fincher, who established himself as a master of mood with the unflinchingly
dark Alien3 and Se7en.  However, in those films, mood bogged down the pace,
thus stripping away the necessary urgency; a similarly slow pace would have
been deadly to The Game, whose implausibilities would not hold up if there
were time for close scrutiny.  The Game finds Fincher in a
uncharacteristic--and highly effective--faster gear, sweeping the audience
away on an unrelenting rollercoaster of plot twists and paranoia which
always stays true to the material's mean streak.
        Apparently not content to be a well-crafted funhouse ride, Brancato
and Ferris throw in a psychological angle to the proceedings which is not
satisfactorily developed.  Nicholas's birthday is his 48th, which happens to
be the age when his father took a fatal jump off of the roof of his mansion.
The trauma of witnessing his father's suicide at a young age haunts
Nicholas, and supposedly it shaped him into the man he's become, but it is
never clear in what way.  Not that anyone really cares--Nicholas is such an
unsavory character that it's hard to sympathize with him as a person, and
why would we want to?  Part of the fun in watching The Game is seeing this
unsympathetic character being dragged through the mud over and over again.
The attempt at audience empathy is at odds with the film's unremittingly
nasty nature.
        A lesson is supposed to have been learned at the end of The Game,
but I'm not at all sure what exactly that is.  But that hardly matters; what
does is that for a little over two hours, David Fincher takes the audience
on a breathless, harrowing ride whose considerable pleasures are measured in
dread and discomfort.

Review for Crash (1996)
In recent years, the buzzwords "bold" and "controversial" have come
less to describe something truly daring than to serve as marketing labels
for unimaginative sleaze (Showgirls or Striptease, anyone?).  On the other
hand, David Cronenberg's Crash, which is finally opening stateside after
causing an uproar across the globe (Great Britain just recently lifted a ban
on the film), is a film that truly earns the "bold" description--it's a
brave, gutsy bit of filmmaking that is never less than fascinating.
This adaptation of J.G. Ballard's controversial novel about sex and
car crashes focuses on just that--sex and car crashes.  James and Catherine
Ballard (James Spader and Deborah Kara Unger) are marrieds who can only seem
to become aroused for each other through consensual extramarital dalliances.
After James has a head-on car collision with one Dr. Helen Remington (Holly
Hunter), killing her husband, he finds a new, exciting fetish.  James and
eventually Catherine are drawn into an underground cult of car-crash
fetishists led by Vaughan (Elias Koteas), a heavily scarred performance
artist who gets off on recreating famous celebrity car wrecks.
Not a lot of plot (there's just about as much dialogue as well), but
there is plenty of explicit sex and carnage, and I can see why so many
people absolutely abhor the film.  The film's unflinching scenes of sex
involving scarred flesh, wounds, scabs, blood, and pain are hard to take and
often shocking--perhaps beyond most people's tolerance levels.  At the
showing I attended, about 1/4 of the audience was no longer there by the
time the closing credits began to crawl.  In fact, one could hear the
auditorium doors swing open during or after each shock scene (read: sex
scene), which was just about every five minutes.
While I was often shocked, I was more fascinated then repelled.  The
thin plot and wall-to-wall sex may sound like the characteristics of a porno
movie, but the execution is not pornographic at all.  The sex scenes are raw
and unglossy, matter-of-fact and totally devoid of romanticism and eroticism
or any feeling at all.  To say that these people "have sex" may be too
pretty a term; they fuck, plain and simple.  And if using that term just
makes it sound like the film has no point, there is one.  James and
Catherine are not just unmoved by each other, but by life in general; their
inability to feel anything makes them, in particular James, seek out a way
to feel.  The film vividly shows how James attempts to feel something
through sexual encounters that grow progressively more dangerous, leading up
to the final dialogue exchange, which, the way I read it, implies the
ultimate point of the film--a haunting conclusion and realization that is
even more unsettling in how it makes logical sense.
The stark, cold elegance in how it all comes together is a tribute
to Cronenberg, whose talent to get under filmgoers' skin is further proven
by the wildly polarized, love-it-or-hate-it reaction to the film.  Despite
the preposterousness of the central idea (I doubt anyone has a car crash
fetish), there are no laughable moments, except perhaps one where the group
is driven to heights of ecstasy while watching crash test dummy footage.
Cronenberg elicits appopriately stoic and morose turns by Spader, Unger, and
Hunter, but the standouts of the cast are the creepy Koteas and Rosanna
Arquette, who plays a crippled crash victim whose leg-braces-and-leather
get-up suggests a twisted (literally) dominatrix.  Cronenberg does fall
somewhat short in setting up the characters; we never get a concrete sense
of how or why Helen, James, or Catherine became so disaffected by the world.
A better understanding of the people may have made the film resonate even
stronger.
 But, as it stands, Crash resonates pretty strongly.  With this,
what you see is not what you get.  All of the sex makes it look like porn,
but no porn film has such strong thematic subtext.  Then again, not that
many films, period, provide so much fascinating food for thought.

Title
Review for Face/Off (1997)
Face/Off (R) **** (out of ****)
        After two mediocre films in the past four years, Hong Kong action
maestro John Woo has finally, truly, arrived in the United States with his
third American feature, the dazzlingly kinetic and wonderfully complex
thriller Face/Off.
        The complicated plotline by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary defies
any brief explanation.  FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta), after years
of obsessive pursuit, finally captures the murderer of his young son
Michael, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), but not before Castor leaves one final
calling card--a large bomb waiting to detonate at an undisclosed Los Angeles
location.  With Castor near death in a hospital, the only way to find out
the bomb's location is from Castor's imprisoned brother Pollux (Alessandro
Nivola), but the task is much easier said than done.  To gain Pollux's
unconditional trust, Sean, through the use of a revolutionary surgery
technique, literally becomes Castor, adopting the criminal's face, voice,
and body.  Needless to say, when the true Castor wakes up from his coma,
things get even more complicated.  The newly free Castor (now played by
Travolta), wearing Sean's face, voice, body, and identity, shakes up the
FBI--not to mention the lives of Sean's wife Eve (Joan Allen, again
impressive) and rebellious daughter Jamie (Dominique Swain)--as the true
Sean (now played by Cage), incognito as Castor, sits in prison.
        What ensues is a most intriguing acting exercise for Travolta and
Cage, who spend most of the movie playing the other's role, not to mention
the other's persona.  It's a tricky, ambitious gimmick, and its success is
absolutely critical to the film--if it fails, so does the whole movie.  But
in the capable hands of two consummate actors like Travolta and Cage, under
the direction of an underrated acting director like Woo, the switch succeeds
brilliantly.  Each actor nails the other's mannerisms and speech rhythms so
perfectly, that it is never difficult to keep track of who's who; one really
does believe that each character is trapped in the other's body.  Travolta
has the showier part, playing the over-the-top, oddball villain with gusto,
but it is Cage who really impresses, striking no false notes in the more
difficult, subtle, emotional role.
        Woo's claim to fame is his delirious action scenes, and in Face/Off
moreso than any other of his American features, he is able to show off his
fresh, wildly imaginative approach to mayhem--elaborate choreography,
standoffs, flashy editing, etc. Woo fans dismayed by the watered-down
pyrotechnics in Hard Target and Broken Arrow will be relieved by the
spectacular action sequences in this film.  One standout sequence, where
Olivia Newton-John's cover of "Over the Rainbow" plays while a defenseless
young boy watches numerous people getting shot to death, is the type of
hypnotic yet unsettling violence-as-poetry moments only Woo can pull off.
        While Woo has made his name as a masterful action director, fans
know that the gunplay is just part of what makes his best HK action films so
great.  They also feature rich characters and abnormally (for an action
film) strong emotion, and what makes Face/Off a Woo film through and through
are these two qualities.  A number of the film's most memorable scenes
aren't elaborate sequences, but quieter, more emotional ones.  Particularly
poignant are moments involving Sean as Castor--when Sean first sees his
reflection as Castor and angrily yells "Fuck you!" over and over again to
the doctors; when Sean fights off tears playacting as Castor during a prison
fight; and, most notably, when Sean/Castor meets the son Castor never knew
he had and loses himself in the moment, hugging the child tightly and
calling him "Michael."  These scenes, whose success is in large part due to
Cage's terrific performance, recall the raw, intense emotion Woo brought to
1990's devastating Bullet in the Head and his masterpiece, 1989's The Killer.
        If there's one thing about Face/Off does not feel completely,
totally John Woo, it is the incredibly sunny ending, which comes complete
with garish white lighting.  But that aside, Face/Off is still a refreshing,
undiluted dose of Woo--an exhilarating, engrossing, intelligent action
thriller that puts all of this summer's other popcorn movies to shame.

Title
Review for Never Been Kissed (1999)
_Never_Been_Kissed_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
The makers of _Never_Been_Kissed_ expect the audience to buy a number of
hard-to-swallow contrivances:
        3)  Co-star David Arquette plays Barrymore's _younger_ brother.
Yet not only do we swallow all this, we eat it up.  And that's because of
the considerable talents of Barrymore.  As I mentioned, it's a stretch to
have this glam gal play a dork.  But the gifted Barrymore is up to the task
as Josie Geller, a lonely 25-year-old copy editor at the
_Chicago_Sun-Times_ whose first job as a reporter is to go undercover in a
high school and find a story.  Not only does this present Josie with the
opportunity to pursue her dream career but a chance to erase her miserable
memories of high school, where her less-than-popular ways earned her
unflattering nickname of "Josie Grossie."  It's hard to imagine Barrymore
being remotely considered gross, but she entirely convinces in both the
flashback scenes where she sports stringy brown hair, pimply makeup, and
braces; and as the better-groomed but still frumpy--with the attitude to
match--Josie.  The character's nerdiness also gives Barrymore the chance to
display a heretofore unseen flair for light physical comedy.
The script by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein is nothing if not formulaic.
In addition to the predictable touchstones of Josie's predictable personal
and professional redemption, the wacky younger sibling (Arquette's Rob),
and the nerdy student (Leelee Sobieski) with whom Josie identifies while
undercover, there's also her dream of finding romance with a guy--or, at
the very least, a "real" kiss (hence the film's title).  When young,
intelligent literature teacher Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan) enters the
scene, there's no mistaking how everything will eventually turn out.  But
by the film's climax, I was surprised at how invested I was in Josie and
her dream, due in no small part to Barrymore's natural rapport with the
audience.  So likable is she that we're willing to overlook the somewhat
discomfiting fact that Sam would be attracted to someone he believes to be
his student.
But Barrymore is not the only person onscreen who makes an impression;
there are some colorful supporting performances by Arquette (even if he in
no way looks like he could be younger than Barrymore), Molly Shannon (as
Josie's libidinous co-worker), and John C. Reilly (as Josie's boss).  That
said, there is no doubt that _Never_Been_Kissed_ belongs to Barrymore and
that if it weren't for her delightful presence, the film would not be, to
paraphrase the tagline, "a thing worth waiting for."  (opens April 9)

Review for Double Team (1997)
Double Team (R) ** 1/2
        Van Damme.  Rodman.  Rourke.  Not the recipe for disaster it appears
to be, thanks to Hong Kong action maestro Tsui Hark (Once Upon a Time in
China), whose brisk, stylish, and inventive direction keeps Double Team
moving fairly smoothly over some turbulent patches--but not smoothly enough.
         One such turbulent patch is the preposterous plot.  Jean-Claude Van
Damme plays Jack Quinn, a CIA operative who, after inadvertently causing the
death of the son of terrorist Stavros (Mickey Rourke), is sentenced to a
top-secret penal colony/think tank for dangerous agents.  After a daring
escape, Quinn hooks up with flamboyant arms dealer Yaz (Dennis Rodman) to go
after Stavros.
        The star of Double Team is not Van Damme nor Rodman but the action,
and Tsui, working with a number of HK luminaries such as Samo Hung, stage
some wild and exciting set pieces.  One early sequence that begins in an
amusement park and ends in a hospital is more exciting and entertaining than
the endings of Van Damme's last four films combined (make that the
_entirety_ of those four films).  Tsui reaches a delirious high with a manic
hotel room fight with a Chinese assassin (Xi Xi Xiong, a vet of Tsui's Once
Upon a Time series) who holds a knife with his toes, a scene that duplicates
the outrageous exuberance of the best HK productions.
        But, as it stands, the great scenes are just that, good parts of a
mediocre whole; the talent of the director is not quite enough to make up
for the minimal ability exhibited by some of the other people working on the
production.  The line of the plot cooked up by Don Jakoby and Paul Mones is
quite hokey, to say the least, and certain plot devices stretch credibility,
even for an action film, most notably how the heroes survive the finale
(oops, did I ruin it for some people?).  Without giving the specifics away,
it makes me wonder just how much a certain company paid for such a
blatant--and, admittedly, creative--product placement.  Even though Van
Damme thankfully has little dialogue to work with, when he does speak, he is
as wooden as ever.  The big question here is whether or not hoopster Rodman
can act, and after seeing the film, I'm not completely sure.  He plays a
variation of his own outrageous personality, which, naturally, he does well
enough; time will tell if he can actually play a character.  The problem
with Rodman, however, is that he sticks out like a sore thumb throughout the
picture; his involvement is obvious stunt casting--a bit too much so.  Not
helping matters at all are the numerous throwaway basketball references
served up by the scripters; they just serve to take the audience out of the
movie even more.
        Double Team is certainly one of Van Damme's best, but in light of
his less-than-sterling body of work, that isn't saying a whole lot.

Title
Review for Felicia's Journey (1999)
_Felicia's_Journey_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Every year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences always seems
to go out of its way to ignore some of the most extraordinary acting
performances of the year.  Likely to earn the dubious distinction of a
snub is Bob Hoskins, who pulls off one of the year's most remarkable
acting feats in writer-director Atom Egoyan's adaptation of William
Trevor's novel.  Like all of Egoyan's work, the unfolds like a mystery,
so I'll keep plot details to their barest minimum.  The Felicia of the
title (Elaine Cassidy) is a naive Irish teen who travels to England to
find the lost lover who left her pregnant.  Whom she ends up finding
instead--or vice versa-- Joseph Hilditch (Hoskins), a gentle catering
manager who offers his help in her search.
As Egoyan employs his usual technique of travelling back and forth
through time, some secrets about Hilditch's past and present surface, and
the relationship between Felicia and Hilditch is in a constant state of
flux--but no moreso than than their individual sense of identity. 
Cassidy is a natural and likable actress, and she makes for an easily
sympathetic audience surrogate.  Although her character figures into the
title, the key journey of the film is that of the tormented Hilditch, and
Hoskins does an astonishing job in bringing this very complex character
to life.  It's impossible to adequately describe the difficulty of his
acting task without divulging critical plot information, but suffice it
to say that Hoskins pulls it off without a hitch.  The film doesn't pack
the forceful emotional wallop of Egoyan's last effort, the
Oscar-nominated _The_Sweet_Hereafter_, but _Felicia's_Journey_ is a
deeply haunting film that only grows moreso upon reflection.

Title
Review for Swordfish (2001)
        God bless Joel Silver.  While a certain nameless compatriot of
his in the blockbuster game has decided to make a misguided, PG-13 play
for Oscar this summer, Silver is sticking to his guns, delivering a
slam-bang, pretense-free, hard-R-rated action thriller.  _Swordfish_ is
the name, and the game is the same: chases, gunplay, the whole nine.  In
short, all the mayhem that one expects from a Silver Pictures
production--and ultimately as nondescript as that description implies.
        Undoubtedly responsible for that routine quality is director
Dominic Sena, who last summer helmed Jerry Bruckheimer (oops, I said his
name) Actioner #366, a.k.a. _Gone_in_Sixty_Seconds_; and writer Skip
Woods.  After all, the mediocre sum is made up of some distinguished
parts--and no, I'm not just talking about those very healthy ones of
co-star Halle Berry, who reportedly received a (well-spent)
half-million-dollar bonus to go topless in the film's (quite
understandably) most-talked-about scene.  Berry, who plays fiery femme
fatale Ginger, is but one of the talented actors that make up the
top-notch core cast, which also includes John Travolta as the bad guy,
evil secret government agent Gabriel Shear; Berry's _X-Men_ teammate Hugh
Jackman as the hero, ace computer hacker Stanley Jobson; and Don Cheadle
as the token fed, FBI Agent Roberts.
        One doesn't watch a Joel Silver production for the stars so much
as the action sequences, and, as mentioned earlier, _Swordfish_ delivers
the goods in that respect.  A massive explosion that takes the "bullet
time" effect to a new level gets the film off to a spectacular start, and
subsequent set pieces live up to this big bang of an open.  These range
from the fairly standard but slickly done (a central car chase/gunfight)
to the truly original and ranging from a foot chase down a cliff to the
big finale featuring an airlifted bus, do the adrenaline-pumping job.
        For a film like _Swordfish_, the plot is merely connective tissue
between the big blow-ups, and at first Woods seems to have done all
that's required of him.  Gabriel gets the sultry Ginger to entice
formerly convicted hacker Stanley into helping them electronically tap
into heavily protected government funds.  Simple enough, but the script
soon gets lost in convoluted, half-baked twists as well as unconvincing,
half-hearted emotional content--namely Stanley's desire to be with his
young daughter, whom he is forbidden to see.  That this subplot, however
ridiculous it is, is not laughable is a testament to Jackman's charisma
and natural sincerity.
        _Swordfish_ practically invites criticism by beginning with
Gabriel directly saying to the camera, "You know what the problem with
Hollywood is?  It makes shit."  I wouldn't go so far as to call
_Swordfish_ shit, but it certainly is  junk in a nice, glossy package,
and doesn't pretend to be otherwise.  While embracing and celebrating its
lowest-common-denominator aspirations make _Swordfish_ a refreshingly
unpretentious and modestly diverting film, it doesn't make it a good one.

Title
Review for Timecode (2000)
Without question, Mike Figgis has to be one of the most boldly
experimental filmmakers working today.  So it would only follow that his
track record in recent years is among the most inconsistent; gambles
wouldn't be labeled as such if they paid off every time.  While he hit
the jackpot with a little no-budget, 16mm effort called _Leaving
_Las_Vegas_, the risks he's taken since haven't been so successful.  Last
year's non-linear, non-narrative _The_Loss_of_Sexual_Innocence_ was
indeed, as he described, his most "personal" film--that incoherent,
indulgent jumble could only make sense to him.  Immediately prior to
that, he tried to do the impossible--turn Joe Eszterhas-originated sleaze
cheese into gold--with _One_Night_Stand_.  It goes without saying that he
couldn't make that work.
It's hard to imagine a more daunting task than that one, but leave it to
Figgis to come up with the ultimate sink-or-swim cinematic proposition,
which now hits the screen as _Timecode_.  The story (or, rather, stories)
being told does not qualify as being revolutionary by any stretch.  What
does, however, is the storytelling--which, to use an overused bit of
hyperbole, is unlike anything anyone has seen before.  And this time
around, the perpetual gambler clearly comes out on top.
Based on the plot alone, the title _Timecode_ would not appear to fit. 
The film follows a number of characters over as they wander in and around
the Ticketmaster building on Sunset Boulevard over a single, continuous
stretch of 93 minutes.  The primary players: Rose (Salma Hayek), a
vivacious aspiring actress; her jealous lover, Lauren (Jeanne
Tripplehorn); boozed-up and drugged-out Alex (Stellan Skarsgĺrd), head of
the motion picture production company Red Mullet (which also happens to
be the name of Figgis' real life production company); and Emma (Saffron
Burrows), his unhappy wife.
These and many other characters crisscross during this 93-minute span,
not unlike the multicharacter epics made familiar by Robert Altman.  This
being a Figgis film, though, there is a radically different spin, which
is threefold: (1) the film unfolds on a screen split into four quadrants,
with each portion following a different character and/or storyline all at
once; (2) each of the four "sub-movies" were shot continuously for those
93 minutes, without any cuts, on digital video cameras; and (3) there was
no set script, only a basic story outline from which the actors entirely
improvised their dialogue and a few storyline turns.  The project being
entirely dependent on the precise timing of the cast and crew, the title
_Timecode_ is only too apt.
A label that perhaps isn't so apt is that of "director" for Figgis. 
This is not meant as a slight on his work; far from it.  His meticulous
direction and arrangement of the individual pieces is more befitting of
the label of "conductor"--very appropriate, considering that Figgis wrote
_Timecode_'s score (as he does with most of his films) and mapped out the
entire work on sheet music paper.  It's nothing short of astounding how
he was able to perfectly sync the four individual pieces, which all
seamlessly interlock at various moments in time and tone.  But even more
impressive is how he makes the four-POV approach feel necessary and not
merely as a shameless gimmick (which it is to some degree).  If
_Timecode_ were edited like a normal film, there's no doubt that some
valuable moments of story and especially performance would be lost.
The latter loss would be most unfortunate, for its the actors that makes
_Timecode_ more than a cold exercise in the possibilities of digital
video technology.  The entire cast--which also includes Holly Hunter,
Leslie Mann, Kyle MacLachlan, Steven Weber, Alessandro Nivola, and a
hilarious Julian Sands (playing a masseur) in smaller roles--appear to be
energized by their high wire task, and their immersion into character
shines through; none of the improvised dialogue sounds awkward, but
rather quite convincing and real.  For example, when Rose tells her
secret lover to not place a piece of food on a surface because "we just
had sex there," it is a natural wisecrack and completely in line with her
character.
As well as the improvisation works as a whole, it does contribute to
_Timecode_'s biggest shortcoming, which is in the story department. 
While what goes on is fairly eventful for a 93-minute stretch of life, as
a self-contained movie, the plot threads are all fairly thin and "made up
as they went along" approach makes for a certain lack of urgency. 
Despite the fresh visual technique, _Timecode_ still suffers from the
same problem of these multicharacter pieces, which is that some plot
threads don't work well as others.  While most characters jump from
quadrant to quadrant as the film progresses and stories overlap, Burrows'
Emma remains fixed in the upper right hand corner, and, not surprisingly,
her storyline is by far the weakest; she has the least amount of
interaction with others, which is the primary catalyst for story
developments and interesting moments of improv.
As much as I enjoyed _Timecode_, I am not eager to see every movie
employ its revolutionary splitscreen storytelling technique; it does take
some getting used to, even when the shifting emphasis of the sound mix
helps direct one to the most pertinent action.  But if Figgis were able
to make something this strange, funny, and exciting to watch without a
script, imagine the possibilities of its use at the service of a more
concrete story.  Unfortunately, that likely won't happen for a long while
(if ever), and in the meantime one can only admire Figgis' audacity, for
going through with such a crazy idea--and his talent, for making it work.

Title
Review for Any Given Sunday (1999)
_Any_Given_Sunday_ is a guy's film.  And I say that not because it's a
football film (though that does play a major part) but because it's an
_Oliver_Stone_ football film--a fact that gives one an idea of how
testosterone-happy this gridiron saga is.
But let this be said: I enjoyed this film.  Maybe it's the testosterone
running through my own veins, but it's hard not to get adrenalized by the
bonecrunching football action Stone stages with maximum intensity.  He has
been criticized with being a bit too busy with the camera, shooting it so
close and cutting so quickly that often the exact plays are unclear.  That
complaint is understandable, but Stone's approach brings the audience into
the game like no other film, giving viewers perhaps the closest cinematic
approximation of the chaotic experience on the field.
While there is plenty of football sequences in the film, there is a reason
why this film clocks in at close to three hours, and that is the
plot--which, quite simply, there is too much of.  Stone, along with writing
collaborator John Logan, want to give an exhaustive look at just about every
aspect of professional football.  In addition to the usual win/loss
issue--which, as the film opens, is gradually falling less in favor of the
Miami Sharks' longtime coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino)--there's the matter of
the up-and-coming hotshot quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx), who is
called on to replace reliable veteran Cap (Dennis Quaid) who is sidelined
with an injury.  That indirectly links to the issue of rushing injured
players' rehabiliation, which the team orthopedist (James Woods) has no
qualms about but his intern (Matthew Modine) does.  Willie's showboating and
penchant for calling his own plays puts him at odds with his teammates
(including one, played by LL Cool J, with an eye to up his own endorsement
stock) and especially Tony, who, in turn, has an even more heated battle of
wills going on with Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz), the Sharks'
ballbusting owner.
There are even other, smaller concerns on Stone's mind, but those cannot
help but get lost in the shadow of the Tony-Willie and Tony-Christina
conflicts.  Granted, these threads are given the bulk of the screen time,
but even if they did not, the forceful performances would have demanded
attention.  That comment is hardly surprising in the context of acting
reliables such as Diaz--who, in five short years, has carved out quite an
impressively eclectic career for herself--and Pacino, but the real
revelation is Foxx, best known for his television comedy work. 
Surprisingly, the comic material he's called on to do doesn't work (though
that's the fault of the script, which saddles him with a silly running gag
where he vomits on the field during every game), but he impresses everywhere
else.  Not only does the convince on the athletic end of his duties, he also
holds his own against Pacino in one particularly memorable verbal
confrontation.  (One can only be glad that the role's original portrayer,
rap impresario Sean "Puffy" Combs, had to back out before filming began.)
Most of the actresses in _Any_Given_Sunday_ do nothing here that would
tarnish their reputations, but one cannot help but notice the glaring
negativity of the female characters in the film.  Christina is a strong,
independent woman; but not only is she a bitch, but she's portrayed as being
in over her head in such a male-driven business.  Christina's mother
(Ann-Margret) is in an alcoholic daze for the entire film.  In one scene,
Cap's seemingly supportive wife (Lauren Holly) is revealed to have a dark
side--only to have that trait magically disappear for the rest of the film,
making her character turn that much more arbitrary.  Tony sometimes enlists
the services of a whore, who is played, appropriately enough, by _Showgirls_
slut Elizabeth Berkley.  The one female character that appears to have some
virtue is Willie's long-suffering girlfriend (Lela Rochon), but even her
steely backbone is softened toward film's end.
But as I said, this is a "guy" picture (and how, given all the bare manhoods
on display in the locker room scenes), and the target audience won't care
once they get a taste of the stunningly staged action and Stone's trademark
way of juicing up the visuals of even the most pedestrian scenes.  Though
it's being released in the thick of awards season and bears a number of
Oscar winners on its team, _Any_Given_Sunday_ is essentially a pure
entertainment vehicle, and taken at that level, it works.
The boxing comedy _Play_It_to_the_Bone_ aims to be a pure entertainment
vehicle, and for one thirty-minute stretch, it succeeds.  The advertising
campaign touts a big match between stars Woody Harrelson and Antonio
Banderas, and in no way does the film disappoint in that area.  Theirs is
one helluva fight, expertly staged, edited, and containing more action than
perhaps all the pay-per-view boxing events held in the last five years
combined.
It is in every other area that this film disappoints--a fact that is made
especially more disheartening considering the writer-director at the helm is
none other than Ron Shelton, Hollywood's premier cinematic examiner of
sports, as seen in films such as _White_Men_Can't_Jump_ and _Bull_Durham_. 
Instead of a sharp satire of a subject ripe for parody--professional
boxing--we get a tedious, unfunny road movie.  Harrelson and Banderas
respectively play Vince Boudreau and Cesar Dominguez, best friends and
has-been middleweight pugilists who are given one final shot at glory when
they're tapped at the last minute to plug a hole in the undercard of a Mike
Tyson bout.  The promoter, sleazy Joe Domino (Tom Sizemore), doesn't throw
in L.A.-to-Vegas plane fare as part of the deal, so Vince and Cesar, along
with Cesar's current (and Vince's former) girlfriend Grace (Lolita
Davidovich), take to the open road.
This trip, which makes up most of the movie, is as long and dry as the miles
of desert the three pass through.  Along the way, Vince and Cesar recount
their past traumas in the ring, the ones that consigned them to obscurity. 
And there are a number of jokes, none of which are particularly funny (Cesar
experimented with homosexuality after his big loss--ha ha ha).  One's hopes
are perked up with the entrance of _Ally_McBeal_ siren Lucy Liu, who plays
drug- and sex-mad Lia, who joins the trio's journey midway.  Alas, not even
she can redeem a poorly-conceived part whose only apparent purpose is to
serve as an excuse to feature a gratuitous sex scene.
Upon arrival in Sin City, _Play_It_to_the_Bone_ jolts the audience awake
with its bravura centerpiece boxing match.  There is never any doubt as to
how this match will end--it's really obvious by the film's design.  That the
bout is still exciting and even nailbiting at times is further proof that
Shelton is a master at cinematic recreations of sports.  The celebrity
cameos in the audience and the presence of the HBO Sports announcing team of
Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, and George Foreman add immeasurably to the
fight's authenticity.
Frankly, I probably wouldn't have minded _Play_It_to_the_Bone_ as much as I
did if it _hadn't_ featured such a terrific sequence.  A completely bad
movie is not a pleasure to sit through, but at least it doesn't come with
the strong sense of frustration that comes with a film that has one great
scene--especially one that shows the potential the whole project had.  But
once the fight is over, it's back down to earth and below with the
uninteresting characters and their uninteresting personal issues, which,
sadly, is the focus of the film.  What it all comes down to is that
_Play_It_to_the_Bone_ is a boxing movie that is not only _not_ about
boxing--it's about absolutely nothing of value at all.

Title
Review for Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn, An (1997)
The wildly overpaid screenwriter Joe Eszterhas has written so many
masturbatory fantasies for the movies that it was only a matter of time
before he himself jacked off onscreen.  And that's exactly what he does in
his absolutely atrocious "inside Hollywood satire," which cannot even
decide what its title is.  Originally billed simply as An Alan Smithee
Film, its "official" title is An Alan Smithee Film Burn Hollywood Burn.
However, in the opening titles, the "An Alan Smithee Film" appears more as
a possessory credit and Burn Hollywood Burn is given the showcase title
treatment, not to mention that numerous sources refer to it as simply Burn
Hollywood Burn.  However, a dash (--) curiously appears after "Film," so
I'll call this self-indulgent waste of celluloid is (An Alan Smithee
Film--) Burn Hollywood Burn.
As far as I'm concerned, Eszterhas is a comic genius.  It takes a certain
gift to not only pen the notorious laff riot Showgirls but to also liken
the lapdancing extravaganza as "a religious experience."  But his comedic
talent only shines through when he's blissfully, hilariously unaware--that
is, when he's dead serious.  Burn Hollywood Burn is written and conceived
as a comedy, and this sorry excuse for a satire just proves the opposite
point: "funny" Eszterhas is not only unfunny, but excruciatingly so.
"Structured" (using that term _very_ loosely) as a mockumentary in three
haphazardly labeled acts (titled "Missionary Position," "Whips and Chains,"
and "Doggie Style"--are we laughing yet?), the film details the disastrous
making of the most expensive film in Hollywood history, the (fictional)
action extravaganza Trio, starring Sylvester Stallone, Whoopi Goldberg, and
Jackie Chan (all of whom appear in cameos--and undoubtedly regret it).  The
film's unctious producer (Ryan O'Neal) wrests control of the final edit
from its director (Eric Idle), who wants his name removed from the project.
 The problem is, his name is Alan Smithee, and Alan Smithee is the
Directors Guild-required pseudonym used for the director's credit whenever
the true helmer wants his name removed.  Apparently at a loss for options,
Alan steals the only existing negative.  What does he do with it?  Three
guesses (if you need a hint, read the movie's title again).
That's it.  There's barely enough plot to fill the worst of Saturday Night
Live sketches, let alone this movie's running time, which, at 83 minutes,
is overlong by at least 82.  But plot, or, for that matter, characters or
witty dialogue, is of little concern to Eszterhas.  Burn Hollywood Burn
only exists to serve Eszterhas's own personal agenda, badmouthing just
about everyone in the business (it's hard to tell who are his friends and
who are his enemies--or is it that he just has no friends?).  While this is
certainly fun for Eszterhas, it is a torturous bore for the
audience--unless there are some people who delight in the figurative sight
of a shaggy, oversexed middle-aged man pleasuring himself.  I'm all for
wicked, mean-spirited humor--when it's funny.  But nothing in Burn
Hollywood Burn reaches even the snicker level.  His idea of a running gag
is identifying all the women as a "feminist" in the docu-style on-screen
labels and repetitive jabs at former Creative Artists Agency head Michael
Ovitz.  And while I have never minded the inclusion of outtakes during a
film's end credits, the blooper reel that closes Burn Hollywood Burn is so
pointless and unamusing that I am seriously reconsidering my position on
the practice.
(An Alan Smithee Film--) Burn Hollywood Burn is now truly an Alan Smithee
film after director Arthur Hiller had his name removed.  The scariest part
of this story is that his original version of the film tested _worse_  than
this final edit cobbled together by Eszterhas himself.  Eszterhas has joked
that this Burn Hollywood Burn is "the most expensive home movie ever made,"
and like all of his intentially humorous comments, it comes off as far from
a joke.  Burn Hollywood Burn plays just as he facetiously said--as an
extended home movie that may be fun for its makers, "stars," and their
friends and family to watch, but a leaden bore to anyone outside the
circle.  Burn, Eszterhas, burn.

Title
Review for Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, The (1999)
_The_Adventures_of_Elmo_in_Grouchland_ (G) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
Everyone who's grown up in front of a television during the last 30
years has memories of _Sesame_Street_--but not just any type of memories:
fond memories.  So it's hard to bear any ill will toward the warm and
cuddly _The_Adventures_of_Elmo_in_Grouchland_, which brings to the big
screen all those familiar faces--human and Muppet--from "where the air is
sweet."  Accordingly, the film is sweet, and technically accomplished. 
But the film is strictly for those who are currently watching the PBS
series: that is, the preschool/kindergarten audience.
And that target audience will eat up this high spirited-musical
adventure as if it were a piece of candy.  Elmo (performed by Kevin
Clash), that fuzzy little red monster known for his ticklishness, loves
his blanket, which he expresses in a bouncy curtain-raising tune.  He
loves it so much that he refuses to let his friend Zoe so much as hold it
for a moment.  It's obvious that Elmo has to learn a thing or two about
sharing, and his lesson comes the hard way when he and his blanket are
sucked into the world of Grouchland, where the evil and greedy Huxley
(Mandy Patinkin) claims the blanket for himself.
Writers Mitchell Kriegman and Joseph Mazzarino and director Gary
Halvorson do make an effort to keep the adult audience (read: parents)
somewhat caught up in the proceedings.  In addition to the regular
_Sesame_Street_ cast (Bert, Ernie, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, Telly,
Cookie Monster, et al. as well as flesh-and-blood regulars Maria, Gordon,
Bob, and the others), on hand as "guest stars" are Patinkin as well as
Vanessa Williams as the Queen of Trash; of course, these seasoned musical
performers are each given a big production number to call their own.  And
very once in a while, a bit of smart dialogue that goes over kids' heads
creeps in.  For example, when Huxley is confronted by the entire
_Sesame_Street_ gang, he says that the look like the types who would
"sing your A-B-Cs and 1-2-3s all day long."
But there's no mistaking that when Bert and Ernie appear periodically to
let the audience know that things will be OK, they're talking to the wee
ones; and that when Elmo turns to the camera and asks for help, he's
asking the kids in the crowd (after all, an audio track of kids yelling
and laughing is tacked on during these moments).  So while the adults may
not exactly be bored during _The_Adventures_of_Elmo_in_Grouchland_, they
may feel left out, making the film a much better bet once it reaches home
video, for it would be more functional as a 77-minute babysitter.

Title
Review for Committed (2000)
"Committed" is what Joline (Heather Graham) is to her deadbeat husband
Carl (Luke Wilson) through thick and thin, for better or for worse. 
Audiences, however, are likely not to feel the same devotion to Lisa
Krueger's stridently offbeat comedy of the same name.
Because of Graham, viewers are likely to at least develop a commitment
to seeing this film through to the end.  An innately likable actress, she
carries the screen with ease in this, her first lead role.  But as the
film progresses, that likability relates less and less to the character
she plays.  Joline's dogged determination to make her marriage work first
comes off as admirable, even as she makes her long road journey from New
York to El Paso, Texas to locate Carl, who runs off without warning after
597 seemingly happy days of wedlock.
Once she's there, Joline shadows Carl not unlike a stalker, keeping
watch over him without making her presence known.  She does, however,
connect with some of the locals, namely Neil (Goran Visnjic), Carl's next
door neighbor, who has designs on Joline; Carmen (Patricia Velasquez),
Carl's new girlfriend--that is, until she meets and befriends Joline; and
Carmen's grandfather (Alfonso Arau), who shares his gift of the mystical
with Joline.
Most of _Committed_'s attempts at humor come from these supporting
characters, namely their quirks.  Neil is an artist who makes pińatas. 
Carmen is a waitress who regularly sneaks a taste of the drinks and
dishes she serves.  Joline's brother Jay (Casey Affleck) is as
commitment-shy as she is committed.  Each one of these characters can be
described as off-center, but little eccentricities can only go so far in
holding an audience's attention--and even less in making them laugh.
And, ultimately, it's up to the peripheral characters and their foibles
to do that job because the lead character becomes such a drag to hang
around with.  Of course, Carl discovers Joline, and after that point her
efforts to hold onto him seem less believable and reasonable.  While one
never comes to the point of hating her, one does stop liking her and
starts to pity her, for she is clearly out of her mind.  This shift is
somewhat expected--after all, rarely do films bearing a double-edged name
not end up relating to both meanings--but that doesn't make the turn
easier to swallow or the film more enjoyable to sit through.
I understand the point Krueger was trying to make--namely, the question
of when devotion becomes obsession, and knowing when to let go.  But in
_Committed_, she has somehow made this potentially provocative subject
boring.

Title
Review for Twilight (1998)
Three, count 'em, three Academy Award winning thespians in prime
form--Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, and Gene Hackman--lead the cast of
Robert Benton's Twilight.  While that would appear to be enough to
distinguish the film, Twilight is curiously missing the one element that
should be a mystery-thriller's stock-in-trade: the element of surprise.
But I suppose Twilight _does_ hold some surprise in its lack thereof.  The
story is not without promise.  Burnt-out former cop, ex-private
investigator, and recovering alcoholic Harry Ross (Newman), has been in the
exclusive employ of married actors Jack and Catherine Ames (Hackman and
Sarandon) ever since rescuing their rebellious young daughter (Reese
Witherspoon, whose character's major contribution is appearing topless)
from an illicit Mexican getaway with an older lover (the ubiquitous Liev
Schreiber) years before.  As the poster's tagline goes, "Some people can
buy their way out of anything.  Except the past."  This dark past starts to
come to light when the cancer-stricken Jack enlists Harry to drop off a
stash of money to a woman at a seedy apartment.  Instead of finding the
woman, Harry finds a gravely wounded, gun-toting man, which leads to the
reopening of the mystery behind years-ago disappearance of Catherine's
first husband.
Benton and co-scripter Richard Russo run into trouble once the set-up is
out of the way.  While they infuse the proceedings with an appealing sense
of humor, and Newman's Harry is an unconventionally self-effacing hero, the
story's would-be twists are obvious and telegraphed, and to call its
resolution a "payoff" is to suggest a satisfaction that it does not
deliver.  Benton and, surprisingly, cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (who
created the gorgeous palette of Krzystof Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy)
botch the atmosphere, which is much too light to create an appropriate aura
of mystery; only Elmer Bernstein's evocative score generates the right
effect.  At the very least the top trifecta of Newman, Sarandon, and
Hackman turn in terrific work, but, again, where is the surprise in that?
It is nice to see three fine actors in the upper reaches of age headline a
major project from such a youth-obsessed industry.  As refreshing as that
fact is, though, it is dispiriting that the film they are given to carry is
as unsatisfying as the dull (and dully titled) Twilight.  (opens March 6)

Review for Isn't She Great (2000)
_Isn't_She_Great_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
        "Great" is unlikely the word to come to the mind of audiences in regards
to author Jacqueline Susann after seeing her depiction in the loose comic
biography _Isn't_She_Great_.  More likely are the words "boorish,"
"brash," "annoying," and "untalented," which effectively sums up where
writer Paul Rudnick and director Andrew Bergman have gone wrong.
        "Untalented" is the key word out of those four.  _Isn't_She_Great_ is
less a biography than an episodic chronicle of the struggling film and
stage actress' (Bette Midler) obsessive pursuit of stardom, which finally
comes in 1966 when she pens the notoriously salacious
drug-addicted-and-sex-mad-starlets-in-Hollywood epic
_Valley_of_the_Dolls_.  I suppose Susann's tale of success is supposed to
be a tribute to the unwavering belief in one's dreams, and in reality it
may very well be.  Yet as presented in _Isn't_She_Great_, it's the story
of someone with no discernible talent achieving a wholly undeserved
success on sheer schmooze power.  And while her catty one-liners
(predictably delivered with gusto by Midler, who can do this character in
her sleep) are good for a chuckle here and there, all the attitude
doesn't necessarily make her more likable.
        What is designed to add some layer of likability is Susann's domestic
life, but it's botched in the execution.  She and her husband and
manager, Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane) have an autistic son, but she has
hardly any scenes to establish a convincing love for the child (Mansfield
has more screen time with him).  Most of all, it's the romance between
Susann and Mansfield that's supposed to be the emotional hook.  However,
while I believed that he loved her (Lane's gentle performance help), I
always got the sense that she didn't love him so much as the help he did
her career.  This could not be more clear in a climactic scene where
Susann and Mansfield, having reached a crisis point, reconcile when she
asks him to be her agent.  The scene is played for laughs, but it hammers
home the point that it's his career aid and not his love that holds the
most importance to her.
        _Isn't_She_Great_ is never less than interesting.  If anything, the
one-liners from Midler and Stockard Channing (a bundle of meow as
Susann's actress friend Florence Maybelle) amuse, as does David Hyde
Pierce's warmed-over Niles Crane act as Susann's uptight editor Michael
Hastings; and the gaudy costume and production design serve as sweet eye
candy.  But bare minimum amusement cannot pass muster for a film that
dares to ask the question _Isn't_She_Great_.  Perhaps the real Jacqueline
Susann was, but one would be hard-pressed to pay the film incarnation the
same compliment.

Title
Review for U Turn (1997)
The words "An Oliver Stone Film" have come to signify a big, bombastic
political statement by the controversial director, so at the opening of
U-Turn, his moderately-budgeted, statement-free thriller, in place of those
words are "An Oliver Stone Movie."  The altered credit is clearly intended
to label the film as an unpretentious, conventional genre piece, but after
seeing the film, I see it as more of a warning.  U-Turn is not a
conventional genre piece, but rather Stone's perception of a genre
piece--which is bizarre, somewhat baffling, but nonetheless intriguing and
warped entertainment for anyone brave enough to tackle it.
This adaptation of John Ridley's Stray Dogs does boil down to a thriller
premise: Bobby Cooper (Sean Penn) on the way to Vegas to settle a debt with
some stolen money, has his radiator hose blow up on him in the
backwater--make that back_desert_--town of Superior, Arizona, where he
becomes part of a murderous triangle with sultry, bored housewife Grace
McKenna (Jennifer Lopez) and her wealthy husband Jake (Nick Nolte).  The
seeds of this conflict are planted early on, but for the space of an hour,
nothing really happens with it; instead, that time is spent with Bobby as
he encounters the various eccentrics about town: flirty hick Jenny (Claire
Danes); her tough guy suitor Toby N. Tucker, a.k.a. TNT (Joaquin Phoenix);
a nameless blind man (Jon Voight) with a dead pet dog; and mechanic Darrell
(Billy Bob Thornton), a grease monkey in the truest sense of the term.  For
this time, Stone appears more interested in the oddball characters than he
is the normal thriller aspects, which would be a problem if the characters
and the situations were not as funny as they are.  Not everything works (a
running gag where Bobby's beverage bottles keep on breaking before he can
drink is especially lame), but for the most part this section of the film
is a demented hoot, galvanized by some great character work by the
supporting players.
With that sideshow going on, the thriller side of U-Turn seems more of an
afterthought, both figuratively and literally; the Bobby-Grace-Jake
triangle and its intertwining murder schemes takes finally centerstage with
about 40 minutes to go.  But Stone gives it his all, using his Natural Born
Killers intercutting visual style to good use here to underscore points in
Ridley's ever-twisting screenplay, and going full-throttle with the sex
and, this being Stone, violence.  Keeping things running smoothly are the
actors, especially Lopez, who shows more depth and versatility with every
film.  In a way, U-Turn feels like two different films--the small-town
satire and the thriller--but what unites them is Ridley and Stone's
pitch-black sense of humor.  The blood-drenched finale may be too gruesome
for most audiences to get the joke, but if you do, it is quite funny in the
most twisted sense.
Many critics have panned U-Turn as a creative cul-de-sac for Stone, but I
think it signifies the opening of a new road for the director to take--the
application of his considerable filmmaking talents to films other than
personal "message" movies.  If the loopy yet fun U-Turn is any indication,
his planned Mission: Impossible sequel should be something to look forward to.

Title
Review for Wild Wild West (1999)
_Wild_Wild_West_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Every summer has one: a film that, from early indications, appears to be
a surefire blockbuster, but finds itself under a billowing cloud of bad
buzz as its release date approaches.  Last year, it was TriStar's
_Godzilla_; this year's whipping boy has been Warner Bros.'s
_Wild_Wild_West_, which arrives on screens in time for the July 4th
weekend amid a flurry of talk of budget overruns and poor insider
screenings.  The good news: the adaptation of the 1960s television series
is far from the excrutiating embarrassment the studio had last year with
the similarly-conceived _The_Avengers_.  The bad news: that fact doesn't
necessarily make this shockingly flat comedy-adventure much better a
movie.
The parts certainly appeared to be in place.  Independence day box
office king Will Smith and another consistently entertaining star, Kevin
Kline, team up as 19th century U.S. government agents James West and
Artemus Gordon, respectively, for Smith's _Men_in_Black_ director, Barry
Sonnenfeld.  Providing the villainy as Arliss Loveless, the
wheelchair-bound, arachnid-obsessed mad genius determined to seize
control of the country, is no less than multiple Oscar nominee Kenneth
Branagh.  And as a final dash of spice, Salma Hayek is on hand to lend
her sexy screen presence as lingerie-clad saloon entertainer Rita
Escobar.
Oddly enough, like a botched chemical equation, these seemingly perfect
ingredients combine into a fizzle.  Together, live wires Smith and Kline
should combust in theory.  But while they do have a couple of moments of
spirited repartee, their overall lukewarm rapport won't make anyone
forget Smith's sterling bond with Tommy Lee Jones in _MiB_.  In fact,
despite his ever-magnetic screen presence, Smith is an ill fit for the
part of West.  He is a versatile performer able to adequately tackle both
drama and comedy, but his limits are tested as a largely deadpan tough
guy.  Not helping matters for him or Kline are the lame one-liners
foisted upon them by the four credited writers (none of whom are worth
mentioning here by name).  For example, following the disposal of a
blade-wielding villain, West not-so-wisely cracks, "No more Mr. Knife
Guy."
The other two above-the-title stars don't fare much better.  The casting
of Shakespearean Branagh as a legless baddie should be a hoot, but he,
like Sean Connery in _The_Avengers_, strains too hard to be outrageously
over-the-top that he drains the character of any sense of fun.  Hayek's
bubbly playfulness could have compensated--that is, if she had anything
remotely resembling an actual character to play.  In her scant screen
time, Hayek is called on to lavish compliments on either Gordon or
(especially) West, model revealing outfits, and flash her buttocks.  What
a progressive role for a woman.
Sonnenfeld was obviously too busy paying attention to _Wild_Wild_West_'s
technical aspects to notice what was going on with his actors.  The
digital effects used to depict Loveless's signature machine of
destruction, the Tarantula, are spectacular and blend seamlessly with the
real-life footage.  Bo Welch's production design imaginatively blends
period Western touches with more modern innovation, particularly in West
and Gordon's  specially-equipped train car, the Wanderer.  As lackluster
as many of the lines get, other details in the production keep the film
watchable.
In the end, that's all _Wild_Wild_West_ is--watchable; not necessarily
awful, yet certainly not good, either.  But mere watchability isn't
exactly what moviegoers are looking for when buying a ticket for
_Wild_Wild_West_; they want some plain old summer movie fun and
excitement.  Unfortunately, Smith isn't the man to give it to them--at
least not this summer.

Title
Review for Shuang long hui (1992)
_Twin_Dragons_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
After Jackie Chan finally scored a U.S. blockbuster with last fall's
American-produced _Rush_Hour_, it comes as no surprise to see another of
Chan's relics from his large vault of Hong Kong productions unearthed for a
stateside release.  What is somewhat surprising, however, is the film
Dimension Films has chosen to release to capitalize on his
stronger-than-ever popularity.  While 1992's _Twin_Dragons_ delivers the
blend of high-flying martial arts and broad slapstick that has become
Chan's trademark, the film, while diverting, remains one of his more minor
efforts.
My guess is that Dimension chose _Twin_Dragons_ because of its precious
gimmick: as the title suggests, Chan plays twins.  Separated at birth, the
identical brothers have had different upbringings and thus live very
different lives.  Boomer was kidnapped by a crook in the hospital and was
found by an alcoholic but loving woman; he grows up into a street-smart
auto mechanic with exceptional fighting skills.  On the other hand, John Ma
remained with their parents, travelling with them to the States, where he
studied music.  Now a world-renowned conductor and classical pianist, he
has returned to Hong Kong for the first time for a concert.
Of course, it is only a matter of time before each brother learns of the
other's existence, and hijinks ensue.  Predictably, these hijinks revolve
around mistaken identity.  Boomer and John's respective female
friends--Barbara (Chan's favorite co-star, the amazing Maggie Cheung,
largely wasted) and Tammy (Nina Li Chi)--can't tell them apart, and neither
can Boomer's goofy (and very annoying) sidekick Tyson (Teddy Robin), nor a
group of baddies with a score to settle with Boomer.
As with all domestic releases of Chan's Hong Kong films, alterations have
been made to _Twin_Dragons_.  In addition to a new soundtrack, featuring
English language dubbing (Chan and, it seems, Cheung redid their own
dialogue) and a more polished score, certain edits have been made.
However, most of the pruning is actually for the better.  One idiotic,
overly cartoonish (yes, even for a Chan film) sight gag involving a doctor
is thankfully gone; and a heavyhanded fantasy scene with John and Barbara
has understandably been excised.  However, it must be said that with that
cut and a brief moment between those two in a car, whatever substance there
was to Barbara's already-thin character has been erased.  In the original
version, Barbara is a lifelong music afficionado with singing aspirations;
in the new cut, she's basically just a woman who happened to be seen at a
karaoke bar.
What did survive the editing process, of course, were the many fight
scenes.  From a wild karaoke bar scene (where Boomer uses everything from
light fixtures to speakers to dispatch bad guys) to the terrific auto shop
climax, the action scenes in _Twin_Dragons_ all display a creative abandon
absent in the entirety of _Rush_Hour_.  Those seeing _Twin_Dragons_ for an
action fix won't be disappointed; however, those looking for a bit more
inspired comedy like myself knows that Chan can do--and has done--better.
Dimension Films also holds American distribution rights to Chan's 
_Drunken_Master_II_, and I'm a bit surprised that the studio didn't release
that one now instead of _Twin_Dragons_.  Funny and full of fantastic
fighting (which would definitely play well in the wake of _The_Matrix_'s
HK-inspired derring-do), it is my favorite Chan film, and would likely
maintain Chan's new stateside heat, if not increase it.  With the release
of the middling _Twin_Dragons_, it appears that Chan's U.S. fortunes will
once again take a downslide--much like they did after the successful 1996
release of his _Rumble_in_the_Bronx_.

Title
Review for Man on the Moon (1999)
_Man_on_the_Moon_ (R) ** (out of ****)
_Man_on_the_Moon_ is one of those films where you walk out of the
auditorium completely flummoxed as to why you feel so empty.  All the
pieces are in place in Milos Forman's biography of the late comedian Andy
Kaufman; it's a polished, well-cast, well-performed, and technically
well-made piece of work.  Upon deeper reflection, however, the initially
mysterious reason is actually quite simple: while those pieces fit
together, the resulting picture is wrong, for _Man_on_the_Moon_ is less
about Kaufman than it is his portrayer, Jim Carrey.
That statement would appear to be a half-step away from a quote one
would find blaring from a newspaper ad or TV commercial:
"_Man_on_the_Moon_ is all about Jim Carrey!"  But when I say that Carrey
dominates the picture, it is not necessarily in a good way.  Yes, he does
a bang-up impersonation of Kaufman's many different personae, from his
career-making role as Latka on the late' '70s-early '80s sitcom _Taxi_ to
his most curious creation, sleazy and boorish lounge singer Tony Clifton
(whom Kaufman insisted was a completely separate person).  The problem is
that director Forman and screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry
Karaszewski, who memorably humanized _Hustler_ publisher Larry Flynt in
_The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt_, do little to make the film appear to be
more than a showcase for Carrey's gift for reverent mimickry.
After a memorably absurd opening that perfectly captures the essence of
Kaufman's distinctly eccentric brand of humor, the creative team quickly
falls into the trap that becomes the film's ruin.  Once Forman stages his
first recreation of bits from Kaufman's standup act, the film sets into
cruise control, offering reenactment after reenactment of keystone events
and performances in Kaufman's career (including his infamous "feud" with
wrestler Jerry Lawler), with few moments of downtime in between and even
less dramatic momentum to string it all together.  There's no denying
that much attention was paid to make sure every note was played exactly
as Kaufman did years ago.  It's just that Forman and crew add nothing
fresh of their own, and the film becomes little more than a series of
rambling, indulgent performance pieces for Carrey.  This becomes all the
more redundant considering that Carrey proves he can capably do Kaufman
schtick within the film's first two minutes; and in seeing him repeatedly
hit the same beats and assume the same postures, one becomes more acutely
aware of the impersonation, of an actor acting.  Perhaps it would be
better said that _Man_on_the_Moon_ is not about Jim Carrey, but Jim
Carrey's _Oscar_bid_.
To Carrey's credit, during the quieter moments, he projects a sense of
vulnerability and humanity.  But not much is done to flesh out Kaufman's
life beyond the spotlight.  While his friendships with creative
collaborator Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti) and manager George Shapiro (Danny
DeVito) are fairly well-established, more problematic is his relationship
with girlfriend Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love).  The two meet on
_The_Merv_Griffin_Show_, where she angrily volunteers to fight Kaufman in
a wrestling match during his infamous anti-woman phase.  Backstage after
the show, he manages to charm her; and in their next scene together, he's
already proposing marriage.  After one more scene involving a wrestling
ring, their relationship is shoved into the background--as is Love, a
vibrant actress who radiates a beguiling warmth here, but it's
squandered.  Similarly, DeVito and Giamatti also impress, but their
efforts clearly lie on the second string as far as the filmmakers are
concerned.
The quieter moments also offer little in the way of insight into who
Kaufman was and why he was that way.  The points covered are easy,
surface ones: he marched to his own drummer; he took pleasure in
subverting audiences' expectations and wishes and in generally pissing
them off; he immersed himself so deeply into his characters that those
closest to him often did not know where the act ended and the real Andy
began--that is, if it ever did.  The last point highlights the difficulty
in making a biography about the notoriously enigmatic Kaufman; did
anyone, let alone those involved in the making of this film, ever get a
handle on who the real Andy was?   Late in the film, when Lynne tells him
with a smile, "There is no real you," one cannot help but agree--at least
as far as this shallow screen treatment goes.  (opens December 22)

Title
Review for Green Mile, The (1999)
_The_Cider_House_Rules_ (PG-13) ***
Of my six years of attending press screenings, the film that has
received by far the largest ovation at the film's end was
_The_Shawshank_Redemption_, Frank Darabont's 1994 adaptation of Stephen
King's prison-set novella.  Exquisitely written, directed, and acted, the
film was one of the most soul-stirring and moving motion pictures to
emerge from this decade, going on to earn seven Academy Award
nominations.  While the film ended up not winning a single statue (a
heinous snub if there ever were one), the film's esteem has only grown
through time, becoming on video the hit the film never was at the box
office.
With such a tough act to follow, it perhaps is no surprise that only now
has Darabont come out with his next film, which, as it happens, is also
an adaptation of a Stephen King prison story.  _The_Green_Mile_ shares a
number of other qualities with _Shawshank_, but one of them is not its
astounding excellence; not many will label the new film as the instant
classic its predecessor was.  But freed from the inevitable comparison,
on its own terms _The_Green_Mile_ is a very poignant and well-told tale,
albeit one not without its flaws.
As in _Shawshank_, the film is set in the past (here, 1935) and focuses
on an unlikely friendship that develops behind prison walls.  However,
the relationship here is between one Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), the head
guard of a stretch of Death Row called "the green mile"; and John Coffey
(Michael Clarke Duncan), a an inmate convicted for the grisly murder of
two young girls.  Bulky and seven feet tall, Coffey certainly looks like
the type who could commit such a despicable crime, but his gentle
demeanor is a complete contradiction--as are the miraculous powers he
appears to possess.
This element of the fantastic is a fairly outlandish twist for a story
set on Death Row, but the turn is completely believable because Darabont
takes the time to strongly anchor his characters in reality.  However, he
takes a bit too much time; while getting to know and spending the time
with such colorful folk as Paul's guard cohorts and Coffey's fellow
inmates is rewarding, it could have been just as so in less the time.
The same can be said of the entirety of _The_Green_Mile_.  Execs at
Warner Bros. made a big deal about how they did not feel the need to cut
down the film after it received remarkably high marks at its first test
screening; even so, some trimming is clearly in order.  Granted, the
three-hour-plus film, bookended by scenes with an aged Paul (Dabbs Greer)
in the present day, consistently holds the interest and has an
unquestionably powerful emotional payoff.  But none of the film's virtues
would have been diminished with some careful pruning of the runtime.  In
fact, a shorter, less leisurely paced version would just bring its
strengths into clearer view.
And what strengths they are, particularly in the acting department. 
Hanks has become such a reliable dramatic performer over the years that a
good performance from him is hardly a surprise; needless to say, there
are no shocks here, and his trademark everyman quality makes him an
instantly likable and relatable lead.  More impressive, however, is the
much-buzzed-about work by Duncan, perhaps heretofore best known for his
supporting role in _Armageddon_.  Not much is learned, if anything at
all, about Coffey's past, but that Coffey is made into a believable human
being rather than a walking dramatic construct has a lot to do with
Duncan's vivid performance.  Just as good as the two leads are the
supporting players, all of whom shine.  Bonnie Hunt acquits herself well
in an uncharacteristically serious role as Paul's devoted wife; newcomer
Doug Hutchison is chilling as sadistic guard Percy Wetmore, as is Sam
Rockwell as psychotic inmate Wild Bill; and Michael Jeter is touching as
inmate Del, who takes in a pet mouse.  Gary Sinise also has a nice cameo
as Coffey's public defender.
With so much talent aboard, from the great cast to the solid storyteller
that is Darabont, perhaps expectations were trumped up to an unrealistic
level.  It goes without saying that _The_Green_Mile_ is no _Shawshank_;
after all, what is?  To give that easy criticism is to discount what
Darabont and his crew have accomplished, which is craft a heartfelt fable
that pushes all the right emotional buttons.  Long before its release,
_The_Green_Mile_ has been touted as the movie to beat at the Oscars, and
while I cannot honestly say that it's the best film I've seen this year,
it would certainly be a worthy winner.
The studio that is usually the one to beat during awards season is the
scrappy Disney subsidiary Miramax, and a lot of their awards hopes are
pinned on _The_Cider_House_Rules_.  An adaptation of John Irving's
highly-regarded novel (Irving also wrote the screenplay), _Cider_ is the
story of Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), an orphan who is raised as protege
to one Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) at St. Cloud's orphanage.  Dr.
Larch hopes Homer will follow his path one day and assume his position at
St. Cloud's, but after the young couple of Cathy Kendall (Charlize
Theron) and Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) stop by to take care of a
private matter, Homer decides to leave with them and experience the
world.  That he does, landing a job on Wally's mother's orchard while Dr.
Larch tries to cope with life without his surrogate son.
_Cider_ tackles a number of issues--abortion being the foremost--and
does so in an efficient manner, never detracting from the main story of
Homer's journey to self-discovery.  The film as a whole is an admirable
and enjoyable one, highlighted by superb performances, in particular
those of Delroy Lindo (as Homer's superior at the orchard) and, in a
surprisingly strong debut, R&B chanteuse Erykah Badu (as Lindo's
daughter).  But while a good film, _Cider_ is far from the great one
Miramax and director Lasse Hallström were hoping it would be, marred by
an unconvincing romantic subplot between Homer and Candy.  The
relationship is a keystone in Homer's growth as a person, but Maguire and
Theron have so little chemistry that it is never once believable.  If
_Cider_ is this year's big Oscar gun for Miramax, ŕ la _Shakespeare_in
_Love_ and _The_English_Patient_, then I don't think that the house the
Weinsteins built will be adding too many more, if any, gold statuettes to
their collection.

Title
Review for Romeo + Juliet (1996)
William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
After watching the first hour of Baz Luhrmann's
Shakespeare-meets-the-20th-century take on the Bard's most celebrated
romance, I was tempted to dismiss it as a complete disaster, one of the
worst of the year.  The main problem can be illustrated by the opening five
minutes.  Following a reading of the opening narration ("In fair Verona...")
by a newscaster, we are treated to a quick-cut montage setting up the scene
(Shakespeare meets MTV).  We then have the opening Montague-Capulet
confrontation, set at a gas station, with each new character introduced with
a freeze frame and an on-screen ID (Shakespeare meets Trainspotting).  Then
bullets start to fly, and we see John Leguizamo (just awful as Juliet's
cousin Tybalt) flying through the air in slow-mo with guns blazing
(Shakespeare meets John Woo).  In short, Luhrmann tries much to hard to push
the '90s angle, so hard that the story is crushed by all the stylistic
weight.  And without the story to guide it, this first half decomposes into
flamboyant, campy excess, complete with a drag musical number (Shakespeare
meets To Wong Foo) at the costume ball where Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio,
solid) and Juliet (an exceptional Claire Danes, the only one of the young
Americans who makes the Elizabethan speech sound natural) meet, and a
revamped, pool-drenched balcony scene between the two young lovers that is
nothing short of a travesty--a shame since DiCaprio and Danes have such a
charming rapport.
But about midway through the film, something odd happened.
Luhrmann, it seems, decided to rein in a horse that was completely out of
control, and lets Shakespeare's tale tell itself without shoving the
contemporary setting down the audience's throat--the visual style isn't
quite as chaotic, and gone is the painfully forced slapstick.  Luhrmann and
co-scripter Craig Pearce do take a few small yet pivotal deviations from the
original text (most notably in the final scene), but  they mostly work. The
result is a '90s-accessible yet respectful adaptation of the final half, and
it does manage to achieve a level of poignancy, though not as strong as
Franco Zeffirelli's  more traditional 1968 version.  However, as well-done
as the second half is, it can't erase that horrible opening hour.  Moreover,
it just shows how impressive and groundbreaking the film would have been if
the entire picture had been like the second half--making William
Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet more  disappointing.

Title
Review for Scream 3 (2000)
As _Scream_ was still raking in the dough at the box office in early
1997, its first sequel was rushed into production, seeing the inside of
moviehouses by December of that year.  Despite its quickie slasher sequel
nature, _Scream_2_ hardly felt like a rush job; it had all the genuine
scares and--crucially--the sharp, self-effacing wit that distinguished
the original film.  Conversely, a little over two years separate the
release of _S2_ and the arrival of the horror franchise's third and final
installment, but despite the longer lead time, _Scream_3_ feels like it
was sloppily slapped together--a pale, watered-down shadow of what had
been a clever and highly enjoyable franchise.
The drop in quality is undoubtedly a result of the absence of writer
Kevin Williamson, whose funny and genuinely scary scripts for the first
two films were every bit as, if not more, responsible for their success
as the taut direction of Wes Craven, who is back on board for _S3_. 
Craven has had enough triumphs in the genre to justify his reputation as
a master of horror, but his rather uneven body of work
(_Vampire_in_Brooklyn_, anyone?) proves that his filmmaking skill cannot
overcome a lacking script--and that's exactly what new _Scream_writer
Ehren Kruger has provided _Scream_3_.
The diminished luster of this go-round is suggested the film's opening. 
Like the first two films, the Hollywood-set _S3_ begins with a killing. 
Following in the footsteps of name brand actresses Drew Barrymore and
Jada Pinkett Smith as the sacrificial starlet?  Kelly Rutherford, best
known as doormat ex-hooker Megan during the forgettable final seasons of
_Melrose_Place_.  Her character's murder is but the first to be linked
with the production of _Stab_3:_Return_to_Woodsboro_, the latest
installment of the horror series inspired by the events that took place
in the first two _Scream_s.  Of course, the murder springs
ever-inquisitive TV news reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette),
whose books inspired the first two _Stab_ movies, into action. 
Naturally, her investigation leads to a run-in and reluctant reteaming
with ex-flame (yes, they once again broke up between films) and former
Woodsboro police deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette)--who, as it happens,
is working on _Stab_3_ as a technical consultant.
So where does this leave our long-suffering heroine, Sidney Prescott
(Neve Campbell)?  Contrary to what had been reported by some media
outlets, _S3_ does _not_ have Sidney settled in Tinseltown and actively
pursuing a career in acting; instead, she is quite understandably living
in quiet seclusion in Northern California, working out of her home under
a false name as a phone-in crisis counselor.  It goes without saying that
the ghost-masked killer's antics eventually force Sidney down to SoCal
and the scenes of the crimes, but what is surprising is how long she is
left on the sidelines.  With so little given to do, it's almost
understandable that Campbell phones in her performance.
Campbell isn't the only _Scream_3_ principal who appears less than
interested.  The newlywed Arquettes' performances also have a been-there,
done-that air about them; their characters' increased time in the
spotlight does not equate with fresh directions for them.  (I take that
back--vain glamourpuss Gale's new wrinkle is her inexplicably dowdy
appearance.)  Then again, Kruger fails to take the _Scream_ franchise
itself in any new directions.  Although the hyper-reflexive,
inside-Hollywood premise opens up even more possibilities for
self-parody, the satirical in-jokes disappear within a half hour.  (The
mid-film exception is the brief return, by way of videotape, of film geek
and _S2_ victim Randy Meeks, played with usual--and sorely missed--spark
by Jamie Kennedy.)  For the most part--aside from a laugh or two provided
by Parker Posey, quite amusing as the bitchy actress who plays Gale in
the _Stab_ films--_Scream_3_, while never boring, isn't all that funny,
nor is it all that scary.  No "suspense" scene comes close to touching
the first _Scream_'s stunner of an opening or _Scream_2_'s nailbiting car
escape scene.  It's quite telling that the one scene in _Scream_3_ that
is remotely spooky is the only one that survived from Williamson's
original outline for the film: Sidney wanders onto the _Stab_3_ set, and
she is confronted with the spitting image of her former home--which, in
turn, brings to mind all the ghosts of her past.
To be fair, Craven's work here feels watered down itself.  In an
apparent reaction to the Columbine murders, the violence and gore is
significantly toned down; there's nothing in _S3_ that comes close to the
bloodbath that closed the first film.  While the amount of blood is not
necessarily proportional to the amount of excitement generated, in
putting a damper on the violence, Craven seems to have also put a damper
on his reckless, anything-for-a-scare abandon.  He appears to be walking
on eggshells throughout the entire film, making extra sure that he
doesn't so much as nudge the envelope.  With Craven always holding
himself in check, it's little wonder that many of the intended shocks
don't.
During the course of _Scream_3_, it is mentioned more than once that in
the final act of a trilogy, all bets are off.  The suggestion is that all
the previously set rules will be broken, and that any surprising twist
and turn is possible.  _Scream_3_ indeed boasts a big twist, but the
dismaying turn has nothing to do with the story: the film turns the
franchise into the type of conventional slasher saga that the first two
films so effectively lampooned.

Title
Review for Almost Famous (2000)
_Almost_Famous_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        The term "almost famous" could apply to star Billy Crudup, who
has been touted by Hollywood as one of those "next best things" for the
past few years--yet hasn't even come close to making a popular
breakthrough.  _Almost_Famous_, writer-director Cameron Crowe's hotly
anticipated follow-up to his Oscar-winning _Jerry_Maguire_, has been
touted as the film that will finally make the top-billed Crudup a major
star.  Alas, he's going to have to remain "next best thing" for at least
a little while longer, for once again he has been nipped in the bud--if
the movie is anyone's "coming out" film, it's co-star Kate Hudson's.
        Which is not to say that Crudup doesn't do a superb job; in fact,
there isn't a single bad performance from anyone in the ensemble.  And
although a rock band on the cusp of fame in the 1970s lies at the center
of _Almost_Famous_, the film is not necessarily "about" the obvious
parallel with its cast of young, on-the-verge stars.  While they
certainly do contribute a large part to the film's success,
_Almost_Famous_ lingers in the memory because of the universality of
Crowe's semi-autobiographical tale.
        That fact is somewhat surprising considering how specific Crowe's
seriocomic story is.  William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is a precocious
15-year-old high school senior in 1973 who somehow manages to get a
writing assignment for _Rolling_Stone_ magazine and finds himself on the
road with Stillwater, an up-and-coming rock 'n roll band fronted by lead
singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee) and moody lead guitarist Russell Hammond
(Crudup).  Whatever manner of tension goes on within the group--Jeff's
jealousy of the attention lavished upon the hunkier Russell; their wild
party ways--will be nothing new to anyone who's watched a single episode
of VH1's _Behind_the_Music_ (or seen or read anything about the classic
rock 'n roll lifestyle).
        Thankfully, details such as that are not the main concern of
Crowe; rather, it is the universal search for a sense of belonging and
community.  This is not only embodied by William--an overachiever who had
skipped a few grades in school, he's been a perpetual loner and
outcast--but also by Penny Lane (Hudson), a self-proclaimed "Band Aid"
that travels with the band and gives them, in particular Russell, private
shows of support.  Setting her kind apart from groupies, says she, is her
genuine love of the band's music (and of Russell).  Of course, she's just
kidding herself, and her journey to self-realization--and her
non-romantic (though he has other ideas) friendship with William--makes
the film's most affecting thread, bolstered by the terrific rapport
between and work of Fugit and especially Hudson, who stands to gain the
most heat off of the film with her natural and poignant performance.  Not
to be outdone, however, the two old pros in the cast, Philip Seymour
Hoffman (getting all of Crowe's best lines as the legendary rock critic
Lester Bangs) and Frances McDormand (a lock for an Oscar nod as William's
well-meaning but prying mother) steal all their respective scenes.
        Crowe loses his way a bit in the final third, in effect making
the film a step or two away from true excellence; a comical near-death
experience that prompts a rash of soul-baring confessions is contrived,
and the film's tidy wrap-up is a fizzle.  But the themes and emotions of
the piece resonate; _Almost_Famous_ may be almost great, but that's more
than enough.

Title
Review for Maximum Risk (1996)
The latest vehicle for the Muscles from Brussels, Jean-Claude Van
Damme, is as nondescript as the tacked-on title (the film was originally
titled the more appropriate, though less slam-bang, The Exchange), fairly
devoid of any distinct personality that would set it apart from other action
flicks.
The film starts off promisingly enough, with Van Damme being bumped
off within the first five minutes, after a well-staged and edited chase.
Unfortunately for acting scholars everywhere, good ol' Jean-Claude
resurfaces as the twin of the dead J-C, and he heads off to New York to
investigate the murder and the life of the brother he never knew he had.
Needless to say, said brother was involved with some shady characters--the
Russian Mafia--and he soon finds himself running for his life with his
brother's lover (Natasha Henstridge, reduced to playing a typical action
movie "girl" after her maneating turn in Species) in tow.
Like 1993's Hard Target, Maximum Risk marks the American debut of a
celebrated Hong Kong action director--in this case, Ringo Lam, famous for
his On Fire trilogy.  Unfortunately, Lam isn't able to energize the
miniscule goods delivered by Larry Ferguson's tired, unexciting script.
Lam's visual style is a lot grittier and less flashy than John Woo's (the
flashiest bit is a shot that follows the path of a bullet), and thus the
script's flaws aren't concealed too well.  He does, however, competently
stage what brief snatches of action there are, though none of it is
especially exciting.  Van Damme also comes off slightly worse than usual,
appearing quite stiff, which is likely Lam's inadvertent doing.  In his Hong
Kong work, he usually coaxes understated performances from capable actors
such as Chow Yun-Fat;  Van Damme, on the other hand, isn't much of an actor,
and as such his attempted "subtlety" comes off as just plain wooden.
As junky as Hard Target was, its flash was enough for Hollywood to
take notice of John Woo.  I'm not so sure how Hollywood will treat Ringo
Lam.  He's a talented filmmaker, but without Woo's stylistic flair and a Van
Damme vehicle worse than Hard Target under his belt, his future Tinseltown
prospects, unfortunately, don't look too bright.

Title
Review for Perfect Blue (1997/I)
Mima, a member of the bubblegum girl singing trio Cham, decides to quit
the group in pursuit of other interests (think Ginger Spice)--namely, an
acting career.  As Mima's pursuit of a new professional image takes a
much darker turn--she lands a role that calls for a violent rape scene;
she poses for nude photos--people around her start to die bloody deaths,
and the spitting image of her former pop idol self begins to haunt her. 
Could it be the work of a shady-looking fan who watches her every move? 
Or is she imagining the whole thing, including her break from Cham?  Or
is her entire showbiz career a figment of fantasy?
_Perfect_Blue_ is the latest entry in the hot new subgenre of the
thriller, the "what is reality?" thriller.  The crucial difference with
this Japanese import is that it is an animated film, and with the freedom
of animation comes a more effective blurring of fantasy and reality; when
the world is entirely drawn, everything can plausibly be real.  Director
Satoshi Kon takes his time to get this adaptation of a novel by Yoshikazu
Takeuchi off the ground, bringing to light the horrendous acting of a
number of the English-speaking voice actors, but by the film's end,
_Perfect_Blue_ has become an exciting and haunting exercise in
psychological horror.

Title
Review for Highlander: Endgame (2000)
_Highlander:_Endgame_ (R) * (out of ****)
        I had never seen a _Highlander_ film nor an episode of its
spinoff television series in my life, so perhaps I'm not exactly not the
most qualified viewer to review the fourth and presumably (hopefully?)
final big screen installment of the cult sci-fi franchise.  However,
having little to no familiarity with the material perhaps makes me an
ideal person to review it--after all, part of an ongoing series shouldn't
only play to the converted.  But that, in a nutshell, is the problem with
_Endgame_.  If you're a fan, there could be something here to keep you
involved and maybe leave you satisfied.  But for newcomers, it's an
uphill battle to make sense of it all and just about impossible to care.
        _Endgame_ is a landmark film for the _Highlander_ faithful for it
brings together for the first time Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert),
the lead character of the features _Highlander_, the critically lambasted
_Highlander_2:_The_Quickening_, and misleadingly titled
_Highlander:_The_Final_Dimension_; and Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), the
star of the syndicated _Highlander_ television series.  As anyone can
deduce from the character names, Connor and Duncan are related, but
exactly how will only be clear to followers of the series.  A throwaway
line of exposition to spell out their relationship is never offered in
_Endgame_.  The film's poster says that they are brothers, and while the
two use the term "a brother" once or twice, the context suggests a more
figurative meaning (as in close friend) than a literal one.  This idea
supported by one flashback scene where we see the two's first meeting;
Connor has to introduce himself to Duncan by name.  If the two were true
brothers, shouldn't they know who the other is?  (OK, maybe they were
separated at birth, but no explanation is ever offered.)
        Maybe I'm dwelling a bit too long on that point, but that's just
about the only thing in _Endgame_ that commands any thought; the plot is
your basic good guys versus bad bit.  Duncan and Connor are Immortals,
but that doesn't mean they are indestructible; Immortals can be killed by
decapitation, and when one is killed, the slain's lifeforce is absorbed
by his or her killer (called a "quickening").  The baddie that Duncan and
Connor must do battle with Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne, criminally
overacting), the Immortal whose father was responsible for the death of
Connor's mother some four centuries ago.  But as is standard issue for
stories like this, Jacob--having well over 600 quickenings to his
credit--is far more powerful than Duncan and Connor combined.
        But this fairly simple story is muddled by the murky _Highlander_
mythos, which scripter Joel Soisson makes no effort to make accessible to
non-cultists.  There is some mumbo jumbo about the Watchers (who, as the
name implies, watch Immortals); every now and again a character or two
that perhaps would be recognizable to those familiar with the series pops
up.  So while non-fans can be superficially amused by director Douglas
Aarniokoski's fast-paced assemblage of basic set pieces--a swordfight
scene here, a gratuitous sex scene there--none of it really adds up to
anything of worth.
        _Highlander_ fans, of course, would argue otherwise.  The film's
numerous flashbacks, which show the heretofore unseen shared past of
Connor and Duncan, should alone be enough to get them worked up, while
the uninitiated will struggle to comprehend what the big deal is all
about.  _Highlander:_Endgame_ is a film made for the devotees, and I'm
sure I speak for everyone else when I say that I am more than happy to
simply let that select group have and keep it.

Title
Review for 101 Dalmatians (1996)
Part vamp, part tramp, and all camp, Glenn Close's wonderfully
wicked turn as the ultimate Disney diva, Cruella DeVil, powers 101
Dalmatians, the studio's new live-action version of its beloved 1961
animated feature.  Problem is, unless you are age 10 or under, there is
little else to hold your attention for the entire 98 minutes.
Producer-screenwriter John Hughes and director Stephen Herek's take
on the tale of the fur-loving DeVil, the spotted puppies from whose coats
she wants to make herself a coat, and the married owners (Jeff Daniels and
Joely Richardson) of the dalmatian parents Pongo and Perdy is actually quite
faithful to the original animated feature.  Viewers familiar with that
version will be pleased with how well some scenes survived the
cartoon-to-live-action translation, such as Perdy's stressful delivery of
her 15 puppies and the apparent stillbirth and ultimate revival of the pup
Lucky.  While the dogs and other animals do not talk this time around, the
communication between the animals does come through and is easily
understood.  The "twilight bark," where Pongo barks into the night sky to
summon other animals to search for his and Perdy's stolen puppies, still
makes for a striking scene without the spoken exposition that frames it.
And Close's Cruella matches her animated counterpart's nastiness and then
some; her hilariously over-the-top turn is sure to influence drag queens
everywhere.
Hughes and Herek's failure, however, lies in their incessant
indulgence in broad slapstick, which comes off as labored and not especially
funny.  The scene where Daniels's Roger and Richardson's Anita first meet in
the park is cheapened by too many pratfalls and dives into water.  Also, the
puppies' big escape from their barn prison has been needlessly punched up by
Home Alone-type slapstick involving the two dognappers, Jasper (Hugh Laurie)
and Horace (Mark Williams).  Herek not only tries evoke that fluke Macaulay
Culkin phenomenon through the cartoony violence, but also through the duo's
appearance--Jasper sports a beard and curly hair a la Daniel Stern's
bumbling burglar, and Horace is a shorter, heavier fellow wearing a hat not
unlike Joe Pesci.  Worst of all, the slapstick gives Close the short end of
the stick, for in the end Cruella's campy edge takes a back seat to the
physical punishment she takes from the animals--having a boar fall on her,
being dumped in mud and molasses, etc.
Nonetheless, the film entertained the kids at the big critics'
screening, and I'm sure children around the world will have fun with 101
Dalmatians, which is exactly what the folks at Disney had in mind.  But with
the preordained success of this underachieving animation-to-live-action
translation, this Disney animation fan cannot help but worry about what
possibly ruinous adaptation ideas the studio has in mind for its other
cartoon classics...

Title
Review for Sixth Sense, The (1999)
_The_Sixth_Sense_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
If a movie is only as good as its ending, then _The_Sixth_Sense_, with
its boffo, perception-altering shock of a conclusion, should be one of
the best thrillers in recent years.  But that closing stroke of genius
cannot add a much-needed layer of interest and urgency to the talky tale
that serves as the twist's slow-going lead-in.
That said, that bulk of _The_Sixth_Sense_ plays better than its
individual parts would lead one to believe.  Bruce Willis stars as
psychologist Malcolm Crowe, and the last time he played someone in the
field of psychoanalysis was in that notoriously unerotic thriller
_Color_of_Night_.  Malcolm is also happens to be a _child_ psychologist,
meaning Willis plays most of his scenes alongside a boy... not unlike
last year's boring flop, _Mercury_Rising_.
The key difference with _The_Sixth_Sense_ is that writer-director M.
Night Shyamalan has given Willis and his cast something to work with. 
While that "something" isn't always effective, it is certainly sturdier
than those other films.  A year after getting shot by a former patient
(who then shot himself), Malcolm takes up the case of Cole Sear (Haley
Joel Osment), a troubled 8-year-old who exhibits some of Malcolm's
deceased patient's symptoms.  But the root of Cole's trouble goes beyond
divorced parents and an unstable home: he has the ability to see ghosts.
While _The_Sixth_Sense_ does feature its share of shock sequences where
Cole is visited by (often bleeding) phantoms, Shyamalan's main interest
isn't necessarily scaring the audience.  He seems more concerned with the
troubled relationships: that between Malcolm and Cole and the more
troubled ones between Cole and his mother (Toni Collette) and Malcolm and
his wife (Olivia Williams, sadly underused).  The performances,
particularly Osment and the versatile Collette's, go a long way in making
the drama believable and sometimes affecting; Willis even comes off well
in an uncharacteristically subdued turn.
The problem lies with Shyamalan's plodding pacing.  The film follows a
predictable rhythm of having a long series of patience-testing
dialogue-heavy scenes followed by a "shock" scene, momentarily jolting
the audience back into alertness before sent back into a haze by the next
series of dialogue scenes.  Shyamalan would have been wise to do some
much-needed tightening to his script, which could have lost a number of
these talky scenes to no ill effect whatsoever.
Shyamalan must be given credit, however, for writing and pulling off
such a terrific surprise ending.  It's a testament to his skill as a
director that the important clues he drops are barely noticeable en route
to the conclusion, which consequently does not feel like a cheap gimmick;
in fact, it nicely ties together the weightier themes the film addresses.
 Alas, as inspired as it is, the twist is too little, too late, and
cannot completely redeem the far less interesting remainder of
_The_Sixth_Sense_.

Title
Review for Boiler Room (2000)
The title _Boiler_Room_ is not meant to be taken literally, of course,
but this smart tale of greed in the stock trade indeed reaches a
figurative boil.  First-time writer-director Ben Younger sets his film
off like a rocket, propelled by his and his eager cast's energy and
skill.  It's unfortunate that the boiling point is reached prematurely,
but while the film's forceful momentum wanes, it never completely fades
away.
Greed is hardly a fresh topic for a movie, in particular in the Wall
Street arena; most notably in Oliver Stone's _Wall_Street_. 
_Boiler_Room_ cannot help but recall that film, and Younger even cheekily
references it in one amusing scene; he also pays homage to what can be
deemed the film's other "cross" (as in "_Wall_Street_ crossed with..."):
_Glengarry_Glen_Ross_, written for the stage and screen by David Mamet. 
_Glengarry_'s mantra of "always be closing" is used by the young sharks
working for _Boiler_'s J.T. Marlin, a scrappy brokerage firm that
aggressively pushes stock shares on unsuspecting buyers.  Little do these
buyers--and, for that matter, the sellers--know that the shares are in
companies that do not exist.
When the film's main character, hungry "boiler room" (so named for the
pressure cooker atmosphere and cramped space where the brokers work)
up-and-comer Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi) discovers that little fact,
_Boiler_Room_ turns into a fairly pedestrian morality play; will he do
the right thing and take the firm down, or will he just stick with it and
the illegally-obtained money that comes along with the ride?  The
film--and Younger--is clearly at their best in the early stages, which
drops the audience, along with Seth, in the thick of the high-stakes
action.  Younger clearly did his homework on the subject, and the
authenticity he brings to the dialogue and the atmosphere makes for
riveting viewing.
When taking a few steps away from the office, Younger runs into some
problems.  Much like how the story's turn is rather humdrum, so is the
central conflict between Seth and his judge father (Ron Rifkin);
ne'er-do-well Seth--who, before hooking up with J.T. Marlin, ran a card
casino out of his apartment--wants nothing more than to win his uptight
father's respect, and this bit of melodrama is  too contrived to
completely work.  Nonetheless, this subplot is kept watchable and
somewhat involving by the performances of Rifkin and especially Ribisi.
Ribisi rebounds nicely from a terrible 1999 (Remember _The_Other_Sister_
and _The_Mod_Squad_?  Hopefully not), providing a likable and magnetic
anchor in the often frenzied goings-on.  Everyone in the cast makes a
lasting impression; standing out in the boiler room are Vin Diesel and
Nicky Katt as more seasoned hotshots, and Ben Affleck is wonderfully oily
in the small role of the firm's head recruiter.  As J.T. Marlin's
receptionist, Abby, the talented--if underused--Nia Long is able to come
off as more than the film's token injection of estrogen and Seth's love
interest.
While the energy of _Boiler_Room_'s story peters out, the actors never
let up, picking up the slack, carrying the film down the home stretch. 
_Boiler_Room_ cannot be called a completely successful debut for Younger,
but it is an indisputable triumph for the young acting talent on board.

Title
Review for Postman, The (1997)
THE POSTMAN (Warner Bros.) 
Starring: Kevin Costner, Will Patton, Larenz Tate, and Olivia Williams. 
Screenplay: Eric Roth and Brian Helgeland, based on the novel by David Brin. 
Producers: Jim Wilson, Kevin Costner, and Steve Tisch. 
Director: Kevin Costner. 
MPAA Rating: R (violence, profanity, nudity, sexual situations) 
Running Time: 170 minutes.
Reviewed by Michael Dequina.
Rating: no stars out of **** (awful)
Even though the $180 million 1995 sci-fi adventure WATERWORLD was
dismissed by critics and audiences alike, producer/star/11th-hour
"director" Kevin Costner managed to emerge from the wreckage unscathed,
with most of the blame and discredit going to the film's true helmer, Kevin
Reynolds.  Costner won't be getting away so easily this time--his new
sci-fi epic, THE POSTMAN, is even more disastrous, and no one is to blame
but Costner himself, who also directed.
Granted, a little slack must be cut for THE POSTMAN, which comes to the
theatres with three strikes against it.  First of all, it is Costner's
first directorial effort since his popular, Oscar-winning 1990 debut,
DANCES WITH WOLVES.  Second, the film's title is also associated with a
dearly beloved recent film, the excellent 1995 Italian import IL POSTINO.
Third, the film's postapocalyptic setting is more than a little similar to
that of WATERWORLD--and that's not exactly a film audiences want to be
reminded of, to say the least.
But Costner, is, after all, an Academy Award-winning director, and one
would think he could come up with something decent--or, at the very least,
coherent.  But even the modest hopes of the latter are dashed almost
immediately with the expository opening narration, which apparently
explains the second American Civil War that led to the country's demise.  I
say "apparently" because I could not make sense of any of it--exactly what
happened and how it led to America becoming a wasteland in the year 2013.
It would help if Costner or screenwriters Eric Roth and Brian Helgeland
(working from the novel by David Brin) threw in more expository dialogue
along the way to clarify things.  No such luck.  Once the narration ends,
pity the poor viewer who could not digest it... which is just about everyone.
Shortly after that, we are introduced to Costner's nameless drifter, who,
about an hour into this ridiculously long (170 minutes) film, lends the
film its name.  After escaping a military training camp held by the evil
General Bethlehem (Will Patton, who is actually quite good), who rules the
anarchic American Northwest with an iron fist, the drifter finds an
abandoned mail truck and enters a small Oregon town under the guise of a
postman.  All he wants is a couple nights worth of food and lodging, but in
pretending to be an official of "the restored United States of America," he
becomes the living embodiment of hope for the oppressed people.  Soon he
finds himself with numerous disciples who revivethe former grand American
tradition of... mail delivery, and, in turn, bringing to life the hopes of
a restored nation--which, of course, does not sit well with General Bethlehem.
I do not know what is more laughable--the barebones plot synopsis or its
actual execution.  The story is ridiculous, but it would have appeared at
the very least less so if Costner did not play everything with such a
straight face.  He is apparently trying to make a Profound Statement about
war and American society, but it is impossible to take anything seriously.
Consider the horrendous dialogue: for example, Roth and Helgeland's idea of
witty romantic repartee is having the Postman often say "You're really
weird!" to a young wife (Olivia Williams) who wants to bear his child.
Consider this most heavyhanded, idiotically symbolic plot development: the
woman bears the Postman's daughter, who is named--yes--Hope (get it???).
Most of all, consider the most ludicrously preachy moment of the film, this
most unintentionally hilarious scene that occurs near the end: The Postman
stops a follower from killing a man, saying, "There will only be peace!"
So far, not too bad, but then the masses of people surrounding him look at
each other, nod, and say, "Yeah."  The audience rolls in the aisles (that
is, provided they are still awake); the last trace of dramatic credibility
flies out the window.
The heart of THE POSTMAN's problems is the title character himself.  We
are supposed to be inspired by the Postman and the society he has
inadvertently created, but he is such an unsympathetic, self-serving
character that we never once believe that he could attract a single
follower, let alone hordes.  And the lies he concocts are so ludicrous, not
to mention poorly delivered, that it's a wonder how anyone believes any of
it.  He only seems to grasp the importance of his actions and influence
with about thirty minutes to go, but this "changed" Postman comes off as a
satirical, reverse stereotype of the American postal worker--one who
denounces all violence, urging everyone to live in peace.
Usually when I think a movie is bad, I at least concede that it may be
worth the while of loyal fans of the star or director.  Not so with THE
POSTMAN.  Die-hard Kevin Costner fans may find themselves changing their
mind after seeing this overlong, lumbering mess, a miserable failure in
just about every respect.

Title
Review for Mars Attacks! (1996)
        After his excellent 1994 biopic of the worst filmmaker of all time,
Ed Wood, it was only a matter of time before Tim Burton made an Ed Wood
movie of his own.  Two years later we have Mars Attacks!, a darkly humorous
sendup of and affectionate homage to B-grade sci-fi epics of the 1950s.
        Like all alien invasion epics, Mars Attacks! follows a pastiche of
characters and how they cope with a hostile Martian invasion.  The players
include the President of the United States (Jack Nicholson); the First Lady
(Glenn Close) and First Daughter (Natalie Portman); a stuffy White House
scientist (Pierce Brosnan); the skirtchasing Presidential press secretary
(Martin Short); a ditzy fashion reporter (Sarah Jessica Parker); her vain
reporter boyfriend (Michael J. Fox); a Kansas teen (Lukas Haas) and his
grandmother (Sylvia Sidney); an alcoholic Vegas casino owner (Nicholson
again); his New Agey wife (Annette Bening); an
ex-boxer-turned-costumed-Vegas-casino-attraction (Jim Brown); his estranged
wife (Pam Grier); a rude gambler (Danny DeVito); and, yes, Tom Jones himself.
        With so many characters on the canvas, the Burton and screenwriter
Jonathan Gems understandably take a while to establish them and get the
picture going.  But after all the setup, it is quite disappointing that a
number of the characters do not have the most satisfying of payoffs
(Nicholson's casino owner in particular).  But unlike a certain alien
invasion picture that came out in the summer, all of these original, wacky
characters do make their distinct impression; none blend into a forgettable
blob.  And unlike that nameless blockbuster, even the aliens are allowed to
show some personality--the sight of them vaporizing buildings and people
with maniacal gusto while saying "Don't run!  We are your friends!" says it
all.  It's that quirky Burton mix of camp and macabre humor that makes Mars
Attacks! so much fun; ironically, that's also what will probably end up
hurting the film at the box office, like it did Ed Wood.  The imagination
and wit behind oddly clever way the humans end up getting the better of the
Martians will likely be lost on most mainstream moviegoers; in fact, most
people would probably call it a letdown.
        What will not be lost on mainstream viewers, however, is the
impressive visual effects of the piece.  The diminutive green Martians with
enlarged brains are  certainly a sight to behold, and the massive
destruction they cause is all done very convincingly.  The most brilliant
touch is how the effects, as elaborate and expensive as they are, do not
betray the look and feel of, say, a Plan 9 from Outer Space.  The flying
saucers don't have any visible strings holding them up, but they do
resemble, as Parker's character puts it, "flying hubcaps."  When people are
vaporized, we see their flesh and other entrails dissolve into the air, but
their whole skeletons are left behind--in either green or red, no less.
Martian brains explode but not without spurting green sludge.  Some crucial
effects involving Parker and Brosnan could not have been accomplished in the
1950s, but the idea behind them is something you would see in a movie from
that time, albeit done with a straight face.  Burton also doesn't resist the
use of that staple of Ed Wood movies, stock footage.  This attention to
detail makes Mars Attacks!, its satiric qualities notwithstanding, a knowing
and loving tribute to those cheesy B-movies.
        After the phenomenal success of Independence Day, I am not so sure
that Mars Attacks! will be able to find an audience even half the size of
that film's.  It's not that the films are too similar, far from it; it's
just that the majority of moviegoers, looking for something straightforward
like an ID4, won't quite "get" the unconventional Mars.  But anyone who is
willing and able to buy into the film's eccentricities is sure to enjoy Mars
Attacks!.

Review for Star Trek: First Contact (1996)
[Note that followups are directed to rec.arts.movies.current-films and
rec.arts.movies.startrek.current only, not to rec.arts.sf.movies.  -Moderator]
Star Trek: First Contact (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
        Anyone familiar with the series of Star Trek movies knows of the
"even-odd pattern"--the even-numbered installments of the series are good
while the odd-numbered ones are, well, not-so-good.  The pattern continues
with the new Star Trek: First Contact, an energetic sci-fi adventure that
(coincidentally?) is the eighth entry in the hugely popular series.
        In this first Trek feature to feature only cast members from the
late Star Trek: The Next Generation television series, Captain Jean-Luc
Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the rest of the 24th-century crew of the
Starship Enterprise--Commander Will Riker (Jonathan Frakes, who also
directed), android Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Cmdr. Geordi LaForge
(LeVar Burton), Lt. Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates
McFadden), and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis)--travel back to
21st-century earth while doing battle with the Borg, a race of cybernetic
beings that share a collective mind with the Borg Queen (Alice Krige).  The
Borg intend to alter history and assimilate all of humankind into their
race--starting with the earth-orbiting crew of the Enterprise and a 21st
century stowaway (Alfre Woodard).
        This is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize Trekkers
everywhere and engage everyone else, but, unfortunately, it only makes up
the Star Trek half of the script by Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore.  The
other half of the title--First Contact--refers to a subplot that takes place
on 21st-century earth, where Riker, Troi, and LaForge meet legendary
scientist Zephram Cochran (James Cromwell), who is about to embark on the
first warp speed flight in human history, which directly leads to the first
contact with extraterrestrials.  While this story does tie into the main
plot and pays off interestingly in the end, it is nowhere near as involving
or exciting as the Borg battles on the Enterprise.  Not helping matters is
the tiresome Cochran character, an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts
out funny but becomes too one-note after a while.
        In the end, though, the First Contact subplot doesn't detract from
the enjoyment of the film as a whole.  The story is typical sci-fi fantasy,
but the conviction of the cast--most notably the always-phenomenal
Stewart--makes you believe and care.  Frakes, making his feature directorial
debut, keeps the action swiftly rolling along and delivers the action goods,
even upping the violence a notch (this is the first Trek film to bear a
PG-13 rating) to greater effect.  ST:FC has a bigger budget than the last
Trek outing, the middling Star Trek Generations, and it definitely shows on
screen--the production design and especially visual and makeup effects are
outstanding (in particular those involving the Borg Queen).  Braga and
Moore's mostly sharp script will please both Trek devotees and the rest; the
references to the Borg storyline in the TV series, the continuity with the
previous film (e.g. the ongoing saga of Data's emotion chip), and a fleeting
Star Trek: Voyager crossover will make Trekkers squeal with delight, but
such points are made easily accessible to those less familiar to the Trek
mythos.
        Paramount was reportedly worried about the staying power of its Trek
franchise with the Next Generation cast now carrying the helm.  Based on the
entertaining success that is Star Trek: First Contact, I'd say the studio
has nothing to worry about (at least not until this cast retires and the
crew of the wan Star Trek: Deep Space Nine takes over...).

Title
Review for Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. (1999)
_Mr._Death:_The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Fred_A._Leuchter,_Jr._ (PG-13) **** (out
of ****)
Errol Morris cements his reputation as the premier contemporary
documentary filmmaker with this fascinating look at Fred Leuchter, a
Massachusetts engineer whose specialty is tending to execution equipment.
 What begins an oddly endearing account of an odd man and his odd
occupation becomes gradually darker--and even more absorbing--as
Leuchter, being an "expert" on gas chambers and the like, is recruited by
Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel to travel to Auschwitz and conduct a
forensic analysis the "presumed" gas chambers.  His report--in which he
effectively "proves" that the Holocaust never happened--becomes a
cornerstone of Holocaust deniers' beliefs while most others, in
particular Jewish activists, are repulsed by his actions.
Morris leaves no doubt in the audience's mind that Leuchter is wrong; as
a counter to his claims, he interviews a number of experts on the
Holocaust and science who completely debunk Leuchter's "findings" by
covering every way his research went wrong.  But instead of taking the
easy approach of labeling Leuchter as being an evil person and exploring
just how bad he is, Morris is more interested in showing how a normal
person can fall into the trap of doing and believing in such morally
questionable things.  One does not necessarily like Leuchter by the end
of _Mr._Death_, but one is able to at least somewhat understand him and
why he thinks the way he does--a deeper step that makes the film as
exceptional as it is.  (opens December 29)

Title
Review for Happiness (1998)
No other film released this year is likely to cause the storm of
controversy that Todd Solondz's _Happiness_ is most certain to stir.  A
bold, provocative look at some truly miserable lives in American suburbia,
this beyond-black comedy offers some queasily subversive laughs--while at
the same time shocking and, more than likely, offending everyone.  It is a
brave, brilliantly realized piece of work, one that will be debated about
for years to come.
_Happiness_ follows a broad Altman-esque cast of characters, all of whom
are linked somehow, as they attempt to find happiness--or some reasonable
facsimile thereof.  At the core of this canvas are the three Jordan
sisters: Joy (Jane Adams), Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), and Trish (Cynthia
Stevenson), daughters of long-unhappily-marrieds Lenny (Ben Gazzara) and
Mona (Louise Lasser).  Down-on-her-luck Joy, miserable after losing
boyfriend Andy (Jon Lovitz), attempts to find fulfillment teaching at a
school for adult refugees, where she meets Vlad (Jared Harris), a shady but
alluring Russian.  Sophisticated Helen is a successful writer, but she
yearns for raw emotional authenticity, which she attempts to find through a
twisted pas de deux with an obscene phone caller--whom she doesn't know is
her slobby but completely innocuous neighbor Allen (Phillip Seymour
Hoffman), who, in turn, is quietly pursued by his other, far less glam
neighbor, Kristina (Camryn Manheim).  Trish, married with three children,
appears to be the one sister who has her life together.  Little does she
know that she doesn't.  Her shrink husband Bill (Dylan Baker) has a problem
suppressing certain sexual impulses... involving prepubescent boys.
The pedophilia subplot is certain to be _Happiness_'s most controversial,
but not because the issue is taken lightly; in fact, it is the only story
in the film that is _not_ played for laughs.  What makes the topic even
more disturbing to viewers (myself included) is the brutal honesty with
which it is handled.  Bill is certainly a monster, but Solondz and Baker
refuse to let the viewer off the hook, infusing the character with genuine
humanity.  The rub is, Bill knows and admits that he's a monster--it's just
that he cannot control his urges.  His problem culminates in a
heartbreaking and, at the same time, highly upsetting scene where he comes
clean, with blunt frankness, about his actions to his son Billy (Rufus Read).
This gravely serious subplot may seem out of place in a film that is a
comedy (albeit one that is seriously warped), but its inclusion is
justified.  Sick as he is, Bill is the only character who actually finds
"happiness" during the film, freely indulging in his taboo desires.
Everyone else fails to come close, and while their misery can be and often
is laughed at, the pain is real.  The sight of dumpy Allen calling random
women in the phone book in hopes of getting off is funny, but his
loneliness is genuinely sad; the same is the case with Kristina, who is
often shrugged off with a giggle as a pathetic loser.  Joy tries to do her
best to do good, but her often comical failures are failures nonetheless,
much like how Helen's ridiculous desperation, is, in the end, desperation.
Solondz described his film as being about "how people always struggle to
make a connection."  Everyone in _Happiness_ is searching for some type of
connection, but, in fact, they are already connected with everyone
else--through their collective isolation.  The issue, then, is not
connection with others, but connection with themselves.  Bill comes to know
who and what he is, and for one brief moment, he is happy.  By the end of
the film, one wonders if everyone else--or oneself--will ever be able to
follow suit.

Title
Review for Anna and the King (1999)
_Anna_and_the_King_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
Fox chose an ideal year to produce and release Andy Tennant's lavish
non-musical treatment of the oft-told true story of the meeting of minds
between King Mongkut (Chow Yun-Fat) and English schoolteacher Anna
Leonowens (Jodie Foster) in 1862 Siam.  After all, it can only look good
compared to this year's other screen version of the tale, Warner Bros.'
woefully misguided animated adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's
venerable musical _The_King_and_I_.  That fact aside, however, _Anna_,
while taking the occasional dramatic misstep, is a pretty solid drama on
its own terms, boasting beautiful pageantry, smart political intrigue,
and a convincing rapport between leads.
While they are a unit for most of the film, taken individually, Foster
and Chow have differing degrees of success.  Foster is good, but her
performance is a big step down from her Oscar-caliber work of recent
years (last in 1997's _Contact_), hampered by an accent that is only
sporadically convincing.  Chow, on the other hand, is terrific.  Although
he made a name for himself in Hong Kong as an action star, the King is
the first American role where he really shows the key to his appeal--it's
not necessarily the gun(s) in his hand(s), but his suave charm and
charisma.  He's also a solid dramatic actor; not for nothing do his
legendary collaborations with John Woo have such a potent emotional
impact.  Anna may get top billing in this retelling, but it's the king
who commands the show.

Title
Review for Charlie's Angels (2000)
_Charlie's_Angels_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
It's easy to dismiss _Charlie's_Angels_ as mindless trash--but to do so
is to not understand the joke.  Make no mistake, this big screen revamp
of the small screen "jiggle" action-adventure series _is_ every bit the
slab of cinematic junk food it appears to be; the twist is that director
McG, producer-star Drew Barrymore, and co-stars Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu
set out to make it that way.  That said, getting the joke does not
necessarily entail complete enjoyment of the picture, which grows equal
parts fun and frustrating.
_Charlie's_Angels_ is a high-energy production, and it's impossible to
not get occasionally caught up in the infectious atmosphere of
over-the-top action-adventure and self-aware, campy humor.  The bouncy
tone is set by the curtain-raising action sequence, which is as
preposterously exciting as any Bond opener; and its terrific main titles,
which are a wonderfully cheesy homage to the original Aaron Spelling TV
series (and the rest of its action ilk in the '70s).  Called on to
provide the charm to carry the film the rest of the way are Diaz,
Barrymore, and Liu as Natalie, Dylan, and Alex, respectively--"an elite
crimefighting group" in the employ of the never-seen but always-heard
millionaire Charlie (once again voiced by John Forsythe).
Alas, if only high spirits and the right attitude were enough to make a
feature film.  There is the matter of a little thing called a script, and
the one by a reported 17 writers (the only ones receiving screen credit
are Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon, and John August) feels as cobbled together as
the crew that created it.  The Angels, with Charlie's bumbling go-between
Bosley (Bill Murray, sadly wasted) by their side as usual, are hired to
solve the kidnapping of a computer tycoon (Sam Rockwell); its rather
speedy resolution opens up a set of unforeseen problems.  That, in a
nutshell, is _Charlie's_Angels_' story.
But it's not what the film is _about_.  That designation goes to the
assorted set pieces hung onto the clothesline of plot to either wring
laughs from the audience or viscerally excite them.  Given that the three
leads all have experience in comedy and are action neophytes, it's
surprising that _Charlie's_Angels_ is more successful in the latter area.
 For this, the trio and especially McG owe a large debt to fight
choreographer Yuen Cheung-Yan (brother of _Matrix_ and
_Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_ action maestro Yuen Woo-Ping).  The Hong
Kong brand of wire-enhanced martial arts (a major deviation from the TV
series, for staunch gun opposer Barrymore nixed the use of any firearms
in the film) works especially well in the over-the-top context, and the
stars are all game--in particular Diaz, who is given a large share of
non-wire fight scenes and more than holds her own.
Then again, Diaz is the clear standout in all areas of the film. 
Barrymore and Liu clearly enjoy themselves and amply fill the sexiness
requirement, but only Diaz is given much of anything to do.  Her Natalie,
a hopeless dork with ridiculous delusions of coolness, is the only Angel
that develops into a real character (all we glean from the others: Alex
is brainy; Dylan is... well, she looks good, doesn't she?).  Her comic
scenes, especially those with Luke Wilson (as the requisite love
interest), are the most memorable in the film.
In fact, Diaz's comic scenes are the only ones that fully work, which
points up the film's key problem: not knowing when to stop with the
comedy.  Her gags are extreme, but they don't push too far; the same
can't be said for a lot of others.  For example, a great sight gag
involving Alex's boyfriend's (Matt LeBlanc) bullet-riddled trailer home
that's just outlandish enough is ruined by a needless extra step.  I can
understand McG and the army of scribes' perceived need to go all out, but
a bit of moderation would have gone a longer way in a film that's already
outrageous by basic concept alone.
So with the smiles the film provide come about as many groans,
eventually overtaking the latter as it wears on.  The joke behind
_Charlie's_Angels_ is indeed an amusing one, but it simply grows old more
quickly than it should.

Title
Review for Niagara, Niagara (1997)
Niagara Niagara (R) *** (out of ****)
        Bob Gosse's Niagara Niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of
young-lovers-on-the-road movies.  Wild Marcy (Robin Tunney) and calm Seth
(Henry Thomas) meet cute, literally running into each other while
shoplifting at a local store.  A mere couple of scenes later, the two
embark on a journey to Toronto from their small, unnamed American town in
pursuit of a rare doll that Marcy desperately wants.  Along the way, true
love inevitably blossoms.
        What sets Niagara Niagara apart, though, is that Marcy is afflicted with
Tourette's Syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and
vocal tics.  Tunney, displaying an acting range not hinted at in the
teenage witch thriller The Craft, delivers an astonishing performance that
won her the Best Actress prize at last year's Venice Film Festival.  To
term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery;
Tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability, which
makes her depiction of Marcy's illness--which often causes her to act
violently--that much more convincing and tragic.  She and the nicely subtle
Thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry.
        Their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way, mostly the
fault of writer Matthew Weiss.  A detour involving a kindly widower
(Michael Parks) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching
halt, and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist (Stephen Lang) is
highly unbelievable.  But these missteps do not blunt the power of Tunney's
bravura turn, which carries Niagara Niagara to a level of poignance it
would not have otherwise achieved.  (opens March 20)

Title
Review for 200 Cigarettes (1999)
_200_Cigarettes_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
As much fun as they may be to make, and as interesting as the assembled
talent often is, multi-story and -character ensemble films have a built-in
problem: all the stories and characters never hold the same amount of
interest.  While Robert Altman has shown that it is possible to come up
with a consistently engaging pastiche of narrative threads, more often than
not similar efforts by others come out wildly uneven.  Such is the case
with Risa Bramon Garcia's somewhat amusing but underachieving
_200_Cigarettes_.
Within the loose narrative framework of people finding their way to one
big Big Apple bash on the Eve of 1982, Garcia and screenwriter Shana
Larsen, both first-timers, do come up with one completely successful plot
thread: that of platonic friends/roommates Kevin (Paul Rudd) and Lucy
(Courtney Love).  Kevin is depressed over his recent breakup with
performance artist girlfriend Ellie (Janeane Garofalo, as hilariously
acerbic as ever) and the fact that it's also his birthday, and Lucy wants
to cheer him up and make him forget about Ellie--in any way she can.  Right
off the bat one can see where this storyline will lead, but the terrific
pairing of Rudd and Love makes it never less than involving.  Love is
particularly impressive, displaying a warmth and vulnerability that is as
delightful as it is surprising; her performance here--in tandem with her
breakthrough work in _The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt_--reveals Love to be the
real thing, actingwise.
Unfortunately for Garcia and Larsen--and even worse for us--there is one
huge dud of a storyline involving two Long Island teens, Val (Christina
Ricci) and Stephie (Gaby Hoffmann), who get lost on the mean streets of the
East Village.  Along the way, they hook up with a couple of punk rockers,
Tom (Casey Affleck) and Dave (Guillermo Diaz).  It's always nice to see
Ricci onscreen, but her talents are wasted in this story, which is an
absolute waste of time--it's not funny; there is no payoff whatsoever; and
only two of the characters play notable roles in Garcia and Larsen's grand
scheme.  Making this thread even more unbearable is a truly grating
performance by Hoffmann, who is actually given more to do than Ricci.
The other stories in the hodgepodge that is _200_Cigarettes_ are varying
degrees of just-passable, with some of the actors turning in standout
character work.  Dave Chappelle is amusing as a slick cabbie who taxis many
of the characters around town.  Ben Affleck is a hoot as an incredibly
square bartender who catches the attention of many a patron, most notably
starving artist friends Caitlyn (Angela Featherstone) and Bridget (Nicole
Parker).  Martha Plimpton is nicely neurotic as the big party's harried
hostess, but she's saddled with a tedious thread revolving around her ex's
(Brian McCardie) sexual inadequacy.  But the one person, other than Love,
who makes the strongest impression is newcomer Kate Hudson, who plays the
purehearted Cindy, who spends her New Year's Eve with Jack (Jay Mohr), whom
she doesn't know is quite the ladies' man.  Hudson is effortlessly likable
and charming, but Garcia and Larsen too often have her engage in cheap
pratfalls and other acts of clumsiness.
 "Clumsy" can also describe the way Larsen chooses to close out the film,
with a hamfisted monologue about how people "hide" behind cigarettes--as if
she were somehow required to explain her title (as if the virtually
non-stop lighting and puffing weren't explanation enough).  Yet as
heavy-handed as that touch and statement is, it also pretty much sums up
_200_Cigarettes_: what's good about it is hidden behind the smoke of
mediocrity.

Title
Review for Blue Streak (1999)
Martin Lawrence is a talented comedian, but too often he gets stuck with
creaky material, such as the script to the mediocre action comedy
_Blue_Streak_.  Lawrence plays Miles Logan, an expert jewel thief who
poses as a cop to retrieve a diamond he unwittingly hid at a
then-under-construction police station years ago.  Far-fetched
fish-out-of-water hijinks ensue, with Miles somehow getting promoted up
the ranks and showing the ropes to a wet-behind-the-ears partner (Luke
Wilson).  There are a handful of funny lines and situations, but Lawrence
is always better than the script, his charisma and infectious energy
shining through, even during some forced set pieces such as one scene
where Miles does an unfunny dance dressed as a pizza delivery boy.
Like _Blue_Streak_, once-great NBA rebounder Dennis Rodman's latest bid
for big-screen stardom, _Simon_Sez_, is actually an _intentional_
comedy--but one quickly wishes that the film were played as straight as
the advertising.  That's because the sight of Rodman earnestly growling
such tough guy lines as "It ain't... _over_" as Interpol agent
extraordinaire Simon is infinitely more hilarious than the excrutiating
"comic relief" provided by his perpetually punchlining sidekick (Dane
Cook) and a couple of goofy "cybermonks" (don't ask).  With such sheer
ineptitude onscreen--get a load of the obvious blue screen compositing
and phony-looking visual effects--it's amazing that this hack job didn't
go straight to video.  But that's just as well--it's probably already
hitting shelves as you read this.

Title
Review for Drowning Mona (2000)
Say what you will about Ben Affleck, but one cannot deny that he has
screen presence.  The same, however, cannot be said of his younger
brother Casey, who is given his biggest opportunity to step out of his
Oscar-winning sibling's shadow in _Drowning_Mona_.  But his flat
performance isn't the only thing that contributes to this dark comedy's
overall lack of color.
_Mona_ is an ensemble film, but Affleck's character, mousy landscaper
Bobby Calzone, is given the greatest amount of focus.  He is a suspect in
the murder of the ironically named Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), who was
anything but dear to Bobby, who was involved in a business partnership
with Mona's dim son Jeff (Marcus Thomas).  Then again, Mona wasn't dear
to anyone but herself, hence just about everyone in her small town of
Verplanck, New York is a suspect: Jeff; Mona's philandering husband, Phil
(William Fichtner); Phil's mistress, Rona (Jamie Lee Curtis); and Bobby's
fiancée, Ellen (Neve Campbell), who happens to be the daughter of Police
Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito), the leader of the murder investigation.
Among this group are a couple of interesting characters.  Making notable
impressions are Campbell, who displays a surprising comic flair; Will
Ferrell's mere facial expressions are good for a laugh as a creepy
undertaker;and Midler, who is deliciously nasty in her few flashback
scenes.  But much attention is paid to those considerably less
interesting, namely Bobby, who is made even more bland by Affleck's
opaque, inexpressive performance.  It's not that he had to hype up his
portrayal; after all, DeVito does a quietly effective job in his
straight-arrow part.  It's just that he forgets that even the most
"normal" of characters still has some personality, and he doesn't give
Bobby any.
But Affleck isn't entirely to blame the drowning of _Mona_; writer Peter
Steinfeld and director Nick Gomez do a good (bad) enough job of it on
their own.  There a few funny scenes and a biting one-liner here and
there, but they are outnumbered by the groaners.  Steinfeld does pack in
a couple of interesting twists along the way, but his story is ultimately
done in by a too-contrived resolution, which ends what is supposed to be
a dark comedy on an overly pat and sunny note.  Then again, the latter
can be said about the entire film; it's supposed to be dark and
mean-spirited, but it never goes beyond a somewhat dark shade of grey;
perhaps the PG-13 rating held more sinister--and possibly
funnier--instincts in check?
Regardless of the rating, however, one would expect a comedy to be
funny.  _Drowning Mona_ is that, but only on occasion.  The rest of the
time, the film relies on bad wigs (sported by nearly every cast member)
and references to cheap Yugo cars for laughs.  It's hardly surprising,
then, that _Mona_ goes down in a heap long before Mona takes her plunge
from a cliff; the real fatal crash happened back in the writing stage.

Title
Review for Light It Up (1999)
_Light_It_Up_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
_Light_It_Up_, written and directed by Craig Bolotin, is different from
most urban dramas in that in emphasizes ideas more than violence; in
fact, the quantity of the latter is surprisingly low for its genre.  But
it's too bad that not many other things about the film are quite so
distinctive.
Bolotin's setup, however, is rather interesting in its complication.  A
popular teacher (Judd Nelson) at Lincoln High is put on suspension after
taking his class off-campus without permission.  His students, led by
star b-baller Lester (Usher Raymond) and senior class president Stephanie
(Rosario Dawson), confront the principal (Glynn Turman) in protest,
indirectly leading to a physical struggle between artist Ziggy (Robert
Ri'chard) and the on-campus cop, Dante Jackson (Forest Whitaker).  A
bullet is fired; Jackson is wounded in the leg; and Lester finds himself
with the gun, holding the cop hostage.  Soon, Lester, Stephanie, and
Ziggy, along with drug dealer Rivers (Clifton Collins Jr.), gang member
Rodney (Fredro Starr), and pregnant outcast Lynn (Sara Gilbert)--now
dubbed "the Lincoln 6"--find themselves being listened to for the first
time.
Neglected but largely well-meaning inner city youths come into a
position of power.  It's a promising premise, but before long
_Light_It_Up_ devolves into cliché.  The hostage talks his captor into
giving him a drink of water, only to attempt physical harm.  The popular
girl and the outcast set aside their differences and learn to cooperate. 
Most annoying, however, is Lester's "dark secret," which points to a
deeper personal grudge against the police--as if there needed to be added
justification for his rebellion.
Raymond's popularity as an R&B crooner is undoubtedly the justification
Bolotin had in casting him as the lead, but that proves to not be a good
enough reason.  Raymond does a fairly adequate job (though his emotional
scenes are rather strained), but he doesn't have the forceful,
charismatic presence needed to convince as the ringleader of a group of
such headstrong individuals.  It's not terribly believable that Raymond's
Lester can keep the hotheaded Rodney in check.  Dawson has the strongest,
most composed presence of the six, and she gives Stephanie a steely yet
vulnerable confidence that Raymond's Lester clearly lacks.
Thankfully, Bolotin's wrapup to _Light_It_Up_, while not completely free
of convention, resolves the film's issues in a realistic and satisfying
manner.  There is no idealistic happy ending; hard lessons are learned by
all, and through them comes an inspiring sense of hope.  If only all of
_Light_It_Up_ lived up to that conclusion.

Review for Art of War, The (2000)
_The_Art_of_War_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        Sneaking onto screens relatively unheralded by its distributor
during the dog days of summer, _The_Art_of_War_ would appear to be one of
those dumpers/writeoffs with which the studios traditionally clog late
August.  But for a good portion of its running time, director Christian
Duguay's spy thriller is slickly, efficiently put together, featuring
more than a few effective action sequences.  Which makes it all the more
unfortunate that, in the end, the film slips off the rails.
        Wesley Snipes lends his usual blend of charisma and conviction to
the role of Shaw, a deep cover United Nations operative who is introduced
as he engages in some Bond-like derring-do at a millennium party in
China.  Little does he know this will be his introduction to some of the
key players in a conspiracy in which he later finds himself entangled. 
Six months later, a container filled with dead Chinese refugees is found,
and soon after, a Chinese ambassador is assassinated.  Accused of the
latter, Shaw goes underground and, with the help of a U.N. translator
(Marie Matiko), sets out to find the truth, which turns out to be more
complex and far-reaching than he imagined.
        As can be easily gleaned from the plot synopsis, Wayne Beach and
Simon Davis Barry's script for _The_Art_of_War_ is hardly groundbreaking,
and, in all honesty, neither is Duguay's direction of it.  But he does
make the material quite watchable.  The action scenes, many of which are
designed to showcase Snipes' martial arts skills, are decently handled,
and he comes up with some interesting stylistic flourishes, particularly
in one scene where Shaw studies the apartment of a murdered colleague;
the use of flashbacks proves to be an economical storytelling device--in
this instance, at least.
        While Snipes remains convincing throughout the entire film, the
film itself doesn't.  As is the case with these conspiracy thrillers,
there are late-inning twists abound, but the logistics render the already
cloudy plot even murkier.  The sense of overkill that ultimately does in
the script spreads to other areas in the film, including some of the
actors (whose names I won't divulge in the interest of protecting plot
points).  But no one gets infected more than Duguay.  His kinetic visuals
soon get out of control; the flashback device that had been employed well
in the early going gets overused, and for no apparent purpose.other than
to show off.
        Even if _The_Art_of_War_ didn't lose its way in the end, it still
wouldn't be a great film; it's much too standard a genre picture to be
something truly special.  But considering how right the film feels most
of the way, it wouldn't have been too hard for Duguay to make a
reasonably satisfying formula film.  Instead, _The_Art_of_War_
illustrates how easily one can drop the ball down the stretch.

Title
Review for Hunchback of Notre Dame, The (1996)
Last summer, Disney made a bold move by tinkering with its
tried-and-true formula for kid-friendly animated features and releasing the
underrated, surprisingly serious and more adult-oriented Pocahontas.
Believe it or not, Disney has made an even bolder move with its ambitious
34th full-length animated feature, The Hunchback of Notre Dame.  Startlingly
adult and with an  oppressive dark tone, Hunchback is also quite simply the
most brilliant and poignant animated feature to come from Disney since
1991's Oscar-nominated Beauty and the Beast.
This adaptation of Victor Hugo's classic novel tells the tale of
Quasimodo (voice of Tom Hulce), the deformed bell-ringer of the Notre Dame
cathedral in Paris.  Locked in the bell tower since his youth by the cruel
Minister of Justice Frollo (Tony Jay), Quasimodo yearns to be "out there"
among the people.  He gets his chance during a town festival and instantly
falls in love with sultry gypsy dancer Esmeralda (Demi Moore), who befriends
the lonely Quasimodo but becomes enamored with the gallant captain of the
guard Phoebus (Kevin Kline).
Sounds like typical Disney fodder--an outcast hero, a beautiful
heroine (who's also an outcast), a truly hissable villain, and much romantic
longing and angst.  But Hunchback is the most atypical of all Disney
animated features.  Bravely, wisely, directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise
(who also did Beauty) and screenwriters Tab Murphy, Irene Mecchi, Bob
Tzudiker, Noni White, and Jonathan Roberts, while adding a dollop of humor
in the form of three wisecracking gargoyle companions (voiced by Jason
Alexander, Charles Kimbrough, and the late Mary Wickes), have not
extensively sugarcoated Hugo's dark tale.  The result is shocking--and
incredibly potent.  Right in the prologue, we see Frollo murder Quasimodo's
mother and attempt to drown the infant Quasimodo in a well; from then on,
the audience becomes witness to the unspeakable abuse Quasimodo receives,
from the townspeople, who crown him king of the festival only to mock him;
to more from the embodiment of cruelty that is Frollo, who continuously
belittles his appearance and his worth as a person--in song, no less.  What
makes it all the more heartbreaking is that Quasimodo sings along with him.
For all the lighthearted moments--and, unlike in the nearly totally straight
Pocahontas, there are quite a few--there's no escaping the atmosphere of
dread and sadness, from the intricately detailed, cold, imposing walls of
Notre Dame and the shadows that engulf each corridor to the always sad,
often crying face of Quasimodo and the ominous music.
Alan Menken's score is definitely his most daring for an animated
feature, adopting an appropriate Gothic sound full minor chords and choirs
chanting in Latin.  Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz also push the
envelope in terms of subject matter, too: in the eerie dirge "Hellfire," the
pious Frollo expounds on his hypocritical, consuming lust for
Esmeralda--"Hellfire/Dark fire/The fire in my skin/This burning/Desire/Is
turning me to sin."  Not exactly kids' stuff; in fact, you'd be pretty
hard-pressed to find a song that children will find especially singable.
The two lighthearted tunes, including a comic showcase for the gargoyles
called "A Guy Like You," aren't nearly as catchy and infectious as an "Under
the Sea" or "Be Our Guest."  But there are a couple of gems here--namely,
the two central ballads: the traditional protagonist "I Want" song, "Out
There"; and Esmeralda's haunting prayer "God Help the Outcasts," definitely
the most spiritual and transendent tune to emerge from an animated feature.
More than any other Disney animated feature, Hunchback lends itself to a
second life as a Broadway show; the opening number, "The Bells of Notre
Dame," isn't so much a song as it is a group of sung recitative lines, a
writing technique commonly found on the stage.
Hunchback is also the most visually stunning animated feature to
come from Disney or anywhere else.  The exterior walls of the cathedral are
rendered in such intricate detail, as are the legendary bells, and the faces
are extraordinarly expressive.  There are more than a few knockout sequences
visually, the most memorable being the "God Help the Outcasts" number, in
which Esmeralda walks through the cathedral, lit only by candles and,
ultimately, light shining through a colorful, astonishingly detailed stained
glass window; and Quasimodo's daring rescue of Esmeralda.  Trousdale and
Wise have said that they tried to take animation to visual lengths never
attempted; they certainly succeeded in that respect.
Hunchback's all-around success also extends to the voice casting.
Hulce brings great vulnerability and gentleness in speaking and singing
Quasimodo, firmly establishing this "monster"'s humanity.  Moore imbues
Esmeralda with her characteristic sexual bravado and insouciance; it's
amazing how much the character resembles Moore, both physically and
spiritually.   Kline makes Phoebus a charming, likable lug by giving him an
appealing sense of self-effacing humor, and Kimbrough, Wickes, and
especially Alexander hit the right comic notes as the gargoyles.  The
breakout star in the piece, however, is Jay, whose deep, Brit-inflected
tones just ooze menace and evil, making Frollo perhaps the most despicable
villain in Disney history.
Hunchback's darkness will, in all likelihood, prevent it from
receiving Lion King-size grosses, but don't be surprised if it just happens
to win an Oscar nomination for Best Picture next year.  It is much more than
just a moving, emotionally resonant cartoon--it is a moving, emotionally
resonant motion picture, period.

Review for All the Pretty Horses (2000)
_All_the_Pretty_Horses_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
If there's anything Billy Bob Thornton's _All_the_Pretty_Horses_ can't
be accused of, it's having a title that lies.  From its first image of
lovely equine specimens charging along, the horses are indeed pretty--not
just a few, but all of those seen in the film.  In fact, with a few
exceptions (to be addressed later), the images in this adaptation of
Cormac McCarthy's bestseller are absolutely stunning to behold.
That said, all the other charges commonly leveled against this
film--slow, dull, etc.--are not simply justified, but wholly, richly
deserved.  Much ink has been spilled on how director Thornton initially
turned in a four-hour cut of the film, which so freaked original U.S.
distributor Columbia that they switched domestic duties with their
co-producer, Miramax, which was originally set to handle the
international push.  While the uninvolving slog that is _Horses_' current
incarnation doesn't exactly whet my appetite for a director's cut DVD, I
can certainly see that longer version being a better film.
That's because _Horses_, as it stands, appears to be a hollow shell--the
frame of a story that either hasn't had a chance to fully gestate or a
more full-bodied beast that was ultimately stripped down to the bare
essentials.  Given the film's well-publicized history, the latter is more
than likely the case.  Matt Damon plays John Grady Cole, a young man in
1949 Texas whose lifelong ranch home is being sold by his mother
following the death of his grandfather.  So Cole and his best friend
Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas) head south of the border in search for some
adventure, but instead they find trouble--first in the form of a
hotheaded teen companion named Jimmy Blevins (Lucas Black)--and, for
Cole, romance: namely, Alejandra (Penelope Cruz), the daughter of the
wealthy man (Rubén Blades) who owns the ranch where the pair eventually
settle.
The pacing is slack, but Thornton and scripter Ted Tally's basic
narrative flow is fine and fluid as the story moves from its varied and
well-photographed (by Barry Markowitz) locations: the vast Texas expanse;
the ranch in Mexico with its (yes) pretty horses; the dark, dirty prison
where Cole and Rawlins find themselves with Blevins later in the story. 
Yet the film feels like a series of Big Dramatic Moments strung together,
skipping over the smaller details that gave said moments resonance in the
first place.  This is especially the case with the dud that is the
Cole/Alejandra romance, which is uncomfortably thrust into center stage
in the final act.  I'm guessing that in the film's longer version, the
love story feels less forced--maybe even not at all--and the intended
emotional connection between the lovers and between them and the audience
registers more strongly.
Or perhaps it doesn't, for based on what made this cut, the casting of
inexplicable Next Big Thing Cruz is a lost cause.  It's not so much an
issue of she and Damon not having chemistry--and let it be known that
together they are as exciting as watching paint crack and peel--than it
is her performance in general (though she can cry on cue very well):
stiff; robotic; flat as her body.  That leads me to another big element
of the mystifying hype surrounding Cruz; she has to be the most
unattractive so-called "beautiful" person to grace the screen in ages. 
Thornton's often close-up camera is incredibly unforgiving on her
not-even-close-to-being-as-pretty-as-the-horses face, and the crows whose
feet are planted around her eyes squawk for makeup assistance.
The other principals in the cast are better, but not too much better. 
The work of Damon and Thomas leans more toward the functional than
exceptional side, with Thomas making a stronger impression in a fairly
thankless part.  Trumping both of them in a sadly smaller part is Black,
who, with his strong work dating all the way back to his days on the
short-lived mid-'90s TV series _American_Gothic_ to Thornton's own
_Sling_Blade_, is clearly someone to keep watching in the future.
_All_the_Pretty_Horses_ is not a complete waste; there are some gorgeous
moments of visual poetry, and even with little to no context to support
them, some of those Big Dramatic Moments are striking.  But neither is
the film the grand yet intimate epic that Thornton obviously strove
for--at one point it may have been, but after seeing the release cut, I
imagine most viewers won't spend much, if any, thought on that now-moot
issue.

Title
Review for East Is East (1999)
_East_Is_East_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Children rebelling against strict parents is common comedic fodder on
television and the big screen, so it's a tribute to the makers of this
British comedy that an idea as familiar as that is made fresh.  Part of
that has to do with the point of view, which is from an Anglo-Pakistani
family, the Khans, in '70s Britain.  The seven children born to Pakistani
George (Om Puri) and the British Ella (Linda Bassett) want to be ordinary
products of their turbulent times, but George insists on nothing less
than a traditionalist upbringing for his kids, including arranged
marriages for all of his sons.  The lengths to which George--who is a big
hypocrite, considering he's married to an Anglo woman, who is his second
wife, no less--comes to assert his power over his family are monstrous,
but Puri's performance adds an invaluable layer of vulnerability.  Puri
makes one believe that he really does love his family and wants the best
for them; it's just that he refuses to see any beliefs other than his own
as being so.
While there is serious grit to its story, _East_Is_East_, adapted from
Ayub Khan-Din's play by director Damien O'Donnell and Khan-Din himself,
is foremost a comedy, and there are plenty of laughs to be had from
various domestic situations, culminating in one raucous climax.  It's a
credit to O'Donnell that the comedy not only doesn't cheapen the serious
issues addressed in Khan-Din's story but that it feels like an integral
part of the bigger picture.  As a result, _East_Is_East_ is one of the
rare films that gets to have the best of both worlds: hit serious and
true emotional buttons while delivering a genuinely fun time.

Title
Review for Holy Man (1998)
Who knew that in 16 years Eddie Murphy, who made such a brash, raucous
big-screen splash in _48_Hrs._, would become... cuddly.  The disconcerting
trend begun in this summer's cutesy, largely laugh-free _Doctor_Dolittle_
continues with this earnest-to-a-fault dramedy.
Although he is top-billed, here Murphy is merely support for Jeff
Goldblum, who plays Ricky Hayman, the programming director at a home
shopping network.  Sales are way down, and Ricky's job hangs by a thread
until he meets G (Murphy), a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperate
Ricky puts on the air.  While sales skyrocket and G becomes an overnight
sensation, the reinvigorated Ricky's greed grows, endangering his budding
romance with a goodhearted media research consultant (Kelly Preston).
Writer Tom Schulman has some promising ideas, satirizing home shopping and
infomercials and the nature of instant celebrity.  But these ideas would
have more bite if Stephen Herek had invested any energy into the direction
of the film.  The sluggishly paced _Holy_Man_ is not only slow and overlong
(113 minutes), but an unfunny bore, and Murphy can do little to juice up
the proceedings; cleansed of both the attitude _and_ comic sensibility that
made him a star (G is, for the most part, a straight man), he is a
curiously lifeless presence.  Goldblum is actually quite good, but it's
hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and
spiritual journey when the director doesn't seem to be much interested,
either.

Title
Review for Men in Black (1997)
Men in Black (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
UFOs.  Aliens.  Slime.  Will Smith.  What more can you ask for?  In
the case of last year's Independence Day, a self-awareness of its inherent
ridiculousness would have helped.  That problem does not befall Smith's
latest bout with creatures from outer space, Barry Sonnenfeld's witty and
fun sci-fi-action-comedy Men in Black.
In this adaptation of Lowell Cunningham's obscure Marvel/Malibu
comic, Smith stars as a New York cop who is recruited by mysterious Agent K
(Tommy Lee Jones) into the ultrasecret underground group known as the Men in
Black, which overlook intergalactic relations.  It is up to Agent K and the
newly christened Agent J to prevent an alien bug disguised as a farmer
(Vincent D'Onofrio) from stealing a galaxy and thereby causing an
interplanetary war and, in turn, the destruction of earth.
If this sounds a tad confusing to you, you're not alone.  MiB's
biggest problem is its story--the primary plot cooked up by screenwriter Ed
Solomon is introduced fairly late in the game and never completely adds up
(just what is the deal with the bag of marbles at the end?).  But by the
time the nominal plot takes center stage, the film has already won you over
with the script's witty one-liners, self-effacing sense of humor, and bashes
at pop culture (Sylvester Stallone is skewered in one of the more inspired
gags); and its imaginative production design (by Bo Welch) and visual
effects (supervised by Eric Brevig).  Most impressive, however, are the
alien makeup effects designed by Rick Baker.  The creatures look like
exactly that--living, breathing alien creatures and not animatronic puppets.
Especially convincing is an alien infant whom J delivers; slinky, squidlike,
and covered in slime, the expressive baby alien succeeds in doing what the
best human infants do onscreen--look cute and elicit "aw"s.
As impressive a technical achievement MiB is, it would not have
worked without a strong lead duo, and Jones and Smith make a great team.
Smith's natural, infectious ebullience plays off well against the stoic
Jones, who is at his deadpan best, engaging in some ridiculous situations
with the straightest of faces.  It is one thing to wear a straight face
while having a heated discussion with an uncooperative dog, but it's quite a
whole other level of achievement to do that and convincingly appear to treat
the situation with the gravest of seriousness.  Jones's K never shakes off
his grim face even when he is joking, making his performance that much more
effective and funny.  D'Onofrio has some great slapstick moments as the
insect who hasn't quite got the hang of wearing a human skin suit, and
though she's underused, Linda Fiorentino, as coroner Dr. Laurel Weaver, fits
quite snugly with the team of Jones and Smith.
Men in Black is certain not to reach the stratospheric box office
heights of Smith's bountiful bout with aliens last summer, but in shedding
the self-importance and jingoism of the two-hour-plus ID4 and taking on a
most welcome self-aware sense of humor, the lean, mean, 98-minute MiB is not
just a better film, it's also a lot more fun.

Title
Review for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001)
        More than other filmmaker in recent memory, writer-director Kevin
Smith is unusually receptive and accessible to his rabid (and
consistently growing) fanbase.  The discussion board on his official
website (viewaskew.com) is legendary for the amount of interaction he has
with fans; and public appearances and autograph signings are far from
rare occurrences, with the latter usually extending hours beyond their
allotted time blocks in order to accommodate every last person in line. 
But even Smith has outdone himself in terms of giving back to his public
with the wild comic romp _Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Strike_Back_, which behind
its outrageous surface is an affectionate valentine to those who have
loyally followed him and his work over the years.
        So for this film more than any of his others, it certainly is
beneficial (though just as certainly not necessary) to walk in with some
prior knowledge of Smith's "View Askew-niverse," which officially closes
with _Strike_Back_.  The title characters, foulmouthed drug dealer Jay
(Jason Mewes) and his laconic "hetero lifemate" Silent Bob (Smith), are
the Askew-niverse's most beloved figures, having appeared in all of
Smith's previous films in capacities small (_Clerks_, _Chasing_Amy_) and
larger (_Mallrats_, _Dogma_).  _Strike_Back_ gives the pair their
long-due turn on center stage, and in an added bonus for the fandom,
resurfacing especially for this occasion are other popular characters
from those four films.  Needless to say, only those with some Smith
oeuvre familiarity will fully appreciate the appearances of people such
as _Clerks_' Dante and Randal (respectively played by Brian O'Halloran
and Jeff Anderson), who to the VA-virgin eye would seem to be just bit
players.
        The significance of _Amy_'s Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) and Banky
Edwards (Jason Lee, who also turns in an appearance as the best thing
about _Mallrats_, Brodie Bruce), however, won't be lost on any newcomers,
for they nudge Jay and Silent Bob--the movie and the characters--into
action.  _Bluntman_and_Chronic_, the superhero comic book Holden and
Banky modeled in the likeness of Jay and Bob, is about to be adapted into
a film without our dynamic duo's permission, and so they set off on a
cross-country trip from New Jersey to Hollywood to stop the production. 
Obviously, the more serious overtones of Smith's last two efforts, _Amy_
and _Dogma_, are nowhere to be found in _Strike_Back_, and don't come in
looking for some innovations in plotting, either; the film is simply a
road/chase comedy that wants nothing more than to make the audience
laugh.
        And are there ever laughs to be had in _Strike_Back_.  Indeed,
Smith's famous (infamous?) predilection for dick and fart jokes is very
much in evidence (though, thankfully, there's nothing here approaching
the scatological nadir of _Dogma_'s Golgothan), yet while he may have
gained a fair amount of notoriety for that lowbrow brand of humor, his
greatest strength has always been the rapier wit of his dialogue,
whenever raunchy or not.  On the receiving end of many of the film's best
verbal barbs is the glitzy world of Tinseltown moviemaking.  No one is
shielded from the hysterical satirical onslaught: not Internet gossip
sites; not Affleck, who gamely pulls double duty as Holden and himself;
not the film's distributor, Miramax; not even
_Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Strike_Back_ and the View Askew canon itself, and as
such the fourth wall is not only broken, but flat out bulldozed.
        Lest the film sound extremely insular with all its in-jokes and
Hollywood insider humor, _Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Strike_Back_ also offers a
number of broader-appeal delights, particularly in the performance
department.  That Mewes and Smith have their act down by now is no
surprise; Mewes invests his usual gusto into every last one of Jay's
four-letter words and vulgar gestures, which are, as always, countered
with expert reaction takes by Smith.  What is surprising, though, is
Shannon Elizabeth's beguiling turn as the sweet Justice, who falls for
Jay as she and her more sour friends Sissy (Eliza Dushku), Chrissy (Ali
Larter), and Missy (Jennifer Schwalbach, Smith's wife) spend time on the
road with him and Bob.  Other colorful characters pop up throughout the
course of the film, the standouts being Will Ferrell's clueless Federal
Wildlife Marshal Willenholly and Chaka (Chris Rock), a militant
African-American film director; and a multitude of stars recognizable to
all audiences turn up in some enjoyable cameos.
        The polished and at times--brace yourselves--slick visuals of
_Strike_Back_, undoubtedly due in large part to cinematographer Jamie
Anderson, will be downright shocking to Smith fans and especially to his
detractors, who will find themselves with one less thing to knock him on.
 I'm sure they will come up with plenty of compensatory ammunition in the
content of the film--or rather lack thereof.  With its shameless (and not
always successful) riffs on other movies, frequent references to his own
previous work, and slant toward broad antics in general, even Smith has
called _Strike_Back_ "a step backward" in his progression as a filmmaker.
 To hell with any perceived requirements for "artistic growth," I say, if
stagnation and regression are done in the name of offering a good time at
the movies--and _Jay_and_Silent_Bob_Strike_Back_ is nothing less than a
rollicking blast.  (This film is not yet rated; opens August 24)

Title
Review for Three Kings (1999)
_Three_Kings_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        At the end of the Gulf War, a group of four--_not_ three--American
soldiers (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze) head
out to the Iraqi desert to claim millions in stolen Kuwaiti gold as their
own.  Much like their seemingly simple journey, there is more to
_Three_Kings_ than one expects.  Writer-director David O. Russell,
heretofore best known for the idiosyncratic indies _Spanking_the_Monkey_
and _Flirting_with_Disaster_, establishes a quirky sense of humor in the
film's lighthearted early treasure hunting stages, then midway shifts
gears into a thoughtful--but never heavyhanded--examination of the
post-war plight of the Iraqi people.  The shock comes in not the
suddenness of the transition but in how the change is barely noticeable. 
Russell juggles comedy, drama, traditional war and action-adventure movie
elements in _Three_Kings_, and their seamless blending makes for a studio
picture uncommon in its unique sensibility and personality.  
The latter, of course, owes a great debt to the ensemble.  As the
ringleader of the gang, Major Archie Gates, Clooney is his typically
charismatic self, and it's a testament to his costars' work that his
formidable screen presence never dominates.  Wahlberg and Cube more than
hold their own as Sgt. Troy Barlow and Chief Elgin, respectively (even if
the latter is saddled with a fairly limited role), and more secondary
players like Nora Dunn (as TV reporter Adriana Cruz) and Jamie Kennedy
(as the slightly-off soldier Walter Wogeman) are given their share of
moments to call their own.  But the surprising standout is Jonze, who, in
his acting debut, proves to possess talents that go beyond his claim to
fame in music video directing.  His funny and ultimately moving work as
Pvt. Conrad Vig, who intensely admires Troy, is the film's true buried
treasure.

Review for Original Kings of Comedy, The (2000)
_The_Original_Kings_of_Comedy_ (R) *** (out of ****)
        Normal film review rules don't necessarily apply to
_The_Original_Kings_of_Comedy_.  Despite being "a Spike Lee Joint," this
film of the popular stand-up comedy tour featuring Steve Harvey, D.L.
Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Bernie Mac is completely devoid of
his trademark razzle dazzle; Lee shoots the concert as matter-of-factly
as an HBO comedy special.   While not making for the most visually
inventive of cinema, the straightforward approach puts in proper focus
the film's appeal: four talented guys simply being very funny.
        Anyone familiar with the stand-up shows from which most of the
four first gained notice--BET's _Comicview_ and HBO's
_Def_Comedy_Jam_--knows that in being funny, these guys are also rather
profane.  Audiences whose only previous experience with Harvey and Cedric
is their work on the former's eponymous WB sitcom, or with Hughley on his
ABC-to-UPN transplant _The_Hughleys_, are in for a shock--the stars of
these family-skewed shows toss off four-letter words with the best
(worst?) of them.  Prudes may find the amount of profanity ridiculously
excessive, but it's an integral part of the comedians' verbal arsenal. 
Shock value isn't so much the intent as a side effect; the words are used
to punctuate and underscore their ideas and observations, many of which
revolve around the differences between blacks and whites.
        While that inevitably leads to overlap between the four's
routines--and a certain feeling of repetition--each performer carves out
their own distinct personality.  Harvey serves as emcee, and he's the
smooth romantic, the highlight of his sets (he does a bit between each
act) being a tribute to '70s old school soul that includes a hilarious,
on-target rip on rap/hip-hop concerts.  Hughley is the energetic live
wire, closing out his routine with jabs at random audience members. 
Cedric is the most laid-back--and most impressively coordinated; his
dance moves got both the filmed and live audiences going.
        Mac's aggressive closing set is at once the most incendiary and
the most truthful.  His routine could share the title of the central
manifesto in _Jerry_Maguire_, "The Things We Think and Do Not Say";
nothing and no one is safe as Mac talks about wanting to beat sense into
naughty children and launches into an extended bit involving stuttering. 
Much of his material could easily offend, but a lot of it comes within a
disarmingly honest context, such as the jokes involving his nieces and
nephew, the custody of whom was taken away from his drug-addicted sister
and given to him.  Of course, the comedic meat of the jokes derives from
his creative embellishment, but there is the ring of hard truth in the
jokes' foundation.
        In an attempt to break the stage-and-crowd visual monotony, Lee
sometimes cuts away from the performance to some moments away from the
performance arena.  Not a bad idea, per se, but these segments, such as a
rather pointless one where the four play poker, are largely dull lulls
that make the audience too aware of the film's 120-minute running time.
        But most of 120 minutes are devoted to what audiences buy a
ticket to see: Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and
Bernie Mac doing their thing.  They don't disappoint--and, in turn,
neither does _The_Original_Kings_of_Comedy_.

Title
Review for Titus (1999)
        If you thought Baz Luhrmann's radical take on
_William_Shakespeare's_Romeo_+_Juliet_ was wild, wait until what you
see what Tony Award-winning stage director Julie Taymor
(_The_Lion_King:_The_Broadway_Musical_) does to the Bard's
_Titus_Andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut.
While Luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s Florida,
Taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in Rome--but places it in a
surreal temporal limbo.  The Colosseum suggests the proper time of
Imperial Rome, but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the
1990s, while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more '40s
and '50s, and other garments are more gladiator-like.  As Tamora,
Queen of Goths (Jessica Lange) exacts revenge on Roman general Titus
(Anthony Hopkins) for killing her eldest son, and he does the same to
her for the wrongs she commits, Taymor obviously wanted to express the
timeless relevance of the story's underlying themes.  However, the
time convergence approach only works at times, for often it's just
distracting, as in one scene where Tamora's suviving sons (Matthew
Rhys and Jonathan Rhys Meyers) blow off steam playing video arcade
games.
        Taymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks,
for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned
them.  She is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist, the
latter compliment encompassing all areas, makeup and costume choices
as well as those in the editing and photography departments.  She also
has a sure way with actors; Hopkins' Titus is at once tragic and
horrifying, and Lange is sultry as the viperous Tamora.  The clear
standout of the cast, however, is Harry Lennix as Aaron, a Moor who is
Tamora's secret lover and a schemer in his own right.  Lennix brings
great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock
villain.  A great villain he indeed is, but to leave it at that isn't
giving full justice to his powerful and multi-dimensional work.
_Titus_ isn't a complete success, but it is never less than
fascinating, and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative
new cinematic voice.

Title
Review for Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)
        On paper, it looked like Hollywood finally figured out how to
make a live action film out of a video game.   A hot Oscar-winning star
(Angelina Jolie) and a name-brand (if not exactly acclaimed) action
director (Simon West) would join forces to bring to the screen an
interactive character (adventurous archeologist Lara Croft of the `Tomb
Raider' series) with real potential for a life beyond player-controlled
pixels.  Despite the promise for being something more, the much-hyped
_Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider_ ends up playing exactly like a video game
committed to film--and, no, that's _not_ a compliment.
        Compliments are due Jolie, who ably fills out Lara's figure in
every way.  Not only does she amazingly resemble her computerized
counterpart and do a spot-on British accent, the role offers her an ideal
vehicle to channel her off-screen `wild child' persona.  While Lara may
be born a `lady' of privilege, she doesn't act the part.  She's less at
home all gussied up in fancy dresses in her large country mansion than
she is sporting form-fitting hotpants and tank tops while facing various
dangers in booby-trapped (no pun intended) caves.  Jolie clearly enjoys
the character and shows great potential as a badass action star.  But
there's nothing to the Lara character beyond Jolie and the ready-made
personality she brings to the part.  Even Lara's key vulnerability--her
desire to see her long-dead father again--is intrinsically tied to Jolie:
Lord Croft is played by none other than Jon Voight, Jolie's own father.
        So the movie Lara is not much different from the empty digital
shell that stars in the video game, and the film's basic plot (by West,
five other credited hands, and who knows how many others) reads like the
outline for a game scenario.  Lara has to prevent the evil Illuminati
from rejoining the two halves of a legendary triangular idol that grants
its possessor the ability to control time.  Of course, the way to stop
them is to collect the pieces herself first, so we get a series of
glorified video game stages masquerading as action sequences.  Lara's
mansion is invaded, and she has to dispose of the bad guys while tied to
bungee cords.  In the central sequence set in a cave in Cambodia, Lara
must complete a number of tasks to collect the elusive first piece: turn
a key, swing on a log to reach an urn, do away with all the warrior
statues that come to life with the piercing of the urn, then battle the
cave's biggest statue, which must be defeated in order to advance to the
next level--er, scene.
        The mechanical feel of _Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider_ would have been
easier to swallow if the filler between action scenes were the slightest
bit tolerable.  Whenever the mayhem dies down, the film commits a bigger
crime than being boring--it tries to be funny.  Not a single would-be
comic touch elicits so much as a grin: not the one-note `eccentric' side
characters like Lara's stuffy butler (Christopher Barrie) or her nerdy
gadget designer (Noah Taylor); not feeble culture-clash scenes such as
Lara asking a monk if he knows where to find a phone.  (The only time the
audience laughed was when it was tricked into thinking they were going to
be treated to a second gratuitous Lara shower scene late in the film;
alas, the camera panned down from the shower head to reveal the face of
her rival archeologist Alex, played by Daniel Craig.)
        It's interesting to note that the only thrills to be found in the
PG-13 _Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider_ are of the prurient kind: the previously
alluded-to Lara shower scene, which bares a bit more skin than expected;
and a slo-mo Lara running scene that's downright _Baywatch_-worthy. 
Nearly $100 million was spent to make things blow up and fill the screen
with loads of fancy special effects, but all anyone talked about at
length when walking out of _Lara_Croft:_Tomb_Raider_ is something anyone
can figure out after shelling out a couple of bucks on a video rental of
_Gia_ (which offers real dramatic substance in addition to ample nudity):
Angelina Jolie is one hot babe.

Title
Review for Two Girls and a Guy (1997)
Writer-director James Toback's low-budget, high-concept three-character
(OK, there's really _five_ characters, but two of them only appear in the
first scene) drama is not nearly as provocative as its title or
much-publicized ratings troubles suggests.  The two girls are sensible
blonde Carla (Heather Graham) and streetwise brunette Lou (Natasha Gregson
Wagner), who find out they share the same guy, Blake (Robert Downey Jr.),
while waiting for him outside his apartment building.  Understandably
upset, the two break into his apartment and wait to confront him, hoping to
find out and understand why someone would resort to such duplicity.
At about the half-hour mark, just about all that can be argued about has
been, and Toback attempts to jumpstart the proceedings with a lengthy,
fairly tasteful, and rather gratuitous sex scene (sorry to disappoint, but
if you're looking for any menage action, watch Wild Things) that had to be
recut multiple times in order for the film to receive an R rating.  It
doesn't work.  More talk follows, about Blake's obsession with his mother,
about the possibilities of a three-way relationship, about the women's own
fidelity.  But any true insight into the nature of contemporary romantic
relations never arrives, as well-acted as this bona fide screen play is.

Title
Review for My Favorite Martian (1999)
_My_Favorite_Martian_ (PG) no stars (out of ****)
Grab a thesaurus.  Look up the word "bad."  See those words listed?  There
you have my review of the absolutely atrocious screen version of the 1960s
TV sitcom.  The Martian in question (Christopher Lloyd) becomes the
"favorite" of TV news producer Tim O'Hara, who reluctantly allows the alien
(who passes himself off as Tim's "Uncle Martin") and his living, talking
space suit to live with him as they repair their damaged spaceship.
Certainly some suspension of disbelief is in order, but there was one thing
that kept on bugging me while watching this film: just where exactly was
the Martian heading if he didn't want to land on earth?  It makes no sense.
Not that sense should be the priority of director Donald Petrie and
writers Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver--their main concern should be
laughs.  But there are none to be had in this tedious turkey, which uses a
lot of admittedly diverting (but not diverting _enough_) effects work in a
futile attempt to hide the 
clunkiness of the script and, worst of all, the performances.  Lloyd is
insufferably obnoxious and smug; Daniels is a complete blank; Daryl Hannah
(as Daniels's devoted camera operator) is even worse.  But as bad as they
are, they don't come close to the abysmal, forced work of Elizabeth Hurley.
 She's a born straightwoman, yet she's called on to actually _be_ funny as
bitchy reporter Brace Channing--and she has no clue _how_, showing no sense
of comic timing whatsoever.  It's not a pretty sight---a statement that can
be applied to the entire waste of celluloid that is _My_Favorite_Martian_.

Title
Review for Traffic (2000)
Featuring well over one hundred speaking parts over the course of a
running time that just misses the two-and-a-half-hour mark, Steven
Soderbergh's sprawling drama _Traffic_ is indeed jam-packed, but never
does it reach a stall.  This saga of the so-called "war" on drugs is a
masterwork of superb performance, smart writing--and, most of all, the
mark of a director who not only knows what he wants, but also exactly how
to make his ambitious vision a glorious reality.
Unlike most multicharacter pastiches, such as the ones made by Robert
Altman, or Paul Thomas Anderson's _Magnolia_, the characters of
_Traffic_'s three tales don't constantly crisscross, nor are they all
brought together by a big event.  Intersections are rare in _Traffic_,
and the junctions that do occur are often fleeting.  Yet the stories are
strongly linked by their greater thematic concern: to vividly illustrate
how the drug problem touches all corners of the country, all walks of
life, from people on the harsh urban streets to those in lavish
upper-class neighborhoods.  Soderbergh and writer Stephen Gaghan, working
from the '80s British miniseries _Traffik_, steadfastly refuse to force
easy, comforting conclusions from difficult and complex situations; as in
real life, one is left to decide for oneself who or what is right, and
what it all means.
While _Traffic_ is essentially about the war on drugs in America, the
film's starting point is the almost-exclusively south-of-the-border (and
nearly all Spanish language) story of Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro,
doing away with his annoying tics and delivering a career performance),
an average Tijuana State policeman who is given the opportunity for
greater prestige by working for General Salazar's (Tomas Milian) efforts
against the drug cartels.  Just north of the border in San Diego is the
setting for another thread, in which very pregnant European émigré Helena
Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones, her real-life condition adding a deeper
layer to her role) learns that the pampered lifestyle provided by husband
Carlos (Steven Bauer) comes from dabblings in drugs, not legit business
ventures.  The film also travels a bit northwest to Cincinnati, the third
central locale, where Caroline (Erika Christensen), the teenage daughter
of newly-appointed U.S. drug czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas),
brings her father's enemy much closer to home than he could have ever
imagined.
Soderbergh effortlessly weaves the individual strands into a tapestry
that is at once cohesive and characterized by its contrasting colors. 
The latter can be taken in a literal sense--Soderbergh, under the
pseudonym "Peter Andrews" (his father's name), shot the film himself, and
he gave each part of the film its own distinct look: grainy, washed-out
yellow for Mexico; a solemn blue sheen for Cincinnati; sun-drenched full
color for San Diego.  Each, of course, is representative of the
prevailing mood: the arid amorality of the drug underworld; the sad
desperation of daughter and father; the sparkle of a too-good-to-be-true
standard of living.  The intimacy and realism of the characters and their
situations, aided immeasurably by Soderbergh's hand-held
documentary-style lensing, smooth out any possible seams between the
pieces.
_Traffic_ may sound like a grim exercise in arty pretense, but the
weightiness of the subject matter doesn't necessarily keep the film from
being an accessible entertainment.  This element is largely satisfied in
San Diego, where Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman make a crack seriocomic team
as FBI agents surveilling the Ayala home and protecting a key witness
(Miguel Ferrer); this thread also delivers its share of unpredictable
twists.  The other two sections are by their very basic premises--power
struggles between drug lords and overmatched law enforcement, teen
substance abuse--darker and hence less open to offering more standard
genre satisfactions, but the performances make them instantly absorbing.
It is easy, almost too easy, to peg _Traffic_ as merely being a
statement on the futility of the war on drugs.  Yes, once boiled down to
the bare essentials, that is what the stories are about; yet the film's
essence are its painfully, truthfully imperfect people, who show how
everyone, knowingly or not, in some way becomes a casualty and a
perpetuator of the war machine.  With its wide focus, Soderbergh's film
is technically epic in scale, yet _Traffic_ derives its lasting power
from the savvy notion that sheer size is no match for urgent,
true-to-life immediacy.

Title
Review for Jurassic Park III (2001)
_Jurassic_Park_III_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        For an installment of one of the most lucrative screen franchises in
history, _Jurassic_Park_III_ arrives on screens with a curious lack of hype, at
least compared to some other so-called "blockbusters" this summer.  Sure,
_Jurassic_Park_ and _The_Lost_World:_Jurassic_Park_ director Steven Spielberg
now only gets an executive producer credit this time around, and the
less-marquee-friendly Joe Johnston handles the helming chores here.  The bottom
line, however, is that the film is another go-round of a formula that has proven
wildly successful more than once: humans + island + dinosaurs.  Could it be that
Universal knows something that we don't, anticipating that moviegoers have tired
of prehistoric predators?  Whether or not that may be true before _JPIII_'s
release, it could very well be the case after audiences see this  installment,
easily the least satisfying of the series.
        Before it goes terribly wrong, however, _Jurassic_Park_III_ actually
gets a number of things right.  The reintroduction to Sam Neill's Dr. Alan
Grant, who was absent in _The_Lost_World_, is handled quite briskly by Johnston
and the writing crew (the three scribes receiving screen credit are Peter
Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor--the latter two best known for their
Oscar-nominated _Election_ work), as is the basic plot thread stringing together
the dino scenes.  Ex-spouses Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and Téa
Leoni) convince Dr. Grant  to accompany them on a flight over dino-populated
Isla Sorna.  Of course, such a foolish trip goes awry when a plane crash leaves
them stranded and alone to fend for themselves against the usual suspects--the
velociraptor, the mighty T-rex--and some newcomers to the _Jurassic_ mythos:
notably, the winged, meat-eating pteranodon and the more-ferocious-than-T-rex
spinosaurus.
        To Johnston's credit, _JPIII_ moves at a snappier pace than the previous
two films; the streamlined plot allows for a steady stream of dino set pieces
with minimal interruption.  Unfortunately, the attempts to build character and
drama during the non-action interludes are predictable and uninvolving.  Paul
and Amanda grow closer while searching for their son Eric (Trevor Morgan), who
is lost on the island; a key "twist" involving Grant's younger associate Billy
Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) can be seen coming a mile away.  Certainly not
helping the credibility of the drama is the truly wretched performance of Leoni,
who accomplishes the seemingly impossible feat of out-overacting the first
film's Laura Dern (who makes a return cameo).  The big dramatic showcase for
Leoni is a bring-down-the-house moment in the worst way; it goes down as one of
the comic highlights (or lowlights, depending on how you look at it) of the
cinema year.
        Thank goodness a dinosaur pops in at frequent enough intervals to get
Leoni and everyone else to shut up and simply start running for their lives. 
Johnston stages a couple of standout action sequences, particularly the first
spinosaurus scene, involving the wrecked fuselage of the plane; and a set piece
involving a nest of hungry pteranodons.  Effective action sequences such as
these appear to build the film toward a grand finish--one that never comes.  Say
what one will about _The_Lost_World_  and its rather controversial third act
twist, one cannot say that the film didn't build up to a big payoff.  The same
cannot be said of _JPIII_, which reportedly began filming without an ending in
place--and does that fact ever show.  Not only is the wrap-up an anticlimax of
mammoth proportions, it then devolves into overdone and downright ridiculous
hokum.
        _Jurassic_Park_III_ is a reasonable enough thrill ride for a good
portion of its shockingly lean 90-minute run time (as opposed to the
two-hour-plus sizes of the Spielberg installments), but like any thrill ride,
it's ultimately only as good as the feeling it leaves the audience--and the
rather startling way in which the film deflates is enough to ensure that for
most viewers, this third trip will be the least charming.

Title
Review for Tigger Movie, The (2000)
_The_Tigger_Movie_ (G) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        It kind of bullyish to knock a film as gentle as this big-screen
showcase for the beloved, bouncy staple (voiced by Jim Cummings) of A.A.
Milne's _Winnie_the_Pooh_ books, but I'm afraid that's what I'm going to
do.  All the familiar characters in the Hundred Acre Wood--Tigger, Pooh
(also voiced by Cummings), Piglet (John Fiedler), Eeyore (Peter Cullen),
Rabbit (Ken Sansom), Owl (Andre Stojka), Kanga (Kath Soucie), and Roo
(Nikita Hopkins)--are as cute and charming as they have ever been (which
accounts for their enduring appeal), but cuteness can only go so far in
keeping an obvious, if warm and well-meaning, story interesting to
adults.  The plot has Tigger, who had always said that "the wonderful
thing about tiggers is I'm the only one," searching for the family he
never knew.  The outcome of the story--and its moral--will be quite
apparent to adults in the early going, and the slapsticky gags that fill
the space in between will hold only faint interest to those older than 9.
        What are obviously designed to keep the grown-ups interested are the
songs by _Pooh_ veterans the Sherman Brothers, Richard M. and Robert B. 
There's a curious choice at the heart of the song score: for some reason
screenwriter-director Jun Falkenstein decided to shoehorn
_The_Tigger_Movie_ into the traditional Disney musical formula.  So
Tigger gets his own "I Want" song, as well as a big showstopping
production number.  Both songs --and the others--are pleasant enough (if
not terribly memorable), but I wish that Disney let Pooh be Pooh, Tigger
be Tigger; the production number feels especially out of place, taking
the action away from the Hundred Acre Wood and into Tigger's surreal
Busby Berkeley/"Be Our Guest"-style fantasies.  Tigger and his friends
have remained family favorites over the years by remaining themselves,
and the studio should have had more faith in them to not mold it into the
cookie cutter it had already begun to shy away from.  Of course, kids
won't care, and _The_Tigger_Movie_ will finds its true worth on video,
for it'll make an ideal 76-minute babysitter.

Title
Review for Varsity Blues (1999)
Anyone who misses the heyday of the afterschool special will certainly
enjoy this banal tale of self-fulfillment, juiced up with enough alcohol
and sleaze to earn an R rating.  James Van Der Beek, he of
_Dawson's_Creek_ fame, plays John "Mox" Moxon, a benchwarming high school
football player in West Canaan, Texas who becomes a reluctant star after
the star quarterback (Paul Walker) is sidelined with an injury.  But Mox
doesn't want to be a star; in fact, he doesn't really want to be a
football player, either, reading novels instead of playbooks, which draws
the evil eye of the maniacal coach, Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight), who will
stop at nothing to secure another division championship.
Watching _Varsity_Blues_, I was reminded of the Mariah Carey song
"Hero," one of whose passages goes, "When you feel like hope is gone/Look
inside you and be strong/Then you'll finally see the truth/That a hero
lies in you."  That's exactly the arc Mox goes through, as he overcomes a
threat to his dream of attending Brown University by looking inside
himself and finding his heroic nature.  If that weren't cornball enough,
there's everything else that surrounds the main story.  Most
ridiculously, there's the town's obsession with high school football; it
seems that everyone's life--male, female, young, old, all points in
between--revolves around the doings of the team.  The one possible
exception is Mox's younger brother, who, in the film's lamest subplot, is
constantly trying on new religions.  The film's most insulting subplot
revolves Mox's fellow player Wendell (Eliel Swinton).  Apparently, he's
the only African-American in the entire lily-white town, which can only
mean one thing--yep, a token racism thread, used to make the already
blatantly bad Coach Kilmer appear even worse.
This is Van Der Beek's first film role after achieving stardom as
Dawson, and the most I can say for his work in this film is that his
shorter, darker hairdo makes his head appear less box-shaped.  Still,
that's more than I can say for everyone else in the accent-challenged
cast or the crew.

Review for Opposite of Sex, The (1998)
The Opposite of Sex (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Screenwriter Don Roos (_Single_White_Female_) makes a wickedly
entertaining directorial debut with this wild, unflinching, and
aggressively un-P.C. black comedy.  An all-grown-up Christina Ricci plays
16-year-old hellion Dedee Truitt, who immediately up-ends a number of lives
after leaving her mother's home in Louisiana and shacking up with her gay
half-brother Bill (Martin Donovan) in Indiana.  In no time, Dedee seduces
Bill's young stud Matt (Ivan Sergei), gets knocked up, and takes off with
Matt to California with the ashes of Bill's dead lover in tow (make that
held hostage).  When Bill, Tom's busybody sister Lucia (Lisa Kudrow), and
town sheriff Carl (Lyle Lovett) follow their tracks, things get even
crazier...
...but never lighter.  Credit Roos for maintaining a scathing, pitch-black
tone from first frame to last.  There are times when events and characters
threaten to soften up, and just when you think the film begins to grow a
heart, it chews it up and spits it right back at you.  This is perfectly
exemplified by Dedee's tart, self-aware voiceover narration, which she uses
to add the audience to her victims: she identifies and savages all manner
of cinematic conventions and cliches only to use them as tools of
manipulation.  But meanness is just unpleasant if it isn't funny, and
Roos's script is full of delicious zingers that not only bite but draw
blood.  A lot of these are capably dished out by the better-than-ever
Ricci; however, the best lines come from the film's real star--and biggest
surprise: Kudrow, whose Oscar-caliber work shows she can do more than play
a ditz.  The incessantly nagging bitch that is Lucia is not only the
funniest in an ensemble of original, indelible, and well-played characters,
and she quite handily takes over and walks off with the movie.

Title
Review for Love's Labour's Lost (2000)
_Love's_Labour's_Lost_ (PG) ** (out of ****)
In blending the poetry of Shakespearean text with the timeless sounds of
pop standards from the 1930s, Kenneth Branagh--a proven hand at handling
the Bard and an avowed fan of the old MGM musicals--should theoretically
have little problem casting a bewitching romantic spell with
_Love's_Labour's_Lost_.  And that's exactly what he achieves in one
sublime moment where new lovers bid each other a reluctant adieu with a
solemn rendition of "They Can't Take That Away from Me."  The scene is
sweet yet genuinely sad, but not without a knowing sense of humor about
itself (Branagh makes no bones about lifting _Casablanca_ wholesale).  In
short, it's the exact type of natural, persuasive emotion that Branagh is
going after with the whole of this ambitious project--and, more often
than not, ends up falling short of success.
_Love's_Labour's_Lost_ is one of Shakespeare's more obscure works, and
on a basic plot level, it's not difficult to see why.  The King of
Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his three closest friends--Berowne
(Branagh), Dumaine (Adrian Lester), and Longaville (Matthew
Lillard)--have made an oath to devote three years entirely to study,
meaning no "vain delights" such as romance.  However, their vow is almost
immediately challenged when the Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone)
and her fetching ladies in waiting--Rosaline (Natascha McElhone), Maria
(Carmen Ejogo), and Katherine (Emily Mortimer)--arrive to hammer out a
financial agreement between the kingdoms.  Complications predictably
ensue as the four men neglect their oath and pursue true love.
Given such a thin story, Branagh's decision to recast the play in the
year 1939 and expand the material with songs of the era is an inspired
one.  And from a technical standpoint, he knows exactly what he's doing. 
Everything looks and sounds right: the overlit, soundstagy sets; the
insanely elaborate choreography; the free-flying camera angles; the
distinct disregard to realism once the music swells.  The cast underwent
a crash course in dance before filming began, and everyone acquits
themselves fairly well, even in the singing department.  There are a
couple of standouts: on the male end, Lester's fancy footwork puts
everyone else's to shame; among the women, McElhone's sultry moves and
song stylings lead the pack.
All the competent staging and performance is of little use, however, if
the very presence and intent of the musical numbers are questionable. 
With relatively few exceptions (such as a simple and charming "The Way
You Look Tonight" crooned by two of the King's tutors, played by
Geraldine McEwan and Richard Briers), Branagh does a clunky job of
meshing the music with the story.  The first few numbers are especially
dreadful in this respect.  For example, a collective "Huh?" could be
sensed in the audience once the King and his buddies abruptly broke into
"I'd Rather Charleston" right before they signed their oath; and for all
its amusing aping of the classically excessive Busby Berkeley style, the
women's pool-set "No Strings (Fancy Free)" simply serves no apparent
purpose other than to have a big Busby Berkeley-style number.
_Love's_Labour's_Lost_ is also meant to be a comedy, and it is in this
area that Branagh stumbles the most.  His apparent direction to all the
cast is to play the material as broadly as possible, hence any real
acting is lost behind some insufferable mugging, particularly in the case
of the designated comic relief characters played by Timothy Spall and
Nathan Lane.  To be fair, though, Branagh's script doesn't offer much
opportunity for many to attempt any real acting.  There are eight core
characters, but only half of them (the King, the Princess, Berowne, and
Rosaline) are allowed to exhibit some personality; the other four are
more like background chorus members.
Also, some given the chance to act drop the ball--or, rather, one.  I'm
referring, of course, to Branagh's most controversial casting choice,
Silverstone.  Any chance the _Clueless_ starlet had to silence critics
starts to creep out the window the instant she opens her mouth, then
comes crashing down below earth during a couple of climactic speeches. 
She tries her best; the problem is that her effort is much too apparent. 
The constantly strained look on her face suggests that she's either (1)
struggling to remember her lines or (2) struggling to remember how to
pronounce them.
Her performance is indicative of the larger problem that plagues
_Love's_Labour's_Lost_.  The film's heart is definitely in the right
place, intending to show how easy and natural it is to be consumed by the
magic of love.  Unfortunately, Branagh's well-meaning but mechanical
execution makes falling in love seem like an uncommonly laborious task.

Title
Review for Mulholland Drive (2001)
_Mulholland_Dr._ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        David Lynch's _Mulholland_Dr._ began life as a television series pilot
commissioned by ABC for the 1999-2000 season.  Like Lynch's legendary 1990-1991
foray into network television, _Twin_Peaks_ (which later spawned the criminally
underrated 1992 prequel feature, _Twin_Peaks--Fire_Walk_with_Me_), the engine
driving the "Mulholland" pilot is a mystery centering on a young woman.
        The pilot begins on a dark stretch of the titular, windy road in the
Hollywood Hills, where said woman (Laura Elena Harring, a long way from doing
the lambada in the 1990 camp classic _The_Forbidden_Dance_) narrowly escapes an
attempted hit, thanks to a freak traffic accident.  While she stumbles away from
the scene with her life, she doesn't come away with her memory, and she
ultimately holes up in a nearby apartment that happens to be empty--at least
when she first gets there; she is soon  greeted by perky aspiring actress Betty
(Naomi Watts), the fresh-from-Deep Water, Ontario niece of the apartment's
regular tenant.  Betty and the amnesiac woman, who takes on the name "Rita"
after looking at a poster for the Hayworth-starrer _Gilda_, become quick
friends, and Betty vows to help Rita recover her lost past.
        Also like _Peaks_, _Mulholland_ is an ensemble piece, and while the
Betty/Rita storyline is the main concern, there are other subplots that play out
in the background.  One that directly relates to the main story is that of a
clumsy hitman (Mark Pellegrino) out to finish the job on Rita.  Another major
thread has less direct relation: one involving Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), a
hot Hollywood director who's being forced to surrender casting control--and
perhaps more--to some mob types.
        While the characters, setting, and situations, not to mention the more
noir-based flavor, are quite distinct from _Peaks_, the pilot-based portion of
_Mulholland_Dr._ (which is rather easy to recognize as roughly the first 100
minutes of the film's total 146-minute run time) more than recalls that earlier
series.  Some characters are even direct analogues to those in _Peaks_: Betty's
golly-gee enthusiasm at cracking a case is a more extreme take on FBI Agent Dale
Cooper's similar work attitude; the creepy mob figure who sits in a curtained
room is played by none other than _Peaks_' diminutive curtained room resident
Michael J. Anderson, wearing an oversize body; and the information-imparting
ways of the _Peaks_ character of the Giant continue in the form of the Cowboy
(Monty Montgomery).  That character--and, in one standout sequence, the
hitman--offers some scene-stealing doses of typically absurdist Lynchian humor. 
Most _Peaks_-ish of all is the unsettling, unpredictable atmosphere.  Once again
Lynch regular Angelo Badalamenti (who has a memorable cameo) composes a
haunting, dread-filled score that highlights the underlying danger and evil that
threatens to surface at any given moment.
        ABC passed on _Mulholland_Dr._ as a series, reportedly because
higher-ups found it--shock of shocks--too weird.  (The network instead went with
_Wasteland_, the Kevin Williamson-created twentysomething drama that ended up
flaming out after a scant two months on the air.)  But based on the intoxicating
narrative groundwork he establishes, there's little doubt that Lynch could have
had another watercooler sensation along the lines of first-season _Peaks_.  If
that series, with its focal families living in a small town filled with dirty
secrets, can be seen as Lynch's take on the old school TV soap, then all
indications suggest that a regular _Mulholland_Dr._ series would have been his
uniquely off-kilter spin on the slick '90s breed of sudser, with its young,
Aaron Spelling-ready cast members (interestingly enough, Harring toiled for a
year on that producer's short-lived daytime drama _Sunset_Beach_) intertwining
in an apartment complex that--perhaps not so coincidentally--bears eerie
resemblance to the _Melrose_Place_ compound.
        A year after _Mulholland_Dr._ was officially pronounced dead as a
television project (talks with other networks went nowhere), Lynch secured
financing to morph his open-ended pilot into a self-contained feature.  That the
final 40 minutes or so do not offer a clean and conventional resolution to the
many dangling threads that had been carefully introduced will certainly be a
source of endless irritation to many a moviegoer.  However, this should be a
reason for relief; it's not in Lynch's blood to come up with tidy solutions, as
so clearly illustrated by the half-hearted quickie wrap-up to the "Who Killed
Laura Palmer?" mystery in the European version of the _Peaks_ pilot.
        Call it either brilliant or boggling (or maybe even both?), there's no
denying that the course that Lynch decided to take is nothing short of
astonishing.  Instead of serving up a capper to a previously unfinished work, he
redefines the whole--or, rather, _refines_ it.  Most attention will be paid to
the many surreal occurrences in this final stretch, but far more important than
the surface trickery is what it accomplishes: redirect the focus from events and
characters to the film's raw emotional core.  In scattering events and
identities with seeming randomness, Lynch apparently says that such particulars
are moot; what matters are the emotions boiling within the people--in
particular, the person played by Watts, whose virtuoso performance is a wonder
on par with the film's daring transformation.
        Perhaps nothing illustrates this better than _Mulholland_Dr._'s most
startling scene, where Betty and Rita go to a creepy nightclub/theatre and sit
transfixed as a woman onstage warbles a heart-crushing, a cappella, Spanish
version of Roy Orbison's "Cryin'."  Just about everything about the scene has
the air of the unreal--the strange woman with the blue hair in the box seating;
the blurred lines between singing/speaking and lipsynching in the show, not to
mention those between the languages--except the intimately devastating emotional
impact of the singer's lament of lost love (which proves to hold even more
resonance as the film goes on).
        At first glance, the simple, single-sentence--or, rather, "single-line,"
since it's technically just a phrase--synopsis offered in the _Mulholland_Dr._
press kit appears to be a classic case of Lynch playing coy.  But once one sees
the maddening, masterful _Mulholland_Dr._, one would be hard-pressed to come up
with a more accurate and appropriate description of the experience than "a love
story in the city of dreams."

Title
Review for Yatgo ho yan (1997)
As with his other stateside releases, Jackie Chan's latest chopsocky
vehicle, Mr. Nice Guy, is contrived, blockheaded, and lacking in narrative
logic.  But also like those other films, it is a highly enjoyable ride.
Once again, Chan's screenwriters (here Edward Tang and Fibe Ma) have taken
the easy way out and named their star's character simply Jackie, with no
last name.  This Jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular
cooking show on Australian television.  Of course, Jackie also happens to
be a talented martial artist, and these skills come in handy when he
becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick) expose
of a drug dealing ring.
Other plot details, involving a videotape and a biker gang, are
irrelevant; in fact, as is the case with most Chan films, the plot itself
is just about irrelevant.  The sole purpose of Mr. Nice Guy's existence are
Chan's comic fight scenes, and those here do not disappoint.  Director Samo
Hung (who has a cameo role), a longtime collaborator of Chan's, does not
waste any time putting Chan in action, diving head-on into a wild
chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue.  Other impressive
set pieces follow, most notably a chase in a mall, which directly leads to
some frenzied, if cliched (can you say fruit cart?), business involving a
runaway carriage; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction
site, in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates
in some exciting fights involving boards, cement mixers, and a deadly
buzzsaw.  None of the action sequences in Mr. Nice Guy are as spectacular
as Supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or Rumble in the Bronx's
daring leap between two buildings; nor is anything as inventive as the
ladder fight or air tunnel climax in First Strike and Operation Condor,
respectively.  But the action delivers, even if the energy peters out
before the film's end (the finale, as spectacular as it is, is a letdown
for fans of Chan's athletic prowess).
Filmed almost entirely in English (even so, the voices of some
English-speaking actors are laughably dubbed), Mr. Nice Guy hints at Jackie
Chan's latest transition to Hollywood productions (he made ill-fated
attempts with 1980's The Big Brawl and 1985's The Protector); next in the
pipeline is Rush Hour, a stateside production co-starring Chris Tucker.
Hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in Tinseltown, and Chan will
continue with exuberant Hong Kong productions such as Mr. Nice Guy, for his
unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by American hands,
much like they have been before.

Title
Review for Titanic (1997)
Over $200 million in production costs; a problem-plagued shoot; a missed
release date; a cast without a major star; and a three-hour-plus running
time.  A recipe for disaster?  Not in the hands of writer-director James
Cameron.  His much-talked-about, much-anticipated Titanic has finally set
sail, and unlike the ill-fated oceanliner that lends the film its name,
this absorbing, moving cinematic spectacle not only floats, it soars.
It is ironic that so many modern dollars were spent in service of what is,
at its core, a very old-fashioned romantic epic.  Set mostly aboard the
titular cruise ship during its singular voyage in 1912, Titanic documents,
in flashback, the forbidden romance between penniless artist Jack Dawson
(Leonardo DiCaprio) and the well-bred Rose Dewitt Bukater (Kate Winslet),
who is quite unhappily betrothed to wealthy snob Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).
The nature of Jack and Rose's relationship is fairly
conventional--free-spirited Jack enables the constricted Rose to come
alive--but the simple purity adds to the couple's charm.  Cameron wisely
takes his time to build this romance; by devoting the first couple of hours
(and a very fast-paced two hours at that) to its development, he allows
DiCaprio and Winslet (both terrific in what should be star-making turns) to
develop a natural, affecting rapport with each other and, more crucially,
the audience.
One can use all the superlative adjectives--"extraordinary,"
"spectacular," et al.--to describe the centerpiece crash-and-sink (which
comprises the bulk of the film's final hour), yet no words can ever come
close to accurately capturing the truly awesome experience of watching the
Titanic take its final plunge.  Unlike the previous high-budget record
holder, the inane would-be action "epic" Waterworld, every last dollar
spent on Titanic is visible on screen, from the 90-percent-to-scale model
of the ship and rushing torrents of water to the ever-so-subtle visual
effects that multiply a cast of hundreds into thousands.  But for all its
technical achievement, what gives the disaster (and the entire film) its
powerful charge is the emotional investment the audience has with the
people--not just Jack and Rose but also the minor players, a number of whom
manage to carve out distinct, endearing identities during the course of the
film.  A sinking ship is just that without characters the audience cares
about on board; by the time the ship makes its fateful collision, the film
is no longer so much about a ship that sinks than it is about living,
breathing human beings who, as one of the film's taglines goes, "collide
with destiny."
The enduring and healing power of love, the strength of the human will,
living for the moment--these are a few of the themes Cameron covers, but
instead of coming off as blatantly preachy (which, in some of his previous
films, he comes dangerously close to), he addresses these issues with
careful subtlety, expressing them mostly through the characters and their
actions rather than explicitly written dialogue (with the exception of a
few words of wisdom dispensed by Jack).  One of the best examples of this
is the framing device for the main on-ship action: modern-day scenes in
which an aged Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story to an expedition crew
(led by Bill Paxton) searching for a legendary blue diamond called the
Heart of the Ocean.  A lesser filmmaker would use these scenes as little
more than decorative bookends, but in the end Cameron molds them into a
relevant subplot about man's selfish and greedy nature.
Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis earned long-overdue respect from the
Academy and critics alike with 1993's Schindler's List and 1994's Forrest
Gump, respectively; with Titanic, a sumptuous epic as emotionally powerful
as it is technically phenomenal, fellow hitmaker James Cameron is now set
to receive his just due.  (opens December 19)

Title
Review for End of the Affair, The (1999)
_The_End_of_the_Affair_ (R) **** (out of ****)
"This is a diary of hate," is the first line uttered in Neil Jordan's
_The_End_of_the_Affair_.  However, that line could not be a more
inaccurate description of this film, for it is a beautifully passionate
and extremely romantic screen treatment of Graham Greene's novel.
Even though the words "the end" are in the title,
_The_End_of_the_Affair_ is about a love's survival, but--as the words
"the affair" suggest--that love is forbidden.  The film opens on one
rainy night in London in 1946, where writer Maurice Bendrix (Ralph
Fiennes) runs into old friend Henry Miles (Stephen Rea) by chance.  Henry
tells Maurice that he suspects his wife Sarah (Julianne Moore) is having
an affair--words that hit close to home for Maurice: two years ago, he
and Sarah had an affair themselves, and his reacquaintance with the
couple just reignites his obsessive love for her.
Jordan, who also scripted, follows a complex structure that weaves back
and forth through past, present, and future.  The film is held together
by Maurice's aforementioned "diary of hate," which looks back on his
investigation into Sarah's suspicious 1946 doings, not to mention the
origins of his relationship with her.  The two meet at a party to which
Maurice is invited by Henry, and their attraction is fiery and
immediate--as is the electricity between Fiennes and Moore.  The pair
absolutely sizzle together in addition to having a palpable romantic
chemistry, and their steamy yet swoony scenes together show that
eroticism and romance do not necessarily have to exist independently of
one another.
While _The_End_of_the_Affair_ is indeed about a love triangle, it's not
between the parties it would appear to be.  In fact, the film is as much
of a mystery as it is a traditional love story.  The central narrative
mystery is that of the reasons why the affair between Maurice and Sarah
ended in the first place, which gives way into an even larger and deeper
mystery.  Some critics have taken issue with the handling of the latter
turn, but the fact that I was able to accept such a sharp twist so
unconditionally is a tribute to the remarkable finesse of Jordan's
direction; I was caught up in the story enough to accept wherever it was
going.
That, of course, is as much the actors' doing as it is Jordan's. 
Fiennes and Moore are both wrenching in depicting their characters'
soul-aching longing and bringing to life their characters' individual
aspects.  While one does feel his character's pain,  he doesn't downplay
the dark nature of his obsession.  Moore has a perhaps more difficult
task as her character undergoes the most radical shift in the film, but
she pulls off the job without hitting a false note.  Likely to go
unnoticed alongside such rich star turns is Rea, but his poignantly
subtle work is every bit as impressive as that of his co-stars.
_The_End_of_the_Affair_ is indeed, when boiled down to the bare
essentials, a melodrama that employs all the conventional tactics of
emotional manipulation.  What is hardly conventional, however, is how
beautifully and genuinely moving the execution is.

Title
Review for In Too Deep (1999)
The title _In_Too_Deep_ describes the situation its young undercover cop
hero finds himself in, but it also aptly describes the predicament of the
film's cast.  An uncommon amount of talent appears before the camera, but
their abilities are not well-served by this routine urban drama.
Two actors are able to transcend the tired material they are given: the
leads, Omar Epps and LL Cool J.  Epps plays the cop, rookie Cincinnati
police officer Jeff Cole, who loses his sense of self during a deep cover
operation designed to bust druglord Dwayne Gittens, a.k.a. "God" (LL Cool
J).  Epps makes a strong and likable protagonist, and as such his
character's flirtings with the dark side makes for some involving drama. 
However, LL Cool J is the more commanding presence as God, at once cold
yet so appealingly charismatic that it is easy to see how people are
drawn to him.
But director Michael Rymer and writers Michael Henry Brown and Paul
Aaron don't give their equally able supporting players much to work with,
largely due to the formulaic paces of their story.  Stanley Tucci has the
token commanding officer role, and his meatiest scene is the old reliable
one where he tells the increasingly out-of-control Cole that he is off
the case.  (Of course, Cole eventually worms his way back onto it.)  Nia
Long is wasted in the most thankless role of Cole's love interest, who,
as par for the course in films such as these, tells Cole that she can't
be with him as long as he's on his case.  And Pam Grier, whose memorable
turn in _Jackie_Brown_ apparently wasn't the career-ressurrector it
should have been, lends her steely presence and is required to do little
else as a veteran cop.
_In_Too_Deep_ isn't necessarily a bad film, just an average one, and
therein lies the big problem.  With the amount of talent at their
disposal, the filmmakers should have been more motivated to come up with
something a bit more inspired and distinctive.  Instead, they simply
settled for the routine--something that the cast shouldn't have to settle
for.

Review for Tarzan and the Lost City (1998)
One review of 1994's Sylvester Stallone-Sharon Stone actioner The
Specialist called that superstar team-up "the acting equivalent of the
Hindenburg meeting the Titanic."  If that's the case, then the pairing of
hack-tors Casper Van Dien (Teen Beat-ready block of meat from Starship
Troopers) and Jane March (last seen delivering what should have been a
career-ending performance as three characters in the atrocious Color of
Night) is the acting equivalent of armageddon meeting the end of the
universe.  In this horribly conceived and executed update of Edgar Rice
Burroughs's classic character, the King of the Jungle (Van Dien) returns to
his African homeland to prevent some treasure hunters from finding the
sacred lost city of Opar; following him to the jungle is his loyal fiancee
Jane (March, thankfully keeping her clothes on for a change).
Tarzan and the Lost City, directed by Carl Schenkel, is the latest in
what's becoming a most unwelcome annual cinematic tradition--the horrid
jungle adventure (the most recent entrants being last year's Anaconda and
1995's unspeakable Congo).  There are lousy, sub-Lost in Space effects;
cheap gorilla suits; flat-out atrocious performances (Van Dien's
barely-there, why-the-hell-even-bother attempt at a British accent makes
Kevin Costner look like Meryl Streep); and, worst of all, a lack of genuine
thrills.  Tarzan swings on vines and everything else, but there's nothing
exciting about anything, certainly not the boring, anti-climactic "climax"
in a pyramid.  The audience of ten with whom I saw the film got the most
amusement from Van Dien's hilariously delivered animal noises and sloppily
dubbed Tarzan call.  If this is truly, as the Warner Bros. publicity
machine stated, "A new Tarzan for a new generation," then everyone falling
into the Generation X category should be incredibly offended.  I know I am.

Review for My Dog Skip (2000)
        "Boy and his dog" movies always seem to fly over my head.  Perhaps it's
because I've never been much of a pet person, or more likely it's because
in pandering to everyone from the tykes to the old folks, the cutesiness
is often cloying and the sentimentality is almost always syrupy. 
_My_Dog_Skip_, based on Willie Morris' beloved World War II-era-set 1995
memoir, is guilty of committing both those crimes.  However, while this
family film often follows the traditional mechanics of its genre, the
emotions it elicits feel far from manufactured.
        That isn't necessarily the case in the early stages of _My_Dog_Skip_,
which traces young Willie's (Frankie Muniz) relationship with the titular
canine, whom he receives as a 9th birthday gift from his mother (Diane
Lane).  With the departure of his next-door neighbor and idol, celebrated
former high school athlete Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson), for military duty,
Skip (whose full name is "Skipper") quickly becomes Willie's new best
friend.  Unsurprisingly, the development of their relationship comes
complete with all the usual precious scenes of Skip trying to drink out
of a toilet and charming the pants off the locals in Yazoo, Mississippi.
        _Skip_ the film takes a longer while to charm its audience, and while
that sounds like a knock, it's actually a compliment.  Despite some
moments of melodrama (such as Dink's slow-mo departure, bombastically
scored by William Ross), director Jay Russell works at a low key, subtly
planting the emotional seeds that come to full blossom by the film's
conclusion, which packs a profoundly poignant punch.  The film's
effectiveness is every bit as much his collaborators' doing as it is his
own.  Although some of the situations he's placed in are cloying, Muniz
never falls into the trap himself; he's remarkably assured
and--crucially--real for child actor.  Ably supporting him are Lane,
Wilson, and, as his war veteran father, Kevin Bacon.  And while a number
of the film's failings fall squarely on her work, scripter Gail
Gilchriest must also be commended, in particular for some lovely passages
of voiceover narration, nicely read by Harry Connick, Jr.
        _My_Dog_Skip_ is a nice film, and its unabashed sentimentality is
certain to lead some viewers to call it too nice.  But that's what makes
it an ideal family entertainment: harmless to the kids, while offering
something deep and valuable for the adults.  _My_Dog_Skip_ is a touching
film with its heart in the right place in a day and age when so many
movies don't have one at all.

Title
Review for Wide Awake (1998)
Wide Awake (PG) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        The occasionally affecting Wide Awake is a strange paradox of a film.
Although it is clearly targeted at children, this sometimes humorous but
often somber meditation on death and religion will mystify most young
moviegoers.  On the same token, its rather facile treatment of its serious
themes will leave older audiences less than satisfied.
        The existence of God becomes a major concern for the film's protagonist,
10-year-old Catholic school student Joshua Beal (newcomer Joseph Cross, in
a promising debut) after his beloved grandfather (Robert Loggia) dies of
bone marrow cancer.  Joshua cannot comprehend why he had to pass on, and
his fifth grade school year turns into a nine-month long search (told in
three phases: "The Questions," "The Signs," and "The Answers") for an
explanation from a higher power--that is, if one indeed exists.  For a
kid-aimed film, this is pretty heavy, heady subject matter, perhaps a
little too much so to engage the young 'uns.  But writer-director M. Night
Shyamalan does not address these lofty issues satisfactorily enough for
adults, offering simple answers and easy miracles.  I suppose a compromise
of sorts was necessary to reach audiences at the opposite ends of the age
spectrum, but in hitting middle ground he reaches no one.
        More accessible to the tots are the subplots that hover around Joshua's
quest, such as his dealings with his carefree best friend Dave (Timothy
Reifsnyder), a school bully, and a portly schoolmate who desperately wants
a friend.  While some humorous amusement is to be had from these lighter
threads, they degenerate into the manipulative, melodramatic hokum of those
sappy "very special episodes" of sitcoms or, in the case of David,
disease-themed afterschool specials.  Granted, a few isolated moments
involving these stories and the main plot achieve some level of poignance,
but that is more due to the heartfelt, earnest performances of the cast
(which also includes Rosie O'Donnell, Denis Leary, and Dana Delany) than
Shyamalan's writing or directing.
        Towards the end, the newly enlightened Joshua lends the film its title
when he declares himself "wide awake."  Audiences of all ages will have
some difficulty saying the same for themselves.  To borrow the metaphor,
they will indeed be awake (OK, the really little ones may not
be--literally), but likely in that alert-but-still-drowsy state when one
first gets up in the morning.

Title
Review for Forces of Nature (1999)
_Forces_of_Nature_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck make one hell of a sickeningly attractive
couple.  I saw just how much at the premiere of their romantic comedy,
_Forces_of_Nature_, in Westwood last week.  In person, Bullock's
slow-simmering sexiness erupts to a mad boil; and Affleck perfectly
complements her by appearing more boyishly handsome (and I mean
_boyish_--he looks about five years younger) than he does in film.  Above even
their shared brunet beauty, the pair's innate charm shone through: the
perky Bullock waved and smiled especially at me, and the smooth Affleck
one-upped her by actually winking at me (though I, must say, I would have
rather they "traded" their respective greetings).
It is that charm that carries _Forces_.  Apart from Tom Hanks and Meg
Ryan, have two more effortlessly likable been paired onscreen?  When we
first meet Affleck's Ben Holmes, an uptight copywriter days away from his
wedding; and Bullock's Sarah, a veritable firecracker of a young woman he
meets on a plane from New York to Savannah, Georgia, we immediately want
them to get whatever they want.  For Sarah, it's to return to Savannah in
time to sell off a bagel shop she co-owns (long story); for Ben, it's
arriving in time for his wedding to one Bridget (Maura Tierney).
Come to think of it, though, the audience will probably not want Ben to
achieve his goal.  After a freak but fairly minor plane crash, Ben and
Sarah find themselves on the road, attempting to reach their destination by
train and automobile in addition to plane.  Along the way, the duo find
that they're not so mismatched after all, feeling, as Ben says, "a certain
chemistry."  And there's no disagreeing with him--Bullock and Affleck's
compatibility lookswise translates into an engaging rapport.
It must be said, though, that Bullock and Affleck click more than combust,
and that sort of makes the force drawing their characters together feel
more like one of script mechanics than that of nature.  Still, that's more
than can be said of Affleck's rapport with Tierney, but the weakness there
says more about Marc Lawrence's screenplay than the two actors.  He and
director Bronwen Hughes don't develop Ben and Bridget's relationship
satisfactorily enough to make make certain crucial turns of events
completely convincing.
As such, while Lawrence and Hughes do come up with some good comic scenes
(a strip club scene is a highlight) and coax good performances from their
Tierney, Steve Zahn (a zany delight as Ben's first man), and their two
wildly appealing leads, _Forces_of_Nature_ never quite generates enough
power to become sweep up the audience like the long-brewing hurricane that
hits at the film's climax.

Title
Review for Half Baked (1998)
The title of the comedy Half Baked actually gives the film a lot more
credit than it deserves.  Despite a few amusing moments and sporadic
flashes of wit and creativity, this silly and strange film as a whole is so
undercooked that its entirety can be summed up in three letters: P-O-T.
Even though it clocks in at only 82 minutes, Dave Chappelle and Neal
Brennan's script for Half Baked features barely enough plot to sustain even
that brief of a running time.  The threadbare storyline focuses on the
marijuana-selling operation pothead buddies Thurgood (Chappelle), Brian
(Jim Breuer), and Scarface (Guillermo Diaz) create to raise bail money for
their friend Kenny (Harland Williams), who is in jail for inadvertently
killing a diabetic police horse by feeding it junk food (don't ask).
Aside from a forced romantic subplot between Thurgood and the staunchly
anti-drug Mary Jane (Rachel True), the above is all Half Baked has in the
way of plot.  This would not be a problem if there were at least something
funny going on.  But there really isn't--though director Tamra Davis can be
credited with at least trying to make something unique.  Part of what gives
the film a decidedly strange feel is its reliance on elaborate, sometimes
inventive, sight gags, most of these depict the characters' state of mind
while high.  While some of the gags are interesting, such as the young
Thurgood envisioning and eating giant-sized candy bars after he has his
first puff, there are also quite a few lame ones, such as a recurring bit
where characters float in the air after trying some especially strong
product (in one instance, the wires carrying the actors are visible).  But
these mildly amusing (at best) gags are nothing more than an obvious
disguise for the thinness of the premise, as is the parade of celebrity
cameos, encompassing the likes of Snoop Doggy Dogg, Willie Nelson, Janeane
Garofalo, Stephen Baldwin, Steven Wright, Jon Stewart, and Bob Saget.
Strip all that away and what remains is lots of smoking, the main trio
acting stoned (Breuer especially lays it on thick), and even more talk
_about_ smoking.  Needless to say, all the pot use, wild antics while high,
and discussion about marijuana gets very old after a while--like five minutes.
I must say that I was actually found more amusement from Half Baked, which
was not screened in advance for critics (shocker), than I originally
expected.  The filmmakers obviously tried to make something strange and
different, which the film indeed is.  It's just that they forgot to come up
with more than one joke, and the one that they do have isn't very funny.

Title
Review for Ringmaster (1998)
_Ringmaster_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
The overexposure of talk show host/referee Jerry Springer continues--and
hopefully ends--with this insipid bottom-brow comedy which, according to a
closing disclaimer, is _not_ "intended to depict any actual participant in,
or aspect of, _The_Jerry_Springer_Show_, which is broadcast on television."
 Funny, because the centerpiece of this film is a salacious, fight- and
profanity-filled talk show called _Jerry_, hosted by a guy referred to in
the film simply as, yes, "Jerry" (played by Springer, natch).  Mercifully,
although he is given above-the-title billing, Springer is made a mere
supporting player by writer Jon Bernstein and director Neil Abramson;
anyone who's seen the "Final Thought" segment of Springer's show knows how
well he _doesn't_ hold the screen.  Not so mercifully, though, Abramson
allots some of Springer's limited screen time for a painful country-western
musical number and--yikes--a fleeting but no less ghastly Springer sex scene.
Instead, Abramson and Bernstein cast their focus (using that term very
loosely) on two separate groups of people who are tapped to appear on
_Jerry_ for different topics, only to end up intertwining.  Receiving the
most screen time are a mother-daughter pair of trailer park trollops.  The
daughter (Jaime Pressly), who indiscriminately has (to use the President's
euphemism) "inappropriate relationships" with random guests at the hotel
she works at, is sleeping with her stepfather (Michael Dudikoff of
_American_Ninja_, er, fame).  In retaliation, the mother (Molly Hagan)
starts having her daughter's fiance (Ashley Holbrook).  Slightly more
amusing is the other group, a trio of ghetto stereotype girls (Wendy Raquel
Robinson, Tangie Ambrose, and Nicki Micheaux) who have all, at one point or
another, fallen into the bed of musclebound studmuffin Demond (charismatic
_Spawn_ and _Tyson_ star Michael Jai White, who can certainly find better
work than this).
What ensues is tons of "too hot for TV" tawdriness that, ironically,
enough, is not compulsively watchable as Springer's two _Too_Hot_for_TV!_
videos--nor nowhere nearly as funny.  Part of the reason is that we are
acutely aware that all the outrageousness is staged; regardless of whether
or not any of Springer's TV guests' tussles are rehearsed, those fights do
feature nonprofessionals inflicting real harm on each other--which is part
of the show's sadistic guilty pleasure factor.  But the main reason is the
amateurish sloppiness of the entire movie, from the acting to the countless
glitches in logic and continuity.  (For example, Springer's character's
last name, according to the credits, is "Farrelly," but in one
autograph-signing scene, he signs his last name as "Springer.")  Stay home
and watch the genuine article instead.

Title
Review for Mission: Impossible II (2000)
_Mission:_Impossible_II_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Brevity, it seems, is but a side benefit of Paramount's insistence that
_Mission:_Impossible II_ (as the film is called in its main title
sequence) be referred to by its promotional title, _M:I-2_.  The shorter
title is a better fit for the John Woo-directed big-budget follow-up to
the smash 1996 TV spinoff, for it never quite feels like a
_Mission:_Impossible_ film.  For that matter, it also never completely
feels like a John Woo film.  Fortunately, the strange middle ground
_M:I-2_ achieves proves to be more than enough to satisfy anyone looking
for a jolt of summer movie action.
However, it takes a while for that jolt to kick in.  Woo is one of the
best, if not the absolute best, directors of action films working today,
and that's not necessarily because inventive ways of choreographing and
editing gunfights (though that does play a large part).  His best films,
in particular those he made in his native Hong Kong, were also just as
much concerned about the larger emotional and psychological issues in the
story.  His masterpiece, 1989's _The_Killer_ (which he also wrote),
centered around a hitman's attempt at redemption; his best American film,
1997's _Face/Off_ (which he didn't write--but certainly felt written
especially for him) explored the common Woo theme of duality by having
two men on opposite sides of the law swap faces and identities.
By contrast, _Mission: Impossible_ is a spy caper, and by design it is
more concerned with the nuts-and-bolts of convoluted espionage plots than
anything about the characters.  So in _M:I-2_'s plot-establishing first
two-thirds, Woo obviously doesn't have his heart in it, and the plodding
pace is nowhere near the consistently rapid pulse Brian DePalma gave the
first film.  There are no big shootout set pieces for Woo to strut his
stuff, so he is made to have whatever fun he can with a stylish but
largely by-the-book car chase between our hero, Impossible Mission Force
agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), and Nyah Nordoff-Hall (a ravishing Thandie
Newton), a sexy thief.  Hunt is ordered by his nameless superior (an
unbilled Anthony Hopkins) to recruit her for a mission to recover a
deadly virus stolen by rogue agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott).
Cruise, who also produced, took the criticisms of the first
_Mission:_Impossible_'s labyrinthine plot to heart, hence the simple plot
that can be succinctly summarized by the above sentence.  As such,
_M:I-2_ is much easier to follow than its predecessor, but it is also
less in the spirit of the original concept of the show.  Contrary to one
of the film's best lines in the film (delivered by Hopkins' character),
the retrieval-of-the-virus assignment is more "mission difficult" than
"mission impossible."  As ridiculously complex as the first film's story
was, it made for a more engrossing and convincing spy yarn.
Perhaps this was a concession to Woo and his style, for scripter Robert
Towne also makes some attempt at a more intimate subplot, building a love
triangle between Hunt, Nyah, and Ambrose.  But it's not particularly
well-developed, for I never detected much of a sincere connection between
Nyah and her former love Ambrose, robbing this element of the story of
any tension or suspense.  Chalk up this weakness to Woo as well, for he
skews the balance by effectively using his natural visual flair toward
establishing the link between Hunt and Nyah, whose portrayers are nicely
matched.
So far, not so good, and just when one is ready to completely dismiss
_Mission:_Impossible II_, at the end of the second act Towne's script
finally plops Hunt in the middle of an impossible situation and gives Woo
for the chance he'd been waiting for the entire film.  With the
bullets--as well as many people--flying about a laboratory in a
spectacular shootout, everyone involved in the production appears to be
galvanized: all the cast members (especially Cruise, who clearly gives
his all) and, above all, Woo himself.  This sequence is classic Woo in
every way; not only is the gunplay exciting and strangely beautiful to
behold, there are also the broad, operatic emotional strokes that lend
weight to the pyrotechnics.  (However, one of Cruise's big lines is a
near-laughable, almost word-for-word duplication of Daniel Day-Lewis'
signature declaration in _The_Last_of_the_Mohicans_.)
Once you get Woo started, there's no stopping him, and the final 40
minutes of _M:I-2_ is far and away the most electrifying action
filmmaking one is likely to see on the big screen this year. 
Everything--from the slow-mo shots of near-balletic fight moves to the
omnipresent flying birds--one expects from a John Woo action film finally
arrives, and he does not disappoint, and not just in an action
standpoint.  The underwhelming story resolves itself in a satisfying way;
however, it is somewhat hampered by the problem that plagued the end of
_Face/Off_: signs that point toward a more complex--and typically
Woo--close are erased by an overwhelming sunniness.
While Woo defies the odds and performs a spectacular rescue of _M:I-2_
in its final third, it's clear that, for all his brilliance, he simply is
not the filmmaker best suited to this franchise's constricting formula. 
_M:I-2_ ultimately delivers the goods and is certain to be a huge hit,
and one hopes that with the new doors opened by it, Woo will return to
writing his own material, a key factor to his finest films--one of which
_M:I-2_, while ending up quite good in its own right, certainly won't be
mistaken for.

Title
Review for Big Momma's House (2000)
_Big_Momma's_House_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Make no mistake--_Big_Momma's_House_ is all about Martin Lawrence
donning large old lady drag.  That's what moviegoers will buy their
tickets to see, and apparently that's the only reason why the director
and writers made this project, for the thin sliver of a plot is just an
excuse to get Lawrence in costume and let him do his thing.
That, of course, is not an entirely bad thing.  Lawrence is a talented
comedian, and he is able to bring more than a few laughs to the
proceedings.  As FBI agent Malcolm Turner, who spends most of the film
buried under makeup and prosthetics as the elderly Big Momma, Lawrence's
timing and manic energy juices up obvious gags cooked up by writers
Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer.  Since Big Momma is really a young man
wearing a fat suit, a lot of the humor derives from seeing what appears
to be a heavyset old lady doing un-old-lady-like things.  Big Momma tears
it up on the basketball court.  Big Momma beats up a surly self-defense
instructor.  Big Momma gets her groove on during a church service.  Then
there are the fish-out-of-water gags, such as when Big Momma is called on
to assist in a childbirth--an area, of course, in which Malcolm has no
level of expertise.
Individual episodes such as these are what viewers will remember most
about _Big_Momma's_House_, and that may very well be enough for the film
to become a hit.  But this isn't a sketch comedy on the television set;
it's a big screen film that is supposed to tell a story with a beginning,
middle, and end, and plot gets all but lost as director Raja Gosnell goes
from vignette to vignette.  For the record, Malcolm's disguise is part of
plan to capture a vicious escaped con (a barely used Terrence Howard). 
His ex-girlfriend Sherry (Howard's _The_Best_Man_ co-star Nia Long, also
wasted) may or may not hold some crucial information, so Malcolm
disguises himself as her old friend Big Momma (currently out on
vacation), whose home she is about to visit.
The story never makes complete sense, and while it really doesn't matter
considering the film's overall intent, it would have helped if there were
a strong spine on which to hang all the individual set pieces.  But there
isn't one, and this _House_ ultimately collapses under the weight of Big
Momma and her unfocused schtick.

Title
Review for Girl, Interrupted (1999)
_Girl,_Interrupted_ (R) *** (out of ****)
The title of _Girl,_Interrupted_ bears a singular subject, but audiences
will likely walk out of James Mangold's adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's
memoir thinking of two "girls"--Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, who further
cement their reputations as two of the most gifted young screen actresses
today.  It's unfortunate, however, that the script often isn't as strong as
they are.  But what is fortunate is that their performances more than
compensate for the shortcomings in the writing department.
Ryder plays the "girl" of the title, Susanna, who in the 1960s is sent to
the Claymoore mental hospital after pressure from her parents and a
therapist.  Though she was hospitalized for chasing a bottle of aspirin with
a bottle of vodka, Susanna is more depressed and unmotivated than truly
mentally ill--a statement which doesn't necessarily hold true for her peers
at Claymoore.  Her roommate is Georgina (Clea Duvall), a pathological liar;
she also spends time with self-inflicted burn victim Polly (Elisabeth Moss)
and laxative junkie Daisy (Brittany Murphy).
Susanna ends up bonding most strongly with the most volatile patient, Lisa
(Jolie), whom we first meet being dragged back into the ward after an escape
attempt.  Dangerous, carefree, and intensely charismatic, Lisa cannot help
but captivate Susanna's attention--and that of the audience.  It's a role
perfectly suited for Best Supporting Actress Oscar aspirations, and Jolie
(who has already garnered a Golden Globe nod and the Broadcast Film Critics
Association's Supporting Actress prize) runs with the opportunity.  There's
more to her performance than the expected fits and teary breakdowns; she is
able to make Lisa into a multidimensional person, with real humanity behind
the histrionics.  She will undoubtedly be competing for the golden statuette
in March.
By comparison, more likely to be overlooked is Ryder's performance, which is
very much Jolie's equal.  Susanna is basically the calm audience surrogate
in the middle of the storm, but the fact that she remains a strong presence
amid the flashier turns is a tribute to the effectiveness of Ryder's
measured, no-frills work.  Despite the many spotlight-stealing moments
afforded to Lisa, _Girl,_Interrupted_ is Susanna's story of growth, and one
is able to see her progression through Ryder's nuanced performance.
Less subtle, however, is the script by Mangold, Lisa Loomer, and Anna
Hamilton Phelan.  I think the honest portrait of these troubled young women
makes engrossing enough viewing, but the writers have decided to manufacture
blatantly "movie" situations for dramatic purposes.  It's an understandable
decision, but the mechanics behind such contrived scenes as an angry,
tear-stained climactic confrontation between Susanna and Lisa are a bit too
obvious and distracting to be completely believable.
Yet one does buy into such scenes to a certain degree, again thanks to the
work of the cast and the overall power of the story.  _Girl,_Interrupted_
may ultimately be a film, underrealized; but its desired emotional effect is
more than adequately achieved.

Title
Review for Holy Smoke (1999)
  Up until a couple of days ago, the latest film from idiosyncratic New
Zealand-born director Jane Campion bore the more exclamatory moniker
_Holy_Smoke!_--an interjection that will serve as many people's immediate
reaction to the picture.  It certainly was mine--in a good way.  The
basic plot synopsis doesn't clue one in to the twisted path this unique
film takes.  A young Australian named Ruth (Kate Winslet) returns home
from a trip to India a changed woman, having fallen under the spell of a
spiritual guru.  Deeply concerned, her family enlists the services of
American P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel), a cult deprogrammer with an
impeccable success record.  P.J.'s track record doesn't stand a chance,
however, when Ruth turns out to be as headstrong as he is.
Thus the stage is set for a traditional role reversal; as Ruth's
devotion to her guru fades away, P.J. finds himself falling under the
influence of a different cult--Ruth's formidable sexual allure--and he is
helpless to resist.  But this being a Campion film, the story hardly
unfolds in a traditional manner.  Walking into the auditorium, one would
not expect to see Keitel wearing a dress and full makeup for the last 20
or so minutes.  Then there are the surreal visual touches to rival the
talking lima beans in Campion's _The_Portrait_of_a_Lady_, such as the
comical parade of Ruth's past lovers, all of whom have twinkling eyes and
teeth.  It goes without saying that these flights of fancy lends the film
a bizarre fascination.
Which, I believe, is the point.  _Holy_Smoke_ is all about the strange
spells one inexplicably gets cast under, so it's only fitting that the
film itself craft one of its own.  But the audacity of Campion (and her
writing partner and sister, Anna) ultimately plays a smaller role in the
film's success than a more concrete quality: the performances.  It's a
testament to Keitel's work that P.J.'s emotional descent remains
believable while in drag.  More impressive, though, is Winslet, who once
again gets to bare another aspect of her being (in every sense) as Ruth. 
It's refreshing to see Winslet follow _Titanic_'s phenomenal commercial
success by returning to the edgy roles in smaller films that earned her
recognition in the first place.  As _Holy_Smoke_ displays, the work
proves more admirable and rewarding than anything in a big mainstream
Hollywood picture (such as _End_of_Days_, which she was offered and
understandably declined).

Title
Review for Hercules (1997)
After making steps toward maturity with 1995's serious-minded
Pocahontas and last year's vastly underrated dark masterpiece The Hunchback
of Notre Dame, Disney's 35th full-length animated feature, John Musker and
Ron Clements's comic adventure Hercules, finds the studio in retrograde.
While this shift in gears is a bit disappointing after the admirable
ambitions of the previous two films, there is no denying that Hercules is a
rousing crowdpleaser--the type of light, fun family entertainment the Disney
name has become synonymous with over the years.
The first few minutes of Hercules could not be more of a contrast
from the dark opening of Hunchback, in which the evil Judge Frollo kills
baby Quasimodo's mother attempts to drown him in a well--we see the
absolutely adorable baby Hercules (whose big head makes up two-thirds of his
entire body), superstrong son of gods Zeus (voiced by Rip Torn) and Hera
(Samantha Eggar), cuddling with his pet, baby Pegasus.  The bliss on Mount
Olympus is short-lived, however; baby Herc is soon snatched away by god of
the underworld Hades (a well-cast James Woods, more smarmy used car salesman
than devilish overlord) who feeds the child a potion that makes him mortal
and thus unable to rejoin his parents in the land of the gods.  Under the
training of wisecracking satyr Philoctetes (Danny DeVito, in top
wisecracking form), the strong and brave Herc (voiced as a teen by Joshua
Keaton and Roger Bart; voiced as an adult by Tate Donovan) becomes, if you
will, the Michael Jordan of ancient Greece, admired by millions and earning
millions through endorsement deals.  But to regain his divine aura, he must
prove to be a "true hero," and standing in his way is Hades, who plots to
take over Olympus for his own dastardly purposes; and possibly Megara (Susan
Egan, the original Belle in Broadway's Beauty and the Beast), a
sharp-tongued damsel whose true motives are not clear.
As with all Disney animated features, the music is one of the main
attractions--or, at least, it should be.  For Hercules, regular Disney
tunesmith Alan Menken, this time collaborating with Tony-winning lyricist
David Zippel, provides his most uneven work for a Disney film.  The majority
of the singing is done by a quintet of Muses (Lilias White, Cheryl Freeman,
LaChanze, Roz Ryan, and Vaneese Thomas), a Greek chorus of narrators that is
part gospel choir, part Motown girl group.  Their soulful numbers, which are
more than slightly reminiscent of Menken's catchy '50s-flavored work in
Little Shop of Horrors, provide a toe-tapping (if not particularly memorable
lyrically) musical framework for the film.  But Menken's more traditional,
formulaic numbers fall flat.  Phil's dreadful comic number "One Last Hope"
picks up right after Hunchback's weakest song, the uninspired gargoyle
showcase "A Guy Like You"; and "Go the Distance," Herc's big "I Want" song
(his _only_ number in the film), is a forgettable, sappy ballad that
shallowly expresses his desires without shedding much inner light into the
character.  Menken would have been better off spreading the R&B motif
through the entire picture--a point reinforced by the film's best song, "I
Won't Say (I'm in Love)," sung in the style of a '50s girl group by Meg and
the Muses.  Why the producers chose a version of "Go the Distance" (sung by,
of all people, Michael Bolton) to serve as the film's pop single instead of
a rendition of this memorable song is beyond me.
Hercules also leaves a little something to be desired on the visual
level.  While the artwork and animation is perfectly serviceable, the rather
simplistic art style is a bit of a comedown after the impressive visual
splendors of Hunchback.  There is only one truly visually spectacular
sequence (Hercules's wild battle with a computer-generated Hydra) and only
one character with a striking look--Hades, whose head-topping flame changes
color depending upon his mood.  Meg's appearance is particularly
disappointing; a femme fatale is something new and exciting for the genre,
but her animators aren't up to the task.  Both curvy and sharply angular,
jarringly so, she is the first unattractive female lead in recent Disney
animated features.  But where the artists fall short, Egan makes up,
delivering Meg's lines with the right balance of sass and teasing allure.
And what about Hercules?  He's big, strong, well-meaning... and
dull.  Sure, he has all the muscles; he can lift heavy objects over his
head; but no distinctly interesting personality shines through.  At least
Aladdin had his life of crime and Prince Ali charade, John Smith his
"consent vs. descent" issue with Pocahontas, Simba his guilt over his
father's death, the Beast and Quasimodo their angst over their appearances.
Nothing is really made of Herc's main conflict (godly strength trapped in a
mortal body), save for one scene in which the teenage Herc is called
"Jerkules" after inadvertently destroying some architecture.  He displays
some cockiness when he first meets Meg, but it's quickly thrown out the
window; perhaps a longer-lasting dash of that would have added something to him.
Even with a vapid void in the center, Hercules is still top-flight
entertainment for the family, even if it does not quite qualify as an
instant classic.  It should have no problem reversing Disney animation's
slowly eroding box office grosses, which makes this Disney fan worry.  With
the light, bouncy Hercules's box-office success just about assured, will the
Mouse completely abandon, unjustly so, more experimental and mature animated
works like Hunchback?

Title
Review for Small Time Crooks (2000)
_Small_Time_Crooks_ (PG) ** 1/2 (out ****)
_Small_Time_Crooks_ delivers small time laughs.  That's not exactly a
damning statement; the Y2K edition of the Woody Allen Annual Project is
good for a few giggles.  But that's exactly the problem--all there is to
be had are giggles.
Only a few of these light guffaws are to be had courtesy Allen the
actor.  He plays Ray Winkler, an ex-con whose job as a lowly dishwasher
doesn't exactly provide a cushy life for him and his fed-up wife, Frenchy
(Tracey Ullman), a manicurist.  Allen is in full, tiresome nebbish mode,
and he is matched in the shrillness department by Ullman, a talented,
versatile comedienne who sometimes gets so caught up in her characters'
quirks that any sense of humanity gets lost in them (which is the case
here).
So it's hard to much care whether or not Ray's big and none-too-bright
get-rich-quick scheme--to rob a bank--works out or not.  I'm not giving
anything away by saying they indeed to get rich quickly (albeit not in
the manner they had expected), and suddenly the Winklers are part of New
York high society.  Ray just wants to live as a regular guy, but Frenchy
wants to be one of those snooty socialites, and she turns to British art
dealer David (Hugh Grant) for lessons in class and refinement.
Grant's character is the umpteenth variation on the Brit gentleman parts
he has built his career with, but he's more appealing company than the
Winklers.  Then again, many of the supporting characters are more fun
than the leads.  Michael Rapaport, Tony Darrow, and Jon Lovitz are all
funny as Ray's partners-in-crime, but they virtually vanish after the
film jumps ahead in time on year.  Luckily, still prominently present
after the time gap is Elaine May, who plays the dimmest of the film's
cast of dim bulbs, Frenchy's cousin May.
As with all Allen films, there are a few good wisecracks and individual
gags (_not_ among them is a particularly forced bit involving a burst
water main).  But never do they come together into a filling whole,
making _Small_Time_Crooks_ a minor, middling effort from a major talent.

Title
Review for What Dreams May Come (1998)
_What_Dreams_May_Come_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
_What_Dreams_May_Come_ is, in the most literal sense, a "dream movie," a
visionary exercise in the use of dreamlike imagery, which, in turn, helps
create a sublime romantic fantasy.  The centerpiece of the film is a
breathtaking tour of the afterlife, which is taken by one Chris Nielsen
(Robin Williams) after he dies in a car accident.  But while his spirit is
in heaven, Chris's soul remains with that of his soulmate, his emotionally
fragile wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), who had never fully recovered from
the years-ago deaths, also by car accident, of their two children.
_What_Dreams_May_Come_ is nothing short of a visual marvel.  Eugenio
Zanetti's production design, Eduardo Serra's cinematography, and the
spectacular special effects supervised by Ellen M. Somers paint a wildly
imaginative vision of the afterlife.  This is quite literally the case in
the scene where Chris first arrives in Heaven, which manifests itself in
the form of one of Annie's paintings.  It is perhaps the most visually
ambitious scene in a film overflowing with visual invention, with Chris
swimming in the still-wet paint and the backdrop remaining as
two-dimensional as any canvas.
But the film is much more than a showcase for the latest in filmmaking
technology.  As with his last film, 1993's astonishing
_Map_of_the_Human_Heart_, director Vincent Ward taps into the very core of
romantic yearning, coming up with an admittedly sappy but no less poignant
tale of true, pure love.  There are some powerful moments, most notably a
scene where Annie, in a fit of anger and grief, attempts to destroy a
painting which, unknown to her, Chris and his spiritual guide Albert (Cuba
Gooding Jr.) is inside.  Of course, moments like those are carried over the
top by the efforts of the actors.  Williams, as always, is effortlessly
likable, and he and Sciorra share a natural, magical chemistry.  One has no
trouble at all believing that these two are indeed soulmates, and,
consequently, has no trouble falling under the film's entrancing spell.

Title
Review for Bowfinger (1999)
_Bowfinger_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
Universal's ad campaign for _Bowfinger_ would lead one to believe that
the film rides solely on one (admittedly inspired) gimmick: Unable to
land action superstar Kit Ramsey to headline his no-budget extravaganza,
aspiring movie producer-director Bobby Bowfinger instead casts a geeky
lookalike.  However, that's only a small fraction of what's on
writer-star Steve Martin's savvy satirical mind, which takes stinging
potshots on a wide variety of targets under the Hollywood sun in one
efficiently funny package.
It takes a while for Bobby (Martin) to get so desperate as to hire a
dead ringer for Kit (Eddie Murphy), but his initial scheme is just as, if
not more, pathetic.  Knowing that the key to making his sci-fi cheapie
_Chubby_Rain_ a success would be the involvement of the elusive and
self-centered Kit, he shoots his unwitting "star" in secret, assembling a
performance out of footage shot while he is in public places (such as
restaurants and parking sructures) and reacting to his "co-stars," who
approach him out of the blue.  The reaction usually elicited is one of
confusion and fear--which, as it happens, are the primary emotions of his
"character," who is supposed to be witness to an alien invasion.
While the shooting-on-the-sly premise is funny--particularly Murphy's
work as the oblivious and bewildered Kit--_Bowfinger_ really takes off
with the introduction of the softspoken Jiff (also played by Murphy), who
is hired as a Kit substitute when the real deal goes on a retreat to
replenish his rapidly diminishing sanity.  Much like how the film is
given new life, Murphy is similarly energized in the character of Jiff. 
He has always been at his best when he tosses his vanity aside and
disappears completely into a role, as he did so memorably in
_The_Nutty_Professor_, and he similarly wrings laughs and elicits a fair
amount of sympathy as the good-natured, if slow of mind, Jiff.
Low-budget guerilla filmmaking and egotistical stars are Martin and
director Frank Oz's main targets in the film, but they nimbly use their
supporting players to attack other Tinseltown staples.  Daisy (Heather
Graham) is both the wide-eyed innocent who thinks a bus ticket from Ohio
is also an instant one to stardom as well as the predatory young actress
on the make.  On the other end of the spectrum is Carol (Christine
Baranski), an aging stage diva who itches for a taste of recaptured
glory.  Jerry Renfro (Robert Downey Jr.) is your typically greasy studio
exec, and _Chubby_Rain_'s script happens to be written not by a career
screenwriter but an accountant (Adam Alexi-Malle) with big-time Hollywood
aspirations.  There's also a thinly-veiled knock on Scientology.  With
such a wide range of targets, Martin and Oz give all their peripheral
players their moments to shine, with the one notable exception being
Jamie Kennedy, whose natural live-wire instincts (see the _Scream_ films)
are unfortunately held in check in the limited background role of Dave,
the studio gofer who "borrows" the equipment to film Mr. Bowfinger's
opus.
_Bowfinger_ does take its time to build a head of steam, but in an age
where movies often begin well before precipitously falling apart, the
fact that it is a film that actually gets better as it goes along makes
it something of a rarity.  Also rare is the enjoyment in finding a
seemingly no-brainer comedy that reveals itself to not only have a brain,
but a sharp one at that.

Title
Review for 3000 Miles to Graceland (2001)
_3000_Miles_to_Graceland_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
        Kurt Russell.  Kevin Costner.  Courteney Cox.  David Arquette. 
Christian Slater.  Bokeem Woodbine.  Howie Long.  Kevin Pollak.  Jon
Lovitz.  Thomas Haden Church.  Paul Anka.  Ice-T.  Bet you never expected
those last two, at least, to ever appear in the same film.  Yet despite
(or is that because of?) such a fascinatingly offbeat assembly of talent,
Warner Bros. has appeared to just about sweep _3000_Miles_to_Graceland_
under the proverbial rug, releasing the heist/road picture in an off-peak
season and giving it hardly the big promotional push that usually comes
with not one, but two name stars.  But who can blame them when the film
fails to even be amusing on a camp level?
        However, it must be said that the film is not a complete bore. 
In fact, once the film's first action sequence hits about 20 minutes in,
it looks as if a mildly diverting action thriller is kicking in.  Amid
the hubbub of Elvis week in Vegas, Russell's Michael and Costner's Murph
and three others (played by Slater, Arquette, and Woodbine) stage a
daring casino heist--all dressed up as the King, of course.  What begins
smoothly ends up culminating in a hail of bullets.  Director/co-writer
(with Richard Recco) Demian Lichtenstein, a music video vet in his first
big assignment, obviously studied up on John Woo before staging this
lengthy shootout, but there's no arguing the fact that such blatant
lifting gives this sequence a jolt.
        Sadly, that jolt is short-lived.  After some rather
rushed-through doublecrosses, the cast is whittled down significantly
(anyone familiar with movie conventions should figure out who gets offed
first), and the pace slows accordingly as Michael finds himself making a
quick getaway.  Weighing him down on his trip is not only a big bag full
of cash, but also overeager single mom Cybil (Cox, mysteriously billed
without the extra "Arquette"), with whom he's had some wild romps in the
sack; and her felon-in-waiting young son Jesse (David Kaye).  Meanwhile,
a not-so-happy Murph is following close behind, leaving a bloody trail in
his wake.
        Rumor has it that Costner and Russell put together two different
cuts; in the end, Russell's "character-oriented" edit was passed over in
favor of Costner's "action-oriented" version.  If this is the
faster-paced cut, I'd really hate to see the other one.  Once the
characters hit the road, the film slows to a snooze-worthy crawl, with
very few engaging moments breaking up the tedium.  These moments come
exclusively in the Costner section, which is less an indication of his
effectiveness here as a cold-blooded killer (he's simply functional) than
of how nothing of interest happens in the Russell thread.  Composed
mostly of soggy bonding between Michael and Jesse, this side of the film
is made memorable for all the wrong reasons by Lichtenstein's labored
efforts to make the audience care.
        But no one works harder to make some "emotional" connection than
Cox, who proves ill-equipped to handle material that can vaguely be
considered dramatic.  Her showcase Oscar clip is especially embarrassing;
while she has no difficulty in generating post-nasal drip, she fails to
squeeze out a single tear from her eyes.  By comparison, a bored-looking
Russell can only look good; and his ennui, in turn, makes Costner's
nominally more energized work look that much better.
        Lichtenstein finally gets guns blazing again in the long-overdue
finale, but by this point audiences will just be glad to be near the end.
 Without a particularly hissable villain nor a "hero" that holds any
rooting interest, _3000_Miles_to_Graceland_ doesn't even  get the basics
of a standard action thriller right.  Lichtenstein apparently thought
quirks such as a head-scratcher of an opening title sequence (depicting
two very CG scorpions engaged in fierce combat), a wacky Elvis-based
quasi-explanation for Murph's behavior, and the sight of Paul "Having My
Baby" Anka firing a rifle would be enough to keep a viewer entertained,
but like the film itself, these oddball touches sound a lot more
interesting than they really are.

Title
Review for Devil's Advocate, The (1997)

The Devil's Advocate (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        Heard any good lawyer jokes lately?  Taylor Hackford's fantasy/morality
tale The Devil's Advocate starts out as a decent one but soon falls prey to
Hollywood excess and gimmickry.
        Keanu Reeves plays Kevin Lomax, a hotshot Florida attorney who is not
above anything to win a case, even (gasp) coming up with convincing
defenses for clients he knows are guilty.  This, of course, means he his
headed for the big-time, and the golden opportunity comes when he is
invited to join a lofty New York firm headed by the brash John Milton (Al
Pacino).
        As the poster's tagline goes, "The newest attorney at the world's most
powerful law firm has never lost a case.  But he's about to lose his soul."
 Known to every moviegoer going in, Milton is not only a bad guy, he is
_the_ bad guy--the Devil himself.  But it takes a while for Kevin to
realize this--and for director Hackford to explicitly suggest that he is.
As such, The Devil's Advocate comes in at a bloated two-hour,
twenty-plus-minute running time.  However, the film's setup is much more
interesting than the overblown payoff offered by Hackford and screenwriters
Jonathan Lemkin and Tony Gilroy.  Up until the climax, the obligatory
visual effects are fairly subtle, convincingly conveying the story's
fanciful elements while not undercutting its anchor in reality.  But the
Hollywood mentality of "more _is_ more" takes hold in the final reel, and
Hackford employs an extravagant and extremely extraneous array of effects
for the final showdown.  Similarly Hollywood are a couple of contrivances
that cap the picture.  The Devil's Advocate takes a pair of wild twists in
its conclusion, the last of which is a definite crowd-pleaser, but it also
makes no logical sense.  I will not give it away, but it reeks of blatant
audience pandering (and, perhaps, test screening tinkering), offering a
quick fix of enjoyment while simultaneously going against just about
everything that immediately preceded it.
        Reeves-bashing has become so commonplace that it can be seen as a critic's
easy way out, but, forgive me, I cannot resist here.  One of Reeves's worst
characteristics is his flat voice, and while punching it up with an accent
would seem like a harmless way of giving it a jolt, for Reeves it is
ruinous.  His Southern drawl is horrendous, not to mention inconsistent,
yet mercifully so--he is much easier to take when it disappears.  Another
common problem with Reeves is his inexpressiveness, which was perfect for
the action hero in the original Speed but is a huge hindrance in something
halfway-dramatic as this.  When some sign of emotion is called for, his
face appears to be under great strain, painfully contorting to shape an
expression of some affect.  Most of all, however, his natural blankness
makes Kevin's spiritual change from mostly good to bad barely noticeable;
the only difference I could make out between the "before" Kevin and the
"after" Kevin is that the "after" Kevin smokes.
        It comes as no shock, of course, that the lightweight Reeves can barely
hold his own with Pacino, who deserves billing over Reeves for the sheer
entertainment value of his performance if not his more illustrious career
and box office track record.  At first it is slightly disappointing to see
Pacino retreat to the broad theatrics of most of his recent work after the
beautiful subtleties of Donnie Brasco, but his shameless showboating is not
only called for here (after all, the Devil cannot exactly be restrained),
but a lot of fun.  The sole pleasure of the overdone climax is the sight of
Pacino throwing all caution to the wind and cutting completely loose: he
not only gets to act angry, sad, happy, and all points in between, he also
gets to do a song and dance.  Pacino has a blast, and it is hard for you
not to, either.  His sparkling presence really holds the picture together.
        More surprising, though, is Reeves's poor showing against up-and-comer
Charlize Theron, who plays Kevin's wife Mary Ann.  Theron has the largest
dramatic burden to bear--throughout the course of the picture, she has to
change from a naive, bleached-blond-and-permed bumpkin to a dark-haired,
severely distressed woman driven to the brink of insanity--and she carries
it with very little, if any, trouble.  She has a critical emotional gravity
that Reeves lacks during their more serious scenes, which belies her fairly
limited experience in film (and acting, for that matter).  It is amazing
that over the course of only four films in the past two years--2 days in
the Valley, That Thing You Do!, Trial and Error, and this--Theron has
displayed a greater depth and range than vet Reeves has in his entire career.
        Theron is great, Pacino is, too, and the film has a delicious, if
improbable, hook, but in the end The Devil's Advocate is a fable with a
fairly simpleminded moral--do the right, honorable thing.  It is a lesson
we have all been told before one way or another, and in a number of more
satisfying cinematic ways.

Review for Blast from the Past (1999)
_Blast_from_the_Past_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
It's a terrible premise: believing that America would be bombed by the
Russians in 1962, an eccentric but brilliant scientist (Christopher Walken)
and his pregnant wife (Sissy Spacek) lock themselves in a homey underground
fallout shelter.  After the timed locks open after 35 years, their son,
Adam (Brendan Fraser) is ready to go up to the surface to get more
supplies.  There he meets the oh-so-conveniently named Eve (Alicia
Silverstone), who schools the '60s-era-bred Adam in the ways of the '90s
L.A....and, of course, in love.
Surprisingly, however, _Blast_from_the_Past_ does have its charms, chief
among them being some good comic character work from Walken and Dave Foley,
who plays Eve's gay brother.  Fraser and Silverstone also have a sweet,
unforced romantic rapport.  But it's not enough to overcome the thudding
weight of the premise, which serves as the springboard for too many lame
gags, the lamest of all being a bar owner (Joey Slotnick) who thinks Adam
is God (don't ask).  In the end, the charm of _Blast_from_the_Past_ cannot
overpower the cheese.

Title
Review for Meet Joe Black (1998)
_Meet_Joe_Black_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
Most meetings last just a couple of seconds.  A hello, a handshake, and
you have officially met someone.  In the case of _Joe_Black_, the meeting
is stretched over three hours, and while it is an enjoyable and sometimes
touching entertainment, the same effect could have been achieved in half
the time.
That's exactly what director Mitchell Leisen did in 1934's
79-minute_Death_Takes_a_Holiday_, upon which Martin Brest's film is based.
Despite the presence of the Grim Reaper himself, _Joe_Black_ is a simple
and frothy fantasy that does not deserve such an epic length.  Death, who
has arrived on earth to take an aging business tycoon (Anthony Hopkins) by
the name of Bill Parrish (Get it?  _Parrish_?) into the great beyond,
decides to take a holiday in the land of the living in the body of a
recently deceased young man (Brad Pitt).  Death gets more than he bargained
for when he falls in love with Bill's unhappy youngest daughter Susan
(Claire Forlani).
An drab corporate intrigue subplot contributes to the bloated running
time, as does the tediously drawn out finale, which strings together a
number of potential endings of diminishing effectiveness; had the film
ended fifteen minutes earlier, it would have been better for it.
Nonetheless, the length does not completely dilute the involving core of
the story, whose effectiveness can be credited to the ever-impressive
Hopkins and the luminous Forlani, whose heartfelt performance is as
stunning as her appearance.  Not surprisingly, the weak link in the lead
trio of actors is Pitt, whose portrayal of Death comes off as a cleaned-up
version of his blank stoner character in _True_Romance_.

Title
Review for Reach the Rock (1998)
_Reach_the_Rock_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
"An intimate, character-driven drama about a troubled youth at a
crossroads in his life," read the press notes for _Reach_the_Rock_.  I'm
not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words
bear little resemblance to the slow, completely uninvolving bore I saw--at
least, it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film.
Alessandro Nivola plays Robin Fleming, a troubled, directionless
21-year-old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small
town.  Police sergeant Phil Quinn (William Sadler) takes him in, and what
ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and
sneak-ins where Robin slips out of his jail cell, breaks a window, then
returns, all without Quinn ever noticing.  Also added to the pointless
proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving Quinn's
dimwitted deputy Ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex
with his girlfriend Donna (Karen Sillas). 
With a half hour (if even that long) remaining, director William Ryan and
writer John Hughes (yes, John Hughes of '80s youth films and _Home_Alone_)
finally approach something close to a point.  Turns out Robin still pines
for his high school sweetheart Lise (Brooke Langton), who has long gone on
with her life, and Hughes's main concern at long last reveals itself as a
tired "live in the present and for the future" message.  Most moviegoers,
however, will likely be asleep by that time.  Wide awake, however, is the
cast, who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy
and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless
enterprise: to serve as a series of acting exercises.  Such a glorified
workshop may have its rewards for the actors, but it leaves audiences with
a booby prize.  (opens October 16)

Title
Review for Dead Man on Campus (1998)
_Dead_Man_on_Campus_ (R) * (out of ****)
While I am not fond of any writer's use of cheap, easy puns, I am not
completely above using them myself when the situation merits it (witness my
review of _Pecker_ from a couple of issues ago).  So here goes: the
juvenile, college-set black comedy _Dead_Man_on_Campus_ is dead on arrival.
Strait-laced med student Josh (Tom Everett Scott, who manages to remain
somewhat likable throughout)'s blemish-free academic record breaks out into
Fs, thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate, Cooper
(Mark-Paul Gosselaar), who introduces Josh to the sex- and booze-filled
nights that come with university life.  With the threat of losing an
academic scholarship (Josh) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming
(Cooper), what are two good-hearted slackers to do?  Easy--look for a
loophole, which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school
charter that states that if a student's (or students') roommate commits
suicide, the surviving student(s) shall receive straight As.  So instead of
studying, Josh and Cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student
out there, move him into their dorm room, and drive him to suicide before
the semester ends.
Director Alan Cohn and screenwriters Michael Traeger and Mike White
(working from a story by Anthony Abrams and Adam Larson Broder) take their
sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with Josh and Cooper's
diabolical plot.  Until then, the usual boring cliches of college life
(booze, sex, more booze) fill the time, which is made to feel longer by
_Saved_by_the_Bell_ alumnus Gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging.  That said,
once Cohn and company do build some comic momentum, they mishandle it.  The
introduction of the manic, psychotic Cliff (Lochlyn Munro), a potential
roommate for Josh and Cooper, brings some demented life to the uninspired
proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less
interesting candidates: paranoid nerd Buckley (Randy Pearlstein) and
British death rocker Matt (Corey Page).  One wishes that Cliff would
reappear, but, as they say, be careful what you wish for.  Not
surprisingly, he does resurface, and it then becomes clear that this is a
character that is best taken in a small dose; almost immediately, his
extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty.
The same can be said about all of _Dead_Man_on_Campus_.  Whatever morbid
appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates, and the
self-absorbed characters, especially Cooper, pretty much grate from the
get-go.  _Dead_Man_ doesn't grow tiresome; it already _is_ once the clever
opening titles are through.  As it slogs along to a cheesy,
happy-for-all-parties conclusion, _Dead_Man_ lives up to its title and then
some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die, it still
insists on going on... like a zombie.

Title
Review for Analyze This (1999)
In its first two acts, Harold Ramis's comedy uproariously mines
co-scripters Kenneth Lonergan, Peter Tolan's premise for all its comedic
worth.  Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal make a terrific team as,
respectively, a tough mob boss and the shrink who reluctantly treats him
for recurring panic attacks.  Crystal's effectiveness comes as no
surprise (OK, maybe so in light of recent pathetic efforts such as
_Forget_Paris_ and _My_Giant_), but the true comedic firecracker of the
two is DeNiro, who is explosively funny taking a self-deprecating spin on
his usual mafia screen persona.
So when DeNiro's character disappears for a good chunk of the home
stretch, so does the explosive energy of his performance and presence. 
Strangely enough, Crystal cannot pick up the comedic slack; the film's
climax is his showcase, and his schtick comes off as just that, schtick,
in comparison to DeNiro's relaxed comic ease.  One performer who could
have possibly risen to the challenge is co-star Lisa Kudrow, but she is
woefully underused in the equally as undeveloped role of Crystal's
fiancee.  But even if it does not end quite as well as it begins,
_Analyze_This_ offers more laughs than any other comedy so far released
in 1999.

Title
Review for Galaxy Quest (1999)
_Galaxy_Quest_ (PG) *** (out of ****)
Is there an easier target in all of contemporary pop culture than
_Star_Trek_?  The hambone acting, the cheesy sets, the ridiculously
convoluted scientific jargon, and--the pičce de résistance--the
stereotypically geeky, obsessive fan following--what is there not to poke
good-natured fun at?  So the makers of the thinly-veiled _Trek_ spoof
_Galaxy_Quest_ have it fairly easy; the set-up is all there, and all that's
needed is the follow-through.  Happily, unlike a number of recent cinematic
send-ups, _Galaxy_ doesn't drop the ball.
A big help is that writers David Howard and Robert Gordon have come up with
a clever story on which to hang the _Trek_ gags.  The film takes its title
from a _Trek_-like sci-fi TV series whose cult following is stronger than
ever well over a decade after cancellation.  And, like the original _Trek_
cast, the only work the _Quest_ crew seems to get these days are appearances
at conventions.  But the role of their lives comes when a group of space
aliens called Thermians, having seen all of the _Quest_ episodes and
believing them to be actual spacefaring adventurers, enlists the crew's aid
in combating an evil monster.
This framework gives director Dean Parisot ample room to stage some
effects-heavy action sequences.  The younger members in the audience will
especially enjoy these sequences, such as some elaborate space chases and an
encounter with a rock monster.  This is not to say that adults won't find
enjoyment from these sections as well, for all the effects work in the film
is first-rate.
What will appeal to the older set even more, however, is the smart, edgy
humor, which begins with the characters.  Tim Allen plays the pompous
Shatner-esque Jason Nesmith, who played Peter Quincy Taggart, the commander
of _Quest_'s central spaceship, the Protector.  Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney
Weaver) is eager to shake the stigma of being the show's token cheesecake,
Lt. Tawny Madison, the "communications expert" whose only job was to repeat
everything the computer said.  Alexander Dane's (Alan Rickman) years of
cutting his acting teeth on the Shakespearean stage went down the drain once
he was typecast in his _Quest_ role, half-alien Dr. Lazarus.  The other crew
members for this mission are Tech Sgt. Chen, played by the non-Asian Fred
Kwan (Tony Shalhoub); Laredo, the Protector's 10-year-old navigator, played
by the now-adult Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell); and Guy Fleegman (Sam
Rockwell), a rabid _Quest_ fan who once had a bit part in the show as a
nondescript officer.
As anyone with a passing familiarity with _Star_Trek_--and thus the world of
_Galaxy_Quest_--would know, the nondescript officer is always the first to
go, and thus Guy fears for his life while in space.  Clichés such as these
are gleefully satirized throughout the film, such as touchstone mantras (not
surprisingly, Alexander is sick of reciting his) and defused bombs whose
countdown timers stop only at the one-second mark.  Not escaping the aim of
the writers are those fanatical fans who know every last technical detail of
the show.  Of course, the real test of the jokes is if they are playable to
a _Trek_-oblivious viewer, and no one needs to have any familiarity in that
area to get them (though it certainly helps).
As is the case with all family-friendly comedies, _Galaxy_Quest_ isn't above
some straightfaced would-be tear-wringing moments, but the forays into cheap
sentimentality are easily forgiven when everyone involved in the production
is of such high spirit and intelligence.  When I say that _Galaxy_Quest_ is
a fun time for the entire family, I mean it; it's clean, has all the
requisite eye candy and slapstick for the younger set, and--most
distinguishing of all--an uncommon level of sophistication for the adults.

Title
Review for Four Rooms (1995)
Four Rooms (R) **
        Quite needless to say, I did not enter the first showing of Four 
Rooms on opening day (Christmas Day) the most unbiased viewer.  Despite 
the critical drubbing it had received following its lackluster premiere 
at the Toronto Film Festival, I was eager to see this omnibus anthology 
comedy written and directed by four different independent directors, two of 
whom being a couple of my absolute favorites, the incredibly talented (and 
all-around swell guy) Robert Rodriguez and my namesake, Mr. Brown himself, 
Quentin Tarantino (Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell are the other 
two).  Instead of fearing the worst, I took my seat in the fairly crowded 
auditorium willing to give everyone involved the benefit of the doubt.  I'd 
probably have been better off expecting the worst, for I probably would have 
enjoyed this slapdash stew of mostly unfunny gags a little more and not have 
been so utterly disappointed.
        The film takes place on New Year's Eve at the Mon Signor Hotel, 
and bellhop Ted (Tim Roth), the only staffer on duty, provides the only 
link between the four tales, getting involved in bizarre goings-on in 
four different rooms.
        The first tale is Anders's "The Missing Ingredient," about a coven of 
witches (Valeria Golino, Sammi Davis, Ione Skye, Lili Taylor, and a 
surprisingly adequate Madonna) who attempt to resurrect their goddess Diana 
(Amanda deCadenet) with a strange brew (which, coincidentally, was the 
segment's original title).  The final ingredient in their brew is fresh sperm,
and they enlist Ted to provide the goods.  Word is that over twenty minutes 
were cut from the finished film following the Toronto premiere, and a good 
chunk of that missing footage appears to have been from this story, for, as it
stands in its current version, is neither funny nor makes any complete sense. 
There's no comic payoff at all, and it doesn't really "end"--it just stops.  
None of the actors are given much to do although Roth's bizarre mannerisms and 
delivery are good for a chuckle here or there.
        Ted is "The Wrong Man" of Rockwell's segment of the same 
name, in which our trusty bellhop is mistaken for the lover of a woman 
(Jennifer Beals) who is bound and gagged and held hostage at gunpoint by her 
husband (David Proval of Mean Streets fame).  Unlike Anders's piece, this 
vignette does build up to a big joke, but that joke isn't all that funny 
(unless, perhaps, you find the rattling off of numerous euphemisms for 
"penis" hilarious), and the road to that joke is quite bumpy and slow, 
with no real laughs.  Sharp-eyed viewers will recognize Lawrence Bender, 
producer of the film and Tarantino's partner at A Band Apart Productions, 
in a cameo.  Again, the best thing about the piece is Roth, who has a 
manic energy that is unmatched by the other players or the writer-director.
        Manic energy is in abundance in the third room, Rodriguez's "The 
Misbehavers," the only truly hilarious segment.  Ted is left in charge of two 
boisterous young children (Lana McKissick and Danny Verduzco) when their 
parents (Tamlyn Tomita and Antonio Banderas, in fine form) go out for a 
night on the town.  Hilarity ensues when a syringe, alcohol, and a dead 
body are thrown into the mix, leading to a raucous finish.  It all plays 
better than it sounds, thanks to the expert direction by Rodriguez and the 
comic timing and prowess of Roth, Banderas, McKissick, and Verduzco.  This
segment is the film's true saving grace.
        The most disappointing, but not the worst, piece of the puzzle is 
Tarantino's closing bit, "The Man From Hollywood."  Quentino himself 
stars as Chester Rush, an egomaniacal movie star who gets Ted to play the 
impartial moderator of a twisted bet between himself and a member of his 
entourage (Paul Calderon, who played the bartender in Pulp Fiction).  The 
vignette ends with a nifty joke, but it's slow going getting there, for 
Tarantino's dialogue lacks his trademark snap, and his rather lengthy 
takes only contribute to the sluggish pace.  Jennifer Beals's character from 
the Rockwell segment and an unbilled Bruce Willis also appear, but add little,
if anything to the mix.  Maybe it's my bias talking, but ol' Q's acting isn't 
half bad here (then again, I can't say that I ever really had a problem with 
his acting), and Roth once again maintains his dignity.  But this vignette 
feels rather forced, with none of the soul or passion in previous 
Tarantino efforts.
        If anything, Four Rooms _is_ outrageous and far from a tough sit, 
but as a comedy, it fails to deliver the goods.  It is a noble but failed 
filmic experiment that maybe isn't quite as bad as its detractors have been 
saying, but is by no means that good, either.  Expect this one to check 
out of theatres soon.
12 Monkeys (R) **
        This ambitious thriller is a messy melange of action, adventure, 
sci-fi, romance, horror, and unintentional comedy.  A bald Bruce Willis 
plays an inmate from an unspecified future year sent back in time to 1996 
to try to trace the origins of a virus responsible for wiping out 99% of 
the earth's population; Madeleine Stowe is a psychiatrist who ultimately 
comes to his aid; and an inexplicably Golden-Globe-nominated Brad Pitt is 
a mental patient who could hold the key to the mysterious riddle of the 
12 monkeys.  Fine efforts by Willis and Stowe, stunning production 
design in the future sequences, and director Terry Gilliam's keen visual
sense can't make up for a laughable, scenery-devouring Pitt; Gilliam's
plodding pacing; and a script (by David and Janet Peoples, inspired by the
film La Jetee) that's all over the map and spread much too thin.  Only the
final moments achieve the haunting, lingering sense of dread for which
Gilliam appears to strive (and falls short) for the entire 130-minute
running time.
Heat (R) *** 1/2
        Michael Mann's ambitious crime saga is far from the action 
spectacle it's being sold as, but it is an insightful dramatic look about 
the relationship between cops, criminals, and the women in their lives.  
Al Pacino is in over-the-top Frank Slade/Scent of a Woman mode as a Los 
Angeles police detective determined to take down master criminal Robert 
DeNiro, who is even more reserved here than he was in Casino.  
Writer-director Mann sometimes overreaches, such as including an 
unnecessary subplot involving a serial killer, but the overall package is 
still worth a look; an intense coffee shop talk between the 
two leads is worth the admission price alone, as is a spectacular 
shootout and the transcendent finale.  Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Amy 
Brenneman, and Tom Sizemore, among others, round out the fine ensemble.
Leaving Las Vegas (R) *** 1/2
        This grim Vegas romance between a man (Nicolas Cage) determined to 
drink himself to death and a hard-luck prostitute (Elisabeth Shue) is the 
definitive downer--which isn't to say that it is a complete drag to sit 
through (although it _is_ a difficult sit).  The powerful work of Cage 
and Shue and writer-director Mike Figgis make for a haunting, 
heartbreaking film that does deserve most of the many critical plaudits 
it has been receiving.  Thankfully, Boxing Helena's Julian Sands only 
turns up very briefly as Shue's Latvian pimp.
Nixon (R) ****
        You can take the man away from Natural Born Killers, but you 
apparently can't take the natural born killer out of the man, for Oliver 
Stone's fascinating bio of the late, lamented president is not lacking in 
stylistic pyrotechnics--a number of Stone's NBK tactics are here, 
such as constant shifts between color and black and white, the use of 
many types of film stocks, and the superimposing of words over scenes 
(this time in foreign characters--some type of subliminal suggestion, 
Oliver?).  In any case, this is a riveting tragedy, the moving tale of a 
man who had it all--or so he thought--and saw it all fall to pieces.  
Anthony Hopkins is fabulous as Tricky Dick, leading a very strong ensemble 
including James Woods, Bob Hoskins, David Hyde Pierce, and Joan Allen, 
particularly impressive as Pat Nixon.  One small complaint: the first 
name of actress Bridgette Wilson, last seen in Mortal Kombat and seen in 
a small role here, is misspelled as "Bridgitte" in both the opening and closing 
credits.  Regardless, one of the best of the year.

Title
Review for Shadow Conspiracy (1997)
Shadow Conspiracy (R) no stars (out of ****)
Movies released in January typically come in three types: (1) wide
releases of year-end limited engagements (Evita); (2) unpretentious
crowdpleasers (Metro); and (3) long-delayed movies that are finally cleared
from the studio shelves.  Falling under the latter category (along with The
Relic) is Shadow Conspiracy, and after sitting through this Charlie Sheen
thriller, it's no mystery why it has collected dust for nearly a year--it
stinks.
Sheen stars as presidential assistant Bobby Bishop, whose brilliant
speechwriting skills won the nameless Chief Executive (Sam Waterston) a
second term.  After a prominent professor is mysteriously murdered, Bishop,
with the help of reporter--and, natch, former flame--Amanda Givens (Linda
Hamilton) uncovers a deadly conspiracy lurking within the shadows of the
government (hence the film's title).
It would be easy to dismiss Shadow Conspiracy on the terms of its
writing and directing, which is abysmal.  Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs's script
is not only predictable and hackneyed, but cornball as well.  It's quite
telling when the film's most original moment is also its most ludicrous--the
unintentionally hilarious climax where an armed, remote-controlled toy
helicopter mows down a room full of people.  For all the chases director
George P. Cosmatos packs into the film (which is pretty much one long
chase), there's no excitement, no energy.
Cosmatos's biggest mistake, however, comes in the film's most
glaring flaw--the casting.  No offense to Mr. Sheen, but it's quite hard to
buy him as a brilliant presidential assistant whose skill with words is held
solely responsible for the President's reelection.  Not helping matters is
the fact that we get virtually no scenes where he's doing his job; the
casting wouldn't be so hard to swallow if we saw the guy at work.  Hamilton
is a talented actress, but after the indelible impression of her machisma in
T2, she just can no longer be bought as "the girl" in an action film,
regardless of how hard she tries.  But it's not like she tries hard, or at
all, here anyway.  Aside from miscasting, there's typecasting.  Donald
Sutherland plays Sheen's enigmatic mentor at the White House.  Do you think
_he_ could have something to with the conspiracy?  Sutherland as a bad guy?
You think?
After what is sure to be the poor box office performance of Shadow
Conspiracy, folks at Hollywood Pictures will probably wish they had left
this wretched excuse for a thriller collecting dust in the shadows of the
Disney vault.

Title
Review for AntiTrust (2001)
_Antitrust_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
If I hadn't already been aware that it was January, _Antitrust_ would
have been a stinging jolt of reality.  This thriller in name only is all
too characteristic of the cinematic scrap heap that is the first month of
the year: surface slickness in lieu of the slightest sign of substance.
With the toplining female stars being Rachael Leigh Cook and Claire
Forlani, one expects the male lead to be their respective
_She's_All_That_ and _Boys_and_Girls_ paramour, Freddie Prinze Jr. 
Thankfully, the poster boy for teen schlock is nowhere to be found in
_Antitrust_; unfortunately, the person in his place is no better: fellow
_I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer_ star and _Tiger_Beat_ staple, Ryan
Phillippe.   The improbably cast Phillippe plays the improbably named
Milo Hoffmann, a brilliant young computer programmer (!) who is suddenly
recruited to join big-name firm NURV (an acronym for "Never Underestimate
Radical Vision," if you had to ask) by its Bill Gates-ish founder, the
insanely wealthy and brilliant Gary Winston (Tim Robbins).
Or maybe Winston isn't so brilliant, for it is not long before Milo
deduces that his mentor's revolutionary, monopoly-pushing ideas are
actually stolen from young programmers from across the country--who have,
perhaps not so coincidentally, all died mysterious deaths.  When the
latest victim of a shady, untimely demise is none other than Milo's best
friend/sacrificial token minority Teddy Chen, Milo sets out to find the
truth, a task that proves to be not as difficult as finding a trustworthy
ally (hence the oh-so-clever double entendre of a title).
Writer Howard Franklin's premise is lifted directly from John Grisham's
_The_Firm_ (albeit with a chic computer angle), but given Hollywood's
generally environmentally conscious attitude regarding story ideas,
that's not so much a problem as _Antitrust_'s failure to generate the
faintest hint of suspense.  When one of the big would-be nailbiting set
pieces is a frantic search for sesame seeds in some home-cooked Chinese
cuisine (don't ask), any hopes of experience real thrills are quickly
laid to rest--not to mention those of finding any trace of basic
believability.  Add in Peter Howitt's overwrought direction (heavy on the
meaningful montage and strategic slo-mo) and the urge to laugh at all the
flabbergasting happenings is impossible to stifle.
The cast appears to operate under the belief that the more serious they
take the ludicrous material, the better; were they ever mistaken. 
Casting Phillippe, who has heretofore displayed a very limited acting
range at best, is always a huge risk, but giving this pretty boy the role
of a brain is a flat-out invitation for disaster.  It takes more than a
simple pair of glasses to add wisdom to the frozen male model pout of his
face, and his affectless voice further mangles the already-awkward,
techno-jargon-heavy dialogue.  Cook and Forlani's work essentially boils
down to varying degrees of deer-in-the-headlights looks, but to be fair,
it's hard to imagine anyone having a clear idea how to tackle the
barely-thought-out female roles.  Cook's role as Milo's co-worker Lisa
Calighan is especially problematic, thanks to an arbitrary "dark secret"
that plays into the story in the most insulting way imaginable.  Robbins
was obviously brought aboard to give _Antitrust_ some appearance of
class, but he takes a general cue from Howitt's direction by overplaying
the one-dimensional villainy.
_Antitrust_ is this year's _The_Skulls_: a glossy product where a
teenybopper idol is plopped into an intelligence-free thriller-type
vehicle.  But I can't imagine this film eking out the same frightfully
decent box office take as that equally inane Joshua Jackson showcase;
after all, the fawning female Phillippe fans hankering for a hit of the
hottie hunk don't get anything on par with _The_Skulls_'
Josh-running-on-a-pier-in-a-snug-singlet scene.  And if _Antitrust_ isn't
even good for cheap exploitation of its heartthrob star for his
adolescent admirers, then it truly is worthless for all audiences.

Title
Review for Faculty, The (1998)
Questions pondered during _The_Faculty_ (all apologies to Roger Ebert,
whose _Halloween:_H20_ review inspired this piece):
*Why do all (or, at least, most) Kevin Williamson scripts begin the same
way?
That is, with an extended set piece that ends with a murder, usually of
a recognizable star.  Here it's _Cheers_ and _Chicago_ star Bebe
Neuwirth, who plays Miss Drake, principal of Herrington High School,
located somewhere in Ohio.
*Why do high school movies always bunch together a diverse range of
students who would never interact in real life?
The film's focal group: Chilly newspaper editor Delilah (Jordana
Brewster), geeky Casey (Elijah Wood), jock-turned-wannabe-brain Stan
(Shawn Hatosy), loner goth chick Stokely (Clea DuVall), perky country
bumpkin Marybeth (Laura Harris), and brilliant but misguided Zeke (Josh
Hartnett), a drug manufacturer.
*Speaking of Hartnett, why doesn't he ever use a comb?
The _H20_ co-star's case of "perpetual bedhead" (as dubbed by
_Entertainment_Weekly_) gets no better in this film.  In fact, it gets
worse.
*Why would a babe like Delilah be romantically linked with a
dorky-looking guy like Stan?
Because she's also the head cheerleader and he the football team
captain, of course.
*What is the appeal of Usher beyond his music?
The current prince of R&B is strangely robbed of all charisma not
singing a note and keeping his shirt on in the small role of Gabe, Stan's
eventual successor as football team captain.
*What the hell is Harry Knowles doing in this film?  And in a scene with
Salma Hayek, no less?
The webmaster of the notorious Ain't It Cool News site appears in a bit
role as a teacher.  Mercifully, we're only given one close shot of his
face--a reaction take.  Hard to believe, but Knowles is an even worse
actor than he is a writer.
*Speaking of Hayek, why does director Robert Rodriguez always cast her in
his films?
...not that I'm complaining, of course.  Here, the divine Miss H. plays
the school's Nurse Harper, whose nasty cough disappears when she's
afflicted with a more, say, unusual ailment.  As if being an impossibly
gorgeous school nurse weren't unusual enough.
*Can anyone buy Amazonian former Bond Girl Famke Janssen as a mousy
English teacher?
Apparently, neither can Williamson nor Rodriguez, as Janssen's Miss
Burke and most of the characters undergo a 180-degree turn as a
mysterious--perhaps alien--force corrupts the school faculty and, before
long, the students themselves.
*Has Robert Patrick ever been more perfectly cast since
_Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day_?
The actor effectively revives his famously ice-cold stare as football
coach Willis, who, with drama teacher Mrs. Olson (Piper Laurie), is the
apparent figurehead in the bizarre goings-on at Herrington.  Patrick is
just one of the many amusing casting touches, along with Hayek, Janssen,
Laurie (from _Carrie_ and _Twin_Peaks_), Neuwirth, Jon Stewart, Susan
Willis (known to viewers of _All_My_Children_ as malevolent maid Helga),
and even--to a certain novelty value extent--Knowles.
*Is there a more talented genre film director currently working than
Rodriguez?  Or a more clever horror movie writer than Williamson?
Only these talented two can turn such a blatant
_Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_ ripoff/homage (with touches of _Alien_
and _Species_) into such an enjoyable--and wonderfully witty--romp.  They
have a clear awareness of the absurdity of the premise, but that doesn't
prevent them from delivering the suspenseful goods.  Williamson's script
continually serves up surprising twists as it dishes out often hilarious
doses of irony; and Rodriguez keeps the action moving at rapid-fire speed
for maximum excitement.  Whether it be lowbrow comedy (his segment in
_Four_Rooms_), go-for-broke action (_El_Mariachi_ and _Desperado_),
teensploitation (this and _Roadracers_), or horror (this and
_From_Dusk_till_Dawn_), Rodriguez always displays boundless energy and
creativity.  Helping his cause as in _Dusk_ is the superlative effects
work by the KNB Group, all done within an economical budget.
*Will there a bigger, better blast of pure, unpretentious, popcorn
entertainment this holiday season?

Title
Review for Summer Catch (2001)
_Summer_Catch_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
        Freddie Prinze Jr.'s movie career continues with _Summer_Catch_, and if
that's not enough to bring fear to the hearts of intelligent moviegoers
everywhere, this will: it's a sports-themed romantic comedy-drama.  "Romantic
comedy" as in giving his target teenybopper audience all that lovey-dovey crap
that first endeared him to the shrieking _TRL_ demographic with 1999's
_She's_All_That_; "sports-themed" as in Prinze trying to show to any guys in the
theatre that he isn't such a girlyman; and, most painful of all, "drama" as in
Prinze wanting to prove to his many (justified) critics that he, in fact, does
possess range.  I'm sure he has one, but this is acting, not kitchen appliances,
we're talking about here, and _Summer_Catch_ won't hold much, if any, appeal to
anyone outside Prinze's limited fan base.
        This fact is made all too explicitly clear in the opening stages of the
film when Prinze's Ryan Dunne runs around a baseball field... wearing only
women's thong underwear.  From this point, it's obvious that the appeal of the
story of _Summer_Catch_ is moot; one's enjoyment of the film is ultimately
tested by whether or not such an image of a bare-assed Prinze sets off one's gag
reflex.  But without such a scene, perhaps the story would have been just as
boring to teenage girls as it would be to anyone else.  Ryan is a pitcher for a
team in the Cape Cod Baseball League; for one reason or another, the current
season is his last chance to catch the attention of pro scouts.  But his focus
on the game is shaken when he falls for the wealthy Tenley Parrish (Jessica
Biel), for whose family he and his father do gardening work.
        Thus begins all sorts of purported drama revolving around class
differences, following your heart, believing in your abilities, and so on. 
Director Mike Tollin and writers Kevin Falls and John Gatins' already humdrum
material is made more vapid by the leads.  Biel, who rather distressingly looks
at least a full decade older than her 19 years, is at least only flat and
unconvincing in her handful of "dramatic" scenes, which is more than can be said
for the ever-embarrassing Prinze.  His attempt at an accent comes and mostly
goes, and as in all his previous films, he uses the same eyes bulging/mouth
agape look to convey the entire spectrum of emotions.
        Prinze's lack of any acting talent is the only source of laughs in
_Summer_Catch_.  The intentional comedic element in the film is either tired or
just plain stupid.  Falling into the former category is Matthew Lillard, once
again playing goofy sidekick to Prinze (which he will yet again do in next
year's _Scooby-Doo_).  In the latter category are the inordinate number of jokes
involving women's lingerie: Lillard is also seen in a thong; a heavy-set woman
is shown in revealing lingerie (just one of the film's oh-so-funny jokes at the
expense of larger women); and, most bizarre of all, an uncredited, lace-clad
Beverly D'Angelo plays a character who apparently likes to put fruits and
vegetables in her nether regions.
        True to sports movie formula, _Summer_Catch_ ends with a big game scene.
 Just like the rest of the film, there are no surprises to be had--except that
somehow, some way, the fluke that is Freddie Prinze Jr.'s film career has
managed to go on for another couple of hours.

Title
Review for Anastasia (1997)
Months before its release, Fox's epic animated musical Anastasia had been
touted as the first legitimate challenge to Disney's animation empire,
which looked more vulnerable than ever after the disappointing box office
(and, as it turns out, merchandising) performance of the fun-but-phoned-in
Hercules.  Now that the film has arrived in theatres, does the Mouse indeed
have reason to worry?  During its exquisite first twenty or so minutes, I
found myself agreeing with the buzz, but the film soon collapses under the
weight of convention, becoming a  merely pleasant entertainment.
A harrowing prologue set in 1916 swiftly gives us the necessary backstory:
during a revolution the entire Russian royal family is killed save for the
czar's youngest daughter, Anastasia (spoken by Kirsten Dunst, sung by Lacey
Chabert), who is lost after escaping from the palace; and her grandmother,
Dowager Empress Marie (Angela Lansbury), who left Russia for Paris just
before the unrest.  Then the film flashes forward in time, jumping into its
buoyant opening number, "A Rumor in St. Petersburg," which introduces the
main action: the presumed-dead princess is rumored to be alive, and with
their eye on a possible financial reward from the Empress, con men Dimitri
(spoken by John Cusack, sung by Jonathan Dokuchitz) and Vladimir (Kelsey
Grammer) seek out a young woman who can be a believable Anastasia stand-in.
 While a big opening production number is part of the Disney formula,
directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman approach it in a fresh way.  In Disney
films, the characters do little more than sing and slightly sway to the
music; here, the style is more live-action Broadway and MGM, with
background characters forming a full-on dance chorus, spontaneously
breaking into heavily choreographed moves.
Dimitri and Vlad ultimately find their perfect impostor in orphan Anya
(spoken by Meg Ryan, sung by Liz Callaway), and that's no accident--she
truly _is_ Anastasia, but with barely any recollection of her royal past.
Freshly released from an unpleasant orphanage, Anya articulates her dream
of having a family in the stirring "Journey to the Past."  This number is
equivalent to the Disney "I Want" song in function, but once again the
stage-influenced execution sets it apart, with Anya literally prancing her
way through the snow-covered forest and even capping her song by
dramatically raising her arms into the air (you almost expect the movie to
pause for audience applause).
Right before Anya meets up with the scheming duo comes a truly stunning,
magical moment--as it turns out, the film's way-too-premature peak.  She
steps foot in the ballroom of the abandoned palace, crooning the hauntingly
beautiful "Once Upon a December," a lullaby her grandmother used to sing
with her when she was young.  After a single verse, the ghosts of the past
waltz in through the windows, enveloping her, creating a lavish ball out of
thin air.
By this song's end, the glitter and glamour disappears, and so does much
of the luster of the film.  The songs by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens
(the latter of whom holds a special place in my and many others' hearts for
her enduring work on ABC's Schoolhouse Rock!) become increasingly
forgettable, and even worse, the story loses some steam.  The strict
adherence to the established Disney formula becomes a hindrance.  There is
really no dramatic need to include an out-and-out villain in the piece,
but, true to convention, there is one: evil monk Rasputin (spoken by
Christopher Lloyd, sung by Jim Cummings), whose supernatural curse on the
royal family caused its near-destruction.  While the dying Rasputin's plot
does lead to some standout sequences (in particular a suspenseful and
spectacular sea storm scene), and the running gag of his body parts
constantly fall off is amusing, I never felt as if he and his sidekick,
wisecracking albino bat Bartok (Hank Azaria), played a necessary role in
this story; they seemed to be shoehorned in for formula's sake.  More
interesting and involving than the good-versus-evil plot is the romantic
sparring between Anya and Dimitri; this may sound odd, but Ryan and Cusack
generate a lot of chemistry with their voices.  But the resolution to their
romance is far from satisfying.  Instead of being moved by the ending, I
was merely pleased.
One thing, however, does remain consistently impressive throughout
Anastasia, and that is the visuals.  The animation is a little ragged and
not nearly as fluid as Disney work, but the artwork is outstanding.  From
its beautiful handdrawn images to the three-dimensional computer-generated
work, all shot in  the 2.35:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio (the first animated
feature to be shot so since 1959's Sleeping Beauty), Anastasia truly looks
and feels like an epic even when the goings-on are less so.
In the end, the heavily hyped Anastasia does not announce Fox's animation
division as a challenger to Disney's throne.  What it does announce,
however, is Fox as a _potential_ challenger.  Anastasia may not be great,
but it is good, and if the film is a jumping-off point for the fledgling
animation house, the Mouse should be prepared for a war.

Title
Review for Out of Sight (1998)
Chemistry between romantic leads can make or break a film, and never in
recent memory has it more "made" a film than in Steven Soderbergh's witty,
slick, sexy adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel.  _Out_of_Sight_ jumps
back and forth in time to tell the twisting tale of suave bank robber Jack
Foley (George Clooney, rebounding well after his disastrous turn as the
Caped Crusader), out to make one big score after escaping from prison; hot
on his trail--and hot _for_ him--is tough U.S. Marshal Karen Sisco (the
ever-sultry Jennifer Lopez), who falls hard for Jack's charms after being
briefly locked in a trunk with him during his prison break.
Although _Out_of_Sight_'s intricately structured plot requires the
audience's undivided attention, Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Frank
(who also adapted Leonard's _Get_Shorty_) are less concerned with story
than they are dialogue and the quirky characters that deliver it, and the
film offers a wide array of memorable personalities, such as Jack's
collaborators in the planned big heist: stoner Glenn (Steve Zahn); the
menacing Maurice, a.k.a. Snoopy (Don Cheadle); his clumsy bodyguard White
Boy Bob (Keith Loneker); and Jack's partner Buddy (Ving Rhames).  Most
memorable of all, though, is the central duo of Jack and Karen, who are
both acutely aware of the danger of their mutual attraction yet are
completely powerless to resist the thrill.  The impossibly glamorous and
charismatic pair of Clooney and Lopez absolutely sizzle from their first
moment together; the soulful, smoldering gazes they lay upon each other are
sexier than any explicit scene could ever be.  It is their effortless
rapport that carries the film and jumpstarts its sometimes-flagging energy.

Title
Review for Wings of the Dove, The (1997)
Washington Square (PG) *** (out of ****)
The Wings of the Dove (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
With each fall movie season comes a rash of literary adaptations dangled
like bait in the Academy voter pool, and more often than not these films
derive from the work of a single classic author.  This year's featured
author is Henry James, whose Washington Square and The Wings of the Dove
are brought to the screen in intelligent, skillfully crafted translations
that tower over last year's James adaptation, Jane Campion's maddeningly
obtuse The Portrait of a Lady.
Washington Square centers on the romance between gawky, naive Catherine
Sloper (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the daughter of the wealthy Dr. Austin
Sloper (Albert Finney), and dashing but penniless Morris Townsend (Ben
Chaplin).  Naturally, their relationship does not sit well with Austin, who
suspects Morris's true motives--after all, how could a poor young man
honestly be enamored by the meek and woefully unrefined Catherine?--and
does all within his power to keep his daughter and the suspected golddigger
apart.
Agnieszka Holland's film is a joy to look at, yet for a film that focuses
on a grand passion, the final product is strangely cold and distant.  But
that shortcoming is made up for by the work of the cast.  Leigh may sound
like a peculiar casting choice for a costume drama, but her trademark
mannerisms and mumbly elocution are a perfect fit for the insecure, awkward
Catherine.  She has a nice rapport with the charming Chaplin, who sports a
convincing Yank accent.  Finney's Austin makes a despicable, yet archly
funny, villain, and Maggie Smith provides some delightful comic relief as
Catherine's hopelessly romantic Aunt Lavinia.
A more involving James adaptation is Iain Softley's swifter-moving and
more understated The Wings of the Dove, which takes a more complex slant on
the rich girl-poor boy romance.  The woman of wealth here is Kate Croy
(Helena Bonham Carter), who has a forbidden affair with common journalist
Merton Densher (Linus Roache).  Kate and Merton long to marry, but Kate
refuses to give up her lofty position in society and the luxuries her
snobby aunt (Charlotte Rampling) provides her.  When wealthy, ailing
American Milly Theale (Alison Elliott) arrives in London, Kate and a
reluctant Merton engage in a cruel scheme that could ultimately enable them
to marry without sacrificing Kate's riches.
What makes Wings soar above the fairly black-and-white Washington are the
richly shaded characters and relationships, brought to vivid life by the
central trio of actors.  Despite her evil plot, Bonham Carter never allows
the audience to lose the feeling that Kate truly does care about
Milly--it's just that she cares about herself even more.  Predictably,
Merton develops feelings for Milly as well, but Softley and Roache wisely
do not spell out whom he loves more, which creates genuine dramatic
tension.  Milly is weak in body, but deceptively so; inside she is strong
in spirit and quite clear of mind. The sparkling Elliott, who was just
about the only redeeming quality of last year's dreadfully overwrought
Sundance sensation The Spitfire Grill, delivers a quiet performance that is
astonishing in its power, most notably during a climactic tete-a-tete
between Milly and Merton.
Whether or not Washington Square and The Wings of the Dove, which have
both received favorable notices from critics, garner the hoped-for Oscar
nominations remains to be seen; there is no question, however, that they
are both quality pieces of filmmaking, with Wings being the worthier
contender.

Title
Review for What Lies Beneath (2000)
Act I: _Rear_Window_.  Claire thinks that the strange happenings in her
house could be a result of some suspicious goings-on with her neighbors
(James Remar and Miranda Otto), so she starts poking around where she
shouldn't.  Every once in a while, things predictably jump into frame
accompanied by a stinger chord on Alan Silvestri's score.  The only real
shock of this section is what a long waste of time it is (if you've seen
any of the advertising, you'll know exactly why).
Act II: "I see dead people."  The supernatural bent comes to the fore,
with Claire trading in amateur sleuthing for novice witchcraft in hopes
of contacting whatever apparition is haunting her home.  Zemeckis is able
to create some moments of tension and creepiness, particularly in one
sequence where Claire gets a bit too close to the ghost (again, if you've
seen any of the commercials, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about).
 But as Norman voices his increasing disbelief, so will you.
Act III: Slice and dice.  In a turn I was not at all prepared to take,
the disco
very of the rather down-to-earth truth transforms Claire into a helpless
and idiotic B-movie scream queen, paying no attention to common sense and
the rules of a horror movie.  Again, Zemeckis pulls off some impressive
moments and images.  The extended _Diabolique_ reference works better
than it rightfully should (a blatant _Psycho_ lift, however, far less
so), and in one bravura camera move, Zemeckis swoops the camera from
regular P.O.V. to right under the floor, as if it had magically become
transparent.  Still, this is your basic slasher movie climax, with Claire
running for her life as evil things have their way of grabbing at her.
Everyone involved in this film is clearly above the material.  As I have
stated, Zemeckis is able to generate some suspense out of some very silly
situations.  Ford acquits himself well in a fairly small role.  But the
one who maintains the most dignity--and rather ironically at that,
considering the ridiculous wringer she's put through--is Pfeiffer.  Her
character undergoes just as many radical shifts as everything else in the
film, but Pfeiffer's conviction and innate likability go a long way.
But, ultimately, she and what good there is in _What_Lies_Beneath_ isn't
quite enough to successfully bring together what is essentially three
movies in one--and despite the ready-for-a-promo sound of that
description, that is _not_ a good thing.

Title
Review for Center Stage (2000/I)
_Center_Stage_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
The young cast of unknowns in  _Center_Stage_ can all dance, which is a
very good thing indeed because virtually none of them can act.  And that,
of course, is a very, very bad thing when action shifts from the dance
studios of the American Ballet Academy to the outside lives of a
cross-section of students there.  Of course, those followed make a
diverse group: there's naive good girl Jody (Jennie Garth lookalike
Amanda Schull), who rooms with the talented smartass Eva (Zoë Saldana)
and Maureen (Susan May Pratt), the school's reigning diva; on the male
side are All-American good guy Charlie (Sascha Redetsky), Russian good
guy Sergei (Olympic figure skating champion Ilia Kulik), and bad boy
Cooper (Ethan Stiefel), the American Ballet Company's hot young star.
These characters all intersect and collide in predictable ways as they
deal with predictable personal issues.  Jody is quietly pursued by
Charlie, but she's drawn to Cooper.   Maureen slowly crumbles under the
pressure of her overbearing mother (Debra Monk) as a premed student (Eion
Bailey) aggressively woos her.  Eva butts heads with a strict teacher
(Donna Murphy) and the pompous head (Peter Gallagher) of the Academy over
her attitude.  And so on.
It may not sound so bad as described, but that's because I'm recounting
the film without any taste of screenwriter Carol Heikennen's dreary
dialogue, Nicholas Hytner's overly earnest direction, or the truly putrid
performances by these unpromising acting "talents."  (Something is
clearly amiss when the one character's development of bulimia is met with
laughter from the audience.)  The one exception is the spunky Saldana,
who is the only one to make her character appear to be a real person, let
alone one the audience comes to care about.  Whenever she's not onscreen
or no one is dancing (with the exception of the climactic ballet, which
is supposed to be "hip" and "revolutionary" but is actually quite
ridiculous), _Center_Stage_ is one trying watch.

Title
Review for Velvet Goldmine (1998)
_Velvet_Goldmine_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
After the disco debacle that was _54_, early signs seemed to indicate that
Miramax was about to commit another cinematic crime against a 1970s music
movement, glam rock, with Todd Haynes's _Velvet_Goldmine_.  The air of
anticipation surrounding it became something decidedly mixed once the film
premiered at Cannes, leaving audiences either hot or cold and garnering the
prize for "Best Artistic Contribution"--which sounded like a (pardon my
brusqueness) bullshit consolation award if I ever heard one.  But after
seeing the film, the Cannes award doesn't seem so bogus after all;
_Velvet_Goldmine_ is a true feast for the senses, a strange but ceaselessly
fascinating barrage of music and imagery.  The problem is, that's all it
is--words, pictures, and sound, with nothing in the center to hold it all
together.
For those of you unfamiliar with it, glam rock was a Brit-centered '70s
music movement, which, ironically enough, had just about nothing to do with
music itself.  Unlike disco, there is no distinct sound to glam rock; the
term was more a description of an attitude and a mode of dress: flashy
costumes, high platform heels, glitter makeup, and a general look of
androgyny--with the ambiguous sexuality to match; in short, sort of a
"flamboyant bisexual chic."
Unlike _54_, which didn't seem to have a clue as to what disco was,
_Velvet_Goldmine_ nails the glam rock milieu.  Haynes revels in all its
gaudy, garish glory, and not just by showcasing a lot of elaborately campy,
vampy musical performances by his central character, fictional glam rock
pioneer Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who does his own singing).  The
air of bold excess extends to the equally glittery visual style created by
Haynes, cinematographer Maryse Alberti, and editor James Lyons, which
employs quick edits, dreamlike imagery, and an appropriate air of
surrealism--after all, it was a time of almost surreal sexual freedom,
openness, and self-indulgence.  (One scene has Haynes reverting to his old
_Superstar:_The_Karen_Carpenter_Story_ tricks, staging one scene entirely
with dolls.)
Haynes has an obvious affection for the era, and perhaps it is that
passion for the glamour that distracted him from coming up with a
compelling story.  _Velvet_Goldmine_ traces the rise and fall of Brian,
whose life and mysterious disappearance is investigated in 1984 by reporter
Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), who has tried to live down his days as a
glam rock groupie.  Ironically, though, the more Arthur and, in turn, the
audience learns more about Slade, the more it becomes clear that,
underneath all the makeup and sequins, he's not a very interesting
personality--that is, if he even has one.  He sings and dresses up, but it
is never clearly defined who he exactly is.  Taking much more vivid shape
are the people in his life, such as American glam rocker Curt Wild (Ewan
McGregor, also providing his own vocals), with whom Brian has a sordid
sexual relationship; Brian's greedy manager Jerry Devine (Eddie Izzard);
and especially Brian's bitter American, Brit-wannabe wife Mandy (Toni
Collette, in the film's best performance).  Another writing misstep is the
clunky, forced way Haynes directly ties Arthur's past to Brian's; it would
have been less contrived if Arthur were simply a fan on the fringes.
Haynes does achieve what he sets out to do with _Velvet_Goldmine_, which,
according to the press notes, is to make "a valentine to the sounds and
images that erupted in and around London in the early 1970s."  But he
should have also thought to make something more than an affectionate
valentine--in other words, a fully realized and developed film.

Title
Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
Saving Private Ryan (R) ****  (out of ****)
"War is hell."  No one questions the veracity this statement--over time,
it has become less a saying than a truism--but rarely does anyone ever give
serious thought to what exactly it means.  The opening 25-minute sequence
of Steven Spielberg's _Saving_Private_Ryan_ should change all that.
Depicting the invasion of France on D-day, June 6, 1944, as seen through
the eyes of Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks), this section has a startling
visceral intensity that is cheapened by text descriptions.  To merely
describe the brutal, graphic violence, such as the severed limbs,
eviscerations, and the free-flowing and -gushing blood, is to discount its
sensory and emotional power; to describe it simply on those latter terms is
to diminish the bravery and honesty Spielberg exhibits in not shying away
from the raw carnage.  This bravura opening set piece is cinema in the
purest sense--the melding of audio, visuals, and all other individual
aspects of filmmaking into a greater whole: an experience whose effects are
not easily shaken, its memory not easily forgotten.  After the
well-intentioned but stately-to-a-chill _Amistad_, this explosive opening
announces that Spielberg has rebounded in a big way with this World War II
drama, a stunning piece of work that aims and hits the audience square in
the gut.
The "Private Ryan" that must be "saved" is one James Francis Ryan, the
only survivor of four brothers in active duty in the war effort; as some
type of humanitarian mission, Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall (Harve
Presnell) dispatches a squad led by Capt. Miller to find Pvt. Ryan and send
him home as comfort to his grieving mother.  The mission, of course, is not
without its complications, not the least of which is the disinterest of
Miller and his squad, who are not terribly keen (to say the least) on
risking their lives for that of one man--a man they do not even know.
Not surprisingly, the lives of some Capt. Miller's men are sacrificed
before they finally locate Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), but their loss makes
only a moderate impact.  _Private_Ryan_'s main weakness is the rather
one-dimensional crew with whom writer Robert Rodat surrounds Miller: Sgt.
Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns), Cpl. Upham (Jeremy
Davies), Pvt. Caparzo (Vin Diesel), Pvt. Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Pvt.
Jackson (Barry Pepper), and Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi).  Only the wimpy
kid Upham comes off as close to a fully-realized character, but most of
personality he exhibits can be attributed to Davies's vivid, anguished
performance.  The other actors do well, but their roles are more shallowly
written and developed, half boiling down to single characteristics: hothead
(Reiben), Jew (Mellish), Bible-quoter (Jackson); the remaining are
nondescript.  Maybe it was a conscious decision by Rodat and Spielberg to
objectify the squad much like how most who serve in military combat are
seen as walking statistics, but it makes the risk of their lives a gambit
curiously low in emotional involvement.
Compensating for the faceless squad members is the squad leader, Capt.
Miller,  _Private_Ryan_'s anchor in every way, ably leading his men and
serving as a strong, sympathetic emotional center amid the chaos.  Brought
to life in a well-modulated turn by Hanks, Miller is a consummate
professional and leader, but he is not immune to the psychological ravages
of war, which have now manifested themselves in the physical form of hand
tremors.  There are a couple of haunting wordless sequences where Miller
blankly watches the mayhem surrounding him like a lost child, bringing to
light a subconscious reason for his carrying out the "rescue" of Pvt. Ryan.
 It's not so much to follow orders and win a ticket home, as he says, but
rather to graft a purpose onto the senseless human toll, to put into
tangible human form the nebulous reasons behind the fighting--and his role
in all of it.
By the film's end, _Saving_Private_Ryan_ reveals itself to be a rather
ironic title.  If he is indeed "saved," he is actually more damned--alive,
yes, but living with the burden of the men who sacrificed and were willing
to sacrifice themselves for his life, and the lingering doubt that the life
he would go on to lead would fully amount to the ones it cost.  Ultimately,
it's not Pvt. Ryan's salvation that Capt. Miller and his crew are fighting
for--it's their own.

Title
Review for Dungeons & Dragons (2000)
_Dungeons_&_Dragons_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
Director Courtney Solomon spent the better part of ten years trying to
make his boyhood obsession, the perennially popular role playing game
Dungeons & Dragons, into a feature film, but none of the passion that
fact would entail ends up on screen.  What does show up all too clearly
in _Dungeons_&_Dragons_ is rookie helmer Solomon's lack of experience in
film, let alone with a project of such large, effects-laden scale.  D&D
enthusiasts have been clamoring for a film adaptation since the game came
on the scene 26 years ago, and while I am not a player myself, I am
certain that this sloppy slice of schlock is hardly what the fandom had
in mind.
The setting is a mythical medieval empire, and the 17-year-old Empress
Savina's (Thora Birch) goal of removing the class division between the
magic-practicing Mages and everyone else runs into a snag when the evil
wizard Profion (Jeremy Irons) turns her government advisors against her. 
Exactly how, I don't know.  But it's not so much control over the kingdom
that Profion wants than a magical rod--one that will bring red dragons
under his command.  The Empress possesses a rod that gives her power over
green dragons.  If this makes any sense to you, let me know, because it's
all an incoherent jumble to me.
In any event, a trio of plucky young people proves to be Profion and
henchman Damodar's (Bruce Payne) biggest obstacle in locating the coveted
rod.  They are fledgling young Mage Marina (Zoe McLellan) and the
thievery team of Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans).  True
to their larcenous roots, Ridley and Snails jump into the do-good biz in
hopes of pocketing a large reward, but, of course, the heroic instincts
within ultimately purify their intentions.
Given that the source material is a game, a weak plot is just about
expected (what isn't is just how inscrutable it also is, but that's
another issue entirely), for the emphasis should be on action set pieces.
 As I mentioned, I was never a D&D player, but I do know that navigation
through booby-trapped mazes and dungeons is a big part of the game (one
of the more exciting elements, from what I remember from friends who
played back in junior high).  So it would only follow that _D&D_ the
movie would be packed with such set pieces.  Alas, there's only one, and
a mighty underwhelming one at that, featuring unimaginative traps and
zero tension.  Filling in the rest of the requisite action beats in the
script credited to Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright are half-hearted
swordfights often punctuated with some very chintzy magic effects.
Which leads me to the other half of the title, the dragons.  The final
act certainly has their fair share of them, green and red, all flying
around and battling dragon and human alike.  Never mind that their sudden
arrival in the story is barely (if even that) explained; these creatures
are CGI creations that look every bit like digital FX work.  To top it
off, all the CG work, from the dragons to various animated backdrops to
simple magic dust, is not-so-seamlessly integrated into the live action. 
The only flourish that slightly convinces is a fairly simple ripple
effect used to depict teleportation holes.
Not only is Solomon obviously not able to pull off the technical aspects
of this project, he's also clueless with his cast.  Whalin and McLellan
are embarrassingly amateurish, the latter especially so, with her
invariably stilted line readings.  The insulting role of the buffoonish,
wisecracking African-American sidekick (we all know what ultimately lies
in store for this type of character) brings out the worst broad instincts
in Wayans.  Birch seems embalmed, her Amidala-lite costumes apparently
constricting her throat so that she speaks in a constant monotone.  Worst
of all, however, is the Oscar winner of the lot, Irons; Solomon
apparently thought that since he's such a reputable thespian, Irons
should not simply be given free rein, but no reins at all.  What a
horrendous mistake that turns out to be, for Irons is just one small step
short of foaming at the mouth in every single scene.
The big mistake, however, is making _Dungeons_&_Dragons_ in the first
place.  The reason why video game movies have all failed is that the
element of interactivity that made them so special to begin with is lost.
 Of course, the same idea holds true for a role playing game movie, but
there's an even larger miscalculation at play: the sights and scenarios
imagined during the course of playing such a game will always be more
vivid and exciting than those an FX crew could cook up--especially the
type of low-rent crew that can only be afforded by a neophyte director
with no formal training working with independently-raised overseas money.

Review for Poketto monsutaa: Maboroshi no Pokemon X: Lugia bakudan (1999)
_Pokémon_(The_Movie_2000):_The_Power_of_One_ (G) * 1/2
with _Pikachu:_The_Movie--Pikachu's_Rescue_Adventure_ (G) * 1/2
        As was the case with many kiddie fads before it, the TV anime phenomenon
_Pokémon_ is gradually flaming out after a period of frenzied excitement.
 But before Pikachu and his pals say make their final sayonara into the
sunset, they make one more big screen excursion with another two-film
compilation, this time released under the umbrella title
_Pokémon:_The_Movie_2000_.  If anything, both the main feature and the
opening short are better than their counterparts in last fall's
_Pokémon:_The_First_Movie_.  But that's not saying much at all.
        Unlike _Pikachu's_Vacation_, the curtain-raiser for _The_First_Movie_,
the opening "mini-movie" _Pikachu's_Rescue_Adventure_ has at least an
attempt at a plot.  As their masters take a nap in a park-like area,
Pikachu (the adorable yellow, rosy-cheeked, electrical-powered critter)
and his fellow Pokémon (pocket monsters, for the uninitiated) are free to
frolic in the water and surrounding wilds.  But a strong wind blows
Togepi, an egg Pokémon, down a hole into a magical forest, and Pikachu
and the others have to rescue him (her?  it?).  While the tots will
undoubtedly be entranced by the bright colors and the new characters that
are introduced, those over the age of 10 will have their patience tried
by the nonsensical mutterings of the Pokémon (all they are able to say
are their names--though in the case of Pikachu, it's still kind of cute).
 A trippy musical interlude will briefly shake adults out of their ennui,
however.
        As the feature presentation, _The_Power_of_One_, opens, it appears to
fall into the same trap that befell that last film,
_Mewtwo_Strikes_Back_--pretentiousness.  A solemn narrator goes on about
the elements of fire, lightning, and ice needing to be in harmony or else
the world would be destroyed, and I'm thinking that the _Pokémon_
creators have once again bitten off more than they can chew.
        But things quickly settle down into a more palatable Saturday
morning-level mood.  In a somewhat cheeky reference to rabid _Pokémon_
product collectors, the villain here is one Lawrence III, who is
determined to capture the bird Pokémon that control those aforementioned
elements--and the all-powerful guardian of the sea, Lugia--for his
personal collection.  As the title suggests, it is up to one person to
stop Lawrence III and restore balance to the planet--Ash (voiced by
Veronica Taylor), master of Pikachu and other Pokémon.
        There is a message behind _The_Power_of_One_, but it's not as
questionable as  that of _Mewtwo_Strikes_Back_.  This film's message is
your basic banal business about trying your best and whatnot.  It's
nothing kids haven't heard before, but it's something easier for them to
grasp--and easier for the film to support--than the jawdroppingly
hypocritical anti-violence stance in the last film (_Pokémon_ is about
little animals fighting each other, after all).
        That said, only those really in tune with the _Pokémon_ world (read:
children) will be able to make heads or tails of the specifics of the
story.  Then again, they will be the only ones who will be able to stay
completely alert during the film.  There's only so much shoddily-animated
explosions and plotless mayhem an adult can take before the eyelids start
to feel heavy.  Not helping matters is the absence of the television
series' infectiously bouncy theme song; in its place is "We All Live in a
Pokémon World," an even-worse-than-it-sounds R&B-ish ditty complete with
a rap bridge.
        It remains to be seen if the _Pokémon_ craze will survive long enough to
earn a stateside theatrical release release for the third _Pokémon_
feature, which was produced in Japan last year.  It's hard to tell if
_Pokémon_The_Movie_2000_ will be a late-inning shot in the arm for the
waning franchise or speed up its demise.  Both scenarios are plausible,
for the film is simply more of the same--which is all you need to know
when deciding whether or not to see it.

Title
Review for Thin Red Line, The (1998)
_The_Thin_Red_Line_ (R) **** (out of ****)
Love a film, hate a film, all points in between--I generally know what I
want to say and how to say it.  So why, then, do I feel so ill-equipped
to thoroughly articulate my feelings about Terrence Malick's
_The_Thin_Red_Line_?  Perhaps it's just my own limitations as a writer,
or maybe it's just the natural limitations of words themselves, which can
only fail to accurately describe the challenging but wholly intoxicating
experience of Malick's long-awaited return to the directorial chair. 
_The_Thin_Red_Line_ is something that completely transcends the medium--a
film is as close to pure poetry than anything I've ever seen onscreen.
To state that _The_Thin_Red_Line_ centers on a group of American
soldiers fighting for survival in the Guadalcanal conflict of World War
II is to say everything and nothing about the film.  A number of violent
combat scenes occupy most of the film's three-hour running time, but the
war itself is perhaps Malick's most remote concern--and the soldiers'. 
The central fight in which the soldiers are engaged is not necessarily
the one with Japanese troops: it is the unique personal struggle within
each of them.  And the one thing whose survival their fighting for is not
their lives, but their eternal souls.
Malick uses his favorite device, the voiceover (used extensively in both
of his previous films, 1973's _Badlands_ and 1978's _Days_of_Heaven_), to
intone each of the soldiers' inner ruminations.  Yet while the sounds of
the voices and their specific subjects differ, the "voice" remains
constant: a stream of oblique thoughts attempting to rationalize--and
find an escape from--the horror of war and the world that produces it. 
Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) searches for the light of beauty and order in
all things, from life in a simple native village to a comrade meeting a
tragic end.  Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) longs to find a numbness and truth
that will spare himself the psychological toll of his reality.  Pvt.
Bell's (Ben Chaplin) retreat is memories of his wife and his certainty
that they will be reunited--whether it be in this world or the next. 
Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) prays his salvation and that of the soldiers
that have become surrogate family.  Col. Tall (Nick Nolte), a
much-passed-over veteran in the twilight of his career, doggedly pursues
the one victory under his command that would serve as a vindicating
legacy.
_The_Thin_Red_Line_ plays less like a film than a piece of fine art,
which accounts for the immeasurable difficulty of describing and
analyzing it (and the rather dull-sounding synopsis).  Malick's
screenplay, based on James Jones's novel of the same name, is a
remarkably textured piece of work, directly and (mostly) indirectly
addressing themes of varying complexity.  As such, like a painting, one
needs to distance oneself to experience the full breadth of its thematic
resonance; the film just grows richer with time.
But also like a painting, the film is not without its surface delights
that can be immediately noticed and appreciated.  Chief among these is
John Toll's exquisite cinematography, which captures the beauty of both
the stillness and chaos that comes with battle, from blades of grass
blowing in the wind, to the mine and bomb blasts that seem to erupt to a
steady rhythm.  Not to be overlooked is the fine work of the large cast. 
Pvt. Witt is the character closest to a lead, and newcomer Caviezel has a
quiet, calming presence that fits his character's--and the
film's--low-key mood.  That said, I much preferred the work of two actors
in smaller roles: Chaplin, heartbreaking as the lovelorn Pvt. Bell; and
Koteas, touching as the perhaps too-honorable Capt. Staros.  Of the more
marquee names in the ensemble, Penn, Nolte, and (to a lesser extent) John
Cusack (as Capt. Gaff) have the beefiest roles, and they impress the most
in this group.  Cameos by John Travolta and especially George Clooney are
more distracting than anything else, and Woody Harrelson tries a bit too
hard to stand out among the crowd--and that he does, albeit for the wrong
reasons. 
The word that will undoubtedly be used most to describe
_The_Thin_Red_Line_ is "meditation," and that description could not be
more apt.  A person in a state of meditation outward appears to be doing
nothing, but he or she is engaging in an act of focus and clarity full of
rich internal rewards.  The similarly introspective nature of
_The_Thin_Red_Line_ accounts for the wildly polarized reaction to the
film; its detractors are obviously fixed on the blank exterior, while its
admirers are able to tap into the dense interior.  Chances are most
audiences will belong to the former group.  But much like another war-set
film not really about war, Francis Ford Coppola's _Apocalypse_Now_,
Terrence Malick's _The_Thin_Red_Line_ will receive its just due over
time.

Title
Review for Lost in Space (1998)
Back in February at the monthly Los Angeles Comic Book and Science Fiction
Convention, New Line Cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screen
update of the cult 1960s sci-fi TV show Lost in Space, complete with
in-person appearances by cast members Mimi Rogers, Matt LeBlanc, Lacey
Chabert, Jack Johnson, and even Gary Oldman.  That should have set off my
warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took
place at the convention was nearly five years ago, when none other than
Arnold Schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle... Last Action
Hero.  But no, like millions of others, I bought into the hype and "got
Lost."  If only I had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre and
spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster
wannabe.
You may find yourself wondering if director Stephen Hopkins and
screenwriter Akiva Goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film.
At the convention, Goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original
television series, and if that really is the case, I'd hate to see what he
does with concepts he only has mild interest in.  To say that his script
lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin
with--which there most certainly is not.  After the setup, in which the
Robinson family--father John (William Hurt, looking and sounding as spaced
out as he does in interviews), mother Maureen (Rogers, wasted), daughters
Judy (Heather Graham, ditto) and Penny (a heavily made-up Chabert, looking
like a junior version of Neve Campbell in Wild Things), and son Will (young
newcomer Johnson, making the best of it)--and pilot Don West (LeBlanc,
doing a bad Han Solo impression) find themselves lost in space after their
ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway Dr. Smith (a watered-down but
still-lively Oldman, cashing a paycheck and loving every minute), the
script's "stream" of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems
to be made up as it goes along--and Hopkins does little to make what does
go on the slightest bit interesting.  They encounter another ship.  They
board it.  Alien spiders attack them.  They return to their ship.  The
other one explodes.  They land on a deserted planet.  And so on.  An
attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act, but
Goldsman doesn't seem to understand the rules that come with using such a
story device; when one character's past self dies, the future incarnation
inexplicably lives on.
The look and effects should be Lost in Space's ace-in-the-hole, but
Hopkins even manages to botch that.  For a big-budget film, the visual
effects are incredibly shoddy.  In one composite background shot, I could
see the blue outline around Oldman; the various digital effects for the
space battle scenes look like... digital effects.  But nothing in those
shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as Blawp, a monkey-like space
creature that becomes Penny's pet.  Entirely computer-generated and every
inch showing it, Blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a Sony
PlayStation game.  Apparently Hopkins thought the same and tried
desperately to hide it; how else can one explain the graininess of Blawp's
composite shots with the human actors?  But in doing so, the seams are that
much more obvious.  You have to be severely visually impaired to not be
distracted when a grainy shot of Penny and Blawp is immediately followed by
a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of Judy.
New Line is hoping Lost in Space will become a big franchise much like the
long-running Star Trek cash cow at Paramount.  I don't think so.  In a few
years, the Lost in Space movie will likely live on not as a series but as
the obscure answer to a trivia question:  What film ended Titanic's 15-week
reign at the top of the weekend box office?

Title
Review for Anywhere But Here (1999)
More than anything, teenage Ann August (Natalie Portman) wants nothing
more than to escape the grasp of her kooky, overbearing mother Adele
(Susan Sarandon), who dragged her from Wisconsin to Beverly Hills to
start a new life.  And at certain moments during the film, one similarly
looks for an escape hatch; despite some engaging scenes and situations,
Wayne Wang's adaptation of Mona Simpson's novel cannot help but drag,
given that the film is pretty much a series of scenes with mother and
daughter alternately acting hot and cold toward each other.  What keeps
the film engaging is not Sarandon, who does a characteristically solid
but unremarkable job as Adele; but Portman, who, free from Queen
Amidala's kabuki makeup and upstaging hair design, once again proves to
be a young actress of extraordinary talent and stunning presence.  Her
piercing, layered performance deserves a better film around it.
More effective and affecting is Gavin O'Connor's indie production
_Tumbleweeds_, which bears more than a few similarities to
_Anywhere_but_Here_: long road trip (West Virginia to San Diego) with
mother Mary Jo Walker (Janet McTeer) and young daughter Ava (Kimberly J.
Brown); Mary Jo, fleeing a bad marriage, is an eccentric tart; the
mother-daughter relationship evolves as they struggle to make ends meet. 
But there is a special warmth in this film that is missing from the
other, particularly on the side of the mother.  While she often acts out
of selfishness (mostly her sexual appetite), Mary Jo is gentle and
attentive to Ava, and her love for her is never doubted; she is a more
fully realized character than _Anywhere_'s Adele, who is often so
self-involved that it's hard to care much about her.  McTeer, a British
stage actress, is perfect as Mary Jo, as is the 12-year-old Brown, and
the two share a natural rapport.  O'Connor and co-scripter Angela Shelton
do nothing revolutionary with the traditional mother-daughter story in a
plot sense, but when the film is as lovingly put together as this funny
and heartwarming one is, it is one to be savored.  (_Tumbleweeds_ opens
November 24)

Title
Review for Knock Off (1998)
Renowned Hong Kong action director Tsui Hark first teamed with Jean-Claude
Van Damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with Dennis Rodman,
_Double_Team_, and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster
into a slick, stylish, and somewhat diverting action timekiller.  Tsui
continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest
collaboration with the Muscles from Brussels, _Knock_Off_, but this time
around, style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous, and at
worst incomprehensible; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances.
Writer Steven E. DeSouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as
outre as _Double_Team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison,
but it makes about as much sense, which is little.  Van Damme plays Marcus
Ray, a Hong Kong-based sales rep for a jeans company (!) who stumbles upon
a Russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in HK
product exports to the U.S.--dolls, electronic equipment, and, yes, jeans.
It's all part of some type of ransom scheme, but all I remember is--and I
kid you not--graphics on a CIA computer screen showing a map of the world,
bombs detonating, and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world
bursting out into laughter...
...which is what the crowd at the showing I attended spontaneously did
throughout _Knock_Off_.  While all of Van Damme's films have its share of
unintentional laughs, mostly due to the stiff acting "skills" of the
physically agile Van Damme, _Knock_Off_ delivers more than usual (though
not as many as Van Damme's embarrassing directorial effort, 1996's
_The_Quest_).  A lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful
lines by DeSouza: "I smoked that badass like a Roman candle!" and
"Entrepreneurship, babycakes!" standing out among my favorites.  But it is
indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _Knock_Off_'s
laughs.  Van Damme is true to laughable form, perhaps even worse than
usual.  Early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with
co-star Rob Schneider (improbably cast as a deep cover CIA agent posing as
Marcus's business partner), and the sight and sound of the
still-heavily-accented Van Damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is
hilarious in the wrong way.  Even typically good actors are not immune to
the bad acting bug.  Paul Sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought
as Schneider's CIA superior; and Lela Rochon, playing an investigator for
the jeans company, spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode.  In
Rochon's defense, though, her role requires her to do little more than
display her toned legs, exquisite bone structure, and perky bosoms, the
latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs
stuck in her ample cleavage.
Tsui picks up where he left off visually in _Double_Team_, juicing up
the proceedings with inventive camera work.  Here, though, Tsui's visual
razzle dazzle borders on over kill, coming off as desperate attempts to
shield the inanity of the entire enterprise.  For each nifty trick Tsui
pulls off, such as a  recurring visual theme that has the camera literally
going through the circuitry of electronic devices, there are others that
are completely superfluous.  This is especially disconcerting when the
trick in question could be clever when used in the right context.  For
instance, one scene early on has Marcus putting his hand in a box.  As he
puts his hand in, the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in
a rectangle at the corner of the screen.  It's undoubtedly an interesting
visual, but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something.
The test of a Van Damme movie boils down to the action sequences, but
surprisingly, those in _Knock_Off_ leave much to be desired.  Tsui does
what he can to make something of them, employing freeze frames, blurred
motion, and unconventional camera angles, but there is nothing
fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences
written by DeSouza.  There isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the
climactic tiger/land mine fight in _Double_Team_, let alone anything
remotely close to Tsui's legendary Hong Kong works (but that's a given
going in).
If Tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman John Woo's stateside
success, he would do best to break free from Van Damme... before it's too
late.  If he continues his involvement with B-grade movies such as
_Knock_Off_, the respect he has from HK action fans will continue to
diminish... that is, if it hasn't already disappeared entirely after this
fiasco.

Review for Belly (1998)
The feature debut of hot hip-hop music video director Hype Williams serves
up what one would expect from that fact: music stars in the cast (rappers
DMX, Nas, and Method Man; singers Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins of TLC, and Taral
Hicks) and, most of all, highly stylized, video-ready visuals.  Williams
pulls out all the stops, employing everything from freeze frames and
frenetic editing to having different scenes and shots ghosted over others.
Williams's tricks are given an added sheen by the rich colors of Malik
Sayeed's stunning cinematography.
But all of Williams's glitz, delicious eye candy as it is, eventually
overshadows his own script.  It's a by-the-numbers story about the fall and
possible redemption of two longtime friends and drug dealers, Tommy (DMX,
showing genuine big screen presence and charisma) and Sincere (Nas), one a
badass (Tommy), one more mellow (the aptly named Sincere) and looking for a
stable life for his wife Tionne (Watkins) and their child.  As
straightforward as that sounds, all the visual style unnecessarily drains
the coherence from the story, which bounces from one image and place to
another with only a voiceover serving as the thin thread tying together the
pieces.  Williams is a name to watch; _Belly_ leaves no doubt as to his
remarkable talent as a visual stylist, and he coaxes convincing work from
his mostly novice cast.  But until his storytelling ability catches up,
he'll remain just that--a name to watch.

Title
Review for Office Space (1999)
_Beavis_and_Butt-Head_, _King_of_the_Hill_.  Two of the most successful
animated television series in recent years--and two of the most annoying
creations to ever hit the tube, if you ask me.  So I was surprised to find
myself laughing through much of the offbeat workplace comedy
_Office_Space_,  the live-action directorial debut of those series'
creator, Mike Judge.
When we first meet Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), he is stuck in the
circle of hell known as morning rush hour trafic.  But this is nothing
compared to the next circle that awaits Peter and his also-traffic-jammed
friends Samir (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman) every single
day as office dronces for the Initech Corporation.  As we see Peter being
harrassed by his numerous higher-ups about a memo regarding report cover
sheets and Michael doing battle with the temperamental office fax and
anyone who mentions a certain identically-named singer, Judge's point is
abundantly clear: work sucks, as goes the film's tagline.
Judge's recreation of soul-deadening busy work is so painfully dead-on
hilarious that it wouldn't really matter if there were much of a plot--and
there really isn't much of one.  Fed up with his unfulfilling,
underappreciated efforts and his smarmy, condescending boss Bill Lumbergh
(Gary Cole), Peter decides to rebel, and he and the about-to-be-laid-off
Samir and Michael join forces in an elaborate scheme to fleece the
corporation.  While their scheming does pave the way for some very
effective, very funny set pieces (one gangland-style "beating" is a
showstopper), it doesn't have much of a payoff.  In fact, perhaps
_Office_Space_'s weakest element is its rather flat conclusion, which
doesn't fulfill the buildup of what preceded it.
Nonetheless, Judge has come up with a wry, perceptive, always-amusing
comedy, highlighted by some memorable characters, chief among them the
gangsta-rap-loving Michael Bolton; the ever-unctuous Lumbergh; and Milton
(Stephen Root), a perpetually stepped-on (or, rather, completely ignored)
soft-spoken co-worker.  But it's Livingston who holds the film together.
Peter, while the main character, may not be the showiest role in the film,
but Livingston's low-key, self-effacing attitude works in creating a
likable character--and, in turn, an involving film.

Title
Review for Edge, The (1997)
The Edge (R) ** (out of ****)
        Following test screenings, the title of Lee Tamahori's
survival-in-the-wilds thriller Bookworm was changed to the presumably more
slam-bang The Edge.  However, this is a case where the original title
should have remained, for the staid-sounding Bookworm is a more apt moniker
for this unexciting adventure yarn.
        Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Charles Morse, the bookworm of the original
title, a billionaire who has acquired a wealth of knowledge from the
reading of numerous books.  The film begins with Charles arriving in Alaska
with his much younger model wife, Mickey (Elle Macpherson, displaying all
the depth of a fashion plate)--yes, her name is _Mickey_Morse_--and ace
fashion photographer Robert Green (Alec Baldwin) for a shoot.  Screenwriter
David Mamet's creaky plot machinations can be heard early on with the very
weak setup for the wilderness action: determined to locate a particularly
photogenic local to join Mickey for the shoot, Robert, with trusty
assistant Stephen (Harold Parrineau) and Charles along for the ride, leaves
the cushy cabin lodgings on a plane, which promptly crashes in the middle
of nowhere.  Can these three survive on their own in the Alaskan
wilderness, with a very hungry bear on their trail?
        Actually, the question is really if these _two_ can survive, since it's
thunderingly obvious that Stephen won't be around for long because (1) the
tension brewing between Charles and Robert over Mickey has to take center
stage sooner or later, and (2) Stephen is African-American.  And the
answer, of course, is a big yes since Charles has learned volumes of
survival know-how from books--we see him make a compass using a paper clip
and a leaf in water as well as recite a particularly clever formula for
making fire from ice.  Before long, we get the point: it takes brains, not
necessarily brawn, to survive in the wild.  But Mamet and Tamahori keep on
pounding that point into the audience's heads as if we were an opponent
needing to be pummeled into submission.
        Tamahori does bring The Edge to life during some spectacular bear attack
sequences.  This may sound a little silly, but Bart the Bear delivers the
film's most memorable performance as Charles and Robert's (and, for a
while, Stephen's) bloodthirsty stalker; big, brown, and very, very
intimidating, he gives his scenes an electrifying jolt of energy.
Unfortunately, the bear is not the focus of the film; the Charles-Robert
conflict is, and once the bear situation has come to a head, all that
follows cannot help but feel a bit a dull by comparison.  This would not
have been as big of a problem if the Charles-Robert conflict came to a
moderately satisfying, halfway exciting conclusion, but, not so
surprisingly, everything ends with a whimper.
        Which leaves the audience wondering--what exactly does the title mean?
The edge of sanity?  The edge of the world?  Perhaps one, perhaps the
other, perhaps both, but all I know is that by the time The Edge was over,
I was at the edge of my patience.

Title
Review for Skulls, The (2000)
_The_Skulls_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
I'll cut to the chase for the teenybopper admirers of _Dawson's_Creek_
heartthrob Joshua Jackson: he has a couple of partial shirtless shots and
a big scene where he runs around in a skintight spandex rowing outfit. 
But as loud as the girls' howls were for that latter scene, they did not
compare to the ever-increasing volume of the ones from the entire
audience as this atrocious thriller grew longer and more ridiculous. 
Jackson plays Luke, a student at an Ivy League university who is
recruited to join the exclusive "secret" on-campus society known as (what
else?) the Skulls.  (I place the word "secret" in quotes because everyone
is not only acutely aware of the society's existence, but also the
location of their headquarters.)  He joins and enjoys the perks of
membership until he learns of the despicable Skulls cover-up of an even
more despicable crime.  Luke wants out, but the organization, of course,
has other ideas.
One big problem with the film from the start: I never understood why
being a Skull was so special in the first place.  While there are obvious
monetary benefits, the other "special" activities--black tie parties,
free sex, vacation retreats--would be commonplace for other
non-underground groups.  That, however, is a minor complaint, for
_The_Skulls_ is one of those bad films that manages to get worse and
worse across the board as it progresses.  Barely credible performances
turn embarrassingly amateurish (token female Leslie Bibb is cute, but
that doesn't count for anything when the material gets more, ahem,
"serious"); the turns of the plot are not so much shocking as laughably
preposterous (the gratuitous Jackson/Bibb love scene comes at the most
unconvincing moment possible; and nothing can prepare you for the, for
lack of a better term, "Victorian" climax).  After seeing _The_Skulls_
and Rob Cohen's last two theatrical releases, _Daylight_ and
_Dragonheart_, I am forced to wonder if he actually did direct the
memorable _Dragon:_The_Bruce_Lee_Story_.

Title
Review for Hamlet (2000/I)
The big struggle for a filmmaker looking to adapt a classic (read: old)
literary work for the screen is to make it accessible to contemporary
audiences.  The trend these days appears to be translating the story into
modern times--or, more accurately, transplanting the story, leaving the
original language intact.  The intent of the shift is obviously to put a
fresh spin on a familiar tale, but in the case of Michael Almereyda's
revisionist take on William Shakespeare's oft-filmed _Hamlet_, the move
feels more a lazy gimmick than an inspired dash of creativity.
I was no fan of Baz Luhrmann's surprise 1996 hit
_William_Shakespeare's_Romeo_+_Juliet_, which pioneered this
Elizabethan-language-in-the-modern-world approach for the cinema.  But
that film, set in the mythical Florida town of "Verona Beach" in an
undisclosed year, had enough of a surreal gloss to make the anachronistic
speech go down a bit easier.  The action in this _Hamlet_ explicitly
takes place in "New York City, 2000," and as such, the language cannot
help but clang.
And when familiar soliloquies are delivered in locations such as, say, a
Blockbuster Video store--which is exactly where Hamlet (Ethan Hawke)
recites the famous "To be or not to be..."--the audience is overwhelmed
by the contemporary trappings.  The new setting distracts from, rather
than enhance, Shakespeare's story about a Danish prince out to avenge his
father's murder at the hands of Hamlet's uncle Claudius, who, in turn,
has married Hamlet's mother Gertrude.  This is largely because the
alterations made to the set-up never take hold.  Fresh-out-of-school
digital filmmaker (no joke) Hamlet is the son of the dead "king" (Sam
Shepard, who also played Hawke's deceased father in
_Snow_Falling_on_Cedars_) of the Denmark Corporation.  The shift to the
business world fails to add anything new; instead of using Shakespeare's
themes of treachery, deceit, and revenge to make an interesting statement
about cutthroat corporate tactics, the change is merely an incidental
one, with no clearcut connection to the text.  If anything, it just gives
Almereyda the chance to set scenes in sleek and shiny buildings (Gideon
Ponte's production design is indeed impressive--perhaps the only thing in
the film that is a complete success).
Slick surfaces aside, this _Hamlet_, in maintaining the Bard's original
language, covers all the familiar plot points and scenes.  Claudius'
(Kyle MacLachlan) advisor Polonius (Bill Murray!) still advises son
Laertes (Liev Schreiber), "To thine own self be true."  Polonius'
daughter Ophelia (Julia Stiles) is still Hamlet's true love, and he still
eventually orders her to "Get thee to a nunnery."  Of course, there are
added Y2K wrinkles: Hamlet tells off Ophelia on her answering machine;
Hamlet's soliloquies are largely confessionals given to his video camera
as part of a diary document of sorts.  These admittedly interesting
touches cannot make up for the lack of verve in the entire film.
The sluggish vibe is set by Hawke.  While some in the cast, MacLachlan
and Diane Venora (playing Gertrude) in particular, nimbly handle their
roles and the Bard's words, they are, of course, secondary to the prince
of Denmark himself, and Hawke proves incapable of handling the task.  Not
only does he have the same slacker look he sported in the Gen-X comedy
_Reality_Bites_, but the same laid-back, forceless attitude.  Hawke has
said that he wanted to be part of a _Hamlet_ that wasn't about the
central performance, but without some intensity from the lead, the
character and his story easily gets overshadowed by the gimmick of the
contemporary setting.
Maybe that was Almereyda's point all along, to show how modern
technology overwhelms contemporary lives.  If that's the case, then why
adapt Shakespeare's play if the intent is to obscure it?  Whatever his
reasoning, just the basic idea of  Almereyda's _Hamlet_ makes little
sense, and so does the finished film.

Title
Review for Toy Story 2 (1999)
When Disney announced the production of a direct-to-video sequel to
Pixar's smash 1995 computer-animated feature _Toy_Story_, my expectations
weren't exactly set soaring.  The subsequent announcement that the
project was going so well that the Mouse decided to give it a big-screen
release didn't instill any new faith.  After all, this was Disney, who
never passed up an opportunity to soil the memory of a beloved animated
feature with a truly atrocious, completely unnecessary sequel.  Ever see
_The_Lion_King_II:_Simba's_Pride_?  Or the even more blasphemous
_Beauty_and_the_Beast:_The_Enchanted_Christmas_?  Consider yourself
incredibly lucky if you haven't.
So it was that greater of a shock--and an extremely pleasurable one at
that--to discover that _Toy_Story_2_ not only equals, but bests the
classic original film.  I had thought that the first _Toy_Story_ had
completely exhausted all the ideas for its cast of toy characters.  After
all, by film's end, the film's clever conceit that astronaut action
figure Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) believed he was an actual
Space Ranger was resolved, and he and rival for owner Andy's affections,
pull-string cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) had mended fences.  Having done all
that with an Oscar-nominated blend of all-ages humor and grown-up
intelligence, where else could director John Lasseter go with the story?
As it turns out, many different--and more complex--places.  On one
level, _Toy_Story_2_ is a witty knock on the ever-growing toy collecting
market, where adults buy toys and never open them, keeping them for an
investment rather than their intended use as a child's plaything.  Woody
is stolen by a toy collector/toy store owner named Al (Wayne Knight) for
a hefty profit.  As it turns out, Woody is the main item in an old toy
line tied to a western-themed puppet television series called
_Woody's_Roundup_, and he reunites with the other members of his TV
family--cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack), horse Bullseye, and old prospector
Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammer)--in Al's office.
Screenwriters Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin, and Chris
Webb also have deeper interests in mind.  Al, of course, intends to sell
the now-complete _Woody's_Roundup_ collection, an idea that Woody balks
at--he just wants to go home to Andy and his friends--but Jessie
wholeheartedly embraces.  Jessie, it is revealed, once had an owner, but
the owner abandoned her once she grew up.  Determined to not be
heartbroken again, Jessie wants to be loved and paid attention to
forever, even if it's from passing admirers looking through a glass case.
 This surprising crisis-of-existence theme--what's a toy to do once its
owner inevitably abandons it?--sounds a bit heady for a film with largely
kid appeal, but it's a tribute to the terrific writing that it's made
easily understandable for the young 'uns as well as the adults.  The
stunning example is the beautiful scene where Jessie tells her story
through the heartbreaking Randy Newman-penned, Sarah McLachlan-sung
ballad "When She Loved Me" (a lock for a Best Original Song Oscar nod
next year).
Despite all the richness of theme and emotion in _Toy_Story_2_, Lasseter
and co-director Lee Unkrich never forget what the film mainly is: a comic
adventure.  And there is plenty of comedy and adventure as Woody's toy
friends, led by Buzz, attempt a daring rescue of Woody from Al's toy
store.  That means a number of hilarious encounters with other toys,
including a perky Barbie (Jodi Benson, best known as Ariel from
_The_Little_Mermaid_) and, in a very clever touch, a fresh-from-the-box
Buzz Lightyear--who indeed believes himself to be a Space Ranger.
Augmenting all the fun of _Toy_Story_2_ is the amazing computer
animation.  A lot of advances have been made in the field since the
original film's release in 1995, and the visuals in the new film are
absolutely stunning--not to mention increasingly realistic.  Al's
skintone and hairy arms are remarkably lifelike, and Andy's dog is just
thisshy of looking exactly like the real thing.  What impressed me the
most, however, were the textures: the paint on metal surfaces, the
imperfect consistency of the human's (namely Al's) skin, the gravelly
road surface.  The detail is even more jawdropping when the film is seen
at one of the handful of theatres showing the film in crystalline DLP
all-digital projection.
It goes without saying that things work out for the best by the end of
_Toy_Story_2_, but this is one happy ending not without a tinge of the
bittersweet; Andy will eventually grow up, and all of his toys will find
themselves without a place to go.  But if there is a central moral to
_Toy_Story_2_, it's the old reliable "seize the day," and movie audiences
would best take that to heart and seize the opportunity to see one of the
brightest cinematic accomplishments to hit the silver screen this year.

Title
Review for Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997)
Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (R) *** (out of ****)
Take arguably the funniest dumb blonde on TV (Lisa Kudrow), pair her
with the most memorable dumb blonde in recent film (Mira Sorvino), and you
get the irreverent, loopy, and entertaining new comedy Romy and Michele's
High School Reunion.
As can be expected, Sorvino, who won an Oscar for her Mighty
Aphrodite numskull hooker routine, and Kudrow, Emmy nominee for her work as
dullard songstress Phoebe on NBC's hit Friends, perfectly embody Romy White
and Michele Weinberger, respectively, a couple of aimless L.A. clubhopping
losers attend to their ten-year high school reunion in Tucson, Arizona.
These two can play this type of role in their sleep, but there's no question
that they play the part well.  How well?  Having two incredibly idiotic
people as the leads in a film has the potential to grow old really fast, but
Sorvino and Kudrow keep their characters consistently interesting and
likable throughout the film, never losing the audience's rooting interest;
they're just a lot of fun to hang around with.  The two have a natural
rapport, and their best moments come early in the film, as the
intelligence-impaired pair attempt to shape up their lives in time to brag
to their old enemies at the reunion.  Of course, their plan for
self-improvement doesn't work, and they instead decide to just pretend to be
successful, something much easier said than done.  Then again, for these
two, everything is much easier said than done.
Sorvino and Kudrow are on pitch-perfect target during the heart of
the film, the reunion itself, but the second half of Romy and Michele
belongs to neither Romy nor Michele.  It is clearly owned by Janeane
Garofalo, simply terrific as acid-tongued Heather Mooney, who was even more
of a social outcast in high school than Romy and Michele.  She has all the
best lines in Robin Schiff's amusing script, and her dry, nasty,
movie-stealing performance keeps the proceedings from becoming overly
saccharine and sweet--which, at times, it threatens to do, especially when
the high school snobs (led by a hissably bitchy Julia Campbell) get their
expected comeuppance.
First-time helmer David Mirkin, an executive producer on The
Simpsons, displays some of that series' witty, irreverent sense of humor in
this film, especially in a wildly unexpected plot curve midway through.  He
brings some refreshing visual flair to the obligatory high school flashback
scenes, which are presented as yearbook pictures come to life.  The '80s
soundtrack is also quite effectively used, not simply as nostalgia but also
as background score; for instance, Romy is belittled by people from the "A
crowd" as Bananarama's "Cruel Summer" plays in the background, and Belinda
Carlisle's "Heaven Is a Place on Earth" provides a perfect bubblegum
backdrop for our heroines' ultimate triumph.  Also, I don't think I'll ever
hear Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time" in quite the same way after seeing
the--for lack of a better term--"unique" dance number it underscores.
Romy and Michele's High School Reunion gets the job done as popcorn
entertainment, but in the end I can't say that a whole lot really goes on in
its 90something minutes--ditzy Romy and Michele go to their reunion and get
their revenge--and the film is just about instantly forgettable.  But what
isn't forgettable are the characters: the main duo and, most of all, the
hilariously prickly Heather.  Sorvino and Kudrow have expressed a desire to
do a whole Romy and Michele series, but here's hoping they can get Garofalo
to join in on a series of Romy, Michele, and Heather flicks.

Title
Review for Slam (1998)
Marc Levin's _Slam_ is a powder keg of a movie, exploding with emotional
honesty and truth and the exuberant passion of raw young talent.  It is an
uplifting and exhilarating experience, a powerful work that deservedly won
the Grand Jury Prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
Newcomer Saul Williams plays Ray Joshua, a talented Washington, D.C.
rapper/poet whose dealings in the drug biz land him in jail.  There, given
the choice of falling into the trap of violence or hone his gift, Ray
chooses the latter, and with the help and love of prison writing teacher
Lauren Bell (Sonja Sohn), he discovers the transcendent power of his words.
The "finding oneself through art" premise isn't entirely original, but
what makes _Slam_ such a triumph is the freshness of its voice.  The first
scene where Ray "slams," with the help of an inmate (Momulu Stewart) in the
next cell, is dazzling in its sheer energy and percussive force.  "Force"
can also be used to describe Williams and Sohn, who are not only talented
poets but charismatic screen presences and extraordinary actors.  The two
are downright electrifying; one highly charged confrontation in which she
tries to convince him to own up to his past mistakes packs an overwhelming
emotional potency.  The same can be said of the entire film, which Williams
has called--and rightfully so--"more of a movement than a movie."  (opens

Title
Review for Stepmom (1998)
The breezy trailers for _Stepmom_ would lead one to believe that it is one
of those light films one would expect from director Chris Columbus.  The
reality of the film, so cleverly hidden in the rushes, is much more sober
and serious.  Some would go so far as to call it sad.  But it doesn't go
quite _that_ far, in my opinion.  _Stepmom_ is a well-made and undeniably
involving film, but its artistic compromises are not completely effective.
The character being referred to by the title actually is not a stepmother,
at least not yet.  She's Isabel Kelly (Julia Roberts) the much younger
live-in girlfriend of Luke Harrison (Ed Harris).  Luke's two children,
7-year-old Ben (Liam Aiken) and especially 12-year-old Anna (Jena Malone)
are resentful of Isabel, and somewhat rightfully so--they have been blessed
(spoiled?) with a perfect mother, Luke's ex-wife Jackie (Susan Sarandon).
Although busy professional photographer Isabel scarcely has the time or
interest for parenting, the kids are occasionally left in her questionable
care, creating even more points of conflict between the two women.
About the first hour of _Stepmom_ has a nice hard edge, albeit somewhat
overwritten by the five credited scripters, Gigi Levangie, Jessie Nelson,
Steven Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins, and Ron Bass.  (I'm not so sure a girl
Anna's can come up with such pithy zingers so quickly; it's one thing to be
a smartass, and quite another to be a smart ass.)  Even during the
seemingly happier moments, there's a palpable undercurrent of tension,
especially between Isabel and Jackie.  Their conflicts over parenting
philosophies and authority is something not often seen in film, and it's
solidly played by Roberts and Sarandon.
Columbus is not known for displaying a hard edge, if even one at all, and
so the air of anger cannot last--or, at the very least, must tone down
somewhat.  And that it does, in a less than convincing fashion.  The most
contrived development has Anna, who has heretofore been Isabel's most vocal
detractor, make a complete 180 after Isabel shows her a nifty painting
technique; before long, the two are best friends singing along to "Ain't No
Mountain High Enough" in the car.  But the big complication--and the film's
big secret--is also a big misstep.  Jackie, it is revealed, has secretly
been receiving treatment for cancer, and her condition is steadily
worsening toward the inevitable.
Now, I have no problem with films featuring people suffering from a
terminal disease.  But throughout _Stepmom_ I wondered if the illness
wrinkle was really necessary.  The Jackie/Isabel conflict was already
involving, with each side showing its share of right and wrong; making
Jackie sick unfairly stacks the sympathy deck in her favor.  But I suppose
the illness was a necessary compromising device for Columbus, enabling him
to try something more edgy at first and then settle into familiar, safe,
and blatantly calculated schmaltz, which hits full-throttle with the de
rigueur mawkish mother-child "goodbye" scenes.  And though this is an
adult-aimed film, Columbus also couldn't completely shake his _Home_Alone_
kiddie tendencies by casting Aiken, a Macaulay-esque moppet who is as short
on talent as he is long on cuteness.
Before her comeback with _My_Best_Friend's_Wedding_, Roberts was in a bit
of a career bind.  She wanted to prove her serious acting chops, but
audiences wanted to see her megawatt smile and hear her whooping laugh, and
drab, smile-less efforts such as _Mary_Reilly_ flopped.  Here, Roberts
attempts to have the best of both worlds, flashing those pearly whites ever
so often within a meaty dramatic context.  Unlike Columbus's compromise,
hers works, and she delivers one of her most impassioned performances,
holding her own against the formidable Sarandon, who is true to strong
form.  Stealing some of their thunder is the impressive Malone, who plays
such a convincing brat in the earlygoing you may find yourself wanting to
slap her.
While I was not among the people who cried at various points during
_Stepmom_, it did strike some emotional chords.  But the film's
effectiveness had less to do with the story than it did the strong work of
the actors--an all too appropriate compromise in a film characterized by
them.  (opens December 25)

Title
Review for Chill Factor (1999)
Note to struggling actors everywhere: if you think winning an Academy
Award will make your career spring to life, look at the career of Cuba
Gooding Jr.  While he has appeared in small roles in two decent films
(_As_Good_As_It_Gets_, _What_Dreams_May_Come_) in the scant two years
since he won his Supporting Actor Oscar for _Jerry_Maguire_, the lead
roles he has landed have been less than satisfactory: in the overwrought
melodrama _Instinct_ and now in the routine buddy actioner
_Chill_Factor_.
Even more depressing about Gooding's involvement in _Chill_Factor_ is
that he's relegated to token wisecracking African-American sidekick to
ever-so-vanilla Skeet Ulrich, who has the true starring role here.  Or
perhaps that is a good thing since this tepid action comedy is not
exactly one would be proud to headline (though Gooding is top billed). 
Ulrich's Tim Mason is the central character, a young diner worker in a
small Montana town who comes into the possession of "Elvis," an explosive
chemical substance.  As instructed by a scientist friend, Tim must
deliver the chemical to a military station in a town 90 miles away before
some baddies can use it for their nefarious purposes.  The catch?  The
chemical must remain frozen, for at 50 degrees, it combusts.  Enter Arlo
(Gooding), ice cream delivery man, who is dragged into the dirty affair
when Tim decides to use his refrigerated truck for transport.
Thus begins one long chase, where our mismatched duo bickers and bonds
while pursued by evil military types (led by Peter Firth and _Xena_ and
former _Melrose_Place_ vixen Hudson Leick) in cars and on motorcycles. 
It's all fairly routine, but director Hugh Johnson is able to come up
with a couple of diverting action sequences, namely one where Arlo and
Tim must steer the truck on a narrow, blown-out mountain roadway; and
another where the two ride a boat down a steep hill.
What neither Johnson nor Gooding and Ulrich can redeem is the limp
banter given them by writers Drew Gitlin and Mike Cheda.  Most of the
laugh lines are given to Gooding, and, to his credit, he obviously
attempts to infuse as much punch into them as is humanly possible. 
Unfortunately, this results in a way over-the-top performance that can
best be described as a feature-length riff on his famously energized
Oscar acceptance speech.  But at least he displays some signs of life,
which cannot be said for Ulrich; as in the awful _Touch_, the last film
he was called on to carry, Ulrich makes for a flavorless, uninteresting
presence that is much too weak on which to hang an entire picture.
_Chill_Factor_ is a competently made studio assembly-line product, and
that ultimately is the problem.  Without anything remotely extraordinary
to its credit, it is taken in by the eyes with relative ease, but leaves
nothing of substance to penetrate any deeper.

Title
Review for Hilary and Jackie (1998)
_Hilary_and_Jackie_ (R) **** (out of ****)
Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) and Jacqueline (Emily Watson) du Pre are a
sisterly pair of child musical prodigies: Hilary on the flute and
Jacqueline on the cello.  As an adult, Hilary gives up music to live a
normal life; Jackie, on the other hand, embarks on a wildly successful
career as a concert cellist, winning over worldwide audiences with her
flamboyant brand of skill and showmanship.  The divergent trajectories of
their lives (and not in the way one would expect) and the resulting
emotional and physical fallout threatens the sisters' strong bond.
According to the press notes, the fact-based _Hilary_and_Jackie_ was
"written and produced as a tribute to Jackie," and, as such, the focus
lies squarely on Jackie--and how could it not, with the extraordinary
Watson in the role.  For me, she is the woman to beat for best actress of
the year delivering a stunning performance that captures the entire
spectrum of her personality: from sweetness to bitterness, from madness
to illness.
But the film is not called _Hilary_and_Jackie_ for nothing, and not just
because Griffiths does some terrific--and sure to be underrated--work as
the more stable sister.  In an ingenious storytelling tactic, director
Anand Tucker and screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce split the story in
three sections, giving clear definition to both sisters.  "Hilary and
Jackie" details their youth together up until a crucial point where they
are separated.  "Hilary" focuses on Hilary's quiet life and her
ever-shifting feelings about Jackie, who periodically reappears. 
Finally, there's "Jackie," which picks up at the first section's cutoff
point and assumes Jackie's perspective.  As we see her turbulent life
unfold, her character is given greater dimension, providing vivid reasons
for some of Jackie's more erratic behavior in the "Hilary" section (some
events from which are retold from Jackie's perspective here).  The result
is an uncommonly well-rounded portrait of a tormented genius, and a
supremely affecting story of real people, only slightly marred by a bit
of arbitrary surrealism at the end (which, coincidentally, also
marred--moreso--Watson's breakthrough film, 1996's _Breaking_the_Waves_).


Title
Review for I'll Be Home for Christmas (1998)
_The_Rugrats_Movie_ (G) ***
_I'll_Be_Home_for_Christmas_ (PG) * 1/2
November not only marks the unofficial start of the holiday season, it
also signals the arrival of the first of a flock of films fashioned for
families.  Leading the opening wave are two films coming from
less-than-distinguished cinematic pedigrees: a non-Disney animated feature,
_The_Rugrats_Movie_; and a live-action comedy from the Mouse,
_I'll_Be_Home_for_Christmas_.  While Paramount is able to buck the
generally lackluster non-Walt animation trend with the fun _Rugrats_, the
Mouse strikes out once again in the flesh-and-blood arena with a most
uninviting _Home_.
My experience with Nickelodeon's smash cartoon series _Rugrats_ has been
confined to just an episode or two caught during breaks from channel
surfing.  But as limited as my familiarity with the show is, I have seen
enough of it to know that it's not something strictly for the tykes,
despite of its title's implication.  While clearly targeted at the
preschool demographic, the adventures of diaper-clad Tommy Pickles (voice
of E.G. Daily) and his friends Chuckie Finster (Christine Cavanaugh) and
twin siblings Phillip and Lillian Deville (both voiced by Kath Soucie) show
mature flashes of wit, and that smartness extends to the film.  Only adults
will appreciate such wry touches as a hospital sign tracking the arrivals
of newborns like flights at an airport, references to _The_Fugitive_ and
_A_Cry_in_the_Dark_, and the children's numerous instances of malapropism
(e.g. "custardy" for "custody").
The majority of the film, on the other hand, is equally accessible and
amusing to grown-ups and wee ones alike.  As can be expected, there is only
a sliver of a story in David N. Weiss and J. David Stem's script.  At
center of the plot is the arrival of a new child in the Pickles household,
Dylan a.k.a. "Dil" (Tara Charendoff), who, much to Tommy's chagrin,
immediately dominates all the attention of their parents Didi (Melanie
Chartoff) and Stu (Jack Riley).  But Tommy must learn to live with and love
Dil when they, Chuckie, Phillip, and Lillian find themselves lost in the
forest, thanks to a runaway toy wagon.  Not too far behind is Tommy's
bratty cousin Angelica (Cheryl Chase), determined to reclaim her beloved
Cynthia doll, which Dil has taken with him.
The adventures that ensue in the forest setting, ranging from some wild
river rafting to an encounter with circus monkeys, are sure to keep the
children enthralled (the kids at the screening I attended were noticeably
silent) and amuse the adults.  Part of the appeal for the older set is the
distinctive art style, which is rough and simple yet remarkably expressive.
 Wisely, directors Norton Virgien and Igor Kovalyov resist the urge to
punch up the visuals with gratuitous computer animation--at least, for the
most part: a boulder, clouds, and Dil's head-trippy arrival into the world
are the instances of CGI, and they are brief and effective.  The directors'
big misstep, though, was bowing to Disney animation tradition and grafting
on a few musical numbers to the film, which feel like they're, well,
grafted on, with the exception of one inspired number where Angelica breaks
out into a modified version of Blondie's "One Way or Another," sung in
reference to her missing Cynthia.  Production numbers aside,
_The_Rugrats_Movie_ is essentially just a big-screen episode of the series,
and that's more than enough to satisfy any audience.
While Disney has a rich tradition in animated family entertainment, but
its track record in live-action film is, to put it mildly, less than
stellar.  The wan _I'll_Be_Home_for_Christmas_ will do nothing to change
that.  This piece of warmed-over sitcom-level schmaltz casts _Tiger_Beat_
pinup du jour Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a cocky prep school student who
goes on a cross-country road trip to make it home in time for Christmas.
Sounds harmless enough, but then there's the gimmick: JTT is stuck in a
Santa Claus outfit, and along the way he learns the true meaning of
Christmas.  As lame and predictable as the story is, the key problem is
Taylor Thomas himself.  His character is supposed to undergo a gradual
attitude change as the film progresses, but he plays the character as such
a smug bastard the whole way through that one senses no change, nor does
one care if he changes.  Less than halfway through _I'll_Be_Home..._, I
wanted to go home myself.

Title
Review for Crazy/Beautiful (2001)
        From the first moment we see her raggedly shorn locks, punky
wardrobe, and sense the carefree, brazenly sexual attitude behind it all,
in _crazy/beautiful_ it's clear that Kirsten Dunst is no longer the
little girl who first captured attention with her Golden Globe-nominated
turn in 1994's _Interview_with_the_Vampire_.  However, the most striking
instance of growing up on display in John Stockwell's film is that of the
contemporary teen film.
        Whereas most youth-aimed films are really about pushing a
soundtrack and a "hot" young star's image as they tell another tired tale
revolving around who gets to go to the big dance with whom, Stockwell
actually attempts to tell a character-driven story in _crazy/beautiful_. 
Granted, this story isn't exactly anything new.  Phil Hay and Matt
Manfredi's script centers around that old standby, a romance between two
opposites.  On one end is Carlos Nuńez (Jay Hernandez), a bright student
from a rough L.A. neighborhood who takes a two-hour bus trip in each
direction every day to attend the posh Pacific High.  On the other is
Nicole Oakley (Dunst), who lives in a large Pacific Palisades home with
her Congressman father (Bruce Davison) and his cold new wife (Lucinda
Jenney).  The twist here is that the privileged white girl is the one
with delinquent tendencies and substance abuse problems, and the ethnic
guy from what would typically be "the wrong side of the tracks" is the
ambitious and responsible type.
        Naturally, a deep emotional trauma is at the root of Nicole's
frequent misbehavior, and through her developing relationship with Carlos
(whom she meets cute on the beach as she does community service for a DUI
charge) she is forced to face her personal demons.  Along the way, Carlos
himself also grows and develops into a more mature and independent
person.  All of this could easily be the fodder for an afterschool
special, but Stockwell makes the material big screen-worthy by
underplaying the melodrama.  Unlike most teen films, the pitch is a lot
more subdued and subtle, lending the picture a greater sense of reality.
        But it's hard to imagine Stockwell being able to create that air
of authenticity without his stars.  While her looks have changed with
age, Dunst's acting ability hasn't.  She once again demonstrates her
versatility and depth with her nuanced portrayal of Nicole.  Yes, the
character is yet another one of those bad girls with a heart of gold, but
where most actresses (let alone ones in her age range) can only nail one
side or the other, Dunst is not only believable when either vixenish or
vulnerable, she convinces that these are sides of the same person. 
Charismatic newcomer Hernandez is a find, managing to exude Carlos'
goodness without being a bore.  The pair's likability as individuals and
their honest and unadorned chemistry while together effortlessly generate
a rooting interest in their coupledom.
        Given the formulaic through-line of its story right down to the
neatly cathartic resolution, _crazy/beautiful_ could certainly have used
more of the first half of its title.  But in a climate where
teen-targeted entertainment is mostly concerned with attitude, the fact
that this simple story manages to generate a number of moments falling
under the latter quality alone makes the film worthwhile.

Title
Review for Rushmore (1998)
Of all the surprises to be had in the 93 wild minutes of _Rushmore_, the
biggest comes right at the beginning: the appearance of the Touchstone
Pictures logo.  It's amazing that a Disney subsidiary would produce a film
so decidedly off-center.  It's also amazing that a major Hollywood studio
could produce something so refreshingly original that it almost defies
description.
The quirkiness of _Rushmore_ should come as no shock to anyone who has
seen director/co-writer (with Owen Wilson) Wes Anderson's first film,
1996's quirky and enjoyable trifle _Bottle_Rocket_ (which he also
co-scripted with Wilson).  Like that film, _Rushmore_ has a loose narrative
structure that feels like it finds its way as it goes along.  The film
traces five months in the life of one Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), an
eccentric 15-year-old attending posh Rushmore Academy courtesy an academic
scholarship.  However, ever since coming to Rushmore, academics have taken
a backseat to extracurricular activities, and one hilarious montage gives
the rundown of his numerous club affiliations, from the presidency of the
fencing club to beekeeping club.  Closest to his heart, though, is "the Max
Fischer Players"--a theatrical troupe that regularly performs his own
original plays.  (In another memorable scene, the players put on a
production of _Serpico_.)
If there is a central plot thread to _Rushmore_, it is Max's hopeless love
for Rushmore first grade teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), which
leads him to pull off elaborate schemes to win her favor, but instead he
ends up getting expelled from his beloved school.  While this story, which
is complicated by Max's friend/romantic rival Herman Blume (Bill Murray),
is involving and achieves unexpected moments of poignancy, it is almost
moot--individual moments like the ones touched upon earlier are what matter
here: Max giving a speech to his couldn't-care-less classmates at the
public school; Max and Miss Cross talking for the first time on the
bleachers; Mr. Blume drunkenly taking a dip in his pool during his twin
sons' birthday party.
Of course, the key to the film's memorable moments are the engaging
characters.  Mr. Blume could have been either a stock villain or a pathetic
loser, but Anderson and Wilson give him a nicely human balance, which is
brought to multidimensional life by Murray, who delivers a performance at
turns funny, sad, and strangely likable.  Williams, freed from the junkpile
that was _The_Postman_ displays immense charm and, crucially, strength as
Miss Cross, who still has a torch burning for her dead husband; it's easy
to see why Mr. Blume and Max would fight over her.  But the film's most
fascinating character is Max, flawlessly played by newcomer Schwartzman.
Max may be a loser, but Schwartzman exudes the right mix of intelligence,
youthful naivete, self-deprecating humor, and everyguy likability that
prevents the character from ever coming off as pathetic.  He's the
perfectly unconventional lead for such an unconventional film.
As good as Schwartzman is, the clear star of _Rushmore_ is Anderson, a
young filmmaker with a uniquely warped vision--one that, not so
surprisingly, plays well with film festival audiences, which embraced this
film.  I doubt general audiences will be so receptive to something so far
off the mainstream radar, and it's more than likely that this film's
one-week Oscar-qualifying run will not result in any nods from the
staunchly conservative Academy.  But _Rushmore_ is certain to find its just
rewards in passionate, if somewhat limited, fan base that can appreciate
its singular brand of bizarre brilliance.

Title
Review for Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)
The Lost World: Jurassic Park (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
On paper, Steven Spielberg's The Lost World: Jurassic Park has the
makings of a vast improvement over the entertaining but wildly overrated
original film: the most remotely interesting human in the original cast,
Jeff Goldblum, is the only major returnee; the blah Laura Dern and Sam Neill
are supplanted by the vastly more interesting Julianne Moore and Vince
Vaughn;  a wider menagerie of dinosaurs is featured; there are enhanced
dinosaur effects; and all of the necessary exposition is already covered in
the first film.  Yet despite all of the basic improvements going into the
production, the perfectly entertaining finished product still somehow
manages to fall short of the original film.
This time around, Dr. Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) very reluctantly joins
girlfriend and paleontologist Sarah Harding (Moore), environmentalist
videographer Nick Van Owen (Vaughn) on an expedition to Site B, a second
dinosaur-populated island, where the creatures were bred for the ill-fated
Jurassic Park.  Add a child stowaway for the trip--in this case, Malcolm's
daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester)--and you have your perfunctory framework for
prehistoric mayhem, thrills, and chills.
The promise appears to be fulfilled in the first major dinosaur
suspense sequence, involving two very angry T-rexes and our heroes trapped
in a double trailer dangling off of a cliff.  This scene, which features a
tense moment with Sarah on top of a slowly cracking horizontal window pane
and some choice dino feeding action, comes quite early in the film, and it
sets the stage up for greater thrills.  But they don't come.  The problem?
Miscalculations and missed opportunities.  Other than this early scene and a
T-rex attack on a camp (complete with the return of the image of quivering
water), the major set pieces don't quite go for the kill.  Especially
dismaying is the showcase raptor sequence.  With the raptors chasing our
heroes in, on, and around an abandoned, run-down building, it is an
effective, suspenseful scene... until the end comes.  Jurassic Park had its
share of corny moments (the bonding-with-kids-while-feeding-the-brontosaurus
scene comes to mind), but it never crossed the line to outright camp and
cheese, which is what Spielberg and scripter David Koepp let The Lost World
do in its resolution of the raptor scene.  I won't give it away, but it left
me and the audience with which I saw the film completely aghast at its
idiotic awfulness.  Certainly, a film about dinosaurs in the present day
requires a suspension of disbelief, but to even the most openminded viewer,
the end of the raptor scene will ring completely false.  The film's third
act centers on an unexpected twist involving the T-rex, but the
possibilities this surprise idea brings aren't satisfactorily realized.  The
T-rex is roars a lot, breaks stuff--but, shockingly enough, he doesn't
really help himself to the veritable buffet of people running from him.
What's the fun of a T-rex who's not hungry?
On a similar note, the promise of the casting does not pay off,
mostly due to Koepp's lazy screenplay.  Once again, Goldblum is the only
remotely interesting human, getting all of the best lines.  Moore does not
fall into the same trap that befell the original's overwrought Dern, who
attacked her role as if she wanted an Oscar nomination.  However, once the
deadlier dinosaurs arrive, her brilliant scientist is reduced to being a
token screamer, and there's precious little left for the talented Moore to
work with.  Vaughn is a very lively actor (see Swingers), but you would not
get that impression from his "role" here, which is a mere one-dimensional
placeholder.  Pete Postlethwaite's character, a determined hunter after a
T-rex, is potentially interesting, but he goes nowhere.  Chester, despite
having a key part in the horrendous raptor resolution, is a big step up from
the first film's kids, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards (who both,
unfortunately, resurface in a cameo, albeit mercifully brief), but anyone
would have been an improvement over that annoying duo.
After all my griping, my giving The Lost World: Jurassic Park a
passing grade may seem a bit hypocritical, but up to this point I have been
focusing on what the film isn't rather than what it is: an enjoyable
adventure that never bores, even with a two-hour, fourteen-minute running
time.   It delivers exactly what one would expect from a dinosaur movie--a
wide array of very convincing animatronic and computer-generated prehistoric
reptiles (even more impressive than in the original) destroying things and
people in more than a few reasonably thrilling set pieces.   And as such, it
fits the bill of summer popcorn entertainment.

Title
Review for Horse Whisperer, The (1998)
I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a sucker for a good romantic weepie.
Pop 1996's The Bridges of Madison County into the VCR, and by the time a
rainsoaked Clint Eastwood casts a final heartbroken gaze at Meryl Streep,
in all likelihood you'll find me a blubbering mess (go ahead and laugh).
Not surprisingly, the long-delayed The Horse Whisperer is being positioned
as this year's Bridges: it also boasts a high-profile director-star (here,
Robert Redford), and it, too, is based on a bestselling love story by a
first-time author (Nicholas Evans in this case).  But only true suckers
will fall for this overlong, slow, and self-indulgent bore, which is not
only short on tears, but romance as well.
Never mind that it takes a hard-to-swallow plot contrivance to get the
ball rolling.  A violent horseriding accident severely injures 14-year-old
Grace McLean (Scarlett Johansson, in a role originally intended for Natalie
Portman) and kills her best friend Judith (Catherine Bosworth).  Also
shaken up in the accident is Grace's beloved horse Pilgrim.  Although
everyone says the best treatment for Pilgrim is a bullet, Grace's ballsy
magazine editor mother Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas) throws all caution and
good advice to the wind and takes Grace, who now wears a prosthesis where
her amputated right leg used to be, and Pilgrim on a road trip to Montana
to meet one Tom Booker (Redford).  Tom is a "horse whisperer," who
specializes in treating "horses with people problems"--a category under
which the once-gentle, now-irritable Pilgrim clearly falls.
It takes well over an hour before the inevitable "romance" between uptight
Annie and laidback Tom begins.  I place the term in quotes because what
develops only qualifies under the vaguest, most academic definition.  Tom
and Annie go horseback riding once, and suddenly they long for each
other--or rather, Annie longs for Tom, because Redford's stiff performance
offers no convincing insight into what Tom feels.  Redford had once vowed
to never direct himself in a film; based on his wooden work here, he should
have held to that promise.  Scott Thomas is a proven master at conveying
soul-aching longing (witness The English Patient) but she is at the mercy
of Redford (the actor and director) and scripters Eric Roth and Richard
LaGravanese (the latter of whom penned the terrific Bridges script).  I
couldn't feel for Annie since I couldn't understand why she would prefer
Tom over her straight-arrow but generally understanding husband Robert (Sam
Neill); her motivation is also sketchily developed, and as such the
forbidden "love" feels like a scripted development and not a natural one.
Not that Redford seems terribly concerned with the romance, which is
supposed to drive this story and serve as the emotional hook.  Redford
appears more content with crafting a valentine to the equine--and to his
own virility.  The Horse Whisperer is dominated by two images: horses
running wild and free and Tom, twirling his lasso in slow motion.  By the
time Tom is exerting his cool yet caring authority over other ranch animals
(in slow motion, of course), the point is abundantly clear--Tom is one
strapping cowpoke.  But Redford insists on drilling this point into the
audience's heads over and over and over again, at the clear expense of the
romance.  I'd say that three-fourths of the film's bloated
two-hour-and-forty-four minute running time is devoted to Tom and the
horses, with a fourth of that remaining fourth devoted to the supposed
"passion" between Tom and Annie:  They indulge in a couple of stolen kisses
(during a most incomprehensible doozy of an exchange--Annie: "I want to
know something."  Kiss.  Tom: "Are you sure?"  Kiss.  Annie: "I have to
go."  What the--?!); they share a romantic barroom dance; she cries--that's
it.  Oh, lest I forget Tom's oh-so-heartwrenching declaration of love,
delivered by Redford with all the expressiveness of a brick: "I didn't plan
on loving you.  But I do."  Really?  Could have fooled me...
The Horse Whisperer is not without its virtues.  Robert Richardson's
photography captures the Montana landscapes in all their breathtaking
majesty; Thomas Newman's score is lilting and evocative; Johansson is
terrific, creating the sole character that makes any connection with the
audience; and the opening accident scene has a disturbing intensity.  But
the scant good lies at the periphery of a deep, gaping void.  The
handsomely produced Horse Whisperer is not the flat-out cinematic
catastrophe that another recent actor-director effort, Kevin Costner's
notorious The Postman, was, but for swoony fans of movie love stories, this
uninteresting, uninvolving viewing chore might as well be.  There won't be
a damp eye in the house.

Title
Review for Legend of Bagger Vance, The (2000)
_The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
        Just who is Bagger Vance, and why is he so legendary?  Or, more
importantly, why should anyone care?  _The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance_,
Robert Redford's film of Steven Pressfield's novel of the same name,
offers plenty of pretty sunsets and New Agey gobbledygook but very little
reason why one should have an emotional investment in this benign, banal,
and sometimes boring inspirational drama.
        The main character is not Will Smith's titular golf caddy, but
one Rannoulph Junuh (Matt Damon), who at one point was considered the
greatest golfer in all the South, but tragedy on the battlefield in WWI
robbed him of all his nerve, not to mention the golf swing that earned
him the respect and admiration of many fans.  When Junuh's estranged
girlfriend Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) stages a big exhibition
tournament to save the lavish golf course built by her late father, young
Junuh fan named Hardy Greaves (newcomer J. Michael Moncrief) sees this as
a chance for Junuh to reclaim his status after ten years of bitter
seclusion.  After some heavy duty campaigning by Hardy and Adele, Junuh
reluctantly agrees though his swing seems long a thing of the past. 
Enter Bagger Vance, who seemingly appears out of thin air one night in
Junuh's yard; a couple of golf pointers later, Bagger is Junuh's caddy.
        From this point, Redford and screenwriter Jeremy Leven could have
completely settled into sports movie formula, and their unwillingness to
fall into convention would be more admirable if their alternative were
more inspired.  Granted, one key variation from the formula--that Junuh's
two highly celebrated opponents (Joel Gretsch and Bruce McGill) are good
people and not forced to fit into a "villain" mold--is refreshing.  But
the movie that Redford and Leven made really isn't about the tournament
so much as Junuh remembering his golf swing and all the psychological
healing that entails.  The problem is Junuh's trauma--his guilt over
being the sole survivor of his army platoon--is too simply handled, and
his road to recovery is less than convincing.  Bagger's long-winded
spiritual platitudes about golf are what set Junuh back on the right
path, and while the lyrical fairy tale gloss Redford gives the picture
keeps this point from being laughable, it simply reduces it to lesser
offense of being cornball.
        So where did Bagger get his bottomless pools of wisdom?  Who
knows; he could be a guardian angel, a mystical spirit, or just an
exceptionally perceptive and insightful man.  But the vagueness of his
character isn't as irksome as that of his more down-to-earth
counterparts.  Junuh: good guy, lost his confidence, needs it back. 
Adele: good gal, wants to preserve her dearly departed daddy's integrity.
 Hardy: good boy, wants his hero to succeed.  All the performances are
similarly nondescript, which is especially unfortunate in the case of
Smith.  Reduced to smiley-faced pontificating, the unpredictable energy
that usually makes him a captivating screen presence is as lost as
Junuh's swing.
        There is no denying that _The_Legend_of_Bagger_Vance_ is a
handsomely mounted production.  The film is exceedingly well done on the
technical end, highlighted by the cinematography of Michael Ballhaus, who
lushly captures the natural splendors of Savannah; and Rachel Portman's
subtle and evocative score.  If only the entire film were able to have as
firm a hold on the emotions as it does the senses.

Title
Review for Prince of Egypt, The (1998)
_The_Prince_of_Egypt_ (PG) **** (out of ****)
"It's unlike anything you've seen before"--words that have been intoned
many times by many a studio chief trying to wrap a veneer of freshness
around another stale assembly-line product.  But coming from Jeffrey
Katzenberg, the "K" in DreamWorks SKG, in reference to the company's first
traditional animated feature, _The_Prince_of_Egypt_, the statement is,
well, gospel.  _Prince_ is unlike any animated feature ever made, a musical
drama that just _happens_ to be completely drawn.  It's epic in every sense
of the word, from subject, spectacle, sentiment, and, most of all,
seriousness--and, as such, I have no idea how it will be received by the
public.
_Prince_'s larger-than-animated-life intentions are clearly--and most
memorably--spelled out by directors Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and
Simon Wells in the prologue.  "Deliver us to the promised land," pray the
Hebrews held in bondage by the Egyptian pharaoh Seti (voice of Patrick
Stewart) as Yocheved (Ofra Haza) sets her infant son Moses adrift on a
river in an attempt to spare him the life of a slave--and possibly free his
people in the future.  Moses is rescued from the sea by the Queen (spoken
by Helen Mirren, sung by Linda Dee Shayne), who takes Moses in as her own.
This sequence is truly astonishing, from the visuals to the haunting song
that scores it, "Deliver Us," composed by Stephen Schwartz.
The opening is just one in a long line of spectacular sequences in this
treatment of the Book of Exodus, in which Moses's (spoken as an adult by a
full-voiced Val Kilmer, sung by Amick Byram) bond with adoptive brother and
eventual pharaoh Rameses (Ralph Fiennes, well-cast) is broken after he
discovers his true identity--and calling--and crusades for his people's
freedom.  The animators exploit all that the medium currently offers and
then elevate it to the next level: a harrowing nightmare scene is made even
more chilling by being told in pantomime through hieroglyhics; and
computer-generated effects are effectively, and unobtrusively, used to
enhance such crucial scenes as Moses's encounter with the burning bush, the
deaths of the firstborns, and the dazzling parting of the Red Sea.
Artistically speaking in the literal sense, _Prince_ is easily the most
impressive animated feature ever made.
But there's more to the film than awesome visuals, which would be empty
without an absorbing story and characters.  _Prince_ has both, regardless
of the viewer's religious beliefs; the themes of brotherhood, freedom, and
faith (in oneself) are universal, and they resonate strongest in the film's
quieter scenes.  In fact, these quieter scenes hold the most lasting
impact: simple moments like Moses feeling the desert sand blow over his
entire body, or, my personal favorite, the song number "When You Believe,"
which is currently out as an overblown pop single performed by Whitney
Houston and Mariah Carey.  The film version, sung to Moses by his sister
Miriam (spoken by Sandra Bullock, sung by Sally Dworsky) and wife Tzipporah
(spoken _and_ sung by Michelle Pfeiffer, in fine vocal form) is beautiful
and transcendent, building a muted yet no less powerful crescendo of
complex emotion; in the pop version, any and all emotion is lost under all
the diva bluster.
Schwartz, a veteran lyricist for Disney animated efforts (the two most
underrated, _Pocahontas_ and _The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_), also writes
the melodies here, and his song score is not without a couple of missteps.
"Playing with the Big Boys," sung by Rameses's court magicians Hotep (Steve
Martin) and Huy (Martin Short) is a throwaway, and the just-OK "Through
Heaven's Eyes," sung by Tzipporah's father Jethro (spoken by Danny Glover,
sung by Brian Stokes Mitchell), is redeemed by the dramatic importance of
the scene it accompanies.  By and large, Schwartz does a more than adequate
job, exemplified by his two standout compositions, the aforementioned
"Deliver Us" and "When You Believe."  However, Schwartz's work comes close
to being overshadowed by Hans Zimmer's towering score, which is sure to win
an Oscar nomination.
As superlative as _The_Prince_of_Egypt_ is, in all likelihood, it will not
receive its just due from the moviegoing masses weaned on the
tried-and-true Disney animated recipe of singing animals and easy comic
relief; there is neither here, and the religious themes will undoubtedly
keep many away.  And that is a shame, for not only _Prince_ is a landmark
cinematic achievement, the entire fate of its medium is dependent on its
financial success.  Robust box office would not only pose a long-overdue
animation threat to Disney, but it would also erase the medium's "kids'
movie" stigma, allowing filmmakers to explore the medium's heretofore
untapped potential through more complex, serious, and adult themes.  But,
as the film's signature song goes, "There can be miracles when you
believe"--a statement that does hold some water in the fickle movie
marketplace.

Title
Review for Beautiful People (1999)
A couple of people walked out, never to return, about 20 minutes into
this British import, and I can understand their impatience.  Jasmin
Dizdar's is packed with a number of characters and plotlines and takes
its sweet time setting them all up that the opening stages cannot help
but seem like a complete jumble.  But to quote the trailer for
_Magnolia_--to which this somewhat similar film has been compared--"this
will all make sense in the end."  _Beautiful_People_ is cut from the same
Altman-esque cloth as Paul Thomas Anderson's film, following different
lives as they criss-cross over a stretch of days in London.
One key difference is that these lives mostly, in some way, end up
touching upon a central issue: the unrest in Bosnia.  Two men who knew
each other in the old country--one a Serb (Dado Jehan), the other a Croat
(Faruk Pruti)--meet by chance on a bus and then proceed to beat the
living daylights out of each other, landing themselves in the hospital. 
There, Portia (Charlotte Coleman), a med student borne of a rich English
family, falls for a fresh Bosnian immigrant named Pero (Edin
Dzanzanovic), whom she treated during rounds.  The mishap that brought
him there was related by association to the sad and angry Dr. Mouldy
(Nicholas Farrell), whose wife has just left him; among his patients is
one Bosnian refugee (Walentine Giorgiewa) bearing a war enemy's child. 
Dr. Mouldy lives next door to a strict teacher (Roger Sloman), whose son
Griffin (Danny Nussbaum) hangs with a drug-addled crowd.  Among Dr.
Mouldy's son's schoolmates is the daughter of a BBC news reporter
(Gilbert Martin) whose latest location assignment is in... Bosnia.
Despite the serious issue that serves as the film's connective tissue,
_Beautiful_People_ is not overwhelmingly grim.  There are moments of
sadness and shocking brutality, but there are just as many more comic
moments, in particular Griffin's hilariously unpredictable yet strangely
moving thread.  The film is also more about Bosnia: it's about the
immigrant experience in general; it's about tolerance; it's about making
a difference; it's about learning to make the best of what one has. 
_Beautiful_People_ is indeed a beautiful film, one that is
thought-provoking and moving while always remaining entertaining.

Title
Review for Phantom, The (1996)
After the colossal box office disappointments The Rocketeer and The
Shadow, one would think that Hollywood would have given up on bringing
fairly obscure comic book characters to the big screen.  Alas, that isn't
the case, but one wishes that were after seeing The Phantom, a silly,
unexciting film treatment of Lee Falk's comic book hero of the same name.
Billy Zane plays Kit Walker, the latest in his family to assume the
mantle of the Phantom--purple-clad defender of the jungle's riches against
pirates, looters, and greed in general.  The latter is personified in one
Xander Drax (Treat Williams), a wealthy business tycoon of some sort who is
determined to find three sacred skulls which, when joined, are a source of
immense supernatural power.  Needless to say, it's up to "the ghost who
walks" to prevent Drax from gaining possession of the three skulls.
Simon Wincer's (Lonesome Dove, Free Willy) film does move very
quickly and efficiently; the film opens with a concise introduction to the
legend of the Phantom that lasts little more than a minute, and he keeps the
action moving accordingly.  However, the film, for all its effects and
stunts, is strangely unexciting and devoid of fun.  The action set pieces,
especially the fights, look and feel scripted and staged, lacking any
spontaneous energy that would make it the slightest bit convincing; it's
hard to have fun with comic book antics that are so forced and calculated.
Wincer also fails to create a distinct tone; at times he appears to be going
for a tongue-in-cheek comic book that's in on the joke and aware of its
ridiculous excesses (which would have been the best choice), but at other
times he plays it too straight, which doesn't suit a film about a guy
wearing purple tights who rides on horseback in the jungle in the 1930s.
But it's not as if Wincer had a great script to work with.  Jeffrey Boam's
script is little more than Batman meets Indiana Jones, or, more
appropriately, The Shadow meets Congo--by-the-numbers, predictable action
scenes involving a mysterious costumed hero in the wilds interspersed with
city scenes set against Art Deco architecture and vintage automobiles.
The performances also reflect this unevenness of tone.  A
dark-haired Kristy Swanson, as the love interest, Diana Palmer, goes the
straight route and comes off stiff and out of place.  On the other side of
the coin is Williams, who camps it up as Drax in an apparent attempt to
reach the entertaining, manic heights a la Alan Rickman in Robin Hood:
Prince of Thieves.  Problem is, though, while Rickman chewed the scenery, he
still came off as a menacing, formidable villain; Williams just comes off as
a laughable caricature.  Early on, Catherine Zeta Jones's Sala has the
makings of a fun femme fatale along the lines of GoldenEye's Xenia Onatopp,
but her character makes an inexplicable, abrupt change for the worse late in
the game.  The only one who achieves the appropriate balance is Zane, who
never takes himself too seriously (how could he, given that ridiculous
outfit?) while still investing a certain amount of serious conviction to the
role.  Zane has an appealing, self-effacing sense of humor; he is as
credible firing guns as he is tossing off one-liners.  If only screenwriter
Boam gave him more opportunities to do the latter.
One thing that did strike me about The Phantom were its connections
to--yes--Showgirls.  Al Ruscio, who played the owner of the Stardust in that
disastrous film, turns up as the corrupt New York police commissioner, and
Showgirls costume designer Marlene Stewart came up with the duds for this
picture; also, the end credits are printed in the same typeface as those of
Showgirls.  But that's where the connections end, for the blah The Phantom
is not nearly as much fun as that awful, awfully entertaining howlfest.

Title
Review for Unbreakable (2000)
_Unbreakable_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
Following the phenomenal--and completely out-of-nowhere--success of
_The_Sixth_Sense_, it would have been easy for writer-director M. Night
Shyamalan to follow that act with another eerie tale of the supernatural.
 All early indicators, in particular Disney's publicity campaign, paint
_Unbreakable_ as exactly that: a creepy thriller "from the director of
_The_Sixth_Sense_."  _Unbreakable_ is indeed "creepy," but not in the way
moviegoers are expecting (and, perhaps, desiring); the film gradually
evolves from one thing into another animal entirely, its true nature
slowly but surely "creeping" to the fore.  What _Unbreakable_ becomes is
certain to divide the opinions of audiences and critics alike, but that's
exactly what makes it a much more fascinating film than its predecessor.
That said, _Unbreakable_ shares many qualities with Shyamalan's last
film.  Star Bruce Willis is back, this time playing David Dunn, an
everyman Philadelphia security guard.  Unexplained cosmic phenomena are
again involved, here David's miraculous survival of a devastating train
wreck and the fact that he emerges from the accident completely
unharmed--which piques the interest of Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson),
an art dealer suffering from a crippling bone disorder.  What unfolds
from here occurs at the same languid pace that for me was a major factor
in _The_Sixth_Sense_'s ruin.
But in the case of _Unbreakable_, the slowness works more in its favor. 
In _Sense_, the deliberate pacing underscored how nothing really happens
from the "I see dead people" confession (which already takes about an
hour to get to) to the pull-the-rug-out twist ending.  Here, the crawl is
a mirror of the rate at which David comes into his own--a progression
which is itself reflective of how Shyamalan takes his time to fully
reveal what exactly he's trying to accomplish with this film.
All I will say about Shyamalan's ultimate aim is that it is could not be
more radically different from expectations--so far off, in fact, that the
film will undoubtedly leave many viewers with quizzical looks and a
feeling of grave disappointment.  But once the film is removed from those
preconceived notions, the element of surprise proves to be
_Unbreakable_'s greatest virtue, not to mention a quality richer and more
elegantly pulled off than it was in _Sense_.  In that film, the shock
came in a quick, last-minute burst that jolted everything that preceded
it into a new perspective.  Here, the film's final turn is the
culmination of what had been a movie-long build; the exhilarating final
"click" in a puzzle whose pieces had been working their way--with
ever-increasing speed--toward alignment.
Crucial to the persuasiveness of _Unbreakable_'s story are the grounded
performances.  Willis is in the same lower gear that distinguished his
_Sense_ work, and he nicely disappears into the character and his
uncertainties.  Jackson's role offers a little more latitude, but his
portrayal is firmly rooted in reality despite Elijah's rather unique
hairdo (which proves to be an effective touch by the film's end).  Robin
Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark are fine as David's wife and son,
respectively, but they are saddled with the weaker parts of the story. 
Wright Penn's subplot--the Dunns' rocky marriage--could be written off as
being unnecessary, but it is actually integral in creating a believably
real world in which some rather fantastical occurrences take place.
And that, right there, is likely to be the common complaint about
_Unbreakable_--that it's unbelievable.  Of course, that gripe is
completely absurd, given that most audiences will be going in
anticipating a just-as--if not more--unreal horror show of sorts.  Having
already concocted a ghost story that was less about scary apparitions
than it was about people, Shyamalan makes a lateral move with
_Unbreakable_, attempting to bring that same down-to-earth human element
to a different type of surreal-by-definition genre.  One's ability to see
just how well he has pulled off this even more unconventional task simply
depends on one's willingness to accept the new rules Shyamalan adopts for
this film.

Title
Review for Entrapment (1999)
_Entrapment_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
About a third into _Entrapment_, we have learned the following about
Catherine Zeta-Jones: her character is an insurance investigator trying
to nail a world famous thief by posing as a thief herself; she is very
athletic and remarkably limber (watch her slither her way around a grid
of security lasers); she struggles with an American accent (her natural
Welsh lilt always creeps through); and she looks smashing in a skin-tight
cat suit.  In short, we have learned just about everything--except for
one teensy detail: her character's name.
This is a problem, but one that it easily forgiven; after all, maybe
director Jon Amiel was as distracted by Zeta-Jones's magnetism--and, for
that matter, that of leading man Sean Connery--as the audience is.  Their
combined charisma keeps _Entrapment_ watchable.  What it doesn't,
however, is make this action adventure terribly exciting.  That's Amiel's
job, and he does not appear to know quite how to approach it.
Amiel does stage a particularly tense heist scene where undercover
investigator Virginia Baker (yes, that is Zeta-Jones's character name)
and her quarry, master thief Robert MacDougal (Connery) team up to steal
a precious mask.  But that's about the only thrill scene that Amiel
doesn't fumble in some way.  An early car chase is too abbreviated to
make any sort of impression, and a high-wire climax is too contrived and
conventionally staged to be very suspenseful.  Amiel handles the quieter
moments better, but there he is largely helped by the the rapport between
his megawatt stars.  Even that, however, isn't always enough; the two
can't hide the fact that the manipulative, overly drawn-out resolution
could have used a lot more tightening in the editing room.
The many twists in the script by Ron Bass and William Broyles Jr. do not
always make complete sense, but it delivers enough surprises to keep the
audience on their toes and interested.  But without some real zest and
style on the directorial end--which ousted helmer Antoine Fuqua
(_The_Replacement_Killers_) could have brought to the
project--_Entrapment_ is more of a diversion than a true thriller.

Title
Review for Can't Hardly Wait (1998)
Can't Hardly Wait (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Trust me, you _can_ wait for this messy throwback to '80s teen comedies.
A big, post-graduation blowout bash is the setting at which a number of new
high school graduates set out to resolve some long-simmering issues, most
prominently the shy Preston's (Ethan Embry) unspoken love for the popular
Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who was just dumped by her jock boyfriend
Mike (Peter Facinelli).  This thread is supposed to be the emotional hook
of the piece, but it is done in by the underwritten character of Amanda;
Preston claims to see the "person inside" her glammed-up exterior, but the
audience is never treated to a glimpse of this purported interior soul.
All that shows up on screen is an above-it-all, constantly bitching snob,
and as such writer-directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont do a
disservice to the engaging performance of Embry.
Far more involving--and upstaging the central action--is a subplot
following the unlikely but inevitable romance between Preston's acerbic
best friend Denise (the delightful Lauren Ambrose) and Ebonics-spouting
white boy Kenny (a hilarious Seth Green), who find themselves locked in a
bathroom together.  This thread is sweet yet raucous, and often very funny,
which is the mix Kaplan and Elfont obviously strived for in their other
storylines.  But all else, including a predictable arc about the geeky
valedictorian's (Charlie Korsmo) beef with Mike, quickly grows tiresome, as
does the movie as a whole.

Title
Review for Eyes Wide Shut (1999)
_Eyes_Wide_Shut_ (R) **** (out of ****)
The late Stanley Kubrick's long-awaited final film, _Eyes_Wide_Shut_, is
the perfect example of a true NC-17 film--but not in the way one would be
led to believe.  Ever since production began on the film way back in the
fall of 1996, rumors have been swirling about the sexual content of the
film: "Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman bare all and really do the nasty";
"Tom wears a dress"; "Tom lusts after teenage Leelee Sobieski"--if the
reports were to be believed, _Eyes_Wide_Shut_ would turn out to be a
high-budget, A-list porn film.  Fanning the flames of speculation was the
now-familiar scene of a nude Cruise and Kidman making love in front of a
mirror, the first taste of the film made available to the public.
Having seen the actual film, I advise anyone ready to don their
raincoats for a showing of _Eyes_Wide_Shut_ to think twice.  Yes, there
is some strong sexual content (some of which was altered to receive an R
rating, but more on that later), but not the wall-to-wall fornication as
had been whispered.  Rather than _being_ sex, _Eyes_Wide_Shut_ is _about_
sex--a film that explores this adult theme in a sensitive, mature, and
thoughtful manner.  If that isn't a film that could not better exemplify
a rating that simply means, in its literal definition, "No one 17 and
under admitted," then I don't know what is.
Kubrick isn't above a little playful teasing, and that's what he does
for the opening section of _Eyes_Wide_Shut_, which appears to suggest all
manner of ensuing tawdriness.  The opening shot is of Kidman's character,
former art gallery manager (_not_ psychiatrist nor medical doctor) Alice
Harford, doffing her duds and baring nearly all.  Once fully dressed, she
and her husband, Dr. Bill Harford (Cruise) make their way to a swank
party thrown by wealthy friend Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack, in a role
once meant for Harvey Keitel).  At the soirée, a tipsy Alice engages in a
dangerous flirtation with an anonymous partygoer while eyeing her husband
getting friendly with a pair of seductive models.
Not too long after that, a fully nude female form appears onscreen, but
not in the way one would expect.  Similarly unexpected is the turn that
soon comes in one astonishing Cruise-Kidman bedroom scene, which reveals
itself to be the film's driving dramatic force.  While this scene is all
about sex, it is not _of_ sex; in fact, it is of words describing sex,
and in decidedly inexplicit terms.  What lends this scene such power,
however, is the hypnotic effect that comes when all facets of cinema are
triumphantly married: photography, editing, writing, and especially
directing and acting.  A description of what the scene literally entails
would sound deceptively simple and thus completely fail to do it justice.
 Directed with remarkable precision and control by Kubrick and quite
simply the most triumphant moment in Kidman's entire acting career, this
scene is the first of _Eyes_Wide_Shut_'s fair share of haunting moments.
This charged encounter sends Bill off into the streets and the film into
its main (for lack of a better term) action, where in one, long night, he
is simultaneously repulsed and enticed by various sex-related situations
he happens to stumble upon.  The decadent centerpiece of his journey (and
of the film itself) is a now-notorious orgy sequence, made even more
controversial by the addition of some obvious digital effects work used
to obscure some sex acts--and hence secure an R rating.  From what I
understand, no genitalia nor glimpses of penetration could be seen in
Kubrick's unobstructed view, which is just as well--the point of the
scene is not to titillate but to create an unsettling atmosphere where
desire and carnal curiosity becomes tinged with danger and outright fear.
(The atmosphere is stunningly bolstered by Jocelyn Pook's chilling
minimalist score.)  The point still comes across in the censored version,
but undoubtedly diluted, for the unconvincing CGI work just serves to
distract more than anything else.
This bit of censorship (which Warner Bros. insists was approved by
Kubrick before his sudden death in March) also shows just how
out-of-touch the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings board
is.  It fails to realize that it's not the presence of sex that matters
but its context and intended effect.  For all the scandalous associations
that come with an orgy, there is nothing exploitative about the sequence;
it is far more disturbing than it is the slightest bit arousing (which it
isn't), and the sex is a means to a cinematic end and not the end itself.
Kubrick, his co-scripter Frederic Raphael (working from the
"inspiration" of Arthur Schnitzler's novel _Traumnovelle_), Cruise, and
Kidman's end is to create a probing and painfully real examination of a
marriage, relationships in general, and basic human desire and nature. 
Clocking in at well north of the two-and-a-half-hour mark, there is bound
to be a slow stretch here and there, and one late plot revelation is a
bit too easily predictable; but overall, there is nary a false note in
the execution.  Though receiving equal star billing and delivering an
outstanding and  revealing (in every way) performance, Kidman's presence
definitely takes a backseat to that of her on- and off-screen husband,
who dominates the screen time.  Cruise's innate likability and
average-guy appeal makes him the ideal audience surrogate for this foray
into the sexual underground; one can completely relate to his fascination
and fear of all that he witnesses.  The secondary roles are also
well-cast, from Pollack (who, in the end, is probably a more effective
choice for his role than Keitel could have been) and Sobieski (as a
fetching nymphet) to a hilarious Alan Cumming as a hotel desk clerk who
makes no secret of his interest in Bill.  The one strained performance
comes from Marie Richardson, who bears a passing resemblance to her
role's original portrayer, Jennifer Jason Leigh (who was replaced when
she was unavailable for reshoots); though stiff and awkward in her single
scene with Cruise, her work is far from ruinous to the film.
It would take something much larger than that to detract from the vision
of Kubrick, to whose control the audience completely surrenders.  The
common reaction once the end credits began to run was a simple "hmm," and
while it doesn't sound that way, that is a good thing.  _Eyes_Wide_Shut_
is thought-provoking, but the film's spell goes beyond that; it makes you
_want_ to think about it afterward.  That feeling even permeated this
week's gala premiere of the film; in post-screening interviews, many of
the celebrities in attendence expressed their need to think about what
they had just seen.
That, right there, makes me somewhat grudgingly grateful that the film
didn't end up hitting screens with the dreaded NC-17 rating. 
_Eyes_Wide_Shut_ is a rich, challenging work, and as such, it is certain
to fly clear over the heads of a baffled American moviegoing public;
consequently, the film is all but certain to die a quick--and
much-talked-about--box office death.  And in this entertainment/political
climate of scapegoating, had the film been released with an NC-17,
fingers would have been pointed at the rating, rendering it even more
useless than it already is.  If one of the biggest, if not the biggest,
movie star in the world is unable to make an NC-17 film commercially
viable (regardless of its subject matter, challenging or otherwise), then
no one would ever want to touch the NC-17 ever again.  There is no
excusing Warner Bros.'s tampering with Kubrick's work, but at least it
leaves the door open for another name star, another high-profile
director, and a major studio bold enough to take risks meant to be seen
exclusively by an adult audience.  However, the sad case remains that it
is sure to be a very long while before anyone dares to think of entering
that doorway again.

Title
Review for Summer of Sam (1999)
_Summer_of_Sam_ (R) **** (out of ****)
"There are many stories to be told in the naked city; this is just one."
 This line, which is uttered during the conclusion of _Summer_of_Sam_,
could not better sum up Spike Lee's terrific film.  The film's title does
refer to the serial killer Son of Sam, but, as that line says, that is
just one of the many stories followed in the film.  More than anything
else, _Summer_of_Sam_ is a portrait of its chosen time period, the hot
New York summer of 1977.  And what a vivid portrait it is.
Son of Sam (played by Michael Badalucco, also notoriously known as "the
44-caliber killer" for his weapon of choice, plays a prominent role in
the film, but not in the way one would expect.  While a few of his
murders are depicted in horrifyingly bloody detail and his reign of
terror provides the film with its time frame, _Summer_of_Sam_ is
concerned less with him than his psychological effect on people in New
York City, namely the Bronx.  Films dealing with serial killers often
tackle this angle, but usually the people in question are either victims'
families or the cops investigating the crimes.  The characters whose
lives are examined in _Summer_of_Sam_ have no direct ties to the killer
nor his activities, but they are all profoundly affected by them.
The effects, of course, widely vary with the person.  Dionna (Mira
Sorvino) more or less tries to live life as she always has even though
she fits the common victim's demographic of "woman with shoulder-length
brown hair."  Her husband Vinny (John Leguizamo), on the other hand,
fears that the killer has seen him during one of his many extramarital
trysts and is thus a target.  While not necessarily a reaction to Son of
Sam, Vinny's old friend Ritchie (Adrien Brody) has undergone a radical
personality change, embracing the anarchic spirit of punk rock, which he
spreads to old friend and eventual lover Ruby (Jennifer Esposito).
These are just the starting points for these characters; as the film and
Son of Sam's killing spree progresses, their relationships and
personalities undergo drastic shifts.  While Vinny's less-than-blissful
marriage to Dionna is given perhaps the most screen time, the focal
relationship is between Vinny and Ritchie, whose deviant behavior leads
people to erroneously suspect him of wrongdoing.  The actors give superb
work, and in the case of Brody and especially Leguizamo (of whom, I must
admit, I have never been a fan), career-best work, investing these often
unlikable characters with enough humanity to command our sympathies.
By extension, praise goes to Lee and his writing collaborators Victor
Colicchio and Michael Imperioli, who do a deft job of weaving the
fact-based stream of events surrounding Son of Sam with the fictional
storylines they have created.  All the characters were going to do what
they do regardless, but, as depicted by Lee and the writers, being in
such extreme circumstances heightens the tension and thus gives them a
push toward more extreme actions.  Even more impressive is how the story
is convincingly manipulated to spin around the entire picture of the
culture at the time, from the liberating abandon of punk to disco's
spirit of limitless pleasure.
 _Summer_of_Sam_ ultimately belongs to Lee, who makes nary a false move
here.  He has always been a great creator of images, and the ones he
presents here make a powerful impact.  One memorable montage sequence
scored to "Teenage Wasteland" is a marvel of both freedom (in its driving
energy) and control (in economically advancing the story and distilling
the society's mood of the moment).
The visceral impact comes second to the film's emotional power, which
hits hard by film's end.  There are no easy answers nor tidy resolutions,
which is just as well.  _Summer_of_Sam_ may strike some as unsatisfying
in that sense, but that is what is what makes it such a convincing slice
of ordinary lives during an extraordinary time.

Title
Review for Six Ways to Sunday (1999)
_Six_Ways_to_Sunday_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
What is it with independent films with days of the week in their title?
Last fall brought the awful _Thursday_, a pointless, plotless, blood-soaked
exercise in nihilism.  I thought it couldn't possibly get any worse than
that detestable film, here comes _Six_Ways_to_Sunday_, which would more
aptly be called _97_Minutes_to_Nowhere_.
_Six_Ways_ exemplifies, all too painfully, the traditional criticisms of
independent film: pretentiousness, self-indulgent artiness, graphic
violence, a would-be "hip" sense of humor, a touch of "taboo" subject
matter.  The flat-out awfulness shouldn't be a surprise once one discovers
what director/co-scripter (with Marc Gerald) Adam Bernstein's only other
credit is: arguably the worst big screen _Saturday_Night_Live_ of all time,
_It's_Pat_.  _Six_Ways_ follows Ohio teen Harry Odum (Norman Reedus), whose
progress up the mafia ranks and budding romance with a mafia maid (Elina
Lowensohn) causes some strain with his beloved, overprotective--to say the
very least--mother (Deborah Harry).
As with any film, _Six_Ways_'s effectiveness--or, rather, lack
thereof--lies in the execution, and while the basic story (loosely based on
Charles Perry's novel _Portrait_of_a_Young_Man_Drowning_) may not sound so
bad, it's everything else that makes the film as unwatchable as it is.  The
dialogue is often laughable in the wrong way; the direction a study in how
_not_ to make a film (all  flashy cuts and "surreal" visual narrative
devices; jarringly abrupt shifts in tone); and the acting is even worse.
Reedus is a former model for Prada, and his sub-amateurish performance
shows it; Harry and Lowensohn duke it out for worst performance when their
characters square off over Harry's affections.  The only person, in front
of or behind the camera, who makes any kind of positive impression is
Adrien Brody, who plays Harry's wannabe gangsta best friend.  That it is
also one of the lesser performances I've seen Brody give says a lot about
just how insufferable this worst-of-'99 shoo-in is.  (opens March 5)

Title
Review for Turn It Up (2000)
_Turn_It_Up_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
        Another day, another urban drama starring rappers with acting
aspirations.  The latest entry, _Turn_It_Up_, offers nothing that hasn't
been seen nor heard before--lots of gunplay, beatings, drug and alcohol
abuse, all to a hip-hop soundtrack.  But it is distinctive in a most
dubious sense--this is perhaps the worst film of its kind to see a
theatrical release.
        Mind you, this isn't the worst rapper-starring urban drama ever
made; it doesn't quite reach the depths plumbed by the direct-to-video
projects produced by and featuring Ice-T.  But _Turn_It_Up_ is pretty
awful in its own respect.  Scripter-director Robert Adetuyi put in very
little thought to the plot, which plays into the common perception that
the rap music business is dirty and violence-riddled.  Diamond (Pras,
late of the Fugees) wants to break into said industry, but the studio
time for cutting his demo is also cutting deep into what little money he
earns doing menial jobs for a local drug lord named Mr. B. (Jason
Statham).  When the already steep price for the recording sessions goes
up, Diamond's hotheaded best friend and partner Gage (Ja Rule) comes up
with a seemingly foolproof--and, of course, illegal--funding plan. 
Needless to say, the plan doesn't go off without a hitch or two.
        To say that _Turn_It_Up_ doesn't go off without a hitch or two is
an understatement.  Beyond the tired, predictable plot--and the equally
dull subplots, such as Diamond's fed-up girlfriend (Tamala Jones) and the
sudden surfacing of Diamond's long-absent father (Vondie Curtis-Hall, way
beneath his league here)--there's some truly abysmal dialogue (Diamond's
raps are invariably described as "hot") and acting to match.  Jones and
Curtis-Hall emerge with their dignity intact, but that's partly a side
effect of having fairly little screen time and mostly because they
actually have some acting ability.  That cannot be said of everyone else.
 The two rap stars leading the cast are no acting finds; Pras is stiff,
and Ja Rule subscribes to the adage, "if you can't act, overact."  As bad
as they are, they are outdone by the weak work of Statham and the
laughably atrocious John Ralston, who plays record label bigwig Mr.
White.
        But what really does in _Turn_It_Up_ is what's under the terrible
execution--or, rather, what isn't there.  The script doesn't offer any
reason why we should really care about any of these characters and what
happens to them, nor do these characters exhibit any qualities that would
consistently engage our interest.  For all the mayhem that fills the
screen in _Turn_It_Up_--and there is a lot of it, both visual and
sonic--the film is still a crushing bore.

Title
Review for Chasing Amy (1997)
If making a convincing love story between a heterosexual male and a
lesbian sounds like an impossible task, then writer-director Kevin Smith has
accomplished the impossible with the final installment of his New Jersey
trilogy, Chasing Amy.  A funny, raunchy comedy with both intelligence and
heart to spare, Clerks wunderkind Smith has rebounded in a big way from the
creative meltdown that was 1995's Mallrats.
The dark shadow of that unsatisfying sophomore effort hangs over the
opening moments of Amy.  We see the credits roll over comic book panels and
covers of the comic publications Wizard, Comic Shop News, and Comic Buyer's
Guide, which is more than a little reminiscent of the parade of comic book
covers that opened Mallrats.  One of the biggest miscalculations in Mallrats
was not so much its large use of comic-related humor and references but its
use of references that only comic fans (such as myself) would understand,
and for a moment I thought Smith was repeating his previous mistake--I was
familiar with these publications; I got the reference, but did everyone
else?  Immediately following the credit roll is a sequence taking place in a
New York comic convention, and, ironically enough, here is where my fears
were put to rest.  While the comic-related references and humor are abound,
the jokes are accessible to anyone who has never picked up a comic book in
his or her life.  It's as if Smith is righting the wrong he committed in
Mallrats.
With the atonement for that sin behind him, Smith wastes no time in
plunging deep into fresh new territory.  It is at this convention that New
Jersey comic creator Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) meets fellow writer/artist
Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), and there is an instant chemistry and, as
Holden sees it, an attraction.  As it turns out, however, Alyssa is a
lesbian, and despite Holden's initial reservations--and his very strong
sexual feelings for her--the two become very close (but platonic) friends,
sparking the chaste (or is it?) jealousy of Holden's best friend and
collaborator, Banky Edwards (Jason Lee).
The story already sounds pretty complicated, but Smith's terrific
script has many more twists in store, not to mention laughs.  Viewers like
myself who loved the no-budget riot Clerks but were left cold by Mallrats
will be happy to know that Smith has indeed recaptured his comedic touch.
But, most importantly, the frank (and, for some, maybe too frank), often
foul-mouthed dialogue is not only funny but sounds convincing.  The laugh
lines sound anything but scripted, capturing the spontaneity of actual
conversation; the same can be said of the more serious passages, which are
astoundingly full of truth and honest emotion.
There is also more to Smith's writing than the dialogue.  The
characters are fascinating in just how true-to-life they are.  For example,
Holden fancies himself a liberal thinker, but, of course, he's quite as
liberal as he believes himself to be.  Late in the picture, Holden is
disturbed by details of Alyssa's past, which naturally puts a crimp in their
relationship.  Looking plainly from a moviegoer's standpoint, Holden's
treatment of Alyssa seems off-base, but his actions are completely in line
with how a real person would react in a similar situation.  Like many other
films, there's a big scene where our protagonist offers a solution to all
that ails him and his friends, but Smith does not serve up the convention
where a character gains greater maturity, understanding, and insight
overnight as he or she only can in the movies.  Smith doesn't forget who
Holden is, and as such he respects the viewers' intelligence.
Of course, the actors deserve a lot of credit for making the people
and situations in Chasing Amy so involving.  The likable Affleck does a good
job of capturing Holden's insecurities with himself and others.   Adams, who
can be described as what you get when you blend Cameron Diaz, Renee
Zellweger, Ellen Barkin, and the voice of Jennifer Tilly, takes longer to
warm up to, mainly because of her squeaky, Tilly-esque voice.  In the end,
though, she pulls off the difficult role of Alyssa--the heart of the film,
if you will--without a hitch, displaying a comic flair as well as an
emotional depth never hinted at in her heretofore most visible work: a guest
spot on Fox's Married...with Children and regular gigs on the short-lived
Married... spinoffs Top of the Heap and Vinnie and Bobby.  Lee, who was the
best thing about Mallrats, brings more of his hilarious smart-aleck charm to
the brash Banky.  Dwight Ewell has some choice moments as Hooper, a gay
black comic creator who acts like a black militant for better publicity; and
Jason Mewes and Smith himself contribute a memorable cameo as the Jersey
trilogy's recurring characters, Jay and Silent Bob, respectively, the latter
of whom isn't so silent this time around (in fact, he's the voice of reason).
Most people will see Chasing Amy as Kevin Smith's return to form,
but in doing so they may ignore just what a huge leap this film is for him
in his maturity as a filmmaker.  It's everything Clerks was (and Mallrats
wasn't) and more--funny, fearless... and profoundly moving.  Never did I
ever think I'd come away from a Smith film with a lump in my throat.

Title
Review for Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000)
_Nutty_Professor_II:_The_Klumps_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
"Eddie Murphy is the Klumps," state the print ads for
_Nutty_Professor_II:_The_Klumps_, and Universal must be commended for an
uncommon level of truth in advertising.  Peter Segal's entertaining
sequel to Tom Shadyac's smash 1996 remake of the Jerry Lewis starrer
_The_Nutty_Professor_ is, like the original, a stunning testimony to the
brilliance and versatility of its star.  Indeed, Eddie Murphy _is_ 
_The_Klumps_.
As in the first film, Murphy not only plays large, gentle Professor
Sherman Klump, but also Sherman's grouchy father Cletus, loving mother
Etta, surly brother Ernie, and feisty Granny--as well as Sherman's
destructive alter ego, Buddy Love.  As the film opens, Sherman is haunted
by and occasionally taken over by Buddy, the manifestation of his more
outspoken urges.  Seeing the ever-increasing emergence of his Buddy
personality as a threat to his relationship with his true love, colleague
Denise Gaines (Janet Jackson), Sherman undergoes a risky procedure to
have Buddy's DNA permanently removed from his brain.  Naturally, things
don't go as smoothly as planned, and while Buddy is indeed separated from
Sherman, he becomes an entirely separate person.
The science that brings about the rebirth of Buddy--who, in an inspired
twist, isn't quite his old self--is pure hokum, as are all the mechanics
behind the ingredient at the center of the film: Sherman's revolutionary
youth formula, which he hides from Buddy in the Klump family garage.  But
more than the Klump home plays an increased role in _Nutty II_; as the
title implies, Sherman's other family members are given subplots of their
own--most prominently Mama and Papa, who are looking to bring back some
spark in their marriage; and Granny, who has a new beau (Gabriel
Williams) with whom she shares the joy of "relations."  Not only are the
family members' roles expanded, so is the type of humor surrounding them.
 Director Peter Segal and writers Barry W. Blaustein, David Sheffield,
Paul Weitz, and Chris Weitz (the latter two the duo who directed
_American Pie_) haven't completely dropped the toilet humor that
characterized the Klump family's two scenes in the original film (though
they probably should have; the flatulence jokes are among the film's
flattest gags), but the bulk of their laughs derive from their
personalities--or in the case of hilariously bickering Papa and Granny,
the clash of them.
With a number of other Klumps getting their share of screen time along
with Sherman, not to mention Buddy (who once again plots Sherman's ruin),
something had to give, and what gets the short shrift is the romance. 
Jackson, in her first screen role since _Poetic_Justice_, is likable and
poised, but Denise is so blandly written, loving Sherman unconditionally
from first frame to the last and doing little else.  It would have been
nice to see their relationship develop, like the first film's more
endearing one between Sherman and Jada Pinkett's Carla Purdy (who is
briefly mentioned here); or at least run into some turbulence to create
some dramatic tension.  But since they're perfect for each other,
everything's perfect between them, and while that's all well and good, it
doesn't make for the most interesting of viewing.
But what never fails to interest is the virtuoso acting display by
Murphy.  With four credited writers, the script of _The_Klumps_ doesn't
always quite flow, but Murphy's unparalleled prowess smooths over the
rough spots.  Each character he plays is clearly, distinctly drawn and
funny and endearing in his or her own way.  Of course, Murphy's bravura
turn is aided immeasurably by Rick Baker's outstanding makeup work and
the efforts of the visual effects crew, but it is Murphy who gives each
one of the Klumps energy and soul.
That's what ultimately makes _The_Klumps_ an enjoyable time at the
movies: its overall high spirits--and, of course, the simple fact that it
makes you laugh.  And in the season of unpretentious cinematic
entertainment, that's what matters.

Title
Review for Way of the Gun, The (2000)
_The_Way_of_the_Gun_ (R) *** (out of ****)
        With his directorial debut _The_Way_of_the_Gun_, Christopher
McQuarrie, Oscar-winning screenwriter of _The_Usual_Suspects_, has said
that he "set out to make a crime film in a way that no one would ever ask
me to make another crime film again."  A number of critics and viewers
will doubtlessly hope no one does after witnessing all the buckets of
blood shed in this quasi-neo-Western.  But if one looks past the carnage,
one can see a solid entertainment further distinguished by fine
performances.
        Despite his Academy-endorsed writing skills, McQuarrie's script
is one of the weaker elements of the film.  The plot curves that he
throws into the story--in which Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh
(Benicio del Toro), a pair of small-time crooks, kidnap young surrogate
mother Robin (Juliette Lewis), to fetch a ransom from the child's wealthy
biological parents--aren't as clever (and, in my minority opinion, not
nearly as aggravating) as the ones that characterized the famously twisty
_Suspects_.  The wealth of the unborn baby's father, Hale Chidduck (Scott
Wilson), comes from predictably shady sources; gradually revealed are all
sorts of hidden entanglements are between the large cast of
characters--which also includes Chidduck's wife Francesca (Kristin
Lehman); his hired gun Joe Sarno (James Caan); the bodyguards hired to
protect Robin, Jeffers (Taye Diggs) and Obecks (Nicky Katt); and Robin's
doctor, Allen Painter (Dylan Kussman).  There is a sense of inevitability
to how some of the various developments come about, which doesn't so much
make the twists any less interesting (which they are) than less effective
in generating suspense.
        Another complaint likely to made about McQuarrie's script are the
fairly shallow characterizations, namely that of Parker and Longbaugh. 
The audience never learns anything about these guys except that they're
criminals (and not especially good ones), and they live by the way of the
gun.  But I don't see this as a flaw; so many films try to force some
psychological reasoning as to why certain people are bad that it's rather
refreshing to see a film that simply takes them at face value and leaves
them at that.  And with Phillippe and del Toro giving better performances
than usual (Phillippe's blankness is well-suited for such a cipher of a
character; del Toro mercifully doesn't indulge in his usual verbal tics),
the lack of insight into the pair is made even less of a problem.
        That general idea, taken on a larger scale, is why
_The_Way_of_the_Gun_ works--the shortcomings of the material is
compensated by the execution.  While everyone in the cast does a fine
job, the standouts are a nicely subtle Caan as the world-wise and -weary
bagman and especially Lewis--doing her best work in years--as the fragile
and very pregnant woman at the center of the whole mess.
        Of course, the strong work of the ensemble is just reflective of
the overall directorial job by McQuarrie.  Although it lasts a minute
under two hours, the film progresses at a steady pace and especially
comes alive during the exciting and often inventive action sequences. 
The most unusual and intriguing of these occurs early on: a slow-speed
(and I mean _slow_) car chase in which Jeffers and Obecks pursue Parker
and Longbaugh, who dangle their legs from the open doorways of their
vehicle--that is, when not abandoning it altogether at certain junctures.
        But McQuarrie naturally saves the biggest blowout for the end,
closing _The_Way_of_the_Gun_ with 30 minutes of raw gunplay and even
rawer bloodshed (not all caused by bullets).  For a number of viewers,
the sequence's unflinchingly excessive violence will be what ultimately
does in the film; but for others--such as myself--the over-the-top mayhem
closes the film on an electrifying high.

Title
Review for Snow Falling on Cedars (1999)
_Snow_Falling_on_Cedars_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Ethan Hawke may topline the credits of this adaptation of David Guterson's
highly-esteemed novel, but neither he nor anyone else in the cast can lay
claim to being the "star" of the film.  That title belongs to
director/co-scripter (with Ron Bass) Scott Hicks, who has crafted a lushly
evocative mood piece that has everything to do with sense and emotion as it
doesn't with traditional plot-driven satisfactions.
Of course, there is a story here, and the primary one revolves around the
1950 trial of Japanese-American Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), who is charged
with murder.  Kazuo is married to Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), whose heart truly
belongs to the caucasian Ishmael Chambers (Hawke), who runs the local
newspaper in the Pacific Northwest community of San Piedro.  They have been
in love ever since they were children, but anti-Japanese sentiment during
the WWII-era--culminating in her family's incarceration in the internment
camp of Manzanar--tore them apart.
There are more secondary character touches, such as Ishmael's struggle with
living up to his father's (Sam Shepard) legacy as a newspaperman, but all of
the narrative comes secondary to the depth of feeling Hicks, cinematographer
Robert Richardson, and composer James Newton Howard are able to convey
through imagery.  For a two-hour-plus film, _Snow_ is startlingly short on
dialogue, relying on sight and sound to tell the story for extended
passages.  It's said that a picture says a thousand words, and the images in
the film speak a lot more about the emotion of the piece than any scripted
lines.  This is best exemplified by the central Ishmael-Hatsue romance;
Hawke and Kudoh barely share any screen time, but one can feel the longing
between them to the point of heartache.  The story eventually catches up and
converges with the atmosphere in the end, making for the perfectly
transcendent conclusion to this beautiful work of art.

Review for Jungle2Jungle (1997)
Jungle 2 Jungle (PG) no stars (out of ****)
I was sitting here for about fifteen minutes trying to figure out a
snappy lead for my review of the new Tim Allen "comedy" Jungle 2 Jungle
until I realized it wasn't worth the trouble.  This remake of the French
blockbuster Little Indian, Big City (which was massacred by critics during
its brief stateside run last year) is pure crap, plain and simple.
Uptight New York commodities trader Michael Cromwell (Allen), during
a trip to visit his estranged-for-13-years doctor wife Patricia (JoBeth
Williams) in the Amazon village of Lipo Lipo), discovers he has a
13-year-old son named Mimi Siku (unpromising newcomer Sam Huntington) whom
Patricia raised in the wild with her.  Michael takes Mimi back to New York
with him per a promise he made to the boy, and hilarity supposedly ensues.
Right now, three days after I've seen the film, I'm still waiting for the
hilarity to ensue.
Just about everything about this film is sloppy, awful, and
creatively bankrupt.  In the Lipo Lipo-based first act, all director John
Pasquin and writers Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon do is sic exotic
animal after exotic animal on Michael.  First piranhas.  Then a spider.
Then alligators.  Then piranhas again.  How funny.  Things don't get any
better once the action shifts to New York, with Mimi Siku running around in
a loincloth, brandishing a bow and arrow, urinating in potted plants,
killing birds with his bow and arrow, and cooking up Michael's co-worker
Richard's (Martin Short) expensive tropical fish.  What fun.  Mimi Siku even
climbs to the top of the Statue of Liberty in a moment a press mailing from
Disney (complete with a working flashlight fashioned after the Statue's
torch) says, "reaches new heights of hilarity."  Whatever.  Mimi Siku's
ignorance of the ways of the "civilized" world is supposed to be charming,
but it's just insulting.  The character is an assemblage of every native
cliche and stereotype you can think of wrapped up in a young Anglo package,
which I guess is supposed to make it OK.  I don't think so.
By the time Mimi Siku makes his climb up Lady Liberty, I thought the
(bad) idea had been mined for whatever it was worth (nothing) and that the
film was almost over.  Not so.  The film creaks along for about another
forty minutes, introducing a couple of new plot threads fashioned just to
prolong the agony.  One thread involving a shady deal Richard makes with a
Russian mobster (David Ogden Stiers) is a complete waste of time, a
storyline whose only apparent purpose is to set up a truly painful Home
Alone-style slapstick climax.  Just when you think it couldn't get any
worse, there's the second thread, the sappy, cloying, gag-inducing romance
between Mimi Siku and Richard's clean-cut daughter Karen (LeeLee Sobiesky).
To call this development cornball is an understatement.
In fact, to call Jungle 2 Jungle bad is an understatement.  It's
awful.  Horrible.  Garbage.  A waste of time, money, and film stock.  I'm
sorry to say that most of the children in the audience ate this crap up,
which is just another disturbing sign that America's youth is in trouble.

Review for Waking Ned Devine (1998)
Fox Searchlight is pushing the modest Irish comedy _Waking_Ned_Devine_  as
this year's _The_Full_Monty_, and it more than reminds of that sleeper hit:
(1) it's a shameless, effective crowdpleaser, and (2) it's likely to be as
wildly overrated as that inexplicable Best Picture nominee.
Writer-director Kirk Jones's charming film can be best described as
_Grumpy_Old_Men_ with a dash of _It_Could_Happen_to_You_, with two crafty
codgers (Ian Bannen and David Kelly) leading the population of their tiny
village (a mere 52) in an attempt to claim a lottery jackpot won by a
recently deceased resident.  The film is as cute and enjoyable as it
sounds, and every bit as slight.  Beyond the basic premise, there's a touch
of romance involving a young pig farmer (James Nesbitt) and his
stench-sensitive love (Susan Lynch), a blackly comic zinger of a final
joke, and, unfortunately, not much in the way of memorable characters.
A bit meatier is another crowdpleaser from the same part of the globe,
the sweet British comedy _Little_Voice_.  The title character (Jane
Horrocks), nicknamed "L.V.", is a soft-spoken young woman who spends her
days and nights listening to her late, beloved father's old record
collection, much to the chagrin of her boozy floozy mother Mari (Brenda
Blethyn).  Through listening to the likes of Judy Garland and Shirley
Bassey, the meek L.V. has developed quite a big singing voice of her own,
catching the ear of one of Mari's greasy lovers, Ray Say (Michael Caine).
A wildly unsuccessful talent agent, Ray sees L.V. as his long-awaited
ticket to the big time.
Writer-director Mark Herman's script, based on Jim Cartwright's play
_The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Little_Voice_, goes through predictable, pedestrian
paces, with Mari and Ray attempting to exploit L.V.'s gift without paying
attention to her needs as a person.  (The only person who pays much
attention to her is kind, pigeon-raising telephone worker Billy, played by
Ewan McGregor.)  But what makes the film consistently engaging is its lead
trio of characters.  Caine and especially Blethyn are a hoot, exuding the
right mix of sleaze, sexuality, selfishness, and even sympathy; the power
of Ray's climactic breakdown comes as a bit of a shock.  But the star of
the film is indeed Horrocks, recreating her acclaimed stage role.  She is
quite simply remarkable, equally convincing speaking in a mousy murmur and
belting "Big Spender" with the full-throttle lungs of a true diva.
Horrocks, amazingly enough, not only did her own singing, she did it all
live on the set, with no pre-recorded help.  Quiet or loud, hers is the
voice that clearly rings throughout.  (_Waking_Ned_Devine_ opens November
20; _Little_Voice_ opens December 4)

Title
Review for Spawn (1997)
Spawn (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
        Todd McFarlane's comic book sensation Spawn is prime fodder for a
big-budget Hollywood movie treatment--there's a extravagantly costumed,
supernaturally powered, sometimes homicidal hero, resurrected from the dead,
whose primary enemy is none other than the devil himself.  After years of
topping comic sales charts, Spawn has indeed arrived to conquer the movie
arena, but something is seriously lacking; for all its visual razzle dazzle,
Mark Dippe's film is a mess--a misguided attempt to sanitize a concept whose
most distinctive trait is its darkness.
        To Dippe and scripter Alan McElroy's credit, McFarlane's basic
conceit remains intact: Spawn (Michael Jai White) was originally murdered
government agent Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) who makes a pact with the
devil to see beloved wife Wanda (Theresa Randle) one more time.  In return,
however, he must use his newfound supernatural powers to lead Hell's Army in
its quest to destroy Heaven and Earth.  Prodding Spawn into serving holding
up his end of the bargain is the Clown (John Leguizamo, having a ball in a
fat suit and heavy makeup), whose short, rotund exterior hides his true,
horrific self as the demonic Violator; urging him to rebel against the dark
side is Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson), a mysterious figure from the distant
past.
        The above is a fairly accurate distillation of comic's basics, but
the Spawn faithful know there is something deeper and richer behind the plot
fundamentals--an overwhelming sense of despair and anguish.  Spawn has a
great costume, some nifty powers, and a killer instinct, but the key to the
character is his emotional torment.  Al's passionate love for Wanda is what
drives him and also what cripples him.  Merely seeing her is not enough, and
being with her is an impossibility--not only because he's a severely burned
undead hellspawn but because she has gone on with her life.  Adding to his
angst is the fact that in the five years that have passed between his death
and rebirth, Wanda is remarried with a daughter, Cyan (Sydni Beaudoin), and
her new husband is none other than Al's best friend, Terry Fitzgerald (D.B.
Sweeney, putting a Caucasian face on a what is originally an
African-American character).
        For reasons only known to him, the intense emotional content that
McElroy successfully incorporated into the Spawn HBO animated series (which,
I may add, is a much more satisfying translation) is all but completely
absent in his script for the film.  The only hints at Spawn's torment are a
couple of anguished cries of "Wanda," and the rest of the time--which is
nearly all of the time--he's merely angry and vengeful, no different from
some heroes in any number of generic action films.  The dilution of the
emotion--and, in McElroy's most offensive move, having the normally brooding
Spawn utter a couple of lame _one-liners_--are obvious attempts to make the
character fit a more traditional mold and hence win an audience-friendly
PG-13 rating.  But this decision makes no sense, since it's Spawn's
untraditional, dark, R-rated nature that made him so interesting to begin with.
        Dippe, making his feature directorial debut, is a seasoned special
effects creator, so it should come as no surprise that Spawn is most
impressive and imaginative--and most faithful--in the visual arena.  The
jarring opening credits, complete with shaky, distorted lettering and nearly
subliminal glimpses of images, is highly reminiscent of Se7en's unsettling
main titles (which is a good thing).  The creative transitions between
scenes, such as having flames and capes wipe across the frame, effectively
recall the visual style of the comic, as do the characters' appearances.
The Clown and his demonic alter ego, the Violator, are every bit as
repellent in three-dimensions as they are on the page (even if, as part of
the PG-13 compromise, he does not perform any of his trademark heart
extractions), and Spawn is blessed with a wonderfully fluid,
computer-generated cape, which, unfortunately, only materializes from time
to time.  McFarlane has said that the cape's sporadic appearance in the film
(Spawn has his cape at all times in the comic and animated series) was a
conscious decision, so Spawn would look less "superhero-y."  Ironically,
though, he looks more conventional without it.  The true marvel is Dippe and
visual effects supervisor Steve "Spaz" Williams's vision of hell, a
stunningly organic blend of flame and rock--a true technical achievement.
        But that's the problem with Dippe's direction as a whole--it's _too_
technical.  Attention was paid to the visuals and little else.  The story,
involving a biological weapon developed by Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen, all
clenched teeth), the shady government agent responsible for Al's death, is
weak and doesn't make complete sense; even the action scenes are clumsily
handled, especially the climactic battle in hell, where the heavy editing
makes the action hard to follow.  But worst of all, there's no passion--no
real connection to the characters (no fault to White or the other actors,
who aren't really given much to work with in the script), no sense of
urgency to the tale.  The film is a feast for the eyes, yes, but there's
none of the soul that gives the comic its power.
        In its comic and animated form, Spawn pushes the creative envelope;
in this live-action, big-screen incarnation, Spawn plays it safe--much too
safe; so safe that I'm certain people being introduced to Spawn with this
movie will wonder just what all the fuss is about.  At a recent comic book
convention, producer Clint Goldman said with much confidence and certainty,
"There _will_ be a sequel."  Here's hoping that next time around the
filmmakers will take a lesson from its hero in the comic and go for the kill.

Title
Review for Thousand Acres, A (1997)

A Thousand Acres (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        The most telling moment of A Thousand Acres is neither an image nor
a scene but a credit: "Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Jane
Smiley"--not merely based on Smiley's novel, but her
_Pulitzer_Prize-winning_ novel.  This unusually blatant mention of its
award-winning pedigree not only highlights the self-important pretensions of
Jocelyn Moorhouse's overheated melodrama, but also how far from
award-caliber the film is.
        Early in the film lifelong Iowa farmer Larry Cook (Jason Robards)
decides to quit the business and split is 1000-acre lot between his three
daughters: loyal, optimistic eldest daughter Ginny (Jessica Lange); sassy,
bitter middle daughter Rose (Michelle Pfeiffer); and the youngest, big city
lawyer Caroline (Jennifer Jason Leigh).  This monumental decision causes
major upheaval to what appeared to be a perfect family, bringing
long-simmering tensions to the surface.
        What ensues is a tale of betrayal, abuse, adultery, cancer,
repressed memories--a blueprint for a potentially provocative and
Oscar-worthy tale.  But for all the hot-button issues screenwriter Laura
Jones packs into A Thousand Acres, the film itself does not pack the
emotional punch it so obviously strives for.  With so many serious issues
crammed in (including a fleeting reference to the dangers of contaminated
well water), Moorhouse's direction is often too overtly manipulative to
elicit a genuine emotional response.  The viewer is especially aware of the
button-pushing during the overtly "dramatic" confrontation scenes, in
particular one between Ginny, Rose, and Larry during a storm.  Melodramatic
music by Richard Hartley peals on the soundtrack as everyone yells at each
other and, for good measure, thunder roars in the background.  Everything is
so overblown as to feel processed and synthetic, and as such, the viewer
cannot feel anything authentic.
        A Thousand Acres does manage to generate some poignancy, though,
during the intimate scenes between the dazzling Pfeiffer and Lange, who
elevate the film to a higher level than it deserves.  Less is definitely
more here; the two have a natural sibling rapport (we feel both their anger
and love for one another), and Moorhouse wisely steps aside and lets that
speak for itself during these quieter moments.  Tears are shed, invective is
exchanged, and hearts are broken, but the material isn't overplayed--the
pitches are firm but not shrill, the tears slowly flowing instead of spewing
uncontrollably.  The two are magic together, and only in these scenes does
any hint of real emotion shine through.  One wishes that the film was solely
focused on their relationship than the business involving their father's land.
        But, unfortunately, the film _is_ titled A Thousand Acres, and the
other actors struggle with that less inspired side of the story.  Pity the
talented Leigh; while she also plays a Cook sister, she has scant screen
time, and in that time one never gets a satisfactory read on her character.
She starts off as sort of a black sheep and then becomes her father's big
supporter somewhere along the way; I could not figure out what motivated
her.  Robards appears to be a perfect fit for the Cook patriarch, but I was
never convinced that he could be seen as anything other than the crabby,
morally questionable man he eventually reveals himself to be.  He never
establishes any trace of gentleness or heart that would lead everyone to
believe that he is an upstanding member of the community; from the get-go
there seems to be something sinister lurking underneath.
        Propelled by a number of effective Pfeiffer-Lange scenes, the film
builds up some steam as it approaches its sentimental conclusion, but it
isn't quite enough.  By that time, any promise the film initially has proven
to be just that, promise, and instead of being profoundly moving, in the end
A Thousand Acres is little more than slightly affecting.

Title
Review for Rock, The (1996)
Put together two Oscar winners (Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage), an
Oscar nominee (Ed Harris), the slick producing team of Jerry Bruckheimer and
the late Don Simpson, a stylish action director (Michael Bay), Alcatraz, and
a bunch of explosives and you get... a major action hit, which The Rock is
sure to become this summer.
The somewhat preposterous plot has a group of renegade Marines, led
by General Francis X. Hummel (Harris), seizing control of the legendary
island prison, take its visitors hostage, and threatening to launch a deadly
biological weapon at the San Francisco bay area if the United States
Government does not give the families of dead Desert Storm vets millions in
government aid.  What does the government do?  Call in a force of Navy SEALs
(led by Michael Biehn), assisted by FBI biochemist Stanley Goodspeed (Cage)
and John Patrick Mason (Connery), an old prisoner who was the only person
ever to escape "the rock," to try to break into Alcatraz, thwart Hummel and
free the hostages.
Contrary to outward appearances, this project shares a number of
striking similarities with Bay's Bad Boys, and not just in terms of visual
style.  Both films open with a break-in; both feature an elaborate chase
sequence which ends with a circling shot of the hero(es) getting up off of
the street; both are essentially bickering buddy films; and in both one of
the heroes has to overcome a shortcoming that the other ridicules: in Bad
Boys, Martin Lawrence had to learn how to drive fast; in The Rock, Cage's
scientist character has to learn how to handle a combat situation.  Parts of
the film are also strongly reminiscent of Crimson Tide, with a little
Executive Decision and Outbreak thrown in.  But these similarities to other
films don't detract from the enjoyment of The Rock on its own terms, which
is not to say it's not without its problems.  While its opening 45 minutes
are far from boring, it takes that long for the plot to really get going,
i.e. for the "good guys" to begin their break into Alcatraz, when the film
really starts cooking.  Bay uses a lot of the flashy eye candy visuals he
brought to Bad Boys--lots of blue light, slow motion, quick camera moves and
editing.  But unlike his debut film, here his style comes dangerously close
to being at the expense of coherence.  It's one thing to use the "shaky
cam," but it's quite another to use it while it is fixed in a tight closeup
of something or someone; the resulting chaotic shot is more confusing than
visually arresting.  In spite of this, though, Bay really knows how to stage
exciting action scenes (the aforementioned chase scene, while using every
chase cliche in the book including the infamous fruit cart, is a real
standout) and large--very large--explosions and juggle them seamlessly with
the comedy, which David Weisberg, Douglas S. Cook, and Mark Rosner's lively
script surprisingly has a lot of.
In taking a dive into action, it would be easy to think that Cage
has sold out, abandoning his trademark quirky characters for a more
straightforward, mainstream action hero.  Happily, that's not the case.
Goodspeed is as much an oddball as Cage's usual roles, a neurotic, wimpy
Beatlemaniac who only very gradually toughens up; needless to say, Cage is
perfect in the role.  Connery proves he still is a credible action hero
after all these years though having his character being a former agent of
the British Secret Service seems a bit too gratuitous.  Harris adds layers
of complexity to a not very dimensional role, and Vanessa Marcil (my
favorite General Hospital star) manages to make a lasting impression as
Goodspeed's pregnant girlfriend Carla.  Those not so fortunate actingwise
are Biehn, who is wasted once again as the SEAL leader (isn't it time that
he be cast in a role deserving of his talent?), and William Forsythe's FBI
director is just a rehash of his police chief character in Virtuosity.
The Rock's ads urge you to "get ready to rock."  After seeing this
energetic action-packed ride that truly does "rock," I can't think of better
advice.

Title
Review for Rage: Carrie 2, The (1999)
_The_Rage:_Carrie_2_ (R) 1/2* (out of ****)
Why a sequel to _Carrie_, and why now?  I cannot think of one valid reason
except sheer desperation over at beleaguered MGM/UA, for the retarded
rehash _The_Rage:_Carrie_2_ fails to offer even one compelling reason for
its pathetic existence.
What is compelling, however, is newcomer Emily Bergl, who takes center
stage as Rachel Lang, another alienated teen at Bates High School who, like
one Carrie White some twenty years before her, is blessed (cursed?) with
the ability to move objects with her mind, or telekinesis.  But this
"Carrie" has been given a '90s makeover: this tough-talking Goth chick is
no one's victim, unlike her predecessor.  (She even gets to lose her
virginity.)  Sounds like a thankless task, but Bergl, while no Sissy
Spacek, holds the audience's attention and interest well, infusing Rachel
with the right amount of warmth and vulnerability beneath her rough facade.
But for all the contemporary touches and new plot wrinkles writer Rafael
Moreu and director Katt Shea dress _The_Rage_ in, there's no hiding the
fact that this is just about the same movie that came out in 1976.
Telekinetic girl is picked on by peers.  Peers humiliate her in big social
event (here, a party instead of the prom).  Girl takes violent revenge.
Even the characters are direct analogues to the original.  In addition to
the obvious Rachel = Carrie, Jason London (as Rachel's boyfriend Jessie) is
William Katt's sensitive Tommy; Nancy Allen's uberbitch Chris has been
split into Rachel Blanchard's Monica and Charlotte Ayanna's Tracy;
similarly, John Travolta's blowhard Billy is replaced by Dylan Bruno's Mark
and Zachery Ty Bryan's Eric; and Rachel's religious, institutionalized
mother (J. Smith-Cameron) is an extremely watered-down version of Carrie's
frightening, religious fanatic mother (oh so indelibly played by Piper
Laurie).  Amy Irving, whose Sue Snell was the sole survivor of Carrie's
prom night rampage, not only gets to reprise her character (and her
character's role in the story) here, she also gets to assume the guidance
counselor (read: caring adult) part originally held by Betty Buckley.
With Shea and Moreu so closely following the original, needless to say
there are no surprises in _The_Rage_.  But even without keeping the
original in mind, there's nothing shocking about the film or its climactic
explosion of violence--which can be directly attributed to the attitude
alteration of the protagonist.  Sure, making Rachel far from a meek girl is
a very '90s feminist thing to do, but it also robs her eventual bad
behavior of any resonance.  A lot of the power of _Carrie_'s famous prom
scene is that, while some payback is clearly in order, the fury of her
vengeance comes as a shock, given how weak she had been throughout the
film.  With Rachel, such an intense outburst is a foregone conclusion--and,
accordingly, Shea ups the gore factor in the big climax.  While she comes
up with one especially clever domino-effect scene invoving eyeglasses and a
spear gun, there's nothing particularly frightening or suspenseful as any
given scene in Brian DePalma's original film.
It was undoubtedly the ties to the original _Carrie_ that got _The_Rage_
made, but, ironically, it is that connection that makes the film even worse
that it already is.  Not only does _The_Rage_ simply pale in comparison,
the links Moreu serves up are ridiculously clunky, especially one ill-kept
plot "twist" about the origin of Rachel's powers.  Shea even actually goes
so far as to include excerpts of the first film as random flashbacks for
Sue.  Worst of all, though, these ties seem completely arbitrary, serving
no real purpose other than to fill time and fulfill the meager promise of
the subtitle.  Change a line here and there (and Irving's character name),
and _The_Rage:_Carrie_2_ would be just _The_Rage_--and better for it.
However, no script revisions are necessary for the film to simply be
_The_Rage_; audiences will feel plenty of that once the closing crawl begins.

Title
Review for Hurricane, The (1999)
_The_Hurricane_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        The title of _The_Hurricane_ is not only the nickname of its
main character, boxer Rubin Carter, but also an apt description of the
work of Carter's portrayer, Denzel Washington.  Forceful, dynamic, and
wholly natural, Washington's performance ranks among the very best of
his illustrious career--a turn so strong that it easily smooths over
the rough patches in Norman Jewison's fact-based drama.
        And there a few rough patches, especially in the early stages
of the film.  We get to know Carter by way of one Lesra Martin
(Vicellous Reon Shannon), a young American in Canada, as he reads
Carter's autobiography, _The_Sixteenth_Round_.  The book details
Carter's rise up the middleweight ranks through the moment where it
was cut short in 1966, when he and another man were wrongly convicted
of the fatal shootings of three people.  Racism played a major part in
the conviction, in particular that of one detective (Dan Hedaya) who
had been out to nail Carter since his days as a criminally-inclined
youth.  The events as depicted in the film have some basis in fact,
but the portrayal of this detective doesn't quite ring true, for he is
made into such a simplistically shady character that he appears to
have wandered in from an old silent melodrama (all he's missing is a
twirly moustache).  Similarly over-the-top initially is Shannon's
portrayal of Lesra, who originally hails from a rough American
neighborhood; Shannon lays on Lesra's straight-from-the-ghetto
mannerisms a bit too thick at the start to adequately engage one's
sympathies.
        That changes once the meat of _The_Hurricane_'s story kicks
into gear.  Lesra is so deeply inspired by Carter's book that he
begins a correspondence with the inmate, and Lesra convinces his
Canadian guardians (played by Deborah Kara Unger, John Hannah, and
Liev Schreiber) to help in a campaign to clear Carter's name and free
him from prison.  While the efforts to free The Hurricane is a major
issue in the film, of even greater importance is the relationship
between Carter and Lesra.  Once paired with Washington, Shannon's
awkwardness disappears, and the two successfully make their
characters' friendship into a most involving and touching heart for
the film.
        That is but one example of how greatly Washington elevates
_The_Hurricane_.  Although the film gets off to an imperfect start,
his charisma and rapport with the audience instantly commands the
audience's attention and emotional investment.  When the campaign to
overturn Carter's conviction takes precedence (and as such do the
three Canadians) the film threatens to become one of those "white
people save the black man" films, but Washington's intense presence
prevents that from happening.  While the Canadians do the legwork, one
never forgets that it is Carter who is in charge of his own destiny.
        It's easy to compliment Washington's performance strictly on
the basis of its force and focus (and how could one not, when his
commitment to the role is physically manifested by his sculpted
boxer's physique?), but what makes his work especially memorable are
his more subdued moments.  In addition to the warm scenes with Lesra,
particularly noteworthy are the couple of scenes where Carter's
internal struggles are spelled out by having Carter being torn between
two other Carters--an angry one and a weak one.  The device is a
variation of the time-worn gimmick of having and an angel on one
shoulder and a devil on another, but it is completely effective, for
Washington is able to convincingly convey all facets of Carter's
personality--a feat he also manages when just playing the singular
Carter.
        Washington's deft handling of the tri-Carter device is
analagous to the relationship between the actor and all of
_The_Hurricane_: while the whole undertaking is of a conventional
mold, Washington is able to make it into something more.  Granted,
Jewison, with the aid of screenwriters Armyan Bernstein and Dan
Gordon, do put enough pressure on the right emotional buttons
themselves, and Carter's true story is indeed one gripping and
inspiring enough that the film could have very well worked without
Washington.  However, one cannot imagine it working nearly as well
with someone else in the lead.  _The_Hurricane_ is not a piece of
cinematic greatness, but on Washington's mighty shoulders, it often
flirts with becoming one.

Title
Review for Where the Heart Is (2000)
For all the surface eccentricities of the story, which derives from
Billie Letts' novel of the same name, Matt Williams' film follows a
simple course where a good-hearted woman is placed in adverse
circumstances and then slowly but surely triumphs over them.  Along the
way, she even helps others triumph over their own adversities.  Sound
familiar?  It should--this is the rubric for the genre that I've come to
call the "Oprah movie": slick, well-meaning, female-empowering, and just
about as exciting and suspenseful as the middle label implies.  (Not
surprisingly, Letts' novel was an Oprah book club selection.)  Such films
are hard to hate--and, indeed, _Where_the_Heart_Is_ is likable--but
they're just as difficult to get worked up over in the positive sense. 
The individual elements are put together with care, but they are also
assembled with an obvious calculation--lending the film a
less-than-authentic gloss.
Portman, on the other hand, remains natural and genuine throughout.  But
her "realness" is constricted by the conventions, much like in
_Anywhere_but_Here_, her last film--and another entry in the Oprah genre.
 She's too young and vibrant a performer to pigeonhole herself in films
like _Where_the_Heart_Is_, which are precious and nice but hardly the
most interesting and effective uses of her talent--not to mention not the
most interesting and rewarding films to sit through.

Title
Review for Mod Squad, The (1999)
My memories of TV super-producer Aaron Spelling's original late '60s-early
'70s action series are fuzzy at best.  I don't think I've ever seen a full
episode, but I do recall the image of three young, cool cops running
together in pursuit of a perp.  I may not know much, but I know this: the
new big screen revival of the series sure as hell isn't how I remember it.
The new _Mod_Squad_ is a study in how a surefire idea gets botched in the
execution.  The premise of having a group of three young ex-crooks--Julie
Barnes (Claire Danes), Linc Hayes (Omar Epps), and Pete Cochrane (Giovanni
Ribisi)--do undercover police work is a concept ripe for updating.  But any
high hopes are just about immediately let down, then wiped out completely
in one early scene where the three talk in a car.  Sounds simple enough,
but Danes, Epps, and Ribisi show no group chemistry whatsoever.  Some squad
this is--and for reasons known only to Silver and co-writers Stephen Kay
and Kate Lanier, they spend most of the film in individual plot threads.
Individually, though, these actors have problems of their own.  Danes is a
good enough sport, but she appears somewhat ill-at-ease in this, her first
popcorn movie.  Ribisi's Pete is only slightly more intelligent than his
character in _The_Other_Sister_, and his portrayal is every bit as grating.
 The only one who appears the slightest bit in place is Epps, but he
literally runs through the film.  In fact, those running scenes are all
that in-over-his-head director Scott Silver (whose only other film was the
low-budget indie drama _johns_) tries to pass off as action in this talky,
terrible film.  After the one-two failed franchise punch of this and
_The_Rage:_Carrie_2_, MGM is once again left to wait for James Bond to
rescue them with his next, certain-to-be-a-blockbuster adventure, due in
November.

Title
Review for Replacements, The (2000)
_The_Replacements_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
        Going into _The_Replacements_, one knows exactly what one is
going to see: a team of misfit football players comically getting their
act together for the big game, during which they enjoy their moment of
glory.  And, indeed, the only real surprise of this comedy is just how
content director Howard Deutch and writer Vince McKewin is with strictly
following expectations, not serving up one single deviation from the
given formula.
        It's for that very reason that I wouldn't be surprised if
_The_Replacements_ became a substantial late-summer hit; everything about
it is calibrated just so for broad audience "satisfaction."  Consider,
first, the characters that make up the replacement squad for the
fictional Washington Sentinels.  There is Daniel Bateman (Jon Favreau), a
violence-prone cop who speaks in a growl--leading to lots of easy
physical gags involving his penchant for tackling.  There's Clifford
Franklin (Orlando Jones), the wisecracking black guy.  Not to be outdone
are the big, tough black guys (Faizon Love and Michael "Bear" Taliferro),
who butt heads with the token Asian (Ace Yonamine)--who also happens to
be as large as a sumo wrestler, paving the way for the obvious fat jokes.
 Rhys Ifans' placekicker Nigel is basically a replay of his popular
character in _Notting_Hill_, a scruffy, layabout Welshman.  But with all
these caricatures, there has to be a straight man, and here he's in the
form of a cliché--quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), who cannot
quite live down choking in the crucial final moments of his last college
game.
        Will Coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) whip these boys into
shape?  Can Shane find redemption and deliver when put in a similarly
nailbiting situation?  Will there be a crucial injury before the last
game is through?  Should there be any doubt?  But before
_The_Replacements_ reaches its foregone conclusion, there is the expected
stream of hijinks.  The replacements get into a bar brawl with the
on-strike players.  Head cheerleader Annabelle (the warm and winning
Brooke Langton, who deserves more big-league roles) must preside over a
pep squad trained in a different type of spirit-raising--lapdancing. 
Clifford leads his teammates in a rousing electric slide to "I Will
Survive."  Yes, these set pieces are engaging enough to hold the
attention.  What they aren't, however, are original or distinctive enough
to hold long in the memory.
        Which is _The_Replacements_'s ultimate failing--the film is
competently done (though a few of the actors, namely Favreau, are
constricted by one-note roles), but there's nothing to distinguish it
from the pack of sports comedies and feel-good underdog stories.  Perhaps
that's exactly what the masses are asking for, but it's discouraging that
Deutch and his crew didn't even try to bring anything more to the tired
game.

Title
Review for Astronaut's Wife, The (1999)
_The_Astronaut's_Wife_ (R) ** (out of ****)
        New Line opted to not screen in advance for critics this
once-high-profile sci-fi thriller, but the film is far from the flat-out
disaster that decision would imply.  In fact, there is a lot of merit on
display here, not the least of which is that of the terrific lead
performance of Charlize Theron, who once again proves to be the real deal
actingwise.  She plays the title character, whose world becomes
increasingly nighmarish after her husband (Johnny Depp) returns from an
accident-plagued space mission.  Something is not quite right with him,
and neither are his unborn twins that she is carrying.  For a first-time
director, Rand Ravich displays a strong sense of visual style as well as
a command of mood, for an atmosphere of dread is ominously felt
throughout the picture.
        However, it turns out that Ravich has no idea what exactly the dread is
leading up to.  He is also a first-time writer, and his inexperience
shows.  All the stylish visuals in the world cannot hide the fact that
the film's story simply does not add up, leaving tons more questions than
answers in its incredibly unsatisfying wrapup.  One such question is that
of the miscast Depp's (alas, "evil" is beyond this good actor's range)
involvement in this picture, other than the obvious (i.e., an easy
paycheck).  Theron and Ravich's style keeps one watching, but by the
conclusion one may wish one hadn't.

Title
Review for Your Friends & Neighbors (1998)
_Your_Friends_&_Neighbors_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
_Your_Friends_&_Neighbors_, writer-director Neil LaBute's follow-up to his
incendiary debut, _In_the_Company_of_Men_, does not have the sensational
"men are monsters" hook of the previous film, but it is every bit as
caustic--and the effect is nearly as fascinating.  This "modern immorality
tale," as the ads state, is a scathing, brutally funny, and ultimately
disturbing satire of sexual and social mores.
The six central characters' names rhyme: Mary, Barry, Terri, Cheri, Cary,
and Jerry.  But any point to this bit of cutesy preciousness is moot, for
the characters' names (or, for that matter, the city name) are never spoken
throughout the entire film, adding a discomforting intimacy--it's as if we,
the audience, are witnessing our "friends" and "neighbors."  Why the
quotes?  Because while these six interact within the same overlapping
households and social circles under the guise of friendship, what they do
is distinctly unneighborly.  Amy Brenneman and Aaron Eckhart's characters
are unhappily married; he isn't getting the job done in bed, and he'd much
rather pleasure himself, anyway.  Brenneman (since the character names
assigned in the end credits are never used, neither will I) seeks something
"different" in the arms of one of Eckhart's best "friends", Ben Stiller,
who himself is having trouble with his live-in girlfriend, the "unfeminine"
Catherine Keener.  So it is not terribly surprising when Keener, who hates
Stiller's habit of talking during the act, seeks--and finds--silent sex
with another woman, Nastassja Kinski.  Kinski is an "artist's assistant" at
a gallery that is visited at various points by nearly each individual
member of the group, which is rounded out by the brash, egotistical,
misogynistic Jason Patric.
It sounds like a mess, and it is; there's no rhythm or recognizable
structure to the entire film, jumping between characters and situations in
seemingly random fashion.  Ironically, though, LaBute's fractured style
heightens the reality of the events, which roughly assemble with the
imperfect coherence of strung-together memories.  Nonetheless, the jumble
is jarring, but the rough mosaic is made consistently engrossing by
LaBute's acidly comic dialogue, the intriguingly amoral (and well-rounded)
characters, and the crack acting ensemble.  
The clear standout in the cast is Patric.  While his character is an even
more extreme version of Eckhart's notorious Chad in _Men_, Patric's
earnestness prevents him from becoming a complete cartoon--which makes him
more all the more frightening.  Speaking of Eckhart, he is barely
recognizable here--and completely convincing--as slick, confident Chad's
complete opposite: fat, unkempt, and completely emasculated.  Brenneman may
betray her husband, but she makes the audience never lose sight of the
purehearted loneliness that drives her character to act in such a way; the
same, but to a lesser degree, goes for Keener, whose character is much
harder around the edges; and Stiller.  If one character remains a cipher,
it is Kinski's, who is mainly seen as an aloof object of desire (she is,
however, given some emotional gumption in her final scene).
As funny as _Your_Friends_&_Neighbors_ often is, I wouldn't exactly call
it an _entertaining_ film.  As surreally exaggerated as some of the
characters and situations appear to be, the emotional fallout is painfully
genuine.  Long after the film is over, you may find yourself in deep
discussion about _Your_Friends_&_Neighbors_ with your friends and
neighbors--at least, those whom you _believe_ to be your friends and
neighbors.  (opens August 19)

Title
Review for Just the Ticket (1999)
_Just_the_Ticket_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
Andy and Andie.  Execs at MGM/UA must have been falling all over
themselves with self-satisfaction when someone came up with the
ever-so-precious idea of pairing the homophonically-named Mr. Garcia and
Ms. MacDowell.  In the right vehicle, the two could possibly be as cute
as the pairing of their perfectly-matched first names. 
_Just_the_Ticket_, however, is not that vehicle.
The fact that writer-director Richard Wenk's basic story is wholly
unoriginal is the least of the film's problems.  Actually, that fact
isn't so much a problem as it is a slight annoyance.  It's another one of
those ne'er-do-well-straightens-up-for-the-love-of-a-right-woman stories,
with ticket scalper Gary Starke (Garcia) attempting one last
score--selling tickets to a sold-out papal mass in New York--before
settling into an honest living to win the affections of his fed-up true
love, aspiring chef Linda Paliski (MacDowell).  There wouldn't be a movie
without some types of complication, and the ones Wenk comes up with
aren't exactly new, either.  Among those Gary must contend with: Casino,
a hotshot newcomer moving in on his scalping turf; Linda's impending move
to France; and, as an added afterthought, Linda's _other_ boyfriend, Alex
(Chris Lemmon).
Garcia and MacDowell are likable enough performers that with those
elements in place, _Just_the_Ticket_ could have been a diverting, if
formulaic, trifle.  Yet it isn't.  While the fundamentals of his story
are not to blame, Wenk's execution certainly is.  Garcia is game, but
Wenk's listless direction saps him of all his energy; the film literally
plods to a predictable pace, alternating scenes of Gary selling tickets
with him wooing Linda.  Not helping matters is Wenk's less-than-sparkling
dialogue.  Not only do the one-liners and Gary-Linda repartee fall flat,
so do the straight-faced lines in general--a sure death knell for a film
as talky as this one.
The ineffectiveness of _Just_the_Ticket_ can simply be chalked up to the
fact that it's an astonishingly uninteresting piece of work.  There's
nothing particularly memorable about the story, the characters, or the
performances; I just about forgot each image or word as soon as it left
the screen.  The makers of _Just_the_Ticket_ undoubtedly set out to make
a light entertainment, but instead they've come up with something a bit
moreso--a film that's completely inert.

Title
Review for Cube (1997)
Wanna make a science fiction thriller, but don't have the money for
big-budget effects?  Then turn to math, as have neophyte feature filmmakers
Vincenzo Natali and Darren Aronofsky for their films _Cube_ and _Pi_,
respectively.
_Cube_'s story is fairly thin: six strangers (Nicole deBoer, Nicky
Guadagni, David Hewlett, Andrew Miller, Wayne Robson, and Maurice Dean
Wint) wake up to find themselves trapped in a 14' by 14' cube, with doors
on each wall, the ceiling, and the floor.  This cube, as it turns out, is
simply one of many in a much larger structure, and the six try to find
their way out of the labyrinthian prison--that is, if they can crack the
mathematical code that will lead them to the exit.  With a piddly budget of
only $365,000 (in Canadian dollars), _Cube_ is more visually inventive than
films that cost twenty times more.  Natali shot _Cube_ on a single 14'x14'
set, made to look like many different cubes through the use of
different-colored lighting; the effect is entirely convincing.  But for all
his creative ingenuity, Natali and co-writers Andre Bijelic and Graeme
Manson could have come up with a stronger script.  As claustrophobic as the
setting is, the film is remarkably unscary.  The queasy promise of the
chilling opening scene (in which an unfortunate prisoner is sliced and
diced into cube steak by a booby trap) soon dissipates with the
introduction of the flat, uninvolving characters, who predictably come at
odds because of personality conflicts, anxiety, insanity, or any
combination of the three.  Too much time is spent on these interpersonal
conflicts and too little on the mechanical ones, i.e. evading traps like
those in the prologue.  Adding to the narrative tedium are the often
laughably amateurish turns by the justly unknown cast.
Aronofsky had even less--only $60,000--to work with on _Pi_, but he
achieves the overpowering atmosphere of fear and paranoia that Natali and
company obviously strived for in _Cube_.  Aronofsky, Sean Gullette, and
Eric Watson's story is sometimes confounding; it details an math genius's
(Gullette) rapid descent into madness when he finally discovers a
long-obsessed-over mathematical pattern to the stock market, Jewish
mysticism, and, it appears, the universe itself.  But story seems to be a
moot point in Aronofsky's frenzied vision; the intent is to create a living
nightmare of psychological horror, and he succeeds most unsettlingly
through his use of stark, sometimes grainy, black and white photography;
frenetic editing; and a pulsating electronic score.  Many films purport to
be something "unlike you've ever seen"; few films actually deliver.  The
stylish and scary _Pi_ is one of those few.

Title
Review for Species II (1998)
Despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects, 1995's original Species
was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese, from the writing to the feeble
performances.  So, coming from such B-grade roots, its sequel's stunning
ineptitude is not terribly surprising, yet at the same time it is.  It
would not have been difficult at all for the people behind Species II to
top the hokey original, yet they have somehow managed to fabricate
something just as bad, if not even worse.
Something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in
Species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this Earth after eating a body
part from the exploded alien/human hybrid Sil--is never entered into
(perhaps that was left
for Species III--though I'm not giving away anything when I say that this
installment has an open back door of its own). The alien fun and games
begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from Mars
inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien DNA that
eventually infects the mission captain, Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard, late
of CBS's short-lived soap of a few years back, Central Park West/CPW).
This alien DNA is not identical to that which created the original film's
Sil, but it's close enough, and upon arrival on Earth Patrick is mating
like crazy, engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find.
 Meanwhile, scientist Dr. Laura Baker (the returning Marg Helgenberger) has
created a clone of Sil named Eve (Natasha Henstridge again) for research
purposes.  It doesn't take long for Eve to sense another alien presence,
which send her libido into hyperdrive.  It's up to Laura and her former
partner, bounty hunter Press Lennox (Michael Madsen, another returnee); and
Patrick's uninfected shipmate Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson) to find
Patrick before the in-heat Eve does.
"This isn't The X-Files, goddammit!" exclaims one character in the early
going.  In terms of quality, he's absolutely right, but he's also wrong.
The new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes
Patrick's pupils to dilate once he's infected.  Looks and sounds an awful
lot like The X-Files's "black cancer" to me. But that's not the only source
director Peter Medak and writer Chris Brancato steal from.  Species was
already a ripoff of Alien, but Medak makes the cribbing much more blatant
than the original's director, Roger Donaldson, did.  Human Patrick is given
a tongue that also has a tongue within itself, and his alien form more
closely resembles the Alien than Eve's alien body (which ironically was
designed by Alien designer H.R. Giger).  A large alien hive that our heros
douse with a substance fired from large guns?  Aliens sans flamethrowers.
The visual effects were by far the best thing about Species, and the
sequel's effects crew at Steve Johnson's XFX Inc. keeps that high-quality
tradition alive; no cheap-looking Lost in Space CGI here.  After the
effects, the original's best asset was the fresh presence of Henstridge.
However, Medak and Brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for
this installment.  At one point she's called on to play alien "empath" ŕ la
Forest Whitaker in the original, but for most of the duration she's holed
up in a glass cell.  By the time the big breakout so prominently featured
in the trailer actually takes place, the film is well into its home stretch.
So the rest of the time we are treated to Patrick, played with little zest
by Lazard.  One problem with the first film was that the deadly, horny, but
innocent-at-heart Sil was too sympathetic; no such problem with Patrick, who
comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control.  The rest
of the cast also fails to add much, but the writing can be faulted for
that.  Helgenberger and Madsen go through the motions, but they are already
hampered by the clichéd development that somewhere between the two films,
the once-linked Laura and Press stopped getting along.  Williamson suffers
the worst indignity.  He tries his best to enliven the token
African-American role, but how can anyone recite insulting, derivative
lines such as "I'm gonna get African on someone's ass" and not appear
ridiculous?
But Species II's worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of
work. At least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably
awful performances by the otherwise fine actors Ben Kingsley and Whitaker,
and the sight of Helgenberger's character performing fellatio on Madsen's,
for a start.  But the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at
all, let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach
the camp level.  For all the blood and gore, nudity, and sex thrown in,
Species II is, quite simply, a vapid bore.

Title
Review for Scream 2 (1997)
Rushed into production mere months after the release of the blockbuster
original, Scream 2 appears, in theory, to be no different than the quickie
slasher sequels it lampoons.  But Wes Craven's smart, self-referential
Scream was unlike any other splatterfest, and now that film has developed
into a most intriguing and unconventional horror franchise with the release
of this followup--an exciting and wonderfully witty romp that manages to
add some luster to the much-maligned concept of "sequel."
Scream 2 is an even more satiric film than its predecessor, and this tone
is established quickly with the opening scene.  Windsor College students
Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett) and Phil Stevens (Omar Epps) attend a sneak
preview of the new horror movie Stab, which, as it turns out, is based on
the Windsboro, California murder spree depicted in the original film.  So
we see a hilariously letter-perfect recreation of Scream's now-classic
prologue, with a short-wigged Heather Graham assuming Drew Barrymore's role
as a Jiffy Pop-making blonde being terrorized over the phone by a
movie-obsessed psycho.  The restaging of the scene in and of itself would
be sufficiently satiric for most writers, but screenwriter Kevin Williamson
(who also penned the original) goes the extra mile, having Maureen vocally
mock its conventions ("Star-69 his ass!").  As smart and fun as Scream was,
it certainly had its share of cheesy aspects, and it is refreshing--not to
mention surprising and brave--to see Williamson and Craven poke fun at
their original film to such mercilessly hilarious effect.  This
movie-based-on-the-first-movie-within-its-sequel conceit, which is
revisited sporadically throughout the film (a highlight is Owen Wilson's
dead-on impresonation of Skeet Ulrich's slacker "cool" in a later scene),
perfectly embodies Scream 2's overall attitude--self-aware and more than
willing to make fun of itself.
Two years have passed since the Woodsboro murders, and heroine Sidney
Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now a theatre major at Windsor, and film geek
Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) is--natch--a film student there (you would
think he would be rejected, given his extensive qualifications).  Yet while
the scenery and atmosphere around her are different, her luck is not, and
before long she once again finds herself stalked by a killer in a screaming
ghoul costume.  Soon reentering the picture are ever-vain tabloid TV
reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), who is even more of an egomaniac
after writing a bestseller on the murders (upon which Stab is based); and
ever-dopey Dewey Riley (David Arquette), now-former Woodsboro deputy, who
comes to Windsor to offer Sidney some support.  The rest of Scream 2's
story has been a closely guarded secret, and Dimension Films has gone so
far as to issue a letter urging press to not divulge too many plot
developments.  After seeing the film, it is easy to understand why.  While
the film does settle into a none-too-surprising slasher rhythm, Williamson
cooks up a few surprising plot twists, intelligently incorporating
references to the original to propel the sequel's storyline.  Also, true to
"the rules" of a sequel, he and Craven cook up some elaborately inventive
suspense scenes that set the audience on edge.
As effective as the new scare scenes are, there is no shock sequence in
Scream 2 that matches the original film's chilling prologue, but that is of
little consequence when its humorous side--what makes the Scream movies so
special--is stronger than ever.  Amid all the carnage and screaming,
Williamson and Craven's wit is as sharp as ever, giving dim Dewey overdone
"cool" theme music (directly lifted from Hans Zimmer's score for John Woo's
Broken Arrow) and throwing in barbs at everything from pop culture fixtures
like Sandra Bullock and TV's Friends to "issues" such as the influence of
violent movies and African-Americans' traditional non-presence in horror
movies.  But, of course, the most recurring topic is that of movie sequels.
 Simply bashing them (which the film does to ample degree) is easy, but
Williamson and Craven are a bit more ambitious--attacking their inherent
cheesiness while at the same time embracing it, steering events in some
quintessentially "only in a sequel" turns with tongue planted firmly in cheek.
An ongoing discussion in Scream 2 revolves around whether or not there
has been a movie sequel that is superior to the original.  I would not be
surprised if in Scream 3 (which is all but a foregone conclusion at this
point), we hear the fresh, funny, and frightening Scream 2 mentioned as
proof in the positive.

Review for World Is Not Enough, The (1999)
_The_World_Is_Not_Enough_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Looking at all the hoopla surrounding the latest James Bond adventure
starring Pierce Brosnan, _The_World_Is_Not_Enough_, it's funny to note
that the announcement of Brosnan as the fifth actor to play Agent 007 was
met with a raised eyebrow.  The former Remington Steele was past his
prime, detractors said, and his name did not guarantee an audience. 
Flash forward four years, and Brosnan has proven to be the most popular
Bond since Sean Connery, with his first two efforts, 1995's _GoldenEye_
and 1997's _Tomorrow_Never_Dies_, becoming the highest-grossing 007
adventures in history.  But while those films were both reasonably
diverting entertainments, what they certainly weren't were classics of
its genre (though _GoldenEye_'s deliciously sadomasochistic villainess,
Xenia Onatopp, is one for the hall of fame).
For the first few minutes of _World_, the 19th installment of MGM's
long-running action franchise, it looks as if Brosnan may have found his
defining entry in the series, along the lines of Sean Connery's
_Goldfinger_ and Roger Moore's _The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_.  The traditional
opening action sequence--which, for once, actually sets up the film's
main plot--is exhilarating, going from a daring escape from an office to
a rip-roaring speedboat chase then finally to an exploding hot air
balloon as Bond pursues a female sniper (_Il_Postino_ sex bomb Maria
Grazia Cucinotta).  After a very clever visual segue, the familiar
silhouetted nude female dancers do their thing to what is easily the best
title tune of the Brosnan Bond era, performed by Garbage.
However, to use the easy pun, _The_World_Is_Not_Enough_ truly is not. 
After an opening that effectively sets up the secret agent's
mission--protect oil heiress Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) from terrorist
Renard (Robert Carlyle), who had kidnapped her years earlier--director
Michael Apted plays things formula-safe.  (This is especially
disappointing considering that it had been hoped, and to some degree been
anticipated, that the drama and documentary filmmaker would bring
something fresh to the series.)  Granted, James Bond films are all about
formula, but it's hard to get worked up over by-the-numbers ski stunts
when, contrary to the famous line, somebody has done it better--Bond
himself, in fact, in the film from which that song came,
_The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_.  Ditto the submarine-set finale, which evokes an
even stronger sense of déjŕ vu considering that the last Bond film,
_Tomorrow_Never_Dies_, also ended in the water.  The one avenue for
something original--Renard's ever-increasing physical strength and
invulnerability caused by a bullet lodged in his brain--is never
exploited to its fullest potential.
As irksome as the lingering sense of unoriginality is, what makes this
film the hands-down worst of Brosnan's 007 outings can be summed up in
two words: Denise Richards.  In all her previous films, Richards has
already proven to be an attractive screen presence with little talent
underneath.  But familiarity with her unimpressive body of work (as
opposed to her impressive body) does not quite prepare one for her
portrayal of, ahem, nuclear physicist Dr. Christmas Jones--a performance
of Elizabeth Berkley proportions, even when considering the undemanding,
credibility-stretching acting standards of Bond movies.  It's a given
that Richards fails to convince as anyone who's failed a science class,
let alone a scientist; but she fails to be believable as a
flesh-and-blood person, spouting off scientific jargon so robotically
that one wonders how much of the film's huge budget went to her
teleprompters and cue cards.
It's a shame that MGM focused its hype machine on her rather than
Marceau, who is everything Richards isn't.  She is a strong match for
Bond (and Brosnan) in every way, a formidable mix of acting ability,
charisma, beauty, and sex appeal.  Richards may get all the va-va-voom
costumes (such as hotpants, tank tops, and that staple of all nuclear
physicists' travel wardrobes, tight evening gowns), but Marceau scorches
with a simple glance, regardless of what she may be wearing (which, for
the record, mostly consists of robes and seductively draped bedsheets). 
Richards may fit the physical mold of a traditional "Bond girl," but
Marceau is a hot-blooded, full-bodied Bond _woman_--and therein lies all
the difference.
Based on the early grosses, however, _The_World_ appears to be enough
for audiences, who are poised to make this Brosnan's most financially
successful Bond to date--which is just as well, as I suppose, for the
supersuave Brosnan fits the role like a glove, and I would not mind
seeing him in at least one more globe-trotting yarn.  But if the Bond
creative team doesn't get a much-needed dose of creative inspiration any
time soon, the "James Bond will return" tag becomes less of a reassurance
than a threat.

Title
Review for Better Place, A (1997)
DVD Presentation: *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        Teen violence has been an unfortunate staple of news headlines in recent
years, but unlike the usual case with of-the-moment, hot-button, real-life
issues, there haven't been many films released that deal with the subject. The
key word there is "released," for such films haven't necessarily not been made.
Case in point, Tim Blake Nelson's much-embattled _O_, or Vincent Pereira's
_A_Better_Place_, which after first making the festival rounds in 1997 is now
getting a general release on DVD through Synapse Films. While much time has
passed since the film started shooting in 1995, its exploration of teen
alienation and angst is just as, if not more, timely given certain events that
have taken place during the intervening years.
        Ironically brought together by their common isolation are Barret (Robert
DiPatri) and Ryan (Eion Bailey). Barret is the new kid in town, having moved
from California to "a better place" in the East with his mother not long after
the sudden death of his father. As is the case with any new student at school,
Barret isn't exactly welcomed by his peers--save Ryan, who comes to his defense
on the first day of class. A friendship develops, but it gradually becomes clear
that their spirits are less kindred than initially appeared. Unlike Barret, the
bitter Ryan is an outcast less by circumstance than by choice, a reflection on
the deeper differences in their personalities, fundamental beliefs, and the life
experiences that they have had--or, in the emotionally-scarred Ryan's case, the
life experiences he has had to endure.
        Relationships--not only Barret and Ryan's, but also those between them
and other students, not to mention that between Ryan and his overbearing aunt
(Molly Castelloe)--are in perpetual shift, but what remains constant is the
looming threat of violence. The dominant image on _A_Better_Place_'s cover art
may be that of Ryan brandishing a gun, but the film is more concerned with
what's suggested by the smaller one of Barret looking away in shock--that is,
the horror of such outbursts of aggression. The instances of violence in the
film are briefly seen but no less brutal or unsettling, even in early scenes
such as a locker room fight.
        This is not to say, however, that Pereira is simply out to shock the
audience; more prominent on his mind is how such terrible events can occur. He
wisely sidesteps making any blanket statements or theories about the general
social condition, but in the character of Ryan he paints a convincing portrait
of how a youth can be pushed to such extreme action. He may be a loner and a bit
surly, but he's no loser nor an outwardly deviant individual; in fact, he is
intelligent and very well-spoken, and how logically he justifies his thoughts
are perhaps more disturbing than any bloodshed in the film. Bailey, who has gone
on to bigger projects since, leads the film's generally strong set of
performances with his electric turn as Ryan, nailing down the character's creepy
charisma.
        _A_Better_Place_ isn't a perfect film; the character of Ryan's bitchy
aunt is thinly written (and a bit too brittlely played by Castelloe), and
certain plot points are too obviously telegraphed (for instance, a fairly early
and none-too-subtle throwaway line spelling out a way to get a gun). But given
the obstacles he and his crew had going into production--namely, the limitations
of a miniscule ($40,000) budget and a rushed shooting schedule--that Pereira was
able to make a smart and affecting (not to mention beautifully photographed)
film about a particularly difficult subject is a measure of his ability as a
filmmaker.
        However, Pereira is quick (and rather refreshingly at that) to point up
any shortcomings he observes on the DVD's audio commentary track. Being
"historian" of Kevin Smith's (who executive produced) View Askew Productions,
Pereira is a veritable veteran when it comes to commentaries, and he makes a
smooth transition to the central position, imparting a lot of insight about the
difficult production alongside DiPatri and his co-stars Brian Lynch (who also
served as associate producer) and Joseph Cassese. Anecdotal bits take a back
seat to more technical information about the making of the film, but that
doesn't necessarily mean this is a (to use an occasional criticism of Pereira's
contributions on other DVD commentaries) dry listen. He speaks with enthusiasm
and passion about this project, as do the others on track, and their genuine
camaraderie comes through.
        What also comes through in watching this presentation of _A_Better_Place
_is the amount of work Pereira and various other technicians put in to make this
disc the best presentation the feature has ever seen. The image quality is
gorgeous, and not just by the standards of a film shot on 16mm stock; with
certain unavoidable exceptions (a shot that was botched in camera; some others
that recovered from a rough work print), the picture is that clean. More
impressive is the remixed 5.1 Dolby sound mix; to get an idea of just how, check
out the special feature that allows one to compare the new mix to the original
mono track. This feature, while audio-centric, also gives an idea of how
dramatic the visual clean-up is; the selection of eight understandably deleted
scenes (viewable with optional commentary by Pereira) offers another glimpse of
this.
        Rounding out the presentation--though it's likely to be the first thing
anyone who buys _A_Better_Place_ will watch--are three separate video
introductions to the film by Smith and Scott Mosier (who also executive
produced). Featuring Smith's trademark quick wit and some nice deadpan moments
from Mosier as they lavish praise on the film, these segments are all amusing
(though it must be said that the first introduction comes dangerously close to
wearing out its welcome; the other two are shorter and more effective for it).
That said, these bits weren't really needed, for _A_Better_Place_ makes a
convincing case for its merit all on its own.

Title
Review for Corruptor, The (1999)
Hong Kong action superstar Chow Yun-Fat is one of the most dynamic,
charismatic screen presences to ever hit the screen in any country.  Yet
for some reason, American filmmakers have yet to figure out how to properly
use him.  While his stateside debut, last year's _The_Replacement_Killers_,
was an enjoyable-enough no-brainer with energy to spare, it barely
scratched the surface of Chow's talent.  The same can be said of his
latest, even more disappointing American vehicle, James Foley's talky and
slow _The_Corruptor_.
Chow is allowed to smile a bit more in _The_Corruptor_ than he did in
_The_Replacement_Killers_, but the storyline is a bit more dour.  Chow
plays NYPD officer Nick Chen, who is in charge of policing the Chinatown
beat, where he has cemented ties with a dastardly crime boss (Ric Young).
When the peace is broken by a turf war, Chen is partnered with an
idealistic naif by the name of Danny Wallace (Mark Wahlberg).
This sets the stage for a serious exploration of loyalty and honor, which
New Line is eager to boast in the publicity materials as being similar to
Chow's collaborations with Woo.  Thematically that may be the case, but
despite the serious underpinnings of his work, Woo has always allowed
himself some fun in the execution.  _The_Corruptor_, on the other hand, is
earnest and sullen all the way through, and progresses at a snail's pace.
When the scenes of talking heads give way to action--which does not happen
often enough--there's no sense of urgency or excitement to the sequences.
Foley and writer Robert Pucci display little to no real interest in the
action element of this "action drama."  They seem more concerned with the
"drama," which is a problem when there are unnecessary, uninteresting plot
threads such as a red-herring plot involving dead prostitutes and Wallace's
relationship with his compulsive gambler father (Brian Cox).
The presence of Chow should have given _The_Corruptor_ a shot of
adrenaline, yet it doesn't.  Anyone who has seen Chow's Hong Kong
vehicles--especially his legendary collaborations with John Woo--can easily
see why the man is often revered as a god: he naturally exudes an
effortless, awe-inspiring cool.  Ironically, I think it's exactly this
trait that gets in the way of American filmmakers.  They are seemingly so
caught up in their awe of him that they tend to take him too seriously.
And anyone whose seen Chow's star-making films also knows that his sense of
humor--his defiant _refusal_ to take himself completely seriously--is what
makes him such an appealing actor.
Take that away, and one is left with a different kind of "cool"--as in the
uncharacteristically cold and rather aloof Chow seen in
_The_Replacement_Killers_ and now _The_Corruptor_.  In light of that, it's
easy to see why Chow has yet to catch on (and, with this film, continue to
have trouble catching on) with general American audiences.  That's
unfortunate not only because Chow and his ardent HK-era fans deserve
better, but the stateside masses deserve to see just how magnetic a
star--and how talented an actor--Chow Yun-Fat truly is.

Title
Review for Con Air (1997)
Don Simpson may be dead, but former producing partner Jerry
Bruckheimer keeps the old Simpson/Bruckheimer spirit alive with Con Air, a
loud, superslick, ultramacho, and all-around entertaining blast of action
and excitement.
A buffed-up Nicolas Cage stars as Cameron Poe, a decorated Army
Ranger who lands in prison after killing a thug in a drunken brawl.  Years
pass, and the paroled Poe is one flight away from a new life with his wife
(Monica Potter) and the young daughter (Landry Allbright) he has yet to
meet.  However, the flight he boards is one reserved for the transport of a
number of the nation's most dangerous felons.  Under the leadership of Cyrus
"The Virus" Grissom (John Malkovich), the convicts hijack the plane, and
it's up to Cameron, with the ground support of U.S. Marshal Larkin (John
Cusack), to save the day.
Con Air marks the first production of the Simpson-less Jerry
Bruckheimer Productions, but most, if not all, of the hallmarks of
Simpson/Bruckheimer productions are here.  Helming the feature is a director
hired to make things look good (commercial director Simon West, best known
for the spot where a boy is sucked into a Pepsi bottle); there are
explosions and gunplay galore; the musical score (by Mark Mancina and Trevor
Rabin) is loud and pounding; and, most of all, nary a trace of estrogen in
evidence.  There is a female guard aboard the flight (played by Rachel
Ticotin), but the character is of little consequence; the same can be said
of Potter's role as Cameron's wife, which is even smaller than Vanessa
Marcil's analogous bit role in the final S/B production, The Rock.
This formula can grow tiresome without some refreshing tweaks, and
that is where the actors, with the help of screenwriter Scott Rosenberg (who
also wrote--of all things--Beautiful Girls), come in.  Cage continues to
carve out a niche in the action market without sacrificing his penchant for
quirky roles.  He is more of a traditional kick-ass action hero here than he
was in The Rock, but his Cameron Poe is still an oddball--trailer park white
trash with a hint of Elvis (complete with matching accent and politeness
streak).  Also not sacrificing any eccentricity is Malkovich, whose Cyrus
the Virus is the type of effete, cerebral, and decadent character he's been
playing for years in less commercial projects (most recently The Portrait of
a Lady).  Steve Buscemi plays one of the most bizarre characters of the
bunch, notorious mass murderer Garland Greene.  As written by Rosenberg and
played by Buscemi, "The Mangler" is a deliciously ironic character, the con
with the most notorious rap sheet and reputation--who is also, as it turns
out, perhaps the most innocuous of the bunch.  One con who is not fleshed
out as well as he could have been is Ving Rhames's Diamond Dog, a black
militant.  Cusack's stressed-out Larkin is the straightest character in the
piece, but he brings his own sense of vitality to the role.  I'm all for
interesting, unique characters, but one I could have done without is Sally
Can't Dance, a flamboyantly gay, cross-dressing con played to the camp hilt
by Renoly.  Though his presence does set up one of the funnier throwaway
gags in the film, the character is a somewhat of a drag, a superfluous
flourish in a film already filled to the brim with eccentrics.
Bruckheimer films get the job done as far as action and pyrotechnics
(for which the audience sees the film in the first place), but they tend to
come up short is in the area of emotion.  Any attempt at anything
approaching serious drama, especially in a film as loud and frenetic as
this, cannot help but seem like an afterthought.  Even worse, these moments
are played so earnestly that they come off as a joke, which is exactly what
happens here with Cameron's tender moments with his wife and child.  A
number of people in the audience could not help but laugh because West lays
on the sap about as thick as he does the explosives in the overpowering
action scenes.
As action icons Stallone and Schwarzenegger creep into middle age,
the time is right for the emergence of some new, fresh blood to headline
action/adventure films.  With The Rock and now with the thrill ride of Con
Air, Nicolas Cage proves that he can not only look and play the part but
also add on a layer of refreshing character dimensions and quirks to the
traditional kick-ass hero.  In doing so, he is truly breathing new life and
then some into the action genre.

Title
Review for Lola rennt (1998)
_Run_Lola_Run_(Lola_Rennt)_ (R) ****
About halfway through the 81 breathless minutes of
_Run_Lola_Run_(Lola_Rennt)_, a sense of paralyzing fear came over me.  It
had nothing to do with what was unfolding onscreen; rather, what had
frightened me so was the thought of the inevitable fucked-up American
remake, with some "hot" young "star" like Jennifer Love Hewitt as the
titular heroine, whose numerous running scenes would provide ample
showcase for Hewitt's least bland feature--rather, features.
So until that dark day comes--and it will, I'm sure of it (if I thought
of it, at least one Hollywood bigwig already has)--one should savor the
flavor and originality of Tom Tykwer's electrifying German action
thriller, which was perhaps too outré to earn a spot among the Best
Foreign Language Film Oscar.  Not so outrageous, and, admittedly, rather
conventional, is Tykwer's setup: Lola (Franka Potente) must somehow come
up with 100,000 marks in twenty minutes to save her boyfriend Manni
(Moritz Bleibtreu) from mobsters.
Tykwer takes that simple thread and, pardon the pun, runs with it.  It's
been said before, but the statement "it's like nothing you've ever seen
before" couldn't be more true about _Run_Lola_Run_.  He uses every trick
in the book--animated interludes, lightning-fast edits, still frames,
slow motion, you name it--and perhaps even a few more to capture the
adrenalized anxiety of Lola's desperate quest.  My description makes the
film sound like it's all flash and no substance, but what makes Tykwer's
approach so ingenious is how it reinforces and enhances the story rather
than distract from it.
This could not be more the case than with one recurring trick that is
pulled throughout the film.  After Lola encounters certain strangers, the
audience sees that character's ultimate fate through a series of
Polaroids flashed on the screen; without giving too much away, these
destinies change with certain variations in events.  (That may not make
complete sense, but it does once you see the film.)  It's a
tongue-in-cheek, seemingly throwaway narrative adornment, but it reflects
what the film is really about--not Lola, not her boyfriend, not her run;
it's about the different directions life can take, and the little
catalysts that can make big changes.  The point is eloquently made in the
film's pre-credit sequence, where the camera zigzags its way through a
crowd of people, stopping at random people as a faceless narrator
ruminates on how the questions and so-called answers in life are perhaps
one and the same.
That summation makes _Run_Lola_Run_ sound heavyhanded, pretentious, and
perhaps overreaching, but that theme doesn't hit one over the head while
watching the film, which has the sense to take itself
less-than-seriously.  (Case in point: Lola's literally shattering
screams.)  First and foremost, it is a thrill ride, as exciting and
suspenseful an action film as one is likely to see all year long--with a
minimum of violence and bloodshed.  That the film also holds up to a
deeper thematic analysis after the fact makes it an even more impressive
accomplishment.

Title
Review for King and I, The (1999)
Doug Funnie (voice of Thomas McHugh), the 12-year-old star of Jim
Jinkins's ABC and Nickelodeon animated series _Doug_, indeed has his
first film, but if there's to be a second, he'd best find a vehicle more
interesting to flesh-and-blood moviegoers over his age.  As it is,
_Doug's_1st_Movie_, in which Doug and his friend Skeeter (Fred Newman)
befriend a gentle monster from a polluted lake, is a suitable
entertainment for its target audience.  It's simple, good-natured, and
tackles an environmental theme with an admirable lack of preachiness. 
That said, for adults, the film is pleasant but hopelessly vanilla. 
While the film will hush up the kids for its lean 77 minutes, but the
older ones in the audience (read: parents) will find their attention
wandering elsewhere.  Still, families can do worse for a night at the
movies...
...such as Warner Bros.'s curious animated version of Rodgers and
Hammerstein's venerable musical _The_King_and_I_.  Since animation is the
only medium in which the movie musical is still alive and kicking, using
the form to adapt a successful stage production is a natural and
undeniably intriguing extension.  Plus, there is no need to worry about
coming up with snappy tunes when there is a tried-and-true score at one's
disposal.  (And, indeed, the classic songs "I Have Dreamed" and "Shall We
Dance?" are a pleasure to hear in this film, as they would in any
setting.)
Yet this _King_and_I_ is the most stupefyingly incompetent animated
feature to reach the big screen in recent memory--even worse than
Warner's misfire of last year, _Quest_for_Camelot_.   Like _Quest_,
_King_ features some ragged, Saturday morning-level artwork and animation
(granted, so does _Doug's_1st_Movie_, but at least there it's more or
less intentional) and some clumsily integrated (to say the least)
computer-generated effects.  But while I can see how the flighty _Quest_
could divert the young ones in the audience, _King_ is a film with no
clear audience.
The story is still basically the same: sometime in the 19th century,
British teacher Anna Leonowens (spoken by Miranda Richardson, sung by
Christiane Noll) develops a warm friendship with the initially icy King
of Siam (Martin Vidnovic) while tutoring his many children.  But, in
accordance with the Disney mold, director Richard Rich has given the tale
more kid-friendly trappings.  Toning down the material is not necessarily
a bad thing--witness Disney's triumphant, underappreciated
_The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_--but here the material is _dumbed_ down;
the addition of cuddly animal companions, portly comic sidekicks, a
sorcery-using villain, and a ridiculous action climax simply distract and
never feel like necessary and natural outgrowths of the source story. 
(_Hunchback_'s wisecracking gargoyle device didn't always work, but for
the most part, it was convincingly handled--as possibly being a figment
of Quasimodo's imagination.)  Hence, adults who are engaged by the basic
story and the music will likely be annoyed by the obligatory kiddie
concessions.  
But what about these kids, for whom the alterations were made?  The
broad comedy garnered some giggles from the children in my audience, but
most of the time I heard a lot of murmuring, some whining, and I felt a
general sense of antsiness.  This is because the story of Anna and the
King, while all-ages-appropriate, is a mature, subtly cerebral one.  And
the lushly orchestrated Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes, while timeless
standards, aren't exactly of the bouncy, "Hakuna Matata"-like jingle type
that leaves kids humming on the way out of the theatre.
Animating any traditional Broadway musical makes for an intriguing
experiment, and indeed _The_King_and_I_ is one--albeit in the wrong,
train wreck-like sort of way.  Based on this disastrous result, one can
only hope that Warner Bros., which holds the feature film rights to
Andrew Lloyd Webber's _The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_, doesn't decide to
sidestep the casting controversy and opt to go the animated route.

Title
Review for Hana-bi (1997)
Takeshi Kitano is truly the "King of All Media" in Japan, where he has
conquered the worlds of film, television, radio, newspapers, even stand-up
comedy.  However, if American audiences know him at all, it is likely for
his villainous role in the putrid cyberthriller Johnny Mnemonic.  That
could all change with the near-simultaneous stateside launches of two of
his writing-directing-editing-acting efforts, Sonatine and Fireworks
(Hana-Bi).
Notice I wrote "could" instead of "will" or "should," because Kitano's
poetic, meditative brand of filmmaking will probably be as difficult for
most mainstream audiences to sit through as it is to describe (at the
showing of Sonatine I attended, there were more than a handful of
walkouts).  These two films fit squarely within a genre (in both of these
cases, crime thriller), yet they are made in a stylized, lyrical style more
befitting of avant-garde arthouse fare.  The resulting works are slow and
somewhat difficult, but they prove to be rewarding sits for the more
open-minded viewer.
In 1993's Sonatine, Kitano (billed under his acting moniker "'Beat'
Takeshi") plays an aging small-time gangster dispatched by his boss to go
to Okinawa to help resolve a turf conflict.  After an ambush, a
double-cross is clearly afoot, and he and his crew of rather immature young
men retreat to a seaside cabin.  It is during this section that most people
departed the auditorium, but it's not for the reasons one may think.
Although there are brief bursts of bloody violence interspersed throughout
the film, what (for lack of a better word) "offended" was the attention to
behavior that would normally be deemed too trivial to be shown onscreen.
Kitano spends plenty of time focusing on what these men do to keep
themselves from complete boredom, such as staging mock sumo wrestling
matches.  It sounds kind of boring on the page (and, apparently for some
it's boring on screen as well), but the quirky humor of these scenes give
what could easily be a tired story an unusual air of freshness and humanity.
As expertly made as it is, what I found lacking in Sonatine was any
emotional connection, which diminished the power of the finale.  The same
cannot be said of Kitano's most recent effort, Fireworks (Hana-Bi).  In
this film, Kitano, in a nearly silent role, plays a former cop who takes
his terminally ill wife (Kayoko Kishimoto) on an extended road trip; at the
same time, police tail him for a bank robbery he made in order to pay off a
mob loan shark.  Much like Sonatine, the film moves at a leisurely pace;
there are brief, unsettling bursts of violence; and laughs are derived from
quirky situations and behavior.  But Fireworks is more richly satifying to
the emotions and the senses.  Serving as a counterpoint to the main plot is
the story is of a crippled former partner (Ren Osugi) who searches for
meaning through painting.  His paintings (which, not so surprisingly, are
actually painted by Kitano himself) are extensively viewed in haunting
wordless sequences, which provide the film with a stunning visual framework
that grows increasingly ominous as the quietly poignant conclusion draws
near.  
It is unlikely that the films of Takeshi Kitano will be as widely embraced
by American viewers as those of Hong Kong directors.  But in Sonatine and
Fireworks, Kitano proves to be a gifted cinematic visionary whose truly
unique work deserves stateside recognition, even if that recognition comes
from a fairly limited, though highly appreciative, audience.

Review for Jawbreaker (1999)
Glam gals Courtney Shayne (Rose McGowan), Julie Freeman (Rebecca
Gayheart), Marcie Fox (Julie Benz) and Liz Purr (Charlotte Roldan) make
up _the_ clique at Reagan High.  That is, until a birthday prank goes
fatally wrong, and Liz's slot is left open.  Enter Fern Mayo (Judy Evans
Greer), the geekiest girl in school.  After Fern finds out the truth
about what happened to Liz, ringleader Courtney offers the social outcast
a makeover and popularity beyond her wildest dreams--in exchange for her
silence.  Hence the barely noticed disappearance of Fern and the
much-noticed arrival of the one-named Vylette, a blonde, self-proclaimed
bitch who threatens Courtney's crown as the school's "it" girl.
As Julie so eloquently tells Courtney regarding Liz's jawbreaker-induced
death, "You can't hide the truth with a makeover!"  The same can be said
of writer-director Darren Stein's black comedy, which is a mishmash of
elements from _Heathers_, _Clueless_, and _Very_Bad_Things_.  But its
derivative nature aside, _Jawbreaker_ is a darkly fun romp, thanks to
Stein's witty script and stylishly energetic direction (Fern's
Frankenstein-like transformation into Vylette is a nicely surreal touch)
and, especially, McGowan's deliciously wicked turn as the ruthless ice
queen Courtney.  (opens February 19)

Title
Review for Big Hit, The (1998)
Although his best-known work is a Jackie Chan vehicle, Hong Kong director
Che-Kirk Wong appeared to be an odd choice to direct a quirky action
comedy; after all, the Chan film in question, 1993's Crime Story, is known
among the Jackie faithful as his "serious" action film, devoid of any
humor.  With The Big Hit, Wong shows he can do a capable action/humor
juggling job.  If only he had a funnier script to work with.
The Big Hit gets off to a very promising start, with a terrific extended
action sequence set in a hotel.  Much of the hyper-choreographed mayhem
owes a large debt to John Woo (who, perhaps not so coincidentally, serves
as an executive producer), but the stylishly staged shootouts work; how can
one not get a rise when hitman Melvin Smiley (Mark Wahlberg), hanging out
of a high window by only his feet, somehow manages to lift himself up and
blow away the baddies?  Writer Ben Ramsey also promises something different
from most action films, introducing a colorful menagerie of eccentric
characters, such as the no-nonsense, if mild-mannered, Melvin's goofy
contract-killing cohorts Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips), Crunch (Bokeem
Woodbine), and Vince (Antonio Sabato Jr.).
But once Ramsey sets up the main scenario, in which the foursome kidnap
and hold for ransom one Keiko Nishi (China Chow), daughter of a rich
Japanese businessman--a job not assigned to them by their tough boss, Paris
(Avery Brooks)--things come a bit undone.  Those potentially interesting
characters never develop into more than single-trait cardboard cutouts.
Crunch is a compulsive masturbator, constantly doing hand-strengthening
exercises; Vince is a pretty boy lothario, or at least that's what the
press notes say, for he never really exhibits such behavior aside from
hitting on some women in the early-going.  Disappearing as quickly and
conspicuously as Crunch and Vince after making a flashy, brash splash is
Melvin's sassy mistress Chantel, played by a completely wasted Lela Rochon.
It goes without saying that the success of an action comedy depends on its
batting average in both action and comedy.  While Wong shows he can combine
the two elements fairly fluidly, The Big Hit is hampered too many weak
comic attempts.  Ramsey has fun tweaking conventions of kidnapping
thrillers (the ransom message, call tracing), action films (a car that
barely hangs on after being run off of a high road), and movies in general
(sappy Oscar-bait scenes).  But his more straightforward humor falls flat.
A running gag involving Melvin's delinquent account at the local video
store grows old long before its admittedly interesting payoff.  Least
successful is the subplot involving the "German-Irish" Melvin's engagement
to the Jewish Pam (Christina Applegate).   The would-be humorous
head-butting that occurs when her parents (Lainie Kazan and Elliott Gould)
come to visit is tired; the mother, a strict Jew, objects to the pairing on
religious grounds; the recovering-alkie father doesn't care, just as long
as he gets a drink.  In fact, all attempts at a romantic angle don't work.
Wahlberg is paired with three different leading ladies, and he hasn't the
slightest bit of chemistry with any of them, least of all Chow, with whom
he became involved offscreen.  They do have one transcendent moment
together: a hilarious "erotic" chicken-stuffing scene, but the scene works
because of the tongue-in-cheek, "sensual" underscore and suggestive sight
gag, not because of any palpable onscreen sparks between Wahlberg and Chow.
The media audience with whom I saw The Big Hit gave the film a spirited
reception, and its easy-going melding of slam-bang action and oddball humor
could appeal to regular moviegoing audiences.  But as far as I am
concerned, the sporadically effective The Big Hit is not a big miss, but it
doesn't exactly live up to its title, either.

Title
Review for Bicentennial Man (1999)
_Bicentennial_Man_ (PG) *** (out of ****)
The trailer for Chris Columbus' adaptation of Isaac Asimov's short story
and novel _The_Positronic_Man_ makes this Robin Williams vehicle look
like a futuristic sequel to _Patch_Adams_--in short, a ghastly piece of
shameless audience manipulation.  The sentiment is laid on as thick as
molasses as the trailer shows how a robot named Andrew (Williams) is
adopted by a family and proves to be "special"--unlike any other android,
he appears to actually bear the qualities of emotion and creativity.  His
human characteristics eventually feed into a desire to become human, a
dream that gradually comes true over the course of 200 years (hence the
title).  The trailer comes to a climax as Williams, no longer made of
metal and bearing a flesh-and-blood appearance, asks comely co-star
Embeth Davidtz to kiss him.
Watching the film itself, I saw that the trailer was accurate in
conveying one thing: _Bicentennial_Man_ is, without a doubt, a
manipulative picture.  But director Chris Columbus, schmaltzmeister that
he is, makes no bones about it--he wants to move you.  The surprise then
came in how I was touched (though not quite moved) by this gentle,
likable centuries-spanning fable.  While Williams goes through his
earnest warm-fuzzy motions as the lead (the only really distinctive thing
about his work here is how he wears a head-to-toe metal suit for much of
the picture), the standout work--and that which goes a long way for one's
involvement in the picture--belongs to Embeth Davidtz, who has a dual
role as Amanda, a.k.a. "Little Miss," the youngest daughter in the family
that "adopts" Andrew; and Portia, her granddaughter.  When Davidtz is
recycled, so does screenwriter Nicholas Kazan recycle the contrived plot
wrinkle of her character being betrothed to another.  But with a proven
buttons-pusher such as Columbus at the helm, it's easy to forgive
uninspired plot mechanics, for the undeniable emotional pull compensates.

Title
Review for Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)
_Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels_ (R) *** (out of ****)
Take a dash of _Trainspotting_'s scuzziness and generous helpings of the
oeuvre of Tarantino, and you've got an extremely derivative film.   But
if the film is as entertaining as first-time writer-director Guy
Ritchie's fresh and fun _Lock,_Stock..._--a smash in its native Great
Britain--the lack of originality hardly matters.
Ritchie takes his time setting up the players in this story about a
foursome of inept small-time hoods (Nick Moran, Jason Flemyng, Jason
Statham, and Dexter Fletcher) who stage a heist to pay off a gambling
debt owed to a crime boss (P.H. Moriarty).  The fact that these players
are lacking any real depth or substance is actually of little
consequence, for Ritchie drops them in a clever, complex, and comic caper
that takes its share of unexpected twists and turns.  It may not a
perfect debut for Ritchie, but the visual flair and ingenious plotting he
displays with _Lock,_Stock..._ leaves one optimistic about his future
efforts.

Title
Review for Vertical Limit (2000)
_Vertical_Limit_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
With its dizzying depictions of courageous derring-do atop rugged
mountain peaks and perilously close to steep cliffs, the trailer to
Columbia's _Vertical_Limit_ has been leaving many a moviegoer
breathless... much like the teaser to the same studio's mountain climbing
actioner of seven years ago, _Cliffhanger_.  That's where the
similarities end.  _Cliffhanger_ was by no means a great film, but it was
an exciting thrill ride with no pretense whatsoever as to what it is and
what it should be.  The fact that the stars of _Vertical_Limit_ have gone
on record to say that they were attracted to the "relationships" in the
piece explains exactly how this film goes wrong--that and the name "Chris
O'Donnell" toplining the cast credits.
As displayed in _GoldenEye_ and _The_Mask_of_Zorro_, director Martin
Campbell knows how to stage a suspenseful action scene, and the action
sequences in _Vertical_Limit_ confirm his talent.  The first scene, in
which three climbers are left dangling on a single thin, quickly
unraveling cord, more than recalls the memorable open of _Cliffhanger_
and holds up fairly well in comparison.  In a later scene, a climber
makes a deadly slide down a snowy slope, narrowly avoiding a plunge off
of a cliff thanks to a fortuitously timed swing of a pickaxe.  Other
scenes involving the danger that can only come when you combine snow,
mountainous terrain, and canisters of nitroglycerin also generate
palpable, nail-biting tension.
The problem is that the visceral shocks are in the service of a script
that actually includes the stultifying line "There's not gonna be just
snow--there'll be ice and rock."  Those "relationships" that so enamored
the actors?  Number one: Peter Garrett (O'Donnell) and his sister, Annie
(Robin Tunney).  Following in the footsteps of their father, Annie is a
famous mountain climber; Peter was also a skilled in the activity, but he
gave it up following the incident that led to their father's death.  When
Annie and cohorts Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) and wealthy adventure-seeker
Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton) end up trapped in a crevasse while attempting
to scale K2, Peter must put his guilt and self-doubt aside and try to
rescue them.  Number two: Vaughn and Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn).  Wick
is a mysterious mountain-dwelling loner who bears a grudge against Vaughn
for reasons initially unknown; he joins Peter's rescue teamin hopes of
getting a chance to settle the score.  As if these relationships weren't
hackneyed enough (and to fulfill some unwritten requirement for
"romance"), there's the out-of-nowhere attraction that develops between
Peter and the fetching French-Canadian nurse (_GoldenEye_'s "good" Bond
girl, Izabella Scorupco) who tags along for the mission.
All the overplayed and underthought melodrama is rendered even more
ludicrous by the overly earnest cast.  Not even Glenn, sporting dirty,
stringy locks and one toeless foot, seems to have a grasp on how
ridiculous his character or the entire affair is.  Whether or not that
latter fact is lost on O'Donnell is anyone's guess.  One has to wonder
why Hollywood continues to cast this stiff block of boredom in headlining
roles; to call him "vanilla" is to give that savory flavor an undeserved
bad name.  His lazy, inexpressive performance here should prove to the
suits once and for all that this walking, talking rice cake incarnate
does not have what it takes to become a major star.  Similarly,
_Vertical_Limit_ overall does not have what it takes to deserve major
holiday hit status.

Title
Review for Cruise, The (1998/I)
After the first five minutes of _The_Cruise_, I wanted to shoot the
documentary's subject, wildly eccentric New York tour bus guide Timothy
"Speed" Levitch.  Ceaselessly babbling in a nasal voice just a tad more
listenable than Fran Drescher's, he got on my nerves instantaneously.  But
as Bennett Miller's beautifully photographed black-and-white film
progressed, I became fascinated by him.  Though ostensibly about his love
affair with every last aspect of the city, _The_Cruise_ gradually reveals
itself to be a most unique character study, where the subject reveals
himself not through the personal information he imparts (there are vague
allusions to a bad relationship with his parents and failed attempts at a
writing career), but all else he talks about--and talk he does, in florid
verbiage that reveals less about objects than his poetic nature.
A little more straightforward on the surface is the dark and depressing
_Unmade_Beds_, which follows four New Yorkers on their never-ending (and
never-successful) quests for true love and happiness.  Our subjects: Aimee
Copp, a goodhearted 28-year-old with a weight problem (she weighs 225
pounds) who longs to be married before the big 3-0; Mikey Russo, a
54-year-old struggling screenwriter who is proud of his womanizing past;
40-year-old, 5'4" Michael DeStephano, a bitter but likable guy who more
than reminds of _Seinfeld_'s George Costanza; and, most memorably, Brenda
Monte, a brash, buxom 40-something divorcee who is less interested in love
than a man with deep enough pockets to support her and her 16-year-old
daughter.
But, as I said, _Unmade_Beds_ is only straightforward on the surface.
While these are real people followed over a period of nine months, as the
opening disclaimer says, it is not stated that the happenings onscreen are
fictionalized.  Writer-director Nicholas Barker based his script on
extensive interviews with his cast, using their real-life happenings as a
jumping-off point for those in his script.  While these people's true
personalities and pain are clearly revealed throughout, sometimes
discomfitingly so (Aimee's pain is most acutely felt), it is that unique
veneer of fiction that makes the film fall short.  Instead of enhancing the
real truths that Barker is after, the fiction, appropriately enough,
diminishes any truth he finds; this is especially the case with a late
"plot twist" involving Brenda's fortunes.  While _Unmade_Beds_ is
engrossing, engaging viewing, I cannot shake the feeling that it would have
been moreso had I seen the whole truth.

Title
Review for One Eight Seven (1997)
187 (R) *** (out of ****)
        Fifteen months after being stabbed by a student in a New York high
school, teacher Trevor Garfield (Samuel L. Jackson) returns to the
profession at a Southern California inner-city school a changed man--his
passion is not the same as it used to be; his guard is always up.  And he
soon finds out that while he and the setting have changed, everything is the
same as it was in New York--the gangs, the crime, the senseless violence.
And Trevor will no longer be anyone's victim.
        187 at times threatens to become another inspirational "teacher who
makes a difference" film a la Dangerous Minds, but scripter Scott Yagemann
(himself a teacher) has a darker agenda.  If anything, 187 is about the
impossibility of making a difference, at least a wholesale one.  Another
smart move is to not paint Trevor in the most sympathetic of lights; while
he is noble of intention, he at times is certainly not noble in action,
making for a refreshingly human educator instead of the saintly
Michelle-Pfeiffer-as-Louanne-Johnson types.
        The film does, however, have a problem at its core, and that is
director Kevin Reynolds.  Directing an urban drama is a stretch for the
one-time Waterworld helmer, and it shows.  Apparently bored by the
down-to-earth material, he and cinematographer Ericson Core amuse themselves
by juicing up the visuals, but the fancy camera  work only serves to
undermine the grit and reality of the story.  Is it really necessary, for
example, to have the camera ceaselessly circle two characters having a quiet
dinner at home?  Or, in a scene where Trevor and fellow teacher Ellen Henry
(Kelly Rowan) have a discussion in his classroom, to see the oversized
silhouettes of basketball-playing students projected onto the walls behind
them?  The visual flourishes are not only unnecessary, but pointless--who
wants a gritty drama to look pretty?
        What makes the film work, perhaps better than it has any right to
be, is Jackson, who brings a quiet dignity and slow-simmering anger to
Trevor that is fascinating.  But this is not to say that he isn't
vulnerable, and its his emotional rapport with the audience that makes the
character of Trevor sympathetic to the audience, even when his actions cross
the line.  The other actors, such as Rowan, John Heard (as a burnt-out
teacher), and Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez (as a delinquent student) are able
to hold their own, with the exception of the badly miscast Karina Arroyave
in the pivotal role of Rita, Trevor's star pupil.  It is her character's
duty to deliver the film's key closing speech, and Arroyave can't shed a
tear to save her life.

Title
Review for Screwed (2000)
        The tagline for the comedy _Screwed_ is "Everyone gets it in the end." 
That could not be more true--especially for the audience, who gets it
much worse than any of the characters in the film.  It is tempting to say
that any audience that sees _Screwed_ will themselves feel "screwed." 
But that's putting it lightly; anyone who sees it would know that a more
profane term would be more appropriate.
        As bad as the film is, _Screwed_ isn't, well, screwed from the start. 
In fact, it does hold some degree of promise from a plotting standpoint. 
Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (who make their directorial
debut with this film) do devise an interesting set of twists from a
simple premise: as payback against his slavedriving employer Miss Crock
(Elaine Stritch), overworked and underappreciated chauffeur Willard
Fillmore (Norm Macdonald) and his friend Rusty (Dave Chappelle) come up
with a plan to kidnap Miss Crock's beloved dog and hold it for ransom. 
Of course, the plan doesn't go quite as they planned, and the turns the
plot takes as events quickly spin out of control are not without some
inspiration.
        Where Alexander and Karaszewski could have used more inspiration are the
gags that fill the time between turns of the plot.  Ben Stiller's fight
with a pooch in _There's_Something_About_Mary_ was indeed hilarious, but
other film's attempts to ape that scene have always fallen flat on their
faces; _Screwed_'s weak try is no exception.  The scene, with Willard
spraying blood all over the walls of Miss Crock's house as her dog's
teeth remain clenched on his hand, is indicative of the juvenile level of
slapsticky humor that dominates the film.  An old lady in a hospital hits
Rusty in the head with a bedpan.  A woman kicks a man a number of times
in rapid succession.  There's even a running gag where Rusty hits guys in
the head with lamps.  It's all more numbing than funny.
        Alas, the tiresome physical gags aren't numbing enough to spare the
audience the pain of spending time with such unpleasant characters. 
Willard and Rusty aren't charmingly dimwitted--as is the obvious
intent--but obnoxiously stupid; Macdonald's whiny performance makes
matters even worse.  Stritch makes a hateful bitch, but she is so
unlikable that it's painful to watch and listen to her; no less than an
excruciating death for her character would be a satisfying payoff for the
film (needless to say, that doesn't happen).  It's rather telling that
Danny DeVito's weirdo morgue attendant, a grimy guy who mines dead bodies
for hidden treasure, exudes the most charm, comparatively speaking.
        Even harder to figure than why Alexander and Karaszewski--who have 
established themselves as gifted screenwriters (_Ed_Wood_,
_The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt_)--wrote _Screwed_ is why they chose this
script to serve as their maiden directorial effort.  Perhaps they thought
that only they would be able to give the script its full justice, but I
can't imagine any other filmmaker doing much worse with the already-poor
material than they have.

Title
Review for Iron Giant, The (1999)
_The_Iron_Giant_ (PG) **** (out of ****)
When I first saw the trailer for Warner Bros.' latest animated feature
_The_Iron_Giant_, the thought that immediately came to mind was "_E.T._
with a robot."  Little did I know just how much truth would lie in that
statement.  Rather than a cheap ripoff of that family classic,
_The_Iron_Giant_ is a newly-minted one in its own right, spinning a yarn
that is fun, funny, and, most crucially, poignant and inspiring--much
like Steven Spielberg film of 17 years ago.
Any film, whether live action or animated, lives or dies by what's on
the page, and the key ingredient in _The_Iron_Giant_'s success is the
script by Tim McCanlies and director Brad Bird, based on the book
_The_Iron_Man_ by Ted Hughes.  A basic plot synopsis--youngster Hogarth
Hughes (voice of Eli Marienthal) finds a giant alien robot (Vin
Diesel)--fails to do justice to what the story entirely encompasses.  It
is on this simple plot thread that McCanlies and Bird hang a number of
well-developed themes: friendship, choosing one's identity, and a staunch
anti-violence stance.
_The_Iron_Giant_ may sound overly preachy and heavyhanded, but that
could not be farther from the truth.  These themes are subtly and
seamlessly integrated into the story, as is the film's witty sense of
humor.  The film takes place in 1957, and Bird not only captures the look
and atmosphere of that bygone era, but also its state of mind--most
notably the post-WWII fear of an atomic holocaust, which is mined for
some good satiric laughs (a sugarcoated classroom film on what to do in
the event of a bombing is especially funny).  That sense of paranoia also
goes a long way in explaining character motivation, namely that of
government Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald), who believes the Iron
Giant is a weapon of war that must be destroyed.
Smart touches such as those may fly over the heads of the children in
the audience, but the action and humor of _The_Iron_Giant_ will not fail
to delight them and the adults in attendance.  Young and old can also
share in the enjoyment of the believable characters.  The youthful
exuberance and curiosity of both Hogarth and the Iron Giant are
incredibly endearing, a quality bolstered by the vocal performances of
Marienthal and Diesel.  McDonald's Kent is an amusingly hissable baddie,
and Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr. disappear nicely into their
roles as Hogarth's mother and beatnik friend Dean, respectively.
The animation in _The_Iron_Giant_ won't soon erase memories of the
intricate camera moves featured in Disney's _Tarzan_, but it is a huge
step up from Warner Bros.'s recent animated embarrassments,
_Quest_for_Camelot_ and the awful _The_King_and_I_.  The clean yet simple
art style is a better fit for this story than any more technologically
advanced approach would be; it lends a nice comic book-like air to the
proceedings.  (Not coincidentally, the Iron Giant's resemblance to a
character in one of Hogarth's comic books is a prominent point.)  The
simplicity doesn't come at the expense of expressiveness, however, for
all the characters' faces--even the Iron Giant's--vividly register on the
emotional scale.
The strength of those emotions took me quite by surprise by the close of
_The_Iron_Giant_, when I realized just how much I grew to care about
these characters and their fates.  With its wit and adventuresome spirit,
_The_Iron_Giant_ is a superbly entertaining film for the entire family,
but what makes it transcendent--much like _E.T._--is how deeply it is
able to touch its audience.

Title
Review for Playing God (1997)
Playing God (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
        Buena Vista's press synopsis for Playing God labels the film "an intense
thriller," and never have publicity notes been more helpful: after watching
this aimless oddity, I could not get a handle what exactly the film is,
and, based on the mess onscreen, the filmmakers themselves did not seem to
have a clue, either.
        Playing God starts out like a thriller, with our hero, aimless junkie
Eugene Sands (David Duchovny), performing some nifty impromptu surgery on a
shooting victim in a seedy L.A. nightclub.  That grisly scene is followed
by a more straight dramatic one, when we are offered a glimpse into
Eugene's troubled past: he was once a surgeon, but he was stripped of his
medical license after doing some fatal work on a patient while under the
influence of amphetamines.  Things then shift into a more comedic gear with
the entrance of counterfeiter Raymond Blossom (Timothy Hutton), who,
impressed with Eugene's spontaneous and skillful show of surgical savvy,
takes a reluctant Eugene under his wing as a highly-paid on-call doctor who
illegally "fixes" his criminal associates after they get themselves into
bloody mishaps.  And whenever Eugene's surgical gigs take center stage, the
film takes a more blackly comic route.
        When thriller-like double-crosses by Eugene, Raymond's girlfriend Claire
(Angelina Jolie), and an FBI agent (Michael Massee) come into the picture,
it becomes quite clear that no one involved in Playing God, much less
director Andy Wilson or writer Mark Haskell Smith, has a real grasp on what
exactly the film is all about.  Not only is the film's mood and flow of
events all over the map, but without any focused direction, all of the
players attack the material from wildly different angles.  Duchovny
maintains a Fox Mulder-type balance of deadpan sarcasm and seriousness
throughout; the pouty Jolie is stiffly earnest; and Massee and especially
Hutton seemed to have wandered in from the broad comedy next door.  I
suppose the original intent of Playing God was to be a neo-noir with a
gloss of postmodern hipness, something hinted at by Eugene's coolly
detached and "ironic," if pointless, voiceover narration.  But any
discernable intentions are lost in the swirl of clashing ideas and
sensibilities.
        "A game with no rules" reads the tagline for Playing God, which can best
be described as "a film with no rules": a peculiar star vehicle for X-Files
sensation Duchovny that meanders within the territory of comedy, drama,
thriller, and just about anything under the cinematic sun with very little
rhyme and no apparent reason at all.

Title
Review for Everlasting Piece, An (2000)
_An_Everlasting_Piece_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
If for nothing else, young actor Barry McEvoy certainly earns points for
finding a new and unusual way of addressing the oft-explored issue of the
Northern Ireland Catholic/Protestant conflict in his script for
_An_Everlasting_Piece_.  Fortunately, there is more to savor in Barry
Levinson's film of McEvoy's script--though those charms aren't quite
enough to take this modest comedy over the top.
Interestingly enough, the term "over the top" is one that really cannot
be applied to the film, a fairly surprising fact given its wacky premise.
 Sometime in Belfast during the 1980s, Colm (McEvoy) and George (Brían F.
O'Byrne)--a Catholic and a Protestant, respectively--meet on the job as
barbers in a mental hospital and become fast friends.  When they learn
that a recently admitted patient aptly nicknamed "the Scalper" (Billy
Connolly) was the only toupee salesman serving all of Northern Ireland,
Colm and George see an opportunity to make it big as his piece-pushing
replacements.  That's easier said than done, for the newly-christened
"Piece People" (as Colm and George come to call themselves) aren't the
only team with the same idea--emerging from nowhere are the equally
enterprising but superior salesmen operating under the eyecatching name
Toupee or Not Toupee.
Colm and George's biggest obstacle, however, ultimately proves to be
their differing religions.  That fact may not be an issue to them or
their families, but it's the only one to the Irish Republican Army,
namely one member (Colum Convey) with whom the pair come into close
contact.  It's a credit to McEvoy and Levinson that the film smoothly
slides from light laughs to heavier material without a hint of
awkwardness.  Also contributing greatly is the cast of mostly fresh
faces, who are adept at handling both the comic and the dramatic.  More
than holding her own with the instantly likable pair of McEvoy and
O'Byrne is the delightful Anna Friel, who makes Colm's girlfriend Bronagh
as smart as she is spunky and sexy.
Despite the cast's considerable charm, _An_Everlasting_Piece_ still
falls short of the mark.  McEvoy, while displaying promise as a writer,
is at this point more skilled with his acting instrument than he is with
a pen.  His lively sense of humor makes for a number of amusing
sequences, but sometimes these scenes are inconsequential diversions;
case in point, a broad scene where Colm's mother mistakes a stranger
sleeping outside the house for his younger brother.  Also, the character
of the Scalper is rather clunkily kept in the action far longer than
necessity requires, sticking around for no real payoff.
Now and again, though, McEvoy serves up some pointedly, sometimes
absurdly, funny moments, such as Colm and George's initial encounter with
the IRA man; and his passionate concern over the Northern Ireland issue
shines through.  Similarly apparent in _An_Everlasting_Piece_ are the
high spirits with which all involved approached the project, making this
easygoing entertainment that more impossible to hate.  It's unfortunate,
then, that some shortcomings also make this undeniably likable and
sometimes lively film difficult to completely embrace.

Title
Review for Bride of Chucky (1998)
In 1988, killer doll Chucky made his splash in _Child's_Play_; in 1978,
director John Carpenter burst onto the horror scene with _Halloween_.  Ten
and twenty years later, respectively, neither Chucky's novelty nor
Carpenter's horror skill have aged very well, as evidenced by the schlocky
_Bride_of_Chucky_ and _John_Carpenter's_Vampires_.
Unlike eating a box of chocolates, walking into the movie
_Bride_of_Chucky_, you're pretty sure what you're gonna get.  For the
fourth film in the _Child's_Play_ franchise, you pay your admission to see
Chucky, the diminutive, redheaded "Good Guy" doll possessed by the spirit
of a dead serial killer, slice and dice his way through a long line of
human victims--no more, no less, all done somewhat tongue-in-cheek but
largely done in the name of a good scare.
How surprising it is, then, to watch _Bride_, which plays less like
another sequel than a Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker sendup of the series.  Perhaps
writer Don Mancini (the creator of the series) saw self-parody as the only
way to keep Chucky alive in the irony-drenched post-_Scream_ horror
climate, making free use of self-deprecating dialogue such as "Chucky?
He's so '80s!"  The plot itself is a joke, with Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), a
former flame of the incarnate Chucky, becoming Chucky the doll's (voiced by
Brad Dourif) partner in serial murder after her newly-liberated spirit
inhabits a female doll.
All of the added humor, though, does not make _Bride_of_Chucky_ a good
film--just a campy one.  For all their irony, post-_Scream_ thrillers, in
the end, are horror films, going after the big scare.  _Bride_, however,
makes no attempt to be scary; the scariest thing about it is the fact that
it was directed by the gifted Ronny Yu, who in his native Hong Kong
directed the brilliant 1993 action fantasy _The_Bride_with_White_Hair_.  As
gruesome as some of Chucky and Tiffany's murders are (for instance, one
man's face becomes a pincushion for nails), they are too over-the-top to
truly shock.  In fact, the film's big problem is just that, being too
over-the-top too much of the time, from the acting (the dreadful Tilly in
particular) to story developments (yes, a doll-doll sex scene is funny, but
_still_...).  Even a film called _Bride_of_Chucky_ could use some restraint
and be all the better for it.  By the time the film came to its predictable
"twist" ending (hint: what logically follows "_bride_ of..."?), you may eel
like groaning.  The audience with whom I saw the film did (and quite
loudly, I might add).
That's all _Bride_of_Chucky_ leaves you with--a groan: a groan that this
tired series may not yet be over; a groan that you blew hard-earned cash to
see it; but most of all, a groan that you've just lost 80-some-odd minutes
of your life that can never be recovered.
More polished technically, but no less groan-worthy, is _Vampires_.
Carpenter obviously has a lot of fun at the helm of this one, staging the
brutally (and, some would argue, excessively) bloody scenes of carnage with
gleeful abandon: blood, bodies, and body parts fly across the screen in
every direction.  A great deal of credit goes to the make-up work by the
KNB EFX Group (Robert Kurtzman, Gregory Nicotero, and Howard Berger), which
is convincing and, yes, more than a little repulsive.
So what's the problem?  Just about everything else, but mostly Don
Jakoby's odious script, which is based on John Steakley's novel _Vampire$_.
 There's no real plot, just vampire slayer Jack Crow (James Woods) hunting
out master vampire Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), who is after a sacred cross
that will make him and his fellow bloodsuckers, as Crow's priest sidekick
(Tim Guinee) says, "a force unstoppable--unless we stop him!"  That line,
which would make the late Ed Wood proud, should tell you all you need to
know about the overall quality of the dialogue.
But the laughable dialogue and lack of plot isn't as problematic as the
uninteresting and unlikable characters.  For someone who was raised by the
Catholic church after his parents died when he was young, Jack is awfully
disrespectful, tossing around priests, threatening them with mortal
violence, and frequently flinging F-words at them.  Woods's insufferably
smug performance makes the character even more unsavory.  In addition to
being anti-Catholic, the film is also terribly misogynist, with female
lead, a Valek-bitten prostitute named Katrina (Sheryl Lee, reduced to
screaming and trembling), constantly getting slapped around and humiliated
by Jack's boorish partner Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin, who, quite simply,
sucks--bad pun intended).  Even more insulting?  Tony eventually falls for
Katrina, and--yep--her with him.
Like _Bride_of_Chucky_, I'm certain a number of _Vampires_'s laughs are
intentional; Carpenter has always displayed an arch sense of humor, and
that comes through in certain scenes, including the ridiculous resolution
scene.  But I'm not so sure so much of it was meant to be laughed at; two
women sitting behind me at the screening understandably laughed non-stop.
The most disheartening thing about _Vampires_, however, is not its
campiness, but its lack of scares; it's hard to believe the same man who
made the elegantly creepy (and largely bloodless) classic _Halloween_
directed this piece of schlock.

Title
Review for American Tail: Fievel Goes West, An (1991)
_America's_Sweethearts_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
        Two types of comedies struggle for control in _America's_Sweethearts_:
one, a catty satire of the Hollywood hype machine; the other, a frothy star
vehicle for America's apparent real-life sweetheart, Julia Roberts.  Coming out
the loser in the ensuing mess is Joe Roth, who shows that spending the last ten
or so years heading movie studios hasn't done any favors for whatever
directorial ability he may have once had.
        From the looks of it, _America's_Sweethearts_ started out as an edgier
ensemble picture, and shades of that appear in the film's more effective
portion, the first half.  The sweethearts of the title are beloved off- and
on-screen pair Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (John
Cusack), who fell in love on the set and then proceeded to make a string of
popular co-starring vehicles after getting married.  Alas, the fairy tale came
to an ugly end after Gwen fell in love with another co-star (Hank Azaria) on the
set of their latest movie, the sci-fi romance _Time_Over_Time_, which is now
being readied for release.  It's up to seasoned publicist Lee Phillips (Billy
Crystal) to make sure the two put on their best faces--and not kill each
other--during the multi-day, hotel-set publicity ritual known as the press
junket.
        The basic premise of _America's_Sweethearts_ paints the film as being
almost too 
inside.  After all, the story of a press junket being in danger is one that
could only be understood, much less appreciated, by journalists and others with
a keen knowledge of the workings of Tinseltown's PR process.  That said, some
effective zingers (by Crystal and Peter Tolan) directed at big studio glitz
provide some amusement for less showbiz-savvy audiences, as do some inspired
performances by Stanley Tucci, who plays a nervous studio chief; Christopher
Walken, who plays the eccentric, reclusive director of _Time_Over_Time_; and
Zeta-Jones, who obviously has a ball playing the stereotypical self-absorbed
screen diva.
        But somewhere along the line Julia Roberts decided to get involved in
the picture--not as the ostensible female lead, Gwen, but in the more secondary
role of Gwen's put-upon sister/personal assistant Kiki.  Roth then beefed up the
Kiki role in fair proportion to the "JULIA!" stature as any self-respecting
studio head/businessman would.  However, this turns out to be a ruinous
miscalculation not only in terms of storytelling but  in simple casting.  Kiki
is supposed to be frumpy and a bit of a loser, and regardless of whether or not
you think Roberts is the "pretty woman" she's celebrated as being, her charisma
and natural star wattage is undeniable and just about impossible to quash.  Not
even a fat suit, which she wears in some flashback scenes, is able to obscure
the fact that it's "JULIA!".  So when Kiki and Eddie start to develop feelings
for each other (which isn't giving away a thing that isn't already revealed in
the trailers or that could be easily predicted), what should have been a mere
plot complication becomes the focus, and suddenly "America's Sweethearts"
transforms into a "JULIA!" star vehicle about how she gets the guy--and an
especially weak one at that, given the glacial non-chemistry between her and
Cusack.
        Not that _America's_Sweethearts_ is too successful in general comedic
terms.  Apparently having little faith in the sometimes-spicy ideas and dialogue
as well as the talented actors delivering them, Roth throws in the broadest
lowest-common-denominator slapstick gags whenever he can.  A feisty, ferocious
dog takes an unnatural liking to Lee's crotch.  While jogging through a golf
course, Lee's underling Danny (Seth Green) gets hit in the head with a ball. 
And the point is...?  Certainly not laughs, for those goofy goings-on land with
a thud.
        Then again, the whole of _America's_Sweethearts_ doesn't seem to have a
point, either, given its split personality.  Roth would have been wiser to
choose between making a movie publicity send-up or a "JULIA!" showcase, for in
trying to achieve the best of both worlds, he ended up shortchanging the
audiences for either.

Title
Review for Best Man, The (1999/I)
If you ask me, it's impossible to not like a film that ends with the
entire cast doing the electric slide to Cameo's '80s funk classic
"Candy."  But there's more to enjoy in   _The_Best_Man_ than its
infectious full company closing dance number.  First-time writer-director
Malcolm D. Lee's fresh and fun ensemble comedy is a classy effort that
delivers the requisite doses of laughs and romance along with a fair
amount of intelligence.
As the title implies, the central event in _The_Best_Man_ is a wedding,
that between football star Lance Sullivan (Morris Chestnut) and his
longtime love Mia (Monica Calhoun).  The blessed event reunites a number
of the couple's college friends, including Murch (Harold Perrineau Jr.),
henpecked by longtime girlfriend Shelby (Melissa DeSousa); self-styled
player Quentin (Terrence Howard); successful BET television producer
Jordan Armstrong (Nia Long); and of course the best man himself, author
Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs), who is shy to committing to long-suffering
girlfriend Robin (Sanaa Lathan).   He shakes up what could have been a
smooth and blissful reunion when an advance copy of soon-to-be-published
novel--not-so-loosely based on his and his friends' dirty little
secrets--makes the rounds within this tightly-knit circle. 
This is the film's one aggravating contrivance.  Harper did not see any
harm in airing his personal dirty laundry in the book because it was
scheduled to be released after the big reunion at the wedding and hence
wouldn't have to face everyone about it--or endanger Lance and Mia's
impending nuptials.  In the latter respect, it's understandable why he
would not want his friends did not see the book until its release, but
even once the two are wed, they and the others would eventually get upset
with him anyway.  And Harper is presented as someone who values
friendship, not to mention a great writer; he is mentioned to be set for
an appearance on _Oprah_ for his book.  With the plot of his book so
closely mirroring his real-life past, Harper doesn't appear to be that
imaginative an author.
But one doesn't dwell on the issue since Lee's own writing and execution
is energetic and entertaining.  _The_Best_Man_ may be named for one
character, but this is an ensemble film in the best sense, with all the
characters each given their moments to shine and doing so brilliantly. 
In fact, Harper is perhaps the least interesting of the bunch; far more
amusing are the smooth, smug womanizer Quentin and the shrewish Shelby,
both played to perfection by Howard and DeSousa.  This is not to say that
the two most central players, Diggs and Long, fail to hold their own;
blessed with talent and chemistry to match their good looks, they make
for very captivating and likable leads.
As many times as I laughed during _The_Best_Man_, what I remember most
clearly are the sweet and more serious moments.  While the scandal of
Harper's book is the engine of the film, its heart lies in love and
fidelity--not just to lovers, but also to friends.  The resolution to one
of the plot threads may be a disappointment to some audiences, but it
ends on the right note, and Lee must be commended for not going for the
cheaply crowd-pleasing twist.  In any event, any dissatisfaction is
completely erased by the closing dance number--a perfect delight of a
capper to a perfectly delightful film.

Title
Review for Tigerland (2000)
Long considered synonymous with empty Hollywood razzle dazzle, director
Joel Schumacher seems increasingly determined to prove his artistic
worth.  After getting down-and-dirty with last year's lurid (and little
else) _8MM_, Schumacher returns with an even more unlikely--and blatantly
"different"--project: the Dogme 95-inspired (!) Vietnam War (!!) film
_Tigerland_.  The resulting film isn't as disastrous as one would expect,
but it's likely not going to reverse any negative opinions of the
filmmaker.
In fact, _Tigerland_ will only reinforce one of the biggest complaints
regarding Schumacher's work: that it's all about the look, not the
material.  The herky-jerky handheld camera work, grainy images, and
all-natural lighting borrowed from the Danish manifesto of cinematic
"chastity" plus the cast of largely unrecognizable faces lends the film
an air of authenticity, but only that--an "air," as inert and superficial
as the term suggests.  The same can also be said about Ross Klavan and
Michael McGruther's screenplay.
Although in essence a Vietnam War story, the film ends right as its
focal group of soldiers is shipped off to 'Nam, focusing instead on the
stateside training of a bunch of young grunts, whose grueling experience
culminates at the Louisiana-based simulated combat zone of Tigerland. 
Klavan, an Army veteran, used his real-life Tigerland training experience
as a foundation for the script, and the day-to-day grind of the training
as depicted rings true: the harsh verbal and physical abuse inflicted by
the superiors; the petty tensions that arise between soldiers.  But this
is nothing that hasn't already been shown in countless other war films,
and after a while these scenes blend into each other, and one is forced
to look deeper to maintain interest--and what one finds is a trite,
hollow center.
_Tigerland_ is pretty much the story of Privates Bozz (Colin Farrell)
and Paxton (Matthew Davis), who bond and become best friends during
training at Fort Polk, Louisiana sometime in 1971.  Paxton is a wannabe
writer who wants to go to war for the mere experience of it.  Bozz, on
the other hand, wants out of the army, and his frequent acts of
disobedience increasingly run him afoul of his superiors and some fellow
trainees, namely Private Wilson (Shea Whigham).  And... that's about it. 
Paxton is continually exposed to the brutal reality of war; Bozz
continually rebels by cooking up excuses for others to get discharged and
making smartass remarks to anyone within earshot--which prompts angry
looks from the likes of Wilson.  Drama?  I think not.
But there is a diamond in the rough of _Tigerland_, and that is Farrell.
 A talented newcomer with genuine presence, Farrell is able to suggest
some complexity in a character that is written without any (which is the
case with just about every single role).   He is a true find whose
promise should be more fully realized in films far better than
_Tigerland_.

Title
Review for Life (1999)
"Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence are making the most out of _Life_."
It's a fairly standard tagline, but it speaks more than perhaps its writer
intended.  Indeed, the well-matched pair make the most of what the makers
of _Life_ give them, but what the material they are given isn't nearly as
inspired as they are.
The combination of two comic firecrackers such as Murphy and Lawrence
should add up to something explosively funny, and they do have their choice
moments as New Yorkers Ray Gibson and Claude Banks, respectively, who are
given a lifetime sentence in a Mississippi prison work camp for a murder
they did not commit.  It sounds rife with comic potential, but for some
reason writers Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone, along with director Ted
Demme aren't content with _Life_ being a breezy comic lark.  No, it also
has to hold some dramatic weight as well.
Granted, life imprisonment, let alone _wrongful_ life imprisonment, is no
walk in the park.  But serious touches such as one inmate's self-sacrifice
fail to register because there's no real emotional connection to the
audience--to the story or the characters.  Ray and Claude are likable
enough, but the audience has no emotional investment in them; viewers just
want to see do more of their comic sparring.  The attempts at drama do add
some weight, all right--as in weighing down and slowing the proceedings,
not adding psychological or emotional heft.
That said, when given the chance to strut their comedic stuff, Murphy 
and Lawrence do not disappoint.  Murphy does his tried-and-true smart aleck
routine, but Lawrence goes against type somewhat by playing a complete
square, and he comes off a bit too whiny at times.  Nonetheless, the two
have a natural ease with each other (as shown in their last film together,
1992's _Boomerang_), and a number of scenes strike sparks.
But there aren't enough of these sparks to make the film ignite.  The
preview audience with whom I saw the film seemed rather content with the
film, and their feelings could very well be mirrored in multiplex
auditoriums across the country this weekend.  But for me, _Life_, given the
raw comedic talent and energy at its disposal, simply doesn't have enough
life to it.

Title
Review for Nightwatch (1998)
With two hot young stars (Ewan McGregor and Patricia Arquette), a stylish
director, and a creepy premise based on a popular Danish thriller,
Nightwatch built some buzz... back in October 1996, when it was originally
slated to surface in theatres.  A year and a half and many scrapped release
dates later, Nightwatch is finally set to make its long-delayed screen bow,
and this flat, predictable chiller will likely come and go so quickly some
will wonder if it ever did come out.
The ever-amiable Scot McGregor struggles with an American accent as law
student Martin Bells, who bravely accepts the nightwatchman gig at a morgue
as a serial killer stalks the city.  After more bodies and plot twists pile
up, Martin finds himself the prime suspect in the case, earning the
suspicion of his girlfriend Katherine (Arquette, completely wasted in the
screaming galpal role), his best friend James (Josh Brolin), and police
inspector Cray (Nick Nolte) as the real killer continues his rampage.
Writer-director Ole Bornedal, adapting his 1995 original, is a natural at
creating atmosphere.  Martin's first few scenes in the morgue, with its
creaky elevator, long hallway, locked room with vats of body parts, and
stark white room with alarm cords hanging over the dead bodies (in case
they "wake up") are downright skincrawling.  Ironically, this grim,
daunting atmosphere of fear and dread disappears when the serial killer
plot comes to the forefront.  This is mainly because the so-called mystery
is so incredibly predictable.  One character is set so obviously set up as
a possibility early on that the person might as well have "red herring"
tattooed on the forehead, and when the killer's identity is revealed, it's
an anticlimax--there is no surprise.  And the overdone climax, with the
killer wielding a buzzsaw as two characters lie helplessly tied to
operating tables, inspired guffaws rather than shrieks from the audience.
According to the press notes, Bornedal's original Nightwatch "broke all
Danish box-office records."  I can only hope that that version is much
scarier than the American Nightwatch, or else Denmark's cinematic taste is
just about as notoriously bad as France's.  (opens April 17)

Title
Review for Rush Hour 2 (2001)
_Rush_Hour_2_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
        _Rush_Hour_2_ is a textbook case of commerce over art, of retreading
over reinvention.  Yet there is something to be said about having a second try
at something that didn't quite work the time out, for derivative and disposable
as it is, this latest go-round with mismatched buddy cops Jackie Chan and Chris
Tucker is a more satisfying light entertainment.
        The original _Rush_Hour_ certainly had its moments, but it had one
central failing: the refusal to let Jackie be Jackie; when the world-famous
martial arts superstar's biggest showpiece in the film is not a fight scene but
a simple slide down a banner, something is clearly amiss.  What fights there
were lacked the creative flavor of his Hong Kong works--making the fact that the
film was Chan's first true stateside blockbuster all the more unfortunate.
        The first big showpiece in _Rush_Hour_2_ shows the situation being
remedied, with Chan's Inspector Lee chasing some baddies while weaving through a
bamboo scaffold.  Later scenes show an even stronger feel for Chan's style, with
the fights featuring his trademark "everything and the kitchen sink" way of
using anything within arm's reach as a weapon.  This being an American (read:
sanitized) production, the action set pieces don't come close to the audacity of
his HK films, but coming after the tepid displays in the original _Rush_Hour_,
they get the job done well enough.
        What of the plot?  Returning director Brett Ratner and writer Jeff
Nathanson don't offer much of an answer.  The film begins just days after the
end of the first, with Lee and LAPD detective James Carter (Tucker) in Hong
Kong.  Carter just wants a relaxing vacation, but naturally that isn't in the
cards as Lee gets him entangled in some not-terribly-interesting business
involving Triad gangs.  Disappointingly, _Rush_Hour_2_ doesn't make much of the
inverse fish-out-of-water scenario it begins on, for before long the duo's
investigation leads them back to U.S. soil--first L.A., then Las Vegas.
        Chan and Tucker's off-kilter chemistry is even more playfully amusing
here, with Chan actually getting the opportunity to deliver some laugh lines
this time.  Of course, the brunt of the comedic burden is carried by Tucker, and
while arguments that he is too loud even by his own standards do hold water
(even if he doesn't come close to what is heretofore his most shrill and
overdone work--his grating performance in Luc Besson's _The_Fifth_Element_), his
timing and ease with a wisecrack deliver the goods.
        The lack of a strong plot means a shortchanging of those playing the
villainous element, particularly _Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_ star Zhang
Ziyi.  It goes without saying that her role here isn't nearly as demanding as
that of Jen Yu, and hence she is more than up to the diminished task here: look
hot in black leather and kick some ass.  Granted, she is more effectively used
than I had initially feared (I was thinking all of her scenes were those in the
trailer), but it is a let down to see that her acting chops don't get much of a
workout.
        But, in all fairness, do anyone's ever get a workout in a Ratner film? 
After all, the most anyone can hope for when seeing his name attached to a film
is a diverting enough slab of slick Hollywood hackwork--and, indeed,
_Rush_Hour_2_ is that.  Chan does his thing; Tucker does his, and everyone who
buys a ticket gets exactly what they paid to see--which is more than can be said
of a number of other popcorn entertainments this summer.

Title
Review for Evita (1996)
Who knew?  After torturing moviegoers for the past decade with awful
performances in sometimes even worse movies, Madonna actually proves to be a
capable screen actress in what a number of audience members at the media
screening declared "the best film of the year."  While I don't think quite
as highly of it, Alan Parker's long-awaited film version of Andrew Lloyd
Webber and Tim Rice's celebrated stage musical/rock opera Evita is
nonetheless a remarkable cinematic achievement--a brisk, involving, and
highly entertaining spectacle that could breathe new life into the dead
genre of the movie musical.
Evita follows the meteoric rise and fall of Eva Duarte Peron
(Madonna), a girl from the Argentina countryside who dreams of fame and
fortune in the big city.  A liaison with tango singer Augustin Magaldi
(Jimmy Nail) is her ticket to "B.A.--Buenos Aires--Big Apple," where she
climbs up the social ladder and carves out a career as a model and actress
by winning and then discarding useful lovers.  Her most useful conquest
turns out to be Juan Peron (Jonathan Pryce), who marries Eva and is soon
elected president.  As First Lady of Argentina, Eva wins the love of the
nation and all the riches she ever dreamed of, but her flame is ultimately
blown out in 1952, when, at the age of 33, she succumbs to uterine cancer.
Evita the show has a reputation for portraying one of the most
beloved figures in Argentinean history as a scheming viper hungry for fame
and fortune.  While the film does not shy away from this angle, it is just
one side of her persona; Eva as a whole is painted as a very complex figure.
Her accomplishments for her country (grant women the right to vote, the
openings of new hospitals, her giving money to the poor, etc.) are duly
noted, and she does have a vulnerable side.  Her obsessive drive to be
famous is really more of a need for acceptance, something she never received
as a child.  We first see Eva as a girl all of 7 years old, forbidden to
attend her father's funeral because she was the product of an extramarital
affair.  That scene is revisited more than once during the course of the
film, and it serves as a reminder as how the dream began and how the woman
came to be.  Eva's sensitive side does shine through in other moments,
especially in the lovely lament "Another Suitcase in Another Hall," which
she sings after Magaldi turns her back on her soon after arriving in Buenos
Aires (in the stage production, the tune is sung by another character); and
most notably near the end, where you can sense her emptiness and the feeling
that the dream had grown into something more than she could bear.
The effectiveness of those dramatic moments is due in no small part
to Madonna's startling performance.  Granted, she is in her element in this
film, taking on a role that is almost entirely sung, but there is more to
her work than her stronger-than-ever voice.  In all her other films, she is
so overwrought and in-your-face that she might as well have worn a sign that
read "Look at me!  I'm Madonna, and I'm ACTING!"  Here, she is surprisingly
restrained, and as a result her acting feels natural.  It is that
naturalness that enables her to make an emotional connection with the
audience, something she has never been able to accomplish before.  Usually a
Madonna death scene in a movie is met with laughter (or walkouts); this time
around there was silence, save for the sniffling that could be heard
throughout the auditorium.  After this film, she should retire from film
acting; I don't see her ever topping her astonishing work here.
Madonna would likely not have been able to pull off her career-best
work without the stellar talent around and behind her.  The liveliest
performance comes from Antonio Banderas, who plays the floating narrator
Che.  His perpetually unamused and cynical presence and viciously
snarled vocals give the film a welcome edge and prevent it from taking
itself too seriously.  Tony Award winner Pryce adds some maturity and polish
to the whole affair as only a theater vet can.  But most of the kudos go to
director-producer-co-scripter (with Oliver Stone) Parker, who keeps the
action moving briskly while allowing time for quieter moments.  The film is
quite the visual spectacle; the numerous scenes of chaos are well-staged;
the flashy editing serves the story well; and the scenes set at the balcony
of the Casa Rosada, where the Perons address the hordes of extras standing
below, are real stunners.  To quote Che, "The best show in town was the
crowd outside the Casa Rosada crying 'Eva Peron!'"  Parker's one misstep is
his tendency to crank up Webber's score to the max, which too often obscures
Che's expository lyrics, which, in turn, are already somewhat obscured by
Banderas's accent.
The movie musical is dead, and I doubt Evita will be its
resurrection; I'm not so certain that contemporary moviegoers are ready for
films where characters periodically break into song, let alone sing
throughout the entire film.  But if any film is to revive the movie musical,
it will be Evita, for its haunting melodies, strong performances, and
overall passion has the potential to reach even the most skeptical
mainstream moviegoer.

Title
Review for 8MM (1999)
As his follow-up to the candy-colored camp catastrophe that was
_Batman_&_Robin_, director Joel Schumacher has gone to the opposite extreme
with the lurid thriller _8MM_.  Schumacher obviously intended this
down-and-dirty film to cleanse his artistic soul, and while _8MM_ certainly
is better than that infamous franchise killer (then again, what wouldn't
be?), the film is grainy and unfocused as the object at the center of the
plot.
That object is a so-called "snuff" film, a pornographic work in which the
woman is killed.  The film is found in the safe of a recently deceased
millionaire, and private detective Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is hired by
the millionaire's widow (Myra Carter) to investigate its origin and track
down the family of the young girl who was brutally killed in it.
The mystery is just a perfunctory device for screenwriter Andrew Kevin
Walker to get to his main concern, which is the psychological effects Tom
feels takes when he becomes immersed in the seedy world of underground
porn.  But did it have to be so perfunctory?  Walker doesn't even bother to
hide the fact that it is a mere device.  The mystery is more or less
resolved in an overblown sequence that comes at the end of act two, and the
revelations are contrived and incredibly underwhelming.  While that may be
some sort of sly in-joke on Walker's part, to the viewer, it is simply an
unsatisfying cheat.
But once the mystery is out of the way, and Walker frees himself to zero
in on Tom's psyche, the movie does get better, and it finally gives Cage
something meaty to work with.  The pain and anguish of his downward spiral
are acutely felt through Cage's chillingly convincing performance.  But by
this point, the movie is nearly over, with two-thirds of it having been
spent on characters plot mechanics that, for the most part, bear little to
no weight in the end.
_8MM_ is a competent attempt by Schumacher to reclaim his directorial
voice after suffering the grind of a blockbuster studio franchise.  Yet
while a directorial voice does rings throughout _8MM_, it is not
Schumacher's--rather, it's that of David Fincher, helmer of Walker's
_Se7en_; Schumacher apes his style from the ample rain to the deliberate
pacing.  _8MM_ may indeed be a step up from Schumacher's last film, but he
still has a few more steps to go before recapturing his own artistic identity.

Title
Review for Conspiracy Theory (1997)
Conspiracy Theory (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
        Mel Gibson plays a paranoid, downright crazy New York cab driver
obsessed with the idea of conspiracies.  Suddenly, he finds himself the
target of shady government types, apparently because one of his theories is
true.  On the run for his life, only a Justice Department investigator
(Julia Roberts) can help him.  Sounds like a strange cross between Lethal
Weapon, Taxi Driver, and The Pelican Brief, and, for about half of its
running time, Richard Donner's Conspiracy Theory does play as such.
However, one wishes that Donner and company had remained on that track, for
the film quickly degenerates into a murky mess that grows more hopelessly
convoluted with each passing minute.
        What makes Conspiracy Theory initially interesting--and
promising--is Gibson's wacked-out cabbie, Jerry Fletcher.  There are
paranoid people and then there are people like Jerry, who even keeps his
refrigerator and its contents under lock and key (one of the more inspired
sight gags are the combination-locked jugs of coffee and pudding).  Gibson,
a proven pro at playing off-kilter characters, is so much fun to watch that
we are interested when the contrived plot surfaces.  Jerry voices his wild
theories in a self-published newsletter (which lends the film its title), so
when some government agents led by the mysterious Dr. Jonas (an underused
Patrick Stewart) start chasing him, Jerry, his "friend" Alice Sutton
(Roberts, well-cast), and the audience are led to believe that one of his
wild ideas is indeed true.
        Alas, if only it were that simple.  Certainly, the scenario
initially set up by writer Brian Helgeland is contrived, but at the very
least it was easy to follow, and Donner directs the proceedings with an
energetic urgency.  But, as it turns out, it's nothing more than a red
herring.  Midway through a couple of new, complex plot elements are brought
to the forefront: the long-ago murder of Alice's judge father and, most
regrettably, a left-field development involving (yes) mind control.  This
twist would not have been as bothersome if it made some sense, but it never
does, nor is everything clearly, satisfactorily explained.  The way in which
Conspiracy Theory hooks viewers with its questions (and fascinating
protagonist) and then loses them with its answers more than recalls the
recent thriller Smilla's Sense of Snow, even if the outlandishness of the
plot "secrets" is not as awful as that of the half-baked Smilla.
        Conspiracy Theory marks Gibson and Donner's fifth collaboration
(following the three Lethal Weapons and Maverick)--and their least
satisfying one.  As it is, the film is a mildly diverting piece of popcorn
entertainment, but it would have gone down a lot more smoothly had it not
been too "clever" for its own good.

Title
Review for In Crowd, The (2000)
_The_In_Crowd_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
"What would you do to get in?"  Apparently not much at all--that is, if
Warner Bros.' poster for _The_In_Crowd_ is posing the question to
audiences in reference to seeing this youth-aimed thriller.  At the
showing I attended in the middle of a very hot summer afternoon, there
were only about 15 people in the auditorium, including myself.  Still,
that's about 15 more people than will show up a week for now, for it
won't be long before this sloppy, predictable potboiler finds itself
completely on the outs with paying moviegoers.
We first meet heroine Adrien (Lori Heuring) as she is being discharged
from St. Anastasia's, a mental institution.  (The reasons for her stay is
one of the film's not-terribly-enticing mysteries.)  Thanks to a kindly
doctor (Daniel Hugh Kelly), Adrien gets a job at a swank country club
that's a popular summer hangout among the elite college crowd.  While
most of this "in crowd" turn up their nose at Adrien, the group's
ringleader, "luscious brunette" Brittany (Susan Ward) takes a
surprisingly immediate liking to Adrien.
Of course, the reasons for Brittany's interest in Adrien are shrouded in
secrecy, and once they are revealed, audiences will have trouble either
keeping themselves from rolling their eyes or stifling a yawn.  But for a
while, director Mary Lambert and writers Mark Gibson and Philip Halprin
suggest something a bit more provocative.  The two initially bond after
Brittany fakes a suicide attempt in a pool, and Adrien "saves" her with
some mouth-to-mouth.  Later, Brittany bails Adrien out of trouble with
her boss by implying she had her hands full--with her.  Then on a hot
night on the dance floor, the two seem a lot more interested in getting
down with each other than a guy who manages to squeeze his way between
them.
But this is a PG-13 movie, so this bit of shameless (and, I must admit,
rather amusing) audience pandering doesn't go quite far enough to give
the entire film a kinky watchability.  Before long, Brittany spies Adrien
having coffee with the hunky tennis pro (Matthew Settle) she'd had her
eye on, and suddenly all the warnings Adrien had been given about
Brittany's true nature  appear justified.  People start to have
mysterious accidents, and Adrien finds herself in danger of being sent
back to the loony bin.
Theoretically, _The_In_Crowd_ should build some momentum at this point,
but the plotting is so pedestrian and the execution generally so ho-hum
that it's impossible to care.  So one is left to savor the few guilty
pleasures available: some campy catfighting between Adrien and Brittany,
and the lightly entertaining performance of _Sunset_Beach_ alumna Ward,
who plays a vixen with verve.  Like the others, there's no real meat to
the character of Brittany (the fact that one of her defining
characteristics is a weakness for lip gloss says it all), but at least
Ward has some fun with her part.
Moviegoers, however, will find it just about impossible to have much fun
with _The_In_Crowd_.  It's fairly slow-moving, and after a long buildup,
the promised thrills never arrive.  Unfortunately for Warner Bros., the
hoped-for teen audience will never arrive, either.

Title
Review for Bubble Boy (2001)
_Bubble_Boy_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
        Tinseltown has always been guilty of questionable, for lack of a better
term, "creative" decisions.  Look no further than the last couple of weeks at
the movies for proof: Because no one asked for it, Freddie Prinze Jr. adds yet
another to his inexplicable string of starring vehicles; and an inordinate
amount of money and valuable energy continues to be expended on the wasteful
task of trying to make Penelope Cruz a household name (Memo to producers and Ms.
Cruz's publicist: it's _not_ gonna happen).  As it turns out, these annoyances
were just a warm-up of sorts for the ultimate bafflement, one that will leave
the most jaded Hollywood observer with a Prinze-like look of bug-eyed,
slack-jawed shock: _Bubble_Boy_.
        Watching the trailer or any TV spots for _Bubble_Boy_, it's easy to
stare in mouth-agape disbelief.  Now, making a comedy that involves a young man
stricken with an immune deficiency is not unheard of; after all, one of the most
memorable episodes of _Seinfeld_ involved a "bubble boy."  The difference with
this film, however, is its relentlessly mocking tone.  The plot is obviously
designed for the audience to sympathize with the innocent Jimmy (Jake
Gyllenhaal), who ventures into the outside world for the first time to make a
cross-country trek to stop the wedding of the nice girl (Marley Shelton) he
loves.  But the level of humor pitched by director Blair Hayes and writers Cinco
Paul and Ken Daurio runs counter to any such aim; that viewers are supposed to
laugh at the wide-eyed Jimmy every time he stumbles and/or bounces in his bubble
suit--and that happens a lot--says it all.
        Not content to leave worse enough alone, Hayes and the writers
apparently decided to pack in as many unfunny and potentially offensive jokes in
Jimmy's journey as possible.  Jimmy's ultra-conservative Christian mother
(Swoosie Kurtz), who is singlehandedly responsible for Jimmy's heretofore
extremely sheltered existence, is but one of the insulting caricatures that
appear in _Bubble_Boy_.  There's also a Latino biker (Danny Trejo) who teaches
Jimmy some Spanish terms that he can later butcher for "humorous" effect; a
Hindu ice cream/curry salesman (Brian George) who gets all worked up when a cow
becomes road kill; and a bar full of Chinese men whose "funny" accents are
mocked.  Are we laughing yet?  If not, there are bits involving a little person
(played by Mini Me himself, Verne Troyer) being treated like a baby because of
his size.  Ha ha ha.
        To be fair, _Bubble_Boy_ does boast one laugh.  Not so surprisingly,
though, it has nothing to do with the writing, directing, or performances.  In
the midst of a really bizarre subplot (a welcome, if still unfunny, change of
pace from the tastelessness evidenced in all the other plot threads) involving a
sing-songy cult, there is a brief glimpse of the group's leader, played by...
everyone's favorite I Can't Believe It's Not Butter pitchman, Fabio.  Perhaps
the casting director should take up screenwriting or directing, for that faint
glimmer of inspiration is the sole one in the abysmal abomination known as
_Bubble_Boy_.

Title
Review for Butcher Boy, The (1997)
The Butcher Boy (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
No film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as Neil
Jordan's harrowing, humorous, horrifying adaptation of Patrick McCabe's
novel about young lad Francie Brady's (Eamonn Owens) descent into madness
in 1960s Ireland.  On one hand, it was difficult for me to become invested
in Francie's story because he is such an unsavory character, unjustifyably
venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor Mrs. Nugent
(Fiona Shaw).  On another hand, I found it difficult to laugh at some of
Francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick,
needy child, having been raised by a drunken father (Stephen Rea) and a
suicidal mother (Aisling O'Sullivan).  On yet another hand, I also found it
difficult to completely sympathize with Francie during his more emotional
scenes because some of his, for lack of a better word, "bad" deeds are so
incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he
performs them.
However, The Butcher Boy's power is undeniable, and the film as a whole is
unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing.  What makes it so
unsettling is the Francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude
about everything, expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by
the adult Francie (Rea again).  Think Heavenly Creatures played largely for
laughs, and you'll sort of understand.  Anchoring the whole film is the
astonishing debut performance of Owens; love Francie or hate him, you
cannot take your eyes off of Owens.  The Butcher Boy truly is a twisted,
unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable.  In the
lobby after the screening, I overheard one man raving about how great yet
disturbing it was; I also heard one particularly offended woman say with
disgust, "That movie was SO UNFUNNY!"

Title
Review for Switchblade Sisters (1975)
In recent years, the exploitation film--cheap, sensationalist
no-budget offerings filled with violence, sex, nudity, and horrific
acting--have been relegated to direct-to-video status.  The resurfacing of
Jack Hill's 1975 Switchblade Sisters, reissued by Quentin Tarantino's
Rolling Thunder division of Miramax, shows that this genre's true home is on
the big screen, where its hilarious, immensely enjoyable camp charms can be
shared with an audience.
The basic premise of Switchblade Sisters is a power struggle within
the girl gang the Dagger Debs between leader Lace (Robbie Lee, whose squeaky
Lori Petty voice and ferocious line delivery make an interesting
contradiction) and newcomer Maggie (Joanne Nail).  But to leave it at that
would to discount the surprisingly inspired plotting by screenwriter F.X.
Maier, who weaves a complex web of gang wars both between gangs and within
them; in fact, one-eyed Dagger Deb Patch's (Monica Gayle) psychological
manipulation of Lace more than recalls Iago's scheming in Othello.  This is
not so say, however, that the exploitation staples aren't in abundance, and
they are: there are the requisite violent action scenes, including a rousing
street gunfight, a roller rink shootout, and a killer closing knife fight;
there more than a share of hilarious, quotable lines (my fave being "If you
go, it's gonna turn out bad!"; and the acting is as uproariously
over-the-top as can be imagined.  The opening half hour, in which the Debs
are arrested and spend time in jail with an abusive lesbian guard, is so
hilarious, so trashy, and so utterly enjoyable that it truly must be seen to
be believed.
Unlike recent howlfests such as Judge Dredd and, most notably,
Showgirls, the filmmakers are very self-aware, knowing they are making fun
trash.  Director Hill keeps his tongue firmly in cheek, tossing in throwaway
bits, such as a guy who suddenly drops his head onto a table, that show he's
far from playing it with a straight face.  The free rein he gives to his
thespians is not a sloppy move, but a deliberate, defendable choice--the
actors are, after all, playing histrionic teens (though the actresses look
well into their 20s, the actors over 30).  Camp sensibility aside, Hill is
also an efficient filmmaker, keeping the action moving and telling the
complicated story clearly and swiftly.  Switchblade Sisters is rather short,
but it certainly doesn't feel that way (but not necessarily slow) once it's
over because so much was compacted into a mere 90 minutes.  It is also
important to note that while this is an "exploitation" film, Hill shows an
unexpected restraint, leaving the most violent or "naughty" bits to the
imagination.  The fact that the film still satisfies as "exploitation" is
another testament to Hill's skill.
A number of people won't understand the appeal of Switchblade
Sisters, but those with a healthy appetite for fun, campy, exploitative
trash are sure to get their money's worth.

Title
Review for Hurlyburly (1998)
The ensemble cast of Anthony Drazan's screen take on David Rabe's
celebrated play is uniformly excellent, led by Sean Penn, who reprises
his stage role as Eddie, a drugged-out Hollywood casting director headed
quickly down the road of self-destruction.  Filling out the very capable
ensemble are Kevin Spacey, Meg Ryan, Chazz Palminteri, Robin Wright Penn,
and the usually irksome Garry Shandling and Anna Paquin.
So what is the film _about_?  Not much at all, by my evaluation.  The
trailer for _Hurlyburly_ defines the term as "tumultuous commotion,
uproar," and it could not more aptly describe this high-strung but
virtually plotless film.  The movie is merely a collection of scenes
where a bunch of frantic Tinseltown losers such as Eddie talk, talk, and
talk some more, sometimes in English so overly complex that it's hard to
tell if any of these people, let alone the audience, know what they're
talking about.  Keeping the audience at an even further distance is
Drazan's stagy direction, which fails to sufficiently open the play up
for the screen.  But the film is not without its rewards, in particular
the work of Penn, who makes Eddie's meltdown compelling, even though it
is not particularly involving.

Title
Review for Ravenous (1999)
In his review of the 1993 cannibalism-for-survival drama _Alive_,
_Entertainment_Weekly_ critic Owen Gleiberman called the moment when the
plane crash survivors finally decide to eat the remains of the dead
passengers "truly disgusting."  In these eyes, it was an undoubtedly
discomfiting but rather tame moment, with most of the grisliness left to
the imagination; it only got as bad as seeing arms moving as if cutting
into something and the slices of, um, meat.
If that's Gleiberman's idea of "truly disgusting," I'm interested in
hearing what he has to say about _Ravenous_, which opens with a table full
of hungry 19th Century army men voraciously digging into extra-rare slabs
of meat, which leads one soldier, John Boyd (Guy Pearce), to lose his lunch
and just about any other meal he's ever had.  OK, so they're not eating
humans--they're eating beef.  But it gives one a fair inkling of how
graphic the "food" consumption gets once the cannibalism theme takes over.
After narrowly escaping death in a battle in the Mexican War, Boyd is
assigned to a remote outpost in the Sierra Nevadas manned only by Hart
(Jeffrey Jones), the commanding officer; Toffler (Jeremy Davies, doing the
soft-spoken thing yet again), the religious leader; Knox (Stephen
Spinella), the hard-drinking doctor; no-nonsence Reich (Neal McDonough);
and Cleaves (David Arquette), the over-medicated cook.  Entering their fold
one night is the mysterious loner Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle), who tells a
horrific tale about how his now-dead settling party turned to cannibalism
in the wilds.  In due time, the human flesh diet starts to gain popularity
with this group.
_Ravenous_ is definitely not for the squeamish.  Director Antonia Bird
pulls no punches as far as gore is concerned; one especially graphic scene
between Pearce and Arquette is certain to send some viewers racing to the
restroom, and a climactic bloodbath of a fight scene really pushes the
limits of an R-rating.  But Bird's tongue is often in cheek during the gory
proceedings; the over-the-top nature, while sure to offend many, is
actually the big factor in keeping one from taking it overly seriously.
Screenwriter Ted Griffin is also in on the joke, offering some amusingly
self-aware lines ("It's lonely being a cannibal.  It's tough making
friends.")  But his script accomplishes the seemingly impossible task of
being overstuffed and undercooked at the same time.  He offers a mystical
explanation for all the cannibalism, which then launches into metaphors
about addiction and the quest for eternal youth--this all in addition to
trying to be a down-and-dirty horror film.  But then there's the matter of
characterization, which there is little of; with only schematically
developed personalities onscreen, there's no real audience investment as to
who ends up being the diner or dinner.
I cannot say that I was ever bored by _Ravenous_; the actors and its
deliciously disgusting subject matter always keep it watchable and--dare I
say it--amusing.  There's nothing wrong with that, but in attempting to be
something more, _Ravenous_ ends up offering even less to chew on.

Title
Review for eXistenZ (1999)
For all its awe-inspiring gee-wizardry, the common perception of virtual
reality remains as that of a rather cold, technical concept.  As seen in
reality and as depicted in the movies, VR enables one to do things one
would never otherwise be able to, but it pretty much boils down to doing
next to nothing: just lying still, with cumbersome gear strapped onto the
eyes and different places on the body.
Leave it to writer-director David Cronenberg to turn conventional
perception on its ear.  His latest film, _eXistenZ_, is indeed part of
the recent crop of VR-themed thrillers, but Cronenberg's take on the
concept is truly unlike anything ever seen.  _eXistenZ_ takes its name
from a virtual reality system created by Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason
Leigh), a world-famous game designer.  The virtual world explored in
eXistenZ--and, in turn, _eXistenZ_--is nothing particularly new or
visually spectacular: more or less, it's a duplication of the actual
world, except with seamless, if abrupt, shifts in time and place. 
Neither is Cronenberg's plot terribly ambitious.  Fundamentally, the
story simply has Allegra and her makeshift bodyguard Ted Pikul (Jude Law,
sporting a flawless Canadian accent) on the run from assassins who want
to see "the demoness Allegra" dead.  Eventually, the two retreat into
eXistenZ, a world that may actually be more "real" than the one they live
in.
Cronenberg's main concern, however, is not so much in the intentionally
video-game-thin story, but in the finer details, most notably in the
nature of the eXistenZ system itself.  There is no heavy headgear,
gloves, wires, or the like; in their place is a soft, kidney-shaped
GamePod, connected to an UmbyCord, which is exactly as it sounds: long,
thick, and fleshy.  It would be tempting to call the eXistenZ system
"biomechanical," but there's nothing "mechanical" or electronic about it;
the GamePod appears to be a natural living organism in itself, undulating
and gurgling as if it had a mind of its own.  Further blurring the line
between nature and technology is the GamePod's power source: the human
nervous system.  The UmbyCord is plugged into a BioPort, which is a hole
drilled into a player's lower back, tapping directly into the spinal
column.
Making the human body part of the equipment not only adds a certain
creepiness, but also a dimension of perverse eroticism.  Before being
inserted, both the tip of the UmbyCord and the BioPort must be moistened,
and when the BioPort is penetrated by the UmbyCord--or anything else, for
that matter--it gets visibly stimulated.  Mere connection does not mean
entrance into eXistenZ; one must also stroke the moist, nipple-like knobs
on the GamePod.  This sensual caressing of the GamePod goes on as one is
in the game.
The blatantly sexual overtones are just one bizarre detail of
Cronenberg's fascinating, if unsettling, vision.  There is a great deal
of gore in _eXistenZ_, most of all in Allegra and Ted's game, where
mutant amphibians figure prominently--or, rather, their remains.  Their
dead bodies are gruesomely mined for their innards, which are used to
build GamePods in a slaughterhouse called a Trout Farm; they also turn up
on the unappetizing menu of a Chinese restaurant.  The slimy stickiness
could easily be pegged as cheap sensationalism, but it plays an integral
and sometimes surprising part in Cronenberg's larger picture.
Playing a weaker part in that larger picture is the story, which, while
superficially engaging, never adds up to much.  I won't give away its
conclusion, which was met with some boos at my audience, but it
essentially reveals _eXistenZ_ as one big tease--which, I believe, is the
point.  What matters to Cronenberg is the imaginative trip on which his
film takes its audience and the eerie feeling of unease it leaves with
them at the end.  In that sense, _eXistenZ_, like its namesake, is one
big game, but it is definitely one worth playing--or, rather, one to be
played _by_.

Title
Review for Lethal Weapon 4 (1998)
Lethal Weapon 4 (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
>From the moment its rush production was announced, media and industry
pundits immediately pegged _Lethal_Weapon_4_ as a disaster waiting to
happen.  What these naysayers had forgotten was that the _Lethal_ series is
not one of the most successful action franchises in film history for
nothing, delivering all the requisite slam-bang thrills with appealing
actors and a generous dose of humor.  The _Lethal_s have a set formula, to
be certain, but even in this fourth go-round, the magic and charm is
definitely still there.
One of the reasons some had doubts about _Lethal_4_ is a bloated cast,
which had sunk last year's fourth entry in another successful Warner Bros.
franchise, the _Batman_ series.  And though the ongoing cast additions that
have characterized the _Lethal_ series have proven successful in previous
installments, on paper, it appeared that the core had reached critical mass
in _Lethal_4_.  The original's odd couple cop duo of wild and wacky Martin
Riggs (Mel Gibson) and straightlaced family man Roger Murtaugh (Danny
Glover) successfully became a trio with the addition of motormouthed money
launderer Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) in _Lethal_2_; that three made an improbably
seamless transition to four with _Lethal_3_'s introduction of daredevil
Internal Affairs officer Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), the female "lethal
weapon."  To bring the core ensemble to five is a highly
risky and impractical proposition, but screenwriter Channing Gibson
(working from a story by Jonathan Lemkin, Alfred Gough, and Miles Millar)
and series director Richard Donner decided to add wet-behind-the-ears cop
Lee Butters (Chris Rock) into the mix.  Initially, the strain of
accommodating a large ensemble shows.  After an entertaining
curtain-raising action scene involving Riggs and Murtaugh's encounter with
a flamethrower-wielding maniac comes the lengthy
introductions/reintroductions of the rest of the cast: not only Leo, Lorna,
and Butters, but also those who have lingered in the background throughout
the entire series: police captain Ed Murphy (Steve Kahan), police
psychologist Stephanie Woods (Mary Ellen Trainor), Murtaugh's wife Trish
(Darlene Love), their daughters Rianne (Traci Wolfe) and Carrie (Ebonie
Smith), and son Nick (Damon Hines).
However, what could have easily become tedious for fans of the series and
even newcomers is made enjoyable by what has become one of the _Lethal_
series' trademarks: humor (it is ironic that the rather dark Shane
Black-penned original, in which Riggs was despondent and suicidal,
gradually evolved into an action comedy series).  The seemingly misguided
addition of Butters also proves to be a fairly effective one.  Known to
everyone except Murtaugh, Butters is the father of Rianne's unborn child
_and_ her secret husband, which creates some predictable but no less funny
comedy of misunderstanding (Murtaugh interprets Butters's attention and
devotion to be something a bit deeper).  Butters's most notable
contribution, though, is serving as a formidable F-word-sparring partner
for Leo, whose new occupation as a private investigator (!) more
comfortably works him into the story than his real estate agent status in
_Lethal_3_.
So what exactly _is_ the story?  After our intrepid detective duo,
both now promoted to the rank of captain (a plot thread that doesn't
particularly lead anywhere), along with Leo, stumble upon a shipload of
illegal Chinese immigrants, they find out about a dastardly plan
orchestrated by an Asian Triad leader (Hong Kong action legend Jet Li,
making his American debut).  That's pretty much it, but the lack of story
is more than compensated by the presence of a terrific villain, the absence
of which was _Lethal 3_'s biggest problem.  Though his work here isn't
quite at the level as that of his Hong Kong works such as the
_Once_Upon_a_Time_in_China_ series, Li's high-flying martial arts
(choreographed by, among others, HK film director Corey Yuen) displays are
simply astounding, and he pulls of the none-too-easy task of stealing the
show; if
Li's ecstatic crowd reaction at the preview screening is any indication, he
will become an immediate audience favorite, paving the way for a bright
Hollywood future.
With such a large cast, someone is bound to get short shrift, and the
victim here, unfortunately, is Russo.  Lorna was by far _Lethal_3_'s most
inspired element, a Riggs love interest that was every bit his equal.  This
time around, however, Lorna is just about cleansed of the machisma that
made her so popular.  In a simply dumb move, the writing crew knocked her
up with Riggs's child, thus removing her from nearly all of the action.
Although she is given one (way too brief) fight scene, in effect she is
made into what Patsy Kensit played in _Lethal_2_--a token "girl" for Riggs.
 Lorna is never more sorely missed than in the climax; although Butters is
an amusing character, he doesn't click nearly as well as the third partner
because he doesn't quite hold his own in the action scenes.
Despite its flaws, what sells _Lethal_Weapon_4_ is the action, and
between a spectacular midfilm freeway chase to Li's amazing acrobatics, it
is definitely the thrill ride to beat this summer.  The film closes with a
photo album montage of cast and crew photos culled from all four _Lethal_s,
almost as if to close the book on the series.  But if Donner and company
can keep the _Lethal_ films as fun as all four have been, then there will
be plenty more images to add to the album in the future.  As the film's
final line goes, "We're family," and after four wildly exciting
entertainments, audiences will feel (if they don't already)
the same way about these characters and will want to return to them in the
years to come.

Title
Review for Gingerbread Man, The (1998)

The Gingerbread Man (R) *** (out of ****)
        John Grisham.  Robert Altman.  Kenneth Branagh.  This odd assemblage of
talent suggests a most unusual film, but there's just about nothing
unconventional about this thriller, which gets the formulaic job done--with
a considerable amount of style.  In the bestselling author's first story
written directly for the screen (the screenplay itself is written by Al
Hayes--a.k.a. Altman), cocky Savannah lawyer Rick Magruder (Branagh)
becomes romantically and professionally entangled with one Mallory Doss
(Embeth Davidtz), a young woman who is being stalked by her unstable
derelict father Dixon (Robert Duvall).  Rick succeeds in having him
committed, but he is sprung by his cronies just about as soon as he is
locked up, not only placing Mallory in danger but Rick and his family as well.
        Sounds like boilerplate Grisham, and that The Gingerbread Man is for all
of its twisty (yet predictable) way.  But what makes this one of the more
interesting Grisham thrillers is Altman, who leaves his indelible signature
under the familiar trimmings.  The film has a most daunting atmosphere,
created through a rich synthesis of stunning photography (by Chinese
cinematographer Changwei Gu) and haunting music (created electronically by
Mark Isham).  Altman's penchant for long takes and complex sound design are
also in evidence, as is his uncanny ability to attract a lot of solid
acting talent (in addition to Branagh, Duvall, and Davidtz, the cast
includes Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger, and Famke Janssen).
 None of these touches are surprising; what is--refreshingly so--is how
well Altman's distinct, idiosyncratic tools service the needs of as
straightforward an entertainment as a this.  In the end, The Gingerbread
Man may not be a slick crowdpleaser like A Time to Kill or The Rainmaker,
but it's the closest a Grisham film has come to approaching art.

Title
Review for Payback (1999)
Immediately after watching _Payback_, the friend with whom I attended the
screening came up with a snappy line: "_Payback_--where the good guys are
bad, and the bad guys are badder!"  Actually, an equally snappy and more
accurate line would be, "_Payback_--where the bad guys are bad, and the
good guys are even worse," for the "hero" of this offbeat and somewhat
amusing action thriller is arguably more evil than the "villains."
His name is Porter (Mel Gibson), a small-time hood who is swindled out of
$70,000 and left for dead by fellow crook Val (Gregg Henry) and Porter's
own junkie wife, Lynn (Deborah Kara Unger).  Of course, Porter improbably
recovers from his two potentially fatal gunshots to the back, and he takes
violent, often murderous, ends to even the score--or, at the very least,
get his $70,000.
Co-writer/director Brian Helgeland (who retains directing credit though
"creative differences" with Gibson prompted him to leave the project before
its completion) plays the rather scenario for a number of darkly
tongue-in-cheek laughs.  After all, who would go through so much
trouble--and take so much punishment himself--for such an absurdly low
figure?  Only someone as disturbed as Porter, whom Gibson plays with the
same manic, slightly off-kilter energy he always brings to his action roles.
Based on the above, _Payback_ sounds much lighter than it is--for all the
humor in it, the film is quite gritty and dark, reflected most obviously in
Emerson Core's often frustratingly grainy cinematography, which casts a
blue-gray wash over the entire film.  _Payback_ is extremely violent; I
would go so far as to say excessively so at certain points.  Even the
gung-ho male action fans who sat next to me were audibly shocked by some of
Porter's extremely brutal behavior--which he gets his own taste of in a
unsettling torture scene involving a sledgehammer.  There are a number of
sadomasochistic touches, courtesy of an Asian-mob-affliated dominatrix
(Lucy Liu, a long way from _Ally_McBeal_).  This brings me to another point
that will surely spark some controversy: the film's treatment of women.  A
touch of misogyny is expected in a macho action picture such as this, but
when the three prominent female characters--who, I might add, are just
about the _only_ females in the film--are two prostitutes (one being the
dominatrix, the other being Maria Bello's gold-hearted hooker/Porter love
interest) and a heroin addict, one could easily see that the fairer sex
gets a far from fair treatment.
One's enjoyment of _Payback_ essentially boils down to one's opinion of
Porter, and, to a certain degree, Gibson himself: depending on your view,
he can come off as either a badass or an asshole, with no in-between.  The
bulk of the audience with whom I saw the film appeared to think the former,
and, being a Gibson fan, I'm with them.  Nonetheless, I never was more than
amused by _Payback_, whose thin story never generates any genuine excitement.

Title
Review for Perfect Murder, A (1998)
The murder may be perfect, but Andrew Davis's loose update of Alfred
Hitchcock's 1954 classic _Dial_M_for_Murder_ is not even close.  Davis and
screenwriter Patrick Smith Kelly have come up with an interesting wrinkle
to Frederick Knott's original play: a wealthy industrialist (Michael
Douglas) wants to kill his adulterous heiress wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) for
the money, but in this version, the person he hires to do the job is the
lover himself (Viggo Mortensen).  Also, for the most part, Davis and Kelly
have successfully opened up the action of the original, which largely took
place on a single apartment set.
But, as is the case with too many remakes, the slick new take falls short.
 Generally speaking, Douglas, Paltrow, and Mortensen deliver passable
performances, but Douglas lacks the complexity of _Dial_M_'s Ray Milland;
he is a bit too one-note evil that it's hard to believe that anyone could
suspect anyone other than him (not helping are some obvious up-to-no-good
lines, such as this reply to Paltrow's request that a lunch date be
postponed until the next day: "What if there's no tomorrow?").
Nonetheless, Davis manages to generate some tension, yet this is squandered
by the uninspired finale, which bears the unmistakable fingerprints of
post-test screening retooling.  Watch closely, and you'll notice an
underscored detail that is not picked up on in the finale, much like how
the final, post-test version of _Fatal_Attraction_ lets a similar matter
dangle.

Title
Review for Impostors, The (1998)
_The_Impostors_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
The sophomore slump has hit actor-screenwriter-director Stanley Tucci with
this flat farcical follow-up to his auspicious 1996 filmmaking debut,
_Big_Night_ (which he co-helmed with Campbell Scott).  Tucci and Oliver
Platt play Arthur and Maurice, two starving actors in Depression-era New
York who unwittingly stow away onto a Paris-bound oceanliner after being
falsely accused of assault by a pompous Shakespearean hack-tor (Alfred
Molina).
In theory, _The_Impostors_ should come to life when Arthur and Maurice
find themselves on the cruise ship (which, of course, has their accuser as
one of the passengers).  However, that's where the film goes downhill.  The
film is at its best in the early going, during which the
acting-technique-obsessed Arthur and Maurice attempt to con their way to
free food; a wordless opening credits sequence harkens back to the best
silent comedy, and one hilarious scene in a bakery is, as it turns out, the
film's premature highlight.  The problem with the shipboard antics is that
only a handful of the eccentric array of passengers hold interest.  For
every inspired character and performance, such as Steve Buscemi's suicidal
cabaret singer and Campbell Scott's creepy German steward, there are duds
like a faux French con couple (Richard Jenkins and Allison Janney) and a
golddigging older woman (Dana Ivey).  The terrific timing and rapport
between Tucci and Platt keeps _The_Impostors_'s head above water, but just
barely.

Title
Review for Six Days Seven Nights (1998)
In recent years, Harrison Ford has been such a grave screen presence,
scowling through the likes of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series,
_The_Fugitive_, and last year's smash _Air_Force_One_, that one wonders if
the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained
from his system.  Apparently, it was just lying dormant.  With Ivan
Reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _Six_Days,_Seven_Nights_, the
lovable scoundrel is back, giving audiences a fresh reminder of why Ford is
one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons.
Ford plays Quinn Harris, a carefree and slightly slobby (endearingly so)
pilot in the Tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm, stranding
him and his charter, New York magazine editor Robin Monroe (Anne Heche), on
a deserted island.  Of course, the sophisticated Robin and the
salt-of-the-earth Quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down, and
all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their
first meeting.  While some of the lines fall flat, the formulaic motions
work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between Ford and Heche.
 Both actors, who have largely done serious works as of late, seem
liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders, and they
deliver their zingers, as weak as they sometimes are, with beguiling abandon.
Naturally, there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two
people together, and Quinn and Robin's warmup to each other is sped up even
further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates.  Granted, some
conflict needed to be introduced on the island, but this tacked-on
development from writer Michael Browning is a bit too obviously thrown in
for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes.  But the point is to
get the two together, and their newfound affection causes complications for
both, but mostly Robin, who came to the islands on a vacation with her
fiance Frank (David Schwimmer), who frantically awaits her return on the
home island.
Reitman, and old, reliable hand at breezy comedies, keeps the pace brisk
and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences.  His big
accomplishment, however, is bringing the old, smiling Ford back.  As
appealing and charismatic as he always is, Ford hasn't been quite this
charming and affable in years; he's obviously having a blast, and the
audience cannot help but have one along with him.  Holding her own is
Heche, whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she
initially promises to be (as the plane goes down, she frantically pops
stress pills).  She can take her lumps, physical and otherwise, just as
well as Quinn, making her a formidable foil and ideal match.
Formulaic and light as a feather, _Six_Days,_Seven_Nights_ could be cited
as a classic example of the summer "popcorn" movie season's lack of
substance.  It's certainly fluff, but it's unpretentious, undemanding,
and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina
colada on a balmy tropical beach.  Pass the popcorn.

Title
Review for Autumn in New York (2000)
        With such odious films as _Battlefield_Earth_ and _Coyote_Ugly_
meriting advance screenings for critics, speculation could not help but
reach a fevered pitch when MGM opted not to screen _Autumn_in_New_York_. 
Could this romantic drama featuring two established stars (Richard Gere
and Winona Ryder) and a very capable director (Joan Chen) be a big-name
bellyflop?  Or is it the gem whose plot "secrets" needed to be protected,
as according to the studio's official reason?  The answer, however, is
not nearly as intriguing as either of those extremes.  The genteel and
benign _Autumn_ is hardly the disaster cynics have dreaded, but this love
story is also hardly the all-stops-out tearjerker it strives to be.
        The latter fact stems from a fundamental conflict between the
sensibilities of the screenwriter and director.  Chen's auspicious debut
film, the stunning _Xiu_Xiu:_The_Sent-Down_Girl_, was an intrinsically
powerful story that packed an intensified emotional wallop through its
subtlety--which is not exactly the best match for the shameless
button-pusher that is Allison Burnett's script.  Will Keane (Gere) is a
restaurateur with a well-known reputation for womanizing.  When the
nubile young Charlotte Fielding (Winona Ryder) catches his eye and
expresses interest in return, Will doesn't see any reason why this affair
will be any different until his many others--that is, until she confesses
her terminal illness.  It seems like an ideal arrangement, the ladykiller
 who loves 'em and leaves 'em hooking up with a woman who has no
long-term prospects nor expectations.  But, of course, Cupid will not be
denied.
        Chen is able to give _Autumn_ some of the lyrical understatement
that she lent to _Xiu_Xiu_.  The tasteful love scenes do have a romantic
air; the images (captured by cinematographer Changwei Gu) are lush and
inviting, as is Gabriel Yared's score; and the big emotional moments are
not histrionic.  But this is, as written, a broadly formula exercise in
manipulation, and for it to achieve its desired weepy effect, there needs
to be a more forceful hand at work.  The material simply isn't strong nor
convincing enough on its own to wring tears by itself--and how could it,
given some of the awkward dialogue ("I can smell the moonlight!  When did
I learn to do that?" rhetorically inquires Charlotte before the first big
kiss).
        At least the script is brave enough to address the vast age
difference between Gere and Ryder, making for some of the film's more
amusing repartée.  Together, the pair neither smolder nor fizzle; there
is a compatibility, but not one overwhelming enough to make Will's
inevitable changes completely believable.  Individually, though, they
fare better: Gere can do the cocksure bit in his sleep, and Ryder
displays her natural incandescence (though it ultimately contradicts her
character's condition--she maintains a healthy glow even as things
gradually become more dire).
        Perhaps MGM's no-screening decision on _Autumn_in_New_York_ was
simply a way to get it more publicity than it otherwise would have. 
After all, it is still the season of larger, louder films, and something
this quiet--and unexceptionally so--would barely register with anyone.

Review for Hardball (2001)
        If Biggie Smalls weren't dead already, certainly the sight and sound of
Keanu Reeves murdering his hit "Big Poppa" not once, but twice in _Hardball_
would have done the job.  For the rest of us, sitting through the schmaltzfest
that is _Hardball_ amounts to a two-hour torture session that would make one
long for the great beyond.
        Watching Reeves lord over a boys' baseball team in a
_Bad_News_Bears_-ish comedy is a horrifying enough prospect, but _Hardball_ is
even more galling than what the misleading ad campaign sells it as: it's a
teary, inspirational sports drama.  But despite having the same early fall berth
and also featuring a name star above its title, _Hardball_ is no
_Remember_the_Titans_, the truly uplifting and moving blockbuster that starred
Denzel Washington--for reasons that go far beyond the lopsided Keanu vs. Denzel
argument.
        First and foremost is the lead character of Conor O'Neill.  Reeves'
lackluster performance aside (more on that later), Conor, who begins the film as
a compulsive gambler deep in debt to loan sharks, is hardly an interesting or
appealing "hero."  In exchange for a weekly check, a businessman friend (Mike
McGlone) makes Conor coach an inner city little league team, the Kekambas.  The
usual would-be heartwarming hokum ensues: Conor learns that there's more to life
than sports bets; the kids are inspired to win by Conor.
        Or are they?  Conor does a lot of things with the Kekambas, but one of
them is certainly not coaching.  The most he is shown doing during practice
sessions is hitting balls to outfielders.  He never gives anyone any pointers
except that it's important to show up.  Duh.  As such the Kekambas' winning ways
are completely their own doing, with very little to no help from Conor.  It's
staggering how director Brian Robbins and screenwriter John Gatins adapted a
book (by Daniel Coyle) about little league coaching by completely erasing just
about all trace of the practice.
        So _Hardball_ becomes one of those films where the African-Americans
make life better for the white man with little to no return, and the balance is
thrown even further with one especially manipulative late-inning turn.  But
Robbins starts making mawkish far earlier than that; any occurrence that can
make the slightest tug at a heartstring, such as a player not getting a team
T-shirt, is accompanied by a maudlin score cue.  The young cast is instructed to
pout for maximum effect whenever not hammering home their characters' single
defining quality, e.g. one player has to wear headphones and listen to "Big
Poppa" while pitching (hence setting the stage for Reeves' rickety renditions);
one kid who is actually too young to play nonetheless listens to Conor's sage
advice by showing up for every game and practice.
        Reeves has turned in awful performances for top-notch directors such as
Francis Ford Coppola and Kenneth Branagh, so it's no shock that he doesn't do
any better for a hack like Robbins.  What is surprising is that Robbins appears
to have given Reeves complete free reign, for Conor is prone to Keanu-isms that
you see the star doing at awards shows and in interviews: the constant head
bobbing, the arm-waving.  Reeves is also still a block o' balsa when it comes
time to show emotion, whether during the sappiness of the final stretch or in
the afterthought of a romantic subplot between Conor and a schoolteacher (Diane
Lane, wasted again).
        Yet as tempting as it is to pin _Hardball_'s failure on Reeves, fault
must go to the shockingly untalented Robbins, who, after _Varsity_Blues_ and
_Ready_to_Rumble_, continues his streak of wretched sports-tinged movies.  It
figures that "Hardball"'s big lesson is about the importance of showing up, for
obviously the _Head_of_the_Class_ alum owes his directing career to being at the
right place at the right time.  Who the hell knows wherever and whenever that
may have been, but it's certainly a moment in time cursed by true film fans
everywhere.

Title
Review for Last Days of Disco, The (1998)
The Last Days of Disco (R) *** (out of ****)
Like writer-director Whit Stillman's previous films, _Metropolitan_ and
_Barcelona_, his latest is all about talk and nothing more--it's just that
the faces and the setting are different (New York City in the "very early
1980s," where the cultural phenomenon of discotheques and their
accompanying musical genre were in their dying days).  But the incessant
barrage of verbiage is forgivable when it is as smartly, wittily written as
it is here.  The main gabbers of this film are the naive blonde Alice
(Chloe Sevigny) and her best "friend" and roommate, bitchy sophisticate
Charlotte (an unrecognizable Kate Beckinsale, sporting a perfect American
accent and looking like a cross between Nicole Kidman and Parker Posey),
both of whom are recent college grads who work in a publishing house by day
and frequent an exclusive dance club at night.
The film is essentially a portrait of their and their friends' lives, but
Stillman shows little concern for any of them.  The emphasis is so strongly
centered on their impossibly verbose conversations that all character and
plot developments seem like throwaways.  For example, when club manager Des
(Chris Eigeman, a Stillman regular) develops a what is supposed to be a
serious drug habit, it comes off as more of a minor step down than a
plunging descent.  In spite of its failings on the dramatic level, _Disco_
is still a very entertaining film, thanks to an appealing cast (which also
includes Beckinsale's _Much_Ado_About_Nothing_ love interest, Robert Sean
Leonard, and a briefly-seen Jennifer Beals) and those wordy discussions.
Even though a number of the characters are Ivy League graduates, I'm not
sure there are real people who talk the way these people do.  But since the
exchanges are as funny as they are (a sociopolitical deconstruction of
Disney's _Lady_and_the_Tramp_ is the highlight), that complaint is moot.

Title
Review for Two Can Play That Game (2001)
_Two_Can_Play_That_Game_ (R) *** (out of ****)
        Any film that opens with its protagonist saying directly to the camera,
"Oh hey!  I didn't see you there!" courts disaster.  That
_Two_Can_Play_That_Game_ turns out to be far from one is less a measure of the
efforts of writer-director Mark Brown than his leading lady, Vivica A. Fox,
whose considerable charms are able to make the film's less appealing qualities
rather tolerable.
        And how fortunate is that, given that two potentially repellent elements
lie front and center in the film.  First is the excessive breaking of the fourth
wall.  Main character Shanté Smith (Fox) directly addresses the camera so
frequently that the audience can be considered another cast member, playing the
best friend/sounding board role.  More problematic is the character of Shanté
herself.  A sexy, successful professional woman, Shanté is also characterized by
a self-confidence that creeps dangerously close to off-putting
arrogance--particularly in the relationship department, which is the focus of
the film.  The ostensible plot has Shanté suspecting her boyfriend Keith Fenton
(Morris Chestnut) of cheating, and the remainder of the film has her outlining
to the audience her allegedly foolproof ten-day plan, which entails lying and
all sorts of psychological manipulation, to get any man in gear.
        Given her penchant for self-centered scheming, Shanté could have easily
come off as an icy bitch.  Yet she never does, and that's a tribute to Fox.  Her
natural warmth and instant likability adds an invaluable layer of sincerity to
the character.  While some of the games she plays seem a bit extreme, Fox's
sympathetic portrayal paints the behavior as more misguided than mean-spirited;
her Shanté may be a little cocky and deluded, but she clearly has her heart in
the right place and does truly love Keith (contributing mightily to the latter
is Fox's convincing chemistry with Chestnut).  As deserved as Shanté's
inevitable comeuppance is, Fox is able to connect with the audience so strongly
that one cannot help but feel for the character when her strategy starts to
backfire.
        But _Two_Can_Play_That_Game_ isn't all about sweet sentiment.  Its
bigger concern is simply fun, and Fox and her equally appealing supporting cast
lend the familiar proceedings a sassy, spunky zing.  Standing out from the pack
are Mo'Nique (as one of Shanté's girlfriends) and Anthony Anderson (as Keith's
co-worker and "coach" in the ways of women), who get the best of Brown's
dialogue in the designated comic relief roles.  _Two_Can_Play_That_Game_ makes
no bones about being as insubstantial and disposable a film as one can find, but
it's a cute little trifle that delivers on the good time it promises.

Title
Review for Dogma (1999)
Much has been said about _Dogma_, much of that being negative.  For all
the talk I had heard about the allegedly inflammatory content of the
religious-themed comedy prior to seeing it, what shocked me the most were
those general accusations that writer-director Kevin Smith had committed
a cinematic act of sacrilege.  If you ask me, there is perhaps no other
filmmaker working today who is more serious about his or her faith than
Smith.  After all, is there any other filmmaker who has thanked God in
the closing credits of every single one of his films?
That said, after watching _Dogma_, I can see why people (namely the
Catholic League) have raised some objections.  After all, outrageous
elements such as dialogue passages criticizing the Bible's "bad
storytelling" and a thread where a cardinal starts a ridiculous
"Catholicism Wow" promotional campaign are bound to raise eyebrows--even
moreso when taken out of context, which is what the film's vocal
detractors have done (and how could they not, given the fact that they
haven't seen a frame of the film?).  And context is everything when it
comes to _Dogma_.
_Dogma_ is being billed as "a comic fantasia," and that description
should be taken to its core: it's a comedy; it's a fantasy.  As in it's
supposed to be taken lightly.  And not in a realistic fashion.  As a
hilarious typed pre-film disclaimer notes, this becomes clear within the
film's first ten minutes.  Smith's wacky plot revolves around the
dastardly scheme of two fallen angels, Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby
(Ben Affleck).  They discover a loophole in church dogma that will allow
them to end their eternal exile in Wisconsin and reenter the pearly gates
of Heaven.  The added consequence, however, is that their success would
spell the end of all existence.  With God having been put out of
commission while on a holiday, the fate of the world and all else rests
with efforts of a ragtag bunch: Metatron (Alan Rickman), the angel who
serves as the voice of God; Rufus (Chris Rock), the bitter, heretofore
unknown 13th Apostle; heavenly Muse-turned-stripper Serendipity (Salma
Hayek); a pair of familiar Prophets by the name Jay and Silent Bob (Jason
Mewes and Smith, reprising their recurring roles); and the reluctant key
figure in thwarting the renegade duo, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), an
abortion clinic worker who, after a series of rough life experiences, has
lost her faith.
The last sentence points up _Dogma_'s central flaw: overpopulation.  In
addition to the aforementioned, also encountered along the way is a demon
named Azrael (Jason Lee) and his trio of hockey stick-wielding henchmen;
Cardinal Glick (George Carlin), who institutes the "Catholicism Wow"
campaign; and cameo roles played by familiar faces such as Janeane
Garofalo.  Some characters could have easily been jettisoned, namely
Serendipity; while it's always a pleasure to see Hayek on the silver
screen, her character is pretty much just the token female celestial
being (or, rather, the token celestial being with breasts, for those from
above have no gender).  All the extra bodies also draw valuable time away
from one of the story's more primary concerns, which is Bethany's winding
road to rediscovering her faith; as such, her ultimate enlightenment
doesn't pack the punch that it should.
Much like there are characters that don't quite work, there are also
scenes and gags in _Dogma_ that fall short.  Jay and Silent Bob's big
entrance is a throwback to the over-the-top and largely unfunny comic
book gags in _Mallrats_, and there's one elaborate effects set piece
involving a shit demon (yes,  you read that right) is a complete failure.
 Where _Dogma_ excels, however, is in the area of verbal humor, arguably
Smith's forte.  The most memorable moments are all in the written and
spoken word, and the film has more than its share of great dialogue:
Rufus' rumination on Mary and Joseph's sex life and his angry diatribe
over being left out of the Bible; Loki and Bartleby confronting a
boardroom full of execs on their wide variety of sins; and the general
byplay between Jay and Silent Bob, and that between the pair and Bethany.
Along its lighthearted and offbeat comic path, though, Smith does raise
(and in a fairly seamless manner at that) some serious and not-so-serious
questions about Catholic dogma and organized religion in general.  By
virtue of their definition and the fact that they're in regards to
religion, these questions would understandably upset religious groups. 
But what those objectors fail to see that the questions raised, such as
the dangerous differences between "beliefs" and "ideas," are intelligent
ones that would only spring from the mind of someone who takes his or her
faith seriously.  Smith isn't labeling anyone or anything as being wrong,
rather offering food for thought.
Aside from the uniformly strong work of the ensemble and Smith's wit and
ever-improving way with the camera (check out all the added action in the
background!), that's what makes _Dogma_ a cut above most other comedies:
the audacity to challenge the very audience that comes in for all the
penis and flatulence jokes (and no, they're not in short supply).  A lot
of people will walk out of _Dogma_ thinking back on its many laughs, but
just as many, if not more, will come out reflecting on their own
religious faith--people who, on any other given day, would probably not
give the issue a single thought.  And if that's not an act of piety--as
opposed to one of blasphemy, with which Smith has been so unjustly
charged--then I don't know what is.  (opens November 12)

Title
Review for Bait (2000)
        _Bait_ does serve its primary purpose: to serve as a showcase for
the comic talents of star Jamie Foxx, whose excitable energy is mirrored
by the slick direction of Antoine Fuqua.  Too bad there's too much of a
story that asks that the suspension of disbelief be stretched to
uncomfortable lengths.
        The bait of the title is Foxx's Alvin Sanders, a none-too-bright
thief who is released early from prison because his arresting officer
falsified evidence.  Or, rather, that is the excuse cooked up by U.S.
Treasury agent Edgar Clenteen (David Morse), who really wants to use
Alvin to lure one Bristol (Doug Hutchison), the murderous mastermind
behind a multimillion-dollar gold heist, out of hiding.  Why Alvin?  It
turns out he was the cellmate of Bristol's now-deceased partner, who gave
Alvin clues as to where the still-missing gold is hidden.
        There is even more to this story.  Alvin has been implanted with
an electronic device that enables the Feds to monitor his every move and
word.  His release, let alone his being outfitted with such experimental
technology, was done under the radar of the government highers-up, so in
order for Clenteen's plan to work, Alvin has to stay out of trouble--a
difficult thing for a career criminal such as he.  However, Alvin does
have some added motivation to stay on the straight and narrow--among the
things he finds changed after 18 months in the pen is that girlfriend
Lisa (Kimberly Elise, wasted) is now also mother to his baby son.
        As can easily be gleaned, _Bait_ is seriously overplotted (Andrew
and Adam Scheinman and Tony Gilroy are the credited writers), let alone
wildly far-fetched.  This is, after all, an action comedy, and the
scribes would have been wiser to pay more attention to the jokes. 
Nonetheless, given the narrative overload, _Bait_ works better than
expected.  Foxx is able to sell even the weaker one-liners, and he is
convincing when the story pushes him into action.  Fuqua, who previously
proved his ability to stylishly handle an action scene in
_The_Replacement_Killers_, brings similar visual pizzazz to the set
pieces here.
        But the good in _Bait_ isn't enough to overcome the crippling
excess.  In addition to the convoluted plot, there's the matter of the
curious performance of Hutchison, who plays bad Bristol by channelling
John Malkovich and Kevin Spacey's most effete mannerisms.  Even Fuqua
lets himself get out of hand, employing his flashy technique for a scene
where Alvin quietly recalls a warm childhood memory.  But these quibbles
are likely to be lost on general audiences, whom I suspect (and
understandably so) will not only eat up this shiny piece of product, but
be satisfied by it as well.  But for anyone looking for true cinematic
nourishment, _Bait_ is not a meal.

Title
Review for Trekkies (1997)
The most indelible image of the news coverage of the hoopla surrounding
_The_Phantom_Menace_'s opening was not the many people in line dressed up
as Darth Maul, but people out of line dressed up as characters from that
_other_ long-running sci-fi series, in particular one woman: leading a
protest of all the media attention lavished upon _Star_Wars_ while dressed
up as Borg, she held a Yoda doll in a noose, dropped it onto the ground,
and then proceeded to stomp on it furiously.
Sadly, such (for lack of a better term) "deviant" behavior is not
chronicled in _Trekkies_, a documentary about _Star_Trek_'s fervent fans,
but there are plenty of extremes on display.  Witness the Whitewater juror
who insisted upon wearing her Starfleet uniform to court and only likes
being addressed as "Commander."  Marvel at the dentist who turned his
office into a pretty neat microcosm of the _Trek_ universe.  Listen in
astonishment as one fan, who already dresses his poodle in Starfleet
clothes, contemplates having his ears surgically altered to resemble a
Vulcan's.  Laugh hysterically at the infamous "Q Virus" story and one fan
who drives around in a working replica of an unusual transport vehicle
featured in the TV series.
All of this holds a strange fascination, but as one can glean from the
above paragraph, it does get somewhat redundant after a while.  Not to
mention grating at times--the fan who gets the most screen time,
14-year-old Gabriel Koerner, is so smugly pretentious one wishes he would
end up on the wrong end of a phaser.  _Next_Generation_ star Denise Crosby,
who also produced, makes an engaging tour guide to all the madness, but the
film loses steam halfway into its slim 86-minute running time.

Title
Review for Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later (1998)
Say what you will about its banality or the inherent ridiculousness of its
messengers, but the Spice Girls' mantra of "Girl Power" seems to have made
a profound effect in Hollywood.  For proof, look no further than two wildly
different films opening within less than a week between them: _Ever_After_
and _Halloween:_H20--20_Years_Later_, which put effective feminist spins on
the normally weak icons of Cinderella and the slasher film scream queen,
respectively.
Drew Barrymore's Danielle, the heroine of _Ever_After_, has more than a
little in common with the Cinderella of fairy tale lore.  After the death
of her father (Jeroen Krabbé), Danielle (nicknamed "Cinderella") is treated
as a lowly servant girl by her wicked stepmother Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston,
wonderfully bitchy).  There are two stepsisters, Marguerite (Megan Dodds)
and Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey, Kate Winslet's best friend/lover/partner
in crime in _Heavenly_Creatures_); there is a prince, by the name of Henry
(Dougray Scott); and there is a lavish ball and even a slipper left behind.
But it is there that the similiarities end and something quite radical
begins.  For one thing, there is no magic at all in _Ever_After_--no
pumpkin carriage, rat horses, not even a fairy godmother, though Danielle
has a helper in no less than Leonardo daVinci (Patrick Godfrey).  The
absence of the fantastic has an empowering and liberating effect on the
heroine, who in other Cinderella tales is rather passive and weak.
Danielle is far from that, strong in will and body (in one scene, she
literally _carries_ the prince) and in total command of her destiny.  The
prince is nice and strong himself, but she can rescue herself, thank you
very much (Danielle could very well be nicknamed "Cinder Spice").  Female
empowerment also manifests itself in _Ever_After_'s sense of sisterhood, a
quality that is missing from other versions of the story.  Only Marguerite
qualifies as a wicked stepsister; the zaftig Jacqueline is every bit
Rodmilla's victim as well, and she is constantly belittled by her mother
because of her size.  As such, Danielle and Jacqueline recognize themselves
as kindred spirits.
This revisionism performed by director Andy Tennant and screenwriters
Susannah Grant and Rick Parks is not without a few missteps.  There is an
awkward, completely superfluous framing story, where a mysterious older
woman (Jeanne Moreau) tells the story to the Grimm Brothers; and a subplot
involving a sleazy nobleman (Richard O'Brien) with a jones for Danielle is
poorly developed.  But the freshness of the entire affair and the
exuberance of its execution, bolstered by sweet chemistry between Barrymore
and Scott, goes a long way in charming the viewer.
Perhaps the most indelible image of John Carpenter's seminal 1978 chiller
_Halloween_ was that of 17-year-old babysitter Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee
Curtis) cowering in the corner of a crudely locked closet while "the
Bogeyman," a.k.a. Michael Myers, stabbed his ways through the doors.  Flash
forward twenty years, and to the clunkily titled
_Halloween:_H20--20_Years_Later_ (why not just
_Halloween:_20_Years_Later_?).  The most memorable sight?  The same but
older Laurie, brandishing an ax, openly inviting--or, rather, _daring_--her
unseen tormentor to show his white-masked face with the piercing wail of
"MICHAEL!"  Yes, cinema's most famous scream queen is back, louder than
ever, but now infused with a strong dose of Girl--make that _Grrrl_--Power.
This entertaining seventh installment of the series glazes over the events
of installments 4-6 (the third film was completely unrelated) and takes a
sharp focus on the first two, namely the character and history of Laurie.
Since last seen learning that Michael is her brother in _Halloween_II_ and
witnessing his apparent demise (apparently she didn't hear of his exploits
depicted in 4-6), Laurie faked her death and moved from Illinois to
California as Keri Tate.  Now a divorced single mom of 17-year-old John
(Josh Hartnett), Laurie/Keri is the head mistress of a posh private school.
 But she is still haunted by the memory of her murderous brother, who, of
course, locates his long-lost sister and decides to pay her a visit on
Halloween night, 1998--twenty years to the night he first terrorized her.
The basic story and script of _H20_, credited to Robert Zappia and Matt
Greenberg (working from a treatment by _Scream_ wunderkind Kevin
Williamson), doesn't hold up to much scrutiny.  Michael bumps off a couple
of the libidinous teens at the school as well as a handful of others who
get in the way.  Laurie finds out he's back and is forced to face her
demons (or, rather, demon).  That's it.  But, then again, the basic story
of Carpenter's original didn't exactly hold up under close examination,
either.  What's important is the effectiveness of the shock and scare
scenes, and while director Steve Miner doesn't take the high road that
Carpenter took in _Halloween_ (that is, keep blood and gore to a surprising
minimum), he pulls off more than a few nailbiters, most notably the
extended climactic chases between Laurie and Michael.
The effectiveness of the thrilling final act, and the film as a whole,
owes a huge debt to Curtis and the character of Laurie.  Though her
stress-related alcoholism and pill-popping are never satisfactorily
resolved, Laurie undergoes a nice character arc in reference to her
previous two films.  It is highly believable that she would no longer be
scared of Michael so much as angry and, thus, out for blood herself; it
would have been less convincing if, after all this time, she was still the
girl who cowered in the closet.  Although the _Scream_ films' Sydney
Prescott is a rather proactive horror heroine, the new Laurie is a step
beyond that.  The seemingly indestructable Michael may want to kill her,
but that is nothing compared to her desire to kill _him_ and free herself
from the past, making for an intriguing pas de deux where the two often
trade the roles of stalker and stalkee.
_Halloween:_H20_'s Laurie Strode may not be given the fairy tale fate met
by Danielle in _Ever_After_, which is just the first in an endless list of
differences.  But one, strong trait unifies them: they use their wits and
will to escape and triumph over their victimizers and take control of their
lives.  Whatever the time, whatever the place, female empowerment makes the
same sound--a blistering roar.

Title
Review for Watcher, The (2000)
        There is a germ of an interesting idea buried in _The_Watcher_,
but any chance of that idea developing into the basis of an intelligent
thriller was completely obliterated when the thought of stunt casting
entered the picture.  So instead of an engrossing psychological chiller,
we get a fairly pro forma serial killer pursuit pic where the madman is
played by... Keanu Reeves.  Any wonder why not a single scare nor
suspenseful moment is to be experienced in this amazingly anemic film?
        The potentially interesting idea lost in the muck is the
exploration of the strange symbiotic relationship between a killer and
his pursuer.  In _The_Watcher_, the killer is Reeves' David Allen
Griffin, who stalks his young female prey before strangling them with a
piano wire; the pursuer is Joel Campbell (James Spader), an FBI profiler
who worked on the Griffin case during his initial killing spree in Los
Angeles.  Burned out after working that case--without ever capturing
Griffin--Campbell has since left the bureau and the City of Angels,
living a layabout life in Chicago that is perked up only by non-stop
intake of prescription drugs and frequent visits to his shrink, Polly
(Marisa Tomei, struggling to get back on the studio A-list in a thankless
role).  But it isn't long before Griffin turns up in the Windy City,
prodding Campbell into a cat-and-mouse game that brings him back to the
Fed fold.
        I get the impression that the story as originally conceived by
Darcy Meyers and David Elliot was less about catching the killer--which
is what the finished _The_Watcher_ ostensibly is, a routine genre
exercise--than about something more interesting: that being how lawmen
become defined by the perps they track, and vice versa.  But any probing
psychological dimension to this story is drowned out by Joe Charbanic's
overdirection.  Heavy on the quick edits and stylized visuals, it comes
as no surprise that Charbanic is another music video vet making the big
leap to the feature film world.  While flashiness has its place on the
big screen, the seems strangely out of place in a film whose content
suggests something darker and grittier (further exemplified by Spader and
Tomei's sullenly earnest performances); the gloss makes the film that
much more difficult to believe.
        Ultimately nudging _The_Watcher_ from "difficult to believe" to
"impossible to believe" is the ruinous presence of Reeves.  Charbanic
directed videos for Reeves' band Dogstar, and I'd like to think it's that
connection--and studio execs' taste for stunt casting--is what led to
this stunning example of miscasting.  It is inconceivable that anyone
could sincerely believe that he of the affectless voice, erratic speech
rhythms, blank face, and bobbing head could convincingly convey any sense
of evil or menace, and Reeves' performance just confirms how limited his
range is.  His Griffin is serial killer as laid-back surfer dude, and
never once do we believe someone this incredibly goofy could have evaded
the authorities this long.  Whenever Reeves shows up, any level of
believability that the film has managed to generate (mostly courtesy of
Spader) goes rocketing out the window.
        And, unfortunately, Reeves shows up quite frequently in
_The_Watcher_, and Charbanic and the rest of the crew fail to compensate
with the pedestrian, suspenseless plot twists, which lumber toward a most
unsatisfying climax.  As such, the only fright likely to be experienced
by moviegoers is the fact that they spent hard-earned money on such a
turkey.

Title
Review for Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999)
_Teaching_Mrs._Tingle_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
Once upon a time, there was a 10th grade English class run by one Mr.
Jerry Stover, a teacher who was a pain to (with a few exceptions) all of
his students but made an extra effort to continually tear down one
student in particular.  This usually strong English student found all of
his best efforts met with indifference at best, outright derision at
worst by Stover, who often seized every opportunity to humiliate the
student in front of the whole class.  When called on to do an oral report
on a reading assignment, the student only got about two words in before
Stover criticized his barely-begun report and asked him to sit down.  But
that was nothing compared to what came at the end of the school year,
when the student's year-ending speech project--which was capped off with
a spirited song number that was wholeheartedly embraced and warmly
praised by his classmates--was verbally torn to shreds by Stover in front
of everyone.  That public attack was just a warm-up for a comment Stover
made during a subsequent private meeting with the student: "I don't like
you."
As you can guess, the student in question was yours truly, and while it
did take some added effort--and, I'd like to think, guilt on Stover's
part--to get an A in that class, I didn't have to resort to anything
resembling the over-the-top antics presented in hot scribe Kevin
Williamson's directorial debut, _Teaching_Mrs._Tingle_.  My own
experiences undoubtedly contributed to my enjoyment of this admittedly
junky but wickedly watchable revenge fantasy.  I immediately identified
with the film's protagonist, solid A student Leigh Ann Watson (Katie
Holmes), who, in an early scene, presents a much-worked-on project in her
history class, only to have her presentation abruptly cut short by
vicious barbs hurled by the class's instructor, Mrs. Eve Tingle (Helen
Mirren).  This scene (and the entire film, for that matter) has been
criticized for being grossly exaggerated, and indeed it is, to biting
comic effect.  But there is a ring of truth--not just for me personally,
who knows it is possible for teachers to have unfounded personal grudges
against students; but I'm sure for many other people who have had
similar, if not overly so, trying experiences with hardass teachers.
Williamson sends all basis in reality out the window, however, when the
film's main story kicks into gear.  After Mrs. Tingle falsely accuses
Leigh Ann of cheating, she and her friends Luke Churner (Barry Watson)
and Jo Lynn Jordan (Marisa Coughlan) confront Mrs. Tingle at her home. 
One thing leads to another, and soon Mrs. Tingle is tied to her bed, held
prisoner by the three students, who try to reason with her--and teach her
an overdue lesson or two.  The stage is set for a tense and witty
psychological battle between the teens and Tingle, who is as adept at
manipulative mind games as she is mean.
For a first-time director, Williamson shows great skill working with
actors.  While Watson is fairly bland as the hunky bad boy, he does share
palpable chemistry with the other core three, who make good impressions. 
Holmes is an instantly likable screen presence, and her calm and poise
grounds the film in some level of reality and plays well off of newcomer
Coughlan, who has the showier role as the kooky aspiring actress Jo Lynn.
 The showiest role of them all, of course, is the title character, and
Serious Actress Mirren sinks her teeth and then some into this
change-of-pace part.  Her venomous performance has been criticized as
being one-dimensional, but the point of the part is to be an
over-the-top, love-to-hate villain, and does she ever succeed at that.
That said, one does wish there were more of an explanation of Tingle's
wicked ways, or at least a clearer one for her malice toward Leigh Ann;
it is implied that she is jealous of her ability and bright prospects,
but the implication is a bit too vaguely made and not altogether
confirmed.  (After all, Mrs. Tingle does have one bright pet student.) 
_Tingle_ was the first script Williamson ever wrote, and it is indeed the
least polished of his heretofore produced works, and his inexperience in
the director's chair doesn't serve the more awkward moments well.  There
are a couple of scenes that establish Leigh Ann's warm relationship with
her mother (Lesley Ann Warren) that are not only ridiculously saccharine,
but feel completely out of place in what is otherwise a gleefully
heartless film.  A bit more in line with the tone is Jo Lynn's hyper
reenactment of scenes from _The_Exorcist_, and while it is good for a
chuckle, the scene is a showstopper of the worst kind, a dead halt in the
action; it is also a rather obligatory movie reference, a device worked
well--and served a recognizable purpose--in Williamson's _Scream_ films
but adds nothing in this context.
To borrow an obvious metaphor that has been used--and will surely
continue to be used--by detractors of the film, Williamson does, in fact,
need to be taught a few more lessons on film direction.  But with
_Teaching_Mrs._Tingle_, it is evident that Williamson does possess some
natural filmmaking ability, and he has already found a distinct
voice--something that many more established filmmakers have yet to
discover.

Title
Review for Playing by Heart (1998)
_Playing_by_Heart_ (R) *** (out of ****)
Thanks to a strange MPAA ruling--and much to the delight, I'm sure, of
Miramax's marketing department--writer-director Willard Carroll was
forced to change the title of his _Dancing_About_Architecture_ to
_Playing_by_Heart_.  Never in recent memory has a forced title change
thrown a film more off-kilter.  A pre-title prologue has the character of
Joan (Angelina Jolie) explain what the original title means: "Talking
about love is like dancing about architecture"--meaning that it can't be
done.  After the explanation, the title comes up... reading
_Playing_by_Heart_.  If this bit of incongruity weren't enough, Joan's
explanation is directly culled from a scene that takes place later in the
movie--making its inclusion at the beginning completely unnecessary.
After that confused opening, Carroll's film (which I will henceforth
refer to by its original, better, title), quickly finds its footing,
following a series of engaging if slight storylines that detail the
romantic travails of a cross-section of Los Angeles residents.  There's
the aforementioned Joan, a young clubhopper who develops an interest in
another, Keenan (Ryan Phillippe), who constantly rejects her. 
No-nonsense divorcee Meredith (Gillian Anderson) doesn't have the time,
energy, nor interest for romance, but that doesn't stop the
too-good-to-be-true Trent (Jon Stewart) from aggressively wooing her. 
Longtime marrieds Hannah (Gena Rowlands) and Paul (Sean Connery) argue
over an extramarital tryst he may or may not have have had many years
ago.  Lovers Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger (Anthony Edwards) are
also married--but not to each other.  Lying sad sack Hugh (Dennis Quaid)
cruises bars and restaurants telling wild stories to anyone who will give
a listen.
As with any multi-character/multi-storyline piece, some threads work
better than others.  The weakest of these is the Gracie/Roger story,
which consists of little more than the two trysting in different hotel
rooms, squandering the considerable acting talents of Stowe and Edwards. 
The most effective storylines are buoyed by terrific performances and/or
chemistry: the appealing Anderson and Stewart work surprisingly well
together in the Meredith/Trent strand, and the luminous Jolie compensates
for Phillippe's adequate but fairly colorless work in the Joan/Keenan
story.  Jolie's spunky, heartfelt, Oscar-nod-worthy performance is easily
the film's best--which is no small feat, considering the caliber of the
actors surrounding her.
While Carroll's focus is largely on romantic love, he doesn't isolate it
there; he sets his sights a bit wider, shoehorning in a storyline about
the reconnection of a mother (Ellen Burstyn) with her son (Jay Mohr, in
his dramatic debut), who is dying of AIDS.  The attempt to also cover
maternal love is admirable, and the story is beautifully acted and
quietly affecting.  But it never fits in with the rest of the other,
bouncier stories; the fact that the story takes place in Chicago and not
L.A. like others makes it feel more out of place.
An attempt to tie together this and all the other storylines comes at
the film's conclusion, yet while they're designed to be a surprise, the
ways in which everything is linked is rather predictable and a bit too
tidy.  The same can be said about the totality of
_Dancing_About_Architecture_, which isn't as distinctive as that title
(in essence, it's _Short_Cuts_ lite), but it's an agreeable, low-key
entertainment that gets the crowdpleasing job done.  (reopens January 22)

Title
Review for Diamonds (1999)
A grandfather, his son, and grandson take a road trip from Canada to
Reno, Nevada in search of some lost diamonds, along the way taking an
extended side trip at a brothel.  It sounds like a junky comedy ripe for
release in the January/February dumping ground, and John Asher's film
would have received that undistinguished--and, to a certain extent,
deserved--treatment if not for one person: Kirk Douglas, who headlines as
the cantankerous former championship boxer searching for riches and
renewed happiness in his twilight years.
His touching, effortless performance--his first screen role since
suffering a stroke--is the reason why Miramax is giving the film a
one-week awards qualifying engagement, and indeed it is great to see the
former Spartacus back where he belongs; his acting skills are in tip-top
shape even if his body isn't.  Yet I wouldn't call his performance
particularly award-worthy other than for sentimental reasons, which is
more than I can say for this rather silly and sappy film, which also
stars Dan Aykroyd as Douglas' son, who only wants his daddy's love and
approval; and Corbin Allred as Aykroyd's rebellious son, perhaps the
whitest of white boys to ever utter such terms such as "yo" and "phat." 
The normally overwrought Jenny McCarthy, late of MTV's _Singled_Out_ and
_Playboy_ magazine, is nicely held in check as a prostitute (insert your
own joke here); and as her madam, Lauren Bacall strikes luminous sparks
with Douglas, with whom she had previously teamed nearly 50 years ago on
_Young_Man_with_a_Horn_.  However, not even the reunion of these two
screen legends makes the film evaporate from the memory any less quickly.

Title
Review for Gridlock'd (1997)
Before his untimely death last year, rapper-actor Tupac Shakur left
behind a number of completed films in the can.  The first to see the light
of day is Gridlock'd, the energetic and enjoyable screenwriting and
directing debut of actor Vondie Curtis-Hall (Broken Arrow, TV's Chicago Hope
and Cop Rock).
After his girlfriend Cookie (Thandie Newton) falls into a
drug-induced coma, heroin junkie Spoon (Shakur) decides to lay off the dope,
forcing his comrade-in-blow Stretch (Tim Roth) to join him in detox.  This
simple decision sets off an exhausting chain of events where Stretch and
Spoon run around town dealing with bureaucrats of varying rigidity and flee
from a drug kingpin (Curtis-Hall) and the police, who suspect the two when a
fellow drug fiend and his girlfriend are murdered.
Sounds like pretty heavy stuff, and sometimes it is.  But like the
big heroin-themed film of last year, Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, the film
is often quite funny, deftly walking the thin line between the harrowing and
the hilarious.  And the humor does not come out of nowhere and feel out of
place; like life itself, comedy sometimes spring forth naturally from
tragedy, with some inherent dark humor being found in what can be seen as
the most serious of moments.  But this is not to say that Curtis-Hall
glosses over heroin addiction.  Spoon and especially Stretch are seen for
what they are--loser junkies--living in a dirty, cluttered apartment and
getting into messes they could easily have avoided, often getting out
through sheer luck alone (which results in some overly contrived moments).
Curtis-Hall does add some interesting visual flair to the proceedings, using
flashy editing and whatnot, but nothing here is as flashy as Boyle's
sometimes surreal work in Trainspotting, and the entire film's look is
appropriately grimy and gritty.
But even with Curtis-Hall's able efforts behind the camera,
Gridlock'd could not have possibly worked without a convincing, charismatic
lead duo, and Shakur and Roth fit the bill perfectly.  Roth has the showier
role, playing pathetic, dirty, and just plain wacky Stretch, and he pulls it
off as well as one expects (even though his natural British accent sometimes
slips into his on-screen New York accent).  Shakur's more sensible Spoon is
the straight man, but he is far from upstaged, holding his own with his
confident, commanding presence; he truly had a bright future in film.  Roth
and Shakur's rapport is so natural, so effortless that you have no problem
believing that they are longtime friends.  It's too bad that a reteaming of
the two is out of the question.
The pileup of films currently released amounts to one big traffic
jam at movie houses, but the entertaining Gridlock'd should have no problem
clearing a path to box office success.

Title
Review for Rounders (1998)
Rounder:  1. A dissolute or rakish person, according to Webster's
Dictionary.  2. A hustler, according to World Champion poker player Johnny
Chan.
_Rounders_: John Dahl's engrossing drama, a never-less-than fascinating
cinematic window peeking into the world of high-stakes poker lurking in New
York's underground.
David Levien and Brian Koppelman's central story does a more than
adequate, if mechanical, job of taking the audience into its seedy milieu.
After losing a hard-won $31,000 in a single game, expert card player and
law student Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) swears off poker at the behest of
his classmate and live-in girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol).  But, to paraphrase
_The_Godfather_Part_III_, just when Mike thought he was out, Worm pulls him
back in--Worm being Mike's old friend (Edward Norton), who, soon after his
release from prison, lures Mike back into being a "rounder."
I had two key quibbles with Levien and Koppelman's script, one being the
contrived dynamics of Mike-Worm relationship.  Worm is clearly no good,
getting Mike into all sorts of trouble, yet Mike continues to stand by and
cover for him.  Perhaps Mike is simply loyal to his friends, but if Mike
truly is as smart as he's made out to be, he would see Worm for the
complete loser that he is.  Nonetheless, Damon and Norton's strong rapport
make it somewhat easier to believe.  No such rapport is present to solve my
second problem, which is the unnecessary love story between Mike and Jo,
vapidly played by current Hollywood "It Girl" Mol.  There is not one scene
that establishes their relationship prior to the inevitable strain cause by
his return to poker.  Their first scene together has her asleep in bed
while he heads out, and not too long after that she's arguing with him
about his poker outings.  How is it possible to have an emotional
investment in their romance?
What makes a ticket to _Rounders_ a wise monetary investment for
moviegoers is its fascinating look at the underground poker world.  While
they falter in the aforementioned dramatic areas, Levien and Koppelman make
up for it with their attention to detail.  They have an acute understanding
of the game and this world, making extensive use of insider vernacular,
which lends the film an air of authenticity.  In fact, so heavy is its use
that the press notes include a nearly four-page glossary of poker terms.
This is not to say, however, that those without press notes will be
scratching their heads.  The writers' great accomplishment is making the
language accessible to poker neophytes, who will be able to easily
understand the insider dialogue through context.  A big help is Mike's
efficient voiceover narration, which delivers crucial exposition on the
game of poker quickly and clearly.
The card game subject matter may seem to be a bit of a stretch for
director Dahl, who has made his name with neo-noirs (_Red_Rock_West_ ,
_The_Last_Seduction_).  But his noir-bred gift for creating an atmosphere
of mystery and suspense makes for some tense and exciting poker matches.
The air of mystery also comes through in a few memorable characters, such
as Joey Knish (John Turturro), a seasoned poker player who sometimes
advises Mike; Petra (Famke Janssen), the sultry head of the Chesterfields
poker club; and, most notably, Russian poker master Teddy KGB (an
effectively hammy John Malkovich), to whom Mike loses his $31,000 in the
film's opening.
After watching large sums of money being won and (mostly) lost in
_Rounders_, it is doubtful that any moviegoer will be eager to gain entry
into some high-stakes card games; as Mike says in the film, poker is not a
game of luck, but of skill.  Similarly, neither is filmmaking, and it is
the filmmakers' skill that makes _Rounders_ a worthwhile entertainment.

Title
Review for Breakfast of Champions (1999)
_Breakfast_of_Champions_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
        If you're debating whether or not to see _Breakfast_of_Champions_, ask
yourself one simple question: do you want to see Nick Nolte in lingerie? 
The only people who would get much enjoyment from Alan Rudolph's chaotic
adaptation of the Kurt Vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the
population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight. 
Everyone else--and I'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer
clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess.
        Actually, though, the sight of Nolte in high heels is one of the more
amusing things about this muddle, which focuses Dwayne Hoover (Bruce
Willis), the owner of Dwayne Hoover's Exit 11 Motor Village in Midland
City.  Not only is he a huge success as a businessman, he's also
something of a celebrity, his face made recognizable by an ongoing series
of television commercials.  With a nice home and family to boot, Dwayne
appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he's not.  His
wife Celia (Barbara Hershey) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze; his
son George (Lukas Haas) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the
stage name "Bunny."  Not only that, the Environmental Protection Agency
is on Dwayne's ass over a building development project.  It's enough to
send Dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is, if he doesn't succeed in
blowing his brains out first.
        Meanwhile, Midland City is about to host a fine arts festival, and the
guest of honor is one Kilgore Trout (Albert Finney), a writer who is far
from the renowned author the festival's organizer (Buck Henry) was led to
believe--in fact, he's a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi
that appears in porn magazines.  His trek to Midland City is also a
spiritual journey, one that reaches its apex after meeting Dwayne, who
for some reason thinks that Trout will hold for him all of life's
answers.
        The above is already a longer plot synopsis than I usually give in my
reviews, but, ironically, I have barely scratched the surface.  I haven't
yet mentioned Wayne Hoobler (Omar Epps), an ex-con with an obsessive
admiration for the similarly-named Dwayne.  Then there's the matter of
Francine (Glenne Headly), Dwayne's devoted secretary.  Not to mention
Dwayne's employee and old friend Harry LeSabre (Nolte), the one with the
secret penchant for cross-dressing.  And so on.  The film is essentially
Dwayne's story, but too often Rudolph goes on distracting tangents with
the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point
is.
        Rudolph does arrive at a point (more on that later), but it's blunted
and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material.  The surreal
visual style, complete with printed words flying through the air and into
Dwayne's ears, is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness, but its
bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad.  The actors are called
on to act accordingly, resulting in some of the worst, most overdone work
all of them have ever turned in.  Willis fares best of all--but that's
because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of
the audience.
        With such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its
running time, it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious, and
Rudolph tries to make a statement.  Unlike _American_Beauty_ (a film that
_Breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways, to its great detriment),
there isn't any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the
audience for the big shift.  As such, the cartoony characters fail to win
a sympathy that needs to be earned; and the film attempts, to no avail,
to reach a profundity that it doesn't deserve.
        Vonnegut's original novel is considered a classic, but it had been
called unfilmable--the same that was said of Hunter S. Thompson's
_Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas_, which was disastrously committed to
film last year by Terry Gilliam.  With the similar failure of
_Breakfast_of_Champions_, will Hollywood ever learn that books labeled
"unfilmable" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable?  Likely
not.

Title
Review for Sweet and Lowdown (1999)
_Sweet_and_Lowdown_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
"Lowdown" describes the main character in Woody Allen's annual project,
an anecdotal look at the life of Emmet Ray (Sean Penn), a gifted jazz
guitarist from the '30s whose skills and talent rank second only to his
idol, gypsy Django Reinhardt.  While he cries while listening to Django's
recordings and had fainted the two times he had seen him in person, the
true number one in Emmet's book is Emmet himself.  Boozy, a jerk to
everyone around him, and legendarily self-absorbed, it's amazing that
Emmet's story has ever been told before.
 The reason why it hasn't is simple: Emmet is a completely fictional
character, and the documentary-style talking head introductions to the
film's individual vignettes (by jazz historians and enthusiasts,
including Allen himself) go a long way in convincing the audience of the
film's truth.  Adding to the authenticity are the performances.  Penn is
hilarious as the pompous Emmet, but even better is the "sweet" component
of the film's title: Samantha Morton, who plays Emmet's long-suffering
laundress girlfriend Hattie--who happens to be mute.  Morton is an
absolute delight, and her marvelously cute and expressive face speak
volumes more than any lines of dialogue ever could.  There's a reason why
"sweet" comes before "lowdown" in the title, and Morton is it.

Title
Review for Peacemaker, The (1997)
The Peacemaker arrives on screens under considerably more scrutiny than
an average late-September action release.  First of all, it's the
inaugural motion picture release from Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey
Katzenberg, and David Geffen's studio, DreamWorks SKG, launched with much
fanfare three years ago.  The second concern is one that was not foreseen
at the time of the film's production: the questionable box office
bankability of lead George Clooney, whose popularity on television's ER
has not translated into blockbuster box office grosses for From Dusk till
Dawn, the underrated One Fine Day, and the justly maligned stinkbomb
Batman & Robin.  So does this Tom Clancy-esque thriller deliver the goods
under pressure?  Yes--it's certainly exciting enough to leave audiences
sufficiently entertained for a couple of hours, but that's all.
But what can you expect when the basic plot of Michael Schiffer's
screenplay (based on, as the credits read, "an article by Andrew and
Leslie Cockburn") is as thin as they come (OK, maybe not as thin as
Twister's)?  A cache of nuclear warheads is stolen from a train in
Russia, and it's up to Special Forces intelligence officer Col. Thomas
Devoe (Clooney) and the head of the White House Nuclear Smuggling Group,
Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman) to recover them, setting up one big
globe-hopping chase after the weapons and the terrorists who stole 
them.
Schiffer and director Mimi Leder don't take this story in any new
directions; familiar action staples such as car and helicopter chase
sequences, running through crowded streets, big explosions, and (would a
bomb thriller be complete without one?) a
hurry-the-hell-up-and-disarm-the-bomb-before-we-all-blow-up-to-kingdom-come
scene are present here.  And some touches cannot help but remind one of
some of the cast and crew's previous credits: Leder's extensive steadicam
use recalls her ER work; a prolonged piano-playing scene, complete with
closeups of fingers on keys, reminds one of co-star Armin Mueller-Stahl's
Shine; and Devoe and Kelly encounter a character named--gag--Schumacher. 
But Leder directs it all with a fairly quick pace and high energy level,
most notably in the opening hijack scene and a rousing car
chase/demolition derby in the streets of Vienna.
Similarly energized is Clooney, who fits this role much more snugly than
his infamous last.  His self-effacing manner feels more at home here than
it did for the Caped Crusader, but this is not to say that he's smiley
and jokey all of the time.  When called on to do action hero derring-do,
he's up to the task, making good on the largely forgotten "serious
action" promise he displayed in Dusk.  Thankfully, no contrived romantic
angle is developed between Devoe and Kelly, but that's even more for the
better here since little spark of any kind develops between Clooney and
Kidman, who seems a little ill-at-ease here.  Granted, she isn't given
anything really strenuous to do here (unless you count swimming laps),
but something is clearly, oddly amiss when her usually flawless American
accent slips into her natural Aussie every now and again.
With little competition in the action arena right now, the solidly made
The Peacemaker should keep Clooney's film career afloat (for now, at
least) and get DreamWorks Pictures off on a successful start--but the
film still can't help but feel like somewhat of a letdown.  It is a
sturdy, entertaining popcorn movie, and while that may be good enough for
any other studio at any other time, as the maiden film voyage of S, K,
and G's much-hyped zillion-dollar enterprise, it's a dismayingly
nondescript piece of formula product.

Review for Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence (1998)
_The_Very_Thought_of_You_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
It's no big shock that Miramax decided to give a more accessible title
to this modern-day screwball comedy, which has been released elsewhere in
the globe under the unconventional name
_Martha,_Meet_Frank,_Daniel_and_Laurence_.  That strange title pretty
much sums up the eccentricities of this film, which follows Martha
(Monica Potter), an American who runs off to London to start a new life. 
Within a couple of days, Martha individually meets Brits Frank (Rufus
Sewell), Daniel (Tom Hollander), and Laurence (Joseph Fiennes)--all of
whom fall in love with her.  Little does she know that the three are
lifelong friends, and little do they know that only one of them has her
love in return: Laurence.
Of course, a number of complications, coincidences, and
misunderstandings befitting that original title ensue.  But one wishes
that the film were as simple as the new, if generic and completely
irrelevant, title it bears now.  Potter and Fiennes are charming
together, and he is proven at playing lovelorn types (albeit not while
decked out in contemporary garb, which it is actually somewhat jarring to
see him in).  I would have liked to see them in a more straightforward
love story without all the mechanical silliness involving the other two
guys.  Unfortunately, that's what one must sit through in order to savor
their too-few sweet moments together.

Title
Review for First Wives Club, The (1996)
Walking out of the big press screening for The First Wives Club, I
couldn't help but feel as if I missed something.  While the bulk of the
audience, which had been laughing heartily during the film, left the theatre
all aglow with laughter and smiles, I left thinking it wasn't anything
remotely special, a light comedy that at best had its moments and at worst
was trite, labored, and much too nice.
Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton are ceaselessly
energetic as three pushing-50 lifelong friends whose husbands who left them
for younger women.  Film producer Bill (Victor Garber) left aging, vain
starlet Elise (Hawn) for an untalented ingenue (Elizabeth Berkley--'nuff
said); electronics salesman Morty (Dan Hedaya) left the brash, zaftig Brenda
(Midler) for sassy, svelte Shelly (a perfectly catty Sarah Jessica Parker);
and ad exec Aaron (Stephen Collins) ditched the whiny, wimpy Annie (Keaton)
for her psychotherapist, Leslie (Marcia Gay Harden).  After an old friend
(Stockard Channing) kills herself after her hubby (James Naughton) leaves
her for a young trophy wife (Heather Locklear, wasted in a wordless cameo),
the three form the First Wives Club, determined to exact painful revenge on
their exes.
Problem is, the revenge isn't painful enough.  For a feminist
revenge fantasy, The First Wives Club is much too nice; the script by Robert
Harling (based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel) doesn't have enough of a
venomous edge: the trio's revenge antics aren't that nasty, and there aren't
nearly enough acid one-liners--something is wrong if the best insults are
those the three women direct toward each other, not the men.  What makes
this a greater shame is that the three stars are in peak form, obviously
enjoying working with each other, having a ball.  Hawn takes top acting
honors, so very funny and convincing as a poster girl for plastic surgery;
Keaton next, hilariously playing Annie's neuroses to the hilt; then Midler,
who is no comic slouch but just has less of a character to work with than
her co-stars.
 There are some funny moments to be had, such as a couple of good
one-liners and slapstick gags here and there, but for every one of those,
there are a handful that don't quite work.  An interlude at a lesbian bar is
ripe with comic potential, but so little time is spent there that it does
not pay off as well as it could have.  One of the more crowd-pleasing
sequences has the trio riding an out-of-control window-washing scaffold, but
the rhythm of the scene is interrupted by a gratuitous, forced bit where a
couple in bed recognizes Elise through the window and compliments her
appearance.  Director Hugh Wilson also attempts to add some seriousness to
the proceedings, throwing in moments where the music grows more somber and
the audience is cued to "feel" for the lead characters; these moments are at
odds with the majority of the film, which often asks the viewer to not just
laugh with, but at, the over-the-top heroines.
It would not surprise me if The First Wives Club became a
word-of-mouth hit with women, especially older ones; the feminist message,
the three stars, and the outrageous comedy will probably be enough.  But for
this (yes, male) viewer, it wasn't quite enough.

Title
Review for My Name Is Joe (1998)
"...and I am an alcoholic."  British director Ken Loach has made a name
for himself for gritty films of social realism, and his latest is no
exception.  Peter Mullan, who won the Best Actor award at this past
year's Cannes Film Festival, indeed gives an award-worthy performance as
the Joe of the title, a recovering alcoholic who falls for a nice and
stable health care worker named Sarah (Louise Goodall).  A romance
between such polar opposites has a number of strikes against it as it is,
but their relationship is further threatened, in a psychological sense,
by demons from Joe's past; and, in a physical sense, by thugs after his
ex-junkie friend Liam (David McKay) and his girlfriend Sabine (Anne-Marie
Kennedy).
The latter threat takes over the film's final act, which is a
wrongheaded turn by Loach and writer Paul Laverty; what had been a
thoughtful, complex, yet subtle character study suddenly devolves into
violent theatrics more befitting an action picture.  Loach and Laverty
are apparently at a loss as to how to recover from that misstep, and the
film abruptly "stops" rather than "ends."  But Loach's keen eye for
unpolished reality (down to the gravy-thick Scottish accents; thankfully
the film, while in English, is subtitled) and Mullan's passionate,
well-modulated turn keeps the film well worth watching.  (opens February
5)

Title
Review for Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (2000)
_Book_of_Shadows:_Blair_Witch_2_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
Much like how _The_Exorcist_ begat _Exorcist_II:_The_Heretic_, last
year's shock success _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ has spawned a baffling and
altogether atrocious follow-up, _Book_of_Shadows:_Blair_Witch_2_.  Less a
sequel than an extremely loose spinoff--which has just about nothing to
do with either part of its title,  I might add--this film won't win over
the original's many detractors, and it is certain to incense the first's
cult of ardent supporters.
Director Joe Berlinger has described _Book_of_Shadows_ as an
"anti-sequel," and the premise he and writing collaborator Dick Beebe
(_BWP_ writers-directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez only take an
executive producing credit here) does hold some potential for an
interesting deconstruction of not merely the first _Blair_Witch_, but the
pop culture phenomenon it created.  _BW2_ doesn't take place in the same
"universe" inhabited by the original's characters of Heather, Mike, and
Josh; it takes place in the world of the here and now--that is, a world
where _The_Blair_Witch_Project_ is a blockbuster movie that has sent
tourism soaring in the filming location of Burkittsville, Maryland.  The
film opens with a witty faux-documentary segment that succinctly covers
the media frenzy around the film and fans' obsession with all things
Blair.
Once the nominal plot kicks in after the credit roll, _BW2_ begins is
big downhill plunge.  Among the many _BWP_ fans who have flocked to those
familiar woods is the "Blair Witch Hunt" tour group: Jeff (Jeffrey
Donovan), the tour organizer and former mental patient; Erica (Erica
Leerhsen), a practicing Wiccan who wants debunk the negative perception
of her religion; Stephen (Stephen Barker Turner), a supernatural skeptic
who is writing a book on the Blair Witch myth with his pregnant believer
girlfriend Tristen (Tristen Skyler); and Kim (Kim Director), token Goth
chick.  They set up camp at the ruins of the house featured in _BWP_'s
finale, and after a night of hard drinking, everyone wakes up the next
morning to find all their video equipment destroyed--and their memory
similarly damaged; no one has any recollection of all that went on that
night, let alone falling asleep.  Perhaps holding the answers are their
mysteriously untouched videotapes, and the five retreat to Jeff's
abandoned warehouse home to study them.
Given that _The_Blair_Witch_Project_'s ambiguous, debatable ending was a
major reason for the film's cult status, it was perhaps a wise move on
the part of Berlinger and Beebe to not offer any explanation about what
exactly happened.  I don't think anyone goes into _Book_of_Shadows_
expecting to find any specific answers about the first film's doomed
trio, anyway; however, I'm sure the common expectation is for some
additional background on the Blair Witch.  Alas, what the audience gets
is a repetitive and incredibly tedious chain of events where the five
have strange hallucinations when not watching playback of their
videotapes.  A few oblique references are made to the Blair Witch legend,
but they will be largely incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't done
extensive pre-viewing research at the Blair Witch website.  Unlike the
original film, where the expanded backstory works as an enhancement to a
stand-alone film, it's practically required reading if one wants to make
sense of whatever place _BW2_ has in the larger mythology--though even
Blair Witch fanatics may have difficulty sorting it all out as well.
But ties to the bigger Blair Witch picture are secondary to the casual
viewer, who simply wants to be scared.  Not only is there anything
remotely spooky to be found in _Book_of_Shadows_, no sense of suspense is
ever generated due to a self-defeating storytelling choice: flash
forwards.  In haphazardly jumping back and forth in time, Berlinger
indiscreetly gives away who exactly will survive and who will die, not to
mention the exact fate of these survivors; throughout the film he even
drops not-so-subtle hints--visual ones, no less--of what went down during
those missing hours.  With all its secrets and would-be shocks more than
telegraphed far in advance, there is a dull inevitability attached to
what should have been the film's "climactic" moments.
So, for most of _Book_of_Shadows_, one wonders what Berlinger's
intentions were, he clearly didn't set out to make the simple scary movie
everyone wants and expects.  The answer finally comes in the film's final
moments, which indeed reveals an aim "above" standard genre satisfaction:
to address the zeitgeist question of popular entertainment's connection
to real-life crime.  It's an admirable goal within the context of a
horror film, but there's a fine line between "ambitious" and
"pretentious."  By not offering anything fresh nor particularly
insightful on the subject, and without going about it in an entertaining
nor convincing way (the abysmal acting--or, rather, yelling--sends any
foundation in reality out the window), Berlinger and his empty
_Book_of_Shadows_ end up on the wrong side of that line.

Title
Review for Wood, The (1999)
So-called "urban" films almost always tend to be consigned to a box
office ghetto of their own, rarely connecting beyond its target
African-American audiences, even if the film has cross-demographic
appeal.  Even with the promotional muscle of MTV Productions behind it,
_The_Wood_ is not likely to be an exception to the rule, but this warm
and funny, if somewhat uneven, film deserves to be.
The film's title refers to Inglewood, California, and if anyone outside
of the Southern California area knows about the city, it's for either one
of two reasons: (1) it's the home of the Great Western Forum, longtime
arena to the Los Angeles Lakers (at least until this coming fall); or (2)
it's known for its gang activity.  The latter would be the obvious angle
to pursue, but aside from the gang connections of one secondary
character, writer-director Rick Famuyiwa admirably skirts the issue. 
Famuyiwa grew up in Inglewood, and his take on the city is an
affectionate portrait that could be of any given community; it has many
different qualities (including, as it is, gangs) that contribute to its
unique flavor.
Similarly universal, if more than a little formulaic, is its story,
which tracks a group of three friends over a span of 13 years.  The main
character is Mike (played as a teen by Sean Nelson, as an adult by Omar
Epps), who moves to The Wood from North Carolina in 1986.  In junior high
he immediately clicks with Wood natives Roland (played as a teen by Trent
Cameron, as an adult by Taye Diggs) and Slim (played as a teen by Duane
Finley, as an adult by Richard T. Jones), and together they come of age
through high school.  As is with the case of all young men of the teen
age, sex dominates the brain, and in a sense _The_Wood_ can be seen as a
(slightly) less crass cousin to _American_Pie_; there are no outrageous
gross-out gags, but the trio's attempts to initiate themselves are
humorous in how they are so firmly grounded in honest reality.
As can be gleaned from the actor credits, there is also a parallel story
that follows the trio as adults, and, unfortunately, it is not as
interesting as the teenage story.  In 1999, it's Roland's wedding day,
and hours before the ceremony, he's nowhere to be found; Mike and Slim
eventually do locate him, but he's plagued with doubt.  The flashbacks
are meant to punctuate the contemporary action, but the '99 scenes feel
like needless interruptions in the story that runs through '86 and '89. 
This is no fault of the likable and charismatic actors, even if Epps is
called on to address the camera directly for the film's first 15 minutes.
While I found that device to be distracting, it is in line with the
theme of the film, which is this idea of community and belonging, which,
of course, can be broken down to friendship.  Over the course of
_The_Wood_, one really grows to know and like these people as well as get
a keen feeling of their place and time; by the film's final toast, one
feels as if they are indeed part of The Wood.

Title
Review for Zero Effect (1998)
Writer-director Jake Kasdan's Zero Effect gets its title from its main
character, Daryl Zero (Bill Pullman).  Zero is perhaps the world's greatest
private detective, solving many a case without even setting foot outside of
his well-secured penthouse apartment.  And that's the problem--Zero is
unquestionably a head case, a shut-in with no social skills whatsoever,
writing bad love songs, guzzling cans of Tab, and eating tuna straight from
the can when not working on a case.  His only contact with the outside
world comes in the form of his overworked assistant, attorney Steve Arlo
(Ben Stiller).
>From the sounds of it, Zero Effect sounds like one of those painfully
labored and unfunny comedies focusing on a wacky hero who somehow achieves
brilliance through his sheer stupidity and dumb luck.  In reality, though,
the film could not be more different.  While it does have its share of
humorous moments, Zero Effect is an intriguing character study of its
protagonist disguised as a conventional comic mystery.
Not that there isn't a mystery involved, and it is certainly one of Zero
Effect's weakest points.  Zero is hired by wealthy Portland businessman
Gregory Stark (Ryan O'Neal) to recover a set of lost keys.  Naturally, this
simple investigation leads to something more complex, mainly a blackmail
scheme involving Stark and a paramedic named Gloria Sullivan (Kim Dickens).
 How this mechanical mystery plays out is flat, suspenseless, and more than
a little predictable, not helped at all by Kasdan's unnecessarily languid
pacing.
However, with the development of Gloria's relationship with an incognito
Zero the film achieves a surprising poignance.  Zero may be an oddball, but
he's also incredibly intelligent, and that is the root cause of his
reclusiveness.  Throughout the film, Zero describes his investigation
technique in a "how-to" voiceover, and it is here that he explains the key
to his success: "the two 'obs'"--objectivity and observation.  In becoming
the best P.I. in the world, Zero has mastered the art of objectivity,
literally and figuratively detaching himself from the rest of the world.
When the investigation forces him to deal directly with Gloria, Zero is
treated to his first genuine emotional human contact and a glimpse of what
real life is about--direct involvement, not objective observation.  This is
not to say that Zero Effect degenerates into something sappy and
touchy-feely; the power of the relationship and its effects on Zero and
Gloria derives from its subtle execution.
Zero Effect is not a perfect debut for Kasdan (son of Lawrence); in
addition to the by-the-numbers mystery, there is also a weak subplot
revolving around the strain Arlo's work puts on his relationship with his
girlfriend (Angela Featherstone).  But even in its flawed form, Zero Effect
is a lot more accomplished and mature than a lot of work by more
established filmmakers.

Title
Review for Best Laid Plans (1999)
_Best_Laid_Plans_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
I have much to say about _Best_Laid_Plans_, but I'm afraid that I can't
really say much of anything about it.  To go into detail is to ruin the
biggest pleasure the film has to offer--and if I did that, I'm afraid
there's not too much else left to enjoy in director Mike Barker's
interesting but ultimately underwhelming film.
The film opens with two old college buddies, Nick (Alessandro Nivola)
and Bryce (Josh Brolin), talking over drinks at a bar in their small
hometown of Tropico.  With the entrance of a fetching young blonde (Reese
Witherspoon), the film fades out, and when it fades back in, a few hours
have passed, and Bryce finds himself in a predicament that he feels only
Nick can bail him out of--Bryce had sex with the girl, who, as it turns
out, is underage, and in a panic, he tied her up and is holding her
hostage in the basement.
The rest of _Best_Laid_Plans_ should be left a mystery; needless to say,
as the title implies, there are some plans involved, and, in turn, the
implication that comes with calling them "best laid"--as in those of mice
and men, and, consequently, as in them going awry.  These plans, however,
are not what one would expect, and the series of twists upon twists that
writer Ted Griffin devises does keep one interested in what happens next.
The problem, however, is what appears to be the trademark of Griffin,
whose only other effort was the satirical cannibalism movie
_Ravenous_--that is, the blending of elements that aren't normally mixed.
 Grisly subject matter (with the bloody gore to match) and sometimes
broad satire were paired fairly uneasily in _Ravenous_, and here the odd
combo is that of a dark, mean-spirited thriller with straightforward
romantic elements.  It would take very skilled jugglers in the writing
and directing departments to mix these opposite ends of the emotional
spectrum without appearing to exhibit a split personality, which, I'm
afraid, is how _Best_Laid_Plans_ comes off; the most telling moment is
the film's resolution, which adds a lethally unnatural flavor of sugar to
the film's black bile.
The actors, for the most part, fare well under the circumstances; Nivola
is convincing (if unspectacular), and Witherspoon, who has never given a
bad performance, doesn't break her streak here.  The weakest link is
Brolin's annoying Bryce, but in his defense, a lot of that is the fault
of the writing; Bryce displays very few, if any, redeeming qualities,
making one wonder why Nick would keep him as a friend--and thus removing
any resonance from the whole "betrayal of friendship" theme.
Which brings us back to the title.  Barker and Griffin had some
interesting ingredients in place for this noirish thriller, and obviously
had an intriguingly twisty course clearly mapped out for themselves. 
Alas, much like those mice and men...

Title
Review for South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)
_South_Park:_Bigger,_Longer_&_Uncut_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
The notoriously naughty youngsters of controversial animated
_South_Park_ have hit the big screen, and if you're a living, breathing,
flesh-and-blood human being, chances are that there will be at least one
thing about this _Bigger,_Longer_&_Uncut_ adventure that you will find
completely, totally offensive.  No one is safe: women, Jews, blacks,
gays, Canadians--not even fans of the series itself are free from
co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's all-encompassing satirical net. 
Not even non-fans such as myself can escape, for this relentless,
envelope-obliterating comedy is, quite simply, one of the sharpest and
funniest films one is likely to see in this or any other year.
The _South_Park_ series never had more than a negligible novelty value
for me; after 15 minutes, not only did the TV-MA crudity of the language
and subject matter get old, but so did the restrictions of being on basic
cable.  To me, Parker and Stone always seemed to be on to something but
were never quite allowed to get there; though they operated under more
relaxed standards at Comedy Central, those were standards nonetheless. 
In the R-rated arena of the big screen, all bets are off, and Parker and
Stone take full advantage of the freedom to take aim at everyone and
everything, in any way they see _un_fit.
So it should come as no surprise that their long list of mercilessly
skewered targets includes, among others, the aforementioned groups as
well as figures such as the Baldwin brothers, Bill Gates, Barbra
Streisand, and--to the delight of many an audience member--Jar Jar Binks.
 What is surprising is, though, is that perhaps their most prominent
target is themselves.  In a refreshing, smartly self-referential twist,
_Bigger,_Longer_&_Uncut_'s plot revolves around the effect that an
R-rated animated feature has on the familiar four of Stan Marsh, Kyle
Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and the perpetually ill-fated Kenny McCormick
(all voiced by either Parker or Stone), as well as the rest of the young
population of South Park.  With all the gradeschoolers now cursing
bluestreaks around family and foulmouthed friends, Kyle's mom (Mary Kay
Bergman) decides to take drastic action, setting off an outrageous chain
of events that comes to involve Saddam Hussein and his bedfellow--in
_every_ sense of the word--Satan himself.
To run through many more of those burned along Parker and Stone's
gleefully politically incorrect way would not only be pointless and
boring, but it also would spoil too many of the film's stinging jokes. 
But one target worth mentioning is the reigning king of animated
features, Disney.  _Bigger,_Longer_&_Uncut_ is just as much a satire of
the Mouse's sacred animated musical Formula as it is _South_Park_ itself.
 Stan's opening number is an affectionate, if very tongue-in-cheek,
send-up of _Beauty_and_the_Beast_'s classic curtain-raiser "Belle"; there
is even an earnest, heart-tugging "I Want" power ballad.  Parker's
uniquely absurdist twist on the latter is that the tune is soulfully
crooned by Satan.  There is more to Parker and Mark Shaiman's (who
composed the instrumental score) songs than just witty context and
bitingly hilarious lyrics; the melodies are genuinely infectious. 
Impossible though it may seen, a song bearing the says-it-all title
"Uncle Fucka" is just as memorable for its toe-tapping tune as it is its
proudly profane lyrics.  (OK, maybe not _as_ memorable, but the catchy
melody also lingers long in the mind.)
_South_Park:_Bigger,_Longer_&_Uncut_ will undoubtedly draw the ire of
many a political group as being a sterling example of the "impure" state
of popular entertainment today.  Is the film inappropriate for children? 
YES; they don't come much more adults-only than this one.  Is it
offensive?  Indeed it is.  But peel away the profuse profanity and
go-for-broke comic abandon, and the film ironically reveals a message as
wholesome and constructive as any G-rated film could offer: take
responsibilty for your children, in what they do and in especially what
they watch--certain films are designated as being for adults for a
reason.  The even greater irony is that a lot of parents looking for a
film "for the family" are certain to pay less attention to
_Bigger,_Longer_&_Uncut_'s R rating than to the fact that it is "a
cartoon."

Title
Review for Cast Away (2000)
_Cast_Away_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
Given that _Cast_Away_'s entire story course is indiscreetly divulged in
its trailer, it is easy to blame the Fox marketing department for the air
of disappointment that comes with watching the film.  And, indeed, they
do shoulder a lot of the blame, for the story holds absolutely no
suspense for anyone who's seen the widely-played trailer; the outcome is
never in doubt, and at times it is possible for one to count the minutes
before certain already-known plot points occur.
That latter scenario is possible, but not probable, and that is due in
large part to Tom Hanks, who reteams with his _Forrest_Gump_ director
Robert Zemeckis for this ambitious drama.  A large portion of the film is
a one-man show, and Hanks more than pulls off the difficult, often
wordless task.  Since he has won so many awards for past work, it is
tempting for skeptics to turn their noses up and gag at the prospect of
yet another Oscar nomination for Hanks.  But his terrific work here,
coming with the seal of approval of the New York Film Critics Circle (who
awarded him their Best Actor trophy this year), is proof positive that he
is one of the most gifted and versatile acting talents of our time.  It
just so happens that he has won a number of accolades for past work and
that he is enormously popular with the general public.
Hanks plays Federal Express employee Chuck Noland, whose workaholic
tendencies tear him away from girlfriend Kelly Frears (a simply adequate
Helen Hunt) and onto a Malaysia-bound plane on Christmas.  The plane goes
down, as does everyone on the plane save Chuck, who is left to fend for
himself on a deserted island.  With only a volleyball companion named
Wilson by his side, Chuck undergoes a years-long emotional and
psychological transformation that is even more dramatic than his physical
one.
Zemeckis plays the engrossing Chuck-on-the-island meat of the film
perfectly--as in, as close to reality as possible.  There is no score,
just the ambient source noise of the largely sun-drenched setting.  He
and writer William Broyles Jr. also don't employ a voiceover or, even
worse, make Chuck think out loud; like anyone in his situation, Chuck
does utter a word here and there--mostly when overcome by emotion or
excitement--but for the most part, he remains silent.  Again, credit goes
to Hanks for clearly conveying those thoughts in his face without
speaking a single word.
As I have stated earlier, the Fox marketing department is not the only
target for blame over _Cast_Away_'s underachievement.  Make no
mistake--the film is a fascinating and thought-provoking entertainment,
propelled by one of the best performances of the year.  But it never
quite develops into the great film that it, at times, flirts with
becoming, and that is due to the script.  I won't pull a Fox myself and
give away how the film turns out, but the resolution of the film and to
the provocative issues it raises is rushed, overly tidy, and not
completely satisfying.  Instead of soaring from the strong buildup that
preceded it, the ending just coasts along on the good will it fostered in
the previous passages.
Who does soar, however, is Hanks, and his already-complex performance
just deepens in the final act.  On paper, there isn't much to Chuck, yet
the viewer grows to care a great deal about him.  Part of that can be
written off as a side benefit of Hanks' innate likability (which has
never been more valuable to a role), but like any great acting display,
Hanks fills in the blanks and brings the character to full-bodied life. 
_Cast_Away_ may  ultimately underachieve, but the soul that Hanks brings
to the role--and the film--must not be underrated.

Title
Review for Mansfield Park (1999)
_Mansfield_Park_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Writer-director Patricia Rozema has received some heat for taking more
than a few liberties in adapting Jane Austen's third novel, which is
about a poor young woman named Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor as an adult)
who is shipped off to live with her wealthy aunt (Lindsay Duncan) and
uncle (Harold Pinter) in Mansfield Park.  There, she falls for her cousin
Edmund Bertram (Jonny Lee Miller), and the feeling is mutual.  In true
Austen style, however, happiness is not easily in the cards, especially
not after the arrival of Henry and Mary Crawford (Alessandro Nivola and
Embeth Davidtz), a wealthy brother-sister pair of Londoners who set their
sights on Fanny and Edmund, respectively.
The one revision with which Austen purists have taken issue is the
reimagining of the character of Fanny.  In the original novel, she is a
passive character; here, Rozema has used the actual journals of Austen
herself to give Fanny a sharp-tongued voice.  This incarnation of Fanny
may not have been what Austen had in mind, but she surely would have
approved, for the injection of attitude and smarts makes _Mansfield_Park_
a much more wicked and irresistible social satire, with Fanny frequently
needling the pomposity of her rich relations.  The cast is splendid--in
particular O'Connor, Davidtz, and Nivola--as is the entire, entertaining
film.

Title
Review for Happy Accidents (2000)
_Happy_Accidents_ (R) *** (out of ****)
        While at its core a romantic comedy, Brad Anderson's _Happy_Accidents_
defies conventional categorization, and that's undoubtedly the reason why it's
taken so long to make its way to screens (shot and set in 1999, the film fell
off the radar after premiering at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival).  That very
unconventional quality also what makes the film so well worth seeking out.
        And seeking out is what it'll take to find _Happy_Accidents_, for in
keeping with its low-budget indie roots, the film is appearing only in a handful
of arthouses--a shame, since this is as commercial a romantic comedy as
mainstream Hollywood has put out all year, not to mention an even more
satisfying one.  Marisa Tomei has her first worthy role in years as Ruby Weaver,
a hopelessly romantic single in New York City with an unfortunate knack for
hooking up with guys with problem.  One day at the park she meets Sam Deed
(Vincent D'Onofrio), and not only is the attraction instantaneous, it looks like
he could be the perfect, normal guy she'd always wanted.  Alas, bliss is
short-lived when Sam drops the whopper to end all whoppers: he claims that he is
originally from Dubuque, Iowa... in the year 2470.
        That Ruby's reluctant decision to hang on to Sam is completely
believable owes a lot to D'Onofrio's performance.  He delivers the increasingly
convoluted back story with the right balance of wry humor and earnestness that
keeps the audience continually off-balance as to whether Sam is telling the
truth or downright insane.  D'Onofrio is also so naturally warm a performer that
one cares for the character regardless of his mental state, and he strikes
quirky but no less potent sparks with the ideally cast Tomei, who nails both
Ruby's comic neuroses and genuine, soul-deep romantic yearning.  Unlike
Anderson's previous comic meditation on romantic fate, _Next_Stop_Wonderland_,
one is given convincing reasons why these two could, indeed, be destined to be
together, as Sam often insists.
        That idea of balance is the key to the success of _Happy_Accidents_. 
Anderson strikes the right note in the humor, relying on a subtler, more
natural, situation- and personality-driven comedy than broad, buffoonish
physical gags.  Similarly modulated are the sci-fi touches; Sam's stories of
"the future" are outlandish but follow a certain plausible logic that could very
well account for their truth.  Most impressive about _Happy_Accidents_ is how
Anderson is able to make the two seemingly incompatible genres of sci-fi and
romantic comedy mesh into a seamless whole that remains completely convincing
even at its most disbelief-tempting.

Title
Review for Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)
_Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_, writer Lona Williams and director Michael Patrick
Jann's dark mock documentary details the events leading up to Mount Rose,
Minnesota's American Teen Princess pageant, namely the rivalry between
two leading candidates: rich bitch Becky Leeman (Denise Richards),
daughter of the pageant coordinator and former Teen Princess (Kirstie
Alley); and trailer park good girl Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), daughter
of a former runner-up (Ellen Barkin).  Williams and Jann's targets are
easy ones--pageants, Minnesotans, small towns--but the film bats a
surprisingly low hit-to-miss ratio, with the truly inspired moments (the
wheelchair-bound, anorexic reigning Teen Princess's wincingly hilarious
musical number) lost in a sea of just plain unfunny ones (Amber's mother
gets a beer can permanently fused to her hand after an explosion).  Also
a big miss is the predictable "mystery" element to the film, which has a
number of contestants meeting untimely eliminations from competition. 
Ultimately, _Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_ exhibits a lot of attitude, but not a
whole lot of smarts.
Dunst has much better luck with the _other_, much more intelligent
satire she is also currently starring in, _Dick_.  In what can be
described as "teenage Romy and Michele take down the president," teen dim
bulbs Betsy (Dunst) and Abigail (Michelle Williams) fall into the good
graces of President Nixon (Dan Hedaya) and the positions of "Official
White House Dog Walkers" after witnessing the Watergate break-in. 
Indeed, it is not the most promising of premises, but director Andrew
Fleming, along with Sheryl Longin, writing collaborator turn it into gold
by deftly weaving fact and fiction into a wholly convincing--and
hilarious--tapestry.  For instance, we learn the "true" origin of Tricky
Dick's famous stance as well as what was on those missing 18 and a half
minutes on Nixon's tapes (nothing criminal, but perhaps something more
embarrassing).  Ironically, it is those clever details that will likely
lead _Dick_ to suffer the same weak box office fate that befell another
savvy satire, last spring's _Election_--it is simply too smart (and, in
this case, too historical) for its targeted teen audience.  (_Dick_ opens
August 4)

Title
Review for She's All That (1999)
_She's_All_That_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
While watching the teen comedy _She's_All_That_, I fondly recalled the
heyday of the _Ricki_Lake_ show a couple of years back, when just about
every episode of the gabfest dealt with self-absorbed people who thought
they were, well, all that.  What a field day Ricki's then-notoriously rowdy
audience would have with the makeover of the film's Laney Boggs, a frumpy,
long-haired high school geek who turns chic after a touch of makeup,
wardrobe overhaul, and, most importantly, a haircut.  To paraphrase the
title of one of my favorite _Ricki_ episodes, "You may have lost all that
hair, but you are _not_ all that."
The failure of the makeover in question is quite surprising, considering
the fact that the actress playing Laney, Rachael Leigh Cook, is actually
quite attractive, as briefly seen in last fall's _Living_Out_Loud_ and in
_She's_All_That_'s poster.  Be it makeup, styling, or whatever, Laney
doesn't look quite so "all that" in her first post-makeover appearance,
gussied up in a flaming red dress, matching high heels, and a shorter 'do.
This sounds like a minor quibble, but the entire film hinges upon it, for
the next day at school social outcast Laney not only finds herself to
suddenly popular, but also a nominee for prom queen.
While this comes as a surprise to Laney, it's actually a calculated move
by soccer team stud Zack Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who, recently jilted
by his diva girlfriend Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), makes a bet with
his friends that he can turn the seemingly hopeless Laney into the prom
queen.  As one can expect, as he brings the swan out of his ugly duckling,
Zack begins to feel something genuine for Laney, and her for him.
A rather far-fetched plot that has been done in one, way, shape, or form
many a time, but what makes it especially difficult to believe in
_She's_All_That_ is that Zack never really does anything for Laney.  His
sister Mackenzie (a heavily made-up Anna Paquin) is the one who gives her
the life-altering makeover, and Zack's most dramatic "show of support" is
actually a defense of Laney's brother Simon (Kieran Culkin).  Factor in a
lack of sparks between Prinze and Cook, and one is left with a romantic
comedy with little in the way of romance.
On the other hand, neither is there much comedy on display, either, with
the only successful bits coming from the wild overacting of Matthew Lillard
as Taylor's new beau Brock Hudson, and some savvy satire of MTV's
_The_Real_World_, of which Brock is a former cast member; one big gross-out
gag is just that, and not particularly funny.  Other laughs are to be had,
but they are of the unintentional variety, stemming from the sloppiness of
director Robert Iscove and writer R. Lee Fleming Jr.  The hairpiece that
Cook wears during Lacey's long hair stage is hilariously obvious; a
choreographed set piece at the prom is apparently designed to be "good,"
but it's more bizarre than anything else, especially the moves.  Sloppiest
of all is the inclusion of R&B sensation Usher Raymond in the completely
superfluous role of the school DJ.  Watching his scenes, I suspect that he
was spliced in after principal photography had already been completed: most
of his scenes are by himself, and the one scene that shows his character
with others--the prom--intercuts solo closeup shots of him with distant
ones of the crowd.
Perhaps the saddest thing about _She's_All_That_ is that it's designed as
a breakout showcase for Cook, who is a natural and likable young actress.
I hope that this weak effort won't put a damper on her career, and she will
be given a more worthy vehicle where she can show that she could very well
be all that.

Title
Review for Godzilla (1998)
Reviewing a much-ballyhooed "event" movie like _Godzilla_ is a pointless
task.  No matter what I or any critic might say about it, everyone and
their mother will still rush out to the theatre to see the movie just to
say that they did.  But in the event that anyone out there is listening, be
forewarned that this lavish take on the classic Japanese monster movies is
a technically superb but flavorless piece of sci-fi hackwork.
_Godzilla_'s mediocrity should not come as a surprise to anyone familiar
with the work of the "brains" behind the project, the team of
co-writer/producer Dean Devlin and co-writer/director Roland Emmerich.  As
the film's many trailers so bombastically boast, they are the creators of
that overhyped sci-fi phenomenon of a couple year's back,
_Independence_Day_ (they were also behind another inexplicable success,
1994's ridiculous _StarGate_, as well as 1992's unspeakably horrid
Jean-Claude Van Damme-Dolph Lundgren battle royale _Universal_Soldier_).  I
was lukewarm on _ID4_ (it earned a fairly charitable ** 1/2 on my
scale--which elicited a rather snottily sarcastic e-mail from Devlin
himself), which had top-flight effects, a charismatic lead (the
incomparable Will Smith), but a sloppy script populated by poorly drawn
characters with vapid individual storylines.
_ID4_'s "human dimension" (which a lot of people actually bought into) is
as profound as _Schindler's List_'s in comparison to what is on display in
_Godzilla_--or, rather, what _isn't_ on display.  Our primary human guide
throughout the giant lizard mayhem is Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew
Broderick), a nuclear scientist who is enlisted by the military to
investigate the origins and analyze the behavior of the behemoth reptile
that is destroying New York City.  There, he is reunited with his college
sweetheart, aspiring reporter Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo, sporting wild
Sarah Jessica Parker-ish locks--a coincidence?).  Their love story is
supposed to be the emotional hook, but Devlin and Emmerich scarcely bother
to give them any quiet scenes alone together, so what's the point?
Broderick and Pitillo appear to not see one either, woodenly playing their
already-plywood roles and failing to generate any romantic spark whatsoever.
But the flat lead characters are the least of _Godzilla_'s problems.  The
film's fundamental flaw can best be summed up in the scene where the
creature's appearance is fully revealed.  The work of creature designer and
supervisor Patrick Tatopoulos does not disappoint; sort of a mix between a
T-rex, stegosaurus, and velociraptor with a little iguana thrown in,
Godzilla's look is truly menacing, and the big visual revelation should be
a moment of genuine fright and tension, much like the grand T-rex entrance
in _Jurassic_Park_.  But Emmerich completely misdirects the moment.  The
audience's first, uninterrupted glimpse is scored with some uplifting,
awe-inspiring music not unlike _Jurassic_'s main theme, and Niko's aghast
look is one more of wonder than fear, which is what I'm sure any person,
scientist or not, would feel in the presence of a giant, hungry lizard.
  This is but the first instance in Emmerich's complete botching of what
should be a key element in _Godzilla_--terror.  For all the destruction
Godzilla causes, and the threat he poses to everyone's lives, the purported
"thrill ride" feels safe and is not scary in the slightest.  This is
especially the case in an extended sequence set in the destroyed Madison
Square Garden.  Without giving away a key plot "surprise," the sequence's
obvious model is the showcase raptor sequence in _Jurassic_ (in fact, so
much of _Godzilla_ is derivative of _Jurassic_ it might as well have been
called _Godzilla_Park_), but Emmerich and Devlin mistake quantity for
quality.  If you see the film, you'll know what I mean--the threat to the
"heroes" is considerably larger, but I never once felt that they were in
any danger.
The always-visually exciting (as opposed to just plain exciting)
_Godzilla_ would have gone down a bit easier if there was a greater dose of
humor.  Unlike _ID4_, which had a comic firecracker at its center in Smith,
Godzilla's stabs at humor are few and, frankly, not terribly funny.  Hank
Azaria, as news cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti, tries to make the most
of the blah wisecracks he's assigned to deliver.  A running dig at Roger
Ebert--the stocky, silver-haired, bespackled mayor (Michael Lerner) is also
named Ebert, and an upturned thumb is his big campaign gesture--grows old
quickly.  An injokey dig at Warner Bros. and Disney, numerous lame verbal
gags involving Niko's Greek surname, Harry Shearer's pompous news anchor
(who is not too far from one of his _Simpsons_ roles, newsman Kent
Brockman), and some comic stoicism by Jean Reno (playing--what else?--a
shady Frenchman) round out the film's light touches.  As a whole, the film
takes itself much too seriously--much like Devlin and Emmerich themselves.
The terrible twosome have proclaimed themselves the Lucas and Spielberg of
this generation (a sad testimony), which could not be farther from the
truth.  While they are adept at handling the technical aspects of
effects-laden extravaganzas (_Godzilla_ is, if anything, a superlative
technical achievement, terrifically designed by Oliver Scholl and shot by
Ueli Steiger), they have yet to display any of the imagination, creativity,
or solid ideas of George and Steven.  What ideas they do have only work
within the confines of two-minute trailers, which are always far superior
to the full films themselves.   The fact that hype-brainwashed moviegoers
don't ever appear to care--and pre-sold _Godzilla_ certainly won't break
the mass hypnosis--shows that their true calling lies within the offices of
a studio's marketing department and _not_ on the creative end of the film
business.

Title
Review for Next Friday (2000)
        Released in 1995, the low-budget comedy _Friday_ was obviously meant  to
be a big showcase for its co-writer/star/executive producer, Ice Cube. 
However, it was Cube's co-star, a then-unknown stand-up comedian by the 
name of Chris Tucker, who was ultimately credited for the film's modest 
but solid box office returns and even greater popularity in video stores
(where it is still a rental and sales hit). With such a profitable
investment-to-return ratio, a follow-up is inevitable, so now we get to
see what happens _Next_Friday_. But with Tucker having long graduated
into bigger-budget starring roles, one wishes that Cube and New Line
Cinema had left well enough alone.
        Although it prominently featured the now-famous hyper comic stylings of
Tucker, the original _Friday_ was distinguished by its decidedly laid
back tone and execution. Sort of a lighthearted tonic against the
traditionally dour and violent cinematic portrayals of South Central Los
Angeles, the film followed one especially eventful 24 hours in the lives
of a close knit South Central neighborhood, and director F. Gary Gray
(who himself has moved on to higher-profile and -budget projects) and
writers Cube and DJ Pooh perfectly captured the often-lumbering rhythms
of everyday life: moments of eventful activity padded by stretches of
inactivity that is interesting in its own way. The film presented the 
'hood as a typical community, populated by people all with their own
little quirks, some more eccentric than others. As such, _Friday_ was, if
not exactly groundbreaking cinema, a likable film--not to mention at
times one that was quite funny, thanks to Tucker and his memorable
pothead character, the aptly named Smokey. 
        For _Next_Friday_, Cube (now writing solo) and director Steve Carr
decide to compensate for Tucker's absence (for the record, Smokey is
mentioned as being in drug rehab) by creating some manic energy of their
own in the script department. _Next_Friday_'s more quickly paced story
transplants Cube's rather blah Craig Jones from the 'hood to the home of
his uncle Elroy (Don "DC" Curry) and wisecracking cousin Day-Day (Mike
Epps), who--after winning the lottery--live in a fairly upscale
neighborhood in the suburban haven of Rancho Cucamonga. Craig is sent
there by his dog catcher father (John Witherspoon, the only other major
returnee) to stay out of trouble--which, of course, is not far behind: it
turns out the stereotypically boorish Latino drug dealers across the
street have a beef with Day-Day; and Deebo (Tommy "Tiny" Lister, Jr.),
the bully whom Craig had beaten at the end of the previous film, has
escaped from prison and is out for revenge. 
        Plot details such as these, however, take a back seat to individual
gags.  Where the first film was fairly grounded in reality, _Next_Friday_
is all about outrageousness. Craig's father spends most of the movie
wearing a uniform stained with dog excrement. Uncle Elroy indulges in
wild sex with his girlfriend Suga (Kym E. Whitley), who, in turn, would
like to "keep it in the family" and get down and dirty with Craig. 
Across the street, the drug dealers get down and dirty themselves with a
few "bitches" (which shows how well women are portrayed in this
installment). Craig gets into a knock-down, drag-out fight with the
flamboyant owner of the record store where Day-Day works. And, since it
wouldn't be a _Friday_ without it, there's a lot of marijuana, which is
given an even more prominent role. These bits may sound funny here in
print, but in execution--and when added to a number of other jokes
attempting the same shocking effect--it's all a bit too much.
        That could not be said of the original, whose easy-going way took its 
time to endear itself to the audience. _Next_Friday_ is always in your
face, and in laying on all the outrageousness, Cube sacrifices a key
element to _Friday_'s appeal: a surprising amount of heart. Not only does
_Next_Friday_ not have any, it also lacks any soul.

Title
Review for Muse, The (1999)
_The_Muse_ (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
"I've hit the wall," proclaims Albert Brooks's character toward the
beginning of _The_Muse_, and one may feel the same about the
writer-director-star after seeing his latest, which ends in a most
lackluster fashion.  But before the film hits that creative obstruction,
Brooks is able to get in a number of jabs at Hollywood, and elicits some
nice performances from his cast--that is, once he settles into a
comfortable comedic rhythm, which he takes his sweet time to establish.
That rhythm is established with the arrival of the title character,
played--in her neverending quest for respectability--by Sharon Stone, who
does fare well in this, her first major comic role.  Her mysterious Sarah
Little claims to be a bonafide daughter of Zeus, bearing the divine gift
of inspiration.  Boasting a long and illustrious list of satisfied
customers--including James Cameron, Rob Reiner, and, in the film's best
comic performance, Martin Scorsese--it takes fairly little to convince
jobless veteran screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) to employ her
services.
Stone obviously has fun sending up her high-maintenance diva image as
Sarah, whose gifts come at a steep price; Steven must pay for all of her
ridiculous extravagances, such as a deluxe suite at a four-star hotel to
late night gourmet snacking food.  The laughs arise from these situations
are as soft as can be expected, and while there are a few pieces of
dialogue where Brooks's famously caustic wit shines through (particularly
in Steven's scenes with pompous Hollywood industry types), the film's
sense of humor is characterized by a certain gentleness.  This makes for
pleasantly witty, smile-worthy viewing, but not necessarily gut-busting
hilarity, such as the prominent subplot where Sarah inspires Steven's
wife Laura (Andie MacDowell) to start up her own business while Steven
himself remains bereft of story ideas.
And that's what ultimately happens to Brooks and writing collaborator
Monica Johnson.  Hard answers about Sarah inevitably must come, and when
they do, _The_Muse_'s low-fi energy begins to wane.  That did not
necessarily have to be the case, however, if the explanations propelled
the story into a new direction.  Instead, though, Brooks and Johnson
paint themselves into a corner that they obviously had no idea how to get
out of, resorting to a twist ending that is as unsatisfying as it is
contrived.  Appropriately enough, it seems that Brooks and Johnson needed
a muse of their own to really make this film work.

Title
Review for Shaft (2000)
Cinematically speaking, Gordon Parks' original 1971 _Shaft_ is not a
great film.  A bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the
edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action, this
spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought Ernest Tidyman's
"black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks" to the big
screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking.
Yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre
it spawned, "blaxploitation," died with that decade--the 1971 _Shaft_
remains an extremely entertaining watch, never having completely escaped
pop culture consciousness.  The reason for this is the same one that
explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target
African-American audience: the title character of John Shaft.  While the
fact that the strong, smart, virile, and superbly suave Shaft is black is
the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance, his
broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race: he is
comfortable, confident, and proud about who he is, and anyone who had a
problem with that could simply kiss his ass.
This fact also explains why John Singleton's Y2G revival of John Shaft
is as enjoyable as it is.  Much like the film that started the franchise,
this _Shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department,
but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard
crime thrillers.
Contrary to what has been reported over the past few months, this
_Shaft_ is not a remake of the original film, but more of a
sequel/spinoff.  The star audiences know and love from the original film
and its first two sequels (1972's _Shaft's_Big_Score!_ and 1973's
_Shaft_in_Africa_), Richard Roundtree, once again plays John Shaft, who
still runs a private investigation firm in New York City.  However, the
focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew (Samuel L. Jackson), who,
as the film begins, is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly
leaves him at odds with his superiors.  When a privileged young man named
Walter Wade Jr. (Christian Bale) accused of a brutal, racially-motivated
murder is allowed to be released on bail, a disgusted Shaft leaves the
force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a P.I.
But that's easier said than done, for also standing in the way of Shaft
and his way of justice is Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright), a Dominican
gangster who is hired by Walter to rub out waitress Diane Palmieri (Toni
Collette), the only eyewitness to his crime.  Peoples--or, rather, Wright
is also the big obstacle in Jackson's way toward commanding this film. 
Peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running
time, and Wright is insanely funny during these stages.  However, he
isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish,
and Peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and
believable (which probably would not have been the case had he been
played by original casting choice John Leguizamo, who bowed out before
filming).  It's no easy task to steal a film from the Jackson (who is his
usual captivating, charismatic self here), but that's exactly what Wright
does--and makes it seem effortless.
Then again, with such a talented ensemble surrounding him, it is not too
surprising that Jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over
the rest; he is strongly complemented not only by Wright but all his
other co-stars.  Bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity
killer in _American_Psycho_, so it only follows that his performance as a
similar, less exaggerated character would be spot-on.  Collette lends the
film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened,
conflicted Diane.  Busta Rhymes brings some good laughs as Shaft's
sidekick Rasaan.  Registering not as strongly--but through no fault of
their own--are Vanessa Williams (as tough narcotics cop Carmen Vasquez)
and a dismayingly underused Roundtree; they simply are given little to do
in the script credited to Richard Price, Singleton, and Shane Salerno. 
(Jackson also has little to "do" in a sense; some throwaway footage
during the opening credits aside, his Shaft doesn't even have one sex
scene.)
That Singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an
especially good thing since he's not really an action director.  This is
not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the
requisite foot and car chases.  They move well (as does the film as a
whole) and are reasonably exciting; it's just that there's nothing
terribly inventive about them.  These set pieces are functional in the
way the script is: they work well enough, but they're unsurprising and
conventional.
But if there's anything that a _Shaft_ movie does well, it's make the
familiar look cool--and this _Shaft_ keeps that tradition alive.  From
the slick title sequence--scored, of course, to Isaac Hayes'
ever-infectious Oscar-winning theme song, which Singleton wisely
sprinkles throughout the film--on, the film looks great and easily sweeps
the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado.  Even a common
visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only
feels unforced, it feels necessary.  Style doesn't exactly make for a
great film, but when it comes to _Shaft_, that's of little consequence. 
What matters above all else is having a good time, and the latest _Shaft_
should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad
mutha--shut your mouth.

Title
Review for English Patient, The (1996)
all movies graded out of four stars (****)
The English Patient (R) ****
        All across the country critics and sell-out crowdshave been going
ga-ga over Anthony Minghella's adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's complex
WWII-set novel, and it's easy to see why.  This highly passionate and moving
drama centers on a severely burned, amnesiac pilot (Ralph Fiennes), who,
through, a series of flashbacks, puts together the pieces of his past, in
particular his intense love affair with a married woman (Kristin Scott
Thomas).  This love story plays against one blossoming between the pilot's
French Canadian nurse (Juliette Binoche) and an Indian bomb and mine defuser
(Naveen Andrews).  The film last a little over 160 minutes and takes its
time answering its own narrative questions, but one is completely captivated
throughout the entire film, thanks in no small part to the excellent
performances, the sizzling chemistry between Fiennes and Scott Thomas, and
the all-consuming passion and conviction of its story.  This very impressive
achievement for all involved is sure to be an Oscar contender next March.
Jingle All the Way (PG) ** 1/2
        If it weren't for the credits "A Brian Levant Film" and "Directed by
Brian Levant," one would be certain that the director behind this family
comedy was Home Alone's Chris Columbus, for its wall-to-wall slapstick sure
bears the Columbus stamp (he actually only produced).  If you know what I'm
talking about, then you know all you really need to know about this tale of
two stressed-out fathers (Arnold Schwarzenegger and a scene-stealing Sinbad)
trying to find the hottest action figure of the season, Turbo Man, on
Christmas Eve to give to their respective sons.  The first hour is what you
would expect from a Columbus production, with cartoony fights, lots of stuff
being knocked down and tripped over, and ceaseless mugging (which, needless
to say, is _not_ Schwarzenegger's strong suit).  What keeps this kidpleaser
from being completely tired is the surprising special effects-laden final
act.  No point in blowing the specifics, but this film's closing twenty
minutes or so are more funny and entertaining than the hour which precedes
it.  Only a must-see for Arnold fanatics and fans of that broad,
oh-so-Columbus-y brand of slapstick.
Shine (PG-13) *** 1/2
        Scott Hicks's film of the life story of Australian pianist David
Helfgott is inspiring, memorable cinema--the kind of film that Oscar voters
go ga-ga for.  We follow David (played as a child by Alex Rafalowicz, then
as an adolescent by Noah Taylor) as he gains early fame for his remarkable
talent and then, while studying at London's Royal College, suffer a
debiliatating mental breakdown--thanks in no small part to the stress put on
him by his domineering father (Armin Mueller-Stahl).  Years pass, and
40-something David (now played by Geoffrey Rush) is a mumbling mental case
prone to public nudity and grabbing women's breasts.  But slowly, surely,
with the help of friends and the love of a woman (Lynn Redgrave), he finds
his way back to the piano and the glory that came with it.
        Shine is at its best in its first half, focusing on the fascinating
and heartbreaking relationship between father and son--brought to vivid life
by Taylor and Mueller-Stahl, who is so painfully real as a man who obviously
loves his son immensely yet just can't express it the right way.  The second
half is highly involving and inspiring, but without the captivating
Mueller-Stahl and the compelling father-son dynamic at the forefront, it
can't quite match the emotional power of the opening.  Even the ending
doesn't pack the punch one would expect, but Hicks should be commended for
that, for the light close is in line with his admirable eschewing of overt
melodramatics.  Like The Crying Game back in 1992, Shine should be "the
little indie that could"; with a passionate groundswell of support, it will
undoubtedly be a major award contender in March.
The War at Home (R) * 1/2
        Director-star Emilio Estevez's Vietnam vet drama is a mess, pure and
simple.  In this adaptation of James Duff's play Homefront (Duff also wrote
the screenplay), Estevez plays an embittered vet who comes home to his
family in 1972 Texas; his tensions with the family form the center of the
film.  Kathy Bates is fabulous as Estevez's histrionic nag of a mother, and
Martin Sheen and Kimberly Williams also shine as Estevez's father and
sister.  The root of the film's troubles?  Estevez himself, both in front of
and behind the camera.  As an actor, Estevez doesn't have the range to pull
off the emotional fluctuations of the character; the fact that he is also
not the warmest presence onscreen makes it hard to care about his central
character.  The even greater problems lie in his direction.  The tone of the
piece is completely confused; most of the scenes of familial tension and
arguing play as farce, and at the drop of a hat the music changes, people
start yelling and crying, and everything is played in earnest.  Sometimes
the tones overlap--in one dramatic moment, an upset Bates yells at and slaps
Estevez, and suddenly Sheen brings up the subject of stolen peanut
brittle--and the audience isn't sure exactly how to feel, whether to cry or
laugh.  In the end, I don't know if anyone will know exactly what emotional
reaction Estevez was going after; I sure didn't.

Title
Review for Grease 2 (1982)
Grease 2 (PG) no stars; **** for camp value (out of ****)
While Paramount was busy preparing the 20th anniversary celebration of the
original Grease, last year the studio let the 15th anniversary of its 1982
sequel discreetly pass by.  And that's hardly a surprise.  Grease 2, a box
office catastrophe, is widely considered to be one of the worst sequels
ever made; in fact, it just may be one of the worst _films_ ever made.  But
over the years, this dreadful film has developed a quiet cult following,
and even that, too, is hardly a surprise, for Grease 2, in its sheer
awfulness, is one of the best camp entertainments you could ever find.
The idea behind Grease 2 isn't so bad--essentially it's a reverse-gender
rehash of the original, with Sandy's clean-cut cousin (a very lame link to
the first film) Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield) pining for bad girl
Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first starring role).  But just
about everything that could go wrong with the film did, starting with the
story.  Stephanie, of course, has no interest in wholesome, brainy Michael,
telling him she wants (in an unintentionally hilarious number, but more on
that later) "a cool rider."  So Michael secretly takes motorcycle lessons
and indeed becomes a slick biker stud that instantly catches Stephanie's
eye.  The catch is that the shy Michael pretends his studly self is a
completely separate person, causing him much distress.  What makes all of
this even more ridiculous is that all Michael uses to conceal his true
identity is where goggles with yellow lenses.
But the preposterousness of Michael's ruse is the least of that
character's problems.  The biggest is the actor who plays him, Caulfield,
who exudes no charisma and, worst of all, cannot carry a single musical
note worth a damn.  I guess he was cast on his looks, but what good are
looks in a film that is dependent on singing?  Pfeiffer, as she evidenced
years later in The Fabulous Baker Boys, can sing adequately, and she
displays a verve and spunk that somewhat foretold her hugely successful
acting career.  Notice I said "acting career," because if her dancing
during her showcase "Cool Rider" number is any indication, she would have
crashed and burned pursuing musical theater.  But it's her utter lack of
mind-body coordination that makes "Cool Rider" one of the high-lowlights of
the entire film; is there anything as entertaining as seeing a currently
established star completely go for broke and make an ass of herself on the
way to the top?
However, Pfeiffer cannot take all of the credit/blame for the
mini-masterpiece of camp that is "Cool Rider."  At least half of that load
goes to the songwriting crew of composer Louis St. Louis and a host of
lyricists that would rather not be mentioned here and won't be.  St.
Louis's melodies aren't terrible, just not very memorable.  What is
memorable about Grease 2's song score--for all the wrong reasons--are the
chowderheaded lyrics.  Take this gem from the numb-skulled seduction song
"Let's Do It for Our Country": "Let's do it for our country/The red, white,
and the blue/Let's do it for our country/Uncle Sam would want us to."  Or
this one from the execrable sex-education tune "Reproduction":
"Reproduction (reproduction)/Put your pollen tube to work/Reproduction
(reproduction)/Make my stamen go berserk."  Or better yet, my favorite
lyric, from "Who's That Guy?", in which Michael debuts his bad boy alter
ego: "Who's that guy/On that motorcycle/What would they say if they knew it
was Michael?"  Believe it or not, St. Louis and company do crank out a
couple of passable songs.  The ballad "Charades" nicely sums up Michael's
inner conflict, but the song is completely mangled by Caulfield's so-called
vocal stylings.  "(Love Will) Turn Back the Hands of Time" is nowhere near
a "You're the One that I Want," but as the big love duet, it's functional.
Too bad tone-deaf Caulfield warbles the male part, and the number is staged
by director/choreographer Patricia Birch (who choreographed the original
Grease) as a beyond-cheesy fantasy sequence, in which Stephanie, believing
her "cool rider" to be dead, envisions meeting him in a white, smoke-filled
soundstage heaven where he stands atop a pile of motorcycles.
But that's just one in a long line of stellar directorial choices by
Birch, who, being a choreographer by trade, has a fetish for huge group
dance numbers (six by my count).  Birch never directed a film again, and
that is just as well, for there is no way she could have possibly topped
the choice cut of bad movie nirvana that is Grease 2.  I guess there's
always hope for a 20th anniversary rerelease in 2002...   (Paramount Home

Review for Urban Legends: Final Cut (2000)
_Urban_Legends:_Final_Cut_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
The original _Urban_Legend_ grossed only $38 million at U.S. theatres in
the fall of 1998, but given how cheaply (in _every_ conceivable meaning
of the word) that horror flick was produced, a profit was
inevitable--and, of course, a sequel.  However,
_Urban_Legends:_Final_Cut_ is less sequel than very loose spinoff--a good
thing, considering how abysmally ludicrous the original was.  But to say
that the new film is a step above its predecessor isn't saying much at
all, for _Final_Cut_ simply takes a more tolerable approach to the same
sort of slasher silliness.
_UL2_ (as the title initially appears onscreen) marks the feature
directorial debut of film virtuoso John Ottman, who has already made a
name for himself as a score composer and film editor (two positions he
once again holds here in addition to the directing reins); his
contributions are what elevate the film above the original.  His most
savvy move was the casting of unknown Jennifer Morrison, who does a much
more capable job in the lead than the unimpressive Alicia Witt in the
first film.  Morrison is likable and convincing as Amy, one of a number
of student filmmakers at Alpine University vying for the prestigious
Hitchcock Award for best thesis film--which, we are repeatedly told,
"guarantees a career in Hollywood."
With that preposterous plot point, writers Scott Derrickson and Paul
Harris Boardman immediately throw all story plausibility out the
window--long before various co-eds get bumped off by a mysterious
stranger wearing a fencing mask.  Of course, all these students are all
in the running for the Hitchcock, and presumably the masked murderer is
killing to get his or her hands on the award and that coveted career.
Much to Ottman's credit, the requisite scare sequences are refreshingly
light on the cheap fakeout (which was plentiful in _UL1_), and they are
done with a reasonable sense of style and some dark, cheeky humor; this
is especially the case with the first major murder scene, which begins
with a riff on the "kidney heist" urban legend.  However, though the film
is called _Urban_Legends_, this is the only concrete reference to that
idea.  Amy's thesis film is supposed about an urban legend killer
(namely, the story of the first film), but all the "legends" are invented
ones.  And the one major tie to _UL1_, the character of security guard
Reese (Loretta Devine, again wasted), adds nothing to the mix.
Which begs the question--why even make this film as an _Urban_Legend_
sequel?  The answer is simple: without the tangential ties to the first
film, _UL2_ would too obviously be a low-rent version of the also
moviemaking-themed _Scream_3_.  Ottman does what he can to make this bad
idea work (there are some stylishly edited visuals, and his score is up
to his standards), but ultimately he and the actors--excepting _Blossom_
alum Joey (I refuse to call him by his new, official moniker of "Joseph")
Lawrence, whose work is dreadful all around--must go down the path laid
down by the writers, and the course they have mapped out is not pretty.
The subtitle of _Urban_Legends_, _Final_Cut_, is meant to be a play on
words referring to filmmaking and the slice-and-dice killings, but one
can only hope it also means something else--that this is the final lame-o
youth horror film we see in a very long time.

Title
Review for There's Something About Mary (1998)
There's something about the Farrelly brothers: in this age of political
correctness, the writing/directing duo of Bobby and Peter is not afraid to
throw caution and, above all else, good taste to the wind in pursuit of a
good laugh.  While their go-for-broke style certainly offends as many, if
not more, people than it entertains, anyone who can tap into their truly
sick and twisted wavelength will find a mother lode of laughs in their
latest effort, the often disgusting, constantly shocking, but always
hilarious _There's_Something_About_Mary_.
If the Farrellys pushed the envelope of decency with their previous
lowbrow outings, the PG-13 rated _Dumb_and_Dumber_ and _Kingpin_, then they
tear it to shreds in the R-rated _Mary_.  The film's poster features a
rather innocent, almost ironic-sounding disclaimer ("Warning: the guys who
did _Dumb_and_Dumber_ and _Kingpin_ bring you a love story"), but it is a
warning worth heeding.  Plotwise, _Mary_ does fits the bill of a
traditional romantic comedy.  Thirteen years after graduation, Rhode
Island-based loser Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller), still pines for his
glamorous high school love, Mary Jenson (Cameron Diaz), with whom he was
supposed to go to the senior prom; needless to say, things did not quite
work out.  Determined to have another chance at her, Ted hires sleazy
insurance claims investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down in
her new home city of Miami--and that he does, only to pursue Mary, now an
improbably glam orthopedic surgeon, for himself.
Sounds like typical romantic fluff, but it is far from it.  Remember that
warning?  While the plot covers bases seen in other, tamer romantic
comedies, the brand of humor that is explored along the way is of the
lowest brow.  If the diarrhea and bull semen gags in _Dumb_ and _Kingpin_,
respectively, can be considered "toilet humor," than what the Farrellys
delve into in _Mary_ is the waste product itself; "gross-out" humor seems
too mild a term.  A number of bodily functions (exactly which and how, I
will leave as a surprise) provide the basis of some big laughs, as do gags
involving drugged dogs, gay sex, and, yes, the physically and mentally
challenged.  If this sounds offensive to you, it is.  But its that giddy,
vulgar sense of abandon, doing unspeakable things just extreme enough that
it cannot be taken seriously, that makes the brothers such a unique voice
in comedy.  And one of the most refreshing.
As with all comedies, some gags clank.  A Greek chorus-like singer
(Jonathan Richman), who, along with an accompanying drummer, appears
sporadically to comment on the action, grows old after the first two
"spontaneous" appearances (though he is given a satisfying sendoff); and a
sight gag revolving around Ted's best friend Dom's (Chris Elliott)
sensitive skin condition is not so much funny as just unpleasant to look
at.  But the Farrellys' hit-to-miss ratio is well over .500, rebounding
from duds with some unbelievable showstoppers (such as an outrageous sight
gag that will make all men cringe and cross their legs) and an able cast
that must be commended for, above all else, their incredible bravery to do
some of the things they are called on to do.
It is hard to predict what exactly will be the box office fate of
_There's_Something_About_Mary_; for each person that "gets" the Farrelly
brothers' demented sense of humor, there is sure to be at least two that
are completely, totally disgusted.  But for me and the others on their
warped vibe, _Mary_ is bad, dirty fun.

Title
Review for Sphere (1998)
Barry Levinson's adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel Sphere has more in
common with the story's focal otherworldly orb than just its title.  The
sphere is luminous and hauntingly beautiful on the surface, with its
interior kept alluringly, frustratingly unclear--much like the
superficially diverting but ultimately disappointing film itself.
A four-man team comprised of psychologist Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman),
biochemist Beth Halperin (Sharon Stone), mathematician Harry Adams (Samuel
L. Jackson), and astrophysicist Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) is recruited
by the government to investigate the wreckage of a crashed spacecraft at
the bottom of the ocean.  Inside the spacecraft, the team discover a giant,
glowing, golden sphere of unknown origin.  But soon after this discovery,
strange, life-threatening occurrences befall the team in their undersea
station, from the appearance of giant sea creatures to online contact with
a possibly extraterrestrial lifeform.
This is a solid jumping-off point for a intelligent, suspenseful sci-fi
thriller, and while there are some very effective moments, the murky script
by Stephen Hauser and Paul Attanasio keeps Sphere from taking on a defined
shape.  Sphere does eventually offer answers to its mysteries, but the
information is often too unclearly stated and clumsily delivered.  Tune out
for one second, and one crucial, isolated line of dialogue that reveals one
of the film's key mysteries is lost, the information never to be repeated
again.  One more irksome miscalculation was the division of the action with
chapter title inserts, such as "The Surface," "The Deep," "The Spacecraft,"
and so on.  I suppose the purpose was to underscore certain important parts
of each section, but the chapter divisions hamper the building of any
suspense, which is hard to sustain once an obtrusive title card appears.
But Levinson is able to overcome that start-and-stop rhythm and  gradually
build tension, resulting in some memorable shock scenes.  The film's final
act, where suspicion is hovers over all of the central characters, is
particularly tense and well-acted by the three above-the-title stars.  It
is quite refreshing to see a science fiction film that relies more on wits
and psychological terror to drive its climax than visual effects (though
the effects are quite impressively handled).
Ultimately, Sphere ends up running out of gas before the film reaches the
end of its two-hour-plus running time.  After the strong climax, the film
drags on for about another 15 minutes, blunting the impact of all that went
on before with a finale that, while well done technically, is on the
cornball side.  Much like the mysterious object that lends the film its
title, Sphere offers its share of surface delights, but what exactly lies
underneath--if anything at all--is left up to question.

Title
Review for 54 (1998)
If there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film, it was
Studio 54, the late Steve Rubell's infamous New York discotheque, which
came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday:
easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone, all set to a thumping
dance beat.  So when Miramax started production on _54_ last year, the buzz
of hype and resulting anticipation began: an edgy film as down-and-dirty as
the club itself, written and directed by a promising first-timer (Mark
Christopher) and starring some hot young talent (Salma Hayek, Neve
Campbell, newcomer Ryan Phillippe, and Mike Myers in his dramatic debut).
My, how easily does the worm turn.  Hype turned into damage control when
word got out about 11th-hour reshoots (wrapped only a month ago), a rash of
studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew
(especially Christopher) unhappy, and the very likely possibility that
Miramax would not screen the finished film for critics.  At the last
minute, though, Miramax did decide to screen the film (so hastily scheduled
was the screening that Myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation,
not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes) for a media audience
that came away noticeably less than impressed, myself included.  And with
good reason--somehow, some way, the supremely disappointing _54_ has made
the historically hip haven of hedonism... boring.
Although Christopher has distanced himself from the finished film, he
still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness.  _54_
focuses, for the most part, on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club:
coat check girl/aspiring disco diva Anita (a wasted Hayek); her busboy
husband, Greg (Breckin Meyer); and, most prominently, the fresh-from-Jersey
Shane O'Shea (Phillippe), who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head
bartender.  These characters are about as generic as those descriptions.
In focusing on the hired help, Christopher really missed the boat.  With
the exception of the flamboyant, always-woozy Rubell (Myers, in a
well-modulated turn), the meaty stories to be told at Studio 54 are not the
workers' but those of the people who went there to party; not necessarily
the numerous VIP guests, but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked
from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance (among
other things) the night away with the rich, famous, and infamous (the only
taste of the crowd comes by way of Ellen Dow's feisty Dottie, a disco- and
drug-crazed granny, but she's a peripheral character at best).  As such,
aside from the expected overhead crowd shots, there is precious little
actual _dancing_ in _54_.  What is a disco film--especially one about the
pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing?  Even Whit Stillman's
_The_Last_Days_of_Disco_, which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it
was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping
preppies, featured at least one extended dance scene.
Dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex, but that
may not be entirely Christopher's fault.  From what I've heard, his
original vision was something considerably more dark and daring, starting
with the Shane character: he was conceived (and actually filmed) as a wild,
morally ambiguous bisexual, which would have made an efficient springboard
to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of Studio 54's legend.  But
somewhere between principal photography and the final cut, Shane was
defanged and quite literally straightened out; consequently, so was the
film.  Aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning
of the film, Shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite Billie
(Sela Ward), and an abbreviated bedhopping montage, the sexual dimension is
just about ignored.  Shane, in this incarnation, is sanitized to the point
of blandness, an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the
club, Julie Black (Campbell), a worldly soap star with, yes, a heart of
gold.  This tacked-on "romance" would have been slightly less tedious if
either Campbell or Phillippe made some connection with each other or the
audience.  They fail on both counts.
Ultimately, _54_'s failure comes down to three letters: F-U-N.  As in,
there isn't any to be had for the audience.  Too much time is spent with
the boring Shane, and too little is spent on the club floor, where all the
action took place.  Anyhow, though, whatever time is spent on the 54 floor
is not used very effectively.  When Anita finally gets her big break and
perform onstage at the club, it should be a euphoric height, for her, the
crowd, and the audience; however, the moment doesn't get a chance to reach
that level, for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality, which
also mars the film's conclusion (one of the last-minute reshoots).
Strangely upbeat and wistful, the resolution is wholly unconvincing and
unsatisfying.
There is an interesting portrait of Studio 54 out there--two of them, in
fact--but _54_ is not one of them.  They're on cable TV: a couple of
documentaries produced by E! and VH1.  These two fascinating looks at the
club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great
disco movie to be made.  The problem is, after the critical and certain box
office failure of _54_, the subject may have run its Hollywood course.

Title
Review for Dinosaur (2000)
_Dinosaur_ marks another advancement for Walt Disney Pictures' animation
division.  It is the first computer-animated feature from the Mouse to be
produced entirely in-house, as opposed to their hit collaborations with
the Pixar animation studio.  The film also convincingly blends CGI
characters with live action backdrops.  With such innovation on display,
it's unfortunate that the makers of _Dinosaur_ couldn't find a more
interesting story to tell.
_Dinosaur_'s story is typical of Disney's traditionally animated
features, where a young protagonist comes of age.  Here it is the young
iguanodon Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney), who is raised by a loving
family of lemurs after his egg is displaced (in a truly spectacular
wordless opening sequence).  Aladar's pleasant life with foster
caregivers Yar (Ossie Davis) and Plio (Alfre Woodard) is violently
interrupted when a meteorite destroys their island home, and they and
young lemurs Zini (Max Casella) and Suri (Hayden Panettiere) find
themselves with a herd of dinos braving battering heat and a lack of
water to make it to their lush nesting ground.
That's the entire film--the dinosaurs making their long trek to the
nesting ground, with Aladar coming into his own while bonding with
budding love interest Neera (Julianna Margulies) as well as old dinos
Eema (Della Reese) and Baylene (Joan Plowright), and butting heads with
the group's leader Kron (Samuel E. Wright), who sees no fault with
letting the weak in the pack get lost and/or die.  There are some good,
thrilling set pieces, namely those involving the ravenous carnotaurs who
stalk the pack.  But they are just pieces in the larger puzzle that is
Aladar's coming of age, a tale that Disney has told in more entertaining
and emotionally satisfying ways in films past.
However, Disney hasn't told the tale in such a visually striking way. 
The seamless compositing of the CGI creatures with the live action
settings has a lot to do with the nearly photo-real quality of the
computer effects.  The textures, from Aladar's scaly skin to the fur of
the lemurs, are remarkably lifelike and meticulously detailed.  The
creatures also move convincingly like dinosaurs; the dinosaurs' ability
to speak aside, the film feels like an authentic recreation of life
during the cretaceous.
Perhaps that's why that opening sequence, in which Aladar's egg is
removed from its nest and dropped onto the lemur island, is _Dinosaur_'s
big highlight.  Told without a single spoken word, it is so compelling
because it feels so real.  When the speech and the familiar story kick
in, the film feels less so--and, hence, less fresh.  _Dinosaur_ is indeed
a sight to behold--and one well worth paying the full movie ticket price
to see--but it could've been a more nourishing feast for the mind.

Title
Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
_Star_Wars:_Episode_I--The_Phantom_Menace_ (PG) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        There are a couple of angles at which to approach
_Star_Wars:_Episode_I_--The_Phantom_Menace_: in comparison to the three
episodes that have been released; or, ideally, as an individual film, in
and of itself.  In the latter regard, _The_Phantom_Menace_ is the type of
exceptionally well-made, highly imaginative science fiction adventure
that one would expect from the mind of series creator George Lucas, who
makes an impressive return to the director's chair after a self-imposed
22-year hiatus.  It is in the former respect, however, that the film
cannot help but fall short.
The shadow of the first three films released in the series--1977's
_Star_Wars:_A_New_Hope_ (Episode IV), 1980's _The_Empire_Strikes_Back_
(Episode V), and 1983's _Return_of_the_Jedi_ (Episode VI)--looms large
over _The_Phantom_Menace_, and it's not just because those landmark films
have such an enduring legacy.  Rather, it's because Lucas's
_Phantom_Menace_ script is a hodgepodge of different elements from those
three films.  To start, the Gungan, an amphibious race on the planet
Naboo, are scrappy warriors along the lines of _Jedi_'s Ewoks; a pod
racing scene is pretty much _Jedi_'s forest speeder bike chase
transplanted onto the desert; dual light saber-wielding villain Darth
Maul (Ray Park) is a badass scenestealer in the tradition of Boba Fett,
who first appeared in _Empire_.
The installment that _The_Phantom_Menace_ most closely resembles,
however, is _A_New_Hope_.  There's a wise elder Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson), not unlike _A_New_Hope_'s Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Obi-Wan is also
in this episode, in a younger, wilder incarnation (played by Ewan
McGregor) that recalls Luke Skywalker.  Other similarities include a
lavish celebration scene, the destruction of a space vessel, and the
intricate, Princess Leia-to-the-next-level hair design of her future
mother, Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) of Naboo.
Unfortunately, _The_Phantom_Menace_ also falls into the same narrative
rut that _A_New_Hope_ did in its first act, but to a much larger degree. 
After an interesting opening section, from Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan's rousing
slice and dice through squads of battle droids aboard a Trade Federation
spaceship to their rescue of Amidala from evil Federation forces on
Naboo, the story gets bogged down in exposition once our heroes land on
the desert planet of Tatooine.  There, Qui-Gon discovers young Anakin
Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), the future Darth Vader and focal character of
this trilogy of _Star_Wars_ films.  As Qui-Gon and Amidala's handmaiden
Pradmé get to know "Ani" and his mother (Pernilla August), the film slows
to a crawl.  Making the proceedings no less tedious is the strained comic
agony (as opposed to "relief") of Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), a chatty
Gungan who becomes Qui-Gon's sidekick.  Far from lovable, I wanted to
strangle the critter by his second scene.
Things pick up with the aforementioned pod race sequence (which, I must
say, is every bit the thrill ride the _Jedi_ speeder bike chase is), only
to fall into more talky exposition, which only serves to make
_The_Phantom_Menace_'s main story needlessly convoluted and, as such,
largely uninvolving.  Basically the plot boils down to Amidala being
violently strongarmed into a treaty with the evil Trade Federation, which
has been working with the mysterious Darth Sidious (the "Phantom Menace"
of the title), whose main enforcer is the deadly Darth Maul.
        However, this is not to say that the first two-thirds of
_The_Phantom_Menace_ is as dry as a Tatooine summer (or spring... or
fall... or winter).  Far from it--though the story may not keep one
consistently engaged, there are other things that do.  Always capturing
one's attention--and imagination--are the state-of-the-art visual effects
on display.  One of the greatest delights of this and the other
_Star_Wars_ films are the new worlds springing from Lucas's fervid
imagination.  Tatooine is the only familiar pit stop; also on the travel
itinerary are the Coruscant (briefly seen at the end of the _Jedi_
Special Edition), the city-covered planet that serves as the home of the
Galactic Senate; Naboo; and the Gungan's hidden undersea home on Naboo. 
Then, of course, there are the various effects used to populate the
streets of these worlds with exotic alien creatures, as well as those
used to depict the spaceways and the crafts that travel them.  Some CGI
shots are more convincing than others, but they never fail to be the
slightest bit believable or intriguing.
The new troupe of actors holds their own against the largely digital
landscape.  Neeson exudes the right air of authority and solemnity as
Qui-Gon, as does Samuel L. Jackson in a much-publicized cameo as Jedi
Council member Mace Windu.  While Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher did not
settle into their acting stride until _Empire_, Portman and McGregor have
comfortably nailed down their roles in their first outing, though
McGregor's fairly limited screen time is somewhat surprising.  On the
other hand, not so surprising is the fact that Lloyd is the weak link in
the core four.  In all fairness, he does an adequate job as a whole, but
that does not mean that he's immune to the stiff and cloying moments that
often befall child actors; prepare to cringe when Lloyd lets out a forced
"Whoopee!"
The numerous slow patches ultimately just makes one more appreciative of
the pure visceral excitement of the slam-bang third act.  Lucas cuts
loose, following no less than four concurrent battles in which many shots
are fired from pistols and space craft, light sabers are crossed, energy
balls are flung, and more than a little property is destroyed.  The
highlight by far is an exhilarating, series-best light saber duel pitting
both Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan against that dastardly Darth Maul, who more than
lives up to his pre-release hype.
         That mostly all of the action comes at the end will undoubtedly
disappoint die-hard _Star_Wars_ fans and casual moviegoers alike.  But
with so much hype surrounding it (largely generated, in a nice change of
pace, by the fans, _not_ the studio), there was no way
_The_Phantom_Menace_ could live up to the overinflated expectations. 
What it could have possibly lived up to is the _Star_Wars_ legacy, and in
time, it very well may--with _Episode_II_ and _Episode_III_ still yet to
come (in 2002 and 2005, respectively), it's impossible to judge how well
_The_Phantom_Menace_ plays within the context of the entire saga.  At
this point in time, however, _The_Phantom_Menace_, as polished and
entertaining as it is, has nothing in it that quite compares to
_A_New_Hope_'s euphoric sense of wonder and discovery; the exciting
action highs and the despairing emotional lows of _Empire_; or the
emotional catharsis of _Jedi_'s highly resonant climax.  (opens May 19)

Title
Review for Still Crazy (1998)
Every year, at least one studio stages a one-week Academy qualifying
engagement for a film that clearly has no prayer at snagging any
nominations, let alone any awards.  This year's most blatant example is
this British comedy, which is certainly pleasant enough to watch but
completely forgettable.
After the misfire of _The_Juror_, _The_Josephine_Baker_Story_ and
_What's_Love_Got_to_Do_with_It_ director Brian Gibson returns to his
musical roots--with considerably less success--for this formulaic tale
about the reunion of (fictional) '70s rockers Strange Fruit (played by
Stephen Rea, Jimmy Nail, Bill Nighy, and Timothy Spall).  Naturally, the
personality conflicts that led to the band's first breakup, namely that
between Nail's soulful guitarist/backup singer and Nighy's vain lead
singer, endanger the reunion's success and long-term prospects, but, as is
the case of the recent crop of _Full_Monty_-ish feel-good Brit comedies,
everything gets nicely tied up in the end.  There are a few nice turns,
especially by Nail and Juliet Aubrey (as the band's assistant), but most of
the humor provided by scripters Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais is less
funny than plain silly, such as Nighy's stuck-in-the-glam-era stage antics
and a running gag that has Spall constantly evading debt collectors.  In
short, _Still_Crazy_ is simply an average timekiller.  (opens December 11)

Title
Review for Coyote Ugly (2000)
_Coyote_Ugly_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
To give credit where credit is due, the team over at Disney sure knew
how to market _Coyote_Ugly_.  Five women wearing the best "fuck me"
expressions they could get away with on a PG-13 ad pout seductively on
the poster, huddled up very close together as the tagline teases,
"Tonight, they're calling the shots."  The trailer takes the pandering a
step further, showing these women in action at the titular New York
nightspot, where not only do they serve the drinks, they also serve as
the in-house entertainment: dancing atop the counters, groping each
other, lighting fires, and--on really special occasions--spraying each
other with water and splashing about.
With a promotional campaign like that, the studio had no trouble
attracting long lines of recruited seatfillers to sweeten the press
screening audience.  But as tantalizing as the advertising is, it begs
one eensy-weensy question: just what exactly is this film _about_?  As
the film as it wheezed its hackneyed way to its clichéd conclusion, it
became plainly obvious why Disney went out of its way to skirt (yes, pun
intended) the issue: _Coyote_Ugly_ is, quite simply, one of the corniest
movies I have ever seen.
While there are a few high-energy bar scenes (more on those later)
strategically placed to wake dozing audiences along the way,
_Coyote_Ugly_ is actually the story of Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo), a
21-year-old from small-town New Jersey who moves to New York City in
hopes of becoming a songwriter.  But reality comes crashing down hard for
this bumpkin, and soon she finds herself with only a couple of dollars
and a lot of unwanted demo tapes to her name.  Enter Zoe (Tyra Banks),
Cammie (Izabella Miko), and Rachel (Bridget Moynahan), the women of
Coyote Ugly--whom Violet encounters at an all-night diner as they
celebrate the imminent departure of Zoe, who is off to (no joke) law
school.  Some convenient turns of the plot later, Violet (now nicknamed
"Jersey") finds herself behind and on top of the counter at the insanely
popular saloon under the watchful eye of tough-as-nails owner Lil (Maria
Bello, who must now be kicking herself for leaving _ER_)--and the amorous
watch of Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia), a fry cook desperately  smitten
with Violet.
Anyone familiar with the oeuvre of producer Jerry Bruckheimer (as in a
number of his efforts, the director here, music video vet David McNally,
is but a faceless puppet) knows that action is where his interests and
strengths lie, not anything resembling human emotion.  So--all salacious
reasons aside--_Coyote_Ugly_ only exhibits any signs of life during the
slickly staged and edited bar scenes.  These are the only scenes with
real energy and spark, and--not surprisingly--Bruckheimer and McNally
seem the slightest bit interested in what's going on (audiences will
likely share that sentiment).
Unfortunately, it's the "emotion" that drives the script by Gina Wendkos
(rewritten many times over by a number of uncredited scribes, including
Kevin Smith--who, I must stress, is _not_ responsible for the labored
comic book references in the film).  The press notes call the film "a
sexy romantic comedy," which in this case means trotting out all the
usual clichés in Violet and Kevin's romance.  Violet's ambition drives a
wedge between them, as does his lack of it; and there's the trusty
climactic moment where she catches him in a not-what-it-seems moment with
an unknown blonde.  Also intended to add an emotional dimension is
Violet's relationship with her widowed father, toll booth attendant Bill
(John Goodman).  Goodman is funny and warm, but he's at the mercy of a
script riddled with such "dramatic" dialogue such as "This is the first
time I've ever been ashamed of you!" and the powerful "But you're my
daughter!"
Then again, just about everything in _Coyote_Ugly_ is hard to believe,
the most unbelievable being the fact that a worldwide talent search
resulted in the casting of Perabo.  Granted, her character already lacks
credibility as written--Violet believes she's cursed with "stage fright
DNA" (her deceased singer mother had the same problem); the great
"talent" we're supposed to respect and root for is her ability to churn
out assembly line bubblegum pop--but Perabo does nothing to remedy that. 
She smiles; she shakes her groove thing; she crinkles up her face in a
vain attempt to squeeze out some tears.  I don't know what exactly you
call that, but I know it's not called "acting"...
...making her the perfect "star" to anchor _Coyote_Ugly_, which
practically dares the every viewer not to hang his or her head in
disbelief at every turn.  My breaking point finally came around midfilm,
when Violet, on the roof of her apartment building, guitar and keyboard
in tow, struggles to write a folksy ballad.  Suddenly, her concentration
is broken by the hip-hop music booming from an apartment across the
street.  After a pause, she starts singing and has a eureka--her lyrics
fit the beat!  Excited, she runs to her keyboard and starts playing
along.  What talent!  What brilliance!  What complete, utter bullshit!

Title
Review for Three Seasons (1999)
_Three_Seasons_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
For the most part, Tony Bui's gorgeous Sundance favorite is a fascinating
look at life in modern-day Vietnam, seen through the eyes of a number of
characters leading different lives in and around Ho Chi Minh City: a young
woman (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep) who strikes up an unlikely friendship with the
old, ailing owner (Tran Manh Cuong) of the lotus farm at which she works; a
cyclo driver (Don Duong) who falls for a prostitute (Zoe Bui); and a very
young street vendor (Nguyen Huu Duoc) whose case of merchandise is stolen.  
If only Bui and co-writer Timothy Linh Bui had left it at that: three
storylines to match the three seasons of the title.  But in a blatant
concession to the film's Western production roots, also added to the mix is
an unnecessary storyline about a GI (Harvey Keitel) who is searching for
the daughter he left behind.  Although this thread briefly intersects with
the others (as they all do), it could not be more far removed in terms of
style, mood, and execution; while the other stories feel true to life, this
one feels like manufactured melodrama, and it is rather stiffly acted by
Keitel (with the exception of one emotional wordless scene).  Thankfully,
though, his storyline is given the least amount of screen time, never
becoming so obtrusive as to dilute the simple power of the other plots or
the uniting poetry of Lisa Rinzler's breathtaking cinematography.

Title
Review for Hope Floats (1998)
The latest weepy chick flick from actor-director Forest Whitaker
(_Waiting_to_Exhale_) demonstrates all too well the limitations of good
acting.  Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr., Gena Rowlands, and young Mae
Whitman turn in strong performances, but they can't make Steven Rogers's
soggy script float (yeah, bad pun) above the level of made-for-TV movie.
After being dumped by her husband (Michael Pare) on a national TV talk show
(by far the film's most entertaining scene) Birdee Pruitt (a radiant
Bullock) and her daughter Bernice (Whitman) moves back in with her
taxidermist mother (Rowlands) in backwater Smithville, Texas.
>From this point on, everything belongs on the small screen.  Birdee is
aggressively wooed by a nice guy (Connick) who's had a crush on her since
high school, but she and especially Bernice can't overcome the hope that
her hubby will come back to her.  There is also the obligatory
disease-stricken older relative: in this case, Birdee's father, who's been
staying in a rest home since having a stroke and coming down with
Alzheimer's.  I'm not spoiling anything by revealing Birdee eventually
stops feeling sorry for herself and starts living again, but, of course,
not before a number of tears are shed, people lovingly embrace, and the de
rigueur death of a loved one.  Nothing spells dull and saccharine quite
like the two dreaded Hs--hugs and healing.

Title
Review for Desperate Measures (1998)

Desperate Measures (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
        A pair of shadowy figures lurk about a dimly lit building as the opening
credits crawl ever so stealthily along walls, floors, and windows.  Sadly,
this is the pinnacle of creativity for Desperate Measures, a routine,
sometimes laughable thriller whose originality and intelligence is in
inverse proportion to its overwhelming absurdity.
        Not that David Klass's premise is not without some tinge of freshness,
albeit preposterous.  After a frantic search for a bone marrow donor for
his leukemia-stricken son Matthew (Joseph Cross), San Francisco police
detective Frank Conner (Andy Garcia) finds a compatible match in Peter
McCabe (Michael Keaton).  There's just one pesky complication: McCabe is a
brilliant, psychotic killer serving a lengthy prison sentence, and
conducting the transplant means placing escape-prone McCabe in a situation
where he easily can--and, surprise, surprise, he does.
        There's a germ of an interesting, if somewhat comical, idea here--the cop
wants to catch the bad guy, but, unlike the other police, he wants him to
catch him alive.  But Desperate Measures soon settles into an all-too
familiar series of by-the-book standoff set pieces where Conner catches up
to McCabe, McCabe takes someone hostage and gets away, said hostage is
somehow released, Conner catches McCabe again, etc.  And for all the
gunplay, fights, and assorted mayhem director Barbet Schroeder is able to
pack into his briskly paced 100 minutes, nothing about the proceedings is
very suspenseful--just tedious.
        Not helping things at all is the unintentional laughs that are had along
the way.  Quite a few of the guffaws stem from how Conner wants McCabe
alive.  Consider this one stupefying gutbuster: the good guy shoots the bad
guy and in a standard thriller moment; then suddenly we see the two in a
maudlin rushing ambulance scene, with the good guy holding the bad guy's
hand, telling him he's going to make it as treacly music plays in the
background.  Some things are just insulting.  Much is made about how
Matthew only has hours to live, but for someone near death, he's awfully
energetic; the final act has him running around a lot, exhibiting no signs
of weakness or fatigue, and for someone whose blood has trouble clotting, a
nosebleed stops rather quickly and conveniently.  I'd say that the
transplant could wait a few days.  Make that weeks.  Months even.
        What keeps Desperate Measures watchable is the work of Keaton and Garcia.
Garcia makes you sympathize with Conner's plight, and he is able to lend
the weak material some emotional gravity.  Keaton is allowed to be more
colorful here than he was in Jackie Brown, voraciously sinking his jowls
into the psycho role.  If anything is wrong with Keaton's portrayal, it's
the fault of the script, which paints McCabe as nothing more than a garden
variety loon.  Keaton suggests something a bit more quirky and off-center
(that is, if there is something "centered" about psychotic killers), but
none of that gets any deep follow-through, if any at all.
        But any pleasures to be had with Desperate Measures are just about wiped
away by the film's abrupt finale, which bears the unmistakable stench of
test-screening tinkering.  It's a cheap, gimmicky conclusion, which makes
it the perfect capper to this dopey thriller.

Title
Review for 20 Dates (1998)
It's one thing for first-time independent directors to make their feature
debuts with movies about struggling filmmakers, and it's quite another
thing entirely to engage in the singular act of self-indulgence that Myles
Berkowitz pulls off in _20_Dates_.  Instead of making a thinly veiled
fiction film about himself, he has unabashedly made a film about himself.
And, in an added twist, the film he has made traces the making of the film
he has made (got that?).
By that description, _20_Dates_ sounds like an exercise in cinematic
masturbation--and, to a certain extent, it _is_--but it doesn't feel that
way.  That's because Berkowitz has an interesting story to tell.  Bored
with the movies' unrealistic view of love and frustrated with his
nonexistent film career _and_ love life, he came up with a high-concept
idea: make a movie about his own quest for true love.  A camera would
follow him on twenty dates (hence the title), and if he somehow fell in
love during the course of these dates, not only would he have found love,
he would have also captured on film the exact, true moment where people
fall for each other--which, he felt, had never been captured in a Hollywood
film.  But if love never comes, at least he would have his movie.
Because it details real-life events, _20_Dates_ can be considered a
documentary, but it isn't entirely one.  The film is peppered by
Berkowitz's own narration, in which he makes wry comments and observations
on the events in retrospect, and, I suspect, he's also taken certain
dramatic liberties with some situations (most notably, the downward
fortunes of his producer, Elie Samaha).  But 100% true or not, the film is
quite funny and never less than amusing, due mostly to Berkowitz himself.
He is an entertaining, engaging host, with a charmingly self-effacing
attitude about him.
So as one watches _20_Dates_, one hopes that he will find success--in his
career and in love.  Does he?  Fox Searchlight's theatrical release of
_20_Dates_ answers the former question, but as for the latter?  You'll just
have to sit through the film's fun, if ultralightweight, 88 minutes to find
out.

Review for One True Thing (1998)
_One_True_Thing_ (R) *** (out of ****)
Although mine were a couple of the relatively few dry eyes left at the end
of this adaptation of Anna Quindlen's tearjerking novel, I was not left
untouched by this radical departure for director Carl Franklin
(_One_False_Move_, _Devil_in_a_Blue_Dress_).  After his homemaker wife
Kate's (Meryl Streep) cancer takes a turn for the worse, English professor
George Gulden (William Hurt) forces his daughter Ellen (Renee Zellweger) to
leave her job as a big city magazine writer and become, in effect,
nursemaid to her dying mother.  The arc of the story is predictable, but
only to a point; while familiar bases are covered (the never-close Kate and
Ellen learn to bond; Ellen learns the importance of family over work),
Karen Croner's script also has a surprising, and rather involving, mystery
element to it, largely embodied by a framing device where Ellen
interrogated by an investigator (James Eckhouse) for reasons that only
gradually become clear.
But the true thing of _One_True_Thing_ is the acting, which is uniformly
superb.  The usually spacey (as of late) Hurt's uncharacteristically
focused performance is a noteworthy achievement, but his effort is upstaged
by the excellent mother-daughter duo.  Zellweger and especially Streep both
bring their roles to vivid life with a multi-dimensional blend of warmth,
vulnerability, and underlying strength.  While the whole of
_One_True_Thing_ may not be deserving of such kudos, the actresses'
exquisite performances are what Oscars are made for.

Title
Review for Runaway Bride (1999)
_Runaway_Bride_ (PG) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Ever since _Pretty_Woman_ came out of nowhere to become a box office
sensation in 1990--and propelling Julia Roberts's star and salary into
the stratosphere--there has been ongoing rumblings about a possible
sequel.  Thankfully, no such unnecessary revisit with millionaire Edward
Lewis and prostitute Vivian Ward has ever made it to the big screen, but
some nine years after the release of that much-loved romantic comedy
comes something quite close to a sequel: a reunion of stars Roberts and
Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall.  And while _Runaway_Bride_
isn't quite at the magical level of _Pretty_Woman_ (then again, what
is?), this satisfying charmer has all the makings of (pardon the bad pun)
another runaway hit.
Aside from _Pretty_Woman_, _Runaway_Bride_ must also face comparison
with Roberts's early-summer romantic comedy hit, _Notting_Hill_, and
again the newer film falls short; it lacks the running satire of
Tinseltown celebrity that gave that fluffy film an unexpected edge. 
_Runaway_Bride_ is simply just fluff, with a typically preposterous
set-up to match: New York-based _USA Today_ columnist Ike Graham (Gere)
hears about Hale, Maryland resident Maggie Carpenter's (Roberts) penchant
for abandoning bridegrooms at the altar--3 and counting--from a stranger
at a bar and then proceeds to write an unflattering piece on her.  His
inaccuracy-filled article prompts a complaint letter from Maggie, costing
Ike his job.  Seeing a "corrected" piece on Maggie as a way to jumpstart
a freelance career--and anxious to see her dump Groom Number 4, whom she
is set to wed in a week's time--Ike goes down to Hale to investigate.
Once the knotty exposition is out of the way, it is Marshall and
scripters Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott's job to step back and let
the Roberts-Gere sparks take over, and the well-matched stars pick up
where they left off on that Hollywood fire escape nine years ago; they
sizzle together, and it is impossible not to have a rooting interest in
their characters' eventual coupledom.  Equally as well-matched are each
star and their respective role.  Maggie is a flighty kook not unlike
_Pretty_Woman_''s Vivian, except (to crib a line from _She's_All_That_)
"for the whole hooker thing," and accordingly, Roberts is very convincing
in Maggie's skin.  On the other hand, Ike is a polar opposite to
_Pretty_Woman_'s uptight Edward, but Gere obviously has fun--and _is_
quite fun--as a charming, if troublemaking, scamp.
Of course, Marshall and the writers cannot completely disappear, and
they bring a number of entertaining comic situations--including a couple
of blatant, but not distracting, mirror scenes to _Pretty_Woman_--and
witty dialogue to the affair.  They also surround Roberts and Gere with a
colorful supporting cast; the standouts are the always-effective Joan
Cusack as Maggie's best friend and Christopher Meloni, a hoot as Maggie's
athletic-minded fiancé.  In addition to Roberts, Gere, and Marshall,
Hector Elizondo is also on hand for the reunion, but his involvement in
the story is limited at best as Ike's photographer friend.  Especially
disappointing is Elizondo's lack of onscreen interaction with Roberts,
with whom he worked so memorably in the last collaboration.
_Runaway_Bride_ is sure to be knocked as ridiculous hokum, which, much
like _Pretty_Woman_, it certainly is.  And like that previous film, it
gives the audience what it wants to see: an irresistible confection that
serves up the laughs and a sweet, involving romance, with the proven
Roberts-Gere electricity as the not-so-secret ingredient that gives the
film its special kick.

Title
Review for Celebrity (1998)
This fall's entry into the Woody Allen filmography is this scattershot
episodic black-and-white comedy, more or less following the opposing life
trajectories of a divorced New York couple: downwardly mobile philandering
celebrity journalist/aspiring screenwriter Lee Simon (Kenneth Branagh) and
his fast-rising ex, Robin (Judy Davis).  In theory, the point of the entire
film is to provide insight into the nature of fame and fortune, mostly
through Lee's encounters with luminaries such as a supermodel (Charlize
Theron), a ditzy starlet (Melanie Griffith), and a wild young movie
heartthrob (Leonardo DiCaprio).
However, I didn't see or hear anything particularly insightful except for
the line of dialogue, "You can learn a lot about a society by who it
chooses to celebrate."  And what exactly do we learn about _our_ society
from _Celebrity_?  That it is one where just about every celebrity is
willing to appear in a Woody Allen film--hence another star-studded
ensemble, which also includes Joe Mantegna, Famke Janssen, Bebe Neuwirth,
and Winona Ryder, who displays nice chemistry with Branagh (whose dead-on
Allen impression _didn't_ annoy me).  Without any clear ideas or a strong
story, _Celebrity_ ends up as a showcase of fine character work by stars--a
celebration of celebrity that I don't think Allen intended.

Title
Review for America's Sweethearts (2001)
_America's_Sweethearts_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
        Two types of comedies struggle for control in _America's_Sweethearts_:
one, a catty satire of the Hollywood hype machine; the other, a frothy star
vehicle for America's apparent real-life sweetheart, Julia Roberts.  Coming out
the loser in the ensuing mess is Joe Roth, who shows that spending the last ten
or so years heading movie studios hasn't done any favors for whatever
directorial ability he may have once had.
        From the looks of it, _America's_Sweethearts_ started out as an edgier
ensemble picture, and shades of that appear in the film's more effective
portion, the first half.  The sweethearts of the title are beloved off- and
on-screen pair Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (John
Cusack), who fell in love on the set and then proceeded to make a string of
popular co-starring vehicles after getting married.  Alas, the fairy tale came
to an ugly end after Gwen fell in love with another co-star (Hank Azaria) on the
set of their latest movie, the sci-fi romance _Time_Over_Time_, which is now
being readied for release.  It's up to seasoned publicist Lee Phillips (Billy
Crystal) to make sure the two put on their best faces--and not kill each
other--during the multi-day, hotel-set publicity ritual known as the press
junket.
        The basic premise of _America's_Sweethearts_ paints the film as being
almost too 
inside.  After all, the story of a press junket being in danger is one that
could only be understood, much less appreciated, by journalists and others with
a keen knowledge of the workings of Tinseltown's PR process.  That said, some
effective zingers (by Crystal and Peter Tolan) directed at big studio glitz
provide some amusement for less showbiz-savvy audiences, as do some inspired
performances by Stanley Tucci, who plays a nervous studio chief; Christopher
Walken, who plays the eccentric, reclusive director of _Time_Over_Time_; and
Zeta-Jones, who obviously has a ball playing the stereotypical self-absorbed
screen diva.
        But somewhere along the line Julia Roberts decided to get involved in
the picture--not as the ostensible female lead, Gwen, but in the more secondary
role of Gwen's put-upon sister/personal assistant Kiki.  Roth then beefed up the
Kiki role in fair proportion to the "JULIA!" stature as any self-respecting
studio head/businessman would.  However, this turns out to be a ruinous
miscalculation not only in terms of storytelling but  in simple casting.  Kiki
is supposed to be frumpy and a bit of a loser, and regardless of whether or not
you think Roberts is the "pretty woman" she's celebrated as being, her charisma
and natural star wattage is undeniable and just about impossible to quash.  Not
even a fat suit, which she wears in some flashback scenes, is able to obscure
the fact that it's "JULIA!".  So when Kiki and Eddie start to develop feelings
for each other (which isn't giving away a thing that isn't already revealed in
the trailers or that could be easily predicted), what should have been a mere
plot complication becomes the focus, and suddenly "America's Sweethearts"
transforms into a "JULIA!" star vehicle about how she gets the guy--and an
especially weak one at that, given the glacial non-chemistry between her and
Cusack.
        Not that _America's_Sweethearts_ is too successful in general comedic
terms.  Apparently having little faith in the sometimes-spicy ideas and dialogue
as well as the talented actors delivering them, Roth throws in the broadest
lowest-common-denominator slapstick gags whenever he can.  A feisty, ferocious
dog takes an unnatural liking to Lee's crotch.  While jogging through a golf
course, Lee's underling Danny (Seth Green) gets hit in the head with a ball. 
And the point is...?  Certainly not laughs, for those goofy goings-on land with
a thud.
        Then again, the whole of _America's_Sweethearts_ doesn't seem to have a
point, either, given its split personality.  Roth would have been wiser to
choose between making a movie publicity send-up or a "JULIA!" showcase, for in
trying to achieve the best of both worlds, he ended up shortchanging the
audiences for either.

Title
Review for Music of the Heart (1999)
After making her name in fluff (for better or worse) for years,
Elisabeth Shue broke through with the "career-changing revelation" (as
_Vogue_ put it) of her Oscar-nominated performance in 1995's
_Leaving_Las_Vegas_.  While her career might have changed for the better,
Shue's performances changed for the worse, embarrassing herself in the
likes of _The_Saint_ and _Palmetto_.  John Duigan's _Molly_, with the
Oscar-baiting arc of its title character, is obviously designed to show
off more of Shue's acting chops.  Instead, it just shows that
_Leaving_Las_Vegas_ may have been a fluke.
As Molly McKay, Shue is called on to cover a wide acting spectrum.  For
half of the film, Shue has to act as if she had the mind of a child, for
Molly is mentally challenged; for the other, after Molly receives miracle
surgical treatment that awakens her mental capacities, Shue has to be an
innocent yet observant and energetic naif.  She fails miserably on both
counts.  She yelps, grunts, mumbles, jumps, screeches, and mugs to no end
as Molly#1; as Molly#2, she's just as jumpy but with eyes perpetually
wide and a chirpy, singsong voice.  Neither portrayal resembles any
actual, non-acted human behavior, whether the person is mentally
challenged or not.
Shue's performance is just one of this unconvincing, uninvolving film. 
Dick Christie's script is a hodgepodge of elements from _Awakenings_ and
_Rain_Man_, an analogy that actually makes the film seem better than it
is.  If you've seen either of those films, you will know every turn of
the plot, right down to the ending, well before they come.  But aside
from not coming up with anything slightly original in the main story,
Christie doesn't come up with a single satisfactory subplot.  A romance
between Molly's well-meaning but selfish brother Buck (Aaron Eckhart,
doing a nice job--the only person who does so--in a change of pace,
non-sleazy role) and Molly's doctor (Jill Hennessy) is spoken of but
never shown.  Come to think of it, that's the only attempt at a subplot
Christie and Duigan make.
In their defense, though, _Molly_ has been trimmed down to a remarkably
slim 89 minutes from the 100something-minute run time of its original
cut, which played on airlines this summer before its fall theatrical
release.  Even so, the fact that there are only 89 of them doesn't make
any of those minutes any less tedious, and 89 minutes of Shue's strained
Acting display is 89 more than anyone should ever have to endure.
By contrast, _Music_of_the_Heart_ marks the annual Oscar nod bid for the
oft-nominated Meryl Streep, and once again it looks like she'll make it
into the Academy's top five.  In this fact-based drama directed by, of
all people, horror king Wes Craven, Streep delivers another strong
performance as Roberta Guaspari, who, after a messy divorce, finds new
meaning in life by teaching the violin to elementary school kids in the
inner city neighborhood in East Harlem.  Ten years later, having inspired
many creative young minds and won the respect of ther peers in the
intervening decade, Roberta's program is threatened by cuts in education
funding.
I would not call Streep's work here her best in recent years; it doesn't
nearly hold a candle to her elegantly wrenching turn in 1995's
_The_Bridges_of_Madison_County_.  But _Music_of_the_Heart_ is unthinkable
without her (imagine what a howler the film would have been if original
star Madonna had not backed out); it's her passionate performance that
carries the audience through the rough patches in Pamela Gray's script. 
For example, scenes involving Roberta's attempt at a new romantic life
don't pay off in the end, and some dialogue reeks of a writer's hand;
when Roberta breaks up with her boyfriend (Aidan Quinn) at the same time
she fires her home construction crew, she says to each individual crew
member, "You're fired," then turns to Quinn and says, "You're fired,
too."
And then there are the maudlin fixtures of films such as these: the
bright student whose mother decides to pull him out of the class; the son
who feels neglected by all the attention Roberta lavishes upon his
students.  Yet the film works; there's no denying the uplift of
Guaspari's remarkable true story, and even though he doesn't completely
avoid the trap of sugary sappiness, Craven sends the audience out feeling
happy and inspired--which is the very reason why one would buy a ticket
into _Music_of_the_Heart_.

Title
Review for Magnolia (1999)
A faceless narrator ruminates on the nature of chance and fate by
telling of three different inexplicable occurrences through time.  The
most interesting anecdote is one where a young man's attempt at a
suicidal fall is botched mid-plunge--when he ends up the victim of a
murder to which he was an accessory.  The convoluted mechanics of this
strange--make that _freak_--occurrence are analyzed in exhaustive detail,
complete with a visual breakdown by telestrator.  It's not exactly the
most obvious way to open any film about the anguished lives of a
cross-section of people in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, but in terms
of Paul Thomas Anderson's _Magnolia_, it is the perfect curtain- and
eyebrow-raiser for three hours of the director's astonishingly powerful
and audacious vision.
Anderson follows that bold prologue with an introductory sequence that
can only be described as being cinematically alive.  As a TV blares the
ridiculously macho propaganda of male self-help guru Frank T.J. Mackey
(Tom Cruise), one by one we're introduced to the characters, storylines,
and relationships that intertwine over one eventful 24-hour period
detailed in the film.  Cancer-stricken television producer Earl Partridge
(Jason Robards) is on his deathbed, being tended to by his nurse, Phil
Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman), as his much younger trophy wife, Linda
(Julianne Moore) searches in vain for a way to cope.  Elsewhere in the
Valley is another terminal cancer victim, Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker
Hall), who hasn't yet let his estranged, drug-addicted daughter Claudia
(Melora Walters) know about his condition.  In the meantime, he continues
his long-running hosting duties on the popular kids-versus-adults quiz
show _What_Do_Kids_Know?_, whose current champion is child genius Stanley
Spector (Jeremy Blackman).  Serving as a counterpoint to Stanley's
progression is the downward slide of Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), a
former champion of the same show back in the '60s.  Patrolling the Valley
streets while talking to an invisible partner is Officer Jim Kurring
(John C. Reilly).  
This highly kinetic sequence, fueled by energized editing and camera
work, is ultimately held together by the song that plays in the
background, a tune that succinctly sums up the main feeling of the
characters and the film itself: Aimee Mann's cover of "One"--as in, "one
is the loneliest number."  Isolation is the primary theme of _Magnolia_,
and the overwhelming pain that comes with the state its primary mood; as
the characters each seek out connection and comfort, Anderson masterfully
uses music to express that which is neither seen nor spoken.  For a
non-musical film, _Magnolia_ is highly dependent on the music; there is
nary a moment where either a song (usually by Mann, contributed seven to
the film) or Jon Brion's instrumental score is playing in the background.
 Sometimes Anderson even has score and songs playing concurrently, and a
number of times the music takes the foreground and the dialogue recedes
into the background (most notably in the film's final scenes); both are
bold moves, and they prove to be highly effective in showing the urgency
of emotion that burns beneath the surface.
But no example of Anderson's use of music is as ingenius as in one
bound-to-be-discussed scene that occurs about two-thirds into the film. 
As all the characters appear to be at their lowest, most uncertain point,
the action completely stops and each person, regardless of where they
are, sings along to Mann's somber "Wise Up."  The tune is not playing on
anyone's stereo as source music; it simply plays on the film's
soundtrack, and everyone relates their pain through the song, whose
chorus goes, "It's not going to stop 'til you wise up."  The idea sounds
ridiculous and almost overly cutesy on paper, but the scene sends chills
while watching it unfold onscreen.  When the signature line is sung for
the final time, with the altered lyric "It's not going to stop, so just
_give_up_"--it packs a stunning wallop.
Of course, such an experimental, for lack of a better term, "stunt"
would not work if the audience does not care for any of the characters. 
While _Magnolia_ runs three hours, Anderson still has only so much screen
time to divide between its large canvas of players, and it's a testimony
to his writing and directing skill and the ability of the actors that
everyone comes across as a fully-realized human being.  The cast is
absolutely flawless, with Cruise undoubtedly set to get the lion's share
of attention for his showy, likely-to-be-Oscar-nominated work.  The
recognition would be well-deserved, but I found myself even more
impressed with others in the ensemble.  Moore is particularly strong,
gradually revealing the tenderness that lies beneath her character's
shrewish bitterness; the moment where Linda is finally able to be honest
about her feelings to another and to herself is shattering.  Walters and
Reilly are called on to navigate the film's central romantic thread, and
their oddball characters' pairing is  at once comically eccentric and
genuinely endearing.  Then there's the bound-to-be-unsung hero by the
name of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  The role of loyal and nice nurse Phil is
far from the film's flashiest (not surprisingly, that distinction goes to
Cruise's), but it's one of those critical parts that, if done completely
wrong, could short-circuit the entire film.  That Hoffman's work is
likely to go unrecognized says everything about the quality of his
performance.
The idea of the inexplicable--and Anderson's courageously go-for-broke
creative approach--comes to a head during the film's climax, when
something indeed beyond reason takes place, serving as a unifying force
between all the characters and plotlines.  I will not give it away, but
the development not quite as out-of-left-field as some people suggest; it
is, in fact, very subtly foreshadowed throughout the course of the movie.
 Nonetheless, it _is_ quite a jarring turn, but by that point I was
willing to go anywhere the boundlessly imaginative Anderson was leading. 
That's the sign of a true film artist at work, and the proof is the
moving, magnificent masterwork that is _Magnolia_.

Title
Review for Where the Money Is (2000)
_Where_the_Money_Is_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Well into his 70s, Paul Newman still has a vim and vigor that burns
incandescently on the silver screen.  But as he ages gracefully, the
projects he chooses to make are less so.  Latest case in point:
_Where_the_Money_Is_, a mechanical caper comedy that is more of a tedious
watch than the breezy lark it aims to be.
Newman is well matched with co-star Linda Fiorentino, who plays Carol,
who unhappily works at the nursing home Newman's Henry is staying at. 
Henry, a convicted thief, is transferred to the home after suffering a
stroke--or, rather, faking one, a fact that only Carol is quick to pick
up on.  Instead of turning Henry in and thwarting his escape plans, Carol
decides to make a deal with him: she will help him make a getaway if he
will help her with one big heist.  Henry agrees take part in Carol's big
plan, as does her husband Wayne (Dermot Mulroney, in a thankless role),
who has reservations about the whole scheme.
The meat of _Money_ is simple enough, but it takes forever to cut to it.
 The film runs a compact 89 minutes, but about 60 of those minutes are
buildup filler featuring a mass of misfired jokes.  Some racy gags
involving Carol's use of her sexuality to awaken Henry from his "stroke"
are overdone, and the dialogue the two eventually exchange is not as
witty as it would like to be.  Only Newman's magnetism, Fiorentino's
sultry spunk, and the undeniable chemistry between them keeps this
section watchable.
Theoretically, when time comes for Henry, Carol, and Wayne to stage
their heist, _Where_the_Money_Is_ should really kick into gear.  While
this section is certainly more interesting than anything that preceded
it, there's nothing terribly exciting about it.  In fact, the scheme
itself is fairly by-the-numbers, without any imaginatively quirky twists
that one would expect from such a light comedy.  Director Marek Kanievska
plays the big robbery straight in every possible way, meaning not just
taking it fairly seriously but also adding nothing beyond what's on the
page, such as suspense or tension.
Maybe Newman's relaxation in front of the camera was just so infectious
that everyone behind the camera on _Where_the_Money_Is_ felt the urge to
work in a lower gear.  But they mistook his effortless ease for laziness,
for while one sees the fire behind Newman's cool, one can see nothing
behind this film's glacial slickness.

Title
Review for Trigger Effect, The (1996)
The title of screenwriter David Koepp's directorial debut, The
Trigger Effect, is meant to reflect how one event--in this case, a
blackout--can trigger a chain of (largely unfavorable) events.  The title
actually better describes the execution of the film than its basic plot--one
bad idea sets off a series of more bad ideas until the film becomes
unsalvageable.
Writer-director Koepp establishes the scene rather well, setting up
a promising psychodrama: the young married couple of Matt (Kyle MacLachlan)
and Annie (Elisabeth Shue) find their life thrown off balance when a massive
power outage paralyzes the city and Matt's best friend Joey (Dermot
Mulroney) comes to stay in their home.  Matt is a somewhat stuffy elitist
who can reveal a more savage side when push comes to shove; Annie is a new
mother with a checkered past as a "wild child"; and Joey is the slightly
boorish, macho type. Having these three mercurial personalities stuck in a
claustrophobic setting and reverting to more primal instincts is fertile
fodder for a psychological thriller.
But all the promise is wiped away when the three (four including
Matt and Annie's daughter) decide to leave town and make a long, hard
journey through the desert and country to Annie's parents' house.
Interesting plot strands (such as Joey's slight awakening of Annie's wild
side) established in the house are abandoned for the conventional trappings
of a road picture.  And the characters start to act like only those in a
movie would act in order to further the plot--for example, they decide to
make an unnecessary stop for fuel, which lands them right next to the car of
a mysterious stranger (Michael Rooker) who, of course, causes trouble.  One
bad, credibility-straining plot turn lead to another until the weak, cliched
conclusion, one of those "things are back to normal but never will be the
same again" endings.
It's ironic that the directorial debut of celebrated screenwriter
Koepp (Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible) would fall short in the writing
department but show some life on the directorial end.  While he cannot
generate enough suspense and forward momentum to carry the movie through
from beginning to end, he is able to create some suspenseful moments, such
as scenes involving a prowler and a pharmacy break-in.  Visually, Koepp
tends to overdo blue (witness the fades to blue and more blue lighting than
your average X-Files episode), but he at least makes the whole package
visually interesting, and he coaxes decent performances from the stars, who
have to overcome some rather shallow characterizations.
Ultimately, The Trigger Effect will become a victim of its own
title--once word of mouth spreads on this unthrilling thriller, its minimal
box office power will be shut off.

Title
Review for Glitter (2001)
_Glitter_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
        Now that _Glitter_, her feature starring debut, has finally arrived in
theatres, the reason for pop/R&B diva Mariah Carey's much-publicized breakdowns
(at last count: two) is abundantly clear: the film itself.  While the local
press screening for "Glitter" played to only a half-capacity crowd, this
downsized audience's peals of laughter were loud enough to fill every corner the
auditorium--not exactly the hoped-for reaction to an inspirational tearjerker,
which is what _Glitter_ so disastrously, laughably strives to be.
        _Glitter_ doesn't waste any time exploiting Carey's most frequently
showcased assets--and no, I'm not talking about her Grammy-winning pipes.  After
a brief intro that shows how single (and singing) mother Lillian Frank (Valarie
Pettiford) was forced to give up daughter Billie at an early age, Carey's adult
Billie is first seen all decked out in fishnet stockings and black lingerie with
leopard print trim, shaking her groove thing as a not-quite-exotic dancer at an
NYC club, circa 1983.  After she and her friends/roommates/dance partners (Da
Brat and Tia Texada) are soon offered a gig as back-up singers to a shockingly
untalented dance artist, Billie's soaring voice draws the attention of DJ Julian
"Dice" Black (British actor Max Beesley, called on to bark his lines in a bad
New Yawk accent and flash as much flesh as Carey), who offers her his services
as producer.  Not long after Billie and her friends start making the club rounds
as a Mary Jane Girls-ish trio of trilling trollops, Billie and Dice are offering
each other more than just their musical abilities, and Billie's rapid ascent in
showbiz is offset by the increasing turbulence in her relationship with Dice.
        Carey has stressed that her _Glitter_ role of Billie Frank is far from
autobiographical, but the similarities to her true story are staggering. 
Billie, who is biracial (a fact that the film makes a point of emphasizing), has
a big voice to match her big dreams, but she starts off distinctly small-time as
a back-up singer for another pop act.  Her talents are discovered by someone
established in the music business, and they become romantically involved.  The
pair's relationship turns stormy when he expresses the svengali-like (or should
I say "Mottola-like"?) desire to steer both her career and her life, including
controlling her mode of dress.  And so on. 
        But the blatant parallels to Carey's own story are the only aspects to
_Glitter_ that bear any resemblance to real life.  The film may be a wish
fulfillment fantasy aimed at teen and pre-teen girls, but director Vondie Curtis
Hall (who previously directed the very entertaining--in the right
way--_Gridlock'd_) and screenwriter Kate Lanier's similarly naive depiction of
the music business is laughable.  Billie gets a record deal literally overnight
and without ever signing on a single dotted line.  Billie becomes a major star
without a single significant concert date nor television appearance, and MTV was
two years old at the time the film is set and already an influential force. 
Come to think of it, there's no reason why this film is set in the
1980s--everyone looks like they could be from the '90s or 2001, for that
matter--except to give Carey a chance to cover and/or sample the R&B hits of the
era (most prominently, Cherrelle's "I Didn't Mean to Turn You On"), which, in
the film's storyline, are original hits by Billie--hence giving Miss Mariah a
history-rewriting ego boost.
        Then again, the film is designed as one huge ego boost for its star. 
Instead, however, it comes off as one huge embarrassment, and much of the blame
goes to Miss Mariah herself.  She spends the whole film in a state of vacant,
wide-eyed, smiley catatonia--that is, whenever she's not passing off a
constipated look as one of "sadness" or lipsynching to her own prerecorded vocal
tracks (and quite horribly at that; one would think that a decade's worth of
music video experience would've given her that one ace-in-the-hole).  As in all
of her recent videos, Carey also shows a lot of skin (though this being a
PG-13-rated film, she still leaves some threads on), but her ample cleavage--and
the inexplicable streak of silver paint that shows up on various areas of her
body--can't distract from her awful attempts at acting, not to mention the
already laughable situations in which she finds herself.  In fact, one of the
most hilarious scenes is one of gratuitous body baring: Billie films her first
music video wearing a translucent wrap over a silver string bikini, but the wind
machine is too strong, and--whoops!--there goes the wrap!
        Yet that is just one of the many unintentional moments of high comedy in
the howlerfest that is _Glitter_.  Just when you think it could not get more
ridiculous, Hall, Lanier, and Miss Mariah go that extra mile.  A scene where
Billie, all decked out in a sequined gown and spike heels, struggles to
walk--make that "wobble"--across a lawn and one where a split-up Billie and Dice
engage in seemingly telepathic songwriting (if only I were kidding) are instant
entries into the Bad Movie Hall of Fame.  But even more jaw-dropping is the
one-two punch finale that is a pathetically desperate bid to make viewers cry. 
If anyone does shed any tears at _Glitter_, it's undoubtedly from busting a gut
laughing.

Review for Fantasia/2000 (1999)
_Fantasia/2000_ (G) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
        Stunning.  Breathtaking.  Spectacular.  These are but three
adjectives that will certainly be used to describe _Fantasia/2000_,
Disney's long-in-the-works update of its 1940
classical-music-set-to-animation "work-in-progress," _Fantasia_.
However, one word you won't hear in association with _F/2K_--unlike
the original--is "classic."
        Don't get me wrong--there are a number of stunning bits of new
animation that will stand the test of time, particularly in the film's
first three segments.  Taking a cue from the original, which began
with an abstract rendering of an abstract musical piece, _F/2K_ opens
with an extremely trippy interpretation of Beethoven's "Symphony
No. 5, " directed by Pixote Hunt.  A relentlessly kinetic sequence
with triangles up, down, around, and every which way multiplying with
every "da da da daah," the segment is made even more dizzying by the
IMAX giant screen format (one can only imagine how much more so it
would have been had the film been in IMAX 3D).
        Things are decidedly less hyper in the next segment, but the
product is even more breathtaking.  To accompany Ottorino Respighi's
"Pines of Rome," director Hendel Butoy has come up with a spectacular
vision of whales whose aquatic acrobatics take them to the sky in the
wake of a cosmic explosion.  The concept could not be farther from a
piece of music titled for trees in an Italian city, but this is
_F/2K_'s most seamless and inspired melding of music and imagery.  The
gorgeous, inspiring melodies and the amazing three-dimensional
computer animation make for an experience that can only described as
awesome.
        The in-your-face visuals of the first two segments make way
for the simplistic, two-dimensional Al Hirschfeld-inspired line
drawing style of Eric Goldberg's take on "Rhapsody in Blue," composed
by George Gershwin.  While it features the least flashy art and
animation of the new segments, "Rhapsody"--which follows a
cross-section of sad Manhattanites in the 1930s--is perhaps the most
aesthetically ambitious of them, staying strictly within its very
specific art style and employing a limited palette of primarily
blue-based tones.  The heavily stylized approach makes for the segment
with the most personality, and one of the highlights of the film.
        Unfortunately, that's the last big triumph in _Fantasia/2000_,
for the work is more uneven from there.  The film hits rock bottom
with the next segment, an adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen
short story "The Steadfast Tin Soldier," set to Dmitri Shostakovich's
"Piano Concerto #2, Allegro, Opus 102."  The segment is about as
exciting as that title.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with this
story of a tin soldier who battles with an evil jack-in-the-box over
the affections of a music box ballerina; the animation is clean,
especially the 3-D CGI used for the main trio of characters.  It's
just that among a group of shorts that bear at least one distinctive
feature, this one comes up emptyhanded.  I guess director Hendel Butoy
exhausted all of his ideas on the whale segment.
        Holding slightly more interest is another segment by Eric
Goldberg, "Carnival of the Animals (Le Carnival des Animaux), Finale,"
which uses Camille Saint-Saëns' familiar tune as a musical backdrop
for a vignette involving a flock of flamingos and a yo-yo.  The only
flat-out comic piece of the _F/2K_ puzzle, it is a vibrantly colored
(the brightest of the whole set) and fast-paced amusement.  The
problem is, it's so short and weightless--in style and subject--that
it evaporates from the memory about as quickly as it zips by on the
screen.
        After a glorious reappearance of the only returning segment
from the 1940 _Fantasia_, the Mickey Mouse-starring favorite "The
Sorcerer's Apprentice," comes a sequence starring another classic
Disney character, Donald Duck.  This segment, set to Sir Edward
Elgar's familiar "Pomp and Circumstance" and casting Donald as an
assistant to Noah before and during the flood, is not without its
cutesy charm.  But it's a mess; the Biblical theme, Donald, and a
romantic subplot where he and Daisy Duck keep on missing each other
are mixed uneasily by director Francis Glebas.
 The disjointed result doesn't quite feel of a piece with the others,
and, unlike "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," it feels less like an expression
of the music than an excuse to shoehorn in a popular character.
        A similar sense of blatant pandering to the masses hovers over
interstitial segments, where celebrities introduce each sequence.
Only lightly amusing at best (Steve Martin and Bette Midler, who have
been funnier) and excruciating (Penn and Teller) at worst, these bits
are the big reason why _F/2K_'s long-term shelf life won't come close
to that of the original film: they date the film as being a project of
the here and now--and not because these are celebrities of
contemporary times, but that it highlights the commercialist mentality
of the era (not to mention that of Disney, perhaps the biggest
perpetrator of all).  The interstitials are obviously a device to make
more mainstream-palatable what is essentially an animated art film for
an especially rarefied crowd.  While a bit on the stuffy side, Deems
Taylor, the host of the 1940 _Fantasia_, was a much more suitable
host.  His earnest demeanor not only lent a certain timeless quality,
he made it that much easier to take the film seriously as a serious
concert film, not a cartoon show for the kiddies.  With all the jokey
celeb cameos, the latter is more the case with _F/2K_.
        Thankfully, _Fantasia/2000_ ends on a note more befitting of
the former, with an ambitious segment set to Igor Stravinsky's
"Firebird Suite - 1919 Version."  It is a beautifully animated tale of
death and rebirth, with a forest's natural splendor ravaged by a
volcano and then replenished by a magical sprite.  Directors Gaëtan
and Paul Brizzi's work is lovely, blending state-of-the-art computer
techniques with the organic hand-drawn style of Japanese animé.
While I do admire this segment, I am far less enthusiastic about it
than the opening three; perhaps I would have enjoyed the segment even
more if it Hayao Miyazaki's _Princess_Mononoke_ weren't so fresh in
the memory, for this segment's storyline bears more than a passing
resemblance to the finale of that film.
        While I did have a few problems with _Fantasia/2000_, overall
it is a worthy extension of the idea conceived by Walt Disney nearly
60 years ago; and, after _Tarzan_, it's another important step forward
into riskier, more ambitious artistic territory for the Mouse's
animation house.  In some points of execution, there is fault; but in
terms of grand spectacle, it's as close to perfect as anything out
there now--which makes it all the more important that it is seen in
its intended IMAX form, not on a regular multiplex screen, where
_F/2K_ will play after a four-month exclusive run on IMAX.

Title
Review for Score, The (2001)
        Frank Oz, well-known for directing comedies such as most recent film,
_Bowfinger_; and even better known as the man pulling the strings behind Yoda
and Miss Piggy, is perhaps the last person one would expect to breathe some
renewed life into the classic heist picture.  Yet that's exactly what he and a
superb cast do in the sleek entertainment that is _The_Score_.
        "Renew" seems to have been the key idea behind _The_Score_, particularly
in its story.  The basic plot is something that has been seen many times before.
 Montreal-based career thief Nick (Robert DeNiro) wants out of the criminal life
to settle down with his flight attendant girlfriend Diane (Angela Bassett). 
First, though, Nick agrees to one last heist at the urging of longtime associate
Max (Marlon Brando)--the theft of a priceless French scepter held in a customs
house.  Two wild cards are put into play: one, said customs house is in
Montreal, thus violating Nick's rule of not doing local jobs; and two, he must
work with a young upstart named Jack (Edward Norton), who has already studied
the inner workings of the building under the guise of a mentally challenged
janitor.
        Instead of trying to add new wrinkles to the time-worn recipe, Oz strips
the genre down to its bare core.  The plot is as simple as it sounds, and the
twists in the story occur according to readily apparent schedule.  Oz doesn't
stop there, however.  The film's R rating comes exclusively through language,
for he doesn't allow himself the easy out of titillating or distracting the
audience with gratuitous violence or sex.  Hence it's that much more dependent
on the cast to engage the viewer, and everyone lives up to their stellar
reputations.  A noticeably galvanized Brando appears to have a ball sharing
scenes with DeNiro (perhaps because, if the stories are to be believed, that
DeNiro himself directed them, not Oz, with whom Brando clashed), and the
electricity emanates from the screen.  Norton not so surprisingly keeps up with
his elders with extraordinary ease.  His live wire performance plays well
against DeNiro's cool calm, making for an intriguingly volatile chemistry.  Of
the core cast, Bassett fares the least well--if only because her role is never
more than the token love interest.
        The no-frills mindset Oz brings to _The_Score_ puts the most pressure on
himself when it comes time for the heist to take place.  The pattern of
obstacles thrown in Nick and Jack's way are obviously as meticulously calculated
as the heist plans the pair map out, but Oz is able to keep the tension taut by
sticking to the minimalist approach.  There aren't any overwrought score cues or
out-of-nowhere physical confrontations to artificially manufacture suspense; Oz
is wise enough to know that a simple gesture such as having a stray leg briefly
creep into the picture of a security monitor is enough to generate the real
deal.
        Touches like those and the film's attention to pure performance, both in
front of and behind the camera, give _The_Score_ a distinctly old-fashioned
feel--and in a season of CG effects _and_ thespians, such embracing of the
basics is not only refreshing but feels downright innovative.

Review for Disturbing Behavior (1998)
Disturbing Behavior (R) no stars (out of ****)
To borrow one of David Spade's quips on his old "Hollywood Minute" segment
on _Saturday_Night_Live_, I liked this movie better the first time I saw
it... when it was called _The_Stepford_Wives_.  In
_The_Cradle_Bay_Teens_--er, _Disturbing_Behavior_, a seemingly idyllic
Washington town hides a dark secret: in an effort to make their teens reach
their maximum potential, parents and a unscrupulous high school counselor
(Bruce Greenwood, a long way from Atom Egoyan's films) conspire in a
strange program that turns rebellious adolescents into robotic
do-gooders--"Blue Ribbons," as they are called.
There isn't an original moment in Scott Rosenberg's derivative screenplay.
 When the _Stepford_ allusions tap out, he turns to _A_Clockwork_Orange_
for a climactic "conversion" sequence.  It is also incredibly predictable;
plot turns are telegraphed with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  He
even botches the de regueur "twist" ending, which is neither surprising nor
shocking nor of any real consequence.  It's hard to fathom what in the
script exactly attracted the involvement of a few _X-Files_ vets--director
David Nutter, composer Mark Snow (who wrote a terrifically eerie score that
the film doesn't deserve), and, in small roles, _X_ guest star Steve
Railsback (Duane Barry, the guy who kidnapped Scully) and recurrent Chris
Owens (Agent Jeffrey Spender, Cigarette-Smoking Man's son).  As Steve, the
hero with the requisite damaged past (he is haunted by the suicide of his
older brother), James Marsden has blue eyes and clean-cut looks tailor-made
for a _Bop_ pinup--and all the emotional depth and acting range of the page
it would be printed on.  Katie Holmes, the standout cast member of TV's
_Dawson's_Creek_, is wated as the token tattooed, body-pierced love
interest.  To paraphrase the theme of her hit show, you don't want to wait
for this film to be over.  Just leave.  Better yet, just don't go in the
first place.

Title
Review for Michael Jordan to the Max (2000)
_Michael_Jordan_to_the_Max_  *** (out of ****)
As hard as it may be to believe, I--whose second claim to pseudo-fame on the 'Net has been my Michael Jordan fan sites, plus my work as chat host at his official website--had never once attended a single Chicago Bulls game during his illustrious run with the team.  So on the basis of that alone, I was grateful to be able to experience _Michael_Jordan_to_the_Max_ on the giant IMAX screen last summer.  In fleshing out many memorable highlights from Jordan's final NBA championship run in 1998 on a screen eight stories high and bolstering every last sonic detail in crystalline digital surround sound, directors James M. Stern and Don Kempf did Jordan fans the world over a huge favor, giving those not fortunate to ever see one of Jordan's basketball games live as good an approximation of the up-close and courtside experience as could ever be hoped for.
But _Michael_Jordan_to_the_Max_ is no mere highlight reel; interspersing images from those memorable final playoff series with interview footage with teammates and noteworthy admirers (thankfully, no Tiger Woods) as well as candid talks with Jordan himself, the film is structured less as a basic retrospective than as an inspirational piece.  On those terms, it's hard to argue with its effectiveness, especially for children.  The notable negative touchstones of Jordan's life and career are addressed: being cut from his high school team, the tragic loss of his father, the ill-fated detour in minor league baseball.  Through it all, Jordan persevered and managed to attain even greater heights of glory, and fans young and old will find it impossible to be unmoved.
Ironically, though, the most devout of Jordan fans will probably be the least affected, for this is all information with which we are more than familiar.  Ditto to an even greater degree the bulk of the basketball footage; considering how closely Jordan's final season, particularly that final championship run, was followed by the media, even more casual fans may feel a sense of déjŕ vu.  Also, the slickness of the editing and packaging, complete with regal narration by Laurence Fishburne, give the film the feeling of a video by NBA Entertainment (who, in fact, co-produced)blown up to really large proportions--not necessarily a bad thing, but it adds to the air of familiarity.
Even so, there's no denying the power of seeing the intense hoops action on such an imposing screen though for me--and, I imagine, many other ardent fans--the most memorable portions of _Michael_Jordan_to_the_Max_ are the quieter ones that offer an all-too-small taste of MJ the man.  It's a testament to Jordan's charisma that even in the few interview segments and the brief glimpses of him off the hardwood his personality shines through.  That said, it would have been nice to see more footage like the glimpses of him having fun at his youth basketball camp and goofing off during practices--stuff I suspect fans rarely get to see (though I must say I had the distinct pleasure and privilege of attending a Bulls practice back in 1997 and experienced first-hand Jordan's perspective of a typical mob scene waiting outside--a hectic image repeated a few times over in one passage of the film).
_Michael_Jordan_to_the_Max_ has been dismissed as a bit of softball puffery, an accusation not entirely unfair but one, I feel, is ultimately forgivable.  After all, it does brings the astounding accomplishments of the greatest athlete of our time to life with astonishing visual clarity and detail (however, even on IMAX, the distinctive color of Jordan's eyes still cannot be exactly captured); and, furthermore, it's a film for the fans by fans--and few within Jordan's legion of admirers will come away disappointed.
The DVD release of _Michael_Jordan_to_the_Max_ begs an obvious question: what's the point of issuing an edition of a film made for a super-large screen for the comparatively microscopic dimensions of the home screen?  The question is not entirely without validity, not to mention one I'd likely ask myself.  However, in this case, I feel the question is moot--before the release of the _Max_ disc, there was no DVD of actual Jordan game highlights on the market.  So now, at long last, some of the most memorable moments in sport are available for fans to keep in DVD's superb audio and video quality.
That fact alone would be enough to recommend the disc, but the supplements that make it an even more worthwhile buy.  Directors James M. Stern and Don Kempf, along with producer Steve Kempf, provide an informative and lively commentary.  Wags may complain that they lay on the Jordan reverence even thicker on the track, but that also adds to the charm, not to mention reinforces the "film made for fans by fans" idea; if only more filmmakers displayed the same unabashed passion for their film's subject.  However, the film's brief running time (46 minutes, per IMAX standard) means they can't get into too much detail about too many things though they are refreshingly honest about the various "cheats" they used to heighten the drama, such as editing together game highlights in non-chronological order.
Much of the buzz talk surrounding _Michael_Jordan_to_the_Max_ focused on the opening and closing shot of one of Jordan's signature slam dunks, which was captured using the "bullet-time" technique prominently featured in _The_Matrix_.  The DVD includes a fast-paced two-minute reel that shows how the various individual components were assembled to create that shot, and the actual filming of Jordan dunking against a green screen is prominently featured in a longer 21-minute featurette on the general making of the film--though the segment is clearly slanted toward the making of that effects shot.
The usual collection of television spots, trailers, and crew biographies are also included, as well as detailed stats on Jordan's regular season and postseason careers--a nice finishing touch to a classy digital tribute to a living legend.

Title
Review for Mummy, The (1999)
_The_Mummy_ (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
Well, it seemed like a good idea: a lavish, big-budget retelling of the
1932 horror classic _The_Mummy_.  But after seeing the finished product as
written and directed by Stephen Sommers (who last perpetrated the undersea
howler _Deep_Rising_) one would be wise to heed one of its trailer's tag
words: "Beware."
To his credit, Sommers makes his _Mummy_ a different type of animal from
its precursor.  Instead of a traditional horror piece, this _Mummy_ is more
of an adventure film, with our central trio--American adventurer Rick
O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), British librarian Evelyn Carnarvon (Rachel
Weisz), and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah)--trying to unlock the
secrets of a legendary lost burial site in 1930s Egypt.  Once there, they
and a rival group of explorers--who are in the hunt for some buried
treasure--end up uncovering something more than they bargained for: the
awakened mummy of the ancient High-priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), who is
determined to bring himself and his lost love back to full life.
What Sommers is clearly after is the rollicking roller coaster vibe of the
_Indiana_Jones_ films, but one little detail is lost on him.  While the
_Indy_ flicks were in the light, jaunty vein of old serial films, Steven
Spielberg knew that the tongue could and should not always be kept in
cheek.  The scary parts were indeed scary; the suspenseful moments were
taken seriously.  The same cannot be said of _The_Mummy_, which wears a
silly, jokey attitude throughout and suffers for it.  How can one truly be
frightened or intimidated by Imhotep and his murderous rage when each
would-be shock is blunted by an idiotic wisecrack (which _every_ character
seems have ready) or slapsticky situation?
It would also help if the creature's appearance were scary or at least
creepy; unless you lose sleep over the Cryptkeeper from
_Tales_from_the_Crypt_, likely the sight of the mummified Imhotep won't
invade even a daydream.  In fact, with the exception of some impressive
visuals involving the movement of sand, the effects work in _The_Mummy_ is
strangely unconvincing.  The walking undead and deadly Scarab beetles look
like they never left the computer screen, and the opening shot--showing a
giant sphinx and pyramids as workers and others scurry by--is no more
lifelike than the nearly identical opening shot of _The_Prince_of_Egypt_.
Not that the flesh-and-blood actors are themselves give the film much
life, either.  Fraser has proven to be a terrific actor in small films as
diverse as the romantic fantasy _Still_Breathing_ to last fall's
Oscar-winning _Gods_and_Monsters_, but when it comes to big time popcorn
films, he always falls flat, to say the least.  First it was his painfully
broad turn in the unwatchable _George_of_the_Jungle_; now it's this
half-hearted attempt to channel Harrison Ford's roguish charm.  More
successful at evoking _Indiana_Jones_ is Weisz, but in the wrong way: her
Evelyn is only a notch less shrill than Kate Capshaw's Willie Scott
(_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom_), easily the worst heroine in the
_Indy_ series.
_The_Mummy_ definitely does not bore; it holds one's attention for its
entire running time, and the millions of its megabudget do show up on
screen.  But shouldn't an adventure film at least offer something
resembling excitement?

Review for Gloria (1999)
Since her breakthrough performance in 1992's _Basic_Instinct_, Sharon
Stone has been intent on proving that she is a "serious actress."  Yet
while she earned her critical and industry vindication with her Golden
Globe-winning and Academy Award-nominated turn in 1995's _Casino_, Stone
still feels she has something to prove.
Stone's latest bid for her already-won respectability (further cemented by
her generally well-received turn in 1996's _Last_Dance_ and her recent
Globe nod for last year's _The_Mighty_) is _Gloria_, director Sidney
Lumet's update of John Cassavetes's 1980 drama of the same name, which
earned star Gena Rowlands matching Oscar and Golden Globe nominations.  I
have not seen the original film, but on her own merits (despite a
distracting accent, which also marred her otherwise strong _Last Dance_
work), Stone delivers an appropriately steely but warmly comedic turn as
the title character, a gangster's (Jeremy Northam) ex-girlfriend who takes
under her wing a young boy (newcomer Jean-Luke Figueroa) whose family was
killed by the gangster's crew.
It is highly doubtful, though, that Stone will duplicate Rowland's double
nomination, for the film overall is much less effective than she is.
Although the film had been sitting on Sony's shelf for a year, and the
studio opted not to screen it for critics, _Gloria_ is not the disaster
those facts would suggest; the film is simply more dull than anything else.
 Lumet is no stranger to the streets of New York, having walked the
territory in films sush as _Dog_Day_Afternoon_ and _Serpico_, and the look
and atmosphere of _Gloria_ bears a gritty authenticity.  But there's little
Lumet can do to juice up Steven Antin's suspenseless update of Cassavetes's
original script--not even an extended car chase.  Not long after the setup,
where Gloria is released from a Florida prison; a mob thug murders the
family of the kid, Nicky; and the two meet, the film settles into a
predictable rhythm.  Scenes of Gloria being simultaneously annoyed and
charmed by Nicky alternate with those of her ex, Kevin, ordering his men to
find and kill the pair and retrieve the precious floppy disk in the Nicky's
possession.  The repetitive nature of the script could have been made
somewhat bearable if it built to an exciting climax and resolution, but
there is neither.  The conflict with Kevin is resolved in a most
anticlimactic fashion, and the outcome of the Gloria/Nicky relationship is
pretty much what one can predict from the get-go.
So, yes, Miss Stone, you can act, as we can see yet again in _Gloria_.  We
get it already.  Now it's time to start entertaining your audience,
something you haven't done in much too long.

Title
Review for S.L.C. Punk! (1999)
Structurally speaking, James Merendino's portrait of Stevo (Matthew
Lillard) and Bob (Michael Goorjian), two young punk rockers in 1985 Salt
Lake City, is a complete mess.  Blue-haired Stevo is the narrator; he often
directly addressing the camera and is prone to abandoning points and plots
in midstream in favor of random tangents that almost always never return to
their point of origin.  The chaotic result is unquestionably hard to follow
at times, but that seems to be the point; though this hyperactive
storytelling style, Merendino captures the anarchic spirit that is, as
Stevo eloquently explains at length at various points, the essence of the
punk movement.
Still, with so much--or, depending on how one looks at it, so
_little_--going on, _SLC_Punk!_ would be all sound and fury without a
strong center, and the film does have one in Lillard.  It would have been
easy for him to coast by on pure attitude and ebullience, but Lillard
invests the role of Stevo with genuine humanity, which is essential for the
climactic moment where he inevitably comes of age.  Lillard is supported
well by the able troupe playing the many secondary characters that pass
through the film.  Particularly memorable is Til Schweiger as a
quick-tempered drug dealer; on the other hand, notably underused as Stevo
and Bob's ladies' man buddy Eddie is Adam Pascal, in whose footsteps I will
someday follow as Roger Davis in the musical _Rent_.

Title
Review for Beloved (1998)
Jonathan Demme's _Beloved_, based on Toni Morrison's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel of the same name, is a movie of moments--moments of
raw, lyrical emotional power scattered over a nearly three-hour time
expanse.  While the extended running time does little to dilute the potency
of these isolated moments, it does, however, blunt the dramatic urgency of
the assembled story.  Instead of cutting deep into the heart, _Beloved_
pierces the heart; the film is indeed moving, but lacking the momentum to
make a sweeping emotional impact.
_Beloved_ is named after a character in the story, a mysterious young
woman (Thandie Newton) who shows up in the yard of Sethe (Oprah Winfrey)
one morning in 1873.  Sethe is a runaway slave trying to provide a decent
living for herself and her daughter Denver (Kimberly Elise) on the
outskirts of Cleveland, Ohio.  With the arrival of old friend Paul D (Danny
Glover) and, later, the childlike Beloved (whom she takes in), Sethe's life
appears to be taking a turn for the better, but the secrets of her tortured
past refuse to rest in peace.
It is my understanding that the screenplay, credited to Akosua Busia,
Richard LaGravenese, and Adam Brooks, is remarkably faithful to Morrison's
narrative structure.  In theory, fidelity to source material is a good
thing, but it does not completely work here.  Often, watching _Beloved_
feels like reading a book--a good thing if one is indeed reading, but not
necessarily what one is looking for when watching a film.  Although the
basics of Morrison's story and her characters are compelling, not much
really _happens_--at least not enough to sustain the 172-minute running
time.  As such, the memorable moments--and there are quite a number of
powerful ones, particularly some harrowing, hard-to-watch flashbacks of the
young Sethe's (Lisa Gay Hamilton) horrific past--are a bit too widespread
to make an assembled effect.  Any emotional response to any given moment
exists independently of any other.
Still, I must give Demme and the writers credit for the risks they take.
In duplicating Morrison's timeline-jumping structure, they demand an
inordinant amount of concentration from the viewer, and very few films
present such a fascinating challenge.  And while the structure and stately
pace work against the building of narrative momentum, they create a
haunting--or, rather, _haunted_--atmosphere.  Most of the key action in
_Beloved_ takes place in the past, and the film makes an uncanny
duplication of the seemingly cyclical nature of memories in one's mind,
revealing its secrets little by little, fragment by fragment, leaving
certain events only to retrace and expand on them later.  Granted, this
technique makes a lot of the action hard to follow, sometimes frustratingly
so, but it creates a feeling that is rich and unique.  Also unique is how
Demme isn't afraid to show the grimy nature of life in the time period;
instead of giving everything a shiny Hollywood sheen, the dirt and grit is
always there, on the sets and even the actors.
Also extending to the cast is this element of risk.  Taking the most
chances is Newton, who delivers a raw, unpredictable performance.  Called
upon to bare body and soul, adopt maladroit body movements and slurred
speech rhythms, she could have easily come off as ridiculously overwrought
and alien, but her soulful eyes consistently project a tempering humanity.
Not to be outdone, of course, is Winfrey.  People forget that before she
became a daytime TV phenomenon, she first made a name of herself as an
Oscar-nominated actress (for _The_Color_Purple_), and her work here is
restrained and, as such, the more emotionally honest; the same goes for
Glover.  But the standout performer is the one who will likely be the most
overlooked--Elise.  She doesn't have a role as literally showy as Newton's,
nor does she have the star power of a Winfrey or Glover, but she
is_Beloved_'s steadying force.  Denver has the most dramatic evolution out
of all the characters (from shut-in to independent woman), yet remains the
most stable; the key is to not play the change as if it were dramatic but
natural.  Elise's performance is so natural that it is easy to forget she
is an actress playing a part.
_Beloved_ is a wearying film, and that comment should be interpreted in
all the ways it can be.  On the positive side, the filmmakers so
successfully create the intended air of melancholy that it is daunting.
But on the negative end, one cannot help but feel exhausted, emotionally
and physically, after three slow hours.  Similarly, by that time the film
is also exhausted.  I was indeed be moved by _Beloved_, but in the end,
there wasn't enough momentum left to truly sweep me away, as it should have.

Title
Review for Road Trip (2000)
The recruited young seatfillers at the press screening audibly ate up
every crass minute of this college road comedy--a scene that I am certain
will be duplicated in many theatres the nation over as the film becomes
one of the summer's sleeper successes.  However, if you don't find gags
such as, say, jumping a car over a downed bridge funny, likely you won't
enjoy the string of equally unoriginal and far raunchier gags that
director/co-writer (with Scot Armstrong) Todd Phillips passes off as
plot.  The antics are set into motion when Josh (Breckin Meyer), who
attends college in Ithaca, NY, accidentally sends his Austin, TX-based
girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) a videotape of his infidelity with
the fetching Beth (Amy Smart).  With only three days until Tiffany
returns to her dorm after a bereavement leave (her grandfather just
passed), Josh and friends E.L. (Seann William Scott), Rubin (Paulo
Costanzo), and Kyle (DJ Qualls) hit the road to intercept the package.
Just how much emphasis does Phillips give individual gags over basic
storytelling practices?  I did not know Scott's character's name until
the last scene, when narrator Barry (Tom Green), who recounts the story
of the film to a campus tour group, tells the characters' fates.  Green
will undoubtedly be the main draw for the young MTV crowd, but not only
is his screen time limited, Phillips and Armstrong don't find a smooth
way to fit him into the film.  The framing device of the tour has a weak
payoff, and Barry's involvement in the main story--he has to feed Rubin's
pet snake while the guys are away--is tangential at best.  Not that the
main story is all that great to begin with: just a series of uninspired
gags, ranging from the gross (a sperm bank interlude) to the insulting
(the white quartet is scared by a room full of black men--how funny and
progressive).  The trip would be more tolerable if this motley crew were
fun to hang out with, but with the exception of Meyer (whom I've grown to
like more with each film), the travelers are annoying.  Scott's E.L. is
basically _American_Pie_'s obnoxious Stifler with more screen time; the
character of Rubin is nondescript and Costanzo personality-free; Qualls
fails to command any sympathy as the token nerd.  If you're tempted to
watch _Road_Trip_ by the raucous trailer, be forewarned: it gives away
nearly all of the film's better jokes.

Review for Emperor's New Groove, The (2000)
_The_Emperor's_New_Groove_ (G) *** (out of ****)
With Disney's 38th animated feature, _The_Emperor's_New_Groove_, come
two distinct perceptions.  The title's nontraditional inclusion of a
slang term and the film's no-frills art style could be read as reflective
of a general attitude: looser, wilder, hipper--a brazen new direction for
the usually staid House of Mouse.  Then there's the less forgiving point
of view, which takes into account the film's turbulent path to the
screen.  Originally conceived as a DreamWorks-style epic musical drama
called _Kingdom_of_the_Sun_, the film morphed into its current tune-free
incarnation when the concept was completely overhauled after a third of
the film had already been completely animated; _Groove_'s lean running
time and lack of a big animation showpiece--a staple of modern Disney
'toons--would lend support to the thought of the end product as one big
rush job.
After seeing _Groove_, I'd say both sides of the argument hold water. 
Coming off of the heels of the technological breakthroughs of last year's
_Tarzan_, this film's scaled-down visual style cannot help but be a
letdown; also, the story is even more threadbare than one is used to,
even by family film standards.  That said, there's no denying the energy
and joy present in this zippy tale, and the film's genial, unpretentious
nature--not to mention sharp wit--are what will win over the most cynical
viewer.
Its rocky production history aside, _Groove_ faces a major hurdle from
the outset, a problem it never completely overcomes: the voice casting of
its lead character, Kuzco.  The film's original title,
_Kingdom_of_the_Sun_, figures into the retooled story as a basic
description of the arrogant and materialistic South American emperor's
dream project: a sun-drenched mountain-top retreat/monument-to-self whose
construction means bulldozing the homes of many villagers--in particular,
honorable peasant Pacha (voiced by John Goodman), his wife (Wendie
Malick), and their children.  So by basic story design, Kuzco is a pretty
obnoxious character, and the casting of famously acerbic ex-_SNL_'er
David Spade would appear to be spot-on.  However, it proves to be _too_
perfect; anyone familiar with his work knows that when he plays an
asshole, he plays the role to the smarmy, one-dimensional extreme, with
absolutely no trace of latent sincerity or humanity.  As one would
expect, _Groove_'s basic arc is the bratty young ruler's gradual
discovery of some sense of compassion, and with Spade cranked to maximum,
irredeemable abrasion from frame one, the ultimate transition isn't
believable.  Even worse, it's impossible to care if he changes--both in
terms of personality and physical appearance, for his conniving,
magic-dabbling advisor Yzma (Eartha Kitt) transforms him into... a llama.
That plot point shows how director Mark Dindal and writing collaborators
Chris Williams and David Reynolds are able to make this _Groove_ an
ultimately smooth one: reckless comic abandon.  The llama-fied Kuzco ends
up teaming with the goodhearted Pacha to return to the royal palace and
reclaim his throne, and during their big road trip, the two get into a
number of very funny comic predicaments--that is, when they're not
engaging in some inspired verbal sparring.  Not every gag works--a
slapsticky scene in which the pair try to evade Yzma and her lunkheaded
servant Kronk (voiced to scene-stealing perfection by Patrick Warburton)
in a restaurant particularly reeks of sitcom--but the duds are a
tolerable tradeoff for antic highlights such as the chain reaction of
calamity that results when Kuzco and Pacha walk across an unsteady rope
bridge.  Dindal and company also use the gaps and inconsistencies in the
plot to their advantage, using them to spin cleverly self-effacing jokes.
Given its lightweight nature, _The_Emperor's_New_Groove_ won't be
recognized as one of Disney's crowning animated achievements; the years
will be especially cruel to the very of-its-time title.  What matters,
however, is the here and now, and despite obvious shortcomings, this
rollicking ride will have no trouble getting viewers of all ages to feel
its groove.

Title
Review for Grease (1978)
Twenty years after its initial theatrical release, Randal Kleiser's film
of the '50s-set stage musical Grease is just as popular, if not moreso,
than it was in 1978.  How can such a cinematic trifle have such enduring
appeal?  Quite simply, this tuneful look at one eventful school year at
Rydell High is one of those rare films where just about every last thing
about it falls magically into place.
Grease's remarkable staying power can first be attributed to the immense
appeal of its romantic leads, John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.  For my
money, Travolta's turn as bad boy Danny Zuko is the quintessential Travolta
performance--effortlessly supercool and confident with a sweet, goofy
innocence lying underneath a slick veneer of decadence.  Although his '90s
comeback has included some of his best work as an actor, the recent
Travolta he has never been the astonishingly charismatic presence he is
here (the closest he has gotten is in 1995's Get Shorty), whether leading
his fellow T-Birds during the energetic "Greased Lightning" number or
hilariously attempting various sports to impress Newton-John's Sandy Olson.
 Critics blasted Newton-John as being too bland, but they missed the
point--Sandy, fresh-off-the-boat from Australia, is _supposed_ to be bland,
which is not to say that she's boring.  Newton-John _is_ incredibly
wholesome, but in a pure, radiant sense.  She has a glowing, angelic
quality that is captivating, which is not to say that she isn't able to
pull off Sandy's eventual image makeover; spiritedly shimmying in black
leather, Newton-John more than proves to be up to the task.
A musical lives or dies by its soundtrack, and it is here that Grease
truly soars.  The opening number "Summer Nights," in which Danny and Sandy
recall their summer romance, isn't the biggest karaoke tune of all time for
nothing; it's as deliriously buoyant as they come.  That classic song and
the others that originate from Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey's stage score,
including the aforementioned automotive celebration "Greased Lightning" and
bad girl Rizzo's (Stockard Channing) showcase lament "There Are Worse
Things I Could Do," are great, but the musical highlights are the three
tunes written expressly for the film.  Newton-John is at her heartfelt best
crooning John Farrar's Oscar-nominated ballad "Hopelessly Devoted to You,"
where Sandy soliloquizes on her love for Danny after he rebuffs her.
Tables are turned later on in the film, which sets the stage for Travolta's
best number, Louis St. Louis and Scott Simon's "Sandy," which includes the
immortal verse "Stranded at the drive-in/Branded a fool/What will they
say/Monday at school?"  Perhaps the best-known song from the film aside
from "Summer Nights" is Travolta and Newton-John's hit duet "You're the One
That I Want," also written by Farrar.  With its "Oooh-hoo-hoo, honey"
chorus, this toetapper is catchy almost to the point of annoyance.  Almost.
But what really takes the film over the top--and makes it such an enduring
entertainment--is its joyful exuberance.  From the knowingly cornball "Love
Is a Many-Splendored Thing" prologue to the "Born to Hand Jive" dance-off
to the"We Go Together" closing production number, there is never a dull
moment in Grease.  The energy is so infectious that it carries the audience
through the more ridiculous scenes, most notably "Beauty School Dropout,"
where a guardian angel (Frankie Avalon) advises would-be beautician Frenchy
(Didi Conn) to return to high school.  There are a few rough spots that
cannot be overcome; I was never a fan of the animated opening credit
sequence nor of the Barry Gibb-penned, Frankie Valli-sung title tune that
accompanies it; and while the too-old-for-high-school appearances of the
cast are generally forgivable, there is one huge exception--Annette
Charles, who plays sexpot dancer Cha Cha, looks downright elderly.  But
those are very minor quibbles.
So why go to the theatre and see a movie that is so widely available on
home video?  If you've only seen Grease on the small screen, you really
haven't experienced it at all.  The big screen restores the film's wide
2.35:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio, correcting the damage wrought by the
video's horrible pan-and-scan job--no longer are half of Travolta and
Newton-John's faces missing for the last line of "Summer Nights."  But most
impressive is the digitally remastered sound, which enhances sounds one
wouldn't be likely to catch before, such as background vocals on
"Hopelessly Devoted to You" and jet-propulsion noises when Danny and
Sandy's car takes its magical flight to happily ever after.
So it's no wonder why this incredibly fun slice of '50s nostalgia has
stood the test of time.  Much like how the assembled Rydell graduates sing
"we'll always be together," Grease will always be around, and it will
remain "the word" for generations to come.

Title
Review for Amistad (1997)

Amistad (R) ** (out of ****)
        The true story of the 1839 revolt on the Spanish slave ship La Amistad
would appear to make strong material for a film, and the brilliant opening
scene of Steven Spielberg's Amistad proves that point.  Depicting in
graphic, unflinching detail how the imprisoned Africans, led by one Cinque
(Djimon Hounsou), fought against their captors and took command the ship,
the scene gets the film off to a bold, arresting start, delivering the
promise of a highly charged and powerful two-and-a-half-hours.
        Alas, the promise remains just that, a promise, and the ultimately
disappointing Amistad loses its momentum once the action shifts from the
sea to New England, where the 44 Amistad Africans end up.  Held under lock
and key once more, the Africans, charged with murder and piracy, become the
objects in a heated property trial, and the film settles into the familiar
rhythm of a courtroom drama.  The prepubescent Queen Isabella (Anna Paquin)
of Spain argues that the Africans are rightfully hers, claiming that the
passengers were Cuban-born slaves; the British Navy lay a counter claim
since, as they maintain, the passengers were not slaves but free people
illegally captured from West Africa.  Looking out for the Africans'
interests are abolitionists Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and Lewis
Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard), as well as Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey),
a young attorney with a struggling practice.
        If McConaughey's role sounds familiar, it should--he is playing no more
than a variation on his starmaking role in A Time to Kill, which just adds
to the routine quality of the courtroom scenes, which are the meat and
potatoes of the film.  As well-acted as these scenes are, especially by
Pete Postlethwaite as the prosecutor, none of them really engaged me.  The
proceedings are strangely devoid of any tension or suspense, except for one
moment where the overwhelming pressure Cinque feels is reflected by a
pulsating drumbeat.  But that is squandered, for the scene climaxes with
Cinque making a dramatic outburst that can best be described as a perfect
example of the cloying sentimentality that often mars Spielberg films.
Spielberg managed to control his inclination toward emotional bombast in
Schindler's List, and the film was much more effective for it; a similar
understatement would have worked better for Amistad, whose most powerful
moments are the quieter ones, such as a modest yet moving scene where
Cinque and his friend Yamba (Razaaq Adoti) attempt to interpret the Bible.
        Eventually the Amistad Africans' case makes it to the Supreme Court, with
none other than former President John Quincy Adams (Sir Anthony Hopkins)
arguing on their behalf.  The usually great Hopkins delivers one of his
weakest performances; he lays on the cantankerous old codger schtick a bit
too thick, and he does something peculiar with his voice--not his American
accent (which I, for one, did not mind at all in Nixon), but he makes it
kind of high pitched and lispy, at times almost squeaky and chirpy.
Needless to say, this is highly distracting and, in the end, annoying,
especially since his character handles the climactic oratory.
        But by this late juncture in the film, the problem with Hopkins's
elocution is the least of the film's troubles.  I felt as if the real
story--that of the Africans--had been lost.  Baldwin's case hinges on the
fact that the Amistad Africans are people, not property, yet, with the
exception of Cinque and maybe (to a much lesser extent) Yamba, screenwriter
David Franzoni never develops them as people.  Granted, it would have been
impossible to delve into the identities of all 44.   But if Franzoni had
applied to the Africans some of the  effort he uses to make the Americans a
varied bunch, the film would have been given a deeper human dimension.
        But even with the underdeveloped African perspective, the scenes that
squarely focus on them are more compelling than any of the legal action
with the Yanks.  The closest Amistad comes to recapturing the opening
scene's power is an extended flashback where Cinque recounts the events
leading up to the revolt.  This sequence, which opens with the violent
capture in Sierra Leone, progresses through the harrowing sail to and from
Cuba, and then concludes with a brief recap of the revolt, gets under the
skin and stays there, which is a lot more than can be said for all of the
courtroom scenes, which barely have a single memorable moment between them.
        The same can be said about the cast of characters, despite the very worthy
efforts of the actors, which is by far Amistad's strongest asset.  The
always-reliable Freeman's presence is always welcome, but his character is
a minor background player at best.  McConaughey predictably plays his
familiar role with ease, but the character of Roger Baldwin never exhibits
much personality.  Nigel Hawthorne's President Martin Van Buren _does_ have
personality, but his screen time, much like Freeman's, is limited.   The
only character, American or African, that comes to full-blooded, vivid life
is Cinque, played with mesmerizing ferocity by the charismatic Hounsou, a
remarkable find who has come a very long way indeed from his heretofore
most visible work, lipsynching in Janet Jackson's 1990 "Love Will Never Do
(Without You)" video.
         As I have stated, the true story of the Amistad Africans would make a
great film.  But not only do I not think Amistad is that film, I do not
think it really is a film about them.  A true Amistad movie should be an
inspiring, highly emotional and moving tale about the courage and will of
the Africans themselves--not the mildly affecting, American-centered
courtroom drama that Spielberg has made.  (opens December 10)

Title
Review for American Pie (1999)
If you see the trailer for _American_Pie_ in the theatre, temporarily
leave the auditorium.  If you see the commercial on TV, change the
channel.  This raucous teen sex comedy's most powerful weapon is the
element of surprise--a tactic that, based on their full disclosure
marketing campaign, Universal seems intent on ruining.
But even if you have already caught a glimpse of an ad or two, there are
still a good amount of big, unexpected laughs in this unapologetically
raunchy romp from screenwriter Adam Herz and director Paul Weitz, both
making their debuts in their respective fields.  What isn't so
unexpected, however, is the thinness of the premise.  Four seniors (Jason
Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, and Eddie Kaye Thomas) vow to be
virgins no more after prom night.  C'est tout.
It's not like anyone buying a ticket to _American_Pie_ is looking for
plot innovation; they are looking to laugh, and indeed they will.  Along
the way, though, viewers will be meet a variety of keenly defined
characters--an uncommon occurrence in this era of _Can't_Hardly_Wait_s
and _She's_All_That_s.  The focal guy is Jim, a nice, if bashful and
hopelessly desperate (as evidenced in the infamous scene that lends the
film its title) guy made very sympathetic by Biggs, who is like a younger
and much more likable David Schwimmer.  Thomas's mochachino-drinking
Finch is given the last amount of screen time of the four, but, like the
even more peripheral players, such as sex advice-dispensing Jessica
(Natasha Lyonne) and gabby geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), he carves out
a memorable niche.
The same goes for Oz (Klein), the jock who turns over a sensitive new
leaf en route to the big score; and Kevin (Nicholas), who is anxious to
go all the way with his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid).  But their
respective plot threads eventually point up to _American_Pie_'s
shortcoming.  Oz's newfound gentle side wins him the genuine affection of
jazz ensemble singer Heather (Mena Suvari), and he finds himself feeling
the same way; and issues of true love play a major role in the
Kevin-Vicky relationship.  Needless to say, these forays into more
earnest territory don't quite gel amid the air of tawdriness.
Audiences will be too busy eating up the many hilariously inspired
moments in _American_Pie_ to remember, let alone think, about any serious
issues it misguidedly touches upon.  That's the whole point of the
exercise, anyway--having a good time, and audiences are certain to have a
blast.

Review for Down to Earth (2001)
        There's no denying that Chris Rock is a funny man.  On the
stand-up stage, he blazes, eliciting many a large laugh with his fierce
mix of rage and joy.  But one thing few would ever say about Rock is that
he's a great actor.  This is not to say that he's an especially bad one,
for he has been effective in small roles in _Dogma_ and _Nurse_Betty_. 
It's just that one doesn't exactly equate "lead movie star" with him, and
his flat starring vehicle _Down_to_Earth_ doesn't do anything to change
that perception.
        Part of the problem is that he is never quite able to completely
shake off his stand-up persona.  Granted, on screen he displays the same
charismatic presence he has on stage, but the barking line delivery and
cadences of his stand-up delivery also carry over, which makes it
difficult to separate Rock from the character he's supposed to be
playing.  _Down_to_Earth_, a remake of 1978's _Heaven_Can_Wait_ (which
itself was a remake of 1941's _Here_Comes_Mr._Jordan_), makes an obvious
attempt to ease the transition by casting Rock as Lance Barton, a
stand-up comic.  This, however, just makes matters worse; whenever Lance
takes the stage and does his act, we see Rock (who happened to co-write
the script and recycle some of his own material), not the character of
Lance.
        The plot, as it is, has struggling stand-up Lance suffering an
untimely death in a traffic accident; apparently, this was a mistake, so
an angel named King (Chazz Palminteri) quickly gives Lance another
body--which, unfortunately, is that of just-deceased  billionaire Charles
Wellington.  Lance negotiates this to be a temporary arrangement, but he
has second thoughts when he meets activist Sontee (Regina King), whom
Lance manages to successfully woo while in the body of the much-older
white man.
        Rock and King manage to generate some charm together, but their
romance is often lost amid easy fish-out-of-body jokes (there is not only
one, but two, scenes of Lance bumping to rap music, forgetting he's in
the form of a portly old white man) and boring subplots, in particular
one revolving around Wellington's scheming wife (Jennifer Saunders) and
her lover (Greg Germann), who also happens to be Wellington's right-hand
man.
        _Down_to_Earth_ was directed by Chris and Paul Weitz, but this
film doesn't display any of the antic spirit of their last film,
_American_Pie_--not even during the stand-up sequences that should be
comic high points.  But just at fault, if not more, is Rock, who
fashioned a less-than-ideal project for himself.  When someone wants to
see a Chris Rock comedy, one wants to see him R-rated unleashed--not so
much in terms of profanity than his intelligently biting adult humor.  In
_Down_to_Earth_, not only has his edge been smoothed over, so has his
smarts.

Review for Price Above Rubies, A (1998)
A Price Above Rubies (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
Renee Zellweger stars as Sonia, a young Jewish wife and mother frustrated
by the constraints of her Hasidic community in Brooklyn.  Her husband
(Glenn Fitzgerald) is a religious scholar whose all-in-a-day's-work
attitude on sex fails to tame the "fire" she feels within, as so she
confesses to the rebbe (after hearing her fiery confession, the rebbe
suddenly gets frisky with his pleasantly surprised wife--and dies the next
morning).  Sensing her frustration, her husband's brother (Christopher
Eccleston) gives her a job in his jewelry brokering business in exchange
for raw, passionless sex that just fans Sonia's still-burning flame.  On
the job, Sonia befriends Ramon (Allen Payne), a cool blast of hunky Puerto
Rican water who does his own jewelry designs when not working as a grunt in
an upscale jewelry store.  Can fire-taming be far be that far behind for
the ever-smoldering Sonia?
Just about everything in writer-director Boaz Yakin's rings false,
starting with the improbably cast Zellweger, who does an adequate enough
acting job but simply looks too WASPy for the role.  A better fit would
have been Julianna Margulies, who outshines Zellweger as Sonia's
take-no-crap sister-in-law.  Some of Sonia's baby steps toward liberation,
such as indulging in a non-kosher egg roll in Chinatown, come off as silly.
 Yakin attempts to spice up the proceedings with a touch of magical
realism--in the form of the recurring presence of Sonia's long-dead
brother's ghost--make the story feel even more trite than it already is.

Title
Review for Serendipity (2001)
_Serendipity_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
        "A fortunate accident" is how Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) defines the
concept of "serendipity" to Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) early on in Peter
Chelsom's romantic comedy of the same name.  Accident or not, _Serendipity_ the
film can certainly be described as a "fortunate" arrival in multiplexes during
this less-than-stellar year.  The film is hardly a groundbreaker, but it most
certainly a big-hearted charmer--and when it comes to the rom-com genre, that's
all that matters.
        Much of the charm comes from leads Cusack and Beckinsale, who establish
a palpable romantic rapport in the film's extended prologue.  It's rush holiday
shopping season in 1990 New York City, and Jonathan and Sara meet when fighting
for the last pair of black cashmere gloves in a crowded department store.  A
search for gloves appears to have become a discovery of love, for the strongly
attracted pair then spend one long night on the town getting to know each other
and falling hard.  But the timing is off for the attached Sara, and she proposes
to Jonathan an unusual plan where they part, leaving their reunion entirely up
to the powers of fate.  Years later, Sara and Jonathan are in committed
relationships with other people, but both still keep watch for possible
signs--and consider the idea of taking destiny into their own hands.
        Notions of fate and destiny aren't an alien concept in romantic
comedies; in recent years the concept has become somewhat of a staple, playing a
role in films from 1993's smash _Sleepless_in_Seattle_ to the recently released
_Happy_Accidents_.  Writer Marc Klein doesn't make many, if any, deviations from
tried-and-true formula.  Not only do the pieces of the plot fall into their
expected places at all the regularly scheduled intervals, the characterizations
also have a ring of familiarity.  Both Sara and Jonathan have best
friends/sounding boards who have quirky senses of humor; the current love
interest for the female is eccentric to say the least, and the one for the male
has her share of neuroses.
        While innovation is always a welcome addition to any film, it's not
entirely necessary in a film like _Serendipity_.  What matters most is the
manner in which it goes about its familiar business, and those behind
_Serendipity_ have made an immensely likable entertainment.  Not only do they
strike convincing sparks together, the affable Cusack and the luminous
Beckinsale are able to engage the audience individually, a critical component
considering they spend most of the film carrying separate halves of the film. 
However, they are strongly helped by the well-cast supporting players.  The
lively comic instincts of Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven elevate what could have
easily been stock best friend roles; in Piven's case, his lifelong off-screen
friendship with Cusack makes for an added level of convincing on-camera
cameraderie.  As the potential spoilers to a Jonathan-Sara pairing, John Corbett
and Bridget Moynahan are also appealing, albeit in different ways.  Moynahan's
Hallie isn't so much ill-suited for Jonathan than simply not as an ideal a match
as Sara; Corbett's eccentric, egocentric new age musician Lars is harder to
like, but his charisma makes Sara's attraction to him understandable.
        Such sharp casting and performances is a testament to the wonderful
directing job by Chelsom.  From the first frames he sets up the right atmosphere
of fairy tale romance; contributing mightily to that is John de Borman's
cinematography, which captures all the visual splendor of winter in the Big
Apple (a sight that is even more powerful and magical in light of recent
events).  More importantly, however, Chelsom found the right rhythm for this
story, and the film comes in at an efficient sub-90-minute run time.  There
isn't a wasted moment, and as such _Serendipity_ leaves one with a pleasant
feeling few films generate: that of wanting more.

Title
Review for Next Best Thing, The (2000)
_The_Next_Best_Thing_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
Best friends may make the best mistakes, but Madonna makes the absolute
worst, at least in terms of her film career, which has been a comedy of
errors or a horrible tragedy, depending on how one looks at it.  After
the surprisingly impressive anomaly that was _Evita_ (which won her a
Golden Globe), the pop music diva is back to her infamously poor projects
and even poorer performances with _The_Next_Best_Thing_--which, as the
title states, is not the best, but it's hardly that close to it.  In
fact, this awful mess is more like the absolute worst.
One can understand Madonna and co-star Rupert Everett's decision to make
this film.  The two are longtime friends, and it gives them an
opportunity to work together in roles that are "like" themselves--or,
rather, how _they'd_like_ to see themselves: a witty everyman (Everett)
who just happens to be openly gay, and--more notably--a "normal" woman
(Madonna).  But, as her nearly two-decade-long stint in the spotlight has
shown, being "normal" is hardly natural for Madonna.  What is natural to
her, it seems, is that strange British-or-whatever accent this Detroit
native has adopted in recent years.  And that affected speech pattern
always gets in the way; while she does have a few uncharacteristically
relaxed moments (perhaps due to her ease with Everett), the funky accent
eventually creeps in and ruins it.
Then again, with one big exception, Madonna's voice has always been
grating in her screen efforts, long before she fancied herself a
foreigner.  That exception, of course, is in the entirely sung-through
_Evita_, and that's no coincidence.  Singing is something that she is
clearly comfortable with and--crucially--confident in doing, and that's
what made the difference in her justly-lauded performance.  It was not so
much the indisputable fact that she's a much better vocalist than
thespian, but that she was considerably calmer and thus more natural, not
trying so hard to prove her "acting ability."  Without a musical crutch,
however, she overcompensates--as she again does in _The_Next_Best_Thing_.
It must be said that there's so much deficiency in the film that one can
almost understand the need to make up for it with overkill.  In
_Next_Best_, Madonna's Abbie and Everett's Robert--two
generically-written characters--are best friends living in L.A.  Coming
off of a nasty breakup (hers) and the death of a close friend (his), the
two drown their sorrows one night and end up doing the dirty deed.  She
gets pregnant, and the two decide to raise the child (a son, named Sam)
together.  Light stuff, all done with a light touch, but so light as to
make one wonder if director John Schlesinger was ever in the room when
the film was shot.  Madonna is always clueless as an actress, so it's no
surprise that her formless, flavorless portrayal of Abbie cries out for
guidance.  The big shock is how bad the usually reliable Everett is.  His
ability to toss off bon mots is less smooth as smug, often peppered with
some ill-advised mugging and other sorts of physical gags.  The biggest
botch of all, though, is Schlesinger's, with the centerpiece night: while
the aim is not to be romantic, there should be at least some sense of
warmth and affection; these are, after all, best friends.  But there's no
tenderness, just some would-be funny instances of furniture being broken
(ha ha), glimpses of the two doing drunken dance steps, and closeups of
liquor being poured into goblets.
_Next_Best_ would be bad enough as a comedy; once the film flashes
forward six years, tired cute kid humor is added into the mix.  Yet for
some reason screenwriter Thomas Ropelewski, who doesn't come close to
meeting his modest initial goals, decides to aim even higher.  Abbie
meets and falls for a New York-based businessman (Benjamin Bratt,
boring), and then the film takes the left-field turn into a heavyhanded
custody battle drama.  As feared, this shift brings out the worst in
Madonna, who cannot hold her own with Everett, who is indeed a capable
dramatic actor.  But she's not the only one at a loss as to what to
do--so are Ropelewski and Schlesinger, who open up a can of worms and
then just toss it aside.  Many films use text cards to divulge the fate
of their characters, but I have never seen a film rest its entire
resolution on them.  The film fades out, with no sense of closure--or
even a sense of things coming together for a close--then states in print
how it all turns out.  What the hell?
There other flubs in _The_Next_Best_Thing_ (such as a line where Robert
mentions it's the 21st Century in a scene that, in the film's time frame,
should be set around 1993; or the fact that Robert's sole love interest,
a cardiologist, has no name and is rather comically listed in the closing
credits as "Cardiologist"), but to go over them would be as pointless an
exercise as the entire film is.  One should just not make a flub oneself,
and avoid this _Thing_.

Title
Review for Mulan (1998)
Although it undoubtedly upset Disney executives, the disappointing
domestic box office performance of last year's _Hercules_ was probably the
best thing to happen to the Mouse's animation house.  While it was a light,
expertly crafted, and highly enjoyable trifle, it was just that, a trifle,
lacking the gravity that was a crucial ingredient of the studio's biggest
financial (_The_Lion_King_) and artistic (_Beauty_and_the_Beast_,
_The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_) successes.  Seemingly galvanized by that
humbling wakeup call, Disney's tried-and-true blend of populist instincts
and weightier interests is back in full force and top form in _Mulan_.
In its current animation renaissance, Disney has proven to be better
suited to handling female protagonists (Belle, Ariel, Pocahontas) than male
ones (Aladdin and Hercules were varying degrees of milquetoast), and the
title character of Fa Mulan (spoken by Ming-Na Wen, sung by Lea Salonga) is
no exception.  Crippled in their ongoing war with the Huns, the shorthanded
Imperial Chinese army requires that one male from each family join the
military cause.  The only male in the Fa family is Mulan's father (Soon-Tek
Oh), and, despite his advanced age and bad leg, he valiantly agrees to
enlist.  Determined to save her father from what is certain death and
maintain honor in the family, Mulan, in a sequence of stunning visual and
emotional power, cuts her hair, dons battle armor, and joins the army with
her father's summons as the male Ping.
Although all of Disney's recent heroines have been strong feminist role
models, none have been quite as proactive as Mulan.  As can be expected,
she initially cannot keep up with the guys in basic training, but she
manages to make her every man's equal, if not superior, through her sheer
will and determination.  Mulan's transformation is highly reminiscent of
Demi Moore's in last year's Disney drama _G.I._Jane_, but _Mulan_ oneups
that film's hour-long toughening process by efficiently covering the same
ground during a single, rousing musical number, "I'll Make a Man Out of
You," sung by army captain Shang (spoken by B.D. Wong, sung by, yes, Donny
Osmond).  _Mulan_ also out-G.I.'s _Jane_ by having its heroine rely mostly
on wits, rather than brawn, in combat; while she has a high kick that
rivals the best of them, it's her quick-thinking brain that proves to be
most formidable.
The main thrust of the story sounds rather serious, but this is a Disney
film, after all, and it would not be complete without the requisite comic
relief, here in the form of the scrawny dragon Mushu (Eddie Murphy), who is
Mulan's self-appointed guardian.  A hilarious, jive-talking Murphy would
appear to be an out of place in this largely earnest tale, but Mushu is
more seamlessly integrated into the story than the seemingly grafted-on
comic relief in the two most serious Disney efforts, _Hunchback_ and
_Pocahontas_.  _Hunchback_  and _Pocahontas_ could have lost the sore-thumb
gargoyles and cute, mute Meeko the raccoon, respectively, without any major
loss to the film as a whole; however, the presence of Mushu, while still an
obvious concession to the masses, never feels gratuitous, and his funny
presence would be sorely missed.
Disney animated features have a rich musical tradition, and the downward
slide hinted at in _Hercules_ continues in _Mulan_.  _Mulan_ is the first
recent Disney animated effort that I feel could have easily survived
_without_ the songs, even if they are kept to a paltry (for Disney
standards) four.  Only two of the tunes by composer Matthew Wilder (yes, he
of "Break My Stride" fame) and _Hercules_ lyricist David Zippel, the lovely
if very short "Reflection," Mulan's de rigueur "I Want" song; and the
aforementioned "I'll Make a Man Out of You" serve a recognizable dramatic
purpose.  Nonetheless, Wilder deserves kudos for injecting some Oriental
flavor into the songs--for the most part, anyway (only "I'll Make a Man..."
sounds distinctly Western); but Zippel's lyrics are simply serviceable.
Picking up the slack is score composer Jerry Goldsmith, who gives _Mulan_
an appropriate epic sweep, most memorably in the haunting cue that
accompanies Mulan's fateful decision early in the film.
While the ears may be disappointed by _Mulan_, the eyes will be more than
satisfied.  Under the sure hands of directors Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft
and art director Ric Sluiter, _Mulan_'s look has a texture uncommon to most
animated features.  Backgrounds are kept fairly simple, and the screen is
often awash with scarlets and lavenders, creating a surreal yet emotionally
true visual landscape.  There's a general softness to the art, which fits
nicely the Eastern art tradition and lends the film a distinct identity and
personality.
I would not consider _Mulan_ to be in the upper echelon of Disney animated
features occupied by _Beauty_ and the highly underappreciated _Hunchback_,
but it ably upholds the Disney tradition of excellence.  Inspiring,
touching, serious, yet fun, _Mulan_ is animated entertainment of the
highest order, putting half-hearted efforts like Warner Bros.'s recent
_Quest_for_Camelot_ to shame.

Title
Review for Cool, Dry Place, A (1998)
_A_Cool,_Dry_Place_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
_Cool_: Vince Vaughn, whose charisma is at full, effective force as Russ
Durrell, a lawyer who moves to a small Kansas town with his young son
Calvin (Bobby Moat) after being fired from his big-time Chicago firm.  The
casting of the slick Vaughn as a caring single dad is a stretch, but it's
one he pulls off quite well, unlike his recent strained effort as
_Psycho_'s Norman Bates.  As written, Russ is a good parent, and Vaughn's
surprising warmth with Moat is convincing.  But he's not a perfect parent,
and Vaughn works in more comfortable territory in brining to clear life
Russ's rougher, darker edges, such as a quick temper.
_Dry_: The movie itself.  Despite some solid acting by Vaughn, Monica
Potter, and Joey Lauren Adams, there is no escaping the movie-of-the-week
trappings of Matthew McDuffie's script (based on Michael Grant Jaffe's
novel _Dance_Real_Slow_, which, if it bears any resemblance to the film, is
aptly named): Russ's romance with local woman Beth (Adams) and bond with
Calvin is threatened by both the reappearance of his estranged wife Kate
(Potter) and his hotshot career aspirations.  The film ends in exactly the
manner one would expect, with John N. Smith's lethargic direction doing
nothing in the way of generating suspense.  It's hardly surprising that Fox
literally snuck this one into theatres with no press screenings and
virtually no promotion; the film was made with equally as much energy, or
lack thereof.

Review for Julien Donkey-Boy (1999)
_julien_donkey-boy_ (R) no stars (out of ****)
In February, I said that no film this year could possibly be worse than
the thoroughly unwatchable _Six_Ways_to_Sunday_.  Well, I take that back.
 The sophomore directorial effort of Harmony Korine (whose 1997 debut,
_Gummo_, is the epitome of love-hate films) is one steaming, smelly pile
of cinematic excrement.  Much has been made that this "film" (using that
term very loosely) is the first American production to be made under
Dogme 95--the commandments of cinematic "purity" created by Danish
filmmakers Lars Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, among others-- but
slapping on such a label doesn't excuse Korine's sloppy, downright
incoherent filmmaking.  You know you're in trouble when the synopsis
provided in the film's press notes in no way resembles what you see on
screen.  Purportedly, the film is about the "internal struggle" of
schizophrenic julien (Ewen Bremner), which "increases in intensity until
the film's shocking and bizarrely transcendent conclusion."
Now, this is what I saw for 94 long, seemingly endless minutes: scenes
of Bremner jumping up and down and speaking incoherently; scenes of
julien's pregnant sister Pearl (Chloë Sevigny) dancing ballet and playing
the harp; wordless scenes of a young blind figure skater (Chrissy
Kobylak) doing a routine; and, most memorably, julien's father (Werner
Herzog) hosing down and belittling julien's brother Chris (Evan Neumann)
into becoming "a champion"--that is, whenever not chugging cough syrup
and listening to records while wearing a gas mask.  To say that none of
it adds up would be to imply a natural connection between scenes that
isn't there.  The herky-jerky Dogme camera movements and grainy film
stock just makes the film look more like--and thereby confirm--what it
is: pure garbage.

Review for Thursday (1998)
In a recent article for the _Chicago_Sun-Times_, Roger Ebert commented,
"It's pretty hard to offend me, but a film named _Thursday_ crossed the
line at the Toronto Film Festival earlier this month. Watching it, I felt
outrage. I saw a movie so reprehensible I couldn't rationalize it using the
standard critical language about style, genre or irony. The people
associated with it should be ashamed of themselves."
I echo Ebert's sentiments, but from a different angle.  There is a lot of
violence, sex, and various other forms of bad behavior on display in first
time writer-director Skip Woods's low-budget thriller.  But the graphic
nature of _Thursday_ is not what upset me; it was the content behind the
mayhem--or, rather, the lack thereof.  There's absolutely no substance to
Woods's script beyond the setup: a "reformed" ex-drug dealer (Thomas Jane)
who has his quiet Houston household violently thrown upside down after his
still-in-the-biz ex-partner (Aaron Eckhart, who should have known better)
arrives for a stay.  What follows are random, plotless acts of violence and
nastiness, such as various bloody shooting deaths; grisly body disposals;
and, most notoriously, an Amazonian femme fatale (Paulina Porizkova)
wearing a jacket reading "CUNT" who openly masturbates and later rapes the
main character.  This criticism may sound hypocritical from someone who
completely bought into the sick sensibility of _Very_Bad_Things_, but there
writer-director Peter Berg had an actual story to work with, and the
borderline offensive shocks naturally emerged from that narrative.  Woods,
on the other hand, hails from the school of film that believes that shock
value in and of itself equals hipness.  In actuality, it only equates to
pathetic desperation.

Title
Review for Rainmaker, The (1997)
John Grisham's The Rainmaker (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
Good Will Hunting (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Every year, Hollywood crowns a new "it boy"--a young actor pegged for
major movie stardom.  Inheriting the mantle from last year's "winner,"
Matthew McConaughey, is Matt Damon, and, like McConaughey, he proves to be
more than just a fresh young face, as evidenced in two radically different
projects currently in release--John Grisham's The Rainmaker and Good Will
Hunting.
Damon has his first major starring role, a la McConaughey, in a John
Grisham adaptation--in this case, Francis Ford Coppola's take on The
Rainmaker.  Damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney Rudy Baylor, who,
immediately after passing the bar exam, finds himself representing the
mother (Mary Kay Place) of a terminally ill young man (John Whitworth) in a
big-league suit against a negligent insurance company.  While Rudy's (and
the film's) main concern is this case, he also finds time to protect a
young wife (Claire Danes) from her abusive husband (Melrose Placer Andrew
Shue, in a mercifully brief role).
Written for the screen and directed by Coppola, The Rainmaker is the best
Grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously.
Coppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true
Grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself, which largely comes in
the presence of Danny DeVito (as Rudy's unlicensed co-counsel) and Golden
Globe nominee Jon Voight (as the insurance company's hotshot attorney).
The inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous, but
Danes is as superb as always.  Then, of course, there is Damon, who nicely
juggles the weighty (the insurance case, the spousal abuse) and the
humorous (Rudy's often comical naivete) requirements of his role without
missing a beat.
As good as he is in The Rainmaker, Damon showcases the depth of his talent
in Good Will Hunting, directed by Gus Van Sant and written by actor Ben
Affleck and Damon himself.  Damon plays the title character, Will Hunting,
a troubled young construction worker/janitor at MIT who also happens to be
a supergenius.  In an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the
right direction, an MIT math professor (Stellan Skarsgard) taps his old
college friend, community college psychologist Sean McGuire (Robin
Williams), to counsel the abrasive, standoffish Will and try to help him
come to terms with his turbulent life.
Good Will Hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis
suggests, but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true
emotional chords Affleck and Damon's intelligent script touches.  Even
though no one (and, if so, _very_ few people) can directly relate to Will's
burden of superhuman intelligence, the insecurities he suffers are
universal.  The material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of
actors.  Williams delivers a nice dramatic turn; Affleck, a hot
up-and-coming actor himself (Chasing Amy), turns up in a warm and charming
performance as Will's best friend; and the ever-appealing Minnie Driver
shines as Will's Harvard-schooled love interest.  The clear standout in the
cast, though, is Damon, who bravely does not soften Will's prickly nature
but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care
for him.
So many names come and go with the fluctuations of the Hollywood hype
machine, but based on his impressive work in John Grisham's The Rainmaker
and especially Good Will Hunting, it is a safe bet that Matt Damon is one
name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come.

Title
Review for Babe: Pig in the City (1998)
I can understand Universal's desire to make a sequel to its 1995 surprise
box office and Oscar sensation.  I can understand director George Miller's
(who served as producer on the original) desire to have the titular perky
porker to grow up a bit.  But there's something about this film I cannot
understand: did this follow-up to a beloved family film really need to be
this dark?  (And how the hell did it snag a G rating?)
_Pig_in_the_City_, as its title suggests, brings the sheepherding pig to
an unnamed metropolis (inventively designed as an amalgam of New York,
Sydney, Paris, San Francisco, among many others) to save the farm after
inadvertently causing his beloved master, Arthur Hoggett (James Cromwell)
to suffer a crippling accident.  As upsetting as the sight of some heavy
machinery falling on the gentle farmer is, it's not quite as upsetting as a
ridiculously drawn-out scene of a dog's near-drowning, not to mention an
already-crippled dog being thrown from a speeding car, his spirit then
briefly seen frolicking in a canine heaven.   The children in the audience
with which I saw the film were audibly upset, as were some parents, and I
cannot blame them.
What nearly redeems the film is the enduring charm of the pig, this time
voiced by E.G. Daily (taking over for Christine Cavanaugh); the imaginative
production design; and the impressive effects work.  As in the original, it
is impossible to distinguish the real animals from the animatronic ones to
the computer animated ones.  And as in the original, everything _does_ work
out nicely for the pig, who learns a lesson or two about life.  But walking
out of this _Babe_, I--and I am sure many others--feel that Universal
should have left well enough alone, heeding the immortal closing words of
Farmer Hoggett in the original (repeated in this film): "That'll do, Pig."

Title
Review for Training Day (2001)
        _Training_Day_ could not be more aptly titled, and not simply because
those two words offer the most accurate and succinct summation possible of the
film's story and structure.  The title also gives a clear idea of how star
Denzel Washington schools the viewer in how electrifying screen acting can be.
        Director Antoine Fuqua wisely trades in the glossy flash of his previous
two films, _The_Replacement_Killers_ and _Bait_, for more a more realistic,
down-and-dirty approach befitting this dark and gritty story.  _Training_Day_
slavishly sticks to the 24-hour time period of its title, a day in which rookie
LAPD cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is to be shown the ropes of the narcotics
investigation beat by 13-year vet Alonzo Harris (Washington).  The training that
Jake receives goes beyond the expected by-the-book procedures, however.  As the
long day wears on, it becomes an increasingly charged clash of personalities and
ideologies, with the naive Jake learning about the code of street justice in the
hardest possible way from the many difficult situations into which Alonzo places
him--not to mention from the morally ambiguous Alonzo himself.
        The press and advertising for _Training_Day_ have made it clear that
Alonzo is perhaps just as bad, if not worse, than the types he busts every day,
but Washington makes the gradual unpeeling of his character's layers absolutely
riveting.  Washington's natural magnetism as well as any other baggage he brings
with him from previous films actually works wonders for this role.  Much like
how Alonzo's behavior constantly subverts any idealistic notions about law
enforcement officers, Washington's fearless performance continually challenges
any preconceptions of "nobility" one may have associated with the actor; the
viewer is never allowed any comfort as one is made increasingly uncertain of
just how far the character will go.  Alonzo's test of Jake's mettle is
paralleled by the implicit acting challenge Washington's formidable work
presents to Hawke, and like his character, the well-cast Hawke proves up to the
demanding task, at times rather surprisingly so.
        Disappointing it is, then, that David Ayer's script fails to keep up
with the pace of the actors; the story gets too reliant on contrivance and
coincidence to drive its final third.  Effectively summing up _Training_Day_ is
one of the film's more awkward moments, a scene where Alonzo gives a charged
speech in the middle of the night, in the middle of a residential street.  It's
hard not to see the scene as the bit of melodramatic grandstanding that it is,
but that point--and any other issues with the material, for that matter--is made
irrelevant by Washington's volcanic energy and fierce conviction.

Title
Review for Inspector Gadget (1999)
When will Hollywood learn that successful animated concepts just don't
cut it when translated to flesh-and blood life?  That is most certainly
the case with _Dudley_Do-Right_--or, should I say, _Deadly_Do-Wrong_. 
After the inexplicable box office success of the horrible
_George_of_the_Jungle_, it must've seemed like a good idea to have
_George_ star Brendan Fraser tackle another Jay Ward cartoon character,
the bumbling Canadian mountie and sworn enemy of the dastardly Snidley
Whiplash (Alfred Molina).  But if there's any justice in the world, the
fluke financial success of _George_ will not be duplicated, for this
excrutiatingly unfunny test of patience is even worse than that awful
film.  Writer-director Hugh Wilson's (who last teamed with Fraser earlier
this year in _Blast_from_the_Past_) idea of comedy is having Dudley wear
a moose head and get repeatedly hit by his cabin's loose floorboards.  If
you're with Wilson and are sent rolling on the floor by those gags, by
all means, go to the film.  Everyone else would be wise to just watch the
new _Fractured_Fairy_Tale_ animated short that precedes the film... when
the film hits video.
The other live-action cartoon adaptation of the summer,
_Inspector_Gadget_, is indeed better, but only in the sense of what a
severe migraine is to a heavy blow to the head: not as damaging, but
still painful as all hell.  Matthew Broderick plays the cop outfitted
with various mechanical gizmos to defeat the evil Claw (Rupert Everett,
cashing a paycheck) in this effects-laden, fast-paced film.  The problem,
though, is that the film is simply too fast-paced--a loud, hyperactively
acted, directed, and edited exercise in sensory overkill that calls out
for a lethal dose of Ritalin.  That none of the 80 or so minutes in the
film isn't slightly funny doesn't help--it just makes you reach for more
Excedrin.

Title
Review for Drive Me Crazy (1999)
_Drive_Me_Crazy_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
As the press notes are so eager to announce, _Drive_Me_Crazy_ takes its
title from "(You Drive Me) Crazy," the latest hit single by teen pop
phenomenon Britney Spears.  Since Fox went so far out of its way to
retitle the film for the tune (the original name was the more fitting but
Britney-inspiration-lacking _Next_to_You_), I will go through each of
this teen comedy's painfully pedestrian plot paces as it relates to the
song.
"Baby, I'm so into you/You got that something/What can I do?"  In-crowd
high school girl Nicole (Melissa Joan Hart) pines for star basketball
stud Brad (Gabriel Carpenter).  Similarly, her next-door neighbor (hence
the film's original title), outcast bad boy Chase (Adrian Grenier) is so
into his girlfriend Dulcie (Ali Larter).
"Baby, you spin me around/The earth is moving/But I can't feel the
ground."  Brad withdraws his invitation to Nicole to a big dance after he
falls for a cheerleader.  As coincidence would have it, around the same
time, Dulcie gives Chase the heave-ho.  Determined to win back their
respective paramours, Nicole and Chase--now made over into a clean-cut
popular guy--pretend to be a couple in order to incite jealousy in their
exes.
"Every time you look at me/My heart is jumpin'/It's easy to see/You
drive me crazy/I just can't sleep/I'm so excited/I'm in too deep/Oh oh
oh, crazy/But it feels all right/Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all
night."  Of course, Nicole and Chase find that their false attraction has
become real; as the song goes, in one scene, Chase, lost in thought about
Nicole, stays up an entire night.  With this easily foreseen turn of
events comes the major flaw of the screenplay by Rob Thomas.  The way
these mismatched couple movies are supposed to work is that once the
"ugly duckling" is made over, the other person falls for him/her--by
seeing through the slick veneer and taking a liking to his/her "true
self."  In this film, Nicole takes a liking to Chase once he starts
acting like the in-crowd and gradually erases all trace of his original
personality.  So much for not judging a book by its cover.
The film is not helped by Hart's accordingly shallow performance, which
never once convinces that there's anything more to Nicole than her
popular girl image.  Even more ruinous is the complete lack of chemistry
between her and Grenier, and Thomas and director John Schultz come up
with nothing else to hold the audience's attention; certainly not the
routine subplots, including nice guy Dave (Mark Webber)'s cyber romance
and the scheming of Nicole's so-called best-friend Alicia (Susan May
Pratt).  _Drive_Me_Crazy_ feels like another lackluster youth entry into
the new fall TV season, a point driven home by one touch that is amusing
for all the wrong reasons: there are a number of basketball scenes in the
film, and it's hard not to notice that on Brad's team and all the others
they play, every single player is Caucasian.
I was expecting _Drive_Me_Crazy_ to follow the same tactic that
_Dangerous_Minds_ used with its featured hit single, "Gangsta's
Paradise"--that is, milk it to death and then some, exploiting the
theatre's Dolby Digital sound system whenever possible to remind patrons
exactly what brought them into the theatre.  But it didn't; in fact, it
got to the point where I was actually _waiting_ for the song to blare on
the soundtrack.  (For the record, it is played for a brief moment
mid-film and then in its entirety during the end credits--the latter
instance inspiring some teenybopper girls in the audience to sing along
and dance in their seats.)   The fact that I was waiting for a Britney
Spears song to play speaks volumes about how incredibly boring this film
is.

Title
Review for Mighty Joe Young (1998)
_Mighty_Joe_Young_ (PG) ** (out of ****)
Before every movie shown in Greater Los Angeles movie theatres, a
commercial for the _Los_Angeles_Times_ plays.  One such ad from a few
years back featured well-known effects creator Rick Baker and, as the
centerpiece of the spot, one of Baker's creations: a high-tech gorilla
suit about as lifelike as any you'd find in a costume shop.
Watching the update of the 1949 RKO Picture _Mighty_Joe_Young_, I was
often reminded of this spot, and it's not because the titular gorilla was
(coincidentally) designed by Baker.  Much like that ad of years ago, the
intent of _Joe_ is to make the audience marvel at the wonder of Hollywood
special effects--and instead ends up failing miserably.  Years may have
passed, but Baker's gorilla effects are only slightly more convincing,
which means that they are still laughably phony-looking (and, as such,
compulsively watchable for the wrong reasons).
This should spell complete disaster for _Joe_, which is, after all, the
tale of a gentle giant gorilla who yearns to roam free.  But the film's
nearly two-hour running time is given some substance by the
flesh-and-blood actors (who, I must say, deserve better than this film). 
Charlize Theron plays Jill Young, the surrogate mother to the big ape,
and she is able to make the audience feel and understand her affection
for Joe, even if we don't have much for him ourselves.  Bill Paxton gives
a likable, low-key performance as zoologist Gregg O'Hara, who "rescues"
Joe from his poacher-infested home in the African jungle and places him
in a Southern California-based wildlife preserve, where Joe gets antsy.
But the cast nor Ron Underwood's brisk direction can mask the clunkiness
of Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner's script, which has a poacher (Rade
Serbedzija) following Joe to the States to settle a personal score with
the furry guy (Joe bit off the poacher's thumb and index finger years
ago).  As hard-to-swallow as that plot contrivance is, it's nothing
compared to the insulting climax.  I won't spoil it, but never have I
seen such a large group of generous individuals gathered in one place.
Still, the many children in the audience with whom I saw the film oohed
and aahed at all the right moments, completely enthralled by Joe's
destructive--but never overly violent--antics.  The same will probably be
the case in theatres showing _Mighty_Joe_Young_; it is sure to please its
target audience of kids.  It's just that the filmmakers forgot about the
adults who pay to bring that target audience to the multiplex.  Chances
are that they, too, will end up marvelling at how not-so-marvelous those
gorilla effects are.

Title
Review for Major League: Back to the Minors (1998)
Major League: Back to the Minors (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
You know the guy: sometimes bearded, often burly, he always manages to
sit in the seat directly behind you, ever so eager to greet a film's
every slight attempt at humor with a hearty, guttural explosion of
laughter.  You know you're neck-deep into something awful when even
that guy, who reveals his erpetually guffawing self during the
trailers, remains as stonily silent throughout the film as everyone
else in the auditorium.  And Major League: Back to the Minors is truly
something awful.  Horribly written and directed by John Warren, this
third installment of the baseball comedy series is unwatchable drivel.
Aging minor-league pitcher Gus Cantrell (Scott Bakula) is recruited by
old friend and Minnesota Twins owner Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen) to
coach the Twins' struggling farm team, the Buzz, an inept squad that
counts among its ranks a former ballet dancer (ha ha).  As can be
expected, Gus manages to make winners out of these goofballs, leading
to the Buzz's big moment in the sun: an exhibition game against the
major league Twins themselves, in their big-city home field.  Much to
the chagrin of the Twins' slick, self-absorbed manager (Ted McGinley),
the Buzz put on a respectable showing.
End of story.  But wait--only 45 minutes of screen time has passed. So
what does Warren do now? Why, what any desperate, in-over-his-head
hack would do--recycle his script.  After the Buzz's star player (Walt
Goggins) is wooed into the majors, the Buzz once again hits hard
times, and Gus has to prod them back into shape. And he does, leading
to the team's big moment in the sun. You guessed it--an exhibition
game against the Twins, but this time taking place on the Buzz's
backwater home turf.
Going through the same story twice would not have been as big of an
annoyance if Warren's script had simply done its job: be funny.  But
nothing in the film comes close to eliciting the slightest smirk when the
writer's painful idea of witty comic repartée is something like this:
        "This team has a former ballerina?"
        "I don't think they call men ballerinas."
        "A balladeer?"
        "Isn't that a singer?"
        "I think that's a troubadour."
But to merely attack the screenplay on the humor level (though it
deserves a most thorough beating on that basis) is to let Warren off
too easily; he can't even integrate his product plugs with the
slightest trace of subtlety.  Says Bob Uecker, playing the Buzz's
announcer, in reference to something that happened a long time ago:
"That was before Diet Coke became my beverage of choice."  Warren's
direction is every bit as sloppy as his writing; even though the final
game's outcome is never in doubt, there's no attempt--through the
editing, music, anything--any at creating any illusion of suspense.
Contributing to the mess are the actors, who plod along in haphazard
directions as if no helmer were present at all, especially McGinley,
whose over-the-wall-and-out-of-the-ballpark antics worked on
Married... with Children but not here.
I have not seen either of the first two Major Leagues, and I'll give
those films the benefit of the doubt; they could very well hold some
merit. But after sitting through the excrutiating Back to the Minors,
you won't find me rushing to the video stores any time soon.

Title
Review for I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)
I Know What You Did Last Summer (R) *** (out of ****)
After resurrecting and reinventing the teen slasher film for the '90s with
the blockbuster Scream, screenwriter Kevin Williamson keeps the genre alive
with I Know What You Did Last Summer, an effective "scary movie" directed
by Jim Gillespie.
This adaptation of the novel by Lois Duncan begins with a violent accident
that changes the lives of four teenage friends: sensible Julie (Jennifer
Love Hewitt), beauty queen Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), bad boy jock
Barry (Ryan Philippe), and nice guy Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) unwittingly
run over and kill a man crossing a mountain road on the night of July 4.
Instead of facing possible vehicular manslaughter charges--the car seats
are doused with alcohol, thanks to hard-drinking Barry's clumsiness--the
group decide to dump the body and keep that terrible night a secret for the
rest of their lives.  The foursome never see each other again until exactly
one year later, after Julie receives an ominous note which gives the film
its title.
I Know... is a more conventional thriller than Scream, which mined a
mother lode of satire with its lampooning of horror cliches.  Yet while it
does follow a formulaic pattern, Williamson's script does not indulge in
the typical "I'll be right back" norms.  Certain characters are smarter
than others, but most of the time everyone's frontal lobes are in working
order.  Thankfully, though, Williamson does not play everything completely
straight; some arch bits of dialogue provide some good laughs, and Helen's
beauty pageant scenes are hilarious in their dead-on cheesiness.
Williamson does fall short, however, in creating four memorable
characters.  Unlike Scream, which had a number of interesting, distinctive
people on the canvas, here there are only two: blowhard Barry and
especially the narcissistic, hair-obsessed Helen.  Unfortunately, these two
and the boring Ray take a backseat to the dull-as-dishwater Julie, played
with little spark by Hewitt, a pallid stand-in for Neve Campbell.  I
suppose Gillespie wanted to play up the Scream connection by casting
another Party of Five co-star in the lead, but he would have had a better
leading lady in the gifted Gellar, whom I have admired since her pre-Buffy
'93-'95 stint as hellion Kendall Hart on All My Children (which won her a
Daytime Emmy).  Granted, Helen is a flashier role than Julie, but the
seamless manner in which Gellar slides from comical self-absorption to
gut-wrenching fear hints at how much more life and conviction she would
have brought to the lead.
But scares, not acting, is what draws audiences to horror films, and the
Scottish Gillespie, making his American debut, offers heaps of shrieks.  He
delivers a few chilling sequences, in particular the creepy body-dumping
scene and a tense chase-and-evasion set piece involving Helen.  Mind you,
he is no Wes Craven--the climax, set aboard a boat, leaves a lot to be
desired in the suspensewise, but he recovers from that with a killer (yes,
bad pun) ending.  Many films claim to leave the audience screaming; once I
Know What You Did Last Summer makes its final fade out, you may just find
yourself doing so.

Title
Review for Preacher's Wife, The (1996)
The Preacher's Wife (PG) *** (out of ****)
'Tis the season for shopping, gift-giving, and feel-good family
films like The Preacher's Wife, which, despite a major problem (which can be
summed up in two words), gets the uplifting job done.
In Penny Marshall's frothy reworking of 1947's The Bishop's Wife,
Denzel Washington plays Dudley, an angel sent down from Heaven to help
Reverend Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance), who is doubting his ability to
make a difference to the community and his family--wife Julia (Whitney
Houston) and son Jeremiah (Justin Pierre Edmund).  Dudley does his best to
restore the reverend's faith in himself, but along the way he cannot help
but be sidetracked by what earth has to offer, including the neglected Julia
and Jeremiah, who savor the attention he, and not Henry, gives them.
It's good to see the gifted Washington in a departure from the heavy
dramatic roles he's made his name in, and he has a ball as the funloving and
well-meaning Dudley; the fact that he does so well in a lighthearted role is
just a testament to his  remarkable talent.  Vance is likely to go
underappreciated for his subtle performance; he manages to make the audience
care without resorting to showy theatrics.  Perhaps the most memorable turns
come from a trio of supporting players.  Loretta Devine has a few choice
moments of neurosis as Henry's put-upon secretary;  the hilarious Jenifer
Lewis all but steals the show as Julia's sassy mother; and Edmund is a
natural charmer as Jeremiah.  He's bound to leave audiences going "aw" all
through the movie as he did with the preview audience I was in.
To her credit, Houston gives her least annoying performance to date.
In a wise move, Marshall and screenwriters Nat Mauldin and Allan Scott have
her break into spirited gospel numbers whenever the story allows it, and it
is during these moments that she truly comes to life, showing an infectious
energy like never before on the big screen.  But when the music dies down,
so does her performance.  As an actress, Houston is the blandest of the
bland.  She can't make a line sound natural to save her life; every word
that comes out of her mouth sounds scripted.  She is also an oddly chilly,
distant, self-involved presence; she does not have a convincing maternal
rapport with Edmund, let alone any romantic sparks with Vance or Washington.
It's as if she's acting in a box apart from everyone else.  As a result, the
emotional involvement in Henry and Julia's relationship--the center of the
story--is weakened.  We want Henry to get his life together and make his
family happy because he, Jeremiah, and Dudley want it; the fact that Julia
is involved at all is of little consequence.
But the aim of The Preacher's Wife is to make the audience walk out
of the auditorium with smiles on their faces and their spirits lifted, and I
cannot imagine anyone not giving in at least in part to its charms--of which
there are many.  It is a fun, feel-good family film that actually does leave
you feeling good.

Title
Review for Broadway Damage (1997)
Aspiring Broadway composer Robert (Aaron Williams) secretly carries a
torch for his best friend, struggling actor Marc (Michael Shawn Lucas).
The problem is, Marc only has eyes for "perfect 10s," which the geeky,
insecure Robert certainly is not.  Meanwhile, Marc's spoiled (hetero)
female roommate, Cynthia (Mara Hobel), spends her days lying about their
apartment and harrassing magazine editor Tina Brown.
Writer-director Victor Mignatti's "very romantic comedy" (as the ad
campaign states) is supposed to be (pardon the pun) a gay ol' romp, but
it's hard to have much fun with these annoying, self-absorbed characters
and their shallow personal problems: Marc and Cynthia have sitcom-level
domestic "crises" (such as trying to kill bugs--how hilarious); Robert and
Marc go to acting class (how riveting); the zaftig Cynthia goes on eating
binges (how original).  But more than anything else, the three whine.
Constantly.  Marc whines about his turbulent romance with an apparent "10,"
David (Hugh Panaro), the hunky musician from across the way; Robert whines
about not being able to find the right guy; Cynthia whines about having to
find a job (horrors).  The terrible trio whine their way to a happy ending
that is wholly undeserved.  Add in overly broad performances and some
laughable lipsynching by Panaro, and you're left with one astonishing piece
of cinematic damage.

Title
Review for Civil Action, A (1998)
_A_Civil_Action_ (PG-13) ** (out of ****)
Every December there emerges a film touted as a major award contender
only to come up short.  Last year, it was Steven Spielberg's overrated
_Amistad_; this year, it's Steven Zaillian's _A_Civil_Action_, which,
like the former film, is a technically proficient but ultimately soulless
courtroom drama.
_A_Civil_Action_, based on Jonathan Harr's fact-based book, marks the
directorial debut of Academy Award-winning screenwriter Zaillian (who
also wrote and executive produced), and he displays an effectively
economical storytelling style.  This is best exemplified in a sequence
where Boston personal injury lawyer Jan Schlichtmann (John Travolta)
meets up with Albert Eustis (Sydney Pollack), a pompous executive with
the corporation of W.R. Grace & Co., and recounts the encounter to his
legal partners.  Instead of showing the encounter and then Jan's account
of it, they unfold simultaneously through intercutting, with certain
behaviors and statements underscored by Jan's after-the-fact commentary. 
Another example has Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall, a Golden Globe nominee
for his work here), attorney to the large Beatrice Foods corporation,
lecturing a class on trial procedure, and each of the  bullet points he
makes are followed by concrete illustration in the courtroom.
The technical proficiency extends to Travolta, who hits the right
dramatic notes as Jan, a hotshot attorney who sees dollar signs in
representing a group of Woburn, Massachusetts parents in a complaint
against Grace and Beatrice.  These eight families claim that the two
corporations contaminated the town's drinking water, which led to their
children's deaths from leukemia.  But somewhere along the way, Jan
becomes emotionally involved, making his own dollar signs disappear as
the impossible case drains his firm's funds but not the energy of his
crusade.  The problem is that I never got a true sense of that change. 
The turning point is supposed to be a scene where Jan is driven to tears
while thinking about one of the father's stories, but I did not sense any
change following that scene; Jan still seemed like the slickster that he
was, and his fierce determination to see the case through still seemed
motivated by money and not sentiment.
That can be blamed less on Travolta and more on Zaillian, whose film,
like the portrayal of Jan, is slick and collected but lacking an
emotional hook.  Zaillian seems more interested in getting factual
details right than building any real dramatic tension or momentum, and
the film never quite reaches takeoff speed, despite the solid work of the
acting ensemble (especially William H. Macy as the accountant of Jan's
firm).  The film's conclusion would be anticlimactic with or without any
dramatic urgency leading up to it, but without, it's not only flat, it's
a big fizzle.
Perhaps if Zaillian had been less civil and took more action with his
material, _A_Civil_Action_ could have lived up to the award-craving hype.
 But, as it stands, this TV movie with a big screen cast looks to be an
also-ran when the Oscar nominations are announced in February.

Title
Review for A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)
_AI_Artificial_Intelligence_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)
        "His love is real.  But he is not."  It's one of the corniest
taglines in recent memory, but it also well sums up the main debate that
swirls around _AI_Artificial_Intelligence_, Steven Spielberg's fruition
of the late Stanley Kubrick's long-gestating project based on the Brian
Aldiss short story "Supertoys Last All Summer Long."  Is it possible to
empathize with a protagonist who is a machine specifically programmed to
feel that emotion?  Consequently, is his emotion truly "real"?
        These are indeed valid and troubling questions as one watch _AI_,
but as with a number of films fundamentally flawed in design, execution
more than smooths over most of the rough spots--namely Haley Joel
Osment's extraordinary lead turn as David, the "he" of the syrupy
tagline.  In this future world where robots routinely coexist with humans
in their households and in society in general, David stands apart from
all the other "mecha": he is the first to be programmed with the ability
to love.  When Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), whose terminally ill
son with her husband Henry (Sam Robards) lies cryogenically frozen in a
hospital, speaks the code words that activate David's emotional
circuitry, there's no turning back.  David will always love Monica and
crave her love in return forever--long after she may become tired of him,
long after whenever she dies.
        Thus raises that question: how to sympathize with David when his
feelings are as synthetic as the rest of him, turned on with the flip of
a figurative switch?  Just like any machine programmed to do a job, David
is completely focused on his: loving his "mother" no matter what, never
once questioning this pursuit of her reciprocal love.  Such singleminded
obsession has a distancing effect by design, but any detachment is
bridged by Osment.  Look no further than the emotionally brutal scene
where David and Monica part; only a true heart of ice won't be affected
by Osment's wrenching wails for Monica.  But the true genius of his work
are its fine subtleties: the slight but undeniable differences between
pre- and post-"activation" David; the distinctly mechanical mobility of
his body that belies the deep well of feeling in his eyes, which in turn
belies the potential for danger that can be sensed from within him.
        So when _AI_ moves away from the placid confines of the suburban
Swinton home and into the wild and woolly world of such locales as the
neon-drenched, hedonistic urban center known as Rouge City or--in the
film's most stunning sight--a Manhattan that is all but completely
submerged in water, Osment's David remains a captivating companion on an
increasingly strange and surreal journey.  Along the way David and his
loyal "supertoy" sidekick Teddy (a real marvel of top-notch puppetry,
CGI, and voiceover work) hook up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a robot
whose name says all one needs to know about his purpose in the world. 
This character, played with an appropriately oily sexuality by Law, is a
bawdy original, but he's mostly around just to provide David with a hand
to hold.
        Gigolo Joe personifies ("mechanifies"?) the most fascinating and
frustrating quality of _AI_: the tension between the opposing
sensibilities of Spielberg and Kubrick.  At times the mixing and clashing
works, as in the first act, where Spielberg apes Kubrick with alarming
accuracy in the chilly, clinical tone and sterile environments; and it's
hard to imagine the famously cynical Kubrick being able to pull off the
wallop that a proven button-pusher like Spielberg brings to the
aforementioned David/Monica scene.  But as the film progresses, the odd
coupling becomes more problematic.  Gigolo Joe and Rouge City suggest a
Kubrickian naughty streak, but they've been neutered by Spielberg, in the
end rendered less edgy than they could (and should) have been.  And for
all the genuinely powerful moments Spielberg is able to wring, his
weakness for easy sentimentality peeks through at the wrong moments--in
an otherwise harrowing sequence set at a "Flesh Fair" where mecha are
violently destroyed for the entertainment of "orga" (humans);and
especially in the film's most debated-about section, the final 30
minutes.  For some it's a lovely and deeply touching coda; for others
it's Spielberg's desperately heavyhanded and completely gratuitous final
act of emotional extortion.  I fall under the latter camp, for all the
schmaltz--however expertly acted by Osment--comes after what would've
been a far more poetic and appropriate conclusion.
        The ending may leave a sour aftertaste, but there's no
discounting--or forgetting--the sights and sounds that Spielberg and the
spirit o' Stanley bring to the screen along the way.  Cinematographer
Janusz Kaminski, production designer Rick Carter, and effects crews at
the Stan Winston Studio and ILM out do themselves in making these
stunning imaginings of the future a cinematic reality.  But the most
astounding effect of all is not mecha, but orga: Osment's transcendent
performance.  His character may not be real, and neither may his
character's love, but his talent most certainly is.

Title
Review for Everyone Says I Love You (1996)
        Like some stars, some movies can coast by on their charm alone, and
Woody Allen's new musical comedy Everyone Says I Love You is one such
film--a trifle, yes, but a cute and enjoyable one at that.
        The thin plot centers on the various romances within a wealthy
family in New York, as narrated by one DJ (spunky newcomer Natasha Lyonne),
a Columbia University student who falls in love with a new guy just about
every month.  The two most prominent storylines focus on DJ's father (Woody
Allen), an--big surprise--unlucky in love nebbish who woos an unhappily
married younger woman (Julia Roberts, thankfully back in light comedy mode)
with information secretly obtained from her psychotherapy sessions (by DJ,
of course); and DJ's half-sister Skylar (Drew Barrymore), who is betrothed
to the nice Holden (Edward Norton) yet later falls for a rugged,
not-so-rehabilitated ex-con (Tim Roth, who all but steals the show)--with
hilarious results.  There are other minor subplots floating around, such as
DJ's two other half-sisters (Natalie Portman and Gaby Hoffmann) battling
over the same boy, but these plotlines aren't fleshed out as satisfactorily
or as memorably as the main two plots.
        The film is, at its heart, an affectionate tribute to old Hollywood
musicals, and this is reflected in the songs, all of which are old pop and
showtunes for the '30s and '40s.  While the songs add to the old fashioned
atmosphere, the fact that they weren't written expressly for the film means
that they don't always advance the story; a lot of times it stops it dead in
its tracks, especially the elaborate, over-the-top production numbers, which
simultaneously celebrate and skewer the genre's surreal conventions.  As for
the singing, most of the cast--from Norton and Alan Alda (as DJ's
stepfather) to Sleepers's Billy Crudup (as one of DJ's paramours) and a
startlingly better-than-most Roth--does an adequate job, with a few
exceptions.  Surprisingly, there is only one truly horrific singer: Roberts,
who brings new meaning to the term tone-deaf.  Allen himself is by no means
OK, but he sort of talk-sings his song, which makes his warbling less
offensive.  The major standout is the vocally talented Goldie Hawn, who
plays DJ's mother and Allen's ex-wife; her dancing and singing showcase at
the close is by far the film's highlight.  She's the only one who seems like
a true musical star.  Oddly and disappointingly enough, one star actually
cheated when it came to singing--Barrymore, whose vocals are dubbed in by a
ghost singer.  I can't imagine her actual singing voice being any worse than
Roberts's...
        The movie musical is, sadly for this musical fan, pretty much dead,
and I don't see this film (or, for that matter, the forthcoming Evita)
miraculously reviving the genre.  But genre revival isn't the aim of the
film.  Everyone Says I Love You simply sets out to be a fun little charmer,
and it more than accomplishes that modest goal.

Title
Review for Deep Impact (1998)
Before even seeing a single frame of the film, it would be easy to snicker
at Deep Impact, in which a comet on a collision course with Earth threatens
the existence of all life on the planet.  It is the latest entry in this
decade's dubious revival of the '70s disaster film, and the first of two
"the sky is falling" flicks to hit screens this year (the other being this
coming July's Armageddon, in which a meteor is the threat).  Its tagline,
"Oceans Rise.  Cities fall.  Hope survives" is not as cornball as that of
the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller Daylight ("They came in
alone... the only way out... is together"), but it's every bit as treacly.
The opening moments of Deep Impact offer more to snicker at.  The
cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions, such as the
usual opening "roll call," in which all the major characters and their
personal problems are introduced.  The most prominent of the "personal"
stories is that of ambitious TV news reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni), who
is distraught that her father (Maximilian Schell) left her mother (Vanessa
Redgrave) for a younger woman (Rya Kihlstedt).  What is just as
snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between Paramount and DreamWorks SKG
aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration, Microsoft
and NBC's cable news network MSNBC, which employs Jenny, who is the film's
ostensible main character.  In the vision of America presented here, MSNBC
is the television news source of choice in every home, when in reality it
only reaches a fraction of the country.
The initial signs point toward something along the lines of a Volcano or
Dante's Peak, but there's one thing about Deep Impact I underestimated: the
skills of director Mimi Leder.  She won an Emmy for her helming work on
NBC's smash ER, which is essentially a weekly disaster movie, each episode
featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical
crises.  The challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold:
(1) to make the audience care for these guest characters, regardless of how
briefly seen or thinly written they are, and (2) powerfully tug at the
emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic.  Having passed
the "ER challenge" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating
suspense in The Peacemaker, Leder could not be a better fit to bring
Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin's rather formulaic disaster screenplay
to screen.
As the countdown to impact progresses, the ominous feeling of doom is
palpable, leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and
affecting emotional dimension.  There's nothing here that will profoundly
move anyone, but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high
achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects.  Situations
that initially feel contrived, such as Jenny's familial crisis and the
teenage romance between Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski) and comet
discoverer Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood), achieve some poignance; and even
the more vaguely drawn characters, including U.S. President Tom Beck
(Morgan Freeman), astronaut Spurgeon "Fish" Tanner (Robert Duvall), and his
rather faceless crew (Ron Eldard, Jon Favreau, Mary McCormack, Blair
Underwood, and Alexander Baluyev) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft
Messiah, have their share of touching moments.  The latter fact owes a debt
to the actors, who all do a solid job and are well-cast, with the possible
exception of Leoni; she delivers a decent performance, but her trademark
unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to
buy as a star news broadcaster.
Although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work (the
giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular) place Deep Impact in the
same category as the likes of Twister, it is the first of the '90s disaster
films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that
ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact, even if it isn't as deep as
hoped.

Title
Review for Virgin Suicides, The (1999)
_The_Virgin_Suicides_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
To use an exhausted cliché, the whole of _The_Virgin_Suicides_ is far
less than the sum of its parts.  There are a lot of good individual
elements on display in Sofia Coppola's screen adaptation of Jeffrey
Eugenides' novel, yet they never quite gel into something that completely
satisfies--a shortcoming that can be blamed by the film's most
distinctive quality.
With a title like _The_Virgin_Suicides_, the film's outcome is never in
doubt.  The setting is the suburban Midwest sometime in the 1970s, and
the "virgins" in question are the five Lisbon sisters--Lux (Kirsten
Dunst), Therese (Leslie Hayman), Mary (A.J. Cook), Bonnie (Chelse Swain),
and Cecilia (Hanna Hall)--who all take their own lives within the space
of a year.  The exact reasons why is the mystery at the heart of the film
and the point of obsession of three lovestruck boys who live in the
neighborhood, who are most prominently represented by a still-haunted,
unseen adult narrator.
In filmic terms, to label something a "mystery" almost implies the
presence of a clear-cut solution, but there are no real answers given in
_The_Virgin_Suicides_, only questions--a bit ironic, considering its
tell-all title.  The questions, however, appear to be entirely the point.
 The film is supposed to be the shared memory of these boys, and like a
memory faded through time, _The_Virgin_Suicides_ has an ethereal,
dreamlike vagueness.  Not much is ever learned about any of the sisters,
not even the focal Lux, whose adventurous sexuality (she's the exception
to the "virgin" label) leads to a decision by their parents (James Woods
and Kathleen Turner) that plays a part in the girls' destruction.  But
the thinness of their characters is forgivable since they are near-mythic
figures to the boys.
I haven't named any of the boys nor the actors who portray them because
they, too, have virtually no distinct identity individually nor as a
group.  While the dreamlike quality that Coppola gives the film is
largely effective, from the evocative score (by Air) and visual style to
the idealized vision of the Lisbon sisters, extending that to the boys is
a major misstep.  They are the audience's entry vessel into the story,
but it's impossible to connect with them on an emotional (or any other)
level since nothing is ever learned about them.  As such, when the title
event occurs, it's in an emotional vacuum; the audience can't really feel
for the loss of the girls since it never really knew them, and without a
sense of who the boys are and were, it's just as impossible to completely
empathize with or understand their loss.
With the characters intentionally made sketchy, the actors are called on
to shade them in, and Coppola coaxes fine work from them all.  Especially
noteworthy are Woods, both sleazy and charming as the model
airplane-obsessed Lisbon patriarch; Dunst, who strikes the right balance
of innocence and sensuality for Lux; and Josh Hartnett as Trip Fontaine,
the jock stud who takes an interest in Lux.
Much like how strong individual elements add up to a curiously
undernourished whole, the most memorable thing about
_The_Virgin_Suicides_ turns out to be its greatest hindrance: the
atmosphere.  While lending the film an eerie beauty as it unspools, the
relentlessly dreamy mood makes the film similarly weightless. 
_The_Virgin_Suicides_ is indeed an entrancing experience, but there's
nothing solid left to hold onto once it's over.

Title
Review for Fathers' Day (1997)
Fathers' Day (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
Robin Williams and Billy Crystal are both funny men in their own
right, and as such one would expect their first big-screen pairing, Fathers'
Day, to be just as funny, if not funnier, than their solo film efforts.
Alas, the whole is definitely not greater than the sum of its parts, for
Ivan Reitman's family comedy, as amusing as it is, never reaches the
expected heights of hilarity.
The underachievement of Fathers' Day does not have so much to do
with the performers involved than the material.  The film is based on the
1983 French comedy Les Comperes, starring Gerard Depardieu and Pierre
Richard, a blah, often labored farce which I was not terribly impressed with
when I saw it way back in 9th grade French class.  Screenwriters Lowell Ganz
and Babaloo Mandel follow the original fairly closely, but their take on the
story is a bit more successful.   In adapting the first film, they have
duplicated the original knotty premise--two men (Williams and Crystal) are
duped into searching for a former lover's (Nastassja Kinski) runaway son
(Charlie Hofheimer) after she falsely tells both that the child is their
own--while adding some flourishes tailor-made for these two stars.
Williams, stepping in for the bumbling Richard, is a complete nutjob,
suicidal and prone to weeping at the drop of a hat; Crystal, assuming
Depardieu's tough guy part, is more of a dry, sarcastic, no-nonsense type
who just happens to do a mean headbutt.  These modifications in place, the
two settle into their roles quite nicely and put some bite into the
sometimes cloying material.
While the two snugly fit into their individual roles, Williams and
Crystal do not quite catch fire as a team.  There are laughs to be had in
Fathers' Day, but instead of generating from the duo's interaction with each
other--the sign of a good comic team--the big laughs come courtesy from only
one half of the pair: Williams.  Granted, Williams's manic, go-for-broke
comic energy steamrolls everyone and everything around him, and broader
schtick always upstages the more subtle stabs at humor.  But Crystal, so
clearly in his element with this role, is surprisingly unable to hold his
own.  Ganz and Mandel give him a stinging remark to deliver here and there,
but as a whole he is strangely passive.  Just as passive is enormously
gifted Seinfeld Emmy winner Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Crystal's wife.  The
small size of her role would not have been such an annoyance if she were
given a chance to display her vast comic talents, but she is totally wasted
in this thankless, completely straight role.
None of what I say will likely keep Fathers' Day from becoming an
early summer hit.  It has two popular stars; it does have its moments; and
you can take the kiddies.  Those three things may be enough to satisfy most
mainstream moviegoers, but anyone expecting one and one to equal two will be
disappointed--the end result is more like one times one than one plus one.


Title
Review for Little Vampire, The (2000)
_The_Little_Vampire_ (PG) ** (out of ****)
"But it's only a kids' movie."  That's the likely response to any
criticisms leveled at _The_Little_Vampire_, a fantasy-adventure-comedy
that is unmistakably made for the younger set--who, I have no doubt in my
mind, will react positively to the film.  Yes, the movie is clean.  Yes,
the movie will hold the tots' attention.  But should that be ample reason
to subject your children to such a shoddy product?  I don't think so.
Jonathan Lipnicki plays Tony Thompson, who along with his mother (Pamela
Gidley) and father (Tommy Hinkley), has just moved from America to the
Scotland countryside.  Tony's problems fitting in at school are made
worse by his recurring dreams about vampires--the reasons for which
become clear one night when he is visited by Rudolph (Rollo Weeks), the
little vampire of the title.  The two quickly become best friends, and
soon Tony finds himself helping Rudolph and his family--father Frederick
(Richard E. Grant), mother Frida (Alice Krige), sister Anna (Anna
Popplewell), and older brother Gregory (Dean Cook)--locate the missing
piece of an amulet that could grant them their greatest wish: to become
human again.
Sounds all nice and cute, which it probably was in Angela
Sommer-Bodenburg's original novels.  But something has been lost in the
translation.  While the effects, photography, and costuming (though
Rudolph is made to look like a miniature member of the '80s band a-ha)
are decent,  Karey Kirkpatrick and Larry Wilson's script has a fair share
of irritating plot holes (just exactly why is Tony able to have psychic
visions?), and the comic sequences are rendered annoying by director Uli
Edel's (yes, the same Uli Edel who last directed the 1993 Madonna
fuckfest _Body_of_Evidence_) heavy hand.  Case in point: a subplot
involving a weirdo vampire hunter (Jim Carter).
What proves most ruinous, however, are the performances that range from
phoned-in to barely-there.  The central performance falls in the latter
category.  Four years after stealing scenes in the not-for-kids
_Jerry_Maguire_, the now-10-year-old Lipnicki is given his first starring
vehicle with _Vampire_, and the moppet proves far from up to the task. 
Adult actors certainly can't coast by on cuteness alone, and that goes
tenfold for child stars, whose smiles and giggles can get really annoying
really quickly.  The case of the bespectacled Lipnicki is even worse, for
his cuteness factor is rapidly diminishing; now that the size of his body
is about caught up with that of his head, there's nothing distinctively
"cute" about him.  One's left to focus on whatever acting ability is
there, and between his robotic line readings and stone face--which, it
seems, can only be smiling or sullen--one would be hard-pressed to find
any.
One would also have difficulty finding much of anything in
_The_Little_Vampire_ that will appeal beyond the target kid audience. 
For some parents, that will be enough, but shouldn't a so-called "family
film" truly have something of worth to offer to everyone of every age?

Title
Review for City of Angels (1998)
Brad Silberling directed the 1995 live-action version of Casper; Dana
Stevens wrote the 1994 Madeleine Stowe thriller Blink.  Both of those films
are competent entertainments, but it takes something more than mere
competence to successfully pull off a redo of Wim Wenders's 1988 German
classic Wings of Desire.  In translating Wings into the film known as City
of Angels, Silberling and Stevens have turned a fresh, unique cinematic
work into a standard-issue Hollywood romantic fantasy.
Although Wings told the story of Damiel, an angel who decides becomes
human after falling in love with trapeze artist Marion, Wenders was more
interested with the day-to-day work of these celestial beings.  His angels
were unseen, trenchcoated observers of the human race, wandering about,
listening to unsuspecting people's thoughts, but mostly just watching the
earth from above, below, and beyond.  These angels did not perform
miracles, become visible to people in need, or engage in any of the actions
that one typically associates with them; the angels simply watched and took
notes.
In the dismaying opening scene of City of Angels, it becomes clear that
Stevens and Silberling's vision is far more ordinary than Wenders's.  When
we first meet this version's Damiel, Seth (Nicolas Cage), he is on the
job--he's by the side of a dying child to lead her spirit into the great
beyond.  No more simple observation; in this City dwell Americanized angels
that act upon the human world, collect spirits, sometimes shape events, and
somehow make themselves visible to people dying or in despair, such as
surgeon Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan), City's Marion.  Seth falls in love with her
at first sight, and he is further drawn to her after she loses a patient on
the operating table.  One night, without any explanation (reasonable or
otherwise), the distraught Maggie is able to see Seth, and she falls
instantly in love.  All this _before_ Seth makes his big fall into
humanity's ranks.  Long live Hollywood.
Even though Stevens and Silberling maintain a few of Wenders's touches
(the black trenchcoats, the angels' library hangout, the cacophony of human
"thought voices") and touchstone lines (such as "I can't see you, but I
know you're there"), City eventually veers from the source material and
settles into familiar Tinseltown convention.  Observation and
thought-reading, which took up a lot of Wings's running time, falls by the
wayside in favor of a more prominent romance.  Not necessarily a bad move,
but Stevens inexplicably shoehorns the love story into the Meg Ryan
romantic comedy formula.  As usual, Ryan's character has a boring,
barely-exists-as-a-character boyfriend (Colm Feore) from whom the more
exciting love interest (in this case, Seth) must "rescue" her.  Shouldn't
the celestial divide between Seth and Maggie create enough dramatic tension
in itself?   Dennis Franz has the Peter Falk role as an angel-turned-human
(Franz doesn't play himself, however), but unlike the original, Franz's
heavenly past is explicitly spelled out rather than implied, and his
character becomes nothing more than a walking vessel of angelic exposition.
Cage and Ryan turn in admirable performances that are matched by the rest
of the cast, which includes an effective Andre Braugher playing the only
character to survive the translation with his name intact, Seth's angel pal
Cassiel.  But Cage and Ryan's chemistry, while not completely frigid, does
not ignite as it should, making the finale oddly lacking in emotional
punch.  But that is not quite as odd as the general direction of the film's
final act, which is entirely different from that of the original.  In
taking such a radical turn, City goes against the very spirit of its poetic
source material; the true magic and profound inspirational uplift of Wings
is sacrificed in favor of sap and weepy manipulation.  To be fair, on
stand-alone terms, City of Angels is watchable, but even from this
standpoint, it is still just a conventional and only moderately involving
love story wearing angel's wings.

Title
Review for Edtv (1999)
Much like how his character, Ed Pekurny, finds fame as the subject of a
24-hour "reality" cable network, Matthew McConaughey should find his
falling star back on the rise as the lead in _EDtv_, Ron Howard's amiable
goof of a comedy.  McConaughey is a charismatic charmer as Ed, a
Texas-to-San Francisco transplant whose life becomes fodder for the
TV-viewing masses, but unlike Truman Burbank in Peter Weir's
similarly-themed (and far superior) _The_Truman_Show_, Ed is fully aware
of the cameras.  But as with Truman, Ed, while initially intrigued with
the notion of having all eyes on him, comes to yearn for freedom,
especially after it creates strain between and his girlfriend Shari
(Jenna Elfman)--who, as it happens, is the ex of Ed's wilder older
brother Ray (Woody Harrelson).
Howard and screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel don't have the
high satirical aims of _Truman's_ Weir and writer Andrew Niccol; they
simply aim to entertain.  And after a tentative start, _EDtv_ picks up
comedic steam and does just that, amusingly exploring the ramifications
of Ed's sudden, if largely unmerited, celebrity, from opportunistic
groupies (Elizabeth Hurley's sizzling model/aspiring actress) to the
diminished privacy of his colorful family.  Harrelson is predictably
effective as a blowhard, and Elfman (Golden Globe winner for TV's
_Dharma_and_Greg_) shows major promise as a screen star, but the
McConaughey magnetism is so overwheming that the film could easily have
been called _MATTtv_.

Title
Review for Musketeer, The (2001)
_The_Musketeer_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)
        It appears that venerable, time-tested approaches to adventure yarns
just aren't good enough for Hollywood these days.  Coming fresh off the
ready-for-the-WB-network Gen-Y western stylings of _American_Outlaws_ is
_The_Musketeer_, which presents an even more curious take on melding the
traditional with the current cinematic trends: placing Hong Kong-style wirework
choreography in the world of Alexandre Dumas' ageless swashbuckling heroes.  Not
a terrible idea per se, but entrusting a hack like Peter Hyams to pull off such
a risky endeavor is.
        Xin-Xin Xiong, an esteemed HK action veteran who has worked with no less
than Tsui Hark on several occasions, choreographed the high-flying swordfights,
but as captured by Hyams' inept camera, it's difficult to tell if he's done a
noteworthy job.  If there is a wrong angle to shoot from or an ill-advised edit
to make, Hyams goes for it, and the choppy result are a number of incoherently
assembled flips and leaps being passed off as action scenes.  Hyams only figures
out where to place the camera for an elaborately staged duel that takes place on
a number of unsteady, ever-shifting ladders, but this one genuinely interesting
set piece--the only one that allows one to clearly follow the action--also
happens to be the film's last.
        But there are plenty of other problems plaguing _The_Musketeer_.  The
title character is young D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers), who has two goals in
life: to follow in his father's footsteps and join the King's royal fighting
force; but most of all to seek out the man who killed his parents 14 years
prior: Febre (Tim Roth, appropriately camping it up), a ruthless enforcer to the
scheming Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea, sleepwalking).  That the film is
called _The_Musketeer_ rather than _The_Three_Musketeers_ is no accident;
actually, a more appropriate title would've been _The_Super-Musketeer_, for this
version of D'Artagnan is downright invincible, able to defeat any number of
opponents with his gravity-defying derring-do.  Such a heavy-handed approach is
made even more ridiculous by the charisma vacuum known as Chambers, who lacks
the forceful presence to make an engaging hero, let alone a convincing
superhero.
        However, it's doubtful any lead could have made the awful script by Gene
Quintano (who previously worked with Hyams on the Van Damme vehicle
_Sudden_Death_) any more tolerable.  The primary revenge plot is a bore, which
is still better than can be said about D'Artagnan's soggy romance with a
chambermaid (a very out-of-place Mena Suvari); that thread is memorable for all
the wrong reasons, in particular some forced and downright embarrassing sexual
innuendo.  Too bad Quintano didn't heed a line he gave the Suvari
character--"Sometimes it's better to say nothing"--for the dialogue as a whole
is atrocious, especially the clanging one-liners that pop up at the most
inappropriate moments.  Take this gem during what's supposed to be the "tense"
climax: "I'm not dead, so why don't you hurry up and kill him already?"  While
enduring the ordeal that is _The_Musketeer_, you may find yourself asking the
person next to you--that is, if there is anyone else in the auditorium--"I'm not
dead, so why don't you hurry up and kill _me_ already?"

Title
Review for Relic, The (1997)
The year is barely a week old, and there is already a candidate for
the worst of 1997--The Relic, a would-be chiller that's more successful at
making the audience laugh than scream.
In this ridiculous film from uberhack Peter Hyams (whose last two
pictures were dreadful Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicles), a creature that
feeds on the hypothalamuses (hypothalamii?) of humans and animals goes on a
killing spree in a Chicago museum.  How did this creature come into
existence, and why does it feed on hormones?  The "scientific" explanation
cooked up by the four--yes, four--credited screenwriters (Amy Holden Jones,
John Raffo, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver) takes "suspension of disbelief"
to new heights, even by monster movie standards.  But as cockamamie as the
science is in the film, it isn't quite as hard to swallow as the casting of
the clueless Penelope Ann Miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who
specializes in evolutionary genetics.  Miller acts as if she wants an Oscar
nomination, turning every scene that requires the slightest display of
emotion into an overblown Oscar clip, complete with piercing wails and
glycerine tears.  Give it up, Penelope--it's a _monster_movie_.  On the flip
side, Tom Sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant,
but his role is so thankless that it's hard to imagine it being played any
more effectively.
 It's quite funny to see a film indulge, with the straightest of
faces, in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that Wes Craven lampooned so
well (and so recently) in Scream.  For example, in one early scene, a museum
security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night.  OK, we all know
what's coming, but as if we didn't need any more confirmation, he pulls out
a joint and starts puffing away.  Everyone knows what happens to people who
do drugs in a scary movie.  And later, Miller frantically runs out of a
museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing.  Does she
make a beeline for the front door?  Of course not--she runs into the ladies
room and cowers in a stall.  With all the cliches, it is only fitting the
film's climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film:
that of someone outrunning a fireball.
If The Relic is truly "the next evolution in terror" as the poster
states, then the horror film--and humanity--is in even worse shape than we
thought.

Title
Review for Polish Wedding (1998)
Polish Wedding (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)
In this year's summer movie preview issue of _Entertainment_Weekly_,
Theresa Connelly described her writing-directing debut, _Polish_Wedding_,
as "a child that did not quite become the child I thought it would."  One
wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film, a
comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements.
The family at the center of _Polish_Wedding_ is the Pzoniaks, which
consists of mother Jadzia (Lena Olin), father Bolek (Gabriel Byrne), sole
daughter Hala (Claire Danes) and four sons of varying degrees of
facelessness.  It's a large family, but there's not a sympathetic one in
the whole bunch, certainly not in the primary trio.  Jadzia takes pride in
building and maintaining a home and family, but she's kind of a hypocrite
since she's carrying on an affair with a businessman Rade Serbedzija).  Her
excuse for her affair is neglect from Bolek, who is such a passive wimp
that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration.  Also, how could
he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy, sexy Jadzia?  Hala is a
spoiled, self-centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual
experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy.
With such an unappealing set of characters, it's no surprise that
_Polish_Wedding_'s plot complications are far from involving.  Naturally,
Jadzia and Bolek would like Hala to marry the young cop, Russell Schuster
(Adam Trese), who fathered the child, but he refuses to make such a
commitment.  Ho-hum.  Another complication, involving the decidedly
un-virginal Hala being selected to crown a statue of the Virgin Mary, is
first played for laughs and then, inexplicably, as a Profound Statement in
the film's climax--which, ironically, is funnier than any of the film's
lame attempts at humor, such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where
Jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up Russell.
That scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by Connelly.  The
Jadzia-Bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to
sitcom viewers.  The Hala-Russell conflict isn't resolved in as contrived a
manner, but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they
had missed something.  And then there's some atrocious dialogue, which I am
sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound: "Look at all these
pickles.  Just looking at them gives me such great sadness."
As misguided as _Polish_Wedding_ is, the affair is something of a letdown,
considering the strong performances by Byrne, Danes, and especially the
fiery Olin.  They obviously believed in Connelly and her material--a faith
that audiences will be hard-pressed to share.

Title
Review for Demoiselles de Rochefort, Les (1967)
_The_Young_Girls_of_Rochefort_(Les_Demoiselles_de_Rochefort)_ (G) *** (out
of ****)
Director Jacques Demy and composer Michel Legrand's 1967 musical follow-up
to their classic 1964 jazz opera _The_Umbrellas_of_Cherbourg_ is by no
means the masterpiece that film was, but it is not without its frothy
charms.  Catherine Deneuve, who also starred in _Umbrellas_, and her
real-life sister, Francoise Dorleac, respectively play fraternal twin
sisters Delphine and Solange Garnier.  Delphine is a dancer; Solange is a
composer, and both have dreams that stretch beyond the boundaries of their
small hometown of Rochefort--first and foremost being finding true love.
Little do they know that their perfect matches are also wandering the local
streets: poet/artist/sailor Maxence (Jacques Perrin) and American composer
Andy Miller (Gene Kelly), respectively.  Delphine and Solange's mother
(Danielle Darrieux) also pines for a true love--a lost one--who, yes, also
happens to be in town: music shop owner Simon Dame (Michel Piccoli).  These
six characters constantly run into each other, but, of course, each just as
constantly misses his or her match.
Although much of _Rochefort_'s creative team, from the director, composer,
and lead actress to many of the dubbed-in singing voices are the same as
those of _Umbrellas_, the two films could not be more different.  While
_Umbrellas_ was entirely sung but without a single dance number,
_Rochefort_ is a more traditional musical, with spoken interludes between
lavish production numbers and wall-to-wall dancing.  But the most crucial
difference is the tone; where the heartbreaking _Umbrellas_ was tragically
bittersweet, _Rochefort_ is unremittingly sunny, which fits the light
storyline.  However, all the lightness makes this film, unlike the
emotionally sweeping _Umbrellas_, a completely disposable entertainment.
Nonetheless, _Rochefort_, while an overlong 125 minutes, is a delightful
confection, made all the sweeter by Legrand's jazzy, toe-tapping score,
Bernard Evein's candy-colored production design, and the energetic cast.

Title
Review for Anaconda (1997)
Anaconda (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)
"When you can't breathe, you can't scream."  That may be true, but
when speaking in terms of the new thriller Anaconda, a more fitting tagline
would be "When you're laughing your ass off, you can't scream," for this
inane jungle adventure is nothing less than Congo '97.
This adventure, directed by Luis Llosa of The Specialist and Sniper
fame (or infamy, depending on how you look at it), follows a film crew
traveling down the Amazon to make a documentary on a mysterious tribe.  The
crew is a bunch of flat characters, each with only one discernible
personality trait: there's the earnest young director (Jennifer Lopez, the
only actor on board who emerges with her dignity intact); the cameraman from
the 'hood (Ice Cube); the horny sound guy (Owen Wilson); the bimbo
production manager (Kari Wuhrer); the stuffy British host (Jonathan Hyde);
the professor/love interest to the director (Eric Stoltz, wasted); and the
foreign-accented captain of the boat (Vincent Castellanos).  When they
stumble upon a mysterious stranger (Jon Voight) in a broken down boat, the
crew decides to take him on board.  Big mistake.  He's --no lie--a psychotic
former-priest-turned-snake-hunter from Paraguay, dangerously obsessed with
capturing the 40-foot anaconda snake alive--even if it means sacrificing the
film crew.
Now, if one is making a movie about snakes--giant, man-eating
snakes, no less--one would think that the first order of business would be
to come up with convincing snake effects.  Apparently, no one involved in
Anaconda thought hard enough.  The animatronic snakes look like giant rubber
hoses with tire treads.  Llosa also uses some "state-of-the-art" computer
animation for some shots of the snake striking and wrapping around its prey,
but the effects are obviously computer generated; the seams are quite visible.
The phony snakes are more than enough to ruin the film, but the true
awfulness of Anaconda doesn't stop there.  Two words--Jon Voight.  As the
nominal human villain of the piece, he is a complete embarrassment.  If his
unconvincing accent (alternately overdone and underdone) isn't bad enough,
there are his hilarious leering gazes at Lopez.  If that isn't enough, there
are his "villainous" looks, clenched teeth and eyes in full bulge, during
the physical scenes.  The rest of the cast isn't all that great, either, but
their work is downright Oscar-caliber compared to Voight's laughably
overwrought turn.
Anaconda can best be summed up by a line delivered midway by Lopez
without the slightest bit of irony: "This film was supposed to be my big
break, and now it's turned into a disaster."  You said it.

Title
Review for Affliction (1997)
Paul Schrader's adaptation of the Russell Banks novel is just as bleak
as 1997's justly celebrated Banks adaptation, Atom Egoyan's
_The_Sweet_Hereafter_, but, unlike with that haunting masterpiece,
something's amiss.  It's not in the acting: Nick Nolte delivers a
terrifically nuanced performance as Wade Whitehouse, the reigning police
officer in a small New England town; even more memorable is a frightening
James Coburn as Wade's alcoholic father, whose physical abuse of his son
as a child--or, rather, its psychological after-effects--is the
"affliction" that Wade continues to suffer from.  Neither is there
anything at fault on a technical level, boasting superior cinematography
by Paul Sarossy, who also shot _The_Sweet_Hereafter_.
What's crucially missing is a strong emotional connection, the
development of which is hampered by Schrader's glacial pacing, which
picks up by the third act, only to end rather abruptly.  The film lacks a
knockout punch because of the familiarity of the whole"violence begets
violence" premise, and Schrader doesn't go in any particularly new
direction with it.  Even so, the powerful performances by Nolte and
Coburn make the film well worth a look, even if they are part of a
less-than-developed whole.

Title
Review for Minus Man, The (1999)
With the title _Dog_Park_, this unremarkable romantic comedy sets itself
up for the easy play on words.  Comments such as "It's a dog" or "It's
bark is worse than its bite" would be fitting if the film had some bark,
let alone bite, to begin with--while not a good film, _Dog_Park_ is much
too gentle to inspire any dramatic reaction on either end of the opinion
spectrum.
The gentleness mostly comes from its lead characters--a fact that is, of
course, hardly a bad thing.  Luke Wilson is quite likable as average joe
classifieds writer Andy, who is smarting from his recent break with his
ex, Cheryl (Kathleen Robertson).  Natasha Henstridge, heretofore best
known for doffing her clothes through two _Species_ films, is equally as
winning as Lorna, a children's TV hostess also coming off of a bad
breakup.  Andy and Cheryl meet in a singles bar one night and hit it off.
 Is it all smooth sailing from here on out for the pair?  Of course not,
for there is still a good 75 minutes left in the film.
Unfortunately, writer-director Bruce McCulloch (who also co-stars) does
not come up with terribly convincing reasons for these two to remain
apart as long as they do.  One big reason for Lorna's reluctance to go
forward is the fact that the one night with Andy ended in embarrassment
for her, yet Andy forgives it so nice about it that one can't help but
wonder what her problem is.  This is highlighted when she decides to go
on a date with a loser she meets at a video store (Harland Williams).
The main pick-up spot in the film is not the video store, however, but
the dog park, where Andy and Cheryl spend time with the dog of whom they
share custody, Mogley--and, of course, where Lorna takes out her beloved
canine companion, Peanut.  As it turns out, Andy and Lorna also share the
same dog psychologist/trainer, played with maximum oddness by Mark
McKinney.  Offbeat touches such as that character lend the film its only
hint of edge.
And therein lies the problem.  _Dog_Park_'s soft quality makes it easy
enough to watch, but as with many things that are "nice," it doesn't
exactly make it memorable.  When the famously acerbic Janeane Garofalo
makes her first appearance as Jeri, Andy's editor/best friend, one's
hopes that she could put some of her usual zing into the thing and bring
it to life are soon dashed when McCulloch makes her play nice, too--also
erasing any hopes that the film will rise above its conventions.
Garofalo is also called on to play nice in a completely different film,
_Blade_Runner_ writer Hampton Fancher's introspective, deliberately paced
thriller _The_Minus_Man_.  But her turn as Ferrin, a sweet small-town
postal worker (!) who falls for friendly co-worker and new guy in town
Vann (Owen Wilson, Luke's brother, as it is) works better in this
context.  Perhaps that's because the mood here is not one of niceness but
of evil and dread, for Vann isn't exactly the nice guy he seems--in fact,
he's an unusually affable serial killer, who poisons people whom he feels
are better off dead.  
The cast is perfect; along with Garofalo and Wilson--whose low-key,
innocuous presence makes for an eerie fit--solid performances are given
by Brian Cox, Mercedes Ruehl, and, in her acting debut, Sheryl Crow.  The
film has been marketed as a big conversation piece, and, indeed, many
questions are raised throughout its running time.  But it's that quality
that is ultimately the film's undoing; too many pieces of the puzzle are
left out in what comes off as a rather strained and obvious attempt to
leave things up for discussion.  Most viewers, I suspect, won't really
want to go through the effort to talk it out, for there's really really
no point in doing it.

Title
Review for Fan, The (1996)
As shown in Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, and Cape Fear, Robert
DeNiro has nailed down the psycho stalker bit cold.  As if he needed to
prove it again, DeNiro plays--rather well, I might add--the titular stalker
in the new thriller The Fan.  While not quite as inspired as the work of its
lead, Tony Scott's film is an entertaining piece of work, if not the most
original.
Gil Renard's (DeNiro) life is in ruins--he's about to be let go from
the sporting knife company is father created, and his wife (Patti
D'Arbanville Quinn) won't let him see his son.  While everything crashes
around him, Gil holds on even more tightly to the one thing that's kept him
relatively sane--San Francisco Giants baseball.  Ironically, it is also what
drives him over the edge, for he becomes obsessed with helping his favorite
Giant, highly-paid outfielder Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes), come out of a
slump.
Despite fine work from the always-great Snipes, Ellen Barkin (as a
tough sports radio host), and, surprisingly, John Leguizamo (appropriately
oily as Bobby's agent), this is DeNiro's movie all the way.  The territory
is quite familiar for him, and as such his work can't help but feel somewhat
derivative--the geeky, deluded Gil is a variation of The King of Comedy's
Rupert Pupkin.  But to make him Pupkineque is a wise choice; Gil, while
always somewhat on the edge, comes off as a regular guy--passionate about
his likes and dislikes, somewhat overconfident at times, but not nearly as
cool as he thinks he is.  When Gil does finally lose it, DeNiro doesn't chew
the scenery; he remains rather calm, an appropriate acting choice that
conveys Gil's feeling of justification for his actions--and, in the process,
appears more menacing and more human.
However, the human angle in the latter part of the film comes
exclusively from DeNiro, for Phoef Sutton's script doesn't follow the same
line.  Sutton effectively humanizes Gil in the film's first half, showing
how a borderline personality is finally driven to insanity by the turmoil of
outside events.  But when he crosses that line, all of that goes out the
window.  There's no more empathizing with Gil, only fear of what he's
become--a murderous psycho.  It is to DeNiro's credit, and director Scott's,
that Gil manages to come off as more.  Sutton does manage to work in a great
bit near the end of the film where Bobby asks Gil what he wants from him,
and, after a moment of  pondering, Gil can't come up with an answer.  In
that brief moment, Sutton vividly shows the absurdity of the stalker mentality.
The biggest problem of The Fan isn't the writing--it's the
theatrical trailer, which gives pretty much the whole film away.  Director
Scott must be commended for making a brisk, stylish film that still manages
to create some suspense, even if a number of the plot points were divulged
in the trailer.  It's not especially scary, but it does entertain, and
that's the bottom line.

Review for Leggenda del pianista sull'oceano, La (1998)
_The_Legend_of_1900_ is, by every definition, a beautiful film: it's
lovely to look at--and perhaps even moreso to listen to; and the acting
is exquisite.  Looks may not count for everything when it comes to
movies, but in the case of Giuseppe Tornatore's old-fashioned cinematic
fable, it is more than enough, creating an enchanting, emotional spell
that is hard to resist.
Contrary to what the title may lead one to believe, _The_Legend_of_1900_
is not about one eventful year, but the many eventful years of a man born
in and named for that year (played as an adult by Tim Roth).  Abandoned
by his birth parents as an infant, Nineteen Hundred is discovered and
raised aboard the steam ship _The_Virginian_.  A natural born pianist,
his uncanny skill with the keys earns him a following among the many
travelers who cross the Atlantic aboard the ship, even attracting the
attention of the father of jazz himself, Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence
Williams III).  But Nineteen Hundred never sets foot off of his ship, and
as he sees the world pass him fraction by fraction with each voyage, he
wonders about a life on solid ground.
Tornatore's execution of the already sentimental story is as unabashedly
manipulative as it sounds, and while it's understandable why some critics
have thusly panned the film as being shameless claptrap, the broad
execution fits.  _The_Legend_of_1900_ is not a realistic story, but, as
it is billed, a fable--a tale of larger-than-life characters and
similarly exaggerated emotion.  Ennio Morricone's grandiose score
perfectly complements the atmosphere.  The mechanisms do show a bit too
clearly in the film's finale, which works too hard to get the audience to
cry.  The tear-wringing efforts may not work, but the fact that a
palpable sense of sadness and loss lingers not only over the ending but
the entire film shows how effectively Tornatore created his make-believe
world.
A key factor in giving the fantasy world some grounding in reality are
the actors.  The versatile Roth is enormously sympathetic as the
brilliant but lonely Nineteen Hundred; his tenderness may come as a shock
to those more familar with the scuzzy characters he's known for playing. 
Just as critical to the film's success is the performance of Pruitt
Taylor Vince, who is equally as touching as Max, Nineteen Hundred's
trumpeteer best friend and the film's narrator.
For all the talk of the art behind the medium, film is all about
transporting audiences to another place and time, removing them from
their here-and-now into the world that is presented onscreen. 
_The_Legend_of_1900_ is not a perfect film--one is always acutely aware
of the mechanics behind its manipulation--but for its intents and
purposes, it doesn't have to be.  One leaves the film reflecting on its
beauty and special sense of magic--which is all that counts.
"Beauty" and "magic" are words that wouldn't come close to being used to
describe the directorial debut of _1900_ star Roth, _The_War_Zone_.  The
film is not, as the title suggests, a war film, but emotional brutality
of this grim tale is just as, if not more, disturbing as, say, the
opening 20 minutes of _Saving_Private_Ryan_.  The war zone in question is
the modest four-person household in the countryside of Devon, England. 
The family appears to be nothing out of the ordinary, with the foibles of
a modern unit, particularly one that has moved from the big city (London
in this case) to the remote country.  The father (Ray Winstone) is in the
midst of ironing out business matters; the mother (Tilda Swinton) is due
to give birth to her third child; the 15-year-old son, Tom (Freddie
Cunliffe), misses his friends in London, and passes his spare time with
his elder sister, the also-teenage Jessie (Lara Belmont).
But there's a dark truth bubbling under the surface, one that Tom
stumbles upon one night, setting a course for disaster.  I will not
reveal what that truth is, but needless to say it's wholly
unpleasant--and portrayed in a discomfiting, unflinching manner, for
which Roth must be commended.  He takes a great risk in confronting a
sensitive subject with such brazen matter-of-factness, and the film's
success does not come with the fact that he took the risk, but that he
takes that risk without ever seeming exploitative.  There is no
sugarcoating nor glamorizing of the situation.  He presents it as it
is--raw and painfully real.
As is the case with many directorial projects by actors, the acting is
uniformly solid in _The_War_Zone_; in fact, it's nothing short of
extraordinary.  Standing out among the impressive cast are the two gifted
newcomers, Cunliffe and especially Belmont.  The fact that these two are
unfamiliar faces only heightens the realism, and, in turn, the film's
devastating effect.  A very rough sit, the uncompromising _The_War_Zone_
is by no stretch an enjoyable film, and for that reason, it is one to be
greatly admired.  (_The_War_Zone_ opens December 10)

Title
Review for Cookie's Fortune (1999)
_Cookie's_Fortune_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Robert Altman's most fun movie since 1992's _The_Player_ is this wickedly
enjoyable dark comedy--which, any way you slice it, is one steaming slab of
Southern-fried soap.  Among those populating the small town of Holly
Springs are scheming spinster Camille (Glenn Close); her spineless,
half-wit sister Cora (Julianne Moore); Cora's rebellious daughter Emma (Liv
Tyler), who is carrying on with another half-wit, sheriff's deputy Jason
(Chris O'Donnell); Camille and Cora's octogenarian aunt Cookie (Patricia
Neal); and Cookie's only friend, ever-faithful handyman Willis (Charles S.
Dutton).  As in any soap, this family has more than its share of scandalous
secrets--which gradually break through the surface when one of these people
turns up dead.
But unlike any soap, there is an uncommon richness of character in Anne
Rapp's script, which carves out memorable niches for even the most
peripheral of characters, such as a sheriff's department receptionist
(Niecy Nash) with the hots for a suave investigator (Courtney B. Vance).
Rapp, Altman, and the well-cast acting ensemble are fully aware of the
preposterousness of the twisted goings-on.  What isn't preposterous,
though, is the craft behind the whole affair, from the precision of
Altman's direction to the uniformly fine work by the acting ensemble, whose
standouts are the terrific Dutton and Close, the latter displaying a comic
gift too rarely seen onscreen.

Title
Review for Simon Birch (1998)
_Simon_Birch_ (PG) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
Aside from the fleeting presences of big screen talent such as Ashley Judd
and Jim Carrey, there's little in this modest, engaging, yet cloying drama
to distinguish it from, as my guest at the screening said, "a
_Hallmark_Hall_of_Fame_ movie."  "Suggested by" John Irving's novel
_A_Prayer_for_Owen_Meany_ (joining the ranks of Disney's other loose
adaptations of books: _Up_Close_&_Personal, "suggested by" a biography on
late newswoman Jessica Savitch; and, most notoriously,
_The_Scarlet_Letter_, "freely adapted" from the Nathaniel Hawthorne
classic), _Simon_Birch_ tells of the friendship between two very different
12-year-old boys in the 1960s: the tiny title character (Ian Michael
Smith), the smallest delivery ever recorded in his town; and Joe (Joseph
Mazzello).  The two stick together through laughs and tears while at the
same time searching for elusive answers: the identity of Joe's father and
Simon's true purpose as, according to him, "God's instrument."
_Simon_Birch_ features from impressive performances by a glowing Ashley
Judd (as Joe's foxy mother), Oliver Platt (as Judd's boyfriend), and
especially Mazzello and newcomer Smith.  The pair's emotionally charged
scenes are affecting because of their unforced, heartbreaking performances,
and not the often treacly, TV-movie-level writing and direction of
first-timer Mark Steven Johnson, who also overdoes the slapsticky comedy
scenes.  _Simon_Birch_ is a sweet little film, but it may be a bit too
sweet for its own good.

Title
Review for Held Up (1999)
When asked about his latest big screen vehicle, _Held_Up_, by a radio DJ
at a recent movie premiere, Jamie Foxx urged the crowd, "Don't see that
shit."  I can't blame him.  "Held up" is more than just what happens to
his character in this laugh-free comedy--it's also what happens to Foxx's
promising career with this creaky vehicle.
Foxx is a versatile talent; he more than held his dramatic own in Oliver
Stone's _Any_Given_Sunday_, whose soundtrack also gave him an opportunity
to show off his impressive singing chops.  First and foremost, though,
he's known for his skill as a comedian, as displayed on his eponymous WB
sitcom or, better yet, his stint on _In_Living_Color_.  And there are
moments in _Held_Up_ where his gift shines through.  As his Michael
Dawson and a few others are held hostage by a robber (Eduardo Yańez) in a
middle-of-nowhere convenience store, Foxx has his moments, such as when a
spontaneous rendition of Earth, Wind and Fire's "Reasons" spurs on a mass
singalong.
Maybe that example isn't exactly a gutbuster, but, sadly, is one of the
more inspired moments of Jeff Eastin's weak script.  Michael, who had
been on a long road trip from Chicago with his girlfriend Rae (Nia Long),
ends up at the convenience store after she leaves him there after
learning that the vintage car in which they've been traveling cost much
more than he said.  Not long after she hitches a ride to the nearby Las
Vegas airport, Michael's beloved car is stolen, and he's stuck in the
convenience store with a typically eccentric bunch--one that grows even
moreso with the arrival of the robber.
Eastin's idea of comedy is playing to racial stereotypes.  The small
desert town in which the store is located is a haven for bumbling
rednecks.  Those in law enforcement, such as Sheriff Pembry (Barry
Corbin) and Deputy Beaumont (Jake Busey) are not much more intelligent,
if not even less so.  Michael, being the only black man in town, is
mistaken for famous African-Americans such as Puff Daddy and--in a
particularly weak joke--Mike Tyson since "Dawson" sounds oh so much like
"Tyson."
With director Steve Rash focusing on the less-than-scintillating hostage
crisis--which is made even more tedious by the real-time
storytelling--Long is left with nothing to do.  Every so often Rash cuts
to Rae waiting in an airport bar for her flight back home to Chicago,
telling the bartender (Julie Hagerty) about her relationship with
Michael.  Since there are no attempts at humor, strained or otherwise, in
these passages they are somewhat easier to tolerate than the
groan-inducing would-be hijinks at the convenience store.  That fact, of
course, doesn't necessarily mean that these scenes aren't boring, which
they are.
That, in a nutshell, is what's wrong with _Held_Up_: it's boring.  It
takes some doing to make performers as magnetic and energetic as Foxx and
Long uninteresting to watch, and that's exactly what Rash and Eastin have
managed to accomplish here.  Foxx and Long will easily recover from this
career misstep, but one has to wonder just how they got held up with
_Held_Up_ in the first place.

Title
Review for Mission to Mars (2000)
_Mission_to_Mars_ (PG) ** (out of ****)
Virtual missions to Mars are not new to the Walt Disney Company.  Long
before its much ballyhooed revamp, the Tomorrowland area of Disneyland
prominently featured (right next to Space Mountain) a little curio called
Mission to Mars.  It was an attraction, not a ride: patrons would sit in
a circular auditorium that was made to look like a spaceship, and through
some images projected on screens, fancy lighting, and--most important of
all--some vibrating seats, earthlings made "trips" to Mars by the
hundreds about every half hour.
That attraction was indeed cheesy, but after seeing Disney/Touchstone's
new film bearing the name _Mission_to_Mars_, I could not help but feel
nostalgic for those long-gone yesterdays in Tomorrowland.  For one thing,
at least Mission to Mars (the attraction) had vibrating seats--something
that would make this shockingly cornball effort from director Brian
DePalma a little easier to sit through to the very end.  But not by much.
The year is 2020, and NASA has sent a four-astronaut crew to the red
planet.  After encountering a strange storm-like force, the only person
left alive is Mission Commander Luke Graham (Don Cheadle).  A
rescue/recovery team is soon deployed; in this team are Graham's old
friends Jim McConnell (Gary Sinise), Woody Blake (Tim Robbins), and
Woody's wife Dr. Terri Fisher (Connie Nielsen), as well as scientist Phil
Ohlmyer (Jerry O'Connell).  Of course, such an operation is easier
planned than executed, and the crew of the Mars Recovery Mission run into
their fair share of trouble en route to the planet.  Their troubles are
encapsulated in an effective extended suspense sequence where one
calamity seamlessly and convincingly leads to another.  The palpable
tension that DePalma is able to create easily compensates for some
shameless product placement.
It's quite unfortunate, then, that this sequence would end on a forced,
unintentionally comic note of melodrama, not helped by some amateurish
emoting by Nielsen.  Just as, at one point, an indicator on Terri's
spacesuit reads "Point of no return," this is also the juncture where
_Mission_to_Mars_ gets progressively, irreparably worse.  Upon landing on
Mars, the film, which had been a diverting spacefaring adventure with an
impressive command of technical detail, decides to become a sci-fi film
of ideas, ŕ la _2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_ or _Contact_.  Those familiar with
DePalma's body of work know that his instincts are more attuned to the
former than the latter.
The problem with the turn runs deeper than a directorial miscast,
however.  _Mission_to_Mars_ has already used up over half of its
113-minute length by the time the script goes all profound, hardly enough
space to tackle the highfalutin ideas writers Jim Thomas, John Thomas,
and Graham Yost want to tackle.  So it's little surprise that this part
of the story feels rushed, which, in turn, results in a superficial
treatment that renders the point laughably trite.  The film's trailer not
only completely divulges its big "secret" (I won't spoil it for those who
haven't seen it), but also lifts the film's exploration of this idea in
its complete form.  Those intrigued by the trailer and looking for deeper
backup of the central idea in the actual film won't find it, for what's
in the trailer is all there is.
Such a disastrous final act is especially disappointing in the case of
_Mission_to_Mars_, for it is an adequate entertainment for its first
two-thirds.  Pedestrian story details such as Jim's sadness over his
deceased astronaut wife are smoothed over by the convincing acting of
Sinise, Cheadle, and Robbins; the effects, which are, if hardly
groundbreaking, functional; and the painstaking attention to the
technical side of space travel.  Unfortunately, what one remembers
strongly about _Mission_to_Mars_ is the corny conclusion, which leaves a
bitter taste--so bitter, that it was able to completely wash away the
flavor of the unlimited free Mars candy bars given away at the press
screening.

Title
Review for Pitch Black (2000)
Much imagination can be seen in the science fiction thriller
_Pitch_Black_--and I mean "seen": in a time where all the far-off worlds
in distant galaxies have come to look the same, cinematographer David
Eggby has given the film's central planet a look that is distinctly new
and alien.  But that is the only thing free from the cookie cutter in
David Twohy's otherwise derivative action film.
The plot is a ripoff of _Aliens_, with a group of people marooned on a
desert planet being hunted down by ravenous alien creatures; these
creatures themselves resemble the Alien, with a couple of alterations
(the most major one being that some have wings).  There is another added
wrinkle--they only come out in the dark, and when the planets multiple
suns undergo simultaneous eclipse, the humans must band together to
survive.
Just who are these humans, anyway?  There is very little
characterization in the script by Twohy and Jim and Ken Wheat.  The
ostensible lead is fry (Radha Mitchell), a pilot with the requisite
personal trauma, which is linked to the crash that placed them on the
planet.  The other two main characters are just as shallow, but at least
they're given some type of memorable characteristic (everyone else
isn't).  Johns (Cole Hauser) is a lawman who is perhaps even shadier than
his prisoner, the murderer Riddick (Vin Diesel), who has special night
vision enhanced eyes.  Riddick's escape from custody makes for a tedious
timekilling subplot before the alien story gets underway; with all the
others fearing for their lives while trying to locate him, the film
resembles an outer space slasher film.
Character is not as important as action and effects in films such as
_Pitch_Black_, and while competently done, nothing here breaks any new
ground in those departments; the slow-mo and quick cut style Twohy uses
is a pale imitation of John Woo.  What is fresh, as I had mentioned, is
Eggby's sterling cinematography.  The early exterior shots on the planet
are striking, with all the colors washed out other than garish shades of
yellow.  Another interesting conceit is that each of the planet's three
sons bear a different hue; as such, when in the light of the blue sun,
for instance, the image is awash in blue, etc.
Such striking use of color goes out the window when the key eclipse
takes place, and _Pitch_Black_'s look matches its title.  From that point
on, with the action and effects failing to really dazzle, one looks to
Twohy to provide something of interest in the story.  But no such thing
ever comes, and the virtual absence of humor backfires, ironically making
the some of the proceedings laughable (the overwrought "emotional"
moments come off especially ridiculous).  _Pitch_Black_ may actually
please most audiences for capably executing most of its desired task, but
it takes something a bit more to make a lasting impression in a crowded
genre.

Title
Review for Hard Rain (1998)
In an apparent response to the lukewarm reaction to Hollywood's last two
disaster epics, the dueling volcano movies Dante's Peak and Volcano, the
makers of Hard Rain (formerly known as The Flood) have tweaked the usual
disaster formula a bit, melding traditional disaster elements with more
slam-bang action.  While the resulting film is never boring and
entertaining on a superficial level, in the end it remains an uneven mix of
both worlds.
Writer Graham Yost, best known for his script for Speed, fashions Hard
Rain with a similarly thin storyline.  A group of thieves, led by a shady
character known only as Jim (Morgan Freeman) attempt to rob an armored car
carrying $3 million.  Two things stand in their way--biggest of all, Mother
Nature, which has flooded the town of Huntingsburg, Indiana with the mother
of all downpours; and Tom (Christian Slater), the armored car's driver, who
manages to hide the cash before anyone can take it.  With the help of the
town sheriff (Randy Quaid) and church artist Karen (Minnie Driver), Tom
aims to protect the carefully hidden fortune while braving the elements.
Speed was able to overcome its simple plot--madman extorts money from the
city with a bomb on a bus--with crack direction by Jan DeBont and the
personalities created by stars Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, and, most
notably, Sandra Bullock.  Hard Rain's shortcomings do not lie with director
Mikael Salomon, a former cinematographer.  Salomon stages the gunfights and
boat chases with some skill (though no one but John Woo should even attempt
to pull off a church shootout), and uses the waterlogged setting to create
some striking shots.  He also has a sure hand with the water effects, which
give the gushing torrents of water an appropriate air of menace.  One of
the main shortcomings, however, lie with the characters, who, as in too
many disaster films, are poorly defined and/or uninteresting.  Tom is a
cardboard do-gooder, and despite the best efforts of the always-engaging
Driver, Karen is little more than a token action film female.  A couple of
late-inning twists muddy the personalities of the sheriff and especially
Jim; by film's end I was not exactly sure what the audience is supposed to
make of him.
What causes the most damage to Hard Rain is the inclusion of cheesy
disaster movie conventions.  It would have been fine if the flood were used
as a backdrop to the action storyline, the water serving as an ominous
threat looming over the events.  But in keeping with a typical disaster
film's varied "pastiche" of characters, he shoehorns in a grating,
unhappily married old couple (Richard Dysart and Betty White), who linger
in the background and become briefly involved in the action before
virtually (and mercifully) disappearing during the final act.  We also get
served up one of those interminable melodramatic, would-be heart-tugging
death scenes, this one occurring after a character gets electrocuted.
After all is said and done, Hard Rain is a somewhat diverting popcorn
flick that holds one's interest for its fairly brief running time.  It's
just that I cannot help but think that maybe the film would have been
better off being either a disaster film _or_ an action film instead of the
uneven blend that plays out onscreen.

Title
Review for Antz (1998)
It's still another two months before DreamWorks launches its assault on
the current state of feature animation with the much-ballyhooed (and
equally as anticipated) _The_Prince_of_Egypt_, but in the meantime, the
crew at SKG has found another way to hit Disney where it hurts--in the
field of computer animation.  With the witty and wise _Antz_, DreamWorks
and PDI has given the Mouse and Pixar's upcoming _A_Bug's_Life_ a tough act
to follow.
The "z" in _Antz_ stands for Z (voice of Woody Allen), a lowly worker ant
who for once wants to do something for his individual needs rather than
those of the colony.  He gets a taste of something different when Princess
Bala (Sharon Stone), reluctantly betrothed to megalomaniacal General
Mandible (Gene Hackman) and bored with her sheltered life in general,
sneaks out and joins the commoners for one night, meeting Z at a bar (where
"aphid beers" are served).  Bala's ruse is soon discovered, but not before
Z has fallen head over heels in love.  Determined to break from his class
and win Bala's love in return, Z comes up with a scheme that, if anything,
will win Bala's attention.  Alas, he gets a lot more than he bargained for.
Like Disney's trailblazing _Toy_Story_, _Antz_ has a smart script that
will keep adults equally as entertained, if not more, as the young 'uns.
The screenplay by Todd Alcott, Chris Weitz, and Paul Weitz is a most
unlikely--and often hilarious--Communist allegory, with the oppressed
workers encouraged to "work for the good of the colony" and even forced to
dance the same way at the same time each day; Z's scheme inspires the
masses to revolt.  But beyond the social satire, a lot of the script's
creativity lies in its placing the audience in the ants' shoes, seeing
familiar things from the insects' eyes.  For example, simple trash can
brimming with litter is "Insectopia," a paradise of food and other delights
for all insects; and a single water droplet can spell a horrible death by
drowning.
The material really comes to life in the hands of the actors and the
animators at PDI.  The character of Z would be unthinkable without the
voice of Allen; freed from his physical form, his tired neurotic New Yorker
schtick is given a freshness.  The rest of the actors are also well-cast:
Sylvester Stallone is perfect fit for Z's musclehead soldier friend,
Weaver; Stone lends Princess Bala sexiness and spunk, as does Jennifer
Lopez to Z's worker friend Azteca; Hackman makes Mandible a hissable
villain; and Christopher Walken is an ideal foil as his right-hand ant,
Colonel Cutter.  Though the actors give the ants most of personality, the
animators fill in the blanks, coming up with a look for the ants that is at
once humanized (their faces are wonderfully expressive) yet distinctly
insect-like.  The artwork is consistently first rate, if a bit limited in
the big picture; most of the action takes place in the ant colony, which
means repeated use the same dingy dirt tunnel backgrounds.  However, some
visually dazzling scenes, such as a rather harrowing combat sequence
involving some menacing termites, more than compensate.
In recent months, many studios have tried to take a bite out of Disney's
stranglehold on the feature animation market--and failed.  If the
delightful _Antz_ is any indication of what is in the pipeline of
DreamWorks' traditional animation division, it may not be such a small
world after all.  (opens October 2)

Title
Review for Wo hu cang long (2000)
_Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_ (PG-13) **** (out of ****)
The martial arts film has always generally been written off as being the
cinematic equivalent of junk food.  The term often used for the genre,
"chopsocky," perfectly expresses this perception; the word sounds fun,
but it also sounds rather silly and inconsequential.  There's no denying
the amusement to be had with, say, an average Jackie Chan film, but is
there any real nourishment that comes with the enjoyment?  Not
especially.
With credits ranging from the Taiwanese family dramas
_The_Wedding_Banquet_ and _Eat_Drink_Man_Woman_ to the slice of '70s
Americana _The_Ice_Storm_ and the Jane Austen adaptation
_Sense_and_Sensibility_, director Ang Lee would appear an unlikely person
to helm what would be typically classified as a kung fu flick; in fact,
given his award-winning oeuvre, such a film seems beneath him.  As it
turns out, however, Lee is not only a lifelong fan of the genre, his
greatest filmmaking goal was to make a lavish martial arts epic. 
Watching _Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_, the fruition of that dream,
it's clear that all of Lee's previous (and largely terrific) work has
been a mere warm-up to this staggering accomplishment.  _Crouching_Tiger_
is even more than an exhilarating reinvigoration of the martial arts
movie--it's a thrilling testament to the transporting power of film.
Note the term "reinvigoration" as opposed to "reinvention," for in
keeping with being a reverential fan, Lee doesn't tamper with time-worn
convention in adapting Wang Du Lu's 18th Century-set novel (the fourth in
a series of five).  Basic plot strands bear the air of the familiar. 
After many years of legend-building combat, famous and feared warrior Li
Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) is ready to give up his violent ways--that is,
after completing one last mission: avenging the murder of his master at
the hands of the notorious criminal known as Jade Fox.  But Li is ready
to make one major gesture toward a different life, and that is giving up
his fabled sword, the Green Destiny to a friend.  Soon after it is placed
in the trophy case of respected leader Sir Te (Lung Sihung), the Green
Destiny is stolen, and Li and his longtime friend and former combat
partner Yu Shu Lien's (Michelle Yeoh) quest to recover it is the mere
jumping-off point for a sweeping tale of action, intrigue, and romance.
One of _Crouching_Tiger_'s most noteworthy elements is the first-ever
screen pairing of two of Hong Kong cinema's biggest stars, Yeoh and Chow.
 Surprisingly, these iconic figures actually take secondary positions to
beautiful young newcomer Zhang Ziyi.  As Jen, the seemingly innocent and
innocuous daughter of prominent political figure Governor Yu (Li Fa
Zeng), Zhang is a real find, holding her own in all aspects and carrying
the picture with ease once the focus settles squarely on her.  The
conflicting forces battling for influence over Jen's soul is
_Crouching_Tiger_'s main concern, and without an actress as gifted and
captivating as Zhang in the pivotal role, it's difficult to imagine the
story being quite as engrossing involving as it is.
That said, there's no discounting the invaluable contribution Yeoh and
Chow make to the film.  They prove to be a most dynamic duo in every way,
even displaying sides of their ability that they've never had an
opportunity to reveal before.  The ever-charismatic and commanding Chow,
making his bow in this type of action film, proves to be as natural with
a sword as he is with a gun (his usual cinematic weapon of choice); but
granted, his stunts aren't as heavy duty as those of Yeoh, who is given
ample opportunity to show off and even elevate her well-established
athleticism and grace in the spectacular fights staged by the renowned
martial arts choreographer Yuen Wo-Ping.  But the two are even more
impressive in the dramatic scenes.  They have a nicely understated
chemistry that lends heartrending pathos to their characters'
relationship.  Li and Shu Lien have long been in love, but they've denied
their passion in honor of the memory of Shu Lien's late fiancé, a brother
by oath to Li.  Their tortured longing is subtly, wrenchingly conveyed in
Yeoh and Chow's vividly expressive eyes.
Scripters Wang Hui-ling, Tsai Kuo-jung, and James Schamus (Lee's regular
writing collaborator) ultimately address a number of weighty themes in
_Crouching_Tiger_, but they and Lee don't make their points without
having fun along the way.  A lot of fun.  The story is essentially
serious, but the film has a healthy, self-aware sense of humor about
itself, best exemplified by the parallel romance between Jen and Lo
(Chang Chen), a desert-dwelling bandit.  The circumstances behind their
meeting are wholly comical; she chases after him for an insane distance
after he steals... her comb.  Ridiculous, yes; but the light touch is
beguiling and completely convincing, befitting the playfulness of a
young, impetuous love.
Of course, most of the fun comes from the electrifying and boundlessly
imaginative action sequences, which further maintain the film's fidelity
to genre tradition by paying no heed to the laws of gravity.  The film's
first showpiece, an extended chase/fight across many Peking rooftops, is
a jaw-dropper guaranteed to get every audience around the world to burst
into awestruck applause.  Even more unbelievable than this sequence is
the fact that this is only the starting point.  To say more is to rob a
bit of the wonder of the thrills Lee and Yuen conjure up; suffice it to
say, they regularly defy and surpass expectations.  In terms of
bread-and-butter fighting, Yuen outdoes himself, and Lee shoots the
action in such a way that every balletic, meticulously choreographed move
is made clear and thus lent maximum impact.
That impact stays with you long after _Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_
is over, but what leaves an impression even more enduring than the
spectacular action, breathtaking images (captured by cinematographer
Peter Pau), and lovely melodies (composed by Tan Dun) are the
people--their personalities, their emotions, their struggles, the hard
lessons that they learn.  Exciting, funny, uplifting, heartbreaking--the
list of descriptions can go on and on, yet all that is the magnificent
_Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon_ is easily encapsulated in one word:
masterpiece.

Review for Love & Basketball (2000)
_Love_&_Basketball_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****)
Film genres don't come more basic and predictable than the love story
and the sports movie.  Love story: soulmates run into countless,
sometimes trivial, obstacles en route to "happily ever after"; sports
movie: athletes must overcome physical and (mostly) mental hurdles to
achieve their crowning glory.  As one can glean from its no-frills title,
_Love_&_Basketball_ doesn't break much, if any, new ground within its
genres, but writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood approaches the formula
task with such intelligence and sincerity that it's petty to complain.
The most refreshing wrinkle to _Love_&_Basketball_ is its
straightforward treatment of women's sports, a subject that is rarely
covered without a special angle.  The female athlete here is Monica
Wright (Sanaa Lathan), a naturally gifted basketball player who continues
to grow and mature in her ability as she works her way up from the high
school ranks to the college ranks.  Following the same path, albeit in a
more flamboyant fashion, is her longtime neighbor Quincy McCall (Omar
Epps), son of NBA journeyman Zeke McCall (Dennis Haysbert) and a shooting
star in his own right.
_Love_&_Basketball_ is the story of two passions: Monica and Quincy's
passion for the game and also their passion for each other. 
Prince-Bythewood comes up with an ingenious way of melding these two
through the film's structure: like a basketball game, the film--and,
thus, the development of their relationship--is broken down into four
quarters  The two meet as 11-year-olds (played by Kyla Pratt and Glenndon
Chatman, respectively) in the first quarter (set in 1981), and after some
typical boy-girl hostility, they grow to become friends.  The second
quarter covers the pair's (now played by Lathan and Epps) senior year in
high school, when they become a couple.  The third quarter traces their
turbulent freshman year at USC, when their shared passions end up
conflicting with each other, setting the stage for the 1993-set fourth
quarter, which catches up with the two after college.
The scope of the film is ambitious--it also touches on their
less-than-smooth relationships with their parents, not to mention the
rocky relationship between Quincy's mom (Debbi Morgan) and dad--but
Prince-Bythewood keeps the focus simple.  All told, _Love_&_Basketball_
is nothing more than the story of two people who love each other--and I
mean people, not just characters.  Monica and Quincy are
multi-dimensional people, with their own individual strengths,
weaknesses, and dreams.  In an average movie, the script would have to
manufacture complications to pull them apart, but the problems the two
face are firmly rooted in who they are..  It could be said that the
biggest obstacle in their relationship is the one big obstacle faced by
couples in real life: each other's fundamental imperfection as human
beings.
Adding immeasurably to the authenticity of the film--both the sports
story and the romance--are Epps and especially Lathan.  Epps again proves
to be a consistently solid performer; he's charismatic, likable, and more
than up to the role's athletic requirements.  The revelation here is
Lathan, whose most high-profile role to date had been as Taye Diggs' love
interest in _The_Best_Man_.   Lathan is extremely convincing during
Monica's many hoops scenes--an accomplishment made more impressive by the
fact she could not ball worth a damn when she was initially cast.  Her
most glorious accomplishment, however, is her heartfelt dramatic
performance.  Monica carries the greatest emotional weight in the film,
and Lathan brings the role natural depth and nuance.  Even when the
formula mechanics of the film start to show, Lathan lends the proceedings
a crucial air of reality; she obviously believes in the material, and the
audience finds no difficulty in following suit.  A particularly
overwrought line has Monica telling Quincy she'll play a one-on-one game
for his heart, but Lathan makes it sound like the most natural thing
anyone can say at that moment.
_Love_&_Basketball_ isn't the most exciting of titles, but it's as
honest a title as one is likely to find gracing a multiplex marquee.  The
film indeed has a lot of love, a lot of basketball, and it delivers all
the expected payoffs at all the expected moments.  While that fact may
turn off people looking for something beyond the formula, I'd wager that
for most audiences, all that _Love_&_Basketball_ has to offer will more
than satisfy.

Title
Review for Starship Troopers (1997)
Starship Troopers (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)
Starship Troopers is Paul Verhoeven's return to familiar sci-fi ground
after the disastrous Showgirls, and it just might be the quintessential
Verhoeven film.  While it is not a complete rebound from the instant camp
classic of '95, it is a shining example of Verhoeven at his best--and,
unfortunately, his worst.
Based on the Robert A. Heinlein novel of the same name, Starship Troopers
details mankind's future war with giant bugs from outer space.  Why have
these alien arthropods decided to pick a fight with Earthlings?  We never
find out, not that it matters.  The wild and woolly battles with the CGI
bugs find the Dutch Verhoeven, who made his name in America with the
superlative sci-fi actioners RoboCop and Total Recall, back in top form.
No other action director can make mass impalings, decapitations, and
dismemberment so sadistically--and gleefully--over-the-top.  More prudish
viewers may find the bloody action repugnant, but the gruesome, almost
cartoonish, nature of the violence is exactly what makes Verhoeven
adventures so much fun.
Unfortunately, aside from a brief snippet of opening bug action, there is
an often laughable first hour of exposition and uninspired soap opera
subplots, during which we meet our focal slate of stock characters: Johnny
Rico (Casper Van Dien), hotshot soldier; his demure girlfriend, Carmen
Ibanez (Denise Richards), a military pilot; brash Dizzy Flores (Dina
Meyer), who carries a torch for the oblivious Johnny; pilot Zander Barcalow
(Patrick Muldoon), Johnny's rival for Carmen's affections; and Carl Jenkins
(Neil Patrick Harris), an intelligence officer whose psychic abilities only
extend to animals.  Every film needs its expository time, and this section
of the film is an obvious timekiller before the war heats up, but Verhoeven
and screenwriter Ed Neumeier put forth very little effort, if any, to make
these characters and their situations halfway interesting.  More energy and
thought is expended in the acidly satiric news bites and fascistic military
recruitment propaganda that pepper this first half.  How do the filmmakers
expect the viewers to care about the characters if they obviously do not?
If anything could have saved this first hour and more "dramatic" moments
that come later in the film, it would be the acting, but, as so painfully
exemplified in Showgirls, Verhoeven does not have much of an eye for young
talent.  Van Dien, whom I remember not-so-fondly from his stints on ABC
Daytime's One Life to Live and the amusingly cheesy but little-seen 1990
syndicated women-in-prison soap Dangerous Women, can bark out "Kill 'em
all!" with the best of them, but he has little acting skill to offer beside
his square jaw.  It also does not help that he, Richards, and Meyer make
the WASPiest Argentines since... well, Jonathan Pryce in Evita; and that
they, Harris, and Muldoon look much too old to be the high schoolers their
characters are supposed to be at the film's opening.  The only cast member
displaying some signs of life--aside from Michael Ironside, who is usual
stern, effective self as teacher/commanding officer Jean Rasczak--is Meyer,
who infuses Dizzy with moxie and spunk.
And while Verhoeven is miles away from Joe Eszterhas (thankfully so), some
post-Showgirls fallout is still in evidence, most blatantly in a
ridiculously gratuitous co-ed shower scene, and more subtly so in its
anti-feminism.  I usually do not like to include spoilers in my reviews,
but I cannot address this point without giving something away, so skip the
next paragraph if you wish not to have some details spoiled...
When a male character is able to destroy a humongous tanker bug, he is
celebrated as a hero; when a female character does the same--which no other
person save that one male is able to do--she receives no credit.  A female
soldier mortally wounded in combat bravely accepts her impending death, but
not because she did her part in saving the human race.  In the end, her
passing is worth it to her because... she had the chance to sleep with a
studly conquest.  A female character supplies a critical coup de grace
against the aliens, but who is carried on everyone's shoulders like a hero
at the end?  A male who did not do much of anything.
Its problems aside, Starship Troopers does deliver what the audience comes
for, which is two-plus hours of no-brainer entertainment, filled with the
graphic ultraviolence that has become associated with the name Paul
Verhoeven.  But as fun as much of the movie is, its superficiality is quite
dismaying coming from Verhoeven, who once upon a time melded electrifying
action with plot and character in RoboCop and Total Recall.  Starship
Troopers is not the return to form for Verhoeven many have called it--in
the end, it is just a step in the right direction, albeit a fairly
entertaining one.
