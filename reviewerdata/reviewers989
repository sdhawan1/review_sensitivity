Review for Message in a Bottle (1999)
As Message in a Bottle opens, we see an expanse of deep, ocean water and
the name, Kevin Costner, is emblazoned across it.  Your first thoughts
are, Is this a sequel to Water World?  But rest assured, it is not.  It is
a marvelous, weepy type of love story that's set in today's world.
Robin Wright Penn, who is always sensational, is perfectly cast as
Theresa Osborne, the divorcee who lives and works in Chicago with her
nine-year old son.  She has brought him to the East Coast to spend some
time with his father, who has remarried and has a new baby.   In an
attempt to relax, she spends a couple of days vacationing on the seacoast
where she finds a bottle with a message inside.  The message is written to
Catherine, and it is filled with love, the kind of love that Theresa wants
and needs.   She takes the bottle and message back to Chicago, to the
newspaper where she works, and her boss [Robbie Coltrane] writes a column
about it.   The column prompts many letters including two that tell of
finding similar messages.  
With the help of her computer and friends like Lina Paul [Illeana
Douglas], Theresa tracks down the sender of the messages.  He is a
ship-builder living in the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  She convinces
her boss to let her visit the area for a follow-up story.  Once there, she
meets and falls in love with Garret Blake [Kevin Costner].   
The real treasure of the film is the portrayal of Garret's father, Dodge
Blake by Paul Newman.  This man has certainly aged well.  He's still nice
looking, but it is his believability as the loving, caring parent who is
coping with his own demons that impresses you most.  It is a long time
until next year's Oscar race, but I hope that the Academy remembers him
for a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  He deserves it.
Although most people will say that this is a `chick' flick, it truly
appeals to anyone, male or female, who has feelings.  There were many men
in the audience who couldn't hold back the tears.  If you didn't even care
about the love story, you'll be impressed with the cinematography.  There
are some of the prettiest shots that I have ever seen, not only of the
ocean, and the other beautiful locations, but all the shots are special,
especially the lighting and the shadows of the love scene.  It shows how a
love scene should be filmed.  There is nothing salacious about it.  The
lighting is love itself.  Hollywood should take note that a good movie can
be made without explosions, nudity, or swearing.
It's early in the year to give a high rating, but this has to be at least
a B+.  I do want to see it again, and I'll keep recommending it.

Review for Analyze This (1999)
Insecure psychiatrist, Ben Sobol [ Crystal] rear-ends the car belonging to
mob boss Paul Vitti [De Niro] whose henchmen are hilarious trying to close
the car's trunk carrying a bound and gagged soon-to-be corpse.  Later,
when Vitti casually asks if either of them knows of a good psychiatrist to
help a `friend' they produce the business card that Sobol had given them. 
Suddenly, Sobol has a new patient and his life changes forever.  Just
imagine how all of the mobsters feel when they realize that Vitti is
probably telling all of their secrets to an outsider.
The friction between Vitti and rival Sindone [Palminteri] is only part of
the plot.  Not only is Sobol living in his father's shadow, he is engaged
to marry Laura [Kudrow], a relationship that keeps being interrupted by
Vitti's needs.
There are some very funny moments in this film but there is a lot of foul
language as well.  Sure, gangsters may talk that way but Edward G.
Robinson and James Cagney never had to resort to such dialogue on film and
they were the epitome of underworld figures.  I would have enjoyed it a
lot more without the four letter words, especially seeing that it is aimed
at teenagers who need to add better choices to their vocabularies.
Oh, speaking of children - Sobol has an obnoxious son who conveniently and
thankfully disappears in the second half of the movie.   We really never
get to know him.   They should have left him out entirely.  He was only
there for the few jokes that he generated, but he wasn't worth it. 
This isn't a bad movie.  It just isn't a real good one.  Except for the
language and some nudity, it's an OK way to pass a couple of hours.
I'd give it a B-.  I would watch it again, on free TV.                    

Title
Review for Arlington Road (1999)
In the days before television and air-conditioning neighbors got to know
each other as they sat on their porches getting a breath of fresh air. 
Families kept their eyes open and made sure that all the children behaved.
At first, you might feel that such a relationship is forming in Arlington
Road.  But, things aren't as they seem.   
I've seen this film twice and I'm still making deductions about what
really happened.  The first screening was several months ago, when no hint
about the plot was known.  The movie literally blew me away.  I wanted to
see it again, but the release date kept being postponed.  Eight months
later, when there was another screening, I looked for scenes that would
explain what I remembered.  Many critics are simply dismissing the plot as
too contrivedthat it couldn't happen.  I don't agree.  The writing is
very good, and the subtleties are woven well into the dialogue.  I'm still
thinking about certain scenes.  It has certainly made me look at things
differently.
The story centers on Michael Farraday (Bridges) whose wife, an FBI agent,
was killed two years previously in a botched raid on terrorists.  Now, in
his college classes his frustrations about her death reflect in his
teachings.  His relationship with a former student Brooke Wolfe, (Davis)
is somewhat strained, partly because his son, Grant (Clark) cannot accept
her presence in the family unit. 
One day Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Robbins and Cusack) `happen' to move into
his neighborhood, or is this accidental?  Farrady begins to question who
they are and why they are there. He feels that Oliver is hiding things and
that his work as an engineer is a cover-up.  He calls upon his wife's
former partner Whit Carver (Gossett) for assistance in delving into Lang's
past.  Is it paranoia or are his suspicions real?  
Although you will probably guess what happens, the ending will still make
you thinka lotafter you leave the theater.  That makes it worth seeing. 
I give it a very strong B+, because I definitely wanted to see it again,
and I'm glad I did.

Title
Review for Insider, The (1999)
Starring:        Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, etc.
There are numerous familiar faces in this movie.  The list is goes on and
on so part of the enjoyment of the film is noticing who is in which role. 
The Insider has such an important storyline that a large group of
well-known actors wanted to be part of it.
At first you might think that this is the story of how the tobacco
industry has successfully kept the smoking public thinking that cigarettes
are non-addictive.  That's not it.  It also is the story of how big
business can, and does control the media.  But even that is not the true
plot line.  It's really the story of two men, Lowell Bergman (Pacino) and
Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe) and the integrity that each man has.  
Bergman is a producer on `60 Minutes' who is always on the lookout for a
big story.  When he convinces someone, anyone, to allow him to cover a
story, he promises to protect the person, and he means it.
Wigand is a former executive research officer at Brown & Williamson who
knows that they actually add substances to insure addiction.  When they
fire him he must agree to a confidentiality contract prohibiting him from
telling what he knows.  In return, B & W bestows upon him a good severance
program including much needed insurance that will insure his daughter's
asthma treatments.
When a movie is based on fact, as this one is, the producers cannot take
liberties with actual events.  People cannot be portrayed as acting in a
way other than what they truly did.  So, when they show Wigand's wife,
Liane, (portrayed by Diane Venora) crumbling under the outside pressures,
you get a good look at how difficult their lives became.
As we were leaving the screening almost everyone said that same thing: It
is a good movie, but longer than it should be.  I can't think of any scene
that should be omitted, but they could have edited out a lot of the
lingering moments.
Every actor in the film is terrific.  There is already talk that Plummer
will probably be nominated for best supporting actor.  We'll see. 
Personally, I loved Russell Crowe and I'm glad to see him coming into his
own.  I liked him so much in `Mystery Alaska'.  This is a very different
role for him.
I give the film an A.  I don't know how it got an `R' rating.   The only
objectionable thing I remember was a single use of F---!

Title
Review for Down in the Delta (1998)
Do not dismiss Down in the Delta as a `black' film.  The feeling of
family that it portrays applies to any and all ethnic groups. It is only
the specific connection to slavery that sets it apart.
Alfre Woodard, as Loretta Sinclair, stars in a role that deserves an
Academy Award nomination.  She is the unemployed and unmarried mother of a
10 year old son, Thomas, and a 4 year old, autistic daughter, Tracy.  She
lives in Chicago with her widowed mother RosaLynn Sinclair.  Loretta's
sense of hopelessness is obvious as she turns to liquor and marijuana to
make it from day to day.
Unexpectedly RosaLynn receives a letter from her brother-in-law, Earl
Sinclair, who lives in Biloxi.  It seems that there have been bad feelings
between RosaLynn and Earl because of `Nathan'.
In desperation, hoping that life away from Chicago's crime-ridden streets
can help her daughter and grandchildren, RosaLynn sends them to Biloxi, a
`dry' area, for the summer.  She believes that Loretta can work for Earl
in his chicken restaurant and regain some self-esteem.
Upon arrival in Biloxi they are surprised to learn that Earl's wife,
Annie, is in the final stages of Alzheimer's.    Esther Rolle could
possibly be nominated for best Supporting Actress posthumously.  She is
totally believable as the delicate Annie.
Wesley Snipes is listed in the credits as a co-Executive Producer, as
well as appearing in a relatively small role as Earl and Anne's successful
lawyer son.   There are numerous supporting roles worthy of recognition by
other family members as by Loretta Devine as Aunt Annie's companion.
Maya Angelou, in her directorial debut, creates a film as beautiful as
her poetry.  It is only in the final montage that her direction falters. 
The last few scenes are anti-climatic and unnecessary.  It is because of
this that I give it an A-.  I hope that it gets the recognition that it
deserves.

Title
Review for Dancing at Lughnasa (1998)
        This is definitely an ensemble film.  Because of it, Meryl Streep is
miscast.  Her fame calls for her character to be bigger and stronger than
the others, but it's not and it shouldn't be.
This is a lovely story of the Mundy family, a group of sisters and their
brother, as told through the eyes of the boy, Michael.
The sisters live simple lives with average jobs such as teaching and
factory work.  They live together in their parental home.  None of them
are married although Michael is the result of an affair by Christina. 
Rose is attracted to a married man.
Their brother Jack, a Catholic priest, has come back home from Africa as
a missionary after suffering a breakdown.   Shortly thereafter the boy's
father, Gerry Evans, comes back into their lives.
The movie is based on the Broadway play.  Although it garnered many 
Tony nominations, I doubt that it will attract any Academy Award votes.  
It's a nice story told in a delightful way.  There is nothing
objectionable portrayed although some people may take offense at the
actions of some of the characters.
Lughnasa is not a location, but rather a festival to Lugh, the harvest
deity, the God of Music and Light.  Knowing this helps explain some of the
actions.
Because the movie is fairly slow moving with little plot, I give it a C.

Title
Review for Mickey Blue Eyes (1999)
Starring:        Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn, James Caan
Mickey Blue Eyes is a very funny movie, and what makes it so funny is
that very few of the laugh lines have been shown in the previews and
promotional clips.  That's especially amazing because Hugh Grant has been
seen `everywhere' extolling the virtues of this latest picture,
co-produced by his girlfriend, Elizabeth Hurley.  Too many movies lately
have been ruined by the overexposure of the `funny' scenes.  They are like
connect-the-dot puzzles that tell you all.  You simply have to put them in
the proper order.
With Mickey Blue Eyes you are aware of the basic storyline.  Hugh Grant
plays a square type of individual.   He is an auctioneer who has fallen in
love with Gina, an elementary school teacher (Tripplehorn).  He proposes
marriage, in a hilarious scene that's stolen by the Chinese
waitress.whoops, that's ownerwho involves herself in the proposal.  
It's vignettes like this that make you think about small `supporting
actress' possibilities.  
He discovers that his possible future father-in-law, Frank (Caan) is a
member of the mob, who `launders' money for them.  It is the merging of
the two lifestyles that gives us the wonderful basis of the film.  This is
not award winning movie making by any means but it is a very enjoyable
film, well worth the price of admission.  Although it is rated PG-13, I
really don't think that it's aimed at children.  There's nothing so bad
that they shouldn't see it, but it's not an example of what they should
emulate.  Rather than taking the kids to it, go by yourself and sit back
and laugh.  I really want to see this again, but it's probably one of
those flicks that I'll catch on free TV and watch more than once.  For
what it is, I give it an A-, an excellent light, romantic comedy.

Title
Review for Music of the Heart (1999)
The fact that this movie is rated PG will probably work against it.  Too
many people will think that it would be drab and boring.  It's not. 
Actually, there is violence (a killing), racial bigotry, and sex among
other things.  There isn't anyone who won't identify with someone in this
film.  If you've ever struggled with practice to learn to play any
instrument, or if you've had to listen to someone else practice, you will
sympathize with that actor.
Basically, this is true story of a woman, Roberta Guaspari (Streep) who
teaches violin in a Harlem school.  Sure, you know where the storyline is
going.  If she didn't succeed, they wouldn't have made the film, now would
they?  But this is the story of the road she takes to achieve her goal. 
She teaches her pupils, their parents, and the staff much more than how to
play the violin.   She also helps her two sons overcome the problems that
accompany her divorce from their father.  They manage to grow into
upstanding young men despite the living conditions that are thrust upon
them.
I wish that movies such as this were compulsory for children to see.  We
re all aware of the multiple problems facing today's youth.  Some of it
is addressed here, such as the racial tension that exists between Ramon, a
Hispanic boy and his classmate, an African-American.  Their classroom
argument ends with Ramon telling the other boy to drop dead.  That
evening, when the boy is killed by a drive-by shooting, Ramon feels
responsible for his death.  Roberta reassures Ramon that if he had such
powers, he would be the world's greatest violinist!  More important, if we
are not exposed to good, classical music when we are young; we miss out on
one of the most pleasurable things in life.  No, liking the classics does
not make you a nerd.it makes you a more well rounded person.  This is
truly a `feel-good' movie.  Give yourself a treat and see it.  It's an A,
all the way.  I could see it over and over again.

Title
Review for Misérables, Les (1998)
In the movie theater, prior to the screening, a trivia statement appeared
on the screen.  It said that Les Miserables was the first full-length
motion  picture filmed in America, in 1809.   Now if that was so Victor
Hugo would have been writing science fiction    because the story begins
in 1812 after  Jean Valjean has served 19 years in prison, and continues
for another 20 years.  The date should have read 1909.   Some later
versions have been 1913 [France], 1918 [US], 1922 [ GB], 1925 [France],
1934 [France] 1935 {US - with Fredric March and Charles Laughton], 1946
[Italy], 1952 [US - Michael Rennie and Robert Newton] and 1957 [France]. 
And, there is the musical version.
The trivia statement also said that the current version stars Geoffrey
Rush.  When did Javert become the main role?    Perhaps it was because we
get to know Javert a bit better in this rendition than in others.  His
admission that his father was a thief and his mother was a prostitute
helps us understand more fully his reactions to Valjean, Fantine, and
Cosette.
Unless you have read the very long book by Victor Hugo, you will have
different memories of the main and sub-plots as they unfold.  It was
interesting to me that an unusual number of people got up and left the
theater for short times.  When I went outside, because I started coughing,
I spoke with a couple of people.  They  said that they  knew the plot well
enough to miss a bit of it.  That does not speak well for a film.  How
many went outside during Titanic, because they knew the ending?
A brief synopsis is that Valjean had served 19 years in hard labor for
stealing food because he was hungry.  After his release he is shunned by
most people except for a bishop who gives him a second chance in life. 
Ten years later, in 1822, he owns a factory and is the mayor of Vigau,
living a quiet life.  
Javert, who was a guard at the prison, is assigned to Vigau and thinks
that he recognizes Valjean, although he's not certain.  
Working at Valjean's factory is Fantine who is an unwed mother.  Her
daughter, Cosette, is living with a foster family, The Thenardiers, who
treat the child poorly and overcharge Fantine for her keep.  Fantine turns
to prostitution but becomes ill.  Valjean takes her into his care and
promises her, on her deathbed, that he will protect Cosette and raise her
as his own.
As Javert closes in, Valjean and Cosette leave Vigau and take refuge in a
convent elsewhere, but when Cosette grows to be a young woman she does not
wish to become a nun.  She longs to learn of the world outside of the
convent walls.  During one of her first ventures into those unfamiliar
surroundings she falls in love with a young political activist, Marius.  
The conclusion combines an attempted rebellion, Javert's pursuit, Marius'
injury, and what destiny holds in store for all of them.
Marius was the big disappointment.  He came across as a wimp.  It had to
be Cosette's lack of knowledge that attracted her to him.  She could have
done so much better.   I don't feel that anyone, with the exception of
Fantine, was portrayed as well as possible.  There were times that I
should have been brought to tears, and I wasn't.  Perhaps it was because
August and Yglesias tried to condense the plot too much.  Only the scenes
with the Bishop, or the ones with Fantine moved me.   What should have
been a memorable motion picture was simply a good one.  Instead of wanting
to see it again, I'd like to see another  version  or re-read the book.
Because it does have so many redeeming features including costumes and
locations, I give it a B.  I wish it had been an A.

Title
Review for Mummy, The (1999)
In the first scenes of the movie, when the Pharaoh's mistress appears,
you get the impression that this is not a movie for children.  But, you'd
be wrong.  Her `dress' is alluring, but it's only provocative, not
revealing.  For a few seconds, you think that she and her lover could be
the `good guys' but they are not.  This guy is NOT the Pharaoh.    She is
slain for being unfaithful, and her organs are removed and placed into
five jars.  Then, her lover becomes the Mummy of the title when he is
wrapped in gauze and put into a sarcophagus, with a jugful of roaches, and
buried.
Does this sound like a movie for kids?  Well, it is.  Throughout the
movie I kept thinking that my nine-year old grandson will love it.  There
are interesting moments as they dutifully explain the mummification
process.  It is not a great film by any account, but I'll bet that it will
become a favorite with young boys (and girls) all over.  When my children
were that age, they totally enjoyed a movie where the good guys battled
skeletons.  I think that it was `The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad' or such.  I
really didn't think that it was a very good film, but they talk about it
to this day.  The Mummy is that kind of film.  It makes you think of
`Raiders of the Lost Ark' and Brendan Fraser is very reminiscent of
Harrison Ford instead of being a cartoon character like George of the
Jungle. 
When movies such as the original Mummy and Frankenstein were made many
years ago, you knew that such events couldn't really happen, but they
scared you to death.  Too many films today show shootings, explosions, and
other mayhem to `entertain' you, but unfortunately, they could happen.  
That really scares me.    The Mummy is a fun, scary movie.  You know that
something is going to jump out at you, but you enjoy it.  The woman behind
me let out a scream that embarrassed her, but she was scared!  
You won't recognize most of the actors by name, but you'll remember
seeing them `somewhere'.  They are all excellent in their roles.  They
also reminded me of old-time actors like Peter Lorre, and J. Carroll Nash.
 It is well worth your time.  Take your kids and grandkids, and let
yourself just be entertained without analyzing the production values.

Title
Review for Jane Austen's Mafia! (1998)
Mafia is touted as another in the Naked Gun/Airplane genre.  It tries, but
it doesn't quite make it.  It's a takeoff of the Godfather series, Casino,
Goodfellas, and Forrest Gump!
Jerry Mohr is the lead character, the good  son who is destined to head
the family business.   Lloyd Bridges, in his final film role, plays the
godfather.  He actually seems spryer than his stunt doubles.
The main fun in these parodies is looking for all the little things, such
as a ship named IL Pacino.  Personally, I don't see anything funny about
"Rocks 1_".  I was trying to think of some of the clever things to list
here, but the problem is, I can't remember any.  Oh, yeah, there are
references to O.J.Simpson, Lyle Menandez and other "names".  And there are
some funny sight gags, but in all it is a disappointment.  I had hoped for
more.  The only way that I'd watch this again is if it's on free TV, late
at night, and I can't sleep.

Title
Review for Very Bad Things (1998)
The main reason that Christian Slater has the Star billing is that he
also has credit as one of the Executive Producers.  This is definitely an
ensemble film.  If anyone is the star, it isn't Slater.
Cameron Diaz is the bride and Jon Favreau is the groom.  Although the
opening scenes are immediately before the ceremony, the action quickly
moves back a couple of days, focusing on the bachelor party in Las Vegas. 
The five male buddies are in their hotel room when a stripper arrives. 
Her rousing dance is too much for Jeremy Piven who accompanies her to the
big marble bathroom.  In a moment of passion, he accidentally kills her. 
It's a very startling scene.  From that moment on, their lives change
forever.  Instead of calling the front desk and the police to explain the
accident, they agree to Slater's suggestions for disposing of the body.
Supposedly it is humorous to see bodies sawed into pieces and packed into
suitcasesor to see brother attack brother, with a caror blood
everywhere.  The term `black humor' seems to mean that if bad taste is
funny, then it will be even funnier if it's in dreadful taste.  
There are some very funny scenes mingled with the scenes that make you
squeamish.  Cameron Diaz is delightful as the Bride, playing with tiny
little tables and chairs to decide the reception seating arrangement.  You
almost feel sorry for her when Daniel Stern and Jeanne Tripplehorn's
children overturn the entire project.  Speaking of Tripplehorn, she plays
her part with flair, and a lot of gumption.  You're really pulling for her.
I really can't recommend this film for the older generation, although
most of the under-forty audience will probably love it.  I don't want to
see it again.  I give it a C-.

Title
Review for Tango (1998)
This is a foreign language film, with subtitles.  That doesn't matter at
all.  You could enjoy this movie just by listening to the music.  The name
Lalo Schifrin is synonymous with wonderful music.  Add the tango to it and
you have a mesmerizing combination.   The world-renowned cinematographer
Vittorio Storaro [Apocalypse Now] has centered on various close-ups of
feet, the piano, etc.  The color is vivid.  Everything about the movie is
great - except for the story.
There are so many things going on that the plot is impossible to follow. 
It jumps from real life, to imagination, to memories, to history, and back
and forth.  Miguel Angel Sola portrays Mario Saurez, a director who walks
with a cane. We're never certain whether the leg injury is permanent or
not.  Cecilia Narova is Laura Fuentes, a dancer who was either his wife,
his girlfriend, or his dancing partner.  She is lovely and is a fabulous
dancer, especially when she is with Juan Carlos Copes who portrays Carlos
Nebbia,  an older dancer who continues to do what he lovesthe Tango.
Mia Maestro is cast as the new young dancer, Elena Flores, a `friend' of
Mario's investor, Angelo Larroca [Juan Luis Galiardo] who convinces Mario
to give the girl a chance.    He gives her more than that!   They have
some fairly torrid love scenes despite the danger that they face if Angelo
discovers their affair.  Again, even that is confusing.  He imagines
things, and some things actually occur.  It's just impossible to know
which is which.  Luckily, most of these scenes are done in dance, the
Tango.  This is more like a ballet or an opera than a movie with music and
dancing.  It's beautiful.  I wouldn't mind seeing it again, but I know
that I want to get the CD of the music.  I give it a B.

Title
Review for Bulworth (1998)
More than once the title of this movie is misspelled as Bullworth.  Now,
there has to be a reason that people think it's Bull!  The movie itself
certainly isn't.  It's right on!  I guess it's because it has to do with
politics and that's what most of us have come to associate with
politics....Bull!
Warren Beatty has written, produced and directed another unusual film.  It
begins with  Beatty as  J.Billington Bulworth,  running for re-election 
and showing signs of being a man on the edge.   He's had enough!  He
doesn't want to go on.   So, he makes a deal with an insurance company
executive [Paul Sorvino] to block a bill that is detrimental to Sorvino's
company.  In exchange, he will insure Bulworth's life for $10 million
dollars, payable to his daughter, not his wife.  Why, you wonder?
Next, Bulworth makes arrangements, through his friend, Jack Warden,  for a
"hit" to be made, on himself.   He is not to know the identity of the
assassin.
Once everything is set, he goes to a church in the ghetto to deliver that
dull speech that we heard repeated over and over at the film's beginning. 
Suddenly he seems to realize that  he has nothing to lose so he says
exactly what's on his mind.   This starts the chain of events that make up
the plot.  Unlike Jim Carrey in "Liar, Liar", Bulworth doesn't have to
tell the truth.  He simply says whatever comes to mind, and as time
passes, he says it in rap!
His change of behavior [and wardrobe] affects many lives.  His campaign
manager begins to change before our eyes.  Halle Berry's character is the
one that disappoints us.  She has too many sides to her personality.  I
couldn't believe her actions.  Of course, she had to be there for the love
interest.  Hey, when you're going for way out, why not put a 26 year old
black female opposite a 60 year old male? 
What do we think about Bulworth's interest in Halle?  His wife, portrayed
by Christine Baranski,  is shown as a shallow, class-conscious female who
is having an affair.    Of course that means that we should approve his
desire for Halle.  Christine is perfect for the part, but she's wasted in
the film.  I would have liked to have seen more of her and her reactions
to Bulworth's antics.
This is not a film that is going to go down in film history.  It doesn't
have the oomph of "Wag The Dog", although it wants to be.   I did find
that the mixed ethnic audience viewing the screening all seemed to laugh
at the same places.  Maybe films like this are bringing us closer together.

Review for For Love of the Game (1999)
Starring:        Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston, John C. Reilly
This is the third time at bat for Kevin Costner in a movie centering on
baseball.  Bull Durham and Field of Dreams were both memorable features,
but For Love of the Game isn't up to his batting average.  The movie
doesn't exactly strike outIt's more of a balk.  In his defense, it is
obvious that Costner loves baseball and he is quite good at it.  The home
movies at the beginning of the film are actual home movies of him as he
played catch with his father and went on to become a little league player. 
The storyline begins when Costner, as the forty-year-old pitcher Billy
Chapel is faced with the question of retirement.   He is scheduled to
pitch in this final game of the season for the Detroit Tigers, his team
for his entire eighteen-year career.  It is basically a `throwaway' game. 
They are out of contention for the title.  The only reason for winning is
to beat those New York Yankees.  The camaraderie between Chapel and his
catcher, Gus Osinski played wonderfully by John C. Reilly, is the real
`feel-good' part of the movie.  They understand each other. 
This could have been a much better movie if they had concentrated on the
baseball and ignored the love interest.  There was absolutely no charisma
between Costner and Kelly Preston, who plays Jane Aubrey, his girl-friend
of five years who decides to leave him on this crucial day.  
We keep suffering through flashbacks of how they met, fought, made up,
fought again, etc.  Even at the end of the film, the affair isn't really
resolved.  It's just too syrupy, too sweet, and too long.
All in all, it's a fairly good movie.  There's nothing offensive about
it.  There is a shot of Costner in his jockey shorts, but there's no
nudity.    Billy and Jane sleep together, but there are no sex scenes. 
The only touchey-feeley is when the manager pats him on the butt during
the game.
If you like baseball, you will like this film, mainly because of some
novel scenes, such as the times when the roar of the crowd is silenced and
you hear Billy mentally talking to the batters.  I do want to see this
again and I want my husband to see it.  I give it a B+.

Title
Review for Wrongfully Accused (1998)
Written, Produced and Directed by Pat Proft
Thinking about this movie brings to mind the phrase "Jack of All Trades,
Master of None".  They have tried to make a movie that will appeal to
everyone and ends up appealing to no one, except maybe a few 13-14 year
olds who go to a lot of movies.  The majority of the script depends on
satirizing other films.  If you haven't seen them, you probably won't
catch the jokes.  Obviously, there's The Fugitive, but there's also
Titanic, Braveheart, Mission Impossible, and many, many others.  Trying to
figure out which movie is being portrayed is most of the fun.  And, it is
fun to study the wonderful props that are used.
Too much sexual innuendo prevents this from being a children's film,
although some of it is subtle enough to go right over their heads.  There
is a scene, for example, when Lauren Goodhue [LeBrock] "prepares" a cigar
by licking it, and Ryan Harrison [Nielsen] causes the drawer to open. 
It's too childish to appeal to many adults, because many of the jokes are
aimed at those viewers who are just discovering puberty.  Sadly, some of
the funniest bits are missed by many.  They are in the closing credits. 
They list everyone including: party guest out of focus [Ingrid
Henningsen], fainting pedestrian [Barbaree Earl Nielsen], and Wanted
poster boy [Jason Payn].  They list winning lottery numbers.  Credit is
given to: Director's favorite lunch on a cold, rainy day_.grilled cheese
sandwich and tomato soup.
There is a credit for Interns We allegedly all had sex with_.list upon
request.  I liked "Best Boy on Batteries: Mike Sweeney" and Groped: Patty
Sachs.  Then, they proceed to list "Today's Menu", complete with prices. 
They also include   "no one cares about the following people" and names
twenty.  They include things that were stolen, and people in the crew who
smuggled Cuban Cigars out of Canada.  The way closing credits go on and on
these days, it's difficult to figure out which are the jokes.  At one
point it's stated "This movie costs less than Michael Jordan makes in a
year".  It shows!

Title
Review for Jenseits der Stille (1996)
There is much said today about dysfunctional families.   BEYOND SILENCE
shows us a family that truly has that distinction.  The story centers on
the life of a young girl named Lara who is born to deaf parents, Martin
and Kai.  Lara becomes their link to the hearing world, making telephone
calls, and interpreting for them, including the dialogue of romantic
movies for her mother. 
But the story is much deeper than that.  Martin has a sister, Clarissa,
who has another set of problems.  Not only can Clarissa hear, but she is
an accomplished clarinetist.  Her life has been affected by Martin's
deafness, so when she introduces Lara to the clarinet, and music, her
motivation is questioned.
Martin and Kai have another daughter, eight or ten years younger than
Lara, who isn't too interested in becoming another translator, although
she "speaks" the language.
When Lara becomes eighteen, she is torn by the choices that she could or
should make about her life.  Can she pursue her music?  Must she remain as
her parents' bridge to the outside world?  Will she have a life of her
own?  
This movie is so very tastefully done.  It is in German, with subtitles  
It is strange in one scene, where a music professor speaks English and the
subtitles are in English as well.  Because the Main language of the film
is often sign language, it crosses the language barriers very well.
although you can get confused at times as to whether the subtitles are
translating the spoken or the signed words.
There is nudity and sensuality, but it is in no way offensive.   There is
only one word that is even slightly questionable, in German or in English.
Not only is the acting  superb, the lead actors seem to be fluent in sign
language as well.  They are very believable, including the actress who
plays the young Lara.  I kept thinking to myself that this is a movie that
I hope is nominated for best foreign language film, for both "foreign"
languages.
I do want to see this again, especially with my grandson who attends a
school that teaches sign language to hearing children.   I might even buy
this if it comes out on video. I have to give it an A-.

Review for Right to Remain Silent, The (1996) (TV)
How this movie got produced, and released, and faded into obscurity
without me hearing about it is a wonder.  I happened upon it this weekend
at Blockbuster.  It only cost $2.00 to rent, too.  On the Blockbuster box
it said Drama, not rated.  On the actual box, it was a comedy, rated R.
In actuality, it's a series of vignettes, connected by a  Police Captain,
[Robert Loggia] and a rookie cop [Lea Thompson] who have the job of
booking the people arrested on one shift.
The film is a Drama, and it's a Comedy, too.  And, it probably is an R. 
It's not a children's movie, but it might be beneficial for teens to see. 
They cover murder, drunk driving, hate crimes, homelessness, euthanasia,
Aids, and cross-dressing.  
Every scene makes you think.  There is excellent dialogue, and there are
marvelous monologues.  If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend
it.  And, if you have seen it, when and where?
See you at the movies [or the video store].

Title
Review for Lethal Weapon 4 (1998)
If there is any doubt that this sequel is not up to the original, forget
it.  It's every bit as good, if not better.  There is no problem if you're
one of the few people who didn't see any of the first three movies.  You
easily learn who the characters are and how they relate to each other.  In
its own way Lethal Weapon 4 reminds me of the old "Road" movies, or the
Abbott and Costello series.  Each one is able to stand on its own, but you
know the characters and you feel that you were watching old friends.  In
this  episode there are two new figures to entertain us.  One, Jet Li, is
a thing of beauty to behold.  As the cool, controlled bad guy, he moves
with the grace of a ballet dancer but the malice of the deadly killer that
he is.  The other, Chris Rock, becomes a continuing character as the new
son-in-law of Murtagh [Danny Glover].  Chris, like Joe Pesci, utters most
of the foul language in the film.  Strangely, it becomes comical when
Pesci tries to talk without swearing so that he can be quoted on TV. 
It is enjoyable  when seemingly unimportant scenes suddenly tie in and
become parts of the story.  If you catch them early enough, you have a
feeling of pride that you figured them out before they're explained.  
It's also great to be in on the joke, such as when Danny Glover thinks
that Chris Rock is gay, but we know that he is his son-in-law.
Although some of the stunts are highly improbable, they are nonetheless
entertaining.  By now, you've probably seen most of them on clips on TV. 
Even though you know that they are stunts and that everyone will survive,
they are still harrowing.  The fire is almost too real.
This is a very violent film with some stomach turning scenes.  The
garroting and the lancing made most adults grimace with pain.  As always,
there is plenty of humor surrounding the stars.  The chicken sequence is a
memorable on-running gag.  There are many, many moments that you keep
remembering.  That is the mark of a truly entertaining movie.  You keep
thinking about it.  I definitely want to see it again.

Title
Review for Playing by Heart (1998)
Playing by Heart has something for everyone.  There's a love story for
just about every age of viewer.   Unfortunately, that's also its main
drawback.  If you identify with one couple, you'll probably be bored or
upset by another one of the stories.  It does show how much the problems
facing lovers have changed.  The oldest couple, played by Sean Connery and
Gena Rowlands, fell in love and grew older without the issues facing the
younger lovers.   Their main concern centers on a possible affair that he
may have had numerous years before.    Most of the younger couples must
face AIDS or homosexuality, all too prevalent in today's society.  
Remarks have been made that the dialogue wasn't real; that no one really
speaks that way.   Strange because Connery and Rowlands spoke just like my
husband and I speak.  In fact, there is at least one `joke' that we
created over 40 years ago and have used often every since.  It is when
Sean says that "he never knew what true happiness was until he got
married.then it was too late!'
As to the younger couples, I couldn't help wonder what some of them saw
in each other.  Angelina Jolie (Jon Voight's daughter) stands out as a
free spirited, fun-loving club-goer.  Her initial attraction to Ryan
Phillippe seems odd.  He seems like such a loser that I questioned whether
she would have given him a second glance.  As she got to know him, he does
become more loveable.
The most desirable of the guys has to be Jon Stewart.  Again, I wonder
what he saw in Gillian Anderson enough to endure the pangs of the courting
process.  Randy Quaid's role is bizarre and seems a strange choice for
him.  Anthony Edwards' scenes are mostly in bed or the bedroom, and he
isn't all that likeable.  There's not enough nudity or sex scenes to
disturb anyone.
A different type of love story is the one between Ellen Burstyn and Jay
Mohr as a mother and son.  It is filled with memorable moments.  The
`game' that they play might be beneficial to a lot of people who are
hiding deep dark secrets in their lives.
It's not a great movie.  It's not a bad movie.  I wouldn't mind seeing it
again, but I'll probably wait until it's on free TV.  I give it a B-.

Title
Review for Armageddon (1998)
If you're into explosions and destruction, there's a lot  in this film. 
It's another one of those "blow up the world" movies that have been done
many times before.   Every cliche that you've ever seen is here including
the "which color  wire do I cut?" scene.  It is totally predictable.  The
familiar format makes us ask, "Which of the supporting cast members will
die?"   You know what's coming before it happens.  But, I liked it.  Most
of the people who do, are females.  Hey, I even cried, even though I
expected the finale.  But I laughed, too, at some very funny lines.
Men, on the other hand, are more technical and more skeptical.  Truly, who
WOULD risk the future of the planet to Bruce Willis and a group of oil
drillers?  Surely, some other nation  would have had an alternate plan, or
would they really  all follow the lead of the good old US?  The big
question here is: Would it be easier to train astronauts to be drillers,
or drillers to be astronauts?  Or couldn't there have been half and half?
For me, this movie was pure escapism.  No, it isn't artistic.  It isn't
well-written or well-acted.   But for what it is, a "blow 'em up" movie. 
I really liked it.  I give it a B+.  And, I would definitely watch it
again.

Title
Review for Next Stop Wonderland (1998)
This is one of those titles, like Good Will Hunting,  that I have trouble
remembering.  Is it just a coincidence that both films are set in the
Boston area?  When you realize that Wonderland is one of the stops on the
transit line, it makes sense.  
A winner at the Sundance Film festival, it deserves the award.  This
really seems like a home movie and that is a sincere compliment.  Unlike
mainstream productions we see the faces of the players complete with
imperfections rather than coats of makeup.  Their hair, beards, clothes,
etc. are like those of real everyday people. It makes it that much easier
to believe that these are real everyday people.
Hope Davis plays Erin Castleton, a nurse who discovers that her live-in
political fanatic beau is leaving her, again.  
Alan Gelfant plays Alan Montiero, an aspiring marine biologist who has
been working as a plumber for his father.
Both Erin and Alan have problems with their parents, their friends, and
their lives.  Throughout the movie you see how close that the two come to
meeting, but they always manage to just miss each other.  And, you do want
them to meet.  Erin's mother places an ad in the Personals column hoping
that someone will answer who will save her daughter from a lonely life. 
Goodness knows, the mother isn't lonely!
Alan's buddies answer the ad, but he doesn't.  Entwined are stories of
political corruption, gambling and the debts that they cause, the media
attention to a balloon fish, an inept security guard, and a wonderful
sound track featuring great piano jazz.  Most of us stayed through the
credits, mainly to hear the music.
Unlike Good Will Hunting, this film has absolutely NO bad language, NO
nudity, NO sex, but plenty of good feelings.  It's excellent.  I can't
stop thinking about it.  And, I want to see it again.
I'll only give it a B, however, because it is too much like a home movie. 
There was a lot of editing that was just too distracting.  It was as if
they hadn't shot enough film to make the necessary cuts.  I wonder what
they would have done with a bigger budget.

Title
Review for Patch Adams (1998)
There really is a Hunter `Patch' Adams, a doctor who has the Gesundheit
Institute in West Virginia where he treats people for free.  In order to
raise funds to continue his work, he wrote a book about his life, which
has now become a movie.   He was very insistent that he be portrayed for
what he isa loving caring and very eccentric doctor.  He couldn't have had
anyone portray him better than Robin Williams.
The story is delightful from beginning to end.  The first scenes, set in
a mental hospital are explosive.  What might have been a deep brooding
scene becomes hysterical as young Patch pokes fun at a catatonic patient. 
The following scenes with Michael Jeter are even funnier.
It is not all fun and games, however, as we follow Patch through his
years at Medical school.  Rules are not for him.  Everything seems too
slow, too impersonal.  While touring the hospital he is dismayed that
people are referred to by their bed number, or their illness rather than
by a name.  He truly cares about people and they know it.  Impossible
patients become nicer just by knowing him.  Sometimes they get better. 
Sometimes they don't.  
In school he is attracted to another student, Carin,  but she is not
responsive to Patch and his poor study habits.  She dreams of being a
doctor and her education is all that is important.  
This is definitely a MUST SEE movie.  It s one of the best that I've
seen in years, and it's wholesome.  It makes you feel so good.  It
definitely should be nominated for Best Picture, and Robin Williams for
Best Actor and  I hope that they win.      I give it a strong A+.

Title
Review for Femme de chambre du Titanic, La (1997)
        The popularity of the TITANIC may help attract audiences to this film,
the full title of which is The Chambermaid on the Titanic.  But this is a
totally different type of love story than that shared between Leonardo and
Kate.  This French-Spanish-Italian joint effort is in French, with English
subtitles.  It is the story of a young married couple, living strenuous
lives, working in a foundry.  
        The owner, lusting after the wife, Zoe, arranges for the young husband,
Horty, to win a trip to England where he will witness the initial sailing
of the ill-fated Titanic.  He hopes that while the husband is away, he can
have his way with her.
        In England, Horty befriends a beautiful French girl who calls herself
Marie.  She cannot find a room in the overfilled city.  He offers to let
her share his room.
        The next morning, she is gone.  He goes to the pier and sees her on
board.  A photographer has taken a tintype of the beauty.  After the ship
sails, Horty prevails upon the photographer to let him have the photo.
        Upon returning home, he hears rumors that, during his absence, the owner
did have a clandestine affair with the wife.  When the owner suddenly
gives Horty a large promotion, he realizes that it must be true.
        Later, at the local bar, Horty tells his friends about Marie and their
time together, adding to the reality with highly imaginative additions. 
His audience grows and he becomes a local hero_.a highly esteemed
storyteller, so much so that he becomes an actor, touring the country with
his ever-growing story.  There is a very surprising ending.  The script is
quite contrived and even ridiculous in spots, but there are many
fascinating scenes.   I found the acting to be very good.
        I give it a C+.

Title
Review for You've Got Mail (1998)
In 1940 Ernst Lubitsch directed a memorable film entitled `The Shop
Around the Corner'.  It starred James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan as
lonelyheart penpals in a Budapest notions shop.  In 1949 is was remade by
MGM as a musical starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson entitled `In the
Good Old Summertime'.  Then it became the Broadway musical `She Loves Me'.
Bringing it up to the computer age, You've Got Mail stands on its own as
an original story, not as merely a re-make.  Two people accidentally
meeting in cyberspace is not the same as lonelyheart penpals.  These two
did not go looking for someone out of desperation.  Each is supposedly
happy with a significant other.  
Joe Fox [Hanks], the scion of a mega-bookstore family, lives with
Patricia Eden [Posey] a dynamic woman executive.  Kathleen Kelly [Ryan],
the owner of `The Shop Around The Corner', is in a relationship with Frank
Navasky [Kinnear] Each of them have frustrations in their lives and they
find a little bit of solace in each other when on the Internet.  There is
no intention to meet, or to break up their relationships.  Each day they
pass within footsteps of each other, not realizing that she is `Shopgirl'
or that he is `NY152', their Internet names.
There are so many interesting sub-plots in the film.  The Fox family
would be the basis of a hilarious movie on their own.  And, there's the
love story involving Birdie [Stapleton] and her Spanish lover.  Each and
every character is well presented.  You care about them all.  When the Fox
family causes the demise of Kelly's bookstore, you are genuinely concerned
about the future of the employees.  
The film's ending doesn't hit you over the head as to what course their
lives will take, but you can figure it out all by yourself.  Brinkley is a
nice touch, too.
It will be referred to as a `chick' movie, or a date movie, but it is
truly a good, old-fashioned love story.  I could see it over and over, on
TV.   I give it a B+.

Title
Review for Jakob the Liar (1999)
Jakob, the Liar, Starring  Robin Williams, Alan Arkin, Bob Balaban, Hannah
Taylor-Gordon, Michael Jeter, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Liev Schreiver.
Directed by Peter Kassovitz
It is not an easy task to dramatize a sad and depressing time in
history.  Last year's Life is Beautiful was able to teach a lesson about
the holocaust through laughter.  Although Robin Williams is noted for his
humor and wonderful characterizations, even he is unable to make this an
enjoyable film.
The Polish Jews depicted are not in a concentration camp, but are
residents of a ghetto where they are deprived of most essentials of life. 
They are contained in their own little space behind walls and barbed wire
fences.
Before the war Jakob Heym (Williams) was the owner of a nice little
restaurant, but lack of supplies has forced him to suspend operations and
he exists in an area above the old eatery.
Kowalsky (Balaban), the town barber, has not received a new razor blade
for years, but he manages to shave Jakob each and every day.  In return,
he was supposed to receive some now non-existent latkes from Jakob.  When
Jakob discovers that the despondent barber is about to commit suicide, he
reminds him of his promise to shave him, thereby postponing the hanging.
The lack of news from the outside world has led to depression for most of
the neighbors.  One day Jakob accidentally overhears a news broadcast that
tells of the Russian approach to their town.  He shares this announcement
with one person, who tells another, then another, and so on until everyone
know about it.  Although it is forbidden to own a radio, they all assume
that Jakob really didn't `overhear' the news.  They are certain that he
has a hidden radio.
There is a subplot involving a young refugee who finds herself in Jakob's
care.  It is she, not a radio that is hidden.
This is a dark movie, not only in content, but also in its
cinematography.  At times it is difficult to distinguish what is going on
in the numerous shadows.  This lack of contrast will only become worse
when it comes to television. 
Robin Williams and everyone else in the cast are very good in their
roles, and basically, it is a good story with an impressive ensemble. 
There is just too much depression here for me.  I don't need that.  I
won't watch it again.  For that reason, I give it a C.

Title
Review for Sleepy Hollow (1999)
Starring: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Michael Gambon, Miranda
Richardson, Christopher Walken, Christopher Lee, and many others.
        Everyone is familiar with Washington Irving's The Legend of
Sleepy Hollow, or so you think.  You know that it's the story of
Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman, isn't it?  But how much more
of the story do you remember?
        Doubtlessly, you've never heard the REAL story, the one
presented here by a very talented cast and director.
        The tale begins with blood slowly dripping onto a flat
surface, but what you think is blood is merely red sealing wax being
used to close a hand-written will.  In the next scene you see a
carriage traveling down a misty lane and you hear hoof beats
following.  There's the sudden swish of a sword.  A headless man is
now driving the coach.  Is this the headless horseman?  No, it's the
deed of the headless horseman.
        And how does Ichabod Crane come into contact with him.  Well,
he's a police detective in New York City who believes in solving
crimes by examining the evidence.  This drives his superiors crazy, so
when the homicide report comes in from Sleepy Hollow, Ichabod is
dispatched to the little town to "solve the mystery".
        This is a very good movie, but it's so involved that it's
difficult to follow the plot all the time.  In retrospect, you will
remember who was who, and who did what.  It really is a well-written
suspense story.  There are some unforgettable scenes, especially when
heads are cut off.  This motion picture could not have been made this
well without the use of computers.  To see a real actor's head rolling
across the road really enhances the crime.  I want to see it
again?.soon.  I give it an A- for sheer enjoyment, but don't take the
kids.  It's not for them.  Heads will roll!

Title
Review for Governess, The (1998)
Minnie Driver turns in another superb performance as the title character
in The Governess.  She portrays a Jewess in Victorian London who dreams of
love but, following the murder of her beloved father, she finds herself
"promised" as a wife.   Rather than marry this unwanted husband, she
places an ad in the newspaper looking for   employment.  In order to
accept a job as governess she pretends to be a gentile named Mary
Blackchurch.
At her new residence in Scotland she learns that the father of her charge
is a man of dreams who is working on a form of early photography.  It is
this quest that forms the major storyline.  Tom Wilkinson, who will be
remembered as the older member of the Full Monty troupe, portrays the
father.
In an opening scene, when a London prostitute bears her breast, you know
that there will be nudity in the film.  But, this is a true case of
artistic nudity, including full frontal nudity.  
The most memorable thing about the film, and there are many, is the
fantastic art direction.  That, combined with exquisite cinematography,
creates artistic portraits that become etched in your mind.  The wardrobe
is strikingly different, but totally fitting with the period.
There is something about this film that reminded me of "The Heiress" with
Olivia deHaviland. And, I think that you will find that there will be a
disagreement with your friends as to whether it is a happy or a sad
ending.  It's all in how you look at it.
This is an Art film in more ways than one, but it is also an excellent
study in life, religion, and love.  I hope that people recognize it for
what it is.  I will probably see it again.  I give it an B  because it did
move slowly in a couple of places.

Title
Review for Siege, The (1998)
The Siege is one of those movies that should have been better than it is. 
The concept is very good, but a very weak script keeps it from fulfilling
its potential.  Also, the casting of the `Stars' greatly affects the plot.
  To say that the movie stars Bruce Willis is a joke.  He appears in
exactly 18 scenes, briefly in an opening sequence, and then he doesn't
appear again until the second half is well underway.  When he does appear,
he almost seems to be laughing at the audience, realizing how
insignificant his role is.  It is one of those roles usually played by a
character actor.
The biggest problem seems to be that Hollywood simply doesn't want to make
a woman the star of a film like this.  If the story had been told from
Annette Bening's point of view, it could have been a superior movie.  As
it is, the viewer is totally confused, even after it's explained.  There
is no way that I can spoil the ending by revealing what transpires.  If
anything, it will help you understand what you are seeing.  We all know
that our government isn't perfect, but we hope that it's better than any
other country's way of life.  We also know that the FBI, the CIA, the
police, the Army, etc. don't tell each other what is happening, and each
wants credit for anything good that occurs, but none of them want to take
the blame.
The true question asked by The Siege is:  What happens when a country such
as the United States of America assists a government against their
oppressors and then, suddenly withdraws that support?   It also makes us
take a serious look at constitutional law.  As Americans we often take our
rights for granted.  If you can sift through the sieve [rather the siege]
you will find a moral.
There has been a lot of press about ethnic groups who object to the way
they are portrayed in the film.  I don't think that they have seen the
film yet because, it shows how ALL ethnic groups band together here in the
USA when a wrong is being done.  It is so reminiscent of what happened to
the Orientals in California following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. 
I do not want to see this movie again, although I might watch it on TV
some night just to try to see if it makes sense to me now.  I give it a C-.

Title
Review for Love Is the Devil (1998)
This is definitely an Art film, but the art is missing.  Although the
pivotal character of the movie is the renowned artist, Francis Bacon, his
estate refused to allow his work to be shown.  Instead, we are presented
with scenes showing the works during creation.
Derek Jacobi stars as the controversial artist, and he does an admirable
job in showing the many facets of the man's life.  Daniel Craig portrays
George Dyer, Bacon's model and lover.
This is a very heavy film dealing with sadism, masochism, homosexuality,
power, control, and despair.  The pain in Bacon's soul is the basis of his
art.  Although the acting and the production of the film well done, and
the subject is well represented, it is not recommended for the general
public.  Perhaps this is why the release date kept being postponed, week
after week.  Finally, it is in theaters, but only for a limited run.

Review for Bachelor, The (1999)
Starring:        Chris O'Donnell, Renee Zellweger, Artie Lange
The previews for The Bachelor had me anticipating this romantic comedy. 
The problem is, it wasn't very funny.  Oh, it has some moments of romance,
but mostly the film is filled with a lot of screaming.    Marco, the best
friend to Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell) is played by Artie Lange who is the
champion screamer in the film.  How Jimmie ever picked Marco as his best
friend is beyond me.
The movie is a remake of a Buster Keaton film from 1925 where Jimmie's
uncle dies and his will endows him with $100 million IF he is married
before his 30th birthday.   Of course, his birthday happens to be the next
day.  When he botches his proposal to the girl he loves, she leaves the
country, or so he thinks.  So, he goes on a mad chase to marry `someone'
before the deadline.  It kind of proves that he does love the money more
than he loves her, doesn't it?   Even with the money, I think that this
marriage is doomed to failure.
One of the most interesting bits is when Jimmie proposes to former
girlfriend, Buckley, a frenetic person who smokes constantly.  Her only
consideration for the marriage is the money. Her family has fallen on bad
times and with Jimmie's millions, she can redeem their status.  I kept
thinking how much the girl reminded me of Brooke Shields.  That's because
it IS Brooke Shields in one of her best acting jobs to date.  She really
got into the character.
Character actors Hal Holbrook and Ed Asner could have phoned in their
parts.  They obviously only did it for the money.like Buckley.
The only funny scenes are the ones from the preview, with the brides
chasing Jimmie through the streets of San Francisco where the producers
had advertised for extras who had their own wedding dresses.  Most of the
brides are nice normal girls in wedding dresses, but look in the crowd for
some very interesting ones.
If this movie shows up on late night, free TV, I'll probably watch those
final chase scenes to see what I may have missed.   But it can't have been
much.  I give it a C-.

Title
Review for X Files, The (1998)
It's risky to try to bring a popular TV series to the big screen.  Mainly
you're trying to give something special to the loyal viewers who are
overly familiar with the characters and most of the plot twists.  At the
same time, you want to attract and entertain those people who may not have
ever watched the show before.  How can you possibly familiarize these
'new" people without alienating those who can spout off every fact ever
shown?  However it's done, the producers have done it with The X Files.
As the feature begins you are hit with extremely technical dialogue that
makes you wonder if it'll all be like this.  But it isn't.  As different
characters come on the scene, you immediately sense whether or not the
person has an ongoing role.  Obviously, the cigarette smoking man is to be
"watched".    There is a scene where three men come to the aid of Muldar. 
You could tell by the mumbling in the audience that these three have been
seen before.  They don't explain who they are, but you feel that you know
them and that they are "good" guys.
The movie moves along at a good pace.  There is a lot of action: bombs,
chase scenes, and all the usual, but you're never quite sure what's going
on.  But then, neither are Muldar and Scully.  They have made careers of
trying to learn about things that they can't explain.  
This movie really makes you think.  When it's finally over, you're back
where you started.  You don't know what happened but it doesn't matter. 
It just makes you want to see more.  They will probably have a lot more
viewers when the new season begins.
It is a highly entertaining movie with an interesting premise.  I want to
see it again and I will definitely be watching the series.  I give it a B+.

Title
Review for Illuminata (1998)
Illuminata is especially fun if you've ever spent any time around actors.
 The ones portrayed here are almost as crazy as most of the real
performers that I know.  
John Turturro portrays the playwright, Tuccio, who will go to any
extremes to see his `Illuminata' performed on stage.  He has written it
for the love of his life, Rachel (Borowitz), a `dedicated' actress.  Ben
Gazzara is wasted as her father, the aging actor who plays all of the
`old' roles.
When an actor collapses onstage Tuccio takes the opportunity to announce
that his play will be performed the following night, much to the chagrin
of Beverly D'Angelo and her husband, the theater owners who allow the
little-rehearsed play to take place. This enables Rufus Sewell, a
self-proclaimed `star' to finally get his chance to prove it.
But, resident critic Bevalaqua (Walken) doesn't like the play and pans
everyone in it, except for Marco (Irwin) whom he desires.  The play is
cancelled.  As we follow the sexual escapades of almost everyone in the
cast it becomes quite bawdy.  Whether they are using sex to try and get
the play resumed, or if they simply have uncontrollable urges, all of them
partake in various affairs of the heart, the funniest of which is the
Walken-Irwin encounter.  
Susan Sarandon perfectly portrays a self-centered star.  When Tuccio
accuses her of putting on an act, she replies that her entire life is an
act.  When she wakes in the morning and looks in the mirror, she acts, etc.
Strange as it may seem, Beverly D'Angelo is the only female that I recall
who didn't do a topless scene, although she did do her share of romping. 
Even ro-bust Aida Turturro has a great time of presenting her huge breasts
to her willing partner.
For the most part, this movie simply shows a self-indulgent Turturro and
some of his friends getting together for a little fun.  It's not that
offensive, and it's a fairly true look at back stage life.  I might watch
it again.  I give it a C+.

Title
Review for My Favorite Martian (1999)
Anyone over the age of thirty remembers the television show, My Favorite
Martian which starred Bill Bixby and Ray Walston.  This movie is NOT a
remake of that series.  It takes place today and several changes have been
made to our Martian friends.  The biggest difference is that our new
Martian is not alone.  A silvery suit that walks and talks on its own
accompanies him.  It also has amazing powers.
A television producer/reporter named Tim O'Hara [Jeff Daniels] works with
an on-air reporter, Brace Channing [Elizabeth Hurley] whose father is
O'Hara's boss.  Another co-worker is Lizzie [Daryl Hannah].  One night,
while driving back from an assignment O'Hara sees a mysterious object
descend from the sky and come to a stop on the beach alongside him.  The
alien, who later becomes known as Uncle Martin [Christopher Lloyd], has
the ability to shrink the spaceship to the size of a toy. 
Most of the film is comprised of the ridiculous situations that an alien
encounters on earth.  The buckle on Suit's belt contains chewing gum balls
that allow the chewer to take on the characteristics of a specific planet.
Uncle Martin, who has three eyes, four arms, and such, upon landing,
chews the Earth gum. The plot is filled with dirty' kid-type humor, such
as the suit' mooning people, talk of US astronauts wetting' in their
suits, the purchase of a pooper scooper', etc.   There are some attempts
at clever writing, but it falls short.  For example, the scientist's name
is Dr. E. Coli.   The Hawaiian Tropics Senior' competition offered humor
that never materialized.  It is nice to see Ray Walston in familiar'
surroundings.
The movie is totally ridiculous, but it's harmless.  We took our
9-year-old grandson with us.  He loved it, and we enjoyed it.  It will
never make screen history, but it's worth seeing.  I give it a C+.

Title
Review for Cousin Bette (1998)
In the musical/movie "The Music Man" reference is made to the works of
"Balzac".  His novels are thought of as scandalous and should be banned
from the River City Library.  I can see why.  But in today's less
sheltered society, this is very entertaining.  Not only are we shown the
respectable side of life in the era, we are privy to the naughty goings-on
in the background.
Jessica Lange is the title character  who causes most of the mayhem that
engulfs the other's lives.  She has been secretly harboring resentment
against her cousin who married the man of her dreams.  After the cousin
dies, Bette is led to believe that he will now finally marry her. 
Instead, he offers her the position of housekeeper.  Little could he guess
how that "insult" could affect him.   Bette cleverly enlists the aid of
others in her scheme to have a happy ending, Bette-style.
There are hysterically funny scenes involving Bob Hoskins, whether in the
bedroom or on the dueling field.  Elisabeth Shue is perfectly cast as the
dance hall girl who seduces at will and for her own profit and enjoyment. 
As a warning to some: this IS Balzac, complete with some very naughty, but
fun,  sex scenes.    Don't leave early thinking that it's over [as some
people did].  There is a very clever final scene.
I will probably watch this again, on video or TV.  I give it a solid B.

Title
Review for Stir of Echoes (1999)
Starring:        Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas, Zachary David Cope
It is astonishing that major motion picture studios often release movies
with similar plots within weeks of each other.  Last year there was Deep
Impact and Armageddon.  So, there is no question that Stir of Echoes will
be compared to the summer's surprise hit, Sixth Sense.  Both have similar
storylines involving children who see ghosts.  In Stir of Echoes the child
is Jake Witzky, played quite well by Zachary David Cope.  He is the only
one of the family who is aware of the presence of a young female ghost who
resides in the house with them, that is, until one night when his father,
Tom, (Bacon) is hypnotized at a party by Lisa (Douglas).    Her
post-hypnotic suggestion gives Tom powers to see and hear unusual glimpses
of things that surround him.  But he can't seem to figure out what is
happening.  And, his wife, Maggie, (Erbe) certainly isn't very
understanding.  Even at a cemetery, when she starts to notice that her son
has some weird abilities, she refuses to accept them.   
When Jake reminds his mother to take her purse with her, you remember
that she has a knife in it, and surely she will use it.  She does. The
major problem here is that we are aware what's happening before the cast
is.
Oh, yes, there is a mystery here.  Who is the ghost?  Why is she there? 
Well, it doesn't take long to know who she is and she's there because
she's probably been murdered.  But who did it?   There are some scary
moments and if that's what you like, you'll be entertained.  As for the
acting, Kevin Bacon's portrayal is uneven to say the least.  But now we
have another group of actors who can be included in `Six Degrees of Kevin
Bacon'.    
It's not a movie for young children to watch, but most teens will like
it. As for me, I might watch this again when it comes to free TV.  I give
it a C.

Title
Review for Hav Plenty (1997)
This movie begins  like an amateurish 8mm home movie , but soon at least
the quality of the film  stock  improves.    The characters have surnames
such as Darling, Savage and PLENTY.  It doesn't take a sleuth to realize
that the lead female is HAViland Savage, the and lead male is PLENTY, Lee
Plenty.
The plot basically concerns the lives of a nouveau-riche black family. 
Their money comes from computers, music, etc.   Although they're rich,
Haviland still has the mouth of a longshoreman, letting loose with f...
this and f... , more than polite society would ever accept.  
Plenty  is a homeless guy who is house-sitting for Haviland  and caring
for her cat.  She invites him to her parents' house for the weekend, and
strangely, we never hear another word about that cat.
Haviland has just broken up with her boyfriend, a big time recording
artist.   We are meant to wonder whether she is still in love with him, or
really desires Plenty.  The other females seem to find Plenty
irresistible, which is a bit hard to believe.  
This was a very uneven film.  I have to admit that there are some very
funny moments, yet there was some very wooden acting.  It is a sad state
when you  find  yourself looking at  the pimple on his forehead, or the
beauty mark on the end of her nose.  And, you keep wondering about her
hair.  It doesn't match from scene to scene, and you can't help noticing
it.  
I  never knew where the plot was going, and I don't think that they did
either.  Surprisingly, it was a bit hit at the 1998 Sundance Film
Festival.   

Title
Review for Corruptor, The (1999)
        This movie literally starts with a blast - as a building blows up. 
Incredibly, out of the wreckage stumbles a survivor, alive, but not for
long.  Four Oriental youths with assault weapons finish the job that they
had obviously started.  Such is life in New York's Chinatown.  There is a
struggle for control of the Oriental Mafia.  The Police, headed by Nick
Chen [Chow Yun-Fat], don't seem to be controlling it very well.  Enter
Danny Wallace [Mark Wahlberg] as the new cop on the beat, a square peg in
a round hole who doesn't want to be treated differently, although he is.  
Chen saves his life and in Chinese tradition, Danny's life now belongs to
him. 
This is definitely a guy movie.  Most fellows will like the fighting and
explosions, and the nudity - except for Wahlberg's nudity, that is.  That's
there for the girls.
The plot is a little trite, but it's OK.  There is a very exciting car
chase that is reminiscent of `Bullitt' and/or `French Connection', and it
is bloodier that both of them combined.  It's always been a wonder why
there weren't innocent bystanders killed or wounded in those movies.  We
remember the baby carriage that almost was hit, but the lack of danger to
innocent people is usually ignored.  Not so in the Corruptor.  Boy, they
shoot those extras as fast as they can!
New York City is not a very pretty or clean place up close, but some of
the shots taken at night make it look lovely.   All in all, the running
time is way too long, but you won't fall asleep in it.

Title
Review for Pi (1998)
Pi is the name of a mathematical term used primarily in determining the
area or circumference of a circle.   As well as I can remember from my
high school Math class, Pi = 3.1416__and on and on.
In the movie, Pi, Max Cohen spends much of his life carefully locked in
his small apartment, surrounded by computers and other electronic gadgets.
 He is trying to find some unknown mathematical equation.  Coming into his
life is a former teacher, and a group of Hebrew men on a religious search
for a missing 216 digit "word".
The film is in black and white, and it jumps from scene to scene with no
rhyme or reason.  At one point I felt that I was watching "Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy"  without the humor!  I couldn't tell if Max ever
solved his mathematical problem, but I know that I didn't figure anything
out.  It's still a big puzzle.
No, I don't ever want to see this again, not even on late night
television.  The very best I can give it is a D.

Title
Review for Black Dog (1998)
Reflecting on the movie BLACK DOG I see holes that you could drive a truck
through, but that's exactly what they did.  They drove that truck anywhere
they could.  The more explosions and wrecks that there are, the better.
Swayze portrays a husband/father who has recently been paroled from prison
where he was serving a sentence for vehicular manslaughter.  His deadly
accident had occurred when he fell asleep at the wheel [and saw the black
dog!] and had killed a couple of people.  
Now, he no longer has a license to drive but he works for a trucking
company.  Of course, the owner offers him $10,000 to drive a "special"
load from   Georgia to New Jersey.  Being the good parolee that he is, he
refuses, until he learns that his wife had been unable to keep up with the
bills and their home is being foreclosed  unless they come up with $9,000
immediately.
>From there the plot gets very involved with hijackers, FBI, ATF, and who
knows who else trying to intercept the load.  Swayze has been established
in the film as a skilled truck driver, so he pulls off some very fancy
driving.
In the back of the rig there is a vicious black dog who is there to
protect the load.  It seems that the only reason that dog is really there
is to add to the title.  There is no explanation for the dog's actions. 
Although the dog is portrayed as being anxious to pounce whenever the rear
door is opened, he is mysteriously hesitant when the officer at the weigh
station inspects the truck.  Everyone in the audience was wondering if the
truckers had gone off and left the dog behind somewhere.   When he finally
snarls, it seems almost comical.  It would have been far better if the dog
had lurked in the background whenever the truck was entered.  We could
have been surprised when Patrick first encounters him, and then we would
have been anticipating the dog's appearance when the guard inspects the
load.    Also, later in the film, when a dead body is placed in the rear
with the load, what does that dog do?
As I mentioned, there are plenty of good stunts and crashes and
explosions.  How do you wreck a lot of cars at once?  Just crash a truck
that is carrying a load of cars.
Swayze is OK in the roll, not good, not bad.  Kevin Sorbo was originally
intended as the star but his shoulder problem  prevented it.  I wonder if
it would have been different with him.  As for the two singers, Randy
Travis and Meatloaf, they both turn in creditable portrayals, although it
is funny listening to Travis trying to sing poorly.  Make sure that you
listen to the lyrics of his creations.  They're very funny.  I especially
like "He drew first, but I shot faster."
I won't mind watching it again on late night TV when there's nothing
better on, but I'm not going to pay to see it again.

Title
Review for One Man's Hero (1999)
One Man's Hero, Starring Tom Berenger, Daniela Romo, Patrick Bergin,
Joaquim de Almeida, Stephen Tobolowsky.
Directed by Lance Hool.
Most historical films produced in the United States are presented with
the Americans as the `good Guys'.  One Man's Hero dares to do otherwise. 
It tells the true story of the San Patricios who fought against America in
the Mexican-American War.
At the time of the potato famine in Ireland, numerous emigrants arrived
at our ports seeking work and citizenship.  They were greeted as they got
off the boat by Army recruiters who promised American citizenship in
return for a hitch as a soldier.  It was an offer too good to refuse. 
These Irish could have a roof over their heads, three meals a day, and
receive payment that they could use to bring their families to this land
of opportunity.  And, there was no war going on.
Those that arrived at Galveston and such were stationed in Texas, mostly
in Southern Texas, near the Mexican border.  Tom Berenger plays John
Riley, an Irishman who has risen to the rank of Sergeant.  The Commanding
officer is a fair man and a good leader, but when he is away, his
second-in-command, Captain Gaine, (Steve Tobolosky) takes a sadistic
enjoyment in tormenting the Irish.  When Sgt. Riley asks for a pass to go
to Mass he is chastised by this tyrant for cavorting with the enemy,
although he issues the pass.  Once at church, Sgt. Riley finds several
other Irish who are AWOL in order to attend Mass.
The underlying question that is asked is:  What about a man's freedom of
religion?  By attending Mass, they were not pledging allegiance to Mexico.
 They were simply honoring their God.  Of course, it was felt that they
were placing allegiance to Rome above faithfulness to America.
Although Sgt. Riley could safely return to camp with no repercussions, he
elects to stay with his men in an attempt to obtain justice for them.
It is a beautifully taught history lesson and I highly recommend it.  You
will find yourself questioning your awareness of the past as you have
learned it.  What else is there of which we are unaware?  I give it B+ for
this reason.  I definitely want to see it again.

Title
Review for I Went Down (1997)
This is a film produced in Ireland which was a big hit at the Sundance
Film Festival. For the life of me, I don't know why they liked it.
Most foreign films come supplied with sub-titles, but when the actors are
speaking English, there's no such help, even when they have heavy Irish
brogues.  I heard the same complaint about "The Full Monty", and "Brassed
Off", but the plots of those films overcame the problem.  In "I Went
Down", you miss a lot of the humor because you can't understand them.
The movie involves a small time gang boss and his stooges.  Our Lead has
just gotten out of prison [a term he served to protect his father, I
think?] and he becomes a pawn in a caper to recover a man who has $25,000
pounds of the boss's money, or does he?  By the end of the film, you
finally figure out what's going on, but by that time, you really don't
care.
The sex scenes seem to be in the movie simply because they wanted to have
sex scenes in the movie.  They could have been eliminated without changing
the plot.  It's a sad commentary when you don't remember much about a
movie except for ridiculous things, such as one guy's sideburns and shoes,
and another guy's birthmark on his face.
If this movie comes on free TV some evening and you have nothing better to
do, you might want to watch it, but don't lose sleep over it.  I give it a
D+.

Title
Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
If you like war movies, this is probably the best one that you'll ever
see.  To say that it starts off with a bang would be putting it mildly.  
>From the very beginning of the film you are part of it.  As the troops are
preparing to invade the beaches of Normandy on D-Day, June 6th, you can
feel the thoughts going on in the minds of each and every soldier.
As the LCVPs pull onto the sand and drop the ramps, the men  become
sitting ducks as a barrage of bullets and heavy artillery rake across
them.  In the audience, you find it difficult to see clearly, or to hear
what is being said, much the same as it was for them.  You get quick
glimpses of carnage and blood, but you [the soldier] are driven by
self-preservation.  If you would stop to help a buddy, neither of you
would survive.  It was every man for himself.  But, you had to follow
orders.
Tom Hanks is the star of the film, but most of the other central roles are
played by lesser known [although experienced] actors.  This makes it even
more believable that they are real army.  There are cameos that pop up,
such as Harve Presnell, Ted Danson, and Dennis Farina, but that's all they
are....cameos.
It's a long movie, but you hardly realize it.  I'm one of those people who
was living during W.W.II.  My husband served in the Navy  while he was
only in his teens.  He was one of four brothers who were each in different
theaters of action.  Once or twice he happened upon one of them in some
unknown country.  Unlike Private Ryan, my husband was fortunate enough
that he and all of his brothers came home alive, and unharmed.
Even though I was aware of the war and the D-Day invasion, I have never
felt it so graphically as I did in this film.  The  violence that is shown
in this movie is, by far, more believable and real that anything you've
ever seen before.  It just affects you in a way that can't be explained. 
I dare anyone to watch this and not cry.
They say that our children learn from what they see in movies and on
television.  Just like Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan is a must-see
film.  Maybe it could help stop the violence in the world today.
I did notice one blooper  in the film.  The squad goes from being 8 to 7
to 8 to 7 again.  Watch for it.  But, it doesn't stop me from giving this
an A.  It's by far the best film of the year.  I want to see it again.

Title
Review for Enemy of the State (1998)
Starring: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Lisa Bonet, Regina King,
et al  
Will Smith is the star of this movie mainly because he's the only one who
has more than a couple of scenes. The exception is Gene Hackman who
appears halfway into the story.   The plight of Robert Dean [Will Smith]
is one that could happen to anyone.  That's what makes this movie so
scary.  It's not the explosions, or the car chases.  It's the realization
that our privacy is in danger.  In this age of computers and advanced
electronics, our lives are open books-if you are the one who knows where
to find the book.
Dean, a young practicing attorney, is in the middle of a law suit
involving an Italian `enforcer' who threatens his life because of evidence
Dean has that could send him back to prison.  At the same time, another
plot is beginning to unfold, and through a set of circumstances, Dean
becomes an unknowing player in a political battle involving the `Right to
Privacy'.  He learns first hand just how susceptible we have all become. 
At first it's small things like having his credit card refused at a hotel.
Soon, as the conspiracy grows, he realizes that the Italian group is not
capable of such extensive harassment. 
Jon Voight seems to be creating a new image for himself as the epitome of
upper-class corruption.   He has that trustworthy-but-misleading look.  As
he's playing a political figure, it makes you wonder about our own
security.   Lisa Bonet and Regina King are the two women in Dean's life. 
Lisa is a former girl friend, from his days at Georgetown.  Regina is his
wife and mother of their 8-year-old son.  The story is so well written
that, at times, I wasn't sure which female would end up with him.
Gene Hackman, the co-star, is wonderful.  He's totally believable.  It's
just a shame that it takes so long for him to appear. The explanation
about his past is told too quickly and, at the end, you're still a bit in
the dark about him.
 Other cast members are excellent in their roles although most of them
have nothing more than cameos.  It makes you wonder why some are given
star billing and others are not.
The movie isn't bad.  It's an OK way to spend a couple of hours.  But
it's neither the actors nor the plot that you'll remember.  You'll just
keep asking yourself how much privacy you really have.  It's worth seeing
for that reason alone.  I give it a B-.  And, I would watch it again,
probably on TV.

Title
Review for Why Do Fools Fall In Love (1998)
It's interesting that the credits of Why Do Fools Fall In Love show that
it was written by Frankie Lymon and Morris Levy, because that's what the
movie is all about.  Following Frankie Lymon's death, the song once again
becomes a hit and each of Frankie's  three widows decide to see Morris
Levy for the widow's share of the royalties.  
They go to court where the story unfolds as each one states her case for
Judge Lambrey, played perfectly by Pamela Reed.  Just as you are really
getting into Zola's story [Halle Berry], you are interrupted by Elizabeth
[Vivica A. Fox].  At first, you resent her, but then, you start seeing her
side of the story.  The same goes for Emira [Lela Rochon].  It seems that
Frankie was a different person with each wife.  Who was Frankie, really? 
It is interesting to see his biography unfold.  It points out the racial
barriers that minorities encountered.  In those days their audiences were
totally Caucasian.   It is probably a concept that today's teens can't
comprehend.
Some of the best moments in the film include Little Richard.  He is
hysterical when testifying in court and he makes some very valid
statements on the treatment of performers by producers.  In flashback
scenes the young Little Richard [Miguel A. Nunez, Jr.] is a perfect
replica. 
The music that is featured will get to everyone.  From Tutti-Fruitti  to
California Dreamin.  Even if the movie weren't as great as it is, you'd
get your money's worth from the soundtrack alone.
It is definitely one of the better pictures of the year.  Everything
about it is good: plot, direction, script, acting, score, costumes, sets,
etc.  The different sets of Zola's house overlooking Los Angeles will stay
in your mind.
I won't tell you how the judge rules, but I will add that I wondered
about Herman Santiago.  He is the one who originally wrote the title song
with Frankie.  His name was on the original record.  In searching the
Internet, I found that he, and another of the performers, did file suit. 
However, their claim was denied because they waited too long, after
turning 21, to file their claim.  It doesn't seem fair.
I definitely want to see this again, if not in a theater, I'll probably
buy the video.
It gets an A- in my books.

Review for Minus Man, The (1999)
The Minus Man, Starring Owen Wilson, Brian Cox, Mercedes Reuhl, Janeane
Garofalo, Dwight Yoakum, Sheryl Crow.
Directed by Hampton Fancher
 The catch phrase for The Minus Man says that people will be talking
about this film after they see it.  Well, when I walked out of the theater
I heard person after person saying the same thing.WEIRD!
Sheryl Crow is the first onscreen victim of serial killer Vann Siegert
(Wilson) and she's not killed soon enough for me.  The scenes involving
her are slow and amateurish.  It was a precursor of things to come.   
Vann feels that he is providing a service with his homicidal endeavors.  
He kills whenever he gets a `sign' that a person would be better off in
the hereafter.    He even has a set of rules.  He doesn't kill anyone he
knows, or anyone who lives in the same town with him.   However, he breaks
both of those rules in one single day.
Two imaginary detectives continually jump in and out of the action,
visible only to Vann.  This only makes it more difficult to follow the
plot.
There is actually some very good acting in this film.  Brian Cox and
Mercedes Reuhl, are wonderful as Doug and Jane, a couple who take in Vann
as a boarder.  They have their own problems including the fact that Doug
is a heavy drinker who likes to beat up on himself.
With Doug's help Vann manages to get a job with the Post Office.  Now,
there's a great place to have a serial killer working, right?  He meets
Ferrin (Garofalo), a fellow Postal worker who is attracted to this nice,
sweet, attractive newcomer.  Where does the plot go from here?  Well, it
doesn't go where you'd expect.
This is an extremely slow-moving film, so slow that I had a lot of trouble
staying awake.  There were some people who dozed off, and others who left.
 They didn't get to see the very unusual ending.  It is easily a movie
that you can miss without regrets.  If it's on latenight TV sometime, you
might tune it in.  It'll help put you to sleep.  I give it a C-.

Title
Review for Stepmom (1998)
When a noted photographer becomes involved with a recently divorced man,
she also becomes involved with his two children and his ex-wife.   All of
the Actors are perfectly cast in their roles.  They all play likeable
people with problems.  Although this combination is sure to be a
crowd-pleaser the movie lacks a lot in the art of filmmaking.  The editing
and continuity leave a lot to be desired. The film literally jumps from
scene to scene as we progress deeper into their lives.  In an opening
scene, Isabel, [Julia Roberts] trips over a rabbit, the pet of the son,
Ben [Liam Aiken], who imagines himself a magician.  We never see the
rabbit again.
Later Isabel presents the children with a dog.  When Ben is found at
the police station following his disappearance, the dog is with him
but they must have left the dog with the cops because he's never
seen again either.  One minute we're in the midst of Halloween.
The next you know, it's suddenly Thanksgiving.  When the story
begins, Isabel is not a Stepmom.  She is simply a woman in love who
questions whether or not she is capable and willing to take on a ready
made family.
Susan Sarandon as the mother, Jackie, makes a nice transition from being
a bitter resentful divorcee to a more likeable person.  It gives her a
chance for an Oscar nomination.  She's done much better than this, however.
Ed Harris as Luke, the father, is neither too good nor too unfeeling.  He
makes you understand how it is to be divorced, engaged, and a very good
Dad.
The children are typical kids.  If anyone deserves a nomination it should
be for Best Supporting Actress for Jena Malone as Anna, the daughter.  Her
performance is so natural that you don't realize she's acting.  It's a
very intense role for someone so young.  She shouldn't be dismissed
because of her age.
Basically the plot is about the power struggle that develops between the
two women.  Julia simply wants to be accepted while Susan wants to be
remembered.  It becomes more serious as the movie unfolds.     All in all,
the second half of the film drags on and on.  It should have been
re-titled `The Long Goodbye'.
The audience cried a lot, but that doesn't make it good.  I give it a B. 

Title
Review for American History X (1998)
American History X is not an easy film to watch.  Looking back on it I
remember the song from `South Pacific' whose lyrics are: `You've got to be
taught to be afraid, of people whose eyes are oddly made, of people whose
skin is a different shade.  You've got to be carefully taught.'    That is
the basic story behind American History X.  What makes a young man, Derek
Vinyard [Edward Norton] become a skinhead?  How did he learn to hate?  In
part, he learns from Cameron Alexander [Stacy Keach] who enlists Derek to
entice other disgruntled white teens to join his army of hatemongers.
But there's more to the story than that.   Although the action
supposedly takes place in one twenty-four hour period, the flashbacks take
it back through previous years.  Danny Vinyard [Edward Furlong] has been
called into the office of Mr. Sweeney [Avery Brooks] for writing an essay
about the civil rights of Adolf Hitler.  It is feared that Danny, in
emulating his older brother, Derek, is headed down the same path.  Derek
is being released from prison that day.  He has served a three-year
sentence for manslaughter for killing two black teens.  The killing scenes
are especially graphic.  Mr. Sweeney gives Danny the homework assignment
of writing about Derek and the course of his life to replace the
unacceptable essay.
Derek is not a totally unlikable person.  He's just confused by what
he's been taught in his short life.  When he is released from prison, he
has changed.   His friends, such as Seth [Ethan Suplee] cannot understand
this change.  During Derek's imprisonment Seth and most of his other
friends have banned together under the leadership of Cameron Alexander. 
They are not a likeable group.  It's sad to realize that there are groups
like this all over America today.  
There are too many subplots to mention and not all of them are
satisfactory.  We are dealing with a dysfunctional family who is really
very close.  They don't seem to realize just how dysfunctional they really
are.
I really enjoyed this movie, but I doubt that it will make any impact on
the movie audiences.  In many ways I fear that it could incite haters to
hate even more.  I'm glad that I saw it, but it is disturbing.  I don't
want to believe that this can happen.  I definitely don't want to see it
again, not even on free TV.   The best thing about it is the acting. 
Everyone in it is totally believable, and the two Edwards are destined to
be respected actors, which is more important than being `stars'.   I give
it a C.

Title
Review for Central do Brasil (1998)
Former schoolteacher, Cora Texeira [Fernanda Montenegro] earns money by
writing letters at $1.00 each for the multitude of illiterate people who
pass by her makeshift table in Central Station.  At night she and her girl
friend, Irene [Marilia Pera] entertain themselves by reading and judging
the importance of the contents.  Most end up, unsent, in the trash, while
a few are placed in a drawer for later posting.
Cora's life changes when Ava [Soia Lira] and her son, Josue [Vinisius de
Oliveira] stop by Cora's table to write a letter to the boy's father. 
When Ana is accidentally killed Cora finds a suppressed maternal instinct
emerging at times.  She helps Josue while trying at the same time, to
distance herself from him.  She sells' him to an adoption service, but
when she discovers that they intend to kill him for his organs she rescues
him and they find themselves on the lam.
The low regard for life and the hardships of the people are dramatically
shown.  When a young man steals a small item from a Central Station shop,
he is chased and caught.  Despite his pleading he is shot and killed.
The trains that service Central Station are hot and crowded.  As an empty
train pulls into the station some passengers board through the windows,
dropping into the few available seats.
But, through the desperation that is seen we get a glimpse of the hope
that lies ahead for Brazil.  When Cora and Josue reach the developing area
to the north, there are rows and rows of tract houses being built and
there is one paved street.  These meager buildings aren't much but they
are a vast improvement over the alternatives available.
Foreign films with subtitles are a bit difficult to watch but, like `Life
is Beautiful' this film is definitely worth the effort.  Ms. Montenegro
has been nominated for the Best Actress Oscar.  She deserves the
nomination.  Her portrayal will stay with you for a very long time.  I
must see this movie again.  I give it a B+.

Title
Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
If you like war movies, this is probably the best one that you'll ever
see.  To say that it starts off with a bang would be putting it mildly.  
>From the very beginning of the film you are part of it.  As the troops are
preparing to invade the beaches of Normandy on D-Day, June 6th, you can
feel the thoughts going on in the minds of each and every soldier.
As the LCVPs pull onto the sand and drop the ramps, the men  become
sitting ducks as a barrage of bullets and heavy artillery rake across
them.  In the audience, you find it difficult to see clearly, or to hear
what is being said, much the same as it was for them.  You get quick
glimpses of carnage and blood, but you [the soldier] are driven by
self-preservation.  If you would stop to help a buddy, neither of you
would survive.  It was every man for himself.  But, you had to follow
orders.
Tom Hanks is the star of the film, but most of the other central roles are
played by lesser known [although experienced] actors.  This makes it even
more believable that they are real army.  There are cameos that pop up,
such as Harve Presnell, Ted Danson, and Dennis Farina, but that's all they
are....cameos.
It's a long movie, but you hardly realize it.  I'm one of those people who
was living during W.W.II.  My husband served in the Navy  while he was
only in his teens.  He was one of four brothers who were each in different
theaters of action.  Once or twice he happened upon one of them in some
unknown country.  Unlike Private Ryan, my husband was fortunate enough
that he and all of his brothers came home alive, and unharmed.
Even though I was aware of the war and the D-Day invasion, I have never
felt it so graphically as I did in this film.  The  violence that is shown
in this movie is, by far, more believable and real that anything you've
ever seen before.  It just affects you in a way that can't be explained. 
I dare anyone to watch this and not cry.
They say that our children learn from what they see in movies and on
television.  Just like Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan is a must-see
film.  Maybe it could help stop the violence in the world today.
I did notice one blooper  in the film.  The squad goes from being 8 to 7
to 8 to 7 again.  Watch for it.  But, it doesn't stop me from giving this
an A.  It's by far the best film of the year.  I want to see it again.

Title
Review for Clay Pigeons (1998)
Starring:        Vince Vaughn, Joaquin Phoenix, Janeane Garofalo, Georgina Cates
Directed by:        David Dobkin
        When I first heard about Clay Pigeons, I wasn't looking
forward to it.  When the movie began, I was certain that I wouldn't
like it.  I changed my mind.
        The first scene has Clay and his buddy out in the middle of
the desert, drinking beer, shooting at the empty bottles, and using
every four-letter word that they can think of.  Next, there's a
violent, fatal shooting, followed quickly by a very erotic sex scene.
This is all in the first 10 minutes.  But there is actually a plot to
this movie and it's very involved.
        It unsure who is the real star of this movie.  All of the cast
turn in excellent performances.  Vince Vaughn is such a character that
he's hard to describe, much less to understand.  You really start
to feel for Joaquin Phoenix as Clay.  He finds himself so completely
wrapped in the web of circumstances begun by his shooting buddy.  Now
Clay isn't completely innocent.  After all, he did sleep with his
buddy's wife, but who didn't.  Does Clay really deserve all that
happens to him?
        The two females in the cast are totally different.  Georgina
Cates plays the nymphomaniac to perfection.  Janeane Garofalo plays
another female Federal agent.  She was more believable than others
have been.
        It's a movie that will stay with you for a while.  It
definitely deserves its R rating, but it deserves an A for screenplay.
Adding everything together, I give it a B-.

Title
Review for Smoke Signals (1998)
        Throughout history the American Indians have communicated through smoke
signals, but do they always understand the message that is sent?  This
movie concentrates on the lives of members of the Coeur d'Alene Indians of
Idaho, particularly on two friends, Victor and Thomas.
        As the film begins a frame house is engulfed in flames with  smoke
billowing into the sky.   A voice narration is describing the incident. 
It is Thomas.  He is recalling  when he was flying, as you see a baby
thrown from the upstairs window.  An Indian man rushes forward with
outstretched arms catching the infant as they both fall to the ground. 
The rescuer is Victor's father.   Sadly, Thomas' parents are both killed
in the blaze.  Thomas, raised by his grandmother, becomes quite a
storyteller and somewhat of a nerd.  Victor, on the other hand, is the
epitome of the Indian brave, with the added ability to play basketball.
        When Victor is twelve years old, his father leaves.   Much of the movie
is done using flashbacks, with very artistic editing.  The twelve year old
actors and their adult counterparts are remarkably alike, and all handle
their roles with total believability.
        Watching the film you   understand a little more about what life must be
like on an Indian reservation.  There is a lot of drinking, mostly beer,
but the thought of "firewater" and its effect on the American Indian is
obvious.  There are many subtle remarks about the "white man", some of
which are very funny, some all too true.  One charming scene involves two
Indian girls out for a joy ride in their car, driving in reverse.  No
reason is ever given, but you know that it is probably the only gear that
works.
        The main story involves the trip that Victor and Thomas make to Arizona
when word is received that Victor's father has died and Victor needs to go
there to finalize things. He doesn't want to go, but he does.  What he
learns is told in a most fascinating way.  It is truly a heartwarming
story and I highly recommend it.  I will definitely watch is again,
probably when it comes on television.  
        This film was produced in association with the Sundance Studios.  I give
it a B+.

Title
Review for Still Crazy (1998)
Over twenty years ago, when a fictional 70's rock band, Strange Fruit,
disbanded, part of their problem had been in determining which one was the
`star'.  A combination of ego, booze, drugs and sex had led to their
downfall, assisted by a lightning bolt from God himself.
Still Crazy is a good example of an ensemble working together.  Top
billing goes to Stephen Rea as Tony Costello, the keyboard player who has
since been reduced to servicing a condom machine route in Spain.  But, he
is not `the star'.  All of the characters are totally believable as
members of the defunct group, but the memorable performance is given by
Bill Nighy as Ray Simms, the lead singer, whose former good looks had
compensated for his limited ability.  He and his Swedish trophy wife,
Astrid Simms (Helena Bergstrom) live in a mansion that is mortgaged to the
hilt, in dire need of repair, and up for sale.  Each member of the group
is stuck in a job that they dislike, so when the suggestion of a comeback
arises, they each agree.  The problem of ego is still there, but the
drinking, drugs and sex have been reduced to almost non-existent.
There is a lot of good adult humor, none of which is offensive.  The
jokes and sight gags are very real, as is the music.  The haunting `The
Flame Still Burns' will linger with you after you leave the theater. 
You'll also remember `Brian's Theme' and `What Might Have Been'.
It is not a great movie, but it is enjoyable.  Even if you're not an
advocate of Rock music, you'll enjoy the story.  I give it a solid B.  

Title
Review for Cruise, The (1998/I)
Visually and vocally, Timothy Levitch is a cross between Woody Allen
and Tiny Tim. Unfortunately he doesn't have the talent of either
and his voice is reminiscent of fingernails on the blackboard. This is
particularly unfortunate as he is the narrator of the film,
essentially the only one who speaks.
It has been said that each person will ultimately have his 15 minutes of
fame. In this movie, even 15 minutes is too long. The premise is a good
one: following a sightseeing cruise bus through the streets of New York
City. There are occasional shots of points of interest, like the Empire
State Building, the Chrysler Building, and The World Trade Center, but
they are too few and far between. Sights such as the UN Building, Fulton
Fish Market, etc are but a blink of the eye.
A very nice musical score is almost hidden beneath the rambling
narration. The viewer is asked to care about this totally strange
person. It is learned that he works twenty hours a week; clears $200
per week after taxes; carries his belongings with him; sleeps in a
friend's room; and has a criminal record.
In all I counted 27 people who walked out of the theatre. There are
sure to be people who may be moved by Levitch's wordy dialogue and
repetition of `big' words such as cacophony and malaise, but I
cannot recommend it for most people. All in all, I not only feel sorry
for the people who buy tickets to this film, but I really sympathize
with those tourists who paid to go on sight-seeing tours of NYC with
him as their guide.
I have no desire to ever see this movie again. I give it a D-.

Title
Review for Artemisia (1997)
In these days of sexual harassment cases, I suggest that people go to see
ARTEMISIA  to see what sexual harassment really is.  
The true story opens in Rome in 1610 where 15 year old Artemisia is living
in a convent.  She takes a candle from the chapel to enable her to have
light in the late hours in her room to draw.  Her ability to sketch the
human body comes from her use of this candle and a mirror to examine and
recreate her own naked body.  When her artist father, Messier Gentileschi,
is shown her drawings he takes her from the convent to become his
assistant.  She does much of the painting that is passed off as his work.  
She wants to learn as much as possible but is not allowed to attend the
academy, simply because she is a female.   Her desire to learn about the
male body is fulfilled when she convinces a young worker to take off his
clothes for her, in exchange for a kiss.  She sketches what she has seen.
In the art world of that era females are only used as nude models and
participants in after hour orgies.  When her father is hired to work with
Agostino Tassi in painting the frescoes for a new church, Artemisia 
learns even more when she peeks through the window at one of the orgies. 
She prevails upon Tassi to become her art teacher and shows him her
sketches.  When he sees the male nudes that she has done, he surmises that
she is much more experienced than she is, and he is very surprised when
she loses her virginity to him.  
When her father learns of their indiscretions, he has Tassi arrested, for
rape.  Artemisia insists that he did not rape her, but her father is
trying to save her reputation, even at the cost of Tassi's career and
freedom.    Some of the scenes that follow had the audience gasping at
what happens next.  
The epilogue gives a condensed version of what became of them.  Artemisia
did, in fact, become a recognized artist, with works on exhibition at the
Louvre, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
This is an excellent movie, although it will not appeal to everyone.  I'm
very glad that I saw it.  I learned from it and I wouldn't mind seeing it
again.

Title
Review for 24 Hour Woman, The (1999)
Starring:        Rosie Perez, Marianne Jean Baptize, Patty Lupone
A cable TV show, `The 24 Hour Woman', is the focal point of this `real
life' story.  The male host of the show learns, on the air, that he is to
become a father.  The show's Producer is the mother.  That role is played
by Rosie Perez.   Rosie's voice, usually grating to the ear, is a bit less
strident here.  She's a bit easier to endure.
The event becomes a `ratings' booster as they follow Rosie through her
pregnancy, incorporating various experts on children, pregnancy, etc. as
guests on the show.  That part is delightful, but, after their daughter is
born and the couple must cope with the problems confronting working
mothers today, it gets a little heavy.
The more interesting story belongs to Marianne Jean Baptize [of Secrets
and Lies] who plays Rosie's assistant.  Marianne, the mother of three
children, has gone back to work because her husband is out of work.  They
have a lovely relationship.   It's a shame that they didn't pursue that
story further.   He feels bad that he is no longer the breadwinner so he
helps her with the chores and with the children.  Despite jeers from his
male friends he becomes a sort of Mr. Mom.     The difference is obvious
between him and Rosie's husband who is quick to take the plaudits
associated with fatherhood, but none of the work that's entailed.  His
actions cause his and Rosie's relationship and marriage to disintegrate.  
Her work suffers more and more.
There's too much reality here.  It isn't a feel-good film by any means. 
It just endorses the backbreaking work of a real 24-hour woman.  It's not
easy.  I give it a C.

Title
Review for Mumford (1999)
Mumford, Starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Martin Short, Alfre
Woodard, Mary McDonnell, David Paymer, Jane Adams, Pruitt Taylor Vince.
Directed by Lawrence Kasdan     
 The advertisements and promos for Mumford tell you that it is the story
of a psychologist, who isn't really a psychologist.  Going into the film
with this knowledge gives you an entirely different prospectus about the
goings-on because Mumford's deception isn't revealed until well into the
storyline.  Mumford is both the names of the psychologist, and of the town
where he practices his craft.
The real story, or rather stories surround the supporting players.  Each
has a story to tell, and most of them tell it to Mumford, much to the
chagrin of the other `head doctors' in town, as well as to the daffy
attorney played by Martin Short.  Mumford has that wonderful ability of
being able to listen to what others are saying when the other people in
their lives are ignoring their needs.  As a viewer, you quickly realize
what causes many of their insecurities, just as he does.  Ted Danson does
a walk-on cameo as the husband of a woman who is a compulsive shopper. 
Her children (his stepchildren) also have their problems.  The son, for
example, carries a 22-gauge shotgun with him wherever he goes.
Alfre Woodard, who is Mumford's landlady, Lily, and runs a local café,
seems to be about the only sane person in town although she really doesn't
want a man in her life.  She prefers long showers!
The opening scenes are wonderful.  They are in black and white and
reminiscent of the films of the 40's.  At first I thought that they were
showing the wrong movie, but it surprisingly turned into the perfect intro
for the tale.
There is a little nudity and bad language used but they are done
extremely well, and greatly add to the plot.  Especially funny is a scene
in the Panda Modem Lab, owned by the town's Billionaire (Jason Lee) who
has created a new `toy'.
It is a delightful light comedy, one that I wouldn't mind seeing again,
probably when it comes to TV.  I give it a solid B.

Title
Review for Little Voice (1998)
Jane Horrocks, who stars as L.V. or `Little Voice', is unknown to most
filmgoers but this movie wouldn't have been the same without her.  It was
written specifically for her and her ability to duplicate the incredible
voices of various singing legends.
L.V. lives with her mother, Mari Hoff, played by Brenda Blethyn, in rooms
over their former record store.  Music had been her father's love and when
he died, the store, his records and memories were all that remained.  The
mother longs for romance and excitement.  She's not ready to be a weeping
widow.   She is attracted to a man, Ray Say, who is a talent agent of
sorts, portrayed by Michael Caine.  He puts up a flashy front while hoping
to find that one performer who will establish him and make him rich.
A telephone installer named George [Philip Jackson] and his assistant,
Billy  [Ewan McGregor] meet the mother and daughter while connecting a new
phone line.  The lecherous and married George is hoping for a quick
interlude with  Mari but Billy is attracted to the taciturn L.V.  He is
the silent type who raises homing pigeons on the rooftop and who lacks the
wherewithal to pursue L.V.
One night when Ray overhears L.V., alone in her room, singing in a loud
voice reminiscent of Judy Garland, he knows that he's finally found his
star, his meal ticket.
It isn't easy convincing L.V. to agree to sing in front of a live
audience.  The circumstances of the appearance and what follow are what
make this a truly memorable film.  There are numerous classic songs that
the older generation will appreciate.  They include: The Man That Got
Away, Hey, Big Spender,  Lover Boy, Get Happy, and many others.  
The three leads all give Oscar winning performances.  Hopefully, they'll
be nominated.  Brenda Blethyn is just tawdry enough as a love-hungry but
vulnerable older woman.  Michael Caine totally conveys the depths of this
likeable/unlikable usurious man.   Jane Horrocks is in a class by herself.
Mr. Boo [Jim Broadbent], the club owner where L.V. performs is another
little person  clinging to his pseudo-importance.  Annette Badland as
Sadie, the Hoff's neighbor across the street, delivers a small but classic
role.

Title
Review for I Went Down (1997)
This is a film produced in Ireland which was a big hit at the Sundance
Film Festival. For the life of me, I don't know why they liked it.
Most foreign films come supplied with sub-titles, but when the actors are
speaking English, there's no such help, even when they have heavy Irish
brogues.  I heard the same complaint about "The Full Monty", and "Brassed
Off", but the plots of those films overcame the problem.  In "I Went
Down", you miss a lot of the humor because you can't understand them.
The movie involves a small time gang boss and his stooges.  Our Lead has
just gotten out of prison [a term he served to protect his father, I
think?] and he becomes a pawn in a caper to recover a man who has $25,000
pounds of the boss's money, or does he?  By the end of the film, you
finally figure out what's going on, but by that time, you really don't
care.
The sex scenes seem to be in the movie simply because they wanted to have
sex scenes in the movie.  They could have been eliminated without changing
the plot.  It's a sad commentary when you don't remember much about a
movie except for ridiculous things, such as one guy's sideburns and shoes,
and another guy's birthmark on his face.
If this movie comes on free TV some evening and you have nothing better to
do, you might want to watch it, but don't lose sleep over it.  I give it a
D.

Title
Review for Sliding Doors (1998)
The day starts off as usual for Helen Quilley, the sole female in a London
Public Relations firm, but the morning meeting suddenly  leaves her
jobless and on her way home.  Unknown to Helen, her live-in lover, Gerry,
is having a  meeting of his own with Lydia, a former girlfriend who has
come back into his life.  
The SLIDING DOORS of the underground train shut before Helen can board. 
Then, the film goes into reverse causing Helen to walk backwards up the
stairs.  Switch to forward and this time, she manages to squeeze through
the SLIDING DOORS before they close, enabling her to arrive home earlier
than expected.
>From this point on there are two story lines that show how her life could
unfold.  To enable the viewer to keep them straight there are obvious
differences such as a bandage, or a different hair color.   In one
scenario Helen discovers Gerry in bed with Lydia.  In the other, she only
has suspicions that Gerry is having an affair.  
While Gerry, Lydia, and their friends remain more or less the same in both
plots, it is Helen herself who displays the greatest differences.  One
Helen becomes a self-sufficient, semi-successful business woman while the
other Helen becomes an object of our pity.  It is a wonderful acting job
by  Miss Paltrow, probably her best to date.
Although Gerry tries to get up nerve to tell Lydia that he wants nothing
more to do with her, he can't bring himself to end the relationship. 
Enter James, a charming, Monty Python quoting suitor who meets Helen and
begins to pursue her.  
The movie is so well written that you find yourself changing back and
forth.  Sometimes you're wanting her to be with James.  Other times you
want her to make up with Gerry.  There are many character traits that you
like and dislike about each Helen from self-sacrifice to self-confidence.
It is definitely a screenplay that makes you think.  What if?  In my case
it particularly hit home.  As luck would have it, I was in London less
than a month ago.  I entered the Underground at the same station, rode the
same moving sidewalk, and boarded a train that looked exactly like the
train that Helen boarded.  I couldn't help but ask myself....  What if?

Review for Cousin Bette (1998)
In the musical/movie "The Music Man" reference is made to the works of
"Balzac".  His novels are thought of as scandalous and should be banned
from the River City Library.  I can see why.  But in today's less
sheltered society, this is very entertaining.  Not only are we shown the
respectable side of life in the era, we are privy to the naughty goings-on
in the background.
Jessica Lange is the title character  who causes most of the mayhem that
engulfs the other's lives.  She has been secretly harboring resentment
against her cousin who married the man of her dreams.  After the cousin
dies, Bette is led to believe that he will now finally marry her. 
Instead, he offers her the position of housekeeper.  Little could he guess
how that "insult" could affect him.   Bette cleverly enlists the aid of
others in her scheme to have a happy ending, Bette-style.
There are hysterically funny scenes involving Bob Hoskins, whether in the
bedroom or on the dueling field.  Elisabeth Shue is perfectly cast as the
dance hall girl who seduces at will and for her own profit and enjoyment. 
As a warning to some: this IS Balzac, complete with some very naughty, but
fun,  sex scenes.    Don't leave early thinking that it's over [as some
people did].  There is a very clever final scene.
I will probably watch this again, on video or TV.  I give it a solid B.

Title
Review for Vita č bella, La (1997)
This is an Italian film, with subtitles.  Most people don't like
subtitles, but give this movie a try.  If it was in English, it would
probably be on everyone's best films list.  It seems almost sacrilegious
to say that this is a very funny movie, because it's such a moving drama. 
To me, it's a cross between `Saving Private Ryan' and `Schindler's List'
with humor.
The central character is a man named Guido, [portrayed by Roberto Benigni]
an Italian Jew who is always clowning around. [Benigni himself has been
lauded as a new Buster Keaton.] His story begins in 1939 when he comes to
the big city where he has an uncle.  There he meets a girl.  His courtship
is hysterical.  I keep remembering scene after scene, and laughing to
myself.   There are the `hat' scenes, and there is his job as a waiter. 
It is there that he meets a doctor who likes riddles.  They become an
intricate part of the plot.
 Suddenly, it is 1944 and the Germans have moved into Italy.  Previously,
the Italian Jews have suffered mainly bigotry, name-calling, and graffiti.
 But, the Germans begin to move them to the concentration camps.  Guido,
his uncle, his wife, and his young son are all shipped off.   Guido, in an
attempt to spare his son the trauma of what is happening, tells the boy
that they are on vacation, and that it's a game.  The boy loves his toy
tank, so Guido tells him that the first prize in this game is a full size
tank.  
Oh, there are so many wonderful moments, such as when the Grandmother
first meets her grandson.  I can hardly wait for this movie to be released
so that I can see it again.  And the sub-titles didn't bother me a bit. 
They are even beneficial and funny in the scene where the guard, in
German, is explaining the rules to the prisoners.
I cannot recommend this film too highly.  I give it an A-, and the minus
is only because of the language barrier.

Title
Review for Eyes Wide Shut (1999)
There has always been the question about the difference between Art and
Pornography.   I was reticent about seeing this film because of the hype
and the previews that preceded it.  I dreaded that I might be offended or
embarrassed by it.  No. It is Art.
How many times have you scoffed at an actor who declares that he (or she)
would consider nudity `if the role warrants it for artistic reasons' when
you know full well that he's only making a dumb excuse.  The nudity in
this film did not bother me in the slightest.  It is Art.
Never before have I seen a motion picture that has stayed with me in its
entirety.  I can call to mind every single scene that I saw.  Each and
every actor is embedded in my head, from the leads to the one-liners. 
There are constant surprises, such as the costume shop, and the hotel
clerk that are special, but even the rowdies on the street or the butlers
are perfect.  I don't think that Kubrick only did take after take with the
stars, he did it with everyone.  What a thrill those actors must have felt
to have a Director bring them to full performance rather than dismissing
them as `background'.
This movie is a very deep study into the workings of a marriage.  Love is
not the only basis for a lasting commitment.  Just as important is trust,
without which, love crumbles.  That is the basis of the plot.  Here is a 
happily married couple, with a darling, educated daughter.  They are
financially secure, socially prominent and physically attracted to each
other.  They have achieved the American dream.  
They are so secure in their relationship that it bothers her when he
doesn't show jealousy about her and a flirtation.  The distrust starts to
build and they jibe at each other.  What happens in the next 48 hours is a
great presentation of what could occur.  
This is a Masterpiece.  This is Art.  I do want to see it again, but I
don't need to.  It's imbedded in my mind.

Title
Review for Elizabeth (1998)
The story of Queen Elizabeth I begins when she is a teen-age princess,
and her half-sister, Mary, is ruling England, Ireland and France.  Both
girls were the daughters of King Henry VIII.   Although Henry had severed
relations with the Catholic Church, Mary and her husband Philip of Spain,
tried to stop the Reformation and bring England back under the power of
the Pope.  It was this struggle between Catholics and Protestants and the
supporters of each that dictated the life of Elizabeth.
Elizabeth was a fun-loving girl who wanted to love and be loved.  She
adored wearing the very finest of clothes and that trait is well portrayed
in the film.  Although Elizabeth came to be known as `The Virgin Queen'
this plot explains how that title came to be bestowed on her.  According
to this script, she did lose her virginity, only to `reclaim' it.
The film successfully describes a period of history that is not that
well known.  The religious issues are graphically depicted, and the
intrigues of the period become better understood.  The acting is excellent
but no character is totally likeable, not even Elizabeth.  Cate Blanchett
matures beautifully as the Queen.  John Gielgud appears in only one scene,
as the Pope.  It is sad that we didn't see more of him.  All of the other
male stars are wonderful in their parts.  
There is some nudity, although it is handled well.   There are also some
very bloody scenes that several people found difficult to watch.  It will
help you enjoy the story if you are up on your English history, especially
the lineage of the Tudors.   The motto of the film is `Absolute Power
Demands Absolute Loyalty'.  It does explain itself.
I would love to see this again, mainly for the lovely scenery, costumes
and inventive camera angles.  I give it a B+.

Title
Review for Armageddon (1998)
If you're into explosions and destruction, there's a lot  in this film. 
It's another one of those "blow up the world" movies that have been done
many times before.   Every cliche that you've ever seen is here including
the "which color  wire do I cut?" scene.  It is totally predictable.  The
familiar format makes us ask, "Which of the supporting cast members will
die?"   You know what's coming before it happens.  But, I liked it.  Most
of the people who do, are females.  Hey, I even cried, even though I
expected the finale.  But I laughed, too, at some very funny lines.
Men, on the other hand, are more technical and more skeptical.  Truly, who
WOULD risk the future of the planet to Bruce Willis and a group of oil
drillers?  Surely, some other nation  would have had an alternate plan, or
would they really  all follow the lead of the good old US?  The big
question here is: Would it be easier to train astronauts to be drillers,
or drillers to be astronauts?  Or couldn't there have been half and half?
For me, this movie was pure escapism.  No, it isn't artistic.  It isn't
well-written or well-acted.   But for what it is, a "blow 'em up" movie. 
I really liked it.  I give it a B+.  And, I would definitely watch it
again.

Title
Review for Thin Red Line, The (1998)
There are not very many veterans of World War II alive today and those
are at least seventy years of age.  To most viewers of The Thin Red Line
the battles of Guadalcanal seem to have merely lasted a few days instead
of the long, bloody, dragged- out siege that it was.
Director Malick has tried to convey the futility of war through the eyes
and reactions of the soldiers, particularly those of Private Fife who has
come to love and appreciate the native life of the pre-battle islanders. 
Using flashbacks Malick jumps from savage shooting to children swimming
underwater, and back again.  There are too many of these cutaway shots.  A
little symbolism goes a long way.
Many of the `stars' who appear are nothing more than cameos.  John
Travolta, portraying the General in charge, looks surprisingly reminiscent
of John Hodiak, a handsome star of the WWII era.  George Clooney has but
one scene as well.  It is said that his role was longer, but was cut. 
Bill Pullman is there, too, but don't blink or you'll miss him.  He says
nothing.
One of the best vignettes is by Woody Harrelson as a well-trained and
dedicated career soldier.  His act of heroism is so well enacted that it's
almost overlooked for what it is.
Others have lauded Nick Nolte, as the psychotic colonel who is determined
to secure the `hill' despite the costs, as an Oscar caliber role.  It is
almost one-dimensional, however, and Sean Penn'' portrayal of the sergeant
serving under his command, is much better.
Some of the best acting is from the unknown actors.  Adrien Brody, Jim
Caviezel and Ben Chaplin are standouts.  Their characters seem a bit
confusing at times as they resemble each other and all those uniforms are
alike.  Even the officers forego wearing insignia.  It is especially
difficult to identify some of the voice-over narration.
Several of the scenes are unusually disturbing such as the American GI
who carries pliers with him to extricate gold teeth from the deadand
dying. And there are the dogs feasting on the corpses.
It is very long, needlessly long and so I only give it a B-. I don't want
to see it again, and neither does my husband, a WWII veteran.

Title
Review for Limbo (1999)
Starring: David Strathairn, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Vanessa        
Martinez, Casey Siemaszko, Kris Kristofferson
Review by: Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic
The Thesaurus says that another word for Limbo is Nothingness.  In this
case, it's not true.  There is so much for the viewer in this marvelous
film.  The scenery alone is breathtaking.  Set in the area surrounding
Juneau, Alaska, you find yourself amazed at the endless terrain.  It must
have been what it was like for the pioneers when they first came to
America, just colder.
The main focus, however, is on the characters.  We get to know them as
real people and we understand why they have chosen to live in such a
remote area.  Each has a reason for seeking a `new' life.    We
immediately feel a relationship for David Strathairn as Joe Gastineau, a
fisherman who does odd-jobs rather than face another tragedy aboard a ship
such as the one that killed the younger brother of Smilin' Jack, played by
Kris Kristofferson.    He is making a delivery to the wedding of the
daughter of a prestigious Alaskan businessman.  Various conversations at
the wedding give us great insight into life in Juneau as it isand as they
wish to portray it to tourists.
Also working at the wedding are Donna and Noelle De Angelo.  Donna,
portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the lead singer for the group
entertaining the guests.  She has suddenly decided to break up with the
bandleader  during a song.  When she walks offstage, she coerces Joe into
taking her into town to pick up her belongings.
Noelle, wonderfully played by Vanessa Martinez, is working there as a
waitress.  She is so good in this role.  You feel all the pain, hurt,
shame, and frustrations that she is going through while watching her
mother again changing boyfriends, this time to Joe.  Her reading of the
diary later in the storyline will definitely move you.
For a while, you think that this is simply a love story, or a story about
Alaska, but it isn't.  It could have limited itself to that and it would
have been very entertaining.  Again, the characters are so perfect.  I
especially liked the two women, who are self-proclaimed lesbians, who
stand up for their rights.  And, there are the graphic scenes in the
salmon packing plant.
When Casey Siemaszko, as Bobby Gastineau, Joe's half-brother shows up,
the plot takes off in another direction.  Survival becomes the big issue. 
 I keep thinking about the end of the movie.  It isn't what I expected. 
When you leave, take another look at the poster.  This film is very good. 
I want to see it again.  I give it a B+.

Title
Review for Ideal Husband, An (1999)
Oscar Wilde must have had fun manipulating all the lovers in his original
story on which An Ideal Husband is based.  This is one of those plots that
you usually associate with the French.  But, it is charming and well worth
seeing.
Rupert Everett portrays Lord Arthur Goring, an eligible bachelor
unwilling to settle down to marriage, much to the chagrin of his father.
When Lord Goring comes to the rescue of his good friend, Sir Robert
Chiltern (Northam) the action takes on the ins and outs of a farce.   Mrs.
Laura Chevely (Moore) a former female `friend' of Lord Goring has suddenly
come back into his life.  He is concerned that his loving wife, Lady
Gertrud Chiltern (Blanchett) will discover his indiscretions and he
prevails upon Lord Goring to go along with the attempt to prevent such an
occurrence.   One narrow escape follows another as characters try to
disguise their identities.  
Mable Chiltern (Driver), Sir Robert's sister, is infatuated with Lord
Goring, as are most of the other women in his life, including Lady
Gertrud.  Her presence adds greatly to the fiasco.
Period movies such as this are a delight so watch if only to see the sets,
the costumes, and the lifestyle of the era.  It looks like it would be a
wonderful way to live, until you realize how difficult it would be to
sustain such a way of doing things, not to mention the discomfort of
wearing those constricting clothes.
An Ideal Husband is not a great film, but it is enjoyable and fun.   I'll
probably watch it again when it comes on to free TV.  It deserves a solid
B.

Title
Review for Pecker (1998)
When you first hear that Pecker is a John Waters film, you know that you
are in for something unusual.  Pecker is certainly that, and more.
Pecker, played by Edward Furlong, spends his time with an inexpensive
camera taking photos of everything that he sees and loves, and Pecker sees
beauty in everything, and everybody.  From his girlfriend, [Christina
Ricci] who runs the local Laundromat, to his grandmother who sells pit
beef sandwiches from a stand in front of their house, and has a statue of
the Virgin Mary that talks.
This very dysfunctional family has no idea that they are not your
everyday normal group.  Pecker's mother, played beautifully by Mary Kay
Place, runs a thrift shop catering mainly to the homeless.  This is where
she got the camera that Pecker uses to change their lives.
Pecker's father runs a local bar that is being run out of business
because of another bar down the street that presents full female frontal
nudity, even though it's against the law.
Pecker had two sisters, as well.  The younger one is a hyper child
addicted to sugar.  The older sister is the hostess at a gay bar, trade
show.
They are all his subjects. It is through the thieving of Pecker's best
friend that he has plenty of film for his masterpieces.  With a bit of
misdirection, he loads his pockets with rolls and rolls.  When they
convince Pecker's boss at the diner to allow a "showing" of his photos,
all of his subjects come to view them.  Additionally, an artist's rep from
New York sees a flyer and visits as well.  She loves his work and arranges
a showing in the big city.  That's when all of their lives change.  There
are some very funny moments.  Except for the "beaver" shot in the illegal
show, there is not really any nudity.  Rather there are somewhat
suggestive scenes of all types, especially in the gay bar.
It is an enjoyable movie if you are an aficionado of Waters' films.

Title
Review for Anywhere But Here (1999)
        Anywhere But Here certainly qualifies as a chick flick.  I doubt that
guys can relate to the main characters.  Susan Sarandon and Natalie
Portman portray Adele and Ann August, mother and daughter living through a
very difficult age, the three years from Ann's 14th. Birthday, until she
heads for college at 17.
        If you're a mother you can identify with all the frustrations that Adele
faces.  She sincerely wants what's best for Ann, although Ann doesn't want
itat the time.  As a typical teen Ann wants her privacy and her
independence, and most of all, she doesn't want to be `embarrassed' by her
mother.  It's difficult for a parent not to embarrass a child.  Either you
dress too drab or too flashy. You're too protective, or you don't care
enough.  That's the basic storyline of Anywhere But Here; mother and
daughter learning to accept each other.  Strangely, their most profound
advisor is a traffic cop.
        Most of the other characters are little more than vignettes but each and
every one is delivered with believability.
        I particularly liked the reference made to grunion hunting.  Yes, there
really is such a thing.  We aren't talking about Snipe hunting or
submarine races.  Some of my fondest childhood memories are the nights
that my family went grunion hunting.  This is a sport limited to the
beaches of Southern California.  During the summer, when there's a full
moon, the grunions spawn on the beaches.  They come in on one wave, spin
into the sand on their tails laying their eggs, and go out with the next
wave.  The trick is to catch them with your hands in between the two waves
without being knocked down by the waves yourself.  Warning!  They are very
slippery.  If you ever have the chance, try it.  As for the movie, you can
try it, too.  It's not bad, but it's not that special.  Because of the
acting, I give it a B.  It wouldn't bother me to see it again, but if I
don'tno big deal.

Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
American Beauty, Starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch,
Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley, and Chris Cooper
Directed by Sam Mendes
The catch phrase for American Beauty is `When you've got nothing to lose,
you might as well risk everything. At first glance Lester Burnham (Spacey)
appears to have everything to lose.  His is the typical suburban life,
with a lovely home, wife, daughter, and a well-paying job.  But that's at
first glance.  The more we get to know Lester, the more we understand his
actions.
Every character in the film reminds me of someone I know, including
myself although probably not to the extent that others see me.  Lester
himself is a quiet man routinely going through life, accepting his
surroundings.  He's one of the good guys.  His wife, Carolyn, is the
driving force in the family.  She is the one who sets the rules and
expects total compliance from Lester, their daughter, their neighbors, and
everyone that she encounters including her real estate customers.  She is
determined to project the `right' image, complete with a garden full of
American Beauty roses.  
Their daughter is on the high school cheerleading squad as is her friend,
a cute little blonde sexpot.  As Lester's life starts to crumble about
him, he envisions himself in an interlude with the blonde, and the rose
petals are cleverly interposed with those fantasies.
There are many subplots throughout the storyline, and all of them are
well-written, acted, and directed.  The neighbors are an assorted lot,
including the teenage boy who stalks Lester's daughter.   The male couple
who live on the other side of the Burnhams are well placed and they are an
integral part of the plot.
It is an exceptional plot and one that will stay with you for a while. 
Now that I know what happens, I want to see it again.  It deserves an A
for its unusual delivery.

Title
Review for Opposite of Sex, The (1998)
It is usually difficult for child stars to prove that they can play
grown-up roles.  There is no doubt that Christina Ricci has made the
transition.  She is a wonderful slut!
How times have changed.  There was a day when young girls prepared for a
date by pinching their cheeks to give them a touch of blush.  Christina
pinches her nipples!
Without a doubt, Christina doesn't care for anyone but herself, but she
makes every male think that he is special to her allowing her to "use"
them in various ways.  
When her stepfather dies, the sixteen year-old Christina leaves home to
live with her half-brother [Martin Donovan] whose gay lover has recently
died, leaving him financially independent.  Christina manages to seduce
his new lover, and then convinces him that he is the father of her
expected child.   
Lisa Kudrow, as the sister of the dead lover, does not like Christina,
and makes no attempt to hide her feelings.  In a very unglamorous role,
she turns in an excellent portrayal of a woman with   deep feelings, who
needs to be loved.  Luckily for her, Lyle Lovett comes along.  But as a
local sheriff, he's there for other reasons as well.
This is a memorable movie.  It does a good job of portraying the world of
a gay man in today's society.  It'll make you laugh as well as cry.   
This is definitely not a movie for everyone, but if you like it...you'll
love it.  I give it a firm B.
I'd watch it again on TV, but some of the scenes will probably be cut out.

Title
Review for Waking Ned Devine (1998)
There is more than one definition for the word, Wake, and when you learn
that this is an Irish movie, you realize which definition it has.  This is
a truly enjoyable, funny film from the moment it begins until the final
sunset.
There are few people who haven't dreamed of winning the lottery.  All
those millions of dollars would certainly change our lives, but how? 
Would we spend it?  Invest it?  Give it away?  Share it with friends? 
When a winning lottery ticket is sold in the town of Tulaigh Mhor,
Ireland, a town of only 52 residents, the question is.who owns the ticket?
Ian Bannen and David Kelly set out to uncover the winner by being
especially nice to the one[s] they suspect hold the coveted ticket. 
First, they buy drinks for `Pig' Finn when he suddenly appears in a sports
car. Then, the lady at the post office [who sold the ticket]. But, the
real comedy begins when they discover that Ned Devine bought the winner,
and the shock of seeing the numbers was too much for him.  As Ned had no
heirs, the money will go to the state.  They are sure that Ned wouldn't
have wanted that to happen, so they concoct a scheme to claim the jackpot
for themselves.  
The humor that follows is clever and original.  There is a scene with
David Kelly on a motor scooter that will stay in my memory for years.  The
telling of the plot cannot take the place of seeing it for yourself.  In
the course of the story, you learn about most of the 52 residents of the
town.  You get to know them and you care about their lives.  And, the
question remains, what would Ned Devine have done with the money?  The
plot takes one turn after another, but they are always believable.  You
can foresee some of the things that occur, but they aren't always what you
expect.
An audience member remarked to me that she was surprised that there were
no four-letter words in an Irish movie.  It was a strange statement, I
thought.  The same could be said about American movies.  Waking Ned Devine
is an excellent example of wonderful dialogue that doesn't need to stoop
to that level for humor.
I cannot wait to see this movie again.  And, I want to take others to
see it as well.  I hope that this gets the same word of mouth that `The
Full Monty' got.  People who see it will love it, even though there are no
big name stars.  I give it an A-.

Title
Review for Bug's Life, A (1998)
Disney Studios' latest full-length animation film is delightful.   It
tells the story of a colony of ants that work and slave to provide food
for the dreaded grasshoppers that descend upon them each year and take
their harvest.  Then, after the grasshoppers have left, the ants can
gather the remaining food for themselves.  Unfortunately, as the
grasshoppers arrive, their food is accidentally destroyed by Flick, a
well-meaning but accident-prone ant.    
Flik ventures off the `island' to look for other bugs who can help the
ants defend themselves against the `hoppers' who have promised to return
for their allotment. 
He goes to the Big City where he finds a group of circus bugs, from a
Flea Circus, who agree to go with him thinking that it is a booking to
entertain the ants.  The theatrical troupe is almost as inept as Flik, but
somehow they manage to pull it all together.
When I was a child, there was a Disney comic book that featured the lives
of the Bug family.  This movie reminds me of it.  They use the discards of
human beings to furnish their homes.  An animal cracker cookie box becomes
the circus wagon.  It's fun to watch for those treasures in the background.
There is humor for everyone.  There are jokes aimed at children, and
others aimed at the adults, but none of them are improper for the kids. 
It was wonderful to hear the children laughing out loud and then, to hear
adults catching a clever double entendre.
Identifying the voices is a game unto itself.  Some belong to old,
familiar actors, others to total unknowns, and some in between.  Most of
us had to watch to see who they were. 
Some of the cleverest footage comes at the end of the film as those
credits roll by.  There are some very enjoyable `out takes', even more so
when you realize that there's no such thing as an animated `out take'.
I do want to see this again, probably with my grandchildren.  I give it a
solid B.
