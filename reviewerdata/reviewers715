Review for Born on the Fourth of July (1989)
     I just saw BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  I can't find fault with any of the
film's messages.  Its scenes held together okay.  Technically it was fine.
     However, I did not find the film entertaining, and it did not emotionally
involve me very much.  It seemed to be more of a collage of scenes from the era
than a story.  The film's one message -- that the Vietnam war was a mistake --
was beaten until it was dead.  I kept waiting for something to *happen*.  For
the development of any one of the other characters.  His brother.  Charlie in
Mexico.  His father.  His high school sweetheart.  One of his friends.
     Unfortunately, Ron was the only character who we see throughout the film.
His character development consisted of his change from blind patriotism to his
disillusionment with the government.  Very simple, we see it coming, it's no
big surprise when it happens.
     I haven't read the book the movie's based on; perhaps they follow it
faithfully, which I suppose is a good thing.  However, there's a couple of
things I would like to have seen in the movie:
     Individually, I thought the scenes were well done and powerful.  However,
I wish they would have been tied together into a stronger story.  The film came
off as little more than highlight's of Ron's life and the Vietnam era.  I left
the theater with the feeling that I'd already seen the whole movie in the
preview and the video on MTV.  I wish it would have had a more complex message.
