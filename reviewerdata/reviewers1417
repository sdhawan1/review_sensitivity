Review for Time to Kill, A (1996)
Directed by: Joel Schumacher
Cast: Sandra Bullock (Ellen Roark), Samuel L. Jackson (Carl Lee Hailey), 
Matthew McConaughey (Jake Brigance), Brenda Fricker (Ethel Twitty), 
Kevin Spacey (Rufus Buckley), Charles Dutton (Sheriff Ozzie Walls), 
Patrick McGoohan (Judge Omar Noose), Donald Sutherland (Lucien 
Wilbanks), Oliver Platt (Harry Rex Vonner), Ashley Judd (Carla), Kiefer 
Sutherland (Freddie Cobb), Devin Lloyd (Willy), Terry Loughlin (Sisco), 
M. Emmet Walsh (Defense Psychologist)
Written by: Akiva Goldsman, John Grisham(novel)
Theatres: Golden Village Theatres.
Will a black man ever receive a fair trial from an all-white jury in a 
Southern US state? Will Sandra Bullock ever run out of hair to flick out 
of her eyes, and can John Grisham write a book that doesn't have the 
word "CONSPIRACY" flashing metaphysically across every one of its pages?
These, and other similarly urgent issues, are some of the things that 
will fascinate in A TIME TO KILL, the latest book-turned-movie from John 
"It's just you the reader and me the hero against the FBI, the entire 
American judicial system, and the Darn Way Things Just Are" Grisham.
In poverty-baked Missisippi, a tiny, sweet black girl is tortured, raped 
and left to die by a group of racuous, evil White Boys. Arrested and 
waiting for trial, they are then assailed and shot point blank by the 
girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey, played by a glowering Samuel Johnson.  
Enter the (by now) much talked about Matthew McWhatisname, Mr Esquire 
Magazine cum Guess Jeans Good Looks, as the young, white GoodHearted 
lawyer friend who takes on Hailey's defence, Jake Brigance.
Throw in Kevin Spacey as the dead confident prosecutor with a shakey 
Southern accent (if Sandra Bullock puts in the only believable 
performance of the whole cast, it must surely be because she doesn't 
have to Sound Southern), Donald Sutherland as Brigance's mostly drunk 
now but previously brilliant mentor, a mean, twisted Keifer Sutherland 
as the rapist's brother who's main purpose in the story is to Make Sure 
There's Trouble, and a burly, amoral Oliver Platt as Brigance's oily, 
wise-cracking sidekick for good measure, and you pretty much have the 
whole story. For extra insurance, the film's makers have thrown in the 
darkly beautiful Sandra Bullock in the role of, in her own words, 
"brilliant law student," who rushes down for the summer to help Brigance 
with his case. 
Finally there's Ashley Judd, Brigance's young wife, whose main job seems 
to be walking around the Brigance's new house in tank tops and sweating 
a lot, and his achingly cute blonde daughter. Both comprise a nice White 
parallel to the Black Hailey's own loving family, and form the empathic 
comaparison between the successful Brigance and the misfortunate Hailey.
One of Brigance's main concerns is that if he were Hailey, he would have 
done exactly what he did.
If I seem preoccupied with identifying "character types" and Plot 
Structures, it's only because that's how the movie seemed to work the 
whole time. While most of the characters were nicely etched out and the 
script is generally well-written, I got the feeling that the movie was 
more interested in presenting issues to its audience than actually 
working them out. For example, there are the scarey KKK scenes that 
bring out the powerful weirdness and danger of racism, but that don't 
seem to amount to anything in the conclusion, the will-they-won't-they 
thing between Bullock and McConnaughy that abruptly concludes without 
one iota of resolution, and the this-case-is-breaking-up-my-family 
schtick that Brigance has to go through that culminates in a scene that 
I can only describe as surreal. 
In the end, although there are a lot of things going on in A TIME TO 
KILL, nothing really happens. The film is hardly a courtroom thriller, 
because McConaughey spends more time arguing with his wife, drinking 
tequila with Bullock, and taking long meadow walks with Sutherland than
actually preparing for, or even doing anything, in court. His final 
courtroom summation is feeble and maudlin, and cannot convince an 
audience well-versed in the verbal maneuvering of David Kelley drama 
series (Picket Fences and L.A. Law), or even previous courtroom movies 
that turn on racial or social issues like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD or 
MURDER IN THE FIRST.
Conclusion: although somewhat interesting, I didn't think this movie was 
worth $7.

Review for Cable Guy, The (1996)
Directed by: Ben Stiller
Written by: Judd Apatow (uncredited), Lou Holtz Jr.
Cast: Matthew Broderick (Steven Kovacs), Jim Carrey ("Chip Douglas"),  Leslie 
Mann (Robin), Jack Black (Rick), George Segal (Mr Kovacs), Diane Baker (Mrs 
Kovacs).
Produced by:  Columbia Pictures / Licht/Mueller Film Corporation
Running Time: About 90 minutes.
Rating : *** out of *****
Theatres : Just about everywhere.
These are probably the best and worst lines in THE CABLE GUY, and in a
knowing, twisted film-student-with-a-vengeance sort of way, the combined
effort of director Ben Stiller (whom I hereby forgive forever for making
REALITY BITES) and writer Holtz is a dark and magnificently lunatic
mock-celebration of the flickering blue parent generation. OK, it's also
an excessive throw-in-all-the-popular-media-references-you-can type of
smartass caper with more intelligent directing than most of Carrey's
other films (although that isn't saying much), but being the first with
an actual body-functions-joke minimum, this film could very well be
Carrey's first into the comedians-can-act-too spectrum of Hollywood.
Unlike previous Jim Carrey successes like the Ace Ventura movies or DUMB
AND DUMBER, which were no more than empty vehicles for Carrey's manic
personality and a surprisingly inventive number of flatulent jokes, The
Cable Guy not only has a plot that follows to conclusion, more
importantly--gasp!--it has a concept: too much TV is, well, it's just
bad for you.
This is overwhelmingly proved by Chip Douglas (Carrey), the cable guy 
who fixes architext Steven Kovacs up with free cable television 
channels and then, taking Kovacs' unwilling friendship for granted, 
proceeds to mess up his life in a number of ways: he throws mind-splinting 
karaoke parties, wrecks friendly basketball games, stalks Stephen and 
eventually lands him in jail.  As Chip, Carrey is the optimum product of
self-conscious popular media gone deliciously and disturbingly wrong. He 
relates everything to television past and present, assaulting his newly 
appointed *schlemielman* with catchphrase melanges from sixties sitcoms 
and reenacting movie scenes with a screaming, maniacal sense of irrelevence 
that is darkly engaging to us postmodern audiences (or maybe just me), and 
morally unsettling to people like my parents, who would consider Mr Carrey 
to be a product of a satanic cult instead of mere television. 
But then of course, isn't that the point? CABLE GUY is *about* the
dangers of television, if we are to believe the desperation on
Chip-Carrey's face as he dangles from a gigantic satellite above
imminent doom. *Somebody has to kill the babysitter*, he implores,
bringing to mind the kitschy flashback the film provided its audience
earlier about Chip's childhood loneliness, sans siblings and parents,
leading to a life of absorption in front of the TV.
But the moment, like everything in this movie, turns on itself with a
beautiful slow-motion climax that intensifies to blackness, resembling
the same metafictional acknowledgement of media-constructed realities in
the ending of that British bastion of silliness now revered by millions
across the world--Carrey's earlier counterparts--Monty Python's Holy
Grail.
In the end, CABLE GUY is worth watching if only to see Carrey
actually sort of act. Or at least, acknowledge the presence of his cast.
Perhaps this is more to director Stiller's credit, who refuses to allow
the film to degenerate into yet another Carrey showcase. Delightful
surprise guest appearances from Stiller and longtime partner in crime
Janeane Garafalo also keep the enjoyment going when Carrey's
hyperactivity annoys--and make no mistake, he will annoy, though far
less than in previous movies--and Carrey's own performance, subdued as
it is, is near-perfect for the media pastiche (the word no
self-respecting postmodernist would leave home without) that he
represents.
Like Mork (and much like Robin Williams himself), Carrey's comedy evokes
every pose, every gesture, every facial expression, tone and technical
idea ever used in the history of modern media, aggrandized and
fast-forwarded to grotesque proportions to pass for humor. Like Mork,
Carey's Chip Douglas (the name itself, the film reveals, is filched from
"My Three Sons," so Carey's character is literally nameless, never truly
identified, and a macabre inversion of Leone's Man With No Name) merges
real life conversation with commercial snippets and a movie quotes
compendium, and a paranoid self-consciousness that ironically blends
fantasy with real life. "If this were a movie, there would be danger
music," he snarls while playing villain with Stephen's girlfriend, 
singing along *with* the actual soundtrack with knowing vengeance.
It is therefore perhaps the film's self-awareness on the whole that
makes THE CABLE GUY weird, what with its parodic freeze frames and the
vicious mock-reality celebrity trials to name a few of the fun things
Stiller gets the film up to. And Hollywood has never taken to
metadramatics very well.  THE CABLE GUY was generally badly received by
critics and grossed little more than it took to make at the US Box
Office (according to figures taken from the Internet Movie Database).
Still, I recommend this film for its widescreen absurdity, great
performances all round, and its dark vision of our crazy lives. Carry
on, Carrey.

Title
Review for Truth About Cats & Dogs, The (1996)
Directed by: Michael Lehmann
Written by: Audrey Wells
Produced by: 20th Century Fox / Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.
Cast:   Uma Thurman (Noelle Slusarsky), Janeane Garofalo (Abby Barnes),
 Ben Chaplin (Brian).
Run Time: 97 minutes
Rating: **1/2 out of *****
Theatres: Lido, Jurong.
THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS should really be called THE
TRUTH ABOUT  HOW TO DRESS IN A HOLLYWOOD FILM. On the
surface it may seem to be what everyone says it is: a Cyrano de Bergerac
story with a gender twist and a sweetheart ending blah blah blah ... 
Yawn.
This we know, and the ending we can guess without even stepping into this
film. In THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS, Janeane Garofalo is an
intelligent and cultured animal guru who runs--yes, get this--a radio 
show,
where she soothes away her callers' pet problems by recognizing and
diagnosing every symptom they decribe. Garofalo  plays the violin,
reads thick books and is one with every single animal she meets, except 
for
men. Men ignore her because she is short and brunette, and does not wear
concealer.
Unlike her beautiful neighbour Uma Thurman, who lives in a terraced
ground floor apartment, has never received gift books without pictures
(how many times have we heard that one?), who always wears long, swishy,
 spring dresses, sweaters tied around her waist and is blonde, tall, thin 
and
cutely dorky with her oversized, liquid eyes and sharp cheekbones and 
dewy
skin, Janeane is a little rounder, she's petite, she wears dark colors, 
but
most of all, she wears her hair in a Kathy Bates do  from MISERY. In
MISERY Kathy Bates played a psychotic nurse who breaks handsome
James Caan's legs so that she can keep him in her house with her. Kathy
Bates was also overweight, and she was plain and didn't have a boyfriend,
so, clearly, she was insane. In DIABOLIQUE Kathy Bates wore her hair in
a slightly more decent style, but she wore pants all the time and didn't 
comb
her hair, so, clearly, she was a man-basher with lesbian tendencies. 
Unlike
Kathy in both films, Uma Thurman is a blonde goddess for
whom things always work out. As Janeane herself puts it: "when you burp
men think it's cute, when you throw up they want to hold your hair back."
In CATS &  DOGS, Uma dresses in pastel colours all the time and has a 
cute,
layered wispy haircut, but because she is so beautiful she also isn't 
afraid to
pull her hair back for that sixties' "no fringe" look that makes women
look baldfaced unless they have good bone structure.
What this all goes to show is that in the fabled worlds that Hollywood
creates for us to lose ourselves in, women are women and men are men.
Men, of course, can sometimes be women, as Patrick Swayze and Denzel
Washington proved in TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING,
JULIE NEWMARR, but when women dress like men it means that men don't
find them attractive. So although Janeane is short and dumpy, she wears
*skirts*, which proves that she is potentially attractive to men, and
that all she needs is better hair and some pore minimizer.
But when Janeane falls in love with a man, she doesn't go out and get a
makeover as you would expect, but instead convinces gorgeous Uma
to pretend to *be* her. Throughout the whole movie, Janeane is very
insecure about her looks, and director Michael Lehmann, who also directed
HEATHERS and AIRHEADS, is always pointing out to us, the audience,
that men ignore her but cannot stop looking at Uma. Men don't hold
doors open for Janeane, but when it comes to Uma, they get into accidents
because their eyes are on her crossing the road instead of
on the cars in front of them. Naturally, Janeane, who has already lost a
lot of weight since her portly days in REALITY BITES,  is somewhat 
perturbed
 about this, and even though she and Brain (Ben Chaplin) hit it off on 
the
phone and connect so well that they can have sex without even meeting
each other, she worries that when Brian, who is sexy, arty and has an 
accent,
finds out he has been shtupping her instead of the Goddess Uma, he will 
be
angry and
she will lose him.
Unaware that she is in the safe zone and will in all likelihood get her
man--she wears skirts, is not as huge as Kathy Bates, and also looks
very nice in russet tones--Janeane gets very tangled in the process
of deceiving poor Brian, who, bless his soul, is a dimwit not to realize
that Janeane, whom he talks to on the phone all the time, has a much
richer and lower voice than Uma's higher-pitched, perky drawl. Things
 get rather messy towards the end, but you'll probably want to find
out how it turns out for yourself. The movie mostly champions Janeane's
cause, although Uma is portrayed as a nice, well-meaning person, and all
through it I wanted to reach out and comfort her, and say,
"Janeane, it's really ok. You're almost there. You were only Wynona's
best friend in REALITY BITES, but you've lost so much weight that
you're now a lead veterinarian. Ricki Lake lost a hundred pounds and
they gave her the number two talk show in America. Oprah is number
one only because 9 million people tune in every day just to see how much 
weight
she's lost or put on that day (I say "lost or put on" because with Oprah
it's such a mystery all the time, and that's why I watch Oprah too). One
day, Janeane, you'll be thin enough to have your own bathing suit scene,
and then you'll be the topactress in Hollywood."
Although its overall premise is a little silly, I enjoyed this movie very 
much
because of Janeane herself, who is funny, sharp and delivers her lines 
with a
wryness that reminds me of old Hollywood wise-cracking heroines like
Bette Davis. And despite the silliness of her being so hip that Brian 
gives
her a book of letters from Sartre to Simone Bouvoir, yet still inable to 
fathom
that Brian loves her for her brain and not for Uma's body, this movie
moves along quickly, has some nice, funny lines that will make you smile,
and is a relief from movies with Tom Cruise wearing rubber masks and 
dangling
from ceilings.

Review for Eraser (1996)

Written by: Michael S. Chernuchin, Walon Green, Tony Puryear
Cast : Arnold Schwarzenegger (John Kruger, the Eraser), James Caan
(Robert Deguerin),  Robert Pastorelli (Johnny C), James Coburn

Rating : ** out of *****
Well I guess it's that time of the year again. The one time of the year
where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even *try* writing
a script that has more dialogue than explosions. It's also the best
time for the handful of existing bigtime Hollywood Mr Action Heroes to
dust off their miniscule vocabularies, pull on their black vests and
charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become
memorable catchphrases. In America they call this time  "summer" and
it happens once every year. And maybe it's the exposure to all that
nasty sun that does it, but in the process normally weak, insipid lines
like "Consider this a divorce," "Hasta la vista, baby," and "You're the
disease. I'm the cure" actually
 do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of
biblical proverbs. This is not entirely a bad thing, of course.
What am I talking about? I'm talking about the summer "blockbusters,"
the "action thrillers," the "this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know-
everyone's-going-to-go" explosions, gas threats, flying saucers, and
special effects.  In the rash of "my, what big guns you have, but wait!
mine are bigger" movies, there are also the usual
boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environment movies (or whale, whatever), and
*this* year, the odd crop of "save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment-
threats" offerings. I'm talking about the three BATMANS, the SPEEDS,
the TERMINATORS, etc.  This year I'm talking about TWISTER,
INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE ARRIVAL, THE ROCK, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, and of
course, ERASER.
Here in Singapore, as our local movie critics like to whine, we seem to
get the pick of the crop of "my explosion is more real-looking than
yours" movies, but nothing else. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE opened in our
theatres almost as soon as it did in the US. The same goes for ERASER,
which is unfortunate for Arnold Schwarzenegger because  coming so soon
after what Time magazine recently called "Mission: Unavoidable"
 (on account of its worldwide mega-advertising blitz), ERASER seems
like a cheaper, less thoughtful imitation. That's saying a lot, because
MI the movie was already a cheap, thoughtless imitation of its TV
originator of the '60s/'70s.  
 In ERASER, Arnie is a US federal
marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their
lives in danger. He does this by destroying all evidence of their
present existence and re-situating them with new identities. His new
case is Lee Cullen, played by Vanessa Williams who, unlike all the
other scumbags he's ever relocated, is "an actual, real life honest
person." Because she's so good, and has such nice legs, Arnold spends
the whole movie trying to protect her, and only uses the opening movie
sequence to save Robert Pastorelli from *his* killers. Lee obtains
evidence that the high-technology weapons company she works for is
secretly selling sophisticated, black-market arms to people with
foreign accents and stringy hair. Of course, as the formula goes, her
revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it
because heck, there are people in high places who will go down with
this, because yes, this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the
world (that is, America) since Watergate.
In protecting Lee, Arnold is framed by the mentor-turned-evil Robert
Deguerin, nicely played by James Caan, and ends up having to prove that
he isn't the one killing the programme's witnesses in addition to
making sure Lee isn't accidentally torpedo-ed to death by the new,
green guns his enemies all have.  It's around this time that people in
the theatre with me starting humming the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE theme,
because Arnie's mission includes breaking into a high-security building
to run a disk.
I guess I should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in
this movie is so antsy about. It's an electro-magnetic pulse gun thing
which fires aluminium missiles, and which can see through walls. It has
some sort of X-ray vision, so its user can target the victim's heart
even from great distances. Despite this, which I figure is a pretty
cool feature in a gun (though I'm certainly no expert), however,
Arnold, whose own heart is targeted a number of times, *never* goes
flying 10 feet backwards with a two-foot missile through his chest like
all the others who get shot by this gun. Instead he outruns and
outsmarts his trackers each time, giving eery and ironic resonance to
that TERMINATOR line that practically made him famous: "I'll be back."
Like everyone else in the theater, I left the movie feeling that the
trailers had duped me, because they made me want to watch this movie
voluntarily. Although there is a *lot* of violence in this movie, not
to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators, I
recommend this movie to most over-18s who need some therapeutic
mindless action to get over the weirdness of FARGO or the hangover
effect of LEAVING LAS VEGAS.

Review for Victory (1995)
Directed by : Mark Peploe
Written by :  Mark Peploe, Fred Siedel, novel by Josef Conrad
Cast :  Simon Callow, Willem Dafoe, Patrick Field, Irene Jacob, Michael 
Lee,
Graziano Marcelli, Sam Neill (Mr. Jones), Bill Paterson, Rufus Sewell,
Jean Yanne, Ho Yi
Rating : ** out of *****
Theatres : Lido Classics.
Based on the novel set in 1914 by Joseph Conrad, Victory spins a tale
of a pair of lovers, Heyst (William Dafoe) and Alma (Irene Jacob),
who seek refuge on Heyst's isolated island. However, their idyllic world
begins to crumble upon the arrival of Mr Jones (Sam Neil), Martin Ricardo
(Rufus Sewell) and their servant, Pedro (Graziano Marcelli), who have
come to steal Heyst's rumoured plunder. While the novel is largely 
complex
in characterization, the   film sadly transposes Conrad's characters into
lacklustre leads, the most disappointing being Heyst himself.
Conrad's Heyst adheres religiously to his late father's ways of 
detachment
and isolation. His ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he 
meets
Alma, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice. The 
struggle
 to embrace the arrival of Alma into his solitude, however, is lost in 
Mark
Peploe's (director and writer) diluted version of Heyst. Without properly
establishing the crucial details of Heyst's character, all that is left 
of
Conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal 
conflict
 between detachment and human involvement. On the one hand, actualizing
the subtext is a mammoth task (though not impossible), but on the other
 hand, Dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism. 
In the
end, we are supposed to witness Heyst renounce his philosophy and finally
come to an understanding of what it is to love another. The final
transformation, while perceptible, lacks the cathartic revelation
which is undeniable in Conrad's novel. Its absence in the film is 
unforgivable.
The film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so
much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete
strangers. Alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers
in the relationship, namely Heyst's underlying philosophy of detachment,
which Heyst himself grapples with. The struggle against Heyst's ignorance
of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of Alma's 
love
for him. Jacob, fair-skinned, gentle and yet passionate, handles the role
with precision, detailing nuances where possible. Unfortunately, she is 
let
down by a superficial script. The couple's relationship develops too
hastily, leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant 
show-and-tell
 approach.
 All we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone.
This is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two
stem from their buried thoughts and emotions. The sketchy handling of 
their
relationship stands out as sorely as Dafoe's American accent (an
inappropriate one since Heyst spent most of his life in London).
The other characters such as Schomberg (Jean Yanne), the owner
 of a hotel, and Mr Jones (Sam Neill) , also fall short of Conrad's
meticulous characterization. While Schomberg should have been more
 menacing and vindictive, Mr Jones should have been portrayed as 
something
 more of an enigma. Sam Neil's caricature of a slightly stout, effeminate
and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by
 Conrad who describes Mr Jones as "an insolent spectre on leave from
Hades, endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror".
Poor characterization aside, kudos goes to Rufus Sewell for his excellent
portrayal of Ricardo, secretary to Mr Jones, a reckless  ruffian capable 
of
murder. Sewell, with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes,
becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity, masterminding deceitful 
plans
behind Jones' back.  At the same time, we are entertained by the 
foolhardiness
of his plans.
Despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by Bruno De
 Keyzer, very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film
has ended. Sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have
their charm, but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence
of an epic, which is what Victory deserves to be. The delicately
 inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate
production. At the end of the film, we are told that perhaps Alma's
 victory was in teaching Heyst how to love. A hollow victory indeed.
