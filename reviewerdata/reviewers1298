Title
Review for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987)
     I just got back from seeing the new SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE.
What a joke!  The theatre was anything but peaceful; everyone kept laughing at
the unreal circumstances Mr. "man" kept getting into and out of.
     As you'll notice in the opening credits (in the end ones too, if you're
not in too much of a hurry to get out before anyone recognizes you), Reeve
himself co-wrote this epic.  Well, it takes guts to write a terrible script and
then to act it out.  He even had the classic superhero speeches such as his
"the subway is still a safe place for people."
     The movie did, however, have the usual moments of good humor, much like the
other movies.  Clark reveals his true powers briefly and by accident at some
good points.  And his role reversal (trying to be both Superman and Kent) I
thought was pretty humorous too.
     There were even parts of the plot I could say were pleasingly surprising
such as Superman's turning old and the coincidental retrieval (and even
existence) of Krypton's last power--the power module of Kent's spaceship (sure
was lucky he got it when he did, eh?).
     In general, Chistopher Reeve, I believe, is bucking to get out of the
Superman business.  I do not think there will be much of an audience for
another one.  The movie was either very child-oriented or the producers have a
hard time seeing us viewers as anything more than children.
