     This movie was INCREDIBLE!!!!!!  American Express has been showing
previews of movies for their loyal card members and I just happen to
know one of them who couldn't go to the show.  So, you guessed it, I
went in his place.  And it is something that I will be eternally
grateful for.
     This movie is based on the true story of the CONLON FOUR who were
wrongly accused of the bombing of a London pub.  The movie starts out
in Belfast, Northern Ireland and shows the British military occupying
the city.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerard (Gerry for short), a young man
struggling to live with the military watching his every move (the
British vs. the I.R.A.).
     I haven't cried so hard and for so long in a movie.  The movie is
a gut-wrenching tale of innocent people sentenced to prison for a
bombing that was done by the I.R.A.
     The acting was fantastic.  As usual Daniel Day-Lewis submerged
into his character so much in fact that I kept on asking my self is
that him????
     I am sorry that I am so sketch on details but PLEASE go see this
movie it is definitely worth seeing more than once.
     Since I am so "not gifted" in writing this if you have any other
questions you can e-mail me at kw2m+@andrew.cmu.edu.
