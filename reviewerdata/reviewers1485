Review for Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999)
Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo
http://www.ram.org/ramblings/movies/deuce_bigalow_male_gigolo.html
/Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo/ is a low-brow comedy not quite up to the
scale of an /Austin Powers/, /There's Something About Mary/ or /Dumb
and Dumber/, but it is on par with a /Big Daddy/.
As is usually the case, the movie is a bunch of one-screen gags strung
together in the hope of making the audience laugh continually. Because
of the great mood I was in, this generally worked. The plot is just a
showcase for the gags: Deuce (/Saturday Night Live/'s Rob Schneider)
is a fish tank cleaner who ends up being responsible for taking care
of the apartment of Antoine (Oded Fehr), a male prostitute.  When
Deuce begins to monkey around, he manages to destroy a $6000 aquarium,
which he must replace or face Antoine's wrath. Needless to say, Deuce
begins to sell his "services" to pay for the damage.  This results in
a somewhat hilarious sequence of episodes where Deuce finally realises
his niche in life and finds true love.
/Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo/ has its high spots. In particular, the
parody of /The Matrix/ is pretty hilarious. The main politically
incorrect focus of the film is primarily on physically handicapped
people who are, in a way, outcasts of society.  Deuce's services
involve making these people feel "normal" again and this is done by
taking some risk (of offending the audience) which I appreciated.
Generally though, the one-track nature of this approach became
tiresome after a while.
The trailer is a bit misleading compared to what actually happens in
the film (like in the trailer for /Go/) which can be interesting, as
is the novel way the Tourette's syndrome problem is handled. /Deuce
Bigalow: Male Gigolo/ wil induce a few laughs if you're in the right
mood.  Worth renting.
