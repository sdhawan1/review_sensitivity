Title
Review for Psycho (1998)
     Look!  The new version of "Psycho" came out and the world didn't end!  I
guess Gus Van Sant really ISN'T the bringer of the Apocalypse!
     Unfortunately, though, that "Psycho" didn't end the world as we know is
the best thing that can be said for it.
     Van Sant's controversial "re-telling" of Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960
film has polarized filmgoers everywhere (even before it premiered.)  Without
benefit of an actual viewing, many have said that the film will, at best,
suck.  Being an (almost) good critic, I waited until I actually saw it to
decide that the film, at best, sucked (and that concludes the use of the word
"suck" and, hopefully, the thoughts that I am a brain-dead orangutan.)
     Director Gus Van Sant took the original Hitchcock film and refilmed it,
shot-for-shot, using the same, exact script (with a few minor alterations.)
The inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary, even
though a large group of the audience will know EXACTLY what will happen at the
EXACT time. 
     Suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to
create something new or different than the original.  Sadly, that did not
occur.  It is hard to be overshadowed by Vera Miles and John Gavin (from the
original "Psycho), but that is what exactly happened to Julianne Moore and
Viggo Mortensen.  In Moore's case, the film would have been helped if "The X-
Files" Gillian Anderson had been cast instead; especially since Moore goes
through the entire film DOING a Scully impression!  From the cold demeanor and
expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence, Moore IS Scully!
     Mortensen (who I liked in "G.I. Jane") opts to play Sam Loomis as a
cowboy/hick, which would have been nice if he had gone PAST that starting
point.  Sam has a twang and a cowboy hat, but that's about it.  Mortensen
turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory.
     Anne Heche, in the Janet Leigh role, does a few good things in her brief
time on screen.  At least her Marion Crane has a LITTLE life in her, which
can't be said for most of the rest of the cast.
     The best work, though, comes from Vince Vaughn, as the demented Mama's
boy, Norman Bates.  He's not going to make anyone forget Anthony Perkins, but
he is effective both in being naughty and nice.  The best part of the film is
the dinner scene Heche and Vaughn, where they simply talk.  There is some
solid acting there, something that is not carried through the rest of the
film.
     Van Sant has made a BORING film.  All the camera tricks that Hitchcock so
eloquently used in 1960 aren't as eye-catching now.  What passed for
brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they
don't impress or excite.  Van Sant, in what I assume is a grasp at
originality, decided to put some stream-of-consciousness images into a few
famous scenes (was that a lamb in the middle of the road?)  These images,
included with some questionable editing choices, took away from the scenes
themselves and caused, at first, bewilderment and, later, laughter.
Definitely NOT Hitchcock's intention!
     At least Danny Elfman had the good sense to not mess with Bernard
Herrmann's original famous and terrific score.
     If a film like "Psycho" does not frighten, then what's the point.  Aside
from Norman, the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection
with the audience.  There are things Van Sant and Company could have done to
at least make their recreation interesting.  In the end, however, the new
"Psycho" is a noble attempt, but, alas, a dismal failure.

Review for Murder on the Orient Express (1974)
As my English Composition instructor commented recently, "Agatha Christie is
the coolest mystery writer ever." This is true with her books; however, in
many cases, film adaptions of her books have, in a word, sucked. An exception
is "Murder on the Orient Express," a luxurious, quick-paced throwback to a
different kind of time and place.
Made in 1974, "Orient Express" was directed by Sidney Lumet (known more for
gritty, urban pictures like "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Serpico.") In Lumet's
capable hands the film takes the viewer back to 1935 as the famed Orient
Express travels from Istanbul to Calais, France. Midway through the trip a
shady businessman, Ratchett (Richard Widmark), is murdered in his sleep.
Master Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney, in the best incarnation
of the character ever) is faced with the daunting task of discovering who is
the murderer(s).
Shot with an all-star cast, including Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Sir John
Geilgud, and Lauren Bacall, among others, this film makes for a very
entertaining time. All the actors do well in their roles, especially Bergman
(who won an Oscar for this role) and Bacall. Only Anthony Perkins is a sore
point--his character recalls too much of the personable side of Norman Bates
to be effective here.
Best of the performances is, naturally, Finney. He imbibes Poirot with a
fastidious, lively approach. At once bouncy and charismatic, Finney's Poirot
is not one-dimensional. The high-point of the film, and of Finney's portrayal,
is when Poirot announces his solution to the murder. Basically twenty minutes
of just Poirot talking, Finney delivers a tour-de-force performance at this
crucial juncture.
Paul Dehn's screenplay brims over with wit and sarcasm, with many good lines
going to Bacall and Finney. Richard Rodney Bennett's score is throwback to
another time as he uses strings and the piano to a thrilling effect. Tony
Walton's glorious period costumes and the set design of the train is almost,
quite simply put, amazing.
"Murder on the Orient Express" is a brilliantly shot film. Cinematographer
Geoffrey Unsworth shoots almost everything in a brightly lit frame, giving all
the actors a glowing aura about them. He also manages to pull off an
outstanding camera feat as the train first pulls out of the station in
Istanbul--combined with Bennett's score it must be seen and heard to be
believed.
There is just so much to recommend in this film. Everything seems to come off
without a hitch. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy "Murder on the Orient
Express." Movies just are not made like this anymore.
"Murder on the Orient Express" (1974).  Directed by Sidney Lumet.  Written by
Paul Dehn, from the novel by Agatha Christie.  Music by Richard Rodney
Bennett.  With Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery,
Anthony Perkins, Michael York, and many other big name stars.  Distributed by
Paramount.  Running time: 127 minutes.  Rated PG.  AVAILABLE ON HOME VIDEO.
Rating (out of a 4.0 cumulative average): 4.0

Title
Review for All That Jazz (1979)
You'd think that a musical with Roy Scheider as the lead would probably 
not be very good. You know, because when I think of singing and dancing 
I think of Roy Scheider.  In that aspect, Bob Fosse's 1979 film, "All 
That Jazz", is one of the best film musical films of the last thirty 
years and one of the best films of the late 70's. 
Scheider plays Joe Gideon, an overstressed stage/film director who is 
pushing himself toward an early grave.  He overworks himself, is 
constantly smoking, and does various other things detrimental to his 
health.  This character is clearly the celluloid Bob Fosse, an 
overstressed stage/film director.  This autobiographical film seems to 
infer that Fosse knows what he did right and wrong during his life.  He 
presents those episodes with Scheider as his surrogate persona.   
Gideon runs into trouble with his professional AND personal life.  He is 
seen many times laboring over the editing of a film based on a 
controversial stand-up comedian (re: "Lenny", Fosse's 1974 film, 
starring Dustin Hoffman.)  The edit is not going well and the studio is 
soon on his back.  Then there is the stage production Gideon is in 
charge of; we see a musical sequence he has created, titled "AirRotica". 
 Involving VERY permiscuous flight attendants, it soon angers the plays 
backers.  It is obvious that Gideon is in trouble. 
Fosse's directoral skills come to light during the dance sequence 
involving "AirRotica".  He combines his cinematic skills with his 
theater background to create an almost disturbing number.  The 
scantily-clad dancers in compromising positions combined with the 
lighting that Fosse chooses creates a decided air of decadence.  It is 
very easy to see why uptight producers and backers would get upset about 
it.  As theater its controversial, as film, however, this sequence it is 
brilliant. 
Gideon doesn't have a great family life either.  Obsessed in his work he 
is perhaps not the best father to his daughter, Michelle (Erzsebet 
Foldi).  He is not a bad father, it seems, because when he is with 
Michelle they get along great.  It simply seems that he is a father who 
may love his work more.  He is still on speaking terms with his ex-wife, 
Audrey (Leland Palmer), a Broadway star in her own right.  Thrown into 
the mix is Kate Jagger, (played by Ann Reinking, who may be playing her 
own alter-ego), a younger dancer that Joe is involved with.  One more 
woman is around, too, though not in a conventional way.  Angelique, an 
apparition played by Jessica Lange, is around to advise Joe on his 
problems and his future.  If Clarence from "It's a Wonderful Life" had a 
kid, Angelique may have been her. 
Much of the dancing involves the women of Joe's life.  All the female 
stars, with the exception of Lange, sing and dance with much style and 
grace.  Reinking and Palmer perform their acting roles teriffically as 
well, though it is in the musical segments they shine.   
Gideon has a major heart-attack near the end of the film and as he lies 
unconscious he has a dream.  He dreams of a television show, hosted by 
the gregarious O'Connor Flood (Ben Vereen), that celebrates his upcoming 
death: call it "This Is Your Death."  Many of the people Gideon has been 
involved with in his life are there and various musical numbers come 
about. 
 Fosse kicks the style into high-gear at this point.  Neon lights are 
abound on the stage, characters don different costumes, and, for a death 
march, it is quite upbeat.  Even Gideon/Scheider gets into the 
singing/dancing act near the end, echoing the sung refrain during this 
segment: "Goodbye my life, goodbye."  This masterful sequence combines 
all of Fosse's talents into one last shot of adrenaline and cinematic 
brilliance. 
Roy Scheider gives the performance of his career in "All That Jazz." 
 Since this film isn't a "conventional" musical (i.e. people don't 
randomly burst into song in this film, the musical sequences are logical 
and fit into the plot), Scheider doesn't have to sing or dance.  All he 
has to do is to act, and boy does he!  He captures all the pain the 
Gideon has inside of him as things happen to him.  Gideon is a 
passionate man, especially about his work.  Scheider shows us how Gideon 
cares deeply in all his work, the painstaking brilliance that goes into 
creating what he creates.   
Fosse was a great filmmaker.  "All That Jazz" is the zenith of his film 
work, a film that is entertaining and introspective.  Bob Fosse made a 
movie about himself, about things that he believes in.  The material is 
truthful about what is going on, as most of it happened to Fosse 
himself.  With his film, "All That Jazz", Fosse's execution was 
flawless. 
"All That Jazz" (1979).  Directed by Bob Fosse.  Written by Robert Alan 
Aurthur and Bob Fosse.  Cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno.  Original 
music by Ralph Burns.  Produced by Robert Alan Aurthur.  With Roy 
Scheider, Ann Reinking, Leland Palmer, Jessica Lange, Ben Vereen, 
Erzsebet Foldi.  Running time: 123 minutes.  Distributed by 20th Century 
Fox.  Rated: R.  Available on home video.

Title
Review for Spice World (1997)
Why do people hate the Spice Girls?  What exactly have they done wrong, 
other than perhaps offend the Fashion Police?  So what if they are not 
"great" singers---they ain't singing opera, folks, its pop music!  Who 
exactly IS a "great" singer? 
Judging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that I like the Spice 
Girls.  They do what they do--sing some catchy tunes--and they do it 
pretty well.  They are able to carry that into their first film, "Spice 
World".  "Spice World" certainly isn't a great filmgoing experience. . . 
what it is what the Spice Girls are all about: fun, songs, and a lot of 
"Girl Power!" 
Drawing from a number of different films (like the Beatles' "Hard Day's 
Night") "Spice World" chronicles the week heading up to the Girls' first 
concert at London's Albert Hall.  They get to tool around London in a 
big ol' bus (driven by Meat Loaf!) and generally have fun.  In order to 
through a semblence of plot into the film, there is an evil tabloid 
publisher played by Barry Humphries, better known to Americans, for 
about 15 minutes, as Dame Edna (remember her?)  He wants to sabotage the 
Girls' concert so he can sell papers. 
Of course, the point in a movie like "Spice World" isn't plot.  The 
center of the film is the Spice Girls themselves: Ginger (the recently 
departed Geri Haliwell), Posh (Victoria Adams), Sporty (Melanie 
Chisolm), Scary (Melanie Brown), and Baby (Emma Bunton).  Each one has 
their own personality and, perhaps the best part of the film, look like 
they are having some honest-to-goodness fun, something that can't be 
said for a lot of people in films today. 
Along for the ride are Richard E. Grant as their manager, Clifford, and 
various other characters making quick cameo appearances (including 
teriffic British actors like Richard Briers and Stephen Fry).  And, 
every once and a while, Roger Moore pops up as The Chief to spout odd 
koans (added bonus: he gets to, in the words of Craig Kilborn, dance, 
dance, dance.) 
Watching this film was fun, for the most part.  There are a few slow 
segments, but overly, director Bob Spiers keeps things moving at a quick 
pace, with plenty of hummable Spice Girls songs in the background.  His 
camerawork is fairly pedestrian, though the final concert number is done 
quite well with effective use of editing.   
The look of the film promotes the high fun, with the design of the 
SpiceBus being quite original and eye-catching.  Add in wall-to-wall 
Spice Girls music and this film is lovable romp.  If you don't like the 
Spice Girls, you won't change your mind with this film.  But, if you 
find them at least tolerable, get ready to sit back and chill because 
the Spice Girls are here to entertain you. . . and do it QUITE well.  
"Spice World" (1998).  Directed by Bob Spiers.  Written by Kim Fuller. 
 Music by the Spice Girls.  With Geri Halliwell, Victoria Adams, Melanie 
Chisolm, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Richard E. Grant, Claire Rushbrook, 
Roger Moore.  Distributed by Columbia Pictures.  Running time: 92 
minutes.  Rated: PG.  Available on Home Video.

Title
Review for Kids (1995)
     "Kids" portends to inform America what their kids are "really"
like.  To do this, screenwriter (?), Harmony Korine, and director
(double ?) Larry Clark, have created the dumbest characters since those
poor, dumb clods who didn't follow Gene Hackman up the Christmas tree in
"The Poseidon Adventure."  
     These characters include Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick), a would-be
lothario whose idea of safe-sex is to do only virgins.  As it turns out,
he is HIV positive and has infected Jennie (Chloe Sevigny, a truly
horrid actress).  The movie then takes two paths: it follows Telly and
his friend Casper (Justin Pierce) as they roam New York City, drinking,
doing drugs, drinking, beating up a guy in the park, and drinking.  It
also follows Jennie as she attempts to keep Telly from infecting anyone
else.
     Captivating stuff, isn't it?  I didn't think so either.  Perhaps
things could have been better if Clark and/or Korine had a clue about
film making.  Clark, a photographer who evidently enjoys taking pictures
of teens, shows the skill of Ed Wood in working a camera.  I would
assume, since "Kids" tries to have a documentary feel about it, that
Clark wanted the viewer to feel like he was with these punks.  Shame it
didn't work; he is unable to make the images on the screen create any
emotion other than anger: not anger at the characters, anger that he and
his writer, Korine, foisted this upon us.
     There is not one appealing character in this film, not even the
alleged protagonist, or, perhaps, conscience, Jennie.  Since much of the
film revolves around Jennie attempting to stop Telly from infecting
anyone else with HIV, Jennie's actions near the end of the film range on
the pathetic and pointless.  Chloe Sevigny (who almost single handedly
ruined "The Last Days of Disco") brings a glazed look to her role as
Jennie.  She carries no emotions whatsoever: not as she waits for the
results of her HIV test, not as she finds out she is HIV-positive, not
as she talks to her girlfriends about things like sex.  If an actress of
some skill or talent had taken the role, perhaps Jennie would not have
remained such a blank character.
     Telly is nothing but a one-dimensional idiot.  He shows no
remorse, nothing of any redeeming value, he is just a walking fuck
machine, always on the look out for another virgin.  Leo Fitzpatrick
does nothing with the part.  As his partner, Casper, Justin Pierce is
just as crude and unbelievable.  
     Harmony Korine's screenplay was, I guess, supposed to be a
shocking expose.  Shame it wasn't.  Oh, it is shocking, alright:
shocking in its ineptitude.  There is no real structure, no reason for
characters actions.  It seems Korine just threw in whatever shocking
events he could think of: rape, assault within an inch of a man's life,
thievery, breaking into a public pool (okay, breaking into a pool isn't
all that shocking, but still. . .)  Maybe Korine should have heeded this
lesson: shocks for sake of shocks generally don't work.
     It is well known that there are plenty of teenagers who think they
are God's gift and can do no wrong, but, in truth, are complete frickin'
idiots (my high school had a football team, so I can talk from
experience.) There is certainly a film to be made that explores today's
teenagers with frank honesty; perhaps that is the film "Kids" was trying
to be.  What comes out, however, is a pointless, meandering mess.  
     "Kids" shocked me.  It shocked me that a screenplay like Harmony
Korine's could get bought.  It shocked me that a studio would allow a
director to spend their money without even demonstrating an ounce of skill
or ability in film making.  It shocked me to consider that, outside of
Sharon Stone's body of work, there has rarely been such bad acting
captured on film.
     Perhaps dear Casper said it best with the film's concluding line:
"What happened?"  My thoughts exactly, my friend, my thoughts exactly. 
Rating: Not even worth a letter grade.

Title
Review for Alligator (1980)
Movies, for the most part, should be entertaining.  Sometimes it doesn't 
matter what the subject matter or how well made it is technically. 
 "Brain Donors" is comedy that makes me laugh hard everytime I see it, 
though I wouldn't put it on any top-ten list.  "Alligator" is film that 
should be seen and enjoyed; it is a none-too-gory horror film about a 
mutant alligator (see, Mom, was right: alligators do live in the 
sewers.) 
At the center of the story is David Madison (Robert Forster), a cop with 
a guilty conscience. When sewer workers start turning up in pieces in 
the Chicago sewer system, Madison is called in to investigate.  It soon 
becomes obvious that a huge-ass alligator is loose in the sewer.  With 
the help of a doctor named Marisa (Robin Riker), Madison tracks down the 
alligator (whose name turns out to be Ramon) and comes face to face with 
him a rather tension filled finale. 
The script, by John Sayles (!), is humorous and is above the grain for a 
horror film (but considering that Sayles wrote it, the quality is not 
all that surprising.)  Lewis Teague (who went to "Cujo) creates a number 
of interesting visuals, most effective in the final showdown as the 
sewer becomes enshrouded in haze and smoke.   
The odd thing about "Alligator" was that it was not very scary.  It 
creates tension, sure, but there aren't any jump-out-of-your-seat 
shocks.  The alligator itself is humorous in appearance; it is a big, 
lumbering, obviously fake thing that helps to ease fear.  To be honest, 
I don't think that is a bad thing; perhaps the lack of shocks or scares 
may upset other people looking for that, but I was more interested, and 
enjoyed more, the performances and the witty script. 
The cast is led by Robert Forster (known now for "Jackie Brown).  He 
brings a unshaven, rugged quality to the role of David the cop.  David 
is a lot like a usual film cop: his apartment is small, cluttered, with 
some art posters on the walls, he lives alone, has a cute little puppy 
to keep him company.  Forster fits the role very well and, the most 
important thing, he looks like he is having fun.  Essentially, I feel 
that "Alligator" is kind of a joke; Forster gives the impression that he 
is in on the joke and creates a likable screen presence.   
The others in the cast do a good job with the material, including Robin 
Riker as the doctor who, naturally, takes a liking to David.  Michael 
Gazzo is also on hand as The Chief, who is skeptical at first but 
eventually believes David. 
The only real distraction in the film is Colonel Brock, a big-game 
hunter, played by Henry Silva. Brock is a required character because his 
presence forces David to get fired and hunt the alligator on his own, 
which is what HAS to happen.  Silva is such a bad actor, however, that 
his character is an annoyance in his few scenes before he becomes gator 
food. 
If you're looking for a good time, go and pick up "Alligator" from the 
video store.  Some films are meant to be entertaining and enjoyed.  This 
was one of them; "Alligator" does not disappoint.  
"Alligator" (1980).  Written by John Sayles.  Directed by Lewis Teague. 
 With Robert Forster, Robin Riker, Michael Gazzo, Dean Jagger, and Henry 
Silva.  Running time: 94 minutes.  Available on home video.  Rated: R.

Title
Review for There's Something About Mary (1998)
Movies are made to be fun. . .remember that.  Some movies try to be fun and
still stink (which seems to be the case with "Armageddon", but since I haven't
seen it I won't judge.)  "There's Something About Mary" is the, simply put,
the most fun and funniest movie you are going to see this summer (and,
perhaps, all year.)
A lot has been made about "Mary's" political incorrectness, about its
treatment of retarded people, about its use of bodily fluids.  Does "Mary" go
over the line with some its humor. . . maybe, but, pardon my language, who
gives a shit?  Nothing is sacred to Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the people who
directed (and wrote with Ed Decter and John J. Strauss), and that is one of
the most refreshing things about it.
We see the beginnings of romance in Rhode Island circa 1985 as Ted (Ben
Stiller) lusts after mar (Cameron Diaz).  A tragic (for Ted, at least) prom
night accident ruins things and he spends the next 13 years wondering what
happened to her. Enter Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), a seedy (and I mean SEEDY)
private investigator hired to track Mary down.  When he finds her in Miami he
decides to make HIS move on Mary and Ted is soon in hot in pursuit of both of
them.
All three leads shine.  Diaz isn't just a pretty face, she really shows some
comedic ability.  A lot of comedy comes from Mary's reactions to the people
around her and Diaz is able to make it funny (like the look on her face when
Pat tells her, the sister of a mentally handicapped person, that he likes
"working with retards.")  Dillon, last seen getting in on in "Wild Things", is
surprisingly funny.  I had never been that impressed with his acting before,
but in this setting he was really quite good.  He captured the right amount of
sliminess and buffoonery in his role.  These may seem like simplistic
observations, but, in comedy especially, if an actor doesn't capture the right
mood, things will most definitely NOT be funny, no matter the material (and
vice versa.)  
The best of the lot, though, is Stiller.  His Ted, hurt (in more way than one)
for so many years, is a sad character (there were more than a few "Aws",
including from me, when he got a sad, puppydog look on his face.)  Very rarely
in a comedy, especially one with humor like "Mary"'s, is a character liable to
draw much sympathy.  Because Stiller is one the best all-around comedy talents
in Hollywood, he is able to pull off that unlikely feat.  Credit must also go
to the writers for giving Stiller enough stuff to create someone like Ted.
The Farrelly Brothers obviously know how to direct comedy.  The problem is,
the parts that don't have a lot comedy (there is a LOT of exposition)
sometimes drag. 
For a comedy of this kind, "Mary" is long at 119 minutes, though this is not a
bad thing (except for said slow parts.)  Of the comedic set pieces that are in
this I would not be able to do without any.  In fact, some of these instances,
one in particular, will be talked about for years (including one I'll bet you
don't see coming.)
I hadn't laughed REALLY hard at a movie in quite a while (to be honest, I
can't remember the last belly laugh I had inside a theater).  "Mary" is full
of laughs, of the belly kind and others.  I don't care how hardened you are,
you WILL laugh.  And when was the last time you were guaranteed that?  
Rating (based on a 4.0 cumulative average): 3.75
"There's Something About Mary" (1998).  Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter
Farrelly. Written by Ed Decter and John J. Strauss and Peter Farrelly and
Bobby Farrelly.  Music by Jonathan Richman.  With Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon,
Ben Stiller, Lee Evans, Chris Elliot, Harland Williams.  Distributed by 20th
Century Fox.  Running time: 119 minutes.  Rated R.
