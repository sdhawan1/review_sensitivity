Title
Review for Linguini Incident, The (1991)
     The studios apparently did not choose to distribute THE LINGUINI
INCIDENT here in flyoverland, so I had the pleasure of seeing it on
video last week, some time after its quiet demise in the theaters.
     The film starts out as a standard debonair-non-American-must-
marry-PDQ-in-order-to-get-green-card flick, and then segues into other
equally fatigued ideas.  David Bowie looks like he would rather be
singing "We are the goon squad and we're coming to town (beep beep)."
Rosanna Arquette does not really succeed in inhabiting her character,
which may be to her credit.  Eszter Balint, my reason for seeing this
movie, does indeed manage to make her character credible and engaging;
her character also has the most nearly original comic conceit; and she
is not particularly well integrated into the main plot.  For this reason
one gets the feeling she's in the wrong film.  Perhaps we'll get to see
THE RETURN OF THE SELF-DEFENSE BRA someday.
     Gratuitous swipes at feminists, although the cranberry juice was
pretty funny.
     Notice to directors and cinematographers: showing us a brightly-
lit bridge is not enough to convince us that a movie is set in New
York.
     On a scale of -4 to +4, I'd say -3.  On the monetary scale, I'd say
that you should definitely rent the video if (a) you think, as I do,
that Eszter Balint is totally righteous, or (b) the video store will
also wax your car.
