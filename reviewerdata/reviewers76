Review for Man in the Iron Mask, The (1998)
Director: Randall Wallace movie
Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne, Gérard
Depardieu, John Malkovich, Anne Parillaud, Judith Godrčche and others
Most of us are familiar with the story of the Three Musketeers, or
rather four. The story of the Man In The Iron Mask, also written by
Alexandre Dumas, takes place 25 years later - our musketeers got
older and each of them is in a different business now. King of France
is no longer Louis XIII but Louis XIV, the man who built Versailles.
But in our story Louis is a spoiled brat, an arrogant adolescent who
only cares about his own pleasure while the people are starving in
the streets of Paris.
D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), Athos (John Malkovich), Porthos (Gérard
Depardieu) and Aramis (Jeremy Irons) all have their own good reasons
to want to get rid of the king. A carefully guarded secret works to
their advantage: Louis XIV has a twin brother who was taken away
right after he was born so as not to endanger the succession. He does
not know about his true identity and has been kept in a dungeon for
the last six years. An iron mask covers his face so no-one will
notice how much he looks like the king. The four musketeers conspire
to exchange Philippe for Louis to free the people of France from
their despotic monarch.
Even if THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK has nothing new to offer this remake
is worth watching, especially because of its top notch cast. The
"elderly gentlemen" seemed to have fun as musketeers. The women's job
in this movie is to look pretty, but that's just the nature of the
story.
Leonardo DiCaprio may be a surprising but nevertheless good choice
for the part of Louis XIV. He masters two very different parts. His
arrogant Louis reminds me of Jaye Davidson as Ra in Roland Emmerich's
STARGATE, but maybe that was just the similar hairdo.
One thing's for sure: There can only be one. It's either Louis or
Philippe, one of them must disappear.
The strangest character in the movie is Gérard Depardieu as Porthos,
although if you know the book you can hardly think of a better actor
for the part. The aging Porthos lost his peace of mind, thinks about
suicide and gets on his friends' nerves. They don't take him
seriously, but still they make a saw-cut in a beam in the barn to
prevent him from killing himself. Why Porthos has to be naked when he
tries to hang himself remains a mystery. Maybe because Depardieu
likes to drop his clothes. That doesn't mean that we all would like
to see him that way. After seeing him climb out of a bathtub in
GERMINAL I decided that I like cave bears better at the museum, but
once more I was given this very special treat. So what.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK isn't very original, but makes for two hours
of pleasant entertainment if you enjoy pretty costumes and don't
expect too much.

Title
Review for Addicted to Love (1997)
Director: Griffin Dunne
Cast: Meg Ryan, Matthew Broderick, Kelly Preston, Tchéky Karyo
Sam (Matthew Broderick) is an astronomer in a small American town and
engaged to teacher Linda (Kelly Preston). He is head over heels in
love and Lindas sudden departure to New York City to live with her new
lover Anton (Tchéky Karyo) comes as a complete surprise to him. 
But as we all know love is blind and so Sam leaves for New York as
well to win her back. He moves into an abandoned house across the
street from Anton's apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch
them. Suddenly Anton's ex Maggie shows up, but she does not want her
former lover back. On the contrary, all she wants to do is vaporize
him. She may say that she doesn't want to kill him, but the
possibility doesn't bother her too much either. After all, people die
every day.  
In spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each
other as things move on. The story sounds like something we all have
seen a million times. But we haven't. Griffin Dunne brings us the most
charming comedy since "While you where sleeping". The camera obscura
adds a "special something" to the movie and makes it an exceptional
romantic comedy. 
Everything about the movie is perfect, from set design to casting. The
dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain
bite. 
Meg Ryan, known from "When Harry met Sally" or "Sleepless in Seattle",
surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet
little girl image. She impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl.
Even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her, much
more so than in last years "Courage under Fire" where she played a
Gulf war pilot. 
Matthew Broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive Sam who has
trouble accepting reality. The viewer can tell that he doesn't only
watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them. He has trouble
keeping in touch with reality. After all, who would leave everything
behind to chase a lost love? His naiveté that we don't question for a
minute throughout the movie clashes with Maggies exaggerated wish for
revenge. She would do anything to harm Anton. She doesn't hesitate to
use Sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning
that nothing will happen between the two of them. That makes the
scenes when they innocently share a bed, have potatoe chips and watch
the action across the street like a saturday night show on TV even
funnier. 
Tchéky Karyo is perfect as Anton. He is, well, repulsive. That's all
there is to say about him. You can't really manage to pity him, even
after all his mishaps. He not only took Sam's bride away from him, he
is also a French chef. Worlds collide, i. e. the USA and France. This
can only go wrong. Even if Maggies revenge schemes are at times
shocking, you just can't sympathize with a man who plays "Je
t'aime...moi non plus" on his tape deck. Not everyone is captured by
the French charme that Linda and even Maggie fell for. Sam certainly
isn't. Too bad for Anton. For him things take a turn to the worse.
"Addicted to Love" is one of this year's most pleasant surprises.

Title
Review for Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)
Director: George Armitage
Cast: John Cusack, Minnie Driver, Dan Ackroyd and others
The nice but somewhat strange Martin Blank (John Cusack) has  an
uncommon profession. His nice clean office with secretary soon turns
out to be a flourishing killer agency. But although the hitman
business is going well Martin has problems. They are of a more
personal nature and he regularly stretches out on a therapist's couch
to solve them. The therapy comes to an abrupt end when he finds out
that all his therapist's book that he admired so much where written by
a ghost writer. Nevertheless he lets this psychoterrorist who has
severe problems himself talk him into attending his high school
reunion at Grosse Pointe, Michigan. By doing this he combines business
and pleasure for his next contract is taking him there anyway.
Moreover a visit to his hometown gives him the opportunity to meet his
high school sweetheart Debi (Minnie Driver) whom he left without
saying good-bye ten years ago. Unfortunately things don't go according
to plan because there's a hitman going after Martin as well. The
sleepy little town is in for one hell of a ride.
John Cusack who wasn't able to show his talent in this year's
blockbuster 'Con Air' can do so now. He is very convincing as the
troubled killer who justifies his deeds by pointing out that he never
kills innocent people. His methods are just as extravagant as his
personality. It doesn't always have to be a gun, does it? The
president of Paraguay e. g. was killed with a fork. You have to be
creative in a job that doesn't require a college degree, much less a
Ph. D. 
Tom Jankewicz seasoned the script with a healthy dose of black humor
to prevent it from being just another big gunfight and thus defuses
the more brutal scenes. He doesn't quite reach the skillfullness of
the Coen brothers but the dialogues and the funny situations stop the
viewers from thinking about the fact that many people are killed in
this movie. E. g. in the scene when Martin has to kill one of the
hitmen that try to kill him in a corridor of his old high school
during the reunion dance. With the help of a friend he wraps the body
in a piece of decoration and burns it in the school's furnace. The
attentive viewer asks him- or herself where the big bloodstain in the
corridor has gone and why there are no other bloody marks. The Coens
wouldn't have let this happen.
On the down side are - once again - the female parts. They remain
one-dimensional as usual. Here they are secretaries (Joan Cusack) or
ex-sweethearts (Minnie Driver). Especially Debi's part could have been
better. Debi who is a DJ with her own call-in radio show doesn't
hesitate to embarass her former lover in public asking her audience
whether she should give him a second chance after ten years. Martin
watches this in horror and can't believe the punishments the callers
suggest. Unfortunately that's Minnie Driver's only good scene.
A big plus is Dan Ackroyd as professional killer Grocer whose job it
is to kill Martin. Their exchanges are a joy to watch for every lover
of bizarre humor.
GROSSE POINTe BLANK  has too many loose ends and boring parts to be a
masterpiece, but it makes a nice change to watch it in between
blockbusters. Sense of (very) black humor required.

Title
Review for Face/Off (1997)
Director: John Woo
Cast: John Travolta, Nicholas Cage, Gina Gershon, Joan Allen
To get straight to the point: Face/Off is based on a brillant idea for
an intelligent action movie, but unfortunately turns out to be a third
rate Hollywood flick. The beginning seems promising enough: two men
who are as different as can be exchange their lives. One does so
willingly, the other has no choice.
John Travolta is FBI agent Sean Archer whose son is killed by a bullet
meant for him. Archer is a bundle of virtues: a good husband, loving
father and loyal law enforcement officer. Whereas Travolta played a
not-so-holy angel in MICHAEL in this movie he is the guardian of law,
order and justice. Until he finds himself stuck with the face of
gangster Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) and suddenly has to play the
opposite part. He does that quite well. Another plus for Travolta: he
doesn't dance.
Nicolas Cage is gangster Castor Troy who falls into a coma after being
shot and wakes up to realize that his face is gone. So of course he
takes the doctors hostage and forces them to give him Archer's face.
To destroy the evidence of what he has done Troy burns down the clinic
so nobody knows about Archer's true identity anymore. The change of
identity is perfect. From now on Cage 'is' Travolta and Travolta 'is'
Cage.
Unfortunately this is also the point when the script becomes
increasingly obscure. The writers seemed to think that an audience who
buys the face transplant will believe virtually anything. Maybe it
would have been more believable if the protagonists had been more
physically alike. But the fact that a wife has to do a blood test to
verify her husband's identity is a bit too much. She might have
noticed that her husband has gone from model citizen to despicable
creep. This seems even stranger considering that Travolta isn't quite
as good as Cage when it comes to acting like the other one. But these
are only minor deficiencies of the script. 
What weighs more heavily is the fact that the last half hour of the
movie consists only of action movie cliches. There are wild
shoot-outs, but the climax is a speed boat chase that - finally -
brings on the obligatory explosions. They show us three in a row, each
one more impressive than the one before. After all the pyrotechnists
have to work for their money . Unfortunately John Woo had no more
original idea for a finale, when we already had begun to doubt a boat
this size would explode so easily while watching SPEED 2. But this
ending wouldn't have been too bad, if they had just removed the dead
and wounded and been done with that. 
Well, things can always get worse. The movie ends with a big family
reunion that seems to be a new Hollywood trend in action movies.
FACE/OFF meets CON AIR. Too bad, Mr. Woo. That didn't work.

Title
Review for Mercury Rising (1998)
9 year old autistic Simon (Miko Hughes) loves to solve all kinds of
riddles. But who would suppose that his hobby can put him into mortal
danger. One day, however, his caretaker gives him a riddle magazine
that has one very special riddle - the solution of which is a top
secret telephone number.
The American secret service has developed a new encryption code for
correspondence with their foreign contacts. The code is supposedly
unbreakable for computers, not to mention for the human brain. The
programmers came up with the ultimate test for the code: they hid an
encoded phone number in one of the riddles in a magazine. When the
phone actually rings and a kid is on the other end a torrent of events
is kicked loose that they can no longer control.
Lt. Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin) immediately gives the order to
silence the kid and his parents once and for all. But Simon manages to
escape the killers. FBI agent Art Jeffries (Bruce Willis) is put in
charge of the case, and a frantic run for the boy's life begins.
Even if this time only one little boy's life is at stake and not the
fate of the Earth as in THE FIFTH ELEMENT or ARMAGEDDON Bruce Willis
is more convincing in his unusual part as involuntary nanny. The
scenes with him and little Simon - very well portrayed by Miko Hughes
- raise this movie slightly above the average. Art Jeffreys differs
from John McClane of DIE HARD fame not only in that he doesn't sport a
bloodstained undershirt, he also is not so excessivly tough and
resorts to pills to calm his strained nerves. The man of steel seems
to have some dents, or what else is to be made of that? He survives a
fall out of a flying helicopter, though. So don't you worry, he's
still invulnerable.
Jeffrey's adversary Kudrow is a very different type. Alec Baldwin is a
good choice for the part. He's the kind of guy who never gets his own
hands dirty and always has his men for the ugly jobs. Not a very
likable guy. You can't help wishing for him to end up a grease spot.
Considering that kids are never seriously harmed in Hollywood flicks
and Bruce Willis always comes out on top you know full well who is
going to be alive when the end credits are start rolling. Minor
characters serve only to add some blood and noise to the action
scenes. As far as suspense is concerned MERCURY RISING is no better
than other movies of the kind.
The one riddle of the movie is Peter Stormare's short appearance, but
you won't need a Cray computer to solve it. I can offer the following
explanations: 1. It was a lifelong dream of his to fight on camera
with Bruce Willis. 2. He had some very urgent bills to pay. 3. After
everybody saw him in Spielberg's THE LOST WORLD he no longer believes
that doing an action movie is bad for his image. His talent was
completely wasted on MERCURY RISING, but the more famous names on the
poster the more people will want to see the movie.
Miko Hughes turns in a great performance as the autistic boy. Apart
from Bruce Willis, who simply does what he always does, Hughes is the
real star of the movie and makes the viewers stick out till the very
predictable ending.
No surprising plot twists or brilliant ideas, but easier to digest
than ARMAGEDDON, where the Last Judgement turned out to be just a
harmless shower of meteorites with a pompous prelude.

Title
Review for Waterworld (1995)
Director: Kevin Reynolds
Cast: Kevin Costner, Dennis Hopper, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Tina Majorino
and others
In WATERWORLD the darkest prophecies have come true: a radical change
of climate melted the pole caps, the world is flooded with water and
the few survivors live on makeshift water vessels. But if you thought
that would make people stick together you're wrong. Even in those hard
times some bad guys, the Smokers, only seek to draw profit from other
people's misery. They, too, have heard the legend of Dryland.
Supposedly there is one last place on Earth not covered with water,
but nobody knows where. To find Dryland they need a map that is
tattooed on the back of Enola (Tina Majorino), a little girl. The
Smokers try to get their hands on her, but they have to get past her
protector first: the Mariner (Kevin Costner), a mutated half amphibian
man.
There are disaster movies and movies that are a disaster. WATERWORLD
belongs to the latter category. When the movie hit the theaters this
was amply discussed. Surprisingly it was a box office hit in Europe.
Maybe over here more people want to see for themselves whether a movie
is really as bad as the critics say it is.
Considering the set and the costume you have to wonder why this movie 
was almost as expensive in the making as James Cameron's TITANIC. At
least TITANIC gives you an idea of where all the money has gone. The
set of WATERWORLD looks like the designers got it from scrap yards all
over the US, so what was so expensive? The costumes? Hardly, unless
the torn rags were designed by some highly paid couturier. Who knows.
Most of the set was blown up at the end of the movie. Who cares about
the resulting damages to the environment. 
There isn't much to be said about the acting. It's like watching a
group of amateur actors performing a play they wrote themselves. Not
even Dennis Hopper turns in a convincing performance. Had this been
the admission test for an acting school the candidate would have
flunked.
The same is true for Kevin Costner as the Mariner. Didn't it cross
his mind that he has outgrown the part of "youthful hero"? I guess
not. Otherwise he wouldn't have set out to ridicule himself with the
world watching. Lack of hair isn't very well concealed by just
letting the remaining hair grow longer, and having it pasted to your
head because it's wet all the time doesn't help either. At least we
get to admire the Mariner's gills. It is never mentioned exactly  how
long Earth has been covered with water, but a few centuries are not
long enough for such a mutation to occur. The term "ichthyosapiens"
is one of the few laughs the movie produces. Is that good or bad?
The less said about the two major female characters the better. They
only serve one purpose: eye-candy. Of course Helen (Jeanne
Tripplehorn) immediately offers to fish and cook for the Mariner if
he takes them with him and her foster daughter Enola will do the
same. The disastrous change of climate at least had the positive side
effect of ending women's lib for good. It's back to the idyllic days
of stone age. According to latest research that idyll wasn't what it
was cracked up to be, but that isn't very likely to influence the way
women are depicted in movies made in Tinseltown. The function of
women in movies very often is just to look good and serve the hero in
every way possible.
Logic isn't even tried in WATERWORLD. Even if all glaciers and the
pole caps were to melt not all the continents would be covered with
water. There just isn't enough water on Earth. It's preposterous to
assume that only a few small islands remain that can't be found for
centuries. But in spite of the fact that the Earth became a water
desert one tomatoe plant survived (for centuries, again ??). And were
did the chain smokers grow their tobacco? Probably from a swimming
factory with some replicators borrowed from Star Trek. Not to mention
the refinery needed to produce fuel for the Smoker's various rides.
There is more to discover on a closer look, but it's not worth the
trouble.
One of the biggest wastes of money in the history of movie making.
All existing copies should be burned in a big bonfire on Walpurgis
Night so the witches can have a decent dance. But that would hurt the
environment again.

Title
Review for Westworld (1973)
Clever marketing strategists created a very special theme park: At
Westworld the stressed-out vacationer can relax in an unusual way and
experience things he will never forget for the rest of his life. Who
hasn't dreamt of being a sheriff in the Wild West, see the pleasures
of ancient Rome or win the love of a medieval queen by defeating the
Black Knight? Westworld gives you the opportunity to live your dreams
at a time when time travel still belongs in the realm of science
fiction. The tourists are cared for by hi-tech robots that look
incredibly human. But as you know the best technology is only good as
long as it works. If the circuits blow due to a technical defect the
most human robot is just a machine...
Those somewhat familiar with the works of Michael Crichton can
probably guess what this movie is about. My first thought was: the
man's relation with theme parks is a bit strange. Even if Westworld
isn't plagued by rambling dinosaurs like JURASSIC PARK some 20 years
later, this early version of a story warning about the menace of
exaggerated use of technology is everything but colorless. On the
contrary: The fact that this story deals with human looking robots
that can't be told from real people makes everything more ghastly.
Imagine being chased by a gunslinger - played brilliantly by Yul
Brynner - whose only aim is to kill you because his circuits were
messed up by a major blackout in the conrol center. You can't kill him
like a normal man and he acts with the precision of a machine, cold
and unfeeling. The pleasure seekers in the ancient Rome and in the
medieval castle are no better off. There, too, the robots were
affected by the blackout and the Black Knight doesn't want to give up
his victory. The vacation turns into a nightmare, brilliantly and
eerily staged.
Many blame Crichton for being anti-technology, which I never quite
understood. His books and movies rather make you think about the
dangers of a naive faith in the infallibility of technology. And that
is an impulse that can't hurt in these times. His vivid imagination
and not exactly squeamish use of violence serve to entertain the
viewer or reader, which all in all is the purpose of a thriller.
A gloomy vision of an artificial world that hopefully never will come
true.

Title
Review for Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)
Director: Steven Spielberg
Cast: Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Peter Stormare,
Pete Postlethwaite
"Something has survived" we are advised by the movie poster. Ian
Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who remembers his terrible experience at
Jurassic Park four years ago only too well, is horrified when he finds
out. The dinosaurs should have died of lack of lysine according to
their genetic makeup, but they didn't only survive on Isla Sorna but
formed a new closed eco system. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough),
has turned from evil capitalist to reformed environmentalist and wants
to send a team on the island to watch the dinosaurs in their natural
environment.
He hopes for Malcolm to be the fourth man on the team and is surprised
to find him less than enthusiastic about the whole idea. Malcolm has
lost his job after spreading stories about dinosaurs in public and
really doesn't have much of an alternative. But he only changes his
mind when he finds out that the team's paleontologist is his girl
friend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) and that she is already on the
island on her own. Now he rushes the other participants, camera man
Nick Van Owen and technical specialist Eddie Carr, to leave
immediately.
After their arrival on Isla Sorna they first find Sarah's torn back
pack and then herself, happy as pie and just about to watch a group of
stegosaurs with their young. On returning to their trailers they find
Malcolm's teenage daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) who came along
without her father's knowledge. Malcolm wants his girl friend and
daughter off the island immediately but can't handle the radio
equipment and Sarah's resistance. 
In the meantime a second team led by Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow
(Arliss Howard) lands on the island. They are not here to take
pictures, though. They want to catch dinosaurs for their theme park in
San Diego. Ludlow hired big game hunter Roland Tembo and his team,
among them hunter and loudmouth Dieter Stark (Peter Stormare) and
paleontologist Robert Burke (Thomas F. Duffy). In spite of their
contrary interests both teams end up depending on each other in their
fight for survival. The second team is successful: they manage to load
a T. rex on their ship and take him to San Diego for the showdown.
When JURASSIC PARK hit the movie theaters five years ago it seemed
hard to believe that those special effects could be topped. Nothing is
as short-lived as the computer industry and you can tell right away
that enormous progress has been made. The dinosaurs in THE LOST WORLD
are unbelievably real. Of course some anatomic details are off just as
in JURASSIC PARK, but who cares about details when a herd of
stegosaurs tramples over the screen as if this could happen any day or
when some angry pachycephalosaurs work out by ramming the intruders'
cars. Incredible. The animatronic models are just as good as the
computer generated dinos.
The dinosaurs are the stars of the movie and easily push their human
counterparts aside, even if THE LOST WORLD boasts a number of fine
actors.
Jeff Goldblum reprises his role of chaotic chaotician Ian Malcolm, who
didn't have much to do in JURASSIC PARK except for warning everybody
about the consequences of genetic engineering and wasn't too nice a
guy there either. Including him in the movie again was a good choice,
and he can handle his lead. Bizarre parts seem to be just up his
alley. This time he gets to be the hero instead of breaking his bones
five minutes into the movie. His cool speeches are plenty and provide
the neccessary humor. He also shows that the movie isn't taking itself
too seriously. 
No such luck for Julianne Moore. She and Vanessa Lee Chester are the
token women of the movie. The script sees her in one function only:
the woman that can be rescued by the guys whenever the need arises.
Although she supposedly is a paleontologist and behaviorist she
introduces herself by patting a baby stegosaur - the dumbest scene in
the movie by far. The second dumbest thing she does is hanging her
jacket with baby T. rex blood in her tent to dry off. She might as
well put up a sign "Dinner's ready, come and get it!" But her method
is more effective, since dinosaurs can't read.
As far as the part of Sarah Harding is concerned the auther should
have stuck to Michael Crichton's book a lot more. But the scenario
"Sarah saves Ian" can't be accepted by Hollywood as yet. So she has to
depend on her luck which luckily never leaves her even as in the end
she crosses paths with some velociraptors who prefer to fight among
themselves instead of going for the easier prey.
Richard Schiff, Vince Vaughn and Vanessa Lee Chester are the rest of
the "good guys". Obviously a Spielberg movie can't do without kids and
so Malcolm is stuck with a daughter left to him by one of his
ex-wifes. Kelly is there to save her father from a velociraptor in
one of the not so well done action scenes. Vince Vaughn saves an
injured T. rex baby with Sarah. That wasn't so good an idea after all,
because the frightening reptiles turn out to be good parents and don't
like this at all. They provide for one of the most gripping scenes in
the movie when they push the trailer over a cliff although their young
has been given back to them. This is Richard Schiff's big moment. He
tries to pull the trailers back or at least save the people inside.
Unfortunately mommy and daddy are still very angry and he finds a
tragic end.
The outstanding bad guys are Pete Postlethwaite and Peter Stormare.
Postlethwaite is big game hunter Roland Tembo whose grand desire it is
to add a male T. rex to his hunting trophies. Anybody can have a
deer's, elk's or lion's head hanging on his wall, but a T. rex... He
supposedly never heard of sexual dimorphism of tyrannosaurs or else
he'd have prefered a female whose head would have been bigger. Well,
he gets neither but is one of the more interesting characters. Peter
Stormare as Dieter Stark lives up to his sadist image from FARGO. He
tortures a procompsognathus with an electric stick after making sure
with Robert Burke that this species is harmless. Boy was he wrong.
Animal rights activists will be glad to see that punishment isn't far
away.
Robert Burke is one of the movie's best in-jokes. Unfortunately not
too many Europeans are likely to notice. Paleontologists are public
figures in the USA. For example the enfant terrible paleontologist
Robert Bakker who upsets the experts with his revolutionary theories.
All those who are familiar with Bakker's appearance will notice the
incredible likeness with LOST WORLD scientist Rober Burke. Hat,
glasses, beard, down to the tips of his shoes. That of course is
intended. Actor Thomas F. Duffy allegedly spent a day with Bakker at
excavations to study him. He brings the scientific touch to the movie
by calling the dinosaurs by their correct names and explaining when
and where they were discovered. Those who don't agree with Bakker's
theories may enjoy the fact that his movie alter ego falls victim to a
lively T. rex - as Bakker defends the theory that dinosaurs were
active, warm blooded animals.
THE LOST WORLD provides 129 minutes of exitement. One action scene
chases the other, leaving the story behind at times, but you don't
expect a drama full of dialogue when you go to see this movie. It is
very funny until the end. Especially the dinosaur chase in San Diego
is full of funny little details. You only have to look for them. E. g.
japanese tourists running from the T. rex who resembles Godzilla or
the cameo by David Koepp, the author of the script. He suffers the
same fate as Robert Burke. Feeding time for dinosaurs.

Title
Review for Batman (1989)
Director: Tim Burton
Cast: Michael Keaton, Kim Basinger, Jack Nicholson
Tim Burton, the man who recently brought us the bizarre and shrill
'Mars Attacks!' directed 'Batman' in 1988. I've been avoiding movies
like that for years. Let's see if I was right. 
The running time is 118 minutes. It took me one of those almost two
hours to find out what was going on. Half the movie. Unbelievable, the
fans will say. In this first hour the viewers are introduced to Gotham
City and the people who live there. In one of the first scenes we meet
Batman (Michael Keaton), who scares away two dark figures in a dark
night. So, he's one of the good guys, I understand. Two other
characters we meet are Jack (Jack Nicholson) and the press
photographer Vicki (Kim Basinger). Then there's Bruce Wayne, a
mysterious single gentleman who falls in love with Vicki. Or vice
versa, I'm not quite sure. After another long while I understood that
he is Batman. I wish they'd told the uninitiated viewer a little
sooner. And Tim Burton worked so hard on his introduction. 
The story is simple: Jack turns out to be the evil Joker who wants to
poison the whole city to take over control. Batman tries to stop him.
He has an old bone to pick with Jack, who many years ago shot his
parents while he was watching. 
Jack is easily spotted as the villain. A guy who looks like this can't
be up to anything good. Jack Nicholson certainly was a good choice for
the part. He has the potential to play a real psychopath. He didn't
need much make-up: just some white and red color and stuffed out
cheeks and you have a joker. Once more I thought that this is the
ideal kind of part for Nicholson. As long as he can be mean he is
great. But even the best villain in the end has to succumb to the good
guys. 
Michael Keaton is Batman. The honor of saving Gotham City dressed in a
black rubber suit is his. Allegedly there are some women who saw the
movie for this reason alone. I was surprised to find that he was seen
more often as Bruce Wayne without the suit. His acting was more
convincing in those scenes than the bat-scenes. To me the rubber suit
is as sexy as a hose. 
I can't say much about Kim Basinger as Vicki either. She is introduced
as a press photographer who neglects personal danger to obtain a good
story. And that's all. Her character remains flat and one-dimensional.
Batman (of course) gets to save her from evil joker. Why is it that
women in Hollywood movies always have to be saved? 
All in all the movie looked less "comic-like" than I had feared. The
set design was gloomy rather than shrill and colorful. However I had
hoped for a more bizarre movie. At least that was what I expected a
Tim Burton movie to be after seeing 'Mars Attacks!'. But 'Mars
Attacks!' isn't supposed to be a typical Burton movie. I heard that
his real fans don't like it. Danny Elfman's musical score wasn't too
good this time either. I think I'll leave 'Batman' to the real fans
and watch 'Mars Attacks!' again.

Title
Review for Armageddon (1998)
Director: Michael Bay
Cast: Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Peter
Stormare and others
The end of the world - many times invoked (in vain) by Jehova's
Witnesses - now finally seems to loom over mankind. A giant asteroid
races towards Earth and threatens to put an end to all life. NASA
hopes to destroy it by drilling a hole in its surface and explode an
atomic bomb in it. For this job they hire Harry Stamper (Bruce
Willis), a drilling expert with an international reputation, to take
his team to the asteroid and solve the problem once and for all. Time
is running out because the approaching object was discovered late
only when all of a sudden showers of meteorites rained down on the
USA and caused considerable damage. The newly asigned astronauts
can't waste much time on training, they just have to pass a physical.
And the race against time commences.
CHAOS IN SPACE would have been a good name for the movie, but
ARMAGEDDON of course sounds more dramatic. After DEEP IMPACT this is
the second movie this year dealing with the subject of celestial
bodies colliding with our planet. But compared to DEEP IMPACT this
movie's motto is: Think Big. The asteroid about to hit Mother Earth
is the size of Texas. The asteroid that ended the Cretaceous period
65 million years ago and left a 200 km wide crater is thought to have
been 10 to 20 km in diameter. An object the size of Texas is likely
to make a much bigger hole. Our solar system hasn't suffered
collisions of this kind since it emerged in this remote corner of the
galaxy.
But let's suspend disbelieve on this issue. It's a very dramatic idea
that would have made a thrilling movie loaded with special effects.
The special effects are quite stunning, and the audience doesn't have
to wait till the last minute. New York is knocked flat and a few
other sights outside the USA are doomed as well, for balance's sake.
The movie starts with a bang. It's believable that the asteroid is
discovered only when it's already quite near Earth. Near collisions
with asteroids have happened in recent years as everybody can verify
with NASA. 
Harder to believe is the fact that a bunch of civilians is shot into
space to save the Earth. It's like watching a bunch of small boys
play astronauts in a real life setting. A bunch of boys who watched
STAR WARS too many times. Or perhaps they were never allowed to play
out their fantasies with action dolls. Sorry, but I guess to really
enjoy those scenes you simply need a Y-chromosome.
Bruce Willis is in his element for the first time since the DIE HARD
series. And he doesn't have to deal with mere trifles like
skyscrapers, airports or major cities. He can be a true heroe and
save the Earth. His adversary is just a dead rock instead of a group
of vicious terrorists, but who cares. The asteroid gives him at least
as much trouble as all the terrorists in the DIE HARD movies. Just
one question: what's next? Saving the solar system or the whole
galaxy? It doesn't get much bigger than that, but then he may soon be
too old for the tough hero part anyway. So let's not begrudge him the
triumph over the forces of nature. He uses his opportunity to be
mucho macho. His daughter doesn't have much to say, but with a father
like that she probably should be content to sit adoringly at his feet
and do whatever he bids.
The rest of the team remains liveless. Some of them are living
targets anyway. Killing off a few less important heroes adds to the
suspense. Steve Buscemi can't save the day. The only bright spot in
the movie is Peter Stormare as Russian cosmonaut Lev Andropov who for
the last 18 months lived  a solitary life on a Russian space station
and therefore is a bit strange. Thus he provides the humor for this
noisy action flick by messing up his new American friends with his
bizarre ideas. He's the best choice for this wacky part, even if you
can't help asking yourself why a brilliant actor like him accepts a
part in this kind of project.
ARMAGEDDON will probably make people happy who thought that there
wasn't enough action in DEEP IMPACT. Go find a theater with a big
panorama screen and a digital sound system that is turned up till the
seats vibrate. Don't see it on video. With the benefit of a big
screen and great sound gone ARMAGEDDON is just an embarrassment. The
noisily promoted movie lives up to the promises of its makers only in
terms of volume.

Title
Review for Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997)
This movie tries to present itself as the sequel to Jan de Bont's
debut as a director, 1994 surprise hit SPEED. But the only thing the
two movies have in common is Sandra Bullock as the female lead.
Annie (Sandra Bullock) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again.
She's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend Alex (Jason Patric),
and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by John Geiger (Willem
Dafoe) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line. They sacked him
after he got sick. Now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe
for compensation.
That actually is the whole storyline. SPEED 2 could do without
dialogues. The movie is all about images and remarkable sound. I don't
really know why this is called an action movie. Except for a few
scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of SPEED this goes along the lines
of the desaster movies of the 70ies. First we are introduced to a
number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie.
Then desaster strikes.
Sandra Bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action
this time around. I looked for the "action" but couldn't find it. Most
of the time she is part of the decoration. The only time she is part
of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and
freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door. Now we know that
she can handle a chain saw. We also know that fire doors on cruise
ships can be cut apart in seconds. The bomb defusal of course goes
wrong, but only the furniture is damaged, not our heroes who still are
needed.
Jason Patric alias Alex spends most of his time flirting with Annie,
helping other passengers and frolicking in the water. His initial
sea-sickness is suddenly gone, because there are ship, crew and
passengers to be saved from evil Geiger. He does a pretty good job but
I can't blame Keanu Reeves for declining this part.
Then there's Willem Dafoe, the villain, who desperately tries to look
as frightening as Frankenstein's monster. He doesn't succeed, though.
An untidy appearance isn't enough to convince the viewer of his
psychopath potential. Before he tries again to make us believe he is a
dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror.
I can't really recommend SPEED 2. You will probably like the movie if
you like funny situations that aren't meant to be funny. Especially
the showdown, when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then
dissembles a whole village is a treat. There you get to see the most
superfluous scene in the movie. In keeping with last year's desaster
movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death. 
A really funny (and meant to be funny) scene takes place on the oil
tanker right before the collision. Some crew members watch two ships
colliding in an old movie. Had they looked out the window they
wouldn't have missed the huge ship racing toward them.
Those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater
with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual
effects and the phantastic surround sound effects. In an adequately
equipped theater it's as if the explosion were going off all around
you and you can feel the seats vibrate. But the ILM special effects
can't save the movie. For all the money they could have done better.

Title
Review for Anaconda (1997)
Director: Luis Llosa
Cast: Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Owen Wilson, Eric Stoltz
Humanities quest for knowledge never ends. So a team of scientists and
film-makers travel to the Amazon to search for a legendary Indian
tribe. The party consists of anthropologist Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz)
and the camera team consisting of Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez), Danny
Rich (Ice Cube), Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson), Denise Kahlberg (Kari
Wuhrer) and Warren Westridge (Jonathan Hyde). Early on their journey
they meet Paul Sarone (Jon Voight) whose boat is stuck on the shore.
They agree to give him a ride to the next village. He claims to know
the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe. Very soon
their friendliness backfires on the group because Sarone turns out to
be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant
anaconda and sell it to a zoo.
We don't have to wait too long for the giant snake. She just had a
panther hors d'oevre and now is looking for the main course. 
Our heroes paddle around in the Amazonas as if it were the pool in
their own backyard. No wonder giant animals mistake their splashing
for a dinner bell. Our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first
victim in one big gulp. Enjoy!
So much for the first attempt to catch her. But who would want to
catch a giant snake with a fishing pole? Our villain Sarone shows his
soft side when he stops Terri from shooting the snake. Too bad that
anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition.
One by one she goes after the others.
Eric Stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is
mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure. The rest of the
crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of
the movie had planned. However the scenes without the anaconda are
rather boring. Whenever the leading lady shows up we're in for a
laugh. The snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous
animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster. Her
attacks always follow the same plan: one last hypnotic look - she's
looking at you, kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her
victim and starts to gush it down. Mostly we don't see the act of
devouring. But she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging
middle part. Whoever did the special effects on this movie may have
wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes. Maybe then the
anaconda model would have looked more real.
The animatronics are somewhat more believable. But that didn't work
for the strangling scenes. Don't go see the movie for the F/X. They
are everything but up-to-date.
The viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her
surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team. We may
doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work. A
well known American science magazine is also mentioned in the credits,
but I will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its
reputation. The majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon
as the credits start rolling, anyway.
What kind of audience is the target group for this movie? Hard to say.
This can't be a serious horror movie, or can it? See for yourself.

Title
Review for Contact (1997)
Director: Robert Zemeckis
Starring Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skerrit, Angela
Basset, John Hurt, James Woods
Even as a child Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) shows a strong affinity
for natural sciences fostered by her father until his untimely death.
She has a particular predilection for astronomy and the search for
intelligent life on other planets. After obtaining her doctorate at
MIT she gets a job at the SETI institute in New Mexico. When after
years of unavailing research the money for further projects is denied
to her, the most incredible thing happens: she receives signals
originating on a star named Vega 26 light years away. Having grappled
with the initially alarming nature of the message (a TV coverage of
the 1936 Olympic Games' inauguration at Berlin), they discover coded
information containing the construction manual for a mysterious
machine. The United States decide to build it, turning a blind eye to
opponents who suspect a diabolical instrument for the elimination of
mankind. In fact, the first test run ends in a catastrophe, albeit in
a somewhat different way than most people had feared. The project
seems to be finished, but Ellie is still in for a surprise. 
CONTACT presents Jodie Foster in one of her best parts ever, namely an
ambitious scientist called Dr. Ellie Arroway who has to stand her
ground in a field traditionally belonging to the men's world. The only
trouble is that she does it because of a childhood trauma  she never
managed to overcome the loss of her beloved father. Quite obviously,
Hollywood still hasn't grappled with the dilemma of accepting a strong
female character simply behaving in a normal' way as it would be
naturally expected of a man. This can also be seen from the fact that
previous to a press conference at which to report her research results
to the public Ellie, who otherwise seems to have rather little
interest in secular things, is preoccupied with only one thought:
where to get a particularly attractive and extravagant dress. In a
film such as CONTACT, which contrasts agreeably with science fiction
films commonly produced in tinsel town, this detail is especially
conspicuous. 
Robert Zemeckis' film is a strikingly close adaptation of Carl Sagan's
novel and consequently encompasses the faith versus science' issue
repeatedly touched on by Sagan. For example, the construction of the
machine' attracts a phalanx of religious fanatics preaching the end
of the world. In many individuals the impending turn of the century
evokes the angst of the Judgement Day, equally well known to our
modern society as to medieval Europe 1000 years ago. Another matter of
great human concern is the question about the existence of God, or
whether it is right to send scientists to a remote star although they
don't believe in God. The church is embodied by Father' Palmer Joss
(Matthew McConaughey), a former priest who appears as a confirmed
representative of the Catholic faith although for personal reasons he
did not finish the seminary. The love story, which seems to be
compulsory in Hollywood, starts to blossom between him and Ellie; in
this film however, it is a drawback rather than an asset because it is
virtually redundant and does not promote the action.
Having said that, CONTACT is one of the films most worthy to view this
year with its placid yet not boring narrative and a flood of fantastic
pictures especially captivating. The special effects do not simply
function in their own right, but because they are elements required by
the plot. They provide the film with an aesthetic quality rarely to be
found in this genre. Right at the beginning for example the audience
is taken on a ride through the solar system to the centre of the Milky
Way, the significance of which is only revealed in the course of the
film.
Some may think that with a 2˝ hours' run CONTACT is unreasonably long,
but that way the story has time enough to develop. The main cast is
perfect and several cameos of American TV celebrities render the
scenario even more realistic. So if an action spectacle featuring many
explosions, shoot-outs, spaceships and chases is something you can
very well do without, you should not miss out on this one.
