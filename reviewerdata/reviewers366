Review for Ballad of Ramblin' Jack, The (2000)
Most people have never heard of Jack Elliott, and the few who have
probably don't know much about him.  An intriguing new documentary
called The Ballad of Ramblin' Jack does a fine job telling Elliott's
story to its viewers, but the person who learns the most about him is
the film's director  who just happens to be Ramblin' Jack's daughter.
Ramblin' Jack portrays Elliott as a disorganized, irresponsible man with
no parental skills.  Daughter/director Aiyana Elliott grew up with her
mom, while her dad was constantly on the road.  You might get the
impression that she's only making this film to finally spend some
quality time with her father, and parts of Ramblin' Jack play remarkably
similar to the scenes in Almost Famous where young William Miller tries
to get Stillwater's enigmatic guitarist Russell Hammond to sit down for
an interview.  Elliott is just as evasive, always finding something to
distract him from Aiyana's questions about the past.
In addition to being a neglectful dad, Elliott also happens to be a
living folk legend.  A protégé of Woody Guthrie, Elliott was an
extremely fast flat-picker who began performing in New York's Washington
Square Park and, ultimately, influenced the likes of Paul McCartney,
Mick Jagger and Bob Dylan.  In fact, Dylan was often criticized for
sounding too much like Elliott, and his early shows were billed as The
Son of Jack Elliott.
Elliott looks, sounds and acts like a tough, dusty cowboy who could herd
cattle in his sleep, so finding out that Elliott is the son of a Jewish
doctor from Brooklyn is kind of like realizing that the imported lager
you're drinking was bottled in New Jersey.  Born Elliott Adnopoz in
1931, Elliott never thought about following in his pop's footsteps,
instead falling in love with The Grand Ole Opry radio program.  When
Gene Autry's rodeo came to Madison Square Garden, Elliott found his true
calling.  He ran away from home at 16 to join a rodeo, where he learned
to play the guitar from a rodeo clown.
Finding limited success musically in the U.S., Elliott took off for
England  a country in the midst of a folk craze populated by marginally
talented `skiffle' bands.  Elliott's authentic brand of down-home folk
tunes from America's heartland took England by storm, and he sold out
shows and recorded several popular albums there.  Six years later,
Elliott came back to the States as somewhat of a mysterious legend. Fans
had heard his albums and knew that he was a close friend of Woody, but
they had never seen the cowboy in action.
Ramblin' Jack is really two films  one a straight documentary about a
crucial link in American folk music history, and the other a painfully
unflinching look at the dysfunctional relationship between a father and
his daughter.  As a result, the film runs a little long, and may quickly
lose the interest of viewers who aren't folk fans.  It's a very
interesting look at the life of a very interesting figure.
The film, which won awards at the Sundance and San Francisco Film
Festivals, is cobbled together from two years of recent footage from
Elliott's seemingly endless cross-country touring and vintage
performances from the 60s and 70s (including a 1969 appearance on the
Johnny Cash Show that took place two weeks before Aiyana was born), as
well as an incredibly impressive amount of home movie footage - not just
from Aiyana's youth, but Jack's, too.  There are also numerous
interviews with family members (including two ex-wives), friends and
folk icons like Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie and Kris Kristofferson.

Review for Vénus beauté (institut) (1999)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Venus Beauty Institute is a clumsy and unremarkable French film that's
either a run-of-the-mill chick flick, a caustic look at women's obsession
with beauty, or both.  Its main character is a desperate, middle-aged woman
who loves to strike up conversations with strangers, hoping they'll take her
to bed (or to their car, if there isn't a bed close by).  Maybe I missed the
boat on this one, being a 30-year-old abstinent male loner, so take the
following with a grain of salt.
Angčle (Nathalie Baye, An Affair of Love) works in a Parisian beauty shop,
where she provides facials, manicures and massages to those ravaged by both
age and gravity.  She's twice as old as her co-workers, doesn't wear makeup,
hates love and is terrified of relationships because of something that
happened to her parents when she was a child.  But Angčle still loves sex
and will spread for just about anyone after a couple of drinks.
It comes as no surprise when Angčle, who is used to stalking her own sexual
prey, is turned off when a man approaches her with romantic aspirations of
his own. Antoine (Samuel Le Bihan) is a sculptor who professes his undying
love for Angčle, despite having a fiancée.  Even though he's probably half
her age, Antoine is relentless in his pursuit of Angčle, no matter how
little interest she shows in him.  Because this is a movie, you know his
persistence will eventually pay off (in real life, she'd get a restraining
order and he'd be in jail).
As Angčle's relationship with Antoine plays out, we are also introduced to
her beauty shop co-workers and the wacky customers attendant thereto.
Everyone talks about looking young and beautiful, but they're all just as
emotionally broken as Angčle in one way or another.  The shop sells various
lotions, balms and ointments, and has an irritating door chime that, at
first, made it seem like something magical was about to happen on the screen
(it didn't...and then rings about 75 more times).  The not-so-subtle message
here is that people can shell out hundreds of francs for an expensive salve
to mask their exterior flaws, but it won't do a damn thing to cover up the
fact they're damaged on the inside.
Though Venus' ending is somewhat visually pleasing (sparks fly - literally)
and Baye does a good job playing the unhappy lead desperately clinging to
her youth, the film failed to strike an emotional chord.  It is refreshing
to see a movie that features women (both in front of and behind the camera)
refrains from bashing all men, like pictures of this ilk tend to do.  Baye
is 52 in real life, but can easily pass for Angčle's early 40s.
Venus was written and directed by French actress Tonie Marshall, who crams
the film's beauty shop scenes full of colorful pastels.  She adds some
unique camera angles and there are several interestingly edited segments,
but other than that and Baye's standout performance, there just isn't much
to gush about.  Venus did sweep through the 2000 César Awards (the French
version of the Oscars) like Ted Kennedy through happy hour, winning trophies
for Best Film, Director and Screenplay.

Title
Review for Palmetto (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Talk about false advertising.  The trailer for Palmetto tries to sell it
as a sexy thriller.  Strange, because there wasn't any sex and it wasn't
very thrilling.
Woody Harrelson stars as Harry Barber (insert dick joke here), a
ex-journalist currently serving a four years for exposing some sort of
corruption in the sleepy Florida town of Palmetto.  Harry is freed two
years into his sentence after someone turns state's evidence.  Bitter
and resentful of his incarceration, Harry plans to head as far away from
Palmetto as possible.
He sticks to his plan for all of two minutes, when ex-girlfriend Nina
(Gina Gershon) meets Harry just after his prison release.  The romance
is quickly rekindled, but strangely not shown to the viewers.  He starts
to look for work the next day, but finds nothing suitable until he falls
into the insipid plot line.  The plot-line with no sex.
While sitting in a bar and ordering bourbon that he smells but never
drinks, Harry eyes a curvy stranger using the phone.  The dame is Rhea
Malroux (Elisabeth Shue, The Saint), wife of the richest old guy with
terminal lung cancer in town and she offers Harry a mysterious one-time
high-paying job.  They agree to meet at a bungalow on the outskirts of
town to discuss the position further.
At the bungalow, Rhea reveals a plan to extort money from her rich
husband.  Her stepdaughter Odette (Chloe Sevigny, Gummo) will pretend to
be the victim of a kidnapping with the $500,000 ransom payable them
both.  Harry would clear ten percent for simply writing the ransom note
and collecting the cash.  Using the popular `Are you wearing a wire?
Let me frisk you to be good and sure' ploy to cop a feel, Harry seals
the deal with some steamy, but again unshown sex.
Predictably, once the plan is in place, things fall apart for Harry.  He
has fallen right into somebody's trap, but has no idea whom.  Leaving a
laughably unmistakable trail of clues that makes the Brown-Goldman
murder scene seem sterile, Harry tries to right each wrong that he
finds, but only manages to fall deeper and deeper into the scam.  How
this guy was smart enough to unmask corruption as a reporter, I will
never know.
There are some pretty cool twists in the last twenty minutes or so, but
I was so bored by that point that it hardly seemed to matter.  Director
Volker Schlondorff (The Handmaid's Tale) presents the story with all of
the emotion of a cold heartless German.  As a side note, Volker
Schlondorff was going to be my stage name if I ever decided to go into
porn.
Harrelson plays the slow-witted Harry not unlike each of his previous
film characters.  The unique casting of Shue as the naughty seductive
bombshell and Gershon as the steady vulnerable girlfriend seems reversed
from their norm, which is not necessarily a good thing.  Sevigny and the
oddly subdued Michael Rapaport stand out in supporting roles.  Did I
mention that there was no sex?
I wasn't going to bring this up, but if I had just gotten released from
prison and had Gina Gershon as an eager girlfriend, I would not have had
time to get wrapped up in a bad mystery like this.  I'd be too busy
getting what this move promised, but never delivered.

Title
Review for Green Mile, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Frank Darabont's follow-up to his Oscar-nominated 1994 film The
Shawshank Redemption will likely elicit comparisons to that much-loved
work.  Both films were adapted from the works of Stephen King and both
are set in the correctional systems of several decades ago.  While
Shawshank concentrated on the lives of two prisoners, The Green Mile's
focus is on the guards.  Mile is a riveting, well-paced, magical gift
full of delicious twists and turns.  It's long (180 minutes), but films
that have to contend with Southern accents generally run about 12%
longer than normal.
Tom Hanks (You've Got Mail) stars as Paul Edgecomb, a Depression-era
Death Row prison guard in Cold Mountain Louisiana State Penitentiary's E
block, which is also known as "the Green Mile" because of the
lime-colored paint job.  Edgecomb genuinely cares about his prisoners,
despite having to supervise their executions via the electric chair
(nickname: Ol' Sparky) with his fellow guards, played by David Morse
(Crazy in Alabama), Barry Pepper (Saving Private Ryan) and Doug
Hutchison (Batman & Robin), with the latter serving as the film's
antagonist, the spoiled nephew of the Governor's wife.
Mile's structure (and running time) resembles that of Titanic, beginning
and ending in the present day with an elderly Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer,
Picket Fences) and flashing back to 1935 for the majority of the film. 
Edgecomb tells the story of one particular inmate that changed his life
forever.  The prisoner, John Coffey (Michael Duncan, Bear from
Armageddon), is a giant black man convicted of raping and murdering two
white girls.  Coffey was found with the two victims in his arms, their
blonde hair matted with blood, and, as a result, Edgecomb and crew
expect the worst from this prisoner.  Instead, they find Coffey to be
more of a lamb than a lion, referring to the guards as "Boss" and asking
if they can keep a light on at night because he's afraid of the dark. 
While Coffey never proclaims his innocence, Edgecomb somehow detects it
I know what you're thinking - another one of these prison films where
someone has been wrongly convicted, with the entire focus of the picture
centering on them (or a second party) proving their innocence in the
final reel.  Every prison movie is like this (this year alone we've had
Instinct, True Crime and Double Jeopardy), which is probably why HBO's
OZ, a realistic prison drama with diabolically guilty characters, is
such a hit.  Plus, Coffey is in the last cell, making it the furthest
away from Ol' Sparky, so you know that eventually he'll have to take the
long walk.  It's just common sense.
But then, something happens.  Seventy minutes in, you realize Mile is
not your typical prison flick.  If you don't know the story, the
development in the story at this point of the film is a jaw-dropping
shocker.  Even after momentarily being taken aback, it still seems
painfully obvious where the rest of the film is going, but Mile isn't
through surprising yet.  The second-to-last-reel is absolutely
spellbinding.
Returning to Darabont's crew are Shawshank nominees Thomas Newman
(score), Richard Francis-Bruce (editing) and Robert J. Litt (sound), but
missing is cinematographer Roger Deakins (replaced by Episode One's
David Tattersall).  As a result, Mile doesn't look anywhere near as keen
as Shawshank's muted blues and grays.  Darabont's direction is terrific,
creating a leisurely pace yet somehow not letting the story drag.  He
uses a clip of Top Hat's Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers "Dancing Cheek
to Cheek" as emotional bookends to Edgecomb's flashback and peppers the
story with adequate humor, courtesy of a prison mouse named Mr. Jingles.
I was starting to lose faith in Tom Hanks as an actor, feeling that his
early comedy work easily outdistanced his mediocre dramas.  I'll take
his performances in A League of Their Own, Big and Punchline over his
over-praised Philadelphia ("Ooh, I can cry with fake lesions stuck to my
face"), Apollo 13 ("Ooh, I can look worried") and Saving Private Ryan
("Ooh, I can make my hand shake").  His directorial effort, That Thing
You Do!, was a mess, and don't even get me started on Mail, where he
phoned in his performance from the other side of the moon.  Hanks seemed
more interested in lending either his talent to develop pet projects,
like From the Earth to the Moon and Return With Honor, or his voice to
Toy Story's Woody.
But here, Hanks is a genuine pleasure to watch.  His Edgecomb is
pleasingly pudgy, has a decent Southern drawl and even gets to endure a
painful bladder infection.  He seems to be a lock for his fifth Academy
Award nomination and, since he has a black co-star, his odds of winning
seem pretty good.  Remember, he won for Forrest Gump (with Mykelti
Williamson) and Philadelphia (with Denzel Washington) while his
lily-white films (Apollo 13, Big and Ryan) sent him home empty-handed on
Oscar night.
And it's not just Hanks' performance that makes Mile a winner -
everybody is outstanding, from the usually reliable Morse and James
Cromwell (The Bachelor) to the usually annoying Michael Jeter (Jakob the
Liar) and Sam Rockwell (Safe Men).  Bonnie Hunt (Random Hearts) is, at
first, unrecognizable as Edgecomb's wife, beautifully portraying a
weathered, middle-aged woman in a rare non-comedic role.  But Duncan
steals the show as the scarred, hulking kitten with a voice that seems
several octaves lower than Barry White.  He's not extraordinarily tall
in real life, but Darabont skillfully shoots the actor to make him
appear about nine feet tall.  A fitting height for such a lofty film.

Review for Yards, The (2000)
It's been 27 years since The Exorcist forever changed the nation's
perception of pea soup.  The film, which was nominated for 10 Oscars,
including Best Picture, Best Director and three acting roles (it won for
sound and screenplay), allegedly caused some people to flee theatres in
a horrified panic.  But since its theatrical release in 1973, The
Exorcist has only been seen via badly edited TV versions and fading,
crusty old copies of the videotape.  The fact that the film spawned two
lousy sequels (one from The General's John Boorman, and one from The
Exorcist's author and screenwriter William Peter Blatty) didn't help
either.
Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, The Exorcist has been
restored with a cleaned-up picture, completely overhauled sound and
about a dozen additional minutes that didn't appear in the original
version (although some were on a recently released DVD).  But one
lingering question remains  will viewers today be as affected by the
film as they were back in 1973?
The answer is probably not.  The screening I attended was plagued with
mocking laughter and people leaving out of sheer boredom.  I should
mention that the screening was sponsored by a local `modern rock'
station, and most of the crowd was made up of young men and women that
have been weaned on a steady diet of slasher flicks that prominently
feature a grisly murder before the opening credits roll.
What these little douche bags don't understand is that you don't need a
high body count, gallons of fake blood and things making you jump every
five minutes to make a suspenseful film.  In fact, that's the alluring
part of The Exorcist.  Director William Friedkin (Rules of Engagement)
paces the film so slowly, the ending almost becomes a reward in
patience.
Just take the opening scene, where Friedkin takes a brief, five-page
epilogue from the book and audaciously transforms it into a 12-minute
segment that has little to do with the rest of the film.  In it, we are
introduced to Father Merrin (Max von Sydow, Snow Falling on Cedars) an
elderly priest on an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq.  He finds a
creepy idol (not unlike the one Greg had in The Brady Bunch's
multi-episode Hawaiian vacation) and begins to shake uncontrollably
while reaching for both the drink and his nitroglycerine pills.
Meanwhile, movie star Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn, Requiem For a Dream)
and her 12-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) are temporarily living
in Georgetown while Chris shoots a film.  They rent a lovely home
(complete with a staff of three), but their lives are interrupted by a
demonic spirit that decides to take up residence in young Regan.
Thinking there is something physically wrong with her daughter, Chris
drags Regan to a bunch of clueless doctors that run a lot of pointless
tests before sending her off to a shrink.  It's really funny to watch
the doctors whip out cigarettes while they give cheesy explanations for
Regan's odd behavior (Ritalin is their treatment).  They blow smoke in
Chris' face while they blow smoke up her ass.
Looking for alternatives to medications and asylums, Chris turns to
Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, Rudy), a Jesuit priest and
psychiatrist struggling with his faith after the death of his mother.
Damian's freaky nightmare montage of his dead mother emerging from the
subway entrance is one of the best ever.
Friedkin takes his time developing the characters, which makes the
ending that much more emotional for the viewer.  It's over 30 minutes
before anything makes you jump, 45 before anything remotely supernatural
occurs, and an hour has passed before the real hijinks start.  The
spooky events are spaced far apart and grow more disturbing as the film
progresses.  You begin to dread each time Chris runs up the stairs and
into Regan's room.
Purportedly based on true events, The Exorcist was adapted from Blatty's
best-selling 1971 novel.  The film's acting, especially from Blair and
first-timer Miller, are fantastic.  At that year's Academy Awards, the
14-year-old Blair lost to 10-year-old Tatum O'Neal (Paper Moon).  The
redone sound is marvelous.  You can even hear the aquarium in Regan's
room, which is kind of exciting because you can barely tell she has an
aquarium in the tape at your local video store.
2:15  R for adult language and violence

Title
Review for Wonder Boys (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Michael Douglas is not getting any younger.  In Wonder Boys, he plays an
English professor from western Pennsylvania.  He wears a woman's
bathrobe, is never seen without an effeminate red scarf, and has
old-lady glasses like Sally Jessy Raphael.  His character is
middle-aged, rumpled and sad, but I'm not even sure this is acting.  To
think that this guy knocked up Catherine Zeta-Jones is as disgusting as
it is perplexing.
Douglas (A Perfect Murder) plays Grady Tripp, who, in addition to being
an English teacher, is a successful novelist that hasn't been able to
finish the follow-up to his critically acclaimed success from seven
years ago.  And when I say he isn't able to finish it, I mean he isn't
mentally able.  Grady has several thousand single-spaced pages typed but
is no closer to the ending than when he began.
Grady also has a few other things going on his life.  His wife just left
him and he's hot for one of his students (Katie Holmes, Dawson's
Creek).  Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr., Bowfinger), his editor, is
on his way into town to read the book that Grady assured him was
finished.  Grady's girlfriend (Frances McDormand, Madeline), who happens
to be the Chancellor at his unnamed university, is pregnant despite the
fact that it's been a while since she's slept with her husband (Richard
Thomas, John-Boy Walton), who happens to be the Chairman of the English
Department.
As if that isn't enough to occupy his mind (and yours), Grady and an
awkward student named James Leer (Tobey Maguire, The Cider House Rules)
spend a day on the run after they accidentally kill the Chancellor's
dog.  As things begin to spiral out of control, you can't help but think
about a younger Douglas going through similar situations in Falling
Down.  The actor also provides the gravelly narration for the film,
which is told in the first-person through his character.
Wonder Boys is the first film Curtis Hanson has directed since his
amazing adaptation of L.A. Confidential.  It offers further proof that
anyone can direct a really great script.  Not that he's a bad director
or anything - in fact, there are several nice hand-held camera shots
from interesting angles in the film, while cinematographer Dante
Spinotti (who worked on Confidential and The Insider) gives the picture
a warm, rich look.  The film was shot on location in western
Pennsylvania, and Carnegie-Mellon University was used for the school
shots.
The script was adapted from Michael Chabon's novel by Steven Kloves
(Flesh and Bone).  Kloves' script follows the book pretty closely, but
for time's sake, he is forced to leave off a great scene where Grady
takes James to his in-laws' for Passover dinner.  The acting is pretty
solid all around, but the casting is a little goofy.  In the book, Grady
and Terry were supposed to have met in school, implying that they're
close in age.  Douglas and Downey, Jr. are over twenty years apart in
real life.
The best part about the film is the amazing soundtrack, highlighted by a
new Bob Dylan song (`Things Have Changed') recorded exclusively for
Wonder Boys.  There are three other Dylan songs included in the film,
along with numbers from Buffalo Springfield, John Lennon and Van
Morrison.  Standouts include Leonard Cohen's `Waiting for the Miracle,'
which you may remember from Natural Born Killers, and Neil Young's `Old
Man,' which, while laughably appropriate, is remarkably poignant in the
film.  This is the first `must-have' soundtrack of the year.
Curiously, the title of the film is never explained  it's the name of
the book that Grady is writing in Chabon's novel.  So if you walk out
thinking you missed something, you really didn't.  Just some money and a
little bit of your time.

Review for October Sky (1999)
Some people can pinpoint an exact moment that changed their lives
forever.  For Homer Hickman, it was watching the Russian rocket Sputnik
race across the sky on a starry night in his small West Virginia mining
town.  Homer's life was never quite the same.
Like the other kids in Coalwood, Homer's future was pretty much mapped
out for him before he was even born - graduate high school, work in the
mines, get black lung and die before he hits 50.  And because his father
(Chris Cooper, Lone Star) ran the mines, Homer's inescapable fate seemed
even more likely than most.  That's why his friends and family were so
surprised when Homer pursued his new rocketry hobby with such a fervent
intensity.
With the singular goal of winning the National Science Fair (and the
college scholarship attendant thereto), Homer spends all of his free
time trying to launch a rocket high and straight into the sky.  His
father ignores him, his jock brother laughs, and his mother can only
warn, `Don't blow yourself up,' in A Christmas Story fashion.
Well, he almost does blow himself up on his first attempt, so Homer
drafts the school nerd, Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen), to help with the
chemistry end of things.  The next launch was a bit more successful,
with the rocket becoming airborne, but also dangerously zipping through
a crowd of workers at the mine.
Having been banished from further rocket experiments on company land 
which pretty much made up the entire town of Coalwood  Homer and his
friends hike eight miles to the outskirts of town to test their latest
projectiles.  Using money raised by selling parts of an unused railroad
track, they build a launch pad and an observation shack to safely view
the dangerous blasts and, with some help from the mine metal shop
workers and their spunky teacher (Laura Dern), they begin to make real
progress.  And as their rockets grow in both size and intellect, so do
their methods of detonation and the size of the crowds that initially
gather to mock, but end up walking away slack-jawed and dumbfounded.
The boys are adorable and charismatic in a Teen Beat sort of way and,
for all I know, could actually be members of the pop faves N-Sync. Homer
(Jake Gyllenhaal) is more than believable as an everyday kid fighting
the usual battles of the average teenager, but also sensibly mixes in
the fear elicited by the mine's constant presence, a weight that is
always hanging just above his head, ready to crush all of his hopes and
dreams.  Chris Cooper capably handles the role of the crusty, distant
dad while Laura Dern's `follow your dreams' schoolteacher is just a
throwaway role.
Director Joe Johnston's (Jumanji) use of the mine as a parallel of Hell
is very effective in this heartwarming true tale of this small-town boy
that eventually became a NASA employee.  The script is well-paced and
hits its only stumbling block when it throws in a mine union strike that
has little to do with the overall plot.  The closing credits include
actual footage of the young boys and their later launch attempts, which
helps to drive home the power of this story.  But I couldn't help
thinking, `What if it was cloudy that night when Sputnik sped by?'

Title
Review for Vertical Limit (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2000 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
A month or so ago, Sony sent a 30-minute highlight reel of their
upcoming film Vertical Limit to Rochester for critics to get a special
sneak preview of the mountain climbing movie's dazzling action
sequences. Most of the scenes, especially the first, looked pretty good,
so there was legitimate potential for Limit to entertain where similar
films (like Cliffhanger and K2) succeeded solely in sucking.
They should have left well enough alone, as the additional 96 minutes
that were left off Limit's highlight reel are downright awful.  The more
I learned about the characters, the more I hated them.  Ditto for the
film's story.  Perhaps it's because there is an inherent problem with
rooting for those who seek thrills by doing dumb things.  People who
insist on partaking in death-defying activities, be they bungee jumping,
mountain climbing, downhill skiing or masturbating with a kitchen knife
while jumping on a trampoline, deserve to be hurt.  Badly.
Limit opens similarly to M:I-2, putting its star(s) on the face of a red
rock mountain somewhere in the American southwest.  Instead of a
stealthy spy with no equipment, Limit shows a family of three playing
`Name That Tune' while they make their vertical ascent.  But something
goes wrong, leaving father Royce Garrett (Stuart Wilson, Here on Earth)
and his two adult children dangling from a rope meant to hold two
people. Royce tells his son Peter (Chris O'Donnell, The Bachelor) to cut
him loose, while daughter Annie (Robin Tunney, End of Days) pleads for
her father to not sacrifice his life.  It's a heart-in-your-throat scene
that is well-executed and as dramatic as anything you'll see in an
action film.
Unfortunately, the potential for the rest of Limit drops faster than
Royce. Flash forward three years, where Peter has sworn off the mountain
in favor of a photography career for National Geographic and his
estranged sister Annie has become one of the world's top climbers.  The
siblings haven't spoken since the accident but somehow end up in the
same place  at the base of Earth's second-largest peak (called `K2').
Peter is there to film Himalayan snow leopards, while Annie is involved
in a climb with a crackpot billionaire (Bill Paxton, U-571) who plans on
using the ascent to promote his new airline company.
And, wouldn't you know it, Annie's group is trapped in a crevasse near
the peak of K2, and Peter has a limited amount of time to rescue his
sister before the cold and high altitudes finish her off.  For a
climbing mate, Peter chooses the wacky, wizard-like Montgomery Wick
(Scott Glenn, The Virgin Suicides), who lost his wife on the same
mountain during a climb sponsored by the same billionaire some four
years earlier.
Limit is poorly paced, just like director Martin Campbell's last effort,
The Mask of Zorro.  The scenes filmed outside look fantastic, thanks to
the keen eye of cinematographer David Tattersall (The Green Mile), but
Limit also features scenes filmed on hokey, ice-covered sets that have
"sound stage" written all over them (not literally, but they may as well
have). The transition from the lovely outdoors (filmed on and around New
Zealand's Mt. Cook) to the pretend outdoors looks awful and, at times,
is laughable.  Conversely, Limit's jokes and one-liners are anything
but.

Review for Walk on the Moon, A (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
A bored housewife is the focus of this film.  And if that doesn't give
you any indication of the overall boringness of the movie, then read
on.  Diane Lane (Murder at 1600) stars as Pearl Kantrowitz, a seemingly
happy wife and mother of two  until the family takes its annual trek
from New York City to Woodbridge for summer vacation.  Here, Pearl
realizes that she missed out on too much of her life by becoming knocked
up at the early age of 17.
So instead of turning to valium like all of the other hausfraus, she
starts screwing the traveling blouse salesman (Viggo Mortensen, A
Perfect Murder) that occasionally pops into the shanty vacation town to
peddle wares to the stranded women.  She doesn't learn his name until
later.  And because the film is set in the summer of 1969, the
filmmakers have Pearl and the Blouse Man make love with the requisite
nostalgic backdrops  Woodstock and the moon landing.
Pearl gives no thought to the fact that her hard-working television
repairman husband (Liev Schreiber, Scream) gave up things in his life,
too.  Or to her kids, Alison and Daniel (Anna Paquin and Bobby
Boriello).  Or to her fortune-telling mother-in-law (Tovah Feldshuh, Law
& Order) who keeps Pearl's affair from her own son.  Or even to the poor
fools that have to watch this film.
The anemic script is blandly directed by Tony Goldwyn (the bad guy in
Ghost) but is more of a showcase for some very fine acting.  The best
parts, however, are actually from an unseen actress  Julie Kavner is
the uncredited voice of the resorts social director that can often be
heard announcing to the yenta vacationers `The knish man is on the
premises.'  (1:45  R for nudity, sex and adult language)

Review for Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Errol Morris' work is unmistakable.  The celebrated documentary
filmmaker blends familiar music, extreme close-ups and slow-motion shots
that fluctuate between polished color and rich black-and-white as Morris
focuses his lens on slightly deranged yet exceptionally passionate
subjects.  In Mr. Death, Morris (Fast, Cheap and Out of Control) selects
a Massachusetts engineer to plunk down in front of his camera.
Of course Fred Leuchter, Jr. isn't your average engineer from New
England.  He's an expert in the construction of execution equipment.
Leuchter is all for the death penalty, but is sickened by torturous
executions caused by antiquated equipment that could potentially result
in unnecessary grief for both the prisoner and any witnesses present at
the execution.  He's helped build a better electric chair for the
Tennessee State Prison, created a lethal injection system for New
Jersey, and designed a new helmet for the North Carolina electric chair
(the previous model was still younger than Jesse Helms).
It's easy to get wrapped up in Leuchter's enthusiasm for his
profession.  He takes his work very seriously, a fact that becomes
evident as he describes the delicately emotional relationship between
prison guards and death-row inmates.  And it only takes Leuchter about
sixty seconds to sum up this connection, compared to the three-plus-hour
message delivered by the unwieldy film The Green Mile.  It's this kind
of efficiency that drove the chain-smoking caffeine addict to the top of
his game.
But a steady diet of coffee and cigarettes can also warp your
sensibility, as exhibited when Mr. Death switches focus from Leuchter's
work background to a criminal trial in Toronto during the late 80s.
Revisionist Historian Ernst Zundel, accused of publishing false
statements (a crime in Canada) concerning the denial of the Holocaust,
contracted Leuchter to examine forensic evidence from the eastern
European concentration camps and gas chambers to prove his innocence.
Despite the fact that Zundel was a well-known neo-Nazi and the publisher
of a book called "The Hitler We Loved and Why,' Leuchter eagerly jumps
at the opportunity to step into the limelight, figuring that the trial
could be the crowning achievement of his career.  What he doesn't expect
is vocational execution, hence the lengthy title of the film.
Morris is in top form here, once again taking subject matter that I
would equate with watching paint peel and turning it into an
almost-riveting ninety-minute film.  His ability to lay out the story of
his subject is second-to-none and  thanks to cinematographer Robert
Richardson (Snow Falling on Cedars)  also beautifully photographed.
Morris effectively splits the film in halves, with the first
establishing Leuchter as a harmless nerd and the second showing that
evil can illuminate from the most unexpected sources.
1:30  PG-13 for mild adult language and a scene depicting the execution
of an elephant

Review for Siegfried & Roy: The Magic Box (1999)
One time I loudly mentioned to someone that I'd see any film, no matter
how stupid, as long as it was in 3-D (this was before Battlefield Earth
was released).  Well, somebody must have heard me and then gone out and
made Siegfried & Roy: The Magic Box, the latest film made for IMAX in
their wonderful 3-D format.  All jokes about their sexual preferences
aside (as S & R say, `In magic, anything is possible'), I've always been
more that a little bit uncomfortable with two German guys that insist on
surrounding themselves with the whitest animals on the face of the
planet.
So I checked my preconceived notions at the door and prepared to be
dazzled by an onslaught of incredible images from the bonus film
dimension.  And IMAX doesn't disappoint here; Box is a lot of fun to
watch, as long as you don't pay much attention to the actual content of
the film, which tells the life story of S & R.
Siegfried Fischbacher grew up in Rosenheim, Germany, and became obsessed
with magic at an early age.  After dazzling his father with a trick,
Siegfried rode his bike to a Munich magic shop, where he apparently
learned the tools of his trade.  Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn hails from
Nordenham, Germany, and was as crazy about animals as Siegfried was
about magic.  He had a half-wolf/half-dog that saved his life, and
eventually befriended a Bremen Zoo cheetah named Chico.
Much is made of S & R's difficulties growing up in war-torn Germany, but
I couldn't help but think that they were better off there than in Poland
or Austria during World War II.  The paths of the two future Vegas
performers finally crossed aboard a luxury liner, where Siegfried
performed his magic and Roy was a waiter.
The two eventually took their show on the road, receiving little pay and
less glory.  They even had to eat burnt potatoes because Chico's lean,
raw meat diet was siphoning all of their cash.  It's hard to feel sorry
for them when they wear ridiculous outfits, live in fabulously gaudy
homes and seem more concerned with their tans and their hair than they
do anything else.  Hey, they can buy you and sell you a million times
over  don't feel sorry for them.  Besides, why did they have to eat
burnt potatoes?  That just means one of them was a really bad cook.
On the plus side, director Brett Leonard (IMAX's T-Rex: Back to the
Cretaceous) does a great job connecting scenes together with incredible
3-D images, a lot of which reminded me of the Dutch film Character for
some reason.  He doesn't have much to work with in terms of a story, but
Leonard adds enough of his own touch to keep the film interesting.  Sir
Anthony Hopkins (Mission: Impossible 2) provides decent narration, as
well.

Title
Review for Road Trip (2000)
DreamWorks' first foray into tasteless teen territory is a bawdy blend
of American Pie's horny adolescence (minus the pastry porking) and
There's Something About Mary's affinity toward semen-as-a-sight-gag.
And in terms of overall entertainment, Road Trip ranks somewhere between
its two predecessors  a rare film that is consistently funny with the
majority of its jokes hitting the bulls-eye.
Trip is largely told via flashback by Barry (Tom Green, The Tom Green
Show), an eighth-year student at the fictitious University of Ithaca.
The tour guide for prospective students and their parents, Barry is
pressed for details about exciting stories of campus life and eventually
begins to tell the tale of one Josh Porter.
Josh (Breckin Meyer, Go) was, Barry explains, an IU student trying to
survive a long-distance relationship with his lifelong girlfriend
Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard, The Rage: Carrie 2), who is currently
attending veterinary school at the University of Austin.  Josh's
nightmares of Tiffany's potential infidelities, coupled with the fact
that she won't return his phone calls, leads the sophomore to a
one-night fling with a hot blonde named Beth (Amy Smart, Felicity).  A
videotape is made and accidentally mailed to Tiffany, who it turns out,
wasn't calling Josh back because of a death in the family.
Still wanting to maintain a romantic relationship with Tiffany, Josh
decides to hit the road to intercept the tape before his girlfriend gets
it.  His friends E.L. (Seann William Scott, Final Destination) and Rubin
(Paulo Costanzo, in his film debut) con Kyle (DJ Qualls, in his film
debut), a nerdy compulsive masturbator with a credit card and a sky-blue
Ford Taurus, to provide the wheels for the road trip to Austin.
The trip, of course, is full of wacky teen hijinks, like stealing from
the blind, Evil Knievel-style jumps over washed-out bridges and, what is
sure to be the equivalent of Pie's pie scene, sperm donation.  There are
two subplots, one involving Beth's ill-advised journey to Boston (and
not Austin) to find Tiffany, and the other entails a jealous teacher's
aide (Anthony Rapp, Man of the Century) hell-bent on making Josh miss
his Ancient Philosophy midterm.
Oh, and here are some major plot holes  Beth knows Tiffany's last name
from seeing it on the videotape's envelope, but doesn't remember that
she doesn't go to school in Boston.  And for some reason, Josh needs to
pull a B-plus on his midterm to pass the class.  I guess the final exam
doesn't count.  Despite it being midterm in upstate New York, there is
no snow on the ground.
While some people will insist that Trip could be American Pie 2: The
College Years, the film smacks more of a 1998 straight-to-video picture
called Overnight Delivery (the only reason I know about Delivery is
because Dogma's Kevin Smith was supposed to have done an un-credited
rewrite of the script).  Save the presence of the Josh and Beth's
videotape, it's exactly the same film  very light on script, but full
of gags.
Filmed in Georgia, using four different college campuses, Trip was
directed, composed and co-written by Todd Phillips, who is probably best
known for Frat House, a documentary that won the top prize at the 1998
Sundance Film Festival and was purchased by HBO but never shown on
television amid allegations that the antics of the fraternity members 
especially regarding brutal pledge hazing  were all staged.  Trip was
executive-produced by Ivan Reitman and features great cameos by Andy
Dick (Inspector Gadget), Horatio Sands (Saturday Night Live) and a very
funny voice-over by The Man Show's Jimmy Kimmel.

Review for Two Thousand and None (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Movies about dying people suck.  So do the people who make them, and the
people who line up to see them.  What's the point?  Filmmakers keep churning
them out to provide actors with a showcase to display their chops, but most
are downright horrible at both pretending to die and pretending to be upset
about the other person pretending to die.  Viewers keep going to see these
films, and they always fucking cry at the end, even though they know it's
coming before they get in the car to go to the theatre.  Philadelphia?  An
overrated piece of shit (and the worst performance to ever win a Best Actor
trophy).  And who wants to bet that the upcoming Charlize Theron/Keanu
Reeves tearjerker Sweet November isn't going to be a complete waste of time?
Any takers?  I hope they find cures for cancer and AIDS just so film
characters can stop dying.
Now, a comedy about dying people is a whole different ballgame.  I'm not
saying the Farrelly brothers should make a film about the Holocaust, or that
the South Park guys tackling slavery would be a good idea (okay, I'd
probably still be the first one in line), but there's definitely room in the
marketplace for a lighthearted film about death.  Two Thousand and None is
that film.  It's a smart, quirky and, most importantly, funny film about a
normal guy who happens to be dying.
John Turturro (O Brother, Where Art Thou?) plays Benjamin Kasparian, a
soon-to-be-divorced paleontologist who, as the film opens, has just
discovered a new fish fossil important enough to make the science world
reconsider what they know about evolution.  He gets a lot of headaches and,
after a visit to the doctor, learns he's got a brain-swelling disease called
Talbot's Syndrome.  Benjamin is given five weeks to live and is told that he
may lose his memory and ability to hear.
Sounds like a blast, right?  It is.  Benjamin develops a sense of humor and
an ability to be honest with everyone he knows and meets.  His pals,
co-workers and ex (played by Katherine Borowitz, Turturro's real-life wife)
can't deal with Benjamin's impending death and think he's flipped his lid
when he keeps trying to ditch them to have a good time with his remaining
days.  Everyone else is all, like, "But you're dying," and he's all, like,
"Aren't we all?"
As his brain swells, Benjamin begins to have cool black-and-white
hallucinations in reflections of various watery surfaces (a puddle, a cup of
coffee, etc.).  He has imaginary conversations with his dead parents, who
tell him to return their remains to Armenia.  And there's a whole side plot
involving the cloning of Benjamin's brain, which is simultaneously amusing
and disturbing.
Two Thousand was written and directed by Arto Paragamian, who, as far as I
know, used to coach football at Notre Dame.  It's nice to see that he's made
such a successful transition from the gridiron to the screen (yeah, I know -
it was Ara Parseghian).  The film, which is really made by Turturro's
terrific performance, isn't too bogged down with heavy messages about the
meaning of life.  That is, not until the end, where Benjamin begins to
confront his own mortality, and Two Thousand turns into, well, a
conventional film about a guy dying.

Review for Big Hit, The (1998)
The Big Hit does not explicitly state that it takes place in the present
day. I'm only guessing that it's supposed to, but I still remain
completely stumped. See, the problem is that the characters use phrases
that were rubbed into the ground over ten years ago. The laughable
dialogue includes, but is in no way limited to, the following
breakdance-era gems:
You can understand my confusion. And here's a sample of an eloquent
soliloquy delivered by the main character, Melvin Smiley (Mark Wahlberg,
Boogie Nights) as he ponders his own inadequacies in relation to his two
lady friends:
I can't stand the idear of dose two not likin' me. Der. I said it.
I'll give you a minute to shake the image of Shakespeare that was no
doubt conjured by that delightful snippet of wisdom. Speaking of Billy,
the foil in The Big Hit is pretty much a carbon copy of John Leguizamo's
hilariously over-the-top Tybalt in William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet.
This time, the offender is called Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips, Courage
Under Fire), a badass who unimaginatively mutters "lesbian" at three
women that shun his greasy advances. Ironic because, in real life,
Phillips wife left him for clam-bumper Melissa Etheridge.
Have I forgotten the story? Well, it's about four perfectly chiseled
musclehead hitmen. They work for a crime boss named Paris (Avery Brooks,
Deep Space Nine), who somehow makes tons of green by having these four
dumbbells dispose of rival gang members. They're a slick crew,
consisting of antacid swilling Melvin, plotting Cisco, compulsive
masturbator Crunch Bokeem Woodbine, Caught Up) and pretty-boy Vinnie
(Antonio Sabato, Jr.). They decide to earn some extra cash by
moonlighting, but their first job involves unknowingly kidnapping
catholic school student Keiko Nishi (China Chow), the daughter of a
wealthy Japanese businessman and more importantly, the goddaughter of
Paris.
In addition to accidentally pissing off their boss, what these four
goons don't also realize that Keiko's pop has recently lost all of his
money in "a big Horrywood movie" bomb. The repo men haul everything out
of his house after he goes bankrupt, but he is still inexplicably left
with a call-tracing device. Don't even ask.
Directed by Hong Kong action helmer Kirk Wong (Jackie Chan's Crime
Story), the The Big Hit has a terrific opening sequence. The perfectly
choreographed slo-mo gunplay is no doubt inspired by executive producer
John Woo (Face/Off) and brilliantly shot by Danny Nowak (TV's Le Femme
Nikita). The story, from first time screenwriter Ben Ramsey, is pretty
weak and implausibly ends with one of the least understandable chase
scenes ever.
The Big Hit is just like The Wizard of Oz. Melvin is the always worried
Dorothy, Cisco is the yapping Chihuahua Toto while Crunch and
Vinniewell, they both need a brain. And both films start with The.
Proof positive, my friend, proof positive.

Review for Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
What do you get for the man that has everything?  Apparently a mindless
remake.  John McTiernan's (Die Hard) version of the 1968 film starring
Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway falls short of actual amusement and is
even occasionally excruciating  save the brilliant ending that easily
one-ups its predecessor.  Leonard Maltin called the original `perfect
non-think entertainment,' and the remake offers more of the same.
Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) plays Thomas Crown, an art-loving
multimillionaire who spends his time plotting the perfect heist.  Like
the original, most of the film's first half-hour is devoted to the theft
of a valuable painting from a museum (originally just over $2 million,
but here a $100 million Monet). Catherine Banning (Rene Russo, Lethal
Weapon 4) is an insurance agent for the museum and, together with NYPD
detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary, True Crime), immediately suspects
Crown and tries to mount her case against him.  The trouble is that
somewhere along the line, Banning mounts more than her case.
Casting-wise, the suave and debonair Brosnan is a much better choice
than McQueen, but Russo is downright horrible in Dunaway's role.  She
looks awful and acts even worse.  Leary seems lost as the cop and the
film could have used more of his sarcastic spunk.  The score never
really seemed to fit the picture, and viewers will have a hard time
connecting with any of the characters.  Those responsible for the
updated script include Leslie Dixon (the abominable That Old Feeling)
and Kurt Wimmer (Sphere).  Of other note, viewers should now know to be
wary of any film that prominently displays a bowler hat (remember The
Avengers?).
Alan Trustman's original screenplay (he also wrote the superior McQueen
vehicle Bullitt) may have seemed invigorating in 1968, but today seems
as stale as a cardboard pizza with felt pepperoni  especially since we
all recently suffered through a very similar cat-and-mouse chase in
Entrapment.  The original, directed by Norman Jewison (Moonstruck), was
shot by the legendary Haskell Wexler (Limbo) and included the use of
what I like to call Brady Bunch windows  several smaller multi-image
screens that make up the entire frame.  Also look for Dunaway, who plays
Crown's shrink in the updated version.  (1:55 - R for nudity, some
sexuality and language)

Title
Review for Life and Times of Hank Greenberg, The (1998)
There isn't anything surprising in this biography of baseball legend
Hank Greenberg.  There are clips of his illustrious career with the
Detroit Tigers in the 30s and 40s, as well as interviews with
Greenberg, his family, his fans, his teammates, assorted sportswriters,
and even actor Walter Matthau (Hanging Up) and attorney Alan M.
Dershowitz.
What The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg doesn't include is an
interview with my grandfather, who met Greenberg while they both served
in the United States Army during World War II.  My grandfather, who was
a photographer, saluted Greenberg and asked if he could take his picture
for the base or the Post newspaper.  `If you want pictures of me,'
Greenberg growled, `get in contact with the West Coast Training
Command.'  So did my grandfather hold a grudge?  `I hated him from then
on, even though he was a good hitter.'  Did the grudge filter its way
down to my generation?  Of course not, but I will point out that
Greenberg died in 1986 and my grandfather is trying to score tickets to
see Ken Griffey, Jr. play in the Cincinnati Reds spring training camp.
Of course The Life and Times portrays Greenberg in a much rosier light
than my grandfather did.  The lumbering lefty was, after all, the
original Hammerin' Hank.  If you grew up in the Bronx during the 30s or
40s, Greenberg was so admired that people assumed that he would become
the first Jewish President of the United States of America.  His Jewish
fans dubbed the first baseman the Moses of Baseball.  Greenberg wasn't
the first Jewish ballplayer, but he was certainly the best of his day,
if not of all-time.  He was also one of the first to keep his
un-Gentile-sounding name before going professional.  Greenberg's
reluctance to hide his religion became a constant source of pride within
the Jewish community, and the slugger became their biggest role model.
Like Jackie Robinson two decades later, Greenberg endured a barrage of
anti-Semitic taunts from hecklers and from opponents.  During his first
major league season in 1934, he had the added pressure of being on a
team involved in a pennant race that coincided with two major autumn
Jewish holidays.  Faced with a tough decision that pitted his religion
against his beloved game, Greenberg played on Rosh Hoshanah, where he
went yard to win the game, and sat out Yom Kippur, where he received a
standing ovation from his entire congregation.
So did Greenberg really deserve the adulation and faith-induced
scrutiny?  In his first season in the big leagues, all he did was help
the Tigers establish the major league record for most RBI in a season by
an infield and lead them to the World Series, where he narrowly missed
the Series record for RBI.  In the following five seasons, Greenberg
collected two MVP awards (the first man to win at different positions),
won a World Series, missed Babe Ruth's home run record by two dingers
and Lou Gehrig's RBI record by one.  He became the first ballplayer to
volunteer for the war when he enlisted in 1941.  Missing four seasons in
the prime of his career, Greenberg returned to Detroit in 1945, when he
again led the Tigers to another world championship.  When he was
unceremoniously traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates the following season,
Greenberg became the game's first $100,000 man.  And somehow he even
found time during all of these accomplishments to piss off my ancestors.
Directed by Aviva Kempner, The Life and Times also includes clips of an
interview with former Law & Order actor Michael Moriarty, whose
grandfather was an American League umpire during Greenberg's reign of
terror.  The film opens and closes with the Marx Brothers singing `Take
Me Out to the Ballgame' in Yiddish.  And how could you resist something
like that?

Review for Playing by Heart (1998)
In the opening scene of Playing By Heart (**), one character tells the
story of a musician friend that once profoundly said, `Talking about
love is like dancing about architecture.'  The next two hours, which are
totally devoted to talking about love, are more like having an Acme safe
repeatedly dropped on your head.
Like a Robert Altman film, Heart's story is compromised of several
vignettes about seemingly unrelated people that all end up being
connected in some way as the picture ends.  The trouble is that
writer/director Willard Carroll is not Robert Altman.  Instead, he has
created some of the most annoying characters this side of Hurlyburly.
Everyone is a whiny, shallow mope, which, despite the fantastic cast,
makes it hard to sympathize with even one of them.
Here's a quick breakdown of the losers:
Paul (Sean Connery)  an annoying old codger with a brain tumor who is
about to celebrate his 40th wedding anniversary to
Hannah (Gena Rowlands)  Paul's annoying wife who still can't shake the
idea that her husband had an affair 25 years ago.
Gracie (Madeline Stowe)  an annoying hussy that cheats on her husband
with
Roger (Anthony Edwards)  an annoying guy who feels guilty about
cheating on his wife.
Trent (Jon Stewart)  an annoying but successful architect that falls
for
Meredith (Gillian Anderson)  an annoying divorcee who lost her husband
to another man.
Keenan (Ryan Phillippe)  an annoying blue-headed shy club-hopper that
finds himself inexplicably pursued by
Joan (Angelina Jolie)  an annoying aspiring actress that can't seem to
shut up.
Hugh (Dennis Quaid)  an annoying drunk that tries to seduce Patricia
Clarkson, Nastassja Kinski and a drag queen with three different lies.
Mildred (Ellen Burstyn)  an annoying mother that has just traveled
across the country to see her son
Mark (Jay Mohr)  an annoying bedridden guy that is dying of AIDS.
Okay, they aren't all that annoying, but I'm not too far off.  Jolie is
actually very good as the peppy Joan (she was honored by the National
Society of Film Critics for this role) and Phillippe shows some actual
depth and range after his summer debacle 54 (which I thought may have
been his I.Q. before seeing him in this film).
I don't know if this applies to everyone, but I found myself able to
relate only to characters that were close to my age (somewhere between
Keenan/Joan and Trent/Meredith, but closer to the former than the
latter).  But once the focus shifted to the older folks, my focus
shifted to the insides of my eyelids.

Review for From Hell (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success, whether they're
about superheroes (Batman, Superman, Spawn), or geared toward kids (Casper)
or the arthouse crowd (Ghost World), but there's never really been a comic
book like From Hell before.  For starters, it was created by Alan Moore (and
Eddie Campbell), who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s
with a 12-part series called The Watchmen.  To say Moore and Campbell
thoroughly researched the subject of Jack the Ripper would be like saying
Michael Jackson is starting to look a little odd.  The book (or "graphic
novel," if you will) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that
consist of nothing but footnotes.  In other words, don't dismiss this film
because of its source.
If you can get past the whole comic book thing, you might find another
stumbling block in From Hell's directors, Albert and Allen Hughes.  Getting
the Hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting
Carrot Top in, well, anything, but riddle me this:  Who better to direct a
film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than
the mad geniuses behind Menace II Society?  The ghetto in question is, of
course, Whitechapel in 1888 London's East End.  It's a filthy, sooty place
where the whores (called "unfortunates") are starting to get a little
nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their
profession with surgical precision.
When the first stiff turns up, copper Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane, The
World is Not Enough) calls in Inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp,
Blow) to crack the case.  Abberline, a widower, has prophetic dreams he
unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium.
Upon arriving in Whitechapel, he befriends an unfortunate named Mary Kelly
(Heather Graham, Say It Isn't So) and proceeds to investigate the horribly
gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach.
I don't think anyone needs to be briefed on Jack the Ripper, so I won't go
into the particulars here, other than to say Moore and Campbell have a
unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the
reasons he chooses to slay.  In the comic, they don't bother cloaking the
identity of the Ripper, but screenwriters Terry Hayes (Vertical Limit) and
Rafael Yglesias (Les Misérables) do a good job of keeping him hidden from
viewers until the very end.  It's funny to watch the locals blindly point
the finger of blame at Jews and Indians because, after all, an Englishman
could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts.  And From Hell's
ending had me whistling the Stonecutters song from The Simpsons for days
("Who holds back the electric car/who made Steve Guttenberg a star?"). Don't
worry - it'll all make sense when you see it.
Now onto From Hell's appearance:  It's certainly dark and bleak enough, and
it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a Tim Burton film than
Planet of the Apes did (at times, it seems like Sleepy Hollow 2).  The print
I saw wasn't completely finished (both color and music had not been
finalized, so no comments about Marilyn Manson), but cinematographer Peter
Deming (Don't Say a Word) ably captures the dreariness of Victorian-era
London and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy
flashbacks in Twin Peaks, even though the violence in the film pales in
comparison to that in the black-and-white comic.  Oscar winner Martin
Childs' (Shakespeare in Love) production design turns the original Prague
surroundings into one creepy place.
Even the acting in From Hell is solid, with the dreamy Depp turning in a
typically strong performance and deftly handling a British accent.  Ians
Holm (Joe Gould's Secret) and Richardson (102 Dalmatians) log in great
supporting roles, but the big surprise here is Graham.  I cringed the first
time she opened her mouth, imagining her attempt at an Irish accent, but it
actually wasn't half bad.  The film, however, is all good.
2:00 - R for strong violence/gore, sexuality, language and drug content

Review for Karakter (1997)
Character starts with a scene that makes no sense. A young man drives a
knife into the desk of an older man, tells him that he's become a lawyer
and walks away. Who is this kid? Why is he so pissed off? And who is the
old guy and why does he just sit there so emotionlessly? Don't worry 
you'll find out all of the answers because the film is told in
flashback.
The young man is Katadreuffe (Van Huet). Arrested for the murder of the
elder gent, Katadreuffe tells his life story to the Rotterdam cops. I
have a feeling that in real life, the cops wouldn't so much want to hear
about your whole life, but this is just pretend, so I digress.
Katadreuffe explains that the old guy is really his father, a powerful
but super-frigid bailiff named Dreverhaven (Decleir). He was born out of
a one-time affair between Dreverhaven and his equally stoney
housekeeper, who decides to raise the baby on her own. Dreverhaven asks
to marry her, but she moves out and even refuses his monthly offer of
cash for over a year.
Raised in both squalor and total silence, young Katadreuffe is
constantly bullied by the other children, who call his mother a whore.
Whore is apparently the same in every language, a fact that makes me
warm inside. Anyway, he turns to his only source of stress release and
education, an English encyclopedia set (complete only through the letter
"T") found hidden away under the stairs. You just know it won't be long
before he starts yanking on his bootstraps.
After an unsuccessful venture as a cigar-store owner, Katadreuffe is
forced into bankruptcy and, as a result, into the town law firm. He
begins to clerk there and finds out that his debt is not owed to the
bank, but to Dreverhaven. Thus sets the catalyst for the competition and
eventual showdown between father and son.
Fedja Van Huet plays Katadreuffe with a touch of Rufus Sewell's
wide-eyed Dark City gaze and a dash of Robert Downey, Jr's Chaplin. The
Dreverhaven character is easily one of the most diabolical and menacing
of recent memory. Even the name conjures images of Keyser Soyze's past.
Set in the early 20's, Character looks and feels like a cross between
Metropolitan and The Hudsucker Proxy, presenting Rotterdam as the most
abysmal place on earth (at least since The Winter Guest). It won the
Academy Award for Best Foreign Film and, get this  actually  deserved
it!

Title
Review for Big Eden (2000)
In the meantime, a Native American named Pike Dexter (Eric Schweig, who was
Daniel Day-Lewis' brother in The Last of the Mohicans), who runs the town's
general store, has developed an attraction to Henry.  Pike is asked to
deliver meals prepared by the Widow Thayer to Henry and Sam, but instead
find fancy recipes online and prepares delicious meals for the two men,
while making his dog eat the Widow's yucky grub.  Pike can't even make eye
contact with Henry, which mistakenly comes off as rude behavior.
Because all of this is happening in an extremely rural Montana town with a
population slightly larger than Mariah Carey's fan base, you'd expect there
to be some kind of anti-gay backlash, but there isn't.  In fact, most of the
citizens of Big Eden bend over backward to help Pike win over Henry (because
it's, like, so obvious Dean matches up better with the town's mayor).  Eden
is nothing more than a small-town gay love triangle with no antagonist and
very little conflict.
Then again, what do I know?  Eden has won oodles of awards from various gay
and lesbian festivals, but also took home the top two trophies at the
Cleveland fest, beating critically praised stuff like Memento, Amores
Perros, With a Friend Like Harry and The Circle.  Aside from the gay angle,
Eden is a formulaic mess.  Besides the breathtaking scenery and another
chance to see Louise Fletcher teamed up with a really tall Indian (a la One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), Eden is only interesting for the fact its star
plays a character that's returning to his hometown...not unlike Gross'
former television co-star Ellen DeGeneres, whose new show is about the same
thing.

Title
Review for Tumbleweeds (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
This delightful indie one-up of Anywhere But Here features better acting
leads and a slightly meatier, more realistic story.  Like the Susan
Sarandon/Natalie Portman vehicle, Tumbleweeds features a single mother
and her teenage daughter leaving a small rural town to find their
fortune in Southern California.  They even pick furniture out of rich
folks' trash, too.
In Anywhere, the Augusts' departure from Bay City, Wisconsin was a
well-planned move about which friends and family knew.  In Tumbleweeds,
the Walkers' move from West Virginia literally happens in the middle of
the night.  Mother Mary Jo (Janet McTeer, Wuthering Heights) has a
knock-down/drag-out her current boyfriend while screaming for asthmatic
daughter Ava (Kimberly J. Brown, The Guiding Light) to pack up her
things.  No stranger to midnight uprooting, Ava quickly stuffs her
belongings into a bag and the duo hit the road in a car with both broken
head and taillights.
Although she seems a bit scatterbrained, Mary Jo has a plan.  An old
high school sweetheart in Missouri (or `Misery,' according to Ava) with
an automobile dealership has extended an open invitation to Mary Jo, who
envisions a better life of lavish extravagance and new cars.  But things
don't work out quite as nicely as she planned, so Mary Jo and Ava take
off again, aiming their beat-up vehicle towards the Golden State.  Ava
wants to head for San Diego, which they do despite Mary Jo's fears that
it will fall into the ocean.
Mary Jo has a pattern of bailing instantly at the first sign of failure,
leaving a trail of bad jobs and awful relationships with pathetic men.
She is also the type that falls in love with anyone that makes eye
contact with her.  Her intentions are good but not always well thought
through, as Mary Jo often puts her daughter's life secondary to her own
affairs of the heart.
With a mother as crazy Mary Jo, Ava seems even more jaded and discontent
than Anywhere's princess-y Portman, which makes her character than much
more effective and sympathetic.  She seeks stability and a father
figure, wanting to stay in one place long enough to establish roots in
school and develop normal relationships with her peers.  Ava's greatest
fear is that Mom will want to book town before her big role in the
school's production of Romeo & Juliet.
Written and directed by Gavin O'Connor (Comfortably Numb), Tumbleweeds
offers a glut of wacky characters, from Mary Jo's perverted boss to her
quirky co-worker that enjoys coffee enemas.  But the film is still a
very touching and very realistic portrayal of a relationship between an
idealistic mother and her levelheaded daughter.  The Tony Award-winning
McTeer is British, which makes her brilliant turn as a Southern belle
who grew up way too quickly all the more impressive.  Her Oscar-worthy
performance is as good as any you will see this year.  The precocious
Brown is nearly as good, creating an extraordinarily convincing
pragmatic character.
1:44 - PG-13 for adult language, adult situations and a scene of
domestic discord

Title
Review for Musíme si pomáhat (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
A recent Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, Divided We Fall is
set in a small town in German-occupied Czechoslovakia during the latter
stages of World War II.  It's based on a true story about hiding a Jewish
man from the Nazis and features characters saying things like "You wouldn't
believe what abnormal times do to normal people," and "There is nowhere dark
enough for us to hide."  From that description, you'd think Divided would be
a drop-dead-serious drama, but director Jan Hrebejk's style and use of music
almost makes light of his characters' various predicaments and close calls.
Parts are very funny, but not over the top like Life is Beautiful.
Divided opens audaciously, introducing the audience to the film's three main
male characters in quick, almost random snippets of their lives (it takes
about six minutes to encapsulate six years).  We first see Jewish warehouse
owner David (Csongor Kassai) and two of his employees - Josef (Bolek
Polívka) and Horst (Jaroslav Dusek) - goofing around in 1937.  Then, two
years later, David takes up residence in Josef's home after the Nazis kick
him out of his giant villa.  Two years after that, David is on the run
again, bidding farewell to Josef and his wife Marie (Anna Sisková) as he
looks for a safer city to call home.  Finally, in 1943, a gaunt,
unhealthy-looking David returns after escaping from a Polish concentration
camp.  David's family has been wiped out by the Nazis, and he has nowhere to
stay.
The opening does an amazing job of showing David (think Will & Grace's Sean
Hayes, only less funny, if that's at all possible), formerly a wealthy,
well-respected member of the community, becoming hunted and despised as he
creeps around in the city's shadows like a stray pet.  He is spotted by
Josef (think a Beetlejuice-era Alec Baldwin), who reluctantly agrees to take
David in, cramming him, Anne Frank-style, into a cramped room smaller than a
prison cell.
To make matters worse, the perpetually nervous Josef (he shits himself in
one scene) and his buddy Horst have taken jobs helping the Nazis impound
property from their Jewish neighbors as they're dragged off to concentration
camps.  If the soldiers ever discovered Josef and Marie here hiding a Jew
right under their noses, the two would be instantly executed.  Horst, who is
much more into the whole Nazi thing, has his suspicions, and frequently
stops by to offer the couple illegal contraband and, occasionally, to hit on
Marie.  And with her husband gone during the day, Marie begins to bond with
the ailing David.
It takes almost 90 minutes to get to the payoff in Divided, and when it
happens, it's pretty uncomfortable and finds the middle ground between
comedy and genocide.  Along the way, there's drama (including the most
graphic rabbit-skinning since Roger & Me) and comedy (including a scene
where Horst tries to teach Josef how to keep a relaxed, expressionless face
like a Nazi).  There are a dozen different ways it could end, and 11 of them
are tragic.  Just when you think you've got it all figured out, Petr
Jarchovsky's script throws Option 13 at you.  The film is based on his
novel, but he actually wrote the screenplay first and later decided to make
it into a book because he couldn't afford the movie route.
Divided is, at times, hauntingly photographed by Jan Malir who, along with
Hrebejk, expertly manipulates the frames-per-second rate of some of the
film's more intense scenes.  The result is a deliciously dark composition
that isn't seen much outside of Nine Inch Nails music videos.  It also
appeared that Hrbejk (who never played first base for the Twins)
superimposed Marie's face over that of the Virgin Mother in a portrait
hanging in the couple's living room.  A nice touch by a promising director.
1:57 - PG-13 for some violence and sexual content

Title
Review for Dinosaur (2000)
Disney's annual kiddie-pic summer extravaganzas are usually pretty sure
things box-office-wise, but Dinosaur is a whole different story.  First,
the Mouse House bumped up its customary mid-June release date for the
weekend before Memorial Day.  Then they hired a screenwriter with an
extensive background in horror films to pen the story, which has
resulted in Dinosaur nabbing an un-Disney-esque `PG' rating (the same as
Woody Allen's film, which is being released the same day).  Oh, and
there's also the little issue of recouping the money it cost to make the
film, which has been rumored to be in the $150-200 million range (it
cost $80 million just to build the facility where the film was created).
Kids, of course, don't give a flying fig about a film's price tag.  What
they do care about is seeing cute, cuddly creatures with funny voices
and promotional tie-ins at fast-food chains and toys that they can get
their parents to buy simply by threatening to hold their breath until
they turn blue.  And I'm just not sure that Dinosaur is that film.  Like
Antz, the creatures in this film are downright unattractive, and if
Dinosaur pulls in numbers much higher than its CG animated predecessor,
you will literally be able to see heads rolling down South Buena Vista
Street.
Dinosaur begins with the breathtaking ten-minute minute journey of an
Iguanodon egg from its mother's nest to a tree inhabited by a tribe of
lemurs.  There's no dialogue for this segment of the film, which makes
it even more appealing as viewers will be able to fully concentrate on
the computer-generated creatures inserted over real backgrounds.  But
once the egg hatches, the ugly things start talking.  The head lemur,
Yar (Ossie Davis, Doctor Dolittle), sees the baby Aladar as a dangerous,
cold-blooded monster, but he eventually decides to raise him like a son.
Flash forward several years, where Aladar (D.B. Sweeney, Fox's cancelled
Harsh Realm) is now several times larger than even the largest lemur. He
watches sadly as the boy primates and girl primates practice mating
rituals, fully knowing that he'll never find one of his own to fall in
love with.  Then a meteor hits, and the world bursts into flames,
leaving Aladar and the surviving lemurs to flee through a Nam-like
flaming jungle, where they run into a herd of various plant-eating
dinosaurs looking for a new nesting ground.
Although Aladar has never even seen another dinosaur, he gets to
experience the full gamut of dealing with his own species, from
bureaucracy (butting heads with militaristic head dinosaur Kron), to
love (Kron's sister Neera [Julianna Margulies, ER]), to pity (by helping
older, slower dinosaurs Eema [Della Reese, Touched By An Angel] and
Baylene [Joan Plowright, Tea With Mussolini]), to fear (being stalked by
two blood-thirsty Carnotaurs).
Dinosaur will be way too scary for some young kids (several were howling
during my screening, and many families left early).  Maybe Disney
thought that the whole running-through-the-burning-forest thing would be
okay because they already did it in Bambi.  But here, it's more like
Hell on Earth.  And the Carnotaurs are a little too much.  Dinosaur was
co-directed by Ralph Zondag (We're Back!  A Dinosaur's Story) and
first-timer Eric Leighton, who previously worked as an animator on the
creepy films James & the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before
Christmas.  The script was co-written by Robert Nelson Jacobs (Out to
Sea) and John Harrison, who is best known for his work in the horror
industry (Tales From the Crypt, Creepshow).
Thanks to the cost of producing a CG film, Dinosaur clocks in at a lean
eighty-two minutes and offers no superfluous plot.  The voice work is
merely adequate, with Marguiles, Sweeney and Alfre Woodard (Love &
Basketball) particularly unstriking.

Review for My Generation (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Barbara Kopple, the two-time Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker who most
recently directed Woody Allen's Wild Man Blues, gives us a striking look at
the three Woodstock festivals in My Generation.  Originally meant to be a
comparison between the 1969 and 1994 concerts, Kopple didn't need to wait
long for the 1999 fiasco to provide an apocalyptic end to her picture.
The fun starts in February 1994 and shows the behind-the-scenes genesis of
the 25th anniversary show, from the Saugerties town meeting to get the
permit (set to Primus' "Here Come the Bastards") to the merchandising
efforts to provide consumers with everything from Woodstock condoms to
Woodstock dog tags. There are nice segues between people proudly stating
that "it isn't about the money" and giant, baby-killing corporate sponsors
selling $20 slices of pizza.
There are some truly interesting musical moments in Generation, like when
Kopple cuts between Joe Cocker's performance in 1969 and 1994, or Melissa
Etheridge's Janis Joplin cover in '94 juxtaposed with a clip of Joplin from
the original concert.  The 30th anniversary show in 1999 showed the
difference between quietly raging against the machine and the misguided,
fire-stoking anger of Limp Bizkit's "Break Stuff," as three days of peace,
music and love turned into three days of fire, rape and looting.
A big chunk of the film focuses on Michael Lang, the perpetually calm
producer of all three events.  Nothing seems to faze the guy, even though he
claims the original Woodstock concert has just broken even within the last
few years (which is why you had to be bombarded with Pepsi advertising just
to see DMX).  There isn't one mention of the rapes in '99 but plenty of
coverage of various security check problems (people weren't told metal tents
weren't allowed until they were at the gate), drugs, injuries and, of
course, mud.
If anything, the film is a great way to catch a wide variety of music from
the likes of Green Day, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails, The Who, Country Joe and
the Fish and a pre-pop-chart Santana.

Title
Review for Moulin Rouge! (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Stop me if you've heard this one before:  A high-profile Scientologist opens
a brand-new, hype-heavy film in May and the stupid thing hits the ground
with an unimpressive thud that leaves many people snickering at the
absurdity of it all.  While Moulin Rouge isn't anywhere near as awful as
Battlefield Earth, it probably is the biggest, loudest, flashiest, most
expensive dud since the John Travolta debacle of 2000.  It's a full-out
assault on the senses (and, in some cases, the taste); like an intricately
wrapped present that, upon opening, reveals nothing but a box full of
brightly colored tissue paper (and maybe a handful of glitter and confetti,
too).
I like many different types of film and just as many types of music, but for
some reason blending the two creative forms doesn't do a thing for me.  I'd
sooner gnaw off my own leg than sit through anything with Fred Astaire or
Judy Garland.  Aside from Jane Horrocks' work in Little Voice, that cool
scene from Magnolia where the characters sing along to the Aimee Mann song,
and Woody Allen's musical comedy Everyone Says I Love You, the whole movie
musical thing just seems like a waste of time and energy.
It's kind of ironic that Rouge has connections to the last two grand-scale
musicals to hit the screen (and, no, I'm not counting Duets).  One of the
film's big musical numbers is set to Madonna's "Like a Virgin" (she starred
in Evita), and Jim Broadbent, who played William Shwenk Gilbert in
Topsy-Turvy, stars here as Zidler, the owner of a club called Moulin Rouge
in the Bohemian section of turn-of-the-20th-century Paris.  Broadbent played
a similar role in Little Voice, which also featured another of Rouge's
stars - Ewan McGregor (The Phantom Menace), here playing an Englishman named
Christian who has just moved to Paris in pursuit of a writing career.  The
entire film is shown in one long flashback as we watch the bearded,
disheveled writer (who looks a lot like Kenneth Branagh) peck away at his
typewriter as he slowly relates his story of love and loss.
Upon his arrival in Paris, Christian is quite accidentally befriended by a
group of zany performers (led by John Leguizamo, who still has some of that
clown makeup from Spawn crusted onto his face) who are trying to put on
their own musical called "Spectacular Spectacular."  Unfortunately, they
have no funding and their story kind of stinks.  Enter Christian, who is
able to jazz up both the script and music, and, through a Three's
Company-like mix-up, lands the financial support of the wealthy Duke of
Worcester (Richard Roxburgh, Mission: Impossible 2).
The trouble is that the Duke and Christian are after the same girl - a
courtesan from the Moulin Rouge named Satine (Nicole Kidman, Eyes Wide
Shut), who happens to be the star of the play.  The story, which has now
evolved into the tale of a woman torn between the love of a penniless writer
and the wealth of an aristocrat, has begun to parallel the real goings-on
between Satine, Christian and the Duke.  Then the sparks begin to fly.
It's quite a simple story, but the whole thing is jazzed up with
song-and-dance numbers set to popular music, like Bowie, Nirvana, Queen and
the Police.  As soon as any of the characters open their mouths to sing,
Rouge becomes a mass version of Name That Tune and, brother, if you've never
heard the person sitting behind you belt out an Elton John tune in their own
little personal duet with Mr. McGregor, I envy you.  God, do I envy you.
Writer/director Baz Luhrmann, the guy responsible for the pretentious radio
hit "Everybody's Free to Wear Sunscreen," is certainly no stranger to
dancing (Strictly Ballroom) or manipulating the setting of a film (William
Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet).  There's a Pavement tune in which Stephen
Malkmus warbles that he's "got style for miles and miles; so much style that
it's wasted."  Luhrmann has a similar amount of talent, and he packs as much
of it as he can into Rouge.  The trouble is that it's just too much of a
good thing, leaving the film to literally burst at the seams with panache.
It's like when one of those tubes of Pillsbury biscuits busts open before
you're ready to use it - one big frigging mess.
Rouge could have been edited by a crack-addicted ferret with ADD who just
downed a half-dozen Pixie Stix.  It makes Armageddon look like The Thin Red
Line.  The film is exhaustive when it should have been exhilarating, and I
think Kidman was lucky to escape production with only a fractured rib and a
damaged knee.  Watching Rouge is like taking a beating; it's as garish as
the home-decorating skills of a mobster's wife.  Something this overwhelming
is better suited for a music video, or a television commercial, but
definitely not a 130-minute film.
Rouge's singing, which was all done by the acting talent involved, is
impressive, as is most of the technical package, which could see some
activity at Oscar time.  Kidman starts off as an annoying 85-pound Chihuahua
but gets a bit more likeable as the film progresses.  McGregor does well and
his Christian marks his first role where he hasn't whipped out his piece or
a light saber.  But anything with Leguizamo is an automatic -2 on the Planet
Sick-Boy rating system.

Title
Review for Hope Floats (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
In Waiting to Exhale, his previous directorial effort, Forest Whitaker
struck a chord with female audiences and elicited millions of `You Go
Girl!' interjections by showing a revengeful Angela Bassett torching her
cheating husband's personal belongings.  Not more than ten minutes into
Hope Floats, Sandra Bullock is cutting up her ex's dress shirts.  I
guess these revenge scenes must score through the roof with test
audiences.
Bullock plays Birdee Pruitt, who in the opening scene finds out that her
high school sweetheart/husband has been tupping her best friend for over
a year.  Tail between her legs, Birdee scurries back home to her
ancestral birthplace with daughter Bernice in tow.  The two runaways
shack up with Mom (Gena Rowlands) in Smithville, home of Birdee's glory
years.
In her heyday, Birdee was everything I despise  beautiful, popular, a
cheerleader and something called `The Queen of Corn'.  This apparently
means something completely different is Smithville than it did where I
grew up (see `Back Door Beauty' in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas).
Post-separation, life finds Birdee on the low side of life's Sine
curve.  She sleeps all day, never leaves the house and seems confined to
ratty bathrobes.  Like any woman, she runs cold-hot-cold-hot toward her
family and her potential suitors.  As an added flaw, Birdee also appears
as motherly as a jar of angry scorpions, but I think that's just because
of the amazing acting stylings of Ms. Bullock.  I mean, what does this
girl do after headlining two of the biggest bombs (Speed 2:Cruise
Control and Two If by Sea) of recent memory?  She stars and executive
produces this bothersome bore of a picture. Plus, in Hope Floats she
delivers her best lines into the toilet during an implied vomiting
scene.  Implied vomiting  do us a favor and show the phlegmy stew-like
chunks, for Christ's sake.  Up next for Bullock, a remake of Pillow Talk
with Carrot Top in the male lead.  Way to go Sandra!
More disturbing than Bullock is musician-turned-actor Harry Connick, Jr.
as Justin Matisse, the boy who has always loved Birdee but was too shy
to tell her how he really felt in high school.  Is it just me or is this
guy horribly disfigured?  It looks like someone shot him face-first out
of a cannon into a cement wall.  Do women actually find him attractive?
It seems to me that he could just snap at any second and turn into his
character in Copycat.  His acting style and accent remind me of Spike
Lee, and that ain't good, G.
And don't get me started on the stupid kid.  Can there be movie like
this without the token Jonathan Lipnicki character?  Sweet fancy Moses,
I can't take it anymore.  Is one original thought or idea too much to
ask for?
At the end of the picture, Birdee explains to her daughter that every
story has a difficult beginning and a sad end, but it's the middle that
counts.  Ironic since the middle of Hope Floats made my eyes roll back
into my skull.  Then Birdee said that hope always floats to the top, not
unlike a rancid turd in the festering bowl of conventional romance
pics.  FYI - if you have trouble getting it down, the trick is to cover
it up with toilet paper and then flush it.

Review for Scary Movie (2000)
Making a film that's a spoof of an entire movie genre is kind of a
strange proposal. They say that imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery, and even though Mel Brooks has built a pretty successful
career out of sending up westerns, space adventures and (unfortunately)
vampire flicks, the whole idea of the genre parody doesn't seem much
different than Beavis, Butt-Head, Tom Servo or Crow tearing movies apart
in their living rooms.
But what about a movie that spoofs a movie that spoofed a genre? That's
what we have with Scary Movie, the latest collaboration from the
brothers Wayans. They've already lampooned blaxploitation flicks (I'm
Gonna Git You Sucka!) and gangsta films (Don't Be a Menace to South
Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood), and here they satirize
the Scream trilogy, among other horror films. Even its title is taken
from the one that Scream abandoned.
Scary Movie begins with Carmen Electra (Hyperion Bay) making popcorn and
receiving a phone call from a masked killer, a la Drew Barrymore's
memorable opening scene in the first Scream picture. The story is more
than a little familiar  knife-wielding lunatic begins slashing his way
through a small clique of friends and is pursued by a soulless news
reporter (Cheri Oteri, Saturday Night Live) and a retarded deputy (Dave
Sheridan, MTV's short-lived Buzzkill). Even the school principal is
played by a down-and-out 70s television sitcom star (Henry `The Fonz'
Winkler in Scream, and David `Squiggy' Lander here).
It isn't long before Scary Movie moves from Scream to I Know What You
Did Last Summer. After a funny automobile accident involving oral sex
and a beehive (don't ask) that occurred exactly one year ago, the band
of boobs starts receiving notes that threaten to expose their big
secret. While they're at it, the Wayans also toss in a scene right from
Dawson's Creek, a show that was created by Scream and IKWYDLS
screenwriter Kevin Williamson.
There isn't really too much else to say about Scary Movie without giving
away a lot of its gags. Some of the jokes fall flat, but most are direct
hits. In addition to sending up the two recent horror hits, the film
also briefly tackles The Matrix, The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth
Sense. There are also unexpected homages to Amistad and The Usual
Suspects (the latter seemed to go over the head of just about everyone
in the theatre), and a sick, X-rated version of Johnny Depp's death
scene in A Nightmare on Elm Street.
Scary Movie was directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (A Lowdown Dirty Shame)
and its script was cobbled together by no less than six screenwriters.
Originally, the film's production was supposed to take just a few weeks
at the end of the summer of 1999 and slated for a fall release. But then
the Wayans' script (originally titled Last Summer I Screamed Because
Halloween Fell On Friday the 13th) merged with a similar project that
spoofed horror pictures (called Scream If You Know What I Did Last
Halloween), and the production was stretched out long enough for the
film to include a parody of the `Wassup' Budweiser commercials.

Review for Onegin (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
As cold and dull as a Russian winter, Onegin aims to please only the
snootiest of film-lovers.  Set to make its major debut on the Starz
television network (after a pointless one-week, Oscar-qualifying run in
New York and Los Angeles), the film stars Ralph Fiennes (The Avengers)
and is directed by his sister Martha and scored by his brother Magnus.
Magnusand you though Ralph was a pretentious name.
Based on Alexander Pushkin's lengthy 1823 poem, Onegin takes place in
Russia during the early part of the 1800s.  Fiennes plays the titular
Yevgeny Onegin, a St. Petersburg playboy that inherits the entire estate
of his wealthy uncle.  Onegin appears as bored with his life as I was
watching it.  He has his pick of women and takes pride in showing other
men how easily he can steal their wives and fiancées.  One woman who
pours her heart out to him - Tatyana Larina (Liv Tyler, Plunkett &
Macleane) - is quickly and tactlessly rejected by the smarmy Onegin.
After a victory in a cool pistol duel (which, ironically, is how Pushkin
died in 1837) and a six-year vacation, Onegin returns to St. Petersburg
ready to profess his love to Tatyana.  But, of course, he's too late 
Tatyana has married.  The story may have seemed fresh back in 1823, but
it's a real yawner today.  Onegin was actually filmed twice before, in
1911 as a silent Russian short and in 1959 as a Russian feature, but is
probably best known in this country as a Tchaikovsky overture.
Fiennes is perfectly cast as the frosty Onegin.  He shows as much range
and emotion as Walt Disney, but that's the fault of the role more than
the actor (I think).  An Oscar nominee last year, Remi Adefarasin
provides chilly camera work and has now had the pleasure of working with
four of the Fiennes (sibling Joseph dulled up the joint in Elizabeth).
Poor Remi probably had to be talked down off of the roof after this one,
muttering that `Ralph' is supposed to be pronounced with the `L.'
They say that a decent English translation of Pushkin's poem has never
existed and Onegin does nothing but perpetuate the myth.  Plus, I can't
stop thinking of Robert DeNiro's Rupert Pupkin (from The King of Comedy)
whenever I see that name.  And don't get me started on  the name
Yevgeny, which sounds like `F. Genni.'  Whose Genni?  I don't know, but
`F' him.  It's almost as dumb as `Raif.'
Thankfully, the film is short for a stuffy period piece.  If you take
out the obligatory dancing scenes, you would be left with a half-hour
movie.  And that wouldn't be such a bad thing.  Onegin fails where last
year's family affair This is My Father  with Aidan, Paul and Declan
Quinn contributing to the production  succeeded.  Father was like a
bright, warm ball of ligh,t while Onegin is a bitter, cold shard of ice.

Review for Krippendorf's Tribe (1998)
Krippendorf's Tribe.  A movie about a guy who lies about stuff to get
free money.  It sounds like the plot for the new Pauly Shore movie (and
who decided to stop letting him make films?).  Unfortunately, it's the
latest vehicle for Richard Dreyfuss (Mr. Holland's Opus), who either
doesn't read his scripts anymore or saw Ace Ventura 2: When Nature
Callsand really really liked it.
Dreyfuss stars as James Krippendorf, a chaotic unkempt archeology
professor at an unnamed university.  As the film opens, we finds James
nodding off while watching home videos of a New Guinea trip that he took
with his wife and children.  It seems that he and his wife, who was also
an archeology professor, were in search of a `lost tribe' that has never
had contact with outsiders.  I remember reading about a tribe like this
in the seventh grade, and I was just as frigging bored then, too.
James wakes up from his flashback to a filthy cluttered home he shares
with his three kids.  Apparently, his wife has died and James has used
the grant money they had earned to keep the family afloat financially.
Talk about a great role model for all of those current (and future)
single fathers out there.
Things begin to spin out of control when Veronica (Elfman, Dharma &
Greg), an adoring former student who is now a new professor at the
university, pops in to remind James about his big lecture on the lost
tribe.  Big lecture!  Oh, no.  James has forgotten all about it and is
completely unprepared.  The humanity of it all!
Now, your average person in this situation might fib a little bit to get
out of a jam and hope that the problem just goes away, but not our
James.  He not only confirms his contact with the lost tribe, but also
makes up facts that are so astounding that he effectively turns the
archeological community on its collective ear.
Igniting the public's interest with his marvelous story, James is
pressured to produce video of the tribe.  Again, the average person
would probably be able to quickly sidestep this issue, but not our
James.  He actually decorates his back yard and dresses his kids up to
film a faux version of his fantasy tribe.  The tape generates more
excitement and James must make more phony tapes to quell the teaming
masses.
The ensuing scenes are predictable and, for the most part, boring.
James does get to dry hump his Father-in-law (Tom Poston, Newhart) while
dressed as the leader of the tribe.  Oh, yeah, and he somehow cons a
drunken Veronica into face paint and shags her rotten while filming the
entire event as a tribal mating ritual.  And there is a scene at the end
when James and Veronica have to keep switching in and out of the
tribesman costume that is very reminiscent of The Brady Bunch Halloween
episode where Peter has two dates and one thinks he's Frankenstein and
the other thinks thatoh, just forget it.
Dreyfuss tries to be hilariously over-the-top (as in Jim Carrey) and
Elfman seems wasted in an underdeveloped role.  The kids, led by Natasha
Lyonne (Everyone Says I Love You), are a predictable bunch: the eldest
is the mother figure, the middle one wants a dog and the youngest hasn't
spoken since Mom died.  And we never find out why she died either.  I
expected more from Todd Holland, who also directs the outstanding HBO
series, The Larry Sanders Show.
The truly amazing feat is that these archaeological experts are so
easily duped.  James would have needed an eight-camera shoot to pull off
the video that he presented to them.  They somehow don't seem to grasp
the idea of film editing.  Wrap that up with an ending so implausible
that it actually gave me diarrhea, and you've got yourself one fine
picture.

Title
Review for Agnes Browne (1999)
Anjelica Huston's directorial debut, Bastard Out of Carolina, was a
devastating portrayal of child abuse in a poor Southern family.  The
film was so powerful that it either turned your stomach or pissed you
off, and in some cases both.  In contrast, Huston's second film, Agnes
Browne, is devastatingly mediocre.  It didn't quite turn my stomach, but
it did piss me off a little.
Unlike Carolina, Huston (Buffalo '66) tackles duties both in front of
and behind the camera, casting herself in the titular role.  Here she
plays the dirt-poor widow of a late hotel kitchen employee with seven
children in 1967 Dublin.  She can't afford to bury her recently deceased
husband and borrows forty pounds from a loan shark named Mr. Billy (Ray
Winstone, The War Zone), agreeing to pay two pounds a week in interest.
With her only viable source of income coming from the operation of a
fruit and vegetable stand, Agnes can barely afford to feed her flock,
let alone cough up Mr. Billy's interest.
The oldest Browne child is Mark (Niall O'Shea), who wants to drop out of
school to help his mom put food on the table.  Brother Frankie (Ciaran
Owens) develops a taste for gambling, while Agnes' best friend Marion
Monks (Marion O'Dwyer) develops a lump in her chest.  Agnes also gets an
admirer in the form of Pierre (Arno Chevrier  think of a cross between
Gerard Depardieu and `Stuttering John' Melendez), a French entrepreneur
opening a bakery near her produce cart.  Throw a Tom Jones concert in
the mix and, well, you get a pretty jumbled story.
That's the main problem with Browne.  The film is based on the Brendan
O'Carroll novel `The Mammy,' which was, in turn, based on an old serial
radio program.  Browne is simply five or six scripts from the radio show
scrambled together, which makes the ending seem particularly silly,
since all of the plots are neatly tied up with (mostly) positive
resolutions across the board.  It shouldn't  they're still impoverished
and have no solid income.  Try not to giggle when Agnes proudly states
to her children, `We're the Brownes; we stick together.'
Browne certainly isn't a total waste of time.  There are highlights 
Mr. Browne's funeral procession is comical, while Marion's conclusion
that the lump in her breast is the result of having her first `organism'
is downright hysterical.  The acting is decent all-around, with Huston's
effective Irish brogue a high point (she grew up in Ireland).  Browne is
a colorful picture, but the slight film just doesn't seem to be able to
get off of the ground.

Title
Review for Mod Squad, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:   http://www.sick-boy.com
Here's a way to tell if a movie is really bad:  Take a peek at your
watch when the credits start to roll.  If it's exactly 90 minutes from
the time the lights went down, odds are you just suffered through a real
stinker.  Why?  Because the director probably delivered a 120-minute
opus to the studio, who immediately recognized it for the piece of dung
that it was, slapped the director silly and hacked it down to a
viewer-friendly run time.  Another way to tell is if somebody sitting
next to you keeps saying, `My, God.  I wish I was dead!'  That's how the
person sitting next to me was tipped off to the fact that it blew.
Riding the wave of the retro fad, the popular 70s television series
bullies its way into theaters with a lethal blend of bad acting,
scripting and directing.  In case you're too young to remember the show,
it was about three teen delinquents who, for some reason, became
undercover cops that fought both crime and fashion ideologies.  There's
Linc (Omar Epps, Higher Learning), a former arsonist that seems more
concerned with his ride than anything else.  There's Julie (Claire
Danes, My So-Called Life), a recovering alcoholic convicted of assault.
And there's Pete (Giovanni Ribisi, The Other Sister), a dimwitted
burglar and spawn of the hostile suburbs.  Three fenceposts could have
been more effective.  Did I mention that they weren't allowed to carry
guns?  That's right  an action movie nearly devoid of delicious
gunplay.  That's sort of like drinking a can of Coke that's been open
for three months.
There are two scenes that I particularly enjoyed.  One occurred when the
three idiots were working undercover in a sex club.  Communicating only
with a series of secret winks and hand gestures, they delve deeply into
their undercover identities, being careful to make sure that nobody
believes either that they're cops or that they know each other.  Then
they all go home in the same car.  In another dazzling display, Linc has
to don a disguise to go incognito when on the run from some crooked
detectives, so he puts on a hat.  A hat.  That's his disguise.
The Mod Squad is sort of like The Brady Bunch movies  everyone else
dresses and acts like they're living in the present day, but the stars
dress like disco is still king.  They use hip lingo like `solid' and
`right on,' and whenever something really exciting happens  and believe
me, these moments are few and far between  the music awkwardly shifts
from 90s modern rock to 70s deep funk.  You know, Shaft stuff.  The
film has the look of a Levi's button-fly loose-fitting wide-legged
baggy-crotch jeans commercial  all edgy and alternative.  And if you
can't get enough of Giovanni Ribisi playing that semi-retarded role
(like Friends), then this is the picture for you.  The rest of you
should just stay away.

Review for Todo sobre mi madre (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
It seems to be an annual tradition this time of year.  I'm not talking
about Christmas shopping or trimming the tree or even packing yourself
full of turkey and pie.  The custom I refer to is that of heaping oodles
of undeserving praise on a small, independent foreign film.  Last year,
it was the Brazilian festival fave Central Station, which nabbed two
Oscar nominations (for Best Actress and Best Foreign Film).  This year,
it's Pedro Almodóvar's All About My Mother.
Don't get me wrong  it's not a bad movie at all.  In fact, it's better
than Central Station.  But a Best Director win at Cannes?  Two European
Film Award nominations (Picture and Actress)?  And five-star review
after five-star review?  I just don't get it.  I would have to use two
hands to count the number of superior films in competition at Cannes.
Better than Kikujiro?  Not a chance in hell.  Among other favorites,
Almodóvar beat David Lynch, Peter Greenaway, Jim Jarmusch, Atom Egoyan,
John Sayles, Michael Winterbottom and Tim Robbins for the Best Director
award.
The film centers around a woman in her late thirties named Manuela
(Cecilia Roth  think Deborah Kara Unger in about ten years).  She's a
hospital nurse and single mom with a seventeen-year-old son named
Esteban (Eloy Azorín) who dreams of becoming a writer.  As the picture
opens, Manuela and Esteban watch a dubbed version of All About Eve,
discussing the translation of its title into Spanish (so you'll be
watching English subtitles of an American film dubbed in Spanish  oy
vey!).  For Esteban's birthday, the two take in a stage performance of A
Streetcar Named Desire, but he is killed in an accident trying to get an
autograph after the show.
This is where Almodóvar (Live Flesh) shines, tactfully blending scenes
from both Eve and the stage version of Streetcar to underscore the
emotion of his characters.  Add to that a nifty ironic twist early on
involving organ donation that I won't reveal here, even though I've
heard he used a similar theme in The Flower of My Secret (which I've
never seen).  The use of Streetcar is serendipitous as Manuela actually
played Stella several years ago in a Barcelona production, opposite a
Kowalski that became Esteban's father.  She always told her son that his
father died before he was born but in reality, Manuela took off for
Madrid, pregnant with Esteban and neglecting to tell the father.
All About My Mother, an obvious homage to the title of All About Eve, is
basically the story of Manuela's attempt to track down the father of her
child in Barcelona, reversing her journey from seventeen years ago.  She
meets many zany characters along the way, including a pregnant nun
(Penélope Cruz), a transsexual (Antonia San Juan), a junkie (Candela
Peńa) and an actress (Marisa Paredes).  Each woman helps to demonstrate
a powerful quote from the film - `Women will do anything to avoid being
alone.'
Mother, like other Almodóvar films, is a non-stop visual assault of
bright, beautiful colors (his Live Flesh cinematographer Affonso Beato
is back here).  He's a brilliant director, and his cast is full of
fantastic actresses (namely Roth), but the story isn't all there.  It
plays like a cheesy Spanish soap opera that you might stumble upon
flipping through cable stations.  I have a feeling that guy in the giant
bee costume may be more entertaining. Alberto Iglesias provides the
acoustic-heavy score.
1:45 - R for sexuality including strong sexual dialogue, nudity, adult
language and drug content

Review for Mulan (1998)
Ahhh, finally a big Disney animated film with strong female lead that
doesn't wear buckskin.  I envisioned her fighting for her chance to go
to war with men (ala G.I. Jane) and imagined that perhaps the film might
shatter some stereotypes about women.  I was a little queasy after
hearing the first song, which was all about how looking pretty and
having a small waist will bring both a good husband and honor to your
family.  But it got better.
Mulan is based on a true story about a clumsy young girl who defends her
country by cross-dressing (and, no, it's not the Ed Wood story).  See,
China is under siege by Huns and each family has to send one member to
war.  Rather that see her aging father go to battle, Mulan cuts her
hair, sneaks off in the middle of the night and joins the Chinese army.
Fearing for the safety of Mulan (Ming-Na Wen), her father prays to the
spirits of their ancestors for her safety.  Mistakenly, the ancestors
send Mushu (Eddie Murphy), a pipsqueak dragon that resembles a small
version of Tigger.  Together with a questionably lucky cricket, Mushu
sets off to find and protect Mulan.
Still hiding her female identity, Mulan finds herself inexperienced at
war but quickly learns to play with the boys and eventually wins their
trust.  The picture leads up to a big showdown with the head Hun (Miguel
Ferrer) who has  so help me God  yellow eyes.  I'm not going to tell
you who wins the battle, but I will say that it is Disney-esque.
Murphy steals the show as the voice of Mushu, the best Disney sidekick
in recent memory.  His presence livens things up and gives the picture
and edgier feel, due mostly in part to the possibility of hearing Mushu
call the Huns `a bunch of dirty ass motherhuckers' or telling Mulan
`Damn, Bitch - If you was a boy, I'd like to give you a ride home and
smell your feet'.  He doesn't, but he's still very funny.
Although there is little to complain about (even the songs aren't
totally annoying), the character of the head Hun is under developed and
ineffectively used.  But maybe I'm just spoiled after seeing the lovely
Hades (James Woods) from last summer's Hercules.  There are also a lot
of really awful Chinese stereotypes, but what do you expect from a
Arab-hating fag-bashing multimedia conglomerate?  Oh yeah, expect a huge
backlash from the Hun community.  You may have to cross a picket line to
see this film, but that OK, because good movies come before the
effective portrayal of certain ethnic groups any day.

Review for Recess: School's Out (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
When films that take place during a specific period of time aren't released
theatrically during that same specific period of time, it's usually a bad
sign.  You know, like a movie about Mardi Gras coming out in September.  Or
a film about a dysfunctional family's Thanksgiving dinner that bows in May.
Or Reindeer Games.  The usual scenario is that the finished film sucks, so
release plans are scrapped, expectations are lowered and fingers are crossed
that nobody will notice anything is afoul.
Even though Disney's new animated film, Recess: School's Out, is set during
summer vacation (and being released in February), there still seemed to be
some potential for quality.  The film is based on a (supposedly) popular
Saturday morning cartoon, and its crew reads like a who's who of smart
animated comedies (director Chuck Sheetz has worked on The Simpsons and King
of the Hill, while writers Joe Ansolabehere, Jonathan Greenberg and Paul
Germain have served time on shows like Daria, Rugrats and Duckman).  And
there's a slew of interesting voice talent on board as well.  In theory,
Recess looked promising.
In practice, it's a whole different story.  Recess is as weak as an
asthmatic second-grader with glasses, a cowlick and a retainer, and it packs
the comedic punch of a devastating Third World earthquake.  The film opens
on the last day of classes at the 3rd Street School, where children and
teachers alike are celebrating their impending freedom.  We're introduced to
the school's principal, Vance Prickly (Dabney Coleman); a mean, old teacher
with sharp, kid-eating teeth (April Winchell); and, most importantly,
Recess' six main characters, who make up the typical cross-section of
Anytown, USA.
There's the fat kid (he's going to opera camp - Robert Goulet provides his
singing voice), the black kid (he's headed for baseball camp), the nerdy kid
(space camp) and the runty kid (military camp).  And then there's the
wrestling-camp-bound "other" kid (you know the one - can't tell if it's a
boy or a girl, Asian or Latino, and it wears a hat like Dumb Donald on Fat
Albert).  T.J. (Andy Lawrence), Recess' cool kid, isn't going away to camp
and, in his boredom, stumbles on a completely ludicrous adventure.
It seems that an evil former principal (James Woods), hell-bent on
instituting a worldwide ban on summer vacation, has taken over the school
and plans to knock the moon out of orbit with a giant laser beam.  If that
sentence made sense to you, perhaps your medication is wearing off.  T.J.,
with the help of his hot older sister (Melissa Joan Hart), smuggles his
friends from their various camps to do battle with the maniacal villain.
Will they be able to save the day?  I've got a feeling things will probably
work out, and the madcap finale will somehow involve the unique talent of
each of the six kids.
In what appears to be an attempt to keep bored parents interested, Recess is
packed full of songs from the '60s (including Goulet's bizarre rendition of
The Lemon Pipers' "Green Tambourine"), but, strangely enough, doesn't
include the Alice Cooper standard that shares the same name as the film.
The animation is shoddy, save the cool opening shot of the town that
descends onto the 3rd Street School playground.  Most of the celebrity guest
voices are over before you know what hit you, which will likely cause a lot
of head-scratching when the closing credits finally (and mercifully) begin
to roll. I totally missed people like Diedrich Bader, Dan Castellaneta,
Andrea Martin, Nick Turturro and about ten others.  What's the point of
getting (semi) famous talent to provide voices if nobody is going to notice?
Come to think of it, what's the point, period?

Title
Review for Whipped (1999)
When I hear a film start with a woman saying, `Everybody fucks everybody
 it's the nature of the beast,' it usually means I've fallen asleep on
the couch and left Showtime on.  But Whipped isn't your typical 2:00 AM
cable soft-core pornography  it's a new, envelope-pushing sex comedy
playing at your local gigaplex.
Whipped takes place in New York City, where a group of four men meet in
a diner each Sunday to loudly discuss their sexual activity from the
previous week.  There's a Wall Street hunk who is so blonde and so
handsome, he's almost Craig Kilborne (Brian Van Holt, television's Love
& Money), a chronic masturbator who feels bad because he's only had nine
sexual partners (Jonathan Abrahams in his film debut), a married man who
finds himself outcast from his sexually active group of friends (Judah
Domke, Spanking the Monkey), and an unemployed beatnik writer (Zorie
Barber in his film debut  he's also an executive producer).
Each guy brazenly brags about his recent sexual conquests, and more
importantly, the sleazy means at which he `scammed' each woman.  I guess
it's a step up from using date-rape drugs, like in Loser, but it still
doesn't make an entertaining film.  I thought the film was headed toward
a storyline like the superior The Tao of Steve, but instead it gets
stuck spinning its wheels in a pool of vulgarities that have no purpose
other that shocking the audience.
Whipped initially earned an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, and since the
film has no sex scenes, you should have a pretty good idea of how
explicit the sexual dialogue can get.  These guys don't just fuck and
tell  they do it in the most graphic way you can imagine.  And exactly
what crowded diner have you been to where shouting about having your
salad tossed or your knob polished is acceptable?
The film is broken up over a seven-week period, and in week two, each
single guy unknowingly falls for the same girl.  Their diner talk is
more subdued as they sheepishly say things like, No, man  this one was
different.'  Mia (Amanda Peet, The Whole Nine Yards) supposedly has no
idea that the men are best friends, but each is so smitten with her,
they refuse to give her up.  Jealously and hormones rage, but Whipped
becomes bogged down with contrived voice-overs make the film choppy and
annoying
So what is Mia's story?  You know she's playing them from the film's
opening line, so the main questions become `why' and `to what end.'  Is
she a grad student writing a paper on the dating and sexual habits of
the American male?  Nope.  And while the payoff is slightly amusing,
it's still a huge letdown.
Whipped is the directorial debut of Peter M. Cohen, who also wrote the
film's script.  After Peet (who is dating Van Holt in real life) stole
the show from Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry in Yards, I figured Whipped
would be her big breakout role.  But the release date kept getting
pushed further and further back, which always makes me skeptical.
Although she gets top billing in the film, Peet has less screen time
than each of the four main male characters.  She's still an up-and-comer
with a bright future, but Whipped is something that may have been better
off if it was left off her resume.

Review for Deep End, The (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
You know when you get one of your car tires stuck in the snow (or the mud,
for those of you who don't live north of the Mason-Dixon Line) and the
harder you work at freeing yourself, the deeper you sink?  That's the basic
premise of The Deep End, a stellar new film from Scott McGehee and David
Siegel, the duo who made the impressive, Hitchcockian Suture on a very tiny
budget a few years ago.
Tilda Swinton (The Beach) plays Margaret Hall, and although she isn't
literally spinning her tires, they're figuratively kicking up all kinds of
debris.  Margaret lives in a beautiful home on Lake Tahoe with her husband,
three children and father-in-law Jack (played by Peter Donat, Mulder's
father from The X-Files).  Her husband, a military officer, is never around
(we don't ever see him), leaving Margaret to contend with his distant father
and the insanity of carting the kids around to all manner of extracurricular
activities.
Margaret's trouble begins before the film even starts.  It seems that her
oldest son, Beau (Jonathan Tucker, The Virgin Suicides), was recently
involved in a fender-bender that involved both alcohol and a 30-something
man she tracks down, in End's first scene, to a gay nightclub in Reno called
The Deep End.  "I'm looking for Darby Reese," she says in a no-nonsense
manner reminiscent of a slightly less confident version of Terence Stamp's
Wilson from The Limey.
Darby (Josh Lucas, American Psycho) is offered $5,000 to stay away from
Beau, and considers it because he's the kind of Reno lowlife who owes money
to a bookie.  But he shows up at the Hall house later that night,
confronting Beau in what leads to a shoving match.  Unbeknownst to Beau,
Darby accidentally slips off the pier and catches the business end of an
anchor in his chest.
Margaret finds the body washed up on the shore the next morning and,
assuming her son did it, lets the protect-at-any-cost maternal instinct kick
in as she disposes of Darby a la Harvey Keitel's Winston "The Cleaner" Wolf
in Pulp Fiction.  Beau is a kid with a bright future (he has scholarship
offers thanks to his trumpet skills) and Margaret doesn't want murder
charges hanging over his teenage head.
But then the tire-spinning starts, and Margaret keeps getting deeper and
deeper into what she thinks is a murder cover-up, eventually culminating in
a blackmail attempt from a man named Alek Spera (Goran Visnjic, ER) He has
proof of Beau's relationship with Darby and is prepared to take it to the
cops unless he gets $50,000 within 24 hours.  And Alek doesn't so much care
that Margaret has to deal with the dance recitals, car pools and the "Mom,
where's my baseball glove?" stuff that goes along with being a mother.
The house on the lake is chock full of secrets, and that's one of the things
that makes this story work so well (it's based on Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's
1947 novel called The Blank Wall, which was made into The Reckless Moment in
1949).  Margaret never questions her son about Darby's death, or his sexual
history, and Beau keeps mum even though he's sure she's having an affair
with that mysterious guy who keeps showing up and getting her flustered.
Even Jack seems to be hiding something from the rest of his family, although
we never really find out what it is.
McGehee and Siegel, who produced, directed and adapted End's story from
Holding's novel, use color here like they've been working with it for
decades (Suture was in black and white).  Along with cinematographer Giles
Nuttgens (Battlefield Earth), who won the top prize at Sundance for his work
here, the directors use many cool shades of blue throughout the film, which
helps to make it look like Margaret is living her life underwater.  We see
water throughout the film (a dripping tap, fish tank, car wash, swimming
pool, water cooler and, of course, the lake) but good old H2O has
practically soaked into Margaret's life, right down to her husband being in
the Navy, and Beau being a member of the water polo team.
Even if you think End loses its way toward the denouement, there's no
denying Swinton's wonderful performance.  It's one of the best you'll see
this year, and she should clear her calendar for Oscar night.  Visnjic and
Tucker do well in their smaller roles, but this is Swinton's show, and she
takes full advantage of it in a way that you won't easily forget.

Review for Cradle Will Rock (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Created by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and approved by Congress
in 1935 as a part of the New Deal, the U.S. Works Progress
Administration was one of the most important work relief programs in
history, providing jobs for the vast legions of the unemployed affected
by the Great Depression.  Later renamed the Works Project Administration
(or WPA), the organization created over eight million jobs between 1935
and 1943.  But, oh, the havoc it wreaked on the creative community.
Cradle Will Rock takes place in 1930s New York City.  The Depression has
kicked into high gear, the red scare is well under way, and fat-cat
business owners are dreading the loss of production due to impending
union strikes.  The film is careful to show the effects of the times on
a wide array of New York citizens, covering every rung on the social
ladder from the homeless to (literally) Nelson Rockefeller.  Yet all
seem to be wrapped up in the Federal Theater Project (FTP), a WPA
venture intending to organize and provide work for unemployed theater
professionals - from actors to stagehands - while bringing cheap
entertainment to the masses.
The many characters of this film revolve around the production of a play
called The Cradle Will Rock, a federally funded, pro-union musical that
the government thinks was created by Communist insiders.  This theme of
government versus art is an argument that continues today, with the
National Endowment for the Arts replacing the WPA and witty social
commentary traded for dung-covered paintings of the Mother of Christ
portrayed with (gasp!) dark skin.  To further contrast the times, the
1930s characters ask each other if they're `for Franco or the
Loyalists,' while today, we ask each other if we've `seen that
steel-cage match between The Rock and Mankind.'
After a title card explains that the film is mostly a true story, Rock
kicks off with an amazing opening shot that goes on for several minutes,
tracking the homeless Olive Stanton (Emily Watson, Angela's Ashes) from
her makeshift bed behind a motion picture theater, through a gritty
alley, and onto the streets of New York, where the aspiring star offers
songs for a nickel.  After waiting in a giant FTP line, Olive manages to
land a job as a stagehand from a sympathetic paper-pusher (Joan Cusack,
Arlington Road) and quickly finds herself hip-deep in the elitist world
of theater folks, before landing the unlikely lead role in the new play
directed by the perpetually drunk twenty-one-year-old Orson Welles
(Angus MacFadyen, Braveheart) and produced by the perfectly snooty John
Houseman (Cary Elwes, Kiss the Girls).
The play, of course, is The Cradle Will Rock, a musical created by Marc
Blitzstein (Hank Azaria, Mystery, Alaska), a playwright haunted by a
lack of sleep and two ghosts.  The film does a fantastic job showing
Blitzstein's creation of the play, which, to his horror, begins to turn
disastrous in the hands of the continually bickering Welles and
Houseman.  Also involved in the production is a dirt-poor Italian
immigrant (John Turturro, Illuminata) that shuns his pro-Mussolini
family so that he can raise his three kids to be Americans.
But the play is just the tip of the iceberg concerning characters and
subplots.  There's a struggling ventriloquist (Bill Murray, Rushmore)
that, thanks to the FTP, is forced to instruct two hapless oafs (Jack
Black and Kyle Gass from Tenacious D) in the art of ventriloquism.
There's an Italian Jew (Susan Sarandon, Anywhere But Here) that raises
money from rich American industrialites to give to Mussolini.  One of
her targets is a steel magnate (Philip Baker Hall, The Insider), who
literally sits around and counts his money with William Randolph Hearst
(horror director John Carpenter).  There's a feud between the wealthy
Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack, Being John Malkovich) and Diego Rivera
(Rubén Blades, The Devil's Own), who was paid $21,000 to paint a mural
inside the spanking new Rockefeller Center.
And that's still not all (don't get me started on Paul Giamatti's
role).  Rock has one of the biggest casts of the year, overshadowed only
by Magnolia and Any Given Sunday.  Which brings up an interesting point
 Magnolia needed over three hours to tell its multi-layered story,
while Sunday nearly hit the 180-minute mark and still seemed to gloss
over most of its roles.  Rock packs just as many characters into a film
that clocks in at just over two hours.  You almost need a longer film
with a cast this size.  Rock doesn't immediately grab you the way that
Magnolia does and, as a result, the beginning is a bit jumbled and the
story doesn't quite gel until well into the film.
Written, directed and produced by Tim Robbins (Dead Man Walking), Rock
is brilliantly lensed by Jean-Yves Escoffier (Gummo, Good Will Hunting),
and contains some great music from the original play, scored here by
David Robbins.  I'm not sure if he's a relation to Tim, but he worked on
Dead Man Walking and Bob Roberts.  In other nepotism news, Tim's pop
appears in the film as a congressman (he previously played a reverend
and a bishop in Walking and Roberts), not to mention Sarandon, who
nabbed an Oscar the last time she starred in one of her husband's
films.  Sarandon also shares a song with Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder
on Rock's soundtrack.
Rock looks fantastic, thanks to double Oscar-nominee Ruth Myers' (Emma,
The Addams Family) lovely costumes and 1999 Tony Award winner Richard
Hoover's (Twin Peaks) production design.  Stick around for the closing
credits, which feature P.J. Harvey performing `Nickel Under Your Foot,'
a song from the original production of the play.

Review for Cecil B. DeMented (2000)
A wise man once said, `Yo, Chuck, hold em hostage!'  Okay, it wasn't
really a wise man  it was Flava Flav  but his point is still pretty
easy to understand.  Mr. Flav was talking about the music industry and
it's failure to recognize his explosive Public Enemy as a legitimate
threat to the bloated beast that was the music business.
While there hasn't been a decent high profile kidnapping splattered on
the front pages of newspapers in years (unless you count the abduction
of John Travolta's brain), celebrated independent filmmaker John Waters
brings the under-appreciated crime into the spotlight with his latest
film, Cecil B. Demented.
To serve as the wickedly criminal heroes in Demented, Waters (Pecker)
has created a group of disenchanted teens called The Sprocketholes, who
live in a 21st century version of Andy Warhol's Factory in Baltimore's
abandoned Hippodrome theatre.  Each Sprockethole has a tattoo of their
favorite director, ranging from the expected (David Lynch, Spike Lee) to
the startling (William Castle, Kenneth Anger).
Their leader and director, the titular Cecil B. Demented (Stephen Dorff,
Blade) is a self proclaimed prophet against profit  a true independent
filmmaker that, like Ed Wood, doesn't waste time with more than one take
of each scene.  Cecil's goal is to destroy the Hollywood system as we
know it, using his group of hell-bent terrorists to create a new cinema
underground.  According to Cecil, mainstream film has stolen the nudity
and co-opted the violence of independent film, and they must pay
dearly.  In other words, he's nuttier than Lars von Trier.
So Demented and the Sprocketholes hatch a plan to kidnap America's
favorite actress  the devilishly two-faced Honey Whitlock (Melanie
Griffith, Crazy in Alabama)  from the charity premiere of her new
screwball comedy in Baltimore.  But the kidnapping is just the
beginning.  Demented and company plan on forcing Whitlock to perform in
their own anti-establishment film that will reveal the motion picture
industry as a bunch of boobs in finely-tailored suits.
As Demened's film hurtles toward its completion, Waters' script takes
swipes at just about everything from theatre concession prices and lame
advertising displays to the MPAA and the prestigious Guilds for Acting
and Directing.  Waters seems to hold particular disdain for theatre
latecomers, critics that love every film they see, and the generation
that green-lighted feature films based on bad television shows they
worshipped as children.
Waters' self-righteous finger pointing is a great idea for a film, and
the fact that he's able to pull the picture together with a low budget
and a supporting cast of acting rookies makes Demented even more
enjoyable.  The film is a hoot, from the inventive opening credits that
jump off theatre marquees, to the big orgy bloodbath finale.  Hold em
hostage, John.

Review for Half Baked (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
I admit it.  I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie.  A
snappy pothead comedy laced with dick and shit jokes.  Well, it turned
out to be not so snappy and, would you believe, not one mention of dicks
or shit.  What a disappointment.
This is the first pot movie since the heyday of Cheech & Chong and,
sadly, left me yearning for the days of Nice Dreams.  Half Baked tries
to double the fun with four stoners instead of the conventional two.
There's Thurgood Jenkins (Chappelle), a janitor at Frankensence & Burr
Laboratories, who narrates the story.  There's Brian (Breur) a burnt
record store employee and Scarface (Diaz), who works in a burger joint.
And don't forget Kenny (Williams), the sensitive kindergarten teacher.
After work each day, they meet at Jenkins house and light up Billy Bong
Thornton and then fight over which toker is on `munchie' patrol.  On
this fateful evening, Kenny goes out for the snack foods and happens
upon a police horse named Buttercup.  Kenny feeds the horse all of the
junk food and is horrified to see the horse drop dead.  Apparently,
Buttercup was diabetic and Kenny is arrested for killing an officer in
the line of duty.  The bail is set at $1,000,000 and, thus, the plot
comes to life: Sell enough pot to free Kenny!
Somehow, Jenkins has access to an unlimited supply of pharmaceutical
marijuana at work and the four hit the streets to raise Kenny's bail.
Of course, a film like this wouldn't be complete with out the following
stock characters: the love interest (named Mary Jane and played by
Rachel True), the rival drug lord (Clarence Williams III) and the
strange guy who's been asleep on the couch for years (Steven Wright).
OK, maybe that last one wasn't standard fare.  There were also a few bad
cameos (Snoop Doggy Dogg, Janeane Garofalo & John Stewart) and a few
good ones (Bob Saget, Willie Nelson & Tommy Chong). `David', the guy who
got thrown out of house on the second season of MTV's `The Real World'
also makes an appearance, but who cares?
Don't get me wrong, there were some very funny scenes.  There is a high
point when Thurgood takes Mary Jane on a date with only $8 in his
pocket.  As the date progresses,  a counter on the bottom of the screen
shows how much he has left.  Kenny's tearful avoidance of painful jail
ass sex is also amusing.  Hey, ass sex is almost like a dick and/or shit
joke, isn't it?
I expected better from this group of people.  Director Tamra Davis
worked on the hilarious Billy Madison and CB4.  Maybe it was the script,
which was co-written by Chappelle (The Nutty Professor).  In addition to
Jenkins, he also played rap star Sir Smoke A Lot.
Granted, this probably would have been a lot better if I burnt a big
fatty before it started and I'm sure that's what the target audience of
this film will probably do.  Maybe the theaters should hand weed out to
the patrons as they file into the theater.

Title
Review for Hard Rain (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
They say that bad things come in threes.  For Christian Slater, I guess
the three bad things would be:
1. He's the star of Hard Rain
2. He's the Associate Producer of Hard Rain
3. He's in frigging jail for biting someone
You know you're in trouble when Betty White (denture wearerRogaine
needer) is the big scene-stealer.
Hard Rain is the kind of movie where the bad guys chase the good guy
(Slater) around, but can't kill him because he has some special secret.
It is also the kind of movie where the good guy finds some hot babe
(Driver) while he's running about.  It is also about errrroh, who am I
kiddingit's not about anything else.
Slater plays Tom, an armored truck guard partnered with his Uncle
Charlie (human Chia Pet Ed Asner).  They've got $3 million and get
stranded during a flash flood in a small town.  Then the aforementioned
bad guys appear, led by Jim (Freeman).  Trouble soon ensues.
The best intentional part of the movie is when Tom is chased by bad guy
#3 (Wayne Duvall)on jet skisthrough a middle school.
The best unintentional part of the movie is the inconsistent levels of
the floodwaters.  At one point, the water nearly reached the traffic
lights but the one story sheriff station remained bone dry.  And I
didn't even hear a sump pump.  In fact, most places where the acting was
trying to happen had very little water until the actors showed up.
Then, it seemed to rise at an astonishing rate of about a foot per
second.
There is also a great unintentionally funny scene at the end when Karen
(Driver) signifies that killing is, in fact, bad by tossing her gun into
the flood water.  These scenes were finely crafted by Graham Yost, the
creative genius behind the recent Oscar hopeful Firestorm. Mikael
Salomon, whose only previous directing credit is the yawner Far and
Away, shows that he may be the second greatest helmer of water films
(after GodI mean James Cameron).  Next upThe Olsen Twins Splash-a-Bath
Christmas?

Title
Review for Swordfish (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Whatever happened to the good old days when John Travolta would make a
couple of really bad pictures and then stage a big career "comeback" with
something like Look Who's Talking? Since he blasted his way back on top with
1994's Pulp Fiction, Travolta hasn't come close to getting the Hollywood
bitch-slap off of the $20 million-per-film scrap heap that he so richly
deserves. C'mon - were Two of a Kind and Staying Alive really any worse than
Mad City and Lucky Numbers? We're talking about a guy with seven Razzie
nominations as compared to his two Oscar nods. And let's not even get
started on the whole Battlefield Earth thing, girlfriend.
All of which makes Swordfish's opening scene even more curious. Travolta,
playing yet another bad guy role (he hasn't worn the white hat since A Civil
Action.sort of), delivers a bizarre monologue directly into the camera,
declaring that Hollywood makes shitty, unimaginative films, before picking
apart the realism of the ending of Dog Day Afternoon (thusly telegraphing
the end of this film). His character, Gabriel Shear, is a high-tech
terrorist who needs only a world-class computer hacker to pull off a $9.5
billion raid of a secret government account to carry out his dastardly deeds
(which he does to defend the honor of his country, natch).
After the strange soliloquy, Swordfish kicks off with a bang...literally.
Shear and his band of miscreants are in the midst of a bank robbery, with
dozens of hostages wired to the hilt with explosives rigged to blow if they
leave the perimeter of the bank. The feds either don't know, don't care, or
don't believe Shear, inadvertently dragging one hostage to a loud, grisly
death that takes out several vehicles, storefronts and military personnel.
It's a terrific scene, and it turns out to be the end of the film. The rest
is told during an hour-long flashback through the eyes of Stanley Jobson
(Hugh Jackman, Someone Like You).
Jobson, we learn, is the world's former #1 computer hacker who has just been
paroled after a two-year stint at Leavenworth under the condition that he
never touch another computer again for the rest of his life. The bust, which
involved a virus that disabled the government's ability to read our personal
e-mail messages, left Jobson's marriage in shambles and, even worse, finds
his young daughter (Camryn Grimes, The Young and the Restless) calling the
Porn King of Southern California "Daddy." He's living with a ratty dog in an
even rattier trailer on a Midland, Texas oilfield when the comely Ginger
(Jackman's X-Men co-star Halle Berry) shows up, sticks a wad of cash under
his nose, and leads him back to Los Angeles to meet with her boss, Shear.
After a strange job interview that involves cracking the Defense
Department's computer system while getting a blow job and having a gun
jammed into his temple, Jobson decides to stick around long enough to make a
wad of cash in hopes of winning legal custody of his daughter with the
money. Now, I personally guarantee the world's top two hackers look more
like the Comic Book Store Guy from The Simpsons than Hugh Jackman (or
Bedazzled's Rudolf Martin, who plays another dreamboat computer geek). Is
anybody buying this crap?
Shear and his crew are being chased by an FBI agent, played by Don Cheadle
(in somewhat of a reprisal of his Traffic role). He's the same guy who
busted Stanley the first time around, too. There is, of course, a whole lot
of computer hokum (and the inevitable exciting hacking scene - always a
cinematic thrill), as well as a laughable scene where Stanley jumps off a
cliff and rolls for about 15 minutes. In real life, he'd be in frigging
China. There's also a shocking bit at the end where one of the country's top
black actresses gets lynched (oh my God, somebody get Spike Lee on the
phone...pronto!). And there's plenty of confusion about who is working for
whom, but the whole thing boils down to one secret government agency
battling other secret government agencies.
Swordfish was directed by Dominic Sena (Gone in 60 Seconds), and while it's
a stylish enough picture (thanks to cinematographer Paul Cameron), it has
the misfortune of being written by Skip Woods. Woods wrote and directed a
horrendous film called Thursday (when it played at the Toronto International
Film Festival, critic Roger Ebert belittled Woods during a post-screening
Q&A session) and hasn't shown much growth in his talent since then.
Swordfish certainly isn't a bad film; it's the kind of loud,
testosterone-driven (Berry got paid $500,000 per boob to show 'em) stuff
that fuels the summer box office with its mediocrity.

Title
Review for Blair Witch Project, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Rarely does a film live up to its hype quite the way this one does.
Blair Witch roared out of Sundance with buzz calling it the scariest
movie ever made.  I am prepared to not only back up that statement, but
to add that it will likely be the scariest movie that will ever be
made.  At least in my lifetime.  And I'm relatively young.
This isn't your average teen slasher flick with a cast raided from the
ranks of the WB.  Blair Witch is an extremely low-budget experiment by
first-timers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez.  Their premise is
simple: Three student filmmakers venture into the woods near
Burkitsville, Maryland to make a documentary about a local legend known
as the Blair Witch.  They are never seen again and what the viewer is
watching is their film footage, which has just been recovered one year
later.
Don't let the trailers fool you  only the last five seconds of them are
culled from the film.  The rest has all been added to make the incident
seem more dramatic and real, which it's not.  Well, it's not really
real.  The film you're watching is the actual film shot by these three
kids.  The directors sent them into the woods armed with a home video
camera, a 16mm black-and-white camera and a DAT recorder, with only
vague directions and no real idea of what might happen to them.  So you
see and hear everything that happens as it happens.  It is more
improvising then acting, and when these people are terrified, they are
genuinely terrified.
The film begins slowly, but once it takes off, you'll be on the ride of
your life.  Blair Witch opens with the kids interviewing local residents
of the small town about their knowledge of the legend.  Then they
venture off into the forest with the intention of spending a couple of
days and nights filming a few of the places where the Blair Witch was
reported to have wreaked havoc on innocent townsfolk that dared venture
into her woods.  They see the graves of several children, and they find
the rock from which several fishermen reportedly disappeared.
The first night is uneventful  Josh thinks he heard something, but the
others (Heather and Michael) just laugh it off, thinking that he's just
trying to spook them.  The next night, the sound is louder and heard by
all three.  By the third night, the group has lost their map, has no
idea of their location are and literally run screaming from their tent
as something appears to be attacking it from the outside.  Then it gets
really scary.  Hell, `scary' isn't a strong enough word.  I don't think
a strong enough word exists.  There are no scary monsters, splattered
blood or musical crescendos to make you jump, but I still found my heart
pounding out of my chest, my hands covering my mouth and my stomach
nauseous.  And I love scary movies.
The ending of the film is so disturbing that it can't be described.
It's been several weeks since I've seen the film and I still can't get
Heather's screaming out of my head.  She doesn't seem to be acting; it
sounds like the actual screams of a person that thinks she's going to
die.  It's more than a little sick, but it's more effective than
anything you've ever seen or heard.  When the credits rolled, I sat
slumped on my seat with my mouth hanging open, thunderstruck from what I
had just witnessed.  It took me several seconds to realize that I wasn't
breathing.  And I wanted to see it again.  Immediately.
Do not miss this film for any reason.  See it at night.  Park in an
isolated spot in the back of the theater and try not to soil yourself as
you walk back to your car.  This isn't Scream, where you were laughing
on the way home.  This is serious, hardcore terror and is definitely not
for the weak-hearted.  (1:29 - R for language and psychological horror
that you will never be able to escape.  Ever)

Review for Loser (2000)
Writer/director Amy Heckerling^Ňs last film won the Best Screenplay Award
from the National Society of Film Critics.  Clueless was a cleverly
written modern adaptation of Jane Austen^Ňs Emma, and the film
established Heckerling (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) as one of
Hollywood^Ňs quintessential teen romance/comedy screenwriters.
Since wallowing in critical praise for Clueless, Heckerling^Ňs track
record has been, at best, spotty.  She produced three bombs in a row ^Ö
Saturday Night Live^Ňs awful A Night at the Roxbury, the
almost-direct-to-video flop Molly and even a short-lived television
series based on Clueless.  With the release of Loser, the tally hits
four in a row.
Loser re-teams American Pie co-stars Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari as New
York City college students.  It^Ňs your typical three-act film where a
boy meets a girl in the first, tries to win her over in the second, and
just about gives up until the last five minutes of the third.  There^Ňs
nothing here you haven^Ňt seen before, except possibly for the brash new
levels of product placement that Loser achieves.  It^Ňs hard to tell if
you^Ňre watching a long commercial for Sam Adams beer, a paid
advertisement for Everclear^Ňs new album, or an actual film.
Biggs (Boys and Girls) stars as Paul Tannek, a freshman on a full
academic scholarship from a Midwestern town full of people with bad
haircuts covered by hats that are even worse.  He^Ňs the first person in
his family to go to college, and although he^Ňs smart enough to have
earned a full ride (with meal plan included), Paul is worried about his
lack of big-city sophistication and fancy book-learnin^Ň.  We find out
that he^Ňs one clumsy bastard from the funny montage that plays during
Loser^Ňs opening credits.
Suvari (American Beauty) plays fellow freshman Dora Diamond, a native
New Yorker that lives at home with her mom (although we never see her)
and pays her tuition with tips earned at a Manhattan titty bar.  Dora is
also having an affair with her slimy European Literature professor
Edward Alcott (Greg Kinnear, What Planet Are You From?), who treats her
like dog crap and is embarrassed to let people know about their
relationship.
Although Paul and Dora seem like total opposites (she^Ňs street-smart;
he^Ňs a mugger^Ňs dream), the two losers are more alike than they appear.
Professor Alcott walks all over Dora, while Paul^Ňs three hard-partying
roommates (Zak Orth, Thomas Sadoski and Jimmi Simpson) turn his dorm
life into a living hell.  Paul gets kicked out of his quarters, Dora
loses her job, and the two begin to spend more and more time together.
Biggs is an extremely likeable actor that makes the most out of
Heckerling^Ňs limp material.  Besides Hugh Jackson (X-Men) and Owen
Wilson (Shanghai Noon), I can^Ňt think of a relatively new actor that has
impressed me as much as Biggs.  On the other hand, Suvari is just plain
annoying.  She^Ňs whiny and she can^Ňt act, and the more she whines, the
more obvious it becomes that she doesn't have the chops.  Kinnear plays
the smarmy prick professor to perfection, but one has to wonder if he^Ňs
really acting, or just serendipitously cast.
Heckerling^Ňs direction isn^Ňt bad, but her script is almost downright
boring.  You practically sit around waiting for the next unexplainable
cameo from a stand-up comedian (Steven Wright, Bobby Slayton, Andy Dick,
Andrea Martin, David Spade) until the inevitable conclusion is reached
in the film^Ňs final reel.  And just when you think Heckerling^Ňs
screenplay has hit rock-bottom, Loser offers really lame explanations
for what happens to each of the characters right before the closing
credits.

Review for Waydowntown (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Gary Burns (Kitchen Party) may not be trying to establish himself as the
Canadian Kevin Smith, but his quirky humor, fast-paced dialogue and
dirt-cheap production values can't help but make me think of Silent Bob's
alter-ego.  His latest is a terrific blend of Office Space and the legendary
Seinfeld episode known as "The Contest" (it's the one with the bet to see
who can hold out the longest).
The competition in waydowntown involves four Calgary office drones who each
kick one month's salary into a kitty that will be claimed by the person who
can go the longest without venturing outside.  Like many large cities,
Calgary is full of underground tunnels and gerbilesque tubes that connect
residential apartments, office buildings and retail shops, so a person can
literally never go outside...unless, of course, they want to experience
things like fresh air, puppy-dog breath and whatever else happens up there
in Canada.
We're introduced to the game on Day 24, and each of the four contestants are
slowly going insane from the mind games they're playing with each other.
Sandra (Marya Delver) is convinced the recycled air is poisoning her and
thinks sniffing perfume ads from magazines is the key to keeping her lungs
all spiffy and clean.  Smarmy Curt's (Gordon Currie) fiancée won't have sex
with him until they're married, so he targets a vulnerable co-worker
(Jennifer Clement) to get some sweet release.  Randy (Tobias Godson) keeps
tabs on his competitors by befriending a nerdy security guard (James
McBurney), allowing him to watch surveillance cameras like he was Big
Brother, and the brooding Tom (Fab Filippo) becomes infatuated with a
superhero and his suicidal cubical-mate, played by the hysterical Don
McKellar (eXistenZ).
The rest of the plot revolves around a party being thrown in honor of the
company's decrepit founder, who turns out have some pretty serious social
flaws of his own.  waydowntown is narrated by Tom, who keeps an ant farm on
his desk (a not-so-subtle reference to people spending their lives trapped
in a big, glass structure).  Burns shot the film with a digital camera and
blew the finished product up to 35mm for use in theatres.  The result is a
dark, grainy, colorful mess, but there's no denying that Burns is a
filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him.

Review for America's Sweethearts (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
America's Sweethearts could have been the summer's best romantic comedy but
will instead be remembered as one of the season's biggest disappointments.
Don't get me wrong - the film isn't awful, and, at times, it's quite
entertaining.  Given the A-list cast, however, things should have clicked a
little louder and a lot more often.
Sweethearts points its magnifying glass at the seedy world of Hollywood
promotion - specifically, the press junket for a film called Time Over Time,
which re-teams America's two favorite actors, husband and wife Gwen Harrison
and Eddie Thomas (Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack from High Fidelity).
Time is the 10th film the lovebirds have made together, but there are two
major problems giving the film's producer (Stanley Tucci, Joe Gould's
Secret) fits of anxiety.  For starters, Gwen and Eddie split up over a year
ago, and to make matters worse, the director (scene-stealing Christopher
Walken) has hijacked the final cut of the $87 million picture, leaving a
beleaguered publicist named Lee (Billy Crystal, Analyze This) to do some
creative spin control.
Lee's plan is to make the junket media believe Gwen and Eddie are back
together, because "When (they're) together, the press forgets there's no
film."  Easier said than done, considering Eddie has spent the last 18
months at The Wellness Center with a Bowfinger-like Svengali (a hilarious
Alan Arkin).  Gwen won't be any easier to sway as she is convinced Eddie is
a homicidal maniac out to get her and is currently involved with a Latin
lover type named Hector (Hank Azaria, Tuesdays With Morrie).
Julia Roberts (The Mexican) plays Kiki, the careworn assistant (and sister)
of Gwen, who, as we learn in a flashback, used to be 60 pounds heavier and
has always carried a torch for Eddie.  Kiki is the calm, kindly, intelligent
Ying to Gwen's bitchy, self-centered and dumb Yang, and thusly, we must root
not for Eddie and Gwen to reconcile, but for Eddie to realize he really
loves Kiki.  He's Lloyd Dobler, for Christ's sake - he should be with a real
girl.
In addition to failing to go far enough in its attempt to satirize the star
mentality, Sweethearts also delivers the moral that you can't win the guy
unless you lose a bunch of weight.  Aside from Roberts, the leads are all
way too annoying and bland, and are easily outshined by each supporting
role. And if it seems to you like Crystal gets all of the script's good
jokes, it's because he wrote it (with Bedazzled's Peter Tolan).  This is the
first film directed by Joe Roth since 1990's Coupe de Ville (he's the guy
who left Disney to create the studio that made Sweethearts).
The Hector role, which was supposed to go to crackhead Robert Downey, Jr, is
completely overused and becomes an increasing aggravation in Sweethearts
final reel.  The more Hector talks, the more he sounds like a gay Apu from
The Simpsons.  What's with the white guy playing a Latino, anyway?  Why not
get Antonio Banderas or Luis Guzman?  And, Jesus H. Christ - is anybody else
tired of seeing celebrities in fat suits?  Hope not, because after Julia
(and the talentless Martins Short and Lawrence), we'll see Gwyneth don one
in a few months for the Farrelly brothers' Shallow Hal.
The more clueless critics who are familiar with junkets will love the inside
jokes (a la Roberts' Notting Hill) without realizing the film is making fun
of how incredibly stupid they are.  The audience gets the same treatment,
learning that the quality of a film doesn't matter one bit compared to what
the tabloids are writing about its stars.  But the ultimate irony is that a
film that preaches about the promotion of a dud is itself a dud.

Review for Shadow of the Vampire (2000)
The legend of Max Schreck is ... well, legendary.  The unknown actor
virtually came from nowhere to land the role of the vampire in the
classic 1922 film Nosferatu.  According to myth, Schreck wasn't just
pretending to be a bloodsucker  he actually was one of the undead.  The
new film Shadow of the Vampire brings the legend of Schreck to the big
screen over 70 years after the creepy actor put his unique stamp on what
many consider to be the greatest portrayal of a vampire ever.
But how successful can a film be with no A-list stars, a mediocre
actor-turned-producer (Nicolas Cage), a no-name director, a first-time
screenwriter, a miniscule running time (most of which seem to be burned
during the opening credits) and the presence of Udo Kier?  The answer is
`moderately."  Vampire is a sloppy mess of a film, really corny, and a
lot of fun to watch.  It also boasts what should be a lock for a Best
Supporting Actor nomination at next year's Academy Awards in Willem
Dafoe, who plays the spindly Schreck to eerie perfection.  Kudos should
also be given to the people responsible for transforming Dafoe into
Schreck.
John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) plays Nosferatu director F.W.
Murnau, who wanted to make a film based on Bram Stoker's `Dracula,' but
Stoker's wife Florence refused to give him permission.  Murnau created
his own vampire character in Nosferatu, swapping Count Dracula for Count
Orlock.  His film, which was silent, followed a simple story involving a
German real estate agent (played here by Eddie Izzard, Velvet Goldmine)
and his fiancée (Catherine McCormack, Dangerous Beauty) who meet up with
a potential client in Orlock (Dafoe, American Psycho).
In Vampire, Schreck is presented to the cast and crew of Nosferatu as
one of the craft's first method actors.  Murnau explains that Schreck
will only appear in full costume and makeup, and, because of his kooky
requirements, insists they only shoot at night.  You don't see
Shreck/Orlock until nearly 30 minutes into the film, which, given the
running time here, is a significant portion of the movie.  But when he
finally emerges from the shadows, it's quite startling.  Where most
screen portrayals of vampires have opted for creating a brooding
lady-killer character, Vampire instead shows Schreck/Orlock as a bald,
overgrown rat with impossibly long fingernails and gimpy little arms
that hang above his chest like a bat.
Vampire mainly shows the trouble Murnau had keeping the bloodthirsty
Schreck in line during the filming of Nosferatu.  When the
cinematographer dies of a mysterious ailment (and two tiny puncture
wounds in his neck), Murnau is forced to depart the set to find another
cameraman, which leaves Schreck unsupervised with the rest of the film
crew.  In order to keep Schreck from wreaking total havoc on the set,
Murnau promises to `give' the morphine-addicted female lead to Schreck
once the filming is completed, provided he behaves himself.  The finale
is as madcap as you would expect from a success-hungry director, a
hophead and a vampire pretending to be an actor pretending to be a
vampire.
While most of the Vampire seems haphazardly slapped onto film, it does
do a great job recreating the look and feel of a silent film with the
use of title cards and the shift from black-and-white to color stock.
The story, which was written by debut screenwriter Steven Katz (he
penned part one of HBO's From the Earth to the Moon), is unnecessarily
messy for a film this length.  Vampire was directed by E. Elias Merhige,
whose only previous film credit was the 1991 horror flick, Begotten.  An
interesting note  Max Schreck is the name of the villain in Batman
Returns (played by Christopher Walken).

Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
It's hard to effectively rate a movie like The Phantom Menace.  If you
compare it to its previous three films, it comes up a bit short.  If the
first three films were never made, viewers would likely be as floored as
they were when the first Star Wars film was released over twenty years
ago.  Was I disappointed?  A little.  Am I going to see it again?  Yes.
Two more times?  Probably.
Taking place about forty years before the beginning trilogy (Star Wars,
The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi), Menace shares only a
few characters familiar with audiences.  Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) is
back and appears to have less ear hair.  A much younger Obi-Wan Kenobi
(Ewan McGregor, Trainspotting) plays a limited role, but promises to be
a much bigger force in the next two installments, due in 2002 and 2005.
But, most importantly, a very young innocent named Anakin Skywalker
(Jake Lloyd, Jingle All the Way)  soon to become the enigmatic Darth
Vader, as well as the father of Luke and Leia  is discovered by Jedi
Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson, Les Miserables).
Menace seems like more of a set piece for Episodes Two and Three of
George Lucas' current trilogy.  This is the first film Lucas has
directed since the first Star Wars film  and it shows.  Acting and
story take a back seat to the special effects, which are nothing short
of goddamned unbelievable.  The script offers too many flat one-liners
and jokes geared to pre-school-aged kids.  And don't get me started on
the Muppets and computer-generated characters.  The worst is Jar Jar
Binks, a horrible Roger Rabbit knock-off that is immediately hated by
anyone without either a diaper or a pocket-protector.  (2:11  PG for
violence and the possible implication that Qui-Gon banged Anakin's slave
mother, Shmi)

Title
Review for Hanging Up (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
I'm not sure if other people do this, but when I read a book, I can't
help but think about who I would choose to play each character should
the novel ever be made into a film.  I also visualize how certain shots
should be set up and decide which parts of the book I would leave out
altogether.  Then if the movie is ever made, I complain about the
casting, the script adaptation and the direction.  It always seems
better in my head.
The casting for Hanging Up is probably the closest to what I envisioned
while reading it.  Need a craggy curmudgeon on his last leg?  Get Walter
Matthau.  Need his thirty-something daughter with a cute up-turned
nose?  Get Meg Ryan.  Need her hippie younger sister?  Get Lisa Kudrow.
Need her older, sophisticated sister?  Getokay, I would have picked
Sigourney Weaver over Diane Keaton just because she looked good as a
blonde in Galaxy Quest.  But since Keaton directed the film, she thought
casting herself was a better idea.  Whatever.
The whole dying-father-and-three-daughters set-up might sound a bit like
`King Lear,' but don't be silly.  Ryan (You've Got Mail) plays Eve, a
stressed-out, married mother of one who owns a party planning company
and is the middle daughter of a family that does the majority of their
communicating on the phone.  Her father (Matthau, The Odd Couple II), a
former Hollywood screenwriter, bombards her with phone calls from his
nursing home, while she relays his condition to fashion magazine founder
Georgia (Keaton, The Other Sister) and soap opera actress Maddy (Kudrow,
Friends).  Over the years, the sisters have taken turns caring for their
dad, who has become increasingly crazy as the years pass.
Hanging Up opens with a lovely montage of old photographs of the
characters, over which we hear Eve receiving numerous phone calls from
her father, bragging about Georgia's magazine exploits no less.  This
helps to establish Eve's growing irritation with her dad.  So far, so
good.  But there are big problems up ahead.
What made the book so interesting is that the characters rarely shared
scenes together, emphasizing the importance of the telephone as a major
part of the story.  Also, they hung up on each other a lot more, hence
the title.  I guess somebody must have thought that nobody would pay to
see Meg Ryan talk to people on the phone, so the script was altered to
accommodate a minimum of two stars in every scene.
Another reason why the book worked was because it was unconventional.
There aren't too many comedies about your father dying.  While the novel
was full of dry, subtle humor, someone must have decided that the idea
of a `comedy' about `death' would be too dark for the public to handle.
So they chose `death' and ran with it.  There are few laughs in the
film.
Perhaps the best part of the book was that Eve was slowly beginning to
fall in love with an Iranian doctor that was involved in a traffic
accident with her son Jesse (Jesse James, A Dog of Flanders).  The
doctor and Eve speak on the phone several times, but don't meet until
the end of the novel.  In the film, however, Eve is the one that gets
into the accident, so she meets the doctor right away.  There are no
phone conversations between them and no romance, implied or otherwise.
Perhaps someone figured that nobody would want to see a Middle Eastern
guy and America's favorite pixie get together.
Want more evidence on why this adaptation doesn't work?  Eve is supposed
to be a protagonist, but her and her sisters are so whiny and
self-centered that the dad becomes the most likeable character in the
film.  It's not supposed to be that way.  The freedom with time worked
really well in the novel, but it's done all wrong here.  There is an
important flashback that works much better toward the end, but the film
shoves it into its middle.
The acting in Hanging Up is pretty solid, so what went wrong?  The book
was written by Delia Ephron, who adapted the screenplay with her sister
Nora, who also happened to direct Ryan in Mail and Sleepless in
Seattle.  It must be difficult to screw your own book up so badly.  The
direction is fairly well done, but one has to wonder what issues Keaton
has with her parents.  Her last directorial effort, Unstrung Heroes, was
about a mom that died.  Toss in a really lame closing scene, and you've
got one hell of a mess.

Title
Review for Sunshine (1999)
Later this summer, Jim Carrey will essentially play two different
characters in the same film when he portrays a man with
split-personality disorder in Me Myself & Irene.  In this superb new
epic about the trials and tribulations of a family of Hungarian Jews,
Ralph Fiennes does Carrey one better by tackling three unique (albeit
less comical) roles as he plays a different part in each generation of
the family.
Sunshine is as much a story of Hungary's tumultuous political upheaval
as it is a poignant tale of a family's struggle to keep itself
together.  The film covers the period between 1840 and 1989, when the
Red Curtain finally came crashing down around Eastern Europe, and is
broken into three hour-long sections that each show one generation of
the Sonnenschein family, who have prospered throughout the late 1800s
thanks to a recipe for an herbal tonic called `Taste of Sunshine' (the
film's original title) and a gold watch that is passed down from father
to son in each generation.
In the first story, Fiennes (The End of the Affair) plays Ignatz
Sonnenschein, a loyalist to the Austro-Hungarian Empire that rules his
country.  Against the wishes of his father, Ignatz marries his cousin
Valerie (Jennifer Ehle, Wilde) and shortens his last name to Sors to
avoid anti-Semitism in his attempt to become a powerful judge in
Budapest.  Having already alienated his father by changing the family
name, and his brother Gustave (James Frain, Where the Heart Is) by
simply not sharing his radical political ideas, Ignatz's career
ambitions threaten his relationship with Valerie as well.
Sunshine's second story concentrates on Adam Sors (Fiennes), the younger
son of Ignatz and Valerie.  Adam is a fencer who, like his father, must
deny his roots when he is forced to convert to Catholicism in order to
further his competitive career.  Hungary's national champion, Adam's
dreams of winning a gold medal in the 1936 Berlin Olympics are dashed by
a Nazi radio report that exposes Jews and outlines what jobs they are
not allowed to keep.  Like father, like son  Adam has trouble with the
ladies.  Happily married to Hannah (Molly Parker, Waking the Dead), Adam
has an affair with his sister-in-law Greta (Rachel Weisz, The Mummy).
The film's final chapter features Adam's son Ivan (Fiennes), who was one
of the few Sors to survive the Holocaust.  As a result, he's feels jaded
and guilty, and tries to avenge the past by committing himself to the
new Communist regime.  But the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, and
Ivan soon finds himself having an affair with the sultry wife (Deborah
Unger, The Hurricane) of a high-ranking party official (William Hurt,
One True Thing).
Sunshine comes full circle when Ivan, after being stirred by his grandma
Valerie (Rosemary Harris, My Life So Far  she's also Ehle's real-life
mother), abandons his ties to Communism and changes his name back to
Sonnenschein.  Having lived through the most harrowing experiences of
20th century Europe (both World Wars, the Holocaust and the rise of
Communism), Ivan seems to be the first person in his family who is
prepared to accept the consequences of not hiding his roots.  The final
shot of Ivan walking down a busy street in modern Budapest is
beautifully executed, and a reminder of how much has changed.
Brilliantly directed by István Szabó (Mephisto), who co-wrote the
haunting script with internationally acclaimed playwright Israel
Horovitz, Sunshine is truly the year's first Oscar-quality film.  It's
already won the Best Screenplay trophy at the European Film Awards,
where it also nabbed top honors for Best Actor (Fiennes) and Best
Cinematography (Lajos Koltai, The Legend of 1900) and was nominated for
Best Picture.  Sunshine was also nominated for a mind-boggling fourteen
Genie Awards (the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars), winning the prize
for Best Motion Picture of the year.

Review for Legend of Bagger Vance, The (2000)
Films that romanticize a sport where you dress like a mama's boy and
whack a ball with a stick are inherently stupid.  You can't even call it
a sport, since the only way a player can break into a sweat is if they
weigh over 300 pounds.  There's nothing spiritual or magical about the
game (you can get sand in your shoes at the beach, too), which is why
Happy Gilmore and Caddyshack are better golf films than Tin Cup and The
Legend of Bagger Vance.
Vance was directed by Robert Redford (The Horse Whisperer), so right off
the bat you know it's going to be long, slow, beautifully photographed,
full of inspirational music and will most likely feature a lead
character who looks like Redford did 30 or 40 years ago (like Ralph
Fiennes in Quiz Show and Brad Pitt in A River Runs Through It).  This
time up, it's Matt Damon (The Talented Mr. Ripley)
Damon plays Rannulph Junuh, a legendary Southern golfer who amazed fans
with long drives and a delicate short game in pre-World War I Savannah.
During the war, Captain Junuh lost all of his men in battle (in a choppy
Saving Private Ryan-ish scene) and came home to Georgia as a craggy
drunk unable to play the game because he'd `lost his swing.'
Meanwhile, Junuh's ex-girlfriend Adele (Charlize Theron, The Yards) has
inherited a struggling golf resort from her father, who offed himself as
the country's depression left his new business without any customers.
The only way Adele can keep the place from folding is to hold a gimmicky
exhibition golf tournament between the nation's top two golfers  Bobby
Jones (Joel Gretsch, who looks like Damon's doppelganger) and Walter
Hagen (Bruce McGill, The Insider).  But the only way Savannah's leaders
will sign off on the contest is if a local golfer is allowed to compete.
Enter Junuh, who is suggested to represent the city by young Hardy
Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief, in his film debut), a pre-pubescent chap
who has heard incredible stories about the once-great local legend.
Junuh, of course, doesn't want to have anything to do with the
tournament, but he comes around when a mystical black caddy named Bagger
Vance (Will Smith, Men in Black) literally appears out of nowhere and
helps the fraught golfer find his swing again.
Vance then proceeds to follow the typical sports flick formula  perform
badly at first, get better and better before swooning a little, and then
 well, I'm not going to give away the ending, but you can probably
figure it out on your own.  The last hole unwinds over an ass-numbing 15
minutes, meaning that this movie about golf is actually, at times, as
exciting as real golf.
As a long-time promoter of edgy, independent cinema, Redford seems like
he should be above this kind of schmaltz.  Vance tries too hard to find
its way into your heart (but, thankfully, not as hard as Pay It Forward)
with sweeping music (Rachel Portman, The Cider House Rules) and
sun-drenched cinematography (Michael Ballhaus, What Planet Are You
From?).  Judianna Makovsky's (Pleasantville) costumes  especially the
hats  are the standout from Vance's behind-the-camera talent.
Vance was based on a novel by Steven Pressfield and was adapted by
Jeremy Leven (Don Juan DeMarco).  The film is narrated by an older
version of Hardy Greaves (Jack Lemmon, Tuesdays With Morrie), which adds
another layer of the aforementioned schmaltz to the overall package.  As
far as the acting goes, Damon does well, but Smith is the standout.
Here, he's turned down to a `6' (as opposed to the usual `10' or `11'
he's usually cranked up to).  His understated performance, a technique
he used in his best film to date (Six Degrees of Separation), is
reminiscent of a younger version of Morgan Freeman in Driving Miss
Daisy.

Review for Double Take (2001)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
There's nothing like taking a big, post-holiday breath, only to
experience something that smells like the ass of a man allergic to
toilet paper.  It happens every January, and unless you live in Iowa,
the stink is coming from your local megaplex.  Each year, as
Oscar-caliber films that saw limited release in major markets slowly
make their way to smaller cities, the big studios try to sneak their
worst films into theatres in the hope that you'll mistake Bette Midler's
Isn't She Great for Magnolia.
The trend continues this year with Double Take, a horrible film about
two characters who swap identities for reasons that still remain
unclear.  It's like a third-rate version of Kid 'N Play's Class Act,
which was a third-rate version of Trading Places, which I'm sure was a
third-rate version of something I'm just too young to remember.
Take stars two black men at opposite ends of the Manhattan social
spectrum. Daryl Chase (Orlando Jones from the 7UP commercials) is a
well-mannered, affluent "sell-out" who works for The Man and has a
supermodel girlfriend, while Freddy Tiffany (Eddie Griffin, Malcolm &
Eddie) is phat, hip and, supposedly, phunny.  They meet when a thief
snatches Daryl's briefcase on the way to work.  We don't ever learn what
it is that Daryl does for a living, but know it must be important when
Freddy exclaims, "Man, how you get a big-ass office like this?" after
following Daryl to work.
We do know that Daryl's company is involved in some shady dealings with
a lazy-eyed Mexican, and before you know it (literally - because it
makes no sense), he's discovering dead bodies and being attacked by
gun-wielding maniacs because of his business connections.  A few really
bad explanations later, Daryl is mistaken for a murderer and hops on a
train in search of a CIA agent who can get him out of this pickle.
Freddy tags along, doing his best impression of Liza (loud, theatrical
and exceedingly annoying).
Take features more double-crossing, backstabbing and hidden identities
than either of the two Mission: Impossible films, which means, for a
film of this magnitude, that the whole thing is a lot more complicated
and messy than it needs to be.  Writer/director George Gallo,
responsible for the equally awful Trouble in Paradise, seems more
concerned about the big surprise ending (which is sooo not a surprise)
than trying to establish any continuity to the film.
There is a seemingly endless string of completely ludicrous events, like
when Daryl and Freddy take the train from New York to Texas and get
there overnight.  In another scene, which takes place in the middle of
nowhere, Daryl is able to procure a car and a fake moustache to alter
his identity in an attempt to cross the border.  It would be one thing
if it didn't make sense and was funny, but there isn't one second of
entertainment for anyone that doesn't require a drool bib.  Most of the
jokes come at the expense of the NYPD and the Mexican character's lazy
eye  all things that are so, like, 1999.
Jones is likeable enough as the straight man, but Griffin is so bad, he
would have ruined the picture even if it wasn't poorly written and
directed. When the film's only real talent (Vivica A. Fox) gets gunned
down in the first ten minutes, you know you're going to be in for a long
ride.  There's also a whole lot of swearing, but nothing bad enough to
warrant an "R" rating.

Review for Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Tomb Raider has, at press time, already inhaled over $115 million at the box
office, throwing the gauntlet down to this summer's other big
videogame-turned-feature-film, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.  The game
is wildly popular, selling over 33 million copies of its nine different
versions since 1987.  While the film version probably won't be nearly as
beloved, it is the first major motion picture to feature computer-generated
people who look real (other than the occasional character, like Toy Story
and Princess Fiona in Shrek), and that's got to count for something, right?
Even if the story is really bad, right?
The story is just as lame as Raider's and any other console-to-screen film,
but Raider had a lot more fun reaching its inevitable conclusion than most.
Fantasy's game creators, who also have all of their hands in the film, pride
themselves on creating new stories and new characters each time out, but
neither are anything you haven't seen a bunch of times before.  It's
frustrating to hear about the detail, time and manpower put into animating
the 60,000 hairs on the main character's head when so little thought went
into the story.
The film is set in 2065 - several decades after "they" took over, or so a
narration tells us.  "They" are a group of indestructible alien phantoms
that gobble the energy out of the human form like meat off a chicken wing
bone.  Fantasy's heroine, scientist/physician Aki Ross (voiced by Ming-Na,
ER), has been infected by the aliens and is in search of an environmental
treatment that will both cure her and save the planet from total domination.
Together with Dr. Sid (Donald Sutherland, Space Cowboys), she has determined
that collecting eight "spirits" will do the trick.  Aki has six now, and
heads to Old New York City to find the other two.
It is here she meets Captain Gray Edwards and the Deep Eyes squadron (which
sounds like a kitschy garage band), who protect the few remaining citizens
living under the giant protective dome that covers a big chunk of Manhattan.
Gray (Cats and Dogs' Alec Baldwin, providing his second "voice" job in the
last two weeks) and his crew (Steve Buscemi, Peri Gilpin and Ving Rhames)
help Aki and Dr. Sid in their quest to find the missing spirits, which must
be done before the evil General Hein (James Woods, Scary Movie 2) unleashes
the giant, space-based Zeus Cannon on the alien meteor, which landed in the
Caspian Mountains.  See?  It's good vs. evil, with a whole environmental
message thrown in for good measure.
As silly and downright confusing as it is, the story (penned by director and
game developer Hironobu Sakaguchi and Apollo 11 scribe Al Reinert) is
largely inconsequential.  How powerful is the ability of computer animation?
It can make Buscemi into an attractive man, for Pete's sake.  But seriously,
folks, the characters are so frighteningly lifelike (especially Dr. Sid)
that it becomes distracting, which I guess actually helps the story in a
way.  If you look hard enough, you can find plenty of flaws (especially in
the mouth movement when the characters talk), but don't bother -  this still
looks pretty goddamn incredible.
As a side note, the filmmakers should get some credit for not making Aki
into an impossibly busted cybervixen (a la Lara Croft).  Considering the
film's target audience (and the inability to get laid attendant thereto),
it's quite a pleasant surprise.

Review for Talented Mr. Ripley, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Anthony Minghella's follow-up to his Oscar-winning adaptation of The
English Patient is a stylish Hitchcockian thriller that is as beautiful
as it is creepy.  Based on Patricia Highsmith's novel of the same name,
The Talented Mr. Ripley stars a hunky teen heartthrob (Matt Damon) as a
homosexual sociopath with murderous tendencies.  Hardly sounds like
Christmas fare (which is probably why the gay angle is missing from the
film's trailer), but Ripley will indeed be released on December 25th to
a largely unsuspecting public.
Damon (Dogma) stars as Tom Ripley, a struggling New York City piano
tuner that, thanks to some lucky timing and a borrowed blazer, ends up
being offered a short-term, high-paying job.  Ripley will receive $1,000
to go to Europe and persuade the son of a shipping magnate to return
home in time for the Thanksgiving holiday.  So he brushes up on his
Italian and heads for the sun-drenched Mediterranean.
His target  called Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law, eXistenZ)  is a spoiled
wild-child whose primary talent seems to be spending his allowance.
(Why his pop doesn't just cut Dickie off remains a mystery.)  Dickie
frequents jazz clubs, cheats on his novelist fiancée Marge (Gwyneth
Paltrow, Shakespeare in Love) and has no intention of returning to the
U.S. or to his father's business.  Although the pasty-white Ripley has
trouble fitting in amongst the well-to-do bronze gods at first, he
eventually wins their approval by doing a dead-on impression of Dickie's
father.  But Ripley only has one dress shirt and a ratty corduroy
jacket, so Dickie lets him borrow some of his threads and plants in his
underprivileged underling the idea to take over Dickie's identity.  As
Ripley says, `I'd rather be a fake somebody than a real nobody,' and he
shows that he would go to any lengths to realize this dream.
The story may sound familiar to you because it was already made into a
film in 1960 (Miramax re-released it in the U.S. a few years back).
This original version, Plein Soleil  (Purple Noon), starred Alain Delon
in the title role and seemed both to gloss over the whole gay twist and
give the film a considerably more upbeat ending.  But this is 1999 and
films have changed a lot in those intervening four decades.  Among other
upgrades from the 60s adaptation are two extra murders and a brand-new
character (Cate Blanchett, An Ideal Husband).  There are a number of
other differences, but revealing them would give away too much of the
plot.
Damon is spectacular as the spine-chilling chameleon Ripley.  I always
thought his acting chops were a bit overrated, but with this role he
establishes himself as one of the better young actors in Hollywood.  Law
is entirely believable as a snooty rich-boy, but Paltrow is just
annoying.  She's probably a snooty rich-girl in real life and didn't
know how to approach the idea of playing herself.  Most enjoyable
perhaps is Philip Seymour Hoffman (Flawless), who plays a friend of
Dickie's in a manner that will remind you of a young Thurston Howell
III.  His blood is so blue it looks like he's choking.
Complementing Damon's performance is a top-notch production team
(including four Oscar winners from The English Patient) that captures a
strikingly beautiful 50s Italy.  The film is aglow with bright, sunny
color, the water is always blue (even in the bathtub), and you can
almost smell the combination of olive oil and body odor in the street
scenes.  Minghella's direction is simply gorgeous, using spellbinding
camera work that would make Hitchcock proud.  Ironically, Hitchcock used
Highsmith's first novel, Strangers on a Train, to make one of his finest
films.
Ripley's ending may not please everyone (in fact, it caused a lot of
groans during my screening), but it's faithful to Highsmith's book,
which spawned four sequels over a thirty-eight-year period.  The third,
`Ripley's Game,' was made into a 1977 Wim Wenders film called American
Friend that starred - get this - Dennis Hopper in the title role.
Consider that alternative if you gripe about this film.

Review for Haiku Tunnel (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you've ever worked in a large office, for a law firm, or even as a temp,
you'll definitely want to check out Haiku Tunnel, a new film based on Josh
Kornbluth's popular one-man play.  It's better than Office Space when it
comes to milking the cruel banality of office work for comedy, but I'm not
sure that people unfamiliar with the concept of cubicles and printer jams
will really get it.  Those folks ought to try, though, because it's a very
funny film.
Kornbluth, who looks like a balding cross between Horatio Sanz and Jack
Black, stars as himself, a native New Yorker living in the "proletarian"
area of San Francisco.  He's employed by a temp agency called Uniforce and
prides himself on his ability to arrive at work on time and get the job done
quickly.  Josh loves being a temp, as he seems to have a commitment problem,
having just dumped a beautiful girlfriend for being too perfect.
Tunnel takes place over just one week, which begins with Josh being assigned
to a law firm called Schuyler & Mitchell (or S&M) to provide secretarial
work for an attorney who may actually be the Prince of Darkness (Warren
Keith), though he's nowhere as scary as Kevin Spacey in Swimming With
Sharks.  Shunned by his co-workers because he's just a temp, Josh is given a
cassette containing the dictation for 17 very important letters that must be
sent immediately.  But he's constantly sidetracked by a myriad of things,
including a very funny office orientation (conducted by Harry Shearer),
several attempts to write a novel and an enticing offer to become "perm."
Because S&M agrees to cover the cost of his psychiatric visits, Josh
eventually caves in and gives up his beloved status as a temporary employee,
which earns the attention of the peculiar co-workers who had previously
ignored him.  Mindy (Amy Resnick), Clifford (Brian Thorstenson) and DaVonne
(June Lomena) will each remind you of at least one wacko you've been forced
to work with at some point in your employment endeavors.
Though it's oddly structured (there are flashbacks within flashbacks) and
things seem to fall apart in the third act, Tunnel is still a cute, charming
little film that will delight a demographic that desperately needs more
humor in their lives.  It's obvious Kornbluth has extensive experience in
temporary office jobs, but according to the press notes, so does most of the
film's other acting talent (some still temped during filming).  Plus, how
can you possibly dislike a film that plays The Pixies' "Debaser" over the
opening credits?

Review for Head Over Heels (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you think turning one of Hitchcock's greatest thrillers into a romantic
comedy is a silly idea, just wait until you see how it shakes out on the
screen. Not only is the amateurish Head Over Heels based on a lame premise,
but its co-stars are supermodels, too. Have you ever seen a supermodel act?
There's a reason Cindy Crawford has been banned from appearing in feature
films.
Heels' voiceover opening introduces us to Amanda Pierce (Monica Potter,
Patch Adams), who moved from Podunk, Iowa to Manhattan, where she restores
Renaissance paintings for the Metropolitan Museum of Art with her lesbian
best friend (China Chow) and three elderly women who warn her of the dangers
of not having a personal life. Amanda has, like, the worst judgment in men
and stuff, catching her latest beau (Timothy Olyphant, Gone in 60 Seconds)
in bed with a lingerie model.
Even though she's completely written off the idea of finding the right guy,
Amanda falls for a handsome neighbor named Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr.,
Boys and Girls), whose apartment is visible from her window. Amanda becomes
obsessed with Jim, trying to convince herself that he is flawed in one way
or another. When she witnesses an apparent murder in Jim's flat, nobody
believes her, and she starts her own investigation into Jim's surprising
life. Could it all be a big misunderstanding? What're you, retarded?
Instead of being laid up with a broken leg like Jimmy Stewart in Rear
Window, Amanda's handicap is her roommates. There are four of them, and
they're all super-tall, super-thin supermodels. In typical Hollywood
fashion, they're a predictable cross-section of what us normal folk assume
prowl the catwalk - a WASP (Shalom Harlow), an Aussie bumpkin (Sarah
O'Hare), a husky-voiced Russian (Ivana Milicevic) and an African-American
(Tomiko Fraser). They teach Amanda how to take advantage of men and give her
the obligatory makeover, even though she's better (and more healthy) looking
than any of them are.
Potter's Amanda is tongue-tied, clumsy and comes off as a less talented
Julia Roberts (with a bad blonde wig), or a more talented Christina
Applegate, depending on if she's whored up or not. There are worse people to
be compared to, I guess, but Potter looks so much like Roberts, it's almost
distracting. Prinze is too young and too goofy to be taking on roles like
this, but it is interesting to point out that, like Traffic's Javier
Rodriguez, his character has a hard-on for kids and baseball.  There's a
scene where Prinze punches someone in the face, but his wrist is as limp as
Ricky Martin's.
Most of the jokes in Heels' script (penned by a hodgepodge of four writers)
revolve around the fact that supermodels are shallow, which is hardly a
revelation. Director Mark S. Waters, who displayed a talent for successfully
handling dark comedy with The House of Yes, adds nothing to the weak script.
The Go-Go's song which shares the same name as the title seemed to be added
as an afterthought.

Review for Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
In his previous films, writer/director Jim Jarmusch (Dead Man) seemed to
take great pride in fusing different cultures together, and Ghost Dog:
The Way of the Samurai is certainly no different.  The picture stars
Forest Whitaker (Light it Up) as the titular Ghost Dog, a stealthy
hit-man that follows an ancient Samurai code while working for New
Jersey mobsters.  Ghost Dog gives its protagonist a best friend that
can't speak English and features a blistering hip-hop score from Wu-Tang
Clan's RZA.
While that description may make Ghost Dog sound like a mess of a film,
it remains pleasantly simple.  Ghost Dog is a withdrawn, ninja-like
loner that lives in a shack on the roof of a Jersey apartment building
with his pigeons.  He makes homemade weapons and burglary devices, and
follows a strict ethical code that he follows to the letter.  Constantly
reading and referring to `Hagakure: The Way of the Samurai,' an 18th
century Japanese code for warrior discipline, Ghost Dog insists on
communicating with his bosses solely through carrier pigeons and is paid
annually on the first day of autumn for the previous year's work.
How does a guy this quirky get hooked up with the mob, you ask?  Years
ago, a young Ghost Dog was saved during a beat-down by a gangster named
Louie (John Tormey, Kiss Me Guido), who took the pup under his wing (in
this scene, Ghost Dog is played by Damon Whitaker, Forest's younger
brother) and slowly entrusts him with bigger and bigger tasks.
On one particular job, Ghost Dog is told to `take care of' a mobster
named Handsome Frank (Richard Portnow, Howard Stern's dad in Private
Parts), who is boffing Louise (Tricia Vessey, The Alarmist), the red-hot
daughter of Vargo (Henry Silva, The End of Violence), the family's Don.
Ghost Dog follows through on the hit, but is caught off-guard by
Louise's presence at the scene.  Louise's cool demeanor and the fact
that she's reading `Rashomon' momentarily unnerves Ghost Dog and he
quickly splits, becoming a target of the Mafia's wrath for leaving a
witness to the hit.
Throw in Ghost Dog's odd relationships with a French-speaking ice cream
hawker and a young girl from the projects that shares his fondness for a
good read, and you've gotwell, you've got a Jarmusch film.  His work is
generally geared much more toward character development than they are
plot-driven, and Ghost Dog is no exception.  His Mafia characters are
almost cartoonish in nature, a point that the director emphasizes by
having the Don watch Felix the Cat, Woody Woodpecker, Itchy & Scratchy
and Betty Boop.
Jarmusch also uses quotes from `The Hagakure' as title card bumpers
between scenes.  The idea seems okay, but some of them are particularly
absurd .  Imagine you're enjoying a film and are hit with something like
`There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a
sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road.
But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still
get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be
perplexed, though you still get the same soaking.'  Dude, if I wanted to
use my brain, I would have stayed home and read a book.
Still, Jarmusch does wonders with the culture clash between gangster,
samurai and hip-hop.  One of the goons admits that Flava Flav is his
favorite rap star, quoting the Public Enemy second-fiddle with his tough
Jersey accent.  Cinematography wiz Robby Müller, who also worked on Dead
Man, gives Ghost Dog a dark, seedy look, and RZA's score is likely to be
one of the year's best.

Title
Review for Space Cowboys (2000)
Clint Eastwood has had a pretty spotty directorial record since he won
an Oscar for 1992's Unforgiven.  The movie about the bridges aside,
Eastwood has stayed behind the camera for two fantastic period films (A
Perfect World and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) and directed
himself in two modern-day duds (True Crime and Absolute Power).  So the
prospect of the leathery legend helming himself in another contemporary
picture didn't exactly have me racing to get to the theatre.
But Space Cowboys isn't too bad.  The film is about four geriatric,
ex-Air Force pilots who get blasted into space to repair a Russian
satellite that is even more decrepit than they are.  If you liked Walter
Matthau and Jack Lemmon volleying jokes back and forth about
incontinence and false teeth in Grumpy Old Men, then you'll probably
love Cowboys.  Since they don't even make it into space until the film's
final thirty minutes, Cowboys is more about the men training for their
mission than the actual space undertaking.
Cowboys' first section might be its best, which is kind of odd
considering the fact that none of the four stars appear in this part of
the film.  The studio's colorless logo leads into a black-and-white
scene set in 1958, where two Air Force test pilots from Team Daedalus
crash a $4 million X-2 experimental airplane (their third accident in
ten months).  Young actors portray the near-ambulatory stars, who supply
only their voices to this section of Cowboys, in which we learn that the
Air Force is handing over the task of space exploration to the
newly-founded NASA and their space monkey.
Flash to 1999, where old codger Frank Corvin (Eastwood) is approached by
two NASA representatives that need his prehistoric expertise.  It seems
that Ikon, a Russian communication satellite that was created using
Corvin's antiquated guidance system created for the Skylab project some
four decades earlier, is on a collision course with Earth, and NASA
needs the ex-pilot to tell them how to fix it.
Corvin refuses to help NASA unless they let his Team Daedalus
participate in the mission.  NASA reluctantly agrees, and Corvin rounds
up his old cohorts  maniacal pilot-turned-crop-duster `Hawk' Hawkins
(Tommy Lee Jones, Rules of Engagement); former navigator `Tank' Sullivan
(James Garner, My Fellow Americans), who is now a Baptist minister; and
Jerry O'Neil (Donald Sutherland, Instinct), a skirt-chasing roller
coaster designer with Coke-bottle glasses who was a structural engineer.
Like I said, most of the film concentrates on the flock of fossils
training for their big mission, and most of Cowboys' laughs come from
these scenes.  It's funny to watch them go through the
turn-your-head-and-cough drill during their physical, and there's a
pretty good recurring theme in which the geezers find out that pretty
much everyone they've ever worked with is dead.
Once Team Daedalus gets up into space, Cowboys turns into a predictable
cross between Armageddon and Mission to Mars.  There's the obligatory
`I'm gettin' to old for this' line, as well as a really creepy romance
between Hawk and a NASA engineer played by Marcia Gay Harden (Meet Joe
Black).  Both would have been better left on the editing room floor.
It's just plain weird to see the effect-heavy finale in an Eastwood
film, but it's handled pretty well.
Cowboys' script was written by Ken Kaufman (Muppets From Space) and
first-timer Howard Klausner.  Almost all of the technical aspects of the
film (editing, score, cinematography, production design) were handled by
a crew that has worked on all of Eastwood's recent films.  One
surprising omission from Cowboys is the absence of the Steve Miller Band
song that shares the same name as the film's title.
On an interesting note, there's a nineteen-year real-life age difference
between Team Daedalus' oldest and youngest member (Garner is 72; Jones
is 53).  Even thought they're supposed to be similarly aged, Garner was
in college while Jones was in diapers.  The math gets even crazier when
you figure that Garner, Eastwood (70) and Sutherland (66) were getting
bossed around by superiors that were a lot younger than them (The Green
Mile's James Cromwell is 60, and Knot's Landing's William Devane is 59,
but both played NASA men that were around back in '58).

Review for This Is My Father (1998/II)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
This film is supposedly a true story told to the filmmakers by their
grandmother.  If it was any other family besides the Quinns, nobody else
would ever have heard this emotional yarn, let alone crafted it into an
amazing picture.  This is My Father is writer/director Paul Quinn's
feature film debut.  His Oscar-winning cinematographer is brother Declan
(Leaving Las Vegas) and his star is brother Aidan (In Dreams).
The film opens in present-day Chicago, where a frustrated high school
teacher named Kieran Johnson James Caan, The Godfather) finds an old
photograph of his mother with a man that he has never seen.  His mother,
who is on her deathbed and unable to speak, has little information for
Kieran about the mystery man, but he feels that it may be an important
key to unlocking his family's past.  So he decides to take an extended
trip to Ireland, accompanied by his lazy teenage nephew, Jack Jacob
Tierney (Josh and S.A.M.).
Once in Ireland, Kieran and Jack slowly uncover the tragic story of
their forebearer's first love.  The film then flashes back about fifty
years, and Kieran's mom transforms from the bedridden granny into the
lovely Fiona Flynn (Moya Farrelly, who makes her screen debut here).
The mystery man in the old photo is Kieran O'Day (A.Quinn), a hopeless
romantic intent on making the much younger Fiona his wife.
The film is beautiful, both physically and emotionally.  Although Caan
does not have a huge role, it is the best he has been since The
Godfather. Aidan Quinn is also great, almost making you forget about
every other horrible movie he has made in the last year (remember
Practical Magic?).  And what would an Irish film be without the presence
of Brendan Gleeson (The General), Colm Meaney (Monument Ave.) and
Stephen Rea (Still Crazy).  The odd casting is that of John Cusack
(Pushing Tin) in the throwaway part of a Life magazine photographer who
- you guessed it - took the old snapshot that Kieran finds many years
later.  (1:58  R for adult situations, brief nudity, adult language and

Title
Review for Message in a Bottle (1999)
When Message in a Bottle opens, a single mom enjoys a jog on the beach
after sending her son off to spend time with the ex.  As she runs, she
notices a bottle jutting out of the compacted sand, looks around as if
she were on Candid Camera, and finally pulls it free.  Yup; just like
the song, there is a message inside.
The woman is Theresa Osbourne (Robin Wright Penn), a researcher for the
Chicago Tribune, and the letter moves her and her equally lovelorn
co-workers to tears.  It is, apparently, a letter written by a man that
had recently lost his wife and had written the message as some type of
bizarre sea catharsis.  And you know how chicks eat that stuff up.
Not able to put the memory of the message or the effect of its romantic
drivel out of her head, Theresa decides to track down the mystery man.
Now, mind you, she only knows a few things about him  he is a horrible
typist and he loves to use awful boat metaphors in his work.  The
newspaper then writes a brief human interest piece on the enigma of a
message in a bottle and, after receiving tons of responses, Theresa
winds up getting copies of two other letters similar in form and
content.
Together with the crack research staff of the Tribune (which resembles
something more like an expert FBI forensics team), Theresa tracks down
the author of her letters via a tiny stationery store in St. Claire,
North Carolina.  It seems that after all of these years, the store
employee still had the name and address of the guy who bought the
letterhead and had no qualms about giving it out.  His name is Garret
Blake (Kevin Costner), a boat-fixer-upper guy in St. Claire.  Theresa is
on the next flight to North Carolina.
Her first glimpse of Garret is down on the water as he works on
restoring a beautiful schooner.  As luck would have it, he is an
attractive man with big, strong, blue-collar hands, his only physical
defect being thinning hair (in real life, he would have been a Morley
Safer lookalike).  She feigns interest in the vessel and he invites her
to take a little sail with him.  Despite the fact that she was raised in
a land-locked state, Theresa never gets seasick during the one-hour
cruise.
The two spend the next three days together and end up falling in love
more quickly (and almost more unbelievably) than Leslie Nielsen and
Priscilla Presley in The Naked Gun.  Theresa discovers that Garret's
artist wife died after pregnancy complications.  Not quite over his
monumental loss, Garret hasn't quite had the heart to disturb any of his
late wife's belongings  their house is somewhat of a living shrine to
her memory.  Of course, none of this hinders Garret from trying to get
into Theresa's pants lickety-split.  At one point, he awkwardly asks `Do
you like meat?'  What a smooth talker!
Things progress predictably until the final reel, when things take a bit
of an unexpected twist and all but the numbest apathetic will have their
waterworks turned to full blast.  Penn and Costner have little
chemistry, but are individually inoffensive  she has great hair and he
has tight jeans (this may be a special clause in all of his contracts).
Acting-wise, Paul Newman is the only standout as Garret's crusty old
father.  He is much more effective as a weathered drunk than last year's
staggeringly hokey gumshoe in Twilight.
The filmmakers are no strangers to the tear-jerking medium  director
Luis Mandoki (When a Man Loves a Woman) and writer Gerald DiPego
(Phenomenon) etch a moderately light version of The English Patient,
with Oscar winner Gabriel Yared providing the score.  Based on a novel
by Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook), Message is warmly lensed by Caleb
Deschanel (Fly Away Home).  As a film it's mediocre, but as a chick
flick it's better than most.

Review for Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Musicals make my skin crawl, and Moulin Rouge made me hate that stupid genre
even more than I already did.  So I approached Hedwig and the Angry Inch
with great trepidation, even though the film had already garnered accolades
from numerous festivals around the world, including the Audience and
Director's Awards at Sundance.  But Dancer in the Dark took home the top
trophies at Cannes, so that shows you how much festival folks know about
musicals.
Rouge was everything Hedwig is not: annoying, pretentious, spastic and more
about the director than the characters.  Not only is it the best musical
I've ever seen, it's the best new film I've seen so far this year
(Apocalypse Now Redux doesn't count).  Hedwig's songs stuck with me for
days, and somebody will literally have to cause me bodily harm to harvest
the soundtrack from my CD player.
Granted, I'm not ready to run out to the store to buy The Sound of Music,
but I am ready to lavish writer/director/star John Cameron Mitchell with
heaps and heaps of over-the-top praise.  He stars as the eponymous Hedwig,
who we first see performing with his band (The Angry Inch) at a St Louis
restaurant before a handful of groupies and several dozen surprised dinner
patrons.  They're just not the typical entertainment you'd expect to see at
a family eatery, and Hedwig's shocking lyrics about his crazy adventures are
enough to redden even the most jaded cheeks.
Hedwig, we learn, is in the midst of a lawsuit pitting himself against
Rolling Stone Artist of the Year and MTV darling Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt,
Dawson's Creek).  The two were, at one time, in a very close relationship
that saw Hedwig pen the songs that made Tommy a star.  Not only did Tommy
kick Hedwig to the curb, he didn't credit him on his multi-platinum album,
either.  Hedwig's manager, Phyllis Stein (SCTV's Andrea Martin), has the
band following Tommy's sold-out tour around the country, but instead of
playing to packed arenas, they're stuck in a chain of Bilgewater's seafood
restaurants.
As Hedwig's tour continues, his songs (and occasional narration) explain his
life's story from his origin in East Germany through a botched sex change
operation (hence the title) prompted by a black sugar daddy (literally) and
a move to the United States.  The film is full of animation snippets (a la
Pink Floyd The Wall) that illustrate Hedwig's desire to find the perfect
life-mate and become a complete being.  He likens himself to the old,
divided Germany - incomplete and stuck in limbo between male and female.
Cameron, who could be Rachel Griffiths' twin brother, is completely
believable in this role, and some will be floored to learn he isn't really a
cross-dressing East German with a tiny lump of flesh where his penis used to
be.  Apparently, the inspiration for the film was a German babysitter
Cameron knew when he was a teenager in Kansas.  Years later, he created the
off-Broadway play that eventually became this film.  Even though he
performed as Hedwig for several years on stage, Cameron's performance is
still amazing, and his skills as a director should be commended, as well.
Hedwig could become America's newest sing-a-long cult musical, in the vein
of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  It's goofy and sincere, and I'm not sure
I've ever seen a film that is both to the degree that Hedwig is.  And the
music, which was written by Stephen Trask, is some of the best stuff you'll
hear this year, assuming you dig the whole T.Rex/Bowie/Iggy Pop/Lou Reed
thing (Bob Mould plays lead guitar on each number).

Review for Happy, Texas (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Basically a 90s twist on Some Like it Hot, high-profile Sundance
acquisition Happy, Texas is cute, lightweight and not unlike a big bowl
of Chinese food  damn enjoyable while you're wolfing it down, but
ultimately leaving an empty feeling in your belly an hour after you
consume it.  Here, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are replaced by Jeremy
Northam and Steve Zahn, and instead of posing as female musicians they
must pretend to be homosexual beauty pageant coordinators.
The film opens with three convicts chained together while on highway
clean-up detail.  There is a brainy one named Harry Sawyer (Northam, An
Ideal Husband), a brawny one named Bob (M.C. Gainey, ConAir) and a
goofy, short one named Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Zahn, You've Got Mail).
There is also a funny gag involving a dead armadillo (if you find dead
armadillos humorous) which leads to the three felons being driven back
to prison for punishment.  But their van crashes during a fight between
Wayne and Bob, and the jailbirds escape.
Bob heads in one direction while Harry and Wayne steal a recreational
vehicle from the parking lot of a convenience store gas station.  While
parked in the dark several miles later, they are picked up by Happy's
Town Sheriff Chappy Dent (William H. Macy, Mystery Men), who leads the
men into the courthouse packed with local officials.  Harry and Wayne
think they're about to be thrown back into the clink, while everybody
else assumes that they are David and Steven, the national beauty pageant
experts that Happy has hired to boost the chances of a local girl
qualifying for a state beauty pageant.  When the locals begin to
negotiate their salary, Harry and Wayne think that their prison sentence
is being haggled.  Hilarity ensues.
The cons plan on picking up their fee in the morning and skipping town,
but the observant Harry overhears the potential for a bigger score while
waiting in line at the town bank.  In two weeks, local farmers will cash
giant checks for the year's harvest, meaning the bank will have a ton of
cash ripe for misappropriation.  So Harry and Wayne decide to stick it
out and pretend to be the pageant pros, thinking that watching teen-aged
girls prance around in leotards may not be a bad way to spend some time
while laying low.
Surprise No. 1 comes when they find out that the contestants in the
Little Miss Fresh Squeezed Pre-Teen Talent Competition are about half
the age they expected.  Surprise No. 2 comes when they find out that the
guys they're impersonating are a gay couple.  The whole town of Happy
thinks the manly jailbirds are in a relationship and they have no choice
but to play along.  Apparently above the usual opinionated views that
small-town Southerners may have about alternative lifestyles, the
residents of Happy embrace Harry and David as celebrities, acknowledging
their obvious talent for pizzazz by admitting `They're crafty that way.'
Things proceed predictably from here, with Harry beginning to con the
relationship-phobic banker (Ally Walker, Profiler) and eventually
falling for her, while Wayne is stuck with the talentless kids, forced
to learn how to sew and dance.  Not to be outquirked, Sheriff Chappy
even has a sexual identity crisis.
Prior to the screening of this film at the Toronto International Film
Festival, first-time director and co-writer Mark Illsley (who was the
assistant on Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) explained that about fifteen
to twenty minutes of footage was reshot and inserted into the film after
it played the Sundance Film Festival (where Zahn earned special acting
honors).  It appeared to me that most of the new scenes center around
the relationship between Harry and the banker, which is too bad because
I would have preferred to see more of the pageant preparation (Zahn) and
less of the romance.  You could also tell new footage from the old by
Zahn's disappearing soul patch (the hair right under his bottom lip).
But the film is still a blast to watch, if not just for the wonderful
actors involved in the project (Zahn took home a special acting award
from Sundance), who reportedly all worked for scale.

Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
It's one thing for an actor or an actress to pump out several films over
a short period of time, but it's something else entirely when a director
tries to tackle a similar task.  And to have the films rank among the
best of that period is a true testament to the director's talent.
In just over two years (twenty-five months, to be exact), director
Steven Soderbergh has released Out of Sight, The Limey and his latest
film, Erin Brockovich - a true story about a single mom that led the
fight against a utility company which ultimately culminated in the
largest settlement in a direct class-action lawsuit in U.S. history.
Fans of Soderbergh, whose first film (Cannes winner sex, lies &
videotape) is widely recognized as launching the renaissance of American
independent film, may be surprised to see the director filming what
appears to be a glossy Hollywood courtroom drama with a predictably
linear story and a larger-than-life female star (Julia Roberts).
Although he's treading in all-too-familiar territory that isn't at all
familiar to him, Soderbergh has crafted yet another winner with
Brockovich, directing Roberts to her best performance yet.  In fact,
she's so good that it's a surprise that Universal didn't hold
Brockovich's release until the end of the year  a season typically
reserved for films competing for major year-end awards.  Perhaps the
studio couldn't help releasing the film on St. Patrick's Day, so that
some crafty critic could whimsically declare `Go See Erin
go-Brock-ovich.'
Roberts (Runaway Bride) stars as the titular Brockovich, a single L.A.
mom with three kids, a roach-infested house, big hair, high heels, short
skirts and low-cut tops.  She has a beat-up Hyundai, empty cupboards,
two deadbeat ex-husbands, no money, no job, no education and a wicked
case of sass-mouth.  The only thing this former Miss Wichita has going
for her are her good looks and killer rack, but even they can't help
Erin secure a settlement when she's broadsided by a doctor that runs a
red light and creams her vehicle.  With no insurance, Erin finds herself
$17,000 in debt.
Desperate to find work, Erin turns to the attorney that handled her auto
accident.  She guilts Ed Masry (Albert Finney, Simpatico) into hiring
her as a file clerk at his tiny, private law firm where, almost by
chance, Erin stumbles onto a real estate file containing some ominous
medical data concerning a giant utility company.  Despite not knowing a
lick about the law, Erin does some digging and finds out that Pacific
Gas & Electric knowingly poisoned the water of a Mojave Desert burg
called Hinkley.  Through hard work, perseverance and a bunch of dumb
luck, she's able to piece together a case against PG&E, signing up over
six hundred plaintiffs in the process.  The result is a battle between
the $28 billion company and Roberts' $20 million smile (and who would
you put your money on?).
As Erin's life becomes consumed by the Hinkley case, she begins to
neglect her own family, leaning heavily on her new biker boyfriend
George (a nearly unrecognizable Aaron Eckhart, Any Given Sunday).  But
she believes that the sacrifice is worth missing big chunks of her
children's lives.  For the first time, Erin feels like she is making a
difference, befriending many of the Hinkley plaintiffs, including
struggling mothers Marg Helgenberger (Species 2), Cherry Jones (Cradle
Will Rock) and Mimi Kennedy (Dharma & Greg).
Soderbergh doesn't bog the film down with courtroom scenes, which makes
the two-plus-hour film seem to fly by.  The director used his brilliant
cohorts - Sight editor Anne V. Coates and Limey cinematographer Edward
Lachman - to film the Susannah Grant (Ever After) script, which,
although extremely conventional, is well-written, fresh and often very
funny.  Some interesting casting  the real Brockovich plays a diner
waitress in an early scene (her name tag says `Julia'), producer Michael
Shamberg plays a PG&E lawyer, and Judge Leroy A. Simmons, the judge that
handed down the 1993 decision that allowed the real-life suit to
proceed, plays himself.

Review for Love's Labour's Lost (2000)
I'm all for people attempting to make Shakespeare more accessible to the
masses, but I draw the line at Love's Labour's Lost.  Kenneth Branagh's
fourth adaptation of the Bard (four and a half if you count A
Midwinter's Tale) tries to do way too much with what is arguably
Shakespeare's weakest play.
There are several things a filmmaker can do to liven up Shakespeare and
make his work more appealing to Betty and Ron Normalson of Wheeling,
West Virginia.  The first and most obvious is changing the setting, like
in Michael Almereyda's inspiring new version of Hamlet, which takes
place in present-day New York City.  An ambitious filmmaker can even
raise an eyebrow by casting acting talent that you wouldn't normally
associate with Shakespeare, like Branagh did with 1993's Much Ado About
Nothing, which featured Denzel Washington and the Razzie-nominated Keanu
Reeves.
Branagh does both of these here, as Lost is set in pre-World War II
Navarre, a small county outside of France, and features performances
from borderline Gen-Y talents Alicia Silverstone (Blast From the Past)
and Matthew Lillard (S.L.C. Punk).  But things go awry by the presence
of about ten song-and-dance numbers from the likes of Irving Berlin,
Cole Porter, Rogers & Hammerstein and the Gershwin brothers.  And when
the characters aren't singing, they're wrapped up in what appears to be
a zany screwball comedy from the 30s, full of silly pratfalls,
double-takes and exaggerated, slack-jawed facial expressions.  There's a
reason that vaudeville died, but nobody seems to have told Branagh.
The story is about The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola, Timecode) and
his three horny buddies, Berowne (Branagh), Longaville (Lillard) and
Dumaine (Adrian Lester, Primary Colors), who decide that war is for
sissies and make an agreement to hole up for three years, depriving
themselves of women, food and sleep to study philosophy.  Their plans
are interrupted by the arrival of a French princess (Silverstone) and
her three horny friends Rosaline (Natascha McElhone, Ronin), Maria
(Carmen Ejogo, The Avengers) and Katherine (Emily Mortimer, Scream 3).
They sing, they dance, they fall in love, and I went home.  End of
story.  Oh, and then I had lunch.
There are also a lot of annoying supporting roles that made me want to
leave the theatre and run over someone's dog.  Each actor seemed to be
in a contest to see who could `out-ham' the next, and as a result, Lost
plays like a silly parody.  But I don't think it's supposed to be, which
just makes the whole thing laughably sad.  Particularly annoying are
Nathan Lane (Isn't She Great) and Timothy Spall, the latter of whom was
so likeable in Topsy-Turvy.
I've heard people complain about the quality of the singing and the
dancing of the actors, but I thought it was pretty commendable, with
Lester a notable standout.  It's certainly a lot better than I could do,
or would even be willing to do.  It's a risky move that unfortunately
doesn't pay off here.
Branagh deserves credit for his ambition, but little else.  He's been
nominated for three Oscars (writing and acting) in his Shakespeare
adaptations, but only when he sticks to the serious plays (Hamlet and
Henry V).  Most of Hamlet's crew is on board here as well, with
cinematographer Alex Thomson, editor Neil Farrell, production designer
Tim Harvey and composer Patrick Doyle (who was nominated for Hamlet)
contributing to the overall look, feel and sound of a 30s musical.

Review for Hearts in Atlantis (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved. 
With his last two films - Shine and Snow Falling on Cedars - Australian 
director Scott Hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the 
best out there, and his latest, Hearts in Atlantis, is no different.  Its 
structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in 
the middle - is similar to The Green Mile, which is a bit ironic considering 
both were based on Stephen King books.  The parallels don't end there, 
either.  Atlantis was adapted by William Goldman, who had previously penned 
the big-screen version of Misery and is in the process of working on the 
script for King's Dreamcatcher.  Even the film's content is a bit 
reminiscent of Mile.  In fact, it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s 
nostalgia of Stand By Me (also by King) and mystical power hokum of Mile. 
King's Atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories, but the 
main focus here is on the first (and longest) tale, called Low Men in Yellow 
Coats (the film's title comes from the second chapter).  It's set in 1960 
Harwich, Connecticut, where 11-year-old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) lives 
in a boarding house run by his cold, self-centered mother Elizabeth (Hope 
Davis, Joe Gould's Secret), who seems to care more about her wardrobe than 
her son.  Bobby spends his time with his two closest friends, John Sullivan 
(Will Rothhaar) and tomboy Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem), who become something 
like the Kevin, Paul and Winnie of Harwich. 
When a new tenant moves into the vacant room, the fatherless Bobby finds a 
male role model in Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins, Hannibal), a mysterious 
stranger who is vague enough about his past to make Bobby's mom suspicious 
enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror.  Ted 
teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature (after his 
cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday), dispenses 
prophetic words of wisdom and even pays Bobby one dollar a week to read him 
the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the Low Men, a group of 
people chasing Ted to exploit his special powers.  I won't go into what 
these powers are, but they're considerably toned down from the book (and 
don't involve black stuff flying out of Ted's mouth, a la Mile). 
Atlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the 
novel's final chapter, titled Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling, and 
features David Morse (in yet another connection to The Green Mile) as a 
married, middle-aged Bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood 
friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his 
formative years. 
Atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as Hicks' Cedars, which is disappointing 
but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing Robert 
Richardson to the occasionally amazing Piotr Sobocinski, the Oscar-nominated 
cinematographer behind Krzysztof Kieslowski's Red.  The acting is solid from 
everyone, including Hopkins, who never once makes you think of Dr. Lecter. 
Most impressive are youngsters Yelchin and Boorem, who both had tiny parts 
in Along Came a Spider. 
While I didn't really have much of a problem with Goldman's screenplay, I do 
need to point out at least one inconsistency.  Goldman, for those of you who 
don't read Premiere, writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody 
else's films, carefully explaining why they all suck, make no sense and 
insult their audiences, while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's 
penned (like The General's Daughter).  It's mean-spirited but fun to read, 
mostly on account of nobody else in Hollywood having the balls to say 
anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business (including 
Michael Jackson, O.J. and Robert Blake).  In Atlantis, which is supposed to 
be told through the eyes of young Bobby, one would assume he would have to 
be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back. Well, 
he's not, and it doesn't make sense.

Review for Pushing Tin (1999)
A group of men emerge from a giant warehouse, their eyes obscured by
dark sunglasses.  No, it's not one of those Ray Ban commercials with the
vampires  it's Pushing Tin, a film about a group of over-stressed,
bleary-eyed New York air traffic controllers, working the most crowded
air space in the world.  The name comes from the vocational slang for
when a controller is landing planes at a higher-than-average rate, or
`pushing tin.'
John Cusack (Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil) stars as Nick `the
Zone' Falzone, the fast-talking, efficient leader of the group who finds
his life thrown into upheaval when his bosses hire another alpha-male,
Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton, A Simple Plan), to work alongside
him.  Bell's tag as `an interesting guy' and Zen attitude toward his job
and personal life brings out all of Falzone's insecurities.  Plus, Bell
has a really hot wife (Angelina Jolie, Gia).  Before you know it,
Falzone is reduced to a simpering idiot.
You would expect more from a film with this pedigree.  Director Mike
Newell (Donnie Brasco) has a more-than-decent track record, and the
acting talent is first-class (three Oscar nominations and two Golden
Globe wins in the last three years).  The big problem is with the
predictable script, which was adapted from Darcy Frey's magazine article
titled `Something's Got to Give' and is the first film adapted for the
screen by Cheers creators Glen and Les Charles.  Tin also features a
bizarre subplot focusing on Falzone's lone female coworker (Vicki Lewis,
NewsRadio) and her aspiring bodybuilding career.

Review for Urban Legends: Final Cut (2000)
Usually, Hollywood will only make sequels of films that make a ton of
money.  Urban Legends grossed an inauspicious $38 million when it was
released on the far superior heels of Scream and I Know What You Did
Last Summer.  Almost exactly two years later, its sequel  Urban
Legends: Final Cut (or UL2)  hits the screen with a lamer story and
much fewer stars than its predecessor.
Before we get into the content of the movie, let's look at the title.
Although it's an attempted clever play on words, Final Cut makes the
sequel seem like it's simply an unedited version of the first film.  And
don't think for a second Final Cut implies that it will be the last film
in the series.  We've been fooled before.  Remember Friday the 13th: The
Final Chapter?  It was followed up by Friday the 13th: A New Beginning.
Later, we saw Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday, but there's still
another sequel in the works.
Ditto for A Nightmare on Elm Street, which promised Freddy's Dead: The
Final Nightmare, but then came back with New Nightmare.  In the future,
we can probably expect titles like I Finally Forgot What You Did That
Summer followed by I Just Remembered What You Did, Like, Seven Summers
Ago.  Or The Slasher VI: We Swear to Christ It's the Last One and The
Slasher VII: We're Broke, and We're Back!
UL2 is set at Alpine University's film school, which apparently
specializes in churning out horror film directors (this is the only
truly frightening idea in the entire picture).  The professor advises
his students that the screenplays for their final projects are due,
which is odd, because some of them have already completed their films.
Amy Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison, Stir of Echoes), the daughter of an
Oscar winning documentary filmmaker, pitches the professor an idea of
filming the story of a serial killer that slays his victims to popular
urban legends.  The same urban legend killings that occurred in first
film
So UL2 is a sequel about a making a movie about what happened in the
sequel's antecedent.  Confused?  You shouldn't be.  You've already seen
the exact same thing in Scream 2 and Scream 3.  UL2 is full of scenes
featuring film props and sets that create a blurry line between the
movie and the movie within the movie.
The common belief among the surviving characters is that the killer is a
crazy film student bumping off his competition for the school's
prestigious Hitchcock Award (in addition to Hitch, UL2 has the audacity
to sully the names of François Truffaut and Pam Grier).  The
knife-wielding maniac dresses in black and wears either a fencing mask,
or a large kitchen strainer.  It's hard to tell.
The only returning character from the first film (save a surprise cameo
right before the closing credits) is the campus security guard played by
Loretta Devine (Introducing Dorothy Dandridge).  UL2 also features Joey
Lawrence from Blossom, although he prefers to go by `Joseph' now.  Yeah,
I guess you need to be taken more seriously when you make films like
this.
UL2 is the directorial debut of John Ottman, who edited and created the
score for Bryan Singer's (X-Men) first three films (he also scored and
edited this film).  The script was written by Hellraiser 5 scribes, Paul
Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson.  Ironically, Ottman, Boardman and
Derrickson were classmates at the USC School of Cinema-Television.  I
wonder where they got the idea for this film?
There was a strange bar scene in UL2 where a female student, played by
Real World London star Jacinda Barrett, tells a fellow college senior,
`Next year, you'll be in the real world.'  I have no idea if this was
intentional, or just a bizarre coincidence.  It doesn't really matter,
since UL2 is largely a waste of time and money.  You'd be better off
reading about urban legends on Snopes.

Review for Fallen (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Let's face it, any movie about a serial killer released in the next few
years is going to draw unfair comparisons to `Se7en'.  And why shouldn't
they?  It's only the Holy Grail of the genre.  Like `Silence of the
Lambs' was to the early 90's, `Se7en' will be to the late 90's and maybe
beyond.  Many movies strive to be as dark, unnerving and stylistic and
most fail.  With that said, `Fallen' is the closest thing I've seen so
far.
If you've seen the trailer, you get the basic story:  Detective John
Hobbes (Washington) is responsible for catching an evil serial killer
and is about to witness his execution.  As the killer dies, his soul
floats out of his body into an unsuspecting prison guard.  The trick is
that the soul can pass from person to person through any casual contact
(not unlike herpes). The `host' of the soul sings or hums or whistles
the Rolling Stones classic `Time Is On My Side', so that Hobbes (and the
slow viewer) can catch on that he's not really dead.
Hobbes gets no help from crusty Lieutenant Stanton (Sutherland) and
turns to Gretta Milano (Davidtz), the daughter of a suspiciously
deceased old cop, who turns him on to the biblical meaning of it all.
And wouldn't you know it, the more he finds out about this travelling
soul, the more he realizes that it will be impossible to stop it.  Duh!
The movie has a great look to it, mostly in part to Newton Thomas Sigel
(`The Usual Suspects').  It's dark and somewhat stylistic, but not quite
unnerving.  When you see through the eyes of the killer, everything gets
dark and discolored and warped (`Fincher-Vision'). And there's a very
impressive scene where the soul is chasing Milano down a busy sidewalk,
flinging itself from host to host in an attempt to catch her.
Washington plays Hobbes pretty much the same as his `Ricochet' cop
character.  John Goodman gets all of the good one liners (including my
revised tag line). Davidtz (Miss Honey in `Matilda') does what she can
with a pretty skimpy part.  Most of the best acting actually comes from
the people who briefly host the demon soul.  Their creepy grins and
singing are one of the really cool parts of this film.

Title
Review for Woman on Top (1999)
It's a surprise to find out that Woman on Top isn't a student film made
by a couple of horny frat boys.  The picture is amateurish and uneven,
and its female lead has giant breasts and a tiny waist.  And in case she
wasn't desirable enough already, the character is a fantastic cook,
too.  The only thing keeping her from becoming a man's idea of the
perfect woman is the fact that she isn't a mute.
It's even a bigger surprise to find out that Woman was written and
directed by two women.  The film is about a young Brazilian lady named
Isabella Oliveira (Penélope Cruz, All About My Mother) who, as a child,
developed a severe case of motion sickness.  Her unique disease kept
Isabella in the kitchen, where she learned the intricacies of South
American cuisine from the family maid.  Eventually, Isabella landed a
job as a chef in a local restaurant owned by Toninho, the fisherman that
became her husband (Murilo Benício, Orefu).
Still suffering from motion sickness as an adult, Isabella has to assume
control (or be `on top') of every situation, whether is driving, dancing
or having sex.  But the man-on-bottom sexual position is too much for
Toninho to handle, and he begins seeking satisfaction from other
sources.  Isabella catches him, and hightails it to San Francisco where
she plans on moving in with a cross-dressing Brazilian friend named
Monica (Harold Perrineau Jr., OZ).  Call me crazy, but if somebody told
me that I could marry Penélope Cruz, but couldn't ever have sex in the
man-on-top missionary position, it would only take me about two seconds
to accept the offer.
In San Francisco, Isabella has the typical cinematic rags-to-riches
journey.  She's unable to find work as a chef, but lands a teaching job
at a culinary school.  Her first class features an erotic lesson about
the passion of peppers, and afterwards, Isabella runs home to rub a
photograph of Toninho all over her chest and crotch.  Yup  we're
talking about one strong female role model, kiddies.
Isabella's teaching gig and good looks earn the attention of every man
within a five-mile radius.  One of which is Cliff Lloyd (Mark
Feuerstein, Rules of Engagement), a television producer looking for a
slot to fill on his on-air schedule.  Long story short, Isabella winds
up hosting `Passion Food Live,' a popular cooking show with Monica (who
exclaims, `Holy Mary and Rhoda,' when she gets the news) as a sidekick.
Isabella begins to fall for Cliff, but also finds herself constantly
pursued by Toninho.
The film tries to show men becoming bedazzled by Isabella's cooking
skills, but they're really just a bunch of horny guys stepping on their
tongues while they follow a hot babe around.  They don't give a crap
about what she's cooking (the only time one of them tastes something
she's made, he burns his mouth), but seem to be hanging around for the
chef to make double entendres about round coconuts and firm, ripe
tomatoes.
Woman was penned by debut screenwriter Vera Blasi and directed by Fina
Torres (Celestial Clockwork).  Failing to entertain in the slightest,
the least the film should do is make you hungry (like Big Night), but it
doesn't even accomplish that.  You don't even know which guy you should
be rooting for to win Isabella's hand.  With the burgeoning popularity
of the Food Network and charismatic chefs like Emeril Lagasse, the film
may have sounded like a good idea on paper, but in practice, Woman is
just bad filmmaking.

Review for Before Night Falls (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Since when did the holiday season become the time of year to reflect on
tortured artists? If you don't believe me, look at the films released in
New York and Los Angeles between Thanksgiving and Christmas. They're all
there - Marquis de Sade, Jackson Pollock, Francisco Goya and to a lesser
extent, State and Main's Joseph Turner White, Finding Forrester's Jamal
Wallace, and Shadow of the Vampire's F.W. Murnau. It's enough to drive
moviegoers to The Grinch or The Family Man.
Just when you thought Cuban popularity had gone the way of Men at Work
and Crocodile Dundee, Before Night Falls blends the Caribbean "It"
island of the moment with the angst-ridden story of an artist that just
begs for a December release. What's stranger is that Falls is co-written
and directed by a sculptor/painter (Julian Schnabel) whose only other
film experience was helming another film about a tortured artist
(Basquiat).
Luckily, Falls is much, much better than the critically over-praised
Basquiat. The leap in Schnabel's style between the two films is nothing
short of astonishing. Falls is beautifully shot and exceptionally well
put together, with Schnabel using numerous cinematic techniques, usually
to perfection. Parts of the film share the same gritty, washed-out look
of the Mexican portion of Traffic - so much so that you expect to see
Benicio del Toro make an appearance (or maybe it's the fact that he's
in, like, every movie). Schnabel also makes great use of music in lieu
of dialogue in several scenes.
On the negative side of things, the story of Jean Michel Basquiat was
more interesting than that of Falls' Reinaldo Arenas. The film follows
Arenas' life from his infancy in 1943 Cuba to his 1980 death in New York
City. It's tragic and all, but tragedy doesn't always equate with
entertainment (unless Kathie Lee Gifford's plane goes down over the
Rockies). Your potential enjoyment of the film will hinge on whether you
find the Arenas Chronicles to be remarkable or no different than any
other tale of a tortured artist.
We see a young Arenas carving poetry into a tree. We see an older Arenas
get a job at Cuba's National Library and join the rebels that eventually
put Castro into power. But, mostly, we see Arenas write and then die a
slow, painful death. Yeah, it's kind of interesting to see how he had to
share a bed as a child, and how he was persecuted because of his unique
ability as a writer, but we've seen this kind of thing before. Other
than Schnabel's direction, three superstar cameos (one from Sean Penn
and two from Johnny Depp) and a pretty electrifying (but still a bit
over-hyped) performance from Javier Bardem (Almodovar's Live Flesh),
there's just nothing going on here.
Falls was based on Arenas' memoirs, which were turned into a screenplay
by Schnabel and debut scribes Cunningham O'Keefe and Lázaro Gómez
Carriles. The cinematography is pleasant, and Carter Burwell's (O
Brother, Where Art Thou?) effective score is bolstered by help from
Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed.

Review for Music of the Heart (1999)
Take your pick:  Music of the Heart is either the touching portrayal of
a real-life teacher and her uphill battle to teach urban children to
play the violin; or it's Mrs. Holland's Opus, a weepy, by-the-numbers
chick-flick that pushes all the right buttons.  I think it's somewhere
in between, but the wonderful performance by Meryl Streep is enough to
sway me a bit more toward the former.
Music's opening credits display photographs from the seemingly perfect
life of Roberta Guaspari (Meryl Streep, Dancing at Lughnasa).  We learn
that she is happily married to a naval officer and has two marvelous
sons.  When the credits end and the picture starts, Roberta is teary,
frazzled mess because her husband just left her.  She and her children,
Nick (Michael Angarano) and Lexi (Henry Dinhofer), are forced to move
from their suburban home.
Since she doesn't really have much professional experience other than
playing the violin, Roberta has a tough time finding a job until she
meets an old high school classmate named Brian Sinclair (Aidan Quinn, In
Dreams). Brian is amazed that Roberta isn't a concert violinist (her
college professor told her that she started playing too late) and refers
her to Janet Williams, an East Harlem school principal (Angela Bassett,
How Stella Got Her Groove Back) in need of a music teacher.
At first, Janet has no interest in hiring Roberta on account of her lack
of teaching experience, but changes her mind the next day when Roberta
wheels in her two fiddling kids to demonstrate the discipline that she
has taught them.  When Janet balks at the idea of the school being able
to afford violins for students, Roberta proudly chirps that she
purchased fifty to start a private program years ago.  Roberta is hired
on a temporary basis.
Once her classes start, Roberta finds herself in a younger version of
Sister Act  a class full of disorderly little kids that sword fight
with their bows and use the violin cases to simulate machine guns.
Other teachers are skeptical, resentful and distant, and she even finds
resistance in the parents of her students.  One angrily states that her
kid doesn't need to learn the music of `dead white men,' while another
calls the principal when Roberta's attempts at teaching discipline are
mistaken for downright cruelty.
Roberta and her students are able to pull off the big
make-it-or-break-it recital, earning the respect of parents and teachers
alike.  Flash to ten years later, where Roberta's program now
encompasses three area elementary schools and students must win a
lottery to enroll in her classes.  But ten days before their big annual
concert, she learns that the funding for her program will be slashed
from the next budget.
Music is a big career step for horrormeister Wes Craven (Scream), who
directs Pamela Gray's (A Walk on the Moon) script of the true story that
was originally the basis of a documentary.  I half expected to see
Freddie Krueger jump out from behind a desk at the school.  The film
also has horrible continuity, with cupboards open in one shot and
magically closed in the next, and the presence of 3D Doritos in a film
that is supposed to be set in the 1980s.  Who do they think they're
kidding?
While Music is considerably slowed down by both Roberta's romantic life
and her home remodeling, and the film's need to portray the peril of
inner-city life, Streep and the depth of her character shine like a
brightly polished fiddle.  As Roberta, she gets to constantly hammer
home the importance of practicing while warning her students that
they're `going to make your parents sick if you play like that.'  I
smell another Oscar nomination.

Review for King Is Alive, The (2000)

The fourth and final of the original Dogme 95 films, and the first to both
be shot outside Denmark and feature non-Danish acting talent, The King is
Alive is just as ambitious as its heavily hyped cinematic brethren, but like
the last two (Mifune and The Idiots), it just doesn't measure up to the
first (The Celebration). It does, however, come the closest.
[Dogme, in case you've been held captive in a multiplex for the last three
years, is the experimental Danish film aesthetic (created by that Dancer in
the Dark madman, Lars von Trier) that, among other things, demands directors
use handheld cameras and shoot their scenes sequentially while forbidding
the use of artificial lighting, sound (including music) and props.]
The film begins in the North African desert (it was shot in Namibia), where
a bus with ten international tourists hurtles through the barren, sandy
terrain. But the onboard compass is on the fritz, and the bus has traveled
several hundred miles off course before driver Moses (Vusi Kunene) notices.
To make matters worse, when the bus stops to refuel, it is discovered that
the giant petrol cans in the storage area are empty. The passengers now find
themselves stranded in an abandoned German mining town that offers only
shelter and a potentially crazy old man named Kanana (Peter Khubeke), who
narrates the film in Swahili (it's subtitled - don't panic).
Aussie passenger Jack (Miles Anderson), the only experienced outdoorsman of
the lot, decides to try his luck at hiking to the nearest town, which,
according to Kanana, is over 150 miles away. The remaining travelers choose
the houses they want to call home and have a big party their first night in
the middle of nowhere. But after several days pass with no word from Jack,
it becomes clear the vacationers might be in for an extended stay. They
survive on canned carrots abandoned by the Germans and dew (as in
condensation, not Mountain). Kind of makes the soupy rice from the Kucha
tribe sound pretty good, huh?
If you were stranded in an abandoned town, staging a production of King Lear
would probably be the furthest thing from your mind, but that's just what
Henry (David Bradley) decides the group should do to take their minds off
their potentially grave predicament. He knows Lear by heart and begins to
handwrite parts for his fellow castaways. The play, however, is merely the
catalyst for all of the wanton sex acts and post-coital jealousy you'd
expect in such a tiny community. Envy and lust run unchecked among the group
of seemingly self-destructive men, leaving the women in a rare leadership
role. Lear, at least according to strandee Liz (Janet McTeer, Tumbleweeds),
is the perfect play to produce because "nobody has to fall in love, and
everybody gets to die in the end."
This isn't the breathtaking desert we saw in The English Patient - it looks
like it could eat you alive when the sun goes down (in fact, if this was a
Hollywood film, something would probably be stalking them once it got dark).
Although The King is full of stark images and vivid colors, it looks its
best at night, when the group is gathered around their fire Director
Kristian Levring, who co-wrote the film with Mifune's Anders Thomas Jensen,
and his digital camera catch every flaw on the face of each actor's
weather-worn skin. It's as gritty as the Mexican portion of Traffic, but
with more color than yellow. There also seems to be more editing than the
previous Dogme films.
You could think of The King as a combination of The Blair Witch Project and
Survivor targeted toward a highbrow arthouse audience instead of the
teeming, unwashed masses. The film reminded me of so many other things -
Cast Away, The Lord of the Flies, Hitchcock's Lifeboat, Apocalypse Now -
that it's easy to think The King will follow one of their trajectories, but
it really doesn't.
The King was shot in the summer of 1999 and wrapped just a few days before
brilliant character actor Brion James, best known for his work in Blade
Runner, died of a heart attack. It's ironic that his character is the first
of the film's passengers to experience any type of physical ailment.
Although the acting here is more than solid, Jennifer Jason Leigh (eXistenZ)
and beautiful French actress Romane Bohringer are the standouts.

Review for Charlie's Angels (2000)
Say what you will about Hollywood churning out films based on old
television series, but Charlie's Angels might be the best female-led
chop-socky action flick to be produced in this country.  Not only is it
funny, but Angels' action sequences are just as good as any blockbuster
released this past summer.  And the whole package is covered with a
thick layer of cheese, which is a good thing, considering that a film
like this should be taken as seriously as a sequel to Battlefield Earth.
For those of you not old enough to remember the television show (I'm one
of them), Angels was about three sexy secret agents who worked for the
Charles Townsend Detective Agency.  The Angels (and viewers) never saw
Charlie, but he assigned their cases via phone calls to an intermediary
named Bosley, portrayed here by Bill Murray (Hamlet).  Cases were neatly
wrapped up each week, and the pistol-wielding Angels were always sure to
find themselves in another precarious predicament in exactly seven days'
time.
Here, the pistol-less Angels are played by Cameron Diaz (Any Given
Sunday), Drew Barrymore (Never Been Kissed) and Lucy Liu (Shanghai
Noon), who play, respectively, the brain, the muscle and the daredevil
of the outfit.  They're a giggly group of girls (think Powerpuff) who,
for some reason, are forced to assume secret identities to blend into
society.  Angels' opening credits show clips of each of the character's
childhood before launching into a hysterical montage of all things 70s.
The film's first big action sequence takes place on an airplane, where a
character played by LL Cool J (In Too Deep) discovers that a fellow
passenger has a bomb on board.  He grabs the terrorist and leaps out of
the plane's emergency exit, plummeting toward the choppy water below. We
later learn that the Cool J character is really Dylan (Barrymore) in a
latex mask and a voice alteration chip (a la Mission: Impossible). For
some strange reason, the film doesn't address how the petite Barrymore
is able to pass for the built Cool J, as if there wasn't much difference
between their body types.
Angels' story isn't anything to write home about.  The nerdy creator of
cutting-edge voice-recognition software (Sam Rockwell, The Green Mile)
has been kidnapped, and his partner (Kelly Lynch, Mr. Magoo) seems to
think that a maniacal satellite tycoon (Tim Curry) may be involved.  The
Angels take the case with their usual gusto, but quickly find out that
the assignment may be a little trickier than they thought.
The Angels have several run-ins with a nameless character played by
Crispin Glover (Nurse Betty), who has no lines, wields a cane like a
Bond baddie and fights like Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix.  Their
battles include many gravity-defying kicks, which look surprisingly
believable from Liu and Diaz (but not Barrymore).  Strangely, Liu has
landed in two of the best American action films of 2000 (this and
Shanghai Noon), but Diaz really steals the show as the gangly Natalie.
Barrymore does double duty as star and producer.
Angels is the feature film debut for McG, who has directed a bunch of
popular music videos and award-winning commercials.  He paces the film
well and adds a good mix of period music and modern rock, as well as the
obligatory hipped-up version of the original theme song.  The best part
about the film is that it never takes itself too seriously (they mock
television-series-turned-feature-films in one scene) and, as a result,
it looks like everybody had a blast making the movie (the closing
credits include some funny outtakes).

Review for Me Myself I (1999)
Ever wonder how your life would have turned out if you had done a few
things differently in the past?  That question serves as the basis for
Pip Karmel's directorial debut called Me Myself I (not to be confused
with the upcoming Farrelly brothers/Jim Carrey gag-fest Me, Myself &
Irene).  Karmel's main character is a single woman that wonders where
she would be today if she had only accepted her high school sweetheart's
marriage proposal some thirteen years ago.
Rachel Griffiths (Oscar nominee for Hilary & Jackie) plays Pamela Drury,
an award-winning journalist known for hard-hitting magazine features.
As the film opens, Pamela has just given up smoking, found out that her
new crush is married, and received a male strip-o-gram from her
co-workers for her thirtieth birthday.  The combination of these events,
together with the nearly audible sound of her biological clock ticking,
drives Pamela to go home, get blasted and look at photographs of her Mr.
Right, Robert Dickson (David Roberts)  the guy she turned down several
years ago.
The next day, Pamela is hit by a car.  Her injuries are limited to a
bumped head, but when she comes to, Pamela notices that the car was
being driven by her apparent doppelganger.  They go to the twin's house,
where Pamela #1 learns that her twin isn't Pamela Drury #2, but Pamela
Dickson, an alter ego that said yes to her old boyfriend's marriage
proposal and squeezed out three of his kids.  Before she can get her
bearings, the doppelganger disappears, leaving Pamela #1 alone in the
house just as the kids are coming home from school.
Realizing that the double is gone and that the kids will obviously think
that she's their mother, Pamela is forced to switch gears and pretend to
be a happy housewife.  The trouble is that she doesn't know the first
thing about cooking, grocery shopping or carpooling, let alone the names
of her new children.  Things don't get any easier when Robert comes home
and Pamela has to figure out how to use a diaphragm.  I have a feeling
that this kind of thing happens to women all the time, which would
explain why they often seem like different people from day to day.
While Me Myself I may sound like a cross between Sliding Doors and
Freaky Friday, the film is actually quite well-written and deftly
executed.  Karmel, the Oscar-nominated editor of Shine, also wrote the
script for this first directorial effort.  Fellow Australian Griffiths
is very charismatic and, at times, resembles Juliette Binoche in both
appearance and demeanor.  The film is funny, touching and will probably
make you think of a few `what if' scenarios on the way home from the
theatre.

Review for Crew, The (2000)
Those hazy, crazy, lazy days of summer are sure taking their toll on
Hollywood.  Take a look at the stars they're slapping up on the screen.
Just this month, we've already seen four wrinkled asses in Space
Cowboys, four unhappily married comedians in The Original Kings of
Comedy and a fifty-year-old rubber suit yanked out of the mothballs for
an appearance in Godzilla 2000.  Yup, that's right - the bright,
powerful sun is actually aging Hollywood before our very eyes.
The latest offering of geriatric entertainment comes in the form of The
Crew, a blandly entertaining tale of four New Jersey wiseguys enjoying
their retirement in South Miami Beach.  Over the years, they've gone
from worrying about witnesses, snitches and moles, to making sure they
show up on time for the early bird special.  But The Crew isn't all
bingo and bladder jokes  there's also an asinine story involving drug
lords, crooked cops and family reunions.
More on that later.  First let's meet the four geezers:
Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds, Mystery, Alaska) earned his
nickname by maniacally wielding a baseball bat back in his Jersey
heyday.  Bats, who has eyebrows thicker and blacker than Star Jones, is
currently between jobs, but has been fired from most of the Burger King
restaurants in the greater Miami area.
Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya, Shaft) never worried about the condition in
which he left his victims in his previous line of work.  But now the
Brick (as in `dumb as a') fixes up the stiffs at a local mortuary.  The
Brick also keeps in touch with numerous retired mobsters from all over
the country.
Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss, Krippendorf's Tribe) doesn't have a
cool nickname, but he gets to narrate the story.  A Miami tour bus
driver, Bobby longs to find the daughter he lost contact with when he
was sent to the clink several years ago.  Don't worry, Bobby.  She'll be
easy to find.  There's only one female character in the film that comes
close to being your daughter's age.
Tony "The Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel, Max's father from Rushmore)
gives dancing lessons to the love-deprived senior citizens of South
Miami Beach.  Despite his nickname, the Mouth doesn't say much, except,
as it turns out, after he has sex.  Which is how the four codgers get
into trouble.
After The Crew introduces its characters, the Mouth blabs to a
prostitute about a phony hit he and his friends staged, and she
blackmails the men to whack her mother-in-law.  Like you'd expect,
things spiral out of control and wind up in a madcap, shoot-em-up
finale.  The best moment of the film is a send-up of GoodFellas, where
the four silver foxes are led through the kitchen of their favorite
restaurant while they greet each cook and waiter with a smile and a
nod.  Nobody at my packed screening seemed to make the connection, but
they all broke out in laughter and applause when the set piece reached
its inevitable conclusion.  Go figure.
The Crew was directed by Michael Dinner, a television director who
hasn't helmed a feature film since 1988's Bobcat Goldthwait stinker Hot
to Trot, which is widely regarded as on of the worst films of that
decade.  The mediocre script was penned by Barry Fanaro, who co-wrote
the much funnier Farrelly brother's flick, Kingpin.  In terms of
gangster flicks, it rates somewhere between GoodFellas and the
ill-advised spoof Mafia!, but that's kind of like saying a woman is less
attractive than Charlize Theron, but better looking than Janet Reno.
There's also a lot more nudity than you'd expect in a PG-13 film.

Review for Get Real (1998/I)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Hey, you!  Can you quickly name the three clichés that make up the basic
gay film?  The first is obvious  it has to be set in England.  The
second is a bit more subtle  the main character has to have a chubby
female friend that is just as alienated as he is.  The third is optional
 the film must be based on a play written by a guy with the last name
Wilde.
The Wilde in question is not Oscar, but Patrick, and Get Real is based
on his celebrated play What's Wrong With Angry?  The picture begins
promisingly, with a young protagonist Steven Carter (Ben Silverstone)
being forever turned off to both heterosexual activity and ice cream as
a friend incorrectly tells him how babies are made.
As a teenager, Steven appears to be like the rest of his Basingstoke
prep school classmates; his room has a desk and a computer, and its
walls are covered with photos of England's top football players.  The
dodgy student, who doesn't care for the sport, is reduced to ferreting
out potential mates at a varmint-infested bathhouse in the park.  One
day he stumbles upon the popular school jock, John Dixon (Brad Gorton),
who eventually falls for Steven but doesn't want to reveal his
alternative lifestyle to his mates or the rest of the school.
Feeling like it was filmed in (get) real time, the picture slowly winds
its way through sentiments not seen this side of soap operas and bad
after-school specials, finally culminating in the predictable big speech
where Steven outs himself in front of his parents and entire school.

Title
Review for Liam (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The very thought of a film about an Irish-Catholic family struggling to make
ends meet in pre-WWII Liverpool is enough to make some people lapse into an
Angela's Ashes-induced coma.  Leave it to director Stephen Frears to breathe
a bit of much-needed life into the gloomy, dreary genre of
early-20th-century films about dirt-poor drinking-class UK families living
in their own filth.
While he's probably best known by the U.S. masses for directing John Cusack
in High Fidelity and The Grifters, or perhaps for his frocky flicks like
Dangerous Liaisons and Mary Reilly, Frears spent a big chunk of the '90s
making the two oft overlooked sequels in Roddy Doyle's Barrytown Trilogy
(the first was Alan Parker's The Commitments).  Working with the Rabbittes
in The Snapper and The Van must have honed Frears' skills in directing films
about close-knit families - something that shows with his latest project,
Liam.
The winner of two awards at last year's Venice Film Festival, Liam begins on
New Year's Eve, where a happy mum (Claire Hackett) and dad (Ian Hart,
Aberdeen) celebrate at a local pub while their three kids watch them.
They're a cheery lot, with Dad bringing home the bacon after hours of
grueling labor at the local shipyard.  But when the Depression costs him his
job, the man slips into one deep funk.  It doesn't help that his two oldest
children have to get jobs to pay the bills.  Con (David Hart) follows in his
father's blue-collar footsteps, while Teresa (Megan Burns) cleans houses
after school.  Even though Dad has consistently given to the church
throughout the years, he refuses their handouts in this time of need.
Most of the film is told through the eyes of Liam (Anthony Borrows), a
stuttering seven-year-old who has had the fear of God beaten into him by a
dominating Catholic-school priest (Russell Dixon).  The film's humor comes
via Liam's complete fear of religion and the consequences of committing the
tiniest sin.  Borrows, like most of the actors in the film (other than
Hart), has no acting experience, but does a remarkable job as his character
watches his family life disintegrate.  The finale is unbelievably tragic.
Liam was written by Jimmy McGovern, a working-class Brit who penned the
controversial Priest as well as the extremely dark television series Cracker
(both the U.S. and British versions).  The film is a bit of an emotional
biography for McGovern (as Frears explained after the world premiere of the
film at the Toronto International Film Festival), and it's not at all a
biopic about the lead singer of Oasis, you silly sod.

Title
Review for Ressources humaines (1999)
Laurent Cantet's Human Resources is an interesting working-class drama
set in a small French town where most of the citizens are employed by
one factory.  Home from a Parisian college, Franck (Jalil Lespert, Sade)
lands a summer internship in the factory's personnel department.  His
father (Jean-Claude Vallod) is proud of his son, but Franck's friends
see him as a sellout.
Franck quickly finds himself in the middle of a battle between
management and the union.  At issue is the implementation of a 35-hour
workweek, an issue vehemently despised by the union but hailed by the
bosses as an end to the factory's financial troubles.  In an attempt to
appease both sides, Franck suggests a referendum be given directly to
the factory's employees, drawing the ire of the union and their
firecracker representative, Danielle Arnoux (Danielle Mélador).
Franck is caught between a rock and a hard place.  He has strong ties to
the blue-collar community (his dad has been a factory employee for 30
years), but at the same time, he wants to please his new bosses, and
even feels a twinge of embarrassment about his working-class roots.
Human Resources is about Franck's internal struggle, which is akin to
Bud Fox's ordeal in Wall Street.
The only professional actor in Resources is Lespert  the rest of the
cast were actual factory workers found in the town Resources used as its
gloomy backdrop (it's the town upon which the sun forgot to shine).  The
film was co-written by Gilles Marchand, who penned the America-bound
French blockbuster, Harry, He's Here to Help.

Title
Review for Joy Ride (2001/I)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If director John Dahl has a forté, it's his ability to take a story
featuring backwoods cops, seedy desert motels, filthy truck stops and dimly
lit bars full of lowlifes and make it enormously entertaining.  He also has
an uncanny knack for taking marginal B and C-list talent and making them
seem like Oscar contenders, even though the material is more akin to stuff
you'd find in a made-for-cable movie.
Actually, Dahl's two best films - Red Rock West and The Last Seduction -
debuted on pay cable, a medium that is taken slightly less seriously than
Tara Reid's chances of winning an Oscar.  The Academy doesn't even let films
like these qualify for their little year-end party, which was a shame
because Seduction's Linda Fiorentino deserved a Best Actress nomination (she
won the Independent Spirit Award, as well as trophies from critics in London
and New York).
But Joy Ride is a different story...or is it?  The film is getting a wide
release from a major distributor, but it's still set in the desert and is
populated by the same small-town cretins we grew to lovingly despise in West
and Seduction.  There are no big stars here, and there are barely any little
ones, either.  And the scariest thing of all is that Ride has been sitting
on the shelf nearly as long as O, the monumentally delayed modern update of
Othello (filming wrapped in early 2000).
But Ride is a surprisingly good little flick.  It's about a straight-laced
Berkeley student named Lewis (Paul Walker, The Fast and the Furious) who has
a crush on a girl from his New Jersey hometown.  Lewis buys a used car to
pick up Venna (Leelee Sobieski, Here on Earth) in Boulder, hoping the two
will bond during the cross-country drive.  But right before he leaves, Lewis
finds out his older brother Fuller (Steve Zahn, Saving Silverman) has just
been busted for a DUI in Salt Lake City.  No problem - Salt Lake City is on
the way to Boulder, so Lewis bails Fuller out and agrees to drive him as far
as Denver.
Grateful for the bail and ride, Fuller buys Lewis a CB radio so the two can
monitor police activity as they speed through the dusty west. Saying the CB
is like "a prehistoric internet," the bored Fuller talks his brother into
impersonating a woman to lure a desperate-sounding trucker with the handle
"Rusty Nail" to a hotel room with the promise of a good time.  The boys stay
in the room next-door and listen like a couple of giggling schoolgirls
before falling asleep.
They awaken to a grisly scene in the next room and shortly thereafter find
out Rusty Nail (voiced by Matthew Kimbrough) knows who they are and is
hell-bent on revenge.  Dahl expertly ratchets up the tension into an
edge-of-your-seat frenzy that only gets the slightest bit silly when Rusty
Nail's truck is trying to run them down (it's too much like Christine,
Jeepers Creepers or that dopey Metallica video).  Dahl never shows us what
Rusty Nail looks like, which helps to make the story all the more
disturbing.
It's a pretty simple idea, but the whole thing is brought to life by Ride's
two screenwriters, who have each directed enjoyable television shows (Clay
Tarver, Upright Citizens Brigade and Jeffrey Abrams, Felicity).  Like Dahl's
previous films, he gets great performances from his actors, too.  Walker
shows his decent performance in Furious wasn't a fluke (although I'm still
not entirely convinced - he's way too pretty to be any good, right?) and
even gets naked with Zahn for one scene.

Review for American Movie (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Who hasn't dreamed of becoming a filmmaker?  Of receiving a standing
ovation after screening your film for the first time?  Of accepting your
first Oscar while Jack Nicholson flashes you a smile and a thumbs-up?
If you have, then American Movie will bring those dreams crashing down
to reality.  It's a hilarious documentary that follows a struggling
young filmmaker's attempt to complete a black-and-white horror short
about zombies.
The aspiring Spielberg is Mark Borchardt, a high-school dropout from the
blue-collar Wisconsin suburb Menominee Falls.  He has a paper route and
three kids.  He's a greasy metal-head with long hair, thick glasses and
bad facial hair.  His brother fears that Mark is more suited to becoming
a stalker or serial killer than a filmmaker, perhaps fearing that he
could be a victim.  Mark even pronounces the name of the film he's
making incorrectly.  It's Cöven, but Mark says `COH-vin.'  He explains
that the correct pronunciation of the word `coven' sounds just like the
word `oven,' and that can't be right.  Mark sees Cöven as a cash-cow
project that will allow him to fund his dream project  a feature film
about his hometown called Northwestern.  He plans to sell 3,000 Cöven
videos at $15 each.  Despite these quirks, Mark is actually an
intelligent man with an obvious eye for cinema.  An eye like Ed Wood,
but an eye nonetheless.
Movie opens with Mark telling the audience the importance of not blowing
important opportunities because second chances are hard to come by.  He
learned this lesson the hard way, as we soon see footage of Mark on a
local radio show, where he was supposed to be talking up a short film
that he made called Creeps.  Instead, Mark showed up at the radio
station under a beer/marijuana spell that left him babbling incoherently
on the air.
We see Mark open his mail, which includes letters from creditors that
threaten legal action.  We also see an offer of a new credit card,
followed by a gleam in Mark's eye as he realizes he can stay financially
afloat a bit longer thanks to this pre-approved offer.  We also see
clips of other Super 8 horror shorts that Mark has made, including, at
age 14, The More the Scarier.  If the title cracks you up, just think
about the two sequels (and the unfinished third).  There is also a
special-effects extravaganza from Mark's past called I Blow Up, which
features him, umm, blowing up in front of a bathroom mirror.
Realizing he doesn't have the financing to continue Northwestern, Mark
decided to complete Cöven, a film he has abandoned on and off over a
seven-year period.  His Uncle Bill reluctantly provides start-up money
for Mark after his nephew flashes headshots of a beautiful model that he
hopes to land for Cöven.  Mark's best friend Mike, a burnt-out slacker,
often accompanies him, playing a portly Abbott to Mark's stringy
Costello.  Jay and Inarticulate Bob, perhaps.  In fact, because of the
cavalcade of bizarre characters, you might think this is a mockumentary
(a la This is Spinal Tap!).  But it's real.
Movie's director Chris Smith follows Cöven from Uncle Bill's financing
through the local premiere, set against the backdrop of Mark's thirtieth
birthday and the Green Bay Packers 1998 Super Bowl victory.  Smith's
project, which was originally supposed to take six months, stretched to
over two years as Mark continually ran into filming and financial
obstacles.  The two met while editing separate projects and Smith was
taken by Mark's enthusiasm toward filmmaking.  You too will be drawn
into Mark's world, which, although sometimes frightening and often
unintentionally hysterical, is really a very poignant portrayal of the
American Dream.

Review for Insider, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
A Mercedes speeds through a densely populated Middle Eastern city.
There is an American in the backseat, blindfolded.  His name is Lowell
Bergman, a 60 Minutes producer that is being led to a secret location to
line up an interview with an Islamic fundamentalist Sheik.  Bergman
isn't the least bit intimidated by the process and even plays hardball
with the Sheik's handlers, who eventually give up their fight to see the
questions prior to the interview.  Think your job is tough?  Unless your
name is Regis, you've got no reason to complain about your day job.
After Bergman (Al Pacino, The Devil's Advocate) secures the interview,
the gold-domed white buildings give way to the white lab coats of
Louisville's Brown & Williamson, where Vice President of Research and
Development Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe, Mystery, Alaska) has just
been fired.  The good news is that he will receive a beefy severance
package and continued health benefits, which will both keep his family
in the lifestyles to which they've grown accustomed and ensure medical
care for his eldest daughter who suffers from acute asthma.  The bad
news is that Wigand was forced to sign a confidentiality agreement that
prevents him from disclosing any information regarding his employer, who
happens to be one of the country's largest tobacco manufacturers.  And
he knows secrets that could severely cripple any company that makes
cigarettes.
More of a scientist than your typical corporate VP, Wigand, who was
previously employed by Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Union Carbide, has
been struggling internally for years.  He's been taking the big payoff
for something that he knows is wrong.  Bergman is given Wigand's name as
someone who can translate scientific data for a fire safety piece that
60 Minutes is producing.  But after speaking with each other, Bergman
feels that Wigand has a story to tell and Wigand realizes that Bergman
represents a chance to clear his conscience and inform the public that
tobacco companies are chemically enhancing nicotine to be even more
addictive.
Despite this opportunity, the doughy Wigand is still reluctant.  Just
meeting Bergman has thrown his life into chaos.  His former employer is
asking for an addendum to confidentiality agreement, he thinks he's
being stalked, and the local FBI agents seem to be in someone's pocket.
The Insider tells the true story of Wigand's decision to become a
whistleblower and the dramatic effects that the decision has on his
life.  It also shows the internal struggle behind the scenes at 60
Minutes, as CBS fears that airing Wigand's interview could result in a
huge lawsuit.
Based on Marie Brenner's Vanity Fair article called `The Man Who Knew
Too Much,' the film was adapted by Eric Roth (The Horse Whisperer) and
director Mann.  Crowe's performance is simply amazing, as is Christopher
Plummer's (Twelve Monkeys), who plays 60 Minutes vet Mike Wallace.
Pacino is typically wonderful and Philip Baker Hall (The Truman Show)
effectively portrays 60 Minutes chief Don Hewitt.  Mann's direction is
successfully accented by several scenes that are shot out of frame with
no dialogue, relying on the film's moving score to power itself.
Despite being a brilliant film, Mann's self-indulgent style proves that
he has no respect for the asses of moviegoers.  This is the guy that
turned Heat, a run-of-the-mill crime drama into a three-hour epic.  The
Insider could have easily been 30 to 40 minutes shorter and, as a
result, a much better film.  His choppy editing was, at times,
frustrating.  A film of this magnitude really needed a lot of long,
sweeping shots  especially in a scene like Bergman's blindfolded
interview in the film's opening.  And the driving-range-stalking scene
was way too much.  Perhaps a nice, quick montage of Wigand noticing the
same guy following him at the bank, the grocery store, the post office
and the liquor store would have been better.  But `quick' isn't a word
in Mann's vocabulary.  I think he may be Kevin Costner's cousin.

Review for Coyote Ugly (2000)
In Cocktail, Tom Cruise's character became a bartender because he
dreamed of owning his own bar and becoming a millionaire.  In Coyote
Ugly, Piper Perabo slings drinks because she has in insatiable urge for
hard liquor and man-meat.
Well, that's not true at all.  If you've seen Ugly's trailer, you'd
think the film was about a bunch of slinky bartenders who can't get
enough men.  But Ugly is only rated PG-13, and its characters don't ooze
sex any more than a Britney Spears video.  The closest thing to nudity
in the film is Perabo's shadow in a dressing room.
Will guys be disappointed with Ugly after being assaulted with the
promise of sex and various state of feminine undress in the film's
marketing campaign?  It's a distinct possibility, since Ugly actually
plays like a chick-flick by portraying men as knuckle-dragging
Neanderthals and women as the cooler, calmer sex.  Where the hell is
Russ Meyer when you need him?
Perabo (The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle) plays Violet Sanford, the
daughter of a New Jersey tollbooth collector (John Goodman, What Planet
Are You From?).  Although she suffers from stage fright, Violet dreams
of becoming a successful songwriter - a career that her deceased mother
attempted and failed before Violet was born.  Her career ambitions take
her from a job in a suburban pizza parlor to a filthy, cramped Chinatown
apartment.
Violet quickly learns that the big city chews up and spits out girls
like her on a regular basis.  Everyone she meets seems to be a bitter,
failed musician.  Before you know it, she's chased off an open mike
stage by a pair of drunken hecklers and, of course, her grimy apartment
is burglarized.  Down on her luck and out of money, Violet ends up
taking a job from Lil (Maria Bello, Payback) who owns a popular bar in
Manhattan's meat-packing district.  The catch is that she has to wear
skimpy outfits, flirt with the customers and perform bar-top dances with
her sexy co-workers Zoe (supermodel Tyra Banks), Rachel (Bridget
Moynahan, Sex and the City) and Cammie (Izabella Miko, in her film
debut).
Predictably, Violet is horrible at her new job, but slowly becomes as
skilled and popular as her co-workers.  She even develops a relationship
with an Australian expatriate named Kevin (Adam Garcia, Wilde).  Their
romance is fairly interesting, despite being one of those typical
Hollywood affairs, with the girl initially hating the guy until he
finally wears her down with his relentless pursuit.
Perabo, who at times is a dead-ringer for Julia Roberts, can do the
sweet and innocent thing really well, but her character is oddly written
to be intermittently a naďve pussycat and a quick-talking hard ass.  It
left me scratching my head.  In most
inexperienced-person-goes-to-the-big-city films, the character stays
green until the final reel.  But not in Ugly.  The supporting roles are
all flimsily sketched, but Aussie actress Melanie Lynskey (But I'm A
Cheerleader) is a stand out based on her chunky Jersey accent alone.
Ugly is the directorial debut of David McNally, and its script was
written by Gina Wendkos, who is best known for a little-seen 1992 Jami
Gertz film called Jersey Girl (which was described as a Cinderella story
with big hair).  The picture was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (Gone in
60 Seconds, Armageddon), who usually makes huge summer blockbusters with
flimsy female characters.  Ugly isn't Bruckheimer's only venture away
from his typical testosterone-driven resume  the producer's football
flick Remember the Titans hits theatres next month.
Interestingly, Ugly uses the Gloria Gaynor song `I Will Survive' in one
of its major scenes, as does The Replacements, which opens one week
after Ugly premieres.  Also of note is a pet cat that mysteriously
appears in Violet's apartment.  Country crooner LeAnn Rimes appears in
the film's final scene, which makes no sense at all even after you find
out that Rimes provides the voice for all of Violet's singing scenes.
In short, Ugly is kind of like an all-night drinking binge  it's a fun
blur while it's happening, but you'll barely be able to remember it the
next day.

Title
Review for You've Got Mail (1998)
The first big disappointment of the holiday season is You've Got Mail (*
˝), Nora Ephron's uneven re-pairing of Sleepless in Seattle lovebirds
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Surprisingly empty and enormously light, Mail is
anchored only by the presence of its two huge stars.
Once past the nifty computer-generated opening of a virtual New York
City, viewers will be introduced to the two main characters.  Ryan is
Kathleen Kelly, an endlessly perky and chipper owner of a small
children's book store.  Hanks plays Joe Fox, the puffy-faced owner of a
huge chain of successful bookstores (a la Barnes and Noble) that is
opening its new outlet around the corner and intends to run Kelly's shop
out of business.  They unknowingly met in a chat room (before the film
starts) and have been communicating via e-mail for monthsbut neither
knows who their pen-pal really is.
The rest of the story unfolds so predictably unimaginative that it
actually rivals Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit in terms of a sheer lack
of originality.  Essentially a remake of The Shop Around the Corner, the
1946 Jimmy Stewart/Margaret Sullavan classic, Mail plods along at
powerfully sluggish two-hour pace that is about 30 minutes too long for
fare this shallow and slight.  Nobody that has been to the movies in the
past forty years should be entertained by this film or surprised by its
outcome.
Hanks' phoned-in performance is particularly vacant and reminiscent of
Harrison Ford's wooden turn in Sabrina, while Ryan is, as always, a
pleasure to watch.  His charm is turned down to around `3' and hers is
cranked up to about `12'.  Mail will likely draw many comparisons to
Seattle  a film about two love-hungry adults that fall for each other
site unseen.
Why did the studio honchos think that the average American needed to see
a flick so similar that they actually enlisted the same stars?  The
answer is simple  money.  Hanks and Ryan are huge box office draws.
Why?  Because he's the type of guy that men want to be, and she is the
girl that most women secretly wish they were (but will never ever
admitever).
Mail also boasts an amazing cast of co-stars  Greg Kinnear, Jean
Stapleton, Dave Chappelle and Dabney Coleman capably handle their roles,
but Steve Zahn and indie-goddess Parker Posey stand out in their smaller
parts.  How does a film pay for this many stars of this magnitude?  The
answer is simple  product placement.  Prepare to have America Online,
Starbucks, Apple and Microsoft products shoved in your face for a full
two hours.
I have a few suggestions for better plots; the most obvious being a more
realistic story of two people who meet on the Internet.  He would be a
400-pound unemployed Star Trek fan pretending to be a successful
businessman, while she would say that she resembles Cindy Crawford but
would actually turn out to be a man.  Oh, yeah, and he would be a serial
killer, too.  The tagline would be `Life Is Like A Box Of Chocolates.'
Other suggestions include You've Got Herpes  a madcap comedy
(presumably starring either Pauly Shore or Charlie Sheen) about a guy
who has a drunken one-time sexual encounter with a girl he meets on the
Internet and wakes up with genital warts and a white, clumpy discharge.
The rest of the film would be a hilarious romp as the Shore/Sheen
character tried to track down the one-night stand, who would also turn
out to be a serial killer.  Tagline  `This Christmas, Pornography Isn't
The Only Thing Brad Flaherty Downloads.'
Or You've Got Cancer  a bittersweet drama, directed by David Lynch,
about a Willy Loman-type travelling salesman who neglects his family and
dies of prostate cancer.  Things take a surreal turn when, one year
after his death, the soul of the salesman is transferred to the toilet
brush in his family's downstairs bathroom.  The brush tries to be a
better father to his two small children, but fails miserably as the
children grow so frightened of him that they develop a psychological
fear of the bathroom and must be hospitalized for severe constipation.
Tragically, when the family returns home from the hospital, they find
the brush hanging from a pipe on the bathroom ceiling.  Then the two
kids would grow up to be serial killers.  Tagline  `Frank Schwartz
Thought His Life Was BadUntil He Died.'
How about You've Got Conjoined Twin Myslexia  the big-screen debut of
television's South Park centers around the origins of the two-faced
school nurse.  The kids would get to use dirtier words, Cartman's
manhood would be revealed, Stan would be a serial killer and Kenny would
die in every reel.  Tagline  `Give Us Your Money; It's South Park!'
Actually, You've Got anything (except Mail) would have been an
improvement.
You've Got Mail (1:59) is rated PG for some very mild language and some
adult situations.

Title
Review for Poor White Trash (2000)
Last March, a film that poked fun at the slow-witted, backwoods folk of
a tiny upstate New York town was released to poor reviews and virtually
no audience.  Drowning Mona was a sloppy whodunit that tried too hard to
be quirky and instead came off as a dull Fargo copycat.
Conversely, Poor White Trash succeeds where Mona went horribly wrong. It
also deals with characters more likely to spit tobacco juice than
mouthwash, but instead of upstate New York, Trash is set in Sunrise,
Illinois.  The film opens with the bumpkin duo of Michael (Tony Denman,
G vs. E) and Lennie (Jacob Tierney, This is My Father) trying to steal
non-alcoholic beer from the local grocery (called The L'il Store).  One
blow-up doll and a burnt Chevy Vega later, the two have been nabbed by
the authorities, a move that could potentially threaten the future of
college-bound Michael.
Meanwhile, Michael's mother Linda (Sean Young, Ace Ventura: Pet
Detective) has just been fired from her nursing home job.  Times have
been hard for Linda (her husband, a one-eyed professional wrestler,
abandoned her and Michael), but the thought of her only son being turned
away from secondary learning (and, thusly, a ticket out of Sunrise) is
just too much for her to handle.  A plan is hatched to raise money to
hire Lennie's grandfather to represent the boys in court.
Their plan doesn't involve a bake sale or a car wash - rather a series
of trailer burglaries.  And Lennie's grandfather (William Devane, Space
Cowboys) turns out to be a shit-kickin' hillbilly with a strip-mall law
office (called `Ron Lake's Land o' Law'), a hot young wife (Jaime
Pressly, Jerry Springer's Ringmaster) and several impressive beer-can
sculptures.  Hilarity ensues, leading up to a big gunfight finale. M.
Emmet Walsh (Wild Wild West) even makes an appearance as the town
justice  like who else would you get to play a backwater judge?
Trash isn't filled with stars, nor is it particularly well-written or
evenly executed, but it's still a lot of fun to watch.  Unlike Mona, the
film doesn't take itself too seriously, a point driven home by
writer/director Michael Addis, who mocked his film's lack of complexity
in the Q&A session following the screening of this film at the Cleveland
International Film Festival.  Addis, who makes his directorial debut
here (he was an editor on Kounterfeit), presented the film with a goofy,
hyper smile and even thinks his film may have pissed off the locals in
Benton, Illinois, where the film was shot.
Addis, who played a cop in Trash and was a writer on The Man Show, even
poked fun at Sean Young, telling a story of how the actress truly
suffered for her art.  At one point, she rhetorically screamed, `Who do
I have to fuck to get off this film?'  When somebody replied, `Addis,'
Young said she'd stay on.  It's jokes like these that make Trash a
surprisingly funny film.

Review for Outside Providence (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Timothy Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy, The Faculty) had been called `Ass Bag' and
`Queer' before his father finally settled on the nickname `Dildo.'
Dunph, as he is more commonly known, has spent his entire life in
Pawtucket, Rhode Island with his blue-collar old man (Alec Baldwin,
Mercury Rising), a three-legged dog named Cyclops and paraplegic kid
brother Jackie (Kyle & Ryan Pepi), who was injured falling off the roof
during a game of football.  Their mother died when both boys were
little.
Life in Pawtucket isn't too exciting for kids, and Dunph ends up
spending his evenings on the town's water tower, getting high with other
disenchanted neighborhood teenagers.  They all use fantastic slang when
talking about women, referring to their faces as `helmets,' breasts as
`floaters,' and rear ends as `toilets.'  And in Pawtucket, you don't get
to third base with a girl  you stink-finger her.
One night, while driving without a license and having his vision
impaired immense clouds of pot smoke, Dunph slams into a parked cop
car.  Thanks to a `connected' friend of his father, the judge's only
punishment is to make Dunph enroll in Cornwall Academy, a prep school in
central Connecticut.  When asked what prep school would actually prepare
him for, Dunph's old man grunts `to prepare you from not gettin' your
neck broke by me.'
Dunph sets off for Cornwall with thirty frogpelts from his pop and a
garbage bag full of personal belongings.  He instantly deduces that
there might be a period of adjustment when he shows up for orientation
in a dingy t-shirt and blue jeans, while everybody else is outfitted in
blue blazers and neckties.  Soon enough, Dunph finds a counterculture of
dope fiends and troublemakers, including a comely young woman named Jane
Weston (Amy Smart, Varsity Blues).
Essentially a typical coming-of-age film, Providence succeeds where
others asphyxiate from mediocrity, due to its production pedigree.  The
film is based on Peter Farrelly's novel of the same name and the book,
which was really sort of boring, was adapted here by Farrelly, his
brother Bobby (the guys that made There's Something About Mary) and
director Michael Corrente (American Buffalo).  Don't be fooled  this
isn't a slapstick comedy like Mary.  It's more character driven than
bodily fluid driven, but still entertaining nonetheless.  (1:38 - R for
pervasive teen drug use and strong language including sexual references)

Title
Review for Instinct (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
No, it's not the sequel to Silence of the Lambs, but it sure feels like
it.  Cuba Gooding Jr. (What Dreams May Come) stars as Theo Caulder, an
ass-kissing, ladder-climbing psych resident at the University of Miami.
Caulder's mentor (Donald Sutherland, Without Limits) gives him a dream
assignment  to clinically evaluate a convicted murderer just days
before his competency hearing.
The killer is Dr. Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins, Meet Joe Black), a
former anthropology professor at the U of M.  The mild-mannered Powell
disappeared while studying a family of gorillas in an African jungle,
only to re-emerge two years later as a crazy-eyed killer with long
hair.  He also hasn't spoken since his capture, so Caulder has his work
cut out for him.
Unfortunately, Caulder must agree to evaluate the other kooks in Harmony
Bay prison.  The result is an annoyingly contrived peripheral plot that
does nothing but slow down the pace of the film, as does the strange
relationship between Caulder and Powell's daughter (Maura Tierney,
NewsRadio).  Of other interest is the prison battle between Powell and
the sadistic guard, played by eternal bad guy John Ashton (Meet the
Deedles).  Meet Joe Black?  Meet the Deedles?  Meet the back of my hand.
What could have happened in the jungle to turn the esteemed Dr. Powell
from Richard Attenborough in Miracle on 34th Street to Sean Connery in
the beginning of The Rock?  What ever it was, it couldn't have been as
horrible as sitting through this beast of a film.  Instinct drags along
like Keyser Soze's gimpy leg, stopping only to feature a few bad cliches
(namely a prison rebellion scene reminiscent of the football drama
Rudy).
On the plus side, Gooding is a lot better than Denzel Washington would
have been if he had won the role (and he probably would have three years
ago).  Gooding shows range and charisma, both words assumed to be
unknown to Mr. Washington.  The interaction between Gooding and Hopkins
is also better than average, but when they swap their roles of doctor
and patient, you can't help but think of the far superior relationship
between Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter and his evaluator, Clarice Starling.
Directed by Jon Turteltaub (Phenomenon), Instinct is based on a book
called `Ishmael' by Daniel Quinn and adapted for the screen by Message
in a Bottle scribe Gerald DiPego.  It features some very real-looking
fake gorillas, courtesy of Stan Winston, and has a classy Danny Elfman
score.  The good news is that the novel that will serve as the sequel to
Lambs comes out soon.  The bad news is that it may not be good enough to
wash off the stench of Instinct.  (2:04  R for intense violent
behavior)

Review for Reindeer Games (2000)
What does it mean when a movie called Reindeer Games comes out in late
February?  There are two possible explanations:  The film just wasn't
ready for a Christmas release (the studio response) or the film would
have been slaughtered by Toy Story 2 and Any Given Sunday, not to
mention The Talented Mr. Ripley (the real response).  If there's one
thing that Hollywood knows, it's not to pit Ben against Matt at the box
office.
The first scene of Reindeer Games immediately made me forget about any
talk of stalled release dates.  Any film that opens with an overhead
shot of a dead, smoldering Santa will do that to you.  Of course, this
means that the action has already taken place and that the entire film
will be one big flashback, likely featuring a voice-over provided by the
protagonist.  Anybody getting tired of this trend?  Did the MPAA pass a
law that required at least one major theatrical release per week include
the whole flashback/voice-over thing?  It was cool when Kevin Spacey did
it in American Beauty, but come on.
The flashback reverts to six days earlier and the voice-over comes
courtesy of Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck, Boiler Room).  Rudy is a two-bit
hoodlum three days away from his release from Iron Mountain Prison in
Michigan, where he's been locked up since his grand theft auto
conviction.  His cellmate, Nick (James Frain, Hilary & Jackie), is also
scheduled to be released on the same day.  All Rudy can think about is
getting home in time for Christmas dinner to wolf down hot chocolate and
pecan pie, while Nick drools over pictures and letters from his pen-pal
sweetheart Ashley Mercer (Charlize Theron, The Cider House Rules).
Long story short, Rudy gets out of the clink, but Nick doesn't.  Rudy
pretends to be Nick so he can nail Ashley, who turns out to have a
psychotic, gun-running brother named Gabriel (Gary Sinise, The Green
Mile), who wants to use Rudy/Nick to pull of an Indian casino heist.
But it's not easy to tell who is playing who as the story twists and
turns into the film's final reel.  The script was written by Ehren
Kruger (Scream 3 and Arlington Road), so you almost have to expect
somewhat of a surprise ending.
In addition to several plot holes wider than Bill Bradley's neck,
Krueger's script also includes a handful of jokes about Native
Americans.  I don't have a problem with that kind of humor, as long as
it's funny (which it is here), but I couldn't help wondering how they
would have gone over if they had been told to an opportunistic magazine
reporter by a relief pitcher.  And speaking of race, could they have
cast a more ethnically diverse trio of hoodlums to support Gabriel?
There's the black guy (Clarence Williams III, The General's Daughter),
the Latino guy (Danny Trejo, ConAir) and the white guy (Donal Logue,
Runaway Bride).
On the plus side, Affleck shows that he is one damn charismatic actor.
Whether he's taking a punch in the gut or a dart in the chest, his
reactions are some of the most realistic I've seen.  He can scream and
gasp for air with the best of them.  The bad thing is that he's totally
unbelievable as a convict.  Hammy, perhaps, but Affleck really made the
film tolerable.  Sinise does well chewing up scenery as the bad guy, but
I just heard him crowing in a television interview that he came up with
the `look' for his character all on his own.  Wow  I'm pretty sure
that's he's the first bad guy to have a goatee, long hair, a leather
jacket and an earring.
Seventy-year-old director John Frankenheimer doesn't quite match his
previous effort (Ronin) but doesn't really come close to recreating his
all-time low (The Island of Dr. Moreau), either.  Even though
Frankenheimer has produced some of the finest car-chase scenes ever
captured on film and Affleck's character plays an auto thief, there are
no road hijinks in Games.  Even so, at seventy, Frankeheimer shows he
can still make a pretty decent action flick.

Review for Any Given Sunday (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
I don't follow football too closely (a recent peek at the NFL standings
made me exclaim, `Who moved the Cardinals to the NFC West, and why are
they doing so well?'), but I recognize a deep hole when I see it.  The
Miami Sharks are in a bit of a hole before Any Given Sunday even starts,
and after a few minutes have gone by, that hole is transformed into a
chasm.
In back-to-back plays at the end of the first half of the game, the
fictitious Sharks lose their three-time league MVP quarterback -
thirty-eight-year-old Jack "Cap" Rooney (Dennis Quaid, Playing By Heart)
- and his inexperienced backup.  Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx, How to Be a
Player), the third-string passer, is inserted into the game, but he
pukes on the field before he even touches the ball and mistakenly lines
up behind his right guard for a snap.  The Sharks lose their fourth
consecutive game going into a much-needed bye week, appearing to be
extremely far removed from the team that brought home the AFFA Pantheon
Cup less than four years ago.
Coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino, The Insider) is understandably upset.
Not only is his team leader gone, but D'Amato also has to contend with
the bitch-on-wheels team owner, Cornell business graduate Christina
Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz, Being John Malkovich).  The spoiled-brat
daughter of the team's former owner, Pagniacci wants a winning team in
order to convince the city to give her a new stadium so that the team
will be worth more money when she puts the Sharks on the market.  When
Beamen shows promise in the quarterback position, Pagniacci orders
D'Amato to play the flashy up-and-comer, despite his lack of respect for
his coach and teammates.
Sunday concentrates more on D'Amato's discord with Pagniacci and Beamen
than it does on its football clashes, showing the game as more of a
business than a sport.  Almost every character in this film is
despicable in one way or another.  The players respect money and are
more concerned with their individual statistics, bonuses and endorsement
deals than they are with the performance of the team.  Their petty wives
and girlfriends are even worse.  D'Amato wants only to win, despite the
cost, while team doctor Harvey Mandrake (James Woods, The General's
Daughter) falsifies medical reports to keep players in and out of games,
jeopardizing lives in the process.
While you may think that Sunday's focus would be on the game of
football, there is a lot more to the film.  Almost three hours more.
Director Oliver Stone (U-Turn) spends as much time off the field as he
does on, realistically showing black players dressing like pimps (what
normal person wears suits and top hats like this?), the effect of
twenty-four-hour sports television on the game and, most importantly,
the transformation of the game from the hard-nosed, old-school, Vince
Lombardi style of play to the flamboyant personal style of today's
statistic-obsessed, drug-addled players.  Maybe it's because two NFL
stars have been arrested already this week (one after a nationwide
manhunt), but this portrayal should be particularly alarming to the NFL.
The whole old-school/new-school battle is exemplified well here between
D'Amato and Beamen, who seem to speak different languages at times.
Even though the final reel is full of every sports-movie cliché that
they could dig up, the film is still enjoyable to watch.  Errrrthat is
if you have a durable rear-end.  Toward the end of the film, D'Amato
delivers a stirring locker-room speech to his team about the importance
of inches on the field and how they needed to win the battle for those
inches.  I couldn't help thinking that if they had only trimmed about
10,000 inches of celluloid off of the final cut, it may have been a
better film.
Stone's Sunday, which he co-wrote with John Logan (Bats), is probably
his most visual film since Natural Born Killers, which is mostly a good
thing.  The game sequences are spectacular, especially during a playoff
game when the final seconds tick off of the scoreboard in a highly
stylistic fashion.  Part of making the movie look cool is shrouding the
playing field in darkness, which just seems silly, and making sideline
conversations audible despite an obvious lack of shouting.  I expected
more shots of delirious fans, but Christ, that would have just slowed
the movie down.  As it was, three major stars were cut out of the film
at the last minute  Ed Burns, Tim Sizemore and Jim Caviezel all had
roles in the film, but don't actually make in onto the screen.  Sunday
is believed to incorporate parts of former Oakland Raiders team doctor
Rob Huizenga's book `You're Okay, It's Just A Bruise: A Doctor's
Sideline Secrets About Pro Football's Most Outrageous Team.'
Most of Sunday's acting is pretty decent, with former players Jim Brown
and Lawrence Taylor surprisingly strong.  The casting is amazing, and
I'm not sure that I've ever seen a wider gamut of actors in one film.
Did you ever think that you would see Charlton Heston and Bill Bellamy
in the same movie?  I think that's one of the signs of the apocalypse.
Ditto for Ann-Margret and LL Cool J.  Another apocalyptic warning is a
football picture than takes almost as long as a real football game.  At
least in real life you get timeouts for bathroom and snack breaks.

Review for Pollock (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
I didn't know too much about Jackson Pollock before seeing Ed Harris'
impressive biopic.  I knew he was an artist.  I had heard of his wife, but I
didn't know she was an artist as well.  And I remember Patti Smith referring
to him as a "nigger" in one of her songs.
After seeing Pollock, I'm still not that familiar with the celebrated
American artist, but I do know that Harris and screen wife Marcia Gay Harden
act their asses off in the film and were justifiably honored with Academy
Award nominations for their performances.  Pollock is almost good enough to
transcend the typical tale of a tortured artist, only occasionally slipping
into clichéd scenes showing the artist sitting alone with his head buried in
his hands or curled up in the fetal position.
For those of you as uneducated about art as myself, Pollock (played by The
Third Miracle's Harris) was a true original, blurring the line between
Surrealism and Expressionism in post-war America.  He married a fellow
artist named Lee Krasner (Harden, Space Cowboys), and the couple struggled
with both finances and Pollock's manic-depression until he went down in a
blaze of drunken glory.  Don't get pissy about me spoiling the ending - when
is the last time you saw a movie about an artist that didn't die?
The film opens in 1942, where Pollock and Krasner are both up-and-comers in
New York's growing art world.  They're a couple of WPA kids, getting monthly
stipends from the government to sink into their paintings.  Neither is
particularly well-known outside New York, especially in Europe, which, at
the time, was still the center of the art world.  One day Krasner drops by
Pollock's apartment to look at his work.  She's assertive and almost
robotically emotionless, giving him unsolicited advice about his work.  They
fall in love and move in together, where Krasner blindly supports her man,
even if it means his career will overshadow her own.
Things start happening when Pollock's work is seen by the influential Peggy
Guggenheim (Harris' real-life wife, Amy Madigan).  As his career begins to
pick up steam, however, Krasner watches Pollock become unhinged by mental
illness and alcoholism.  A move to East Hampton (filmed on Pollock's actual
property) temporarily helps, but before long, Pollock ditches gardening for
binge drinking.
The Hamptons was where Pollock abandoned traditional painting style and
accidentally discovered a technique that involved drizzling and splattering
paint onto a canvas from above - a move that landed the artist in Life
magazine and established him as one of the country's premiere modern
artists. Typically, the success only leads to more problems in his life.
The story of Pollock's rise and self-destruction barely matters in the long
run.  It's much more gratifying to watch Harris wield his paintbrush like a
weapon while he creates startling images identical to those of the real
artist.  But the bizarre relationship between Pollock and Krasner is the
real highlight here.  Harris, who also directs and produces, has probably
never been better, but even his performance takes a backseat to Harden's
stellar turn as Krasner.  Admittedly, this role is probably the biggest
she's had to tackle, but Harden is head and shoulders better here than in
anything else I've ever seen her in.  She barely sounds like or resembles
herself physically.  It's like they spliced her DNA with Jeanne
Tripplehorn's looks and Rebecca Pidgeon's vocal mannerisms.
Technically, Pollock is a real treat to watch, thanks to Harris' careful
direction and some snazzy photography from Buena Vista Social Club
cinematographer Lisa Rinzler.  The film is based on a novel called "Jackson
Pollock: An American Saga," written by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith
and adapted for the screen by Barbara Turner and Susan J. Emshwiller.

Review for Our Song (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you dug American High, the canceled high-school-based reality show
recently brought back to life by PBS, you should definitely check out Jim
McKay's Our Song, a gritty but fictitious look at the lives of three young
girls and how they spent their summer.  McKay shot the entire film using a
handheld camera, which, given the overabundance of reality programming as of
late, makes Song look and feel too real to be watching from an
air-conditioned theatre.  This is the kind of thing you watch from your
couch, possibly while involved in some kind of drinking game (every time
Mike says something to piss off Coral, you have to drink a shot).
Armed with a budget of under $500,000, writer/director McKay (Girls Town)
headed to Crown Heights, Brooklyn to tell this story of three girls hovering
around their 16th birthdays.  Each is a member of the Jackie Robinson
Steppers Marching Band, who may be headed to Alaska for a competition, and
each has just found out their school is being closed because of a recently
discovered asbestos problem.  Instead of rejoicing, like most kids their
age, these girls are upset, realizing the commute to a new school could add
hours to their scholastic day.  They're good kids, for the most part, which
is part of the film's offbeat realism.
The girls are played by Anna Simpson, Melissa Martinez and the promising
Kerry Washington, who had a part in Save the Last Dance.  Like real girls
their age, they have to deal with the various everyday problems causing teen
angst: divorce, pregnancy, suicide, clashes with parents and fights with
siblings. But there's fun stuff, like movies, ice cream, sleepovers,
birthday parties and shoplifting, to offset the trauma.  There isn't a lot
of excitement, as the film is meant to be a slice of life, but it also makes
the 95-minute running time seem to last forever.
The coolest thing about Song may be the opening credits, where McKay forgoes
the typical "A Film By" credit and lists the names of everyone involved in
the production instead of just his own.  Song looks terrific, with
photography courtesy of Jim Denault (Boys Don't Cry).  R.E.M. frontman
Michael Stipe serves as the film's executive producer.

Review for House of Mirth, The (2000)
You know a film is bad when the reviews and descriptions carry on about
things like costumes and set design.  And let me tell you, the costumes
and set design in The House of Mirth are pretty darn good.  Yes, they
sure are.  Production designer Don Taylor (Brassed Off) and costumer
Monica Howe (Bugsy Malone) do a very admirable job of recreating 1905
New York City.  Yup.    What?  I have how many more
words to write?
Okay  here's the deal.  Mirth, based on Edith Wharton's novel, is an
awful film that features some of the worst acting to deface the big
screen in quite some time.  The X-Files' Gillian Anderson is so
howlingly awful in the lead role, it actually boggles the imagination.
Of course, I could be way off-base here - Anderson won a British
Independent Film Award (beating the likes of Brenda Blethyn, Julie
Walters and Emily Watson), while the director and the film also nabbed
nominations (losing, thankfully, to the impeccable Billy Elliot)
Set in turn-of-the-century Manhattan, Mirth tells the story of Lily Bart
(Anderson), a young socialite in the upper crust of New York society.
She's one of the city's most eligible young women and the envy of her
highbrow female friends because of it.  Lily doesn't have a reliable
source of income and must find a husband that will be able to support
her and the lavish lifestyle she has grown accustomed to by living with
her wealthy aunt (Eleanor Bron, A Little Princess).
Despite his lack of earnings, Lily falls for a lawyer named Lawrence
Selden (Eric Stoltz, Anaconda).  Although Lily is hot for Selden, she
won't marry him because he's poor.  When Lily is spotted leaving
Selden's apartment, she finds herself blackmailed by a social-climbing
property owner (Anthony LaPaglia, Autumn in New York).  Throw in a
couple of bad business investments, mounting gambling debt, a drinking
problem and being turned away by her aunt, and Lily starts slipping down
the social ladder so quickly, she barely touches the rungs.
Mirth is broken up into two sections, with one showing Lily struggling
to find the right man and the other concentrating on her descent into
the gutter.  At the halfway mark, you'll be wondering whether Lily is
too goddamn lazy or too hung up on her pride to  oh, I don't know  get
off her back and get a job.  Lily is a portrayed as a victim, and the
story is supposed to show how horrible it is when women had to depend on
men.  Women had to marry to obtain any kind of social status, while men
had a choice, and  it's just not fair.
There's a fine line between a pace that's methodical and a pace that's
boring, and Mirth writer/director Terence Davies (The Neon Bible) opts
for the latter.  To make matters worse, the story doesn't come close to
having a sympathetic character.  The women are all unlikeable, and the
men are even worse.
I love Anderson on The X-Files, and though the casting of her may have
seemed daring and edgy, it's all wrong.  Think about it  the only
non-Scully role she's landed was in Playing By Heart, which was hardly
awe-inspiring.  And Anderson isn't the only character miscast here.
Mirth features a string of unbelievable casting blunders, with Stoltz
following quickly behind Anderson with one of the year's worst
performances.  There's a reason nobody has seen the last 10 films this
guy has made.  If chemistry were measured on a scale of 1 to 10, the
sparks between Anderson and Stoltz would manage to pull in a negative
number.  When Dan Aykroyd is the best part of an acting ensemble,
viewers should head for the hills.  The actors perform as if Davies
pumped sleeping gas into the set every morning (something I wish they
did to the theatre at my screening of this film).
It's films like this that scare people from reading classic novels by
the likes of Wharton, Henry James and Thomas Hardy.  For every five
great film versions of a period piece based on a popular novel (like
Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence, Iain Softley's The Wings of the
Dove and Michael Winterbottom's Jude), it only takes one as bad as Mirth
to tear down everything built up by its far superior brethren.
2:20  PG for boredom-inducing thematic material

Review for Out-of-Towners, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
I can understand why Hollywood remakes popular films of yesteryear, but
1970's The Out-of-Towners, starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, is not
liked by a lot of people.  I always thought that it was a good film and
even keep a copy of it in my permanent video library, but even I would
not have picked it to alter.
Since the original film was a precursor to the superior Planes, Trains &
Automobiles, why not get Steve Martin to play the male lead?  I've got
no problem with that (except they changed his name from `George' to
`Henry'), but Goldie Hawn?  At what point did she turn into Carol
Channing?  Plus, the best part about the original was Dennis' repeatedly
whining her husband's name over and over and over again.  Hawn spends
too much time trying to be a sexpot.  Goldie, you're sixty.  Give it up.
Martin and Hawn (Housesitter) play Henry and Nancy Clark, two suburban
Ohio parents that have just herded their last child out the door and
find themselves alone, in an empty house, with nothing to do but bicker.
Nancy is unaware of the importance of Henry's upcoming job interview in
New York City, because he has recently been fired but hasn't had the
guts to tell his wife.  The trip, of course, is a disaster.  They end up
in Boston when New York is fogged in, they miss a train, they rent a
car, they get mugged, and so on and so on.  They also make the mistake
of skipping the airline meal and then stagger through the rest of the
film hungry.  Now that's humor!
If it weren't for Martin, The Out-of-Towners would be pretty unbearable,
and John Cleese (Monty Python) adds some laughs as an uptight hotel
manager.  When the picture ended (predictably at the 90-minute mark),
this old guy sitting next to me hoped aloud that they would show
outtakes during the credits.  I pointed out to him that we been watching
them for the last 90 minutes.  (1:33  PG-13 for some mild language and
Hawn in low-cut lingerieOh, my God  I'm blind!)

Title
Review for Winslow Boy, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Playwright-turned-filmmaker David Mamet (The Spanish Prisoner) has, in
his previous pictures, created gritty, urban crime dramas full of seedy
characters that bombard viewers with machine-gun-like expletives and
unpredictable double-crosses.  So why would Mamet, who until now had
written each of his directorial efforts, adapt Terence Rattigan's 1946
stage play for his next film project?
It doesn't matter - Mamet's leap into the period genre is magnificent.
The story, set in 1912, focuses on a real-life incident in
turn-of-the-century England in which the 13-year-old son of a wealthy
London banker is accused of stealing a five-pound postal note and is
unduly expelled from the posh Osbourne Naval College.  Ronnie (Guy
Edwards) continues to profess his innocence, earning the support of his
pop (Nigel Hawthorne, The Madness of King George) and sis (Rebecca
Pidgeon, Mamet's wife), who eventually hire Robert Morton (Jeremy
Northam, Emma), the country's top attorney, to both defend the boy and
right the good Winslow name.
The case becomes a national frenzy, spawning O.J.-like tabloid stories
and political cartoons as the Winslow family drains its considerable
finances to proceed with the case that most insiders believe is a lost
cause, as well as a colossal waste of both time and money.  Mamet's
characters, while not as slimy and crooked as we're used to, still speak
in hypnotically rhythmic salvos.  Northam really steals the show with
his portrayal of the attention-loving lawyer that can't seem to decide
whether he's involved in the case for the fame, the money, the
moralistic battle or for Pidgeon's Catherine.  And when was the last
time you liked an attorney in a film?  (1:50  G for just about nothing)

Title
Review for Primary Colors (1998)
I love it when a film like Primary Colors (code name: The Big Lewinsky)
opens amid waves of controversy because of its star or its content.
Remember when Hugh Grant got busted with the hooker right before Nine
Months came out?  The unintentionally perfect timing of the release
makes people scrutinize the story and, more specifically, the dialogue
even more than they ordinarily would.  I mean, there were a LOT of
inadvertent blowjob references in Nine Months if you REALLY listened.
Even the tag-line prophesizes the lead-in on the evening news ("What
Went Down on the Way to the Top").
Colors starts right away with the unplanned comparisons to today's
headlines as it shows a campaigning Jack Stanton (John Travolta) and his
amazing handshaking technique.  The right hand is just for shaking,
while the left hand is used as a barometer to judge the recipients
importance, based on how high it ends up on their arm.  You can't help
thinking about his right hand squeezing some bim's hooter while his left
hand is gingerly pulling hers toward his crotch.  Yikes!
The fine art of the handshake is being explained to Henry Burton
(Richard Lester), the idealistic grandson of a great black civil rights
leader.  Henry is being wooed to join Stanton in his bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination.  He is skeptical at first, but
quickly chooses the puffy white Stanton (the Governor of an ominously
unnamed southern state) over his current mentor, a black Congressman who
has left Henry quite disenchanted with politics in general.
Henry realizes that he has finally found the rare politician who
actually cares about the people he represents.  He weeps as he first
sees Stanton in action at an adult literacy center in New York as his
new boss tells a marvelous story about his war-hero uncle who couldn't
get a job because he couldn't read.  Henry stays on board despite
finding out that Stanton not only made up the story, but also scheduled
the appearance just to bed the teacher.
The bumbling teacher is just the tip of the adultery iceberg and not the
only stumbling block en route to the oval office.  There is the
marijuana thing.  There is the draft-dodging thing.  There is the matter
of having an arrest expunged from his permanent record.  And, of course,
there is the mass consumption of barbecue and donuts.
The film is held together by director Mike Nichols (The Birdcage) and
scribe Elaine May (Ishtar), as well as lenser Michael Ballhaus
(GoodFellas).  They capture the conniving underbelly of modern politics
with a keen eye and make us interested in a story that we have all heard
again and again.
Travolta is amazingly Clintonesque as Stanton, a role that I never
believed he could pull off.  He has the raspy voice, the waddle and the
look of genuine concern down cold.  Thompson is not very Hillaryesque,
but this would be the side of her that the public never sees.  The
juiciest roles are saved for Billy Bob and Kathy Bates, the former a
pervert and the latter a lesbian.  They play expert political
strategists with a large dollop of unconditional lunacy, stealing every
scene they're in.  Newcomer Adrian Lester is quite capable as the green
central character and exudes the innocent charm of a Joe Buck or even a
Dirk Diggler.  Larry Hagman has never been better as Stanton's rival,
Freddy Picker.  But I never watched Dallas, so take that statement with
a grain of salt.
Colors has the same kind of fly-on-the-wall, behind-the-scenes feel of
the last two Betty Thomas films, The Late Shift and Private Parts.  It
is powerfully entertaining and thought provoking for the first two
hours, but the last 30 minutes become a bit heavy-handed with its
tiresome ethical message of `doing the right thing'.  The performances
and gratuitous vomiting scene alone make it well worth the trip to your
local cinema.

Title
Review for Claim, The (2000)
Like Oliver Stone and the 1960s, or Barry Levinson and the City of
Baltimore, Michael Winterbottom may be forever associated with Victorian
author Thomas Hardy.  The Claim is the second film Winterbottom has
directed from a script based on one of Hardy's novels (the other was the
stellar Jude, from `Jude the Obscure').  Here, the director borrows the
story from Hardy's  `The Mayor of Casterbridge' but updates the setting
from 19th century Dorset, England to the waning days of the California
Gold Rush.
One of Winterbottom's gifts is his collaboration ability with actors of
various backgrounds, from the professionally trained Kate Winslet to 
errr  well, to Woody Harrelson.  And The Claim's marquee reads like a
who's who of people snubbed by Oscar over the last three years  Sarah
Polley (for 1997's The Sweet Hereafter), Peter Mullan (98's My Name is
Joe) and Wes Bentley (99's American Beauty).  Despite the acting talent
on board, and Winterbottom's familiarity with adapting Hardy's work, The
Claim doesn't work as well as it should.  It's still a decent film, and
it grows more and more interesting as it progresses, but the picture is
as flat as Calista Flockhart.
The film is set during 1867 in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains (it
was filmed in Alberta, British Columbia) and, as the film opens, the
tiny town of Kingdom Come has just welcomed two groups of people to its
settlement.  The first is led by Donald Daglish (Bentley), the chief
engineer of Central Pacific Railroad's expedition.  Daglish and his men
are one step ahead of CP's railroad and are looking for cities that are
topographically and geographically ideal for the construction of said
railroad.
The second group contains only two people  a young woman named Hope
(Polley) and her dying mother, Elena (Nastassja Kinski, who, ironically,
starred in the film version of Hardy's `Tess of the D'Urbervilles').  A
flashback from some two decades earlier tells us that a young Elena and
infant Hope were sold to a complete stranger for a small bag of gold by
none other than Hope's own father, Daniel Dillon.
Years after that callous transaction, Dillon (Mullan) parlayed the gold
into Kingdom Come.  He owns everything in the town and has settled down
with Lucia, the Portuguese manager of the local whorehouse (Milla
Jovovich, The Messenger).  Dillon has enough gold to open a private wing
in Fort Knox but needs a train station placed in his town for it to have
a chance to become a real city.  Of course, his plans for Kingdom Come
get put on the back burner when his former wife and grown daughter
stumble back into his life.
There's enough romantic potential in the film (Hope and Daglish, Daglish
and Lucia, Lucia and Dillon, Dillon and Elena, and a bizarre side story
focusing on a one of Daglish's workmen and a common hooker), but none of
it amounts to much.  The Claim certainly looks great  from the
realistic sets and props, to Alwin H. Kuchler's sound photography of the
snow, wind, trees and mountains  although it's not as quite as chilly
and bleak as A Time for Drunken Horses, or as pretty as Snow Falling on
Cedars.
Of the actors, Mullan and Polley are the only standouts.  Bentley, who
looks surprisingly like Tobey Maguire in Ride With the Devil, doesn't
seem as comfortable with his character as he did in Beauty, but he's
still the thinking man's Jared Leto.  Kinski has little to do but cough
up blood.
Winterbottom's direction is pretty ordinary and, for some reason, he
chooses to begin and end several of the scenes with out-of-focus shots.
Instead of having any kind of cinematic effect on the film, it succeeds
only in making viewers think the projectionist has fallen asleep.  It's
good to see Winterbottom return to adapting films from novels, as
opposed to the disappointing Wonderland, which was based on an original
screenplay.  Here, his Welcome to Sarajevo scribe Frank Cottrell Boyce
does the dirty work of taking Hardy's work and transposing it into
America's Wild West.
Interestingly, The Claim was originally called Kingdom Come but had to
change its name because of  hold on to your hats  a Whoopi Goldberg
film bearing the same name.  An online contest was created to choose a
new name, hence we have The Claim  which really applies to Dillon's
original claim to the gold, and then, later, his claim to his family.  A
nice touch, but a dumb name nonetheless.  The film's official website is
probably the best since The Blair Witch Project in terms of interesting
content.

Title
Review for Osmosis Jones (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Whether you're a religious soul or not, there are definitely signs of the
Apocalypse around you.  I'm talking about harbingers like earthquakes, fires
and volcanic eruptions, not to mention a hayseed becoming the leader of the
free world (Dubya really put the "goober" in gubernatorial back in Texas).
Toss in a PG-rated movie directed by the Farrelly brothers, and even I'm
ready to start in with the Hail Marys.
The sicker folks out there will be happy to learn that Osmosis Jones is a
"hard" PG and the Farrellys' penchant for gags involving bodily secretions
is left largely intact.  The film was toned down from a PG-13 to be a bit
more family-friendly, although the deleted scenes would be perfect for the
DVD.  Whether Jones is any good is hardly relevant; the real question has
become "How suitable is this film for my sweet, precious children that I
drop off at daycare while I go to work to make the $600 minivan payments?"
Well, here's your answer:  I don't know.  I don't have kids.  But I do know
jokes about puke, exploding zits and blow-drying your hair with a fart make
me giggle like a third grader.  Feel free to base your decision on my
intelligence level.
Jones is a modern blend of the Oscar-winning Fantastic Voyage plus animation
to portray the goings-on inside the body of a regular Joe.  Our Joe is Frank
Detorri (Bill Murray, Charlie's Angels), an employee of the New England
Memorial Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island (like the Farrellys would set a
film anywhere else).  Frank is a slob, not only in appearance but in his
eating habits, as well.  In the opening scene, we see him prepare a
hard-boiled egg, top it with mayonnaise and about a tablespoon of salt, only
to have it yanked away by a caged monkey.  The two wrestle, and although the
egg lands in the chimp's mouth and then on the bottom of his feces-ridden
cage, Frank downs it like it ain't no thang.
But wouldn't you know it, the egg is carrying a virus, and the majority of
the film shows Frank's animated innards trying to wipe the intruder out
before it's too late (the cartoon parts were helmed by a pair of animated
storyboard artists - Shrek's Tom Sito and The Iron Giant's Piet Kroon).  Not
exactly an original idea, but Jones stays interesting by making Frank's guts
into The City of Frank, a bustling place complete with a Mayor (voiced by
William Shatner, Miss Congeniality), traffic, a police force (of white blood
cells) and everything else you'd expect to find in a densely populated
metropolis.
Chris Rock (Down to Earth) voices the titular Osmosis Jones, a cop assigned
to partner with a cherry-flavored, time-release, Buzz Lightyear-esque cold
pill named Drix (David Hyde Pierce, Frasier) to fight the diabolical Thrax
(Laurence Fishburne, The Matrix), who wants to take Frank down in 48 hours.
And when I say, "take Frank down," I mean kill, not send to bed with the
sniffles.  Thrax is like the King Midas of germs, quickly infecting
everything he touches with his red, glowing finger.
What follows is the basic buddy/cop-flick routine, with the unconventional
Jones trying to convince the straight-laced Drix to think outside the box.
There's a big battle (including another frigging spoof of the slo-mo
fighting in The Matrix, but it's funny here because of Fishburne's
involvement), music (Kid Rock and the late Joe C. contribute) and a lot of
very funny signs that probably require a second and third viewing to fully
appreciate (like "Mouth Open; Epiglottis Closed" when Frank yawns).
Instead of having its animated and live-action characters share the screen
at the same time (like the awful Space Jam and Cool World), Jones is broken
into two distinct pieces.  The majority of the film takes place in the City
of Frank, but the funniest (and grossest) portions involve Frank interacting
with his worried daughter (Elena Franklin), his equally disgusting best
friend (Chris Elliott, Scary Movie 2) and a schoolteacher (Molly Shannon,
Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas).  Some people seemed to think the
live-action stuff was thrown in as an afterthought, but I thought it worked
a lot better than the animation (at least laugh-wise) and wished there was
more Murray.  As is, Jones is entertaining, but would have been a lot better
if it wasn't geared toward families - it doesn't go far enough for adults,
but probably steps over the line a few times for a kiddie pic.

Title
Review for Hush (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Hush is a preposterous little film starring Jessica Lange as an evil
mother-in-law who will go to any length to get a grandson.  The only way
that a story this insipid could be any good would be if it was a very
campy black comedy.  Hush, instead, is sold as a thriller but comes off
as more of a Lifetime movie of the week.
Lange (Blue Sky) stars as Martha Baring, the
at-first-nice-but-later-flat-out-crazy mother of Jackson (Jonathon
Schaech, That Thing You Do!).  She's a single Mom (her husband was
killed when Jackson was a boy) who single handedly runs a sprawling
horse farm named Kilronan.  As the picture opens, she is anxiously
awaiting her son's return home from New York City for the holidays.
Helen, (Gwyneth Paltrow, Great Expectations) his big city girlfriend is
in tow.
The two women start off on an awkward foot, with Martha accidentally
walking in on a nude Helen.  Perhaps this is her chance to see if Helen
has the proper hips for child bearing.  Evidently passing the quick peek
test, Martha does what any good mother-in-law would do by tampering with
Helen's diaphragm.  A pregnancy and a wedding quickly ensue.
The rest is your basic uninspired fodder.  Helen slowly learns the deep
dark family secrets, but it's too late.  The only person she has to turn
to is Martha's mother-in-law, Alice (Nina Foch), who has found herself
unceremoniously cast from the family upon her son's death.  Foch, an
Oscar nominee for Executive Suite, is the only redeeming quality among
the so-so performances by the other cast members.
I'm not going to get into the unbelievable parts.  Like how Helen is
knocked up on New Year's Eve but isn't showing at all in a scene that
takes place during the summer.  Or the part where she gets attacked,
sliced and diced in the hallway of her New York City loft apartment but
incredibly has mascara intact after being treated in the emergency
room.  By the way, her attacker has got to be one of the most obvious
`mysteries' of film history.
Martha is a woman so evil and diabolical that she regularly attends
church, but Lange comes off as only slightly mischievous.  While there
was a great vomiting scene and that naked first encounter, this film was
still boring and painful to watch.  Luckily, I was alone in the theater
and could freely laugh out loud at the absurdity of it all.

Title
Review for I Got the Hook Up (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
With a title like I Got the Hook Up, you should immediately be worried.
I mean, when was the last time that a black comedy that didn't feature
at least one Wayans brother was watchable, let alone good?  Sure,
there's always the chance that it could be the next She's Gotta Have It,
Hollywood Shuffle or Fear of a Black Hat, which respectively launched
theerrr'successful' careers of Spike Lee, Robert Townsend and Rusty
Cundeiff.  These three films, in addition to Christopher Scott Cheron's
upcoming gem Hav Plenty, are certainly rare exceptions in this
specialized genre of 90's film.
Hook Up stars Master P, who is apparently a popular rap star.  This may
or may not be true, but since I don't run with that type of crowd, I'll
just have to believe what I read.  Don't get me wrong  I'm down with
the family  I just don't get why these rap guys can suddenly call
themselves actors.  Actually, now that I think about it, it probably has
something to do with rap being a whole lot of bullshit posturing.  But I
digress
P, who starred in the direct-to-video sleeper I'm Bout It, joins
stand-up comedian A.J. Johnson (Woo) as the main characters Black and
Blue.  Don't ask me which is which because I have absolutely no frigging
idea.  These two knuckleheads run some sort of junkyard Wal-Mart,
selling everything from broken appliances to stolen stereo equipment.
When they stumble on a vanload of cellular phones, you just know they're
gonna get busy with some phat bankrolls.
Through some type of elaborate scheme with a horny telephone employee
(Gretchen Palmer, Wishmaster), the Black and Blue are able to activate
and sell the phones to all of the neighborhood homiez.  And I say
`elaborate' only because I didn't understand what was happening.  I
consider myself to be fairly bright, but I didn't quite comprehend how
they kept getting the phones delivered to them after they sold the first
shipment.
At one point, P blurts out the memorable line `It can't get no worser
that this' and damn if he ain't right.  There are a few very funny
scenes involving a funeral catfight, a retard drive-by shooting and a
secret stash of dildos and chocolate syrup.  But these moments are very
far and few between.
It's not as bad as Booty Call, and that's the nicest thing that I can
think of saying.

Review for Spring Forward (1999)
Remember when Johnny Depp used to make good films and Michael Stipe used
to make good music?  At some point over the last couple of years, the
two seemed to undergo some sort of swap.  Depp has struck out with roles
in awful films like The Astronaut's Wife and The Ninth Gate, while
playing guitar for a band called P (which, ironically, has a song about
Stipe).  Meanwhile, Stipe produced three of 1999's best films (Being
John Malkovich, American Movie and The Limey), but R.E.M.'s sales
figures have plummeted.
Stipe has also produced Spring Forward  an action fan's worst
nightmare. There's nothing a knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing Van Damme
fan hates more than a character study, and that's just what they'll get
here.  But Forward is so much more than a film heavy in dialogue and
deficient in superfluous action.  In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find
a picture that bests Forward in the arenas of acting, directing and
writing.  It is clearly one of the year's best films, but, sadly, the
lack of a major distributor will likely hamper any shot at well-deserved
year-end accolades.
Already the winner of numerous film festival awards, Forward is set over
the course of one year in a small Connecticut town.  The film is
comprised of seven sections that focus on two Parks & Recreation
Department workers.  Murph (Ned Beatty, Cookie's Fortune) has been
married for nearly half a century and is less than a year away from
retirement.  Paul (Liev Schreiber, Scream 3) is a young high school
dropout who has just been released from prison.
As you would expect, their relationship doesn't start off on the right
foot, but as the film progresses, the two men begin to open up to each
other despite the differences in their age and backgrounds.  Surprising
parts of their lives surface, and Murph and Paul begin to bond as New
England's seasons change around them.  By the time the closing credits
roll, the seasons have made a complete arc, as has the relationship
between Murph and Paul.
Although it sounds like it, Forward isn't an Odd Couple ripoff.  Murph
and Paul are two real, down-to-Earth blue-collar guys, and the film
doesn't shove heavy-handed moral lessons or bonding crap down your
throat either (otherwise it would be like another Forward  as in Pay
It).  In a film this finely written, cinematography hardly matters, but
Forward is handsomely photographed by Terry Stacey, from television's
hastily cancelled medical drama Wonderland.
Forward is an astonishing debut from writer/director Tom Gilroy, who
previously played bit parts in a bunch of independent films.  Some
people may have big problems with Gilroy's style, which leaves a lot of
unanswered questions instead of neatly wrapping up every loose end.
Murph and Paul meet various people while painting fences and fixing
gazebos, but once the scenes end, those characters disappear from the
film.  It's a bold move, especially when you consider that some of those
roles are played by some pretty established actors  like Ian Hart
(Wonderland), Campbell Scott (The Impostors) and Peri Gilpin (Frasier).
But this technique allows viewers to concentrate on the fantastically
realistic performances given by Beatty and Schreiber.

Review for Keeping the Faith (2000)
Did you hear the one about the priest, the rabbi and the Scientologist?
It's not a joke, but rather Keeping the Faith, the directorial debut of
Hollywood wunderkind Ed Norton, who co-produced the film with his buddy
(and the film's screenwriter) Stuart Blumberg.  Norton casts himself as
the priest, Ben Stiller as the rabbi and Jenna Elfman  a Scientologist
in real life  plays the woman that comes between the two pious pals.
Like Norton's Fight Club, the film has the disheveled star telling most
of the film through flashback, this time as his character Father Brian
Finn.  In the sixth grade, Brian and his best friend Jacob Schram
(Stiller, Black & White) form an inseparable, platonic bond with fellow
student Anna Reilly (Elfman, Dharma & Greg).  The three are joined at
the hip for two years, until Anna's father gets a job transfer.  Brian
and Jacob remain close, but they never see Anna again.
As adults, Brian and Jacob pursue their respective spiritual careers,
incorporating honest, comedic routines to their sermons, which soon are
delivered to packed rooms as the word spreads through their neighborhood
that faith is hip again.  Nicknamed `The God Squad,' the priest and
rabbi even plan to open a multi-faith senior citizen karaoke/dance club
to which their flocks can flock.  Everything is going well, until Anna
calls and announces that she's coming to New York for an extended
business trip.
Of course, when the two men pick Anna up at the airport, they find that
she's a stone-cold fox. Despite previously having only a friendly,
non-physical relationship with Anna, you know it won't be long before
Brian and Jacob are beating their chests and tugging at her like two
lions tearing apart a gazelle.  Yup  there's nothing like vagina to
ruin a good friendship.  And unless you're talking about a Gregg Araki
film, there is really only two ways the film can end  Anna leaves New
York alone and Brian and Jacob stay friends, or Anna stays in New York
and all three remain friends.
Faith has a very funny trailer, which is always a concern these days
since it seems that a film's best moments are usually shown in its
preview.  That's not the case here, as Faith blows through most of the
trailer's highlights in the first five minutes.  There are some great
religious gags in the film, usually revolving around Judaism (Jacob
plays with `Heroes of the Torah' playing cards and is dogged by
persistent Jewish mothers that fix him up on dates that he can't
refuse), while Norton uses the film to show off his dead-on impressions
of Rain Man and Latka Gravas.  The usually annoying Elfman is downright
charming as the high-powered something-or-other businesswoman.
Two-time Oscar nominee Norton, who has already logged five amazing
performances in just six major releases, lets the film get away from him
about two-thirds of the way through, where things begin to drag.  It's
really too bad, because Faith would be a great film if about twenty
minutes were hacked out of it.  His style is pretty unobtrusive (save a
few odd shots during a sex scene), which may have something to do with
the actor working with heavy-hitting directors like Milos Forman (The
People vs. Larry Flynt), David Fincher (The Fight Club) and Woody Allen
(Everyone Says I Love You), the latter of whom was an obvious influence
on Norton.  Faith contains plenty of shots of its characters yelling at
each other on the sidewalks of New York.
Norton even casts Forman in Faith.  Has the student become the master?
Not quite, but it's certainly a promising debut.

Title
Review for Return to Me (2000)
Actress Bonnie Hunt's first venture behind the camera is a cute romantic
comedy that is surprisingly light on the romance and heavy on the
comedy.  Hunt, who created her own hysterical but short-loved network
sitcom (called The Bonnie Hunt Show) several years ago, shows a natural
flair for comedic set-up and timing, but Return to Me isn't as
well-executed as it could have been.
The somewhat intriguing script, co-written with three other novices,
focuses on Bob and Elizabeth Rueland, a happily married Chicago couple
played by David Duchovny (The X-Files) and Joely Richardson (101
Dalmatians).  He's a successful building contractor and she works with
gorillas at the Lincoln Park Zoo.  The picture-perfect duo comes
complete with a big house, a pair of big noses and a big dog.  One
night, after a zoo fundraiser, the Ruelands are the apparent victims of
a car crash (it's not shown on screen).  Bob escapes with a few bumps
and bruises, but Elizabeth doesn't make it.
Meanwhile, far away, in another part of town, a young, single woman
named Grace Briggs (Minnie Driver, An Ideal Husband) lays on her
deathbed, desperately hoping to find a donor heart to extend her time
limit on this mortal coil.  Her best friend Megan (Hunt, The Green Mile)
watches over her in the hospital, while her grandfather Marty (Carroll
O'Connor, In the Heat of the Night) and his cronies keep good thoughts
for her as they run a business called O'Reilly's Italian Restaurant (the
funniest screen eatery since `The La Trattoria' from Mickey Blue Eyes).
Of course, Grace receives Elizabeth's heart and, over a year later, she
meets and falls in love with Bob.  Their romance is sweet and
predictable, but the lovebirds aren't on the screen as much as you might
expect.  Instead, Return seems to spend only about one-third of its
ample two-hour running time on Bob and Grace.  The remaining time is
divided between Hunt's Megan and her crazy family (including a loudmouth
husband played by James Belushi), and Grandpa Marty and his elderly
friends.
I kind of got the impression that Return's romance angle didn't play
well with test audiences, who clamored for more scenes with Megan's
family and the old coots.  Don't get me wrong; these two aspects of the
film are the best it has to offer, but I'm from the school of thought
that the two main characters should actually be on the screen more than
anybody else.  I'm guessing that nobody is going to see this movie with
the intention of hearing two Irishmen (O'Connor and Eddie Jones), an
Italian (Robert Loggia) and a Pole (Wally Jatczak) argue about who the
greatest crooner of all-time is  Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra or Bobby
Vinton.  It kind of smacks of the opening scene in Reservoir Dogs.
Duchovny does a pretty good job trying to ditch the stiff persona of his
television character but  c'mon  is he ever going to be anyone but Fox
Mulder?  Driver is very likeable as Grace, perpetually embarrassed of
the giant surgical scar that runs down her chest (and to think that some
men pay handsome subscription rates to `Scarred Skanks' magazine).  She
legitimately seems like she's in love, while Duchovny looks like he just
lost control of his bowels.

Title
Review for Dinner Rush (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Bob Giraldi hasn't directed a film since 1987's Hiding Out with Jon Cryer,
but his 14-year absence from the feature-film game must have honed his
talent and style (maybe Tim Burton should take a decade or two off, too).
Seen largely as "only" a director of television commercials (he's won four
Clio Awards) and music videos (like Michael Jackson's "Beat It"), Giraldi
has made one of this year's niftiest self-financed pictures with Dinner
Rush.
For the most part, Rush takes place over one evening in Gigino Trattoria, an
upscale Tribeca eatery frequented by the cream of Manhattan's crop. The
masses, it seems, are attracted to Gigino because of head chef Udo Cropa's
(Edoardo Ballerini, Romeo Must Die) exotic dishes. In fact, the place has
become so successful, Udo's pop, Louis (Danny Aiello, The Last Don), who is
Gigino's owner, no longer runs numbers out of the restaurant to bolster his
profits.
With a huge reservation list and a son who is quickly becoming one of the
city's most popular chefs, you'd think Louis would be on Cloud 9, but he's
got more issues than Tony Soprano. For starters, his business partner was
just gunned down by two Queens mobsters known as Black and Blue (Alex
Corrado and The Bone Collector's Mike McGlone), who now want a piece of
Louis' business.  Udo wants to take over Gigino because his unique culinary
skills have made the place a hit, but Louis won't even eat anything his son
makes, preferring sausage and peppers prepared by a cook named Duncan (Kirk
Acevedo, Oz).
Like nearly everyone else in Rush, Duncan has his share of problems, too.
He's neck-deep in debt to his bookie after taking a bath on a St. John's
basketball game, and his growing attraction to Gigino's attractive hostess
(Vivian Wu, 8 1/2 Women) could cause trouble because she's Udo's girlfriend.
Imagine the animosity in the restaurant's basement kitchen, with Udo being
forced to compete with Duncan for both his woman and his father's affection.
That's the background, which is nicely fleshed out by the debut script from
Brian S. Kalata and Rick Shaughnessy, but there's more trouble in store for
Louis on the evening in which most of the film's action takes place. As
usual, Gigino is packed full of hungry customers, including Black and Blue,
who may or may not be there to rub Louis out. An important food critic
(Sandra Bernhard) must be kept happy, while a smarmy gallery owner (Mark
Margolis, Hannibal) harasses a waitress who dreams of one day becoming an
artist herself (Summer Phoenix, S.L.C. Punk!).
Meanwhile, Gigino's drink-slinger (Jamie Harris, Fast Food Fast Women)
amazes everyone at the bar (including a Wall Street trader played by Sex and
the City's John Corbett). Oh, and there's also a power outage (warmly lensed
by first-timer Tim Ives) plus a finale that wouldn't seem out of place in a
John Woo film. The intermingling of Gigino's customers, cooks and wait staff
is impeccably written and very nicely edited by Allyson C. Johnson, an
assistant on Spike Lee's He Got Game and Summer of Sam.
It'd be easy to sum up Rush's story by saying it's Big Night meets The
Sopranos (with a little Oz on the side because of Acevedo and Margolis), but
it's more a story about different worlds clashing with each other: Louis'
traditional Italian ideas toward food colliding with Udo's new-school
cuisine, the old neighborhood restaurant being replaced by a hipper,
trendier crowd. Even the basement kitchen makes for interesting symbolism -
it's like the Titanic, with the sweaty blue-collar folks in the lowest
level, and social rank rising as you ascend.
Rush's Gigino is modeled after Giraldi's own eatery (he owns several) and
its namesake, acclaimed chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. You can tell the
film is a labor of love, just like Big Night, and it stands a chance at
making you nearly as hungry, even though its story isn't quite as based in
food and its preparation. If this isn't a ringing endorsement, I don't know
what is: At the Sarasota Film Festival (which Rush opened), Aiello said he
had seen the film eight times and stayed to watch it again, even though he
usually only sees his pictures once.

Title
Review for Kid, The (2000)
Imagine Hollywood had something similar to baseball^Ňs Hall of Fame and
that retired/dead stars had to have their entire careers summarized in a
brief paragraph on a bronze plaque hanging in an overpriced tourist
attraction somewhere in Los Angeles. What the heck would Bruce Willis^Ň
plaque say? Would it mention his great work in edgy films like Pulp
Fiction and Twelve Monkeys? Probably not. Would the plaque list the
actor^Ňs popular action films like Die Hard and Armageddon? Maybe, but
this is probably how Willis^Ň plaque would read:
^ÓBorn in West Germany, ^ŃBruno^Ň made the successful leap from bartender
to television^Ňs Moonlighting to feature films in the late 1980s. Willis
was best known for starring opposite talented child actors and providing
the voices for infants. He was married to actress Demi Moore for ten
years, and the two superstars had three kids with really dumb names^Ô
Okay, the last part might not make it on there, but you get the point.
Despite having a pretty eclectic resumé, Willis^Ň career may be
remembered this way. Why? Because the following mathematical formula is
the hottest thing in Hollywood: ^ÓWillis + pre-pubescent boy + clever
script = box office gold^Ô
The movie with the kid who could see dead people made how much money?
Quick, let^Ňs get Willis in something else with a kid right away. The
result is Disney^Ňs The Kid, a whimsical tale about a grumpy workaholic
that gets in touch with the kid he used to be by actually meeting the
kid he used to be. That^Ňs right; through some sort of kooky Freaky
Friday movie magic, the grouch actually meets himself at age seven.
Willis (The Whole Nine Yards) plays Russell Morley Duritz, an
over-stressed image consultant with a twitchy left eye. The Kid^Ňs first
five minutes sets up Russell as a maniacal jerk that shuns his own
family but helps his crooked, high-profile clients look better in the
public^Ňs eye. Though this is supposed to make Russell an unsympathetic
character, I couldn^Ňt help but think that the world would be a better
place with more people like him. He^Ňs smart, efficient and cuts through
the bull with a blunt honesty that comes off as rude and arrogant. If
saying things that are on your mind is a bad thing, then lock me up.
A few days before his fortieth birthday, Russell begins seeing some
strange things. A red bi-plane seems to be following him around and a
snot-nosed kid appears in his house, somehow evading his
state-of-the-art security system. At first, he thinks he^Ňs hallucinating
the whole thing, but after comparing scars and birthmarks, he realizes
that the kid, Rusty (Spencer Breslin from the short-lived Dan Ackroyd
sitcom Soul Man), is really himself from thirty-two years ago.
The rest of The Kid involves Russell hating Rusty and trying to get rid
of him, but eventually growing attached to the boy and learning a little
bit about himself in the process before the film winds down to a
two-hankie finale that should choke up anyone that has recently had a
pulse. I^Ňm sure The Kid will hit home with anyone under age twelve or
over age forty, but everybody else might just roll their eyes at the
films sentimentality, which is hammered home by South Park musical
collaborator Marc Shaiman^Ňs sweeping score.
Breslin is a revelation as young Rusty, who shrieks his disappointment
that he grows up to be wife-less, dog-less and cool-job-less. Willis
plays a pretty good tight-ass but looks like he^Ňs having way too much
fun doing it. There are times when Willis is barely able to stifle his
smirk when he^Ňs supposed to be miserable. He did nasty and irritable
much better with General William Devereaux in The Siege. Willis^Ň
apparent new best friend Matthew Perry makes a funny unbilled cameo, as
well.
The Kid^Ňs script, which was written by Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award
winner Audrey Wells (Guinevere), is pretty clever for a family film, but
it had a bunch of problems, too. Russell spends his whole life trying to
distance himself from his past, yet somehow has totally forgotten the
most traumatic event that ever happened to him. And the film is dragged
down a bit by the romance between Russell and his perky moralistic
sidekick (played by British waif Emily Mortimer, Love^Ňs Labour^Ňs Lost).
She^Ňs not even the best match for Russell. He would have been better off
with his wisecracking personal assistant (Lily Tomlin, Tea With
Mussolini) or a local television news anchor (Jean Smart from Wells^Ň
Guinevere).
The Kid was directed by Jon Turteltaub, who has helmed such
non-kid-friendly films as Instinct and Phenomenon. It plays pretty
similarly to a couple of films that have already come out this year,
especially the arthouse release of Pip Karmel^Ňs Me Myself I, where
Rachel Griffiths goes through a similar ordeal on her thirtieth
birthday. You know, movies like these are the reason people dread the
big 3-0 and 4-0 (and beyond). They aren^Ňt upset about getting older ^Ö
they^Ňre worried about having to meet themselves.

Review for Trembling Before G-d (2001)

Review for Big Kahuna, The (1999)
Based on Roger Rueff's play `Hospitality Suite,' The Big Kahuna is the
first film to be made by two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey's new
production company, Trigger Street Productions.  Kahuna is set almost
entirely in a sixteenth-floor hotel suite in Wichita, where three
industrial lubricant salesmen for Lodestar Laboratories contemplate the
meaning of life while pitching their wares to prospective clients over
hors d'oeuvres and an open bar.
Any film that features salesmen who love to gab risks being compared to
David Mamet's far superior Glengarry Glen Ross.  But Kahuna borrows
ideas from more films than just Mamet's masterpiece.  Since the three
principal actors are crammed into a hotel room for most of the picture,
your mind will likely wander to those rascally kids in The Breakfast
Club.  When they talk about the greatest salesman in Lodestar history,
you can't help but remember the Saturday Night Live skit where the guys
talk up a legend by the name of Bill Brasky.  And when an important
client (`The Big Kahuna') doesn't show up to their meet-and-greet, you
get a little taste of Beckett's `Waiting for Godot.'
Offering little else but dialogue, Kahuna is one of those films where
each character experiences some kind of major life change by the time
the closing credits start to roll.  Bob Walker (Peter Facinelli,
Supernova) is an eager, young, Bible-thumping newlywed with no
experience and even less personality.  Larry Mann (Spacey, American
Beauty) sees a lot of his younger self in Bob, even though he's become a
cynical, middle-aged bully.  Phil Cooper (Danny DeVito, Drowning Mona)
is already over the hill, dreads the prospect of watching his life come
to end, and chooses to fritter his time reading pornography.
As the three bicker about work and religion, it feels like you're
trapped in the room with them  and I don't mean that in a good way.
Kahuna begins and ends fairly promisingly (aside from the obnoxious Baz
Lurhmann song "Everybody's Free [To Wear Sunscreen]' playing over the
closing credits), but the middle is very slow.  It's still worth a trip
to the theatre just to see Kahuna's first-rate acting.  Spacey hasn't
skipped a beat since his [insert award name here] winning performance in
Beauty.  DeVito delivers what could be his best performance to date, and
Facinelli makes the most of his biggest part yet.

Review for Siunin Wong Fei-hung tsi titmalau (1993)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Iron Monkey director Yuen Woo-ping hasn't helmed a film in over six years,
and although he's hardly a household name in the U.S., many may know him as
the guy responsible for choreographing the incredible fight scenes in Oscar
winners The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Thanks to Quentin
Tarantino, who has a more-than-decent track record when it comes to
releasing cooler-than-cool Asian films in the States (see Chungking Express,
Sonatine and Mighty Peking Man), people will finally understand why overseas
audiences yawned when they saw Crouching Tiger.
Monkey was originally released in 1993 (it's already available here on video
and DVD) and was such a big hit that its sequel is now five years old.  The
movie is somewhat of a prequel to the immensely popular and much revered
Once Upon a Time in China, the seven-film (and counting) series that
catapulted Jet Li to international stardom.  Monkey and China, not to
mention Jackie Chan's Drunken Master pictures, tell the story of a Chinese
folk legend named Wong Fei-Hung, who was something like the Davy Crockett of
that country during the mid 1800s.
Here, Fei-Hung is a child (and is played by a young girl named Tsang
Sze-Man), who, along with his father Wong Kei-Ying (Donnie Yen, Highlander:
Endgame), have just arrived in Zhejing, a city run by the crooked Governor
Cheng (James Wong).  With thousands of peasants seeking refuge in the city
courtesy of rural flooding and bloodthirsty warlords, Cheng keeps a huge
stockpile of food while his subjects dine on stone soup.  Their only hope is
Iron Monkey, a mysterious Robin Hood-type who liberates the Governor's gold
and gives it to the commoners.
As you might expect, Iron Monkey, who is really a mild-mannered local doctor
(Yu Rong-guang), is not very well-received by the Governor and the soldiers
who are paid to protect him.  When word arrives that the Royal Minister (Yen
Yee Kwan) is on his way to Zhejing to get to the bottom of the whole Iron
Monkey thing, the Governor panics and orders his soldiers to lock up anybody
who could possibly be the big I.M. (leading to a funny scene with dialogue
like "You sneezed like a monkey.  Now come with me").
Combining the nighttime rooftop air ballet of Crouching Tiger with the humor
and physical comedy of The Three Stooges, Monkey, which is both dubbed and
subtitled, has a jaw-dropping finale that takes place on the business ends
of a bunch of wooden poles.  And like Crouching Tiger, the film offers
strong female characters (the doctor's assistant, played by Jean Wang, kicks
as much ass as anybody in the film).  Monkey was written by, among others,
Hong Kong legend Tsui Hark, who directed four of the Once Upon a Time in
China pictures.  Oh, and you might not want to see Monkey on an empty
stomach because there are a bunch of scenes that revolve around
delicious-looking food and food preparation.
PG-13 for martial arts action/violence and brief sexuality

Title
Review for Fight Club (1999)
David Fincher's (The Game) latest film begins at the end - in a
high-rise office building where protagonist and narrator Jack (Edward
Norton, American History X) is asked, with a pistol jammed into his
mouth, if he has any last words.  The gunman is Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt,
Meet Joe Black), who explains to Jack that he has planted explosives in
several nearby buildings with the intent of leveling several city
blocks.  We know this is the end of the film, and Jack's story is
revealed through his nightmarish narrative flashback.
There is a reason we never learn Jack's name; he's supposed to represent
an anonymous 30-year-old single white professional male - the kind that
is slowly realizing that they have no purpose in life, other than
toiling away in a white-button-down-shirt job all day and watching
sitcoms from the comfort of their IKEA couch at night.  They are the
middle generation  raised by women and without either a Great War or a
Great Depression.  Their great depression is existence.
Once Jack takes us to the beginning of his tale, we learn that he works
for a major automobile manufacturer, investigating accidents caused by
faulty design to determine whether a recall would be cost effective for
the company.  He also suffers from insomnia, a condition that his doctor
refuses to cure via prescription medication.  The doctor suggests
depressed Jack get more exercise and tells him to cheer up, implying
that he check out a support group at St. Christopher's Church to see the
real misery of the human condition.
The support group is for men that have been gelded due to testicular
cancer.  Jack is paired up with Robert Paulsen (Meat Loaf, Black Dog) a
giant man with giant `bitch-tits' as a result of female hormone
treatments.  After a weepy Robert pours his heart out to him, Jack gets
the best night of sleep he's had in months.  As a result, Jack becomes
somewhat of a support-group junkie, attending meetings for victims of
tuberculosis, sickle-cell anemia and melanoma, among other afflictions.
After a year of touring the anguish and sorrow circuit, Jack meets two
people that will change his life forever.  One is Marla Singer (Helena
Bonham Carter, Theory of Flight), a suicidal woman he notices at all of
the support group meetings.  The second is Tyler, a soap salesman with
extensive knowledge in explosives that Jack meets on an airplane.
Because of a fire in his condo, Jack takes up residence with Tyler, who
lives in an immense dilapidated house in an abandoned part of the city.
As Jack and Tyler bond, they discover that pummeling each other is a
great therapeutic way to unload all of the pressure of being young white
men.  They regularly hold fistfights each Saturday outside a dive bar
called Lou's Tavern and soon are joined by other disillusioned young
white men.  Eventually, the `Fight Club' moves into the dirt-floored
basement of Lou's Tavern and is subjected to several rules (you probably
already know the first one).
While Jack is thrilled at the idea of Fight Club and all it represents,
he suspects Tyler of deviant ulterior motives.  Just who is Tyler Durden
and why do all of these complete strangers seem to become his disciples
so quickly?  How did he manage to score Marla as a sex partner?  Jack
also learns that Fight Club is open on nights other than Saturday and
has heard rumors that Durden has opened branches in other cities, as
well.
As their relationship fizzles, so does Jack's remaining semblance of a
life.  He comes to work disheveled, bloodied and without a tie.  He
fantasizes about Marla and he grows increasingly suspicious of Tyler's
nihilistic and mysterious goals of `freeing' men from the drudgery of
their lives.
Fight Club is one heck of a brutally graphic film.  Visually, it's
amazing, with Fincher pulling no punches in creating the gritty
underworld of indifferent men.  The story is based on Chuck Palahniuk's
novel, who allegedly wrote it long-hand while working as a truck
mechanic.  Palahniuk's story will leave some people slack-jawed, some
nauseous, some cold and some afraid to walk through the theater parking
lot to get to their cars.  Thanks to Fincher's direction (as well as his
production team  editor Jim Haygood and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth
from The Game) you can almost feel every punch thrown in the film.
Although there are plenty of fantastic scenes in the film, two in
particular have the misfortune of following recent pictures with similar
content - American Beauty and The Sixth Sense.  I won't say what the
similarities are, but after you see Fight Club, it will be pretty
obvious.  Despite this bad luck, Fight Club is still a fantastic flick
and almost seems ahead of its time in terms of social message and
violent content.

behavior, sexuality and language

Title
Review for Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
In the style of Christopher Guest's fantastic Waiting for Guffman, Drop
Dead Gorgeous is a mockumentary about the Sarah Rose Cosmetics American
Teen Princess beauty pageant trials in Mount Rose, Minnesota.  Mount
Rose is the home of the oldest living Lutheran, or so the sign states as
you enter the burg.  But the mayor explains, through a veil of
obscenities, that the elderly coot actually kicked the bucket several
years earlier, and those damn Lutherans just won't take the sign down.
Only in Mount Rose will you come upon a church that uses grape Kool-Aid
for the blood of Christ.  Only in Mount Rose will you hear phrases like
`beautiful as a whore's ass' and  `Jesus Christ on a cross.'  Only in
Mount Rose will you encounter the reigning Teen Princess residing in
`the bone garden'  the anorexia/bulimia wing of the local hospital.
Only in Mount Rose will you discover that the favorite for this year's
crown is the great white (trash) hope Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst,
Dick), who practices her tap dancing while applying the makeup and
styling the hair of the deceased at the local mortuary.  Only in Mount
Rose will you find Amber's chief competition in Becky Leeman (Denise
Richards, Wild Things), a murderously beautiful vixen from the good side
of the tracks, who will stop at nothing to become the President of the
Lutheran Sisterhood Gun Club, not to mention winning the pageant.
In short, the film project is any aspiring documentary filmmaker's
dream, and, more importantly, doesn't involve chasing urban legends
around the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland.
In Amber's corner are her alcoholic mother Annette (Ellen Barkin, The
Fan) and Loretta (Allison Janney, 10 Things I Hate About You), her mom's
slutty best friend.  Early in the film, Annette is nearly killed when
their trailer suspiciously explodes and is left, tragically, with a beer
can seared to her right hand.
Meanwhile, Becky's camp includes pageant coordinator and emcee Gladys
Leeman (Kirstie Alley, For Richer or Poorer), who not only happens to be
Becky's mom, but is also a former pageant winner from several years (and
several pounds) past.  Becky's pop Lester (Sam McMurray, The Mod Squad)
owns a local furniture store and, luckily, can afford to keep Becky and
Gladys in the lifestyle to which they are accustomed.
Among the three pageant judges are John Dough (Matt Malloy, In the
Company of Men), a pharmacist who seems a little too eager to rate the
blossoming young women, and Harold Vilmes (Michael McShane from the
British version of Whose Line is it Anyway?), who runs the local
hardware store with his retarded brother and constant shadow Hank
(William Sasso).
The other pageant contestants are representatives of just about every
clique that I can remember from high school  the artsy actress who
wears black, the lesbian sports freak and the cheerleading sperm
receptacle, among others.  Each is equally hysterical, but can't quite
hold a candle to Lisa Swenson (Brittany Murphy, Clueless and the voice
of LuAnn on King of the Hill) who gives yet another scene-stealing
performance.  Also of note is Gladys' pageant crony Iris Clark (Mindy
Sterling, Austin Powers).
Originally titled Dairy Queens, Gorgeous was directed by Michael Patrick
Jann from the under-viewed but consistently entertaining sketch comedy
show called The State, which ran on MTV several years ago.  The caustic,
crisp script was written by Lona Williams, a producer from The Drew
Carey Show, and the film's music is from Devo alum Mark Mothersbaugh.
Viewers may not know that films with a PG-13 rating are only allowed to
use the dreaded `F' word once, and the filmmakers save it up for a
whopper of a line at the end of the picture.  (1:37 - PG-13 for
irreverent and crude humor, sex-related material and language)

Title
Review for Kikujiro no natsu (1999)
Former Japanese game-show host Takeshi `Beat' Kitano wrote, directed and
stars in this flawless follow-up to his critically acclaimed Fireworks
(Hana Bi).  Fans of Kitano's previous work may be surprised that there
are no bloody shoot-outs between cops and Yakuza gang members in this
film - Kikujiro is a surprisingly touching yet achingly hysterical story
about a kid that spends his summer vacation searching for his mother
with the help of a two-bit hoodlum.
Masao (Yusuke Sekiguchi, in his screen debut) is a nine-year-old boy
that lives with his grandmother (Kazuko Yoshiyuki, Fireworks) but longs
to see the mother that he has never known (he is told that she is busy
working in another city and that his father is dead).  Armed only with
an address and a photograph, Masao plans to make the journey on his own,
but ends up being escorted by his neighbor, the lazy, cantankerous
Kikujiro Takeda (brilliantly played by Kitano) after his no-nonsense
wife (Kayoko Kishimoto) orders him to accompany the boy.
What unfolds is basically a road movie where the two characters learn
that they really have more in common than they thought.  At one point,
they even buy matching Hawaiian shirts, so you can think of Kikujiro as
a cross between Planes, Trains & Automobiles and Twins.  Kikujiro stars
out hating the youngster, making Masao stand outside a restaurant while
he eats comfortably inside.  Then he blows all of Masao's money at the
track, causing the rest of the journey to be a little `bare-boned.'
There's a bit of a surprise when the two weary travelers finally arrive
at their destination, and Kikujiro spends the rest of the film trying to
salvage Masao's school break.  To say that this is accomplished via two
bikers and several comedic skits (complete with makeup and costumes)
probably wouldn't make much sense, so I'm not even going to get into
that here.  I will say that Kikujiro has a lot of funny and insulting
lines that he gets to hurl at just about everybody in sight. `Joker,'
`Baldy,' `Brat,' and `Smart Aleck,' are among his favorites, while the
memorable line, `Dummy, you're no genius,' may have lost something
during the translation into English.
Kikujiro is told mainly though flashbacks using Masao's `How I Spent My
Summer Vacation' school project to title the different segments of the
film (with uproarious names like `Mister is Crazy,' `It Didn't Work
Out,' and `Mister Fell Down Stairs').  The film effortlessly floats
between slapstick and heart-tugging drama, and if this project was about
the Holocaust and had Miramax's publicity juggernaut behind it, Kitano
would probably be a Benigni-esque triple Oscar nominee next spring.

Title
Review for Nightwatch (1998)
Nightwatch is finally coming out.  This film has been scheduled for
release more often than I masturbate.  It's never a good thing when a
studio continuously delays an opening, but they had a good reason to
with this one.  The procrastination was presumably due to last minute
attempts to somehow edit Ewan's cock into the picture.  He loves to
display his meats.  That's just my theory, but until somebody comes up
with another one, we'll just stick with mine.
A remake of Bordenal's allegedly superior Portuguese film (called
Nattevagten), Nightwatch follows the poor employment choice of law
student Martin (Ewan McGregor, Trainspotting).  Martin takes what he
thinks will be an easy gig - as a night watchman at the city morgue.
Even Catherine and James (Patricia Arquette and Josh Brolin, Flirting
with Disaster), his whiny girlfriend and whack-job best friend, can't
persuade Martin that it is way too creepy while Martin is convinced that
it will be easier to get his studying done in the ultra-quiet confines
on his new employer.
On his first day, Martin is given a quick, but funny, walk through of
his job responsibilities, courtesy of the crusty old guy who previously
held the position.  Now, I don't know how a real morgue works, but there
are apparently the magical keys spread all about the morgue.  In an
attempt to prove that he's actually patrolling the place, the watchman
has to take this lock-box thing around to the keys in a bizarre hourly
Easter egg-like hunt.  Of course, one of these keys is in the room where
they keep the bodies.  When Martin is told to be careful because the
door doesn't open from the inside, you can only imagine what will happen
on the last reel.  The cadaver room also has these creepy white
pull-cords that hang down from the ceiling, which are evidently used in
case someone mistakenly brings a living person in.  Just the fact that
this ever happens kind of creeps me out.
Anyway, Martin finds himself caught up in this stupid paint-by-number
rape/murder mystery.  Did I mention that he is the dumbest law student
since JFK, Jr.?  The smartest thing Martin does is comparing his
situation with a USA network movie.  You're not too far off, pal.  It
does boast a powerhouse collection of hip modern rock songs.  Songs that
you just don't hear on the USA.
Nightwatch does have a terrific dark and gritty look to it, similar to
last year's disappointment Mimic, which Bordenal produced and
Cinematographer Dan Laustsen shot.  The story is a big letdown,
especially coming from Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies & videotape).  The
identity of the killer is fairly obvious pretty early on, unlike the
current sexy thriller, Wild Things.

Title
Review for Lucky Numbers (2000)
A few years back, Nora Ephron seemed like one of Hollywood's rising
stars.  She nabbed three Oscar nominations early in her career for
penning a Mike Nichols film (Silkwood) and two Meg Ryan films (When
Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle, the latter of which she
directed).  But Ephron's last few projects have practically erased any
of the positive memories she created earlier in her career.
First came You've Got Mail, the ill-conceived remake of The Shop Around
the Corner.  Then Ephron wrote and produced Hanging Up, an irritating
film based on an enjoyable book written by her sister Delia.  Now it's
Lucky Numbers' turn to squander A-list stars in a film that could have
been a lot better in the right hands.
Numbers is set in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania during the holiday season of
1988.  The film's main character is Russ Richards (John Travolta,
Battlefield Earth), an annoyingly popular television weatherman with his
own parking space at his favorite restaurant (Denny's) for his Jaguar
convertible.  Russ makes good money but squanders it on bad business
investments.  The latest  a snowmobile dealership  is struggling
because of unseasonably warm weather.  When the film opens, we see the
game-show-host wannabe served with foreclosure papers on his huge
suburban home.
When his boss (Ed O'Neill, The Bone Collector) refuses to give him an
advance, Russ turns to Gig (Tim Roth, The Legend of 1900), a strip club
owner who suggests the beleaguered personality fix the Pennsylvania
State Lottery, which picks its numbers from Russ' television station. To
do so, he must enlist the aid of Crystal Latroy (Lisa Kudrow, Hanging
Up), the station's Vanna White-like Lotto girl, to help pull off the
scam.
The first half of Numbers is somewhat promising and well-paced, but the
second half really comes apart at the seams.  There is so much
backstabbing and double-crossing, it's hard to tell up from down.  This
is complicated by the fact that there isn't one sympathetic character in
the film, so the aforementioned backstabbing and double-crossing has
little effect. Even worse is a worthless subplot involving a lazy cop
(Bill Pullman, Brokedown Palace) who may or may not be hot on the trail
of Russ and Crystal.
Travolta looks frightening, even sans the Battlefield Earth makeup and
hair.  If you saw him playing a foppish vampire on Saturday Night Live,
you might not be able to shake the image from your head during Numbers.
He has the same creepy haircut.  Watching Travolta and Roth opposite
each other in several scenes makes it clear that one is a terrific
actor, and the other is just calling in the performance.  Kudrow, who
always seemed to be the smartest member of Friends (The Opposite of Sex,
Clockwatchers, Analyze This) until Ephron got a hold of her, shows off
her impressive rack throughout the film.  It's nice to see her play
something other than a ditz.
Numbers was written by Adam Resnick, who directed Chris Elliott's Cabin
Boy and co-produced his Get a Life television series.  The film is
loosely based on events that occurred on April 24, 1980 at WTAE in
Pittsburgh, where an announcer rigged the Daily Numbers drawing.
Numbers even borrows the line "If you've got it, come and get it; if
not, better luck tomorrow" from the real-life story, which became known
as `The 666 Fix' because of the triple-digit combination of numbers the
crooked drawing produced.

Title
Review for Being John Malkovich (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Even if you know the premise of Being John Malkovich before you see it,
the story will still seem very odd.  The idea is simple  a struggling
puppeteer takes an office job and finds a portal to John Malkovich's
brain behind a filing cabinet  but it's still quirky enough to dance
circle after circle around its unoriginal competition.  The film is a
daringly creative, visually stunning and wonderfully acted fantasy.
The film opens on a blue curtained stage, where a marionette performs an
intricate dance before what sounds like a very receptive audience.  We
soon learn that the puppet was created in the image of its maker and
operator, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack, Pushing Tin), that the stage is
located in his workshop and that the crowd noise was just a tape.  An
incredibly gifted but tormented puppeteer, Craig is unable to find work
in the dummy business and is often reduced to working for spare change
on the streets of New York.  He claims that the puppet business shuts
him out because he `raises issues.'
Although Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, There's Something About Mary)
has a full-time job at a pet store, he can no longer afford to wait for
his big break in puppetry.  One day, while perusing the employment
notices, he finds an ad for a local business that is looking for a man
with fast hands.  Thinking this could be the best opportunity to earn
some cash and keep his digits in shape, Craig heads for LesterCorp, but
doesn't bother to cut his Jesus-hair, shave or even change his clothes.
This is when things begin to get weird, as Craig enters LesterCorp's
building only to find it listed in the lobby directory as being located
on Floor 7˝.  There is no elevator button for 7˝, which presents an
immediate problem.  Then, when Craig finally makes it onto 7˝, he finds
a hallway with ceilings only five feet high.  But the furniture and
people are full-sized, which makes everything seem very Alice in
Wonderland-ish.
Craig gets his job  speed filing  and immediately begins working for
his new boss, the 105-year-old Dr. Lester (professional game-show
panelist Orson Bean) and his hearing-impaired `executive liaison' Floris
(Mary Kay Place, Pecker).  His orientation consists of a videotaped
history of his employer's compact floor, where he meets and instantly
falls for the lovely Maxine (Catherine Keener, Your Friends and
Neighbors), before eventually finding the entrance to Malkovich's brain
after accidentally dropping a file behind a cabinet.
Once in Malkovich's brain (Malkovich plays himself), you see things as
he does for fifteen minutes before being shot out of the sky somewhere
over the New Jersey Turnpike.  One of the film's true joys is the
excitement people have about the sheer banality of the famous actor's
life, whether its eating toast or ordering linens.  By the end of the
picture, Craig is able to control Malkovich like a giant puppet, in the
only predictable facet of the inventive story from debut scribe Charlie
Kaufman, who also served as an executive producer.
Aside from the highly original script, kudos must be given to multi-MTV
Video Award winner Spike Jonze, who has made a rather auspicious feature
film debut, and cinematographer Lance Acord, who filmed the equally
creative Buffalo '66.  The acting is fantastic, especially Cusack and a
nearly unrecognizable Diaz, and Malkovich (The Man in the Iron Mask)
appears to have a grand time making fun of himself.  Look for cameos
from Sean Penn, Brad Pitt and a very funny Charlie Sheen.
If you're looking for something daringly original, do not miss this
film.  If you liked Runaway Bride, you should probably stay away.
Really far away.

Review for Sweet November (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If forced to name a celebrity I'm completely tired of seeing and hearing
about, the names Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron would be blurted out just
after Jennifer Lopez and right before Kate Hudson.  Not only do Keanu and
Charlize have ridiculous names, they've also appeared in three films apiece
in the last six months, most of which were formulaic crap (him: The
Replacements, The Watcher and The Gift; her: The Yards, Men of Honor and The
Legend of Bagger Vance).  Hey, why not put them in a film together?  It's
almost as if Hollywood senses I'm on the brink of a workplace shooting and
is trying to nudge me off the fence.
Sweet November is a remake of moderately entertaining 1968 film that starred
Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley (think of a young Charles Grodin, only with
charisma and hair).  Both films are about a dying woman who takes on one
dysfunctional man each month of her last year on Earth in some bizarre
attempt to...to...okay, I have no idea why she does it.  The 2001 version,
lifelessly directed by Pat O'Connor (Dancing at Lughnasa), swaps the woman's
cool Greenwich Village loft for a cramped San Francisco walkup and totally
blows the ending, turning the subtle, well-done original into something
extraordinarily unpleasant and plodding.
Theron plays Sara Deever, a less-annoying version of Jenna Elfman's Dharma.
Sara is Hollywood eccentric, which means she has close-cropped hair, clothes
that don't match and wears a lot of weird hats and scarves.  Her "November"
is Nelson Moss (Reeves), an advertising executive portrayed as a
high-powered, workaholic version of Darrin Stephens.  Nelson's life is ruled
by his work and everything else, including his lovely but perpetually
ignored girlfriend (Gilmore Girls' Lauren Graham), is pushed aside.  It's
hard to tell if the character is a dick or if the actor is a moron (it's
probably a little of both).
The two "meet cute" at the DMV, where Sara offers to make Nelson her
"November."  Confused (a stretch for Reeves, I'm sure), Nelson writes her
off as a kook, but takes her up on the offer after getting fired and dumped
on the same day.  He's still wary of Sara's motives - heck, I'd be expecting
her to turn into Kathy Bates in Misery, or find out Satan is somehow
involved (Reeves and Theron were in The Devil's Advocate together) - but
eventually they fall in love, otherwise there wouldn't be a movie.
When Nelson pesters Sara about her strange monthly arrangements, she
replies, "I told you - I can't tell you my reasons."  He has no clue
(another stretch for Reeves), so, apparently, he hasn't seen November's
trailer, where Sara's raccoon-like, sunken cancer eyes are prominently
displayed, ruining the ending for anyone who couldn't see it coming a mile
away.  Sure enough, about an hour into the film, she starts acting
mysterious, sweaty and tired, and you can only sit back and wait for the
inevitable, which drags out with the exciting pace of a nursing home Bingo
game.
The ending is so bad, somebody at my screening actually shouted, "Hurry up
and die already!"  Okay, it was me, but you get the point.  There's plenty
of other stuff to get pissed off about, like the fact that it's a Warner
Bros. film that shamelessly plugs several of its products (America Online,
CNN and Sports Illustrated, among others).  Look for the scene where Nelson
and his buddy (Greg Germann, Down to Earth) talk to each other on their cell
phones, even though they're walking right next to each other (just like
Clueless).  If that wasn't bad enough, there's also a karaoke scene where
Keanu shows he's a better singer than an actor.  But that's kind of like
saying George W. Bush is a lot smarter than people give him credit for.

Review for 15 Minutes (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
15 Minutes is, I think, a well-meaning film with lofty intentions, but it
comes off more than a bit contrived and about as subtle as Jesse Ventura.
What is supposed to be a damning indictment of criminal celebrity and the
forces that aid said criminals (i.e. the media, entertainment industry,
justice system and law enforcement) instead comes off as a weaker version of
Natural Born Killers.
15 Minutes focuses on the actions of two Eastern European criminals - crafty
Emil (Karel Roden) and beefy Oleg (Oleg Taktarov) - who, as the film opens,
arrive in New York City to meet up with a partner they believe is holding
onto their share of a bank robbery that the three men committed back in the
old country.  Problem #1: The partner has spent every dime from the heist.
Problem #2: Emil, the group's ringleader, is a stone-cold nutter.  He kills
his (former) partner and torches the building, but a witness (Vera Farmiga)
watches everything go down.
Because the crime is a homicide and involved arson, the city's police and
fire departments butt heads over the investigation.  In the blue corner is
Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro, Meet the Parents), a media-savvy homicide
dick who has become a national celebrity because of his involvement in a
recent high-profile case.  In the red corner is Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns,
Saving Private Ryan), an arson investigator for the NYFD.  As long as he
gets the job done, Jordy couldn't care less what the public thinks of him.
The film's hook is that the It's-a-Wonderful-Life-loving Oleg, who stole a
digital camera from a Times Square electronics shop, is filming everything
that he and Emil do.  At first, he does it for kicks, but as the two men
become accustomed to the ways of the Western world (via daytime television),
they realize that robbing banks is a waste of time and energy.  The real
money, it seems, isn't in committing crime, but in selling your story after
you're caught.  Once apprehended, all one needs to do is whine about an
abusive childhood and you're virtually off the hook.  And what better way to
sell your story than with video evidence of your crime spree?
Other than the presence of Oleg's video camera (which is lifted from the
superior French film Man Bites Dog) and the heavy-handed message, 15 Minutes
is full of every cop-flick cliché you can think of.  You've got your old
cop/young cop thing happening, as well as the good guy/bad guy race to get
their hands on the lone witness (and the obligatory romance that follows).
And, of course, you've got the hot-headed police captain who screams until
he's blue in the face.  The last 30 minutes offer a couple of surprises, but
it takes way too long (ironically, about 15 minutes too long) to get to the
inevitable conclusion.
DeNiro does decent work here, but it's nothing too special for someone of
his stature.  He seems better in comedies lately, and does get one funny
scene that's a takeoff on his famous monologue from Taxi Driver.  Burns is
merely adequate, showing that it takes more than just puppy-dog eyes to
excel as an actor.  Kelsey Grammer (Frasier) logs in a nice - albeit brief -
performance as the anchor of a popular tabloid television show, but his
character disappears for 90 minutes.  Providence's Melina Kanakaredes plays
a news reporter and Eddie's girlfriend, but her part seems to be included
only to add a human touch to DeNiro's character (or, possibly, to waste
time).  The real star here is Roden, who easily creates one of the scariest
and most believable screen antagonists in recent memory with this breakout
role. And just in case you weren't tired of seeing Charlize Theron in, like,
every movie, she appears in one scene as the manager of an escort service.
15 Minutes was written and directed by John Herzfeld (2 Days in the Valley).
He does a decent job with the picture's pacing and, thanks to
cinematographer Jean-Yves Escoffier (Cradle Will Rock), is able to get the
most out of using two different sources of film (the normal film stock and
Oleg's digital footage).  A film made only of Oleg's footage (like Man Bites
Dog) would have made for a more interesting and thought-provoking film.  15
Minutes also seemed to let the various evils (the media, et al.) off the
hook way too easily, which kind of undermines the whole point of the
picture.
The scene I found the most interesting was the one that got the largest
response from the audience.  After being wounded in a shootout, Emil pops
open a bottle of Excedrin, pours half the contents into his mouth and
crunches on the chalky pills at top volume while the moviegoers groaned and
grimaced.  This same audience didn't make a peep for the two charred bodies
or the hooker who was cut up like Swiss cheese, but, God forbid they're
forced to watch a guy chewing aspirin. It's a great, and probably completely
unintentional, example of America's desensitization to violence.

Review for Snow Day (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Realizing that the last time he was humorous was when he made a movie
set in the snow, former funnyman Chevy Chase (National Lampoon's
Christmas Vacation) returns to winter pics with Snow Day, the latest
film produced under television's Nickelodeon moniker.  Hilarity does not
ensue  details at 11:00.
Luckily, Chase is only involved in one of the four prongs of Day's
script.  He plays Tom Brandston, a wacky TV weatherman tired of playing
second fiddle to Syracuse, New York's meteorological deity, Chad Symmons
(John Schneider, The Dukes of Hazzard).  Tom is serious about his craft,
while smarmy Chad never even went to meteorologist school.  Like a
college education is a requirement for predicting the weather these
days.
Tom's wife Laura (Jean Smart, Guinevere) is a workaholic with a cell
phone permanently attached to her head.  The Brandstons have three kids,
and each fits the basic parameters for the typical Hollywood family.
There's fifteen-year-old Hal (Mark Webber, Drive Me Crazy), the dorky
teen on the brink of adulthood.  Then there's ten-year-old Natalie (Zena
Grey, The Bone Collector), the sassy middle kid that acts more adult
than the actual adults.  And then there's Randy (Connor Matheus), the
youngest Brandston, who is able to steal all of his scenes despite
barely being able to sputter out his lines.
When a record snowfall hits upstate New York, each character is affected
in ways that will forever change the way they approach life.  Okay, it's
not that mind-blowing at all.  Tom sees the storm as his big chance to
show everyone that he's the best darn weatherman in the godforsaken
city.  Laura realizes the importance of her family after she is trapped
at home all day with Randy the bastard.  Hal uses the day off to try to
woo school sexpot Claire (Emmanuelle Chriqui, Detroit Rock City) away
from bad-boy jock Chuck Wheeler (David Paetkau, Disturbing Behavior).
And charming Natalie tries to settle the score with a demonic snowplow
driver called Snowplowman (Chris Elliott, There's Something About Mary).
The kids will love the flatulence jokes and, Dads, keep an eye peeled
for Claire's see-through t-shirt  it's the most nipple I've seen in a
PG film.  The more hip adults in the audience may enjoy Iggy Pop (The
Crow: City of Angels), who plays the proprietor of the town's ice
skating rink, where he punishes customers with lethargic Al Martino
songs.  Did he call his agent after seeing Henry Rollins in Jack Frost
and say `Get me in a kids' movie with snow'?
But most of the good parts have to do with Snowplowman.  He's got teeth
like an Englishman, a bird named Trudy, a plow called `Darling
Clementine' and tire chains made from the braces of kids that he's run
over.  Like Natalie says, `It's a snow day  anything can happen.'  Such
as the fact that Hal narrates the film despite only being in twenty-five
percent of it.
Snow Day was made by the creative team that brought Kablam! to the small
screen.  Director Chris Koch and writers Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi
are all alumnus of the popular sketch comedy show and Day is the feature
film debut for all three filmmakers.  While it's not a particularly bad
film, it's better than the recent offerings from the sketch comedy
dinosaur Saturday Night Live.  Which brings us back to Mr. Chase, who,
once again, shows that he's as funny as a can of wadded beef.

Title
Review for Little Vampire, The (2000)
I admire Cameron Crowe as a writer and director but am feeling a strong
urge to kick him in the balls for unleashing Jonathan Lipnicki on the
world. The precocious little runt from Crowe's Jerry Maguire is on his
fourth go at the typical 15 minutes of fame.  After Maguire, Lipnicki
had a short-lived sitcom (Meego) and almost completely turned me off to
Dawson's Creek when he made several guest appearances last season.
There's something a little disturbing about seeing Creek's hot babes in
one scene, and then Lipnicki in the next.  It's enough to give you
limpdicky.
The diminutive actor's latest attempt at taking over the world via cute
expressions is The Little Vampire, a truly awful film that will frighten
little children and drive parents mad with boredom.  In it, Lipnicki
(Stuart Little) plays Tony Thompson, a nine-year-old boy who has just
moved from San Diego to an isolated town in Scotland.  Tony's had the
same dream every night he's spent in Scotland  something involving a
comet, the moon, a magic amulet and vampires, the latter of which causes
him to wake his parents in the middle of the night and earn the scorn of
his teacher and classmates, who call Tony names that are ordinarily
reserved for Jose Canseco (`stupid Yankee').
Long story short, Tony befriends a young vampire boy (they save each
other's lives) and learns that vampires are simply misunderstood and
want only to become human again.  Tony's dream about the comet and
amulet explains how the vampires are to go about becoming mortal.
Inexplicably, Tony goes from pissing his drawers at the mere mention of
the word `vampire' to wanting to become one in the span of about five
minutes.
Tony and the vampires have 48 hours to find the magic amulet (they've
been searching for it since the 1600s), which is also being hunted for
by a vampire killer (Jim Carter, Shakespeare in Love).  Until they can
find it, the kindly vampires don't feed on humans, but do suck blood
from cows, which proceed to obtain glowing red eyes, float through the
air and defecate on things.
There are several remarkable things about the film, such as how much it
isn't for kids.  The other child actors run circles around Lipnicki, who
is no longer cute and has the talent of thumbtack.  There's a confusing
subplot where Tony's dad tries to get him to be the next Tiger Woods.
And the vampires don't seem to obey the traditional rules of the undead,
like not being able to enter people's homes without being invited.
Vampire was directed by Ulrich Edel, who hasn't directed a feature film
since Madonna's 1993 debacle Body of Evidence.  It's based on a series
of children's books written by Angela Sommer-Bodenburg, which were
lethargically adapted by Karey Kirkpatrick (Chicken Run) and Larry
Wilson (Beetlejuice).
1:35  PG for blood sucking and frightening stuff like that

Title
Review for Pandaemonium (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Nobody would blame you for thinking a film about two real-life poets would
be a real snoozapalooza, but Pandaemonium is actually quite entertaining,
thanks to fine direction from The Filth and the Fury's Julien Temple  Set in
the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Pandaemonium tells the story of the
strange relationship between William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
the latter of whom made a name for himself by creating some beautiful,
opium-induced poems.
The film opens in London, where Wordsworth (John Hannah, The Mummy Returns)
is hosting a gathering of the top poetic minds.  Even though Wordsworth is
considered to be dull and boring by contemporaries like Lord Byron and
Robert Southey, he is the top candidate to become the country's Poet
Laureate.  Suddenly, Coleridge (Linus Roache, Wings of the Dove) appears,
bent out of his mind and barely able to speak as he attempts to pay tribute
to his longtime friend.  A glass of wine is knocked over in slow-motion, and
Pandaemonium flashes back to the genesis of their friendship.
Years ago, in pre-revolution France, Coleridge and his wife Sara (Samantha
Morton, Jesus' Son) attempted to create a rural Utopia in which everyone
called each other "Citizen" (including their first child, who was known as
Citizen Baby).  The Coleridge clan was joined by Wordsworth, his sister
Dorothy (Emily Woof, Velvet Goldmine) and wife Mary (Emma Fielding).
Coleridge and Wordsworth seemed to inspire themselves, even though most of
their work seemed to revolve around tedious subjects like domestic life.
They dreamt of writing experimental poetry in an attempt to abandon the
stuffy prose of the time.  Then Coleridge started taking opium for a
toothache, as many of us do, which led to the haunting style by which he
made his name.  Some of the poems, like "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"
disturb Coleridge to the point of insanity, which is how "Kubla Kahn" was
born.  In the meantime, as Coleridge's drug-addled success grows, Wordsworth
becomes increasingly jealous, and his writer's block leads him to come up
with memorable lines like "I wandered lonely as a cow."
Pandaemonium is livened up by Temple's style, which is highlighted by odd
scene transitions that include modern conveniences like airplanes and cell
phones.  Writer Frank Cottrell Boyce, who penned the story of two creative
women in Hilary and Jackie, does a good job at establishing the relationship
between the two poets, especially in making Coleridge as addicted to
Wordsworth as he was opium.  The acting leads do well, especially Roache,
who should be getting a lot more feature-film work that he currently does.
And make sure you stick around for the closing credits, which dissolve into
a music video for the song "Xanadu."  Or perhaps you should flee the
theatre.

Review for Amants criminels, Les (1999)
Thanks to a growing catalog of disturbing short films, François Ozon has
been dubbed `the bad boy of French cinema' and his latest, Criminal
Lovers, will do nothing but bolster his claim to that crown.  The film
is a sick, twisted and, at times, terrifying blend of Natural Born
Killers and Badlands, with a little Deliverance and Hansel & Gretel
thrown in for good measure.
Lovers opens with a sexually aggressive student named Alice (Natacha
Régnier, The Dreamlife of Angels) playing a nasty prank on her impotent
boyfriend Luc (Jérémie Rénier).  But this trick isn't the only one
playful Alice has up her sleeve.  She also convinces Luc to help her
slaughter an Arab classmate named Saďd.  The scene is graphic and the
two killers seem strangely indifferent as they try to clean up the
bloody murder scene.  The teens hit the road, with Saďd's body in their
trunk, stopping only to rob a jeweler and exercise the five-finger
discount at a supermarket.
The murder occurs about ten minutes into the film, before we really
learn anything about either Alice or Luc.  You may begin to scratch your
head and wonder who these kids are and what exactly led to this crime
spree.  Don't worry - Lovers is told via flashbacks in this uniquely
structured film.  What you might want to worry about is the frightening
incident the teens experience upon stumbling on an isolated shack in the
woods when they bury their classmate's body.
Ozon's cold direction (he also wrote the script) might leave some people
shaking their heads and accusing him of attempting only to shock, but
you can't deny that Ozon is a brilliant, stylish filmmaker.  Lovers is
only his second feature film, and the world should both anticipate and
dread his next project.
1:30  Not Rated but contains adult language, nudity, strong sexual
content,
rape, graphic violence, canibalism and a scene featuring a rabbit
skinning

Review for Dungeons & Dragons (2000)
Trolls  elves  gnomes  hey, that's not even what Dungeons and Dragons
is about.  It was more of a description of the film's target
demographic. Now calm down, Poindexter.  A movie isn't worth
hyperventilating over. Put down your inhaler and listen for a second.
Dragons is easily one of the year's worst films, and there's a very good
chance it could run away with multiple Razzie Award nominations for its
excessive crapulence.  The film not only rips off major elements and
themes from a bunch of other movies, but it fails to execute them in a
successful manner, as well.
Dragons is set in chaotic Izmer, a land ruled by Empress Savina (Thora
Birch, American Beauty).  Savina wants to restore power to the common
people of Izmer, but she meets great resistance in the form of the
diabolical Mage Profion (Jeremy `What the Hell Happened to My Career'
Irons).  Together with his bald, blue-lipped henchman, Profion has just
come into control of some magic stick that can control the powerful Red
Dragons of Izmer.  For some reason, he needs to get his hands on
Savina's magic stick to complete his evil doings.
Considering that the battle over the magic sticks is the main plot of
the film, it's quite odd that both Savian and Profion disappear for the
80 minutes in the middle of the movie.  That large chunk of time is
filled with the story of two thieves  Ridley (Justin Whalin, Jimmy
Olsen from the Lois & Clark series) and Snails (Marlon Wayans, Requiem
For a Dream)  and their adventures with a cute apprentice Mage named
Marina (newcomer Zoe McLellan).  The even get to hang out in a cantina
full of strange creatures (a la Star Wars) and go through a deadly maze
full of traps (a la Raiders of the Lost Ark).
Here's a question for you, Poindexter:  Who in their right mind would
make a film based on a game that, as far as I can tell, hit its
popularity about 15 years ago?  I'll tell you who  producer Thomas M.
Hammel, who also greenlit dead-in-the-water projects like Howie Long's
Firestorm and Cindy Crawford's Fair Game.  Dragons' director has no
feature-film experience, which is pretty obvious from his inability to
pull anything but wooden performances from any of his actors.
Irons (Lolita) seems way too enthusiastic to be in this film, and Birch
performs like she's been run over with a Rohypnol truck.  This isn't
what you'd expect from, respectively, an Oscar winner and somebody who
is hot off a role in last year's Best Picture champ.  The pick of the
litter is the newcomer McLellan, who kind of resembles a dark-haired
Claire Danes (right down to her inability to pick a good script).
Wayans is awful, and his character is only slightly less annoying than
Jar-Jar Binks.
Wayans has accomplished the Triple Crown of film this year.  He's been
in one of the year's most profitable films (Scary Movie) and one of the
year's best-reviewed films (Requiem).  Now he's in one of the year's
worst, too.
1:49  PG-13 for fantasy action violence

Title
Review for Joe Gould's Secret (1999)
Character-actor-turned-director Stanley Tucci's latest is based on a
true story from the 1940s about New York City residents Joseph Mitchell
and Joe Gould.  These two were far from your average Joes  Mitchell was
a popular columnist for the New Yorker, while Gould was a legendary bum
who prowled around Greenwich Village.  Tucci's fantastic film is based
on two articles that Mitchell wrote for his magazine.  The first,
`Professor Seagull,' was published in 1942, and the second, `Joe Gould's
Secret,' came out twenty-two years later, long after Gould had died and
Mitchell had discovered his `secret.'
Tucci (The Impostors) plays Mitchell, an elegant writer that can barely
sputter out a complete thought during face-to-face interaction with
other humans.  He's happily married to a photographer (a dark-haired
Hope Davis, Mumford) and has two precocious daughters.  One day, while
eating lunch at a coffee shop, Mitchell crosses paths with the homeless
Gould (Ian Holm, eXistenZ), a crazy, disheveled, mumbling, foul-mouthed,
arm-flapping, name-dropping Harvard graduate/exhibitionist that claims
he's a direct descendant of William the Conqueror and is able to
communicate with seagulls. Gould, like Hannibal Lecter, can pinpoint
Mitchell's birthplace from hearing one simple phrase.
Gould is also working on a book called `The Oral History of the World'
(or sometimes, just the `O.H.'), a tale about the overheard
conversations of anonymous, everyday people that will someday show the
world what went wrong with society. Gould has been working on the book
for years that, to date, dwarfs the Holy Bible in terms of sheer
volume.  Needless to say, Mitchell is intrigued by Gould and begins to
spend time with him so he can write an article championing his cause.
When he asks Gould for samples of his work, he is told that the bulk of
Gould's masterpiece is currently being stored in the basement of a house
on a Long Island duck and chicken farm.
When the New Yorker piece runs, Gould becomes a cult hero, receiving
contributions to his `fund,' and also gaining a mysterious benefactor.
He is finally granted membership to a snooty Greenwich poetry society
that he used to be kicked out of on a regular basis.  But he also
continues to bother the patient Mitchell, who Gould begins to refer to
as his biographer.  Mitchell just wants to move onto his next subject,
but Gould won't let him.
Gould's character brings to mind Henry Fool from Hal Hartley's 1998 film
of the same name.  A dreamer like Gould, Fool also wrote his life's work
in dime-store composition books and believed that the finished product
would shake up the world.  Holm's performance is beyond words.  He
doesn't look a lick like himself (his Gould more resembles Bob Hoskins
in Cousin Bette) and he perfectly ends every one of Gould's rambling
sentences by incoherently trailing off, like Mike Myers doing an
impression of Rolling Stone Ron Wood.
Tucci's direction here is much better than The Impostors, which was
obviously a bit of a lighter film.  As a result, Gould is much more
focused and perfectly captures the look and feel of World War II New
York City.  Gould was photographed by Maryse Alberti (Velvet Goldmine,
Happiness) and scored by Evan Lurie (Trees Lounge).  The film co-stars
Steve Martin (Bowfinger), Susan Sarandon (Cradle Will Rock) and Patricia
Clarkson (The Green Mile).
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the story is the fact that
Mitchell continued to go to his New Yorker office every day after
publishing `Joe Gould's Secret' in 1964.  He wrote for years and years,
but was never printed again, claiming he was working on some big piece
that remained shrouded in mystery. Nobody ever found out what it was,
and Mitchell died in 1996.

Review for Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000)
Most people don't realize that Eddie Murphy won the Best Actor award
from the National Society of Film Critics for his performance in The
Nutty Professor in 1996.  And it's not like there was a shortage that
year, either.  The NSFC passed up the likes of Billy Bob Thornton (for
Slingblade), Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient), Tom Cruise (Jerry
Maguire) and eventual Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush (Shine).
Was the NSFC off their cumulative rocker in '96?  Maybe.  But the group
has an uncanny knack for acknowledging deserving Academy Award nominees
(like Russell Crowe and Nick Nolte), as well as talent that Oscar just
plain overlooks (like Reese Witherspoon, Ally Sheedy and Bill Murray).
Their list of recent Best Picture winners reads like a who's who of
cinematic coolness (Being John Malkovich, Out of Sight, L.A.
Confidential, Breaking the Waves).
Even though his performance in The Klumps is even stronger than it was
in Professor, Murphy shouldn't clear off his mantle just yet.  After
all, The Klumps is a sequel to a remake of a Jerry Lewis film.  We're
not talking about your typical Oscar pedigree here, folks.
The Klumps takes the funniest and most memorable part of the first film
 the titular professor's four gassy relatives that are each played by
Murphy  and builds the movie around them.  Ordinarily, this would be a
recipe for disaster, but Murphy makes each of his characters so unique
and so witty, you almost forget that it's him underneath all of the
makeup and latex.
Murphy's performance aside, The Klumps isn't really that good of a
film.  Once again, Professor Sherman Klump (Murphy) is on the run from
his genetic alter ego Buddy Love (Murphy).  The film also features
storylines involving Sherman's horny grandmother (Murphy) and his
romantically challenged parents (Murphy and Murphy).  While the presence
of the additional Klumps shows off Murphy's wonderful skills as a
character actor, the script does nothing but serve as a launching pad
for a plethora of potty humor.
The Klumps opens with a dream sequence where Sherman is marrying a
fellow biology professor named Denise Gaines (Janet Jackson, Poetic
Justice).  After admiring his bride's ample cleavage, Sherman pops a
boner that turns into Buddy Love.  The next scene, where Sherman's
father has a retirement party at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, is more
lowbrow humor.  The meal is punctuated by burps, farts and talk of dick
size, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.  Before the credits start
to roll, you'll be treated to puke, flatulence, erectile dysfunction,
saggy boobs, bestiality and projectile turds, as well as nods to films
like Star Wars, Cape Fear and Armageddon.
The crux of the lame story, which was co-written by Barry W. Blaustein
and David Sheffield (Nutty) and Paul and Chris Weitz (American Pie),
focuses on Sherman's latest invention  a fountain of youth formula that
can actually make a person younger.  None of it makes sense, and the
inconsistent script has plot holes big enough for a Klump to fall
through.
On the plus side, Jackson is an improvement over Nutty's annoying Jada
Pinkett, although Pinkett probably wouldn't have insisted that her new
song be played throughout the film.  Larry Miller and John Ales reprise
their roles as Sherman's money-hungry dean and lab assistant,
respectively.  Directed by Peter Segal (My Fellow Americans), The Klumps
features some pretty funny outtakes during the closing credits, so don't
leave the theatre early.

Review for Wing Commander (1999)
The next time you go to a store that rents or sells video games, take a
look at some of the titles.  A lot of them are based on popular film
titles (Mission: Impossible and GoldenEye) or television shows (South
Park and Beavis & Butt-Head), but when was the last time you said, `Hey,
they oughta make this game into a movie'?  And when was the last time
that a film based on a video game was watchable, let alone good?
Remember Double Dragon and Super Mario Brothers?  How about Mortal
Kombat and its legendary sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation?  Granted,
the makers of these movies probably didn't dust off the ol' mantle in
anticipation of winning multiple Academy Awards.  Aside from MK's
soundtrack, they're all pretty much a waste of money, time and film.
Wing Commander (1/2 *) follows in the great tradition of game-to-screen
failures and is actually not better than a sharp stick in the eye.
That's right  I would actually prefer to lose the power of sight in one
of my eyes than see a film this wretched.  Its story is deplorable and
acting third-rate, but it has the common courtesy to keep its running
time under 100 minutes.  100 mind-numbing minutes.  100 minutes that I
would like to have back.
Commander is set in the year 2654 during an intense war between Earth
people and these cat-like people called Kilrathi.  As the film opens,
the Kilrathi have just destroyed a big Earth spaceship and have sent a
huge fleet to wipe out our planet.  And they can arrive in our solar
system very quickly because they have stolen something called Pegasus
Navicom A.I. that tells them which black holes to fly into in order to
save time.
Luckily, us Earthlings have two hothead fighter pilots on our side.
Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard (both of She's All That fame)
deliver a secret message that's been entrusted to them by the Admiral,
then join a rag-tag squadron of other fighter pilots.  Then they fly
around and blow stuff up and save the world  nay, the universe.  And
that's pretty much it.  There is very little air combat, practically no
decent special effects, and you barely get a glimpse of the kooky
Kilrathi soldiers.  So, that leaves you with Prinze, who is a horrible
actor, and Lillard, who is downright ugly.  That's an equation that
doesn't equal big fun regardless of what galaxy you're from.
Writer/Director Chris Roberts, who has no feature film experience but
created these characters for the second and third installments of the
popular PC game, should not only be strung up by his thumbs but should
also be beaten about the head and shoulders with a blunt object until
his face resembles red pudding.
Like my old Aunt Pearl used to say, `If you don't stand for something,
you'll go for anything.'  Of course, that doesn't have anything to do
with Wing Commander, but every once in a while she would poop her pants
and smell up the house.  I would rather clean up her rancid feces than
see this film again.  Consider yourself warned.

Review for Under Hellgate Bridge (1999)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
We all know bad stuff happens under bridges.  It is, after all, where
Anthony Kiedis drew some blood because he felt like he didn't have a
partner.  Hellgate Bridge in Astoria, Queens, which marks the place where
Long Island Sound becomes the Atlantic Ocean, isn't much different, as
evidenced by the opening scene of the film that shares its name.  We don't
know who Jimmy is when Under Hellgate Bridge reveals he's died of a heroin
overdose, but his passing sets off a tragic chain of events that, 90 minutes
later, seems to be cut from the same cloth as almost every low-budget
mobster film (save Reservoir Dogs) made either in an attempt to ride the
coattails of The Sopranos to success or as a creative outlets for artistic
gangster-wannabes.
Jimmy, it turns out, is the younger brother of Bridge's protagonist, Ryan
(Another World's Michael Rodrick), who has just been released from prison in
time to show up for the funeral.  He's been in the clink for two years, sent
up for a crime he never committed.  We learn the ex-junkie Ryan was set up
by an aspiring gangster named Vincent (Jonathan LaPaglia), who, in addition
to being "brought along" by the neighborhood heavy (Frank Vincent), has also
married Ryan's old girlfriend Carla (Jordan Bayne), fathered her child, and,
at least indirectly, killed Jimmy.  Vincent also has his fingers into Ryan's
other brother - another junkie named Eddie (Brian Vincent).
What follows is a predictable battle between Ryan and Vincent, culminating
in a very stylish shootout, which is, by far, Bridge's highlight.  The film,
full of heavy-handed music and a strong religious push, is also exceedingly
dark and contains a surprising lack of humor for something that aspires to
be Goodfellas.  The no-name acting, which includes two players from The
Sopranos (Vincent "Big Pussy" Pastore and Dominic "Uncle Jew" Chianese,
Jr.), is pretty decent, while cinematographer Leland Krane makes Bridge look
like a film with more than a $1 million budget.
The problem is with writer/director Michael Sergio's been-there/done-that
script.  Other than the finale, most of the story is as predictable as they
come (and the climax was only surprising because it was so much better than
the rest of the somber picture).  Could I have done better with a tiny
budget? Probably not, but don't be snowed into thinking it's the second
coming of Mean Streets.
If Sergio has done one thing well, it's his sales pitch for Bridge.  I
screened the film as part of the Sarasota Film Festival and stuck around for
a Q&A session with Sergio and a few members of his cast when the film was
over (mostly because I was in the back row and hate trying to sneak out in
front of the people who poured their time and money into a film I didn't
particularly care for).  When the Q&A thing was finished, Sergio and the
Bridge's other talent strategically placed themselves at the theatre's
exits, so that nobody would be able to get out of the place without being
personally thanked and/or touched in some friendly way by somebody
associated with the film (believe me - I tried).  Something seems really
wrong with that sort of thing.

Title
Review for Felicia's Journey (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Double Oscar nominee Atom Egoyan's (The Sweet Hereafter) latest film
begins with a great long shot that travels through the sumptuously
appointed first floor of a mansion before it finally comes to rest on a
man preparing an intricate dish along with a French cooking show on TV.
The portly man is Joseph Hilditch (Bob Hoskins, Cousin Bette), the
overseer of a large industrial kitchen in England, and the giant home
was owned by his deceased mother Gala, who also happens to be the French
chef on the television.
We learn that the friendly Hilditch (think Ed Asner with a weave) is a
stickler for the fine art of cuisine, chasing away the salesman of a
vending machine company because his product would result in the loss of
jobs.  Hilditch explains that food needs to be prepared by human hands.
Each evening, Hilditch cooks a gourmet meal in his mother's kitchen
while watching videotapes of her television show.  There is a huge
stockpile of brand-new kitchen appliances at his disposal, each bearing
a picture of Gala (Arsinée Khanjian, Irma Vep and Egoyan's real-life
wife).  We see flashbacks of a chunky young Hilditch playing second
fiddle to his mother's career.
Meanwhile, a young, pretty Irish girl named Felicia (newcomer Elaine
Cassidy) has just traveled from her native County Cork to Birmingham,
England.  She's alone, pregnant and has no identification.  Felicia's
excursion has one singular mission  to find the love of her life and
father of her child, Johnny (Peter McDonald, I Went Down).  The problem
is that Felicia only knows that Johnny may have a manufacturing job
somewhere in Birmingham.  We learn through several flashbacks that
Felicia's father (Gerard McSorley, The Boxer) has threatened to disown
her if she left home for Johnny, an Irish lad that jumped sides and
joined the British Army.  Think of the widow-peaked Felicia as a
physical cross between Olivia Williams, Molly Parker and Parker Posey.
The forlorn Felicia meets the congenial Hilditch, who offers to help the
lass find her dreamboat.  I won't reveal the payoff, but if you raised a
red flag at the thought of a man that watches videotape of his dead mom
while living in her house, you'll get the idea.  The result is a twisted
mixture of Remains of the Day and The Silence of the Lambs.  Hoskins is
completely believable as the helpful gentleman with a big secret, and
the love-blind Cassidy portrays sufficient innocence in her titular
role.  Is Hoskins' performance good enough to nab an Oscar nomination?
They thought so in Cannes, where the film was overly praised earlier
this year.  Expect a big push from Journey's distributor Artisan  the
studio is rolling in cash after The Blair Witch Project.
Egoyan, who adapted the screenplay from William Trevor's novel Fools of
Fortune, slowly builds up the suspense in the film without using
gimmicky tricks or graphically depicting violence.  And the effect is
downright creepy.  His use of 50s music  especially Malcolm Vaughn's
`You Are My Special Angel'  helps to add to the glowing, dream-like
quality of the film.  Credit cinematographer Paul Sarossy (Affliction)
for much of Journey's radiance, as well as Egoyan's transformation
between the lush, green scenes in Ireland to the sooty gray of
Birmingham's industrial factories.

Title
Review for Galaxy Quest (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Sometimes the lamest ideas translate into the funniest films, and Galaxy
Quest is a perfect example of this strange paradox.  Basically a Star
Trek spoof, Quest follows the exploits of five washed-up actors that
appeared years ago on a hokey but popular sci-fi television series,
aptly called `Galaxy Quest.'  Through a series of bizarre circumstances,
the group find themselves battling real aliens on a real spaceship, with
real lives (including their own) at stake.
Having burned through their fifteen minutes of fame during the run of
`Quest,' the unemployed actors have since been relegated to making
appearances at nerd-filled show conventions and opening electronic chain
stores.  Like Trek, each member of the cast despises their on-air
leader, and the show's most popular character, Commander Peter Quincy
Taggart, who is played by Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen, Home Improvement).
Among his hilariously predictable underlings are Dr. Lazarus of
Tev'Meck, portrayed by Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman, Dogma), a
Shakespearean-trained Brit that proclaims, `I was in `Richard III!' and
hates his character's silly catch-phrase, `By Grabthar's hammer, by the
suns of Warvan, you shall be avenged!'
Sigourney Weaver (Alien: Resurrection) plays Gwen DeMarco, who in turn
plays Lt. Tawny Madison, a blonde sex-kitten whose only apparent duties
are to repeat whatever the computer has just said and to have buoyant
breasts.  The hilarious Tony Shalhoub (Stark Raving Mad) tackles the
role of Fred Kwan (Tech Sergeant Chen) while 10 Things I Hate About You
scene-stealer Daryl Mitchell is Tommy Webber, playing a grown-up Lt.
Laredo (the character was just a `Webster'-sized kid in the TV show).
During one `Quest' convention, Nesmith is approached by a gaggle of
geeks with hopeless haircuts and alien attire that claim their planet
will be destroyed without his help.  Since these conventions are a
breeding ground for costumed kooks and tech-babbling buffoons, he thinks
nothing of it.  At the next convention, a hungover Nesmith mistakes the
same group for the bookers of his next convention appearance and takes
off with them.
But the geeks aren't really geeks  they're bona-fide aliens (including
Just Shoot Me's Enrico Colantoni) that have picked up satellite
transmissions of `Quest' and mistaken them for historical documents of
Earth's continual triumph over its interstellar adversaries.  They've
recreated the spaceship from `Quest,' incorporating every facet of the
show into its design, and legitimately need Nesmith's help to fend off a
barbaric alien race from wiping out their planet.  The chief baddie is,
I think, the bass player for Gwar.
Long story short, Nesmith persuades his fictional crew to join him as he
battles genuine evil in outer space.  Of course, they're clueless, since
they have no real knowledge of space travel or interplanetary war.  But
that's what makes the film funny.  Screenwriters Robert Gordon (Addicted
to Love) and David Howard don't let one space cliché go unused, and
director Dean Parisot shows some promise after last year's abysmal mess,
Home Fries.  Allen does a super Shatner, and the others do a great job
of acting jealous of his fame.  Since the cast shares jokes and
one-liners, the film seems to be more balanced than you would expect
from a silly space comedy.
1:49 - PG for some action violence, mild language and some adult
situations

Title
Review for Rat Race (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Take seven ordinary people, dangle $2 million in front of them and watch the
ensuing fun.  That's basic premise of Rat Race, a new film that seems a
whole lot like It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  Thankfully, it's a lot
funnier and about an hour shorter, too.
John Cleese (The World is Not Enough) plays Donald Sinclair, an eccentric
Las Vegas hotel owner with a mouthful of the biggest, whitest teeth you'll
see this side of Baba Booey (I swear they're the same choppers Matt Dillon
wore in There's Something About Mary).  In order to keep his hotel filled
with high rollers from various foreign countries, Sinclair must offer
betting on unique competitions.  His latest involves a 500-plus-mile race
from Vegas to Silver City, New Mexico, with contestants randomly chosen via
the distribution of special gold coins in his hotel's slot machines.
Here's a quick rundown of the participants:
- Nick Shaffer (Breckin Meyer, Josie and the Pussycats), a Chicago attorney
in town for a friend's bachelor party.  He thinks the contest is a goof but
then meets a charming helicopter pilot named Tracy (Amy Smart, Road Trip),
who provides the quickest way to get from Point A to Point B.
- Vera Baker (Whoopi Goldberg, Monkeybone) and the daughter she gave up for
adoption (Lanei Chapman).  The two meet for the first time just prior to the
competition and quickly bond over an incident with Kathy Bates and several
homeless squirrels.
- Duane (Seth Green, America's Sweethearts) and Blaine (Vince Vieluf, Clay
Pigeons) Cody, two wannabe grifters.  One of 'em has a self-pierced tongue
and is unintelligible (one scene has him swearing up a storm, but it's about
as clear as Brad Pitt's dialogue in Snatch).  Their adventure involves a
vertical drive, an udder fight and a crooked hardware store employee.  'Nuff
said.
- Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr., Pearl Harbor), an NFL referee who, one
week prior, blew a big call in a big game and is despised by everyone who
lost money because of him (it's Vegas, remember).  Owen somehow ends up
driving a tour bus full of nuts dressed as Lucy.
- Enrico Pollini (Rowan Atkinson, Bean), a narcoleptic Italian who teams up
with an organ deliveryman (Wayne Knight, Seinfeld) rushing a donated heart
to El Paso.  One can only assume that Roberto Benigni passed on this part.
- Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz, 3000 Miles to Graceland), a husband (to Kathy
Najimy, The Wedding Planner) and father of two who refuses to tell his
family why their Vegas vacation to see David Copperfield is taking a detour
through Silver City.  Hilarity ensues in the form of kids requesting
bathroom breaks (the best description of having to poop since Fat Bastard in
The Spy Who Shagged Me) and stops at tourist traps, like the Barbie Museum
(a damn funny scene).
The competitors use various modes of transportation, ranging from the
typical (planes, trains and automobiles) to the unique (helicopter, hot-air
balloon and rocket car).  With a script written by former Saturday Night
Liver Andy Breckman and direction from Jerry Zucker (Airplane, Police
Squad), no comedic stone is left unturned.  Of course, this may offend
anyone hung up on animal rights, speech impediments and the mentally
challenged (maybe it's got something to do with those damn Matt Dillon
teeth).
I hate Gooding, and downright despise Goldberg, but they were both as
likable as they've been in years.  Don't get me wrong - I ain't no racist.
Meyer, Knight and Smart aren't exactly high on my list of the Tinseltown
elite, but everybody here is thoroughly enjoyable.  Lovitz and Atkinson
steal the show, however.
Although it's this summer's funniest film, Race's ending flat-out sucks.  I
know I've already campaigned for a moratorium on the number of
Holocaust/WWII films, but isn't there something we can do to keep that
goddamn "All Star" song out of every film possible?  I'm picturing a wizened
Sick-Boy trying to explain the cinematic significance of Smash Mouth to his
grandchildren in 2053:
Little Suzie:  "Grampy, why is that song in every old movie?"
Decrepit Sick-Boy:  "It's Carson Daly's fault.  Spiders!  I'm covered in
spiders!"
Little Suzie:  "Mom, he's doing it again."
Seriously, that "All Star" bullshit nearly ruined this summer's other funny
film (Shrek), but Race ups the stakes by having the stupid band in the
movie...performing the song live.  And, brother, does Smash Mouth singer
Steve Harwell have a face made for radio.

Title
Review for My Giant (1998)
Apparently, while Billy Crystal spends all of his free time tying to
figure out how to work the names of all five `Best Picture' nominees
into an irritating song and dance number, he has his mongoloid nephew
read scripts and recommend projects for him.  Note to Billy  IT'S OVER!
In his latest big screen blunder, Crystal (Father's Day) stars as an
unsuccessful New York talent agent named Sammy.  He currently has but
one client, an annoying pre-pubescent douche bag that is currently
filming a `Crusades' picture in Romania.  After travelling around the
world to the location, Sammy in unceremoniously dumped by the little
brat.  Why he had to go there at all, I will never know.
Thankfully, Sammy gets into a car wreck, but he doesn't die.  In fact,
he is saved by a seven-and-a-half foot glandular case named Max (NBA
star Gheorge Muresan).  The giant lives with a bunch of monks because
the townsfolk call him mean names.  These monks are the kind that don't
talk.  Or maybe they're the kind of monks who just don't talk in front
of Billy Crystal because they were raised to not say anything if they
can't say anything nice.  I do think there was one in the background
giggling about Mr. Saturday Night.
Anyway, Max drags Sammy back to his lair (which oddly resembles
Crystal's home in The Princess Bride) and prattles on and on about his
long lost love who moved to Gallop, New Mexico.  He even has stacks and
stacks of letters that he has written to her.  Why they are still in his
possession, I will never know.
Not the type of guy to pass up the exploitation of a big stupid freak,
Sammy talks Max into becoming a movie star as well as an opportunity to
reunite with his beloved.  This Max is some actor.  His dopey grin and
cross-eyed blank stare make Andrew Shue look like an acting great.
Although he is a better screen presence than Shaq and Michael Jordan,
Muresan still makes my want to bash something apart with some type of
power tool.
Here's an idea  when you make a movie about a big tall guy, how about
showing him in places that normal people find cramped.  Max gets to go
on an airplane and in a cab, but we don't get to see either.  I would
have loved to have seen him crushing his Frankenstein head into the
overhead compartment or try to use the bathroom.  Somethinganything.
Instead, My Giant's script is loosely held together by one of the
greatest vomiting scenes in history.
Or here is an even better story  instead of helping Sammy, Max eats
him.  He still becomes a big movie star and even gets to present an
award at the Oscars.  Instead of reading the names of the nominees, Max
pulls down his pants and craps out Sammy, who burst into a song and
dance number.  Jesus, I've got to write a script.  All I need is the
address for Billy's nephew.

Title
Review for Family Man, The (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2000 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you like your movies lengthy, derivative and shockingly predictable,
then haul your ignorant ass down to the theatre to see The Family Man,
Hollywood's umpteenth version of a holiday film that shows a soulless
central character pulling a Christmas Eve about-face after getting a
glimpse of the way things were, could have been, or are going to be.
Man, like Charles Dickens' `A Christmas Carol' and Frank Capra's It's a
Wonderful Life before it, shows a guy being visited by a ghost/angel who
takes the character on a wild ride to show him the error of his ways.
Here, the George Bailey/Scrooge character is Jack Campbell (Nicolas
Cage, Gone in 60 Seconds), and our first glimpse of him reveals Jack to
be a man with a mission.  The scene takes place at an airport in 1987,
where Jack is about to depart for a big post-college internship at a top
London investment firm.  Despite the schmaltzy pleadings of his
lawyer-to-be girlfriend Kate (Téa Leoni, Deep Impact), Jack hops on his
plane without giving a second thought to what he's leaving behind,
opting instead to stake his claim in the business world.
Man then flashes forward 13 years, where the still-single Jack has a
penthouse apartment in Manhattan, a Ferrari, a giant closet full of
$2,400 suits and a powerful Wall Street job.  It's Christmas Eve, and
Jack's company is set to announce a giant corporate merger on December
26th.  This, of course, gives him the opportunity to crack the whip
while his employees whimper about not being able to spend the holidays
with their families (one is played by Dick's Saul Rubinek  like he's
suddenly celebrating Christmas).
A strange combination of eggnog, a Lotto ticket and five magic words
(`I've got everything I need') triggers the appearance of The Ghost of
Christmas What-Could-Have-Been, or, in this case, a gunwielding angel
played by Traffic's Don Cheadle (which makes Man yet another film where
Whitey is shown The Light by a black character).  Jack laughs off the
encounter until he wakes up on Christmas morning living the life that
would have been his if he had stayed in New York with Kate back in '87.
At this point, Man becomes the third film this year to showcase a
character living a life that isn't really theirs (following Passion of
Mind and the much more enjoyable Me Myself I).  Jack goes through all of
the predictable disbelief you would expect from a man who has gone from
a life of luxury to a suburban New Jersey hell with a wife, two kids, a
slobbery dog and, worst of all, a job selling tires (retail, no less)
for Kate's father.  Like Me Myself I, the only person who notices
something rotten in the state of Denmark is one of Jack's kids  a
precocious six-year-old who talks like she's two.
As you would expect, Jack immediately wants out, but eventually warms to
the married life (and who wouldn't with a wife like Leoni?).  The best
part of the film isn't even in the film  the use of Talking Heads' Once
in a Lifetime (`This is not my beautiful house/this is not my beautiful
wife') happens only in Man's trailer.  Every plot development in Man can
be seen coming a mile away, and most of the things that work are glossed
over and/or cut short.  It would have been great to see how Jack got
through a day of pretending to know the ins and outs of the tire
business instead of watching him change his first poopy diaper, but only
the latter made it into the film.
Man's script, which was written by David Diamond (of the Ice-T/Alyssa
Milano `thriller' Below Utopia fame) and David Weissman (Dream a Little
Dream 2  who knew they made a sequel?), is a hackneyed hack-job that
leaves many side stories unresolved.  What becomes of Jack's near affair
with the comely wife of a friend (played by Lisa Thornhill)?  And what's
the deal with Jack's fat buddy, who is supposed to be having a triple
bypass the day after Christmas but is shown bowling instead?  My bet is
that some things were chopped out of the final cut when test audiences
didn't react favorably to them.  Either that, or director Brett Ratner
(Rush Hour) is an incredibly bad storyteller.  Regardless of the reason,
it's still not good.
In the acting department, Leoni is the clear standout, stealing every
scene she shares with Cage.  She perfectly embodies her sassy, spunky,
satisfied character, and is completely believable in doing so.  It's
refreshing to see Cage attempt a role where he isn't either dark and
brooding, or a stupid action hero.  That said, he has one of the
creepiest smiles in the business.
Man wasn't more than 30 seconds old before the schmaltz made my eyes
roll back in my head.  It's reduced a Frank Capra film to, frankly,
crap.  I can't recall a film striving this fervently to be mediocre 
nothing more, nothing less.  Even the usually reliable Danny Elfman
(Sleepy Hollow) provides a surprisingly calculated score.  Technically,
the highlight is Dante Spinotti's (Wonder Boys) photography.
People wonder why critics give poor marks to films that infrequent
moviegoers might find heartwarming.  The answer is simple  we have to
sit through three or four of the exact same films every year.  Man is
one of those films.

Review for Bride of the Wind (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved. 
For those of you who couldn't get enough of Albert Brooks' 1999 film The 
Muse (and I know a lot of you couldn't, considering it didn't even recoup 
its $15 million budget) and thought, "Gee, it sure would be great if this 
were based on truth...and set in turn-of-the-century Vienna...and a drama 
instead of a comedy," then, people, I have got a film for you.  Bride of the 
Wind is a drama based on truth that is set during turn-of-the-century 
Vienna, and instead of its main character inspiring the likes of James 
Cameron, Martin Scorsese, Jeff Bridges and Meathead, she motivates real 
artists of that time. 
The muse is Alma Moll (Sarah Wynter, The 6th Day), the social-climbing 
daughter of a popular stage actress.  Bride opens, after some handsome 
opening credits that show old Austrian film clips, in 1902 Vienna, which is 
atwitter with the news that the great composer, Gustav Mahler (Jonathan 
Pryce, Stigmata), is taking up residence in their fair city.  Everyone 
rushes to kiss Mahler's ass, but Alma gets his attention by criticizing his 
music.  Mahler in intrigued, but tells Alma, "A symphony is like the world; 
it must contain everything."  I think Baz Luhrmann incorporated the same 
practice into Moulin Rogue. 
Mahler is easily seduced by Alma, and they eventually marry, but he forces 
her to give up her burgeoning music career to focus on things like balancing 
his books.  Alma squirts out a couple of kids, and after one of them dies 
she heads for the sanitarium, where she falls in love with Bauhaus architect 
Walter Gropius (Simon Verhoeven).  Alma still accompanies Mahler in his move 
to New York City, yet continues to yearn for Gropius. 
Then she falls for Impressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka (Vincent Perez, I 
Dreamed of Africa), whose first attempt at a physical relationship with Alma 
is greeted with a squeeze to the ol' twig-and-berries (she's some lady, this 
Alma). After Kokoschka, she moves onto left-wing author Franz Werfel (Gregor 
Seberg), who looks a lot like SNL's Darryl Hammond. Alma marries a few of 
these four men (it's honestly difficult to keep track of her latest hubby), 
and, although it's not shown in the film, continues to bed famous men. 
Alma's poor daughter, Anna, obviously confused by the carousel of men, just 
calls them all "Uncle." 
We're never really given a clear reason why she hops beds so frequently. 
Bride is, I think, supposed to show Alma as a pioneer feminist (and, indeed, 
the script was written by a woman, first-timer Marilyn Levy), but winds up 
portraying her as a flaky horn-dog who is easily bored with men. To make 
matters worse, Wynter isn't that great of an actress. Other than her cute 
pout (think Cate Blanchett crossed with Renée Zellweger, only without the 
talent), there isn't much going on, other than her willingness to 
participate in a lot of lingering sex scenes. 
Wynter isn't the only performer who disappoints. The usually reliable Pryce 
turns in a performance reminiscent of the great Frank Langella. It doesn't 
help that the story is poorly written and full of silly dialogue, or that it 
casually mentions major historical events as if they were an afterthought, 
like when somebody literally sticks their head into one scene to shout about 
the assassination of the Archduke. Given the short running time, I wouldn't 
be surprised to learn that the original cut from director Bruce Beresford 
(Double Jeopardy) was much longer and a bit more detailed but shoddily 
edited to a more reasonable length. And I'm not even sure you could consider 
Alma a muse. She's more like a starfucker than anything; an early ancestor 
of Bonny Bakely. 
And the title of the film, in case you were wondering, comes from one of 
Kokoschka's paintings.

Review for Brokedown Palace (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Less effective than last year's Return to Paradise, Brokedown Palace
dwells on several of the same themes as the almost-straight-to-video
Vince Vaughn/Joaquin Phoenix thriller  narcotics, making the ultimate
sacrifice for your best friend, and the injustice of Third World legal
systems.  New here are a thinner script, a weaker ending, and the
casting of two females in the lead roles.
The two women in question are Alice (Claire Danes, The Mod Squad) and
Darlene (Kate Beckinsale, The Last Days of Disco).  They are both recent
high school grads that work as hotel maids in safe, suburban Upland,
Ohio.  Alice and Darlene plan a summer vacation, but decide that Hawaii
is too `middle class' for them.  They settle on Thailand after a bottle
of beer from that country shatters during a party - talk about a sign
from above.
Since `Thailand' actually means `freedom' in English, both girls escape
to the Asian paradise, although Darlene still tells her parents that
they're headed for Hawaii.  Before long, the duo are squealing at their
six-dollar-a-night roach-infested hotel, whining about the unbearable
heat, and complaining that the city's river is contaminated with feces
and unsuitable for swimming.  Acting?  Probably not.  Remember the Thai
government forcing a real-life apology from Claire Danes after she
mewled that the country was full of giant cockroaches, babies with flies
buzzing around their heads, and people missing arms and legs?
Before long, the two brats sneak into the pool at a five-star hotel,
charging their drinks to a made-up room number.  As security closes in
on them, a hunky Aussie named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine, Dangerous
Beauty) saves the day by saying that Alice and Denise are with him.
Within twenty-four hours, both girls have fallen for him, are fighting
over him, and they decide to meet him in Bangkok for a couple of days
after his business weekend in Hong Kong.
Of course, Alice and Darlene don't know that Nick Parks is really Skip
Karns (his alias is an anagram), a drug smuggler that uses naďve
Americans as mules to transport his wares.  Somehow, two giant tins
containing 2 kilos of heroin are sneaked into Alice's backpack, and both
women are immediately dragged off to a dank and even more roach-infested
prison and soon found guilty of drug trafficking.  So how did the drugs
get into Alice's backpack and how could she not notice the extra
weight?  Never mind that.  The real question is why someone would use an
anagram for an alias.  And if you need to be that clever, why not use
Sink Prank?  Or K. Crap Skin?
Enter `Yankee Hank' Green (Bill Pullman, Lake Placid), an expatriate
American barrister that agrees to help the prisoners.  He tries to talk
to the American embassy and its ambassador (played by Lou Diamond
Phillips, The Big Hit), but seems only to be spinning his wheels.  Hey,
speaking of spinning wheels, Palace's script comes from two debut
screenwriters (David Arata and Adam Fields, the latter a producer on
Fox's other box office flop Ravenous) and is directed by the guy who
made Bad Girls (Jonathan Kaplan).  Credit cinematographer Newton Thomas
Sigel for the moody, atmospheric feel to the film.
Other things to keep an eye (or ear) out for are a horrible cover of The
Clash's `Rock the Casbah,' a cameo from ex-punk rocker John Doe as
Alice's dad, and one odd moment during the weepy finale where the pixie
Brit Beckinsale flubs her impeccable American accent.  Males 18-35 will
also relish the scene where Danes and Beckinsale `spoon' each other on a
bed.  The remaining demographics will have to look a bit harder for
something to enjoy.  (1:46 - PG-13 for brief strong language, drug
related material and some violent content)

Review for Mummy, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Remember that FOX special a few months back - the one where their crack
news crew got permission to bust into some ancient Egyptian tombs a la
Geraldo Rivera's ill-fated Al Capone vault fiasco from the 80s?  I had
a bad feeling that it was either (a) staged, as FOX doesn't have the
highest reputation for journalistic integrity, or (b) a very elaborate
commercial for the remake of the 1932 Boris Karloff classic, The Mummy.
Although I don't think it was either (a) or (b)  it was too boring to
be staged and the film comes from FOX rival Universal  the television
special was still rather fascinating and will, no doubt, inadvertently
help to fuel big box office numbers for the action-heavy/story-light
$80-million horror picture.
Written and directed by Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising), The Mummy opens
about 3000 years in the past, when some overly jealous Egyptian king
catches his bride with Imhotep, the High Priest of Osiris (Arnold
Vosloo, Zeus & Roxanne). Imhotep is buried alive with these nasty,
flesh-eating beetles and his tomb is guarded for centuries and centuries
because  get this  if he ever comes back to life, he will be a walking
plague on Earth.  Which may explain why he looks a lot like Billy Zane.
Maybe they should have put a poster for The Phantom on the tomb entrance
as well.
Flash forward to the early part of the 20th century, when French Legion
soldier Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser, Blast From the Past) stumbles
onto a map to Imhotep's evil crypt, but is eventually run off by its
guardians.  His interest is understandably piqued because of the legend
that Imhotep was buried along with his vast treasures.  Unfortunately
for O'Connell, most people believe that it is, in fact, just a legend.
O'Connell is able to hook up with a wacky brother/sister team that agree
to accompany him in his search for the lost sepulcher.  Evelyn Carnarvon
(Rachel Weisz, Chain Reaction) is a bumbling student of ancient Egypt
and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah, Sliding Doors) is just eager to
get his hands on some riches.  Just to liven things up a bit, there is
also a rival group of grave-robbers that simultaneously begin their trek
with our heroes.
Now, here's the problem  you don't see the Mummy until about two-thirds
of the way into the film.  When he's on the screen, it's really cool,
but then he turns back into the human Imhotep after about two minutes.
Here's another problem  Fraser is too simian to carry a film.  People
were surprised at how good he was in Gods & Monsters, but it was just
because he wasn't the star.  George of the Jungle?  His six-pack was the
real star of that film.  Blast From the Past was in and out of theaters
in two weeks because he kept his shirt on (he does here, too).
The Mummy tries very hard to be like The Raiders of the Lost Ark, but
it's much closer to last year's corny bore, The Mask of Zorro.  It is a
beautiful film, thanks to cinematographer Adrian Biddle (The Butcher
Boy), and also features some very funny supporting roles, including
Kevin J. O'Connor (Peggy Sue Got Married) and Dr. Bombay from
Bewitched.  Although its trailer gives the indication that the Mummy's
presence would be greater and that the film would offer non-stop special
effects, it can boast only a weak story, a crappy romance and a running
time that is forty minutes too long.  (2:11  PG-13 for violence and
brief nudity)

Title
Review for Amores perros (2000)
© Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Mexico hasn't exactly been a hotbed of successful independent film over the
last decade, but if every movie they produce in the next ten years is only
half as good as Amores Perros, Steven Soderbergh had better start brushing
up on his Spanish.  The film, which was nominated for an Oscar and has
already picked up awards from numerous film festivals (including a critics'
award at Cannes), features three stories united by a car crash on a busy
Mexico City street.
Each of the tales would be interesting enough on their own, but cobbled
together as uniquely as they are, the film become a devastating story about
fate and relationships.  Even the Amores tagline - "Don't worry if you don't
see this picture; you're going to live it anyway" - pokes fun at the Fickle
Finger.  All three stories feature a seriously flawed character with designs
on some sort of prize, but Fate always steps in (here, in the form of the
crash) to unexpectedly slap it away.
The first story is about a young unemployed man named Octavio (Gael Garcνa
Bernal) who is in love with his sister-in-law, Susana (Vanessa Bauche).  She
already has one baby, is expecting another and is still a student, but none
of this seems to bother Octavio, who feels his gangster brother Ramiro
(Marco Pιrez) isn't good enough for the beautiful Susana.  He dreams of
getting enough money to convince Susana to run away to Juarez with him and
accidentally finds it in Cofi, Ramiro's dog.  It turns out Cofi is one hell
of a fighter, and Octavio makes mad money pitting him against other dogs in
brutal (and illegal) fights.
Amores's second tale, titled "Daniel and Valeria," focuses on a magazine
editor and fashion model, respectively.  Daniel (Αlvaro Guerrero) is
successful, married and has two kids, but that doesn't stop him from moving
in with Valeria (Goya Toledo).  After being horribly disfigured in an
accident, Valeria's life becomes even worse when her little dog disappears
down a small hole in the floorboards of their new apartment.  The dog is
trapped in the hole, Valeria is trapped in a wheelchair, and Daniel is
trapped in a situation that makes him long for the boring life he just
abandoned.
The final vignette shows an old man named El Chivo (Emilio Echevarrνa)
living a life of squalor after walking out on his family to become a
revolutionary many years ago.  He has served time in prison but now spends
his days and nights tending to a flock of stray dogs...and the occasional
contract killing.  El Chivo (or "The Goat"), who looks a lot like DeNiro in
Angel Heart, is hired by a cop to kill his crooked partner, but he seems
more interested in stalking his estranged daughter, Maru (Lourdes
Echevarrνa).
Other than the crash, the stories don't really intertwine, but, once in a
while, you can see characters from one pop up in the background of another.
With a gritty, ultra-violent story about hitmen, stickups, a fixed fight and
a car crash told in fragmented time, you can't help but compare Amores to
Pulp Fiction or, really, anything Quentin Tarantino has written and
directed.  There have been several attempts to duplicate Tarantino's style
since Fiction was released and, while I don't know if it was the filmmakers'
intention to do so, this film is the best knock-off yet.  It's even better
than Go, which also featured three uniquely structured stories.  Writer
Guillermo Arriaga does a great job constructing the film around stories
involving dogs, as well as showing us that we don't get any wiser as we grow
old (Octavio is in his teens, Daniel is middle-aged and El Chivo is pushing
60).
Amores would have been an amazing enough film, but learning it's Alejandro
Gonzαlez Iραrritu's directorial debut is a little like getting the wind
knocked out of you.  Iραrritu, who also produced and expertly edited the
film, shows the poise and confidence of a feature-film veteran here and,
aided by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and scoremeister Gustavo
Santaolalla, has crafted the first great film of the new millennium.  This
is, hands down, the most auspicious debut I've seen in years.  Assuming you
can get over the subtitles and grisly dog fight scenes (the credit assure us
no dogs were harmed during filming, but it's just too intense to believe),
you'll probably feel the same way.

Review for Zamani barayé masti asbha (2000)
If movies about slapping inebriated mules is something that gets you
off, then have I got a film for you.  I don't think the
drunk-mule-abusing demographic is too hot on films from Iran, which is a
shame because A Time for Drunken Horses is really a great film.
Horses is set in an Iranian village near the Iraqi border.  Because of
the ongoing conflicts between the two countries, the snowy area is
littered with landmines, making passage extremely difficult.  This is
bad news for the Iranians who make their living smuggling goods to Iraq
via pack mule.  These smugglers give their mule alcohol, based on how
low the temperature is supposed to be.
Horses focuses on a family of five orphaned Kurdish children who have
lost their mother during childbirth and their father in a landmine
explosion.  The oldest children, Ayoub (Ayoub Ahmadi) and Rojin (Rojin
Younessi), have quickly assumed the roles of mother and father and
feverishly try to keep the younger kids healthy and happy.  They do a
good job, but 15-year-old Madi (Madi Ekhtiar-dini) is crippled and
requires pills and injections on a regular basis.  Madi also needs an
operation or he'll die.
Horses is partially narrated by Madi's younger sister, Amaneh (Amaneh
Ekhtiar-dini), who helps out however she can  whether it's wrapping
glasses in newspaper for strangers or helping brother Ayoub load their
mule with supplies to smuggle over the border.  The film has a great
opening scene, where Amaneh is asked a series of questions that help to
develop all of Horses' characters.
The film follows the struggles of the family to keep Madi in good
spirits while they try to find money for his surgery.  The children in
the film, who are all non-professional actors from the village Horses
was filmed in, all do an amazing job at making your heart break when you
watch their futile efforts bear little fruit.  Horses goes out of its
way to show that people and horses are in pretty much the same boat.
Actually, the horses get liquor, so they actually might be better off.
Horses is the directorial debut of Bahman Ghobadi, and the film won him
the Golden Camera Award (for best first feature) at the Cannes Film
Festival.  Those of you familiar with Iranian cinema may recognize
Ghobadi as the ditch-digger (and second unit director) in Abbas
Kiarostami's The Wind Will Carry Us.  Those of you really familiar with
Iranian cinema won't recognize him because the ditch-digger was never
actually seen in The Wind.

Title
Review for State and Main (2000)
Films about filmmaking always seem to play well with critics, and State
and Main isn't likely to be any different (for some reason, most critics
think they're in The Business).  David Mamet's (The Winslow Boy) seventh
directorial effort is a scathing, drop-dead hysterical look at the
out-of-touch insincerity of Hollywood and its uncanny ability to corrupt
everything it touches.
Main is set in tiny Waterford, Vermont, where the crew for a film called
`The Old Mill' has recently relocated after being kicked out of a
similar town in New Hampshire.  The film, which is supposed to be about
the search for purity set in the twilight of the 19th century, has
chosen Waterford not only for its sleepy, picturesque
porch-swing/white-picket-fence community, but also because the town is
home to two structures integral to the picture's plot  a mill and an
old firehouse.
Taking place in the week leading up the filming of `The Old Mill,' Main
features characters so real, so flawed and, for the most part, so
instantly dislikeable, it's hard not to find yourself immediately
wrapped up in their antics.  William H. Macy plays Walt Price, the
film's director, whose motto ("Shoot first  ask questions afterward')
is embroidered on a lucky pillow that he drags to each shoot.  Marty
Rossen (David Paymer, Bounce) is his producer, and the two men form an
intimidating pair with an aggressive manner surpassed only by their
ability to kiss the asses of their stars and trample the feelings of
pretty much everybody else.
The production of `The Old Mill' has plenty of hilarious stumbling
blocks to overcome before it begins principal photography.  The process
of casting extras for the film is at a standstill because of a local
play to which most of Waterford's citizens have already committed.  The
male lead (Alec Baldwin, Thomas and the Magic Railroad) has a thing for
underage girls and begins sniffing around a nubile young Waterford
native (Julia Stiles, Hamlet) as soon as he arrives in the small town.
The female star (Sarah Jessica Parker, Sex and the City) is balking at
her nude scene, despite the fact that it is clearly specified in her
contract.
On the more innocent side of things is Joseph Turner White (Philip
Seymour Hoffman, Almost Famous), the film's naďve
playwright-turned-screenwriter who is baffled by the behind-the-scenes
goings-on, not to mention the last-minute rewrites Price and Rossen
demand he make, even though they would completely change his original
script.  He meets a local bookseller (Rebecca Pidgeon  Mamet's
real-life wife), who becomes White's confidante and guiding light of
veracity.  Charles Durning (Everybody Loves Raymond) and Patti LuPone
(Summer of Sam) play Waterford's Mayor and his wife, who want only to
host an elaborate dinner party for the cast and crew of the film.
Throw in a big pothole on Waterford's Main Street, a local attorney with
political ambitions (What Lies Beneath screenwriter Clark Gregg), a
witty product-placement debate and a strange local catchphrase that the
filmies adopt as their own, and you'll start to wonder how Mamet was
able to pack all of this into a 90-minute film.  Heck, I was sad when it
ended, wishing it could continue for at least another 90.  The
writer/director's trademark hypnotically rhythmic salvos will do that
kind of thing to you.  The carefully written dialogue makes Main so much
more than just a classier, feature-film version of the short-lived
television show Action.
Another thing you can expect from a Mamet film is incredible acting
performances, and Main doesn't disappoint in that category, either.
Several actors could be in the hunt for Oscar nominations, especially
Hoffman, who plays his most normal (and most romantic) role to date as
the beleaguered screenwriter.  Main reminded me of the Mamet-penned Wag
the Dog, which also dealt with unscrupulous film folk and their
behind-the-scene shenanigans.  My only complaint (other than the short
running time) is a story thread involving the stained glass window of
Waterford's firehouse that goes unresolved.
If Kevin Bacon would only appear in one of Mamet's films, it would make
playing `The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon' a lot easier.  With Main, Mamet
seems to borrow a majority of his cast from the regulars that turn up in
Paul Thomas Anderson's films.  Anderson, in turn, seems to do his
casting from the roster of acting talent involved in films made by the
Coen brothers.  Hoffman and Macy were both in Anderson's Magnolia and
the Coens' The Big Lebowski.  Ricky Jay and Gregg were also in Magnolia,
as well as Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner.  And Durning is in the Coens'
upcoming O Brother, Where Art Thou?, in addition to the film version of
Mamet's play, Lakeboat.
1:30  Rated R for adult language and some cartoon nudity

Title
Review for Supernova (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Supernova is one super mess.  This sci-fi film is highly derivative, but
not even of decent space flicks.  It seems to have chosen only the bad
ones to rip off.  The story is simple:  A spaceship picks up a really
bad guy that tries to off everyone aboard.  Typically, he can also heal
his own injuries.  And speaking of being able to heal your own injuries,
here's a person that can't  Walter Hill.  The Last Man Standing
director asked that his name be taken off of the credits after the
studio recut the film.  Reportedly, Francis Ford Coppola reshot several
scenes.
The spaceship in question is the Nightingale, an emergency rescue vessel
that gets a five-day-old distress call from a mining colony located over
3,000 light years away.  Thanks to choppy editing, the complete lack of
character set-up and the weirdly similar hair colors/styles, the six
people aboard the Nightingale are tough to tell apart.  There's Dr.
Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett, Music of the Heart)  the black one  and
Benj Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz, Party of Five)  the one with the beard.
The other four all have short, black haircuts.
Rushing to the origin of the S.O.S. call, the Nightingale `jumps' into a
high gravity field, where debris from a moon damages the craft's
engines, leaving a precious eleven-minute window between the point of
recharge and being sucked into a giant sun.  To make matters worse, the
captain (Robert Forster, Psycho) doesn't survive the jump and creepy
recovering drug addict Nick Vanzant (James Spader, 2 Days in the Valley)
takes control of the mission.
But Nick doesn't seem nearly as disturbing as the person that placed the
distress call.  He's Troy Larson (Peter Facinelli, Can't Hardly Wait),
the son of some renowned space baddie.  He's pure evil and makes
everyone nervous, yet somehow is still able to nail the mouth-breathing
white girl Danika Lund (Robin Tunney, End of Days), despite the fact
that she's considering parenthood with her fellow space cadet boyfriend
Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips, Bats).  And the Nightingale picks
up not only this space hitchhiker, but also a strange nine-dimensional
substance that, of course, can wipe out humanity.
The laughable plot (or lack thereof) comes from David Campbell Wilson,
whose only other screenwriting credit is Jeff Speakman's martial arts
extravaganza The Perfect Weapon.  There are a couple of cool parts, like
the exterior shots of the Nightingale, and the fact Danika and Yerzy had
to fill out an application to be approved before they could consider
bringing another life into the world.  Hopefully in the future, it will
be as complicated to make a bad film as it is to reproduce.
1:41 - PG-13 for sci-fi action violence, adult situations and enough
near nudity to fend off an R rating

Title
Review for Chicken Run (2000)
DreamWorks has more than made up for its recent family debacle The Road
to El Dorado with Chicken Run, the best children's movie since the
inception of the Toy Story franchise.  The premise  a unlikely blend of
Nick Park's quirky, Oscar-winning animation and British humor combined
with the prison-break genre  hardly seems like the kind of thing a
typical American family would drag their kids to on Saturday afternoon,
but Run is the rare exception of a film that is extremely enjoyable
across the entire demographic board.
Armed with clever television spots that rip off Gladiator (`The egg that
became a chicken') and Mission: Impossible 2 (read C:R-1), Run is set on
Tweedy's Farm, where a large group of chickens lives in constant fear of
the low egg production that would enrage the farm's diabolical owner,
Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson, Sleepy Hollow).  If you don't make with
the embryos, you get the axe, and most of the chickens are happy enough
to go along with the farm's simple rules.  The one exception is a spunky
hen named Ginger (Julia Sawalha, Saffron from Absolutely Fabulous), who
spends her days dreaming up ways to escape.  It's easy enough to for her
to break out on her own, but Ginger is determined to take all of the
other chickens with her, as well.  To get supplies for her schemes, she
trades eggs with two entrepreneurial rats dressed in bad suits.
Run's hilarious opening credits feature a montage of Ginger's failed
Wile E. Coyote-type escape attempts (featuring the funniest blueprints
since Jay and Silent Bob's drafts in Mallrats), each resulting in her
being tossed into the coal bin by the henpecked Mr. Tweedy (Tony
Haygarth) and his two vicious dogs.  One night, while Ginger is
wallowing in self-doubt about her ability to rescue her friends, she
encounters what appears to be a flying rooster that lands in the chicken
compound.  The cock is Rocky `the Rooster' Rhodes (Mel Gibson, Payback),
and as he streaks through the sky, he shouts `Freedom!' like Gibson's
memorable deathbed line in Braveheart.
Ginger and her mates see Rocky as their saving grace and agree to
temporarily hide the rooster from his former keepers (a circus, where he
performed as `The Lone Free Ranger') in exchange for flying lessons.  Of
course, roosters can't fly, and the middle third of the film
concentrates on the American Rocky scamming the British chickens by
saying he'll teach them everything he knows about flying.  Standouts
among the other birds include a dimwitted knitter named Babs (Jane
Horrocks, Little Voice) and a crusty ex-RAF rooster named Fowler
(Benjamin Whitrow).
The need to escape Tweedy's Farm is hastened by the arrival of a
barn-sized machine that makes chicken potpies (`chickens go in  pies
come out').  The contraption is featured in a fantastic scene where
Rocky and Ginger try to escape its gravy-slicked clutches.  It's a
better action sequence that anything in M:I-2 or Gone in 60 Seconds (but
not Gladiator), and it made me incredibly hungry, too.
In addition to sharp marketing slogans (`Escape or Die Frying' and
`Learn to Fly or Bake Like Pie'), Run is full of clever puns (like `It's
raining hen' and  `She's poultry in motion') and makes numerous
references to other films (they meet in Coop No. 17 for their covert
meetings, a la Stalag 17).  At one point, when it's becoming clear that
Rocky might be a scam artist, one hen loudly wonders if the rooster is
even American (Gibson is from Australia).  And on the educational front,
we also learn that chicken not only have teeth, but lips, too (one plays
the harmonica).
Run was co-directed by Nick Park and Peter Lord, whose animated Wallace
& Grommit won two Oscars for Best Animated Short.  The screenplay was
written by Karey Kirkpatrick (James & The Giant Peach), who based the
script on an original story by Park and Lord.  Run may be a little
intense for some young children  especially the pie machine, and the
fantastic finale, which I won't even begin to describe here.  The `G'
rating seems a little light here, considering the amount of cowering I
witnessed during these two scenes.

Title
Review for Just Visiting (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
When it comes to poking fun at a country, France is an easy target. Sure,
they eat snails and don't wipe themselves after they shit, but we'll let
that slide.  The funniest thing about the French might be their sense of
humor...or complete lack thereof.  Bad Jerry Lewis films aside, two of the
country's most popular comedies (The Visitors and Little Indian, Big City)
are moronic, fish-out-of-water stories that failed in the U.S. and were
remade as even worse American films (Just Visiting and Jungle2Jungle,
respectively).
Why these two films?  One could contend the French enjoy the
fish-out-of-water genre because they all smell like fish out of water
themselves.  These are the kind of tired films that usually star Brendan
Fraser (Encino Man, The Scout, Blast From the Past, Monkeybone) and tank
domestically at the box office.  I'm not sure which is more of a shock -
that these films are so popular in France, or that they keep being remade
into unwatchable American movies.
The original Visitors, which was nominated for eight César Awards in 1994,
starred Jean Reno (before The Professional put him on U.S. radar) and
Christian Clavier, who also co-wrote the film's script.  Both stars and
co-writer/director Jean-Marie Poiré are back for this remake, which will
probably be one of the most unfunny films of 2001.  Visiting begins in 12th
century Sussex, where the French Count Thibault (Reno) is about to marry a
beautiful Englishwoman (Christina Applegate...can you believe Married With
Children debuted 14 years ago?).  Through some bunk involving a jealous man
and a witch, Thibault is given a potion that makes him hallucinate and kill
his new bride at their reception.
They sure knew how to do things right in the 12th century, as witnessed by
Thibault's immediate incarceration and scheduled beheading.  As he waits for
his date with the guillotine, Thibault and his faithful servant André
(Clavier) are visited by a wizard (Malcolm McDowell) who plans to rescue
them via time travel.  But he forgets to put an important ingredient in his
potion, and Thibault and André get trapped in the bowels of time...meaning
they end up in present-day Chicago.
Most of the film's comedy is supposed to come from Thibault and André being
amazed and frightened by every modern convenience, from cars to urinal
cakes.  None of it works.  Equally as weak is the story, which involves a
bookish museum curator (Applegate again) who thinks Thibault is her
long-lost cousin, but turns out to be his 30th generation descendant.  The
fact that Julia looks like Thibault's beloved makes absolutely no sense, and
the fact that they're related means they can't do it, which rules out any
typical screen romance.  Instead, the filmmakers throw us a romance bone in
the form of Tara Reid (American Pie), who both falls in love with the idiot
André and proves she's just as untalented as her own idiot fiancé, Carson
Daly.
Visiting is just plain awful, from the unoriginal script to the ridiculously
fake backgrounds used in the 12th century scenes.  The acting is bad, and
the direction is even worse.  The film offers a couple of laughs
(literally), and both come at the expense of the script's absurdity.
1:28 - PG-13 for violence and crude humor

Title
Review for Phantoms (1998)
I thought that I could go a bit further into the New Year (or at least
further into January) before I saw a film worse than Firestorm.  Boy,
was I ever wrong.
Now, I've read about 10 or 12 Dean Koontz books, but I don't think that
Phantoms was one of them.  The reason for my uncertainty is that most of
his work is pretty much the same.  I stopped reading Koontz for that
very reason.  He's Stephen King light.  And to make things more
frightening, the films made from his stories are turning out to be worse
than King's adaptations.
Phantoms is set in a small Colorado town where Jenny, the local doctor
(Joanna Going) has taken Lisa, her younger sister (Rose McGowan) home so
she could spend some quality time away from her alcoholic mother.
Driving into town, they notice that things seem very quiet.  Too quiet,
in fact.
To make matter worse, Jenny's housekeeper is all dead when they get
home.  The phone is dead and the car won't start, so Jenny and Lisa hoof
it to the police station, where they find (gasp) everyone dead.  Sound
creepy yet?  Didn't think so.
Eventually, some other cops (Ben Affleck and Liev Schreiber) come by
totowell, apparently just to read some really bad lines.  If they
wanted to make things REALLY scary, they would have taken a tape measure
to Schreiber's head.  That is one huge melon.  It's bigger than Billy
Corgan's and nearly as big as Rosie O'Donnell's.
The scenes that are supposed to be scary are just sad.  They are cut
together very poorly and lit even worse.  You can't really tell what's
happening or whom it's happening to.  That's why I spent most of the
movie imagining what McGowan (Scream and The Doom Generation) would look
like riding naked on my Kenmore vacuum cleaner.
By the time the evil expert Timothy Flyte (Peter O'Toole) shows up, I
was completely gone mentally.  So were about 15 people who got up and
left during my screening.  They were the lucky ones and I cursed them as
I drove home.
Nobody in the theater jumped, screamed or even inhaled suddenly.  It was
almost like they pumped carbon monoxide into the theater to quell the
teaming masses.  They didn't need to.  Phantoms is just plain bad
filmmaking.

Review for Mrs. Dalloway (1997)
I'm not going to lie to you.  Just the very thought of Mrs. Dalloway
sent shivers down my spine.  It's a period costume drama (Strike One).
It stars Vanessa Redgrave (Strike Two).  It's based on a Virginia Woolf
novel (Strike Three).  Still, I kept my mind relatively open.
The title character, played by Redgrave (Julia), is a snooty old
socialite.  She wakes up on the morning of her big party and won't
frigging shut up about it for a second.  Then, she finds out that Peter,
an ex-suitor from about 100 years ago, happens to be in town on the very
same day.  Apparently, Dalloway has always questioned her decision to
marry her current husband instead of this Peter.  The trouble is that
they're all a bunch of corpses now, so who really gives a crap?
There is also another story line about a shell-shocked war hero who
perpetually thinks that he is seeing a guy named Evans blown to bits
right in front of him.  That's right.  Explosions.  Smack dab in the
middle of this frighteningly boring story.  My guess is that the
explosions were put in to wake the sleeping viewer and, I'll have you
know that my neck snapped up so hard that my glasses almost flew off.
That's powerful filmmaking!
The only bright spot radiated from Natascha McElhone (The Devil's Own),
who played the young Dalloway in a series of mind-numbing flashbacks.
It was still hard to enjoy her, knowing that she would grow up and
become the annoying bird that can only seem to fixate on her party and
how any number of uncontrollable sources could effect its success.  And
you just know there's going to be a big dance scene.  YAY!
So, I'm basically saying that I really enjoyed Mrs. Dalloway and that
the people who are responsible for making it should not be killed or
harmed in any way.  Or something

Title
Review for Bad ma ra khahad bord (1999)
I don't know if my steady diet of reality television, but Abbas
Kiarostami's The Wind Will Carry Us seems a lot like Big Brother.  The
film plays like there are a bunch of hidden video cameras planted around
a tiny Iranian village.  As a viewer, I almost felt like I didn't belong
there  like a high tech eavesdropper.  It certainly doesn't seem like
anybody in The Wind is acting, as characters routinely turn their backs
to the cameras, uttering nearly inaudible words (thank God for
subtitles) that sound so natural, I doubt they were ever written in a
script.
The Wind takes place in the Siah Dareh, a pueblo-style town built into
the side of a mountain about 450 miles from Tehran.  Siah Dareh is in
the middle of nowhere and, according to one of its inhabitants, it was
purposely built to remain hidden to the world so it wouldn't be stolen.
It's also full of those cute little Gary Coleman-sized doorways.
The film's main character, who we know only as the Engineer (Behzad
Dourani), has brought a small crew of men to the dinky village with a
rather secretive mission, but the crew's assignment isn't the only thing
that Kiarostami keeps hush-hush in The Wind.  We hear the Engineer's
partners talk, but we never see them.  Ditto for a ditch digger that the
Engineer meets when he drives to the outskirts of town each time his
cell phone rings.  There's a dying woman in the town that seems to
figure into the Engineer's work, but we never see her, either.  In fact,
we never learn for sure what the Engineer is doing in Siah Dareh, but he
gives the townsfolk the impression that he's hunting for buried
treasure.
The Engineer befriends a studious young boy, who becomes his guide
through the history and customs of Siah Dareh.  The two share a love of
poetry (the title of the film comes from a poem), and their dialogue
flows so naturally, you'll swear they're making it up as they go along.
Every time the Engineer sees the boy, he asks about the dying woman.
The implication is that the Engineer and his crew are supposed to
document an ancient funeral custom that takes place in Siah Dareh.  But
he could also be the Angel of Death, too.
The main themes of The Wind do seem to concern life and death, but I
have a feeling that the whole film may just be Kiarostami's take on the
present political climate in Iran.  There's just something odd about a
guy digging a hole for what he explains will be part of a new
telecommunication system for a village that barely has electricity.
The Wind is chock full of some of the most beautifully shot landscapes
I've ever seen.  If there was a calendar for the film, I'd be first in
line to buy one.  Kiarostami's uncanny ability to omit large chunks of
the story and still keep the story interesting and understandable is
nothing short of amazing.

Review for Jesus' Son (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Would you get into a car that you knew was going to be in a horrific
accident?  Unless you're a character from David Cronenberg's Crash, the
answer is probably no.  But in Jesus' Son, FH has no problem making this
decision.  Hitchhiking, he accepts a ride from a nice family in an
Oldsmobile, waits for the crash and, afterwards, hangs around at the
hospital long enough to hear the mother's sickening screams.
FH (Billy Crudup, Without Limits) obviously isn't your ordinary guy.
His name, an abbreviation for `F--- Head', was given to him because he
constantly screws things up, especially when he tries to help people.
But who is FH?  Is he an angel?  Is he really Jesus' son, or did he just
listen to Velvet Underground's Heroin too many times?  Perhaps he's just
a delusional junkie.  FH says that he knows everything before it happens
and even knows the names of each raindrop.  But it's hard to tell if he
can really peer into the future, or if the drugs are making him think he
can.
Jesus' Son follows the adventures of FH during his
drug-and-alcohol-hazed travels throughout the 70s.  Beginning in Iowa
City and culminating in an Arizona nursing home, FH staggers throughout
the country searching for everything, yet, at the same time, nothing in
particular.  He meets strange people, finds strange lines of work, and
continually crosses paths with a woman named Michelle (Samantha Morton,
Sweet & Lowdown) that FH feels is his soulmate.  The couple often gets
together for weekends of sex and drugs that dissolve into screaming
fights.
The surreal film seems to lack a cohesive plot, partially due to the
fact that it's based on a collection of short stories written by Denis
Johnson.  I'm not sure if the tales in Johnson's book are as unrelated
as they appear here (it was adapted by three novice screenwriters), but
the film isn't really presented in a way that emphasizes separate
stories, resulting in a jumble of characters that you expect to jump
back into the story but never do.  There are only three constants  FH,
Michelle and the drugs.
Eerily resembling Kurt Cobain in both appearance and lethargic demeanor,
Crudup delivers a fine follow-up to his underrated turn as Steve
Prefontaine in last year's widely overlooked film Without Limits.  His
FH, who also narrates the movie, has eyes that look haunted and lost,
yet totally aware and ominiscient, which almost convinces you that he
does have some type of special healing power.  But like any decent film
that revolves around drug use (Drugstore Cowboy, Rush), it's hard to
decipher what's real as FH's hallucinations blend seamlessly into
reality.  Hell, one time I hit my thumb with a hammer so hard that I
thought I saw a leprechaun.
Directed by Alison Maclean (Crush), Jesus' Son offers a ton of great
70s songs and some fine supporting roles (namely Denis Leary, Holly
Hunter, Will Patton and Jack Black).  But the finest part of the film is
perhaps the utterly believable appearance of FH and Michelle.  These two
are simply disgusting.  The only time either of them got anywhere near
soap is when FH nearly overdosed and Michelle dragged him into a cold
shower hoping to revive him.  You could almost smell the stench of body
odor in the theater (or maybe it was that guy next to me).

Title
Review for Eye of the Beholder (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Who is The Eye?  We learn from the opening scene that he's some kind of
stealthy spy with enough hi-tech gadgetry to make Q drive off the road.
He totes a cool digital camera that can not only capture sound and
images from great distances, but also serves as a rifle.  As the film
opens, The Eye snaps some photographs of a guy putting the stones to the
company floozy in his office located across the street.  Before the guy
can even pull his pants up, The Eye has sent the pictures to every
computer and fax machine in his workplace.
After this initial episode, we learn a little more about The Eye.  He
checks in with his headquarters via a bossy liaison named Hilary (k.d.
lang), who fills in a few more blanks  The Eye is a loner that prefers
video conferencing to actual human contact.  Presumably he's like this
because of some tragedy that happened to his wife and daughter, the
latter of whom haunts The Eye's days and nights.  Hilary tells him that
his next assignment is to tail the boss' son, who is pilfering funds
from his trust fund.
As The Eye begins to work the case, he becomes infatuated with a
mysterious woman (Ashley Judd, Double Jeopardy) and abandons his work to
peep at her every move.  He's drawn further into her peculiar world
after witnessing her murder a gentleman caller and washing the blood off
of her naked body in the middle of a rainstorm.  Instead of making him
back off, The Eye proceeds to follow her around the country and watch as
she bumps other men off.  He trails her to Pittsburgh, New York, San
Francisco and all points boring and, at one point, stops to fondle the
wall of his hotel room bath while the mystery girl washes up on the
other side (yes, you get to see both of her Judds and the crack of her
Ashley).  And just when it seems like things can't get any dumber, in
marches Jason Priestley, who does a bottle-blond impression of James
Gandolfini in True Romance.
Oh, yeah, The Eye is played by Ewan McGregor (Phantom Menace), who
successfully makes his character seem creepy, tortured and
sleep-deprived in each scene.  It's the second McGregor film in a row
where the Scotsman doesn't show `little Ewan,' and, ironically, these
are his only two films that have opened number one at the box office.
Moral:  Keep it in your pants.    It's too bad he doesn't have a better
story to show off his talent (I mean big Ewan).
The script was written by Aussie director Stephan Elliott (The
Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert), who adapted it from Marc
Behm's novel of the same name.  And, brother, it's a mess.  You never
get a clear idea of what The Eye is trying to accomplish by stalking
this girl.  Is he trying to be her guardian angel?  Is he trying to
catch her?  Is he focusing his attention on her to make up for not
paying enough attention to his kid?  Or is he just a dirty Peeping Tom?
Don't ask me  I have no idea.  In the book, The Eye actually follows
his dream girl for ten years.  Here, it seems like two weeks.  Tops.
There are some pretty cool things in the film.  There are decent
visuals, especially when Elliott uses snow domes to blend into reality.
The score (Marius de Vries, William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet) is
moody and atmospheric, and the cinematography (Guy Dufaux, Jesus of
Montreal) is pleasantly bleak.  There are some things that don't work,
either, like the fact that The Eye tries to remain inconspicuous in
public while wearing a bright red coat.  But the main problem is with
the story, which seems oddly foreign.  Eye was filmed in Quebec with a
French-Canadian crew and has actually already been made into a film 
1993's Mortelle randonnée (Deadly Run), with Michel Serrault and
Isabelle Adjani.

Title
Review for Cookie's Fortune (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Robert Altman's (Short Cuts) latest film is a slow-moving,
southern-fried tale about an inbred small town and its annoying
inhabitants.  Set in Holly Springs, Mississippi, Fortune is cleverly
acted, but unfortunately its script is on the fast track to the tri-city
area of Predictaville, Boringstown and Dullsburg (which is, ironically,
just outside of Holly Springs).
Altman is the most celebrated ensemble-cast director of recent memory,
but his direction can't save the blah story by first-time writer Anne
Rapp, who previously was a script supervisor for The American President
and The Color Purple.  Her story centers around a rich eccentric widow
named Jewel Mae Orcutt (Patricia Neal, Hud) or "Cookie" to her friends.
She has a warm, Driving Miss Daisy-type relationship with Willis
Richland (Charles S. Dutton, Get on the Bus), the town drunk and catfish
enchilada guru, but on the eve of Easter she decides to blow her brains
out in hopes of being reunited with her late husband.  This simple
premise takes over thirty minutes to set up.
The trouble is that Cookie's carcass was discovered by her busybody
niece Camille Orcutt (Glenn Close, Paradise Road), who, believing she
will be the heiress to the Orcutt fortune, decides to make the suicide
look like a murder.  Since his prints were all over the gun - he had
cleaned Cookie's collection the previous evening Willis becomes the
most likely suspect and is immediately incarcerated.
The rest of the film unfolds like a bed sheet forged in extra static
cling.  The only thing that livens it up are the kooky characters 
especially Julianne Moore (Psycho) as Cora Duvall, Camille's nitwit
sister and the star of the town church's stage presentation of Oscar
Wilde's `Salome.'  Things liven up a bit once Courtney B. Vance (The
Preacher's Wife) shows up to investigate the murder/suicide, but by that
point the film has already overstayed its welcome.  All the viewer can
do is sit back, relax, and wait for the obligatory shot of someone
getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar.
2:00  PG-13 for violence, sexual content and some mild adult language

Title
Review for Freddy Got Fingered (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Okay, let's cut to the chase:  If you're a fan of The Tom Green Show, you'll
probably really like Freddy Got Fingered.  If you hate the show, or can't
stand Tom Green, you've got no business going to see it.  And for the folks
that don't know who Tom Green is, consider yourself warned - Freddy is a
solid 12 on the gross-out scale (out of 10).  As if the title wasn't enough
of a warning...
Green, who also directed and co-wrote Freddy, plays Gord Brody, a cartoonist
(the third we've seen this year, after Monkeybone and Tomcats) who, as the
film opens, is about to relocate from his parents' basement in Portland to
Hollywood, where he's already secured a job at a cheese sandwich factory
until he hits it big and sells his animation ideas.  His parents (Rip Torn
and Julie Hagerty) proudly wave goodbye to their oldest son as he drives off
in the new car they've just bought for him.  Less than three minutes later,
he's grabbing horse cock.
It turns out that Gord is a phenomenally bad, unfocused cartoonist who is
given some shaky advice by a cartoon bigwig (played by Anthony Michael
Hall) - quit his day job and "get inside the animal."  The latter direction
is supposed to help Gord flesh out his crude animated characters, but
instead affords him the opportunity to play with roadkill.  And that's
before he falls in love with a handicapped, amateur rocket scientist with an
oral fixation who gets off on being caned.
The bulk of Freddy focuses on the relationship between Gord and his
overbearing father.  Gord thinks he's getting treated unfairly, while his
dad wonders why he can't be like younger brother Freddy (Eddie Kaye Thomas,
Black and White), a gainfully employed bank teller.  If you're familiar with
Green's television show, some of the film's content, one might theorize, is
probably based on his relationship with his real father, a man who spent his
entire career in the military.
This ain't Citizen Kane here.  There's a ton of gross-out material, and
almost none of it is even slightly integral to the plot.  The film is
two-thirds over before you realize what the title means.  Freddy's music
often overpowers its dialogue, which some may actually consider a good
thing.  But none of that matters when you're busting your gut watching a
delirious Torn run though Pakistan wearing nothing but a bathrobe.
Green has no real professional acting experience, no familiarity with
writing feature-film scripts and absolutely zero know-how when it comes to
directing.  But you know what?  There are a lot of films that are worse than
Freddy - films made by experienced talent. You have to admire his ability to
cajole money from a major film studio to make this thing, too.  And he does
all of his own stunts.  He's the complete package, or a real tool, depending
on if you like him or not.  Personally, I don't think Green is too far off
from Jim Carrey's work on In Living Colour.  Green is just as funny and just
as unpolished as Carrey was back then - a real diamond in the rough who is
probably going to be around a lot longer than 15 minutes (hey, if J. Lo can
do it, why can't he?).
The only other actor to emerge from Green's gigantic shadow is Torn, who, if
you can believe it, plays a more vulgar version of his Larry Sanders
character.  He is perfectly cast here.  Freddy also features cameos from
Green's new wife Drew Barrymore, Shaquille O'Neal and Canadian TV talk-show
host Mike Bullard, who once threw up on live television when Green taunted
him with a dead animal.  And if you look close, you can see footage of Green
's lymph-node surgery, too.

Title
Review for Next Best Thing, The (2000)
There are a few ways I considered mocking the new film The Next Best
Thing.  I could have chosen to go with a hilarious send-up of the title
and say that Madonna's new project is The Next Best Thong, a riveting
expose about how she chooses which underwear to purchase at Victoria's
Secret (`Show me the next best thong, dah-ling').  I could have gone
with the Rupert Everett gay angle and said something pretentious like
`The Queen of Pop and the Queen of England.'  Or I could have said that
The Next Best Thing to slamming your head in the car door would be to
see this film.
The beauty of The Next Best Thing is that it's not necessary to mock
it.  It mocks itself for you.  The film starts out mildly interesting at
best, before taking a very unexpected turn and spinning completely out
of control.  After the sixty-minute point rolls around, the person
sitting next to you may politely ask you to stop checking your watch
every five minutes because the blue glow keeps waking him up.  After
that, the only reason you might choose to stick around is the challenge
of trying to figure out how they're going to end the stupid movie
without it seeming like a really bad sitcom pilot.  But that's where
Thing really steps up to the plate, ending the film with absolutely no
resolution.  Hey, as long as it ended, I didn't much care.
Thing attempts to capitalize on America's undying love for
homosexualsas long as they're either well-chiseled or funny and sing
show tunes.  Madonna (Evita) plays Abbie, a successful thirtysomething
yoga instructor with a biological clock that's about to overheat thanks
to being dumped by her current beau (Michael Vartan, Never Been
Kissed).  Her best friend Robert (Everett, Inspector Gadget) is a
successful thirtysomething landscaper and prefers hot dogs to donuts.
After Abbie laments the mandatory `There aren't any good straight guys
left in L.A.,' the two get drunk on the fourth of July and knock boots
as the fireworks explode in the background.
Of course, their one sexual encounter impregnates Abbie, who ignores
Robert for weeks before finally dropping the bomb.  `You can be the
baby's father or the baby's uncle,' she says, and, predictably, he
chooses the former, as the two plan to live together and raise the kid.
The pregnancy lasts for about three minutes (Madonna just doesn't do
morning sickness), and from the way the film is edited their offspring
Sam (Malcolm Stumpf) appears to be born a theatrical, buck-toothed
first-grader that's just old enough to know that something is definitely
rotten in Denmark.
To make matters worse, Abbie starts dating an investment banker
(Benjamin Bratt, Law & Order), which is when Thing begins to display all
of the jealousy that you would expect from both your typical hetero/homo
romance and a script from the guy that wrote Look Who's Talking Now
(Thomas Ropelewski).  Thing is so uneven, I heard that they're
considering using it for women's gymnastics in the upcoming Olympic
games.
Thing also features the most annoying lighting since The Mirror Has Two
Faces.  Madonna is not only perpetually backlit, but also has a constant
source of light shining on directly on her face.  It's like a
combination of Doris Day and Anjelica Huston's Morticia Addams, and it
grows more and more disturbing as the film progresses.  One has to
wonder if Ms. M demanded slick cinematographer Elliot Davis (Out of
Sight, Forces of Nature) light her that way, so as not to reveal that
she's a craggy old woman.  On the plus side, she does a pretty good job
of hiding her suspicious British accent.
An interesting note, actor Michael Vartan is only in the film for about
five minutes, but manages to have another Ferris wheel scene, a la his
ride with Drew Barrymore in Never Been Kissed.

Title
Review for Idioterne (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
In 1995, Danish writer/director Lars von Trier established Dogma, a
oddly restrictive anti-establishment filmmaking manifesto that requires
its participants to take a vow of chastity forbidding the use of, among
other things, props, sets, artificial sound and light, lens filters and
superficial action, all while filming with one handheld camera.  To
date, it's worked wonders  producing von Trier's phenomenal Breaking
the Waves, Thomas Vinterberg's The Celebration and 1999 Cannes favorite
Mifune. von Trier's decree also forces its filmmakers to give up the
idea that they are creating art `at the cost of any good taste and any
aesthetic considerations.'  Yikes!
After watching The Idiots you could get the impression that von Trier is
probably more than a little like the film's lead, Stoffer (Jens
Albinus).  Stoffer is the ringleader of a very bizarre co-ed communal
household of fellow Danes that have shunned the normal life for that of
relative idiocy.  That's right  I said idiocy.  The David Lynch
lookalike Stoffer and his housemates venture out into civilization for
the sole purpose of acting like retards.
Now before you get all upset, think back to Matt Dillon telling Cameron
Diaz about his little friend `Mongo,' and tell me that you didn't laugh
up a lap full of popcorn.  Acting retarded isn't wrong.  In fact, Adam
Sandler gets $20 million per picture to do it.  Someday you might even
encourage your kids to do the same.
But these idiots are different than Sandler's.  They're probably closer
kin to Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt in The Impostors  people using
their skills to con themselves into positions that are generally
unobtainable by the average Joe (or, in this case, your average Bjřrn).
Acting retarded is handy when you're dining out and want to skip out on
the check.  It can also get you access to tour a factory that would
otherwise be off-limits.
Don't get me wrong  this movie shouldn't make you think of Pauly
Shore.  It's a fascinating character study that makes you wish that the
film could continue on after the credits role, just so you could learn
more about what makes these people tick (the handheld filming gives The
Idiots a very real, documentary feel).  Why is Stoffer so hell-bent on
obtaining perfect idiocy?  Why do the young lovebirds Jeppe (Nikolaj Lie
Kaas) and Josephine (Louise Mieritz) still act retarded during their
first romantic encounter?  Why does Karen (Bodil Jřrgensen) seem so
willing to be kidnapped by the idiots during one particular scam?
Trying to answer these questions is pretty futile once the
full-penetration scene hits the screen.  But I'm not complaining

Title
Review for Mystery, Alaska (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
TV scribe David E. Kelley's second big-screen effort of the year is a
hackneyed adult version of The Mighty Ducks.  Film fans, beware  this
does not mean Slapshot.  In the movie, a small Alaskan town  and its
highly competitive brand of ice hockey - graces the cover of Sports
Illustrated, culminating in a showdown with the New York Rangers.  It's
a typical David-versus-Goliath picture, with the `loser' title affixed
only to the sucker in the audience that plunked down green to watch this
slow-moving abomination.
The first words in Mystery, Alaska are an expletive spoken by a kid too
young to know any better.  I'm not sure if this is supposed to be
Kelley's attempt at irony (most of the adults say `jeez' and `for God's
sake' a la another snowy pic, Fargo) or his craving to work `blue' after
years and years of living under the watchful eye of television censors.
Remember Betty White in Kelley's summertime flop Lake Placid?  It's
probably the latter.
As the film opens, Mystery eagerly awaits the new issue of Sports
Illustrated, where a feature piece on the town's beloved `Saturday Game'
is scheduled to appear.  Arriving not long after the magazine is former
resident Charles Danner (Hank Azaria, Mystery Men) an employee of Sports
Illustrated, who arrives bearing great news  the National Hockey
League, impressed with the article, has agreed to fly the New York
Rangers to Mystery for an exhibition game against the locals.
Here is Problem No. 1:  I can look past the fact that the New York
Rangers would never play Mystery, but why would the game take place in
Alaska?  Would it not make more sense to fly the Mystery players to New
York so that the game could be played on a real ice rink?  In a bigger
arena?  Where you wouldn't need to fly a television crew and legions of
media personalities?  Mystery has 32 days to prepare for the game, both
in terms of team preparation and to remedy the fact that they usually
play on a pond in front of about fifty people.  They acquire a Zamboni
while workers quickly build a grandstand and install intricate
lighting.  In one shot, the film shows four cranes building the outdoor
rink.  I don't think there are four cranes in the entire state of
Alaska, let alone Mystery.
And let's talk about the advertising.  Once the game begins, viewers
will see a ton of advertising both on and around the rink.  Locals even
complain about this advertising, which is simply the filmmaker's way of
saying `See, this isn't really product placement.  It's an integral part
of the story.'  Bullshit.  Use make-believe advertisers if you want, but
don't try to legitimize the giant Coca-Cola logo at center ice that
fills the entire screen for the opening face-off.
There are plenty of other things to complain about, like the fact that
Kelley manages to somehow wedge in a legal battle involving the
potential opening of the mega-store Price World and its Mystery-bashing
emissary (Michael McKean).  Or the use of the Winetka brothers (Adam
Beach and Leroy Peltier) lifted right from Slapshot's Hansons.  Or the
cameo from Mike Myers (Mystery director Jay Roach also helmed both
Austin Powers pics), which reveals the actor's unfunny side.  Or The
Daily Show's hysterical Beth Littleford, who appears long enough to be
only a throwaway sexual joke.
None of the above complaints come close to matching the annoying and
time-consuming subplot in which the team coach/town sheriff John Biebe
(Russell Crowe, L.A. Confidential) is dropped from the big game in favor
of a younger, faster player with premature ejaculation.  This,
exacerbated by the arrival of his wife's (Mary McCormack, True Crime)
high school sweetheart (Azaria), leads to rocky times in the Biebe
household, leaving the film filled with the gooey sentiment of the worst
imaginable Hallmark card.
Highlights include town judge/coach Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights), who
resembles another old guy named Burgess Meredith in Rocky, shouting
advice to his team through clenched jaw andwell, that's about it.

Review for Armageddon (1998)
>From the creative team that invented the "why don't we all just whip it
out and see whose got the biggest dick" film, Armageddon surpasses its
predecessors in budget, effects and pure testosterone output. I'm
talking about Jerry Bruckheimer (ConAir, Crimson Tide) and Michael Bay
(The Rock, Bad Boys), the guys that seem to annually discharge the type
of "sword-fight" picture that features an all male cast and relies on
big explosions to keep their date-raping homophobe frat-boy legions
glued to the screen. You just know if these two were involved in the
music business, they would probably be responsible for the horrific
big-haired cock-rock that came into popularity in the mid 80's.
With that said, Armageddon is still good. Well, maybe good isn't the
right word. It is very entertaining and even features (gulp) a female in
a sort of important role. Not peripheral characters like Nicolas Cage's
wife in ConAir or Sean Connery's daughter in The Rock, but a real honest
to goodness woman whoOKmaybe I'm exaggerating. She's still just eye
candy.
The following is an excerpt of the PLANET SICK-BOY review for Deep
Impact. There really isn't any point in me thinking up a fresh way to
say what I can just cut and paste from somewhere else. It's pretty much
the same story, so everybody follow along:
The premise is simple  an asteroid the size of New York City is headed
toward Earth, threatening  global destruction and the eventual
extinction of all its inhabitants. And no, the world isn't saved by  an
Apple PowerBook or Slim Whitman records.
No doubt aided by a story culled from recent headlines, Deep Impact is
also set apart from the rest of the big budget schlock by tapping into
real human emotion. Some of the heartstring tugging is a little too much
to handle, but if you're used to the weekly emotion manipulation hour
every Thursday night at 10:00 PM, it won't seem quite so painful. I
wonder if you can get an emotion callous? I  wonder how many times I can
use the word "emotion" in this paragraph?
Just replace the title and the part about "tapping into real human
emotion". Not that the typical "Bruce saves the world" movie usually
disappoints in that department. While Deep Impact spent more time
developing characters, Armageddon spent that time (and 30 additional
minutes) blowing stuff up. In fact, it cost more to market Armageddon
($80,000,000.00) than it did to make Deep Impact. Them explosions ain't
cheap, but I'm sure that they'll payoff when the dust settles and the
final numbers come in. Armageddon will likely outgross its rival within
two weeks.
The other main difference in Armageddon is that the ragtag bunch sent
off into space to take care of the asteroid isn't an experienced group
of astronauts, but a crusty team of oil drillers. Join us, as we meet
the main players:
Harry Stamper (Willis, The Fifth Element) - the best oil rigger in the
world, Harry owns runs the company that employs the other cast members.
He is also the father of...
Grace Stamper (Tyler, Stealing Beauty) - the beanpole that came of age
on the big rig and, thusly, has fallen for one of her father's workers
named...
A.J. Frost (Affleck, Good Will Hunting) - the cocky young-turk driller
who, when he isn't penetrating the earth for black gold, penetrates the
doe-eyed Grace behind his boss's back
Rockhound (Buscemi, ConAir) - the crazy kooky guy with the messed up
teeth
Jayotis "Bear" Kurleen (Michael Duncan) - the black guy
Oscar Choi (Owen Wilson, Bottle Rocket) - the cowboy
Chick (Will Patton, The Postman) - the other guy
Like I said, not much character development and that's kind of
surprising in a film with a 2 1/2 runtime. Even more unexpected is the
fact that it was born of a writing team that, individually, was
responsible for Jumanji and The Devil's Advocate. Rumor has it that the
studio brought in some heavy hitting script doctors to punch up the
story, but it doesn't really show. For the record, they are Paul
Attanasio (Donnie Brasco), Ann Biderman (Primal Fear) and Robert Towne
(Chinatown).
But, who needs a script when size is the only thing that matters?
Armageddon is probably the slickest looking film this side of Titanic.
While the actual events are completely preposterous, they look very
authentic. Credit Titanic King of the World and his effect company,
Digital Domain, for the realism. And bored viewers can look for Digital
Domain's creepy metal skull (from T2) trademark, which appears a few
times in the film.
So, basically, don't go to see a great movie. Go to have a great time.

Review for Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Disney's annual summer animation extravaganza has the misfortune of opening
less than 30 days after Shrek bowed to rave reviews and boffo box office.
The DreamWorks film is certainly a hard act to follow, but Atlantis: The
Lost Empire has one other thing working against it:  It's simply nowhere
near as entertaining.  (This is the second year in a row that DreamWorks
kicked Disney's ass in the Battle of Summer Animation - it was the wonderful
Chicken Run versus the stupid Dinosaur in 2000.)
Sure, you could say Atlantis is being unfairly compared to Shrek (the former
uses standard animation while the latter opted for cutting-edge computer
animation). You could just as easily blame the whole thing on Disney, who
hired the directors (Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise) and writer (Tab Murphy)
responsible for The Hunchback of Notre Dame, which was arguably the Mouse
House's biggest summer animation flop in years. But my finger points at
comic book creator Mike Mignola. The author of Hellboy has to be the person
responsible for filling a Disney cartoon with uncharacteristic violence,
superhero dialogue, sci-fi fantasy scenarios and scantily clad women with,
uh, positive attributes. They even unspooled early scenes of Atlantis at a
comic book convention last summer.
It's not like Disney didn't exert the effort to make Atlantis into a decent
film. They even went so far as to get the guy who developed phony dialects
for Star Trek to make up an Atlantian language and also brought in
hotter-than-hot writer Joss Whedon from Buffy the Vampire Slayer (he, too,
has connections to comic books) to punch up Murphy's script. This could
explain why Atlantis seems so similar to the dud that permanently closed the
doors of rival Fox's animation studios last year. That's right - Whedon also
had a screenwriting credit on the dismal Titan AE. What's more, Atlantis
shares more than a few similarities to Warner Brothers' critically acclaimed
underachiever The Iron Giant, which, like Titan and Atlantis, strayed more
toward dark drama than the lighthearted musicals we had been getting
spoon-fed by Disney on an annual basis. Are the forefathers of animation
scrambling to keep up with the times? It sure looks like it, but right now
they seem to be running in place.
After a quick prologue that shows the advanced civilization of Atlantis
(they had spaceships, even) being wiped out by a giant wave, the film
flashes forward to 1914 Washington, D.C., where a nerdy Christopher Columbus
wannabe named Milo Thatch (voiced by Michael J. Fox) is about to pitch a
proposal to his stuffy museum colleagues (led by David Ogden Stiers). Milo,
the wiry laughingstock of the museum, wants his superiors to finance an
expedition to find the lost city of Atlantis, but they pooh-pooh him away,
saying that he's just as silly as his dead grandfather.
But armed with Grandpa's lucky hat and fat journal, Milo finds an old,
yoga-loving kook (John Mahoney) to bankroll his voyage into the briny deep.
Before you know it, Milo is being whisked away in a state-of-the-art
submarine, complete with a crew that must have been assembled by the Rainbow
Coalition. There's a powerfully gentle black doctor (Phil Morris), a Latino
mechanic (Jacqueline Obradors), a gravelly-voiced octogenarian (Florence
Stanley), a hillbilly (the deceased Jim Varney), an Italian who sounds like
a stereotypical Father Guido Sarducci-type (Don Novello, of course) and an
unwashed Frenchman with flies constantly buzzing around him (Corey Burton).
The sub is led by Commander Lyle T. Rourke (James Garner) and his icy
sidekick, Helga Sinclair (Claudia Christian).
Their journey includes a Leviathan attack that reduces the crew from 200 men
to just a couple dozen, but that all hardly matters when Milo and company
finally find Atlantis, which is still a thriving metropolis full of folks
with dark skin and white hair (in other words, a city crawling with Bob
Barker clones). Milo meets King Kashekim Nedakh (Leonard Nimoy) and
instantly falls in love with his daughter, Princess Kida (Cree Summer),
whose mother was lost during the whole wave thing. There's a lot of talk
about a special light, a mysterious power source and the "Heart of
 Atlantis," but not much makes sense until Rourke and Helga reveal
themselves to be mercenaries who have come in search of Atlantis' energy
supply so they can sell it to the Kaiser.
As if that wasn't dumb enough, there are a few subtitled scenes, loads of
gunplay and a body count that rivals Pearl Harbor's. Atlantis is way too
complicated for kids and just too dull for adults. There might be a very
narrow age demographic that could enjoy it, like boys between the ages of
9.31 and 9.44 - and, of course, 13-year-old boys, who will probably get a
funny feeling after gazing upon the women.

Review for J'aimerais pas crever un dimanche (1998)
`You're horny for a dead girl.'  I can't recall a line from a film as
startling as this.  It's even more alarming because the line doesn't
seem as disquieting during Don't Let Me Die on a Sunday, the latest
French romp through such topics as AIDS, necrophilia and other forms of
deviant sex.
Sunday begins by chopping two different scenes together.  One shows
19-year-old Térésa (Élodie Bouchez, The Dreamlife of Angels) being
slipped a mickey while she's at a smoking rave party.  The other shows
two guys double-teaming a girl in what appears to be a hospital, or some
other type of sterile environment.
The two separate stories quickly merge as Térésa hits the floor like a
sack of potatoes, is pronounced dead and taken to the local morgue,
where the two tag-team partners are employed as attendants.  One of the
men is Ben (Jean-Marc Barr), an apparently sexually frustrated chap who
has been on the job for four years and has clearly flipped his lid.  He
waits to get Térésa's body to himself, and then performs unknown carnal
acts upon it (unknown because, thankfully, they don't show it).
Then, in every necrophiliac's worst nightmare (or their ultimate fantasy
 I'm not sure I care to know), Térésa wakes up while Ben is slamming
away at her.  The authorities are stunned, but for some reason, Térésa
won't press charges, so there's nothing they can do.  Ben is suspended,
and followed first by the girl's father, who beats the shit out of Ben,
and they by Térésa herself.  Naturally, she finds herself drawn to the
man that fucked her back from the other side.
Térésa and Ben link up to perform some pretty strange sexual acts,
although never on each other.  Ben introduces her to a small group of
his friends, who are equally as bent sexually.  One is dying of AIDS in
a hospital, and Ben's friends perform a late night kidnapping to take
him to an isolated cabin to spend his remaining days.  And straight from
Girl on the Bridge, there's a scene where Térésa and Ben save a man who
is about to off himself on a viaduct.  They incorporate him into their
sexual games.
Sunday was written and directed by Didier Le Pęcheur, whose film isn't
nearly as good as Lynne Stopkewich's Kissed, which was about a woman
having sex with dead guys.  The film's subtitles are tough to read
against the white lab coats that are prominently displayed throughout
the film.  Bouchez and Barr do a decent job acting, with the latter
looking like a bizarre cross between Jeremy Piven and Croupier's Clive
Owen.  The film may be trying to deliver an important message about the
state of sex in a world full of various deadly, sexually transmitted
diseases, but it comes off as something made just to get a rise out of
viewers.

Review for Mononoke Hime (1997)
Imagine that you're in the woods and you hear a noise.  Birds and other
animals scatter.  Something else is out there.  And it's getting closer.
If you think this is the latest Blair Witch spoof, you're dead-wrong
(and probably a victim of the non-stop internet ads announcing its video
release).  This story takes place some six centuries ago in feudal Japan
and the rustling in the woods is actually a giant boar covered with what
seems to be millions of earthworms.  Ashitaka sees this creature bearing
down on his village one day while riding his red elk through the
forest.  He believes the animal to be a threat (wouldn't you?) and slays
the beast, but not before it gives Ashitaka both an ominous message and
an itchy arm rash.
Instead of being hailed as a hero, Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup,
Without Limits) is banished from the village as a result of the injury
to his arm.  Even though he is the Prince and the last in the bloodline
of a family that was driven from town 500 years ago, Ashitaka is told he
is suffering from an evil infection and booted out into the surrounding
forest to die.  While the infection may not actually be evil, it does
bestow Ashitaka with some strange powers.  When physically confronted,
he is able to knock the heads and arms off adversaries with a simple bow
and arrow.
Desperate to learn the mysteries of the giant boar and seeking a cure to
his affliction, Ashitaka heads for Iron Town, an industrial village
compromised of women that are nearly busting out of their tops.  Why
they don't call it `Cleavage Town' is beyond me, as it would certainly
be a boom for local tourism.  Ashitaka meets Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver,
An Ideal Husband), the leader of Iron Town hell-bent on rampaging
through the lush Japanese forests to use its untapped natural resources
for iron production.
This puts Eboshi at odds with San (or Princess Mononoke), a human raised
by the Wolf Gods.  San (Claire Danes, Brokedown Palace) is intent on
stopping the progress of encroaching civilization, which could threaten
to disturb the forces of nature.  The main force of nature is a creature
called the Forest Spirit, which changes into the Night Walker at dusk.
Confusing?  Yes, but better than Night Walker, Texas Ranger.
The animated Princess Mononoke was a runaway box office success in Japan
a couple of years ago, second all-time only to a little film called
Titanic.  The battle between environment and industry probably played
well in Japan, but I just can't see too many Americans getting into the
story.  In order for a cartoon to succeed in this country, we apparently
need a linear plot and upbeat musical numbers.  Look what happened to
The Iron Giant.  Never mind the complicated story - the half-wits here
in America won't even be able to tell Ashitaka and San apart.  Okay,
neither could I.  They both looked like Speed Racer.  It's too long and
violent for children and seems to be targeted to the small segment of
our population that enjoys Japanese anime.
On the plus side, Mononoke's landscapes look pretty fantastic, but not
as good as Tarzan.  Writer/director Hayao Miyazaki  a.k.a. the Japanese
Walt Disney  has crafted a very intelligent story about the
co-existence of humans and the forest.  The version that will hit U.S.
theaters was dubbed in English and spiced up by Neil Gaiman, who created
a popular monthly comic called "The Sandman".  And there were these
really cool cuddly little tree-dwelling creatures called Kodama that
shook their heads and made a sound like the one that coincided with the
appearance of the Tiki idol in the Hawaiian episodes of The Brady
Bunch.  A bit heavy-handed, but still enjoyable.

Title
Review for Sleepy Hollow (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Tim Burton puts his unique stamp on Washington Irving's classic short
story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, and the result is a genuinely
frightening and campy picture that's funny in all the right places.
Though changes have been made to Irving's yarn, viewers will likely
appreciate Burton's dark sense of humor, as well as Hollow's fantastic
visual effects.
Hollow opens with a fast, bumpy stagecoach ride through the woods near
Albany, New York.  The passenger (an uncredited Martin Landau) peeks his
head out, notices that the driver no longer has his, and leaps from the
moving carriage.  As he runs through the woods and into a cornfield, the
man comes across a creepy scarecrow that could be an early ancestor of
Burton's Jack Skellington.  Terrified, he stops, turns and is
decapitated by a headless horseman.
Flash to a 1799 New York City courthouse, where the judge impatiently
listens to Constable Ichabod Crane's (Johnny Depp, The Astronaut's Wife)
customary lecture about the importance of collecting evidence from the
scenes of crimes in order to fairly prosecute guilty parties.  Tired of
his liberal thinking, the judge sends Crane to investigate three bizarre
murders in an isolated Dutch farming community called Sleepy Hollow in
Upstate New York.  So Crane, somewhat of a forefather of modern forensic
science, packs his bags with strange chemicals and what looks to be
nightmarish homemade dental tools.
Once he arrives in Sleepy Hollow, the town's leaders give Crane the
lowdown on the murders.  Each victim was beheaded, but the heads were
never found.  Worse yet, Crane learns that the killer is believed to be
the ghost of a Hessian trooper (Christopher Walken, Blast From the Past)
who was himself beheaded twenty years earlier, leaving his spectre to
ride a mighty black steed through the West Woods in a nightly quest for
his skull.  Crane, a weak-hearted fraidy cat prone to fainting spells,
realizes he may be in way over his head.
There are a few sticky points, namely the inclusion of Crane's nightmare
flashbacks to his childhood, where his buxom mother (Lisa Marie) dabbled
in witchcraft.  This appears to be added only to show off Marie's
fantastic rack  she's Burton's real-life girlfriend and has appeared in
his last few films.  But this transgression can easily be overlooked,
however, becausewell, because of the aforementioned rack.  Burton's
film seems pretty true to its source, right down to Katrina Van Tassel's
(Christina Ricci, The Opposite of Sex) `plump as a partridge' stature to
the name of Crane's dusty horse (Gunpowder).  Burton even one-ups his
predecessor, using the twisted, gnarled limbs of The Tree of the Dead as
the Horseman's home.
The major change to Irving's work concerns Crane.  In the book he was a
kindly schoolteacher and musician, and is physically described as
follows:
`He was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and
legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have
served for shovels and his whole frame most loosely hung together.  His
head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy
eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weathercock
perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew.  To see
him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his
clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him
for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow
eloped from a cornfield.  His sharp elbows stuck out like
grasshoppers'.'
Doesn't exactly make you think of Johnny Depp, does it?  Howard Stern,
maybe, but not Johnny Depp.  Irving's remarkably vivid representation of
the protagonist stood out in my memory more than any other part of the
original work - it's probably the best description I've ever read.  In
the text, the Horseman's cranium was blasted off by a cannonball in a
nameless Revolutionary War battle.  Interestingly, the script does
include a `woman in white' that lived in the haunted woods, referring to
one of the many legends Irving's townsfolk believed in his story.
In Irving's account, the story was told first-person after Crane's
encounter with the Headless Horseman.  Here, Burton and his writers
(Andrew Kevin Walker of Se7en fame and special-effects specialist Kevin
Yagher) have made the film into more of a Scooby-Doo murder-mystery, and
the baddie is nearly as easy to finger.  For a few minutes in this film,
it seemed like the Horseman was turning into an unstoppable clichéd
modern horror figure, like Freddie or Jason.  The Horseman's battle with
Crane and Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien, The Omega Code) easily puts
any skirmish in The World is Not Enough to shame.
Indescribably beautiful, from Danny Elfman's score to Emmanuel Lubezki's
(Meet Joe Black) amazing cinematography to the breathtaking technical
design work from the team responsible for Fargo, Kafka, Aliens and
Gattaca, Burton's film captures the mood and feel of Irving's short
right down to the eerie wooden bridge and the perpetual fog that seems
to constantly roll through the gloomy town.  And you can't help but
think about Burton's Gotham in Batman when Hollow shows a view of 1799
New York City.
As a side note, the closing credits list a Conrad Hall as the director
of photography for the New York unit of the film crew.  I have been
unable to confirm that this is the same Conrad Hall that was nominated
for Best Cinematography at last year's Oscars (for A Civil Action), as
well as an early favorite for this year's ceremony (American Beauty).

Review for Get Over It (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Give a teenager a reading assignment, and they'll grumble up a storm.  Make
a movie out of the same reading assignment, and they'll be breaking down the
multiplex door while waving fistfuls of money.  That's the lesson you can
cull from the last few years, which has seen more than a few classic works
of literature turned into films geared toward teenagers.  Kids don't want to
read "Pygmalion" - they want to see She's All That.  I've seen 16-year-olds
visibly cringe upon hearing Jane Austen's name, but they'll watch Clueless
every time it's on cable.  They can't stand Shakespeare but think 10 Things
I Hate About You is a frigging riot.
The latest transformation from neglected classic to teenage tripe is Get
Over It, a high-school take on Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
The thing that separates Get Over It from its ilk is the presence of the
original work within the story, although in the somewhat unconventional form
of a school musical.  In fact, there's more that a few musical numbers in
the film, most of them intentionally awful (I hope - they were written by
South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut's Mark Shaiman), starting with the
somewhat bizarre opening credits, where pop star Vitamin C lip-synchs The
Captain and Tennille's "Love Will Keep Us Together."
Get Over It's protagonist is Berke Lawrence (Ben Foster, Liberty Heights),an
integral part of his high school's basketball team along with best friends
Felix (Colin Hanks, Roswell) and Dennis (Sisqó.seriously).  Long story
short, Berke's girlfriend Allison (Melissa Sagemiller), who he has loved
since he was seven, has just kicked him to the curb and started dating an
arrogant new student and former British boy band member called Striker
(Shane West, Dracula 2000).  Berke is distraught and will resort to anything
to win Allison back (the film was originally called Getting Over Allison),
but his friends try to get him to divert his attention elsewhere.
Berke sees a big chance to get close to Allison in the school's musical
production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" but is a little too dumb to figure
out how to learn lines and stuff.  So he gets help from Felix's kid sister
Kelly (Kirsten Dunst, Bring It On), who, presumably, has had a crush on him
for years.  In case you couldn't see it coming, when the play is cast, Berke
plays Lysander, Kelly is Helena, Striker is Demetrius and Allison plays
Hermia.  And in case you aren't familiar with "Dream," this all means that
Berke is going to have a chance to get back with Allison, but opts to get
friendly with Kelly instead.
The story is a simple as they come, and without Shakespeare's prose, can't
come close to filling up a 90-minute film.  So how does Get Over It pad its
running time?  Mostly with a bunch of sight gags that have absolutely
nothing to do with the story.  It's junior-league Farrelly stuff, like a dog
who loves to hump things.  There are a few adult characters who are supposed
to help with the comedy but end up being nothing but annoying.  Ed Begley
Jr. and Swoosie Kurtz plays Berke's seemingly normal parents, but they're
also co-hosts of a television relationship show (cue embarrassing on-air
moment).  Worst of all is Martin Short, who plays the clueless director of
the high school play with about a tenth of the vigor of Corky St. Clair in
Waiting for Guffman.
Get Over It was directed by Tommy O'Haver (Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss) -
the man responsible for (unknowingly, I hope) unleashing the untalented
force known as Sean Hayes on the world.  There wasn't much to Billy's, but
it was visually appealing; a talent O'Haver seems to have misplaced.  The
script was written by R. Lee Fleming Jr., who wrote She's All That (and
didn't star in Full Metal Jacket).  Of the young acting talent, only Dunst
is a standout.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be enough films like
The Virgin Suicides for someone of her age and talent to tackle, leaving
only claptrap like this available.

Review for Gojitmal (1999)
Somewhere between hardcore and softcore pornography lies  well, Lies, a
bold, button-pushing film from Jang Sun Woo, the reigning bad boy of
Korean cinema.  His latest is about the sadomasochistic relationship
between a high school virgin and her older lover.  The film is based on
Jung-Il Chang's novel (adapted by Jang), which has been banned in Korea.
Lies would have been creepy enough left to its own devices, but Jang
uses a bunch of interesting cinematic techniques to make the film look
and feel like a documentary about defiling a naďve girl.  Both principal
actors are making their screen debuts, and their characters are only
known by their first initials.  Lies contains documentary-style
interviews with both actors, and each provides narration throughout
portions of the film.
Tae Yeon Kim plays Y, an 18-year-old high school virgin who wants to get
laid before her graduation.  Through her best friend Woori (Hye Jin
Jeon), she is introduced to a 38-year-old artist named J (Sang Hyun
Lee).  Woori is in love with J and his art, but she's too embarrassed to
make advances toward the married sculptor.  Instead, Woori makes her
friend call J, and she finds herself living vicariously through the
colorful acts of phone sex that Y has with J.
Y and J eventually agree to meet in person, and the two perform every
carnal act imaginable.  Lies pulls no punches here, showing it all as Y
is violated in every orifice.  Jang even uses some clever title cards to
announce which cavity J is about to fill (`The First Hole,' `The Second
Hole,' and so forth).
The dialogue isn't any less crass than the visuals.  J rudely
announces,  `I'm going in,' before invading one of Y's nooks.  When he's
trying to get her backside to loosen up, he advises her to `think of my
dick as shit  that'll make it easier.'  He also paws at her private
parts like a monkey looking for bugs.
Strangely, Y seems game for everything, cooing, `I like anything that J
does' to the enraptured Woori.  When J introduces beatings to their
sexual routine, she still doesn't freak out, claiming, `My ass is
killing me, but this is great!'  The whippings increase in severity, and
it isn't long before Y's brother (Kwon Taek Han) begins to get
suspicious about her sister's violent older lover.
Lies is disturbing cinema at either its best or worst form, depending on
where you stand on the issue of perversity in modern cinema.  It's great
that Jang was able to produce such an unflinching look at the bizarre
sexual relationship between two obviously unstable people, but other
than raising both eyebrows and trousers, I'm not too sure what his point
was.

Review for Ride with the Devil (1999/I)

Question:  What do you get when you blend Gone with the Wind and Glory?
Answer #1:  The cinematic equivalent of Viagra for your excitable high
school history teacher that still spends his weekends reenacting the
battles of the Civil War with other middle-age losers/fanatics.
Answer #2:  Ride with the Devil, a movie about the Civil War made by a

A Taiwanese filmmaker?  Making a Civil War picture?  Why, that sounds as
preposterous as Spaniard Antonio Banderas directing a film about 1965
Alabama!  But Ang Lee is no ordinary filmmaker.  His resume is nearly as
diverse as indie icon John Sayles, knocking out movies about the frocky
(Sense and Sensibility), retro sex (The Ice Storm), cultural contrast
(Pushing Hands), the love of food (Eat Drink Man Woman) and taboo
relationships (The Wedding Banquet).
Although Ride with the Devil is a remarkably beautiful film, it offers
nothing that we haven't already seen in Gone with the Wind and Glory.
It's also a balanced movie, meaning that war buffs will have to wait for
extended periods between battle scenes.  The ending is weak and the film
is not nearly emotional as it could be.  Yet, somehow, Devil is still
entertainingly captivating.
Based on Daniel Woodrell's novel `Woe to Live On,' the film focuses on
one Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire, Pleasantville), the son of a pro-Union
German immigrant transplanted in Missouri.  Like other Southern boys,
Jake is eager to bear arms in order to maintain their Southern way of
life.  Jake and his best friend Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich, Chill
Factor), the son of a wealthy plantation owner, join a rogue group of
Confederate fighters known as `Bushwhackers.'
Banded together with rich boy George Clyde (Simon Baker-Denny, L.A.
Confidential) and ex-slave Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright, Basquiat), Jake
and Jack Bull pull off a particularly savage raid of a group of the
Union soldiers believed to be responsible for the murder of Jack Bull's
father.  After the attack, the men lay low by holing up for the harsh
winter in what is essentially a cave, with a young widow named Sue Lee
Shelley (hippie songstress Jewel Kilcher) supplying their provisions.
Later, the fabulously endowed Ms. Kilcher has a provocative
breast-feeding scene that ranks as one of the best ever.
Adapted for the screen by The Ice Storm scribe James Schamus, Devil is a
hypnotic combination of love and war that also has a great sense of
humor.  Behind the scenes, Lee's production team creates some of the
more lush scenes of the cinematic year.  Devil's graphically violent
battle scenes are extremely well done, as is the portrayal of the
evolving friendship between Jake and Holt.  Neither is completely
trusted by their cohorts, continually having their loyalty questioned by
fellow Bushwackers despite their obvious devotion to the Southern
cause.  Holt (played in Oscar-worthy fashion by Wright) is somehow still
sympathetic to the Confederacy despite a life of slavery, while Jack is
seen as a German first and a Southerner second.  They are both victims
of ethnic intolerance.  And, yes, Spike Lee will probably blow a gasket
over the use of the dreaded `n' word.

Review for City of Angels (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
I went with low expectations and thoughts of a hokey Ghost rip-off, but
instead was treated to a stunningly beautiful picture.  Even as I sat
and watched it, I cringed and waited for the bottom to fall out, but it
didn't happen (at least until the last ten minutes).  There was no
`pottery-wheel' type scene, no cheesy promises about eternal love and
not one crappy Righteous Brothers warble.  Thank fucking Christ.
Since City of Angels is about a tall dark seraph (Nicolas Cage) that
falls in love with an attractive cardiovascular surgeon (Meg Ryan), you
can't really blame a guy for being weary of suffering through Ghost II.
What elevated Angels above the filth I expected was not only terrific
acting performances from the entire cast, but also top-notch technical
work as well.
Cage (ConAir) plays Seth, a worker angel responsible for helping the
newly departed move on to bigger and better places.  Like his
co-workers, Seth dresses in a long black coat (ala Face/Off's Caster
Troy), hangs out at the library (which oddly resembles the building
where Troy hides his Doomsday machine) and watches the sun rise and set
while standing on the beach.
After watching over a dying young girl in the County Hospital, Seth
finds his next assignment under the knife of the lovely Doctor Maggie
Smith (Ryan, Addicted to Love).  As the guy dies, the invisible Seth
stares deep into Maggie's pretty blue eyes (to match her O.R. scrubs)
and is shocked when she stares back and announces that she's not ready
for her patient to be taken yet.  Seth isn't sure if she really saw him,
but he is sure that Maggie is definitely worth a return visit.  Or two.
Hey, the guy does a lot of hospital work.
While Maggie wallows in self- doubt after losing the patient, Seth falls
head over heels.  He eventually makes himself visible to Maggie and the
two seemed headed toward everlasting bliss.  But, Seth is still an angel
 lacking in senses and incapable of emotion.  D'OH!
Seth struggles to decide whether to cast aside his eternal life to
become a real boy.  He gets help and advice from co-worker Cassiel
(Andre Braugher, Homicide) and another heart patient named Nathan
Messinger (Dennis Franz, NYPD Blue).  Meanwhile, Maggie tries to decide
which boy to chase  the mysterious unblinking Seth, or her live-in
doctor boyfriend.  A typical film would have made the boyfriend a
drunken lout, but this guy's only bad traits are being both boring and a
smoker.
Things proceed predictably toward the last reel, when Angels transforms
from a great film to a B movie.  The ending is so awfully written that
it's hard to actually feel anything for the characters.  Earlier scenes
were more successful in playing with my emotions.  In fact, there were
about three decent `cry' spots in the first fifteen minutes, but the
ending just made me want to get up and leave.  It wasn't fair to stick
it on the end of an otherwise flawless picture.
Ryan transcends her pixie-ish cuteness with one of her best performance
ever and Cage is perfectly cast as the confused angel.  Braugher seems
under used in his supporting role, while Franz shines as a spunky
scene-stealer.  Director Brad Silberling (Casper) has made an incredible
transformation from his previous effort and is undoubtedly aided by The
English Patient's Oscar winning team of Cinematographer John Seale and
Composer Gabriel Yared, as well was Production Designer Lilly Kilvert
(Strange Days).  Angels has a strikingly rich and stylish look and, like
most films today, vaunts a hip modern rock soundtrack.  But you should
still see it.  Did I mention that there was a vomiting scene?  Jesus,
what are you waiting for?

Title
Review for Joe the King (1999)
In yet another case of `Sundance Blues'  hype-heavy films bought for
big bucks at the famous January festival that fall flat upon theatrical
release  Frank Whaley's Joe the King is a stale coming-of-age story
that plays like a 70s Outsiders, only with rumbles replaced by roller
rinks.  Actor-turned-writer/director Whaley, probably best known as
Kevin Spacey's whipping boy in Swimming with Sharks, elicits good
performances from his actors, but his weak script is too much to
overcome.
The film opens in a blue-collar Upstate New York town with chain-smoking
nine-year-old Joe Henry (Peter Tambakis) reluctantly participating in
his school's `Career Day,' where students tell their classmates both
what job that they hope to have and what their parents' line of work
is.  Joe wants to be a crooner, just like the guys from his mom's record
collection.  He also tries to make up exciting jobs for his parents, but
the class reminds him that Joe's pop (Val Kilmer, At First Sight) is the
school's janitor, while his mother (Karen Young, Daylight) works in the
rug mill.
To make matters worse, when the girl in front of him says something
mean, Joe retaliates the only way he knows how  using the same violent
anger repeatedly taught to him by his drunk, abusive father.  Joe is
dragged to the front of the class by his teacher (Camryn Manheim, The
Practice), who rips his pants down and spanks him as his classmates
cackle.
Flash to five years later, where a teenaged Joe (Noah Fleiss, Josh and
S.A.M.) is malnourished and wears a dingy white tank-top, jeans and
Chuck Taylor sneakers.  Every adult that Joe comes in contact with is
owed money from Joe's now unemployed dad.  Joe is illegally working as a
dishwasher at a local restaurant, where he receives the majority of his
daily nutrients by eating discarded food from the plates he is about to
wash.  His school life is a mess, too, accumulating a whopping
fifty-four tardies in the academic year; and, predictably, he begins to
dabble in petty theft by shoplifting Ho-Hos.
As his relationship with his brother Mike (Max Ligosh, Hackers) becomes
stalled (he failed to back Mike up in a fight against the school
harelip), Joe's criminal offenses grow bigger and more daring.  Kilmer
even grunts a line at the end that pretty much sums up the film in one
line - `Stevie Wonder coulda seen that comin'.'  So could everybody in
the audience.
In Whaley's defense, the film does look pretty decent and, like most
actor-turned-directors, he extracts strong performances, especially from
the kids in the film.  Kilmer, who must gained about sixty pounds for
his role, finds himself in a role with slightly more screen time than
when he played Elvis in True Romance.  I think it was probably one of
those you-don't-have-a-chance-of-making-your-stupid-movie-unless-you-
get-a-big-star-in-it deals, so Whaley called in a favor from his
co-star from The Doors.  Ethan Hawke, Whaley's A Midnight Clear co-star,
also appears in the film as a guidance counselor.
Incredibly, Whaley's script shared the Waldo Screenwriting Award at this
year's Sundance Film Festival.  I think he shared it with Runaway
Bride.  If it's supposed to be autobiographical, or semi-autographical,
I guess you can't fault the guy for not wanting to alter what is
essentially the story of his youth.  But, at the same time, it doesn't
make the movie any more interesting.

Title
Review for Score, The (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The very thought of seeing three generations of great actors in the same
film, not to mention watching them play professional thieves, is enough to
make moviegoers salivate with anticipation.  But The Score, which stars
Marlon Brando (77), Robert DeNiro (57) and Edward Norton (32), offers little
more than a strange combination of heist-flick clichés and cop-flick
clichés. The tales of on-set feuds between director Frank Oz and Brando were
more exciting than anything that ended up in the final cut.  In other words,
this ain't no Rififi.
De Niro (15 Minutes) plays Nick Wells, an expert safecracker who owns a tiny
jazz club in Montreal.  He's a careful criminal, opting only for The Sure
Thing and never, ever dreaming of pulling off a job in his own backyard.
Nick is in a serious relationship with a flight attendant named Diane
(Angela Bassett, Supernova) and tells her he's about to hang up his tools of
the trade to be her full-time man.  But then his fence, Max Baron (Brando),
tells him about a job that could net him $2 million.   Nick's penchant for
low-risk crimes hasn't left him financially sound, and he sees this
opportunity as The Last Big Score before he rides off into the sunset with
Diane.
The trouble is that Max's job involves knocking over the Customs House in
Montreal to liberate an extremely valuable French scepter.  Nick is
immediately uninterested and becomes ever more put off when Jackie Teller
(Norton, Keeping the Faith), Max's man on the inside of the Customs House,
approaches him on the street in an attempt to lure him into the heist.  But
the power of the Almighty Dollar is too much for Nick to ignore, and he
signs on after receiving Jackie's assurances that Nick call the shots.
What follows is the same-old/same-old when it comes to films about
professional thieves.  They stake the place out.  They think of ways to
break into the safe.  But no matter how detailed their plan is, you know
something is always going to go wrong in this kind of cinematic situation.
The few things that broke the heist-film mold were easily the best parts of
The Score, like Nick's nerdy computer friend who tries to steal security
passwords with his questionable hacking skills.
I couldn't help but find The Score to be a twisted cross between Lethal
Weapon and every high-stakes theft film made in the last 25 years.  DeNiro
is the gruff Danny Glover, who is only a few days away from retirement and
doesn't want to blow his police pension, while Norton is the younger,
flashier Mel Gibson, shamelessly stealing scenes (he even plays a dual role
again, a la Aaron Stampler and Tyler Durden).  This is only his eighth film,
and he more than holds his own with Brando and DeNiro.
The film's screenwriters, Lem Dobbs (The Limey), Scott Marshall Smith (Men
of Honor) and Kario Salem (the story was concocted by Salem and Daniel E.
Taylor, TV's The Beast), try to make DeNiro's Nick unnecessarily
complicated, but he comes off as an aging sad-sack thief; the Willy Loman of
burglary.  Parts of the story work, but it's mostly a lot of unexciting
stuff they try to turn into full-on suspense.  I only approached the edge of
my seat once or twice.
You can't really blame the acting, aside from Bassett's wasted performance
and, possibly, the lack of scenes with Brando.  We're talking about four
people with 17 Oscar nominations (and four wins) between them.
Interestingly, Brando and DeNiro have played the same character (Vito
Corleone in The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II) but have never
appeared on screen together before.

Title
Review for Mumford (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The premise is simple:  Man moves to small Midwestern town that shares
his name, pretends to be a psychiatrist, and is actually able to offer
better advice than the burg's other two shrinks.  His patients are
quirky and their characters are well-developed and well-played by
capable actors.  Yet, somehow, the film really struggles to be even
mediocre.
Written and directed by Hollywood vet Lawrence Kasdan (French Kiss), who
has a long resume of overly praised middling pictures, Mumford stars
Loren Dean (Enemy of the State) as the fraudulent Dr. Mumford.  He chose
this particular town to set up shop simply because it happened to have
the name of the identity he had recently created to avoid a shady past.
In town for just a few months, Dr. Mumford has quickly become the mental
health M.D. of choice among the Mayberry-esque community, and begins to
take clients from the town's other two shrinks.
His patients are almost too quirky to believe.  The pharmacist (Pruitt
Taylor Vince, Murder One) has steamy sex fantasies straight out of a
Russ Meyer flick; a young bulimic goth chick (Zooey Deschanel) says
things just for shock value; the wife of a successful financier (Mary
McDonnell, 12 Angry Men) is a mail-order shopaholic; and a young lady -
and the doctor's obvious eventual love interest  suffers from a case of
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
The good doctor is also sought by Mumford's richest individual  a young
skateboarding techno wiz named Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee, Chasing Amy)
who created PandaModem, the town's largest employer and international
business that has nabbed 23% of the modem market's share.  He's worth 3
billion big ones, but would have traded all of it to make the varsity
baseball team.  Skip feels he needs psychiatric help, but doesn't want
to alarm either his stockholders or the townsfolk, who see PandaModem as
a necessity since the timber industry has recently dried up.  So he asks
Dr. Mumford to pretend to be his friend and dispense therapeutic advice
while tossing a football around.  Why would such a happy-go-lucky guy
need mental help?  He's building a synthetic sexual surrogate/companion
(read: sex doll) and is afraid that his latest venture could be wrong
and dirty.
Things proceed as planned for Dr. Mumford until he tosses new patient
and slimy local defense attorney Lionel Dillard (Martin Short) out of a
session for being too irritating.  Dillard turns to Mumford's other two
legit shrinks - Dr. Ernest Delbanco (David Paymer, Payback) and Dr.
Phyllis Sheeler (Jane Adams, Happiness)  and suggests that Dr. Mumford
may be an uneducated impostor, which leads to an investigation and
eventual outing.
Mumford offers precious little that you wouldn't already expect prior to
walking into the theater.  There is only one real stand-out scene  a
great grainy flashback to his previous life and past jobs.  Dean is
merely adequate - his baked-bean teeth are disturbing and distracting.
Lee is totally wasted in a role where he can't curse, able to only
either mutter `far out' or repeat someone else's line in question form.
The supporting players make the film.  Barely.  (1:51 - R for
sex-related images, language and drug content)

Title
Review for Along Came a Spider (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Let's say you love films where cops chase super-intelligent criminals but
skipped Hannibal because of the unnecessary gore.  Along comes Along Came a
Spider to quench your insatiable thirst for that particular genre.  The
trouble is that the genre has been rubbed into the ground, leaving Spider a
silly, clichéd disappointment.  The only thing startling about the film's
well-telegraphed "surprises" is how incredibly predictable they are,
especially if you've seen Kiss the Girls, which, like Spider, was based on a
James Patterson novel and stars Morgan Freeman as the same protagonist
detective (he's this film's executive producer, as well).
First things first.  Spider was the first of six novels Patterson wrote that
feature Dr. Alex Cross as a main character.  Kiss was the second book, which
technically makes Spider a prequel (the film never addresses this
meaningless point).  The parallels between the two films are staggering,
making Spider seem almost like a remake of Girls.  The crimes are similar,
the criminals are similar, and the twist at the end is, well, just about
identical.
This time around, Cross is on the trail of a madman who has kidnapped the
daughter of a U.S. Senator (a la Silence of the Lambs) from an
ultra-exclusive D.C. school complete with a limousine drop-off area, giant
flat-screen monitors on every desk and a gaggle of Secret Service agents to
protect the students.  The madman - one Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott, Before
Night Falls) - poses as a teacher (complete with instantly suspicious makeup
and prosthetics) for two years and makes off with little Megan Rose (Mika
Boorem, The Patriot) right under the noses of the agents hired to keep an
eye on her.
Cross (Freeman, Nurse Betty), who has been off the job for eight months
following the death of his partner, is dragged into the manhunt by Soneji,
who feels Cross is the only person intelligent enough to accurately convey
his own genius to the media.  Soneji calls Cross at home, using one of those
voice-altering devices to make his voice lower (like Wincott's already
gravelly voice needs to be lower - it's less intelligible than Brad Pitt in
Snatch), and, before you know it, it's off to the cliché races.  The only
one Spider doesn't use is the one where the killer jumps up after you think
he/she is dead.  They even crib the phone booth scavenger hunt scene from
Die Hard With a Vengeance.
Soneji purposely leaves a trail of clues that only Cross can decode, despite
the presence of hundreds of specially trained Federal agents (it's almost as
lame as Denzel Washington doing the same thing from a hospital bed in The
Bone Collector).  You know it won't be long before Cross is taking a mere
ten seconds to correctly guess an important computer password, and be
prepared to hear lines like "I think he's trying to tell us something," or
"He's playing some kind of game."  Holy déjŕ vu, Batman.  Freeman can keep
saying the same lines until he's blue in the face, but he'll never be as
cool as his Detective William Somerset in Se7en.
Head Over Heels' Monica Potter plays Jezzie Flannigan, the remorseful
Special Agent who was assigned to protect Megan, and she buddies up with
Cross to help find Soneji (the film jettisons the romance the two characters
share).  Potter has never looked and sounded more like Julia Roberts than
she does here, but considering the fact you can't spit without hitting a
photograph or print story about Roberts, it's almost refreshing.  Jay O.
Sanders is the only other recurring character from the first film.
Spider was directed by Lee Tamahori (The Edge) and adapted from Patterson's
novel by first-timer Marc Moss.  While I was glad the running time was kept
in check (it only seemed like two-plus hours), I secretly wished the film
contained a lot more forensic hokum.  Worst of all is Jerry Goldsmith's
(Hollow Man) score, which is about as grating as a shouting match between
Fran Drescher and Janice from Friends.

Title
Review for Josie and the Pussycats (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The good news is that Josie and the Pussycats isn't nearly as bad as fellow
comic-book-to-film duds Dudley Do-right or The Flintstones.  The bad news is
that the producers chose to target the pre-pubescent girl market instead of
the horny, single, thirty-something guy demographic.  We...I mean they are
the ones who made the show popular as they dreamed of marrying Josie and
having cute little cartoon babies with tails, so the film may seem like
somewhat of a betrayal to that particular sect.
Seriously.  In the Hanna-Barbera cartoon, the Pussycats wore leopard-skin
bodysuits, but they've been abandoned for more hip threads.  The cat ears
just aren't cute enough, although the low-cut tops kind of help.  Many
people don't realize the historical significance of the television show,
which, I think, was one of the first cartoons about a rock band to feature a
black character (the NAACP website doesn't keep track of stuff like that).
Although Valerie wasn't in the original comic book Pussycat lineup, she was
a trendsetter - a strong, smart black character added to the white mix some
25 years before prime-time network shows started doing the same.
The film, which is surprisingly funny, begins at an airport where the
world's hottest boy band is being mobbed by their squealing teenage fans as
they board their private jet.  DuJour (played by Seth Green, Alexander
Martin, Breckin Meyer and Donald Faison), which, I think, is French for
One-Hit Wonder, is managed by the sinister,
he'd-twirl-a-moustache-if-he-had-one record executive Wyatt Frame (Spy Kids'
Alan Cumming), who sees the boys are in their 14th minute of fame and
decides it's time to "replace" them with a newer, hipper band.
Enter The Pussycats, a struggling band from Riverdale (it was Midvale in the
comic, but who's counting) who perform to unenthusiastic bowlers at the
local alley.  Frame swoops in, signs the girls and takes them to the top of
the charts in just one week.  But the Pussycats don't realize Frame and his
equally diabolical boss, Fiona (Parker Posey, Best in Show), are inserting
subliminal messages into their songs.  The secret messages tell listeners,
among other things, that the Pussycats are the greatest band ever, that Diet
Coke is the new Pepsi One, and that Can't Hardy Wait was underrated (Harry
Elfont and Deborah Kaplan also wrote/directed that film).
The Pussycats are suspicious of their quick success but are easily
distracted by various things.  Drummer Melody Valentine (Tara Reid, Just
Visiting) is just too dumb to pay attention, bassist Valerie Brown (Rosario
Dawson, Down to You) is too concerned that she's not getting enough credit,
and Josie (Rachael Leigh Cook, Blow Dry) is too busy trying to get Alan M.
(Gabriel Mann, Outside Providence) to say that he loves her.
Josie is short on story but long on quick gags and inside jokes.  There's
the obligatory makeover scene once the girls get their record contract, and
it's as stylish as hell, thanks to Requiem For a Dream's cinematographer
Matthew Libatique.  There's a ton of pop culture references and appearances
from music movers and shakers like Serena Altschul, Reid's real-life
braintrust boyfriend Carson Daly, and a hysterical cameo from executive
producer Kenneth "Babyface" Adams.
The music is decent, with Letters to Cleo's Kay Hanley handling the lead
vocals while the three Pussycats provide the Linda McCartneyesque background
voices.  In the cartoon, Valerie played the tambourine, but effortlessly
switches to bass here.  She does well, looking as bored as a bass player
should.  The press notes make a big deal about the three women carefully
learning how to play their instruments to make the film look more real, but
I don't think I saw Reid hit the drums once.
Here's a quick thought about product placement in films, which is the most
evil thing this side of Scientology.  There's enough in Josie's first five
minutes to pay for it and two or three sequels, and that's just the tip of
the iceberg.  Films that make product placement integral to the plot (like
Mystery, Alaska) think they've found a way around being labeled as sellouts,
but their activity is completely shameful.  It would be just as easy to make
a picture with fictitious advertisers and salvage a few threads of integrity
(like Repo Man).  It's also odd to see a film about brainwashing, conformity
and product placement without any ads for The Gap.

Review for Love and Death on Long Island (1997)
Two time Academy Award nominee John Hurt (Midnight Express and The
Elephant Man) and two time Golden Globe nominee Jason Priestley (Beverly
Hills, 90210) have finally joined forces to make a film.  Given their
powerful fan base and undeniable charisma, it was certainly bound to
happen sooner or later.
Hurt plays Giles De'Ath (insert joke here), an uptight London recluse
who only communicates with a few snooty friends and his housekeeper.
One day, De'Ath locks himself out of his apartment during a thunderstorm
and, while waiting for a spare key to arrive, notices a billboard for
the latest film adaptation of a E.M. Forester novel.  To keep dry, he
goes to the local multiplex, but accidentally stumbles in to the theater
showing Hot Pants College 2.  Instead of being turned off by the
disgusting American filth, De'Ath finds himself strangely and
inexplicably transfixed to actor Ronnie Bostock (Priestley).
Unable to erase Bostock's image from his mind, De'Ath starts to collect
teenybopper magazines featuring his image.  He carefully clips the
photos and puts them into a scrapbook titled `Bostockiana'.  De'Ath also
buys tapes of Bostock's previous work, but has no TV or VCR to watch
them.  In a particularly funny scene, he takes a trip to the local
mega-appliance store and inadvertently mistakes a microwave for a
television before a bewildered employee.
The next `logical' step in his obsession is to travel to the sleepy Long
Island town where Bostock lives.  He befriends Bostock's live-in lover
(Fiona Loewi), who is impressed by De'Ath's remarkable knowledge of her
boyfriend's relatively unimpressive career.  The two finally meet in a
strange mismatch of age and culture.  Talk about an unconventional
story!
Writer/Director Richard Kwietniowski has certainly crafted an unusual
feature film debut.  He has given Hurt, who is probably best known for
having the Alien burst from his chest, his best role in years.  I was
going to say his strangest role in years, but then I remembered the
wealthy freak he played in Contact, which wasn't too long ago at all.
The perpetually sideburned Priestley, on the other hand, may or may not
be acting as the idiot American hunk.  His part must have been written
for him or some dolt just like him.
Love and Death garnered Kwietniowski a Golden Camera nominee (for
direction) at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and also won praise at the
Chicago International Film Festival.  It will probably find a larger
audience (and onto more screens) in Canada, where Priestley calls home.
I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the commercial during 90210.

Review for Sweet and Lowdown (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Woody Allen's (Celebrity) latest is a fictional account of a 1930s jazz
guitarist named Emmett Ray (Sean Penn, The Thin Red Line).  The film is
a sugary homage to the music of that period (a fave of Allen) and
features fantastic performances from an ensemble cast.
The film is shot to look like somewhat of a documentary (so it feels a
bit like Zelig).   Allen skillfully blends accounts of Ray's life with
interviews from a panel of jazz aficionados, including himself, Ben
Duncan, syndicated columnist and author of The Jazz Life Nat Hentoff,
and filmmaker Douglas McGrath (Emma), who also co-wrote Allen's Bullets
Over Broadway.  We learn from these experts that Ray is cocky, abrasive
and brutally honest almost to a fault.  In other words, he thinks he
hung the moon, referring to himself as the world's second greatest jazz
guitar player  second only to Django Rhinehart, whom Ray calls a French
gypsy.  He actually idolizes Rhinehart, passing out the only two times
he laid eyes on the six-string legend.
A gifted instrumentalist with a blistering playing style, Ray works the
white clubs of Chicago with a white band before heading to the other
side of the tracks and jamming with black musicians.  He hangs out with
hobos and loves to watch trains and shoot rats at the dump.  Ray is also
a pimp, a kleptomaniac and a drunk, which, together with his prickly
demeanor, leaves the prodigy in many a pickle both with his career and
love life.
Things change when Ray meets a mute girl named Hattie (Samantha Morton,
Dreaming of Joseph Lees) that he is set up with as part of a double date
with a fellow musician.  Ray immediately dislikes the sweet Hattie and
treats her like a leper, but still he brags about his significance,
constantly reminding her that he is the world's second-best guitar
player, or one of the five best 9-ball players, or one of the top six
poker players ever.  Whatever the situation is (save one), he's the
best.  He begins a relationship with Hattie, but eventually dumps her
for the more glamorous Blanche (Uma Thurman, The Avengers).
Penn is fantastic as Ray  a great role for a great actor  but even he
is overshadowed by Morton's  wonderful, wordless performance as the mute
Hattie.  Allen's regular production team is back here to create yet
another top-notch picture with a lovely score from Dick Hyman.  One
change to the mix is the addition of cinematographer Fei Zhao (Raise the
Red Lantern) who, despite not being able to speak English, was able to
glowingly lense the film.  With this comedic effort, Allen yet again
proves that he is one of the most creative writer/directors in the
world.

Review for Thirteen Days (2000)
In October 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union had a staring
contest that is commonly referred to as The Cuban Missile Crisis.
Everyone knows the story  the Soviets put nukes in Cuba, President
Kennedy furrowed his brow and orchestrated a sea blockade of the island,
then the missiles were dismantled and sent back to Red soil.  The event
is referred to as a "crisis" because the two countries nearly wound up
in a nuclear arm-wrestling match, but, thankfully, cooler heads
prevailed.
The Crisis serves as the subject for Thirteen Days, the new $80-million,
two-and-a-half-hour film that features Kevin Costner as John F.
Kennedy's influential political advisor, Kenny O'Donnell.  Like the real
O'Donnell, who became an alcoholic after Kennedy was assassinated
following The Crisis, Costner (For Love of the Game) sports a thick
Boston accent that turns words like "Cuba" into `Q-ber.'  One of the
members of `The Irish Mafia' that rode Kennedy's coattails to
Washington, O'Donnell had a loving wife (played by Remember the Titans'
Lucinda Jenney) and five good-looking kids  a point Days doesn't let
you forget.
Using a generous amount of stock footage and black-and-white clips
(which makes Days' director Roger Donaldson look like a third-rate
Oliver Stone), the film does a decent job recreating the tension that
ran through the White House when surveillance photos revealed the
delivery of the Russian nukes to Cuba.  The missiles, which wouldn't be
operable for a couple of weeks, would be capable of striking any target
in the continental United States.
President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood, Rules of Engagement), his brother
and the U.S. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy (Steven Culp), and a gaggle
of others had to decide how to handle the situation.  Too much force
would cause the Soviets to invade Berlin, and too little could lead to a
decisive Russian first strike.  The decision boiled down to a military
strike and Cuban invasion, or a blockade that would prevent an incoming
fleet of ships from delivering more weapons to the tiny island.
This debate grows incredibly tiresome during the film, although,
surprisingly, it only consumes the first half of Days.  Most people
think The Crisis ended when the Russians blinked and turned their ships
around, but recently declassified information gives Days enough content
to stretch itself out for another 75 minutes.  Since this part of the
story isn't as well known, I'll leave out the gritty details.  It's
interesting and all, but it didn't need to be anywhere near this long.
Costner, who also produced the film (which may explain the ungodly
running time), does an admirable job with his accent, although his role
doesn't really offer much else to get excited about.  Greenwood's JFK
looks eerily like a dark-haired David Caruso and spends almost all of
his time gritting his teeth and staring out the windows of the White
House (watching for Marilyn's car, no doubt).  Culp, who played Bobby
Kennedy in HBO's Norma Jean & Marilyn, sounds just like Richie
Cunningham, while Dylan Baker (The Cell) turns in another strong
performance as Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.
Director Donaldson (Dante's Peak), a coworker with Costner in 1987's No
Way Out, does a horrible job of keeping the film interesting.  Everybody
knows how the first half of the film is going to shake out, and
everybody also knows how it's going to end.  There is no reason
Donaldson needed to keep Days this long, other than making the film's
length seem more Oscarworthy.  His continual use of nuclear weapon
detonation throughout the film (as a `what if' scenario) and the
inclusion of O'Donnell's family life is clumsy and calculated.
Days was written by David Self (The Haunting), who based his script on a
book called `The Kennedy Tapes - Inside the White House During the Cuban
Missile Crisis," which was written by Ernest R. May and Philip D.
Zelikow.  There are a bunch of scenes in the film that are supposed to
be dramatic but end up being corny (one even features Chip Esten from
the comedy improv television show Whose Line is it Anyway?).  And Days
uses the term `rules of engagement' about a dozen times, so it almost
seems like the script is rubbing the failure of Greenwood's last project
in his face.

Review for Beach, The (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
If you've seen the trailer for The Beach, you may think that you have a
pretty good idea what the film is about.  Pretty American boy and pretty
French girl find a secluded desert island paradise, then roll around in
the sand and screw their brains out until some really mean guys find the
island and everything gets really scary.  That's what I got out of it,
anyway.
To call the trailer `misleading' would be a bit of an understatement.
Sure, there is still a secluded desert island paradise, and the boy and
girl are still pretty, but everything else happens quite differently.
Does it matter?  Hell, no.  This is, more than anything, a Leonardo
DiCaprio film.  The fact that he is shirtless for the majority of the
film is enough to guarantee that teenage girls throughout the country
will pry their eyes away from Total Request Live long enough to beg
their parents to get them into this R-rated film.
DiCaprio (Titanic) plays Richard, an American vacationing in Bangkok
that decides he's tired of doing the same thing as the other tourists in
Thailand.  Dude, when was the last time an American went to Thailand and
didn't have a harrowing experience?  The only person that ever had a
successful cinematic voyage to this southeast Asian country is Anna
Leonowens.  And she had to sing and hang around a gaggle of kids.  Just
go to the tourist traps, get VD, go home and get a shot.  Or better yet,
vacation only within your own country where, unless your last name
happens to be Griswold, everything is safer.
The Beach begins with a very Se7en-ish opening shot (cinematographer
Darius Khondji also worked on that film) showing Richard arriving in
Bangkok.  Although the city is referred to as `Good Time City,' Richard
explains (through a sometimes annoying voice-over) that he is easily
bored with the scene, which basically consists of spoiled kids looking
for a fresh location to toke up and the natives that try to take
advantage of their fat wallets and perpetual high.
In his one-star hotel, Richard meets the people staying on either side
of him.  There's Étienne (Guillaume Canet, In All Innocence) and
Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen, A Single Girl), the sex-crazed French
couple.  And then there's Daffy (Robert Carlyle, Angela's Ashes), a
deranged Scotsman that tells Richard about a secluded desert island
paradise of crystal-clear water, pure white sand, waterfalls and
never-ending fields of pot, just before offing himself because he can't
get the place out of his head.  There's Sign #2  don't go to the
island, Richard.
Of course, Richard goes to the island with Étienne and Françoise, thanks
to a map that Daffy left for him before he did himself in.  It takes a
while to get there, but when they do, the trio find the island every bit
as beautiful as they imagined, but it's also inhabited by a flock of
gun-toting Thai pot farmers, as well as a commune of hippies on
permanent vacation.  They are welcomed by the members of the beach
community, yet despite the perfect surroundings, Richard still seems
sullen, just because he wants to nail Françoise.
Before you know it, you're over an hour into the film and no clear
protagonist has been established.  Is it the shark that tries to gnaw on
unsuspecting swimmers?  Nope.  Is it the shifty-eyed boyfriend of the
group's leader?  Nope.  It's more of a destruction-from-within/Lord of
the Flies deal.  And that's not the only theme borrowed from other
works.  The Beach is chock full of references to American films about
the Vietnam War, Nintendo games and Looney Tunes characters.  It would
have been easy to imagine Richard turning into Marlon Brando in
Apocalypse Now, even without using clips from that film here.
The Beach is based on Alex Garland's wildly popular novel of the same
name  it's been called the first great book for the Generation X crowd
 and was made by the folks that brought you the wonderful Ewan McGregor
trifecta of Shallow Grave, Trainspotting and A Life Less Ordinary
(director Danny Boyle, screenwriter John Hodge and producer Andrew
Macdonald).  Those of you that read the book might be wondering, among
other things, why Ewan wasn't cast as Richard in the film, since the
character was a Brit in the novel.  Beats me; I'm wondering the same
thing.
>From what I understand, the novel offered a gruesome bloodbath for its
ending, but the closing reel of the film is a bit anti-climatic and
leaves a lot of issues unresolved.  Go figure  when was the last time a
movie didn't do the book justice?  In the filmmakers' defense, they did
not exploit the relationship between Richard and Françoise.  Though they
never `hooked up' in the book, Hodge's script offers a surprisingly
refreshing lack of romance between the nubile youngsters.
DiCaprio is solid as usual, Ledoyen does her job by looking fantastic in
a bikini, and Carlyle does the crazy thing as well as anyone in film
today.  If nothing else, The Beach looks and sounds fantastic.  Khondji
(Evita) and scoremeister Angelo Badalementi (The Straight Story) are
more responsible for effectively setting the tone of the film than the
script or acting.  Filmed on the Thai island Phi Phi Leh, The Beach
might be gorgeous enough to overcome any problems that you may have with
the script.

Review for Judy Berlin (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Try if you wish, but Judy Berlin can't be pigeonholed into any
particular genre.  From a summary of the script, you might think the
film is another searing indictment of suburban life (a la American
Beauty).  A glimpse at the cast may have you believing that Berlin is a
Broadway play rather than a feature film.  Look at the stills from the
black-and-white movie and you may assume that you're dealing with a
quirky art flick.  If you watch a scene or two, you might guess Berlin
is Woody Allen's annual offering.
But it's not Woody  it's Eric.  Mendelsohn, that is.  The first-timer
from Long Island wrote, directed and edited Berlin after working as an
assistant costume designer on a handful of Allen's pictures, whose
influence is unmistakable in Mendelsohn's writing and directing style.
Mendelsohn picked up the Director's Award at the 1999 Sundance Festival
for Berlin, which also garnered Independent Spirit Award nominations for
the stark cinematography (Jeffrey Seckendorf) and the amazing Barbara
Barrie (Suddenly Susan).
Berlin is set in Babylon, Long Island during the twenty-four-hour period
preceding and following a lengthy solar eclipse that seems to have its
way with time.  Thirty-year-old David Gold (Aaron Harnick, Barrie's
real-life son), a former resident, has returned to Babylon via
Tinseltown after a failed attempt at a filmmaking career.  The moody and
mopey David runs into a former high school crush named Judy Berlin (Edie
Falco, The Sopranos) who, ironically, is on her way to California to
become an actress.
Two years David's senior, Judy's acting experience has been limited to
cheesy local commercials and her recurring role as a settler in a nearby
historical village.  She tried to write a screenplay but just couldn't
get into plots, characters, or even spelling.  The two spend the day
catching up and reliving old childhood memories.
The film takes place on the second day of the school year, and the
eclipse has teachers and administrators acting goofy as well.  David's
father Arthur (Bob Dishy, Jungle2Jungle) is the principal and has a
thing for one of the instructors (Barrie), who, coincidentally, happens
to be Judy's mother.  Arthur's wandering eye is almost justifiable  his
wife Alice (the late Madeline Kahn, Cosby) is a recovering alcoholic
that just won't shut up.  There is also an ex-teacher with Alzheimer's
that wanders into her old classroom and disrupts the day.
Mendelsohn and the rich black-and-white film stock perfectly capture the
surreal feel of the eclipse.  From the opening shot of a train blowing
its whistle and signaling the suspension of time, Berlin plays like a
dream, with its characters acting in ways that seem to surprise even
themselves.  The harpsichord-heavy score from Michael Nichols is
reminiscent of Rushmore.  And Berlin's acting corps, which also counts
among its ranks Julie Kavner and Anne Meara, is fantastic.

Review for One Night at McCool's (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
So my grandson gives me passes to this new picture One Night at McCool's
because the free screening is the same night as that horrible show with
those poor prisoners trapped on the island who eat the bugs.  "Go," he says,
"it's just like Rush-o-Man."  Like I'm supposed to know what that means.
Honey, when you get to be my age, you don't want to rush anywhere (except
maybe the bathroom).
McCool's is a story about a very pretty girl who bewitches several men with
her good looks, but leaves each high and dry at the end.  The girl, who is
quite a simple actress, is played by the daughter of Arrowsmith guitar
player Joe Perry.  Jewel starts off by tricking a broke bartender named
Randy (played by Matt Damon) into thinking she was being raped in the alley
behind his bar.  But Jewel really just wants to lure him back to his house,
so she can call her boyfriend (Andrew Diceclay) in to rob the place.  At the
last second, Jewel decides she's in love with Randy and shoots her old
boyfriend in the head.
But there are other men in the story, too.  Most of McCool's is told with
flashback from three different men who each fall in love with Jewel.  In
addition to Randy, there's a lawyer named Carl, whose is played by Paul
Buchman.  He tells his story to a psychiatrist/country music star and we
learn that he likes to wear those pants where your rear end hangs out the
back.  Roseanne's husband plays the other man, a police officer who thinks
Jewel looks like his dead wife, godresthersole.  His flashbacks occur as he
tells them to a priest, who snacks on the body of Christ as he listens.
As if that wasn't enough excitement for one picture, Kirk Douglas plays a
bingo player that Randy hires to kill Jewel when she stops being nice to
him.  It's nice to see Kirk again, and he looked a lot younger than I
thought he would, and such a thick head of hair for a man his age.
Everything comes together at the end, which my grandson keeps reminding me
to tell you all is just a rip-off of True Romance.  There's a very funny
joke that involves a wooden Indian that's almost worth the price of
admission on its own.
I'll tell you what McCool's reminded me of - that time I went to Pearl's
house for dinner, and her goodfornothing son was watching that show The
X-Men Files, which I had never seen before.  But he wouldn't switch over to
Touched By An Angel, so I had no choice but to watch.  In the episode, the
two FBI people were on a mission in the deep south.  Agent Sculder was in
love with the local sheriff, but her partner thought he was a dumb rube (he
was played by Owen Wilson).  As viewers, we got to see the investigation
from the different viewpoints of both Agent Sculder and Agent Mully.  In
one, the sheriff was smart and charming, but in the other, he had rotten
teeth and was a moron.  It just goes to show you.
Back to McCool's now - I didn't care for all the sex and violence, but
thought the acting was pretty good.  Like I said, the main actress isn't
very talented, but all she had to do here was show off her boobs and bend
over a lot.  That's not too much to ask.  When the picture was over, it said
it was made in memory of Stan Seidel, who was the man who wrote the
screenplay.  One can only assume he died of embarrassment, because he wrote
one mean, sick story.  My grandson said the director person used to make
music video for the NTV, but it seemed like he had a hard time keeping
himself focused on things.  Maybe he was too busy staring at that girl's
boob, too.

Review for Jeepers Creepers (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
There's a lot to admire about Jeepers Creepers.  It's a horror film, but
it's packed with neither the hottest modern rock tracks nor acting talent
from any show on the WB.  It doesn't start with a pre-opening-credits
killing to whet your sick whistle, and there aren't any sex scenes
interrupted by a knife-wielding psycho.  That's enough to break the
conventional horror mold right there, but Creepers is actually somewhat
frightening, as well.
Instead of raiding the WB's casting closet, Creepers' producers turned to
two other networks from which to pluck their plucky leads.  Ed's Justin Long
and Boston Public's Gina Philips play Darryl and Trish, a brother and sister
who have chosen to take the back roads on their way home from college.  The
ride is full of good-natured ribbing and a time-passing license plate game,
but things take a turn for the worse when a creepy-looking truck with an
even creepier-sounding horn appears behind them and tries to run them off
the road before disappearing over the horizon.
Of course, that's not the end of Darryl and Trish's trip to the dark side.
Further down the road, they find an abandoned farmhouse with the beat-up
truck parked next to it.  As they slow down, the siblings see a dark figure
removing what appears to be corpses from the back of the truck and dropping
them down a sewer pipe protruding from the ground.  Like every other horror
film moron, the two decide to check things out, making themselves targets of
a man in black (whom we'll call Creepers, just because he doesn't really
have a name).
Creepers' first half is very promising, but then writer/director/child
molester Victor Salva (Powder) starts in with the typical horror clichés.
I'm talking about stuff like having the car run out of gas or refusing to
start at an inopportune moment - not the other stuff that's been "borrowed"
from other films, like self-mockery of the genre (a la Scream), bad stuff
happening at a secluded farmhouse (a la The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and
references to urban legends (a la, uh, Urban Legends).  Even the scenes
where Creepers tries to run Darryl and Trish off the road seems to be taken
right out of Duel, and the whole evil truck thing is done much better in the
upcoming Joy Ride.
One of the things that makes Joy Ride so enjoyable is the fact you never see
the bad guy.  Not here, though.  Creepers, who was frightening at the
beginning of the film, becomes pretty lame once you get a good look at him.
He's like the WWF version of evil.  Salva also inserts a completely
unnecessary psychic character (Patricia Belcher) into the action, just to
explain why Creepers is doing what he's doing, but it was a lot scarier when
we didn't know.
Still, Creepers is the most original mainstream American horror film I've
seen in a while.  It's better B-movie horror than John Carpenter has made in
a long time, with a darker baddie and leads that genuinely appear terrified.
Creepers is certainly entertaining enough, but in this sequel-crazy world,
I'm almost hoping nobody goes to see it, just so there won't be a lame
Jeepers Creepers 2 out next Halloween.

Review for Just, Melvin: Just Evil (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The opening credits of Just, Melvin: Just Evil sound a bit like Law & Order,
or maybe The Jerry Springer Show.  You hear snippets of dialogue from people
complaining of incest, rape and murder, but in case that wasn't enough to
get your attention, the film's director announces that he lost his virginity
in the second grade...to his cousin.  That's when you realize this isn't
going to be a by-the-numbers documentary.
The director, James Ronald Whitney, turns the camera on his own family to
make his first film.  It's a painful, horrifying story of multi-generational
incest and abuse that started with Whitney's own grandfather, Melvin Just.
Melvin, we learn, was the second husband of Whitney's grandmother, and he
only married her to get access to the three young daughters she had from her
first marriage.  While Melvin didn't stick around for too long (he
ultimately moved on to a woman with even younger girls), he was able to
wreak enough havoc within this family to last for several decades.
If there's one good thing you could say about Melvin, it'd have to be that
he doesn't discriminate when it comes to incest.  Biological daughters and
stepdaughters - none of them are above a molesting or two.  And he doesn't
stop there, either.  Granddaughters...nieces...they're all fair game.  He
never lets age or physical handicaps get in his way either, fondling girls
as young as two, and one with a clubbed foot, to boot.
Just, Melvin is different from most documentaries in the sense that Whitney
has virtually unlimited access to the parties involved.  He also gets to
confront his grandfather after carefully and calmly building a case against
him to the audience.  This doesn't take place until you're an hour into the
film, and he doesn't back down.  The rest of the film deals with a possible
murder cover-up, in which Melvin was suspected of killing a social worker
who caught him diddling a youngster.
But the best parts of Just, Melvin are when Whitney interviews his obviously
traumatized but remarkably candid family, most of whom are alcoholic
(Grandma only weighs 73 pounds now, but still puts back a six-pack every
day) and either are or have been suicidal.  Most seem to live in campers or,
in one case, the back of a pickup truck.  Remember the documentary Paul
Buchman made about his family on Mad About You?  This is the polar opposite.
Whitney is an amateurish filmmaker, but Melvin is such a despicable and
unforgettable character, it barely matters.  The interviews with his family
members are broken up with clips of the former Chippendales dancer playing
his piano, competing on Star Search and other game shows.  It's clunky, but
doesn't lessen the story of this incredibly brave and honest family.

Review for Annihilation of Fish, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
It might sound like a very special episode of Barney Miller, but The
Annihilation of Fish is actually one of those romantic comedies that
features senior citizens doing the Metamucil mambo.  Ordinarily, the
idea of two old people in love is as nauseating as the prospect of a
Bush presidency, but Fish makes both its leads nuttier than a Snickers
bar, and, as a result, the film is entertaining rather than sickening
and sappy.
Fish takes place in a Los Angeles boarding house, where two elderly
crackpots rent upstairs apartments.  Obidiah "Fish" Johnson (James Earl
Jones) is a retired Jamaican janitor who has recently been released from
an institution.  He seems like a normal guy, except when a demon named
Hank appears from time to time to stir up trouble.  The flesh-and-bone
Fish and the invisible Hank go toe-to-toe in numerous unannounced
wrestling matches, which, of course, make everybody else think Fish is
off his nut.
Poinsettia Cummings (Lynn Redgrave) lives across the hall from Fish, and
her quirk (other than being a fall-down drunk) is that she thinks she's
in a relationship with deceased opera legend Puccini.  Fish and
Poinsettia don't have much to do with each other as the film opens, but
he begins to help her stumble into her apartment after a night of
drinking with Puccini.  They start drinking tea and playing rummy
together, and Poinsettia even begins to referee the wrestling matches
between Fish and Hank.  Before long, they're doing the Unthinkable Act.
But as they grow closer, Hank becomes upset that Fish is banging the
referee, and Fish is forced to choose between the invisible demon who
kicks him in the crotch or the daffy woman that puts out.  And if that
doesn't sound wacky enough, the lady who owns the boarding house (played
by real-life kook Margot Kidder) spends her days adding letters to her
last name and growing a giant weed in her garden to piss off her dead
husband.
Directed by Charles Burnett (The Glass Shield), Fish is a guaranteed
crowd-pleaser, no doubt due to the fine performances from Jones (other
than his poor accent) and Redgrave.  The film is oddly heartwarming,
while similar films about unlikely lovers that aren't young and
beautiful and perfect (like the deplorable The Other Sister) are nothing
but crap. Fish has been bouncing around film festivals for nearly two
years, but, based on the crowd reaction it's received, deserves a nice
distribution deal so it can be seen by a wider audience.

Review for American Outlaws (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Now that Town & Country has finally come and gone after dozens of postponed
opening dates, the biggest laughingstocks on the constantly changing film
release schedule are a dueling pair of westerns - Texas Rangers and American
Outlaws - that have been playing chicken on the calendar for most of 2001.
Rangers, which is apparently so problematic its release has been delayed for
nearly 18 months, offers a star in Dawson's Creek's James Van Der Beek
(although one can only imagine the time and materials involved in fashioning
a cowboy hat to fit over his massive cranium).
On the other hand, Outlaws is essentially Young Guns 3 without the marquee
monikers. The most recognizable name, at least as far as the protagonists
go, is Scott Caan, and the only reason you know him is because of his dad.
Strangely enough, the film's biggest star is somebody moviegoers may have
heard tell of but most have never seen.  And now that I've finally seen
Tigerland's Colin Farrell in action, I'm wondering what the big deal is.
Outlaws is yet another take on the lives of Jesse James and his band of
merry men.  It's the same movie you've seen again and again, but with a
younger cast with which to extract money from a new generation, and it's
probably historically inaccurate enough to give American History teachers a
cardiac episode or two.  Instead of trying to be like Tombstone and Ride
With the Devil, it's more like The Newton Boys and Wild Wild West.
The film opens during the tail end of the Civil War as we are introduced to
a handful of Quantrill's Rangers, a guerilla outfit that skirmishes with the
dastardly Union soldiers (a la Devil's Missouri Irregulars).  Leader Jesse
James (Farrell), his sharp-shooting brother Frank (Gabriel Macht, Simply
Irresistible) and cousins Cole (Caan, Gone in 60 Seconds) and Bob (Will
McCormack) Younger all show they're quick on their feet as they drive those
darn Bluecoats into a retreat.  And they've even got a minority sidekick
(Nathaniel Arcand), just like Guns' Lou Diamond Phillips, or Jeffrey Wright
in Devil.
When they return home to Missouri, the boys learn the railroad company (led
by The X-Files Terry O'Quinn and The Hurricane's Harris Yulin) is trying to
buy huge chunks of land on which to extend their tracks into the great
frontier.  If you don't sell your land, they try you for treason, hang you
and take it anyway.  And, wouldn't you know it, the James' homestead is
right in the way of the railroad.
So the boys start holding up banks and robbing trains, which somehow
prevents the railroad from being built.  What's more, they give the stolen
money back to the community, like some kind of redneck Robin Hoods.  And all
the while they're being pursued by Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton), a
super-duper detective who sounds a whole lot like another guy who used to
play Bond before Pierce Brosnan.
But it's not all fun and games.  There's jealousy within the gang, and a
growing potential for everyone to start turning on each other quicker than
the houseguests on Big Brother 2.  Jesse has to deal with his burgeoning
feelings for a doctor's piece-of-ass daughter (Ali Larter. Legally Blonde),
who's ripe for the pickin' even though she ain't kin.  And what would a
western be without people crashing through saloon windows (did this ever
actually happen in the Old West with the consistency it does in cinematic
westerns)?
I know what you're thinking - these boys all sound like Mensa candidates,
but a genius with a Southern accent is harder to find than a penguin at the
equator.  Most of these guys don't even bother with drawls (other than
Farrell's stab at covering up his Irish brogue).  The Native American has
more of a Southern accent than most of the white guys do.  And speaking of
voices sounding out of place, I thought I had mistakenly wandered into A
Knight's Tale when the R.L. Burnside song started blaring in the theatre.
It wasn't even a regular Burnside song, but rather one of the hip-hop
versions produced by Tim Rothrock.  The rest of the score is made up of
guitar-heavy crap courtesy of Yes' Trevor Rabin.
The quality of Outlaws should come as no surprise if you're at all familiar
with the previous work of director Les Mayfield (Blue Streak, Flubber), a
man who knows his shit when it comes to absolute mediocrity.  And let's not
forget the writers - Roderick Taylor has penned 11 made-for-television
movies, including The Gambler Part III, and John Rogers created TV's Jackie
Chan Adventures.  Those are some impressive filmographies from two men who
include enough foreshadowing in their script to shade the entire State of
Missouri.

Review for Legally Blonde (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Imagine a hybrid of Clueless, Felicity and Erin Brockovich, and you'll be
somewhere in the neighborhood of Legally Blonde, a surprisingly funny comedy
about a ditzy West Coast girl who tries to make a name for herself among the
blue bloods of the Northeast when she tackles an Ivy League school just
because the boy she likes is headed there.  Although the dialogue isn't
nearly as witty as Clueless, and nobody says anything like, "They're called
boobs, Ed," the film is filled with some great one-liners and a whole lot of
legal mumbo-jumbo mixed up with Valley Girl speak.
Reese Witherspoon (American Psycho) stars as Elle Woods, the Homecoming
Queen of CULA and the Sorority President of Delta Nu.  Elle is the kind of
girl who dresses in pink and makes irritating noises like a little dog when
she cries (and even owns one of those dogs, too), which we get to hear when
her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis, Pearl Harbor), dumps
her at a fancy restaurant - not because he doesn't care for her, but because
he's an aspiring politician who wants "a Jackie, not a Marilyn."
Elle, who thought Warner was going to propose to her, is crushed and decides
to show him that she isn't just a bubblehead by applying to Harvard Law
School, which is where he is headed in the fall.  After struggling through
the LSATs (which she previously thought was a rash on the hey-nanny-nanny),
Elle heads east, but quickly discovers her uphill ascent has only just
begun.  She's kicked out of class by a sadistic professor (Holland Taylor,
The Practice), laughed at by her fellow students, and, worst of all, finds
out Warner is engaged to an ice princess named Vivian Kensington (Selma
Blair, Down to You).
Things proceed fairly predictably, with Elle making the successful
transition from BHOC (Big Hair on Campus) to a promising legal mind with a
bright future.  She gains the respect of her classmates and even befriends a
homely trailer park queen (Jennifer Coolidge, Best in Show), giving her tips
on handling men.  And, of course, Elle gets a love interest in a character
named Emmett (Luke Wilson, Charlie's Angels).  We don't know who Emmett is
or why he's hanging around the law school until the film is two-thirds over,
but it's pretty clear that he's Noel to Warner's Ben.
Witherspoon is perfectly cast, and without her special brand of clueless
determination, Blonde would have been much, much worse.  This might sound
ridiculous, but it's the year's second-strongest female performance, after
Renée Zellweger in Bridget Jones's Diary.  Even more ridiculous, Blonde and
Diary even share a similar scene in which the main character shows up at
social event skimpily dressed as a bunny, even though it's not a costume
party.
Blair does well, even though she's practically Linda Fiorentino at this
point, and manages to keep her lips off her female co-stars (unlike the last
time she starred with Witherspoon).  There are also bit parts from Titanic's
Victor Garber, Raquel Welch, Anthony Perkins' son, Final Destination's Ali
Larter and a nearly unrecognizable Linda Cardellini from TV's Freaks and
Geeks.
Blonde's script (which, shockingly, is based on a novel by Amanda Brown) was
written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, who also penned the
underrated comedy 10 Things I Hate About You.  The film is the directorial
debut of Robert Luketic, who scored a festival hit with his short titled
Titsiana Booberini.  Aside from a Toni Basil-choreographed dance scene
(which is easily the worst part of the film), things stay pretty well-paced
and enjoyable throughout.

Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
This randy and crass sequel to AP: International Man of Mystery is more
like the gag-fest There's Something About Mary than its predecessor.
Laden with a ballast of delicious bathroom humor (a long-time Sick-Boy
fave), AP:TSWSM opens with a fading scroll (a la Star Wars) explaining
the events from the first film  shaggy Powers (Mike Myers, Wayne's
World) was frozen in 1967 so that he could be thawed in the 90s to
fight the evil Dr. Evil (also Myers).
In the new film, the still-unfrozen Powers must travel back in time to
the psychedelic 60s to stop Evil, who has rocketed back to Earth in an
egg (a la Mork & Mindy) launched from the posterior of an intergalactic
Big Boy (one of several annoying product placement scenes), and
traverses time to steal a giant vial of `mojo' from a still-frozen
Powers.  `Mojo' is apparently is 60's version of Viagra, and is thusly
very important to our hero.
Some might find the story confusing, while others will point out the
obvious plot holes.  The filmmakers go out of their way to graciously
explain that they are not only aware of the script's obvious flaws, but
that they also don't care - and neither will you.  You'll be too busy
trying not to laugh up a vital organ.  The script (co-written by Myers
and friend Michael McCullers) concentrates more on gross-out humor than
the 60s spoofing featured in the prequel.  Director Jay Roach (upcoming
Mystery, Alaska) is also back at the helm for this film, which was
supposedly contrived of mostly improvisational material.
Reprising her part from the first film, Elizabeth Hurley (EdTV, My
Favorite Martian) delivers her least annoying role of the year as
Powers' bride Vanessa Kensington, but that probably had more to do with
her exploding in the film's first five minutes than her acting chops.
Fellow EdTV alum Clint Howard seems oddly out of place in a film not
directed by a relative.
Other holdovers include Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling, Idle Hands) and
Number 2 (Robert Wagner, Hart to Hart), who both play assistants to
Evil.  Seth Green (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is also back as Scott Evil,
the wonderfully cynical son of the doctor, who is highlighted in one
particularly funny scene  an episode of Jerry Springer featuring kids
whose parents have crazy plans of world domination.
The standout newcomer is, of course, the diminutive Verne Troyer (Men in
Black) who plays Mini-Me, a cloned version of Dr. Evil that is
approximately 1/8th the size (but all the evil) of the original.
Although he has no lines, Troyer steals every scene he's in.  But don't
overlook Rob Lowe (Tommy Boy), who plays a young Number 2 and does a
low-key but hysterical dead-on impression of Wagner.  Lowe actually had
a very small part in the first film, billed as `friend of security
guard.'
And don't forget the new AP babes - Heather Graham (Boogie Nights) is
CIA agent and Powers' love/lust interest Felicity Shagwell.  Kristen
Johnston (3rd Rock From the Sun) plays Evil's double-op, brunette model
Ivana Humpalot.  There's someone named Robin Swallows, too, but I was
doubled over at the waist when they were describing just who she was.
But the best new character has to be the disgusting, baby-eating Scot
called Fat Bastard (Myers again).  He weighs a metric ton and is
responsible for the most revolting bathroom scene since Trainspotting.
If that doesn't get you motivated to see the film, I don't know what
will.  (1:37 - PG-13 for sexual innuendo and crude humor)

Title
Review for Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved. 
It becomes clear almost immediately that Bridget Jones's Diary is going to 
be a chick version of High Fidelity, complete with narration from its main 
character, not to mention the fact that both films were based on popular 
British Gen-X novels (although Fidelity's Rob Gordon never had self-esteem 
problems quite as bad as Ms. Jones).  Behind the slick veneer of the 
narration, this is a fairly conventional and entirely predictable story - 
pretty much the same story, in fact, as the recently maligned Someone Like 
You, which was also based on a popular book.  Diary probably worked much 
better as a novel, as it doesn't translate nearly as well as Fidelity. 
Renée Zellweger (Nurse Betty) plays the titular Bridget Jones, a single, 
32-year-old, London publishing house employee who is afraid of either 
turning into Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction or being eaten by a pack of 
hungry dogs after dying a sad, lonely death in her flat.  Diary takes place 
over one year, between Christmases, and begins with her mother's (Gemma 
Jones, The Winslow Boy) annual holiday party/Bridget fix-up festival.  This 
year, Mom's potential future son-in-law is a smarmy barrister named Mark 
Darcy (Colin Firth, Shakespeare in Love).  Even though Darcy is an old 
friend of the family who has known Bridget for most of his life, sparks 
don't fly, and the two go their separate ways. 
In the meantime (and like Zellweger's first big film), Bridget keeps lusting 
after her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant, Small Time Crooks), and, after 
trading some suggestive e-mail, the two begin a torrid affair until, exactly 
at the halfway mark, the wheels fall off.  Despite watching her father's 
(Jim Broadbent, Topsy-Turvy) relationship with Mom crash and burn, Bridget 
has to pull herself together, and, among other things, find a new job and a 
new man before her biological clock explodes (cue Aretha Franklin's 
"Respect").  And all the while she keeps the audience updated on her weight 
and consumption of both alcohol and cigarettes, which are all things Bridget 
keeps track of in her diary. 
This isn't as accessible as The Full Monty or Four Weddings and a Funeral 
(which shares Diary's producers Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner), but the one 
thing that Diary has that those Best Picture nominees didn't is Zellweger. 
She looks incredible and her performance is even better (leaving me to ask 
"Julia who?" just two weeks after the Oscars).  Fans of Helen Fielding's 
novel (especially the British ones) raised holy hell when the skinny Texan 
was cast as Bridget, but after gaining a well-publicized 20 pounds and 
working undercover (and completely unnoticed) as a real British office 
drone, they should all be amazed at her performance.  Zellweger nails it, 
delivering what should be one of the year's best performances.  From her 
impeccable accent (which almost puts Gwyneth's to shame) to her uncanny 
knack for physical comedy, Zellweger is so likeable and fun to watch, it 
doesn't matter what happens in the film. 
Grant, who plays his second sleazebag in a row, is also very good, as well 
as wiry and chiseled.  Firth does well, and well he should do, as it's 
actually the second time he's played this part.  In Fielding's book, Bridget 
falls madly in love with the real-life Firth after watching him in Pride and 
Prejudice (where he played a character named Mr. Darcy), so his casting is a 
bit of an inside joke for the novel's readers. 
Diary is the feature-film directorial debut of documentary filmmaker Sharon 
Maguire (no relation to Jerry) and was adapted from Fielding's book by 
Andrew Davies and Notting Hill's Richard Curtis.  The film probably sets a 
record for the number of times the word "fuckwit" is used (a good thing) and 
its closing credits are sweet and memorable (so stick around)

Review for Muse, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Steven Phillips' career is at a crossroads.  Although the script writer
for seventeen films (including 1993 Oscar nominee McCormack Place) has
just won a humanitarian award, he has been told that he has `lost his
edge' by his friend, his agent and his studio  the latter strongly
suggesting that he be off Paramount property by 5:00.  So Steven does
what every other married, white, forty-something male does when they
have a mid-life crisiswell, actually he doesn't.  Most guys would
probably have an affair with some high-school-age bimbo, get caught and
lose half of their crap.
Instead, Steven (Albert Brooks, Mother) turns to friend and fellow
Hollywood screenwriter Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges, Arlington Road), who
reluctantly admits that his recent success has been due to working with
a muse.  For those of you that don't remember your Greek mythology, Zeus
had nine daughters that were responsible for all creativity.  Jack's
muse, Sarah (Sharon Stone, The Mighty), a direct descendant of the
original nine, has also worked wonders for other Tinseltown dignitaries
(male and female) and many make cameos in this film - James Cameron,
Lorenzo Lamas, Wolfgang Puck, Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese and Jennifer
Tilly, among others.
Jumping at the chance to revitalize his sagging professional life,
Steven is thrilled when Sarah tells him that she can begin working with
him immediately.  Mind you, she doesn't actually write for him or even
offer suggestions, but will supposedly make Steven more creative by
simply being near him.  Sarah also insists on having a suite at the Four
Seasons (on a high floor), a limousine, and a fridge stocked with
expensive health foods.
Initially trying to hide Sarah from his wife Laura (Andie MacDowell,
Just the Ticket), Steven eventually comes clean and tells his spouse
about the muse.  Any other woman might be suspicious of their husband
spending so much time with another lady, but Laura believes her
husband's honest intentions after witnessing Sarah make Steven fetch her
a Waldorf salad and bobby pins in the middle of the night.
Not happy with her posh surroundings at the Four Seasons, Sarah firmly
requests that she move into the Phillips' Pacific Palisades home, where
she works Steven's last nerve and motivates Laura to pursue a career in
cookie-making.  Oh, yeah  she also helps Steven come up with a great
screenplay that he tries to sell to Steven Spielberg.  Instead, in a
very funny scene, he ends up taking a meeting with Stan Spielberg
(comedian Steven Wright), a cousin of the Oscar winner.
The Muse is a comical success, with Brooks' dry delivery as potent as
ever (he also directed and co-wrote the film with the Oscar-nominated
Mother scribe Monica Johnson).  My only complaints are that Steven
believes in the muse way too easily and that his wife is too quick to
believe that he isn't putting the stones to Sarah.  But those are very
minor objections in a film this entertaining.  (1:37 - Rated PG-13 for
brief nudity)

Title
Review for I Dreamed of Africa (2000)
Agoraphobic Kim Basinger hasn't made a film since her Oscar-winning role
in L.A. Confidential.  For someone that's afraid to leave their house,
you might have expected her next project to be a low-key affair with
generic settings so as to accommodate her limiting illness.  This makes
Basinger's decision to tackle the lead role in I Dreamed of Africa ? a
film primarily shot in Africa ? such a surprise.  And Basinger is better
here that she was in Confidential, but, unfortunately, trying to equate
the two films would be like comparing apples andwell, dog crap.
Africa is based on Kuki Gallman's autobiographical novel of the same
name, and (kooky) Basinger plays the role of the author in the film.  As
the picture opens, we learn that Kuki is a well-to-do single mom living
in Venice with her mother (Eva Marie Saint, My Antonia) and
seven-year-old son Emanuele (Liam Aiken, Stepmom).  After being badly
injured in a car wreck, Kuki falls in love with and eventually marries
Paolo (Vincent Perez, The Crow: City of Angels) a victim of the same
crash.
Paolo is a thrill-seeker who dreams of one day returning to Kenya, where
years ago he worked on a cattle farm with his brother.  As a little
girl, Kuki's deceased father would regale the girl with stories of his
adventures on the Dark Continent.  So, logically, the two decide to pack
up and leave Venice for a place in the African wild called Ol Ari Nyiro
Ranch.
Of course, Kuki and Co. have problems fitting in, what with the
poachers, lion attacks, struggles with the natives and dangerous
snakes.  Their home is literally falling apart and, to make matters
worse, Paolo leaves for days on end to play safari with his new
friends.  Kuki spends her time worrying, fixing up the house, working in
the garden and, although they don't show it, tending to her hair, which
is always quite pleasant-looking despite adversity attacking from every
imaginable direction.
Africa was directed by Hugh Hudson (My Life So Far) and adapted from
Kuki's true story by Paula Milne (Mad Love) and Susan Shilladay (Legends
of the Fall).  The film depicts about ten years in the lives of Kuki and
her family, but they don't really experience anything that we haven't
already seen before.  And unlike, say Out of Africa, there is absolutely
no chemistry between Basinger and Perez (maybe Alec Baldwin had a rifle
cocked and pointed at Perez during filming?).  The scenery is well-shot,
but that and Basinger's performance aren't enough to salvage the film.
The problem with Africa is that the story never really goes anywhere.
It's kind of an unfocused mess, and ends up being a beautiful bore.
Okay, Africa is dangerous and full of deadly animals and unscrupulous
poachers - I get it.  But there's going to be adversity wherever you
live.  Africans don't have to deal with traffic, school shootings,
disgruntled day-traders or Republicans.  And they probably don't have to
hear about Elian Gonzalez, either.
Hey, Africa doesn't sound too bad right now.

Review for Jui kuen II (1994)
I'm not the kind of person that tries to push films that I enjoy on
people who don't have any interest in that particular cinematic genre.
Even though I loved it, I won't insist that a friend who hates tedious
science fiction films see 2001.  If you're a homophobe who hates foreign
cinema, I'm not going to needle you until you see Water Drops on Burning
Rocks.
The Legend of Drunken Master is a rare exception to my rule. Everybody
should see this film, even if you hate martial arts pictures. Master is
often referred to as the Citizen Kane of its genre, and its intoxicating
fight sequences are second to none  including The Matrix and the
upcoming Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
Jackie Chan (Shanghai Noon) stars as Wong Fei-hong, the rebellious son
of an important doctor during some nameless Chinese period.  As the film
opens, Fei-hong accidentally switches a package with somebody else on a
crowded train.  Instead of coming home with ginseng root for one of his
father's patients, he ends up with an ancient jade seal (a macguffin?).
The missing ginseng root becomes the source for many of the film's
laughs, while the seal lands Fei-hong and his whole family in a world of
trouble.
It turns out that the seal was supposed to be delivered to a devious
group of baddies who are helping a moustache-twirling Brit steal ancient
Chinese artifacts (read: cultural robbery).  Fei-hong becomes wrapped up
in their Machiavellian plot and finds himself on the receiving end of a
very large beating.
But Fei-hong is no slouch when it comes to fighting.  He embraces a
style of combat called `drunken boxing,' in which you stumble around
like you've just done a dozen shots of Jager and then, theoretically,
beat the snot out of your enemies.  In Master, drunken boxing works
better when you've actually consumed a bunch of alcohol.  Supposedly,
this style makes the body more relaxed and flexible, while it also
increases the body's pain threshold.  Unfortunately, his father (Lung
Ti, A Better Tomorrow) forbids both fighting and drinking, and Fei-hong
finds himself cast out after one particular binge of drunken battle.
Chan does a great job of pounding down alcohol like a Conehead and then
shouting out the names of each of his drunken moves as he performs
them.  The physical role is an obvious nod to Chan's hero, Buster
Keaton.  Like his other films, Chan performs all of his own stunts,
including a couple of amazing fight sequences in very tight quarters
(under a train and under a table).  One scene has him fending off an
entire army of ax-wielding henchmen, and the twenty-minute finale (which
took four months to film) is an incredible blend of Chan's unmatched
martial arts skills and fearless stunt work.
Master was released in Asia in 1994, and it has, unfortunately, been
dubbed into English for its American release.  Originally titled Drunken
Master 2, the film is actually a sequel to one of Chan's earlier films
released in 1979.  The character of Fei-hong is somewhat of a Paul
Bunyan-like legend in China, and the character has been portrayed in a
five film series called Once Upon a Time in China (Jet Li played the
role in the fourth film).
Another highlight is the performance of Anita Mui (Rumble in the Bronx),
who plays Fei-hong's hysterical stepmother (Chan appears to be older
than both actors portraying his parents).  Master is the fourth release
this month to have the main character(s) sing a song at some point
during the narrative (following Ladies Man, Remember the Titans and
Dancer in the Dark).
Master was directed by Chia-Liang Liu, who won the prestigious trophy
for Best Choreography at the Hong Kong Film Awards.  The film was
written by Kai-Chi Yun (A Chinese Ghost Story) and first-timer King-Sang
Tseng.  Like most of Chan's films, the closing credits contain outtakes
of stunts gone bad, which is a reminder of how amazing and effortless
they appear in the film.

Review for Tao of Steve, The (2000)
For starters, there isn't a character named Steve in The Tao of Steve.
The title refers to a less-than-spiritual way of trying to bed women who
wouldn't ordinarily give a guy the time of day.  The titular Steve isn't
one particular Steve, but rather a blend of cool Steves (like McQueen
and Austinbut definitely not Guttenburg).  Armed with a simple phrase
(`We pursue that which retreats from us'), the Tao's followers pride
themselves on their ability to score by simply acting uninterested in
scoring.
After a clever opening, where a book titled `The Tao of Steve' is shown
on a bookshelf beside Plato, Aquinas and Dante, we meet Dex (Donal
Logue, The Patriot), a chain-smoking, part-time kindergarten teacher who
rides a motorcycle like Steve McQueen in The Great Escape.  Dex is fat
like the Buddah which rests on the headboard of his bed and, between
breakfast bong hits, the fast-talking philosophizer maintains an affair
with his friend's wife.
Despite these qualities (or lack thereof), Dex is still able to
sweet-talk the ladies, as evidenced by his ten-year college reunion,
where he chats up a former classmate named Syd (Greer Goodman) and goes
home with a nubile student bartender (Dana Goodman).  But Dex can't seem
to shake the image of Syd, who is in town temporarily working as a set
designer for a Santa Fe opera production.   Before long, Dex is hanging
around Syd more and more, and the two even begin to carpool after his
motorcycle breaks down.
If you haven't figured out the plot yet, you may be a stroke victim.
Dex is a modern-day Don Giovanni who sleeps with thousands of women
because he's afraid he'll never find true love.  When he finds it in
Syd, Dex is forced to abandon his own beliefs and attitude toward the
opposite sex, turning himself into the lovesick loser that he used to
openly mock.
Steve is garnering heaps of critical praise, but that shouldn't be a
surprise to anyone.  Most film critics are lazy, self-centered
egomaniacs who aren't exactly beating off women with sticks (myself
included), so the idea of a slovenly know-it-all who can score with
chicks by not trying plays like the feel good film of the year (you can
use the same rationale to explain American Beauty's critical success
last year).  Logue, who won a Special Jury Award at this year's Sundance
Film Festival, is fantastic as Dex, but I sure hope he used a fake tummy
for his performance.
Visually, Steve features bright, vivid colors in the beautifully shot
(by Teodoro Maniaci, Smoke) interior and exterior Santa Fe scenes.  The
sky is always a perfect blue, and the sunsets are always amazing.  If
Steve were a bigger film, I'd almost expect Santa Fe's population to
double in the next year.  It looks that incredible.  If Steve's beauty
doesn't sell you on Santa Fe, maybe All the Pretty Horses will.  The
Billy Bob Thornton film, which was also shot in the New Mexico city,
will hit theatres at the end of this year.
Steve is the directorial debut of Jenniphr Goodman, who co-wrote the
screenplay with her sister Greer (the one who plays Syd) and Duncan
North.  If you look closely at the closing credits, they suggest the
film is based on North's life.  The film is well directed for a
first-timer, and the script is full of witty, intellectual banter that
made me wonder if people really talk like this.  At times, the
characters sound like they just stepped off the set of Dawson's Creek.

Review for Little Nicky (2000)
The Devil must have hired a new PR firm to spruce up his image here on
Earth. First, the Great Horned One took the form of a slinky, sexy
supermodel in Bedazzled, and here, in Little Nicky, Satan is portrayed
as a mild-mannered version of Hugh Hefner, right down to his velvet robe
monogrammed with a big `D.'
Little Nicky, like Bedazzled, is rated PG-13, hovers around the
90-minute mark and deals with a young man thrown into a
fish-out-of-water story.  Adam Sandler (Big Daddy) plays the titular
Nicky, one of three sons fathered by the Devil (Harvey Keitel, U-571).
Nicky is no bad ass, especially compared to his two older brothers,
Adrian (Rhys Ifans, The Replacements) and Cassius (Tiny Lister Jr., Next
Friday).  He might have turned out as evil as his siblings, but Nicky
was hit in the face with a shovel, leaving him with a sluggish brain and
a speech impediment that makes him sound like Renée Zellweger.
The gist of Nicky goes a little something like this: Satan is retiring
and needs to appoint one of his three sons to rule Hell for the next
10,000 years.  When he fails to make his choice, Adrian and Cassius get
pissed off and head for Earth, which, for some reason, blocks the gates
of Hell and causes the Devil to decompose faster than a leper in an
arm-wrestling contest.  The only thing that can save him from falling
completely apart is Nicky, who is instructed to find his brothers and
bring them back within a week.
On Earth, Nicky needs to constantly dress in warm clothes (a nice touch)
and experiences things like eating and sleeping for the first time in
his life.  He meets and falls for a nerdy, snaggle-toothed design
student named Valerie (Patricia Arquette, Bringing Out the Dead) and has
a great deal of difficulty tracking down his troublemaking brothers.
Part of Hollywood's fondness for Sandler is because his films gross well
while maintaining low budgets (aside from his salary).  Nicky is
probably the most expensive film he's made.  It's full of
computer-generated animation that seems as foreign to Sandler films as
comedy is to The Michael Richards Show.  And it appears they may have
saved some bucks by raiding the Hell set of Woody Allen's Deconstructing
Harry.
Nicky is also full of some wonderful cameo appearances from the likes of
Rodney Dangerfield, Reese Witherspoon, Ozzy Osbourne, Quentin Tarantino,
Dan Marino and a slew of former Saturday Night Live stars including Dana
Carvey, Kevin Nealon, Robert Smigel, Michael McKean, Jon Lovitz and Rob
Schneider  and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  Some recurring
characters from Sandler's previous films pop up, too.
Nicky's acting isn't anything to write home about, but that shouldn't
come as much of a surprise to anybody.  It's certainly funny, and may be
Sandler's most consistently funny film since Happy Gilmore  which I
consider to be one of the greatest comedies of the 90s.  His
performance here is paper-thin (like The Waterboy), and I'd much rather
see him play a normal Joe (like Big Daddy), but Nicky is entertaining
enough for that to be overlooked.  Tougher to ignore is the glaring
product placement of a certain fried chicken chain that is prominently
displayed in several scenes.
Nicky was directed by Steven Brill, who has acted in two of Sandler's
previous films.  As a director, his only feature film credit is the
kiddie pic Heavyweights, but Brill also penned the scripts for duds like
Ready to Rumble and The Mighty Ducks trilogy.  Like all of Sandler's
comedies, Nicky was co-written by Sandler and Tim Herlihy.  And don't
think about leaving the theatre early, or you'll miss the funny finale
in which you get to find out what happens to each of the characters.

Review for Deep Impact (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
It seems to work out pretty well, as long as you leave himbo Clooney off
of the big screen.  And let's not even get into the syllogism with
respect to movie titles:
Mercury Rising -> Deep Rising -> Deep Impact
All you need is something called Mercury Effect and you can toss in Zero
Effect and The Trigger Effect, too.  It sort of makes you long for
uniquely named films, like Schindler's Fist.
Despite the comparisons to similarly titled duds and the sky-high
expectations from its blue blood pedigree, pressure from the upcoming
Armageddon and $80 million budget, Deep Impact is surprisingly not like
a big summer event movie.  Though overly sappy and effect heavy, it
offers more than just the big gun, big explosion, big one-liner formula
that have been stinking up theaters summer after summer.
The premise is simple  an asteroid the size of New York City is headed
toward Earth, threatening global destruction and the eventual extinction
of all its inhabitants.  And no, the world isn't saved by an Apple
PowerBook or Slim Whitman records.
No doubt aided by a story culled from recent headlines, Deep Impact is
also set apart from the rest of the big budget schlock by tapping into
real human emotion.  Some of the heartstring tugging is a little too
much to handle, but if you're used to the weekly emotion manipulation
hour every Thursday night at 10:00 PM, it won't seem quite so painful.
I wonder if you can get an emotion callous?  I wonder how many times I
can use the word `emotion' in this paragraph?
Gung ho MSNBC reporter Jenny Lerner (Leoni, The Naked Truth)
accidentally stumbles onto the asteroid story, thinking that she's
tracking down a lead about the marital infidelities of the newly
resigned Secretary of State, Allen Rittenhouse (James Cromwell, Babe).
Jenny doesn't even get suspicious when she watches Rittenhouse sail away
on a boat full of Ensure.  Once the story breaks, Jenny realizes that
she may finally get the big weekend anchor job, which had been
previously unobtainable because she's too much of a piece of ass.  At
least, that's the impression that I got.
The first half of the picture revolves around a crew of astronauts that
actually plan to land on the asteroid, fill it full of nukes and blow it
apart.  They take off on a craft called `The Messiah', which was
supposedly built secretly in space, while the government kept the story
from the unsuspecting public.  The crew, led by aging space-vet Spurgeon
Tanner (Duvall, The Apostle), is the last hope for all of humanity.
But, if they succeed, the film would only be about 70 minutes.
The second half takes place back on mother Earth, where the government
has built a elaborate series of underground caves (also secretly) to
hold 1,000,000 people and various plant and animal life for the two
years that the planet will be uninhabitable.  200,000 of the lucky
humans were `pre-selected' by the government.  Hopefully, its rolls
include TV's Linda Lavin, bowling great Earl Anthony and all of the MTV
veejays.
The most amazing and unbelievable part of the story is the glaring lack
of restrictions on the number of bags that one can carry into the
caves.  Despite the absence of such restraints, there are no guys trying
to sneak in jet skis, bowling trophies or comic book collections.  Yeah,
like that's going to happen in real life.
Instead of just going through the normal boring motions, Deep Impact
actually makes you think about what you would do in a similar
situation.  Do you go to work?  Do you `covet' your neighbor's wife?  Do
you put aluminum foil in the microwave or remove the tag from your
mattress?  Will Peter Jennings pull down his pants and scream
`Bababooey'?  Who knows, but while the rest of you have been exercising,
reading books and generally improving your lives, I've been stockpiling
videos for just such an emergency.  See how long you can take 24-hour
news coverage of a major event before you're looting the local
Blockbuster.  Don't come knocking on my door for a copy of Strange Days.
While implausible on both a scientific and a `regular Joe' level,
writers Michael Tolkin (The Player) and Bruce Joel Rubin (Jacob's
Ladder) stitch together a relatively cohesive story, big on drama and
remarkably light on huge effects (until the end).  Morgan Freeman stands
out from the ensemble cast as the emotionally wrought President Beck.
The haunting melodies of James Horner (Titanic) provide even more
ammunition to induce tears from teen-aged girls, and you can't really
ask much more from a movie than that.  Except maybe a good sex scene.
Or some karate.  Or vomiting.  *sigh*

Review for Analyze This (1999)
After a preview screening of the new Harold Ramis film, Analyze This
(*** ˝), I broke into a black, fully-loaded 1999 Lincoln Continental in
the theater's parking lot.  My friend at the DMV had previously traced
the plates to one Tony Boombatti (Fat Tony), the owner of the Boombatz
Pizzeria and the right arm of the even more well-known local
`waste-management specialist' Tony Matsorelli (Tony Two-Step).  I then
placed a transmitter under both sun visors in order to get their
reactions to the film.
Tony Matsorelli: Jesus, that was a great  movie.
Tony Boombatti: Great  movie.  Funny as .
Tony M:   Tom Hanks.  Now, DeNiro can act.
Tony B:  Yeah.   Tom Hanks.  (Starts car.)
Tony M: His hand shakes a little bit and all of a sudden he's some great
actor?  C'mon.
Tony B: (Burps.)  Hey, you got a  toothpick?
Tony M: Yeah, I got your toothpick right here, you  .
Tony B. Jesus, my balls  itch like a  mother .
Tony M. What the .  Do I look like your  mother?  I gotta
itch your  balls for you now?  Holy .
Tony B.  you.  I was just sayin'.
Tony B. You know, even that little  Crystal wasn't bad.
Tony M.  money-lenders.  They should stay behind the scenes.
Tony B. He ain't no  Pesci, but he ain't too  bad, either.
Tony M. DeNiro and  Pesci should be in every  movie.
Tony B. Are you  crazy?  If DeNiro and  Pesci were in
every  movie togetherholy .  That would be  great.
Tony M. Hey, didn't Crystal sorta remind you of that lawyeraww ,
what's his name?  Alan Berkowitz?
Tony M.  it.  I forget his  name.  The guy that got that
other guy off for whackin' his wife.
Tony B. That's a  great  lawyer.
Tony M. That fat  guy with the bad skin that's always in the
Mafia movies.  Kinda looks like you, you fat .
Tony M. Jesus  Christ.  You got  marinara in your 
ears?
Tony B.  No, Tony.  I just don't know who you're  talking about.
Tony B. You believe that a hard  like DeNiro would really need to
go to a shrink?
Tony M.  no.  It's just a  movie.  The whole premise was
that he was nervous about the big meeting of the heads of all the
 Families in the whole  country.
Tony M. Everybody knows that we don't  meet like that.  If we
need to have a sit-down, we use  video conferencing on the
 Internet.  We're Sicilian, but we ain't stupid.
Tony M.  Hollywood thinks that we would be stupid enough to meet
in a big  warehouse with no security.
Tony B. Bunch of  parasites.  You think it was too much like The
Sopranos?
Tony M.  no.  The Sopranos don't got DeNiro.  It was sorta the
same, but different, too.
Tony M.  A.  And I gotta hand it to em  that Godfather dream
sequence, where  Crystal gets whacked like Brando, was 
hysterical.
Tony B. That was from The Godfather?  No .
Tony M. Yeah; no , you  .  And that part where
Crystal turns fed and wears a  wire to the sit-down with DeNiro,
but thinks better of it and tears the wire off in the  crapper?
 brilliant.
Tony B.  me.  I think I missed that part when I went to the lobby
to get more  butter on my  popcorn.
Tony M. You wanna get something to eat?
Tony M. Now, there's a  shocker.  Fat Tony hungry.  Stop the
 presses.
Tony B.  you.  I got a slow metabolism.
Tony M. That ain't the only thing that's slow on you, you fat 
mother .
Tony B. (Shouting.)  Hey!  (Tires squeal, horns blow.)  Stay the 
out of my  lane, you piece of  !
Tony M.  this.  (Click, click.)   this guy.
Tony B. (Revving engine.)   mother .  (Whir of power
windows.)
Tony M. (Shouting.)   you, you mother  son of a .

Title
Review for Mission to Mars (2000)
If you're going into Mission to Mars expecting an Armageddon-like
testosterone fest, think again.  It's more of a cerebral space flick,
closer to 2001: A Space Odyssey and Contact than Independence Day.  Mars
is rated `PG,' so the violence is relatively tame, but there are enough
edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting scenes to make it worthwhile.  In
Armageddon, you had a pretty good idea that everything would work out
and that the Earth would be saved, but one of Mars' best features is its
unpredictability.
Mars opens in 2020 on the eve of a groundbreaking mission to the red
planet.  The first-of-its-kind journey will take six months each way,
with the crew spending a full year on the surface of Mars.  During the
opening party scene celebrating the impending mission, Mars introduces
us to the main characters of the film.  There's the husband/wife team of
Woody Blake (Tim Robbins, Arlington Road) and Terri Fisher (Connie
Nielsen, Soldier) and the husband/dead wife team of Jim and Maggie
McConnell (Gary Sinise, Reindeer Games and Kim Delaney, NYPD Blue).  The
idea of NASA allowing married couples to participate in the same
missions is preposterous, and Mars' writers brush the issue off like an
insignificant complaint.  Other characters include Luke Goddard (Don
Cheadle, The Rat Pack) and Phil Ohlmyer (Jerry O'Connell, Body Shots),
the latter of whom seems way too thick to be involved with space travel.
When the party scene ends, Mars quickly flashes forward thirteen months,
where the four-man Mars crew has already landed and set up their base
camp on an area of the fourth planet called Cydonia.  Using a
remote-controlled mini-rover, they see a strange triangular mass on the
top of a mountain.  When the crew tries to bounce radar off of the
mysterious object, it gets all angry and creates that red sand vortex
thing that you've probably seen in the film's trailer (and last year in
The Mummy, but who's counting?).  Casualties ensue, and a rescue mission
is immediately launched from the World Space Station to save the
remaining member(s).
The rescue mission, which is supposed to take six months, is
catastrophically doomed, as well.  They have to land on Mars during a
huge sandstorm, which seems pretty scary since I don't even like to land
at LaGuardia when it's drizzling.  I won't reveal which characters are
in each mission because that would ruin the surprise of who gets bumped
off.  And it is kind of surprising.  Also shocking is the fact that when
the rescue mission lands, the survivor(s) are all disheveled and
unshaven.  Like they wouldn't have brought razors for the original
two-year mission.
Mars was directed by Brian De Palma (Snake Eyes) and penned by a
hodgepodge of screenwriters (Jim and John Thomas, Wild Wild West and
Graham Yost, Hard Rain).  The script is pretty well developed, fully
focusing on the crew and their mission.  In fact, the only non-space
scene in the film is the opening party shot.  You don't see the launch,
you don't see what I imagine would be incredible media hype surrounding
the mission, and you don't see any grieving wives and children.  What's
more, you don't even know if anyone on Earth is privy to the deep space
predicament.
Adding to the glossy sheen of Mars are cinematographer Stephen H. Burum
(an Oscar nominee for Hoffa), editor Paul Hirsch (Oscar winner for Star
Wars) and scoremeister Ennio Morricone (recent Golden Globe winner for
The Legend of 1900).  De Palma shows why he's one of the more
experienced directors around with just one long scene that takes place
in a rotating, no-gravity portion of the rescue ship.  Mars' special
effects are solid and the sound is particularly amazing.  It may not
make you ponder the meaning of Man's existence, but you should still be
entertained.

Review for 13th Warrior, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
For some reason, films that begin with the word `thirteen' never seem to
be very good.  Anybody remember The Thirteenth Floor?  Didn't think so.
The best of the bunch is probably the cheesy 1960 B-flick 13 Ghosts
(filmed in `Illusion-O' by William Castle), where weak-hearted viewers
could opt to not see the spooks that appeared on the screen by looking
through a special hand-held viewer.
Could film titles containing `thirteen' doom the movie?  If they are, in
fact, cursed, then somebody at Disney must not know about it.  They
actually changed the name of this picture to The Thirteenth Warrior.  It
was originally called Eaters of the Dead, like the Michael Crichton book
on which it was based.  Maybe somebody wanted to distance it from Fox's
spring cannibal flop Ravenous.  Warrior has actually been finished for
quite some time and, for some reason, dusted off for a late summer
release.
Coming off as an attempt to combine Braveheart and Star Wars, Warrior
tells the story of an Arab who is forced to join a group of brawny
Scandinavians that hit the road to save a village from destruction at
the hands of an unspeakable evil.  He is far from being a great
mercenary and actually just happens to be in the wrong place at the
wrong time  a toothless old seer says that the village will be saved by
twelve Nordic brutes and one man `who isn't from the North.'  Let me
also point out that the hag spoke one language, which was translated
into another Scandinavian dialect, which was in turn translated into
something else, and yet again interpreted into the Arab language spoken
by the protagonist.  The result seems like an old Swedish film being
uncovered and dubbed by Omar Shariff.  And when was the last time you
shelled out eight bucks to see one of those?
The Arab, played by Antonio Banderas (The Mask of Zorro), sets off with
the twelve barbarians the following morning.  He can't understand what
they're saying, can't lift their giant battle-swords and rides a puny
little horse.  Sounds like my first day of high school.  Although they
are a jovial bunch, almost constantly laughing even though they're
preparing to throw down with something so bad that its name dare not
pass their lips, the men are skeptical of Banderas, and shorten his
hell-a-long Arab name to Ibn (or `son of').
During one particularly silly scene, the film shows Ibn slowly learning
the Scandinavian dialect by silently listening to his mates talk around
the campfire every night.  When he finally masters the language, the
music swells like Luke had just used The Force for the first time.  Ibn
also stops at a blacksmith to whittle his heavy sword into a thin
scimitar and begins to fit into his new surroundings.
Yeah, the battle scenes are fun, but in an attempt to conceal the evil
force the warriors are fighting, they are left murky and jerky.  By the
way, the invincible forces sort of look like a saber-tooth bear that
walks upright and rides horses.  Try to keep your eyes from rolling back
into your skull when a crazy old village woman tells the warriors that
the only way to stop the creatures is to kill their Queen.  How
original!
Adapted for the screen by William Wisher Jr., who penned Terminator 2:
Judgment Day, as well as Crichton's upcoming Airframe, and directed by
John McTiernan (The Thomas Crown Affair  which he had time to make
after this), Warrior is a mess of a film.  It's not the worst film in
the world, but if you pro-rate its entertainment value over what it must
have cost to make, you've got one heck of a stinker.  I wish that there
were a special viewer for this `thirteen' film  one that would turn it
into something else.  (1:54 - R for bloody battles and carnage)

Review for Bride of the Wind (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
For those of you who couldn't get enough of Albert Brooks' 1999 film The
Muse (and I know a lot of you couldn't, considering it didn't even recoup
its $15 million budget) and thought, "Gee, it sure would be great if this
were based on truth...and set in turn-of-the-century Vienna...and a drama
instead of a comedy," then, people, I have got a film for you.  Bride of the
Wind is a drama based on truth that is set during turn-of-the-century
Vienna, and instead of its main character inspiring the likes of James
Cameron, Martin Scorsese, Jeff Bridges and Meathead, she motivates real
artists of that time.
The muse is Alma Moll (Sarah Wynter, The 6th Day), the social-climbing
daughter of a popular stage actress.  Bride opens, after some handsome
opening credits that show old Austrian film clips, in 1902 Vienna, which is
atwitter with the news that the great composer, Gustav Mahler (Jonathan
Pryce, Stigmata), is taking up residence in their fair city.  Everyone
rushes to kiss Mahler's ass, but Alma gets his attention by criticizing his
music.  Mahler in intrigued, but tells Alma, "A symphony is like the world;
it must contain everything."  I think Baz Luhrmann incorporated the same
practice into Moulin Rogue.
Mahler is easily seduced by Alma, and they eventually marry, but he forces
her to give up her burgeoning music career to focus on things like balancing
his books.  Alma squirts out a couple of kids, and after one of them dies
she heads for the sanitarium, where she falls in love with Bauhaus architect
Walter Gropius (Simon Verhoeven).  Alma still accompanies Mahler in his move
to New York City, yet continues to yearn for Gropius.
Then she falls for Impressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka (Vincent Perez, I
Dreamed of Africa), whose first attempt at a physical relationship with Alma
is greeted with a squeeze to the ol' twig-and-berries (she's some lady, this
Alma). After Kokoschka, she moves onto left-wing author Franz Werfel (Gregor
Seberg), who looks a lot like SNL's Darryl Hammond. Alma marries a few of
these four men (it's honestly difficult to keep track of her latest hubby),
and, although it's not shown in the film, continues to bed famous men.
Alma's poor daughter, Anna, obviously confused by the carousel of men, just
calls them all "Uncle."
We're never really given a clear reason why she hops beds so frequently.
Bride is, I think, supposed to show Alma as a pioneer feminist (and, indeed,
the script was written by a woman, first-timer Marilyn Levy), but winds up
portraying her as a flaky horn-dog who is easily bored with men. To make
matters worse, Wynter isn't that great of an actress. Other than her cute
pout (think Cate Blanchett crossed with Renée Zellweger, only without the
talent), there isn't much going on, other than her willingness to
participate in a lot of lingering sex scenes.
Wynter isn't the only performer who disappoints. The usually reliable Pryce
turns in a performance reminiscent of the great Frank Langella. It doesn't
help that the story is poorly written and full of silly dialogue, or that it
casually mentions major historical events as if they were an afterthought,
like when somebody literally sticks their head into one scene to shout about
the assassination of the Archduke. Given the short running time, I wouldn't
be surprised to learn that the original cut from director Bruce Beresford
(Double Jeopardy) was much longer and a bit more detailed but shoddily
edited to a more reasonable length. And I'm not even sure you could consider
Alma a muse. She's more like a starfucker than anything; an early ancestor
of Bonny Bakely.
And the title of the film, in case you were wondering, comes from one of
Kokoschka's paintings.

Review for Chinese Box (1997)
There are probably a lot of metaphors and symbolism that I just flat out
missed when I saw Chinese Box. It could have something to do with seeing
it at 9:00 AM with only 3 hours sleep, or it could just be the subject
matter which I am admittedly not an expert on.
The film is set in Hong Kong during the days between New Year's Eve 1996
(the last under British control) and July 1, 1997 (when China reclaimed
the province). Sounds exciting so far, right? Throw in a tiresome
romance that goes ultimately unresolved and you've got yourself two
hours of pure unadulterated fun.
Jeremy Irons plays John, a sickly Brit author transplanted in Hong Kong
for the last fifteen years. He's left his wife and kid back home,
presumably to pursue the love of his life, Vivian (Gong Li, Farewell My
Concubine). Vivian, a former hooker and John's ex, owns a successful
karaoke bar but wants only to marry her wealthy politician boyfriend,
Chang (Michael Hui), in order to distance herself from a dirty slutty
past. The trouble is that there is absolutely no emotional spark between
John and Vivian, and that is a fact that made me very sleepy.
The saving grace of Chinese Box comes from Maggie Cheung (Supercop), who
plays a street-wise con artist named Jean. John meets her while filming
a monotonous video diary of how  the impending hand-over will effect
citizens of different social pedigree. Jumpy Jean immediately intrigues
John, who squanders his days away trying to find out what makes her
tick.
What these two stories have to do with each other is beyond me. I guess
that I understand the basic comparison of the uncertainty of the three
main characters with the real life inhabitants of the province, but
that's a pretty weak plot. Perhaps viewers more intimate with the
subject matter may find it more passionate.
I'm not even sure if director Wayne Wang found that passion in his
finished product. Wang's previous efforts seem much more emotional to
me, especially The Joy Luck Club and, one of my secret guilty pleasures,
Slamdance. Don't laugh.
And what's the deal with Jeremy Irons career? If he's not playing a
terminally ill character (Stealing Beauty), he's in some big budget
piece of crap (Die Hard with a Vengeance and the reprehensible The Man
in the Iron Mask) or worse yet, the voice of a cartoon character (The
Lion King). Gong Li, who is widely regarded as the most beautiful woman
on the planet, is under used in her first English speaking role. Her
lines are limited and usually monosyllabic. And it is very strange to
see her wearing blue jeans. Cheung and Ruben Blades (The Devil's Own)
shine in their supporting roles.
To summarize, Chinese Box was about as exciting as the actual Hong Kong
hand-over. It was a lot more efficient as a three-minute sound bite
delivered by Peter Jennings.

Title
Review for Russian Doll (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
It's easy to predict the ending of formulaic films, but Australia's Russian
Doll takes the cake.  Anyone with a brief synopsis and half a brain can
deduce every twist and turn without ever prying themselves from the couch.
It's the old, simple story of Boy meets Girl, Boy hates Girl, Boy is forced
to spend time with Girl, Boy falls in love with Girl.  Does this kind of
thing happen often enough in real life to justify the number of films that
share that premise?
The Boy is Harvey (Hugo Weaving, The Matrix), a private investigator who
specializes in catching cheating spouses.  Harvey has a girlfriend to whom
he is about to propose, but learns she's involved with one of the men he's
investigating.  His friends try to fix him up on a blind date, but it goes
horribly wrong (although she's not nearly as bad as Janeane Garofalo in Bye
Bye Love - "I'm just looking for something that will prevent me from
throwing myself in front of a bus").
In the meantime, the Girl, who we will come to know as Katia (Natalia
Novikova), has just come to Australia from St. Petersberg, planning to meet
and marry the man she's been communicating with over the Internet for
several months.  When Katia gets to his house, the man is dead, and she
begins to have an affair with a married man named Ethan (David Wenham), who
happens to be Harvey's best friend.
You can practically fill in the blanks yourself.  Katia is going to be
deported unless she marries someone, and the horny Ethan convinces Harvey to
be her faux beau.  After all, he does have an extra bedroom.  Harvey and
Katia can't stand each other at first - he's a quiet, aspiring novelist and
she's a loud, obnoxious smoker with thick, drain-clogging Russian hair. They
have various barriers to overcome, like language ("Where do you keep the
shits?"  "In the toilet." "No, the shits for the bed.") and religion (Harvey
must convert to Judaism for the wedding) before the romantic sparks begin to
fly.
If you think Doll sounds a bit like Green Card, you're not too far off.
It's predictable, but thankfully short (unlike, say, A Knight's Tale or The
Mummy Returns, which both clock in over 30 minutes longer than Doll).
Weaving does well as the harried sad sack who looks as if he'll crumble from
the weight of the lies he keeps piling atop other lies. Doll isn't a bad
film at all, but it's something we've already seen a bunch of times already.

Review for Trekkies (1997)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Roger Nygard's hysterical documentary about the fans of Star Trek can be
summed up in one scene, where one aficionado describes the growing
popularity of his annual Trek party by proudly stating that `This year,
we had a girl come and everything!'
Such a brazen mockery of the world's easiest target is particularly
welcome among film critics, since Trekkies are the only group lower in
the social food chain.  We may be dorky, but we don't force our pets to
don miniature replicas of Kirk's uniform (they do).  We also don't bid
thousands of dollars for a piece of latex that previously served as one
Trek character's ridged forehead (they do that, too).
But the film also serves an educational purpose.  Viewers will hear both
sides of the timeless `Trekkie' versus `Trekker' battle, learn how to
speak Klingon, and find out which action figures are worth liquidating
their 401(k) to buy.  You can also see Leonard Nimoy scratch his head
while trying to figure out what the hype is all about.
Remember that wacko that insisted on wearing her Star Fleet uniform when
she was called for Whitewater jury duty?  She's here.  So is a dentist
that not only sports his Commander attire to work every day, but also
forces everyone in his office to do the same.  Their stories are mixed
together with dozens of other crackpots, including one particularly
strange woman that swore her cat was a big fan, too.  The film's closing
credits reveal a dedication to that same cat, who I am assuming took its
own life just to get away from the lunatic clutches of its owner.  (1:26

Review for Contender, The (2000)
It's hard not to think of The West Wing when talking about The
Contender.  The former begins its eagerly anticipated second season just
days before the latter hits multiplex screens (the comparison hits
closer to home for me, having screened The Contender the morning after
Wing won the Emmy Award for Best Drama).  DreamWorks did well to release
their film right before the upcoming presidential election, as public
interest in the political process should be at a curiously high level.
The Contender is one heck of a slick film, featuring everything from
top-notch performances, glossy sheen (not Martin) and a
better-than-average script.  It's also billed as Joan Allen's first
leading role, which is surprising, considering she's a well-respected,
two-time Oscar nominee.  While The Contender isn't really her picture to
carry alone, she still does a damn fine job.
The film centers on the President's quest to fill the seat of his
recently deceased Vice President.  Jeff Bridges (The Muse) plays the
Democratic Commander-in-Chief Jackson Evans, a popular leader nearing
the end of his second term.  Desperate to leave a unique stamp on
history, Evans picks Montana Senator Laine Hanson (Allen,
Pleasantville), hoping the appointment of a female Veep will be his
Presidential legacy.
Although Hanson isn't the obvious choice, she's certainly capable and
seems to be a lock for the position.  But Evans and Hanson hit an
iceberg in Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman, Lost in Space), the southern
Republican Senator that heads the confirmation hearings committee.  The
Contender shows the interesting back-room power struggle between the
White House and the conniving Runyon, who clearly has no problem
destroying the integrity of a competent candidate, even if it means
digging up some pretty awful dirt on the Vice Presidential hopeful.
Runyon would rather see Governor Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen,
television's C.S.I.) as the country's second-in-command.  Even though
Hathaway is a Democrat, Runyon is hell-bent on embarrassing Evans in
retaliation for a snub that occurred several years ago.
Allen in fantastic, and an Oscar nomination would not be out of the
question.  Ditto for Oldman, who is refreshing by virtue of not giving
his typical over-the-top performance (although his character looks a lot
like another hammy actor  Roberto Benigni).  But Bridges is The
Contender's big scene-stealer.  His President Evans is extremely
likeable but complexly shrewd (like the big guy on Wing), and he gets
all of the good lines, as well as a funny running gag where he tries to
catch his kitchen staff off-guard with bizarre requests for food.  Sam
Elliott (The Hi-Lo Country) does a good job as the President's Chief of
Staff, while Christian Slater (Very Bad Things) is quite believable as a
turncoat freshman Senator.
The Contender was written and directed by Rod Lurie (Deterrence), a
former film critic for a popular Los Angeles radio station.  You would
think an ex-critic would know better than to slap a preachy morality
lesson onto the end of an otherwise fantastic picture.  The conclusion
of the film might make you leave the theatre with a bad taste in your
mouth, but it shouldn't detract from the otherwise stellar aspects of
The Contender.

Review for Limey, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Just thinking about the opening sequence of Steven Soderbergh's latest
film gives me major chills.  The screen is pitch-black and you can only
hear a man with a very raspy and very frightening voice demand `Tell
metell metell me about Jenny,' before it launches into the opening
credits, where The Who play `The Seeker.'  Start a movie like this and
you'll have me in the palm of your hand every time.
The voice belongs to a hard-edged Brit named Wilson (Terence Stamp,
Episode One), who has just served a nine-year prison sentence for
`wealth redistribution.'  Wilson is headed to Los Angeles in an attempt
to learn more about the death of his daughter Jennifer (Melissa George,
ROAR), who was killed in a car crash on the famed Mulholland
thoroughfare.  The cops believed the crash to be accidental, but Wilson
suspects foul play after receiving a letter in the clink that his
daughter really died under mysterious circumstances.  He has little to
go on  just the name and address of the man that sent the letter.
The opening credits show a very effective, choppy montage of Wilson on
the plane, in the airport, in a cab and in his hotel.  He seems to
become more enraged the closer he gets to LA, pacing the floor of his
hotel like a crazed tiger and smoking like it's going out of style.  He
begins his investigation with Ed (Luis Guzmán, OZ), a Latino who took
acting classes with Jenny and the author of the letter.  Ed can only
give Wilson the name of Jenny's last boyfriend, adding that he may be
able to find more information at a truck warehouse in a deserted section
of the city.
Before heading to the warehouse, Wilson stops off at a grammar school to
stock up on firearms.  He finds the warehouse and charges in like a bull
in a china shop, only to end up badly beaten and bloodied on the curb of
the shady business.  But Wilson doesn't give up easily and manages to
track down Jenny's acting/voice coach Elaine (Lesley Ann Warren,
Teaching Mrs. Tingle).  He eventually finds his daughter's ex, a wealthy
record producer named Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda, The Tempest).
While Wilson is shown blazing a trail through the seedy crime world of
Los Angeles, Soderbergh (Out of Sight) deftly edits clips of a nearly
unrecognizable Stamp in a 1967 Ken Loach film called Poor Cow, showing
the arc of Wilson's character as he moves from peace-loving hippie to
vengeful criminal.  Adding to The Limey's nostalgia is Valentine, who
made a name for himself during the 60s music scene and openly longs for
a return to those simpler times.  The casting of Stamp and Fonda is even
a bit nostalgic, as is the closing display, where a much mellower Stamp
covers Donovan's `Colours' in a scene taken from Poor Cow.
Soderbergh's direction is top-notch, showing cleverly edited scenes
repeatedly flashed forward and back (a la Homicide) and refusing to shy
away from the film's violence.  Credit cinematographer Edward Lachman
and editor Sarah Flack for creating a believable look to the picture.
Written by Dark City scribe Lem Dobbs, The Limey is also chock full of
fantastic acting, especially Stamp and Barry Newman (Bowfinger), who has
a wonderful supporting role as Valentine's bad-ass right-hand man.  The
music is fantastic and the film even shows Soderbergh's Out of Sight
alumni George Clooney in an `Access Hollywood' spoof.
In short, The Limey is a fantastic crime thriller.  My only complaint is
that it wasn't longer.

Review for Krieger und die Kaiserin, Der (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you go to see The Princess and the Warrior with the expectation of a
fast-paced adrenaline rush like writer/director Tom Tykwer's kinetic 1999
arthouse smash Run Lola Run, you may be a bit disappointed.  That's not to
say Warrior isn't good; it's just not as relentlessly concise and edgy as
Lola.  The pace is more akin to Tykwer's first film, Wintersleepers, which
was released after Lola's success in the States.  Although Warrior doesn't
measure up to either Lola or Wintersleepers, it does deal with similar
subject matter, like coincidence and destiny, making Tykwer somewhat of a
second coming of the late Polish auteur Krzysztof Kieslowski.
Warrior stars Lola's Franka Potente (Blow) as Sissi, a quiet, mousy
psychiatric hospital nurse who has a pretty serious accident at the
beginning of the film.  While accompanied by one of the nuthouse's blind
patients, Sissi is hit by a giant truck and lies underneath it, unable to
breathe.  Suddenly, a young man appears and performs an emergency procedure
that will remind some of the Pulp Fiction breastplate-puncturing scene.  As
disturbing as the scene is, it's the best "meet cute" in a confined space
since J. Lo and George Clooney took that trunk ride together in Out of
Sight.
Sissi spends a couple of months recovering in the hospital, but once she's
mobile again, she sets out to find the mystery man who saved her life.  The
only clues she has are a button she pulled off the man's shirt and the blind
patient who "witnessed" the entire incident.  What Sissi doesn't know is
that the man, named Bodo (Benno Fürmann), is a thief who unwittingly caused
the truck to hit her as he ran from a botched bank robbery.  Bodo, an
ex-soldier, dove under the truck to avoid the pursuing policemen more than
anything.
Tykwer, who also co-wrote the film's score, does a good job fleshing out the
background of his two leads, especially the heartbreaking, self-hating Bodo,
who, after the death of his wife, landed a job at a funeral home but was
sacked after bawling at his first funeral.  The bank robbery was supposed to
be The Big Score that, presumably, would help to erase the misery of his
past, which often causes him to wake up crying while clutching onto the
boiler in his bedroom.
The wide-eyed Potente, who gets to wear a few different outfits this time
(and her hair has changed from shocking orange to a tamer blonde), proves
her work in Lola was no fluke.  Her Sissi is the princess of the asylum; a
dreamer who thinks fate brought her and Bodo together for a reason.
Warrior is much more serious than Tykwer's previous two efforts, and a
little self-important, too.  While it offers a few twists and turns like
Wintersleepers (and is nearly as colorful), it has no edge, and the ending
that's supposed to stoke your imagination falls pretty flat.  Warrior is
definitely pleasing to the eye, with cinematographer Frank Griebe returning
from Lola and Wintersleepers to provide lush photography.

Title
Review for Magnolia (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
I'm not even sure where to begin this review.  To attempt a description
of the plot in less than 5,000 words would be pointless  it's a
three-plus hour film that has separate storylines for each of its nine
main characters.  To heap praise on the acting would be a grave
understatement  a finer cast may not ever have been assembled.  To laud
the direction would be futile  it may be the best of the decade.
The film is Magnolia, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's
much-anticipated follow-up to Boogie Nights.  Here, Anderson has brought
back most of his Nights crew (both in front of and behind the camera)
and bumped up the complexity of his script to complement the eye-popping
beauty of his sweeping direction.  The result seems like Robert Altman's
structure combined with Martin Scorsese's visual flair.  It's almost too
much to take in during one viewing.  Anderson is brilliant on a
cinematic level that no other director has dared to even set foot.  He's
light years ahead of his counterparts and, if the progression of his
work is any indication, the twenty-nine-year-old will likely have a
mantle full of awards by the time he has his mid-life crisis.
Two of the biggest pleasures of Nights were its audacious opening (the
long tracking shot that went inside and outside a disco) and closing
scenes (where Mark Wahlberg finally revealed his `gift').  They're both
done better in Magnolia.  The film starts rather unconventionally, with
a narrator dizzily showing three detailed examples of how life is simply
a series of coincidences.  The ending is beyond explanation and would be
ruined if I were to try.  In between, the film is excruciatingly sad,
yet inexplicably beautiful.
Once Magnolia is finished with its initial setup of life's
unpredictability, viewers are quickly introduced to the main
characters.  And when I say `quickly,' brothers and sisters, I mean
quickly.  Before you can catch your breath, a third of the film has
already flown by.  Which is probably a good thing, on account of the
running time.  The pace gradually slows down as the film progresses, but
as the tempo diminishes, you can start to feel the pressure slowly
building in each of the characters and storylines.
The film is set in the San Fernando Valley and encompasses the nine
major characters during one rainy day in Southern California.  In fact,
most of the film takes place over a half-hour period.  There is a corny
cop (John C. Reilly, For Love of the Game), his cokehead love interest
(Melora Walters, L.A. Doctors), her game-show host father (Philip Baker
Hall, The Insider), his current and former whiz kid contestants
(newcomer Jeremy Blackman and Happy, Texas' William H. Macy,
respectively).  There's also the game show's producer (Jason Robards,
Beloved), his trophy wife (Julianne Moore, An Ideal Husband), estranged
son (Tom Cruise, Eyes Wide Shut) and home care nurse (Philip Seymour
Hoffman, Flawless).
To try to pick a center to Magnolia's story would be ludicrous.  There
isn't one.  There isn't a main character, either, and not all of the
roles intersect with each other.  Some do, but most don't.  Some
relationships between characters are implied but never shown during the
film.  The only similarity in each character is that they all are on the
run from their past, whether they realize it or not.  If anything,
Magnolia shows the effect of damaged relationships between fathers and
their children.  Each character is directly messed up as a result of
their paternal bonds.
Of the actors, Cruise will get the most attention.  He's the biggest
star and has the best lines (some of the greatest woman-hating dialogue
since Jason Patric in Your Friends and Neighbors).  Although Moore has
already been mentioned as a potential Oscar candidate, I found her role
to be a bit inferior to the others.  She's not bad, but her character
simply bursts into hysterics in every scene.  More impressive were
Robards, Reilly and Walters.  And Blackman and Hoffman.  And Hall.
Macy's character, while splendidly acted, did little to add to the rest
of the film.  If the role were missing, the film would not be affected.
But the real star here is Anderson, who glues together long, sweeping
takes with quick edits and unique camera angles to create a visual
masterpiece.  A lot of people will gripe about the running time, and
Anderson even has the gall to have a character piss their pants during
the two-hour mark of the film, as if to egg on viewers with weak
bladders.  Some people may find Jon Brion's (Anderson's Hard Eight)
score annoying, but I thought it was very well done, as well as a
perfect complement to Magnolia's songs, which are performed by Aimee
Mann.  At one point in the film, one of Mann's songs is performed by
each character in a karaoke music-video style that will certainly be
remembered as one of the greatest cinematic moments of the year.

Title
Review for End of Days (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Arnold Schwarzenegger's new action vehicle End of Days seemed like it
went on for days.  The mindless thriller - Arnie's first in two years -
takes place during the final four days of the upcoming millennium and
feels like it was shot in real-time.  The premise is that Satan needs to
impregnate a `chosen' female before the clock strikes 12 in order to be
released from his prison.  They didn't specifically say it, but I think
the prison may be Joliet.
The opening credits utilize every bad religious cliché they could dig up
 fire, snakes, spooky singing and Arabic text.  The film kicks off in
1979 Vatican City, Rome, where an astrological event known as `The Eye
of God' is seen by an underling of the Pope.  The presence of the `Eye'
means that somewhere in the world, a girl is to be born that will, in
twenty years' time, be impregnated by Satan.  The Pontiff dispatches men
to find the girl (yeah, right) and keep her from evil for a couple of
decades.  Sounds reasonable, right?  Six hours later, the `chosen'
infant girl is born in New York City, the evilest place in the world in
1979.
Flash to present-day (December 28, 1999, to be exact) where Satan
returns to Earth, taking over the body of a Wall Street banker (Gabriel
Byrne, who just played a priest in Stigmata) in the men's room of a posh
NYC eatery.  Despite his new form (and his invincibility), Satan still
feels the need to hire protection services to venture around the Big
Apple.  Enter Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, Batman & Robin) a drunk
ex-cop (isn't Bruce Willis supposed to get these roles?) with a funny
sidekick called Chicago (Kevin Pollak, She's All That).  They both have
great names, but each pales in comparison to Satan.
The `chosen' girl (Robin Tunney, Niagara, Niagara), now twenty, doesn't
show up until thirty minutes into the film.  Her name is Christine York
(get it  Christ-ine?).  Both of her parents are dead and she's been
having strange visions for most of her life and, as a result, pops pills
and sees a shrink (Udo Kier, Blade).  As a side note, if your therapist
looks like Udo Kier  run for your life.  One of the visions involves a
creepy cross-eyed subway freak that tells her, `He's coming, and he's
going to f--- you!' before shattering like a frozen Robert Patrick in
T2.  Why this person has not yet been cast in a Harmony Korine film is
beyond me.
One of the catches in Satan's plan is that he has to conceive between
11:00 PM and 12:00 AM on New Year's Eve.  What are the odds that she is
even ovulating at that time?  Arnie even gets off a great line,
rhetorically asking if Satan's plot is designed around Eastern Standard
Time.  The writers laugh it off with some quick blurb about Gregorian
calendars being created for this very reason.  Plus, you've gotta figure
that Satan really needs to start working on the girl at around 11:40 at
the latest.  He seems like the kind of guy who likes to sweet-talk the
ladies.  I figure ten minutes of foreplay, five for the actual `act,'
and then five minutes of cuddle-time.
End of Days does have a few cool visuals (from special effects wiz Stan
Winston) and one legitimately scary scene, but that was lifted from
Se7en (and Kevin Spacey was a much scarier villain than the Devil,
anyway).  Speaking of Spacey, they also lifted his `Satan's greatest
trick was convincing the world he didn't exist' line from The Usual
Suspects.  Satan's giant head of fire (an effect ruined by the trailer)
is cool, but we've already seen it in The Mummy (and it wasn't that
great to begin with).  Also disappointing was Satan's non-human form
which, when revealed at the end, seemed a lot like Buffy's principal in
the season finale last season.  The pre-sold `modern rock' soundtrack
was all but missing from the film.
Directed by Peter Hyams (The Relic) and written by Andrew W. Marlowe
(Air Force One), Days features an incredibly hammy performance by
Schwarzenegger, who, in one scene, even gets to cry when he thinks about
Jericho's dead wife and kid.  Tunney, who was so good in Niagara,
Niagara, seems both badly lost and miscast.  Going from indie pics like
Niagara and Julian Po to a Schwarzenegger film doesn't seem like a
logical jump at all.  Plus, she has one of the most unnecessary nude
scenes in recent memory  goodbye, credibility!  Byrne chews the scenery
as the Horned One, who, we learn, is able to piss gasoline.  Rod Steiger
(Crazy in Alabama) plays a puffy priest that would rather rely on faith
to save Christine, while some of his churchie cohorts would just as soon
kill her to put an end to the whole saga.
But, seriously, how much faith can you put into a film that doesn't
reveal the name of its main character until ninety minutes in?
(Christine says his name at this point, which is the first time we hear
it.)  And speaking of faith, where the Christ is the good guy in all of
this?  Yeah, I'm talking about the big `G.'  Can't we rely on him to
give us a hand when Satan plans on turning our sphere into Hell on
Earth?  He was a no-show.  A non-factor.  You can kiss your tithe
goodbye, Ms. Morrissette.

Review for True Crime (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
Clint Eastwood is back both in front of and behind the camera in this
dreadful adaptation of the Andrew Klavan novel.  In Crime, he plays
Steve Everett, a ballsy newspaper reporter best known for taking down
the Mayor of New York City, but, because of his penchant for bedding the
wives and daughters of his editors, finds himself writing metro stories
for the Oakland Tribune.  He's also married, has a young daughter and is
a recovering alcoholic.
After one of his colleagues is killed in a car crash, Everett is
assigned to write a `human interest' sidebar on Frank Beachum (Isaiah
Washington, Out of Sight), a man scheduled to be killed by lethal
injection for allegedly shooting a pregnant convenience store employee
in the chest over $96 and a bottle of steak sauce. After briefly
reviewing the facts (and I'm talking about thirty-seconds-briefly),
Everett decides that they have the wrong guy and immediately begins an
investigation into the incident.  Of course, nobody believes him and he
only has twelve hours to right the wrong made by our judicial system.
Unfortunately, these twelve hours seem like they are filmed in
`real-time.'
Unlike every other film about wrongly accused death-row inmates, Crime
doesn't concentrate on the condemned prisoner, but rather on Eastwood,
who plays a very unlikeable role.  He grits his teeth and utters each
line like it has some deep meaning, but they just don't.  And Father
Time hasn't been kind to Mr. Eastwood, either.  He looks like a ghoul.
Ned Devine looked more alive than Clint.  And there was one scene where
they show a close-up of his hand, which was as wrinkled and gnarly as
the root of a 500-year-old tree.  Dirty Harry?  Not anymore.
Incontinent Harry?  Probably so. (R  2:05 for violence, adult language

Title
Review for Evolution (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Director Ivan Reitman has a checkered filmography that contains some
classics (Meatballs, Dave), some unwatchable flops (Junior, Father's Day)
and some hits that I never really understood (Six Days Seven Nights, Twins).
His latest - Evolution - looks like a cross between Men in Black and
Ghostbusters, the latter being the film for which Reitman is best known.
Evolution is a sci-fi comedy with good special effects, a fairly funny
script and a really dopey ending.
Evolution is set in Glen Canyon, Arizona and begins with a wannabe fireman
named Wayne Green (Seann William Scott, Road Trip) practicing rescue
techniques in an abandoned shack in the desert.  A meteor the size of an NBA
star falls out of the sky and demolishes his car, and the following day, the
local police call the area's representative of the United States Geological
Survey to the scene.  He is Harry Block (Orlando Jones, Say It Isn't So), a
geology professor at Glen Canyon Community College, and he brings along his
friend and colleague, Ira Kane (David Duchovny, Return to Me), who teaches
biology at the school.
When they arrive at the crash site, Ira and Harry find an extremely well-lit
meteor that has buried itself 80 feet underground.  It's also teeming with
one-cell organisms that, upon closer examination back in their lab, seem to
be multiplying at an incredible rate via mitosis.  Further tests reveal the
little critters to contain alien DNA, and the two professors try to keep
their find a secret as they giggle about winning fame, riches and
prestigious science awards.
Before long, the creatures start getting bigger and bigger, forming dozens
of different mutations in an attempt to adapt to their new surroundings (or
"evolving," if you will) and spreading faster than Haley Joel Osment's
do-gooder plan in Pay it Forward.  The government eventually gets involved
and takes control of the project, giving Ira and Harry the boot in favor of
a clueless General (Ted Levine) and Allison Reed (Julianne Moore, Hannibal),
the assistant director of the Centers for Disease Control.
While Evolution's ending is a bit of a disappointment (it offers the
goofiest solution to ridding the Earth of aliens since the whole Slim
Whitman thing in Mars Attacks!), the film is consistently funny, which comes
as quite a surprise considering the writers involved.  Don Jakoby penned the
laughably bad John Carpenter's Vampires, while David Diamond and David
Weissman were responsible for the ooey-gooey crapfest called The Family Man.
They even manage to throw in a funny crack at the Feds, which, of course,
was written for Duchovny.  Evolution's two biggest gags involve the
sphincter, but since Tom Green isn't involved with the film, and it isn't
marketed specifically toward teenagers, look for most press to overlook this
fact.
Reitman isn't a flashy director.  With his films, it's the little things
that make them more entertaining.  Every line is delivered with impeccable
timing, every double-take is perfect, and some of the best zingers are
barely audible gems said under the breath of his three male leads.  And he
even gets Oscar-nominee Moore to play a klutz who wears garter belts - a
dangerous combination.
1:42 - PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, and for sci-fi action

Title
Review for Driven (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
It's probably no coincidence that Driven is only one letter away from being
Drivel.  The film, made by long-time critical whipping boys Renny Harlin
(director) and Sylvester Stallone (star/screenwriter), features a 20-race
Formula One season that pits the defending champion (an unlikeable German)
against the rookie (a dreamy Calvin Klein model).  When it's showing a race,
Driven is merely adequate; when it's not, it's downright awful.
Admittedly, I know nothing about racing, other than the fact it's as
exciting as watching paint dry, and I furrow my brow at the fans who insist
it's a sport.  "You've got to be in great shape to race a car," they say.
Right.  I've seen plenty of fat people drive fast.  As far as I can tell
(and Driven didn't change my opinion at all), you need only a big bladder
and the ability to sit still for a really long time.  The only thing those
hillbillies in the stands (and the theatre audience, for that matter) want
to see is a crash, and then they're horrified when somebody zooms off to
that Big Oval in the Sky.  Here are a few things I did learn from the film:
- When there's an accident on the track, the Kyrgyzstan flag is triumphantly
waved to cheer up the spectators.
- Drivers pass their girls around like joints. (Have you seen Jeff Gordon's
wife?  Where do I sign up for this racing thing?)
- If you hum, you'll drive faster (try it at home, kids!).
- The cars are really controlled by laptop computers manned by nerdy men who
are neatly tucked away so nobody sees them.
Driven focuses on an F1 racing team managed by the wheelchair-bound Carl
Henry (Burt Reynolds, The Crew).  He has two drivers in his stable - Memo
Moreno (Cristián de la Fuente, Family Law) and rookie Jimmy Blye (Kip
Pardue, Remember the Titans).  When Blye begins to challenge the defending
F1 champion, Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger), he jettisons Memo and makes a
call to a washed-up ex-racer named Joe Tanto (Stallone, Get Carter) to help
steer his promising rookie in the right direction.
Thrown into the mix are three women who do incredibly little to add anything
to the weak story.  Gina Gershon (The Insider) is married to Memo but is
also Tanto's ex-wife.
Synchronized-swimmer-turned-Sports-Illustrated-swimsuit-model Estella Warren
(who is dating Pardue in real life) plays Brandenburg's squeeze, but she
leaves him for Blye.  In the Company of Men's Stacy Edwards clocks in a
throwaway role as a reporter assigned to cover the F1 season and all of the
chest-thumping attendant thereto - you know, kind of the Jane Goodall of
car-driving chimps.  Since you can practically see testosterone dripping off
the screen here, it's a big surprise that there isn't one sex scene.  Nobody
even kisses, which is just plain weird, especially since you know Stallone's
character will nail Edwards' five seconds before they even meet (it just HAS
to be on the cutting-room floor, abandoned for the PG-13 rating).
Isn't it about time we go ahead and subtitle Stallone?  I've heard more
intelligible things spewing out of the homeless guy at the bus stop who's
always going on about flying hams.  Sly's psychic mother makes more sense at
this point.  His script - the first he's penned on his own since the
celebrated Rocky V - goes out of its way to show that each character is
damaged in some way or another, but not in a way to make viewers care.
Driven includes several laughably bad motivational speeches and the lamest
foreshadowing in years.  Oh my God - I can't believe it's going to come down
to the last race of the season!
Harlin (Deep Blue Sea) does well with the racing scenes (especially the
crashes), but everything else is a poorly paced mess.  The music (from BT)
is annoying and the non-stop product placement is way too convenient to
ignore.  Driven can't even find anything to do with the beautiful but
clearly untalented Warren ("Well, what CAN you do, sweetie?"  "I used to be
a synchronized swimmer."  "Bingo, then that's what you'll do.").  When Gina
Gershon lends an air of credibility to your film, you're in big, big
trouble.

Review for Down to Earth (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
This is from an actual conversation overheard at a promotional screening for
Down to Earth:
PATRON: Do you know what this movie is about?
USHER: Which movie are you here to see?
PATRON: Oh.    Isn't that an old movie?
USHER: Well, it's supposed to be a remake of Heaven Can Wait.
PATRON: No, I mean didn't Down to Earth come out last year?
PATRON: Sure it did.  Wasn't that the one with Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia
Stiles?
PATRON: Oh.    Wait, I got it.  It was the one with that girl that
looks like Helen Hunt and that boy from Election.
USHER: No, that was...shoot.  I can't think of the name.  It's right on the
tip of my tongue.
PATRON: Yeah, that was the one, I think.  She lived on a farm and fell in
love with a rich guy.
USHER: Here on Earth!  That's what it was.  Here on Earth.
PATRON: Oh.    That's just confusing.  Do you think they've run out
of titles?
USHER:   You think that's confusing?  Try selling tickets when
Bamboozled and Bedazzled are both playing.  Or The Legend of Drunken Master
and The Legend of Bagger Vance.  Or Saving Silverman and Save the Last
Dance.
PATRON: Oh, I just loved him in that movie with Jackie Chan.
USHER: Chris Rock was in Nurse Betty and Dogma and Lethal Weapon 4.
PATRON: And the voice of the hamster in The Nutty Professor 2?
PATRON: Oh.    Can you tell me which theatre The Wedding Planner is
in?
Believe it or not, some people know who Chris Rock is, and some people will
pay to see him on the big screen.  Sure, Down to Earth is his first starring
 role (not counting the New Jack City spoof, CB4), and it's recycled from a
script (Heaven Can Wait) that was a recycled script itself (Here Comes Mr.
Jordan), but Rock is a very funny guy with a very funny talk show on HBO.
Rock plays Lance Barton, a bike messenger and struggling stand-up comedian
from New York City.  Lance's routine is awful, and he is called Booey by
people familiar with his act.  His dream is to win a highly coveted slot at
the Apollo for the legendary theatre's last night before it closes up for
good.  It's amusing to watch Rock, a brilliant comedian, playing a character
who bombs on stage (it's better than Seinfeld taking a dive to throw off
Kenny Bania), but it's even funnier to watch the wiry actor ride a bike, and
funnier yet to see his narrow head in a giant bike helmet.
The unintentional sight gag only lasts for a second, because Lance is hit by
a truck and dies.  Because of a clerical error in Heaven, Lance is given the
chance to temporarily inhabit another person's body until a more suitable
host can be located by his angels (Eugene Levy and Chazz Palminteri).  He
picks the corpse of Charles Wellington, the 15th richest man in America who,
like his Heaven Can Wait counterpart, was poisoned by his wife (Jennifer
Coolidge, Best in Show) and her lover (Greg Germann, Sweet November).
As an old, fat, white guy, Lance's racially charged act doesn't exactly play
well with the brothers.  His problems are compounded when he falls in love
with a woman (Regina King) who hates his guts for cutting funding to the
Brooklyn hospital that employs her.  Don't worry - it all works out in the
end.  It's cute, predictable and sporadically funny.
Earth is rated PG-13, which means that Rock's trademark adult humor is
completely absent.  Rock without the F-word is like the Lakers without
Shaq - sure, they're still going to win some of the time, but it's just not
the same.  There are only a few scenes where you see Rock's character in
Wellington's body - thankfully, he doesn't don a fat suit like The Nutty
Professor.
Speaking of The Nutty Professor, two of that film's screenwriters - Chris
and Paul Weitz - directed Earth.  They're probably better known by the
unwashed masses for their teen sex romp, American Pie, but savvy moviegoers
will recognize them from Chuck and Buck.  The Weitz brothers use two actors
from Pie here (Levy and Coolidge, who played Stifler's mom), as well as a
number of performers from Rock's HBO show, including the immensely
hysterical Wanda Sykes, who steals every scene she's in.

Review for A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The summer of 2001 has been pretty disappointing so far, at least
cinematically (although that story about the monster who drowned her kids
should satisfy our tabloid cravings for several months).  Sure, the box
office numbers are at an all-time high, but each blockbuster has been as
empty as the Bush administration's commitment to the environment.  How
strange it is that the season's best (and most cerebral) film is about a
world in which Bush and his cronies have melted the polar icecaps and buried
most coastal cities under hundreds of feet of water.  And that this world
restricts its citizens when it comes to pregnancy because there just isn't
enough food to feed everybody.  And that the leading scientific minds are
able to create robotic "child substitutes" who can actually be programmed to
love parents that are unable to have kids of their own.  It makes you wonder
how many years you get for drowning five robo-kids.
The film, of course, is A.I. (for Artificial Intelligence), the long-awaited
collaboration between Steven Spielberg (Saving Private Ryan) and the late
Stanley Kubrick (Eyes Wide Shut), who have a combined 22 Oscar nominations
(but just three trophies) between them.  Kubrick bought the rights to Brian
Aldiss' 1969 short story Supertoys Last All Summer, the inspiration for
A.I., about 20 years ago but lacked both the technology and the pace to
direct the film himself (think about it - the young actor playing Kubrick's
robo-boy would be 28 when he finally finished filming)  He tapped Spielberg
to direct, gave him thousands of storyboards, and had planned to stay on as
a producer before his untimely demise.
So what is a collaboration between Kubrick and Spielberg like?  Well, it's
very dark and probably isn't suitable for young kids (the Kubrick part), but
still manages to be cute and button-pushing (the Spielberg part)  A.I.'s
first section (there are three) is defiantly the most Kubrickian.  It
focuses on a young couple (Bedazzled's Frances O'Connor and Bounce's Sam
Robards) whose young son, Martin (Jake Thomas, The Cell), is dying from a
fatal illness. Henry, the father, is an employee of Cybertronics, one of the
world's leading robot manufacturers.  The company makes their money with
lifelike sexbots, robo-butlers and the like, but their leader (William Hurt,
Sunshine) wants to try something new - making a robotic child capable of
loving its parents. After all, "Didn't God create Adam to love Him?"
The first model, named David (Haley Joel Osment, Pay It Forward), is given
to Henry, who brings it home to his horrified wife, still grieving over the
potential loss of her only son.  She eventually grows to love David, but
when Martin miraculously recovers, the faux son falls out of favor with his
parents.  The film's two biggest themes - jealousy and aspiration - come
into play when David hears the story of Pinocchio and longs to become a real
boy so that his mommy will love him as much as Martin.  His desire to become
flesh begins to cloud his mind, leading him to believe he is real and
nothing like the robot supertoy Teddy, a walking, talking bear that serves
as David's sidekick (and sounds a whole lot like Douglas Rain's HAL 9000).
Without giving too much of the story away (they did well to keep much of it
under wraps), David and Teddy go on an incredible journey in which they
encounter people who hate robots (led by The Tailor of Panama's Brendan
Gleeson), a gigolo (Jude Law, Enemy at the Gates), and a Ministry concert
(!?) in their search for The Blue Fairy that David believes will make him a
real boy.  Parts of the film get Phantom-Menaced down a bit, especially in
one scene that features the voice of Robin Williams, but for the most part,
it's all good.
Best of all is the chirpy Osment, who not only proves the whole Sixth Sense
thing wasn't a fluke, but logs in the year's best acting performance to
date. A.I. also features a handful of surprising cameo voices, like Chris
Rock, Meryl Streep and Ben Kingsley, who narrates the opening and closing
scenes. Spielberg, who has won Oscars for direction each of the last two
times he's tackled dramas (Ryan, Schindler's List), penned the script
himself (his first since Close Encounters of the Third Kind).  His band of
merry men do a great job with the technical stuff, highlighted by creepy
production design courtesy of Rick Carter (What Lies Beneath) and
Ryan/Schindler's Oscar winners Janusz Kaminski (cinematography) and Michael
Kahn (editing).  And the John Williams score, which lately have been
nauseatingly repetitious, is warm, effective and bolstered by the Los
Angeles Master Chorale.

Title
Review for Planet of the Apes (1968)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The wonderful thing about Tim Burton's "retelling" of The Planet of the Apes
is that most of the people involved with the original are dead and, thusly,
can't make annoying cameo appearances like we've gotten used to seeing in
the remake genre (who cares if Roddy McDowall plays an ape again if you
can't see his face?).  Sure, Charlton Heston is in it, but he's practically
dead.  His brain is, anyway.  It's a prerequisite for membership in the NRA.
It's been over 30 years since Apes' initial release in 1968, and while the
special effects, which include a barber pole in the spaceship, don't exactly
hold up, the story does, even though it's better suited for something like
The Twilight Zone (in fact, Rod Serling was one of the film's writers).  The
Gen-Xers to whom the new film is targeted probably see the original as a
cheesy sci-fi adventure, thanks to four sub-par sequels (they got worse and
worse) and the lame-o television spin-off that followed.  Sure, it was
cheesy, but the original was so much more than sweaty actors in plastic
monkey suits.  Apes examined difficult issues like bigotry and evolution in
a unique and thought-provoking way, making it a whole lot more interesting
than, say, 95% of the sci-fi films that followed it.
After a brief monologue from Heston (a previous Oscar winner for Ben Hur)
explaining that he and his three-person crew have been traversing space for
hundreds and hundreds of Earth years, his Colonel George Taylor straps
himself into a space-bed with the intention of waking up as his ship
approaches Earth.  But like they so often do, things go wrong.  One of
Taylor's shipmates doesn't survive the journey, and to make matters worse,
the craft has somehow veered off course, leaving the three survivors
believing that they're 320 light years from home.  The ship crashes into a
body of water on a strange planet and quickly sinks just after the men
escape (they don't bother checking the composition of the atmosphere, but
that's just one of the film's many unintentional laughs...like when they
wake up after years of space-sleep with full beards but the same haircut).
It isn't long before Taylor and his men are rounded up, like so many Jews
and Africans, by the apes that control the planet.  While the message isn't
at all blunt (Taylor and crew are White; apes are Black), it's delivered
extremely well.  The monkeys think all humans are filthy, smelly and
disease-ridden, and spray them down with high-powered hoses (the original
was more of a straight role-reversal than the remake). And if the
stereotype-smashing isn't enough for you, there's also a debate on
evolution, in which Drs. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Zira (Kim Hunter)
clash with the old, conservative Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans).
So the story (written by Serling and Michael Wilson, based on Pierre
Boulle's novel) is cool and the effects are dated - what about the acting?
It's god-awful.  Is there any actor alive capable of overacting like Heston
does here?  He makes Rob Schneider and Troy McClure look like Olivier and
Gielgud.  The highlight of Apes is the 30 minutes that Heston is unable to
speak.
Apes landed Oscar nominations for its costumes and Jerry Goldsmith's
unmistakable score, and won an Honorary Award for the cutting-edge makeup
used to create the apes.  The film's sets are strikingly similar to those
recently seen in the Oscar-nominated Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole
Christmas, and the scarecrows that the apes use to frighten the masses away
from The Forbidden Zone probably inspired the stick man figure from The
Blair Witch Project.  And it was rated G, despite Linda Harrison's skimpy
outfits and the nude swimming scene Taylor shares with his crew before the
apes show them what for.

Title
Review for Zoolander (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Filling the hole usually occupied by crappy Saturday Night Live
skits-turned-feature films, Ben Stiller's Zoolander is a comedy cut from the
same cloth as Airplane and The Naked Gun.  Like those pictures, it throws a
lot of jokes at the audience, but most of them stick, which makes it better
than all of the recent SNL debacles.  Zoolander, like Superstar and Ladies'
Man, was born in sketch comedy, expanding a character created by Stiller for
the 1996 and 1997 VH-1 Fashion Awards.
Stiller plays three-time Male Model of the Year Derek Zoolander, a
brain-dead pretty boy we meet as he's being interviewed for Time by a
reporter named Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor, Marcia from the Brady
film updates) just before the VH-1 Fashion Awards (the cable channel
produced the film).  Matilda, intent on writing a scathing piece on the
modeling industry, gets plenty of good stuff, topped off by Derek showing
her his catalogue of different "looks" that all look the same.
Derek is up for an unprecedented fourth straight MMOY Award but loses to
red-hot newcomer Hansel (Owen Wilson, Stiller's Meet the Parents co-star),
who tools around with a yo-yo, a scooter and an entourage that seems to grow
in each scene.  Crushed, Derek considers retiring, but he is talked into one
last campaign by agent Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller).  The big Derelicte
show, it turns out, is really a ruse by an international syndicate of
fashion designers who want to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia
because he's threatening to enact laws that will do away with the cheap
child labor the designers need to make their dumb clothes.  Derek is
hypnotized by a Bond-like baddie (Will Ferrell, SNL) named Jacobim Mugatu,
who has a foxy Russian henchwoman (Milla Jovovich, The Claim) available to
do his bidding.
Most of Zoolander's laughs come at the expense of male models, but the
film's biggest gag might be its attempt to push Stiller (who's practically a
chimp) and Wilson (who has the worst nose in Hollywood) as the cream of the
world's modeling crop.  But Zoolander is far from a one-joke flick.  There
are plenty of very funny set pieces (including Derek's return to his
coal-mining roots) and a ton of nods to other films (most notably and
hysterically, 2001: A Space Odyssey).  Stiller also casts half of the
industry as both themselves and fictional characters (including a nearly
unrecognizable Andy Dick), as well as most of his family.
Wilson, once again, steals the show in the acting department (he's been
believable as a cowboy, a serial killer, and now, a rock-star-like model).
As far as Stiller's direction (which I've thought has been overrated ever
since Reality Bites), he's far from being what even the dimmest person could
consider accomplished, but he gets the job done by keeping the film's pace
quick and steady.  Stiller co-wrote Zoolander's script with Drake Sather,
who has worked on some of television's funniest shows (NewsRadio, The Larry
Sanders Show).  And Zoolander is yet another film that previously featured
shots of the World Trade Center, which have been removed from the prints
that will make their way to theatres near you.

Title
Review for Cats & Dogs (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
We've already seen kids play James Bond this year in Spy Kids - now it's
time for the family pet to don high-tech gear and battle the bad guys.  And
if there's anything more visually pleasing than a talking dog using
binoculars, I don't want to know what it is.  Cats and Dogs ranks somewhere
between Shrek and Atlantis for summer family-film enjoyment.  The story
barely matters, and it smartly takes a backseat to the picture's
surprisingly well-done special effects.
I know, I know - you're all thinking, "We've just seen a cruddy movie about
talking animals with Eddie Murphy, and the last decent family film with
talking dogs and cats was Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, and that's
so old, Michael J. Fox wasn't even shaking yet."  Well, you're right, and
what's more, Cats is violent and mean-spirited, to boot.  But it's a whole
lot of fun, and the kids at my screening sure seemed to enjoy the hell out
it.
The film opens with an impressive chase scene between a dog and cat that
culminates in the dog being "catnapped" by a gang of ferocious felines that
work for the fiendishly evil Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes, Will and
Grace).  What, you may ask yourselves, would a cat who is hell-bent on
taking over the world want with a mangy old pooch?  It's simple:  The dog
was really an undercover special agent protecting a scientist (Jeff
Goldblum, Holy Man) and his cutting-edge research on a dog allergy formula.
If Professor Brody succeeds, dogs will remain at the right hand of their
masters.  If the cats are able to sabotage the project, they'll take over
the human race, just like they did in ancient Egypt.  (Don't ask me - I told
you the story took a backseat to the effects, remember?)
The undercover dog agents (whose motto is "To Fetch and Protect") try to get
one of their own into the Brody household to defend the professor's work,
but a rather moronic Beagle puppy named Lou (Tobey Maguire, Wonder Boys)
becomes the new family pet instead.  Lou has dreamt of exciting adventures
but has no formal dog militia training, which means he gets his ass kicked
by a pair of Ninja cats before his superior (Alec Baldwin, Pearl Harbor) can
show Lou how to take care of himself.  Holy shit!  Is it a sign of the
apocalypse when the dog voiced by Baldwin looks just like Baldwin?  That's
one creepy dog.
There are a few other decent celebrity voices in Cats, like Susan Sarandon,
Michael Clarke Duncan, Joe Pantoliano and Jon Lovitz (wait - is he still a
celebrity?).  Like Shrek, there's a lot of inside adult humor, too, like
when one dog exclaims in frustration, "Son of my mother!"  The bit with the
Russian cat is priceless, as is the best soccer spoof since The Simpsons
went to the Mexico v. Portugal match.  It's all kind of surprising,
considering the script is from a couple of guys with no feature-film
experience (John Requa and Glenn Ficarra), and it's directed by a
first-timer, too (Lawrence Guterman)..

Title
Review for Shaft (2000)
It's tough to anticipate what to expect from a film with this much
baggage.  Throughout the production of Shaft  a remake/sequel of the
1971 blaxploitation film of the same name  reports surfaced almost
daily about ugly name-calling incidents between has-been director John
Singleton (Rosewood), star and Gardenburger pitchman Samuel L. Jackson
(Rules of Engagement) and cracker screenwriter Richard Price (Ransom).
The good news is that the theme song isn't messed up.  My greatest fear
was that on-his-fourteenth-minute-of-fame song-stealer Sean `No-Talent'
Combs would be tapped to hip the thing up with samples from Steppenwolf
and Kenny Rogers, in the way that frat-boy-date-rape rockers Limp Bizkit
ruined the M:I-2 theme.  The bad news is that the remake wasn't campy in
the slightest, which is how I would have approached the film - you know,
with really cheesy action sequences and bad guys with big, white top
hats, furry white coats, glass canes and ... wait; I'm describing P.
Diddy.  Shaft plays like a conventional action flick, which to me was
just disappointing.
The story involves a bar altercation where Walter Williams (Christian
Bale, American Psycho), the racist son of a New York City bigwig, offs a
young black man.  The case, which is caught by Detective John Shaft
(Jackson) hinges on the testimony of a waitress named Diane (Toni
Collette, The Sixth Sense) that may have witnessed the murder, but she
disappears.  Williams uses his connections to get a bargain-rate bail,
skips town and ends up in Switzerland.
The film flashes forward two years, where Shaft is still trying to hunt
down Diane, but catches wind that Williams is coming back to the
States.  Throw in a drug dealer named Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright,
Ride With the Devil), and you've got more story that an average action
film can probably handle.  You know this is the case when you realize
that Diane has been on the run for two years yet hasn't even left the
Bronx.  When Shaft is kicking ass, the film is great, but when he's not,
it really drags.  The resulting effect is a choppy and uneven viewing
experience.
On the plus side, ain't nobody in the world can say `motherfucker' like
Sammy J.  He's built a whole career around being able to deliver that
one word really well, and he throws it around quite often here.  I'd pay
twenty bucks just to have him say it right in my face.  Hell, it's
cheaper than an all-day pass to Six Flags, and probably at least twice
as scary as whatever their new ride is this year.  Can Jackson/Shaft
kick ass?  Lord, yes, but he could have kicked a lot more.  I would have
liked more fisticuffs as opposed to the standard gunplay that ran
rampant throughout the film.
Also worth mentioning are Collette's amazing Bronx accent (she's
Australian) and the hysterically over-the-top and nearly unrecognizable
performance from Wright, who may be one of the screen's best bad guys in
some time.  Bale nails his pretentious white prick role, but that seems
to be what everyone thinks about him anyway.  And big-mouth rapper Busta
Rhymes does an admirable job playing Shaft's wisecracking sidekick.
Also appearing in Shaft are Vanessa L. Williams (Light It Up), Dan
Hedaya (The Hurricane), Lee Tergesen (Oz), Gloria Reuben (ER) and
Richard Roundtree (Steel), the star of the original film, who plays
Shaft's Uncle John.

Review for Suzhou he (2000)
Just before Suzhou River unspooled at the Toronto International Film
Festival, a programmer described the film as Vertigo if it were directed
by Wong Kar-Wai.  It seemed like a silly statement to make and I
chuckled at the comparison as the lights went down.  An hour and a half
later, I walked out of the theatre in a delightful daze, wondering both
where Ye Lou came from and how he happened to make one of the year's
best films.
The film is set in Shanghai and takes place around the city's filthy
Suzhou River (hence the title).  The main character in Suzhou is a
hapless videographer whose identity is never revealed to the viewer.  We
never learn his name, and every scene he's in is filmed from his point
of view.  He spends his days spray-painting advertisements for his
struggling business around the city, and his nights are consumed by
watching videos.
The main character's lethargic nature seems to be due to a breakup with
Meimei (Xun Zhou, the blind girl from The Emperor and the Assassin), a
beautiful woman he met while he was filming the mermaid show at a bar
for one of his clients.  The film is full of flashbacks and replayed
conversations, like one haunting exchange where Meimei asks him if he'll
spend his whole life looking for her.  He says he will, but she doesn't
believe him.
A chance encounter seems to bring the main character back to life.  He
meets Mardar (Hongshen Jia), a bike messenger who has just been released
from prison.  Mardar served three years in the pokey for botching a
kidnapping attempt that he and his former girlfriend concocted to extort
money from her wealthy father.  Not only did he end up in the clink, but
his ex took a header off a bridge into the murky Suzhou after telling
him that she'd come back one day  as a mermaid.
If you've seen Vertigo, you can probably figure out that Mardar thinks
Meimei is his girlfriend (she's also played by Zhou).  Although
writer/director Ye Lou swears his film wasn't meant to be like
Hitchcock's classic, the parallels are unmistakable.  Mardar assumes the
Jimmy Stewart role, while Meimei plays the double role originally
handled by Kim Novak.
Ye Lou does an amazing job of establishing the dirty, claustrophobic
feel of both Shanghai and the gloomy, polluted Suzhou, which becomes
just as important as any of the film's characters.  You may have to go
out of your way to find it, but Suzhou is a film that should definitely
not be missed.

Title
Review for Simple Plan, A (1998)
Scott B. Smith adapted his best-selling novel for the screen and the
result, A Simple Plan (****), is not only one of the best films of the
year, but also a dark-horse candidate for a Best Picture nomination.
Hauntingly beautiful and brutally horrifying, the final reel creates a
level of tension (equaled this year only by David Mamet's The Spanish
Prisoner) that would have knocked Hitchcock's socks off.
Sam Raimi (The Quick and the Dead) directs this powerful tale of two
brothers who, together with a friend, find `the American Dream' - $4.4
million inside a plane that crashed in a wildlife preserve near their
home.  Like an incident played out earlier this year in Very Bad Things,
a group of ordinary men put into an extraordinary situation ask
themselves, `What if we don't call the police?'
Hank's (Bill Paxton) first reaction is to go to the authorities. Who
could blame him?  Of the three, he has the most to lose.  A respected
member of the community and college graduate, Hank is the only one with
a job  a dead-end position at the local feed and grain mill  and his
lovely young librarian wife, Sarah (Bridget Fonda), is expecting their
first child in a few days.  But older sibling Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton)
and his friend Lou, two unemployed dimwits that vie for the coveted
title of `town drunk,' finally talk the reluctant Hank into keeping the
loot.
Jacob and Lou's  plan is a simple one  hold on to the money, wait until
the spring and see if anyone comes looking for it once the plane is
discovered. Hank agrees, but under the conditions that they keep it a
secret and he retain the money in the interim.  Hank also threatens to
burn it all if he gets the slightest inkling that the authorities are on
to him.
Of course, Hank tells Sarah as soon as he gets home, and the next
morning she suggests a way to enhance the plan. She thinks that Hank
should take $500,000 back to the plane so that whoever finds it in the
spring won't believe anybody else had been there.  And he can't tell
Jacob because he would probably re-steal the $500,000 on his own. Sarah
tells her husband in an almost morose tone, `We'll have to be careful.
That's how we'll have to be from now on.'
Needless to say, this greed causes things to spin out of control very
quickly and very horribly.  Again, like in Very Bad Things, the picture
shows that the true nature of man is to do anything to cover his/her own
ass in an all-out attempt to grab whatever you can get your hands on.
At one point, Sarah tries to comfort Hank by telling him, `Nobody would
ever believe you're capable of doing what you've done.'  Now that's a
supportive wife, huh?
Strangely, the true conscience of A Simple Plan is Jacob.  The weight of
the big score and the resulting lying, cheating and murder has all but
crushed any remaining spirit that faintly flickered within him.
Completely drained, Jacob asks his younger brother in a particularly
moving scene, `Do you ever feel evil?'  He doesn't answer.  He doesn't
have to.
A Simple Plan is a virtually flawless film.  The acting is first-class 
Paxton (Mighty Joe Young) has never been better and the nearly
unrecognizable Thornton (Armageddon) is all but guaranteed an Oscar
nomination (as is Smith's screenplay).  Danny Elfman's creepy score is
perfect and Raimi's direction is also one of the year's best, bringing
to mind the previous snowy success of Fargo.  In fact, the Coen brothers
worked on Raimi's first feature (1983's Evil Dead) and aided him with
tips on how to shoot this film's bleak snow scenes properly.  Raimi also
effectively blends settings together with clips of a fox ravaging a hen
house.
Unnerving, almost to the point of viewer discomfort, A Simple Plan is a
brilliant example of what a modern thriller should be  dark, drab and,
most importantly, not Virus.

Review for Exorcist, The (1973)
It's been 27 years since The Exorcist forever changed the nation's
perception of pea soup.  The film, which was nominated for 10 Oscars,
including Best Picture, Best Director and three acting roles (it won for
sound and screenplay), allegedly caused some people to flee theatres in
a horrified panic.  But since its theatrical release in 1973, The
Exorcist has only been seen via badly edited TV versions and fading,
crusty old copies of the videotape.  The fact that the film spawned two
lousy sequels (one from The General's John Boorman, and one from The
Exorcist's author and screenwriter William Peter Blatty) didn't help
either.
Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, The Exorcist has been
restored with a cleaned-up picture, completely overhauled sound and
about a dozen additional minutes that didn't appear in the original
version (although some were on a recently released DVD).  But one
lingering question remains  will viewers today be as affected by the
film as they were back in 1973?
The answer is probably not.  The screening I attended was plagued with
mocking laughter and people leaving out of sheer boredom.  I should
mention that the screening was sponsored by a local `modern rock'
station, and most of the crowd was made up of young men and women that
have been weaned on a steady diet of slasher flicks that prominently
feature a grisly murder before the opening credits roll.
What these little douche bags don't understand is that you don't need a
high body count, gallons of fake blood and things making you jump every
five minutes to make a suspenseful film.  In fact, that's the alluring
part of The Exorcist.  Director William Friedkin (Rules of Engagement)
paces the film so slowly, the ending almost becomes a reward in
patience.
Just take the opening scene, where Friedkin takes a brief, five-page
epilogue from the book and audaciously transforms it into a 12-minute
segment that has little to do with the rest of the film.  In it, we are
introduced to Father Merrin (Max von Sydow, Snow Falling on Cedars) an
elderly priest on an archaeological dig in Northern Iraq.  He finds a
creepy idol (not unlike the one Greg had in The Brady Bunch's
multi-episode Hawaiian vacation) and begins to shake uncontrollably
while reaching for both the drink and his nitroglycerine pills.
Meanwhile, movie star Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn, Requiem For a Dream)
and her 12-year-old daughter Regan (Linda Blair) are temporarily living
in Georgetown while Chris shoots a film.  They rent a lovely home
(complete with a staff of three), but their lives are interrupted by a
demonic spirit that decides to take up residence in young Regan.
Thinking there is something physically wrong with her daughter, Chris
drags Regan to a bunch of clueless doctors that run a lot of pointless
tests before sending her off to a shrink.  It's really funny to watch
the doctors whip out cigarettes while they give cheesy explanations for
Regan's odd behavior (Ritalin is their treatment).  They blow smoke in
Chris' face while they blow smoke up her ass.
Looking for alternatives to medications and asylums, Chris turns to
Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, Rudy), a Jesuit priest and
psychiatrist struggling with his faith after the death of his mother.
Damian's freaky nightmare montage of his dead mother emerging from the
subway entrance is one of the best ever.
Friedkin takes his time developing the characters, which makes the
ending that much more emotional for the viewer.  It's over 30 minutes
before anything makes you jump, 45 before anything remotely supernatural
occurs, and an hour has passed before the real hijinks start.  The
spooky events are spaced far apart and grow more disturbing as the film
progresses.  You begin to dread each time Chris runs up the stairs and
into Regan's room.
Purportedly based on true events, The Exorcist was adapted from Blatty's
best-selling 1971 novel.  The film's acting, especially from Blair and
first-timer Miller, are fantastic.  At that year's Academy Awards, the
14-year-old Blair lost to 10-year-old Tatum O'Neal (Paper Moon).  The
redone sound is marvelous.  You can even hear the aquarium in Regan's
room, which is kind of exciting because you can barely tell she has an
aquarium in the tape at your local video store.

Review for Turandot Project, The (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
In 1997, conductor Zubin Mehta hired filmmaker Zhang Yimou (The Road Home)
to direct a lavish production of Giacomo Puccini's opera Turandot set in
Florence, Italy.  Mehta knew Zhang had no experience with opera but decided
he'd be able to create a more faithful version of the story, which takes
place in the Forbidden City of Beijing and in other productions usually
resembles the interior of a gaudy Chinese restaurant.
Turandot was a big hit in Italy, and somewhere along the way Mehta and Zhang
decided to take a stab at moving the production to the actual Forbidden
City.  The documentary film The Turandot Project shows the trials and
tribulations encountered en route to the opera's opening night in a country
that has often banned Zhang's films for being too politically subversive.
In other words, this is not another Blair Witch spoof.
Puccini's opera, which was unfinished at the time of his death, is set in
the Ming Dynasty and focuses on a princess who makes her eager suitors
answer three riddles.  If each isn't correctly solved, the man is killed.
It's a precarious situation to be in.just like the limb Zhang and Mehta find
themselves dangling from throughout the production.
There are the obvious things that you might expect to go wrong, like the
melding of Italian and Chinese crew and performers (there are translators
everywhere).  The two cultures meet, but hardly ever clash, except one
memorable battle between Zhang and an Italian lighting designer.  The
intricate costumes, which number in the thousands, needed a lot of
last-minute adjustments.  And since the Forbidden City is outside, a booming
thunderstorm can't be ruled out.
But Allan Miller's (Small Wonders) documentary is still plenty interesting.
I can't decide whether my favorite part was when a group of actual Chinese
soldiers were cast in the play but expressly forbidden from looking at any
of the ballerinas, or when the performing arts director explains how she's
sure she'll eventually end up with a lengthy prison sentence because of her
involvement in the production.  Oh, the good times they had.
If you're an opera fan and are familiar with Turandot, then you probably
should check this one out.  If you'd rather be drawn and quartered than even
walk past a building where an opera once took place, you probably should sit
this one out.

Review for Can't Hardly Wait (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Who would make a movie like this?  I guess the first place to look would
be the producer credit.  Go ahead, take a peek at it.  Jenno Topping?
Does that sound the slightest bit strange to you?  Maybe Jenno is a new
brand of ice cream and if you put some chocolate sprinkles on it, they
would be a Jenno Topping.  Perhaps it's a pseudonym to hide his real
identity.  And speaking of pseudonyms, the editor is named Michael
Jablow.  Nuff said.
Next check the director credit.  Yup, that's two names.  Can anyone name
a good movie that had two directors?  OK, two non-sibling directors -
the brothers Farrelly (Kingpin) and Hughes (Menace II Society) don't
count.  These two are making their directorial debut and have only A
Very Brady Sequel under their screenplay belt.  Why not let them run
loose on a soundstage with a bunch of money?
Can't Hardly Wait is one of those annoying coming-of-age pictures where
every character learns something important about themselves and,
occasionally, about those around them as well.  Set on the eve of the
affluent Huntington High graduation, Can't Hardly Wait offers nothing
that its predecessors hasn't, but has possibly broken new ground in
terms of underage drinking and teen sex.  And I'm not saying that's a
bad thing, either.
Of course, there is the obligatory graduation party thrown by the
obligatory girl who is afraid that her parent's house will be trashed.
There is also the obligatory nice guy (Embry, Vegas Vacation) who for
years has hidden his love of the obligatory prom queen (Love Hewitt,
Party of Five), who has been dating the obligatory jock (Facinelli)
throughout their four year high school interment.
You've also got your obligatory geek who becomes popular (William
Lichter), your obligatory `wigger' (Seth Green, Buffy the Vampire
Slayer) and your obligatory ugly duckling who ends up finding true love
(Ambrose, In & Out).  Strangely missing are the obligatory man-hating
lesbian and the obligatory boy-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks.  This
is OK with me because it kept the running time down to a stomachable
length.
What would make somebody decide to see a movie like this?  Take a look
at Love-Hewitt's rack and ask the question again.

Review for Diamonds (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Call it a pity film.  Call it a last hurrah for a Hollywood legend.
Call it what you want  it's still crap.  Diamonds stars
eighty-three-year-old Kirk Douglas, and the film opens with clips of his
Oscar-nominated turn in the 1959 film Champion.  Old clips of old glory
 for both Douglas and his character.
Douglas was never better in Champion, which, prior to Raging Bull, was
probably the finest boxing flick around.  He was nominated for Oscars
two other times but never won. Which brings us to the perplexing
Diamonds  a film that seems specifically made to give Douglas one last
shot at winning an Oscar.  Having suffered a serious stroke in 1995,
he'd certainly have the sympathy vote.  And with the film backed by the
Miramax Oscar juggernaut  well, we know what they're capable of.  But
then the film was released.  There is still a twinkle in his eye, but
Douglas has the acting range ofwell, of a guy that just had a serious
stroke.
Douglas plays Harry `The Polish Prince' Agensky, a former welterweight
fighter that raised himself from the depths of poverty to become the
champion of the world.  In 1994, Harry's beloved wife Ellie died, and
shortly after that he had a stroke that left him unable to speak.
Living in British Columbia with his son Moses (Kurt Fuller, Pushing
Tin), Harry is visited by his other son Lance (Dan Aykroyd, Blues
Brothers 2000) and teenage grandson Michael (Corbin Allred, Anywhere But
Here), who are en route to a vacation from San Francisco.  Thanks to
practicing daily with a videotaped speech coach, Harry is now able to
speak somewhat intelligibly.
Lance, an ornery, divorced newspaper columnist, is still upset over his
relationship with his dad, who was never around during his childhood.
Michael, however, instantly bonds with Harry, who explains that `a
stroke is God's way of making you shut up.'  Of course, if Harry were to
actually shut up, we would never find out about his crazy story of a
thrown fight and magic diamonds.  But no, there isn't a beanstalk  that
would have made the film entertaining.  Entertainment was obviously the
furthest thing from the minds of the filmmakers.
Long story short, Michael persuades Lance to let Harry come with them on
vacation.  They head for Reno, which makes no sense if you've gone to
British Columbia on the way from San Francisco.  Harry acts up, Lance
get embarrassed, and Michael shouts `Right on, Grandpa!' and `Grandpa,
you da man!' as his grandfather gets drunk, trashes hotel rooms and
punches people out.
There is a significant portion of the film that takes place in a
whorehouse, where characters played by Lauren Bacall (The Mirror Has Two
Faces) and Jenny McCarthy (Scream 3) are introduced.  Bacall, if you
remember, was the last victim of the whole
give-the-Oscar-to-the-faded-star-because-he/she-is-a-legend-that-has-never-won-before
syndrome (she was nominated but lost to The English Patient's Juliette
Binoche and looked extremely pissed off).  And how bad off is a film
when former Playmate McCarthy shows more range than the rest of your
actors?  But, then again, she's playing a hooker, so I'm not sure you
can even call what she's doing `acting.'
When Michael asks his grandpa if he is still in pain from the stroke,
Harry mumbles `frustrating,' which is just how you'll feel if you decide
to plunk down money to watch this film.  Diamonds was penned by
first-time screenwriter Allan Aaron Katz and directed by John Mallory
Asher (Kounterfeit).  The acting in the film is so bad that I actually
believe everyone was purposely horrible to make Douglas look better.

Review for But I'm a Cheerleader (1999)
If there was a contest where participants tried to make films in the
same vein as John Waters, But I'm A Cheerleader would be a resoundingly
unanimous winner.  There isn't one aspect of Cheerleader that seems
un-Waters-esque, from the casting, to its brash colors and sets, to the
film's subject matter.  And like a Waters film, Cheerleader is a light
comedy that has the foresight to end before it grows tiresome.
Natasha Lyonne (Detroit Rock City) stars as Megan, a Freemont High
School cheerleader that dates the hunky captain of the school's
playoff-bound football team.  She doesn't seem to enjoy playing tonsil
hockey with her beau, instead staring into space and envisioning the
spandex-covered nether regions of her fellow cheerleaders.  Her locker
is adorned with photographs of well-built women, but Megan doesn't seem
to notice her fondness for the same sex.
At home, Megan's conservative parents (Bud Cort, Dogma, and Mink Stole,
Pecker) nickname their only child `Poodle' but have mixed feelings about
her Melissa Etheridge poster and strict vegetarian/tofu diet.  So the
bible-thumpers call True Directions, a kind of boot camp to `cure'
homosexuality.  Armed with a catchy motto (`Straight is Great'), a True
Direction employee named Mike (played by drag queen RuPaul) arrives at
Megan's house for an intervention.
Despite her pleadings of heterosexuality, Mike eventually takes Megan
back to the TD headquarters.  Although TD offers a bizarre two-month,
five-step program to alleviate your homosexual urges, it unknowingly
promotes it.  Mike is an `ex-gay' who is so far out of the closet that
he's actually back in it.  TD's militant leader (Cathy Moriarty, Crazy
in Alabama) has a son with swishy tendencies (Eddie Cibrian, Third
Watch).  Everything at TD is colored in garish neon pink and blue.  The
women learn how to vacuum and clean rugs, while the boys chop wood and
repair engines.
While most of the critics are bashing Cheerleader for its bawdy,
stereotypical humor, the film went over amazingly well at a benefit
screening I attended for ImageOut, a local gay and lesbian group.  If
you check your political correctness at the door, Cheerleader is a
hoot.  Lyonne shows a cunning talent in physical comedy, and her
performance pushes what could have been a mediocre film to a hilarious
success.
Cheerleader's supporting roles are pretty good, too, especially Melanie
Lynskey (Detroit Rock City) and Clea DuVall (Girl Interrupted), the
latter of whom plays a moody teen inmate again.  Jamie Babbit
(television's Popular) directs from Brian Wayne Peterson's debut
script.  Also worth mentioning is Rachel Kamerman kitschy production
design.

Review for Three to Tango (1999)
In the good old days it used to take television stars years to make the
big move to the silver screen, and this film is a prime example of why.
It's one thing to repeat your catch phrase or to raise your eyebrow and
wait for the studio audience's laughter to subside for twenty-three
minutes, but entirely another thing to stretch your already marginal
appeal into a feature-length film.  Ever since Helen Hunt won an Oscar
while still starring in a failing television sitcom, Hollywood has tried
to mine talent from the lesser medium.  This should be seen as a
disturbing trend, since sitcom producers seem to only create shows
around vaguely capable one-trick ponies in a rehash of their stand-up
routines.
In Three to Tango, there are not one, not two, but three leads that
still are on the silver screen's ugly stepchild.  It's a mish-mash of a
30s screwball comedy and a traditional love triangle, with a gay twist
for the 90s.  The story isn't anything new  a wealthy man (Dylan
McDermott) doesn't trust his girlfriend (Neve Campbell) while he isn't
around, finds a non-threatening guy (Matthew Perry) to keep her company,
and is surprised when the two fall in love.
McDermott (The Practice) plays Charles Newman, a married business tycoon
that has been placed in charge of hiring an architecture team to oversee
a prestigious $90 million museum restoration project in downtown
Chicago.  As the film opens we see that there are two design teams vying
for the illustrious undertaking  the upscale firm of Strauss & Decker
(respectively Bob Balaban, Jakob the Liar and John C. McGinley, Office
Space) and the protagonist upstarts Oscar Novak (Perry, Friends) and
Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt, Lake Placid).  Strauss and Decker bat
first, dazzling Newman with both a big-budget presentation and
accusations that their competitors are homosexuals.  Although their
display isn't quite as mind-blowing, Newman likes Novak and Steinberg
enough to hold a showdown between the two partnerships, with the creator
of the best model declared the winner of the project.
Enter Amy (Campbell, Party of Five), Newman's girlfriend deemed
untrustworthy by him.  Since he thinks Novak is gay, Newman asks him to
look after Amy and to make sure she doesn't become involved with any
other men.  Since his career is in Newman's hands, the nebbish Novak
agrees, despite his obvious attraction to her.  Once he begins to fall
in love with Amy, Novak's alleged alternative lifestyle becomes public
news as he is featured in a newspaper article titled `Proud to be Gay.'
You can figure the rest out on your own  Amy thinks Novak is gay, so
she changes in front of him and tells him all of her secrets and
desires.  They share many close, private moments, like simultaneously
vomiting up bad tuna melts.  But Novak just sits there and looks like a
lizard with a bad haircut.  The film's gay stereotypes are unimaginative
and probably offensive as well, with the audience likely questioning the
sexuality of each character.  Who is?  Who isn't?  Who cares?  Although
the film is advertised with three leads, McDermott's character all but
disappears for a good portion of the film.  And by `good portion,' I
don't mean the good part.  I mean the majority part.
Campbell's performance is almost refreshing, compared to her bland roles
in the Scream trilogy and the moody Julia on P.O.F.  Her squeaky voice
seems about two octaves higher than usual and conjures up memories of
former Fox Wednesday night co-star Jennie Garth as she tries to sound
sexy by making cute little bunny noises.  Perry is basically Chandler on
a really bad hair day and McDermott is practically invisible, leaving me
to wish there was more Oliver Platt in the film.
If you look at the track record of the film's stars, this disappointing
result won't be a surprise.  Perry's two films, Almost Heroes and Fools
Rush In, grossed less than what he makes for one episode of Friends.
McDermott is even worse, and his previous two movies, 'Til There was You
and Destiny Turns on the Radio, performed even more poorly.  On the
other hand, Campbell made more than both combined for figuratively
dining on tuna melt in Wild Things, not to mention starring in the
blockbuster Scream flicks.  But she's hardly box office gold on her own
(read: without either a hot script or a hot lesbian scene).
There is one scene where Amy and Novak discuss the use of the line
`Let's get outta here' in modern cinema, deciding that that could be the
response to just about any line delivered by any actor at any point in
any movie.  I also used this line as a suggestion to everybody sitting
around me after about twenty minutes of Tango.

Title
Review for Way of the Gun, The (2000)
The directorial debut from The Usual Suspect Oscar-winner screenwriter
is wildly derivative and painfully uneven, but The Way of the Gun is
still an extremely stylish crime flick that is a lot more entertaining
and original than most big Hollywood action films released this summer.
I lost count of how many films Gun reminded me of, but that was probably
because the outrageous amount of thunderous gunplay kept distracting me
from my tally.
Gun's opening scene may be the best I've seen this year, and it does a
great job establishing the film's two main characters, who we learn go
by the phony names Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro, Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas) and Parker (Ryan Phillippe, Cruel Intentions).  Using The Rolling
Stones `Rip This Joint' and a cacophony of side-splitting vulgarities,
Longbaugh and Parker open a Sam's Club-size can of whoop ass on a nerdy
guy with hair like Columbian soccer star Carlos Valderamma.
Longbaugh and Parker are small-time hoods looking for the big score that
would lead to a life of luxury, and, thanks to overhearing a telephone
conversation while making a sperm bank deposit, they catch wind of an
unusual situation.  It seems there is a wealthy couple that wanted to
have a baby, but the wife didn't want to be inconvenienced with a
nine-month pregnancy.  The result is a surrogate mother named Robin
(Juliette Lewis, The Other Sister), who is carrying the baby to term and
will, theoretically, hand the kid over to the proud parents once it's
born.  Longbaugh and Parker learn that the proxy mother is getting a
cool million for being the baby's temporary host, so they figure the
parents will pay much more if both Robin and the unborn child are
kidnapped.
The doctor's office kidnapping scene is a thing of beauty, showing that
Longbaugh and Parker definitely know their craft.  The two men are
pursued by two of Robin's hired bodyguards (Taye Diggs, House on Haunted
Hill and Nicky Katt, Boiler Room), who could have been a young version
of Jules and Vincent from Pulp Fiction.  One of the most inventive car
chase scenes follows, and before long, Longbaugh and Parker learn that
the baby's father is a very powerful crime lord named Chidduck (Scott
Wilson, Clay Pigeons).
The rest of Gun is packed full of all of the backstabbing,
double-crossing and secret identities that you'd expect from the guy
that wrote Suspects.  There isn't a big sucker-punch ending like
Suspects, but there are smaller ones that occur more frequently
throughout the film.  Some of Gun's best scenes involve Joe Sarno (James
Caan, Mickey Blue Eyes), Chidduck's cool bagman who reminded me a lot of
Harvey Keitel's `cleaner' in Fiction, or even Barry Newman in The
Limey.  In fact, Chidduck lived in a well protected home in the hills,
just like Peter Fonda's character in The Limey.  The big shoot-em-up
finale looked like it could have been an outtake from Deperado.
Interestingly, there is one scene in Gun where a car radio plays a
barely audible news report about somebody named `Singer' involved with
underage boys and a shower.  The blurb is an obvious reference to
director Bryan Singer and the hot water he landed in while filming
several naked young teenagers in Apt Pupil.  Singer also directed the
McQuarrie-penned Suspects and, most recently, topped the box office
charts with X-Men, a film that McQuarrie was rumored to have had a major
hand in writing as well.

Review for Lost in Space (1998)
Imagine countries from around the world, united together in building an
expensive hunk of space crap to send people into a previously uncharted
world to help save all of humanity.  The voyage is quickly sabotaged and
ultimately ruined by a maniacal crackpot.  No, I'm not talking about
Contact or even The Real World 9.  This is the big screen version of the
campy 60's television series, Lost in Space.
It all happens in the year 2058, a year which finds our planet on the
verge of environmental ruin.  There is no clean water to drink and
fossil fuels are practically non-existent.  Our only saving grace is in
the distant planet, Alpha Prime, which has a similar climate and whatnot
to Earth.  The plan (called The Jupiter Project) is to blast the
Robinson family off on a ten-year journey to Alpha Prime, where they
will build a transport back to earth, thusly making future travel much
quicker.
Sounds easy?  It probably would have been if it weren't for the meddling
Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman, The Fifth Element).  He sneaks aboard the
Robinson craft in an attempt to reprogram the ship's robot to destroy
the mission.  But, in the biggest example of intergalactic irony since
Heston saw the Statue of Liberty at the end of Planet of the Apes, Smith
ends up a stowaway aboard the now undermined vessel.  Jesus, that almost
sounded like a Dennis Miller line.
After the Earth family Robinson retreat to their sleep pods, the robot
comes to life, destroys all navigational systems and a bunch of other
very crucial things before it's stopped in one of the most harrowing
robot-gone-out-of-control scenes since Robocop.  It's too late to save
the mission as the ship has been thrown way off course.
Of course, the Robinson family is too damn resourceful to give up that
easily.  They seemed too perfectly assembled, kind of like the cast of
The A-Team.  Each one is an expert in something, but I can't remember
what they all were.  Actually, my memory became rather hazy after I saw
Judy Robinson (Heather Graham, Boogie Nights) in her gleefully tight
spacesuit.  (Editor's Note: If you would like to see more of the woman
that PLANET SICK-BOY has named `The Most Beautiful American Actress -
1997', watch her eat up the screen in Two Girls and a Guy)
I do remember that there is a really cool scene where the ship goes into
hyper-drive.  And I remember being really pissed of about a CG monkey
that they found on an abandoned craft.  I also remember that the picture
seemed about forty minutes too long, but I don't remember caring.
Writer Akiva Goldsman, occasionally a capable adapter of John Grisham
books (The Client, A Time to Kill) but primarily the dunderhead who
ruined the Batman franchise, has crafted a likeable story that's a bit
long in the tooth, but doesn't frivolously waste valuable screen time
(save the stupid monkey).  Big kudos to Production Designer Norman
Garwood (Brazil) for making one of the coolest spaceships ever.
Of the actors, TV's Joey (Matt LeBlanc, Friends) and Claudia (Lacey
Chabert, Party of Five) stand out in the only roles that stray from the
usual casting.  There were also supposed to be a bunch of cameos from
people who were in the original TV series, but I'm way too young to have
ever seen it, so I don't know who they were.

Review for Gift, The (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you charted the success of Sam Raimi's films on a graph, it would
look like a big `W.'  He started with the deliciously diabolical Evil
Dead trilogy and the first Darkman film, only to follow them up with the
extremely disappointing The Quick and the Dead.  Raimi rebounded with
the amazing A Simple Plan, but then, in a surprise to the director's
fans, he decided to make a baseball film with Kevin Costner.  Baseball?
Kevin Costner?  Fool me once (Bull Durham), shame on you.  Fool me twice
(Field of Dreams), shame on me.  Fool me three times (For Love of the
Game), and you'd better be wearing some kind of protection over your
private parts.
Luckily, Raimi's latest film, a welcome return to the frightening fare
that made him famous, is a big step in the right direction (his next
project is the new Spider-Man film).  The Gift is a nifty little
thriller with a terrific cast full of recent Oscar winners and nominees,
highlighted by a strong performance from Cate Blanchett (The Talented
Mr. Ripley).  Raimi proves he can still make with the creepy, but The
Gift has the misfortune of following three of the best hair-raisers in
quite some time (What Lies Beneath, The Sixth Sense and The Blair Witch
Project).  It's moody, atmospheric and, at times, downright unnerving,
but The Gift just isn't in the same league.
The film's first five minutes establish Annie Wilson (Blanchett) as a
recently widowed single mother with three children who live in the
swampy Georgia burg of Brixton.  She's a psychic, but more of a social
worker to her customers than a carnival sideshow act.  Annie prods
people to call their doctors when she sees something in her tarot cards
that indicate a medical problem.  When one client (Hilary Swank, Boys
Don't Cry) appears to have been beaten by her husband, Annie desperately
tries to talk her into leaving the brute (Keanu Reeves, The
Replacements).  She is admired and respected by the people she helps and
regarded as a bride of Satan/witch doctor/voodoo high priestess by the
rest of the redneck town.
The Gift's story, co-written by Plan's Oscar-nominated actor Billy Bob
Thornton and his One False Move and A Family Thing writing partner Tom
Epperson, centers on the disappearance of a local girl named Jessica
(Katie Holmes, Wonder Boys), who is engaged to the school principal
(Greg Kinnear, Loser) and the daughter of a prominent businessman.  Like
Laura Palmer, Jessica was a hot, young nymphomaniac, doing pretty much
every guy in Brixton, and eventually her nude carcass is discovered in a
body of water.  And, like Twin Peaks, Brixton is a town full of kooky
suspects, each of which seem to have a motive in Jessica's murder.
There's enough red herring here to fill Brixton's swamp.
Showing he's no stranger to the horror genre, Raimi fills The Gift with
enough of Annie's unnerving flashes forward and backward to keep you on
the edge of your seat.  When you can feel the tension in an audience
rise by a character simply drawing a bath, you know the director is
doing something right.  There is an awkward courtroom scene that feels
out of place, but, for the most part, Raimi does a very good job keeping
the somewhat clunky story moving along.  The supporting cast does well
(even Keanu) and seems to be having a pretty good time acting like
hillbillies (look for Danny Elfman in a two-second cameo as a
fiddle-playing hayseed).  But The Gift is as much Blanchett's film to
carry as it is Raimi's.  And they both do a splendid job.

Review for Requiem for a Dream (2000)
In 1998, first-time filmmaker Darren Aronofsky set the entertainment
industry on its ear when his $60,000 ? took the Director's Award at the
Sundance Film Festival.  The grainy 8mm black-and-white film, which was
about a super-genius mathematician who found a 216-digit pattern in the
world that could both predict the stock market and reveal the true name
of God, jettisoned Aronofsky into the upper echelon of young, hip and
talented directors ready to be seduced and corrupted by the Hollywood
system (he's supposed to be making the next Batman installment).
The temptation to make a bigger and better film must have been
incredible.  Imagine having a budget nearly 100 times larger, as well as
the ability to cast well-known acting talent as opposed to friends and
family.  The result is Requiem For a Dream, a frighteningly dark look at
addictions in modern society.  It's a good film, and it's certainly
bigger than ?, but unfortunately, it's just not better.
The film is set in present-day New York City near Coney Island, where a
middle-aged mother and her junkie son regularly square off over the
television set.  Harry (Jared Leto, American Psycho) keeps taking the
appliance to a pawnshop to support his heroin addiction.  Sara (Ellen
Burstyn, Playing by Heart) is tired of buying her set back from the same
pawnbroker.
Harry's friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans, Scary Movie) and girlfriend Marion
(Jennifer Connelly, television's The $treet) are hopheads as well.  They
figure out a way to make a bunch of money from a really big drug score,
but their plan goes awry.  Like big drug scores ever go down correctly
in the movies.
In the meantime, Sara is just as addicted to television as her son is to
smack.  Sara particularly loves this one game show, and her life is
thrown into disarray when she receives a phone call telling her that
she's been chosen to be a contestant.  She dyes her hair and digs out a
flashy red dress that can no longer be completely zipped.  Long story
short, Sara ends up strung out on prescription diet pills, thanks to an
unscrupulous doctor.
So you've got four characters hopped up on various chemicals.  Can the
gifted Aronofsky capably handle hallucination scenes?  Oh, Lord, yes.
They're the slickest since Trainspotting (although they aren't set to
Lou Reed and Iggy Pop songs).  Aronofsky uses so many different filming
techniques (split-screen, fish-eye lenses, altered playback speeds,
scene repetition and even cameras strapped to his actors) that Requiem
often feels like an all-out assault on the senses (but in a much better
way than, say, Armageddon).  Don't attempt to adjust the picture.
Turning around and heaving popcorn at the projection booth won't stop
Requiem from damaging your tender eyes.
Actingwise, Requiem is a one-man show.  Burstyn is incredible as the
tormented Sara.  If she fails to get an Oscar nomination, there should
be rioting in the streets.  She should get the award for one scene
alone, where she's simultaneously being hypnotized by the television and
chased by the refrigerator.  Interestingly enough, October is a banner
month for the 67-year-old actress.  In addition to knocking them dead in
Requiem, she's lighting up the box office with the re-release of The
Exorcist, and stars in That's Life, one of the better-reviewed
television shows debuting this fall.
On the other side of the acting coin are Leto and Connelly.  Although
they're both pretty easy on the eyes, their talent remains very much in
question.  Connelly's greatest asset is widely believed to be her chest,
which is usually more prominently displayed than her acting chops.  Leto
tries out a New York accent here, but mainly just offers more of the
same blank stares that made him so popular as the dim-witted Jordan
Catalano on My So-Called Life.  Guess what, kids?  He wasn't acting.
How does a guy with talent this marginal keep getting cast in cool, edgy
films, like American Psycho, Fight Club and The Thin Red Line?  Wayans
is nearly unrecognizable as Tyrone, but that's probably because it's his
first role where he isn't acting like a retard.
The plot isn't much to write home about.  Most people already know that
a drug addiction can do a pretty good job of messing up your life
without having cinema cramming a similar message down their throats.
Requiem is based on a novel written by Hubert Selby, Jr. (he also wrote
the book that became Last Exit to Brooklyn) and adapted for the screen
by Aronofsky and Selby.  The story follows four characters to ? s one,
and Aronofsky seems to have a bit of trouble with the pacing of the film
because of it.  But just when it seems like Requiem is about to derail,
the director tosses in an unexplainably cool, repetitive clip of the
three kids cooking up their stuff and getting bent.
Requiem was photographed by Matthew Libatique (Pi) and edited by Jay
Rabinowitz (Ghost Dog), the latter of whom is probably deserving of some
year-end accolades, as well.  The film contains one of the more sexually
explicit scenes you'll see in a mainstream film (featuring  surprise! 
Ms. Connelly).  This one is definitely not for the kids, the faint of
heart, or people who suffer from epilepsy.

Review for Other Sister, The (1999)
There are certain rules in Hollywood involving the portrayal of romantic
relationships on the big screen.  Certain combinations of leads
naturally go together  handsome men and beautiful women being the
predominant pairing.  Lately, a trend has emerged involving cute young
adult males and lovable teenage females (usually with shows on Fox or
the WB) and, once in a while, moviegoers are treated to the unlikely
affairs of rickety old men and chicks half their age.  Stars are always
fit, have great teeth, skin and hair, and are usually white.
Films that stray from these templates of success are generally
resounding box office failures.  Why?  Because people won't line up for
Number 18 with Hunan Foot, the touching story of a Chinese guy with a
really large head who falls in love with a 70-year-old lady leper.  They
will also reject Mommy, I'm Taller Than Daddy, starring a middle-aged
single mom with a huge raised birthmark on her face and her lucky find 
a midget with one eyebrow and a cowlick.
Howard Stern has made a career out of shining a spotlight on those
aforementioned oddities.  Until now, if you wanted to hear a drunk
dwarf, paranoid stutterers or alien lesbians, Howard was the only place
to go.  Hollywood could only ignore his phenomenal ratings for so long.
So, along comes The Other Sister (* 1/2), a film that bills itself as `a
romantic comedy for the emotionally challenged.'  Translation  a love
story about two retards.  They meet.  They fall in love.  The have a
fight.  They get back together.  They get married.  And they drive off
with their car dragging a `Just Lobotomized!' sign.  Okay, I made that
last part up, but it would have been more original than anything in
Sister's tiresome script.
The film opens with Carla (Juliette Lewis, Natural Born Killers) having
just graduated from the Roselake, a school for mentally-challenged
children.  Carla flies home to San Francisco, where her father (Tom
Skerritt) and overbearing mother (Diane Keaton) seem intent on keeping
her at home under a watchful eye.  They live in a giant house with a
live-in maid and a gate, so one has to wonder why they didn't just lock
her in the attic.  Like the Kennedys.
But Carla has other plans.  She wants to enroll in a public vocational
school.  Her parents say no but eventually give in.  She wants her own
apartment.  Her parents say no but eventually give in.  She wants a
boyfriend.  Her parents say no buthey!  Are you tired of reading this
yet?  Try sitting through 130 minutes of it.
Lewis is remarkably unremarkable as Carla.  But, then again, Carla isn't
too far off of the roles that she usually plays.  Her love interest
Daniel (Giovanni Ribisi, Saving Private Ryan) is much better, but also
not much different from his recurring role of Phoebe's brother on
Friends.  Actually, the only difference is fake teeth.  Keaton's mother
is purposefully and pleasantly annoying while Skerritt is just plan
scary sans facial hair.
Sister was written and directed by Garry Marshall, who hit the big time
with 70s television shows like Mork and Mindy and Laverne & Shirley.
His resume as of late boasts the blockbusters Dear God and Exit to
Eden.  This is the first script he has written since 1984's The Flamingo
Kid, proving that writing must not be like riding a bike.  But, hey  if
you watch with your eyes closed, it sounds just like Howard.

Review for Swept from the Sea (1997)
A two-hour period film based on an old novel set in England about a
forbidden love affair between a reserved girl who doesn't like to talk
and a man who can't speak her language.  Yawn!
OK, it's not really THAT bad.  Swept From The Sea is the latest Joseph
Conrad novel adapted to the silver screen.  The results can range from
sublime (Apocalypse Now/Heart Of Darkness) to mundane (last year's The
Secret Agent) and Swept slumps somewhere between the two.
The story begins in the Ukraine, where a tiny village is celebrating
because one of its sons, Yanko Gooral (Vincent Perez), is going to take
a trip on the big boat to find his dream in America.  Things proceed as
planned until the ship sinks off the shore of Colebrook, England.  This
seemed intense before I saw Titanic.
In a pretty cool scene, the citizens of Colebrook wake to find dozens of
bloated bodies washed up onto its shore.  They assume that there are no
survivors and seem to quick forget about the incident after they bury
the lot.  Call me crazy, but I'd be pretty emotionally scarred after
seeing the likes of that.
Yanko, of course, is the only person to live and he stumbles upon the
Smith family house, where Amy Foster (Rachel Weisz) works on occasion as
a servant.  Now Amy, who is named after Conrad's novel, is very
introverted and shows no emotion.  This is probably due to her parents
treating her like she had the Bubonic plague.  Her only enjoyment in
life is to sit in her secret little cave and watch the water break on
the shore.
The two hit it off right away, but the townsfolk are quite literally
frightened of this dirty longhair that speaks in crazy tongues.  Amy
sneaks Yanko food and water while he is locked up in the Smith's barn,
even though the locals deem him dangerously unapproachable.  It isn't
until Dr. Kennedy (Sir Ian McKellan) discovers that Yanko isn't actually
spouting nonsense, but actually speaking another language.  The
villagers are still suspicious.
The rest is all pretty standard fare, but is beautifully shot by Dick
Pope, who photographs most of Mike Leigh's films.  The rolling green
hills and jagged cliffs that overlook the ocean are breathtaking.  I
believe it was filmed in Cornwall, England.  Director Beeban Kidron can
add this film to her previous mediocre effort To Wong Foo, Thanks For
Everything, Julie Newmar.
The acting is pretty goodfor a guy that can't speak English and an
emotionless girl.  Perez (The Crow: City Of Angels) cleans up well in
his rags-to-nicer rags part, while Weisz is nearly mesmerizing in a
quiet, unassuming way.  Think a shorter, less dumb-looking Liv Tyler.
And now she can be known for something besides naked girl by the pool in
Stealing Beauty or running girl in Chain Reaction.  Both leads needed
breakout roles, but these probably are not them.  The supporting roles,
however, are handled quite well.
For the most part, a recommendation of any movie with a male character
named `Yanko' is probably a long shot.

Title
Review for Place Vendôme (1998)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
For the ignorant, 2000 may not have been the best year for film.  The
subtitled Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon destroyed records for both box
office take and Academy Award nominations.  Fellow Best Picture nominee
Traffic contains more than a few segments that feature non-English dialogue.
One could even argue that Chocolat, another Best Picture contender, should
have been filmed in French (it's not like Juliette Binoche is unfamiliar
with the language).  Some bewildered moviegoers have thrown up their hands
in frustration, saying things like, "I wanna see that there picture about
the flying lions and the ducking tigers, but the durn thing ain't in
American, Cletus."
Don't expect ol' Cletus to be in the ticket line with you for Place Vendôme
(unless inbreeding has suddenly created a race of hillbillies with a
fondness for subtle French noir).  The film was released over two years ago
in Europe, where it was a smash sensation, garnering star Catherine Deneuve
a Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival and racking up an
impressive 12 César nominations (the French equivalent of the Oscar).
Vendôme takes its name from a ritzy area in Paris known for being the home
of several of the world's most prestigious jewelry stores.  Deneuve (Dancer
in the Dark) plays Marianne, the alcoholic wife of one of Vendôme's biggest
diamond merchants.  Vincent (Bernard Fresson) accepts the fact that his wife
is a lush who spends most of her time in clinics, trotting her out in public
a few times each year for special occasions.
When the film opens, Vincent has, through some undetermined yet devious
means, obtained several large, valuable diamonds.  One night, he shows a
drunken Marianne the stones and their hiding place, and then kills himself
the following day.  She learns that their jewelry store is on the verge of
bankruptcy and that Vincent has been having an affair with a woman (The
Ninth Gate's Emmanuelle Seigner) who could be a younger version of Marianne
(literally, in one flashback).
The rest of Vendôme shows Marianne pulling herself together to use the
illicitly obtained jewels to free herself from the shady underworld of
international diamond trading.  She's kind of like the Catherine Zeta-Jones
character in Traffic, doing what she has to do to protect her own future, no
matter how crooked or underhanded.  Marianne uses old contacts and ex-lovers
to weave her way through the rough jewelry trade racket - a game in which
everyone's goal is to out-con each other.  Reputable dealers won't touch
Marianne's booty, leaving her to deal with seedy characters in hotel rooms.
Vendôme isn't a typical film about stolen jewels.  There isn't a lick of
action, and its slow, methodical pace may frighten off those who weren't
already scared by the subtitles.  Like any deliberately sluggish film that's
worth watching, Vendôme is held together by the very strong performance of
its star.  Sure, I'd probably watch Deneuve read a phonebook for two hours,
but France's national treasure is terrific in her subtly restrained and
underplayed role.  Not a lot of people could have pulled it off, but she
does, and, as always, with style.
Vendôme was written and directed by French actress Nicole Garcia, who penned
the script with Jacques Fieschi (The School of Flesh).  Film buffs may
notice that Fresson and Deneuve also played husband and wife 30 years ago in
Bunuel's Belle de Jour.

Title
Review for Entrapment (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
I had two good ways to start off my review for Entrapment but couldn't
decide on which to use.
There is the more obvious approach: Goofing on the studio's tagline for
the film - `The trap is set' - by saying something clever, like that the
`bait' is its two charismatic leads and the `trap' is an utterly
implausible story, with unsuspecting viewers being snared by its star
power and eye-popping trailer.
Then there is the more polished route: Taking a piece of dialogue from
the film and then turning it around to poke fun at the filmmakers, who
obviously felt that this particular chunk of babble was so important
that it had to be repeated a few times - like `First we try, then we
trust.'  I could say that potential moviegoers might use this wisdom to
decide whether to fork over seven bucks to see a film that was directed
by the guy who filmed the Bill Murray bomb The Man Who Knew Too Little
(not to mention the producer of 1999's worst film, Simply Irresistible)
and written by the guy responsible for four consecutive bore-fests (My
Best Friend's Wedding, How Stella Got Her Groove Back, What Dreams May
Come and Stepmom).
The film opens just weeks before the millenium during the high-tech
robbery of a heavily guarded office in a New York City skyscraper.  The
bandit makes off with a Botticelli painting, but has a sense of humor
and leaves a velvet painting of Elvis in its stead.  The cagey thief
jams the rolled-up masterpiece into a mailing tube  addressed to Kuala
Lumpur  and drops it down the building's mail chute.
The brigand is believed to be super-criminal Robert `Mack' MacDougal
(Sean Connery, The Avengers), an aging villain known for his daring
larceny who has been hunted for years by a company that insures high
prices of art around the world.  Legend has it that years ago, two if
its employees were sent to apprehend Mack and were never heard from
again.  Mysterious, eh?
Catherine Zeta-Jones (The Mask of Zorro) is an employee of this
insurance company, as well as a limber gymnast and a bit of an
aficionado of the Mack legacy.  She convinces her boss (Will Patton, The
Postman) to let her go after Mack, but are her intentions to entrap the
unscrupulous burglar, or to join him in the biggest robbery that the
world has ever seen?  You won't find out who's playing whom until the
end.
While Entrapment is not particularly bad, it does offer plot holes
bigger than Dionne Warwick's nostrils.  Case in point: Viewers won't
have a clue what Zeta-Jones' character is named until about two-thirds
of the way into the film, when Mack calls to her.  And even then, you're
not sure what he said.  Jen?  Gem?  Jed?  It's actually Gin  as in
Virginia  but you get the idea.
And how about the part where Gin and Mack steal an ancient Chinese mask
from a room guarded with several dozen security lasers?  Sure, it's
suspenseful  Gin has only three minutes to maneuver through the
grid-like maze, make off with the mask and get out  but it takes her
2:25 just to get to the booty, leaving only 35 seconds to escape.
Viewers don't get to see the escape, but I'm sure must have been quite
dazzling.  Maybe the picture was running too long and that part had to
be cut out.  Hey, you've gotta cut something.
The ending is also exciting, involving a risky $8 billion heist at the
International Clearance House Bank in Malaysia, but this stuff has all
been done better before.  Even in 1992's Sneakers, starring another guy
who seemed too old to be getting himself into trouble (Robert Redford,
who was still decades younger than Connery is now).  On the positive
side, Entrapment isn't bogged down by silly subplots  there are very
few characters in the film  and its action sequences are capably lensed
by Philip Meheux (The Mask of Zorro).  Ving Rhames (Out of Sight)
provides big laughs as Mack's confidante and tech supplier, while Maury
Chaykin (Mouse Hunt) has a very hammy role as a Kuala Lumpur fencer of
incredibly valuable `hot' pieces of art.  His character would not have
handled this film.

Title
Review for Princess Diaries, The (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Garry Marshall really, really wants to make his Pretty Woman again.  And why
wouldn't he?  The Cinderella update was the last hit he had, even though it
was pure drivel.  Marshall tried to recreate the smelly magic via the
re-teaming of Julia and Richard in the equally idiotic Runaway Bride a
couple of years back, and now he's made what amounts to a Woman sequel with
a gangly teenager replacing the hooker with a heart of gold (it is, after
all, a Disney film).
The Princess Diaries stars Anne Hathaway (TV's Get Real) as Mia Thermopolis,
a 10th grade nerd who has lived with her artist mother (Caroline Goodall) in
an old San Francisco firehouse for all of her 15 years.  Though she's a
likeable lass, Mia is ugly enough to make dogs bark (and curdle milk, to
boot), with thick locks of frizzy Greek hair and eyebrows bigger than Andy
Rooney's.
It takes about 30 seconds to establish Mia as an outsider at her school (she
pukes during a debate), as well as clarify which boy she likes now (Erik von
Detten), the boy she'll end up liking in about 90 minutes (Robert
Schwartzman), and the popular girl who will eventually get her comeuppance
(pop sensation Mandy Moore.)  As haplessly geeky and ostracized as she is,
it's pretty obvious Mia will end up looking like a hot cover girl.  How
unattractive do the filmmakers expect us to believe she is?  She wears a
Catholic school uniform, and, well, you know what they say about Greek
girls.
Mia's life is turned upside-down when her grandmother (Julie Andrews) hits
town and reveals a rather large family secret.  It turns out that Mia's
granny is the Queen of Genovia, making her deceased father a Prince.  Mia is
the last of the bloodline, and Genovia will, for some reason, cease to exist
unless she steps into the royal shoes by her sixteenth birthday.  Genovia,
in case you were wondering, is right between Canadia and Chlamydia and is
famous for its pears.
What follows is perhaps the most startling on-screen transformation since
that frumpy FBI agent turned into a beauty queen in Miss Congeniality.  Mia
attends "princess classes" with her grandmother and a friendly bodyguard
(Marshall regular Hector Elizondo) every day after school, submits to the
obligatory makeover scene (performed by an uncredited Larry Miller) and -
presto change-o - she emerges as the drop-dead gorgeous girl we all knew
lived in those clunky combat boots.  The new Mia starts to isolate her best
friend (Heather Matarazzo) on the way to the throne, but hey - she's just a
serf now, right?
As ridiculous as the whole thing sounds, Diaries is carried on the
surprisingly capable shoulders of Hathaway.  She's a real charmer, and even
though it seems like she's got the Julia dial cranked up to 11, the film
clicks because of her performance.  Andrews also does well in her biggest
role in years (I thought she was Glenn Close the first few time I saw the
trailer).  Even MTV poster-girl Moore does a pretty decent job, but
remember, she's been acting for years (acting like she hasn't been plowed by
every guy in sight is still acting).
The most surprising thing about Diaries is its incredible potential to make
the leap from G-rated Disney territory to a tawdry teen sex romp.  There's
one spankworthy scene in which Mia rolls around in the back of her limousine
while trying to put stockings on underneath her plaid Catholic school skirt.
Another has her smearing ice cream all over Moore's ample chest, and there's
even a potentially interesting subplot involving a female gym teacher who,
literally, almost shouts, "What am I; a dyke?" (she says "duck," but still.)
Andrews' real-life granddaughter is a porn star who uses the name "Mary
Poppins" (yes, there is a lawsuit), but the topper is the inclusion of DJs
Mark and Brian in one scene.  That's right - Howard Stern wannabes in a
Disney film.  Call me Henny Penny, but I think the sky might be falling.

Title
Review for Next Best Thing, The (2000)
     Can it really have been 2 long years since THE OBJECT OF MY
AFFECTION made us laugh and cry with its tale of two best friends (an
unlucky in love gal and her gay male roommate) and how they decide to
have a baby together?  Er... so we didn't laugh.  And we didn't cry.
And THE NEXT BEST THING takes us there once again, with an even lamer
attempt at making "The Oddest Couple Has a Baby."
     Fortunately, THE NEXT BEST THING covers very different ground than
AFFECTION.  Unfortunately, that ground turns out to be providing a
platform for Madonna to sing, to show off her yoga skills, and To Show
You How Much She Can E-Mote During Her Di-A-Logue, all while affecting a
slight (yet very pretentious) British accent.  Get outta the way,
people, Madonna's gonna act!!!  And it isn't going to be pretty.  (See
also: EVITA.)
     Rupert Everett tries to be a good sport, but he mainly serves as a
punching bag for Ms. Ciccone and ends up being the butt of his own gay
jokes.  The movie insults his prodigious acting skills and makes a
mockery of his ability.
     What's worst is that viewers probably expect a romantic comedy out
of this, judging from the subject matter and the trailer.  Not so.
While a few early scenes throw you a few bones of decent comedy, THE
NEXT BEST THING rapidly turns into the least funny of scenarios: The
child custody battle.  Believe me, this is *not* KRAMER VS. KRAMER.
     What is it, then?  It's a sloppy mess of a star vehicle that will
leave only Madonna's awful remake of "American Pie" as its legacy.  And
as Don McLean said in his song, boy is this levy dry.
Director: John Schlesinger
Producer: Leslie Dixon, Linne Radmin, Tom Rosenberg
Writer: Tom Ropelewski

Review for Placard, Le (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Poor François Pignon.  His wife ran out on him two years ago, his teenage
son won't have anything to do with him, and he just overheard he's being
fired from the accounting job he's held for the last 20 years.  So François
does what any cinematic loser would - attempts suicide by jumping off the
balcony of his apartment.  But he's stopped by a nosy neighbor, who helps
concoct a devious plan to keep François employed.
The neighbor is Belone (Michel Aumont), an older man who takes the desperate
François (Daniel Auteuil, The Widow of St. Pierre) under his wing by
instructing him to pretend he's gay in order to keep his job.  It sounds
like something George Constanza would do (or maybe even a nefarious Jack
Tripper plan), although that would be one of three story arcs in a 23-minute
show.  The Closet is a film based on a single joke, making it no different
from any of the recent Saturday Night Live movie bombs. Except SNL films are
based on a single funny joke (all but The Ladies Man, anyway).
But Belone's plan works, earning François not only a promotion but the
attentions of both a curvy female co-worker (Michčle Laroque) and a bumpy
male co-worker (Gérard Depardieu, 102 Dalmatians).  There are a few gags
that made me laugh out loud, but most of The Closet is full of typically
unfunny French humor, which (along with their attitude toward alternative
lifestyles) seems to lag about 30 or 40 years behind the rest of the world.
But I'll give them this - they've got a ban on using cell phones when you
drive. That's almost enough to make up for the whole Jerry Lewis thing.
While the plot may sound similar to the abominable Three to Tango (where
Matthew Perry pretended to be gay to win a contracting job), The Closet was
written and directed by revered French filmmaker Francis Veber, who had a
big hit last year with The Dinner Game (which featured Closet costar Thierry
Lhermitte as François Pignon).
While he's hardly a household name in the States, Veber is directly
responsible for some of the most vile cinematic swill of the last 20 years.
Remember Three Fugitives with Martin Short and Nick Nolte?  Veber wrote and
directed that, as well as the original French version (Les Fugitifs) on
which it was based (it starred Depardieu and a character named François
Pignon, too). He also directed the inane Matthew Broderick vehicle Out on a
Limb, and his French hits spawned the following U.S. disasters: Father's Day
(Billy Crystal and Robin Williams), Pure Luck (Martin Short and Danny
Glover), The Toy (Jackie Gleason and Richard Pryor) and My Father the Hero
(Depardieu).
The really strange thing (other than the fact that people keep greenlighting
films based on his ideas) is that all of these films are about a guy named
François Pignon (or, sometimes, Perrin), and most costar Depardieu.  Veber's
next feature?  An American version of The Dinner Game, starring Kevin Kline
as Pignon.

Review for Training Day (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved. 
The only reason anyone should want to see Training Day is to catch an 
extremely rare glimpse of Denzel Washington playing a bad guy.  The actor 
has made a career of portraying characters who are decent, hard-working and 
constantly struggling against some force that tries to keep them down (it's 
usually Whitey von Crackermeister), so it's a real treat to see him tackle 
something new for a change (not unlike Harrison Ford - Washington's white 
counterpart - in last summer's What Lies Beneath). 
Washington (Remember the Titans) really chews the scenery in this role, in 
which he plays LAPD Detective Alonzo Harris, the head of an ultra-elite 
undercover narcotics squad.  Day, just as the title suggests, covers one day 
in the life of Alonzo and his troop's latest recruit, 
still-wet-behind-the-ears Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke, Hamlet).  So, with that 
one-sentence description, Day has already covered the two biggest cop-flick 
clichés: the black guy/white guy thing (popularized by Lethal Weapon) and 
the rookie/veteran thing (which strives to be as good as Colors, but comes 
off closer to Osmosis Jones). 
Day is told through the eyes of Jake, who has only been on the job for 19 
months and wants to catch the fast track to running his own department as 
soon as possible so he can move his hot wife (Charlotte Ayanna) and their 
baby out of the cramped apartment in which they currently live.  The titular 
day is his first in a temporary assignment that could potentially land him 
in Alonzo's rogue bunch on a permanent basis.  He's an eager beaver, but 
Jake knows he's in for a bumpy ride with Alonzo from their first meeting. 
Within 30 minutes, Alonzo has him jaywalking, drinking beer and smoking 
laced marijuana with a cocked gun jammed into his temple.  And you thought 
your office orientation was bad. 
As Day progresses, the clearly out-of-control Alonzo requires Jake to do 
crazier and crazier things in an attempt to both prove his worth to the unit 
and make the film more interesting. In a speech similar to that of Woody 
Allen's character in The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, Alonzo explains you've 
got to be a wolf to catch the wolves, while poor stoned Jake is left to 
mutter things like "I should've been a fireman."  Not only does Alonzo 
forbid Jake from filling out reports and making radio contact back to base, 
he get pissed off when his trainee jumps out of the car to stop an attempted 
rape. 
Their adventure includes trips to see Alonzo's mentor (Scott Glenn, Vertical 
Limit), Alonzo's ho (Eva Mendes, Urban Legends: Final Cut) and a trio of 
popular musical artists (Snoop Dogg, Macy Gray and Dr. Dre), but the trouble 
with Day is you know how it's going to end before the lights go down, and it 
takes forever to get there.  That's not to say, however, that it's not 
occasionally stylish and fun (thanks to director Antoine Fuqua, Bait). 
The film's first half begins promisingly but the second is laughably 
far-fetched, and the ending is kind of a letdown.  The fact that all of this 
stuff happens in under 24 hours makes Day slightly less believable than 
Legally Blonde.  But screenwriter David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious) 
isn't exactly well-known for creating plausible ideas, either.  I couldn't 
help thinking about how Day would have been received if its roles were 
reversed racially, with a corrupt white LAPD detective schooling a naďve 
black rookie (actually, that kind of sounds more interesting, doesn't it?). 
As it is, the film could still potentially rile some who are convinced 
police corruption is rampant and widespread (possible new LAPD motto: "We 
break more laws before you wake up than you'll break all day"), which is 
probably why Day's release was pushed back two weeks after pro-police 
sentiment swept the country in the wake of the World Trade Center attack. 
As far as Washington goes, it's fun to see him cast against type, but his 
performance is way too far over the top.  Sure, he's a bad guy, but he's a 
really likeable bad guy.  Hawke does well but doesn't really have too much 
to work with here and seems fairly content in letting Washington do 
everything but look directly into the camera and scream, "Look at me!  I'm 
playing a bad guy!  Can you believe it?  Me!  Denzel!  Notice me!"

Review for Men of Honor (2000)
Films based on true stories are unique cinematic animals.  To begin
with, if the story is popular enough, viewers already know the ending
(like Titanic).  Even if the tale isn't particularly well-known, studios
can ruin a film's finale by having the main character appear on the talk
show circuit prior to release, so potential viewers will know he/she
doesn't die no matter how much adversity they face in the film  (like
The Hurricane).  And if you've got a problem with the film's story being
boring, can you really complain if it's based on actual events?  I felt
that way about The Perfect Storm and was besieged with e-mail from
people accusing me of not feeling sorry enough for the characters  like
my review was really damning the crew of the Andrea Gail and their
families instead of the film.
Men of Honor was cobbled together with the same cut-rate glue they used
to assemble The Perfect Storm.  While its central character isn't quite
as unlikable as the money-grubbers from the Andrea Gail, the film offers
precious little besides a formulaic story, phoned-in performances and
button-pushing racial issues calculated to cause white viewers to hang
their heads in shame as they drive their SUVs back to the suburbs.
Honor is about Carl Brashear, who is portrayed here by Cuba Gooding Jr.
(Chill Factor).  The film follows Brashear's life from his family's
Sonora, Kentucky dirt farm to a military career during which he became
the first black deep-sea diver in U.S. Navy history.  Of course, the
journey from Point A to Point B is full of adversity, mostly at the
hands of the racism Brashear encountered in the 60s Navy.  He starts
his career as a cook on the seas of the South Pacific, of all the
horrible things.
After finally clawing his way through two years of training in
casseroles and soufflés, Brashear lands at a New Jersey dive and salvage
school, which is run by redneck Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert De
Niro, Meet the Parents).  Sunday is a drunk with a corncob pipe (but,
sadly, no button nose) and has recently been assigned this training
position after severely damaging his lungs during a daring dive in the
Mediterranean.  He immediately takes a dislike to Brashear's hue and
makes him work 10 times harder than anybody else in the training
program.
The rest of Honor is pretty predictable (aside from a startling and
grisly injury to one of the characters).  We've already seen countless
films where two chest-thumping Alpha males butt heads, and it's not any
different here just because it's based on a true story.  Honor is slowed
down by obligatory romantic threads involving Brashear's Harlem
librarian  (Aunjanue Ellis, In Too Deep) and Sunday's strange
relationship with a beautiful woman played by Charlize Theron (who is
making her third feature film appearance in less than a month - The
Yards and Bagger Vance).
Honor was the writing debut of Scott Marshall Smith and was directed by
George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food).  The film features Gooding's best
performance since Jerry Maguire, but that's not really saying much if
you've seen what he's done lately.  The best and most exciting scene is
given away in the trailer.  It fails to inspire in nearly every way, but
does happen to be the second boat film this year to feature David Keith
(U-571).

Review for Clubland (1999)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The fact that Saul Rubinek's directorial debut - Jerry and Tom - wasn't seen
by more people is one of the greatest travesties of the '90s, right after
the break-up of The Ramones and the cancellation of My So Called Life.  The
hitman dramedy, adapted by Rick Cleveland (an occasional writer and producer
on The West Wing) and based on his three-man play, was a competitor at the
1998 Sundance Festival, and then later that fall at Montreal and Toronto,
where it played to strong reviews.  Then it collected dust on a shelf at
Miramax until its August 2000 video release.  That's right - Jerry went
straight to video.
Rubinek, an actor last seen on the screen as Nic Cage's boss in Family Man,
packs his second effort - Club Land - with more of the same long, unedited
shots and stunning jumps from scene to scene that made Jerry so enjoyable.
Unfortunately, it's all for naught.  Cleveland's intelligently written
script is followed up with one penned by Steven Weber.  Yes, that Steven
Weber - the same vanilla no-talent who had the name of his television show
changed from Cursed to The Weber Show because nobody knew he was on it.
Weber writes about as well as he acts, which dooms Club Land from the
get-go.  He also stars in the film, playing Stuey Walters, a Korean War vet
who is forced to go into the family business - talent management.  Stuey's
father, Willie (Alan Alda, What Women Want), is an old-school hard-ass who
constantly breaks his son's balls for not being into the management game.
"You look like you fell out of a bum's ass," he yells at Stuey, who seems
more content scouting skirts than talent.
When Willie's one decent money-making act quits, the Walters boys become
even more outwardly hostile toward each other, while simultaneously growing
closer on the inside.  It's a story that should be taken out back and shot.
Club Land is Broadway Danny Rose without the humor, or the heart.  It wastes
the talent of Alda (who looks like he's having fun, for some reason) and
Happiness' Louise Lasser, while accentuating Weber's complete lack of
aptitude.
The only thing remotely interesting here is going on behind the camera.
Rubinek's direction and Sloane Klevin's editing (he also worked on Jerry)
are the lone standouts, creating odd scene transitions using clever camera
angles and mirrors.  But it's still not enough to make Club Land worth
watching.

Review for Best in Show (2000)
If you liked Waiting for Guffman, you'll love Best in Show.  Both films
were directed by Christopher Guest and largely improvised by similar
ensemble casts.  Guest has clearly perfected the `mockumentary,' a craft
he honed as a performer and writer on Rob Reiner's classic film This is
Spinal Tap.  This time out, Guest point his cynical lens at a ripe
target  dog shows.
Show begins with a scene featuring two yuppie attorneys from suburban
Illinois (Michael Hitchcock, Happy Texas and Parker Posey, Scream 3).
You think they're getting advice from a marriage counselor, but as the
scene unfolds, it becomes clear that the couple is really speaking to a
pet psychiatrist (it's been done before in Bruce McCulloch's Dog Park,
but that's a minor complaint).  It seems that Meg and Hamilton Swan are
concerned that their Weimaraner, Beatrice, suffered severe psychological
damage when she saw them having sex.
The kooky Swan's are just the tip of the iceberg.  Show's other dog show
participants include:
ˇ Harlan Pepper (Guest) and his bloodhound, Hubert.  They live in
backwoods Pinenut, North Carolina, where Pepper runs a bait and tackle
shop called The Fishing Hole.
ˇ Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara from SCTV)
and their Norwich Terrier, Blinky.  Based in Fern City, Florida, the
Flecks are living proof that opposites attract.  Gerry has two left feet
(literally) and resembles Kirk Van Houten from The Simpsons, while
Cookie's past sexual promiscuity becomes a running gag in the film.
ˇ Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean, Mystery, Alaska), Scott Donlan
(John Michael Higgins, Bicentennial Man) and their Shih Tzu, Miss
Agnes.  This homosexual couple from Tribeca are, respectively, a
hairdresser and a professional dog handler.
ˇ Sheri Ann Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge, Stifler's mom from American Pie),
Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch, What Planet Are You From?) and Rhapsody In
White, a `Standard' Poodle.  Sheri Ann is a buxom blonde married to a
man with one foot in the grave (Patrick Cranshaw from Guest's Almost
Heroes).  Christy is Rhapsody's butch trainer, and the defending
two-time champion of the Mayflower Dog Show.
Each of these dogs competes in the prestigious Mayflower event in
Philadelphia's top kennel club (a knock-off of New York's Westminster
Show), which is celebrating its 125-year of competition.  The first
round of the contest chooses the best dog from each breed.  The winners
of each breed compete for the coveted `Best in Show' award for the top
dog.
The show is hosted by two television commentators  one well informed
and serious (Jim Piddock, Mad About You)  the other a hysterically
clueless boor (Fred Willard, Austin Powers 2).  Their banter is easily
the funniest part of the film (I've got my fingers crossed that there
will be more on the DVD).
In addition to rousing drop dead hilarious performances from his cast,
Guest also adds in little touches that you might miss the first time
around.  Like the row of clocks that all give the same time behind the
front desk of the Mayflower competitor's hotel (signs underneath each
clock let you know that they're all for east coast cities, like
Baltimore, New York and Boston).
Show was loosely written by Guest and Levy, who also framed the story
for the critically acclaimed Guffman.  It's a big step in the right
direction after Guest bombed with 1998's non-mockumentary debacle Almost
Heroes.  There isn't one thing that would have made Show a more
enjoyable film (other than making it longer).  You won't see a funnier
film this year.

Review for Ideal Husband, An (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
First, writer/director Oliver Parker (Othello) hacked his way through
Shakespeare.  Now he's back, fumbling through another revered old dead
white guy, Oscar Wilde.  The film is well-cast and wonderfully acted,
but never really generates much too much excitement.
Based on Wilde's stage play, the film is set in late 1890s England and
focuses on Lord Arthur Goring (Rupert Everett, My Best Friend's
Wedding).  Goring is a wealthy bachelor, in love with himself much more
than any of his female conquests.  His world is shaken up a bit when
Laura Cheveley (Julianne Moore, Cookie's Fortune) comes to town and
throws a wrench into the tightly knit upper crust of London.
Cheveley's visitation coincides with the important vote on an Argentine
canal scheme.  Her goal is to blackmail key swing vote Sir Robert
Chiltern (Jeremy Northam, The Winslow Boy) and protect her sizeable
investment.  Although Chiltern is now happily married to Lady Gertrud
(Cate Blanchett, Elizabeth), his past indiscretions are known to
Cheveley and have him on the ropes.
Chiltern also has a sister named Mabel (Minnie Driver, Good Will
Hunting) that has been chasing after Goring for years.  Only a fool
couldn't see that these two would hook up by the end of the film.  Their
coupling is temporarily delayed by Cheveley's Cheshire-cat smile and
evil extortion plans, which are strangely wrapped up in about 60 minutes
when she disappears, tail between her legs.  The film then takes another
30 minutes to sew up all of the loose ends.  This is far too long an
ending for a film this short and is surely the sign of a troubled
filming and editing room cover-up.
Thankfully it is this short.  Goring's lecherous,
almost-under-his-breath ramblings grow tiresome after Cheveley's
departure, but his bickering with Papa Goring does get better as the
film progresses.  Northam's Chiltern is a slightly whipped (read:
married) version of his superior performance as Robert Morton in The
Winslow Boy.  Husband looks great due to the production and costume
design that brought us Emma and The Governess, and was lushly lensed by
David Johnson (Hilary & Jackie).  (1:36  PG for adult situations)

Title
Review for When Brendan Met Trudy (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
When you recreate scenes from classic movies in a new film, or use actual
clips of those landmark pictures in your project, there's a fine line
between taste and excess. Use too many clips, and your film will look like
the HBO series Dream On. Borrow too many familiar incidents (unless it's a
spoof, like Scary Movie), and people will accuse you of being unoriginal
(or, in certain cases, a plagiarist).
If you use the clips and the situations, you get When Brendan Met Trudy, a
light romantic comedy from Ireland that spits out film references quicker
than Russell Crowe beds famous actresses. From its title (swap "Brendan"
with "Harry" and "Trudy" with "Sally") and very first shot of a man laying
face down in the gutter (a la Sunset Boulevard), the film plays like an
hour-and-a-half homage to the filmmaker's favorite pictures. Like Dream On,
it only works a little more than half of the time.
The guy in the gutter is Brendan (Peter McDonald), a film-obsessed Dublin
schoolteacher who sings in his church choir and is very unlucky with the
ladies. One day, after choir practice, he stops into a pub and meets a
peppy, extroverted young lass named Trudy (Flora Montgomery). They begin to
date and, after a series of disastrous encounters, they eventually fall for
each other and make sweet, sweet love.
Somehow, in between clips of films like The Producers, The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, swipes at Jean-Claude Van
Damme and Emma Thompson, and restructuring of classic scenes originally done
by everyone from Jean-Luc Godard to John Woo, Trudy becomes an Irish version
of So I Married An Axe Murderer. It turns out that men in Dublin are under
siege from a black-clad vixen responsible for a string of brutal
castrations. Since Trudy mysteriously sneaks out each night (dressed in
black - she's a cat burglar), Brendan thinks he's dating the diabolical dick
dicer. Is he right, or is it just a crazy Three's Companyesque coincidence?
Even though most of Trudy is based on a handful of old films, and it offers
the basic "boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back" story, it
remains surprisingly fresh thanks to the great chemistry between the two
extremely likeable leads. The soundtrack includes a great, eclectic bunch of
songs (one from Sebadoh, no less), and I can't convey how wonderful it is to
see a film set in Dublin where people are clean, have nice jobs and live in
nice homes.
Trudy was directed by Kieron J. Walsh and written by Roddy Doyle, who is
probably best known as the author of the novel that became "The Barrytown
Trilogy" (The Commitments, The Snapper, and The Van). For its closing
credits, Trudy offers a hysterical look at what happens to each of its
characters. Again, the idea isn't something original, but it is executed in
a way that doesn't seem too stale.

Review for Timecode (2000)
You've probably seen films with overlapping storylines, but you've never
seen anything quite like Time Code.  Like Robert Altman's Short Cuts or
P.T. Anderson's Magnolia, where the lives of seemingly unrelated
characters cross paths almost by chance, Code one-ups its predecessors
(technically, at least) by allowing viewers to watch each story uniquely
unfold by splitting the screen into quarters and showing four different
plots developing at the same time.
Gimmicky?  You bet.  Potentially annoying?  Perhaps.  But the Brady
Bunch-esque split-screen isn't the only unique element of Code.  It's
one of the first pictures to be shot entirely in digital format instead
of using film, which allows Code to be filmed in one long, ninety-three
minute shot (standard cameras only hold enough film for about ten
minutes).  There is no editing.  And no script, either - director Mike
Figgis (Miss Julie) gave his actors a general idea of what he wanted in
terms of Code's plot, but most of what unfurls onscreen is improvised.
But wait, there's more.  The four hand-held digital cameras all began
filming at the same time, so the film progresses in real time.  So
basically Figgis sent a group of about thirty actors with no script to
improvise to four cameramen and - ninety-three minutes later - had a
completed picture.  Figgis' premise is audacious and groundbreaking, and
it really makes you realize how awful and unoriginal films like Here on
Earth and Where the Heart Is really are.
Code's story (there isn't much of one  remember, it's improvised)
focuses on Red Mullet, a film production company in Los Angeles.
Mullet's employees are your typically jaded Hollywood types and are
portrayed by (among others) Holly Hunter (Living Out Loud), Steven
Weber  (Wings) and Suzy Nakamura (The West Wing).  Stellan Skarsgĺrd
(Deep Blue Sea) plays Alex Green, one of Mullet's founders and the
thread that holds Code together.  Alex is a drunk, which affects his
relationship with his co-workers and his wife (Deep Blue Sea co-star
Saffron Burrows), and he's having a fling with a struggling bisexual
actress  (Salma Hayek, Dogma), who has a dangerously suspicious lover
(Jeanne Tripplehorn, Mickey Blue Eyes).
While I'm not sure how much of the film is improvised, Code's acting is
pretty well done (a surprising portion of the acting talent in this film
will also appear in Wim Wenders' upcoming film The Million Dollar
Hotel).  Like any decent film about southern California, Code also
prominently features earthquakes, drug use, booze, sex and lesbians
(there are two girl-on-girl make-out scenes - Hayek vs. Tripplehorn and
Burrows vs. Leslie Mann).  There's even a bit of self-mockery thrown in
for good measure, which makes Figgis' slightly pretentious concept seem
a bit easier to swallow.

Review for Holy Smoke (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Holy crap!  Holy Smoke is a holy mess!  Writer/director Jane Campion
still seems unable to return to the form that made her an Oscar winner
in 1993.  Since The Piano, Campion has cranked out the abysmally drab
The Portrait of a Lady and now Holy Smoke, which is definitely not a
step in the right direction by any stretch of the imagination.
The opening credits begin promisingly enough, using slow-motion shots of
India placed over a rockin' Neil Diamond track.  Once the story kicks
off, we learn that an Australian girl named Ruth (Kate Winslet, Hideous
Kinky) went to Delhi for vacation and never came home, apparently
choosing to live her life with the followers of some guy with Baba.
Naturally, her suburban Sydney family is distraught, and they try to
lure Ruth home so she can be deprogrammed by a `cult exiter' from Los
Angeles named PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel, Three Seasons).
The first step of the plan is for Ruth's asthmatic mother (Julie
Hamilton) to travel to Delhi to tell her that her father (Tim Robertson)
has suffered a serious stroke, which is just a lie to get her home.
While this is supposed to make Ruth fly back with her mum, she instead
shrugs it off and tries to get her mother to attend one of Baba's wacky
ceremonies.  Long story short, Ruth finally agrees to come home to see
her allegedly ailing father.
Once home, the family locks Ruth and PJ up in a second home in the
middle of the Aussie outback.  PJ explains that his technique generally
takes three days and that he has saved 189 souls during his career, with
a whopping 97 percent success rate.  Ruth is still obviously reluctant,
and after this forty-minute setup is complete, Smoke concentrates its
focus on its two acting leads.  This is when the film goes downhill 
fast.
You can guess what happens next.  Ruth hates him as he begins to make
headway in his deprogramming, but then uses her incredible rack to turn
the tables on PJ.  Before you know it, they're going at it like a couple
of horny teenagers.  Heck, if you locked me up in a house with a
mentally unstable Kate Winslet for three days, even I could get lucky.
Well, maybe four or five days.
Aside from being predictable on just about every level, Smoke seems to
go out of its way to be disturbing.  Ruth and PJ hit it off sexually
when she pisses all over herself and their crazy relationship ends when
he dons a red dress and lipstick.  At times, you will wonder if Campion,
who adapted the script with her sister Anna, intended the film to be
funny or dramatic.  It's neither, so I guess her intentions really don't
matter.  The film is brutally uneven, but not without visual flare.
It's a damn colorful picture, from the incredible blue skies, to
Keitel's ghastly white ass, to his bright red lipstick.
Winslet makes the best of the crappy script, acting crazy enough to be
believable.  But the craziest thing about Winslet is her choice of
post-Titanic films.  First, she ran off to Marrakech in Hideous Kinky
and now India in Smoke.  Get over yourself  two lousy art films are
enough of a penance to make up for starring in the biggest blockbuster
of all-time.  The good news is that her `area' is kept a little tidier
that it was in Jude.
And just what does Campion have over Keitel where she can continue to
blackmail him into taking risky roles in her films?  In The Piano, he
waived his tiny wiener at the camera, and here he's in a drag for the
last third of the film.  Whatever it is, I hope the debt has been paid
off.  I can't bear to see him embarrass himself again.

language

Review for Bicentennial Man (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
There are two sides to Robin Williams.  One is the wacky comedian that
America fell in love with on Mork & Mindy, and the other is an
Oscar-winning actor.  You can tell the two of them apart by Williams'
facial hair  clean-shaven means he's in out-of-control mode (Good
Morning, Vietnam), while a full beard indicates a more serious,
restrained Robin (Good Will Hunting).  But how do you tell which side
you're going to get when his face is obscured by a mask?
Although Williams is beardless under his costume in Bicentennial Man, he
shows the control and self-discipline of his tranquil alter-ego.  I
guess it goes to prove that looks can be deceiving.  But that's not the
only thing surprising about this film.  Disney seems to be selling it as
a holiday film for children, but it's actually a pretty serious drama
(containing a handful of laughs) with a running time of well over two
hours.  And here's another shocker  it's rather good.
Based on a short story of the same name by science-fiction guru Isaac
Asimov (he later fleshed it out into a novel called The Positronic Man
with collaborator Robert Silverberg) and adapted for the screen by
Nicholas Kazan (Fallen), Bicentennial Man is basically a futuristic
version of Pinocchio.  Williams (Jakob the Liar) stars as a robot
servant that dreams of becoming a human being.  As the title implies,
the film takes place over a two-hundred-year period, which means that
Williams' droid watches generations of his human `family' succumb to
death while he never ages.
After showing a nifty robot assembly line during the opening credits,
the film opens `sometime in the future.'  We don't know how far, but we
do see that cars can talk and that sweaters with patches on the elbow
are back in style again (later on, we find out that its 2005, so get
your patches ready).  A well-to-do clockmaker named Martin (Sam Neill,
The Horse Whisperer) has just purchased an NDR-114 robot for his
family.  The machine is supposed to be responsible for housekeeping and
food preparation, but instead shows un-robotic traits like creativity
and a desire to learn.  He is called Andrew and the Martins treat him
like a member of the family, except for making him live in the basement.
Andrew hits it off with the Martins' youngest daughter (Hallie Kate
Eisenberg from the Pepsi commercials), who he calls Little Miss.  Before
you know it, the years have flown by and Little Miss has become Old
Wrinkled Miss (Embeth Davidtz, Mansfield Park).  But prior to kicking
the bucket, Little Miss introduces Andrew to her gaunt granddaughter
Portia (also Davidtz), who is the spitting image of her willowy
grandmother.  Andrew and Portia also have a close relationship, but
she's engaged to marry a guy that looks like Jay Leno's
great-great-great grandson (Jay Johnston, Mr. Show).
Aside from his depressing family life, Andrew runs into a female android
(doesn't the word `android' imply a lack of sexuality?) that works for
an NDR-114 specialist named Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt, Lake Placid).
Andrew expresses his desire to become more human, and he and Burns
create revolutionary technology to begin the transformation.  Burns
starts by slapping some flesh-colored Flubber onto Andrew, and then adds
a central nervous system and so on and so on.  But no matter what type
of upgrades he receives, Andrew is still only recognized as a simple
machine.
One of the greatest features of the film is the realistic aging of its
characters.  The other is the unbelievable fact that Bicentennial Man
received a `PG' rating from the Motion Picture Association of America.
It has a couple of frank discussions about sex, as well as around a
dozen bad words (including, alphabetically, `ass,' `bitch,' two
different versions of `goddamn,' and about a half-dozed occurrences of
`shit').  There's even a scene where Andrew squeezes out a post-coital
fart after his first lay.  This rating seems particularly wrong
following the MPAA's `R' rating for Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo.  They
both had very similar content, but since Deuce's target audience was
drunk, date-raping frat-boys, it was slapped with the `R.'  Bicentennial
Man is being pushed on kids, and ended up with the `PG.'  Go figure.

Review for Life as a House (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Life As a House, which had its world premiere at the Toronto International
Film Festival, was described in the program book as being reminiscent of
Parenthood, It's a Wonderful Life and The Parent Trap, but the film reminded
me of a previous Toronto world premiere - American Beauty. Now, let's not
get carried away here, because House couldn't carry Beauty's jockstrap.  The
similarities are only in the content, not the quality.
Kline (The Anniversary Party) plays architect George Monroe, who, like
Lester Burnham before him, suffers daily at a job he no longer feels
passionate about, but gets fired in one of the film's opening scenes.  On
his way out of the building, George collapses and is taken to the hospital,
only to find out there's a cancer present that will devour him from the
inside out within a few months.  He is also father to a dark, brooding
teenager named Sam (The Virgin Suicides' Hayden Christensen, who will soon
be the dark, brooding Anakin Skywalker), who huffs gas and asphyxiates
himself when he jerks off.
Unlike Lester, who sort of knew he was going to die and suffered a midlife
crisis instigated by employment issues, George has been divorced from Robin
(Kristin Scott Thomas, Up At the Villa) long enough for her to have squirted
out two new kids with her current husband, the cold, unloving Peter (Jamey
Sheridan, Law & Order: CI).  And although he lives in a ritzy suburban
neighborhood like Lester, George's house is a shack, which is a painfully
ridiculous metaphor for both his rotten life and decaying innards.
Knowing he'll be pushing up daisies soon (and keeping his illness a secret
from everyone), George decides it's the perfect time to bond with his
rebellious son as the two - get this - tear down the shack and build
George's dream house.  Sam, of course, hates the idea, but soon changes from
a pierced, dyed, black-clad, perpetually headphoned rent-boy into a normal,
well-adjusted kid with no makeup and no attitude.  After all, what angry,
distant teen wouldn't relish taking a crowbar to his father's house?
Sure enough, the montage of the two building the new home soon follows, but
George and Sam are joined by neighbor Colleen (Mary Steenburgen) and her
daughter Alyssa (Jena Malone), and soon, even ex-wife Robin shows up with a
hammer in her hand.  As the house gets closer and closer to completion,
George's health gets worse and worse, but he feels better on the inside, and
that's all that counts, right?
House's neatly telegraphed story (penned by As Good As It Gets' Mark Andrus)
offers precious little that we can't see coming a mile away (or that we
haven't seen a bunch of times before).  The only thing remotely surprising
here is the amount of sex.  I don't want to give anything away, but there
are all kinds of combinations going on - May-December, December-May,
December-December, May-May and so on.  It's supposed to lighten things up, I
guess, but some of it gave me douche chills.
Although it's totally schmaltzy, House is still somewhat stirring, due to
its performances (especially Kline and the always reliable Malone). Director
Irwin Winkler (At First Sight) doesn't do anything special with the
formulaic script, unless you weren't expecting to see scenes where George is
doubled over with pain.  Oscar-winning cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond keeps
everything bathed in a nice, warm light.

Review for Aberdeen (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Lena Headey gives what could be one of the year's brightest breakthrough
performances in Aberdeen, a weakly written, poorly paced film that has
yet to find an American distributor despite being somewhat of a hit on
the festival circuit.  It's a confusing road-trip flick, but Headey's
terrific outing is more than enough to hold the mess together.
Headey (Gossip) plays Kaisa, a successful employee in one of London's
biggest law firms and, as the film opens, the guest of honor at a party
congratulating her on a recent promotion.  She's also a bit promiscuous,
preferring anonymous sexual encounters to establishing any type of
relationship with men.  Kaisa is in bed with another of her one-night
stands when her mother, Helen (Charlotte Rampling, The Wings of the
Dove), calls with a rather bizarre request.
It turns out that Tomas (Stellan Skarsgĺrd, Dancer in the Dark), Kaisa's
estranged, alcoholic father, has agreed to check himself into a detox
program in Aberdeen.  Helen wants Kaisa to trek to Norway and escort
Tomas from his Norwegian oil rig to Scotland, which the family once
called home. She agrees after learning the incentive for completing the
mission is Tomas' classic sports car that Kaisa has yearned for since
she was a child.
Of course, like any road-trip film, things don't always go too smoothly.
When Kaisa finally makes it to Norway, she finds a drunk, disheveled
Tomas who knows nothing about the Aberdeen detox plan (Helen has a
mysterious ulterior motive).  They butt heads, and it becomes clear that
Kaisa must act as a parent to her infantile father, who repays her in
vomit.  We learn through flashbacks that the two were once close, but
Tomas abandoned Kaisa and her mother at a time when she needed a father
figure the most.
The journey Kaisa and Tomas take is a little hard to follow.  There were
a couple of moments in which I had no idea where Kaisa and Tomas were,
or where they were supposed to be heading.  Aberdeen's story, co-written
by Kristin Amundsen, Lars Bill Lundholm and the film's director, Hans
Petter Moland, doesn't really offer anything new to the road-trip genre
and, as a result, the film drags in several segments.
On the plus side, the acting in Aberdeen is first-rate.  Skarsgĺrd and
Spring Forward's Ian Hart (he plays a trucker who gets involved in Kaisa
and Tomas' journey) turn in typically strong performances, but Headey
steals the show as the long-legged vixen with more character flaws than
a politician on the take (think of a taller, thinner Heather Langenkamp
with a Scottish accent).  She's beautiful, confident and totally damaged
all at once (and the accent doesn't hurt, either).
Viewers may notice a similarity between Aberdeen and Lars von Trier's
Breaking the Waves.  Both films were helmed by Scandinavian directors
and featured both a young English actress portraying a Scot (Emily
Watson in Waves), and Skarsgĺrd playing a hard-drinking oil rig worker.

Review for King and I, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
Warner Bros.' second serious foray into the animation market is just as
ineffective as its first (the anemic The Quest for Camelot).  Here, they
hack about forty-five minutes off of the popular 1956 Rodgers &
Hammerstein musical starring Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, who reprised
his Broadway role and nabbed the Oscar.  And, believe me, you'll be
thankful for every minute that's missing.
The story is the same as it always was  Anna (voiced by Miranda
Richardson, Merlin) is a widowed English schoolteacher who travels to
Siam to teach the children of its overprotective and strong-handed
King.  She butts heads with His Holiness almost immediately and must
also deal with the obligatory evil cartoon guy who wants to dethrone the
existing King and rule the country as he deems fit.  This guy also has
magical powers, at one point conjuring up a dragon to attack Anna's boat
before her arrival.  Luckily, Anna is able to fend the serpent of with
her amazing power of song.
The King is as empty as Paul McCartney's stomach at an all-you-can-eat
ribs festival.  The animation is horribly jerky and the evil guy's comic
sidekick (voiced by Saturday Night Live's Darrell Hammond) is downright
offensive  unless all Asian men are really short, stupid, bald, and
have both rotting teeth and bad accents.  And the songs  don't get me
started on the songs.  You'll probably be better off waiting for the
real remake  not of the musical, but of the 1946 Oscar winner featuring
Rex Harrison and Irene Dunne  which will star Jodie Foster as the
British governess and Hong Kong action legend Chow Yun-Fat (The
Corruptor) as the King.  (G  1:28 for mild violence and the possibly
offensive portrayal of the entire Asian race)

Title
Review for Man Who Cried, The (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Sally Potter's (The Tango Lesson) films always seem to be about the visuals
more than any kind of structured story, and The Man Who Cried isn't one bit
different. It tells the story of a Jewish girl traversing the globe in
search of her beloved father and is set against the backdrop of World War II
and the Holocaust (can somebody please create and enforce an annual ceiling
on the production of WWII/Holocaust films?). The picture has a pretty decent
cast - it's kind of the indie version of America's Sweethearts' A-list
stars - but little annoyances like dialogue and chemistry bog down each of
the fine actors and actresses in a somewhat harebrained story.
Set in 1927, Cried opens in a Russian shtetl that is full of thin guys with
beards, thick-ankled women with babushkas, and kids who look normal but will
evolve into one of these two kinds of adults. One of these children is
Fegele (Claudia Lander-Duke), the daughter of the village cantor (Oleg
Yankovsky) and the apple of his eye. Fegele's papa heads for America with
the intention of bringing the rest of his family to the New World once he
saves enough money. But shortly after he leaves, the shtetl is burned to the
ground, and the wide-eyed Fegele is smuggled into England with only a
photograph of her dad and a couple of coins sewed into her dress.
Upon arriving in the UK, Fegele is renamed Suzie and handed off to a gentile
family who sends her to a Catholic school that literally beats the Yiddish
out of her. Cried flashes forward about 10 years, when an older Suzie (a
slimmed-down Christina Ricci, Sleepy Hollow) hightails it away from the
parents to whom she apparently never developed any kind of attachment and
heads for Paris, where she becomes a dancer in a theatre company owned by
Felix Perlman (Harry Dean Stanton, The Green Mile). But Suzie is able to
keep her Jewish past a secret, thanks to the English accent flogged into her
 by the Church and her adoptive parents.
Suzie also befriends fellow Russian dancer Lola (Cate Blanchett, The Gift),
who will do just about anything to land a man with money; and Cesar (Ricci's
Sleepy Hollow co-star Johnny Depp), a Gypsy horse-trainer for the theatre.
Johnny Depp as a gypsy living in France? That seems like such a stretch. As
in Chocolat, Depp doesn't show up for a while, and when he does, he barely
has any lines. And like Sleepy Hollow, there isn't much chemistry between he
and Ricci, but each offers more wordless glances at which to shake a stick.
Silent stares only get you so far, though.
I loved the beginning of the film, especially Lander-Duke's Ponette-esque
performance, and I admired the fact that, unlike Heartbreakers' Sigourney
Weaver, Blanchett's Russian accent didn't sound like Natasha from The Rocky
and Bullwinkle Show, even though, as Suzie's alter ego, her character is
grating (the film could have also been called Shut Up Lola Shut Up). Cried
looks fantastic (cinematographer Sacha Vierny has shot the last nine Peter
Greenaway films) and sounds great (Osvaldo Golijov's score includes a
terrific song from Requiem For a Dream's Kronos Quartet). But other than
that, there isn't too much happening, other than a lot of lip-synching.
Basically, Cried is about a girl in the throes of an identity crisis. Suzie
feels guilty about hiding her Jewish roots, and her heart breaks when she
sees the way the Gypsies are treated, but outing yourself as a Jew and
befriending the Gypsies as the Germans advance on Paris are a sure way to
get yourself tossed into the oven.
And just who is the titular crying man? Is it Suzie's father, weeping
because he was separated from his daughter? Is it Cesar, sobbing because he
knows his Gypsy family is likely to be wiped out? Or is it me, bawling
because I sat through the whole blasted thing?

Title
Review for Bats (1999/I)
Bats are scary.  Even though they are gentle, passive creatures that
will only bite in self-defense if they are picked up and handled, bats
still have a bad reputation.  Their presence is an indicator of a
healthy ecosystem.  They are good for the rainforest, they eat annoying
insects and their rate of rabies infection isn't more than any other
species (about 1 in 1,000).  But try rationalizing this to a person that
has a bat swooping around their attic at night and you are likely to
find yourself trampled by said person.
In Bats, the first offering from new Hollywood player Destination Films,
the director of Carnosaur 2 (Louis Morneau) is teamed with Gladiator
screenwriter John Logan to make one of the worst films of the year, if
not the entire decade.  It's not scary.  In fact, that Bugs Bunny
cartoon with the vampire that turns into a half-man/half-bat after
hearing the words `Hocus Cadabra' was scarier.  The filmmakers and
actors think they're making an Oscar contender, while they should be
playing everything with a sarcastic edge  like in Lake Placid.
Bats takes place in Gallup, Texas, and in the first scene we watch the
token young couple attacked by killer bats that claw their way through
the ragtop car roof and chomp on the teens' jugulars.  Flash to the
Arizona desert, where Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer, Starship Troopers), a
wildlife zoologist with a specialty in Chiroptera, is in a cave studying
docile bats with her idiotic sidekick Jimmy (León, OZ).  A chopper from
the Center for Disease Control lands nearby and whisks the two off to
Gallup to help them investigate the grisly deaths.
As it turns out, these bloodthirsty bats were actually a decade-long
government experiment that took Flying Foxes  an Indonesian bat with a
six-foot wingspan  and genetically increased their natural
intelligence, developed their ability to work as a team, as well as
making them aggressive and carnivorous.  Two of these killing machines
have escaped and infected the entire bat population of Gallup.  Their
creator, Dr. McCabe (Bob Gunton, Patch Adams), is one of the lamest evil
scientists in the history of movie bad guys.
Together with local Sheriff Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips, I Lost
my Wife to Melissa Etheridge), Casper and the bat-phobic Jimmy
brainlessly try to think of ways of stopping the bats from escalating
their nightly attacks on the town.  Their big idea is to hole up in the
school, covering each door and window with electrified chain-link
fencing, despite the fact that the bats were able to squeeze through a
car's ventilation system in an earlier scene.  How would a chain-link
fence be any more protective?
Kimsey, Casper and Jimmy proceed to an abandoned mine, where the throngs
of bats have congregated.  The Army is trying to trap them in the mine
and annihilate them using a large refrigeration device, since cold
temperatures are lethal to the winged critters.  But the bats wipe out
the Army, too, leaving Kimsey and Casper to venture into the mine
wearing what resembles scuba gear.  This, despite knowing that the bats
gnawed their way through a ragtop car roof.
Kimsey, in all of the wisdom his shallow character can muster, turns and
fires a pistol at the approaching bats as he flees the mine.  There are
millions of them - what does he think a few bullets would do?  This is
after he and Casper were chest-deep in a river of bat guano and he
decided to light a flare.  Maybe I don't know a lot about bats or the
flammability of their guano, but I would have second and third thoughts
about introducing flame to large amounts of the dung of any animal.  And
speaking of bat knowledge, aren't they supposed to be blind?  On several
occasions, the director offers a view from the perspective of a bat,
which is apparently red-hued and slanty.
Bats is a terrible mess when it should be a tongue-in-cheek mockery of
the genre.  The writer's idea of intentional laughs are León's awful
one-liners that fall as flat as Meyer's tummy.  He's a Chris Tucker
wannabe; a black Shaggy without the sidekick, left to lifelessly shout
dumb stuff like, `I don't like the sound of that,' `I hate this shit'
and the inevitably original `Damn.'  Hopefully, Logan's next script 
Oliver Stone's Christmas football pic Any Given Sunday  will be a bit
crisper. Morneau's action sequences are choppy and tough to make out,
and although the disgusting bats resemble a certain senior Senator from
North Carolina, they fail to terrify.

Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Look at the perfect suburban neighborhood, with the perfectly straight
street lined with perfectly spaced trees in front of each perfect home.
Look at the inhabitants of the house with the red door.  They seem to be
a perfectly ordinary family, but look closer.
Father and head-of-the-family Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey, Hurlyburly)
appears to be a normal middle-aged suburbanite.  He drives his Toyota
Camry to his job at Media Monthly Magazine, but if you look closer you
will see a man so broken of spirit that he has no qualms leering at his
teenage daughter's young friends or referring to his daily shower
masturbation session as the highlight of his day.  Lester explains, in
an opening narrative, that he is 42 and will be dead in a year  even
though it feels like part of him has been dying for years.
His wife Carolyn (Annette Bening, In Dreams) is a real estate agent with
a Mercedes SUV and an upbeat outlook on life, not to mention pruning
shears that match her gardening clogs.  Career-wise, Carolyn lives in
the huge shadow of Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King (Peter Gallagher,
The Man Who Knew too Little), whose face adorns park benches and
billboards around the unnamed town.  Look closer at the woman that
forces her family listen to elevator music during dinner each evening,
and you will see a person so afraid of professional and personal failure
that she actually beats herself in the face if she cries.
Lester and Caroline's only child is Jane (Thora Birch, Harrison Ford's
cute little kid in those Tom Clancy movies), a high school student
embarrassed that her lecherous dad will `spray his shorts' if she brings
home any female classmates.  She's a member of the school's pep squad,
but if you look closer, Jane finds herself struggling to escape the
shadow of her popular and brazen best friend (and model wannabe) Angela
(Mena Suvari, American Pie).
No longer able to stomach the daily grind of selling his soul at work,
Lester decides to quit his job and really live his life.  He trades the
Camry for the classic car he always dreamed of having.  He also starts
to work out and smoke pot, finding new employment at a fast food joint
called Smiley Burger  and he has never been happier.  Despite his
newfound euphoria, Lester's family suffers the brunt of the changes
brought upon by his revitalized outlook.
Their problem?  Lester really starts to push the envelope in a world
where you simply can't afford to be plain, but can't do much to really
stand out, either.  And that is the soul of the film.  Most men his age
are content to regale peers with tales of days past when they drove
across the country, stoned like Gonzo and his attorney, with The Allman
Brothers Live at the Fillmore East blaring from the stereo and the wind
whipping through hair they used to have.  Now older, married and
whipped, they are happy to have two minutes alone each day just to pinch
a loaf (or jerk off in the shower).
Not to be outdone by the reigning neighborhood dysfunction champions are
the Burnham's new neighbors, whose move into the vacant house next-door
coincides with Lester's mental collapse.  Their patriarch (Chris Cooper,
October Sky), a military man with a graying brush-cut, introduces
himself to everyone as `Colonel Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.'  Wife Barbra
(Allison Janney, 10 Things I Hate About You) staggers through life like
a zombie, trying to mask whatever horrors life has previously dealt
her.  Like the Burnhams, the Fitts' have one child  a boy named Ricky
(newcomer Wes Bentley), who has just been released from a mental
institution, sells pot and captures life's quirks on a home video
camera.  Boy, did he move to the right neighborhood.
Likely to draw comparisons to both The Ice Storm and Happiness (all
three are interweaving tales of whacked-out suburban families with major
sexual issues), Beauty is nothing short of perfection.  Spacey has never
been better (plus, he has one of the best spit-takes of this decade) and
Birch is completely amazing for somebody who was in that cinematic opus
Monkey Business.  A role like Jane's would ordinarily be given to a
Christina Ricci or possibly an Anna Paquin, but Birch's performance
easily tops anything that either have done.
The scary part of Beauty (other than the content) is that it's the first
script written by Alan Ball and first picture helmed by Sam Mendes, who
has previously directed Broadway hits Cabaret and the Nicole Kidman
nude-fest The Blue Room.  Mendes' bold direction is technically
brilliant, recalling early efforts of Tarantino or Paul Thomas
Anderson.  Beauty is the kind of film that will reap loads of critical
praise, yet may not light up the box office and be too controversial to
be considered for Oscar nominations.  But it is so good that the Academy
may not be able to ignore it.  (1:52 - R for nudity, strong sexuality,

Title
Review for Me, Myself & Irene (2000)
The ads for Jim Carrey's new film announce he's going `from gentle to
mental.' The slogan refers to Carrey's character in Me, Myself & Irene,
the new comedy from the dick/shit joke factory known as the Farrelly
brothers, but it could just as easily apply to the $20 million man's
decision to sign on to Irene.  He's reverted from (near) Oscar-worthy
performances to the type of hyperactive, lowbrow comedy that made him a
star.
In Irene, Carrey (Man on the Moon) plays Charlie, a well-adjusted Rhode
Island State Trooper complete with typical cop moustache. Described as a
really nice guy, Charlie also has a beautiful girlfriend named Layla
(Traylor Howard, Two Guys and a Girl), and the film opens with the happy
couple getting hitched. But things start to unravel for Charlie pretty
quickly, as he gets his ass kicked by Shonte (Tony Cox, Friday), the
newlyweds' genius black midget limo driver.
But that's just the tip of the iceberg, as far as Charlie's troubles are
concerned. Nobody takes him seriously, from the neighbor that steals his
newspaper, to his co-workers, to the citizens he's supposed to serve and
protect. Oh, and there's the little matter of the severely tanned
triplets that Layla has given birth to. Their names are Jamal, Lee
Harvey and Shonte, Jr. - you do the math. Layla eventually leaves
Charlie and the kids to live alone in their garage-sized house.
As a result of the entire world walking all over him, Charlie develops
another personality - a rude, no-nonsense bad-ass named Hank - that
emerges in a very funny scene set in a supermarket. As you can imagine,
Carrey plus a split personality equals a lot of nifty physical comedy
that nobody else in the world would be able to pull off. There's a scene
toward the end where Charlie is fighting Hank (or vice-versa), and
Carrey does such a good job, it almost looks fake.
Unfortunately, Irene doesn't quite measure up to any of the three
previous Farrelly brothers' films (There's Something About Mary, Kingpin
and Carrey's Dumb and Dumber). The main problem is with a convoluted
storyline involving a woman named Irene (Renée Zellweger, The Bachelor)
who Charlie/Hank must escort from Rhode Island to Massena, New York.
Irene is embroiled in some sort of big business/police cover-up deal
that's way too detailed for this kind of film.  And there are no
bust-your-gut-laughing scenes, like the Stiller vs. Dog set piece in
Mary.
As a result, the film is flat in too many spots, and wastes time setting
up its unnecessarily complicated plot when it could have had more gags
about feces and urine. Irene was originally supposed to be about Siamese
twins (played by Carrey and Woody Allen) that fall for the same girl,
but that idea was scrapped when Allen didn't sign on to the project. The
Farrellys dusted off an old script that they co-wrote with an old friend
(Mike Cerrone - he plays a police officer, too).
Like the previous three Farrelly films, Irene is chock-full of offensive
material that is bound to piss a lot of people off. But the Farrellys
are equal opportunity offenders and leave no stone unturned. They mock
blacks, albinos, lesbians and just about any other group you can attach
a name to. And there are sight gags a-plenty (like Charlie crammed onto
the couch with his three gigantic black sons), which leaves Zellweger as
the straight man in all of her scenes with her real-life beau Carrey (I
think she sets some kind of film record for the most number of
horror-struck double takes).
Irene is narrated by Rex Allen, Jr., who, like William Preston Robertson
in Raising Arizona and Sam Neill in The Big Lebowski, uses a slow
Southern drawl to tell the story via flashback. The film also features
cameo appearances by tennis pin-up princess Anna Kournikova and former
Boston Bruin puck-head Cam Neely. Sadly, Farrelly staple Lin Shaye
(she's the one who French-kissed the dog in Mary) appears briefly in
only one scene.

violence

Title
Review for Get Carter (2000)
Remember the Shaft remake from earlier this year?  The 1971 original was
updated and 58-year-old Richard Roundtree, the star of the first film,
was given a smaller role in the second to make way for a newer, hipper
lead.
But Shaft isn't the only remake from '71 to rear its head in 2000.  Get
Carter was originally a British flick based on Ted Lewis' novel `Jack's
Return Home' that starred recent Oscar winner Michael Caine (it also
became a 1972 blaxploitation movie called Hit Man with Bernie Casey and
Pam Grier).  Caine (The Cider House Rules) has a smaller role in the new
version, but he isn't making way for a newer, hipper lead.  In fact,
Carter's new lead, Sylvester Stallone, is only four years younger than
Roundtree.
The new adaptation updates the cheesy 70s music, clothes and hair,
while the story remains somewhat the same.  Vegas heavy Jack Carter
(Stallone, Cop Land) learns that his estranged brother has been killed
in Seattle and heads off to his old stomping ground to find out if the
accident was really caused by drunk driving or by more devious means.
For some reason, he suspects foul play and, like Terence Stamp in The
Limey, he's right.
When Carter gets to Seattle, he heads straight for his brother's
funeral, where he meets his sister-in-law Gloria (Miranda Richardson,
Sleepy Hollow) and niece Doreen (Rachael Leigh Cook, She's All That). He
begins to pester them with questions about the accident, but they see
his queries as an annoyance.  Doreen even tells Carter, `You're just a
picture on the piano,' despite the fact we see no pictures on the piano
in a later scene.  Probably just a figure of speech.
Once Carter hits the streets to investigate his brother's lifestyle and
death, we're introduced to a jumble of characters from which we must
figure out the pecking order of Seattle's crime food chain as he pummels
his way to the top.  You're supposed to be surprised by the kingpin, but
it's really quite predictable.  In that respect, Carter is kind of like
Mel Gibson's Payback.
The original version of Carter was much, much better and is widely
regarded as one of the finest British crime pics ever made.  It was
directed by Mike Hodges, who went on to make Flash Gordon and, more
impressively, the recent sleeper hit Croupier.  There are two fantastic
scenes in the first film that I was surprised to see omitted from the
remake.  One involved a steamy phone sex call between Carter and the
girlfriend of his mob boss back home.  It must have been pretty risqué
20 years ago, but by today's standards, it would be quite tame.
The other scene involved two thugs walking in on Carter while he was
shagging some bird.  He was able to turn the tables on the situation,
leading the men down the stairs and out of the house with a shotgun
while completely naked.  And, of course, the ending of the new film is
completely different.  Interestingly, there is a mysterious female
character named Geraldine (Rhona Mitra, Hollow Man) in the remake,
somewhat of a nod to the original role played by Geraldine Moffatt.
Even without the lackluster comparisons to the original film, Carter has
plenty of problems.  The film appears to be set just before Christmas,
but there isn't the slightest hint of chilly weather.  It is perpetually
gloomy and rainy in Carter's Seattle, which doesn't stop Jack from
sporting sunglasses most of the time.  Stallone's performance is
unremarkable in every way, unless you count the disgusting veins
protruding from his shoulders and arms, or the goatee that's supposed to
make him look younger.
Editor Jerry Greenberg (Duets), whose technique resembles the comedic
styling of Robin Williams after fourteen espressos, makes Carter's
action scenes more annoying and spastic than Armageddon.  The film was
directed by Stephen T. Kay (The Last Time I Committed Suicide and one of
the screenwriters of The Mod Squad) and adapted by David McKenna (Body
Shots).  Kay's direction is `highlighted' by a scene where the camera is
turned upside down in an attempt to show how Carter's life has gone
topsy-turvy.  Give me a break.

Review for Mifunes sidste sang (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
This festival darling and Denmark's entry to the 2000 Oscars is a sweet
tale of unlikely people bonding together to form an oddly cohesive
family unit.  Mifune would be easy to overlook if it were not for the
fact that it is the third film created using the limiting covenants of
Dogme 95, a filmmaking aesthetic created nearly five years ago by Danish
directors Lars von Trier (Breaking the Waves) and Thomas Vinterberg (The
Celebration).
Among the restrictions in Dogme's `Vow of Chastity,' to which each
director must swear allegiance, are the forbidding of the use of props,
sets, artificial light and sound (including music).  The scenes must be
shot sequentially on a hand-held camera and must not contain any
superficial action.  The opening and closing credits were hand-written
on a discolored, cracked wall, which isn't a Dogme rule, but still
looked damn cool regardless.
Mifune is set in modern-day Copenhagen, where we find Kresten (Anders W.
Berthelsen) marrying Claire (Sofie Grĺbřl), the daughter of his wealthy
boss.  The film quickly shifts from emotional wedding toasts to the
honeymoon bed, which includes one of the most violent woman-on-top sex
scenes that I've ever seen.  The following morning, Kresten is awakened
by a phone call relaying the message that his estranged father has
died.  Although he hasn't spoken to his dad for ten years, Kresten
leaves his pouty bride behind to tie up the loose ends of his family's
estate.
Maybe `loose ends' isn't a strong enough description.  For one, the
estate consists of an isolated, rundown farmhouse.  Then there's Rud
(Jesper Asholt), Kresten's mentally challenged brother that isn't
responsible enough to care for himself.  After making the funeral
arrangements, Kresten must find someone to look after his nose-picking
brother.  He places an ad in the paper and hires Liva (Iben Hjejle), a
prostitute from an upscale call-girl service that's on the run from both
her pimp, with whom she has fallen out of favor, and a series of creepy
obscene phone calls.
Both brothers are immediately smitten with the lovely Liva, who
resembles Robin Wright Penn but has a better rack.  Soon, Liva's snotty
little brother Bjarke (Emil Tarding) joins the mix after being expelled
from school.  `We three are a bunch of loonies,' Kresten admits, despite
the fact that the four housemates seem to gel together after a short
period of unrest - they have little but each other to hold on to.  In
particular, Kresten and Liva are happy to be accepted without being
judged by their pasts (farming and hooking).
Already having garnered accolades at several major film festivals, as
well as nabbing three European Film Awards (for Hjejle, Asholt and Best
Picture), Mifune certainly looks better than the previous two Dogme
films (The Celebration and the yet-to-be-released The Idiots), but its
story is also a lot more predictable, which is strange since the Dogme
rules were enacted because of the boring unoriginality of modern films.
The picture is undoubtedly more colorful that its predecessors, using
more outdoor scenes and effectively capturing the golden wheat and green
alfalfa, as well as the orangy interiors.  Sřren Kragh-Jacobsen's camera
work won't make you dizzy, like previous films using handheld cameras
(i.e., The Blair Witch Project).  Like other Dogme films, the acting is
terrific, especially Asholt and Hjejle, the latter of whom will next be
seen starring opposite John Cusack in High Fidelity.
For you film buffs, the name Mifune comes from actor Toshirô Mifune, who
appeared in over a dozen of Akira Kurosawa's films, including Yojimbo,
The Seven Samurai and Red Beard.  Years ago, Kresten convinced Rud that
the great samurai was living in the basement of their home; a revelation
that both terrified and excited Rud into doing whatever his brother
wanted.

Title
Review for Titus (1999)
This film version of William Shakespeare's oft-overlooked first tragedy
is a glorious mess.  Titus, based on the Bard's Titus Andronicus, is an
audacious, frantic jumble of images cobbled together like a music video,
and the result is a bit like The Fifth Element  a highly enjoyable
picture that seems way too over-the-top for its own good.  But Element
had the common sense to wrap things up around the two-hour mark, while
the meatier Titus keeps you in the theatre for another thirty-plus
minutes.
Titus opens with one of the year's more amazing scenes.  The film begins
with a child playing with plastic action figures in his kitchen.  The
boy, who has a paper bag over his head, proceeds to pick a food fight
with his toys as the room explodes and a strange man bursts in to
transport the boy to ancient Rome.  It seemed more suited to a scene
from Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits than a Shakespeare film, but that's
just the point  this isn't your typical Shakespeare film.
Once transported, the boy watches as Roman soldiers return home from
battle with the Goths.  The scene is amazingly choreographed, as the
soldiers march into the center of town caked with mud that makes them
look like statues.  It's probably fifteen minutes before any dialogue is
spoken  and it's taken verbatim from Shakespeare's play.  If you find
it hard to follow, don't let it scare you off.  It will begin to make
sense, and the ending alone is worth a sore ass.
Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins, Instinct) is the general of the Roman
Army, and the country expects the warrior to fill the position of
Emperor upon his return.  Titus declines and throws his support to the
son of the previous ruler, Saturninus (Alan Cumming, the voice of the
Devil in God, The Devil and Bob), over his brother and rival Bassianus
(James Frain, Reindeer Games).  Saturninus' first duty is to choose a
wife, and he picks Bassianus' fiancée Lavinia (Laura Fraser, Cousin
Bette), who refuses to marry the new Emperor.  For a second choice,
Saturninus drafts Tamora (Jessica Lange, Cousin Bette), the former Queen
of the recently defeated Goths, as his concubine.
Tamora, whose eldest son Alarbus was sacrificed to the Romans, is
hell-bent on revenge and eagerly accepts the role of Empress.  She
brings along her black lover Aaron the Moor (Harry J. Lennix, Get on the
Bus) and two wicked sons, Demetrius (Matthew Rhys) and Chiron (Jonathan
Rhys-Meyers, Ride With the Devil).  The sons are both after Lavinia,
while Aaron has schemes of his own cooking.  The boy, who we learn is
the son of Titus' son Lucious (Peter Gabriel lookalike Angus MacFadyen,
Cradle Will Rock), watches things develop as sort of a surrogate
audience.
Writer/director Julie Taymor, who recently directed the award-winning
Broadway hit The Lion King, has her actors deliver their soliloquies
directly into the camera, using extreme close-ups.  But that's far from
the only unique stamp Taymor puts on Titus.  Like the recent adaptation
of Richard III with Sir Ian MacKellen, this film has its way with time.
One moment, it's Caesar's Rome and the next it's World War II Italy.
The film also features some very modern sounding music, and many of the
characters sport tattoos.  And, Lord, is this film gruesome!  But
despite all of the gore, the more gruesome scenes are strongly implied,
instead of being shown on the screen.
As good as the acting is in Titus (Hopkins' role seems like a warm-up
for his next turn as Hannibal Lecter), the real stars are the
art/production/costume designers.  Taymor's crew features a bevy of
Oscar winners and nominees that have worked on films like Kundun, Dune,
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Chariots of Fire and Barry Lyndon.
Sadly, only Milena Canonero was recognized by the Oscars for her
incredible costumes.  I would have given her the trophy from the first
scene alone.
Titus is the second major accomplishment from a stage-turned-film
director this year, after Sam Mendes' (The Blue Room) critically
acclaimed American Beauty.  What would make such successful stage stars
run for the hills of Beverly?  I did hear that Kathie Lee was on
Broadway.

Review for Midsummer Night's Dream, A (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Never before have the great Bard's words sounded more clunky than here
in Michael Hoffman's (One Fine Day) screen adaptation of Shakespeare's
whimsical romance.  What the Puck happened?
You can't blame the story  it's a classic.  But why does it take a full
60 minutes for Hoffman's script to really get moving?  You can't blame
the production crew (featuring Oscar winners for Howards End and The Age
of Innocence)  they create a wonderfully lush dream world.  But its
leafy green paradise is almost obscured by a bigger, brighter,
olive-hued disaster.
That's right  I'm talking about Calista Flockhart's teeth, and the way
she shrieks each line sort of makes you want to jam your finger down her
throat, too.  Love may make fools of us all, but Ally McAnnoying sets a
whole new standard.  (1:55  PG-13 for adult situations and brief
nudity)

Title
Review for Besieged (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Upon viewing Bernardo Bertolucci's last film, Stealing Beauty, I figured
him for a dirty old man.  The tight crotch shot on Liv Tyler as the
opening credits rolled and, later, Tyler on all fours licking a mirror
at the request of Jeremy Irons were both dead giveaways.  But it turns
out that with his latest picture, Bertolucci proves that he is a bore as
well as a pervert.
Beseiged (it was actually called The Siege until the Bruce Willis dud
hit theaters first) features a story simpler than can be found in any
bad American soap opera: A wealthy white guy falls for his black maid
who can't reciprocate his feelings because she's married to a political
prisoner.  That's it.
The white guy is Jason Kinsky (David Thewlis, Seven Years in Tibet), the
owner of the palatial Roman home cared for by Shandurai (Thandie Newton,
Beloved).  He sits at home all day and plays the piano, while she
prefers the music of the native land that she has fled.  That's it.
The two hardly share words, let alone anything in common.  On the plus
side, Bertolucci does effectively use the home's dumbwaiter, symbolizing
the social distance between Jason and Shandurai, who performs her duties
in order to put herself through medical school.  And there are some
great shots involving the giant spiral staircase in the massive
dwelling, warmly shot by cinematographer Fabio Cianchetti.  But that's
it.
Hey, at least it's not too long.  (1:30  R for nudity, mild violence,
adult situations and language)

Title
Review for Summer Catch (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
They say a voiceover is a sure sign of a weak film, but what about a movie
with multiple voiceovers in the first few minutes?  That's what you get with
Summer Catch, the third collaboration between Freddie Prinze, Jr and Matthew
Lillard (the fourth - Scooby-Doo - will be out next summer).  They're like
the Burt Reynolds (an unexplainably popular, blander-than-bland heartthrob)
and Dom DeLuise (a guy who people think is funny but really isn't) for the
new millennium.
Casting aside his fondness for making only crappy films with three-word
titles, Prinze (She's All That, Down To You, Boys and Girls, Head Over
Heels) has now ventured into the hitherto unknown realm of making crappy
films with two-word titles.  Catch is to baseball what The Replacements was
to football last year (and, in fact, baseball is to fall 2001 what football
was to fall 2000, with Hardball hoping to become this year's Remember the
Titans).
Prinze, who is by now completely interchangeable with MTV tool Carson Daly,
plays Ryan Dunne, the son of a blue-collar landscaper in Chatham,
Massachusetts who is about to embark on his first season of
semi-professional baseball.  The catch is he's playing for the hometown
Chatham A's in the Cape Cod League - a summer league tailored for kids who
have just left college in hopes of being chosen by Major League scouts for
their own farm teams.  So our Ryan has gone from mowing the grass at the
local ballpark to mowing down batters with his 95 mph fastball.
But that's not the only mowing Ryan is doing.  He's also in a relationship
with a rich girl named Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel, 7th Heaven), who is
spending the summer in her family's vacation home in Chatham.  Of course,
her dad (Bruce Davison, crazy/beautiful) doesn't approve of his daughter
hanging around with the boy who cuts the grass.  But that hardly matters to
Ryan, especially when Tenley's outfits get skimpier and skimpier as Catch
progresses.
Of course, Ryan's problematic love life isn't the only thing on his mind.
He's got a history of self-destructing on the mound, and his hot temper
could cost him an opportunity to perform well at the obligatory Big Game.
A's coach John Schiffner (Brian Dennehy, Death of a Salesman) takes a
shining to the boy, but I think it has more to do with his plans to gobble
Ryan up like a chicken wing, as Dennehy is as big as the Green Monster.
In addition to Prinze's atrocious, half-hearted attempt at a chowdah accent,
you'll also be treated to a bunch of subplots involving Ryan's distant
relationships with his dad (Fred Ward, Road Trip) and brother (Jason
Gedrick, TV's The Beast), countless shots of people enjoying Sam Adams beer,
as well as various sexual hijinks involving the other players on the team
(including one with Beverly D'Angelo and That '70's Show's Wilmer Valderrama
that was lifted right from Bull Durham).  The only remotely interesting
character is Katie (Zena Grey, Snow Day), Tenley's younger sister who knows
a lot about baseball (a la the precocious kids from Titans) and tries to
become the team's mascot.
A movie about Katie would have been ten times more fascinating, assuming
director Michael Tollin and writer John Gatins wouldn't be involved.  This
dynamic duo produced 2000 low-point Ready To Rumble, which starred Lillard's
spastic doppelganger, David Arquette.  One can only imagine Kevin Falls'
(Sports Night, The West Wing) sole contribution to the script was the oddly
stirring speech given to Ryan by one of his local buddies.  It seemed
incredibly out of place in a film whose big laughs are centered around men
wearing thong underwear.

Review for All the Rage (1999)
This film in which guns play a major part in each pivotal scene is
probably supposed to start out as humorous look at the impact of
firearms in modern society before becoming shockingly appalling in its
last reel. The problem is that It's the Rage is neither funny nor
disturbing, and even its eclectic A-list cast can't save it from being
yet another bad Pulp Fiction rip-off.
Rage begins in the home of Warren and Helen Harding (played by
Pleasantville co-stars Jeff Daniels and Joan Allen), a wealthy yet
miserable couple that are awakened late one evening by what appears to
be a burglar. Warren guns down the intruder in the living room, but it
isn't until afterwards that he realizes that the prowler was actually
his business partner. Helen thinks her husband knowingly executed his
colleague, while Warren assumes that his associate was secretly
schtupping his wife. The cops (Robert Forster and Bokeem Woodbine) don't
know who to believe but are pretty sure that something fishy is going
on.
With murder acting as the final straw for their marriage, Helen moves
out and gets a job as an assistant to an insane billionaire named Norton
Morgan (Gary Sinise, Mission to Mars), who has made a fortune doing
something with computers, while simultaneously developing a fear of any
type of information. Norton chased away his previous assistant and now
spends his days cooped up in his giant office playing with his cyber-dog
and doesn't appear to be too into hygiene (but what computer billionaire
is?).
Norton's former assistant (Josh Brolin, The Mod Squad) dreams of making
movies for a living but instead finds work as a video store clerk and
develops a unhealthy fixation on a bleached-blonde, Bosco-stealing
delinquent named Annabel Lee (Anna Paquin, Rogue from X-Men). Rage also
features characters played by André Braugher (Frequency), David
Schwimmer (Friends) and Giovanni Ribisi (Gone in 60 Seconds), and all of
the film's characters are linked to each other, whether they know it or
not. In that respect, Rage is a bit like Magnolia or Short Cuts, but not
nearly as interesting or as well-executed as either.
While the acting in Rage isn't too bad, the script seems particularly
hackneyed. The whole harried-assistant-to-a-psychopath has already been
done to perfection by Frank Whalley (Swimming With Sharks) and Philip
Seymour Hoffman (The Big Lebowski). The bickering couple who live in the
large, soulless house reeks of Lester and Caroline Burnham (even though
Rage was completed before American Beauty was released). I can't think
of anything much worse than a film that thinks it's edgy and quirky but
just plain isn't.
Rage, which will see a brief theatrical run before bowing on pay
television, was directed by James D. Stern, who has recently helmed the
IMAX film Michael Jordan to the MAX, as well as directing Stomp on
Broadway. The script was written by Keith Reddin, who penned the play
Life During Wartime (adapted for the screen as The Alarmist), and Devo's
Mark Mothersbaugh (The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle) provides the
score.

Review for Where the Money Is (2000)
The only thing worse than a dumb movie is a dumb movie that clocks in at
two hours.  Lately it seems that a running time that shatters the
120-minute mark is a prerequisite  even for films that have very simple
premises.  As a result, these interminable pictures get bogged down in
unnecessary character development and boring sub-plots.  Look at The
Skulls  it had the content of an after-school special and a running
time that rivaled the entire Roots miniseries.  Look at the upcoming
Love and Basketball  a run-of-the-mill romance that took longer to
unfold than an actual NBA game.
Then look at Where the Money Is.  The script is concise and doesn't try
to be too clever or quirky.  It's a simple story that doesn't even
threaten to present futile subplots or intense character growth.  At an
ultra-lean 88 minutes, Money is short, sweet and to-the-point.  And it's
got Paul Newman playing a quick-thinking con man  a role that seems to
have worked pretty well in the past for the blue-eyed septuagenarian.
Newman (Message in a Bottle) plays Henry Manning, a criminal mastermind
well known for selling security systems to banks, only to rob them blind
at a later date.  He's been incarcerated, but as Money opens, we learn
that Henry has just had a stroke and we see him being transported from a
maximum-security prison to a nursing home in rural Oregon.  Newman nails
the stroke victim role pretty well, as he sits slumped over in his chair
and stares into space with a slacked jaw and the occasional twitch. Wait
 that makes him sound like a wrestling fan.
Enter nurse Carol Ann McKay (Linda Fiorentino, What Planet Are You
From?) who, for some reason, suspects that Henry is faking his stroke,
which, of course, he is.  Carol is suspicious from the get-go, but Henry
never cracks, even when she bends over to reveal her pert buttocks, or
gives him a steamy lap-dance, or when she knocks boots with her husband
Wayne (Dermot Mulroney, Goodbye, Lover) in Henry's room.
Henry eventually does break (otherwise there's wouldn't be any point to
the film), and when that happens, Carol convinces him to go after one
last score, offering herself and her dimwitted husband as partners.
They target an armored car, hit a few minor snags along the way, and
then the film ends.  Like I said - short, sweet and to-the-point.
Money was directed by Marek Kanievska, who hasn't helmed a feature film
project since 1987's Brat Pack fest Less Than Zero, which, ironically,
was based on a book by Brett Easton Ellis, who wrote American Psycho 
one of the films Money is pitted against in this weekend's box office
race.  The screenplay was based on a story by E. Max Frye (Palmetto) and
was written by Frye and debut scriptwriters Topper Lilien and Carroll
Cartwright.  While their film doesn't have much substance or style, it's
still a pleasure to watch.

Review for Drive Me Crazy (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Coinciding with the controversial appearance of its star's near-nude
turns on the covers of Maxim and Bikini, Drive Me Crazy literally drove
me crazy with a horrible, formula-driven script and a lead performance
that was even worse.  It's the tried-and-true story of a guy and girl
that pretend to be in love in order to regain the affection of their
exes, only to end up falling for each other.  Oh, Christ  I hope that
didn't ruin the ending for you.  The name was changed from Next to You,
presumably to include the smash hit `Crazy' from the saline-assisted
teen pop star Britney Spears.
The girl is Nicole Maris (Melissa Joan Hart, Sabrina the Teenage Witch),
the peppy, popular (read: annoying) senior responsible for organizing
Timothy Zonin High School's Centennial events.  Nicole lives with her
single mom (Faye Grant, V) and has little contact with the father that
ran out on them (Stephen Collins, 7th Heaven).  She also contributes the
school's news broadcast  called Time Zone  each morning at the
beginning of the day.  Nicole's biggest problem in life is that she is
seriously crushing on TZ's star basketball player, Brad (Gabriel
Carpenter).  But don't worry  he asks her to the big Centennial dance.
The guy is Chase Hammond (Adrian Grenier, The Adventures of Sebastian
Cole), the dark, brooding senior that thinks popularity is superfluous,
referring to most students as `sheep.'  He lives with his widower pop
(William Converse, Kiss the Girls) and dates a gothy vamp named Dulcie
(Ali Larter, Varsity Blues).  A practical joker, Chase put orange dye in
the school's sprinkler system and roared with laughter as the brightly
dressed TZ `sheep' were doused with colored water.  In his defense,
orange is the school's color, and he was just being spirited.
Long story short, Brad dumps Nicole for a cheerleader from a rival
school, while Chase is dumped by Dulcie because he doesn't want to talk
all the time (and I thought goth chicks were above that).  The dumpees
band together to get their respective exes jealous.  She gives him a
mall make-over and takes him to basketball games, while he drags her to
a club called The Pit to ponder stuff.  They both fit in to their new
roles way too easily, especially Chase, who in no time is cheering `GO!
FIGHT!  WIN!' at a school basketball game.  I thought they might have
been chanting ` GO FRIGHTWIG!' which would have been an interesting arc
in the film.
Two points of interest in the film include the appearance of punk
rockers The Donnas (as The Electro-Cutes, covering `Keep On Lovin' You,'
no less) and a nifty video segment that a nerdy AV kid sneaks onto the
Time Zone broadcast.  There is also an interesting angle to the picture,
in that Nicole and Chase are neighbors and former treehouse-mates that
saw their friendship dissolve during middle school and the onset of
popularity's importance.  She remembers his mom dying, but was too cool
to offer condolences at the time.
Drive Me Crazy is based on Todd Strasser's novel titled `How I Created
My Perfect Prom Date' and adapted for the screen by Cookie's Fortune
hack Rob Thomas.  The nicest thing I can say about Hart's performance is
that she does not have a face that was made for the big screen.
Possibly radio, but not FM.  She struggles to be merely adequate in her
role, while the adorably talented Grenier is so painfully above this
crappy material, it actually makes the movie much less enjoyable.  And
that is really saying something.
1:35 - PG-13 for teen alcohol consumption and drug use, and for mild
adult language

Title
Review for Anna and the King (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
1999 may go down as the Year of the King.  Prolific horror author
Stephen King was able to sandwich a near-fatal accident between The
Storm of the Century and The Green Mile; Frank Whaley's directorial
debut Joe the King was panned by critics; and Return of the King, the
third part of the eagerly anticipated The Lord of the Rings trilogy,
began filming in New Zealand.
But the most curious cinematic King story this year has to be Mongkut 
as in the nineteenth-century King of Siam.  Mongkut has had two films
made about him and his relationship with Anna Leonowens this year.
That's one more film than Schwarzenegger had and two more than Claire
Danes should have made.  It's particularly strange considering that over
forty years have passed since we've seen Mongkut's story on the big
screen.  When Margaret Langdon turned Anna's memoirs into a best-selling
novel in 1944, it took only a dozen years to spawn the drama Anna and
the King of Siam and Rodgers and Hammerstein's hit musical The King & I,
as well as the theatrical version.
First up in 1999 was the critically panned dud The King and I  an
animated remake of the musical with horribly stereotypical characters
and a villain that had suddenly developed supernatural powers.  Now, at
the close of the year, Hollywood serves up a remake of Anna and the King
of Siam, the 1946 drama that starred Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison (in
his film debut).
This version of Anna and the King has a lot to offer, and a lot to be
wary of.  On the plus side is, of course, two-time Oscar winner Jodie
Foster (Contact) tackling the role of Anna.  Another big advantage is
the casting of Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat (The Corruptor) as
King Mongkut.  It marks the first time that an Asian actor has portrayed
the King, who has previously been played by white guys with yellow
makeup doing bad Charlie Chan impressions.  The film also benefits from
a top-quality production team, including two Oscar winners (and a
nominee) from Howard's End.
There are some giant red flags, too.  Director Andy Tennant's last three
films were the disappointing Ever After, the ludicrous Fools Rush In and
the Olsen twins' debacle It Takes Two.  The two credited screenwriters,
Peter Krikes and Steve Meerson, last worked on Jean-Claude Van Damme's
Double Impact.  Their Anna script is just too long and, in the last
reel, even turns into a Van Damme-type action thriller.
The story is the same as it ever was.  Anna, twenty-three months a
widow, is hired to become the royal tutor for the children of the King
of Siam (now Thailand) in 1862 Bangkok.  She's all of the three P's 
prim, proper and prissy, delivering lines through perpetually clenched
jowls.  Accompanying Anna is her giant hat, hoop dress, knee-length hair
extensions and her equally prissy son, Louis (Tom Felton).  Upon her
arrival (I know it looks a lot like Waterworld at first, but don't flee
the theater), Anna refuses to follow protocol, insists on living in a
house outside the walls of the palace and is called `Sir' by all of
Mongkut's underlings.  She's firm and persistent, eventually winning
over the hearts of the King, his fifty-eight kids and even a few of the
King's ten wives.
In the meantime, Mongkut's Siam appears to be under siege by neighboring
Burma, while his General Alak (Randall Duk Kim, The Replacement Killers)
deviously twirls his moustache and maniacally rubs his hands together.
This version of Anna seems to focus more attention on the political
climate of Siam than it needs to.  It also blows about twenty minutes on
a subplot involving Tuptim (Bai Ling, Wild Wild West), the King's newest
concubine.
Foster is, as always, amazing as the lantern-jawed Anna, but the real
surprise here is Chow.  I never thought that I would be able to watch
him in a movie that didn't include his trademark double-fisted brand of
gunplay.  Chow exudes regal charisma like a copious geyser, deftly
stealing all of the film's good lines.  Even when the ending is reduced
to the level of a hokey action picture, Chow shines.
Filmed in Malaysia, Anna certainly looks sumptuous enough.
Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel (Fly Away Home) perfectly captures the
look and feel of Siam's palace, especially during the amazing banquet
scene where Mongkut entertains British emissaries.  Even a hardened
critic like myself found my eyes watering a bit during a couple of
scenes in this film.  But I'm still not sure if it was the emotional
impact or if it was because both of my legs were asleep from sitting in
the theater for so long.

Review for What Planet Are You From? (2000)
This is a perfect example of why you shouldn't judge a book by its
cover.  What Planet Are You From? might be the dumbest name for a
feature film since Stop or My Mom Will Shoot.  And on the surface, the
story of an alien being sent to Earth to impregnate a woman seemed
awful.  Knowing the title of the film, and that it starred Garry
Shandling, I envisioned the actor covered in a Lycra spacesuit with
antennae, wrinkling up his nose and asking everyone if his ass looked
big.
Don't let the name and the plotline scare you off.  Sure, Shandling
isn't much of a leading man, but he did create two of the best
television shows in the last dozen years (Fox's It's Garry Shandling's
Show and HBO's The Larry Sanders Show).  Planets story was conceived by
Shandling, who also shares a screenwriting credit with three other
writers (including Sanders and Analyze This scribe Peter Tolan).  It's
basically just the combination of two old, over-used plot formulas  the
`guy trying to get laid' story and the `fish out of water' story.  Think
of it as a cross between American Pie andwell, anything starring
Brendan Fraser.  Except Planet is very entertaining.
Shandling plays H1449-6, a resident of a planet four solar systems
removed from our own.  Their sphere is thousands of years ahead of Earth
technologically, its inhabitants cloned as opposed to bred.  Thanks to
the cloning, they are also genetically free of emotion and their
shriveled private parts are totally useless.  Of course, their lack of
both sex and emotion makes them want to take over the entire universe.
H1449-6 is hand-picked by Graydon (Ben Kingsley, Alice in Wonderland),
the planet's leader, to travel to Earth and father a child in what will
be the beginning of their slow transformation of Earth into a planet
full of similarly dressed, sexless clones.  Which makes it sound like
the crowd at a NASCAR race.
H1449-6 assimilates into Phoenix, Arizona as Harold Anderson, a banker
specializing in commercial and residential lending.  Armed only with
corny pick-up lines, Harold starts trying to get laid before he even
hits terra firma.  Having been taught that complimenting women will lead
to fornication, Harold is surprised when his `You smell nice' and `I
like your shoes' greetings are rebuffed by every female he comes in
contact with.  To make matters worse, Harold was also fitted with a
mechanical penis that whirs to life at the slightest hint of a sexual
encounter, growing louder and louder as the chance of sex approaches.
Harold comes in contact with a zany bunch of Earthlings, including his
pussyhound co-worker (Greg Kinnear, Mystery Men), an FAA agent (John
Goodman, Bringing out the Dead) and a struggling real estate agent
(Annette Bening, American Beauty) that eventually becomes the target for
his super sperm.  Sure, there are problems with the script (why isn't
his mission to knock up as many women as possible?) and anyone should be
able to figure out that Harold will start to act like an Earth male and
develop emotions, but Planet is a still a laugh-riot.
Planet was directed by Mike Nichols (Primary Colors), who successfully
captures Shandling's unique brand of humor and is nearly able to pull
off the idea of the awkward comedian as a leading man.  The acting is
fine all around, especially Bening, who, once again, plays a real estate
agent (a la her Oscar-nominated turn in American Beautyand when did
Bening replace Jane Wyman as Columbia's torchbearer?).  Planet co-starts
Linda Fiorentino, Camryn Manheim, Nora Dunn and Ann Cusack, while
Janeane Garofalo appears in just one scene.

Review for Others, The (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Alejandro Amenábar's new film, The Others, begins with a scream and ends
with the best goosebump-inducing finale since The Sixth Sense.  The shriek
comes from Grace (Nicole Kidman, Moulin Rouge), the mother of two children
living on a giant, fog-shrouded estate on the Isle of Jersey, just off the
coast of England.  The year is 1945, and although World War II has ended,
Grace's husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston, Gone in 60 Seconds) hasn't
returned home, or even sent word regarding his whereabouts.
A missing husband is one thing, but migraine-prone Grace has plenty of other
things to worry about.  Her two kids, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas
(James Bentley), are both allergic to sunlight, and the small group of
servants that used to tend to the house have all mysteriously vanished.
It's no surprise the children make references to a recent nervous breakdown
suffered by their mother.  You try living in a house with no electricity, no
radio and no phone, with sickly kids and each passing day reducing the odds
that your spouse is still alive.
After placing an ad for new help, Grace takes on a group of three servants -
Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan, Waking Ned Devine), Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes)
and the mute Lydia (Elaine Cassidy, Felicia's Journey) - nd instructs them
about the importance of locking every door in the house. "No door is to be
opened before the previous one is closed," Grace tells them, explaining that
the beams of sunlight must be contained to protect her children (like
sunlight could possibly make its way through the thick, choking fog.)
Then the typical horror-movie stuff starts - footsteps, voices and the like.
Anne even swears she's seen other people in the house, but the deeply
religious Grace doesn't believe any of it, pointing an accusatory finger at
Mrs. Mills and her sidekicks, thinking they're trying to run her and her
children out of the mansion.  In a way, The Others is a little like The
Shining, with a family of three trying to contend with complete isolation
and each other.  But, as we learn time and time again, things are never what
they seem in the movies.  There are enough red herrings in The Others to
keep you guessing until the very end.
Mad props must be given to Amenábar (Open Your Eyes), who, in his
English-language debut, serves as writer, director and even provides some
creepy music, to boot (he also scored The Butterfly, which was directed by
Others producer José Luis Cuerda).  Amenábar's manipulation of light (or,
more precisely, the lack thereof) is nothing short of genius, as
demonstrated in the film's opening credits.  He uses the darkness to make
you feel claustrophobic, and with the deliberately slow, tension-building
pace, you begin to grow accustomed to the shadows, just like Grace.  You
don't realize how enveloping it is until a curtain is thrown back, revealing
colors previously blanketed by the gloom.  This is practically a
black-and-white film; it legitimately looks 40 or 50 years old.
Adding to the aged feel of The Others is Kidman, who may give her greatest
performance here (it's easily her best since To Die For).  She's doing her
finest Grace Kelly impression, and she does it wonderfully.  The Others,
which was produced by Kidman's soon-to-be-ex-hubby Tom Cruise (the star of
Cameron Crowe's American adaptation of Amenábar's Open Your Eyes), would
have been the perfect Halloween flick, but, unfortunately, must cut a wide
path around hokey monster movies like the remake of William Castle's 13
Ghosts as well as teen slasher flicks like Jeepers Creepers and the new
Halloween installment.  This isn't the kind of thing you want to see in a
big, heartless chain theatre, where the barely audible whispering on screen
will be lost in the stadium seating and cup holders.  It's an arthouse
summer popcorn flick that will have the misfortune of landing in megaplexes.

Review for Live Nude Girls Unite! (2000)
First things first  Live Nude Girls Unite! isn't a sequel to Live Nude
Girls, the 1995 sex comedy with Kim Cattrall and Dana Delany (thank
God).  Unite! is actually a documentary about a struggling lesbian
stand-up comedian who becomes a peep show dancer to make ends meet.
While the film starts out as a goofy demonstration of women using their
`feminine powers' (read: stripping for men) to get ahead in life, the
film quickly focuses on the strippers from a small San Francisco parlor
who launch a six-moth battle to become the first unionized strip club in
the country.
Julia Query (her stage name) moved from New York City to San Francisco
at 27 to become a writer and a comedian, but quickly found that it just
wasn't paying the bills.  She needed a job that paid well but had
flexible hours, and found it at the Lusty Lady Theatre.  Sure, Julia
could have made more money if she performed in stage shows or gave lap
dances at other clubs, but she couldn't dance (luckily, there's a pole
for her to hold on to at the peep show).  And the Lusty Lady was run by
woman managers, so it seemed like a perfect fit for the daughter of a
Jewish doctor well known as an activist for safe prostitution in New
York.
Before long, however, Julia found out that the club wasn't all it was
cracked up to be.  The management discriminated against, among other
things, race, age and hair color.  There was no sick pay and no health
insurance, and missing a shift usually resulted in termination.  There
was a growing concern that the dancers were being filmed by patrons
through one-way mirrors in each private booth.  In general, the girls
were getting paid less and less to do more and more, and there was an
increased sense of danger to boot.
At the mere mention of the word `union,' the club's management hired
anti-union lawyers to break up the possibility of the dancers banding
together.  Unite! follows the trials and tribulations of the lengthy
battle to unionize the club's strippers.  There's also an interesting
subplot, where Julia tries to hide her stripping (and lesbianism) from
her distinguished mother.
Co-directed by Query and Vicky Funari, Unite! is a film that would make
Michael Moore proud.  It effectively blends serious subject matter with
a deft comedic edge.  There's something very funny about seeing a wall
of time cards with names like Velvette, Ginger, Sapphire and Isis, not
to mention hearing the strippers chant, `Two, four, six, eight  don't
go in to masturbate' while picketing the club.

Review for Baise-moi (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If somebody told me there was a non-porn film with more money shots than
Happiness, I just wouldn't believe them.  But that film does exist, and it's
called Baise-moi (depending on which circle you run in, the direct
translation of the title is either Rape Me or Fuck Me).  The film was tossed
out of the 1999 Toronto International Film Festival (only to return in 2000
with an edited rape scene) and was banned in its native France just three
days after it opened.
So what's the hubbub?  Baise-moi is equal parts Thelma and Louise, Natural
Born Killers and Cum Suckers From Outer Space IV.  It's about a
pornography-addicted hooker (who kills her uptight roommate) and a porn-star
rape victim (who kills her brother) who meet after missing the last train
one dark evening.  The two "ladies" hit the road, pick up random men, screw
the shit out them and then, depending on their overall level of sexual
gratification, torture and kill the gentlemen.  They're ruthless, they have
no regret, and since both actresses are porn stars in real life, the film is
full of gratuitous penetration shots that would rival those seen in a
triple-X feature if the digital video production wasn't so damn grainy.
Baise-moi was made to make viewers uncomfortable, and in that regard, the
film can be considered a success.  There isn't much happening artistically
here; it's just a lot of humping and killing.  I've been begging for more of
each in my diet of film, and now that I have them, I feel kind of nauseous.

Review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)
Nobody has ever made a feature-length film based on a Dr. Seuss book,
and you'd better believe that nobody has ever been crazy enough to
attempt a live-action version of the good doctor's stories.  The reason
for this becomes painfully evident almost immediately in How the Grinch
Stole Christmas.  The sets are horrendously cheap-looking.  It seems as
though the filmmakers were going for a Willy Wonka & the Chocolate
Factory effect, but the overall gaudiness of everything smacks of the
last two Batman films.  And the fact that it took over $120 million to
make a film based on a 70-page book is a little alarming as well.
Luckily, Jim Carrey is a strong enough star to overcome the rest of this
mess.  The Grinch, based on Seuss' 1957 children's classic, will
probably be a big commercial hit no matter what any critics think. Which
brings up another interesting point  Seuss' story is supposed to be a
rallying cry against the commercialism of the holidays, but you can bet
your ass the film will have product placement tie-ins out the wazoo.  At
the end of the book, The Grinch sheepishly admits `maybe Christmas
doesn't come from a store,' but they're the only place you'll be able to
get your official Grinch merchandise.
Carrey (Me, Myself & Irene) stars as the titular Grinch, a green-fur-
covered, onion-eating creep with a heart two sizes too small.  He lives
on the mountain peak that overlooks Whoville, a town full of cheerful
people known as Whos (they're all pretty freaky looking in the face,
hair and teeth departments).  Whoville loves Christmas, as evidenced by
its residents shopping up a storm in the film's opening scene.  For the
holiday, Whoville celebrates something called a Who-biliation, and this
year marks the festival's 100th anniversary.
We learn the origin of The Grinch  a funny tale added here to pad the
film's running time - but the film's main focus is on the relationship
between the cold-hearted Grinch and precocious little Cindy Lou-Who
(Taylor Momsen).  She seems to be the only person in Who-ville
interested in giving the green grump another chance at redeeming his
social status in town.  Despite the girl's good intentions, The Grinch
still raids the town on Christmas Eve, absconding with everything
related to the holiday and hauling it up to the top of his mountain.
The Grinch started to get on my nerves after about 30 minutes, but then
Carrey's screen time was increased, which jump-started my interest in
the film.  He really saves the movie when it starts to slip off the
tracks. That said, Carrey's rendition of Burl Ives' `You're a Mean One,
Mr. Grinch' is a disaster, but the montage of him creating various evil
devices are pretty cool despite the song.  Momsen's gut-wrenching
rendition of the James Horner (Titanic) penned `Christmas, Why Can't I
Find You,' is much more enjoyable.  The film is at its best when it
sticks to the book's original narrative, provided here by Sir Anthony
Hopkins (M:I-2).
Although he didn't seem to affect many of the kids at my screening of
the film, this Grinch would have scared the crap out of me if I were a
little kid (my fear of the Hamburglar almost turned me into a child
vegetarian).  When was the last time you took your kids to a movie that
featured a $20 million star wearing a big, furry codpiece?  Plus, The
Grinch has piercing yellow eyes (so help me, God, yellow eyes).  Anybody
who knows anything about decent Christmas films knows this is the sign
of pure anti-holiday evil (see A Christmas Story  a real holiday
classic).
Like Battlefield Earth, there aren't many shots in The Grinch that
aren't off-kilter.  The effect is annoying, and makes it look like
director Ron Howard (Edtv) and crew were filming during an avalanche.
Howard predominately uses the same production team he's worked with on
his previous films, but he's never made a picture quite like The Grinch
before.  The sets looked like they'd collapse under the weight of a wee
kitten.
For some reason, Audrey Geisel (Seuss' widow) gave Howard and his
production company the okay to make the film after years and years of
rebuffing Hollywood's attempt to make her husband's story into a
feature-length film (he, apparently, was pleased enough with the cartoon
version).  Geisel was able to finagle veto power over the film, putting
the kibosh on several jokes she referred to as `bathroom humor' (despite
signing off on the casting of Carrey) and a scene that sounded pretty
anti-Semitic (it involved the Who-Steinsseriously).  The offensive
material comes from the odious duo of Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman
(Wild Wild West).

Review for Luzhin Defence, The (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The Big Game - it's a cliché that's used in just about every sports flick.
The best films about competition are usually about something else besides
the contest, especially when they involve sports that aren't exciting enough
to build an entire story around.  That's the case with The Luzhin Defence, a
film that, at least superficially, is about a big chess competition in 1929,
but beneath the surface it tells the tale of a reclusive man coming out of
his shell.
The man is Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and
The Big Game is the World Chess Championships, which are being held at a
ritzy hotel in Italy's Lake Como.  Luzhin is an introverted Grand Master of
the game who dresses sloppily and shuns contact with other humans (kind of
sounds like a film critic, huh?).  He also suffers from what we can assume
is some form of obsessive-compulsive disorder and comes off a bit like the
Rain Man of chess, carefully planning out strategies every waking moment of
his day.
Enter Natalia (Emily Watson, Trixie), a young woman who just happens to be
staying at the same resort that is playing host to the chess tournament.
Natalia's mom (Geraldine James) is anxious to marry her daughter off and has
already lined up a wonderful suitor in Comte de Stassard (Christopher
Thompson).  But wouldn't you know it - Natalia ends up falling in love with
Luzhin.  The two meet cute when she retrieves an item that has dropped
through a hole in the pocket of his tattered clothes.  He proposes, almost
instantly, and she accepts, asking, "Would it not be appropriate to know my
name first?"  So you know her mom has got to be thrilled.
As the film progresses, we learn more and more about Luzhin, like that he
was a child prodigy who was managed by a man who now coaches his most
capable competitor.  We see clunky flashbacks to his mop-topped youth - his
parents fought and he was afraid of school, so little Luzhin poured all of
his energy into the piano and, before you know it, he's playing Rach III on
stage in front of...wait.  Wrong movie.  I meant chess. He pours his energy
into chess.  Seriously, though, Luzhin is more than a little similar to
Shine.  They share the same narrative structure, and there's even a tub
scene (Luzhin doesn't poop in the water, though).  Like David Helfgott,
Luzhin doesn't so much fall in love with Natalia as latch on to her.
Turturro does well, making a potentially unlikable character pretty
sympathetic to the viewer.  Like Enemy at the Gates, Luzhin is another film
where all of the Russian characters speak with English accents.  In addition
to Turturro's standout performance, Luzhin also features a lovely score
(Alexandre Desplat) and pretty cinematography (Bernard Lutic, I Dreamed of
Africa).
Luzhin was directed by Marleen Gorris (Mrs. Dalloway) and adapted from
Vladimir Nabokov's novel by Peter Berry.  Nabakov based Luzhin's character
on real-life chess Grand Master Curt von Bardeleben, who checked out in a
manner similar to Luzhin.  You know with a Nabokov story you're going to get
obsession that turns into tragedy, and Luzhin doesn't do anything to make
you think otherwise.  It's a simple, predictable story, and its chess scenes
aren't nearly as dazzling as Searching for Bobby Fischer, but Luzhin is
still moderately entertaining.

Review for Spaceman (1998)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Plenty of people have never heard of The Onion, a satirical weekly newspaper
out of Madison, Wisconsin, and even those who regularly read the hysterical
tabloid may not know about Scott Dikkers.  He was an early contributor to
The Onion and eventually became the newspaper's head writer, in addition to
co-authoring the best-selling spin-off book, Our Dumb Century.
Back in 1997, Dikkers wrote, directed and produced an ultra-low-budget
B-movie called Spaceman, which is just now being released on video before a
television debut on the Sci-Fi Channel later this year.  The film is a
throwback to the cheesy sci-fi fare that you'd find at a '50s matinee, but
with somewhat of a modern twist.  Imagine taking a killer alien from one of
those films and plopping him in modern-day Chicago, and you've got a pretty
good idea of what Spaceman is all about.
The film opens with a brief scene that shows a four-year-old boy being
abducted by a spaceship before flashing forward 25 years, where the boy has
returned to Earth as an adult (David Ghilardi).  Spaceman works at a
supermarket, where he's a model employee who calls the manager "Commander"
while everyone laughs behind his back.  Okay, so he wears a spacesuit to
work and appears a bit robotic, but sheesh - they could cut him some slack.
That part of Spaceman seemed promising, and a little like Office Space, but
the story takes a nosedive when Spaceman is fired for apprehending a
shoplifter.  He spends the rest of the film looking for someone to command
him in fights to the death (which is, apparently, what he used to do back
home), while being chased by a pair of FBI agents who seem just as obsessed
with slicing and dicing aliens as the Robert Stack-voiced FBI character in
Beavis and Butt-Head Do America was preoccupied with deep anal exams.  He
also learns about love when he falls for an Earth babe - his neighbor Sue
(Deborah King).
Ghilardi's performance is purposely one-note, and he comes off as a funny
cousin to Servotron lead singer Z4-OBX.  The rest of the cast didn't do much
for me, and since all the actors appeared to be approximately the same age,
Spaceman felt just like a student film (having a meager $50,000 budget
probably didn't help, either).  The film is poorly lit, very badly dubbed
and parts look like they were shot through wax paper.  Spaceman is a little
like Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Orgazmo - another film that showed some
potential but, for the most part, was pretty unwatchable  Unlike Orgazmo's
over-the-top gross-out gags, Spaceman is full of deadpan humor, with a
serious emphasis on the word "dead."

Review for Chutney Popcorn (1999)
A promising comedy from Nisha Ganatra, Chutney Popcorn is an interesting
film about sibling rivalry taken one step beyond the norm. Ganatra, who
also directed and co-wrote the film, stars as Reena, a motorcycle-riding
henna tattoo artist and photographer in New York City.  She's also
Indian and a lesbian, and Popcorn shows the provocative clash between
the traditional and modern relationships.
Popcorn opens with Reena missing sister Sarita's (Sakina Jaffrey, Cotton
Mary) wedding to Mitch (Nick Chinlund, Third Watch).  Being late is one
thing, but Reena's mom hits the roof when she's tardy and brings
beautiful girlfriend Lisa (Jill Hennessy, Law & Order).  It becomes
clear that Reena can do nothing right in the eyes of her mother and, as
a result, has developed a distinct jealousy toward sister Sarita.
Reena sees her big chance to win Mom's approval when, after several
months of unsuccessful attempts, Sarita announces she's unable to get
pregnant.  Much to the slack-jawed surprise of everyone, Reena steps in
and offers to carry her sister's baby to term, and then give the child
to Sarita and Mitch to raise.
Popcorn's first act sets up the characters, while the second shows Reena
trying to get pregnant (there are several funny turkey-baster scenes).
The third act focuses on the havoc that the pregnancy wreaks in the
relationships of each character, especially between Reena and the
permanency-phobic Lisa.  `She's my sister,' Reena explains, before Lisa
complains, `So you owe her 13 chromosomes?'
There are also a series of frank sexual discussions that take place in
front of a street vendor become somewhat of a running gag in the film.
But the main attraction here is the rivalry between Reena and Sarita.
One is boring and grounded, while the other is a fun-loving free
spirit.  By the time the closing credits role, they've swapped places.
Popcorn features a dizzyingly beautiful soundtrack, featuring Team
Dresch, Maganpop, The Spinanes and The Magnetic Fields.

Review for Pearl Harbor (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The more I think about Pearl Harbor, the more it pisses me off.  It seemed
enjoyable enough while I was watching it, but afterwards, the flaws began to
bubble up through the calculated, jingoistic schlock.  It's a day later and
I'm liking it even less.  Oh, and just so you know, I'm talking about the
film - not the actual events of December 7, 1941.  A lot of you people out
there are too dumb to tell the difference, which accounted for a number of
messages condemning me to a painful death for not feeling enough sympathy
for the men who lost their lives on the Andrea Gail.  I didn't like The
Perfect Storm, but a bad review of that film doesn't mean I'm glad the ship'
s crew are fishing with Jesus now.  Ditto for Harbor.  What follows is a
critique of the film - not history.
Plenty of films use music and imagery to coerce you into feeling emotions
that you may not particularly want to feel, but Harbor takes the
manipulation cake.  On the surface, it appears to be a simple combination of
action and romance, so, a la Titanic, there's something for John and for
Mary.  That's not so bad, but dig a bit deeper and you'll find Harbor to be
a shameless, cunning monster that has carefully checked and double-checked
every important demographic of every potential moviegoer. African-Americans
like films?  Let's add a completely meaningless subplot about a black Navy
cook.  Hillbillies spend money at the theatre nowadays?  Let's give a
Southern accent to both male leads.
That's not so bad either, and it's been done before, so it's easy to
overlook.  But when you consider the parallel between Harbor's revisionist
history and the Japanese box office gross of Titanic, things become a little
more sickening.  James Cameron's film took in over $200 million in Japan, so
Harbor's producers (Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer) had to carefully find a
way to make the antagonist Japanese characters into a likeable bunch that
had no choice but to wipe out most of the U.S. Navy.  They practically made
it seem like the bombing of Pearl Harbor was our fault, just to guarantee a
decent take at the Japanese box office.  Think that's bad?  Variety has
reported that Disney will send special cuts of the film to Germany and Japan
with toned down references to "dirty Japs" and other defamatory slang (like
nobody was hurling slurs like these in the '40s). Now that's artistic
integrity!
On to the story now, and you don't really need a recap if you've seen
Titanic (some scenes were even shot in the same giant water tank).  Harbor
takes about 90 minutes to set up the love triangle between nurse Evelyn
Johnson (Kate Beckinsale, Brokedown Palace) and hayseed pilots Rafe McCawley
(Ben Affleck, Bounce) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett, Here on Earth).  Then
something tragic happens (iceberg/bombing) that is both a special effects
extravaganza and approximately 40 minutes long.  And then somebody dies.
Because Harbor is set during a pivotal moment in World War II, it will draw
unfavorable comparisons to Saving Private Ryan, although its PG-13 rating
doesn't allow the violence to become too gruesome (after all, scaring away
the kids means less cash in the coffers, and this is definitely all about
the money).  Unlike the claustrophobic Ryan, which allowed the viewer to
track a particular group of soldiers during the invasion of Normandy, Harbor
's scope is much grander.  That's not to say it's bad (there's something
about seeing American soldiers caught so off guard that they've got
toothbrushes in their mouths as they watch the Japanese Zeroes spray
everything with bombs and bullets), but it's definitely not as personal and,
as a result, lacks the emotional oomph of even a typical episode of Buffy
the Vampire Slayer.  Is it impressive?  You bet.  Would I see it again?
Only if I showed up 90 minutes late to miss the preamble, which made me feel
like a POW.
While Harbor smacks of both Titanic and Ryan, it thankfully doesn't fall
into the same
set-in-modern-day-but-told-primarily-through-one-long-flashback trap that
served as nothing but a distraction in those two films.  That's about the
only positive thing I can say about Randall Wallace's script, which is yet
more evidence that his Braveheart must have been a total fluke.  Hans Zimmer
's (Hannibal) score is cold and manipulative but does manage to drown out
some of Wallace's cheesy dialogue.  Director Michael Bay (Armageddon)
relaxes his spastic style a bit and, with cinematographer John Schwartzman
(The Rock), concocts some nice-looking scenes (although some, like the
Hartnett/Beckinsale sexual romp through a hangar full of hanging parachutes,
inspire only a gag reflex).
As far as the acting goes, there's only so much you can do with a bad script
and a preponderance of scenes that were probably shot against a blue screen.
Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsale fail to connect with the audience in any
manner whatsoever, and most of the supporting cast isn't around long enough
to make a lasting impression.  Aside from the stammering Ewen Bremner (Spud
from Trainspotting), the rest of the flyboys (William Lee Scott, Michael
Shannon, Matthew Davis) are all identical and as vanilla as their real-life
names.  The nursing crew is compromised of a gaggle of actresses best known
for starring in films/shows with one-word titles (James King, Blow;
Catherine Kellner, Shaft; Jennifer Garner, Felicity; Sara Rue, Popular).
As part of his ongoing effort to tackle every Navy cook role in Hollywood,
Cuba Gooding Jr. (Men of Honor) plays Dorie Miller, one of Harbor's few
characters based in reality, even though the film wouldn't have been a
smidgen different with him.  Dan Aykroyd, Alec Baldwin, William Fichtner,
Tom Sizemore and Colm Feore all log in decent yet small turns, but the best
performance belongs to Jon Voight, who, along with numerous facial
prosthetics, plays Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Review for Chill Factor (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
A silly little action flick, The Chill Factor preaches that `Keeping
Cool is a Matter of Life and Death.'  But they don't mean `cool' like
the Fonz - they mean literally cool, like Hillary Clinton.  In the worst
and most unintentionally hysterical rip-off of Speed yet, the film's two
stars race across Montana to get a deadly biological weapon to an Army
base before  get this  the temperature of the chemical hits fifty
degrees.
The weapon, called Elvis, was created over ten years ago by an Army
scientist, played by David Paymer (Payback).  I think his name is
actually Dr. Richard Long (or directory style - Long, Dick), but I'm not
sure.  While isolated on a tiny desert island, Long tested a very small
amount of Elvis before his computer was done compiling data on the
deadly agent.  Originally intended to affect a 200-yard radius around
the test site, Elvis instead engulfs the entire five-mile island,
killing all eighteen men that were not located within the safety of the
control building.
Long escaped with a slap on the wrist, but his Colonel (played by Peter
Firth, Mighty Joe Young) is tossed in Leavenworth for ten years.  Of
course when he gets out of the clink, he wants to kill Long, steal Elvis
and sell it to foreign countries for - insert Dr. Evil voice here - 100
million dollars.  So Firth heads to Long's current research facility in
Jerome, Montana with a group of ninja-types.  Long story short, the
doctor lives long enough to get Elvis out of there, and Elvis ends up
with Long's fishing buddy Mason (played by Skeet Ulrich, The Newton
Boys), who works the late shift at Darlene's Diner.
Learning about Elvis' temperature restrictions, Mason commandeers an ice
cream delivery truck and, together with its driver (played by Cuba
Gooding Jr., Instinct), the two spend the remaining hour and a half
running from the Colonel and his garrison of black-clad foot soldiers.
Ulrich has the charisma of an orange and Gooding is like Martin Lawrence
turned up to eleven.  Shouldn't Oscar winners be held to higher
standards than the slop he's been pushing?  The only way this could have
been worse is if Jared Leto and Master P were cast in the leading roles.
Among the film's highlights are Ulrich and Gooding, Jr. using a rowboat
to sled down the face of a mountain, which at first sight is a straight
drop-off, but when they're actually hurtling down the hill it has
somehow transformed into a less dangerous forty-five-degree angle.  And
there is the obligatory fight on the roof of the ice cream truck as it
races in and out of tunnels bored into the mountain, which relegates the
bad guy to a Wile-E.-Coyote-type fate.  Are people still entertained by
this?  Thanks to the weapon being nicknamed Elvis, there are also quite
a few witty lines like `Elvis has entered the building' and snappy
comebacks to questions like `Where's Elvis?':  `Dead, last time I
checked.'
Not to be confused with the 1990 Gary Crosby pic of the same name, or
the short-lived 1972 Robert Culp/Eli Wallach televison series, Factor is
the directorial debut of Hugh Johnson (insert additional penis joke
here), who was previously the cinematographer on G.I. Jane.  The film
was scripted by Drew Gitlin and Mike Cheda, the former in his debut and
the latter the screenwriter for something called The Shape of Things to
Come, a sci-fi thriller that only played in Canadian theaters when
released in 1979.  Plus, his name is almost a type of cheese, so that
should tell you something, too.  (1:42 - R for violence and language)

Review for Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you've been thinking about vacationing on one of Greece's Ionian Islands
and you have a lot of time to kill, head down to your local megaplex and
check out Captain Corelli's Mandolin.  Pretty much everybody else should
just stay away.  With its crystal-clear blue water and bone-white sandy
beaches, Mandolin is essentially a really (really) long commercial for the
Greek Tourism Commission.
As if we haven't already had our fill of wartime romances this summer,
Mandolin tries awfully hard to be The English Patient but instead is only
slightly less ridiculously annoying than Pearl Harbor (with fewer
explosions, to boot).  It's about a Greek woman who falls in love with one
of the Italian soldiers occupying her picturesque island during World War
II, which would be kind of like Anne Frank hooking up with Colonel Klink.
Like Patient, it's based on a hip novel (Louis de Berničres' 1994 novel had
a different ending and oodles of homosexual overtones) that you've probably
never heard of before, but Patient it is definitely not.
Mandolin was doomed from the get-go, with original director Roger Michell
(Notting Hill) dropping out after suffering a heart attack just months
before shooting was supposed to start (personally, I think he was faking).
He was replaced by John Madden (Shakespeare in Love), but then one of the
worst casting blunders of all-time occurred when Nicolas Cage was tapped to
play the Italian soldier and Penélope Cruz accepted the role of his Greek
beauty (because all olive-skinned people look alike, right?).
Why can't more filmmakers do like Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi and cast
films with actual people native to the region in which the film is set?
With Mandolin, we get Cage (The Family Man), whose Captain Antonio Corelli
is the only member of his battalion to speak Greek.  When he translates,
he's an American guy who is playing an Italian speaking Greek, but it's
really English.  Makes about as much sense as my long-distance phone bill.
About a half-hour before I saw this film, some entertainment show was
crowing about Cage spending months to master an Italian accent, as well as
learning how to both play the mandolin and conduct an opera.  They made it
seem like he was working on a cure for cancer, and the fact is, his accent
is horrible.  Cage, who has very little experience in period romances,
sounds like Dracula (he always looks like him anyway, to me), and if it
weren't for Shannon Elizabeth in American Pie 2, he'd win the Worst Accent
of the Month Award.
Cruz (Blow) is no better, as her Pelagia is performed by a Spaniard
stumbling over the English language while not even bothering to try to sound
the slightest bit Greek (but all Mediterranean people sound the same,
right?).  Pelagia has spent her whole life on the island of Cephallonia
(which, I think, is the name of the brain tumor you get from using a cell
phone), learning how to practice medicine from her father, Iannis (John
Hurt, Lost Souls).  She gets engaged to a simple fisherman named Mandras
(played by a simple actor named Christian Bale, Shaft), but before you know
it, those damn Italians are amassing at the Greek border on Mussolini's
orders.
Shortly after Mandras heads off to join the Greek partisans, Cephallonia
surrenders to the Italians (after a funny initial response) and the island
becomes "occupied" by a dozen soldiers, led by the mandolin-toting Corelli.
Iannis, who looks an awful lot like Stalin, is forced to put Corelli up in
his house, much to the dismay of Pelagia.  But we learn Corelli is more into
dancing, singing, drinking and swimming than any type of war activity.  He'd
sooner shout "Heil Puccini" than "Heil Hitler," and he tries to acclimate
himself with all of Cephallonia's locals (called Cellephants, perhaps).
Even the blind can see where this story is going.  Pelagia hates Corelli at
first, but she starts to fall for him at the one-hour mark, and they're
playing tonsil hockey about 15 minutes later.  Then, the all-important
unveiling of the Penélopes occurs.  But what will happen when the tides turn
in the War?  How will Italy's surrender affect the island?  Will the
soulless Germans try to occupy Cephallonia?  And, more importantly, will we
get to see the Penélopes again?
If you can stay awake, you'll learn the answers to these important questions
and more at Captain Corelli's Mandolin, playing at a theatre near you.  Just
don't say I didn't warn you.

Review for Dayereh (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Banned in its home country, Jafar Panahi's latest film focuses on the
harrowing plight of women in post-Shah Iran.  The Circle, which won the top
prize (as well as four others) at last year's Venice Film Festival, tells
three different yet painfully similar stories, and all feature performances
from non-professional actresses whose faces can exude more pain and anguish
that the top 10 U.S. box office stars would be able to muster if you pooled
their meager talents.  Julia Schmulia - these young women are the ultimate
Method actors, having grown up not knowing anything but their country's
injustice and prejudice toward women.  Some of the actresses' parents
protested Panahi because they felt his rabble-rousing subject matter could
permanently damage the reputation of their daughters.
Shooting every scene with a handheld camera, Panahi ups the stakes by
omitting the background of each of The Circle's characters.  The first
chapter shows three women trying to turn their temporary freedom from prison
into a more permanent independence.  We don't know what any of them have
done to deserve a prison sentence - we assume it couldn't have been much -
nor do we know how they got out.  The trio is a little like The Powerpuff
Girls in that one is a quick-thinking leader, one beats up boys who harass
them for traveling without a man (a big no-no for Iranian women) and one is
a cute lil' fraidycat.
Of course, the real Powerpuffs wouldn't have gotten nabbed trying to sell a
gold chain on the street to get money for a bus ticket out of town, which is
what happens here.  The cops grab one girl, but Arezou (Maryiam Palvin
Almani) and Nargess (Nargess Mamizadeh) are able to elude capture.  Yet even
after Arezou mysteriously obtains a wad of cash to make the journey to
Nargess' home, the story becomes painfully tragic before Panahi neatly moves
us on to the next episode.
The next two stories involve motherhood in one way or another.  Pari
(Fereshteh Sadr Orfani, the mother from Panahi's The White Balloon and his
assistant director here) is pregnant and desperately wants an abortion.  She
has just been kicked out of her house and is on the lam, but hopes a former
prison-mate-turned-nurse can help her out.  Pari is flabbergasted when she
sees a mother named Nayereh abandon her young child on the street.  The film
ends with a haunting shot - in a sweeping circle, no less - that shows the
outcome of each of the three stories, in addition to the heartbreaking
epilogue to a brief and almost forgotten story that preceded The Circle's
opening credits.
If this was an American film, the women would defy their oppressors in a way
that would make you want to stand up, pump your fist and shout, "You go,
girl!"  But it's not, so don't plan on feeling too chipper on the way out of
the theatre.

Review for Curse of the Jade Scorpion, The (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
There are certain things we've come to expect from a Woody Allen film: the
same music, the same opening credits, the same self-deprecating humor and,
for the most part, a lot of the same acting talent.  His stories often take
place in the 1930s, almost always clock in at under two hours, and are
generally well-received by the press and Oscar (he's a 20-time nominee and
two-time winner).
Despite the somewhat superficial similarities between his films, Woody
always creates original stories.  You can count on him to be daring and
imaginative, year in and year out (literally - he averages at least one film
annually).  No remakes.  No sequels.  You'd sooner see him cheering on
Reggie Miller than writing a derivative, formulaic script.  And he's a
better actor than anyone is willing to admit.
But The Curse of the Jade Scorpion just isn't up to snuff, at least for a
guy who has continually set the bar pretty high.  It's the first film since
1994's Bullets Over Broadway that Woody has made without the help of
Sweetland Films (he's suing former producer Jean Doumanian, and she's suing
him back), and while it's certainly better than most of the hackneyed
romantic comedies out there (like America's Sweethearts, the genre's only
other high-profile summer offering), Scorpion is still disappointing.
Woody (Small Time Crooks) plays C.W. Briggs, an investigator for North Coast
Insurance in late 1930s Manhattan.  He's one of the company's best employees
and, as the film opens, C.W. has just recovered a stolen Picasso from a very
unusual place.  He shuns modern technology (like fingerprinting) in favor of
old techniques and hunches.  When his co-workers ask how he does it, C.W.
informs them that he puts himself in the shoes of the criminal.  "I'd hate
to have me after me," he proudly declares.
That's what they call foreshadowing, kids.  At a birthday party for a
co-worker at the Rainbow Room, C.W. and his arch-nemesis, ball-breaking
efficiency expert Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt, Cast Away), are
hypnotized by a magician named Voltan (David Ogden Stiers) who waves a
supposedly magical jade scorpion in front of them.  Even though the two
passionately hate each other, Voltan gets C.W. and Betty Ann to say
lovey-dovey things to each other while they're under his spell.  Everybody
laughs and goes home, amazed at Voltan's abilities and assuming the trick is
over.
Voltan has other plans, though.  He calls C.W., utters the magic word to put
him under and has him steal millions of dollars' worth of jewels from homes
that he personally has made burglarproof.  He is put in charge of the
investigation and, before long, C.W. is the prime suspect in the heists,
even though he has no memory of committing any crime.
It's pretty easy to stay one step (sometimes two, even) ahead of the plot
(Manhattan Murder Mystery was more of a, uh, mystery).  The rest of Scorpion
focuses on the bizarre relationship between chauvinistic C.W. and Vassar
alum Betty Ann.  The two adversaries trade nasty barb after nasty barb, but
we all know her hurtful words and his threatened masculinity are just a
cover for their attraction to each other - hypnotized or not
While still consistently funny, I can't recall more of Woody's gags falling
as flat as some do in Scorpion.  His C.W. is a sad, horny old man who tells
dated jokes and hits on office bimbos (like Elizabeth Berkeley).  Hunt's
Betty Ann is another educated women who doesn't think twice about boffing
her boss, played by Evolution's Dan Aykroyd (a la Janet McTeer in
Songcatcher).  The horrible things they say to each other, while quite often
humorous, are so surprisingly mean-spirited, I found myself rooting for
Voltan to rake C.W. and Betty Ann over the coals.  And that couldn't have
been Woody's intentions with this film.
Scorpion was photographed by the extremely talented Asian cinematographer
Zhao Fei, who has worked on Woody's previous two films (as well as Chen
Kaige's wonderful The Emperor and the Assassin).  Production designer Santo
Loquasto, who has worked on each of Woody's films since 1987 (that's 15
movies), does a great job at recreating '30s Manhattan (as usual).  And
Woody's direction is typically strong.  It's just a shame his script wasn't.

Title
Review for Mission: Impossible II (2000)
A film like this rarely lives up to its hype.  First, it's the sequel to
a movie that took in over $180 million domestically and over $420
worldwide in 1996.  Helming the project is arguably the greatest
shoot-em-up director of all-time, and the screenplay was written by a
four-time Oscar nominee.  Its acting lead is one of the world's biggest
stars, who is only a few months removed from his third Oscar nod.  Heck,
there's even an unbilled Oscar winner thrown for good measure.  And then
there's the little matter of every other potential summer blockbuster
cutting a wide path around the film's May 24th release date.
Sadly, M:I-2 doesn't live up to the hype.  I'm not saying it's bad
(although everybody else in the theatre seemed to think so)  just
disappointing.  Believe me, I was pulling for it to set the action film
standard for the next four or five years, like M:I-2 director John Woo's
Face/Off did in 1997.  While M:I-2 is better than the last couple James
Bond flicks, it struggles to even duplicate the level of entertainment
created by the first M:I film.  It's still entertaining and fun, in a
check-your-brain-at-the-box-office kind of way.
Tom Cruise (Magnolia) returns as Ethan Hunt, IMF (Impossible Missions
Force) pointman, who, as the film opens, has his rock-climbing vacation
interrupted by an emergency summons to Seville, Spain, where the IMF
boss (played by an uncredited Anthony Hopkins, Titus) dispatches him to
apprehend a malevolent Scotsman (shades of Fat Bastard?) that has
designs on threatening the world with a deadly virus called Chimera.
To complete his mission, Hunt nabs M:I's only other holdover in Luther
Stickell (Ving Rhames, Bringing out the Dead), as well as a wisecracking
agent played by Aussie actor John Polson (The Boys).  Hunt is also
instructed to recruit the services of a civilian master thief named Nyah
Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton, Besieged), who also happens to be an
ex-lover of Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott, Ever After), the IMF's target.
Hunt and Nyah become soulmates after about thirty seconds of contact, at
which point M:I-2 becomes slightly derailed by a lot of unnecessary,
vomit-inducing romance, including a really corny line that I think may
have been stolen from Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans.
Like the original M:I film, the sequel is full of double-crossing via
rubber masks, which look a lot cooler here than they did four years ago,
thanks to advancements in CGI.  There are also some nifty gadgets, such
as a satellite that can capture detailed video of anyone in the world.
And like Face/Off (or any Woo film), there's plenty of double-fisted
gunplay, birds taking flight, martial arts, slow-motion action, and a
chase scene that goes on for a bit too long (it was boats in Face/Off
and it's motorcycles here).  That is to say, there's plenty of this
stuff in the last fifteen minutes.  The rest of the film is pretty light
on all of the exciting things that you would expect from Woo.  In fact,
Woo fans will probably be bitterly disappointed, but then again, they
have slightly unreal expectations because of the director's previous
work.
M:I-2 has a plot so convoluted that they have the bad guy narrate what's
happening during one sequence, and it will still leave you scratching
your head (people complained that the first film was too hard to follow,
which is probably why they tried to add the explanation here).  Hey,
this isn't Chinatown (which screenwriter Robert Towne also penned) -
it's an action flick, implying that there should be action throughout
the film, and not just the last fifteen minutes.
Another big problem is with Scott, who overacts so badly that I thought
he was doing a bad Scottish accent (turns out he's actually from
Scotland).  He's certainly not physically intimidating, and he damn well
isn't creepy enough to pull off a `psychological madman'-type role, like
Alan Rickman in Die Hard, or even Robert Carlyle in The World is Not
Enough.  Is he evil?  Maybe.  Is he diabolical?  Definitely not.
Ambrose doesn't come off any more threatening than anybody else with a
sneer and an accent.
Cruise is simply adequate and, apparently, too short to don the flowing
black trenchcoat usually worn by the lead actors in Woo's films (see Nic
Cage in Face/Off or Chow Yun-Fat in anything).  While M:I-2 has added
the romantic angle, Cruise's character has become a little more human,
but there still isn't much to like about Ethan Hunt, other than hearing
Rhames call him `Efan' instead of `Ethan.'  In short (sorry, Tom), M:I-2
is ridiculously unbelievable, which is something that every entertaining
action flick should be.  But it should have been so much better.
2:08  PG-13 for violence, sexual content and adult language

Review for Luchadoras contra la momia, Las (1964)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Just in case you aren't all mummied out from that high-tech waste of time
starring Brendan Fraser, the Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman House has
dug deep into their vaults and unearthed a film guaranteed to satisfy the
cravings of those of you who love films about guys wrapped in toilet paper.
Or flicks featuring professional wrestling.  Or badly dubbed Mexican movies
from the early '60s.  Or films with really tall women who know how to kick
ass.  That's right -- The Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy is a hybrid of
all those sweet, wonderful things.
Aztec Mummy tells the story of a crazy genius named The Black Dragon (Ramón
Bugarini) who is killing off members of an archeological group in order to
obtain missing pieces of a codex that, presumably, will lead him to a secret
treasure and all the power he'd care to wield. Only one archeologist remains
alive -- Dr. Tracy (Víctor Velázquez), who just happens to be the uncle of
Mike Henderson (Armando Silvestre), who just happens to be romantically
involved with Loretta Venus (Lorena Velázquez, Víctor's real-life daughter),
who just happens to be one-half of the country's favorite women's tag-team
wrestling duo.
The BD and his henchmen have several battles with Tracy, Henderson, Venus
and a handful of other characters, including the obligatory Lou
Costello/Shaggy character (played by Chucho Gómez).  It all culminates in a
ten-minute scene that pits Venus and her partner, The Golden Ruby (Elizabeth
Campbell), against The Dragon's Judo champion twin sisters.  The winner
takes control of the codex pieces.
You're probably wondering when the Aztec Mummy factors into the story (I
know I was -- he doesn't show until the last 20 minutes).  The reformed
codex pieces tell the story of Tezumuc (Gerardo Zepeda), who was buried
alive to protect the breastplate of an Aztec Princess, said breastplate
containing a map that leads to untold riches.  The film doesn't really get
campy until Tezumuc is brought to life when the Princess' breastplate is
stolen, but, brother, those final 20 minutes are a smorgasbord of terrific,
B-movie horror.
Tezumuc is supposed to be a mummy, but he walks and sounds like Frankenstein
and can change into a bat like Dracula.  He resembles Jim Carrey's Fire
Marshal Bill from In Living Color more than anything.  Other unintentionally
funny incidents occur thanks to a stationary hidden camera that can pan
across a room, zoom in for a close-up and, apparently, see through walls
(Mexican technology has really taken a few steps back since the early '60s).
The wrestling scenes involve stunt doubles that look nothing like the
primary actors they're replacing, and several of the women's hairstyles
change within scenes.  It's all so fantastically awful.
Despite the title, there's a surprising lack of
Wrestling-Women-on-Aztec-Mummy action, and the ending doesn't quite resolve
anything.  It's hard to believe, but these characters say even dumber things
than the crap that flew out of Brendan Fraser's pie-hole in The Mummy
Returns (they could blame it on the bad dub job, but Monkey Boy has no
excuse).
Aztec Mummy is actually a sequel to 1962's The Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec
Ape, and it's far from the only Mexican horror flick to feature the titular
Aztec Mummy.  Writers Guillermo Calderón and Alfredo Salazar also penned The
Curse of the Aztec Mummy, The Aztec Mummy vs. the Human Robot, and Attack of
the Aztec Mummy.

Review for Mexican, The (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Whether you're going to get a pre-Ocean's Eleven look at Brad Pitt and Julia
Roberts (they're both in Steven Soderbergh's remake), to see a film with
stylish violence in hopes of cleansing your pallet from the stupid 3000
Miles to Graceland, or to see two gorgeous, larger-than-life Hollywood
superstars interact with each other on the big screen, The Mexican will
likely be a real crowd-pleaser.  Actually, those folks in the last group
might be a bit disappointed that Brad and Julia aren't in too many scenes
together, but the rest of the film is enjoyable enough to make you forget,
or, at least not realize until you're on the way home.
The film opens with the toothy duo in the bedroom of their Los Angeles
apartment.  Sam (Roberts, Erin Brockovich) is all smiley because Jerry
(Pitt, Snatch) is talking her to Las Vegas for vacation later that day.
Jerry, on the other hand, is gnawing on his fingernails because a prior
engagement is going to postpone their trip, and he hasn't had the heart to
tell the high-strung Sam.  It seems that Jerry is in hot water with a local
mobster (Bob Balaban, Best in Show) and needs to perform one last service to
work off the debt.  While it's not immediately clear what Jerry did to end
up in this pickle, we do know his task involves flying to Mexico, picking up
a firearm and delivering it back to the L.A. gangster, who is apparently the
operative for an even bigger fish currently serving time.
When Jerry finally breaks the bad news to Sam, she flips out, tosses his
shit to the curb and takes off, screaming psychobabble about his emotional
shortcomings, while he has no choice but to hop the plane and take care of
his other obligation.  They each have their own adventures and don't meet up
again until the end of the film.  Jerry runs into all kinds of trouble in
Mexico, learning the pistol (it's called The Mexican) he's supposed to
transport is cursed.  In the meantime, wisecracking Sam is taken hostage by
a burly man named Leroy (James Gandolfini, The Sopranos), who uses her to
ensure Jerry doesn't run off (or R-U-N-O-F-F-T, if you've just seen O
Brother) with the valuable gun.
Jerry's character reminded me of Paul Hackett in After Hours.  He's clumsy,
unlucky and now finds himself (sporadically) in possession of a gun with bad
mojo.  All he wants is to get back to Sam and fix their relationship.  Sam
and Leroy, on the other hand, made me think of - don't laugh - The Silence
of the Lambs.  Like Lambs, The Mexican is full of really tight close-ups,
and the relationship between Sam and Leroy is like a lightweight version of
Clarice and Hannibal.  They grow close and dish about their relationships
and childhoods, but you know he could kill her in an instant if necessary.
The Mexican is a high-octane flick on par with True Romance in terms of
romantic and violent content (which is kind of ironic if you remember
Gandolfini sharing an unforgettable hotel scene with the female protagonist
in that film).  It's got the three Ds that make a film like this work -
double-crossing, deceit and dark humor.  There are also several great
flashback scenes where we learn the origin of The Mexican (one features
Julia's brother, Eric).
The drawbacks for The Mexican are pretty minor.  The ending drags a bit, but
it's worth it for the payoff.  The country of Mexico is portrayed as a small
village with eight people.  And if you pay too much time thinking about who
each gangster is working for, your head may explode.  Just sit back and
enjoy the nice photography and good acting by two huge stars (and one pretty
big star).
The Mexican was directed by Gore Verbinski (Mouse Hunt), whose visual style
is greatly enhanced by cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (The Crow, Dark City).
The story was written by J.H. Wyman, who penned the truly awful festival hit
Mr. Rice's Secret.  If the film reminds you a little bit of a Quentin
Tarantino movie, you won't be surprised to learn The Mexican was produced by
Tarantino's right-hand man, Lawrence Bender.

Review for Third Miracle, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The notion of a priest that has lost his faith is almost a cinematic
cliche.  Films often portray men of the  cloth as hard-drinking skeptics
that no longer feel the spark that drove them to work for the big `G,'
until something earth-shattering happens in the final reel that makes
them believers once again.  On paper, The Third Miracle may sound like
one of these films, but it goes out of its way to distance itself from
these films by adding liberal doses of clichés from other genres.
Miracle opens in 1944 Slovakia, where the inhabitants of a war-torn town
flee on foot as air raid sirens signal an impending wave of German
bombers.  As throngs of people head for safety, one little girl runs in
the opposite direction, toward a religious icon in the center of town.
An injured soldier watches as the girl prays for God to show mercy on
her family, friends and neighbors.
Cut to the bad part of Chicago in the late 1970s, where Father Frank
Shore (Ed Harris, The Truman Show) has successfully hidden for the past
eight months when he walked out on both his job and his god.  Shore's
job is a unique one within the church  he investigates miracles,
decides if they're legitimate and, if convinced, petitions Rome for
canonization.
Shore is tracked down by Father John Leone (Michael Rispoli, Summer of
Sam), who drags him back to their boss, Bishop Cahill (Charles Haid,
Renko from Hill Street Blues).  Cahill sends Shore on an assignment to
St. Stanislaus, where a statue supposedly weeps the blood of a
parishioner that died almost a decade earlier.  While the statue only
oozes the red stuff during sweet November rain (insert Axl Rose joke
here), the blood is said to have cured the lupus in a young girl.
Shore, the hard-drinking skeptic, becomes embroiled in the case  and
also with the daughter of the possible saint (Anne Heche, Psycho) - and
we slowly learn why he's earned the nickname `The Miracle Killer.'  The
film also incorporates elements of cop flicks and courtroom dramas into
the mix, which distinctly separates Miracle from its predecessors
without really being too original.  Shore emerges as a strange
cop/priest hybrid that, at one point, tells a low-level pimp, `My name
is Frank Shore; I'm from St. Stan's.'  He delivers the line with a
clenched jaw and a growl, and may as well be saying, `I'm Detective
Corsetti from the 2-7.'  Miracle's denouement is kind of like A Few Good
Men except everyone is wearing robes and collars.
Miracle is based on Richard Vetere's novel of the same name that he
adapted with television producer John Romano (Third Watch, Party of
Five).  Washington Square director Agnieszka Holland capably helms the
film and is reunited with Square's cinematographer (Jerzy Zielinski),
editor (David J. Siegel) and composer (Jan A.P. Kaczmarek) for this
production that was filmed in Hamilton and Toronto, Ontario.  While the
film is a little predictable (I called it very early on), it certainly
looks great and is one of those films that could actually make you
question your religious beliefs.  And any movie that makes you think
can't be all that bad.
1:58 - R for adult language, mild violence, minor sexual content and
some drug use.
And for priests that take the Lord's name in vain in his own house

Title
Review for Saving Grace (2000)
Mention the `pot comedy' genre to somebody and, depending on their age,
images of either Dazed and Confused or Cheech and Chong's Up in Smoke
will probably pop into their heads.  There seems to be a new `pot
comedy' in theatres every couple of years, and each is just a recycled
story full of the same jokes that you've already seen over and over
again.
Saving Grace such a breath of fresh air in the `pot comedy' genre.  When
was the last time you had to go to an art house to see people toke up
and act goofy?  Never mind that  when was the last time you saw a
British film written by a peripheral player from an American sitcom, and
featuring both a recent modern rock chart-topper and a two-time
Oscar-nominee?
Like The Full Monty and Waking Ned Devine, Grace is a lightweight comedy
that doesn't overcomplicate its story or overstaying its welcome.  The
film is about a horticulturist named Grace Trevethan (Brenda Blethyn,
Little Voice) who becomes a widow as the film opens.  One month after
the funeral, she learns that her late husband's bad business investments
have rendered his estate penniless.  To make matters worse, he's also
mortgaged their giant Cornwall home, and unless Grace can come up with
Ł300,000, the bank will take all of her assets.
In debt up to her eyeballs, Grace decides to scrap her hobby of growing
orchids in her giant greenhouse and, together with her pothead Scottish
gardener Matthew (Craig Ferguson, The Drew Carey Show), decides to move
her green thumb to marijuana.  That's right - Grace and Matthew hatch a
plan to grow dope and sell it by the kilo, splitting the profits after
she pays off her creditors.
Grace, which won the Audience Award at this year's Sundance Film
Festival, has only a couple of scenes where people are wrecked on dope.
There isn't anything funny about watching people get wasted in movies.
It's barely fun in real life, unless you're participating in the
shenanigans.  That said, I still laughed my ass off when two Cornwall
merchants that accidentally brewed marijuana with their tea, even though
I'd already seen that scene in the film's trailer several times.  I
found Grace to be more effective in its simpler moments, like when Grace
and Matthew nervously wait for credit card approval at a gardening
store.
Grace could have easily been a television sitcom episode (I can just see
Jack Tripper trying to hide his weed from Mr. Roper), or possibly a very
special Blossom, but it manages to stretch its humble story into a
ninety-minute film without adding superfluous scenes or dialogue.  There
are several subplots, involving everything from deportation to
salmon-poaching, but none get in the way of Grace and Matthew's story.
Okay, I would have cut out the part where Grace meets her husband's
mistress.
Credit the screenwriters (Ferguson, The Big Tease and debut screenwriter
Mark Crowdey) for not bogging the story down with enough deadweight to
make a typical running time.  Ferguson, who plays the slightly insane
Mr. Wick on television, doesn't hog all the good lines for himself, but
I think his character did manage to say each `F' word contained in the
film.
1:34  R for adult language, brief nudity and, of course, drug use

Title
Review for U-571 (2000)
Das Boot is the Holy Grail of submarine movies.  It's so good that you
have to wonder why anyone would bother making a film about subs after
Boot was released in 1982.  You know, kind of like how Ben-Hur ruined
the whole `chariot race' genre for everyone else.  Granted, you'd be
better off spending your $20 for tickets and popcorn on the the
director's cut of Boot on DVD instead, but U-571 is still damn
entertaining.
Sure, it's as close to Boot as Mulholland Falls is to L.A. Confidential,
but U-571 is an edge-of-your-seat good time.  And who woulda thunk it,
coming from this bunch of `auteurs'?  Director Jonathan Mostow's only
previous mainstream directorial credit was 1997's reprehensible
Breakdown. Mostow penned the script with Breakdown cronie Sam Montgomery
and some other guy named David Ayer, a former Navy sonarman who had
never written a feature film.  The talent in front of the camera isn't
particularly awe-inspiring, either.  Matthew McConaughey?  Bill Paxton?
Not much brain activity there.  Harvey Keitel?  I only recently regained
my sight after seeing him in a dress and lipstick in Holy Smoke.  Jon
Bon Jovi?  Nuff said.
U-571's story isn't that fantastic, but it does offer the best cinematic
macguffin since `the Process' from David Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner.
The film is set in the Atlantic Ocean during the spring of 1942, where
German U-boats have their way with Allied ships while slowly approaching
the east coast of the United States.  The German's sea supremacy is
unmatched, partly due to the fact that the Allied Forces are unable to
decipher the transmissions that they intercept from their adversaries.
If the Allies could only get their hands on Germany's `Enigma' machine,
they could crack the code and possibly turn the tide of war to their
favor.
And that's just what U-571 is about.  The crew of a rickety, antiquated
Word War I submarine are ordered to disguise themselves as German
soldiers and take over a disabled sub stranded in the middle of the
Atlantic and capture the mysterious `Enigma' device.  The American sub,
skippered by Captain Dahlgren (Paxton, Mighty Joe Young), is even
doctored to look like a German U-boat, and a German-speaking officer
(Jake Weber, In Too Deep) and combat Marine (David Keith, A Family
Thing) are included in the mission.
Of course, the mission doesn't go exactly as planned, otherwise there
would be no movie.  The Americans end up aboard the German vessel, but
the ship is beyond repair.  To make matters worse, they can't read the
controls, they only have one torpedo remaining, and they insist on
keeping the German Captain (Thomas Kretschmann) aboard the ship as a
prisoner.  Gee, I wonder if he's going to break free at a really
dramatic moment in the film?
There are more predictable things in the film, mostly revolving around
McConaughey's (edTV) Lieutenant Andrew Tyler.  As the film opens, we
learn that he was passed over for promotion because Captain Dahlgren
says he doesn't possess the ability to sacrifice his own men if the
situation deems it necessary.  Gee, I wonder if Tyler will end up in
charge of the mission and have to sacrifice his own men?
Yet despite the predictability, lack of capable stars and weak script,
U-571 still succeeds.  The sound is remarkable, especially during scenes
where the sub is being pummeled by depth charges.  In fact, these scenes
are so well done that they jammed three of them into the film (the third
time was a little much).  The film, while not based on a true story, is
dedicated to the brave men that captured the `Enigma' machine, which was
apparently an actual device that truly did shift the balance of power in
the Atlantic over to the Allies.
2:00 - PG-13 for war violence and adult language

Title
Review for Men with Guns (1997/II)
Can indie film God John Sayles actually get more independent?  After the
critical and commercial success and a Best Original Screenplay Oscar
nomination for 1996's Lone Star, Sayles has made a slower, richer film
about Central American politics with no big stars, that is predominantly
voiced in Spanish, Nahuatl, Mayan and Kuna.  Is he trying to keep people
at home or what?
Sayles has cast Argentine acting great Federico Luppi (Cronos) to play
Fuentes, a well to do doctor in a fictitious country who spends him time
training future doctors to bring modern medicine to the surrounding
`inaccessible' jungle areas.  When Fuentes happens upon a promising
former student running stolen stereo equipment, the out of touch doctor
becomes afraid that his pet project might not be doing as well as he had
thought.
Fuentes decides to take a holiday from his private practice to see if
his other students have fallen from medical grace as well.  Armed with
only a freshly pressed dress shirt, snow-white hair and a shiny
four-wheel drive vehicle, he drives deeper and deeper into both the
tangled jungle and an intriguing mystery.  It seems that some of the
villages are either completely deserted or only inhabited by a few
people who refuse to speak to Fuentes.  The mass genocide has apparently
made them leery of any outsider.  Of course, the government blames
guerillas for wiping out the small villages, while the guerillas blame
rogue bands of government troops for doing the same.
The interaction between Fuentes and the cast of characters he meets on
his journey are fascinating. Rounding out a fine international ensemble
is Kathryn Grody (The Lemon Sisters) and Chicago Hope star Mandy
Patinkin, who play an annoying American tourist couple.  Their lines are
the only English spoken in the film.
The script has a similar slow-handed pace to Lone Star and was
magnificently shot by Slawomir Idziak (Gattaca).  Sayles, who also
edited the film, has again crafted a phenomenal story that shows his
diverse tastes.  A sample of his past work reveals films featuring black
aliens, baseball gambling, coal mining, crippled soap opera stars and
Irish folklore.  You can't get a better medley that that and Sayles has
shown that he is definitely at the top of his game with Hombres Armados
(Men With Guns).

Title
Review for Edtv (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Ron Howard's latest film has the misfortune of following the superior
Oscar-nominated The Truman Show.  The similarities are numerous, and
when the inevitable comparisons are made, EdTV comes up short.  Really
short.
The reason Truman was such a great movie was because Truman was
completely unaware that he was being filmed.  When we saw people tuning
into Truman's life on a regular basis, we thought `Cripes!  This is
really messed up.  This guy's whole life has been a big charade and
these horrible people are using him to entertain themselves.  Media
bad.  Society doomed.'  Andrew Niccol's script was clever, dark and
preyed on mankind's paranoid fear both of being secretly watched and of
being a pawn in an intricate scheme to have the wool pulled over its
collective eyes.
EdTV's script, by Billy Crystal's crap-factory writing team of Lowell
Ganz & Babaloo Mandel, doesn't have that edge.  It features a guy, Ed
Pekurny (Matthew McConaughey, A Time to Kill) that knows he's being
watched by millions of people.  He even had to audition for the part.
So, basically, it's like watching MTV's The Real World except that it
concentrates on one person.  And that it's duller and more predictable.
Like Truman, Ed's real father (Dennis Hopper, Speed) tries to reunite
with his now-famous son.  Like Truman, the shows producers try to veer
Ed away from the plain-Jane girl he really loves (Jenna Elfman, Dharma &
Greg) toward a gorgeous ratings-grabber (Elizabeth Hurley, My Favorite
Martian).  And like Truman, there's even a scene where Ed, arms
outstretched, looks up into the sky as rain beats down on him.  Jeez, I
think I'm going to go rent Truman right now.  (2:02  PG-13 for adult
language, adult situations and some sexual content)

Title
Review for Pokémon the First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
I'll be the first to admit that I know precious little about the whole
Pokémon phenomenon that has captured the attention of our nation's
littlest ADD sufferers.  I know the translation of Pokémon is `pocket
monsters,' which sounds like something you would hear in a seventh grade
boys locker room, or possibly as a feature at your local porno theater.
I know that the television show gave a bunch of Japanese kids seizures.
And I know that I was secretly thrilled when it debuted here, just
because I thought the seizures might lead to a `thinning of the herd.'
You know, a good way to test that whole survival-of-the-fittest thing.
Now that I've seen ninety-five minutes of Pokémon, I know a few more
things.  I know that they resemble a chew toy that you would buy for a
dog  if you really hated your dog.  I know that the most popular
Pokémon is Pikachu, a yellow thing that looks a bit like Ernie's rubber
ducky.  I know that Pokémon are kept in Pokéballs until they are
instructed by their masters to come out and fight another master's
Pokémon.  And I know that once, in a billiard hall, I experienced
something very similar to Pokéballs, when I walked into a horizontal
pool cue.
The theatrical version of Pokémon begins with a twenty-minute short
called Pikachu's Vacation.  In the short we meet several of the chew
toys as they take a trip to what appears to be a Pokémon theme park.
Pikachu is responsible for a baby Egg Pokémon while he holidays with his
friends the Turtle Pokémon and the Duck Pokémon.  At the end, prepare to
be amazed when the Lonely Pokémon, who ordinarily only cares for itself,
helps to rescue the trapped Dragon Pokémon.  The short is mostly
composed of these horrible bumpers that are supposed to serve as
transitions between the scenes.  There's nowhere to go but up once the
feature starts.
In the feature, which is called Mewtwo Strikes Back, scientists have
replicated a Pokémon named Mew, which was apparently the Babe Ruth of
Pokémon.  The clone, called Mewtwo, is upset that it is an experiment
and goes Carrie on its creators.  Mew also hates all Pokémon masters
because it sees the relationship between them and the Pokémon as more
owner/slave, thinking that the humans and the chew toys should not and
could not be friends.
Mewtwo falsely leads the world's best Pokémon masters to a Pokemon
convention at Pokemon Center, inviting the protagonist, a young Pokémon
master named Ash.  He's the kid who owns Pikachu and his little chew toy
friends.  There is a big battle and everything works out.  Then I went
home.

Title
Review for Finding Forrester (2000)
Almost three years to the day after the release of Good Will Hunting,
Finding Forrester hits theatres with a similar but equally effective
story.  The connection extends beyond just a comparable script, since
both films were directed by Gus Van Sant.  Even more remarkable is the
source of the two scripts  the first was an out-of-left-field Oscar
winner penned by two struggling actors (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck),
while the second comes via a Portland radio personality.  And I won't
even get started on the surprise cameo in Forrester's epilogue.
Replacing Damon's Will Hunting is 16-year-old Jamal Wallace (Robert
Brown, in his acting debut), a promising basketball player and C-student
at Bronx's Coolidge High School.  Like Will, Jamal is whip-smart, but
hides his talent because he doesn't want to stand out.  He reads all the
heavy-hitters that usually scare off kids his age and even writes
religiously in a journal, which has recently grown into its fifth
volume.
One night, Jamal is dared by his friends to break into the apartment of
a ghost-like local legend known as The Window (a name garnered from
wielding a pair of binoculars from his third-story window).  Jamal gets
in to the mystery man's home, but he's spooked and accidentally leaves
his backpack (with journals) behind.
The next day, The Window (Sean Connery, Entrapment) unceremoniously
drops Jamal's backpack to the street, where the surprised student
discovers his journals have been covered in red pen corrections,
culminating with one question on the last page  `Where are you taking
me?'  Curious, Jamal goes to The Window's apartment, where the two
slowly develop a rapport revolving around writing.
What Jamal doesn't know is that hard-drinking man is really William
Forrester, the reclusive author of `Avalon Landing,' a Pulitzer
Prize-winning work heralded as The Great American Novel of the 20th
Century. Forrester disappeared after achieving incredible fame through
his first novel and has spent the last few decades holed up in his Bronx
apartment avoiding everyone and everything (a la J.D. Salinger and his
`The Catcher in the Rye').
When Jamal transfers to Manhattan prep school Mailor/Callow, he is
greeted with open arms because of his basketball abilities.  Nobody in
the school thinks he could possibly be interested in an education and,
as a result, Jamal grows a major chip on his shoulder because everybody
assumes he's some dumb black kid.  Meanwhile, Forrester is similarly
pissed at the world for assuming they know what his novel was really
about.  The two stories are nicely paralleled, without being too
obvious.
The antagonist in Forrester is a stuffy prick English professor (played
by F. Murray Abraham) who doesn't believe Jamal is capable of the
writing assignments he's been turning in.  The film comes together over
a writing contest at Mailor/Callow, which, although entirely
predictable, had me a bit choked up.
Van Sant, who followed up his Oscar-nominated Hunting with an
ill-advised, Razzie-winning, shot-for-shot remake of Hitchcock's Psycho,
does a fantastic job here with deejay Mike Rich's script.  Forrester
opens with a series of lovely shots of the Bronx and remains remarkably
well-paced throughout.  Even the basketball action is done nicely, and
better than we've recently seen in Love and Basketball and He Got Game,
which is pretty surprising, considering Van Sant is, essentially, an
indie film director.
Actingwise, Connery can do no wrong, no matter how lowly the project
(see Entrapment for further proof), but newcomer Brown steals the show
as the jaded teen whose life is altered by a chance encounter.  Anna
Paquin (Almost Famous) does a good job in her supporting role as Jamal's
classmate, and, thankfully, the film isn't slowed down by an unneeded
relationship between the two.  Technically, Forrester is a slick little
package, wonderfully photographed by The Yards' Harris Savides and
edited by Valdis Oskarsdóttir, the veteran of three Dogme films.
2:10 PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual references

Title
Review for Never Been Kissed (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
The tagline says that `Some things are worth waiting for.'  This sure
ain't one of them.  Drew Barrymore (Ever After) stars as Josie Gellar,
the youngest copy editor in the storied history of the Chicago
Sun-Times.  (Do you think that makes Roger Ebert hate the film more or
less?)  She's meticulously uptight and loves the sentimentality of your
typical Hallmark card.  In other words, a mousy brown-haired virgin.
Although she longs to one day be an undercover reporter, her superior
Gus (John C. Reilly, Boogie Nights) pays no attention to Josie.  That
is, until the day the Times' nut-job editor-in-chief (Garry Marshall),
who is tired of getting scooped, assigns a surprised but exuberant Josie
to work undercover at South Glen South, a local high school.  Now, mind
you, there isn't any particular story he wants unmasked.  She's just
supposed to stumble onto something earth-shattering that will boost
paper sales.
Now, if I had a nickel for every time I heard some schlub say, `If I
could go back to high school now, knowing what I know, my whole life
would be different  tee-hee-hee.'  Sure it would.  The closest these
people come to doing something about their personal schooling horrors is
to relive it vicariously through Johnny Depp on 21 Jump Street.  It's
sort of like saying `Jeez, if I knew that eating a box of Twinkies every
day would make my ass-shadow eclipse Cleveland, I never would have
started  tee-hee-hee.'
Josie is just like these out-of-touch wonders.  Even though she was a
zitty geek (nickname: `Josie Grossie'), she looks forward to getting
another stab at being popular.  The newspaper rigs her with a hidden
camera, with all images being transmitted back to Gus, who apparently
has nothing better to do all day than watch his reporter's exploits,
hereafter dubbed `The All-Humiliation Network' due to Josie's uncanny
knack of not being able to fit in.  In fact, she's forced to befriend
the lowest of the low (according to the 1999 edition of The High School
Food Chain)  the math club and their leader (a brilliant Leelee
Sobieski, A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries).
Things take an odd but expected twist when Josie's brother Rob (David
Arquette, Ravenous) also enrolls at South Glen South.  Why?  Because he
apparently blew his shot at a big baseball scholarship when he came down
with mono before the most important game in his high school career.  His
instant popularity jettisons the homely Josie into the ranks of the
school's social elite and even nets her the welcome advances of the
skinny-cool-sensitive guy who plays guitar.  When I was in high school,
guys like this got beat up.  Now, I guess they're popular.
Throw in the predictable romance with her English teacher (Michael
Vartan, The Curve, who weaves in references to the whole `All the
world's a stage' thing from Shakespeare's As You Like It), as well as
the big prom finale (which is actually a competition with rival high
school East Glen East, natch) and you know you're just minutes away from
a gem of a line like `I've waited my whole life to fit inand now, I
finally do!'  Sit down and shut up.  You're not really fitting in.  It's
a sham of a mockery of a travesty of a sham.  And I think she wore the
same dress to the prom that she wore in Ever After.  Talk about your
fashion faux pas!  It's a good thing Joan Rivers wasn't covering that
event.
Barrymore is actually becoming quite the deft physical comedienne,
unafraid to make herself look unsightly for effect.  But her performance
isn't enough to overcome even one of the other problems with Never Been
Kissed, which was directed by John Hughes understudy Raja Gosnell (Home
Alone 3)  who apparently didn't study enough.  But if you go, make sure
you stay for the closing credits because they show school pictures of
the whole cast and crew.  (1:47  PG-13 for mild language, sex talk and
implied drug use)

Review for Goat on Fire and Smiling Fish (1999)
 It's an ultra low-budget film about male siblings so, of course,
everyone is comparing Goat on Fire and Smiling Fish to The Brothers
McMullen.  And from some people's reaction to McMullen, that may not
really be such a good thing.
I liked McMullen, and Goat on Fire is pretty similar, both in terms of
story and unpolished look.  I saw the film as part of the Toronto
International Film Festival's Film Discovery Program (for best first
film), where it took home the top prize.  That's not really saying much
- I was there and the competition was as fierce as a de-clawed kitten.
>From what I remember hearing in Toronto, Goat on Fire was kind of
hurriedly transferred to 35mm for festival submission and, as a result,
the sound was a mess.  Hopefully this can and will be cleaned up for the
film's theatrical release.
Now onto the title, which you have to worry will scare off many a
potential viewer.  `Goat on Fire' and `Smiling Fish' are the nicknames
given to the film's two main characters by their Native American
grandmother (those of you that saw Smoke Signals, don't panic - Goat on
Fire isn't an `American Indian road movie').  Chris Remi (Derick
Martini) was dubbed `Goat on Fire' because he was a very serious,
uptight baby.  His brother Tony (Steven Martini, Derick's real-life
brother) earned the name `Smiling Fish' on account of his carefree,
fun-loving attitude as a kid.
But that was years ago.  As adults, Chris and Tony live together in a
modest L.A. home that they inherited from their parents, who died some
years ago in a car crash.  Chris, a tax accountant, is caught in a
horrendous relationship.  At least they tell me that it's a bad sign
when your girlfriend cries during sex.  Meanwhile, Tony is still an
untroubled, happy-go-lucky guy, living his life like he's still in high
school and struggling to find acting work.  Like when they were
children, Chris and Tony remain opposites as adults.
However, as the film progresses, Chris and Tony find their lives
abruptly altered by the introduction of new women into their lives.
Chris falls for an Italian animal wrangler named Anna (Rosemarie Addeo),
while Tony becomes involved with his mail carrier, an older single mom
(Christa Miller, The Drew Carey Show) with a nine-year-old daughter. And
- you guessed it - Chris learns how to become more easygoing, while Tony
is forced to learn how to settle down.
Goat on Fire was directed by Kevin Jordan, who co-wrote the script with
Derick Martini.  The original story was conceived by both Martini
brothers, with Derick producing and Steven providing the film's (often
annoying) narration.  It was shot in twelve days on a Blair Witch-sized
budget and, like McMullen, was filmed on location in the Martinis'
actual home.
Jordan's talent as a director is the standout star of Goat on Fire. Both
Martini brothers come off pretty likeable as actors, and Miller shows
that she can play more than `Kate' on Drew Carey.
Although it has nothing to do with my like or dislike of the film, I
have to point out that there were several `plants' in the audience
during the press/industry screening in Toronto.  Yeah, the film was
funny at times, but there were at least two people (strategically
located within the theatre) that laughed maniacally like DeNiro in Cape
Fear during the entire film.  The plants were often funnier that what
was happening on the screen.

Review for 1732 Hřtten - marerittet har et postnummer (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Some of the creepiest psychological studies of the last few years have
come from Scandinavia.  Bloody Angels tries to duplicate the eeriness of
its Norwegian predecessors, Insomnia and Junk Mail.  Though those shoes
may be tough to fill, Angels is still a bitter disappointment.
Angels takes place in a tiny rural town where, several months prior to
the film's opening, a young girl with Down's syndrome was brutally raped
and murdered (shades of Paradise Lost?).  The townsfolk believe that the
killers are the two oldest sons of the most despised family in the bleak
burg and, as the film opens, one of the alleged attackers is found dead
in an icy river.  His accomplice brother is missing, but nobody in the
town will own up to the obvious retaliation.
Enter an Oslo detective named Nicholas Ramm (Reidar Sřrensen), an old
friend of the stymied local sheriff.  Ramm gives new meaning to the term
`no-nonsense cop,' instantly butting heads with the locals, who insist
that they saw `bloody angels' descend from heaven and do the deed.
Hoping to unravel the mystery, Ramm befriends the tormented younger
brother of the suspects (Gaute Skjegstad), which makes everybody in town
hate him even more.  Is it really heavenly intervention, or mob
justice?  Duh  what do you think?
The directorial debut of Karin Julsrud, Angels isn't totally wasted.
The music is downright hair-raising and the cinematography is great,
creating a drab, washed-out look.  The weak story (Finn Gjerdrum and
Kjetil Indregard) by is the real problem here, and the ending should be
particularly predictable to anyone that has seen a Pearl Jam video.

Review for Man on the Moon (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Milos Forman's long-awaited biopic on the life of the late Andy Kaufman
begins hysterically.  A black-and-white clip of Andy tells the audience
that the movie isn't really that funny.  In fact, Andy explains, since
they edited out all of the unfunny moments, the movie is actually over.
The credits start to roll and the screen fades to black for several
seconds, while viewers shift around in their seats, unsure if the
projector blew a bulb.  Then Andy pokes his head into the frame, stating
that the whole intro was a ploy to make people that didn't get his humor
to leave the theater.
This opening bit perfectly captures Andy's career.  His performances
seemed geared more to pleasing himself than his audience, with his
career (and possibly his life) a huge inside joke that nobody was a part
of except Andy.  After this brilliant start, Man on the Moon lays out
Andy's life, from his childhood in Great Neck, Long Island, where he
performed to an invisible audience contained within his bedroom wall, to
his death from a rare form of lung cancer.  The title of the film is
taken from R.E.M.'s homage to the ultra-talented performer (they also
provide the score to the picture).
The first half of Man focuses on Andy's (Jim Carrey, The Truman Show)
rise to stardom.  He never thought of himself as a comedian, but more of
a `song-and-dance' man.  Actually, performance art is probably a more
accurate description.  Andy's legendary stage performances, which
usually involved shocking his audience into various states of
discomfort, landed the entertainer on the ABC sitcom Taxi, despite his
reluctance to be tied down creatively.  He only accepted after quickly
conjuring up a list of crazy demands, one of which guaranteed that his
alter ego, Tony Clifton (also played by Carrey), would appear in four
episodes of the popular television show.  The brash, offensive Clifton
was, in my opinion, the greatest comedy bit since `Who's on first?'
Moon's second half concentrates on the established comedian's fall from
grace.  As far as his audience was concerned, Andy began to take things
a little too far.  His involvement in wrestling, which is probably the
greatest entertainment hoax of the decade, seemed to turn off what few
people still enjoyed the performer.  The film also shows Andy as an
obsessive-compulsive that practiced holistic medicine (this probably
sounds familiar to Howard Stern fans).
His illness and death are probably the most ironic story to come out of
Hollywood.  When Andy announced that he had cancer, nobody believed it,
thinking it was just another one of his practical jokes.  When he died,
people though that was a stunt, too.  Later, when a television special
honoring his career was broadcast, people actually expected him to show
up and pull off the greatest showbiz prank ever.  I know  I was one of
them.  Even when the special is re-aired, I still watch, hoping that
Andy will pop out and yell `Surprise!'
Carrey's performance is electrifying, capturing not only Andy's physical
appearance but his spirit as well.  There are times you will forget that
you aren't watching clips of the real Andy.  He nails the mannerisms
(especially the eyes), the voices and even Andy's nuts-on impression of
Elvis.  Paul Giamatti (The Negotiator) is terrific as Bob Zmuda, Andy's
friend and cohort, and executive producer Danny DeVito (Living Out Loud)
capably plays George Shapiro, the talent agent that `discovered' Andy.
It's strange that DeVito, who played opposite the real Andy on Taxi, was
the only cast member that didn't portray him or herself in the film.
Well, except Tony Danza, but who will really miss him?  The film also
features cameos by David Letterman, Jerry Lawler, Lorne Michaels and the
real Bob Zmuda, who I always figured was just spelling his last name
backwards.
There seems to be huge chunks missing from the film, especially
revolving around Courtney Love's role as Andy's girlfriend Lynne, which
isn't really too much of a surprise.  Her Lynne seems relegated to looks
of astonishment during crowd shots at Andy's appearances.  The rock star
doesn't appear until sixty minutes into the film, and even then she's
kind of abruptly crammed in without much explanation.  I have a feeling
that many of her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor (which is
where most of her last album should be laying).  Forman's (The People
vs. Larry Flynt) films are usually much longer than 120 minutes.
Also lacking was Andy's rise to fame, which was brushed over in
minutes.  The film gave the impression that Andy went from struggling at
an improv club, to SNL, to Taxi in the same week.  And his childhood,
which I was the most curious about seeing, was condensed into about
ninety seconds.  As a side note, Bobby Boriello plays the young Andy -
he's the same kid that played Howard Stern in Private Parts and now has
the unique distinction of portraying two of the funniest people in the
last half of this century.  What does this poor kid do with his career
now?
Moon does spend a great deal of time on the downfall of Andy's career,
skipping from his banishment from SNL, to the cancellation of Taxi, to
being kicked out of his transcendental meditation group.  This brings up
an interesting point  who is going to pay to see this movie?  Most
people disliked Kaufmann, so count them out.  Die-hard fans may go, but
they'll be disappointed that the film consists mostly of bits that you
can watch three times a week on Comedy Central.  Other than Andy's
wonderful bits and Carrey's performance, there isn't really much else to
this film.  But those two factors are almost all it needs.

Review for Love & Basketball (2000)
Financed by Spike Lee's Forty Acres and a Mule production company, Love
& Basketball is too much like Spike's recent flicks - excessively long,
agonizingly self-indulgent and full of nails-across-a-blackboard music
from Terence Blanchard (Summer of Sam).  And that's really a shame 
there's a nice little film in there somewhere, if you pare away about
thirty-five minutes.
Basketball is divided into four uneven segments labeled `First Quarter,'
`Second Quarter,' etc.  The first takes place in 1981, where the world
of eleven-year-old Crenshaw kid Quincy McCall (Glenndon Chatman) is
rocked to its alpha-male foundation by the fact that he may no longer be
the best basketball player on his street.  Q's new neighbor  like him,
a wannabe point guard  has silky-smooth moves, a killer jump shot and,
more importantly, is actually a tomboy named Monica Wright (Kyla Pratt).
 Hey  haven't we already seen a girl move to a new town and dress like
a boy this year?
Flash to 1988, where both Q (Omar Epps, In Too Deep) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan, The Best Man) are star playmakers for their respective Crenshaw
High teams.  She loves Magic Johnson and wears his #32, while his idol
is his dad, who sports #22 for the L.A. Clippers.  They're still
neighbors (their bedroom windows are only about ten feet apart) and they
bicker like an old, married couple.  It's sweet to watch Q and Monica
pretend that they don't care a lick about each other when it's obvious
that they do.  A romance eventually blossoms after a spring dance.
Basketball's third (and longest) quarter sees Q effortlessly making the
move from high school to the starting line-up at USC, while Monica
struggles just to make her Lady Trojan team.  This is where Basketball
is at its best - contrasting Q's red carpet journey to instant college
fame and adulation with Monica's sweaty workouts featuring teammates
that hate her and a coach that rides her ass raw every day.  According
to Dick Vitale (who makes a cameo performance along with fellow ESPNer
Robin Roberts), Q is a real P.T.P. Diaper Dandy (meaning  I think -
that he's a freshman with incredible potential).
The last chapter of the film is set in 1993, and what little faith I had
remaining for Basketball's denouement was ripped out from under me.
There is entirely too much time spent on the relationship between each
set of parents and their talented little ballplayers.  You know when Q's
moms (Debbi Morgan, The Hurricane) warns him about money-grubbing hoes
trying to `trap' him that she's probably done the same to his NBA star
pop (Dennis Haysbert, Random Hearts), while Monica's prissy parents
(Harry J. Lennix, Titus and Alfre Woodard, Mumford) just don't
understand how important basketball is to their daughter.
Basketball was written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, who made
two unseen Dave Chappelle comedic shorts called Damn Whitey and Bowl of
Pork, the latter of which a black take on Forrest Gump (`Life is like a
bowl of pork'  get it?).  Until now, Prince-Bythewood was probably best
known for being the daughter of accomplished television director Stan
Lathan.  She even adds a clip of Pop's latest sitcom The Steve Harvey
Show.  Prince-Bythewood's script is heartwarming at times, but as a
whole is unfocused and uneven.  If there was more of the relationship
between Q and Monica (like the priceless look of shock when he unfurls
his package before they git wit' each other for the first time), the
film would have been a lot more enjoyable.  There are a couple of pretty
cool shots through Monica's eyes while she's on the court in the middle
of a game.
There are other mildly endearing qualities to Basketball, like the use
of different music from each period of the film.  First you hear Bobby
Brown singing `Candy Girl' with New Edition, and then `My Prerogative'
on his own seven years later.  It's funny, but not nearly as funny as
hearing people use the word `fresh' repeatedly.  There are other minor
problems with the film as well.  Like why would these people live in
Crenshaw?  Isn't that supposed to be a bad area?  Wouldn't an NBA star
live somewhere else?  Their houses are huge and one even has a giant
in-ground pool.  Maybe I'm just ignorant (I already have plenty of
e-mail supporting this point, so save your typing fingers), but Crenshaw
is always portrayed as a gang war zone in films set in south central Los
Angeles.
In addition to not having opening credits (a growing trend in mainstream
film), there is another interesting event that happens early in the
film.  Woodard's character coughs in her first scene, which is usually
the first sign of a character developing lung cancer in the last reel.
But that doesn't happen here, which almost makes me think that this
story was originally intended to drag out even longer than it already
did, and the whole cancer angle (thankfully) ended up on the cutting
room floor.  Or, then again, maybe Woodard just coughed and the director
didn't feel like reshooting the scene.

Title
Review for Topsy-Turvy (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Mike Leigh (Career Girls) has left an unmistakable stamp on the 90s,
writing and directing four films that broke the conventional feature
film mold and, in turn, netted the Brit accolades from peers, critics,
festivals, and even two Academy Award nominations (for Secrets & Lies).
What makes Leigh's work so invigorating is the fact that he rarely
follows a proper script, letting his actors improvise dialogue from a
basic outline of the film's story.
Which is why Topsy-Turvy, Leigh's fifth and latest film of the decade,
is such a surprise.  His biopic of Gilbert and Sullivan runs nearly
three hours, most of which is spent on well-choreographed numbers from
their plays.  Well-choreographed numbers?  Mike Leigh?  What gives?
While the film is still flawlessly executed, it's so much of a departure
from Leigh's previous films that Turvy is almost disappointing.  Simply
put, if you're a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan, you will love this film.
If you don't particularly care for their garish musicals, you may admire
Turvy's acting and grandeur, but don't expect much else.
Focusing on the fourteen months leading up to the premiere of `The
Mikado,' Turvy introduces its main characters in a rather unique way.
The two don't share a scene together until about forty minutes into the
picture, which leaves plenty of time to establish them as completely
separate artists, rather than two hit-makers connected at the hip.
Turvy begins in 1884 with the debut of `Princess Ida' at the legendary
Savoy Theatre.  The play was a critical and commercial flop, which sent
both Gilbert and Sullivan reeling in different directions career-wise.
William Schwenk Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) is haunted by a newspaper review
that referred to the playwright as `the King of Topsy-Turvy-dom.'
Meanwhile, Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner, The Impostors) is shown as a
physically ailing composer at a bit of a career crossroads.  He hates
the repetitious music that he has been composing for Gilbert's equally
repetitious themes of magic that propel each of their plays.  Sullivan
wants to write an opera, while Gilbert wants to plod along using more of
the same supernatural subjects.
Courtesy of a well-timed museum exhibit of Japanese culture, Gilbert
gets the idea that eventually becomes `The Mikado,' the production that
jumpstarted the duo's creative juices.  They went on to do The
Gondoliers and The Yeoman of the Guard and blah blah blah.  There isn't
much in the way of surprises, but there rarely ever is in a biopic.  The
only revelation here is that G & S's actors were used to wearing corsets
in each play, but couldn't in `The Mikado' because the Japanese attire
wouldn't hang right on their frames.
To Leigh's credit, he can elicit amazing performances from his actors,
and Turvy is certainly no exception.  Broadbent is fantastic, in a
stick-up-your-ass sort of way (a big surprise if you remember his sleazy
nightclub owner in last year's Little Voice).  Corduner is great in an
altogether different way, looking a bit like a smirking Inspector
Clouseau.  It seems like he's in on some private joke (maybe he saw what
the running time was).  Also worth noting is the performance of portly
Leigh regular Timothy Spall, who plays one of the Savoy regulars, as
well as the technical work, which is fantastic from the costumes to the
art and production design.
Since I am not a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan (I just found out that
they're responsible for the songs that Sideshow Bob sang on the Cape
Fear episode of The Simpsons), I found Turvy to contain too many
song-and-dance numbers.  There is an Oscar-quality film somewhere in
there, but unfortunately, it's buried amidst the musical numbers.  But,
like I said, G & S enthusiasts will probably wish there were even more.

Review for Still Crazy (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
When Still Crazy was nominated for two Golden Globe awards (Best Picture
[Comedy] and Best Original Song [Comedy]) in January, most people had
never heard of it.  At best, they knew that it was about a popular 70s
British glam-rock combo named Strange Fruit, and that the film showed
them trying to hit the road after being disbanded for several years in
an attempt to ride the current wave of retro popularity.  Early viewers
described the film as This is Spinal Tap meets The Full Monty.
In its heyday, Strange Fruit had its share of problems.  Original
frontman Keith Lovell died and was replaced by the less charismatic Ray
Simms (Golden Satellite nominee Bill Nighy, FairyTale: A True Story),
who always had trouble living in Keith's shadow.  Keith's brother,
guitarist Brian, was institutionalized years ago and is presumed to be
dead as the film opens.  The remaining band members have been out of the
music game for years, but are itching to regroup once keyboard player
Tony Costello (Stephen Rea, The Butcher Boy) suggests they give it a go.
The hilarious Billy Connolly (Mrs. Brown) is underused as a veteran
roadie (he's also the narrative voice of the film), but of more interest
is the casting of actor-turned-director Bruce Robinson as Brian.
Robinson hasn't acted since the late 70s, but did write the recent
debacle In Dreams, as well as the Oscar-winning The Killing Fields, and
directed Jennifer Eight.  Robinson looks eerily like a washed-up rock
star.  Also worth a mention is the performance of Jimmy Nail (Evita) as
the Strange Fruit bassist.  Actually, his performance isn't noteworthy
at all, but he does look like a cross between Anthony LaPaglia in So I
Married an Axe Murderer and MTV's Tom Green.
Directed by Brian Gibson (What's Love Got to do with It), Crazy is
honestly not much like the `mock'-documentary-style Tap.  The only part
that was even remotely like Monty was when the band auditions a young
`hired gun' to play guitar for their tour, in place of Brian.  Actually,
it's probably more akin to The Commitments, which Crazy writers Dick
Clement and Ian La Frenais also penned.  Unfortunately, Crazy isn't
nearly as entertaining.  (1:40 - R for language, sexuality and drug

Review for Sidewalks of New York (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
You can't blame writer/director/producer/star Edward Burns for not looking
back at his last feature film, the commercial and critical flop No Looking
Back.  After becoming the darling of American independent cinema with 1995's
The Brothers McMullen and following it up with the underappreciated She's
the One the following year, Burns grounded out in 1998 with Back, a gloomy,
critically maligned film about a love triangle that didn't even begin to
recoup its $5 million budget at the box office (it grossed under $200k).
Since then, the quadruple threat has landed significant acting roles in two
major motion pictures - Saving Private Ryan and 15 Minutes - but with
Sidewalks of New York, Burns should feel like he's kickin' it all the way
back to the mid '90s.
Sidewalks is set in - big surprise - New York City and focuses on the lives
of six characters who stagger through their lives searching for love (mostly
in all the wrong places, too).  The film begins with faux man-on-the-street
interviews with each of the six describing their first sexual experiences
before launching into the story proper.  Burns does two things that make the
film interesting:  He uses a handheld camera to shoot most of Sidewalks, and
he has each character hail from a different borough of the city (only one is
an outsider).  Hey - let's meet them right now, shall we?
- Tommy (Burns) is a reporter for an Entertainment Tonight-type show (a bit
of an inside joke, as Burns worked for ET until he slipped Robert Redford a
tape of McMullen) and has just been kicked out of his Queens apartment by
his girlfriend.  Tommy temporarily stays with his boss (Dennis Farina,
Snatch), who is quick to provide over-the-top advice about how to score with
chicks.  Then, one day, Tommy meets...
- Maria (Rosario Dawson, Josie and the Pussycats), a native of Staten Island
who teaches the 6th grade in a ritzy area of Manhattan where her salary is
dwarfed by the allowances of her students.  Maria is recently divorced and,
though she's attracted to Tommy, is leery of getting involved because she
just can't seem to get rid of...
- Benjamin (David Krumholtz, The Mexican) a struggling musician from
Brooklyn who pays the bills by working as a doorman.  He's still in love
with the beautiful Maria and doesn't see anything wrong with dropping by her
apartment in the middle of the night.  Benjamin thinks he still has a shot
with his ex, but, in the meantime, becomes infatuated with...
- Ashley (Brittany Murphy, Girl Interrupted), a guitar-playing NYU student
from Iowa (and the only character who hasn't lived in the Big Apple their
entire life).  She's having an affair with an older, married man who swears
he's going to leave his wife to be with her.  Should she try to find
somebody her own age to frolic with, or simply be content with...
- Griffin (Stanley Tucci, Joe Gould's Secret), a once-divorced Bronx dentist
who has remarried a sweet, young honey yet insists on stepping out with
Ashley on a regular basis despite his fear of the stigma that twice-divorced
men can carry.  Griffin is the only unlikable character in the film, which
makes you wonder how he landed...
- Annie (Heather Graham, Say It Isn't So), a WASP-y real estate agent from
the Upper East Side of Manhattan who foolishly believes she has the perfect
marriage.  The story comes full circle when Annie shows an apartment to the
recently homeless Tommy.
If any of this sounds familiar, it must be because you've seen Woody Allen's
Husbands and Wives, which had a similar (yet much more downbeat) story about
doomed relationships, faux interviews with the main characters, shaky,
handheld camera work, and a comparable setting.  I'm usually against the
idea of lifting ideas from other films, but if you're going to do it, why
not swipe 'em from something as wonderful as Wives?  Copying Rocky to make
Driven...now that I've got a problem with.
Sidewalks is much dirtier than Wives, with gags about dick size and various
private-part odors.  It also helps to perpetuate several myths that
outsiders to New York City have come to accept as reality - Jews are really
cheap and black people don't exist.  But Burns fleshes out his characters
with enough quirky sexual hang-ups and various fears (like loneliness and
disease) to keep things more than interesting.  Nothing really exciting or
surprising happens, but it doesn't need to.  And that's the sign of a good
film.

Title
Review for Blow (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
It might seem like a potential Oscar contender, especially when compared to
the rest of the slop released so far this year, but Blow just doesn't
measure up to the similarly themed Traffic, or the sweeping scope of Boogie
Nights, which also featured a male character's evolution from a naďve boy
into a cynical adult.  Instead of presenting a fictional Dirk Diggler, Blow
is the true story of George Jung, who became Columbian drug lord Pablo
Escobar's main U.S. cocaine distributor.
Blow's slick opening credits show the journey cocaine takes from the fields
of Columbia into Johnny Depp's nose.  Depp (Chocolat) plays George and
narrates the film as his character, who tells us the story of his life from
a federal penitentiary.  We begin with George's childhood outside Boston,
where his mother (Rachel Griffiths, Blow Dry) constantly runs away from home
and his dad (Ray Liotta, Heartbreakers) has some pretty serious money
problems, which we're led to believe is the motivation for George's career
choices.
When he's old enough, George moves to Cali with buddy Tuna (Ethan Suplee,
Remember the Titans) and starts selling pot he scores from SoCal's
burgeoning supplier Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens, Mystery Men).  Learning he's
a remarkably gifted salesman with an equally remarkable product, George
branches his operation out to the East Coast and frequently deals with
hundreds of pounds of herb he obtains from Mexican farmers.
After a bust and brief imprisonment, George promotes himself from weed to
cocaine, with the help of former Colombian cellmate Diego (Jordi Mollŕ).  He
works his way into Escobar's (Cliff Curtis, Bringing Out the Dead) Medellin
cartel, where he controls about 85% of the United States coke import
business.  George also meets, falls in love with and marries a hot tamale
named Mirtha (Penélope Cruz, All the Pretty Horses).  And then, predictably,
the wheels start to fall off.
The main problem with Blow is that the story just isn't that exciting.  It's
the tale of a guy I've never heard of and knew nothing about, yet it was
easy to see what was going to happen long before it did.  The ending is a
little too sappy (are we supposed to feel sorry for this guy?), and the
whole thing plays like a weak version of GoodFellas, but with a focus on
drugs instead of the Mafia.  It's director Ted Demme's (Life) best work to
date, but parts of the film feel like he's showing off, throwing every
cinematic technique at the screen and emerging a bit like a Guy
Ritchie-style showoff.
But there are plenty of positive things about Blow, too.  It's got all the
great music and silly clothes you'd expect from a period film like this
(Depp's hair gets more and more ridiculous as the film progresses - at one
point, he streaks through an airport looking like the twin brother of Urge
Overkill's Nash Kato).  Depp, Griffiths and Liotta do well with grating
Boston accents, and the makeup department does a great job at aging those
three characters (although they could have just used Skeet Ulrich to play a
young Depp).  This is Depp's best non-Tim Burton performance since Donnie
Brasco, and Blow also marks the American film debut of Franka Potente (Lola
from Run Lola Run), who plays George's girlfriend early in the film.
Blow was based on Bruce Porter's book and adapted for the screen by David
McKenna (Get Carter) and Nick Cassavetes (Unhook the Stars).  It's nicely
photographed by Ellen Kuras (Summer of Sam) and features some nifty editing
by Kevin Tent (Election).

Review for Three Kings (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Writer/director David O. Russell's follow-up to his indie hit Flirting
With Disaster is a shockingly well-done action flick, centering on four
Army soldiers that try to heist gold originally stolen by Saddam Hussein
from Kuwait prior to the Gulf War.  The film is a politically incorrect
blood-bath, which works to cover the giant plot holes that would ruin an
ordinary film.
It's March 1991 and the Gulf War has just ended.  As Iraqi troops
surrender to the mighty American forces, Sergeant Troy Barlow (Mark
Wahlberg, The Big Hit) finds a map jammed up the ass of one POW.
According to Special Forces Sergeant Major Archie Gates (George Clooney,
Out of Sight), it is a secret Iraqi Ass Map that reveals the location of
untold Kuwaiti riches seized by Iraq, including several million dollars
in gold bouillon. Gates is two weeks away from retirement and looks at
the potential score as reward for a career in the military, as well as a
good way to avoid his latest detail  a media escort to NBS reporter and
5-time Emmy runner-up Adrianna Cruz (Nora Dunn, Saturday Night Live).
Back in Detroit, Barlow is an office schlub and the father of a newborn
baby, so he quickly agrees to accompany Gates (who is not his superior
officer) on the heist, which should only take a few hours out of their
boring post-war afternoon.  His company mates, Chief Elgin (Ice Cube,
The Player's Club) and Vig (Spike Jonze) round out the group, the latter
two practicing skeet-shooting with Nerf footballs on the way.  They see
a cow blow up from a cluster bomb and they discuss the proper term for
people native to the area (`Dune Coon' vs. `Sand Nigger' vs. `Camel
Jockey').  And when they find the Iraqi village that is believed to
contain the bunker full of gold, they are surprised to find that
Saddam's soldiers are more concerned in quelling citizen uprising than
they are with the four marauding American servicemen.
In the bunker, the men find stack after stack of stashed wares  from
coffee makers to microwaves to food processors  and the deeper they go,
the better stuff they find, culminating in dozens of suitcases full of
heavy gold bars.  They're able to drag it out of the bunker, but because
this happens only thirty minutes into the film, circumstances
temporarily veer the four off of their original plans of thievery.  The
soldiers are confronted with the horrors of war as Iraqi citizens,
inspired to retaliate against Saddam's troops by President Bush, are
being massacred.  They see oil fires, tortured of prisoners of war, the
murder of innocent children and oil-soaked birds  all of which make the
gold bouillon seem unimportant.  Well, maybe less important.  They're
still Americans.
Co-written by John Ridley (U-Turn), Three Kings is a devastatingly dark
war film.  There is a scene where the filmmakers use a real cadaver to
demonstrate the effects of a bullet ripping through your innards.  There
is a shootout that may even be cooler than Keanu dodging bullets in slow
motion in The Matrix.  The direction and editing are absolutely
top-notch, using a variety of styles from montage to repetition from
different angles.  The slick cinematography (Tom Sigel, Fallen, The
Usual Suspects) will bring back memories of Star Wars as the troops walk
across the vast desert (not to mention those Tusken Raider-looking
things).
Want to know who survives?  Take a look at the title, Three Kings, which
implies that there are three main characters.  But there are really four
(Clooney, Wahlberg, Cube and Jonze).  Now take a look at the three names
above the title.  Sorry, Spike  the name of the film predicts your
demise before the first frame is shown.  May as well have changed the
name to Three Kings and Spike Jonze Gets Killed.
There are a few other problems, namely the likelihood that they would
have been able to get that much gold out of the continent without anyone
noticing.  The plausibility of three soldiers agreeing to follow a man
they don't report to is also kind of questionable.  The roles are sort
of pigeonholed  the retiring guy (Clooney), the young kid (Wahlberg),
the black guy (Cube) and the hillbilly (Jonze).  And don't get me
started on the part where Clooney's Gates actually becomes ER's Dr.
Ross, sticking a very Pulp Fiction-like needle into the chest of comrade
that has just had his lung deflated by enemy bullets in order to relieve
his chest pressure (using the cadaver to show air filling the chest
cavity and slowly crushing the other lung).  But these issues are pretty
minor in the grand scheme of this fantastic new film.  (1:53  R for

Review for Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, The (2000)
I love The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show as much as anybody else. I even named
my cats Boris and Natasha. But the idea of a full-length film featuring
the flying squirrel and the 400-pound Wossamotta U. graduate brought
chills to my spine. Not good chills, either. See, the whole appeal of
Jay Ward's cartoon series, which ran from late 1959 through 1964, was
that there was just enough Rocky and Bullwinkle to keep you interested.
The half-hour show always started with a brief clip of the duo getting
in some type of cliffhanger-type trouble and ended with them foiling
Boris and Natasha's dastardly plans. In between these two parts were
Fractured Fairy Tales, Peabody's Improbable History and a bunch of other
solid animated entertainment. Rocky and Bullwinkle were just a small
part of the show. So how could it possibly work as an hour-and-a-half
film without the support of Peabody, Dudley Do-Right and Snidely
Whiplash (that's my other cat's name)?
The answer is a short one - it doesn't. The dry humor and silly puns get
really tiring after about twenty minutes, but thankfully R&B features
enough inspired casting and self-mockery to make the film somewhat less
torturous than it could have been. R&B opens with an animated Rocket J.
Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose, who have been living off of puny
residual checks from the show's reruns, which have been airing since the
1964 cancellation. It seems that in the last thirty-six years, poor
Rocky has lost the ability to fly.
Flash from Frostbite Falls to Pottsylvania, the home of Boris Badenov
and Natasha Fatale. Through some bizarre blend of science and nonsense,
the two baddies and their fearless leader (named Fearless Leader) submit
a movie script to a beleaguered movie mogul (named Minnie Mogul and
played by Janeane Garofalo, Mystery Men) and are somehow transformed
from cartoon into reality. Jason Alexander (Seinfeld) plays Boris, Rene
Russo (The Thomas Crown Affair) tackles Natasha, and Fearless actor
Robert De Niro becomes Fearless Leader.
The three hatch a plan as diabolical as ever  taking over every cable
television station with something called RBTV (or `Really Bad
Television'). The broadcast signal of RBTV will hypnotize the entire
country into voting for Mr. Leader in the upcoming Presidential
election, thus ousting current Commander-in-Chief, President Signoff
(James Rebhorn, Snow Falling on Cedars), from office.
Luckily, the FBI is on the case, assigning bumbling, knock-kneed Agent
Karen Sympathy (newcomer Piper Perabo from the upcoming Coyote Ugly) to
entice Rocky and Bullwinkle out of retirement to stop the
mass-hypnotism. The squirrel and moose remain animated, despite the fact
that the three bad guys are now real. Isn't this a big plot hole? Well,
yes, but the whole film doesn't make sense. It knows it doesn't make
sense, and it doesn't care. And that's damn admirable, especially after
something like Gone in 60 Seconds, which was just as illogical but
pushed itself as a serious action film.
Eighty-year-old June Foray still provides Rocky's voice, while Aussie
Keith Scott (who narrated Ward's overrated George of the Jungle film)
handles voices for both Bullwinkle and the film's narration. There's
also a load of cameos, from Carl Reiner, Jonathan Winters and Don
Novello, to Randy Quaid, Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg and Good
Burger's Kel Mitchell and Kenan Thompson. John Goodman, who will play
Perabo's father in Ugly, also has a small role in the film. There isn't
a lot of acting going on here, as most of the talent spends the entire
film reacting to characters that weren't there during filming.
R&B was directed by Des McAnuff, who helmed the abysmal Cousin Bette,
but also was a producer on The Iron Giant. The screenplay was written by
Ken Lonergan (Analyze This) and features a dazzling score by Devo's Mark
Mothersbaugh (Rugrats). Lonergan's script is peppered with a decent
amount of pop culture references (like spoofing DeNiro's famous
monologue from Taxi Driver), and several miss-em-if-you-blink homages
to the original show (like the Wossamotta U. infirmary being called the
`J' Ward).

Title
Review for Election (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Matthew Broderick's character in the new Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth)
comedy could be an adult version of Ferris Bueller.  Sure, we don't want
to think about the carefree Ferris turning into Election's popular high
school teacher Jim McAllister, but you almost can't help it.
McAllister is a mélange of every educator you've ever had  dingy
short-sleeved oxford shirt, bad tie, brown shoes, tiny Ford Festiva, and
a genuine love of teaching.  Despite winning George Washington Carver
High's `Teacher of the Year' a record three times in his twelve-year
tenure, McAllister still has one major Achilles heel that ultimately
leads to his unraveling  a peppy junior named Tracy Flick.
Flick (Reese Witherspoon, Cruel Intentions) is running unopposed for the
student body President, and her vivacity and eagerness are just the
qualities that would have made her an easy target for people like
Ferris.  She in the top seven percent of her class, dresses like she's
still trapped in Pleasantville, walks like she has a bulky object
crammed up her backside, and perfectly pronounces every word that leaves
her tightly pursed lips.  And don't get me started on her hair, which,
at one point, resembles demonic horns.
Things take an odd turn at Carver when McAllister convinces well-liked
school quarterback Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against the
seemingly unstoppable Flick juggernaut.  When the dust settles, viewers
will have been treated to tastes of pornography, marital infidelity,
lesbianism, sex with minors, election tampering, and a very disturbing
scene where McAllister cleanses his genitals in the bathtub of a cheap
hotel.  Not your typical MTV Production, eh?
Payne's direction (he also co-wrote the script, based on the Tom
Perrotta novel) is reminiscent of both Wes Anderson's superior Rushmore
and either of Betty Thomas' biopics, The Late Show and Private Parts.
Repeatedly using montage clips, Payne also bathes his actors in a sea of
horrible fluorescent lighting, exposing every physical flaw.
Although the acting is first-rate, Witherspoon's Flick really stands
out.  Her unknowingly fiendish role will likely be remembered among the
more evil roles in film history, along with Oddjob, Keyser Soze, Robert
Patrick in Terminator 2 and that Russian guy from the fourth Rocky
film.  Or was it the third?  Well, you get my point.  (1:43  R for

Title
Review for Simpatico (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Matthew Warchus' directorial debut, which he adapted from a Sam Shepard
play, is a disappointing tale of corruption, blackmail, cover-ups, greed
and paranoia.  Simpatico also features a predictable Freaky Friday swap
of the two male sides of the film's boring love-triangle.  It's a
surprise to see a film like this get a limited December release because
it has absolutely no chance of walking off with nominations of any sort.
Simpatico is set just before Halloween and opens with a man taping up a
shoebox with curious vigor.  We learn that he is Vinnie (Nick Nolte,
Affliction), a crumpled mess of a drunk that has just been pinched for
allegedly harassing a woman.  Vinnie makes a collect call to his wealthy
friend Carter (Jeff Bridges, Arlington Road), grunting `They're gonna
make me talk!' into the phone.  We have no idea what this means, but
Carter quickly hops a plane from his beautiful home in Kentucky to head
for Vinnie's place in Cucamunga, California.  Carter's juice-head wife
Rosie (Sharon Stone, The Muse) stays behind, in a perpetual fog.
Carter's interest in protecting Vinnie is related directly to the
mysterious contents of the shoebox.  We learn that there is something
bad inside  most likely photos and letters  pertaining to the fixing
of a horse race from several years ago that left the three players
somewhat well off.  The history of Vinnie and Carter's relationship is
played out in a series of cool flashbacks that just reek of Lone Star,
with their younger roles played by Shawn Hatosy (Outside Providence),
Liam Waite and Kimberly Williams (relativity).  Paranoid that their
secret could potentially affect the $30 million sale of his Triple
Crown-winning horse Simpatico, Carter is tricked by a dodgy Vinnie, who
steals his pal's car, clothes and wallet and flies back to Kentucky,
leaving Carter to become a grubby, disheveled Oscar Madison to Vinnie's
Felix Unger.
I was expecting the shoebox to contain some really messed-up stuff and
was very unsatisfied once the contents were revealed.  The acting is
solid, especially from Albert Finney (Washington Square), who plays a
former horse-racing official with a dirty past.  Stone is perfectly
cast; her role most likely resembling her real life  drunk and hazy,
sleeping all day and having sex to get ahead (or, in last year's case,
to get a Golden Globe nomination).  Nolte and Bridges are, as usual,
reliable actors.  Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich) contributes a
supporting role as the object of Vinnie's affection.
The picture looks fantastic, thanks to John Toll's (Braveheart, The Thin
Red Line) gloomy cinematography, and ex-Police drummer Stewart Copeland
provides a decent score.  But Simpatico never really gets off the
ground.  It's tough to feel anything for the characters and, with the
big surprise letdown, the ending is left terribly flat.  Warchus does
make effective use of the Alan Parsons Project song `Games People Play'
at the beginning and end of the film, but it's hardly enough to save the
picture.

Title
Review for Angela's Ashes (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Attempting to adapt Frank McCourt's beloved bestseller Angela's Ashes is
a heck of an undertaking.  I'm not sure that many filmmakers would be
able to pull it off at all, let alone be able to present a decent
finished version to the teeming masses that devoured McCourt's
autobiography.  But Alan Parker and his crew show that they were more
than up to the challenge, and their bleak and haunting film will
certainly satisfy the appetite of Angela's rabid readers.
Like the book, Ashes starts with the impoverished McCourt family living
in a dank, muddy, rain-soaked tenement in New York City.  Unable to make
ends meet in the new world, the family high-tails it back to Limerick,
Ireland, leaving young five-year-old Frank and his family in the rare
position of waving `goodbye' to the Statue of Liberty.  Unfortunately,
Limerick was the only place in the world danker, muddier and rainier
than New York's slums.  In fact, the film depicts the housing in New
York and Limerick almost identically  old, decaying stone structures
threatening to crush the feeble hopes and dreams of anyone that dare
enter.
Frank's parents almost seem like caricatures, with mum Angela (Emily
Watson, Cradle Will Rock) barely able to muster enough energy to keep
spreading her legs and popping out kids, and dad Malachy (Robert
Carlyle, The World is Not Enough), an on-the-dole drunkard that can
neither hold down a job nor win the favor of his in-laws that despise
the fact he's a Protestant from Northern Ireland.  Frank starts out as
the oldest of four boys, but the McCourts gain and lose kids at such an
amazing pace, it's hard to keep track of the exact number at any given
point in the film.  It probably wasn't until the Kennedys burst on to
the scene that a more tragic family existed.
While you've probably seen dirt poor 30s families portrayed in film
before, Ashes kicks it up a couple of notches.  The McCourts are so poor
that they don't have a pot to piss in; they use a bucket.  Their first
floor is constantly underwater, and their neighbor's sewage ran down the
drainpipe outside their ramshackle abode.  Each family member is so
caked in filth and has so much dirt under their fingernails that you'll
want to go home and scrub your fingers raw while sitting in a steaming
hot tub as soon as you get home.
The story follows Frank's life from age five to sixteen, when he
returned to the United States.  In between, he suffered from hunger,
typhoid and conjunctivitis.  Frank is played by three different young
actors (Joseph Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge) and each does a
fine job looking destitute and downcast.  Watson and Carlyle contribute
to the film's acting pedigree, but the majority of Ashes' magic occurs
behind the camera.
Although Parker hasn't made a film since Evita, he shows that he is
still one of the most talented directors today.  Parker's script, which
he co-wrote with Oscar and Lucinda's Laura Jones, does a good job
incorporating the major points of  McCourt's novel into the film without
keeping it from getting too out of hand.  Cinematographer Michael
Seresin, who worked on Parker's earlier (and considerably darker) films
like Birdy and Angel Heart, and six-time Oscar nominee and longtime
Parker editor Gerry Hambling both do an amazing job at creating a very
realistic Depression era.  If the poignant images don't get to you, John
William's score swells in enough of the right places to all but
guarantee a lump in your throat.

Review for Castle, The (1997/I)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
`You can't buy what I've got,' proclaims glowingly proud Aussie Darryl
Kerrigan.
And why shouldn't he be happy?  Darryl (Michael Caton) has a tiny home
with several below-code additions that's located next to both power
lines and the airport.  His wife (Anne Tenney) is a wonderful cook and
home decorator.  His oldest son Wayne (Wayne Hope) is currently
incarcerated for a botched gas station stick-up.  His only daughter
(Sophie Lee) has married a kickboxing Greek (Eric Bana).  His
budding-entrepreneur son Steve (Anthony Simcoe) spends his time
inventing odd items and searching the classified sections for bargains.
And his youngest boy Dale (Stephen Curry, who is also the film's
narrative) makes his contributions to the family by randomly digging
holes in the yard.
Darryl's dream life is abruptly halted when he receives a letter stating
that the expanding airport is buying his land out from underneath him.
An angered Darryl tries to fight City Hall, but fails miserably.  If it
sounds like a TV show, it almost is.  The Castle was written by four
seasoned sitcom scribes and directed by Rob Sitch, also an old hand at
television sitcoms.  They knocked out the script in two weeks and shot
the film in eleven days with one camera.  But the film is as fresh and
funny as any lengthy American production.  (1:22  R for adult language)

Title
Review for Romeo Must Die (2000)
The idea is almost too good to be true:  Shakespeare's timeless romance
set in modern time and packed full of guns, kung fu and interracial
dating.  Here, burgeoning action star Jet Li and songbird Aaliyah play
the two crazy kids that fall for each other even though their respective
fathers are the heads of two feuding gangs in Oakland.  But they don't
really fall for each other.  And nobody is actually named `Romeo.'  So
you're on your own trying to figure out where the title came from.
Aaliyah, making an astonishingly respectable film debut, plays Trish,
the daughter of the diabolical Isaak O'Day (Delroy Lindo, The Cider
House Rules).  She hates her father, distancing herself from his
criminal way of life, even though his dirty money probably paid for the
boutique that she runs.  After the son of another Oakland gangleader is
killed, Trish is ordered to have round-the-clock protection (in the form
of the chubby Anthony Anderson, Liberty Heights) in fear of retaliation.
Li (Black Mask) plays Han, the son of O'Day's deadly rival, Chu (Henry
O, Brokedown Palace).  As the film opens, Han is locked up in a dingy
Hong Kong prison, but quickly escapes after receiving word that his
brother has been knocked off.  He blazes into Oakland intent on finding
and killing the person responsible and, in the process, meets Trish as
he is stealing a cab and she is trying to ditch her porky protector.
The two team up to get to the bottom of the whole war, which revolves
around a slimy white guy (Edoardo Ballerini, The Last Days of Disco)
trying to bring an NFL expansion team to the city's four miles of
waterfront property that Isaak and Chu are fighting over.  Each ganglord
comes complete with a opulent mansion and a Machiavellian right-hand man
(Isaiah Washington, True Crime; and Russell Wong, The Prophecy II,
respectively).
But there isn't any real romance between Trish and Han.  They merely run
around trying to piece the puzzle together, and the result is more
Encyclopedia Brown & Nancy Drew than Romeo & Julietif Brown was a
martial arts master and Drew was a red-hot R&B siren.  There's a
missed-it-if-you-blinked balcony scene, but with only the threat of
romance, Romeo plays more like a rerun of Remington Steele or
Moonlighting.  Only with karate  which isn't really such a bad thing.
Li's fight scenes are amazing and there honestly shouldn't be anybody
going to see this film for any other reason.  DMX fans might be geared
up for it, but the rapper is only in two brief scenes (he was in Belly
longer, so rent that instead).  There are three really nifty moments
when Li is beating the crap out of his rivals, who are depicted
x-ray-style so you can actually see their bones breaking - kind of like
the whole bullet-through-the-gut scenes in Three Kings, but not nearly
as cool.  Romeo is the directorial debut of Andrzej Bartkowiak, who
previously worked with Li as the cinematographer on Lethal Weapon 4.
Romeo might be Li's big breakout role in this hemisphere, but it
probably should be remembered for its horrible racist edge.  Can someone
explain to me how a black guy can call an Asian guy `Dim Sum' and `Rice
Noodle' throughout an entire film?  Imagine a white actor calling a
black actor `Porch Monkey' and `Spear Chucker' in a movie (and then
imagine Spike Lee going into cardiac arrest).  And who greenlighted the
Chinese gong sound after Chu's mandate about the importance of timing
their strike against Isaak?  The official description from the studio
says that the film is about a war between Asian and African-American
gangs, but Romeo never uses either of those PC monikers, opting instead
for `black' and, at best, `Chinese.'  And if you pay attention too
closely to the convoluted script, you'll walk away thinking that the
message of the film is that blacks solve their problems with guns, while
the Chinese use their hands and feet.

Review for Ready to Rumble (2000)
 It's about time Hollywood made a picture about a flabby, mutton-chopped
bumpkin whose legions of brain-dead fans call him `the King.'  No, I'm
not talking about Elvis, but rather Jimmy King, beloved World
Championship Wrestling title-holder and owner of the longest winning
streak in the history of the sport.  He's also the `People's Champion'
(how'd I miss that election?) and the hero of Ready To Rumble's two
protagonists, who watch in horror as their idol is shafted out of his
title as the film opens.
Gordie Boggs (David Arquette, Scream 3) and Sean Dawkins (Scott Caan,
Black & White) star as septic truck workers in Lusk, Wyoming.  In
between sucking `ass juice' (their term) out of port-a-potties and
residential septic systems, Gordie and Sean eat, sleep and breathe
wrestling, a sport they insist is real.  They each wear WWKD (What Would
King Do?) bracelets and live for the high point of their week -
television's WCW Monday Nitro Live.
The dunderheaded duo drive their crap-wagon to Cheyenne to watch King
(Oliver Platt, Bicentennial Man) battle Diamond Dallas Page.  Little do
they (or King) know that behind the scenes, WCW boss Titus Sinclair (Joe
Pantoliano, Black & White) has arranged for King to be mercilessly
beaten and permanently kicked out of his league.  After DDP thrashes
King, the teary-eyed trailer-trash crash their turd-truck and, believing
that the accident is somehow related to King's defeat, begin a quest to
track down their portly hero to convince him to demand a rematch with
DDP.
Gordie and Sean find King and get the rematch  a triple-steel-cage
match in Vegas.  They also find him a trainer in a former wrestler
played by the oddly cast Martin Landau (EdTV).  Things proceed as
expected right through the end with the big wrestling finale - not so
much of a revenge match between the current and former champs, but also
a more subtle battle between King and Sinclair over who was responsible
for popularizing the sport.
Rumble is lewd and crude from the get-go, with its opening scene
featuring Gordie sticking a finger up his own pooper to con a Slurpee
out of a convenience store employee played by the perpetually annoying
Ahmet Zappa (webRiot).  The film, directed by Brian Robbins (Varsity
Blues) and written by three-time Mighty Ducks scribe/star Steven Brill,
is jam-packed with a bunch of modern rock tracks that were, like, so
totally five minutes ago.  Arquette does a good job of screaming and
acting like a retard, but is it really acting?
I guess I can understand the appeal of what is essentially an hour-long,
action-oriented sitcom, but in my mind wrestling's extravagant costumes,
snug-fitting leotards and carefully applied make-up practically screams
`Stand back, Laverne  I'm coming out of the closet!'  I have a feeling
that wrestling fans probably look down on the sissies that watch figure
skating, even though they too feature the same dopey get-ups.  I'm not
sure which was scarier - the wide-eyed mouth-breathers around me that
whispered `Sting' when the popular wrestler appeared on the screen, or
the fact that Rumble was so bad that I couldn't even enjoy Zappa being
violently thrown through a glass door at the end of the film.
In addition to portraying wrestling as `real,' Rumble also does a
horrible job of casting Platt in the role of a wrestling champion.  He
looks like he struggles to get out of bed in the morning, so how are we
supposed to believe he can beat these gargantuan steroid junkies?  The
film is a colossal waste of time but, if you insist on going, make sure
you stick around for the outtakes during the closing credits.

Title
Review for Two Family House (2000)
This Audience Award winner from the 2000 Sundance Film Festival is a
touching story of an everyday Joe trying to live out the American Dream
in the 1950s.  Two Family House is funny and, at times, heart-breaking
in its painfully accurate portrayal of one man's ambitious dreams nearly
crushing the life out of him.
The house in the film's title refers to 19 West Street in Staten
Island.  It's a ratty, dilapidated domicile with an upstairs rental unit
in a well-kept Irish section of Staten Island, but the house's condition
doesn't scare off machine operator Buddy Visalo (Michael Rispoli, Jackie
Aprile from The Sopranos).  Buddy looks past the rotting floorboards and
broken windows to see what the shack could be  a popular neighborhood
bar.
Like any Ralph Kramden-style dreamer from the 50s, Buddy's plans have
more than a couple of major obstacles to overcome.  The first and most
obvious is the filthy drunk Irish tenant (Kevin Conway ) and his young,
pregnant wife (Kelly MacDonald, My Life So Far) who live upstairs.  The
occupants won't pay rent and refuse to leave and, thanks to a bizarre
loophole in an obscure local law, they don't have to.
And like Kramden, Buddy also has a loudmouth wife who takes great pride
in rubbing her husband's nose in all of his failures, which admittedly
are numerous and quite hysterical.  Buddy has always resented Estelle
(Kathrine Narducci, The Sopranos) for forcing him to abandon his big
chance at a singing career several years earlier.  Now he just grits his
teeth when his better half announces that Buddy is `pregnant with
failure.'
Working double-shifts at the factory, Buddy sinks all of his money and
time into the bar, and his wife's incessant nagging leads him into the
arms of Mary, the pregnant girl upstairs.  Mary's life makes Buddy seem
like Nelson Rockefeller.  She's flat broke and her husband takes off
when she gives birth to a very non-Irish looking son.  Like in any film,
Buddy and Mary can't stand each other at first, but the two grow closer
and closer as House progresses.
Buddy reminded me of Kevin James from King of Queens  another
goodhearted, loveable oaf from one of New York's boroughs.  The
character is the embodiment of the American Dream, whether you're
talking about the 50s or present day.  I mean, who doesn't want to
start their own business and trade their wife in for a hot little Irish
number?  Of course, back then, it was a much bigger deal, and that's
part of House's reflective charm.
House was written and directed by Raymond DeFelitta (Shadow of a Doubt),
who gives the film the nostalgic feel of an American fable.  Plus he hit
the Sopranos casting trifecta with Rispoli, Narducci and Vinnie `Big
Pussy' Pastore.  DeFelitta also chooses a unique character to provide
House's narration, which supply the film's ending with a pretty stirring
scene.

Review for Fast Food, Fast Women (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Writer/director Amos Kollek and actress Anna Levine have teamed up to make
two pretty downbeat films (Sue and Fiona) that have each won awards at the
Cannes Film Festival.  Their latest project, Fast Food, Fast Women, is
decidedly more upbeat and plays like a romantic Big Apple fairytale.  It's
sweet, quite often funny, and is even a bit reminiscent of a Woody Allen
comedy, although Women's characters exist a few rungs further down the
social ladder than the usual denizens of Woody's New York.
Women begins with a scene that features a woman lying down in the crosswalk
of a busy intersection.  She's almost run over, and explains to the baffled
driver, "I'm just trying to put some excitement in my Sunday."  The woman is
Bella (Levine, Water Drops on Burning Rocks), a rail-thin waitress who has
abandoned a lucrative career on Wall Street to wait tables at a Manhattan
diner.  With a biological clock ticking as loud as an air horn, she's
obsessed with her upcoming birthday (the big 3-5) and worried that the
12-year affair she's been having with a married man (Austin Pendleton, Oz)
might not ever lead her down the aisle.
Bella's mother (Judith Roberts) is intent on fixing her daughter up with
more suitable men, and her latest blind date offering is Bruno (Jamie
Harris, son of Richard), a struggling novelist who pays the bills by driving
a cab.  They hit it off, but in an attempt to not frighten him off, Bella
lies and tells Bruno that she doesn't like kids.  This is unfortunate, as
Bruno's ex-wife has just run off to Tibet with her yoga instructor and
dumped their two kids on his doorstep.
In the meantime, a group of retired men who frequent Bella's diner discuss
their own love lives (or complete lack thereof).  Paul (Robert Modica) is
pretty depressed and tries his luck with the personal ads, where he finds
Emily (Louise Lasser, Requiem For a Dream), a horny widow who starts talking
about marriage after just one date.  Seymour (Victor Argo, The Yards), on
the other hand, shoots for the opposite side of the age spectrum and begins
to stalk an overeducated peep show dancer (Valerie Geffner).  Throw in a
stuttering Polish hooker (Angelica Torn, daughter of Rip Torn and Geraldine
Page), and you've got yourself an eclectic tale of lonely eccentrics.
The stories cross in unusual and unexpected ways, a credit to Kollek's
writing style.  His direction is unassuming, leaving his actors to do their
thing, which they do quite well here.  There are a bunch of good one-liners
and some pretty funny visuals, like two women talking about gravity's effect
on breasts as they squeeze melons at the supermarket.  Women, which was one
of the few American films selected to compete at Cannes, should appeal to
most viewers, but especially to those entrenched in their mid 30s.

Review for Hamlet (2000/I)
It's tough to write a review for a film like Hamlet.  You can't touch
the story, so critics are basically left to drone on about the acting
and the adaptation, if it is done in some unusual manner.  In the last
ten years, we've already had the run-of-the-mill Hamlet with Mel Gibson,
an unabridged Hamlet with Kenneth Branagh, and now we get Hamlet set in
present-day New York City.
This interesting version of Shakespeare's drama is probably more akin to
Baz Luhrmann's 1996 update of Romeo + Juliet than it is to either
Gibson's or Branagh's renderings.  Both were adapted and directed by
independent filmmakers (Michael Almereyda, Trance) and both placed its
characters in contemporary settings while keeping the Bard's language.
Like Romeo + Juliet, Hamlet uses a television news anchor as the story's
narrator, and we also see clever management of modern devices like
faxes, laptop computers, cell phones, airplanes and video cameras, all
of which seem to blend seamlessly into a story that's over four hundred
years old.
Here, Hamlet (Ethan Hawke, Snow Falling on Cedars) is dark, brooding and
perpetually filming everything with his digital video camera - so he's
pretty much Wes Bentley in American Beauty.  He returns home from school
for his father's funeral and wants to return immediately to his studies
rather than watch mother Gertrude (Diane Venora, The Insider) go at it
with her new husband, Hamlet's uncle Claudius (Kyle MacLachlan,
Timecode), who has just become the new CEO of Denmark Corporation.  But
when he's visited by his father's ghost (Sam Shepard, Snow Falling on
Cedars), Hamlet decides instead to stick around and go crazy, dragging
the comely photographer Ophelia (Julia Stiles, Down to You) into madness
with him.
The rest of Hamlet proceeds as you would expect, with large chunks
missing here and there (it would be four hours long otherwise).  The
play-within-the-play becomes a clever movie-within-the-movie, even
though it's still called `Mouse Trap.'  Rosencrantz (Steve Zahn, Happy,
Texas) and Guildenstern (Dechen Thurman, Uma's brother) are as bumbling
as ever.  And Almereyda evens manages to work in things like MovieFone
recordings and those annoying celebrity messages telling you to buckle
up while you're riding in New York City taxicabs.
While the acting is quite commendable  Hawke is especially surprising 
Hamlet suffers from some painfully slow parts.  But if you're familiar
with the story, you know things are going to get a lot more interesting.
The film looks terrific, and features work from American Psycho
production and set designers Gideon Ponte and Jeanne Develle, and
handsome photography by John de Borman (Hideous Kinky).

Review for Rugrats in Paris: The Movie (2000)
Some people complained about German-born Roland Emmerich being chosen to
direct The Patriot  the country's premiere film about our fight for
independence.  Spike Lee recently shot his big mouth off when he found
out an upcoming biopic about Muhammad Ali was going to be helmed by a
white guy instead of a black director.
A wise woman once asked `But what about the children?' (okay, it was
Reverend Lovejoy's wife on The Simpsons).  The U.S.'s latest kiddie
flick to hit theatres is set in Paris and directed by  a Belgian
(Paul Demeyer) and a Swede (Stig Bergqvist).  Terrific  we can't even
decide who our next leader is going to be, and in the meantime, our
children are being brainwashed with anti-American propaganda from two
European countries that have always seemed a little too peaceful, if you
know what I mean.
Luckily, Rugrats in Paris is a pretty decent film.  As an adult, I
enjoyed this sequel a lot more than the first Rugrats picture,
especially the hilarious send-up of The Godfather's opening scene.
Instead of Connie Corleone's pending nuptials, this film begins with a
wedding between Grandpa Lou and his new bride Lulu (voiced by Debbie
Reynolds, although Talia Shire would have been a perfect fit).  The
festivities are highlighted by a mother-son dance, in which the
perpetually scared, two-toothed redhead named Chuckie wishes aloud that
his mother was still around to dance with him (apparently, she's been
dead for some time).
In the meantime, Tommy's father Stu is called to France, where his giant
mechanical Reptar has malfunctioned, potentially delaying the opening of
a stage performance (a la `Miss Saigon') in Euro-Reptar Land, a Japanese
theme park in Paris.  For some reason, Stu decides to bring not only his
whole family, but all of his friends and their families, too.  A mildly
amusing montage of the packing, passport application process and air
flight ensues.
When the gang hits Paris (where wee-wee becomes oui-oui), we're
introduced to Coco (Susan Sarandon), the director of the Reptar stage
extravaganza who is under the impression that she needs to find a family
in order to receive a promotion within the Japanese conglomerate that
owns the theme park.  Coco latches onto Chuckie's father, Chas, who
seems like a better match for Coco's pretty Japanese assistant, Kira
(Melanie Griffith).
If this jumble of characters seemed confusing to you, you've probably
never seen the show.  While Paris may still be enjoyable if you haven't,
it probably helps if you've taken in at least a few episodes.  The kids
spurt out funny malapropisms, like `over my dad's potty,' instead of
`over my dead body,' just like the television series.  Paris also
includes some really slick animation, save the crudely drawn characters,
especially with shadows and reflections.
I was really enjoying the film until they started in with the `Who Let
the Dogs Out' song (not a great way to teach little kids to keep their
traps shut while they're in a movie theatre).  Also glaringly evident
was the fact that Paris had more fart/shit/piss gags than Adam Sandler's
new film (which was rated PG-13 to Paris' G).  While the film's story
would probably have been better suited for an hour-long television
special (with commercials) than an 80-minute film, Paris is still heads
and shoulders above most recent children's films.

Review for Emperor's New Groove, The (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2000 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Aside from Pixar's Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life, Disney's animation arm
hasn't produced anything to crow about in the last couple of years.
With The Emperor's New Groove, things may be turning around for the
studio.  Perhaps the improvement can be traced to the attempts of Fox,
DreamWorks and Warner Bros. to muscle in on the turf that has been
exclusively theirs for so long.  Maybe it's because Groove doesn't put
the film's animation technique ahead of its story, like it did with
Dinosaur and Tarzan.  Or, quite possibly, it's just a fluke.
What we do know is that Groove was originally called Kingdom of the Sun
and was created around a half-dozen songs penned and performed by
Sting.  The film had the typical Disney romantic subplot, the stock
antagonist, the obligatory wacky sidekick and enough talking animals to
shake a stick at. In other words, it was just like every other goddamn
animated feature the Mouse House has ever produced.  But here comes the
surprising part  Disney scrapped most of the story, the romantic angle
and almost all of Sting's songs.  The result is the first straight-out
Disney comedy to come along in a long, long time.
David Spade (Just Shoot Me) provides the voice of Emperor Kuzco, the
young ruler of a kingdom that extends as far as the eye can see.  To say
Kuzco is conceited would be an understatement, and this point is driven
home in the film's opening scene.  Kuzco dances around his castle (to
Sting's "Perfect World," sung by Tom Jones) but is interrupted by one of
his villagers.  In a scene straight out of Braveheart, Kuzco tosses the
man out the window for throwing off his "groove."  A few moments later,
Kuzco tells another villager (John Goodman, Normal, Ohio) he's being
evicted from a piece of property that has been in his family for
hundreds of years  just so the Emperor can build a summer retreat
called "Kuzco-topia."
Kuzco also has an advisor named Yzma (Eartha Kitt), who hatches a plan
to bump off her boss and take over his throne.  Together with her big,
dumb assistant, Kronk (Patrick Warburton, Putty from Seinfeld), Yzma
tries to poison Kuzco but succeeds only in turning the ruler into a
llama.  The newly cloven-hoofed Kuzco is put in a sack and dropped in
the river, where he meets up with Pacha, the villager he just evicted.
The two begin the long journey back to Kuzco's castle, meeting various
adversities along the way.
It would be one thing to have a Disney film devoid of songs, or missing
a time-consuming love story, but to have both in the same picture is
almost too good to be true.  Groove also features a funny cross-dressing
scene (a must for any decent comedy, I suppose) and nods to, among
others, Fantasia and The Fly.  But, best of all, it's smart, funny and
will be equally enjoyable for adults and children.
Groove is narrated by Spade's character, and the first half of the film
is told via flashback (including two occasions where his Kuzco
interrupts the story when it's not about him).  The technique wouldn't
have worked without Spade (the same way High Fidelity would have been
awful without John Cusack).  There was some concern that Spade's Kuzco
wouldn't have the same snarky bite we're used to from the pint-sized
comedian, but he's just as snide here as he has been anywhere else
(thanks to the script from Toy Story/Bug's Life writer David Reynolds).
Kitt's voice produces one of the most memorable Disney villains in quite
some time.  Her Yzma is a cross between Madame Medusa from The Rescuers
and the original (read: animated) Cruella De Vil.  Goodman's voice is
very subdued here, which is a welcome surprise if you've seen his new
television show.  His animated wife is voiced by yet another sitcom star
(Spade's Just Shoot Me co-star, Wendie Malick), showing that Disney
spared no expense for the film's voice talent, which is absent any
feature-film stars.
In case you didn't notice, Groove features the voices of two current and
one former player in NBC's powerful "Must See TV" Thursday night lineup
(Spade and Malick, and Seinfeld's Warburton).  What's stranger is that
these three are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Disney
raiding television's most popular evening for voice talent.  Remember ER
stars Julianna Margulies and Ming-Na Wen (Dinosaur and Mulan,
respectively)?  How about Warburton's fellow Seinfeld co-workers Jason
Alexander (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) and Wayne Knight (Tarzan and Toy
Story 2).  Even Hercules was voiced by Tate Donovan, who, at the time,
was playing Rachel's boyfriend on Friends.
Next up: Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jerry Seinfeld in The Beauty and the
Beast 2.

Review for Wo de fu qin mu qin (1999)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
You don't see too many gorgeous, heartwarming romances with a G-rating
slapped on them, but that's exactly what Zhang Yimou's The Road Home is.  No
spotted puppies or animated Rugrats here; just the story of love blossoming
in the hearts of two young people in a bleak mountain village in North
China.
Home is narrated by Luo Yusheng (Sun Honglei), who, as the film opens, has
just been called back to his hometown of Sanhetun because of the sudden
death of his father, who was the town's schoolteacher.  Yusheng explains
that he, like most of the village's other young men, have left the rustic
hamlet for work in larger cities, and this is the first time he has returned
in years.
When he arrives in Sanhetun, Yusheng is approached by the town's Mayor
(Chang Guifa), who delicately explains the unusual situation.  Yusheng's
father, Changyu, is still in the hospital, which is located miles and miles
away through the mountains.  His mother, Zhao Di (Yuelin Zhao), who has been
grieving in front of the schoolhouse since her husband's passing, insists
the town follow an ancient funeral custom in which the casket is carried, by
hand, into town by the village's men (presumably so he never forgets his way
home).
Yusheng unsuccessfully tries to get his mother to change her mind, and as
she begins to weave a traditional funeral cloth on her rickety loom, he
thinks about the stories he's heard throughout his life about the atypical
courtship at a time when arranged marriages were the standard.  Home then
flashes back to 1958 for the following hour, where we see the young,
beautiful Zhao Di (Zhang Ziyi, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) pursue
Sanhetun's handsome new schoolteacher, who, of course, is Changyu (Zheng
Hao).  The shift from present to past is done nicely, as the latter shows Di
at the loom preparing a special red banner than will adorn the village's new
school.
As Changyu and the locals build the school, Di carefully prepares delicious
dishes to take to the work site, with hopes her dreamboat will be the one to
devour her eats.  She even begins to use a long abandoned well just because
it brings her closer to the school and Changyu.  Initially, most of Di's
actions go unnoticed, but he eventually comes around when it's her turn to
host Changyu for dinner.  There's the potential for some tragedy and
heartbreak, but we already know they end up together, so the concern is
fairly minimal.
Yimou breaks the formula typically found in flashback films by having the
15-minute, present-day bookends shot in black and white, while the "meat" of
the film is in color.  This works nicely in the transition toward the end of
the film that shows the bright red banner in the brand-new schoolhouse
becoming a dingy gray banner in the decrepit schoolhouse.  It's also
interesting to see the complete lack of change between 1958 and present-day
Sanhetun (the only noticeable upgrades are the two Titanic posters on the
wall of Yusheng's old house).
Home won an Audience Award at this year's Sundance Film Festival, as well as
a Silver Bear at the recent Berlin fest.  Yimou keeps things moving at a
nice pace (the film barely cracks the 90-minute mark), even though there are
decently sized stretches with no dialogue.  The film is beautifully
photographed (by Yimou's Not One Less' Hou Yong) and gorgeously lit, which
you'd expect from a director who used to be a cinematographer.  Like Less,
Yimou uses a cast made up largely of non-actors (Ziyi actually filmed this
before Crouching Tiger).  The only major complaint is Home's constantly
swelling score, which becomes increasingly annoying throughout the picture.

Title
Review for X-Men (2000)
Back before I became a suave ladies' man, I was a big comic book fan. I
never read X-Men, but I was aware of the characters and the special
powers of most of the characters that appeared in the comic. The thing
that impressed me the most about X-Men was that they were basically
created out of laziness. Comic guru Stan Lee grew weary of coming up
with crazy ideas to serve as the origin for each of his superheroes. I
can just see him muttering to himself, ^ÓRadioactive spider bite ^Ĺ
exposure to gamma rays ^Ĺ okay, that^Ňs it. I^Ňm out of ideas.^Ô
So Lee came up with the notion of humans evolving and mutating into a
new race. Not only was it possible to give any character any special
power under the sun with virtually no explanation required, it also lent
itself to a fantastic subplot in which the mutants are forced to band
together as they find themselves outcast from society and generally
feared by the normals, a la witches, Jews, Blacks, Japanese, Communists,
and UK soccer fans.
While the comic has been going strong for over thirty years, its fans
have clamored for a feature film version of their mutant heroes. And,
boy, do they get it with Bryan Singer^Ňs (The Usual Suspects) terrific
adaptation that should both fulfill the expectations of geek-boys across
the world and provide great summer entertainment for people that don^Ňt
know mutants from mud-flaps. X-Men is easily the best traditional action
film I^Ňve seen this summer (as long as you don^Ňt count Gladiator as a
summer release).
studio logo to the opening scene showing a young mutant developing his
powers in 1944 Poland (it looks like a cross between Schindler^Ňs List
and Se7en) to the brilliant finale in, on and around the Statue of
Liberty The film^Ňs story, which practically leaves viewers begging for a
sequel, involves two groups of mutants.
One is led by Professor Charles Francis Xavier (Patrick Stewart, Star
Trek: Insurrection), who tries to teach young mutants how to control
their powers and function in modern society. The other ^Ö called the
Brotherhood of Evil ^Ö is commanded by Magneto (Ian McKellen, Apt Pupil),
a man hell-bent on destroying the world that wouldn^Ňt accept him as an
equal And how odd it is to see a big blockbuster summer action film that
stars two really old guys, not to mention the 180-degree turn for
McKellen, who played an ex-Nazi in Singer^Ňs Apt Pupil and a Polish Jew
here.
You might expect a film based on a comic book to begin with the series'
first issue, but that^Ňs not the case with X-Men. The film jumps into the
story midstream, so the viewer doesn't really get to learn the origins
of any of the existing mutants (other than the young Magneto). Instead,
^Ö Wolverine (hunky Aussie newcomer Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin,
She^Ňs All That). In Xavier^Ňs School for Gifted Children, you can also
catch glimpses of young versions of sequel-ready characters like Kitty
Pryde, Iceman, Jubilee, Pyro and Colossus. And if you look closely,
you^Ňll see Stan Lee make a cameo as a hot dog vendor in one scene.
The only complaints I have about the X-Men involve female characters.
The Storm character, played by Halle Berry (Bulworth), isn^Ňt as
prominently displayed as the others, and her character's transformation
makes the weakest jump from comic to screen, both in appearance and
development. Casting supermodel Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique may
have seemed like a good idea at the time, but what^Ňs the point of having
her in a film if you can^Ňt even tell it^Ňs her? Mystique, a
shape-shifter, is covered in scaly blue-green skin and, although the
character displays some nifty fighting moves, there^Ňs no way you can
tell when she^Ňs Romijn-Stamos and when she^Ňs a stuntwoman. Ray Park
(Darth Maul from Episode One) is a standout bad-guy in his portrayal of
Toad.
The rumors swirling around the casting of X-Men were unlike anything
I^Ňve ever heard before. The Wolverine character, which Jackson turns
into a huge star-making role, was originally supposed to be played by
M:I-2 baddie Dougray Scott, but he severely injured himself in a
motorcycle stunt in that film. Before Scott, half of Hollywood was
thought to be a cinch for the role of the steel-taloned Canadian,
including Russell Crowe, Elias Koteas and even (cough) John Leguizamo.
Actors that were ^Ólocks^Ô for other roles included Terence Stamp, Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Leonardo DiCaprio.
The rumor mill didn^Ňt stop when it came to X-Men^Ňs script, either. David
Hayter  (he was the voice of a garbage-eating possum in Doctor Dolittle)
received the only screenplay credit, while Singer and his Pupil
co-producer Tom DeSanto shared props for their ^Óstory.^Ô But the list of
other Hollywood scribes that supposedly had a hand in the film reads
like a who^Ňs who of the Writers Guild of America. They include Suspects'
Oscar winner Christopher McQuarrie, Gladiator^Ňs John Logan, Ang Lee^Ňs
right-hand-man James Schamus, Buffy the Vampire Slayer^Ňs Joss Whedon,
Men in Black^Ňs Ed Solomon and Se7en^Ňs Andrew Kevin Walker.
But too many cooks didn^Ňt ruin this film. The film is dark and cynical,
and the writers set up a great rivalry between Wolverine and Cyclops
(James Marsden, Disturbing Behavior), toss in some fantastic one-liners
and even include a poke at the yellow spandex that the superheroes wore
in the original comic. X-Men is also aided by top-notch work on the
technical end of things, from Michael Kamen^Ňs (Frequency, The Iron
Giant) score, to Newton Thomas Sigel^Ňs (Three Kings) cinematography, to
John Myhre^Ňs (Elizabeth) production design.

Review for Bring It On (2000)
I grew up in a family that didn't recognized Elvis Presley as the King
of Rock n' Roll.  A day or two after Elvis died, I remember asking my
dad who the new King would be, assuming it would be something like
naming a new Pope.  He snorted and said `It's still Dylan,' before
walking off and muttering something about Elvis stealing the black man's
music.  It's the kind of thing that sticks in a little kid's mind.
Bring It On invokes a similar theme of white people ripping off ideas
from black people.  Only instead of music, it's high school cheerleading
routines.  And the white devils almost got away with it, too.
Kirsten Dunst (Virgin Suicides) stars as Torrance Shipman, a senior at
Rancho Carne High.  As the film opens, Tor has a nightmare about
appearing before the entire student sans clothes.  It's no wonder  the
perky student has a lot on her plate.  Her boyfriend is leaving for
college, her mom keeps preaching the importance of concentrating on
schoolwork, and she just became captain of the school's five-time
national champion cheerleading squad.
The apparent victim of an ancient cheerleading curse, Tor's first day as
captain involves the serious injury of one of the squad's integral
members.  Her leadership is called into question by two bitchy
classmates who accuse Tor of acting like a `cheertator' simply because
she insists on holding tryouts for the opening on the prestigious team.
The audition uncovers a amazing find  a transfer student named Missy
(Eliza Dushku, Faith from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) who wants to join
the team because Rancho Carne doesn't have a gymnastics program.  More
importantly, Missy has a hot brother (Jesse Bradford, A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries).
Tor's curse continues at the squad's first practice with Missy, when the
transfer student drags her captain to watch a cheerleading troop in East
Compton.  Apparently, the former Rancho Carne captain had been stealing
cheers and routines from this under-funded school and presenting them as
her own.  The truth was never discovered because the East Compton school
could never afford to attend the state tournament.  The revelation
caused the crushed Tor to exclaim, `My whole cheerleading career has
been a lie!'
Bring It On's trailer makes the film seem like it's going to be an
un-politically correct battle against a white and black, but most of the
film focuses instead on Tor's desperate attempts at creating a decent
routine on her own.  There's a lot of witty banter and slang that
reminded me of Clueless (like when Tor announces that Missy is `the
Poo'), and the film reaches its inevitable conclusion at the
Cheerleading Championships in Daytona.
Sure  a lot of Bring It On doesn't make sense (why would Rancho Carne
bother participating in the state finals when they automatically qualify
for nationals as the defending champs?), but the film is funny enough to
make you not bother caring.  It's full of well-choreographed dance
numbers that put the crappy waltzes in Love's Labour's Lost to shame.
Bring It On is the directorial debut of Peyton Reed, who has directed
some of television's best comedy shows (Upright Citizens Brigade, Mr.
Show).  The script is from another first-timer (Jessica Bendinger) and,
while it isn't a great triumph in filmmaking, I thought the little
things added to the screenplay added greatly to the overall experience
(like the fact that Rancho Carne means, literally, `Meat Ranch').  Stick
around for the closing credits and several decent outtakes.

Review for Presque rien (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Sébastien Lifshitz's Come Undone is a real challenge to watch - not because
of its content (although there are lots of penis shots), but because of its
structure.  It could take viewers a good 30 to 40 minutes to finally settle
into Lifshitz's story, which almost haphazardly flops around using
flashbacks and flashforwards like they're going out of style.  But if you
can claw your way through it all, Undone becomes increasingly interesting as
it approaches its finale.
Lifshitz's story (co-written by Stéphane Bouquet) focuses on the first love
of college-bound 18-year-old Matthieu (Jérémie Elkaďm), who is vacationing
with his family near Nantes.  Well, most of his family, anyway.  Matthieu's
father is back in Paris because he has too much work, and his mother
(Dominique Reymond), a clinically depressed pill-popper, is only there in
form.  His sister Sarah (Laetitia Legrix) is sarcastic and full of spite,
while Annick (Marie Matheron), a friend of the family, seems to be the glue
that holds the whole dysfunctional bunch together.
One day while at the beach with Sarah, Matthieu locks eyes with a hunky
local lad named Cédric (Stéphane Rideau), a more experienced boy (and
ex-hustler, to boot) who works at a local waffle vendor.  Sparks fly and a
physical relationship quickly follows, despite the fact Matthieu has
apparently had no previous sexual experience, gay or otherwise.  Passionate
trysts turn to ugly spats, and Matthieu becomes somewhat unhinged, leading
up to Undone's gut-wrenching finale...which you kind of see at the beginning
because of the film's screwy construction.
The high point here is the acting, which never once seems like acting.  But
the story is essentially about a shy, quiet boy falling for a rough partner
from the other side of the tracks.  It's nothing new, but worth a viewing if
only for the performances of Elkaďm and Rideau.

Title
Review for Dog of Flanders, A (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The darkest children's film since the Babe sequel, A Dog of Flanders is
an early 19th century Belgian story of arson, animal cruelty, children
born out of wedlock, drinking, and corruption.  It has little to do with
the titular dog, but instead concentrates on a young boy's quest to
become the next big thing in the northern European art world.  It is not
 I repeat  not about a new dog for Bart's neighbors Rod and Todd.
The boy is Nello, a lad whose mother was lost to a blinding snowstorm
when he was two (nobody knows who his father is).  Raised by his weary,
dirt poor grandfather Jehan Daas (Jack Warden, Dirty Work), Nello helps
out by running milk into town everyday.  Like his mother, Nello (played
here by Jesse James, Message in a Bottle, who appears to be the missing
Hanson brother) also has a talent for sketching with charcoal.  One day,
he finds a large Bouvier des Flanders  a breed of hard working dog 
that was beaten and left for dead in the woods near Nello's home.
Naming him Patrasche (his mother's middle name), Nello nurses the
bear-like pooch back to health and Patrasche is soon helping the boy
with his milk runs.
Flash to a few years later, where Nello (now played by Jeremy James
Kissner, the young Finn from Great Expectations and a dead ringer for
Leelee Sobieski's younger brother) is coached by a local artist named
Michel LaGrande (Jon Voight, Varsity Blues).  LaGrande takes Nello to
see a work done by another great local artist named Peter Paul Rubens.
At first, I thought this was a cross between the guy who invented the
Mounds bar and Pee-Wee Herman.  But it turns out that LaGrande meant the
Belgian Flemish artist from the 1600s and convinces Nello to enter the
`Junior Rubens' art contest open to local youth.
Nello's best friend Aloise (Madylin Sweeten, Everybody Loves Raymond)
models for Nello's pieces, despite her father's warnings to keep away
from his daughter, especially after Nello is blamed for torching his
flour mill.  The two children still manage to sneak off to a circus,
where they share their first kiss and a dance straight from Titanic.
Despite the film's high body count and It's a Wonderful Life-ish ending
(where Nello almost meets the same Little Match Girl fate as his
mother), Flanders is a warmly glowing picture.  Gritty costumer Beatrix
Aruna Pasztor, who worked on the last six Gus van Sant films, and
cinematographer Walther van den Ende (The Eighth Day) both deserve
special recognition.  The small town's center is reminiscent of Jude,
with its main character seeming to be threatened by the heavy stones
that constitute just about everything in sight.
Based on a popular children's story, Flanders is adapted and directed by
Kevin Brodie (Treacherous), with television veteran Robert Singer
helping script this film version.  The ideas in the film seem a little
scattered  Warden disappears for about 45 minutes in the middle - and
runs a bit long.  It seems to not know where it's going or care how long
it takes to get there, but instead concentrates on looking good  which
isn't a bad thing at all.  (1:40 - PG for more violence than you would

Review for Bubble Boy (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Carol Ann Demaret, the mother of the late David Vetter, has been raising a
big stink everywhere she can about the new film Bubble Boy.  David, it turns
out, had SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency) and was the only boy who
ever lived in a bubble in real life.  While Demaret, who has yet to see the
film, is probably just another loudmouth who thinks everything is funny
until it hits too close to home (you have to wonder how many times Demaret
laughed at something like Forrest Gump), she makes a pretty good point by
saying the idea of Disney making a film that trivializes people like her son
just isn't funny.
And she ain't that far off.  Bubble Boy isn't funny, but it doesn't have
much to do with the way the film pokes fun at the SCIDsters.  In fact, there
are about a half-dozen other groups of people that have more of a right to
be pissed off at this dumb coming-of-age movie than Demaret and her cronies
(who could be working for Disney and trying to get the crappy film some
publicity).  India should be pointing their brand-new nukes at us even as we
speak.  Japan is probably planning another Pearl Harbor (which means another
Disney sequel to that film).  And I don't know what circus freak show types
do to defend themselves, but keep an eye out for it.  Boy's coup de grace
is, perhaps, the worst Jews-are-cheap joke I've ever heard in a mainstream
film (one can only assume the lynching scene was left on the editing room
floor). But God forbid somebody make fun of a kid in a bubble.
The film starts with a voiceover from Jimmy Livingston (Jake Gyllenhaal,
October Sky), the titular Boy himself, explaining he was born without
immunities and can be killed by one single, solitary germ.  Jimmy was
brought into the world "gift-wrapped from heaven," meaning in a giant
plastic bubble in which he's spent his entire life.  If that wasn't bad
enough, his mother (Swoosie Kurtz, Get Over It) is the overly religious
type, crazy enough to make cookies in the shape of crosses AND have
photographs of Reagan and Nixon hanging on the wall (maybe that's why
Demaret is so pissed off).
Jimmy, who looks a lot like Jason Biggs with a perpetually bad haircut and a
Dennis the Menace shirt, falls in love with a busty neighbor girl named
Chloe (Marley Shelton, Valentine), who is referred to as "the whore
next-door" by his mother.  As the years fly by, Jimmy and Chloe grow as
close as a boy in a bubble and a girl can possibly get.  Eventually, Chloe
runs off to marry some loser (Dave Sheridan, MTV's Buzzkill) in Niagara
Falls, and Jimmy builds himself a travel-size bubble to follow her,
interrupt the wedding (a la The Graduate) and win her heart.
Then Boy becomes one big, offensive road trip.  Or is it a
fish-out-of-bubble story?  All I know is the least offensive laughs come
courtesy of a Fabio-led Up With People kind of group called Bright and Shiny
(didn't The Jesus Lizard's David Yow used to get arrested for doing
something with a similar name?).  The writing (from debut scribes Cinco Paul
and Ken Daurio) is full of non-comedic gems, like when Jimmy meets a biker
(Danny Trejo, Spy Kids), who inquires about his strange look.  "I'm some
kind of bubble boy," Jimmy replies, at which point the biker asks, "How do
you take a dump in there?"  Certainly a valid question, but it goes
unanswered.
I think my favorite part of Boy was when Jimmy was supposed to be just
outside Niagara Falls, even though the scene was clearly filmed in the
middle of a desert in Nevada (complete with giant mountains in the
background).  Director Blair Hayes, who made the funny Austin Powers 2
commercials that spoofed The Phantom Menace, carefully places a shelf full
of Niagara Spray Starch in one of the shots, like that's somehow going make
anyone think Jimmy isn't actually in the goddamn desert.
There are a few moments that could have been funny but were ruined in some
way or another - like Jimmy's first boner, which started out cute, but ended
up creepy.  Actually, "creepy" is a pretty good word to describe Boy.  It
doesn't make you laugh and it doesn't make you cry.  It just makes you feel
icky.

Review for Detroit Rock City (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
On paper it sounds horrible.  A cast of virtual unknowns, a director
(Adam Rifkin) whose biggest hit was The Chase, a story thinner than even
Runaway Bride, and the debut script from a guy (Carl V. Dupré) who was
the assistant editor of classics like Top Dog, Leprechaun 2 and Barb
Wire.  Did I mention that it also was about KISS?  Despite all of this,
Detroit Rock City is surprisingly fresh and funny.
The meager plot, which evokes memory of another guilty pleasure, The
Ramones' Rock n' Roll High School, involves four Michigan shop class
squares from Robert F. Kennedy High who desperately try to attend a KISS
concert in Detroit.  Of course, they also have their own band  Mystery
- that have had only one ill-fated gig during which singer Hawk (Edward
Furlong, Pecker) got stage fright and passed out.  Much of the film's
focus is on Jam (Sam Huntington, Jungle2Jungle), who finds his musical
tastes clash with his mother's (Lin Shaye, There's Something About Mary)
religious beliefs  she's even a member of M.A.T.M.O.K. (Mothers Against
the Music of KISS).  Rounding out the foursome are Trip (James DeBello,
TV's The 60s) and Lex (Giuseppe Andrews, Never Been Kissed).
Set in 1978 amongst the height of KISS hysteria, Detroit Rock City opens
with a wonderful montage of 70s pop culture images that run over the
opening credits.  We learn that the four protagonists have tickets for
that night's concert, but those tickets are discovered by Jam's mom, who
immediately burns them and enrolls her son in a private school, St.
Bernard's Veil of Tears.
When Trip wins four front-row-center tickets from a radio contest, he,
Hawk and Lex ditch class, narrowly escape Elvis the school security
guard (who resembles Wolverine from The X-Men), and proceed to bust Jam
out of his Catholic hell by lacing the headmaster's pizza with
hallucinogenic mushrooms.
Their drive to Detroit is marred by an ugly incident involving a gold
Trans-Am containing four disco-loving Italians  one of which (Natasha
Lyonne, American Pie) ends up riding with the boys.  Once they arrive in
the big city, adventures include a male strip club, convenience store
robbery, sex in a church confessional and a pack of angry junkyard dogs,
as well as romantic interests in the form of Shannon Tweed (Mrs. Gene
Simmons) and Melanie Lynskey (Heavenly Creatures).  By the way, Lyonne
and Lynskey are respectively named `Christine' and `Beth,' both names of
KISS songs.
The picture's ending includes a live pyrotechnic performance from KISS
(the actual original band), which will leave any red-blooded American
between the ages of 30 and 40 squealing with delight.  At least those
Americans that didn't own any ABBA records.  (1:32 - R or strong

trying to cash in on the success of William Shakespeare's Romeo and
Juliet"
          CD "Of course. Bill and I are great friends. We play basketball once a week. He has got a good shot, but his inside game pretty shabby.  Anyway, he didn't like that fruit DiCaprio playing Romeo, but he was tickled pink that they kept the original dialogue"

          CD (slumping down in his chair) "I'm going to kill my agent.  All he told me was that they got the kids that made A Little Princess. He kept saying that over and over again. Nothing about the names changing and the dialogue changing. Tell me, who else had a different name?"

          PSB "No, the benefactor remained unchanged, but they did change the opening line to I'm going to tell it the way it happened, not the way I remember it'. I found that strange because it actually seemed like Finn didn't remember his own story and was making it up as he told it"
          PSB "He didn't remember how it really happened so he distorted the facts and twisted the truth. I implemented the same technique when I wrote the essay question in 9th grade English. Not because I couldn't remember, but because I didn't read the book"
          PSB "Wait, don't go away mad. There were some good parts.  Emmanuel Lubezki did a great job with the photography and the sets were very well done. It was visually pleasing.
          PSB "Right. Estella was still stony cold. She didn't tell Finn that she had no heart and no sympathy sentiment nonsense', but she did walk out of the room after letting Finn digitally investigate her"
          PSB "Yeah. And Finn still has a surprisingly absent lack of will and ability to control his own destiny. It didn't, however, give me the same feeling about Finn expecting Dinsmoor to eventually give' Estella to him. It was just sappy Hollywood romance bull-shit"

Review for Five Senses, The (1999)
Jeremy Podeswa's The Five Senses could have been a gimmicky mess, but
the writer/director's film about five people who each have one wayward
sense is a remarkable triumph of filmmaking.  Like Krzysztof
Kieslowski's Decalogue, which focused on each of the Ten Commandments,
Senses' subtle approach doesn't hit you over the head.  With five
interwoven stories that border on the ironically tragic playing out over
a three-day period, Senses plays like Magnolia directed by Atom Egoyan.
Richard (Philippe Volter, who was in Kieslowski's The Double Life of
Veronique) is an ophthalmologist who is slowly going deaf.  His neighbor
Ruth (Gabrielle Rose, who was in Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter) is a
massage therapist who can't manage to touch her daughter Rachel (Nadia
Litz) emotionally.  Rachel, an ugly-duckling teen dropout in search of
her own identity, is a bit of a voyeur, but can't manage to keep her
eyes on a three-year-old left in her charge.  Bisexual housecleaner
Robert (Daniel MacIvor, Beefcake) thinks he can smell love and arranges
meetings with all of his former lovers to sniff out a lifemate.
Robert's best friend Rona (Mary-Louise Parker, Goodbye Lover) makes
intricately designed cakes that taste like cardboard.
The stories are pulled together by the disappearance of the
three-year-old (Elise Francis Stolk).  The most interesting of the five
stories involves Rona's relationship with Roberto (Marco Leonardi), an
Italian chef she met while vacationing in Europe.  As Senses opens,
Roberto is coming to visit the skeptical and suspicious Rona, who
believes that he may be using her to gain citizenship.  Roberto can't
speak English, and Podeswa doesn't subtitle his dialogue until the end
of the film so, like Rona, you never know his true intentions.
It's fun trying to guess which character matches each particular sense.
When you first see Richard the eye doctor, you assume he'll handle the
sense of sight tale (he doesn't).  When Ruth is shown giving massages,
you assume that her story will feature the sense of touch (she does, but
not in the conventional way).  I also enjoyed the way that Podeswa
begins the film inside of a deprivation chamber in Ruth's office.
Senses was named Best Canadian Feature Film at last year's Toronto
International Film Festival (the film was shot in and around Toronto),
and was nominated for nine Genie Awards (the Canandian equivalent of the
Oscar) where Podeswa took home the trophy for Best Director.  Senses was
elegantly lensed by cinematographer Gregory Middleton (Better Than
Chocolate) and features a handsome, haunting score from Alexina Louie
and Alex Pauk (Last Night).

Review for Desperate Measures (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
This film would have been a lot better if it was made for TV.  It had
that kind of feel to it.  The formula is: a small sick child, a single
parent who would go to any extreme to save their stupid kid, and the bad
guy.  The only thing that breaks the formula is that Meredith
Baxter-Birney does not play the parent.
Peter McCabe (Garcia) is the Desperate single parent who must find a
bone marrow transplant to save the life of his son before he dies.  He
breaks into the FBI computer to run through a list of potential matches
and finds one in the deranged killer, Frank Connor (Keaton).  Connor,
while initially slow to accept the offer of sharing his bone marrow,
eventually agrees in exchange for restored smoking privileges, library
access, an extra sugar for his coffee and reassignment to the general
prison population.  Little do they all know, he actually plans to escape
before the operation even takes place!
Could this surprise anyone watching?  The characters are completely
stunned.  And to make matters worse, they can't kill Connor because the
kid will die without him.  What a dilemma.
What ensues is a cross between Extreme Measures and an episode of
Chicago Hope.  That's right, boring trifling cliched cardboard shit.
Barbet Schroeder, who hasn't made a decent film since I was legally able
to drink (Reversal of Fortune), does nothing original in his direction.
The opening credits and the poster are both better than the final
product that you see on the screen.

Title
Review for Black and White (1999)
Although most descriptions of this film will suggest that Black & White
is primarily about white America's fascination with black culture, there
are actually three additional facets to its story.  People seem to
immediately latch on to the idea of a group of rich, white teenagers
from Manhattan's Upper East Side that fall in love with the whole
hip-hop mentality.  They come from big houses with black servants and,
in their eyes, there is nothing cooler than hangin' wit' the homeboys
down at the crib.  These kids are played by William Lee Scott (October
Sky), Eddie Kaye Thomas (American Pie), Bijou Phillips (Sugar Town),
Gaby Hoffmann (200 Cigarettes) and Elijah Wood (The Faculty).
The second piece revolves around a gangsta named Rich Bower (Wu-Tang's
Power, in his film debut), who desperately wants to shed his criminal
past and become a rap mogul.  This change in lifestyle means that Rich
has to deal with white people for the first time in his business life.
In addition to having the little caucasian kids flock to him, Rich's
crew also includes fellow Wu-Tang Clansmen Method Man and Raekwon, the
latter of whom also serves as the film's associate producer.
Story No. 3 involves Rich's best friend Dean (N.Y. Knick Allan Houston,
Blue Chips), a basketball player dating a genius anthropology grad
student (supermodel Claudia Schiffer).  Dean is approached by a shady
character (Ben Stiller, Mystery Men) that offers him a wad of cash to
shave points off of an upcoming game.
The fourth section in Black & White concerns a sexually ambiguous
husband-and-wife documentary filmmaking duo played by Brooke Shields
(The Bachelor) and Robert Downey Jr. (Wonderboys  that's two films in a
row that he's played a gay character named Terry).  They're crazy about
the idea of making a film about the black-acting white kids, and much of
Black & White is shown through the eyes of their camera, giving the film
a bit of a documentary feel itself.
There are other elements to the story, but these four make up the
majority of Black & White.  The result seems like an ambitious attempt
at remaking Robert Altman's Nashville into a hip-hop flick.  But it's
just not that interesting.  While the film is sort of curiously
unpredictable, the only story that held my interest was Dean and the
point-shaving incident.  I am interested in the phenomenon where white
youth are drawn to the whole hip-hop thing, but Black & White never
takes a stab at trying to answer why.
Much is made of the scene with potential future cellmates Downey Jr. and
Mike Tyson (playing himself).  It deserves the buzz - the improvised gem
is as electrifying as it is frightening.  Tyson does a surprisingly good
job in the film, as does Schiffer, who is somehow believable as a
braniac.  Writer/director James Toback (Two Girls and a Guy) allegedly
picked up random street kids to help him edit the film in an attempt to
achieve a more realistic feel.  It's gritty and all, but there isn't
much meat to it.

Review for Waking Life (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you're at the theatre and the movie you're watching feels like a
nightmare, you've probably wandered into Serendipity.  But if the images on
the screen make you feel as though you're floating through someone else's
loopy dream, you must be watching Richard Linklater's Waking Life. It's a
terrific new picture that, despite playing tricks with your eyes and making
your head hurt as you begin to obsess about your own dreams, is worth every
single, precious minute.
Unconventional in just about every way possible, Life is the first animated
feature to be shot on digital video.  If the previous sentence makes little
sense to you, you're not alone.  Here's the deal: Linklater (The Newton
Boys) filmed his own script with handheld digital cameras, edited it, and
then turned it over to an animation team that used rotoscoping software to
trace over the video images.  The result is like a watercolor painting come
to life.  It's amazing.  It's breathtaking.  It's hell-a-cool.
The story itself, which actually barely matters here, is really just dozens
of vignettes that feature an unnamed protagonist played by Wiley Wiggins (he
had a small part in Linklater's Dazed and Confused), a college grad
stumbling from one wacky encounter to the next.  Everyone he meets has a
story to tell or some type of unsolicited diatribe to pitch.  Eventually, he
realizes it's all a dream and fights to wake up, only to learn he was in a
dream within a dream.
Seemingly unable to really wake up, the young man tries to understand the
meaning of dreams and, of course, everyone is willing to lay polysyllabic
explanations at his feet.  Each has their own crackpot theory - some are
pretentiously absurd and some are thought-provoking.  Like I said earlier,
though, none of it matters because you'll be so entirely hypnotized by the
visuals.
Part of me wonders if Linklater made the dialogue easy to ignore on purpose.
We're talking about lines like "I feel that the time has come to project my
own inadequacies and dissatisfactions into the sociopolitical and scientific
schemes."  It's like a frigging college lecture - who's going to pay
attention to that?  Is somebody more likely to remember the heady dialogue
or the scene where The Cruise's Timothy "Speed" Levitch materializes like
the Great Gazoo when the main character is on what appears to be the
Brooklyn Bridge?
One of the most enjoyable things about Life is its lack of continuity.  Many
animators worked on the various vignettes, leaving each to look quite
different than the next.  Some scenes resemble blurry live-action, while
some use the animation to exaggerate facial expressions and manipulate the
backgrounds in various ways.  You never know what you're going to see in the
next episode.
Linklater used mostly non-actors in Life, so don't bother trying to figure
out who everybody is.  There are a handful you might recognize, like Ethan
Hawke and Julie Delpy, who reprise their roles from Linklater's Before
Sunrise.  One scene features Nicky Katt and Adam Goldberg, and there are two
directors in the film, too.  Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh (Traffic) stops
by for an animated cameo, and Linklater himself is in the final scene, where
the protagonist tracks him down to find out when he's going to wake up.
How's that for trippy?

Review for Adanggaman (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Forget Spielberg's Amistad.  Pretend John Singleton's Rosewood never
happened.  Take all the video copies of Beloved and.okay, maybe that's going
too far.  The point is that most films we've seen about slavery are the same
story over and over and over again.  Sure, they make you mad and tug at your
heartstrings (and cause white people to feel really uncomfortable for the
better part of the ride home...until "All-Star" comes on the radio), but
most follow the same formula, which is why the quality of the genre has
gradually taken a nosedive since Roots aired on television.
Enter Roger Gnoan M'Bala's Adanggaman, a somewhat exciting new film from the
Ivory Coast that breaks the lame American cinematic slavery mold.  It's set
entirely in Africa (Guineau, to be exact) during the late 17th century, and,
at least from its first few scenes, doesn't seem like it's going to deal
with slavery at all.  Adanggaman starts with a young couple having sex; the
guy is Ossei (Ziable Honoré Goore Bi), and his father is forcing him to
marry a different girl.
After being mercilessly beaten by his father for carrying on with this other
girl, Ossei packs up his bow and best pelt and hits the road.  He returns a
few days later, only to find his village torched, his father dead, and most
of the others missing.  What Ossei doesn't know is that his missing
neighbors have been captured by an extremely well-organized group of giant,
bloodthirsty female warriors.  These Amazonesque women work for the
power-hungry King Adanggaman, who, in turn, sells unsuspecting villagers to
the Dutch for guns and rum.
The rest of Adanggaman follows Ossei's fight to free his family from the
King's steely grip.  His journey includes befriending a faith-healer with a
warrior daughter, for whom Ossei falls.  The shockingly brutal film also
teaches certain slave auction protocol, like that the bidding begins with
sheep, then moves on to cows, then goats.  Then, and only then, can you bid
with yams.

Review for Patriot, The (2000)
If you liked Braveheart, you probably liked Gladiator. They both had
Australian stars playing extremely manly, likeable heroes who lead
rag-tag bunches of untrained men against seemingly insurmountable
forces.  Each has a really bad guy doing really rotten stuff to really
innocent people.  And each of the male leads are reluctant warriors,
dragged into large-scale confrontation only after somebody messes with
their family in some horrible way.
The Patriot is more of the same - even more so than Gladiator - and
could have saved a fortune in marketing costs by just calling itself
Braveheart II:  The Phantom Menace.  In this installment, Mel Gibson
battles the English on American soil during the Revolutionary War, as
opposed to Braveheart's 13th century Scotland backdrop.  Gibson
(Payback) plays Benjamin Martin, a man who could be a direct descendant
of William Wallace  (he does everything but wear the kilt and the blue
face paint).
The film starts off in 1776 South Carolina.  Martin, a former war
captain, has turned decidedly anti-war ever since his beloved wife went
tits up. The reason for his pacifism?  He's afraid of leaving his seven
children without a father.  Martin even goes to the Continental Congress
in Charleston to vote against the war, but his side loses and, to make
matters worse, his oldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger, 10 Things I Hate
About You) signs up to fight the Redcoats.
Before long, the battles are literally being fought in Martin's
backyard. Gabriel is captured by the ridiculously ruthless Col. William
Tavington  (Jason Isaacs, The End of the Affair) and ordered to hang for
betraying King George.  Some other stuff happens that I won't give away
here, but before you know it, Martin is wielding his tomahawk and
covered in English blood.  He even teaches two of his younger sons how
to attack a procession of English officers.  The scene, which has
already sparked a lot of debate over the whole kids/guns issue, is a
revelation as both boys are so scared that they end up looking through
the sights of their guns with tears in their eyes.  Kudos to
screenwriter Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan) for this splendid scene.
Like Braveheart's Wallace, Martin has a smart mouth, a cocky attitude
and fights like he's immune to death.  He uses eyebrow-raising tricks
and unconventional combat techniques, and apparently is the guy that
came up with the idea of hiding behind rocks and trees while engaged in
gunfire with the enemy (as opposed to marching in a straight line in a
wide-open field, which was all the rage back then).  And he can mix it
up like nobody's business, brandishing a long list of weapons from guns
to flagpoles.
But there are problems with Martin's character, too.  He's way too
squeaky-clean and noble.  Even his slaves aren't slaves (they just love
working his fields).  Interestingly enough, Martin's character is
supposedly based on one Francis `The Swamp Fox' Marion, a Revolutionary
War hero and noted racist that bragged about hunting American Indians
for sport.  Allegedly, The Patriot was intended to be a biopic about
Marion's life, but once Sony Pictures heard about the Swamp Fox's
real-life exploits, they changed the name of the character and, as they
say, the rest is history.  Here, some brief mentions are made to some
atrocity that Martin may have committed against the French and the
Cherokee at a place called Fort Wilderness.  But Gibson is Gibson - as
long as he's bashing people's skulls in, the world is a happy place.
The Patriot simply looks amazing from the first frame to the last.  It's
one of those films whose scenes seem to be set during sunrise or
sundown, thanks to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel's (Anna & The King)
warm photography.  There are several scenes set in a foggy graveyard
marsh, where Martin and his band of merry men meet to discuss battle
plans.  It looks like something out of Sleepy Hollow.  Perennial
Oscar-nominee John Williams (Angela's Ashes) score manages to press most
of the right buttons.
The Patriot was produced and directed by the team that brought us
Godzilla and ID4 (Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin), but this film is
leaps and bounds better than those two travesties.  And this film is the
second in two weeks to feature either Gibson (he lends his voice to
Rocky the Rooster in the animated Chicken Run) or the underused Chris
Cooper (Me, Myself & Irene), who plays Col. Harry Burwell in this
picture.

Title
Review for Tigger Movie, The (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
I've never been much of a Tigger fan and, for the life of me, I can't
figure out why some people get so worked up over him.  Sure, he looks
cuddly, but to me he's always seemed like a lightweight Daffy Duck
knock-off (even though Tigger was around first).  I barely wanted to see
the film as it was, so imagine my horror when the theatre lights finally
go down and the screen lights up with something called `Disney Mambo No.
5,' which is basically a music video featuring
fourteen-and-a-half-minutes-into-his-fame Lou Bega.
The animated Tigger actually kicks off with a live-action scene of
Christopher Robin's bedroom.  For those of you that don't know the
basics of the whole `Pooh' story, Christopher was the son of creator
A.A. Milne, who wrote a series of books in the 1920s that were based on
his boy's stuffed animals plus a couple of real animals that lived in
the wooded area near their home.  Tigger's story is basically depicted
as one of the books in Christopher's room and is narrated by some
invisible guy that turns the pages of the book as the film progresses.
As viewers are initially submerged into the world of the Hundred-Acre
Wood, Tigger appears and sings a song proclaiming that the wonderful
thing about Tiggers is that he is the only one.  Damn straight, brother
 and thank God for that.  Tigger is a bouncer, apparently deriving
great pleasure from using his tail as a pogo stick and springing all
over the place.  He tries to get his friends to bounce with him, but
they're all too busy  raspy Pooh is too busy stockpiling pots of hunny
and worrywart Piglet seems concerned only for the amount of firewood he
has saved for the winter.  Only little Roo seems to have the patience to
deal with Tigger, who pretty much annoys everyone in the whole
Hundred-Acre Wood.  As they try to get things done, he bugs them - kind
of like a bouncy orange Kramer.
And speaking of Roo, who is his father?  The original Pooh books must
have been pretty edgy for the 20s, portraying Kanga as a single mother
way before it was fashionable.  She doesn't look too slutty, and since
the characters in these stories are fairly limited, my money would be on
the downtrodden Eeyore.  It's always the quiet ones you have to watch
out for.  And will somebody get Pooh a shirt that will fit over his
giant belly?  That little red number just doesn't cut it.  He looks like
a film critic, for Christ's sake.
Anyway, the story follows Tigger as he searches for his family during
the onset of winter.  He wants to track them down to have someone to
bounce with  something that I've always felt should be accomplished
with a person outside of the family.  He imagines what his family looks
like (shown through paintings inspired by Dali,Warhol, et al.) and he
sings songs.  A lot of songs.  There were at least seven that I was
awake forand the film is only seventy-eight minutes long.  Do the math
 that's better than a song every ten minutes, toppling Topsy-Turvy for
the championship of the world.
The best scene is probably supposed to be when they all don Tigger
costumes to pose as his family, but the whole thing is depicted in the
film's poster, not to mention toy stores that have already begun to sell
stuffed Poohs and Piglets wearing Tigger suits.  The animation is less
that spectacular, but it's pretty true to the pictures in the Disney
books.  The voice work is also pretty lackluster, with the performers'
credits reading like a `who's not' in the animation industry.  Most of
their previous work is listed as `Additional Voices,' which pretty much
amounts to cartoon voice extras.
But, hey  it's short, the kids will probably dig it and it's not
Pokémon.  It could be a lot worse.

Review for Six Days Seven Nights (1998)
Meeting its relatively low expectations, the new action-comedy (or
`academy') Six Days, Seven Nights offers very little in terms of
originality, excitement or romance.  And I say low expectations because
the script from a first time writer (Michael Browning) and the director
is the recent lobotomy victim responsible for last year's reprehensible
Father's Day (Ivan Reitman).
The story could be written on the back of a matchbook  dumb-girl and
dumb-guy go to Hawaii; dumb-girl gets a call from her boss and has to
fly to another island with pilot old-guy; their planes crashes and they
fall in love.  That's it.  No cannibals on the island, no radios made
out of coconuts and no giant spiders.  I will say with no shame that
Gilligan's Island was more groundbreaking in terms of desert seclusion.
Actually, Six Days comes off as a bad hybrid of Gilligan and Romancing
the Stone.
The dumb-girl is named Robin Monroe (Anne Heche, Wag the Dog).  Her
first encounter with old-guy Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford, Air Force One)
is at the airport as he prepares his prop engine plane to haul Robin and
her dumb-boy beau Frank Martin (David Schwimmer, Friends) to a remote
Pacific vacation haven.  The scene bares a striking resemblance to an
earlier Ford film, as Robin repeatedly questions the ability of Quinn's
aging craft to safely deliver her to their destination (think Solo, Leia
and the Millenium Falcon in Star Wars).
Thirty minutes later, Robin and Quinn are stranded on what I can only
explain as the biggest deserted island in the history of the world.  Why
would something this huge and beautiful remain undeveloped by
conscienceless vacation kingpins?  I dunno either, but these two duds
predictably use the setting as a backdrop to bicker and then fall in
love.  YAWN!
Their only foil, other than the script, is a ship full of dirty pirates
led by Broken English's Temura Morrison.  These pirates would apparently
rather see Robin and Quinn dead than harmlessly stranded on the island.
Now that I think about it, I would also rather see them dead.
Back in civilization, dumb-boy Frank thinks his fiancée is dead and
quickly proceeds to flog Quinn's piece of ass wife six ways from
Sunday.  If these two were stranded on the island, Frank could have
knocked her out with a coconut, used her carcass for a boat and rowed
back home, using her ample bosom as personal flotation devices.  If
anyone cares, her name is Angelica and she is played by Problem Child 3
star Jacqueline Obradors.  I didn't think anyone cared.
While Ford looks good for 64, his acting skills leave something to be
desired.  His range is microscopic and his best acting is done when his
character is unconscious.  You know there's big problems when Schwimmer
outshines you.  Another huge flaw is the lack of chemistry between Ford
and Heche, who handles her role a bit more capably despite being young
enough to be the daughter of her wooden screen co-star.
The scenery is quite lovely and keenly shot by Michael Chapman (Raging
Bull).  But, the big finger of shame points fully at producer/director
Reitman, who has plummeted from the upper echelon of Hollywood comedy
creators (Animal House, Stripes) to the lowly depths of uninspired,
by-the-numbers Hollywood crap.  Flush it away, America.  Flush it twice
- just to be sure.

Title
Review for Songcatcher (1999)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The very idea of an arthouse film about a person going off to a remote area
to "catch" songs makes me giggle uncontrollably.  Since when does
independent cinema have to steal ideas from Pokémon?  Is there really any
difference between gathering old Gaelic tunes and stockpiling "pocket
monsters"?  Beats me, but at least Songcatcher didn't give me any seizures.
The film, which is a must for any music lover that isn't into bands that
spell stuff wrong (i.e., Limp Bizkit, Korn, Staind, Outkast, etc.), is set
just after the turn of the 20th century and opens at an unnamed university.
Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer, The King is Alive) believes she's in line
for a big promotion in the school's music department, but the position is
instead given to a well-respected musical outsider.  To make matters worse
for Lily, the university's board made the decision unanimously, despite the
fact that she was having an affair with one of the higher powers.
Disenchanted with the school (and men in general), Lily heads off to her
sister Elna's (Jane Adams, The Anniversary Party) home in a coal-mining town
deep in the Appalachian Mountains.  When she gets there, Lily discovers
(among other things) the area is filled with a bunch of barefoot,
jug-blowin', foot-stompin', overall-wearin' hillbillies who croon
traditional folk music learned from their Irish and Scottish ancestors.
Even though she has heard some of the songs before, the locals' versions are
much more pure and contain numerous verses that Lily has never encountered.
This is when the collecting starts.  Lily tries to have an assistant lug an
extremely heavy recording device though the hills to track down as many
songs as she can.  And she's met with resistance, initially in the form of a
shotgun-wielding grandmother named Viney (Pat Carroll), and then, after you
say to yourself, "I hope Lily gets a love interest," Viney's grandson, Tom
(a very chunky Aidan Quinn, Practical Magic), who thinks Lily is just trying
to take advantage of them thar bumpkins.
If you're going for the music, you won't be disappointed, as the characters
belt out bubble-sounding songs that contain some seriously dark material
(and they're performed by the likes of Taj Mahal and Emmylou Harris).  But
there isn't much going on other than the music.  Writer/director Maggie
Greenwald tries to pack too much feminist dogma into the story, which makes
the whole thing seem like a heavy-handed message film.  So what if Lily was
passed over for a job in favor of a man who was more qualified but happened
to be an outsider?  Maybe if she spent more time on her career and less time
under her married superior, she would have received the promotion.  Or at
least a little sympathy.
The feminist territory isn't much of a surprise, as Greenwald's previous
(and only other) film was The Ballad of Little Jo, which basically was a
Western version of Boys Don't Cry.  And it's too bad, because Songcatcher
has the potential to be a big crowd-pleaser (it even won a Special Jury
Prize for Ensemble Cast at this year's Sundance Film Festival).  McTeer does
what she can with her poorly written (and, at times, unlikeable) role, but
the true standout is young Emmy Rossum, who plays one of Elna's musically
gifted students.

Title
Review for Born Romantic (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Writer/director David Kane's Born Romantic is the kind of British romantic
comedy you see at a festival and walk out thinking it could be funny,
lighthearted and appealing enough to be the next The Full Monty. Then, after
you think about it for a while, or, God forbid, see it again, you realize
how little meat it has on its bones. That's not to say it's not enjoyable,
entertaining and well-acted - just empty and routine.
Romantic consists of three intertwining stories about men pursing women in
and around a London Salsa club. The stories are held together by Jimmy
(Adrian Lester, Love's Labour's Lost), a cabbie responsible for shuttling
the characters around the city (you might think he's the only hack in
London, if you don't count Arsenal's Patrick Viera). He chats with two
co-workers at Kismet Cabs (John Thomson and Spring Forward's Ian Hart)
during their breaks, providing the film with a fairly interesting Greek
chorus.
Here's a rundown of the men who are unlucky in love (but, if you've got half
a brain, you know they'll end up happier than John Ashcroft at a Bob Jones
University-sponsored Ku Klux Klan rally):
ˇ Frankie (Craig Ferguson, Saving Grace) is a businessman who is divorced
but still living with his shrewish ex-wife (Hermoine Norris) until their
house, which is slowly sinking into the ground, is sold. He meets and falls
in love with the beautiful Eleanor (Olivia Williams, The Sixth Sense), who,
of course, wants nothing to do with him.
ˇ Fergus (David Morrissey, Hilary and Jackie) is a struggling musician who
has returned to London after a six-year absence to find his long-lost love,
the sex-craved museum lover, Mo (Jane Horrocks, Little Voice).
ˇ Eddie (Jimi Mistry) is a clumsy criminal who hides out in the Salsa club
after a botched ATM robbery attempt. He picks the pocket of a mousy girl
named Jocelyn (Catherine McCormack, Shadow of the Vampire), but ends up
falling for her.
And that's pretty much it. None of the characters are wacky enough to be
unbelievable, except possibly Jocelyn, who wears a neck-brace and runs a
funeral plot maintenance business called Loved Ones Limited. There's a lot
of dancing, a lot of chasing, and one strange gag about putting hot sauce on
a certain part of the male anatomy.
Kane made a bit of a name for himself with 1999's This Year's Love (which
also starred Hart and McCormack - and was unreleased in the U.S.), nabbing a
British Independent Film Award for his screenplay. Romantic is nicely
structured, but is ultimately predictable - a frustrating fact that you've
probably come to accept from mainstream Hollywood romantic comedies, but may
still be disappointed to see in indie films like this. Robert Alazraki (The
Closer You Get - another disappointing British rom-com with Mr. Hart)
provides nice photography, adding enough red hues to the Salsa club scenes
to make you seem like you're at a Tijuana donkey show.

Title
Review for Diamond Men (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Poor Robert Forster.  He's responsible for two of the best onscreen
performances this year, but they're both in movies most people will never
see, even if audiences are lucky enough to have the films play in a theatre
near them. Forster's turn in the film adaptation of David Mamet's Lakeboat
is strong enough to be remembered at end-of-the-year award time, and his
latest, Diamond Men, might feature an even better performance from the
leathery veteran.
Forster plays widower Eddie Miller, a traveling diamond salesman approaching
60 like a school bus with no brakes.  After a heart episode leaves him
uninsurable and undesirable to his employer, Eddie is given a choice - break
in Bobby, his young, inexperienced replacement, or hit the road.  Because
he's worried about making the mortgage payments, Eddie opts for the former,
thus launching the tale of the older, wiser man and the young, brash dude
driving around Central Pennsylvania for several weeks.  You know they'll
dislike each other at first, but eventually warm up to one another. So why
bother?  The younger guy must be played by some hot, up-and-coming actor
like Mark Ruffalo, right?
Actually, no.  Bobby is played by Donnie Wahlberg, who, despite having
screen time in one of the biggest films of all-time (The Sixth Sense) is
politely referred to, at best, as either a washed-up has-been or Marky
Mark's balding brother.  But you know what?  He ain't bad, either.
Wahlberg's Bobby, an ex-vending machine supplier who scored well on the
psych portion of his test in diamond sales school, isn't so much brash as
naďve to the ways of the world.  He thinks he can just waltz into stores
owned by Eddie's clients and sweet-talk his way into boffo sales.  Unlike
Eddie, who has to be at the top of his game to stay afloat, Bobby sees sales
as something to do when he's not chasing tail.
Sure, there are the typical clashes between the two (over everything from
music to proper attire), but when Bobby shows a genuine interest in learning
the trade after a tough week on the road, Eddie takes him under his wing.
Bobby learns selling isn't an exact science, unlike the things he was taught
in training school.  "That's not what we learned in Providence" is a line he
repeats over and over again.
If Eddie has a mantra, it's "Protect the line."  He's referring to the
extremely valuable stash of diamonds the two men peddle, and because Eddie
takes so much care in guarding the stones, you know it'll somehow factor
into the film's last act.  What you don't see coming is how it happens.  I
won't go into the whole thing, but it involves another has-been (Jasmine
Guy, A Different World) and something called the Altoona Riding Club (which,
incidentally, was the original title of the film).
Men is a lot like Spring Forward, which featured another molasses-paced,
impeccably acted May-December relationship between two guys reluctantly
forced into friendship by their employment.  While I enjoyed Forward more as
a film, Forster's acting trumped the performances of Ned Beatty and Liev
Schreiber.  You hear Men is a film about an old salesman ready to be put out
to pasture and immediately conjure images of Willy Loman, but Forster's
Eddie is far from it.  Loman despised his job, but you can tell Eddie loves
it (especially the routine), even as he trains the man who will eventually
render him obsolete.

Review for Dark City (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The trailer for Dark City looked so cool.  Well, I guess the actual
movie looked cool, too.  It just wasn't cool.  In fact, it kinda blew.
This is what I think it was about
John Murdoch (Sewell, Dangerous Beauty) wakes up in a hotel tub.  He has
no recollection of who he is, how he got there or if he sliced up the
whore in his room.  Afraid that he may be a serial killer, the confused
but aptly named John flees the scene.
The ensuing ninety minutes involve a wacky doctor (Sutherland), a
brilliant cop (Hurt) and a pack of evil floating bald guys in hats and
long black trench coats.  The bad men, who have nifty names like Mr.
Hand and Mr. Book, are from another world and have come to earth to
continuously experiment on us humans so that they can live longer.  John
is an experiment gone bad because he can do crazy shit with his mind.
Or something.  Now, on to the important stuff.
Dark City looks awesome.  Its set design is kind of a cross between The
Hudsucker Proxy, Metropolis, City of Lost Children and Batman.  It's
perpetually nighttime (hence the title) and always sinister looking,
even when the building aren't trying to kill you.  From the looks of it,
Dark City is supposed to be set in the 40's, but who the hell could
concentrate with the throbbing pulse of Trevor Jones music.  The
inhabitants of the Dark City don't even realize that it's never daytime,
so don't ask them.
Writer/Director Alex Proyas (The Crow) needs to stop it with the writing
and concentrate on making the pretty.  He needs to find a good script
and just direct it.  Dark City makes it obvious that Proyas suffers from
Attention Deficit Disorder.  The quick, choppy editing is at first
appearance annoying and later laughable.  The guy sitting next to me
said it was like taking a regular conversation and editing out all of
the spaces between the words.  Mercifully, this made Dark City short,
which is its second greatest attribute.
While the production package is certainly the high point, the acting is
pretty decent as well.  Sewell is relatively unknown to the mindless
U.S. filmgoers and the girls will probably like his bare bum, which is
shown in the first few minutes.  Hurt and Sutherland pull of believable
performances in unbelievable roles, but I will never know why people
continue to cast Jennifer Connelly.  She sucks the life out of every
scene that she is in.  She has two great assets, but you don't even get
to see them, so why bother?  Potential viewers should ask themselves
that question before doling out their cash for this picture.

Review for Djomeh (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Hassan Yektapanah's Djomeh won the Golden Camera Award (for best first
feature) at Cannes, firmly establishing Iran as the world's current
cinematic hotbed.  Fans of Abbas Kiarostami (The Wind Will Carry Us) and
Jafar Panahi (The Circle) should love Djomeh, as Yektapanah honed his skills
by working as an assistant director for both filmmakers (he wrote, directed,
edited and even served as a production designer here).
The film is about a young man (Jalil Nazari) from Afghanistan (hey, that
rhymes!) who leaves his homeland because of his country's traditions
regarding marriage.  Djomeh wants to marry by his 20th birthday, but customs
say he must wait until he is much, much older.  So he relocates to Iran and
gets a job at a dairy farm, where he milks the cows and goats and drives
around town to collect milk from everyone else, accompanied by his boss
(Mahmoud Behraznia), who becomes somewhat of a father figure to Djomeh.
The two have long conversations about love and marriage, revealing Djomeh to
be an intelligent, well-spoken, sincere lad.  On one of his delivery stops,
Djomeh meets a girl (Mahbobeh Khalili) and falls head-over-heels, but
because of Iranian customs, she can't even speak to him.
With a soundtrack toplined by moaning cows and goats, Djomeh, like other
recent offerings from Iran, is comprised mostly of long shots from a single
stationary camera and uses a group of actors with no background in film.
This makes the picture seem more realistic and much more enjoyable to watch
than something packed full of professional actors (like America's
Sweethearts).

Title
Review for Abre los ojos (1997)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
An eclectic mix of The Matrix, The Game and Groundhog's Day, this
Spanish import was the winner of the Grand Prix award at the Tokyo
International Film Festival.  And if you've seen any Japanese
psychological thrillers lately, you'll know exactly why.
Director Alejandro Amenábar, who co-wrote the script with Mateo Gil,
casts Eduardo Noriega as César, a handsome, well-to-do bachelor that
prides himself on never bedding the same girl twice.  That is, until he
meets Sofía (Penélope Cruz, The Hi-Lo Country).  The trouble is that his
previous conquest, Nuria (Najwa Nimri, Lovers of the Arctic Circle) is a
bit of a wacko, continually stalking César and eventually disfiguring
his pretty-boy face in an automobile accident/suicide attempt.
But is any of it real?  César repeatedly wakes up to a world that is
slightly different than that of the previous day.  Was there really an
accident?  Is there really a Sofía?  Were doctors really able to
reconstruct César's face?  You'll have to see it to find out, and even
then you may not even know.  It's tough to follow and the subtitles
don't help.  But it is sufficiently strange to whet this boy's
appetite.  (1:50 - R for nudity, strong sexuality, language and some
violence  In Spanish with English subtitles)

Title
Review for Forces of Nature (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:   http://www.sick-boy.com
One of the surest signs that your impending wedding may not be the
wisest of life choices is when your grandpa keels over at your bachelor
party.  If that doesn't change your mind, try having Gramps telling you,
on his deathbed, that he never loved your grandmother.  Despite these
colossal warning signs, Ben (as in Affleck, Armageddon) decides to
proceed as planned with his nuptials to his bland but beautiful fiancée
(Maura Tierney, NewsRadio).
As if that wouldn't make things stressful enough, the two New Yorkers
decide to take separate flights to Savannah, Georgia - where the wedding
will take place - because Ben wants to spend time with his ailing
granddad.  His best man (Steve Zahn, You've Got Mail) stays behind with
Ben, but, as they're about to board their flight, bails out because he
forgot his shoes and the all-important rings.
Again Ben ignores this as an omen and hops on the plane, even though he
is deathly afraid of flying.  He is seated next to a woman named Sarah
(Sandra Bullock, Practical Magic), who looks like Ally Sheedy heading
back home for her 10-year Breakfast Club High School reunion.  As it
takes off, a seagull flies into the plane's engine, causing it to crash
into that lovely `Welcome to NY' sign that graces the end of the runway
at LaGuardia.  This forewarning also goes unnoticed by Ben.  Starting to
get the impression that he's no super genius, eh?
Long story short, Ben saves Sarah and hauls her body out of the
wreckage.  After she comes to, he finds out that she also needs to get
to Savannah tout suite in order to sell a failing bagel shop.  The two
decide to travel together and the following eighty or so minutes unfolds
just like Planes, Trains & Automobiles, with each mode of transportation
being less successful than the previous.  But their predicament only
seems to invigorate the dopey Ben except, of course, for that fact that
he (duh!) falls in love with Sarah.  Unfortunately, there is no `Where's
your hand?'  `Between two pillows.'  `Those aren't pillows!' scene.
Don't let the ads fool you  Forces is no chick-flick.  It's
surprisingly funny and has a terrific look, thanks to director Bronwen
Hughes (Harriet the Spy) and cinematographer Elliot Davis (Out of
Sight), and culminates in an amazing finale that merges a big outdoor
wedding and a powerful hurricane.  As far as acting, Affleck does his
best to make you forget about that abominable `animal cracker' scene
from Armageddon, while Bullock does okay with her less meaty role.  In
spite of the strange transformation that her character goes through
(from thick black eye makeup and crazy hair towell, to Sandra Bullock),
she gives her least annoying performance in years.
1:49  PG-13 for some adult language and adult situation

Title
Review for Leggenda del pianista sull'oceano, La (1998)
Earlier this year, Brendan Fraser starred in Blast from the Past, a
comical fish-out-of-water story about a man that was forced to grow up
in a bomb shelter because of his father's knee-jerk reaction to the
Cuban Missile Crisis.  While the film was a bit slight, it was still
enjoyable to see the culture shock Fraser's Adam suffered as he tried to
adjust from his docile 1962 to our dreadful 1999.
In The Legend of 1900, we nearly get more of the same.  It's a
fish-won't-get-out-of-water tale of a man that lived his life on a
luxury ocean liner.  Only here, unlike Blast, our protagonist can never
muster enough courage to step foot off the vessel.  And, like Blast, the
film is a bit slight - a legend that offers no real point or moral  but
still entertaining.
Tim Roth (Hoodlum) stars as Danny Boodmann T.D. Lemons Nineteen Hundred
(or `1900' for short, and `19' for friends) - a name nearly as long as
its explanation.  A laborer aboard The Virginian discovers an abandoned
infant among the confetti and noisemakers used to celebrate the birth of
the New Year on the previous evening.  The boy was found in a lemon
crate, the finder's name was Danny Boodmann (Bill Nunn, Kiss the Girls)
and the year was 1900.  Boodmann decides to raise 1900 as his own son,
and the gritty bowels of the ship becomes the boy's first home.
Boodmann does not, however, utter the line, `Now that's a real shame
when folks be throwin' away a perfectly good white boy like that.'
As he grows older, 1900 begins to sneak around the boat and witnesses
how the other half lives.  He is amazed by their flowing costumes,
dancing, and, most importantly, elegant music.  As 1900 begins some
late-night dabbling with the ship's piano, we learn that he is a musical
prodigy capable of performing the most intricate pieces.  It's not too
long before the ship's ritzy upper crust is treated to 1900's
spectacular musical stylings.
Despite having never left the ship, 1900's reputation as a jazz virtuoso
eventually makes land and before long the genre's inventor, Jelly Roll
Morton (Clarence Williams III, The General's Daughter), comes aboard The
Virginian to challenge 1900 to a piano duel.  Morton is a contentious
prick, insulting 1900 before launching into a fantastically intricate
jazz number that thrills the ship's passengers.  1900 responds with a
sweaty performance that would make David Helfgott proud, resulting in
one the best moments in cinema that you will see this year.
(Incidentally, if the theater doesn't burst into applause at that point,
run  you're in a room full of zombies).  The incident helps to further
the legend of 1900 on the mainland, while he is content to repeatedly
make the trip from London to New York.
1900 eventually relents to the pressure of record executives and records
one song while still aboard The Virginian.  The tune is improvised and
hauntingly beautiful, but 1900 smashes the master to pieces as he can't
bear to have his music go anywhere without him.  The broken record is
found in a music store years later by one of 1900's best friends, Max
(Pruitt Taylor Vince, Mumford), who narrates the entire film to the
disbelieving elderly owner of a New York music store (Peter Vaughan, An
Ideal Husband).  Max is concerned for 1900 as The Virginian, which did
time during World War II as a hospital ship, is scheduled to be
demolished.  He is unsure whether his old friend was able to overcome
his greatest fear and leave the ship.
The Legend of 1900 is based on Italian novelist Alessandro Baricco's
dramatic monologue and adapted for the screen by Oscar-winning director
Guiseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso)  his first in the English
language.  Ennio Morricone (Bulworth) provides a majestic score and
Hungarian Lajos Koltai's photography is simply exquisite.  1900 has
already swept five awards at Italy's version of the Oscars (Tornatore,
Morricone and Koltai, in addition to the production and costume
design).  And we all remember what happened the last time a popular
Italian fable hit our continent, don't we?
As a side note, I can neither confirm nor deny the fact that Steely
Dan's song `Hey Nineteen' was about Tim Roth's character.  I can also
neither confirm nor deny that the name Steely Dan actually refers to
Danny Boodmann, who worked in the bowels of the ship, which were made of
steel.

Review for Whole Nine Yards, The (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Just what we need:  Another film about the mob.  Doesn't anybody realize
that the genre has already been perfected within the last twelve
months?  If you want a mob drama, watch The Sopranos.  If you want a mob
comedy, watch Analyze This.  You can even tell the idea has been
overused when a mob spoof has been made (Mafia!).
The Whole Nine Yards is about a dentist named Nick "Oz" Oseransky
(Matthew Perry, Three To Tango).  He has his own practice and a nice
house in a secluded Montreal neighborhood.  Unfortunately, Oz also has a
bitchy wife named Sophie (Rosanna Arquette, Buffalo '66) with a horrible
accent, a wicked mother and an annoying little dog.  The couple can't
stand each other  Sophie because her husband is worth more dead than
alive, and Oz because his practice is in financial shambles because of
his late father-in-law's creative financing.
One day, a mobster from Chicago moves in across the street from the
Oseranskys.  Despite his claim to be `Jimmy Jones,' Oz recognizes his
new neighbor as Jimmy `the Tulip' Tudeski (Bruce Willis, The Story of
Us), a hit-man-turned-informant that testified against his former
colleagues and moved to Montreal after thumbing his nose at the Federal
Witness Protection program.  When Oz tells Sophie, she demands that he
immediately fly to Chicago to collect a `finder's fee' from a Turkish
crime boss Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak, End of Days).
Unsure that he wants to finger his new neighbor, Oz reluctantly flies to
Chicago, but gets wrapped up in a scheme involving Jimmy, Yanni, $10
million and Jimmy's voluptuous wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge, Dog
Park).  Plans are hatched, double-crosses are set and surprises are
planned, but the whole film reeks of `been there, done that.'  Most of
the attempted jokes that aren't revealed in the trailer mainly revolve
around either the high dentist suicide rate or the fact that the French
put mayonnaise on hamburgers.  We're talking comedic gold here, folks.
If it wasn't for Perry's great timing and delivery, I would have left in
the middle of the film, which is something I haven't done since Willis'
last film, Breakfast of Champions.  The film is a mess and is poorly
edited, as well.  Here's an example of how choppy the film is:  At one
point, Oz is shown leaving the Renaissance in Chicago, except his
character was supposed to have just flown from Chicago to Montreal, and
he was supposed to be exiting a hotel in that Canadian city.  And, of
course, when Oz lands in Chicago, he calls a friend that works at the
Tribune  when was the last time a cinematic character in Chicago didn't
have a friend at the Tribune?  It's unheard of.
The only other redeeming quality of Yards is the performance of Amanda
Peet (Isn't She Great), who plays Oz's assistant Jill.  Don't be
confused  Peet is also on the WB show Jack & Jill, where she plays Jack
(since nobody watches the show, it probably won't be an issue).  But I
can't tell if Peet is a charismatic actress with legitimate comedic
potential, or if I was happy because she showed her boobs for an
extended period of time.
Yards was directed by Jonathan Lynn (Sgt. Bilko) and written by debut
screenwriter Mitchell Kapner, who also penned the upcoming action flick
Romeo Must Die.  The film also stars Michael Duncan Clarke (The Green
Mile) and Harland Williams (Superstar), but I would crawl the whole nine
yards over broken glass to get away from ever having to see this picture
again.

Review for When the Sky Falls (2000)
Hot on the heels of her critically acclaimed performance in The
Contender, Joan Allen stars in When the Sky Falls, a straight-to-cable
biopic about a ballsy investigative reporter who made a name for herself
by fingering several of Dublin's most notorious drug kingpins.  The film
is a true story with fictionalized names based on The Sunday
Independent's Veronica Guerin  the first Irish journalist ever to be
assassinated.
Allen plays Sinead Hamilton, a reporter from the fictitious Sunday
Globe.  Her fearless style and penchant for sniffing out the truth
aggravated the purveyors of organized crime in Ireland but made her a
favorite daughter of Dublin.  The film begins with the slaying of a
character played by Pete Postlethwaite (Among Giants) that I think was
supposed to have been Martin Cahill (whose life was dramatized in the
far superior film The General).  Falls is set over a two-year period in
the mid 90s, where Hamilton's pieces on the country's most notorious
criminals were gobbled up by readers that had grown exceedingly tired of
Dublin's growing drug problems.
Allen does a good job but seems very miscast here.  Her accent shows up
only at the end of each sentence.  The whole martyr thing was a little
too much to take as well, but being a true story, you can't really
complain too loudly about it.  The story of Guerin's real assassination,
while depicted somewhat accurately, is a lot more chilling than in
Falls.  For some reason, the filmmakers left out a call the journalist
made to her home while she was being gunned down.  Patrick Bergin (Eye
of the Beholder) and Liam Cunningham (RKO 281) turn in decent supporting
roles.
Falls was directed by John Mackenzie (The Long Good Friday) and penned
by three debut screenwriters  Ronan Gallagher, Colum McCann and Michael
Sheridan.  Guerin also collaborated on the screenplay in an attempt to
tell the stories that her newspaper wouldn't.  I'm sure she never
envisioned her version ending quite like Falls.  Her death, which
occurred just eight months before Falls began principal photography,
resulted in tough new Irish drug laws and a crackdown that netted 150
criminals.

Title
Review for Deep Blue Sea (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
Offering nothing viewers haven't already seen in much superior films
(The Abyss and Alien, for example), DBS does to Jaws what Mulholland
Falls did to Chinatown  dumbs it down, drags it out, and leaves viewers
as unsatisfied as Rosie O'Donnell when the all-you-can-eat buffet closes
down before she's finished.
The film opens with a shot of four teens enjoying a calm night out on
Daddy's boat.  One of the bikinied beauties accidentally kicks a bottle
of red wine over, spilling it into the dark water, which of course
prompts a shark attack.  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Gary
Oldman say that he didn't care for red wine in Bram Stoker's Dracula?
Why would a shark get all riled up about red wine?  Anyway, the kids are
saved at the last second when the shark is harpooned not once, but twice
by Carter Blake (Thomas Jane, The Thin Red Line), who seems to have
appeared out of nowhere.
It turns out that the shark actually escaped from a genetic testing site
where scientists are hoping to create a cure for Alzheimer's disease.
The company funding the project, understandably alarmed by the AWOL
shark and its Friday night assault, gives its leader, Susan McAlester
(Saffron Burrows, Wing Commander), 48 hours to come up with their
antidote and even assigns Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson, Episode
One) to baby-sit the project in its final hours in a last-ditch attempt
to salvage the price of the company's stock on Monday morning.
Once Susan returns to Aquatica, which was formerly a sub refueling
station used in World War II, almost everybody goes home (a skeleton
crew runs the place on weekends), and those that remain ignore the
impending storm that is rapidly approaching their facility.  Damn it 
that's what the Doppler is there for!  At one point, the tower worker
(Aida Turturro) calls Susan up to the surface for an `emergency' that
turns out not to be a warning about a hurricane, but a surprise birthday
party.  Yay!
In addition to Jane's Blake, other characters are the severely wasted
Stellan Skarsgĺrd (Ronin), the severely annoying Michael Rapaport (TV's
Friends), the severely pixie-ish Jacqueline McKenzie (Angel Baby) and
the surprisingly entertaining LL Cool J (Halloween: H2O) as Dudley, the
cook.  You know a film is in trouble when a rap star, and his parrot
sidekick, are the highlights.
Once the group is trapped within the confines of the station, we learn
that Jackson's Franklin is somewhat of an expert in surviving difficult
situations.  Apparently he lived through a killer avalanche while
mountain climbing in the Alps several years back.  Not being too
familiar with the Alzheimer's project, he at one point loudly questions,
`Just what the hell did you do to those sharks?'  Well, Mace Windu, just
who the hell is reading your scripts?  Didn't you learn to stay away
from crappy underwater pictures after Sphere?
DBS is the writing debut from a trio of screenwriters and is directed by
Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight).  The score is provided by Yes'
Trevor Rabin and the special effects are far from dazzling.  Maybe I
just don't find sharks all that frightening.  It's a shark - we know
what they look like.  It's not like Alien or The Abyss.  They even
showed the stupid thing in the trailer, so how scared can you be when
you see it?  Despite one particular scene that made the entire theater
jump and scream, the film is largely a waste.  (1:56 - R for graphically
dumb shark attacks, for language and for Burrows in bra and panties)

Title
Review for You Can Count on Me (2000)
You would expect a film written and directed by the guy that co-wrote
Analyze This to be a hoot.  Or at least be somewhat comedic in nature.
But Ken Lonergan's directorial debut is a tender drama about the
relationship between a nomadic brother and his unadventurous sister in
upstate New York.  Save the heavy-handed music and the embarrassing
two-hanky ending, You Can Count On Me is one heck of a great film.
Laura Linney (The Truman Show) plays Sammy Prescott, a single mother and
the lending officer at a small bank in Scottsville, New York.  She's
more than a little overprotective of her eight-year-old son Rudy (Rory
Culkinyes, those Culkins), leaving her job each afternoon to transport
her child from the school bus to his babysitter.  The absences from work
don't play well with Sammy's unpleasant new bank manager, Matthew
Broderick (Inspector Gadget).  She's also got a great boyfriend (Jon
Tenney from television's Get Real) that seems ready to commit to a
long-term relationship.
Sammy has a younger brother named Terry (Mark Ruffalo, Ride With the
Devil), who, apparently, has spent his entire adult life as a drifter.
He always makes sure to send his worried sister letter from each stop he
makes (she excitedly reads them and carefully files them away in a
drawer).  Terry's latest correspondence announces he's coming home to
Scottsville for a visit, causing the overjoyed Sammy to nearly spin out
of control with happiness.
But when Terry arrives at Sammy's house, old sibling rivalries are
reheated.  Sammy can't understand Terry's lack of desire for stability
in his life, and he thinks she's too uptight, rigid and set in a life
full of routine.  As much as they don't get along, the two share an
incredible bond  the result of losing both parents in a car crash while
they were both small children.
After a few days in Scottsville, Terry develops a close bond with Rudy,
who has been pining away for a father figure for years.  In the
meantime, Sammy's life begins to become unhinged, dumping her boyfriend
to have a tawdry affair with her married manager (how many more films do
we have to see Broderick having sleazy affairs in seedy hotel rooms, a
la Election?) to Loretta Lynn's `The Other Woman.'  Count is one of
those films where the two main characters slowly begin to take on each
others traits.  Kind of like Simpatico, but nowhere near as awful.
The chemistry between Linney and Ruffalo is amazing.  In fact, it's
almost too good.  I was half expecting a storyline involving incest to
pop up toward the end of the film (independent cinema has taught me to
expect the unexpected).  Lonergan script is fantastic, and his direction
may be even better.  He elects to leave out scenes that you would
typically find pivotal in other films.  In particular, Lonergan doesn't
show the young Sammy and Terry being told of their parents demise.
There is also a great scene where Terry takes Rudy to a pool hall to
make some money off the local yokels, and Lonergan points his camera on
the uncle and nephew for a long shot while their competitor runs the
table.
Executive produced by Martin Scorsese, Count made me wish I had an older
sister.  And I'd have to strongly recommend a film that made me feel
that way.

Review for Flawless (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Too many Hollywood films are based on opposites.  You've got your
Runaway Bride-type romantic swill where hunky guys and pretty girls hate
each other, but then fall in love.  And then there's your 48 Hours-type
action picture where hard-edged cops and fast-talking criminals team up
to catch bad guys.  What we rarely see are effective, more realistic
portrayals of real odd couples.
Flawless is a decent attempt to fill that niche.  It's the story of a
conservative ex-cop that makes an unlikely friend in his transsexual
neighbor.  Their relationship is predictable - they hate each other at
first, but then slowly open up to one another.  Despite the
predictability, their screen interaction is magical, thanks to fantastic
performances by two top acting talents.
The ex-cop is Walt Koontz (Robert De Niro, Analyze This), a decorated
officer living in the same Bed-Stuy neighborhood that served as his beat
when he was on the job.  He's a well-known figurehead in the area and is
on a first-name basis with people he passes on the street each day.  A
very friendly man, except when it comes to his drag queen neighbor.
The queen in question is Rusty Zimmerman (Philip Seymour Hoffman,
Happiness), a beefy female impersonator that lives on the floor above
Walt.  Rusty (which I find to be a damn hysterical name for a
cross-dresser) and his flamboyant friends often rehearse song and dance
numbers in the building, which enrages Walt, who can hear the racket
from his apartment.  The two exchange a barrage of "f" words through
their windows within the film's first five minutes.  To further
accentuate their differences, we see each standing in front of their
bathroom mirrors, Walt applying Brylcreem to his graying temples and
Rusty applying lipstick.
Their situation changes as a result of a late-night robbery in their
building.  Walt hears a gunshot, grabs his piece and tries to stop the
situation, but has a stroke in the process.  Partially paralyzed on his
right side, Walt is too proud and embarrassed to leave his apartment,
missing appointments for physical therapy, which only worsens his
condition.  He struggles to walk and talks like he's got a mouth full of
cole slaw.  Through an odd turn of events, Walt ends up taking singing
lessons from Rusty in an attempt to rehabilitate his speech.
Each scene with De Niro and Hoffman is truly entertaining to watch, even
though Hoffman obviously has the meatier of the two parts.  He's a real
scene-stealer, taking all of the good lines while De Niro is left to
incoherently (literally) mumble like a member of Howard Stern's Wack
Pack.  De Niro's role is overshadowed and thankless and, as a result,
his scenes without Hoffman seem to suck the life out of the film.  To
make matters worse, writer/director Joel Schumacher (8mm) continues to
use the building's robbery as a continuing subplot throughout the film.
It isn't needed.  Flawless would have been much better if it were filmed
as a two-person stage production.  Its biggest flaw is to not increase
the focus on its two stars.

Review for Stille nach dem Schuß, Die (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2000 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
You've got to admire a film that uses the Rolling Stones' "Street
Fighting Man" for its opening credits, and then shows a bank robbery
where the thieves bring baked goods for their victims and boldly
announce their arrival by shouting, "Hello, guys - we're the robbers."
Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there for The Legends of Rita.
The film, which has been nominated for a handful of awards in Europe, is
a fairly interesting look at the political climate of Germany in the
1970s and '80s.  Rita boasts a strong lead performance by an actress
with very little film experience, but, like Bagger Vance's legend, the
picture is kind of dull and pointless.
Bibiana Beglau stars as Rita Vogt, a member of West Germany's Red Army
Faction - the group responsible for the bank robbery in the film's
opening scene.  The RAF's mission is to destabilize capitalism in the
country through any means necessary.  Stealing money from the bank isn't
robbery - it's redistribution of wealth, and Rita gleefully gives a
panhandler a fistful of the loot lifted from the raid.
But Rita is only in the RAF because she has a crush on Andi (Harald
Schrott), one of the group's militant leaders.  Sure, she believes
somewhat in the RAF's mission and, since most of their actions are
non-violent, Rita finds the whole idea of rebellion pretty damn
exciting.  But after a couple of mishaps, she finds herself hiding in
East Germany with a wig and a new - and quite less exciting - identity.
The "Legends" in the title refer to each new identity Rita is forced to
assume (with help from the East German secret police).  In one, she
falls in love with a lifeguard.  In another, she befriends a woman named
Tatjana (Nadja Uhl), who craves a life away from her drab city and
boring factory job and can't understand why Rita is so content.  We're
not talking about exciting stuff here.  Once Rita and her RAF cronies
disband, the film gets awfully boring.  For a while, it seemed like it
could be gearing up for some hot girl-on-girl action, but it never pans
out.
Beglau's performance is good enough to rise above the mess of a story
(think Katarina Witt, but with a gun instead of ice skates).  Director
Volker Schlöndorff (Palmetto) does a decent job recreating the gritty
look of pre-Wall-fall Germany, but his script (which was co-written by
Wolfgang Kohlhaase) really needs to be kicked up a notch or two.  Rita
starts promisingly, like Cecil B. Demented, but ends with all of the
gusto and pizzazz in a round of laundry.

Review for 3000 Miles to Graceland (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
It's late February, and a new film hits the screens in which a character
gets out of jail and meets up with a group of other criminals, led by a
maniacal madman.  They successfully rob a casino, but the two Alpha males
end up butting heads because of the money and a girl.  No, you're not having
a flashback to 2000's Reindeer Games (which was released exactly one year
ago).  The new film is 3000 Miles to Graceland, and it probably would have
been a direct-to-cable release if it weren't for the cast.
Graceland features two male leads that have 15 Razzie nominations between
them.  Kurt Russell (Soldier) plays Michael, a Jersey baddie who has just
been popped from the pokey and is on his way to Las Vegas to meet up with
Murphy (Kevin Costner, Thirteen Days) and his band of miscreants (Christian
Slater, Bokeem Woodbine and David Arquette), who are planning to knock off a
casino.  The heist has been coordinated around "Elvis Week" at the Riveria,
and each of the five men dress like The King to, theoretically, blend into
the background.
But they hardly keep a low profile.  People are still going to notice five
men purposefully marching across a casino floor, whether they're dressed as
Elvis or not.  Punching a guy out probably wouldn't be high on the list of
things to do if you're trying to go undetected, but don't tell that to this
think tank.  They get their loot and also get involved in a big shoot-out
that proves The Brother Rule is in full effect and that guns never need to
be reloaded.
You know right away which character you're supposed to root for after seeing
Murphy carelessly blow away innocent people, while the more gentle, caring
Michael opts to use his brains to avoid violent clashes with police and
casino security.  They get split up, but each knows where the other is
headed, so the rest of the film is kind of a road picture where Michael and
Murphy try to out-con each other to get their hands on the money.  Courteney
Cox (Scream 3) plays a sex-hungry single mom who is either in love with
Michael or just out to get the casino cash (she appears Arquette-less in the
credits).
If you had a black pompadour and long sideburns, and there was a nationwide
manhunt for two men who looked like Elvis, wouldn't you cut your hair and
shave even if you weren't involved in criminal activity?  The thought never
crosses the minds of Michael or Murphy, and that's just one of several
things that don't make sense in Graceland.  The film was helmed by music
video director Demian Lichtenstein, who co-wrote the script with first-timer
Richard Recco.  The technical standout is George Clinton's score, which
isn't really all that great, but compared to the rest of the film it's pure
genius.  Like Payback, Graceland is so needlessly violent, Charlton Heston
would likely turn his head in disgust at the unoriginal, over-the-top
gunplay.  It's violence for the sake of violence, and completely devoid of
style.
Costner, who is like an old, dull Batman villain, has been a much better
(and much cooler) robber in A Perfect World, and Russell has been a better
Elvis (he played The King in John Carpenter's 1979 television movie).  The
best - and most underused - characters were the two federal agents (Thomas
Haden Church and Kevin Pollak) trying to track down Michael and Murphy.  And
don't get me started on former NFL star Howie Long.  The latent homosexual
is only in a handful of scenes, but gives one man an extended hug, sings a
Paul Simon song and, in the coup de grace, grabs Costner from behind and
grunts like a man in love.
If you get queasy during a Lars von Trier film, this one will probably make
you throw up.  Actually, if you've ever even seen a von Trier film,
Graceland will probably make you want to throw up anyway.  And the editing
here makes Michael Bay look like John Sayles.  There's enough smoking in the
film to give you cancer (third-hand smoke?), but there aren't enough
pyrotechnics, bullets or modern rock to spackle the giant holes in the plot.

Review for Runaway Bride (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The scariest film to take place in Maryland this year isn't The Blair
Witch Project  it's the paint-by-numbers re-teaming of Pretty Woman
director Garry Marshall and stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.  Here,
in Marshall's second directorial dud of the year (The Other Sister was
equally unimaginative), Gere's triumphant acting style that made Red
Corner a box office smash remains unchanged, while Roberts conjures up
memories of debacles past, just about erasing any memory of her fine
performance in Notting Hill.
The tired story begins when a jaded USA Today columnist named Ike Graham
(Gere) writes a piece after hearing a barroom tale about a small-town
girl named Maggie Carpenter (Roberts), a woman who purportedly left
seven beaux at the altar by dashing out of the ceremonies `like the
running of the bulls in Pamplona.'  The trouble is that Ike never
checked his source and is immediately canned by Ellie, his
editor-in-chief (and ex-wife) played by Mrs. Tom Hanks/Rita Wilson
(Psycho).  Out of work, Ike is persuaded by Ellie's husband,
photographer Fisher (Hector Elizondo, Chicago Hope, doing his best
impression of `Kristof' from The Truman Show) to actually investigate
the `runaway bride' story in the hopes of selling his narrative to the
highest bidder and, verily, jumpstarting his career.
When Ike arrives in Hale, Maryland, he quickly discovers that Maggie has
only really ditched three grooms on their wedding day, but she is still
the running joke of the town.  Her drunk pop (Paul Dooley, Telling Lies
in America) even aims a few zingers at his only child, adding that
`wedding cake freezes  this we know.'  Ike tries to track Maggie down
at the family hardware store that she runs (Carpenter - hardware store -
get it?), but she's off at the local beauty salon, run by best friend
Peggy (Joan Cusack, In & Out and perennial
funny-enough-to-be-a-sidekick-but-not-attractive-enough-by-Hollywood-standards-to-be-a-romantic-lead.
Why can't her agent find her a script like Muriel's Wedding?).  Maggie
agrees to talk to Ike, but only if she and Peggy can `wash' his hair.
Stupidly, he agrees, and ends up looking like that guy with the rainbow
wig and the `John 3:16' sign that is always at pro football games.  Yup,
we're talking pretty high-brow humor here.
After speaking to most of the townsfolk, Ike learns that Maggie's first
victim is a burnt-out Deadhead who still works in town as a mechanic.
Patsy #2 (Donal Logue) has become the local priest, while the third dupe
is a boozehound in New York City.  Remarkably, there is yet a fourth man
ready to by discarded by galloping Maggie - uni-browed high school
athletic coach Bob (Christopher Meloni from HBO's wonderful OZ).  Now,
I'm not going to say who Maggie eventually marries, but you will
definitely be surprisedif you've never seen a movie before in your
life.  The story is so remarkably predictable that even the
simplest-minded will see the placement of the Hall & Oates song
`Maneater' coming from very far away.
Could the problem be with Marshall's direction?  He hasn't done anything
worthwhile since his television trilogy (Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley
and Mork & Mindy).  Could it be novice screenwriters Sara Parriott,
Josann McGibbon and Audrey Wells?  Could this have come from anywhere
but the minds of three women?  There are a few decent lines, mostly from
Elizondo and Cusack, the latter of whom is so wasted in this role, but
not nearly as misused as Laurie Metcalf (Roseanne) who plays the local
baker for all of about 90 seconds.  I am still amazed that there was so
little packed into a film that ran so long.  Hello, Hollywood?  Romantic
comedies are supposed to be 90 minutes long - 100 if Kevin Smith is
involved.  (1:51 - PG for language and some suggestive dialogue)

Review for Knight's Tale, A (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
A Knight's Tale is a shining example of why you shouldn't listen to rock
stars, because, contrary to what Robert Plant may have taught you, all that
Gary Glitters is not gold.  Plant was probably alive in the 14th century,
which is when Tale is set, but even he'd be shocked by what Brian Helgeland
decided would be a good idea for a summer movie - setting a jousting
tournament to songs that you'd hear blaring from an '86 Camaro full of guys
with perms on their way to pee in the sink at an NFL game after loading up
on Coors Light.
The good news is that nobody sings, but beyond that, you're on your own.
Based loosely on the first story in Chaucer's "The Canterbury Tales," the
film begins just outside a jousting competition, where three peasants are
trying to decide what to do with their keeper, who has just expired as a
result of what we assume to be a jousting-related injury.  Despite the fact
that you need to be of noble descent to participate, William Thatcher (Heath
Ledger, The Patriot) dons the dead man's armor and finishes the tournament,
which features Queen's "We Will Rock You" as the audience claps, stomps and
does The Wave.
When Thatcher wins, he and his two mates - Roland (Mark Addy, Down to Earth)
and Wat (Alan Tudyk, 28 Days) - decide they'll joust for a month to make
some money before going their separate ways.  The trio befriends a naked
forgery expert - subtly named Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) - who provides
phony documents declaring Thatcher to be Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein (who
I'm pretty sure was a drummer for Spinal Tap at one point).
Thatcher proves to be a natural at jousting, a sport that doesn't really
translate into to much excitement on the screen.  While he captures the top
spot in several tournaments, Thatcher makes an enemy of Count Adhemar (Rufus
Sewell, Bless the Child) an undefeated jouster with crossed eyes, at the
same time falling in love with a Lady named Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon).  It
comes as no surprise to learn Adhemar is after the same woman, although it
is a little strange that Thatcher continues to pursue her, when he seems to
be a much better fit with a curvy blacksmith (Laura Fraser, Titus) who gives
him dancing lessons and makes him a new, ultra-light armor (complete with
Nike Swooshes...maybe it's supposed to be A Phil Knight's Tale).  C'mon, Sir
Ulrich - why go after an anorexic Gia-wannabe when you've got a much more
attractive girl sitting right next to you?
Tale's first two hours (yes, it's a 132-minute film about jousting) are all
a set-up for the big showdown between Thatcher and Adhemar at the World
Championships in London, which is somewhat of a homecoming for William as we
learn his origin via kooky childhood flashbacks.  The highlight of the film
comes when Chaucer, who is apparently an early ancestor of Michael Buffer,
introduces Thatcher before each jousting competition.  He's a brilliant,
fast-talking showman for what appears to be the equivalent of the WWF.
Writer/director Helgeland, probably best known for getting the heave-ho from
Mel Gibson after Payback completed filming (as opposed to the Oscar he won
for co-adapting L.A. Confidential), does nothing exciting or original with
the incredibly bland story...unless you count the inclusion of those classic
rock songs.  It's a bad idea that must have sounded as awful on paper as it
comes off on the screen.  Some of the songs make sense in relation to the
goings-on of the characters (like "The Boys Are Back In Town"), but most do
not (like "Low Rider").  The only song that didn't immediately make me slap
my hand to my forehead was Bowie's "Golden Years."

Review for Apocalypse Now (1979)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
When Orson Welles first hit Hollywood, his initial impulse was to turn
Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness into a feature film. He couldn't secure
financing for it and made Citizen Kane instead. 30 years later, Francis Ford
Coppola tried his hand at Darkness, but, like Welles, had money troubles and
ended up adapting The Godfather.  Citizen Kane and The Godfather are widely
considered to be the two greatest films ever made, so following that logic,
all young, aspiring filmmakers should take a crack at Conrad's novella.
Coppola, of course, eventually did make his own version of Darkness, but it
wasn't until amassing a small fortune from the first two Godfather films and
The Conversation.  The '70s were a pretty decent time for ol' Francis,
bookending the decade with a screenwriting Oscar for Patton in 1970 and
eight nominations for 1979's Apocalypse Now (it won for sound and
cinematography but pretty much lost everything else to Kramer vs. Kramer).
22 years later, Now is back in theatres as Apocalypse Now Redux, into which
editor Walter Murch (the restored Touch of Evil) has massaged about 50
minutes of new material (increasing the running time to well over three
hours).  From the opening strains of The Doors' "The End," to the bright
orange napalm explosions, to the ceiling fan that sounds like a helicopter
in the Saigon hotel room of Captain Benjamin L. Willard, it takes about two
minutes to confirm that the restored sound and picture (originally lensed by
Goya in Bordeaux's Vittorio Storaro) were a worthwhile investment.
Willard (Martin Sheen, The West Wing), a recently divorced soldier on his
second tour of Vietnam, is waiting for an assignment to take him back into
The Shit.  But we quickly see Willard has some serious demons, plus a bit of
a paranoid streak, when two MPs arrive to take him to see the General.  He
thinks he's about to be charged with something, but instead, the General
sends him on a unique mission.
It turns out that there is a rogue soldier named Kurtz (Marlon Brando, The
Score) who has worked his way up a winding river into Cambodia and,
somewhere along the way, lost his mind.  Willard's assignment is to take a
PT boat up the river, find Kurtz and "terminate with extreme prejudice."
Willard has concerns.  After all, he's killed plenty of people, but never
another American; never a fellow soldier.  A tall, thin Harrison Ford is in
this scene, and this was way back when he used to try to act, so that's kind
of fun, too.
Willard and his crew - the gruff boat pilot Chief (Albert Hall),
professional surfer Lance Johnson (Sam Bottoms), New Orleans saucier Chef
(Frederic Forrest), and 17-year-old Mr. Clean (played by then 14-year-old
Laurence Fishburne) - set off on a crazy journey that involves, among other
things, surfing, Wagner-blaring helicopters, Playboy Bunnies, waterskiing,
and a hungry tiger.  Coppola nails the surrealism of the war, as well as
showing our society's need to eliminate those who don't fit in.  Kurtz was
an exemplary soldier with unusual but effective methods.  In other words, he
didn't kill in the proper way, becoming dangerous to the greater War cause.
Willard's journey is more like The Odyssey than O Brother, Where Art Thou?
was.  It's all there - the Bunnies are the sirens, and Robert Duvall's
Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore may as well have been wearing an eye patch.
The further upriver Willard goes, the crazier things become, leaving him to
wonder what he'll find at the end.  Think about it - if Kilgore isn't
considered insane, how far gone must Kurtz be?
There are four major additions to Now, some of which are shown (in part) in
Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse, a unsettling documentary
filmed by Coppola's wife, Eleanor.  The first shows Willard bonding with his
crew early in the film, just after the Kilgore incident.  There's a new
scene where Willard trades fuel for two hours with the Bunnies, which are
just one more thing for the American soldier to exploit in Coppola's Man vs.
Nature tale.  The third is a lengthy diversion where Willard stumbles onto a
French plantation that seems totally unaffected by the War, helping give Now
the effect of going backwards in time as the boat goes upriver.  And there's
some additional footage of Kurtz and Willard that, allegedly, helps to
clarify the ending for those of you who didn't get it the first time around.
Are the additions necessary?  Probably not to us, but they were to Coppola,
who originally scrambled to get Now ready for Cannes (it won the Golden
Palm).  If anything, it's an excuse to see the film on the big screen, and
that's good enough for me.

Review for Kiss of the Dragon (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
I didn't think Rush Hour 2 was coming out until August, so imagine my
surprise to see it in theatres in early July.  It wasn't nearly as funny as
the first one, but all of other the important components were there - the
little Asian man who can't talk the English too good, his annoying,
marginally talented sidekick, and a whole bunch of kicking, punching,
gunplay and explosions.  But I think Chris Tucker has contracted that
strange disease that made Michael Jackson white.  And his voice seems to
have gotten a bit lower, too.
What?  That wasn't Tucker and Jackie Chan?  My apologies.
Okay, I've got it now.  The film I saw must have been a re-release of Luc
Besson's The Professional, which is about a lethal killing machine with a
heart of gold who tries to rescue a young, innocent girl from the evil
clutches of a corrupt rogue cop, played by Gary Oldman.  And at the end,
there's a great scene where the good guy storms the police station with no
help and raises all kinds of hell.  Remember?  It was Natalie Portman's
first big film.
Huh?  It wasn't The Professional, either?  But it had Besson's name in the
credits and everything.
Oh, yeah.  It's Kiss of the Dragon, and Besson is only a producer and
screenwriter (rookie Chris Nahon directs).  The good guy isn't Jean Reno,
but rather Romeo Must Die's Jet Li, who came up with the idea for this film
all on his own.  He plays Liu Jian, China's top government agent who, as the
film opens, has embarked on a top-secret mission in Paris.  The French
customs officer asks if he is there for business or pleasure, and Liu
answers, "Pleasure," even though we know he's all business.
Liu's operation involves participating in the protection of some Asian
bigwig in conjunction with the Parisian police, headed by Richard (Tchéky
Karyo, The Patriot).  But it's all a big setup - in an unnecessarily
complicated opening, a murder occurs, and Liu unwittingly becomes Richard's
patsy.  We don't know who the stiff is, or why Liu needed to protect him. We
don't know why Richard wanted to snuff him, either.  So how come everything
is such a big secret?  Because the script is lousy.  The answers to these
questions don't matter one bit, and, therefore, are never answered.
In the meantime, Liu befriends a recovering junkie/whore named Jessica
(Bridget Fonda, Monkeybone), whose young daughter is being held hostage by
Richard, who also happens to be Paris' top pimp.  With her street
connections and his bracelet full of acupuncture needles, the two form an
unstoppable pair.  Yeah, I said acupuncture needles.  Liu uses them to
incapacitate his enemies.  Seriously.
Although everything takes place against a lovely Parisian backdrop (which is
nicely shot by Besson's cinematographer Thierry Arbogast), most of Dragon is
laughably bad.  Like Romeo, Li's action sequences are so choppy, you can't
tell what he's doing (as opposed to Jackie Chan's films).  If you edit a
scene enough, you could make Walter Matthau look like a black belt.  Karyo
has fun chewing up the scenery, but he's yet another one of this summer's
non-threatening bad guys.  He's French - how scary can he be?  And Fonda,
the kiss of death for any prospective hit, simply takes up space.
Ironically, she starred in Point of No Return, the American remake of
Besson's Le Femme Nikita.

Review for Road to El Dorado, The (2000)
Dreamworks' latest foray into animation is the result of an interesting
idea.  Jeffrey Katzenberg and company decided to take the best aspect of
recently successful animated films  the wisecracking sidekick  and
build a film around this scene-stealing cut-up.  And just to drive the
hilarity home, the writers used two of these class clowns as the main
characters in The Road to El Dorado.  I can picture well-dressed
executives greedily rubbing their hands together while visualizing
coffers full of doubloons at the mere thought of a film with two hammy
leads.  Think of how great a movie would be with Eddie Murphy's Mushu
(from Mulan) and Danny DeVito's Philoctetes (from Hercules) as the two
main characters.
Okay, El Dorado isn't that great.  The two leads (Kevin Kline and
Kenneth Branagh) are funny, but not over-the-top enough to ruin the
film.  The slick animation is on par with Dreamworks' last traditionally
animated film, The Prince of Egypt, but the story is much more formulaic
than its predecessor.  And to top things off, the sidekick in El Dorado
still steals the show.
El Dorado begins in 1519 Spain, where soon-to-be-legendary explorer
Cortes (Jim Cummings, the voice of Tigger and Winnie the Pooh in The
Tigger Movie) is about to set sail for the New World, which he intends
to conquer for Spain.  In addition, Cortes plans to find and plunder El
Dorado, the legendary City of Gold.  He's a big meanie and points out
that his crew was selected more carefully `than Christ's apostles.'
Imagine that job interview.
Meanwhile, two lightweight hoodwinks - Miguel and Tulio (Kenneth Branagh
and Kevin Kline from Wild Wild West) - shoot craps with loaded dice in a
crowded Spanish alley.  Like Jack Dawson in Titanic, they win an unusual
pot that includes a map to the City of Gold.  Before long their
deception is discovered and, during their escape, the two men
accidentally end up on Cortes' ship.  Before they can escape, the ship
is already well into its voyage across the Atlantic.  With the help of
Altivo, Cortes' faithful horse, Miguel and Tulio manage to procure a
rowboat and steal away in the darkness of night.  With the horse.
After rowing around in circles for days, the trio finally reaches terra
firma.  Of course, the particular spot they land on is the precise
location that corresponds to the start point on the map to the City of
Gold.  So Miguel, Tulio and Altivo make their way through the jungle and
mountains and eventually find the city, which is run by the typical
friendly fat guy (Edward James Olmos, Selena) whose second-in-command is
the typical evil skinny guy that wants to be in charge (Armand Assante,
The Odyssey).
Thanks to an ancient legend and a healthy dose of dumb luck, the people
of El Dorado mistake Miguel and Tulio for gods.  The men want to stay
just long enough to pilfer all the gold they can carry from the trusting
inhabitants, and are able to fit in with the help of a local con woman
that looks like a porn star (Rosie Perez, It Could Happen To You).  Even
though they have to hit the road before Cortes and his men find the
city, Miguel and Tulio have a hard time leaving their new luxurious
lifestyle.
If El Dorado seems more Disney-ish to you than Egypt did, it's because
most of the filmmakers here were pilfered from the Mouse House.  The
film's three directors (Robert `Bibo' Bergeron, Will Finn and Don Paul)
worked on A Goofy Movie, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas,
respectively.  The music in El Dorado comes from the writing team
responsible for The Lion King, and features five new songs performed by
Sir Elton John.  There's also one of those Disney animating secrets that
animates - I swear to God - a bull with a nutsack the size of Rhode
Island.  If you don't see it, wait for the DVD.
The voice work is fine all around.  Kline and Branagh sound like they
had a great time working on this project, and Perez's voice isn't the
screeching nasal nightmare you're used to hearing.  She's much more
restrained and, as a result, her voice is quiet and  gulp  almost
soothing.
Now there's something I never thought I would say.

Title
Review for Toy Story 2 (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Pixar's follow-up to 1995's hugely successful Toy Story is another
whopping cinematic victory, guaranteed to garner critical raves and
still make money hand-over-fist while packing theaters through this
holiday season.  The original, the third-highest-grossing animated film
ever (behind The Lion King and Aladdin) and the first full-length
computer-generated movie, made almost $200 million during its theatrical
run, catching Hollywood a bit off-guard.  This sequel even pokes fun at
the fact that unaware toy stores didn't stock enough of the film's
action figures the first time around.
For the few people that haven't seen the first film, it focused on a
group of toys owned by a six-year-old tyke named Andy Davis (voiced by
John Morris).  His favorite toy, a cowboy doll named Woody (Tom Hanks,
You've Got Mail), faced his greatest fear when Andy received a shiny new
Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen, Home Improvement) doll for his birthday.  A
jealous Woody hatched a plan to get rid of his cocky rival, but it
backfired, leaving the cowboy and his toy cohorts to perform a daring
rescue mission to return Buzz to their master.
Here, Woody, Buzz and the other toys all get along nicely, even playing
with Andy's dog, Buster, whom he received as a Christmas gift in Toy
Story's final scene.  As the film opens, we learn that Andy is about to
leave for Cowboy Camp and plans to take his trusty pal Woody along.  But
right before they leave, Woody's arm is partially torn, which not only
results in Andy leaving him behind, but also in his mother (Laurie
Metcalf, The Norm Show) relegating the damaged toy to a dusty shelf.
The ledge appears to be a home to toys that Andy has either grown out of
or has broken.
Long story short, Woody is taken by an unscrupulous toy collector (Wayne
Knight, Seinfeld), courtesy of Mrs. Davis' yard sale.  The graying,
balding pudge named Al recognizes Woody as a rare toy in near perfect
condition and plans to sell his find to a Japanese museum along with
three other figures he has previously collected from the `Woody's
Roundup' set - Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack, Arlington Road), Stinky
Pete the prospector (Kelsey Grammer, Frasier), and Bullseye the horse
(David Ogden Stiers, Two Guys, a Girl & a Pizza Place).
Having no idea that he was so valuable, a pragmatic Woody is faced with
the inevitable fact that Andy is growing older and will, at some point,
stop playing with toys.  He has to decide whether to go back to Andy and
the other toys, or lead a boring life of virtual immortality from a
glass case.  Plus, Woody has to factor in the guilt aspect  if he
ditches Jessie, Pete and Bullseye, they'll end up packed away in storage
boxes indefinitely, until Al can find another Woody-clone to complete
his sale.
Like the original film, Toy Story 2 is visually stunning, with CG images
so true-to-life that you can easily forget that you aren't watching a
live-action movie.  It features better and more realistic action
sequences than most films.  And like its predecessors (Toy Story and A
Bug's Life), this sequel seems to offer more jokes for adults than kids,
spoofing Jurassic Park and Star Wars, among others. In fact, I'm not
even sure that kids will grasp the whole concept of collecting old toys,
or appreciate Al's videotapes of the hokey 50s television show that
featured Woody and his pals.
Created by the same team of writers and directors that made both Toy
Story and A Bug's Life, this new film seems to be filled with more
emotional moments than either of its predecessors.  The conflict Woody
feels is more real than what we're used to seeing in films, and there is
also an oddly effective Sarah MacLachlan song (her second weepy number
this month after Anywhere But Here) about Jessie's former owner ditching
the cowgirl for a life of makeup and boys.  Again, this will likely be
more effective for adults than children.  And, after Pokémon, is that
such a bad thing?

Title
Review for Meet the Parents (2000)
Based on a 75-minute short from 1992, Meet the Parents is an
entertaining look at the harrowing experience of meeting your
girlfriend's father for the first time.  Or, if you're a girl, the
equally harrowing experience of having your boyfriend meet your father
for the first time.  It's certainly enjoyable, but the film would have
been a lot more so if the majority of the funny bits weren't given away
in the trailer.
Ben Stiller (Keeping the Faith) plays Greg Focker, an E.R. nurse from
Chicago who is head-over-heels in love with a schoolteacher named Pam
Byrnes (Teri Polo, Felicity).  Parents begins with Greg rehearsing the
marriage proposal to his beloved, but when the time comes, the special
moment is interrupted by a phone call from Pam's sister, Debbie.  She
announces that she's engaged and will be married in two weeks, but the
best part of all is that her future husband had the good sense to ask
for her father's permission first.
A quick thinker, Greg palms the engagement ring he was about to give to
Pam, and the two take off for Oyster Bay, Long Island, the location of
Debbie's wedding and the home of Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro,
The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle and Blythe Danner, Forces of
Nature).  Greg plans on winning over Pam's dad and getting the green
light to pop the question to his eldest daughter.
But things immediately begin to spin out of control for poor Greg.
First the airline loses his luggage.  Then Pam tells him that he's not
allowed to smoke in front of her dad (it's a sign of weakness).  The big
surprise comes when Greg meets Jack for the first time.  Despite the
fact that he's a cat-loving, poetry-writing, Peter-Paul-and-Mary-singing
old man that uses baby talk to communicate with Pam (he calls her
`Pam-cakes'), Jack instantly becomes suspicious of his potential
son-in-law.  He makes fun of Greg's name and his occupation within
minutes of his arrival.
To make matters worse, Pam's ex-fiancé (Owen Wilson, Shanghai Noon) is
the best man at Debbie's wedding.  But things take an even more
disturbing turn for Greg when he finds out that Jack isn't really a
retired florist but an ex-CIA agent with the uncanny ability to tell if
people are lying (this is also revealed in the trailer).  Greg is like a
car stuck in the mud  the harder he spins his tires to get free from
Jack's bad side, the deeper he makes his hole.
Greg commits one hysterical social faux pas after another, ultimately
ruining Debbie's wedding.  There are a lot of well-timed set-pieces, but
the real charm of the film comes from the relationship between Greg and
Jack; the former looking like a deer caught in the headlights, the
latter giving disapproving looks with a perpetually cocked head.
It's hard to imagine anybody but Stiller playing Greg, and only
Christopher Walken could have played DeNiro's role better, and that
would have been a little too frightening.  There is also a very funny
running gag involving Greg's last name (pronounced like it's spelled).
You have to wonder what the MPAA thought about lines like `Jesus,
Focker,' and `Didn't you, Focker?' when a PG-13 movie is only allowed to
use the F-word once.
Parents was directed by Jay Roach (Austin Powers) and written by James
Herzfeld (Meet the Deedles) and John Hamburg (Safe Men), who based their
script on the short created by Greg Glienna (who played Greg in the
original) and Mary Ruth Clarke.  The film starts to drag as it
approaches the finale, and the ending is completely predictable.
Despite this, and the fact that the trailer gave too much away, the film
is still very fun and very entertaining.
1:40  PG-13 for sexual content, drug references and adult language

Review for Gouttes d'eau sur pierres brűlantes (1999)
Based on a Rainer Werner Fassbinder play, Water Drops on Burning Rocks
is the directorial debut of François Ozon, the reigning bad boy of
French cinema.  The film centers on the relationship between middle-aged
Léopold (Bernard Giraudeau) and twenty-something Franz (Malik Zidi).
Their affair begins torridly, but quickly turns dull and routine, with
Franz basically becoming Léopold's houseboy.
Just a Franz appears to be ready to check out of the relationship, the
situation gets complicated by the arrival of his curvy, sex-starved
ex-fiancée (Ludivine Sagnier), who arrives just before Léopold's
ex-lover  a man who became a woman to please her former boyfriend (Anna
Levine).  Hilarity, tragedy and a bizarre dance number ensue in this
well-executed film debut.
1:30  R for nudity, sexual content, adult language and violence

Review for Chocolat (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2000 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
So my cousin asks me what the movie Chocolat is about, and I tell him,
"Some woman opens a chocolate shop and everybody in town falls in love
with both her delicious concoctions, as well as each other."  Then my
cousin muses, "So it's like that movie with Buffy," referring to the
beyond-awful Sarah Michelle Gellar film, Simply Irresistible, which
shares a similar theme with Chocolat.
After the dry heaving stopped, I stepped into the theatre and was
greatly relieved to find Chocolat wasn't anywhere near as bad as
Irresistible, or the equally unpleasant and more recent Woman on Top.
If you head for the theatre expecting to find a wonderful film about
food preparation and consumption (like Big Night) or a romantic movie
that focuses on food as a tool of seduction (Like Water for Chocolate),
you might go home disappointed.  A light, crowd-pleaser with
above-average acting and a predictable ending, Chocolat lands somewhere
between the wide gap created by Irresistible and Night - thankfully
landing a bit closer to the latter than the former.
The film is set in 1959 in the tiny French town of Lansquenet, a hamlet
populated by a flock of conservative bible-thumpers that would sooner
lose a limb than miss a mass.  And when Vianne (Juliette Binoche, The
English Patient) and her daughter Anouk (Victorie Thivisol, Ponette)
stroll into Lansquenet, the whole town is in the midst of Sunday
sermon.  Vianne rents a pastry shop from a dour old woman named Armande
(Dame Judi Dench, Tea With Mussolini), the only Lansquenet resident who
refuses to go to church.
Vianne turns the storefront into a chocolate shop, but makes the mistake
of having its grand opening just as Lent begins.  As if that wasn't
enough to piss off the locals, Lansquenet's mayor, Comte de Reynaud
(Alfred Molina, Magnolia), gets everyone even more riled when he finds
out that Vianne is both a single mother and an atheist (the horror!).
It's all too much for the town to handle and, as a result, the shop
doesn't get much business despite Vianne's uncanny ability to pick the
right sugary morsel to suit everyone she encounters.
In fact, the only customers Vianne gets at first are her landlord and a
shoplifter named Josephine (Lena Olin, The Ninth Gate) who eventually
escapes her loveless marriage to Lansquenet's café owner (Peter
Stormare, Dancer in the Dark) to become Vianne's assistant (a pretty
dumb development).  Both Armande and Josephine supply Chocolat with the
necessary plots to keep the film from just being about a candy store.
In case that isn't enough to interest you, Vianne gets a love interest
in the form of a guitar-playing, Irish gypsy (Olin's Gate costar, Johnny
Depp) who doesn't show up until an hour into the film.
With the exception of Depp's disappearance, which occurs about 20
minutes after he first appears (not bad for somebody who gets their mug
plastered on the film's poster), Chocolat is fairly predictable.  The
film is sparsely narrated, which makes it seem like it was added as an
afterthought.  There's also an awkward flashback that shows how Vianne's
family discovered the secret of chocolate.  All of the laughs (and I
mean all of them) come at the expense of the church, and most involve
Lansquenet's new, wide-eyed priest (Hugh O'Connor), who has trouble
dealing with the puritanical Mayor and his unexplainable anger toward
Vianne.
Binoche delivers a one-note performance and is outperformed by most of
Chocolat's supporting cast (especially Dench).  Thivisol, who was so
stunning in Ponette, has little to do but prattle on about her imaginary
kangaroo friend.  Depp's Irish brogue is impeccable but, unfortunately,
he doesn't get to stick around long enough to leave any kind of mark on
the film.
Based on Joanne Harris's novel of the same name, Chocolat is a bit of a
disappointment following the success of director Lasse Hallström's last
film, The Cider House Rules.  Something could have been lost in the
adaptation from Harris' story, as Chocolat's screenwriter's (Robert
Nelson Jacobs) only two other credits are the less-than-stellar Dinosaur
and Out to Sea.  Although Hallström packs the film with great acting
talent, a decent score (Cider House's Rachel Portman) and warm
photography (Roger Pratt, The End of the Affair), Chocolat is not unlike
eating a fistful of Vianne's creations:  They taste great on the way
down, but give you a bit of a stomach ache after you've finished.
1:56  PG-13 for a scene of sensuality and some violence

Review for Drôle de Félix (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau, the creators of everyone's favorite
AIDS-themed musical, Jeanne and the Perfect Guy, are back with the decidedly
non-musical The Adventures of Felix, the tale of a young, gay Arab traveling
from Normandy to Marseilles to meet the father he never knew.  It's a
typical arthouse road-trip flick, in that nothing exciting happens and,
despite his fear of being beaten because of his race and sexual preference,
everyone Felix meets is nice, helpful and unbelievably tolerant.  While
that's the kind of thing you'd like to see in everyday society, it doesn't
make for a very thrilling motion picture.
Felix (Sami Bouajila) has just been laid off as the film opens.  He has also
come across some letters written by his father to his recently deceased
mother.  The return address is from Marseilles, so Felix decides to track
down his dad, intending to hitchhike the back roads the entire five-day trip
(culminating on Father's Day, no less), at which point he will meet his
live-in boyfriend, Fabian Barthez-wannabe Daniel (Pierre-Loup Rajot), for a
vacation.  He doesn't pack much, but does take a subtle rainbow-colored
kite.
Felix meets a different traveler every day (and every 20 minutes in
film-time - you can set your watch to it), and each becomes somewhat of a
temporary family member to him.  The different segments have titles like "My
Little Brother" and "My Grandmother," so that you can tell who is playing
which role.  The titles are a help when Felix has sex with the person we're
told is his "Cousin."  I mean, it could be a second cousin, right?  There's
nothing wrong with that.
While each of the travelers helps Felix in his journey to Marseilles, they
also use him for something as well, whether it's moving furniture or
babysitting.  And every morning, no matter who he wakes up next to, Felix
flicks on the television to watch his favorite soap opera while he downs his
daily cocktail of AIDS-fighting drugs.  And then the closing credits rolled
and I went home.

Review for Simple Plan, A (1998)
Scott B. Smith adapted his best-selling novel for the screen and the
result, A Simple Plan, is not only one of the best films of the year,
but also a dark-horse candidate for a Best Picture nomination.
Hauntingly beautiful and brutally horrifying, the final reel creates a
level of tension (equaled this year only by David Mamet's The
Spanish Prisoner) that would have knocked Hitchcock's socks off.
Sam Raimi (The Quick and the Dead) directs this powerful tale of two
brothers who, together with a friend, find "the American Dream" - $4.4
million inside a plane that crashed in a wildlife preserve near their
home. Like an incident played out earlier this year in Very Bad
Things, a group of ordinary men put into an extraordinary situation
ask themselves, "What if we don't call the police?"
Hank's (Bill Paxton) first reaction is to go to the
authorities. Who could blame him? Of the three, he has the most to
lose. A respected member of the community and college graduate, Hank
is the only one with a job  a dead-end position at the local feed
and grain mill  and his lovely young librarian wife, Sarah
(Bridget Fonda), is expecting their first child in a few days. But
older sibling Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton) and his friend Lou, two
unemployed dimwits that vie for the coveted title of "town drunk,"
finally talk the reluctant Hank into keeping the loot.
Jacob and Lou's plan is a simple one  hold on to the money,
wait until the spring and see if anyone comes looking for it once the
plane is discovered. Hank agrees, but under the conditions that they
keep it a secret and he retain the money in the interim. Hank also
threatens to burn it all if he gets the slightest inkling that the
authorities are on to him.
Of course, Hank tells Sarah as soon as he gets home, and the next
morning she suggests a way to enhance the plan. She thinks that Hank
should take $500,000 back to the plane so that whoever finds it in the
spring won't believe anybody else had been there. And he can't
tell Jacob because he would probably re-steal the $500,000 on his
own. Sarah tells her husband in an almost morose tone, "We'll have
to be careful. That's how we'll have to be from now on."
Needless to say, this greed causes things to spin out of control very
quickly and very horribly. Again, like in Very Bad Things, the picture
shows that the true nature of man is to do anything to cover his/her
own ass in an all-out attempt to grab whatever you can get your hands
on. At one point, Sarah tries to comfort Hank by telling him, "Nobody
would ever believe you're capable of doing what you've done."
Now that's a supportive wife, huh?
Strangely, the true conscience of A Simple Plan is Jacob. The weight
of the big score and the resulting lying, cheating and murder has all
but crushed any remaining spirit that faintly flickered within
him. Completely drained, Jacob asks his younger brother in a
particularly moving scene, "Do you ever feel evil?" He doesn't
answer. He doesn't have to.
A Simple Plan is a virtually flawless film. The acting is first-class
 Paxton (Mighty Joe Young) has never been better and the nearly
unrecognizable Thornton (Armageddon) is all but guaranteed an Oscar
nomination (as is Smith's screenplay). Danny Elfman's creepy
score is perfect and Raimi's direction is also one of the year's
best, bringing to mind the previous snowy success of Fargo. In fact,
the Coen brothers worked on Raimi's first feature (1983's Evil
Dead) and aided him with tips on how to shoot this film's bleak
snow scenes properly. Raimi also effectively blends settings together
with clips of a fox ravaging a hen house.
Unnerving, almost to the point of viewer discomfort, A Simple Plan is
a brilliant example of what a modern thriller should be  dark,
drab and, most importantly, not Virus.

Review for Lengua de las mariposas, La (1999)
I'm generally pretty bored with films that are described as `coming of
age' pictures.  Words like `moving,' `touching,' and `emotional' are
usually thrown in for good measure, and each seems like a red flag for
both sappy content and predictable, linear stories.
Thankfully, José Luis Cuerda's The Butterfly is still an exceptionally
enjoyable film, despite being all of the things listed above.  The film
is about the relationship between a young boy and his teacher, and it's
set in mid-30s Spain during the country's transition from a monarchy to
a republic.
Moncho (Manuel Lozano, in his film debut) is a young boy who has been
taught at home by his tailor father Ramón (Gonzalo M. Uriarte) because
he's asthmatic.  On the eve of his first day of public school, Moncho's
older brother Andrés (Alexis de los Santos, also in his debut) horrifies
the young boy with tales of the beatings he's taken from his teachers
over the years.  So it's no surprise when Moncho pisses his pants the
following morning, just because his old, craggy teacher, Don Gregorio
(Fernando Fernán Gómez, The Grandfather), asked him what his name was.
Of course, Don Gregorio turns out to be a really nice guy.  He and
Moncho form a special bond (but not like the usual kind between priests
and young boys, or even Boy Scout leaders and young boys), and both
share an interest in nature.  At first I was worried, because the last
old Don that hung around outside this much keeled over in a tomato
garden with an orange in his mouth.  But nothing like that happens
here.  Don Gregorio is an old softie and appears to be the first hippie
teacher - a precursor to the tie-dyed David van Dreesen from Beavis &
Butt-Head.
The rest of The Butterfly is rife with the undercurrent of Spain's
political upheaval, and there are subplots involving Andrés' invitation
to play the saxophone with a touring band and the town whore.  The film
is actually based on three short stories written by Manuel Rivas in "Que
Me Quieres, Amor' and was adapted by Rafael Azcona.
In addition to being beautifully photographed by Javier G. Salmones
(Twice Upon A Yesterday), The Butterfly features terrific performances
by the young first-timer Uriarte and the rubber-faced Gómez, the latter
of whom could pass himself off as the Spanish Walter Matthau.  Directed
by José Luis Cuerda, The Butterfly was nominated for thirteen Goya
Awards (the Spanish equivalent of the Oscar).  It only took home one
trophy (for Best Screenplay) but would have swept everything if it
weren't for a little film called All About My Mother.
Previously titled The Butterfly's Tongue (taken from the Spanish title
La Lengua de las Mariposas), The Butterfly might seem like something you
may want to expose your kids to, what with the cool combination of
uplifting story and political education.  But parents, beware: The film
has a pretty graphic sex scene, features perky schoolgirls swimming
without tops and, for good measure, even throws in a scene where a dog
is cooked on a spit.  I screened the film as part of the Cleveland
International Film Festival and saw some poor mother ushering her kid
out of the theatre during all of the parts that could permanently scar
the impressionable brain of her child.  She must have been pretty tired
when the credits finally rolled.

Review for Perfect Storm, The (2000)
The 2000 summer movie season is just about half over and, so far, the
big action blockbusters that seemed the most promising when we were all
still wearing hats and mittens have really let us down.  M:I-2?  Forget
about it.  Gone in 60 Seconds?  Plot holes bigger than the Grand
Canyon.  And you can chalk this one right up there with the others.  The
Perfect Storm is the perfect bore and, although it's only a two-hour
film, it seems like a three-hour tour.  A three-hour tour.
That's not to say that the film adaptation of Sebastian Junger's
best-seller about the fate of the Andrea Gail isn't without merit.  The
effects are, at times, pretty good, and the acting is, for the most
part, solid and well-cast.  But I had problems with Storm right from the
opening credits, which are displayed over a monument to those that have
died at sea in and around Gloucester, Massachusetts, where the film
takes place.  If you didn't know the ending before you walked into the
theatre, the whole thing is ruined for you two minutes into the film.
Storm re-teams Three Kings co-stars George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg -
the former playing sword-boat skipper Billy Tyne to the latter's little
buddy named Bobby Shatford (Clooney and Wahlberg are trying to be the
Hepburn and Tracy of the new millennium).  The film opens in the fall of
1991, where Tyne and his crew have just returned from the latest in what
we learn is a long string of unsuccessful fishing expeditions.  Because
of their light load, each earns a lot less money than they had
expected.  The cash is doled out by Andrea Gail owner Bobby Brown
(Michael Ironside, The Omega Code), who is so unlikeable that they might
as well have given him an eye-patch and a peg-leg.
Believing that there's a lot of fish out there somewhere, Tyne
reassembles his reluctant crew for one last run.  Tyne guarantees them a
huge haul and tons of money, both of which he plans on accomplishing by
venturing further into the ocean than these fishermen usually go.  So
they kiss their wives/girlfriends goodbye, pack up the provisions, and
head for the Flemish Cap, which sounds like something that might be worn
in an Adam Sandler film, or perhaps a European contraceptive device.
What they encounter, of course, is the storm of the century, as Category
5 Hurricane Grace meets up with a bunch of Canadian cold fronts right on
top of the Andrea Gail.  There are two-hundred-mile-an-hour winds and
hundred-foot waves.  But if you're thinking that the film is going to be
an edge-of-your-seat adventure, you might want to show up late because
it takes well over an hour before the water even starts to get a little
bit choppy.
In addition to the monotonous waves that grow more and more tiresome,
Storm's shots are so tight on the action and so logged with water spray
that you can barely tell up from down.  Director Wolfgang Petersen (Air
Force One) and Oscar-winning cinematographer John Seale (The Talented
Mr. Ripley) don't offer much more than dark and wet.  Yes, I understand
that the real Andrea Gail was probably very dark and very wet, but that
doesn't mean that the film had to recreate the look and feel to the
point that it is here.  You might as well watch wearing a blindfold.
Although based on real people, I found the supporting roles to be little
more than typical stock characters.  There's the jaded and grizzled
captain  (Clooney), the eager young kid with an attractive girlfriend
(Wahlberg), the bitter divorced guy (John C. Reilly, Magnolia), the
rat-faced loser  (John Hawkes, Blue Streak), the down-and-out unemployed
guy (William Fichtner, Drowning Mona) and the black guy that hardly has
any screen time (Allen Payne, A Price Above Rubies).  For a while, I was
sure he'd be the first one bumped off, but the `Brother Rule' doesn't
apply to Storm.  It's also funny to think about the years and years that
Wahlberg has probably spent with a dialect coach in an attempt to cover
up his natural South Boston accent, only to drag it out of the closet
here.
Also annoying is the performance of the usually dependable Diane Lane
(My Dog Skip), who plays Shatford's girlfriend.  She probably has
underwear older than Walhberg, and she gets to toss in the time-honored
`I have a bad feeling about this trip' line before the ship sets sail.
Yeah, and you see dead people, too.  Storm also wastes a ton of time on
the fate of three other people trapped in the storm on a separate,
smaller craft and their attempted rescue by a Coast Guard helicopter.
The tug-at-your-heart score comes compliments of James Horner (Titanic),
who they must trot out for every water-themed action/drama film.

Title
Review for Wedding Planner, The (2001)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Prepare yourself for the Jennifer Lopez media onslaught. Her new record
is due in stores just three days before her latest film debuts in
theatres, and it probably won't be long before Puff Mommy is on Court TV
testifying in boyfriend P. Diddy's trial for gun possession, bribery and
the inability to create his own music. Since the entertainer has gone
from critical praise for Out of Sight to tepid box office returns for
The Cell to, well, being Puffy's bagman, you might be asking yourself,
"How low can J Lo go?"
The answer is The Wedding Planner, an inane romantic comedy that makes
you wonder if the Writers Guild hasn't already gone on strike. Lopez
plays Mary, a successful, no-nonsense wedding planner who oversees
expensive ceremonies and lavishly detailed receptions like a finely
tuned military maneuver. Mary is good at what she does, donning a
headset and watching the ceremony from a monitor like a television
producer, and she's got a belt with enough gadgets to make Batman's
tights fall down.
While she carefully plans memorable, romantic days for happy young
couples, Mary's own love life is at a standstill. She was ditched at the
altar several years ago and hasn't had a date in over two years. To make
matters worse, her Italian father (Alex Rocco) keeps trying to fix her
up with a young man from the Old Country (Justin Chambers, Liberty
Heights). All in all, it's a pretty sad state of affairs for a woman to
used to plan extravagant weddings for Barbie and Ken as a girl. Like she
says, "Those who can't wed, plan."
But things start to become brighter for Mary. She lands the big wedding
fish in Fran Donolly (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, Beautiful), an affluent
woman about to get hitched in a money-is-no-object wedding to end all
weddings. And she falls head over heels for a pediatrician at a local
children's hospital (Matthew McConaughey, U-571), too. Everything is
coming up roses for Mary, at least until she finds out her dreamboat is
engaged to Fran.
Planner, written by debut scribe Pamela Falk and Little Voice editor
Michael Ellis, invents all kinds of ridiculous ways to get the two of
them alone together, but nothing remotely interesting or comedic. A
scene where she measured his inseam at a tuxedo fitting would have been
a step in the right direction, but you won't find anything that
entertaining here.  Director Adam Shankman instead chooses to fill the
film full of sappy music. For the record, this is Shankman's feature
film directorial debut, but he was a choreographer on some of the worst
movies made in the last few years (Isn't She Great, Dudley Do-Right,
Inspector Gadget, The Out of Towners).
The final scene shows how fiercely these filmmakers are committed to
putting a quality product on the screen. It's supposed to be June in San
Francisco (home of bad wedding films - see The Bachelor for more proof)
but you can see the icy breath coming out of Lopez and McConaughey. The
scene also abruptly shifts from the sunny mid-afternoon to the dark
evening, simply to force the characters back into the setting in which
they fell in love. Now that's romantic.
Just in case you've recently suffered a stroke, or taken a sharp blow to
the base of your skull and can't figure out how a movie like this ends,
they give the whole thing away in the trailer. If you've seen it,
there's absolutely no reason you need to see the film. Save your money
for J Lo's new record instead. Her acting is probably better in the
liner notes.

Review for Liberty Heights (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Much like Oliver Stone can't quite seem to get his head out of the 60s,
director Barry Levinson (Wag the Dog) keeps returning to 1950s
Baltimore.  This city and period of time has already served as the
setting for three of his films - Diner, Tin Men and Avalon  not to
mention Levinson's television drama Homicide, although that was set in
present-day Baltimore.  What would make a person focus that much
attention on one specific era?  Who cares?  Between the two directors,
almost a dozen films in as many years that focus on either 50s
Baltimore or the turbulent 60s have been made.  And for the most part,
these movies have been spectacular, combining to win seven Oscars out of
the thirty-two nominations they have received.
While Stone hit a stumbling block with 1993's Heaven & Earth, he
rebounded the following year with Natural Born Killers, perhaps
realizing that it was time for a change.  But not Levinson.  With last
year's debacle Sphere under his belt, he returns to 50s Baltimore for
yet another touching, semi-autobiographical tale of a middle-class
Jewish family.  Oy vey!  Granted, Liberty Heights isn't anywhere near as
malodorous as Sphere, but the film sure ain't no Avalon.
Set in 1954, Heights' central focus is on the Kurtzman family.  They
live in the northwest section of the city, known as Liberty Heights, in
a time marred by both McCarthyism and racism.  The main character is Ben
(Ben Foster), a high school senior who also narrates the film.  He
explains at the film's beginning that his entire neighborhood consisted
of Jews and, as a result, he always assumed as a young boy that the
whole world was Jewish.  His first experience of `the other kind' (as
his mother referred to gentiles) was at a friend's house during an
awkward lunch that consisted of white bread and luncheon meats, both
mysterious foods to the lad.
Heights basically consists of three stories.  The first follows Ben's
blossoming friendship with a black girl named Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson)
in his homeroom class at his recently segregated school.  Both kids know
that a potential romantic relationship would be damned by both of their
families, not to mention society, but they continue to secretly see each
other.
The second story involves Ben's father Nate (Joe Mantegna, The Rat
Pack), who runs numbers as well as a failing burlesque theater
downtown.  Nate is forced to deal with the threat of a state lottery,
which would kill his racketeering business.  He also is forced to do
some creative financing after an up-and-coming dope pusher named Little
Melvin (Orlando Jones, Mad TV) hits his number on a $50 bet.
Heights' third and most unnecessary story concerns Ben's older brother
Van (Adrien Brody, Summer of Sam) as he tries to fit in with the gentile
crowd to win the affections of an icy WASP princess (model Carolyn
Murphy) during a Halloween party.  The girl, Dubbie, already has a
smarmy beau with a penchant for drinking and driving, but Van doesn't
know this until later on in the film.  Levinson makes every gentile seem
just as evil as the English were portrayed in Luc Besson's The
Messenger.
The trials and tribulations of Ben and Nate eventually intertwine toward
the end of the film, which makes Van's seem really pointless.  It also
makes you wonder why the mom didn't have her own storyline.  Since the
film is supposed to be about a Jewish family, it seems weird to exclude
the matriarch.  Instead, she is reduced to yelling at her kids while
bent over at the waist.  The ending, while intended to be an emotional
heart-tugger, is instead a bit empty.
If you take away the linear script (which Levinson also wrote), the rest
of the film is actually quite lovely.  The acting is solid all around.
The music is phenomenal, using equal parts Frank Sinatra, James Brown
and Tom Waits.  The cinematography (Christopher Doyle, Happy Together)
helps to lend a dark, colorful feel to the film, while long-time
Levinson editor Stu Linder expertly chops up Levinson's gorgeous shots
in all of the right places.
2:07  R for adult language, mild violence and some sexual references

Title
Review for Frequency (2000)
>From its trailer, Frequency doesn't seem like much of a picture.  The
story is about a thirty-something cop that is somehow able to contact
his dead father through an old HAM radio.  The trailer portrays this
event with what seems like casual indifference  like the guy just got
an AOL instant message from the kid that he sat next to in the seventh
grade.  The dialogue goes something like this:
Dad  `Hey, Son.  It's me, your dead father.'
Dad  `Yup.  Must be some big sun spot or something.'
Son (looking at his watch)  `Yeah.  Hey, Dad?  This has been great, but
Millionaire is coming on right now, so I've gotta run.'
Dad  `Alright.  Catch ya later, Son.  Oh, and remember to choke up on
that bat.'
Son  `Whatever, dude.  I'm, like, all older now and stuff.'
The trailer then shows the father and son fighting crime and solving
murders from thirty years ago, but every time they do something, it
alters the future in ways that they can't anticipate.  Kind of like that
`Treehouse of Horror' episode of The Simpsons where Homer turns a
toaster into a time machine, repeatedly goes back in time and changes
his future.
But here's the thing  even though Frequency is predictable, it's still
creepy as hell.  Why?  Look no further than director Gregory Hoblit, who
has quietly made two of the most unnerving films of the 90s in Primal
Fear and Fallen.  It's hair-tingling and spine-raising and all of that
stuff.  Even the way Hoblit and cinematographer Alar Kivilo (A Simple
Plan) shoot normal interiors and exteriors is eerie.  But the whole
altering-the-future-by-changing-the-past plot has been done already, and
first-time scriptwriter Toby Emmerich offers little that we haven't
already seen before.
Frequency begins in 1969 Queens, where the borough is preparing for the
upcoming World Series between the Mets and the Baltimore Orioles.
Second-generation firefighter Frank Sullivan (Dennis Quaid, Any Given
Sunday) is happily married with a young son and a strong friendship with
a cop named Satch (André Braugher, Homicide: Life on the Streets).
Frank is also a HAM radio geek, but forbids his son from using the
contraption, instructing the boy - with a heavy New Yawk accent  that
`Dis is not a toy.'
Flash to thirty years later, where Frank's son John (James Caviezel,
Ride With the Devil) is a homicide investigator (partnered with his
Satch) living in the home he grew up in.  He's still grieving the loss
of his father, who died during a fire in an abandoned seed warehouse
when John was just a boy.  On the eve of the anniversary of Frank's
demise, John happens to find a box of his dad's stuff, including his old
HAM radio.  John plugs it in, starts talking to his dead dad and warns
him about the warehouse fire, thus altering the future.
The fire scene is really well done.  It's one of those times where you
don't realize you're holding your breath until the scene is over and you
start gasping for air.  But then Frequency turns into a murder mystery,
where Frank and John work together to catch a serial killer that was
able to off more victims because of the way they messed with history.
Discovering the identity of the killer isn't as much of a priority as
stopping him because Mrs. Sullivan (Elizabeth Mitchell, Molly) became
one of the victims as a result of Frank not meeting his maker in the
warehouse fire.
But, of course, nobody in the 60s or 90s believes Frank or John.  The
strange relationship between the two is a bit like The Bone Collector,
where the paralyzed Denzel Washington investigated crimes and caught a
serial killer despite not ever leaving his bed.  Here John is Denzel and
Frank is his Angelina Jolie.  The idea of Frank and John existing in two
different layers of time, yet still talking to each other while sitting
in the same house, in the same room, at the same desk, is thoroughly
intriguing.  But if your brain doesn't hurt too much from trying to keep
up with the twists and turns of the past and present, the ending should
be pretty easy to call.
Conversely, there are some decent-sized plot holes in Frequency, as
well.  John would never be allowed to work on a murder investigation
involving his own mother.  And I know precious little about HAM radios,
but I'm pretty sure that you need to press the button down on the
microphone when you want to talk.  The film also features some of the
worst make-up since Mr. Saturday Night.  The characters that are
supposed to be aged just look stupid, which should make people
appreciate the fine job that was done aging Robin Williams and Embeth
Davidtz in Bicentennial Man.
In short, Frequency is a must-see for anyone that ever lost their
father, contacted him with a HAM radio and then solved mysteries with
him.
1:55 - PG-13 for intense violence and disturbing images

Title
Review for Sliding Doors (1998)
Sliding doors.  They're what Helen runs into when her life takes a bit
of a strange turn.  She has just been fired from her job and as she
tries to catch the train home, the doors slide closed in her face.  This
activates a kind of fantasy parallel world: one where Helen makes the
train and one where she doesn't.
That's the basic idea of Sliding Doors, the film that recently opened
the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.  It's a fresh story in this world of
Blues Brothers 2000 movie crap that we live in.  Unfortunately, the
story and a glowing performance from Gwyneth Paltrow are all that keep
this movie afloat.
Helen also has a dirty cheating unemployed live-in boyfriend named Gerry
(John Lynch, Some Mother's Son), who sneaks in the evil fuck-bunny Lydia
(Jean Tripplehorn, Waterworld) as soon as Helen leaves for work every
day.  How does a guy on the dole find so much ugly-bumping time?  Helen
thinks he's an aspiring writer and is working on his book while she
toils away at her PR job.
The film opens with Helen rushing to get to work on time while lugging a
bag full of vodka, which she plans to use to replace the ones she took
from the office for a party at her home.  There is no vodka supply where
I work.  Anyway, when she gets to work, she is told that they needed
that vodka to woo a big client and is fired.  On the way out, she bumps
into James (John Hannah, Four Weddings and A Funeral), who picks up
Helen's dropped earring on the elevator as the doors slide closed.
Helen runs to catch the train and is slightly delayed by a small child
she bumps into on the way down the stairs.  As she watches the train
pull away, Helen steps back and watches it, as if her life is riding
away without her.  Then, in an unconventionally strange scene, her life
backs up like someone is rewinding it.  She skips backward up the
stairs, until someone hits the play button.  Only this time, the kids
mother yanks her out of the way as Fantasy-Helen barrels down the stairs
and jumps on the train is it's doors slide closed.
Fantasy-Helen gets home early and catches Gerry and Lydia in bed, and
leaves him.  She cuts and dies her mousy-brown hair and starts her own
successful PR firm.  And she starts to date James, too.
Reality-Helen is mugged while trying to catch a taxi and spends the day
in the hospital.  Because she is late, she doesn't catch Gerry.  She
suspects something is awry with her home life, but doesn't feel
confident enough to do anything about it.  She can't get a job and
reluctantly takes a job as a waitress.  Reality truly does bite.
Peter Howitt, who was nominated for his Art Direction in Ragtime, Who
Framed Roger Rabbit? and Mary, Queen of Scots, ruins his unique story by
spending too much time with the Gerry/Lydia story in his directorial
debut.  Paltrow reportedly turned down the roles of Rose in Titanic and
Ms. Peel in The Avengers to make this low-budget star vehicle.  Yikes
stripes, time to fire the agent!  Or maybe give him a promotion.

Title
Review for Beautiful (2000)
Sally Fields' feature film directorial debut is an atrocious story of a
woman hell bent on becoming a beauty pageant winner.  The problem is
that Beautiful can't figure out whether it wants to be a coming-of-age
drama or a scathing comedy about the absurdity of pageants.  Instead of
choosing one, the film tries to be both, and the net result is an uneven
picture that runs about thirty minutes too long.
Beautiful opens in 1986, where thirteen-year-old Naperville, Illinois
resident Mona Hibbard is shown getting braces.  She's paying for the
corrective procedure with her own money (in monthly installments) and is
thrilled when the dentist tells her that they'll be off in time for the
Junior Miss Pageant.
We learn that Mona is a bitchy piece of white trash with a mother who
ignores her and a stepfather who wants to molest her.  Instead of
pouring her time and energy into a expensive and time-consuming drug
and/or alcohol habit (like most American kids in similar situations),
Mona instead devotes her life to one simple idea  becoming a beauty
queen.  Her only friendship is one made out of convenience  mousy
grammar school seamstress Ruby can help Mona create different outfits
for her run at various pageants.
Flash to 1999, where Mona (Minnie Driver, Return to Me) has just won the
Illinois state pageant, earning a trip to the prestigious Miss American
Miss competition in Long Beach, California.  The next two cinematic
months unfold over an ungodly ninety-plus minutes.  We learn that Mona
has sabotaged her rivals on several occasions, and more shockingly, had
a baby that she pawned off on Ruby (Joey Lauren Adams, Big Daddy) to
raise as her own.  Why?  Because Miss American Miss contestants can't be
mothers.
To make matters worse, Mona can't stand the sight of her own daughter,
Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg , the kid from the Pepsi commercials).
The two constantly butt heads, and, coupled with Mona's inability to
deal with real life, Ruby essentially becomes a mother to both.  But
after a oddly grim mix-up at Ruby's employer, Mona has to look after
Vanessa, bringing out the motherly instinct that she had never shown
previously.
Beautiful's script was written (and co-produced) by Jon Bernstein, whose
only previous writing credit was the appalling Jerry Springer film
Ringmaster.  It's difficult to say whether the film had a weak, choppy
script, or if Fields insisted on cramming too much into the final
product.  In addition to blowing an abnormally large chunk of time on
Mona's childhood, Beautiful spends way too much time on the final
pageant.  Do we really need to see the entire talent portion of each of
the competition's five finalists?  Tom make matters worse, the film has
an ending that will make you cringe, unless you enjoyed the last scene
of Rudy.
The best thing about Beautiful is the casting.  Driver and Eisenberg
look like they could be related, but is that really enough to keep an
entire two-hour movie afloat?  The film's moral is that it's okay to lie
and hurt other people, so long as you eventually end up on top.  And,
unlike other films about single-minded egomaniacs (like Wall Street),
Mona walks away from her experience as a winner, a hero and a role
model.  Beautiful sure isn't pretty.  In fact, it's downright ugly.
On the plus side, the film could (hopefully) be the final nail in the
coffin of Destination Films  the studio that has given us the
impressively bad lineup of Whipped, Bats, Thomas and the Magic Railroad
and Eye of the Beholder.
1:52  PG-13 for adult language and thematic elements

Review for Julien Donkey-Boy (1999)
Julien (Ewen Bremner, The Acid House) isn't the most normal kid you will
find in cinema today.  His overbearing, wrestling-obsessed German father
(Werner Herzog) consumes entire bottles of cough syrup before prancing
around the house wearing a gas mask and offering his sons $10 to wear
Mother's wedding dress.  His pregnant sister Pearl (Chloë Sevigny, The
Last Days of Disco) also dances  ballet  and calls Julien on the phone
pretending to be their dead mother. Brother Chris (Evan Neumann)
wrestles trashcans.
The trashcan wrestling, for those of you that weren't lucky enough to
see Gummo, is somewhat of an homage to the chair wrestling in
writer/director Harmony Korine's debut film.  Gummo, a critically
maligned freak-fest, was a distinctive masterpiece about two kids that
hunted and killed neighborhood cats and sold them to the local grocery
store, which turned them into fresh ground chuck.  Sure, it sounds like
something to avoid, but the movie was visually stunning, using different
film stock together with still photographs to create a shocking rural
nightmare.  It even made my Top Ten List in 1997.
Korine's new film, however, is a totally different nightmare
altogether.  Officially the first American film (and sixth overall) to
meet the strict rules of the Danish `Dogme' group (no flashbacks, no
artificial light/sound, etc.), julien donkey-boy is a mess.  The story
is virtually non-existent and, because of the Dogme restraints, the film
is much darker and considerably more grainy than Gummo.  Which leaves
only the cavalcade of freaks, including an old man who eats lit
cigarettes, a guy with no arms that plays the drums and does card
tricks, and a black albino that fancies himself a rapper, repeating `I'm
the black albino down from Alabama.'  And don't get me started on the
retard bowling.
I wasn't sure if Julien was supposed to be retarded or not.  He would
certainly seem to be if surrounded by a few normal characters.  Bremner
is also a dead ringer for Rochester Raging Rhinos midfielder Mauro
Biello.  His performance is gutsy and somewhat effective, as I actually
wondered if he may actually have a neurological disorder.  After all, he
did play similar roles in Trainspotting and The Acid House.
Korine explained, after the screening I attended, that he was approached
to join the Dogme group after Gummo and that the filming of julien
donkey-boy was closely monitored by several Danish supervisors.  The
movie was mostly improvised (save the phone call between Julien and his
dead mom) and Korine used about thirty digital cameras during filming.
Korine preferred the initial cut of the film, which ran at an ungodly
six-and-a-half hours, and, when asked if the picture was real in any
way, stated that the picture was based on `a true inspiration.'

Review for Interview, The (1998)
The film that took Australia by storm has finally found its way to
American soil.  The Interview swept through the 1998 Australian Film
Institute Awards, winning three major prizes (Best Film, Best Screenplay
and Best Actor) out of the nine nominations it received.  Not bad,
considering it was writer/director Craig Monahan's first film.
The Interview is set in present-day Melbourne, and its first scene is a
real attention-grabber.  41-year-old Eddie Fleming (Hugo Weaving) is
asleep in his apartment, which is littered with old newspapers.  At
around 5 AM, his door is knocked off its hinges by a group of
plainclothes detectives, some of whom beat and handcuff Fleming as the
others begin to trash his pad in search of clues.  Fleming has no idea
why the cops are there, and before he can get his bearings, his pants
are full of piss and he's been dragged off to headquarters for
questioning.
At the police station, the investigation is taken over by Detective
Sergeant John Steele (Tony Martin) and Detective Senior Constable Wayne
Prior (Aaron Jeffrey), who proceed to interrogate Fleming with a `good
cop/bad cop' style of double-team attack.  The problem is that Fleming
still has no idea why he's there, but this doesn't keep Steele and Prior
from thinking they've got the right guy.
Most of The Interview takes place in the claustrophobic interrogation
room, where we slowly learn what crimes the police believe Fleming has
committed.  At first, Steele and Prior give the impression their subject
is suspected of car theft, but thanks to the numerous breaks taken
during their interrogation, we learn that the stolen car is just the tip
of the iceberg.  Fleming is actually the prime suspect in the
disappearance of six people the police believe have been murdered.
Suddenly, in the middle of the interrogation, Fleming throws the
detectives for a loop when he confesses to the murders, describing in
detail how he killed his victims and what he did with their bodies.
Steele and Prior lick their lips in anticipation of closing a
high-profile case, but their superiors aren't sure if Fleming is telling
the truth, or just leading the detectives on a wild-goose chase.
Weaving, who is probably best known in the States as the guy who chased
Keanu in The Matrix, is fantastic (and nearly unrecognizable with
medium-length blond hair), acting more with his eyebrows than most
mainstream stars can pull off with their entire bodies.  Martin also
does a decent job, but Jeffrey adds little to the film except
knuckle-dragging muscle.
The Interview could be a kissing cousin to The Usual Suspects, but
Monahan actually began writing his script in the early 90s, so all
similarities are coincidental.  It's a good film, but, unfortunately, it
still feels like a Suspects rip-off.  But that's still better than
harvesting the carcass of a 70s television show or Saturday Night Live
skit.  Imagine Kafka taking on an episode of Homicide or NYPD Blue, and
you've got a pretty good idea of the kind of film The Interview is.
Terrific cinematography from Simon Duggan (the upcoming Risk) and score
from double Oscar nominee David Hirschfelder (Shine, Elizabeth).

Title
Review for Pitch Black (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
It's a sad fact that Hollywood saves its worst films to put out in the
first two months of each calendar year.  Most of these stinkers get
yanked from theaters so quickly that you may forget that they ever
existed, unless you had the misfortune of paying to see one.  For some
reason, I seem to remember more of these early-season science-fiction
bombs than anything else.  If it has to do with space, and it comes out
in January or February, then run.  In the last two years, we've had
Phantoms, Wing Commander, Supernova and Firestorm (there's `space'
between Howie Long's ears, so it counts)  a crop that represents the
worst film has to offer.
Pitch Black certainly didn't seem like it would be an exception to the
general rule.  The pedigree is less than stellar - David N. Twohy (The
Arrival) directing from a script that he wrote with brothers Jim and Ken
Wheat (you may remember them from such sequels as The Fly 2, The Birds 2
and Nightmare on Elm Street 4).  There are no A-list stars.  There
aren't really any B-list stars, either.  In fact, the C-list might even
be out of reach.  The story isn't anything special, either.
But Pitch Black isn't bad.  I might even go so far as to say that it's
good (how about `goodish'?).  It's about a passenger freighter called
the Hunter-Gratzner, a spacecraft with thirty-nine lives on board 
including Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel, Boiler Room), a diabolical
prisoner that can see in the dark.  The ship crashes into a strange
planet during a routine hyper-jump, killing the captain and leaving
Pilot Second Class Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell, High Art) in charge of
the crew, prisoner and multi-racial travelers.  Wait a secondFry?
Prisoner?  Multi-racial travelers?  This sounds like a cross between
ConAir and Futurama.
Of course, Pitch Black is more like Alien than anything else.  The basic
plot of the movie involves these nasty nocturnal creatures that will
only attack Fry and crew when it's dark.  As the title indicates, things
become pitch-black when a rare eclipse shrouds the planet in darkness.
Heythat guy that can see in the dark should come in handy, eh?  People
predictably start getting bumped off one by one until three are left to
battle the CG monsters.
There are three things that make Pitch Black entertaining.  The first is
that the film doesn't seem to have the typical stock characters that
plague the genre.  Black also isn't as clichéd as you would expect from
a sci-fi flick released this early in the year.  That is to say, it
doesn't rip off every successful space flick, like Supernova did.  The
third and most impressive feature is the editing (Rick Shaine, Extreme
Measures) and cinematography (David Eggby, Blue Streak).  The crash
scene is really well done, using bright flashes of light and quick cuts,
but it isn't until after the crash that the feel of the film is
established.  The planet is essentially dead:  A desert littered with
barren trees, abandoned outposts and bones of humongous animals, and
Eggby shoots it like Three Kings  beautifully washed out with muted
colors.  If nothing else, it's a visual winner.

Title
Review for Fantasia/2000 (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
It's been almost sixty years since Walt Disney's Fantasia debuted in
theaters.  Disney had always meant his beloved 1940s classic to be a
perpetual work in progress, replacing one of the original seven segments
with a new animated short each year.  But it never happened that way.
In fact, Fantasia tanked at the box office when it was originally
released, which probably had something to do with Walt's unrealized
dream.  The film did win an honorary Oscar for `unique achievement,' but
it didn't come until two years after its initial theatrical release.
The funny thing about the original Fantasia is that most kids just
didn't dig it.  I couldn't stand it when I was little and, when I grew
older, always assumed that the film was used primarily to enhance the
highs of stoned college students that couldn't find a theater playing
2001: A Space Odyssey.  Fantasia seemed like Walt's attempt to make
`Sgt. Pepper,' even though the Beatles version was still a
quarter-century away from being realized.  Hey, I was just a kid  give
me a break.
What I did take away from Fantasia, be it subliminally or not, was the
music.  If it weren't for this film, and a myriad of Bugs Bunny
cartoons, my knowledge of classical music would be limited to
Schroeder's references in the `Peanuts' cartoons.  The original film,
which ran a full two hours, included seven classical classics that
accompanied each animated segment.  Each piece was performed by the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which contributes the music for Fantasia
2000, as well.  So even if you aren't particularly interested in the
visuals, the music is still damn enjoyable (especially coming from the
state-of-the-art IMAX sound system).
Each section of Fantasia 2000 is introduced by a series of special guest
celebrities, ranging from the funny (Steve Martin), to the serious
(Angela Lansbury), to the completely unexpected (Penn & Teller).  The
first is called `Symphony No. 5,' after Ludwig von Beethoven's
masterpiece  and features these flying triangle-shaped bird thingies in
a battle against these other flying triangle-shaped bird thingies.  Good
versus evil?  Who knows?  It was over before I could figure it out.
The second segment was about whales that flew to the tune of Ottorino
Respighi's "Pines of Rome.'  It looked like those Coke commercials with
the polar bears.  George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" kicked off the
next portion of the film, which featured very un-Disney like animation
of New York City that began with one simple line.  The fourth (and best)
portion, "The Steadfast Tin Soldier,' was set to Dmitri Shostakovich's
"Piano Concerto No. 2" and was about a one-legged soldier that fell in
love with a ballerina because he believed that she shares the same
disability.  Number five was another short piece, called "Carnival of
the Animals,' after the Camille Saint-Saëns song of the same name.  It
featured a flamingo with a yo-yo.
"The Sorceror's Apprentice" is up next, and it's the same as it was in
the original.  The seventh segment is called "Pomp and Circumstance'
after Sir Edward Elgar's musical contribution.  Probably the most
enjoyable for children, `Pomp' features a duck named Donald that is
placed in charge of rounding up animals to board Noah's Ark.  And the
last portion of the film uses Igor Stravinsky's "The Firebird" to show
the effects of a volcanic bird on a nearby forest.
Each short features a different director and animators, which gives them
all a unique look.  And like any Disney film, there are things that will
rile certain people.  Penn chops off Teller's hand as they introduce
"The Sorceror's Apprentice.'  `Rhapsody in Blue' used some pretty bad
racial stereotypes, including one character that lived in Harlem,
frequented jazz clubs, was bald with a big nose and lips, and couldn't
hail a cab to save his life.  I can already envision Danny Glover
picketing.
Other than that, Fantasia 2000 is perfect family entertainment.  Plus,
it's only seventy-seven minutes long, so your bratty kids won't get
bored, either.

Title
Review for Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Luc Besson's (The Fifth Element) well-intentioned but severely uneven
story of the Maid of Orleans brazenly portrays its heroine as more of a
delusional schizophrenic teen than a saint.  But who's to say that she
wasn't really mental?  Maybe we're just used to seeing Joan portrayed as
a dignified, righteous woman that will do anything for her King and for
her God.  Crazy or not, The Messenger is still a major disappointment
from a director as accomplished as Besson.
The story takes place during the Hundred Years' War in fifteenth century
France, where the young Joan is an illiterate peasant girl that
occasionally hears the voice of God.  She constantly seeks the
confessional at her church with such ferocity she seems like an early
sufferer of obsessive-compulsive disorder.  On her way back from
confession one day, she finds a sword while rolling around in a field of
flowers and believes it to be a gift from the heavens.  Joan arrives
home to find English soldiers burning her village to the ground and
looks on in horror as a soldier kills and rapes (in that order) her
older sister.
Years later, seventeen-year-old Joan (Milla Jovovich, He Got Game) is
received by The Dauphin (John Malkovich, Being John Malkovich), the man
who would be King if the country weren't being controlled by the
English.  In one of the film's better scenes, Joan must find The Dauphin
in a room full of people despite not knowing what he looks like.  When
she passes this test, The Dauphin agrees to give Joan an army to fight
the English, who here are portrayed as obscene barbarians with bad
teeth.  Remember, Besson is a Frenchie.
While the graphic battle scenes are cool, you can't help thinking how
they pale in comparison to Braveheart, especially every time you see
blood splashed on the camera.  On her white horse, Joan's voice seems
too squeaky to command an army, yelling horribly clichéd lines to incite
her troops to battle.  Despite her foolish and hasty lack of war
tactics, Joan manages to win huge battles in both Orleans and Loire.
She even earns a victory in one battle just by telling the English to go
home.
About ninety minutes into the film, The Dauphin is crowned King Charles
VII and, having attained his lifelong goal, loses interest in Joan's
pursuit of a free France.  A little over one year later, Joan is
captured in Compiegne by the Burgundians and later sold to the English,
where they try her as a witch and a heretic in an attempt to discredit
Charles VII.  Joan's incarceration causes her to become delusional, even
dreaming up a big-nosed conscience (Dustin Hoffman, Wag the Dog) that
tells her, "You didn't see what was; you saw what you wanted to see."
This is when the film starts to get interesting, but it's way too late.
Say what you will about Jovovich's clumsy performance, she is pretty
believable as an insanely fervent girl.  An established actress would
have been too distracting, especially when crazy Joan hacks off her long
tresses to fit in with her male soldier counterparts.  The result is the
second Matt Damon-esque haircut on an actress this month (see Hilary
Swank in Boys Don't Cry for the other).  Even though Jovovich seems all
wrong, try thinking of a better actress that could pass for a teenager.
And LeeLee Sobieski doesn't count.
As The Dauphin/Charles VII, Malkovich once again shows that he has
become a parody of himself, while Faye Dunaway's (The Thomas Crown
Affair) performance as Yolande D'Aragon is devalued by a distracting
purple vein that runs down the middle of her forehead.  Besson's visual,
MTV-style direction certainly makes the earlier parts of the film more
watchable, but the usually reliable director (La Femme Nikita, The
Professional, The Fifth Element) falls flat here.  All of the really
stylistic images are given away in the trailer.  But give him credit for
trying to represent Saint Joan's religious visions as a figment of her
imagination.  Maybe those wacky Dogma protestors are picketing the wrong
film.
2:35 - R for extremely graphic violence, intense battle scenes, rape and
adult language.  Oh, and the whole burning at the stake thing, too.

Review for East Is East (1999)
Oh, great - it's another movie about a mother from the U.K. trying to
cope with a bunch of kids.  Hot on the heels of Agnes Browne and
Angela's Ashes comes East is East, an award-winning play-turned-film
about a family that pisses in pots and bathes in a tiny tin basin.  But
unlike these other films, East actually features a strong paternal
figure  a Pakistani man intent on raising his kids under the strict
tenets of the Muslim religion.
George Khan (Om Puri, My Son the Fanatic) left Pakistan and his first
wife in the 40s and has been happily married to Brit wife Ella (Linda
Bassett, Oscar & Lucinda) for twenty-five years.  The Khans own a
fish-and-chips shop, and their seven children - six boys and a girl, who
range in age from twelve to adult - are at a point in their lives where
rebellion is to be expected.  But these youths have more to revolt
against than your average teens experimenting in the thriving Manchester
counterculture scene of 1971.  The kids try to shun Pop's religion (they
call him `Genghis') and have to be physically herded into a van that
drives them to private religious studies.
As the film opens, the oldest Khan son Nazir (Ian Aspinal) makes like
Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride and bolts out of the ceremony for his
arranged marriage.  Inspired by the growing tension between his native
country and India, as well as a subplot involving a fascist politician
preaching racial purity as a major platform of his campaign, George
forges ahead and tries to set up surprise weddings for his next two
sons, Tariq (Jimi Mistry) and Abdul (Raji James).  Things in the Khan
household start to boil over as Ella is no longer able to tow the fine
line between devotion to her husband and the natural instinct to protect
her kids.
While this description may not sound like a load of laughs, East is
downright hysterical.  The clash between different cultures is very
effectively portrayed in the screenplay, which Ayub Khan-Din adapted
from his own smash-hit play (for you indie film buffs, he played Sammy
in Sammy and Rosie Get Laid).  People may take offense to the domestic
violence that occurs in the film, especially when those incidents are
sandwiched between comedic scenes.  And some people may think that the
film is filled with horrible racial stereotypes about Pakistanis.  A
neighbor mutters that the Khans look like `a pick-a-ninny picnic,' and
at one point, Tariq shouts, `I don't want to marry a Paki!'  Well, he
doesn't, and I wouldn't if I were him, either.
East was nominated for a handful of British Academy Awards, as well as
running away with top honors from the London Critics Circle.  The acting
within the dysfunctional family is as good as I've seen, and most of the
young actors have little or no acting experience (some may be familiar
to fans of British soap operas).  And Puri is fantastic as the
overbearing father that calls his wife `missus' and all of his kids
`bastard.

Title
Review for Manchurian Candidate, The (1962)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate was released just 13 months
before President Kennedy was assassinated. The film, which was not instantly
touted as a masterpiece, was yanked from theatres out of respect for
Kennedy, especially since Lee Harvey Oswald was rumored to have watched
Candidate before heading off to the book depository.
When it was re-released 25 years later, Candidate was widely hailed as one
of the greatest political thrillers ever, as well as being
head-and-shoulders better than any of the other slop out there at the time
(1987 was the year Mannequin, Dirty Dancing, and Throw Momma From the Train
were up for Oscars. and  the year Cher won). The American Film
Institute recently placed the picture at 67 on its list of the Top 100
Greatest American Movies.
It's easy to understand why filmgoers didn't immediately embrace Candidate,
which was one of the first films to take on McCarthyism. The US was hip-deep
in the Cold War, so viewers were probably a little shaken by a film that had
the audacity to be this cynical and border this close to political satire.
Since Oscar loves controversy, Candidate was, for the most part, ignored at
the 1963 ceremony, which was hosted by the film's star, Frank Sinatra.
Editor Ferris Webster and co-star Angela Lansbury netted the film's only two
nominations, and neither won. Of course, the competition was stiff in The
Year of the Epic (Best Picture nominees included Lawrence of Arabia, To Kill
a Mockingbird, The Music Man, Mutiny on the Bounty, and the Saving Private
Ryan of its time, The Longest Day).
After a brief prologue that establishes a group of American soldiers
fighting for freedom in 1952 Korea, Candidate quickly treats viewers to one
of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema. The men, led by Bennett
Marco (Sinatra), have been tricked by their translator, Chunjin (Henry Silva
from Ghost Dog), and led to Manchuria, where each has been brainwashed by a
Communist group called The Pavlov Institute.
The scene, which is most likely what led to Webster's editing nomination,
begins in what appears to be a ladies' garden club party in the Spring Lake
Hotel in New Jersey. A sign reads "Fun With Hydrangeas" as the camera pans
across the room, showing Marco and his soldiers as bored onlookers to a
gardening demonstration led by a fragile old woman. As the camera works its
way in a circular clockwise motion, we see a room full of elderly women
dressed in pretty floral dresses. But when the camera comes full circle (it'
s all done in one shot), things have drastically changed.
Although Marco's troops remain in their seats, their surroundings are now
completely different. Giant photos of Stalin and Chairman Mao hang on the
wall; the elderly speaker has been replaced with a burly Asian man named Dr.
Yen Lo (Khigh Dhiegh); his audience has transformed from gardening hobbyists
to Chinese, Korean, and Soviet bigwigs; and the hydrangea lecture has become
a demonstration of hypnotism (the soldiers only think they're in Jersey).
Dr. Lo displays the overwhelming success he has achieved with Marco's men,
choosing Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) to participate in a disturbing
experiment. Lo has Shaw explain that he's never killed a man before, but
then instructs the soldier to execute two of his war buddies. Shaw does so
without question.
The rest of the film takes place two years later, where Marco has been
reassigned to Army Intelligence in Washington and Shaw has returned home a
war hero and winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor for wiping out an
entire company of Chinese infantry (or so the brainwashing story goes). He's
greeted at the airport by his mother (Lansbury) and stepfather (James
Gregory, Ulysses S. Grant from Wild Wild West), a Republican Senator with
his eye on the 1956 Presidential Election. Shaw's return home is a carefully
orchestrated public relations coup for Senator Iselin, although we quickly
learn that his better half is, as Bob Dylan sang in "Maggie's Farm," the
brains behind Pa.
While Marco has nightmares about the Spring Lake Hotel and the Pavlov
Institute, Shaw is still a hypnotized killer who kick-starts his dark side
whenever he sees a certain playing card. He's a pawn in a political game
being played by someone very close to him. Marco knows something is afoul,
but will he be able to deprogram his friend before he completes his final
mission? Is Marco also a brainwashed killing machine? He has a very strange
conversation on a train with a character played by Janet Leigh. None of it
makes any sense, which leads viewers to believe it's all a secret subliminal
code. Don't expect answers to all of these questions because you won't get
them.
While Sinatra logs his best performance here since The Man With the Golden
Arm, Lansbury steals the show as Shaw's mother from hell. Harvey, who was
nominated for Best Actor (for Room at the Top) the year before Candidate was
released, does well as the slightly robotic killer. There are a ton of great
smaller roles, too, like John McGiver from The Patty Duke Show, who plays a
Senator who Shaw's father accuses of being a Communist.
Frankenheimer's direction, from the opening credits to the edge-of-your-seat
Hitchcockian finale, has never been better as he peppers the film with
American flags, eagles, and various images of Abraham Lincoln (no doubt
foreshadowing the closing scene --- ironically, the director drove Bobby
Kennedy to the California hotel where he was assassinated in 1968). There's
a terrific fight sequence between Sinatra and Silva, and an excellent scene
in which the director uses a television set to portray a scene from several
different angles.
Frankenheimer, who is now 71 and has recently directed both Reindeer Games
and Ronin (and is, allegedly, the father of Pearl Harbor director Michael
Bay), crafted one of the finest Cold War thrillers ever made. It ranks right
up there with Fail Safe as films that ended up being a lot more frightening
than the actual Cold War itself.
Candidate was based on Richard Condon's novel of the same name (he also
wrote Prizzi's Honor) and adapted by George Axelrod (Breakfast at Tiffany'
s). The screenplay is full of great lines, from the funny (Shaw on his
mother: "It's a terrible thing to hate your mother. But I didn't always hate
her. When I was a child, I only kind of disliked her"), to the bizarre
(Leigh: "I was one of the original Chinese workmen who laid the track on
this stretch"), to the amazingly racist (Sinatra: "I can see that Chinese
cat standing there and smiling like Fu Manchu").

Title
Review for Stir of Echoes (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The year's second scariest film (after The Blair Witch Project) comes
from an unlikely source  writer/director David Koepp (The Trigger
Effect), who adapted the script from Richard Matheson's book (he also
wrote the novel What Dreams May Come).  Echoes will unfortunately open
after the similar but big-budgeted Bruce Willis flick The Sixth Sense
(due 8/6), but is still one of the creepiest films to be released since
Se7en.
Echoes opens with a little boy named Jake staring into the camera while
sitting in the tub.  He's answering questions that nobody appears to be
asking.  Is it an imaginary friend?  His parents seem to think so, but
Jake is really conversing with the spirit of a missing local girl named
Samantha Kozak.
Kevin Bacon (Wild Things) plays Tom Witzky, Jake's blue-collar working
father that has spent his entire life within a six-block radius of one
Chicago neighborhood.  He's disappointed with his boring life and
dead-end job.  His hippie sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas, Grace of
my Heart) talks a disbelieving Tom into undergoing hypnosis at a party.
He only sees a second or two of seemingly unrelated and fragmented
flashes, but when Tom comes to, he's been told that he was out for
several minutes.  To make matters worse, Lisa also plants a suggestion
into Tom's subconscious.  Not the kind that will make him cluck like a
chicken when somebody says the word `omelette,' but rather an innocent
appeal to be a bit more open-minded.
Before he went under, Tom crowed `C'mon  what's the worst that could
happen?'  Well, the worst does happen - amateur hypnotist Lisa
accidentally opened the door to his mind instead of making him
open-minded.  What does that mean?  Just that Tom slowly is able to see
and hear the same things as his son.  He catches more glimpses of the
spooky images that he saw while under hypnosis, and even catches a
glimpse or two of Samantha.  He also drinks a lot of orange juice and
begins to unwind mentally, putting a strain on his wife Maggie (Kathryn
Erbe, Dream with the Fishes).
When Lisa puts Tom under a second time in an attempt to close the
Pandora's box, he instead gets a one-word message from beyond: `Dig.'
What follows is very reminiscent of the slow descent into madness
previously seen in The Amityville Horror and The Shining.  In fact, you
can't help but think of Amityville's George Lutz (James Brolin) digging
up his basement while watching Bacon do the same thing.  And maybe
you'll be reminded of Bacon's Flatliners.  The story is derivative of
both films (and many others), but it's still original enough to raise
the hair on your arms on several occasions.
The story is fairly predictable (I called it about 40 minutes into the
film) but seems oddly short.  It's almost like a lot was carved out of
the final cut  Tom's rock band, Jake's baby monitor, Maggie's pregnancy
and a cop named Neil all seemed destined to have more screen time, but
were curiously skipped over after careful introductions.  But the film
is worth the price of admission just for Bacon and the young son's eerie
performances.  (1:35  R for brief nudity, sexual content, adult
language and violence)

Title
Review for Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (2000)
Lightning doesn't strike twice.  It doesn't even come close.  Book of
Shadows, the sequel to 1999's much-hyped hit The Blair Witch Project,
pales in comparison to its predecessor.  In fact, they're apples and
oranges.
The first film was good because it was believable.  Even after the
relentless media coverage, some viewers still weren't sure if the film
was real or fake (believe me  I got dozens of dopey e-mail messages
asking if I knew the real truth).  Part of the original's believability
was in the acting, or perhaps the lack thereof.  Josh, Heather and Mike
weren't acting so much as reacting to what was happening to them. There
was no score, and the fact that the film was shot using two handheld
cameras (which were operated by the actors) added to Blair Witch's
realism.
The best part about the original is that it didn't rely on special
effects or even anything visually disturbing to freak people out. The
visions were mostly in your head, and we all know that what you can
imagine can be 1000 times more frightening than anything Hollywood can
create (Battlefield Earth aside).  In 30 years, it will still be scary.
People won't laugh at the dated technology like they're doing with the
re-release of The Exorcist.  Regrettably, the sequel doesn't follow the
same formula for terror.
Shadows ups the character count from three to five, and while none of
the new kids have much acting experience, each tries really hard to do a
good job.  (Too hard, actually - none of them do particularly well.)
And the actor-wielding, handheld cameras were discarded in favor of more
traditional filming techniques (using a film crew complete with director
and cinematographer).  The lack of score has been replaced with a slew
of "hot" modern rock tracks.
Director Joe Berlinger (Paradise Lost) explains away the differences at
the beginning of the film via a title card that points out the fact that
Shadows is a fictionalized version of the actual events that transpired
following the release of the first film.  Shadows begins promisingly,
using documentary-style clips of interviews with Burkittsville, Maryland
residents explaining the effects the success of the first film had on
their community and, more specifically, themselves.
Things begin to go astray once the real action starts to take place.
Shadows is about Jeffrey Donovan, a former mental patient who creates an
adventure tour of the supposedly haunted wooded area of Burkittsville.
His first expedition includes a Wiccan girl (Kim Director), a couple
doing research on a Blair Witch book (Tristine Skyler and Stephen Barker
Turner), and a psychic who looks like a goth version of Debi Mazar
(Erica Leerhsen).  Like the first film, the real names of each actor are
used for their characters.
The group's first stop is at the ruins of Rustin Parr's home, where they
spend the night and wake up to untold horrors that aren't really that
horrifying.  The fab five even run into a group of sightseers from a
rival tour group, and their fate becomes so obvious it's almost
laughable.  There are occasional flashes of what we're supposed to
assume are the murders described in the first film, but other than that,
Shadows offers nothing too frightening.  There's no whopper ending that
leaves things unresolved, but there are about a half-dozen times when
characters shout `What the f--- is going on?'  Call me crazy, but I'd
rather have the former than the latter.
Berlinger, who has no previous non-documentary feature work under his
belt (he did direct episodes of Homicide and the short-lived WB drama
D.C.), co-wrote Shadows' script with Dick Beebe (House on Haunted
Hill).  The film was executive-produced by Blair Witch's Daniel Myrick
and Eduardo Sánchez, who surround themselves with some quality
behind-the-camera talent, including editor Sarah Flack (The Limey),
cinematographer Nancy Schreiber (Your Friends and Neighbors) and musical
maestro Carter Burwell (Three Kings).  Unfortunately, Shadows will never
be able to get out of the shadow of The Blair Witch Project.  As horror
sequels go, it's still better than the rest of the slop out there (aside
from Scream 2), but compared to the original, it's a whopping
disappointment.

Review for Almost Famous (2000)
Last fall, Dreamworks released a film with `buzz' barely detected by the
entertainment industry's radar.  Upon its release, American Beauty was
extremely well-received by critics and, while some people couldn't quite
grasp the idea of its widespread acclaim, it went on to cut a wide path
through Hollywood as it took home four major Academy Awards.
Almost exactly one year later, the studio unleashes Almost Famous, and,
while it remains to be seen if the public snuggles up to the film, it's
already pulling in some of the best reviews of the year.  Is Famous,
which boasts no major stars and tells a highly personal story, going to
be an Oscar contender?  I'm not sure, but it does have a scene with a
blonde girl and a rose, so you've got to like its chances.
Famous opens in 1969 San Diego, where single schoolteacher Elaine Miller
(Frances McDormand, Wonder Boys) is struggling to raise her two children
in a time when drugs and free love were guaranteed to anyone that wanted
them.  Her oldest, daughter Anita (Zooey Deschanel, Mumford) is a lost
cause, fleeing the home and her mother's overprotection for San
Francisco's happening scene.  This, of course, focuses all of Elaine's
well-meaning energy, as well as her restrictions on everything from
sugar to rock music, on her youngest son, William (Michael Angarano).
A precocious eleven-year-old, William discovers his sister's abandoned
record collection, and falls in love with the likes of Led Zeppelin, The
Who and Bob Dylan.  Flash to 1973, where William (newcomer Patrick
Fugit) abandons notions of fitting in with his older classmates (he
skipped a grade and started school a year early) and instead spends his
time writing for his school newspaper, as well as an underground rock
rag.  Through his perseverance and his skills as a writer, Creem
magazine editor Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman, The Talented Mr.
Ripley) tells William to give him a 1000 word article on the Black
Sabbath show coming to San Diego.
William's inexperience and youthful looks keep him from getting to
Sabbath, but he does manage to strike up a friendship with a group of
fans that follow Sabbath's opening band, Stillwater.  Adamant in her
denial that her friends aren't groupies, Penny Lane (Kate Hudson,
Gossip) becomes William's link to a subject he can both obtain access to
and write about.  His piece for Creem opens the door for a bigger and
more lucrative offer from Rolling Stone magazine, but also entails
missing school to follow the band on a portion of their `Almost Famous'
bus tour of the country.
Trying to heed the words of both his mother (`don't do drugs') and his
Creem mentor (`don't make friends with rock stars'), the wide-eyed
William sets out to write an unbiased article about the band.  His
attempted detachment is constantly challenged by his close relationship
with Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup, Jesus' Son) and
soon, William begins to act as an intermediary between Russell and his
road girlfriend Penny.  His article, if he's ever able to find the time
to write it, could be a hypnotic tale of a band on the verge of stardom
dealing with management changes, pyrotechnic problems and a quiet power
struggle within the group.  But he can never get any of the band members
to sit down for a proper interview.
Famous was written and directed by Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire), who,
as you may know, became an editor for Rolling Stone when he was just
sixteen.  The film is a semi-autobiographical tale of his years spent
traveling with some of the country's top rock acts.  Stillwater is a
blend of Led Zeppelin and The Allman Brothers (among others), and the
relationship between William and Russell is supposed to have been based
on Crowe's personal interviews with Jackson Browne.
The ending of the film starts to get a little tedious, but it ultimately
pays off.  Crowe's fly-on-the-wall direction gives the film a bit of a
documentary feel, but without the shaky, handheld camera work that we've
seen in biopics like Private Parts.  John Toll's (Braveheart) glowing
cinematography and Nancy Wilson's (from Heart - she Crowe's wife) score
add to the almost hypnotic pace of the film.
The unknown Fugit is perfectly cast as the ingenuous teen, and Crudup's
rock swagger is mesmerizing (I still think he was channeling Kurt Cobain
in Jesus' Son).  It would be tough to imagine Famous with its original
casting choices  Brad Pitt playing Russell and Sarah Polley tackling
the role of Penny Lane.
Famous has one of the year's best opening sequences, where William
handwrites the credits on a yellow legal pad with a pencil (making one
hilarious mistake).  His writing is broken up by shots of his bedroom,
which is covered in rock posters.  There are also several shots of a
desk drawer full of concert ticket stubs and backstage passes, which
Crowe provided from his own personal collection.  The film's musical
consultants were Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis and Peter Frampton, the
latter of whom provides a cameo as well.

Review for Here on Earth (2000)
Chris Klein made his big-screen acting debut less than a year ago but
still managed to be cast in two of the year's funniest films  Election
and American Pie.  His buff bod and goofy good looks made him a natural
to tackle the brainless jock-type roles that decent American comedies
seem to always need.  You could laugh just looking at him.  So who
decided that he should star in a romantic drama?
Klein stars as Kelley Morse, a Princeton-bound rich kid who, as the film
opens, learns that his father won't be able to attend his graduation
ceremony because of an important business trip.  As the class
valedictorian, Kelley's pop will also miss his son's speech to the
graduating class of Rallston, a private high school in the middle of
nowhere.  In fact, it's so in-the-middle-of-nowhere that Earth doesn't
seem to know where it's supposed to be set.  It was filmed in Minnesota,
but they definitely made it seem like it was supposed to be set in New
England  specifically outside Boston.  But there's a bus that says
Buffalo (NY) and there's a baseball stadium emblazoned `Go Mud Hens,'
which would imply Toledo (OH).  Maybe the title is supposed to be a
clever play on the film's patchy locations, but that's pretty
unbelievable seeing how Earth displays no other ingenuity whatsoever.
Basically, Earth is about Kelley falling in love with a simple farm girl
that he meets in the nearby town.  Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski,
Eyes Wide Shut) already has a long-term relationship (as well as a
strange knee problem) with Jasper Arnold (Josh Hartnett, The Faculty),
but is quickly swept off her feet by Kelley.  Does Sam choose the boy
born with a silver fork, knife and spoon in his mouth, or stick with the
boy she grew up with, even though he's a backwoods, Bible-thumping
simpleton?  Two words  Darva Conger.  Even though Sam's sister had her
big dumb country heart broken by a Rallston boy, Sam still ditches
Jasper for the boy with the perfect hair that can buy and sell her a
million times over.  Does anybody actually root for characters like
this?
The story is nothing new, so let's talk about the execution (or lack
thereof).  Earth is packed full of wuss-rock, from the Goo Goo Dolls'
ballad over the title cards, right through to Jessica Simpson's closing
credits stinker.  It also offers the most ridiculous sexual precursor
since the Affleck/Tyler animal cracker scene in Armageddon when Kelley
kisses Sam's feet and moves up her body naming each of her `parts' after
U.S. states.  One could even argue that Kelley is in the midst of a
massive sexual identity crisis, since he found his naked mother dead in
a bathtub some years earlier.  Oh, and he has a girl's name, and is
chasing after someone named Sam.
Multiplexes should be staffed with ushers standing at the theatre door
with boxes for guys to check their marbles into before watching this
film, because nobody with a pair will remotely enjoy it.  I'm pretty
sure the guy behind me lost his somewhere during the last third of the
picture because he was frantically searching the floor for something
when the lights finally came on.  The only thing that may be able to
hold a guy's attention is Sobieski, whose last theatrical release was
Eyes Wide Shut (which was actually filmed about three years ago).  She's
slowly starting to grow out of her `Helen Hunt's daughter' look and, in
the meantime, has sprouted C-cups, which are prominently displayed
throughout the film.
Earth was directed by Mark Piznarski, who is probably best known for his
work on television dramas like My So-Called Life and NYPD Blue, as is
cinematographer Michael D. O'Shea  not the beer, but the guy that
shoots Once and Again.  The awful script was penned by Michael Seitzman
(Farmer & Chase).  Earth is yet another early entry into my `Worst Films
of 2000' list.  If theatres had windows, I would have jumped out.

Title
Review for Titan A.E. (2000)
Toward the end of Fox's new animated feature Titan AE, one of its
characters shouts `Let's not do that again,' after flying a spaceship
through a tough-to-navigate ice field.  One has to wonder when Fox is
going to come to the same conclusion about their animated film division.
They continue to shell out top dollar to produce expensive toons that
are panned by critics and go widely unseen by the public (like 1997's
Anastasia).
Titan lifts its story from  oh, I don't know  every successful
science-fiction film that I've ever seen in my life.  The only thing
that keeps Titan from being an extremely unwatchable film is the
animation, which is astonishingly well-done here.  But like other highly
touted animated films of late, Titan's vividly realistic backgrounds and
inanimate objects are ruined by dull sketches of people and other
assorted creatures.  Why does the technology used to animate humans seem
like it hasn't been updated since Pearl Harbor?  I've seen
better-looking people in after school cartoons and video games, not to
mention Toy Story and its sequel.
Titan is set some 1,000 years from now and kicks off with a spectacular
opening sequence, where an alien race called The Dredge hover over Earth
with the intention of destroying our planet.  The Dredge don't mess
around like those pesky creatures from ID4.  They blow Earth up in all
of five seconds, sending chunks of it scattering around the solar system
like the lumps of loose stool in my toilet after a night of hearty
Mexican food and beer (hence the AE  for `After Earth').  Some of
Earth's humans manage to escape before The Dredge do their dirty work,
including a blond scamp named Cale (Alex D. Linz, Home Alone 3).  Cale's
father gives him a pat on the head and a gold ring, and tells him that
he'll see him in a few years.
Flash to fifteen years later, where an adult Cale (Matt Damon, The
Talented Mr. Ripley) is working as a space welder on a salvage station.
With most of Earth's inhabitants destroyed by The Dredge, humans are now
looked down on and bullied like members of a middle-school chess club.
One day, the Luke Skywalker-like Cale is approached by the Han Solo-like
Korso (Bill Pullman, Brokedown Palace), who tells him that he is the
only person in the galaxy that can determine the location of something
called the Titan Project, which is supposed to be humanity's only chance
at defeating The Dredge.
It turns out that Cale's ring, which he wears every day despite hating
his father for leaving him, is genetically encrypted and produces a map
revealing the location of the Titan (of course the magic ring appears on
his hand only when it's integral to the plot, and Cale never noticed the
little buttons on the inside that Korso presses to activate the stupid
thing).  Cale is reluctant at first, but eventually relents and joins
Korso in his search for the Titan.  Korso has a bunch of sidekicks,
including a super-genius turtle that sounds like Peter Lorre (John
Leguizamo, Summer of Sam), a gun-toting bad-ass (Nathan Lane, Isn't She
Great), something called Stith (Janeane Garofalo, 200 Cigarettes) and a
gorgeous brunette named Akima (Drew Barrymore, Never Been Kissed).
There are no surprises in Titan's script.  In fact, the only thing
remotely unexpected is how little the characters look like their
real-life counterparts.  I always thought that animators tried to make
their characters appear somewhat similar to the actors that provide
their voices.  Damon is the only one who comes close, but his Cale is a
dead-ringer for James Van Der Beek (I kept waiting for the Paula Cole
song to sneak up on me).  Pullman isn't close at all, and Barrymore's
character looks Asian, and even has an Asian-sounding name.  Lane would
probably burst into tears just from seeing a photograph of a gun, so the
idea of him playing his role is laughable.
I expected a lot more from Titan, especially considering the talent that
produced the script.  Three gifted writers (Joss Whedon, Buffy the
Vampire Slayer), John August (Go) and Ben Edlund (The Tick) churned out
a paint-by-numbers story with a really silly ending.  Their script was
based on a story by Randall McCormick (Speed 2: Cruise Control) and Hans
Bauer (Anaconda), which could explain a lot about the film's
crapulence.  I was looking forward to snappy dialogue and witty banter,
like from Buffy and Go, but there was precious little to enjoy.  I did
laugh out loud at the cheesy A-Teamesque montage of Cale and friends
repairing a dilapidated spaceship, but I don't think that's what
overrated directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman (Anastasia) were going
for.
So who exactly is supposed to want to see Titan?  The question is a
no-brainer, judging from the people that showed up for the advanced
screening.  The film is targeted to prepubescent boys and nerdy men that
still haven't seen a real live naked woman yet.  This is probably why
the plot features a jaded guy with floppy hair that doesn't fit in
socially and still manages to land an impossibly curvy girlfriend.  It's
also chock-full of songs from Powerman 5000, Lit, Luscious Jackson and a
plethora of other hot modern rock ballads.
1:34 - PG for action violence, brief language, an animated bare ass and
the implication that Cale has a boner in one scene

Review for Poketto monsutaa: Maboroshi no Pokemon X: Lugia bakudan (1999)
The amount of hate mail I received from people that took offense to my
review of the first Pokémon film was enough to choke a horse.  Here are
two of my favorites:
"Maybe you lack confidence in your point of view and have to secure it
by making jokes at the expense of the innocent, asshole."
"I hope that sometime during your worthless life that you experience a
trauma so severe that it causes you to become an epileptic."
Can you believe it?  What kind of monster would write such horrible
things to a guy who is just trying to make a living writing film
reviews?  All I did was suggest that Pokémon might be a good thing for
society because it has been known to give its viewers seizures and that
our ^Óherds^Ô needed some ^Óthinning.^Ô  No big deal, right?  It^Ňs not like
I^Ňm the one giving kids seizures.  So wipe the drool from the chins of
your zombified children and send your hate mail to the people that make
the stupid television show.
You^Ňd think I^Ňd launched a full-scale attack on an American classic from
the volumes of responses I received.  It wasn^Ňt Ben Hur, or Schindler^Ňs
List, or even Spaceballs.  We^Ňre talking about Pokémon.  You could put
100 monkeys in a room with 100 typewriters and not get a concept as bad
as Pokémon.  It shouldn^Ňt be possible to make something this immediately
unwatchable.  If your kids like Pokémon, there^Ňs probably something
really wrong with them.  Maybe you were too busy firing off e-mail to
film critics while Junior was guzzling the Drano under the kitchen sink.
I^Ňve learned a few more things about Pokémon since the first film, like
that each Pokémon can say nothing but its name.  This enabled me to
figure out that the name of the thing I called Turtle-Pokémon is
actually Squirtle.  I only mention this because we used the same name
for the kid on our high school track team who had a perpetual wet spot
that seeped through to the front of his sweat pants.
Like Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back, the new film begins with an awful
unaired episode of the television show called Pikachu^Ňs Rescue
Adventure.  Pikachu, if you remember, is the little yellow squeak-toy
owned by Pokémon master Ash.  In short, Pikachu rescues the
baby/star/egg Pokemon (just like in Mewtwo), as well as a cat hanging
Wily E. Coyote-style on a branch on the side of a cliff.  There was
supposed to be some kind of moral about accomplishing things through
teamwork, but it gets kind of lost through the bad animation and stupid
little noises that each creature makes.
Pokémon 2000 concerns an evil Pokémon master that is trying to collect
three rare Pokemon in an attempt to unlock great treasures.  Ash and his
friends also set off in search of the same uncommon Pokémon after
crashing their boat into a remote island and having the natives mistake
him for ^Óthe chosen one.^Ô  I had my fingers crossed that Ash would end
up on an island populated by flesh-eating head-hunters, or perhaps an
overweight homosexual exhibitionist and a grumpy homophobic ex-Navy
Seal, but things just didn^Ňt pan out for me.
Pokémon 2000 is probably a little more visually pleasing than Mewtwo,
just from a few scenes that offer computer-generated animation (all of
which seemed way too similar to the video game ^ÓMyst^Ô).    But you
should not take that statement as a ringing endorsement, or even as a
suggestion that you take your sticky little brats to see it.  Scary
Movie is a better family film.
On a humorous note, the translation of the Japanese title of Pokémon
2000 (Poketto monsutaa: Maboroshi no Pokemon X: Lugia bakudan) is The
Phantom Pokemon: Lugia's Explosive Birth.  Now that^Ňs entertainment.

Review for American Nightmare, The (2000)
Premiering on the Independent Film Channel, The American Nightmare is a
delightful documentary about the genesis of modern horror movies.  The
film consists of interviews with the creators of these groundbreaking
films, as well as clips that will make you laugh out loud at how far
special effects have come since the Johnson administration.
Beginning with George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead in 1968,
Nightmare traces a decade-long path taken by numerous film rebels, like
John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper and David Cronenberg.  Most
interesting is the interview with special effects guru Tom Savini, who
learned everything he needed to know about graphic wounds in Viet Nam.
The only thing the film really could have used was an adrenaline shot in
the form of American Movie's Mark Borchardt.
Nightmare, which showed as part of this year's `Midnight Madness'
program at the Toronto International Film Festival, was directed by Adam
Simon (he also helmed 1990's Brain Dead with Bills Pullman and Paxton).
Never mind the fact it's the fifth movie in the last couple of years to
begin with the word  `American' (Beauty, Movie, Pie, Psycho, History X,
and Woman) - Nightmare shows the parallels between horror flicks and the
social topics of the time, like Kent State, Viet Nam and the civil
rights movement.
And you thought they were all just about deranged slashers and
brain-eating zombies.

Title
Review for Bringing Out the Dead (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
During the first few minutes of Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead,
you can't help thinking about the director's 1976 masterpiece Taxi
Driver.  The main character narrates the film from his job of driving
through the streets of New York City to music eerily similar to Bernard
Herrmann's Oscar-nominated score.  Although we are told that Dead is set
in the early 1990s, it becomes clear pretty quickly that not much has
changed in New York since 1976.
Nicolas Cage (8mm) stars as Frank Pierce, an Emergency Medical Services
driver from Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy Hospital (or `Misery,' for
short) in Hell's Kitchen.  He's an insomniac and an alcoholic, a man
that has clearly lost his way since failing to save an asthmatic
16-year-old girl six months ago.  Everywhere he turns, Frank sees the
dead teen and hears her ask why he didn't rescue her.  Subsequently,
Frank has lost each of his patients since then and is desperate to find
a soul to save.  He admits that his role is `less about saving lives
than about bearing witness.'  He's probably a blast at parties.
At first, Frank is paired with Larry (John Goodman, The Big Lebowski), a
goofy ox that seems more concerned with his next meal than his next
patient.  After receiving a call from Dispatch (the voice is
Scorsese's), the two lackadaisically trudge up to the top floor of an
apartment building where an elderly man has suffered a severe heart
attack.  The man is clearly dead when they arrive, and Larry uses the
phone to call a doctor in order to get an official pronouncement of
death.  Frank continues to perform lifesaving techniques and is
eventually able to get a pulse.  It is here that Frank meets Mary Burke
(Patricia Arquette, Stigmata), the old man's comely daughter.
Frank and Larry drive the victim to Misery, and as they open its
emergency room doors they reveal an ER from hell.  There are more freaks
there than at a Jeff Foxworthy family reunion.  And it's not just the
cases  a crazy security guard threatens people trying to get help and a
nurse asks people to leave and die in another city.  Misery is on
diversion and refusing new admissions because of a rash of overdoses
resulting from a new street drug called Red Death.  But doctors
reluctantly agree to take the elderly patient from Frank and Larry.
The next night, Frank is paired with Marcus (Ving Rhames, Entrapment), a
religious man that tries in vain to pick up the female dispatcher (the
voice of Queen Latifah).  Marcus has a considerably more upbeat outlook
on life and tells Frank, `Help someone and you help yourself.'  The
problem is that Frank can't find anyone to help and hasn't been able to
for quite a while.  This line also evokes Taxi Driver's Wizard (Peter
Boyle) telling his co-worker Travis Bickle `You get a job. You become
the job.'  Their evening's shift is complete after witnessing the birth
of an Immaculate Conception and a resurrection.
As Frank drives around the depravity of New York's nighttime streets,
more of Taxi Driver's lines come to mind. `Someday a real rain will come
and wipe this scum off the streets.' `I think someone should just take
this city and just flush it down the f'in' toilet.'  And, probably most
fitting for our crazy insomniac, `The days go on and on.  They don't
end.  All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go. I don't believe
that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention; I believe that
one should become a person like other people.'
We slowly learn that Frank isn't much different than the junkies and
wackos he is supposed to be helping.  One schizophrenic man named Noel
(Marc Anthony, Big Night) wants to die but can't muster the courage to
off himself.  Like Noel, Frank wants to be fired from his job, but can't
quite quit on his own and resorts to frequently coming in late and
calling in sick in hopes of getting the boot.  Ultimately, in an ironic
turn, Frank is finally able to help someone, but his services are
rendered in a less-than-routine fashion.  The whole story takes place
over a span of three days.
Although Dead looks more like an Oliver Stone flick, comparisons to Taxi
Driver shouldn't come as a surprise.  Screenwriter Paul Schrader also
worked on Scorsese's Raging Bull and The Last Temptation of Christ in
addition to Taxi Driver.  He adapted this script from the 1998 Joe
Connelly novel of the same name (Connelly was actually a medic for nine
years in New York).  Dead looks great and is brightly lensed by Robert
Richardson (The Horse Whisperer), with Scorsese's regular editor (Thelma
Schoonmaker) and production designer (Dante Ferretti) adding to the
fantastic appearance.  But the film is very uneven and leads Cage and
Arquette are really bad actors.  It seems like Cage is getting all of
the roles that Bruce Willis used to take, as he continues to demonstrate
that his Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas was a big fluke.  I think a movie
about Marcus or psycho ambulance driver Tom Walls (Tom Sizemore, Saving
Private Ryan) would have been more interesting.

Review for Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Saying Lara Croft: Tomb Raider is the best film to ever be adapted from a
video game isn't really that much of a compliment.  There have been too many
Wing Commanders and Double Dragons to make that statement mean anything at
all.  Here's the skinny:  Tomb Raider is a blast and will likely be one of
the summer's better action films.  Sure, it makes less sense than Swordfish,
and when its over-the-top action isn't at full-throttle, the flick is kind
of a bore.  But does any of that matter when Angelina Jolie gets to wear so
many cute outfits?
Jolie (Gone in 60 Seconds) stars as the titular Lady Lara Croft (with the
emphasis on "titular"), a wealthy Brit with a knack for busting into tombs
Indiana Jones-style.  Her mum is dead, and her treasure-hunting father
(Pearl Harbor's Jon Voight, Jolie's real-life dad) has been missing for 15
years. Lara is a little like Bruce Wayne, in that she lives in a giant
mansion, complete with a doting butler (Chris Barrie), and lives somewhat of
a double life.  Tomb Raider's first scene establishes Lara as a major-league
ass-kicker, complete with a penchant for John Woo-esque double-fisted
gunplay as she battles an insect-like robot that turns out to be a training
device created by her chum Bryce (Shine's Noah Taylor, who is basically
playing an Aussie Seth Green).
Without going too much into the plot for a couple reasons (one, it barely
matters; and two, I still don't understand most of it), Tomb Raider revolves
around a rare astrological event in which all nine planets of our solar
system align and create a total solar eclipse.  The blackout, which only
happens once every 5,000 years, allows the world access to a magical
triangle with an all-seeing eye that gives its possessor the ability to
manipulate time. The catch is that several years ago, the triangle was
broken into two pieces and hidden at opposite ends of the earth to keep it
from falling into the hands of an evil madman.  Coincidentally, a group of
evil madmen called the Illuminati (led by a guy named Richard Johnson...no
joke) is after the triangle pieces to, presumably, do some really bad stuff.
Manfred Powell (Iain Glen) is put in charge of finding the triangle and
returning it to the Illuminati.
Lara gets dragged into the whole thing when she begins to find clues left
behind by her dead dad (one involves - get this - a mysterious clock hidden
inside another clock hidden under the stairs).  Powell and his band of
soldiers bust into Lara's pad and steal the clock, but not until we're
treated to a nifty action sequence involving Ms. Croft, a pair of white
pajamas (with only the top button done) and a bungee cord, which enables her
to fly around like Zhang Ziyi while she's cracking skulls.
She's flying through the air.  She's sporting a buff British accent.  She's
riding motorcycles.  She's even taking a shower!  Is there anything this
girl can't do?  Jolie even looks like Lara a few times, and did I mention
she gets to wear a bunch of cute outfits, to boot?  And as silly and
implausible as most of the action was in Tomb Raider, I never once rolled my
eyes and said, "Cripes, there's no way she could have done that."  Is she an
Indiana Jones rip-off?  You bet, but Indy never looked this good when he was
covered in sweat.
Tomb Raider is full of the things that made Raiders of the Lost Ark a cool
ride.  There are plenty of booby-trapped tombs (emphasis on "booby"), secret
doors and the like.  There are a couple of scenes that make Ark's giant
boulder look downright laughable at this point.  Plus, like Indy, Lara has a
really old father who used to be an actor, like, a hundred years ago.
There are negatives, though.  The action-packed peaks are wonderful, but the
valleys are atrocious.  Glen is the least threatening bad guy since Dougray
Scott stunk up the joint in M:I-2, and he's practically interchangeable with
Daniel Craig (I Dreamed of Africa), who plays another treasure hunter (and
I'm still not sure if he was a good guy or a bad guy).  Tomb Raider is also
packed full of product placement, which will always result in a lower
overall rating (except with Wayne's World).
Tomb Raider was directed by The General's Daughter's Simon West and written
by a hodgepodge of scribes; most of them are rookies, but two penned the
equally far-fetched but totally enjoyable Face/Off.

Review for Crazy in Alabama (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Antonio Banderas' directorial debut is surprisingly solid as he
assembles an eclectic cast in an adaptation of Mark Childress' novel of
the same name.  Banderas has wisely chosen material that isn't
autobiographical for his first feature, eliminating concern that Crazy
in Alabama would be like the work of other actor-turned-directors, most
recently Frank Whaley's Joe the King. Alabama features two odd plots
that are tied together with a big courtroom finale and one central
character.
Set in the summer of 1965, Alabama is narrated by Peejoe (Lucas Black,
Slingblade)  short for Peter Joseph  a young boy in a small town that
still hasn't been notified of the Emancipation Proclamation.  As the
film opens, his oddball Aunt Lucille (Melanie Griffith, Another Day in
Paradise) tells Peejoe that she has killed her husband of thirteen years
and father of her seven children.  Lucille used rat poison to kill her
victim  because `that's what you use when you want to kill a rat' 
before decapitating him with an electric knife and leaving his remains
in a basement freezer as she squeals out of town to the strains of
`These Boots are Made for Walking.'  She is an aspiring actress who
dreams of landing a gig on Bewitched and heads for Los Angeles to pursue
her unlikely goal.
Peejoe, who had previously lived with his Aunt Lucille, is shipped off
to live with his Uncle Dove (David Morse, The Negotiator), a soft-spoken
funeral director.  As summer heats up, so does the tension in the still
racially segregated small town.  Peejoe witnesses the murder of a black
youth that had merely used the white-only pool facilities.  The fact
that the murder was committed by Sheriff John Doggett (Meat Loaf, Fight
Club) inspires Peejoe to speak out publicly about racial injustice.
Black couldn't look more like a hillbilly, but Peejoe has a perpetual
look of surprise when he watches the actions of his community.
Although the film seems a little choppy at first because of the
transition between the racism and Lucille plots, the picture is very
well paced.  One storyline takes a depressing look at an ugly portion of
American history and the other is almost like a fable, with Lucille
stealing a car in New Orleans, busting out of jail in Texas, breaking
the bank in Las Vegas and eventually hitting it big in Hollywood.  The
big courtroom finale that ties the two together is pretty well done,
with only Griffith's weepy monologue seeming a bit too much.  The judge
is played by Rod Steiger, who was either drunk or had never seen his
lines before.  Another possibility for his odd acting was that Banderas
filmed a rehearsal without Stieger's knowledge.
Griffiths does quite a decent job tackling the role of Lucille.  With
her long legs, black hair, big red lips and blue eyes she looks like she
could be the mother of Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron, if they were
sisters (and wouldn't you have loved to live next door to that family).
Her Lucille is plagued by the voice of her decapitated husband
throughout the film, most likely on account of carrying his head around
in a hat box the entire time. Cathy Moriarty (Gloria), Richard Schiff
(The West Wing), John Beasley (The General's Daughter), Robert Wagner
(Austin Powers) and Noah Emmerich (The Truman Show) round out this
bizarre cast.

situations

Title
Review for Harry, un ami qui vous veut du bien (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Have you ever been out in public and encountered somebody who knows you, yet
you don't have a clue who the heck they are?  You know, you just play along
until, hopefully, they go away?  That's the basic gist of the new French
thriller, Harry, He's Here to Help.  It's creepy and unnerving when
contrasted with Hannibal's campy gore,
Harry begins with a scene that could be a flashback to every awful family
car trip you've ever been on, meaning it's hot, cramped and there's a whole
lot of yelling and bickering.  In a rest stop men's room, Michel (Laurent
Lucas) notices a man grinning at him as he enjoys a few moments of relief
from the long, sweaty trip to his family's rundown vacation home.  The man
introduces himself as Harry Balestrero (Sergi López, An Affair of Love), a
former grade-school classmate that Michel just can't remember.  After
rattling off the names of a few of their mutual classmates, Michel becomes
convinced he knows Harry, and the two men shake hands and head for their
cars.
In the parking lot, Harry and his curvy girlfriend Prune (Sophie Guillemin)
offer to take Michel and his wife Claire (Mathilde Seigner, Venus Beauty
Institute) out for drinks.  Michel and Claire decline, as their three young
daughters are just too worn out, but since their well-to-do counterparts
seem to be aimlessly wandering around Europe with no time constraints, the
two couples decide to meet at Michel's fixer-upper.
After they've had a few drinks, Harry brings up the topic of poetry and
astonishes his hosts by reciting, word for word, a poem called "The Dagger
in the Skin of Night" that Michel wrote as a child.  As if that weren't
enough, he begins to narrate passages from the first chapter of a novel
(called "Flying Monkeys") that Michel abandoned as an elementary school
writer.  Michel and Claire are taken aback, but since Harry seems to be a
nice, honest man, they seem to brush the incident aside.
Long story short, Harry begins to act more and more strangely, buying Michel
and Claire a brand-new SUV and partaking in some bizarre post-coital eating
rituals as he slowly worms his way into their lives.  He's a cross between a
slightly more bent Tom Ripley (as in The Talented Mr.) and a much more
intelligent Buck (as in Chuck and).  Harry is a film that could be set
anywhere and feature any kind of protagonist, but it works so much better
when you introduce a malevolent character into the life of a young, married
couple (kids optional) at just the right time, and watch the sparks fly (a
la Pacific Heights).  López is great as Harry, exuding the same silent type
of lunacy that Bob Hoskins perfected in Felicia's Journey.  Lucas and
Seigner are both very likeable, thereby doing their jobs in creating
characters that viewers can root for.
To say Harry is Hitchcockian might be the understatement of the year.
Harry's character gets its name from two of Hitch's '50s flicks - The
Trouble With Harry and The Wrong Man, where Henry Fonda played Manny
Balestrero. The story brings to mind another '50s classic from Hitchcock -
Strangers on a Train, which was based on a novel written by Patricia
Highsmith.  She also penned Ripley, so it comes as no surprise that Harry,
Ripley and Strangers' Bruno Antony are all smooth, charming sociopaths that
immediately rub you the wrong way despite not doing anything to warrant such
feelings (and their names all end in the letter "y," so you know the Puffy
jury really blew it).
Writer/director Dominik Moll, who, together with Criminal Lovers' François
Ozon, has made France the new creepy capital of the world (well, second to
that rest stop I just visited in Lodi, Ohio), has fashioned an outstanding
second feature after working as an assistant director on Laurent Cantet's
Human Resources.  The brightly photographed Harry also shares a
cinematographer (Matthieu Poirot-Delpech) and co-writer (Gilles Marchand)
with the drab but entertaining Resources.  López, Moll and the film's
editing (by The Dreamlife of Angels' Yannick Kergoat) and sound all won
César Awards (the film was nominated in just about every other category, as
well).
1:55 - R for language, some violence and a scene of nudity

Review for 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
Surely you've already heard that Hollywood has run out of original
ideas.  So you shouldn't be surprised that the sharpest and most
successful films recently released are classic novels or plays reworked
into modern settings with young stars, preferably from popular
television shows.  It started with Clueless (Austen's `Emma') a few
years back.  Then there was William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet.  So
far this year we've had She's All That (Shaw's `Pygmalion') and Cruel
Intentions (de Laclos' `Dangerous Liaisons').  And don't forget new
version of Shakespeare's `Othello' and `Hamlet' due later this year, as
well as a more traditional rendition of `A Midsummer Night's Dream.'
10 Things is essentially Shakespeare's `The Taming of the Shrew' set in
present-day America.  It's about two sisters  one popular (Larisa
Oleynik, The Secret World of Alex Mack) and one dubbed `a heinous bitch'
by her peers (Julia Stiles, The Devil's Own).  Like the play, they are
respectively named Bianca and Kat(e) and they live in a town called
Padua.  Bianca has many suitors, but isn't allowed to go out with boys
until her older sister is ready to date.
Enter new Padua High student Cameron (Joseph-Gordon Levitt, 3rd Rock
>From the Sun) who instantly falls for the pasty Bianca and cooks up a
plan to persuade popular jock Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) to pay the
school psycho to date Kat.  Of course, he's not really a psycho; he's
just misunderstood because he has long hair, wears dark-colored clothes
and works in the metal shop.  His name is Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger,
Roar), and he quickly realizes that taming this shrew might be a lot
more difficult than he had originally thought.
The script is surprisingly witty and filled with razor-sharp barbs
hurled from just about every character.  And that's pretty shocking,
considering it came from a writing duo (Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten
Smith) with no previous screenplay experience.  While avoiding an `R'
rating, they manage to weave a tapestry of near-obscenities that will
make even the most cynically jaded adult chuckle just as loud as the
pre-teens that this film's marketing campaign will target.  Particularly
funny are Padua's English teacher (Daryl Mitchell, Veronica's Closet)
and guidance counselor (Allison Janney, Private Parts).  (1:38  PG-13
for some mild adult language and situations)

Title
Review for Bachelor, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Buster Keaton's 1925 film Seven Chances is given a lifeless update in
this vapid vehicle that is as grating as its two acting leads.  Here,
Chris O'Donnell stars as a young bachelor that is forced to quickly find
a bride in order to cash in on a huge inheritance.  It plays like a bad
series finale of a bad television sitcom, but unfortunately it is not.
A sitcom would at least have the good taste to limit itself to
twenty-five minutes.
O'Donnell (Cookie's Fortune) plays Jimmie Shannon, the
twenty-six-year-old owner of a billiard table manufacturer in San
Francisco.  Shannon narrates the beginning of the film, equating single
men with wild and untamed stallions that like a wide variety of grass
patches.  We watch as he dumps his current filly at lunch; while, in the
next booth, a curly-haired girl tells her sister that she has ended her
relationship, too.  The girl is a professional photographer named Ann
(Renée Zellweger, One True Thing), and she immediately hits it off with
Jimmie.
Their relationship progresses so easily that Jimmie and Ann even miss
their one-year anniversary.  That's just the kind of relationship it
is.  But Jimmie grows uneasy as he watches all of his single friends
succumb to marriage.  There's even a funny bit that intertwines clips of
nervous men during a wedding bouquet toss and footage of stallions being
lassoed.  Eventually, Ann is the only single girl left over the age of
twelve and catches a prophetic bouquet.
After three years of dating, Jimmie pops the question to Ann after a
romantic dinner at The Starlight Room, but awkwardly fumbles through the
proposal to his horrified girlfriend, who ditches him and runs home and
reveals to her sister/roommate, `All I wanted was for him to do it right
and he didn't, and that says everything.'  This one line represents
everything that is wrong with females today.  They wait their whole
lives for this moment, and if it doesn't go down like they've dreamed,
they turn into wicked, vindictive shrews.  Of course, Jimmie's
grass-eating-stallion analogy wasn't exactly classy, either.  How are we
supposed to feel anything for these characters?
Jimmie's failed proposal attempt becomes an instant urban legend and
results in the death of his grandfather, who we learn has amassed a $100
million fortune that will be left to Jimmie, but only if he meets the
following requirements:
1. He must marry by 6:05 PM on his 30th birthday
2. He must stay married for at least ten years
3. He must live under the same roof as his wife and spend no more than
one night per month apart
4. He must produce a child within five years
The catch is that he turns thirty the following day and, to make matters
worse, Ann takes off for a three-week assignment in Athens.  So Jimmie
desperately begins proposing to every girl he has ever dated, including
a cop, a student, a commodities trader and an opera singer (Mariah
Carey) to no avail.  And when his best friend Marco (Artie Lange, Mad
TV) places a personal ad in the newspaper for brides, things begin to
speed out of control.
Although the film opens promisingly with David Byrne covering Cole
Porter's `Don't Fence Me In,' The Bachelor quickly becomes tedious and
mundane.  James Cromwell is completely wasted as a priest that follows
Jimmie around waiting to perform the wedding ceremony.  Hal Holbrook
also has a role in the film and  get this  has a fifteen-year-old
daughter.  O'Donnell's character is so underdeveloped that we never
learn how he came into the family's billiard business.  We learn his dad
was crushed when a building collapsed on him, but where is his mom?
And how does Zellweger luck into these roles where studly men are forced
into professing their love for her?  I half-expected a `you complete me'
line to come flying out of O'Donnell's maw.  But I might believe it if
the girl slapped on some lipstick.  The only way I can justify this is
to believe that her characters are sexually deviant, but this is even a
stretch.  She looks like the type that complains when you're on her
hair.  I wanted to choke her repeatedly, but feared that could actually
make her voice even raspier if I failed to finish her off.  She made me
wish that The Bachelor was a silent film, like Seven Chances.
I've got a much better idea for a script.  Have Jimmie move in with
Marco, who would divorce his wife and let Jimmie marry her in exchange
for a chunk of the inheritance.  Jimmie could live in a spare bedroom or
the basement and impregnate Marco's gal via in-vitro fertilization,
while she still technically remains Marco's gal.  Then, after the baby
is born and the film ends, the film can spin-off into a television
sitcom where the three try to survive their cramped quarters and bitter
feelings until the inheritance check is delivered.
Although The Bachelor is rated PG-13, there is one moment where someone
shouts `scum-sucker,' but it was obviously dubbed over a dirtier kind of
`sucker.'  I think there were also a couple of `f-word' cover-ups.
Parents of lip-reading children  beware.  Actually, everyone should be
wary of this movie.

Review for Ravenous (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
Let's see  a period piece about cannibalism with no bankable stars,
filmed almost entirely in Slovakia and the Czech Republic by an arthouse
director (Antonia Bird, Priest) - I could see why Fox would bankroll a
project like that.  The film is set in pre-Civil war America, where
Capt. John Boyd (Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential) has just been honored by
his commanding officer for infiltrating enemy lines during the
Mexican-American war.  Little do they all know, Boyd is really a
yellow-bellied coward who played dead while his platoon was wiped out by
the feisty Mexicans.
Boyd is assigned to Fort Spencer, which is located in the Sierra Nevada
mountains of California.  Upon his arrival, he finds a wacky group of
soldiers  a drunk, a Bible-thumper, a pot-head, a hot-head, two Indians
and Ferris Bueller's principal.  Then one night, they find a strange
settler (Robert Carlyle, The Full Monty) who tells a ghastly story of
being caught in a blizzard and having to share a cave with a blood
thirsty man-eater, who slowly killed and ate the other members of his
party.  Intent on bringing this savage to justice, the military men set
out to find his cavebut is the stranger's story true or is it all just
a trick to lead them into a big, black pot filled with onions and
carrots?
Pearce is fantastic, despite having few lines, and comes off as a cross
between Dead Man Johnny Depp and Legends of the Fall Brad Pitt.  Carlyle
really sinks his teeth into his meaty role, making a real meal of it
(sorry).  Ravenous also features both breathtaking views and a creepy
score from Michael Nyman (Gattaca, The Piano), but is definitely not for
the faint of heart. (R  1:40 for extreme violence, gore, adult language
and cannibalism)

Title
Review for Fast and the Furious, The (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Poorly written, badly acted, completely stupid, but never once boring, The
Fast and the Furious has accomplished more entertainment-wise than Driven or
Gone in 60 Seconds could ever fathom (and it did so with considerably less
money and virtually no star power).  Any film about a gaggle of car-racing
buffoons immediately starts out in the hole as far as I'm concerned, but
with the popularity of the NASCAR thing, it's likely we'll get more racing
pictures shoved down our throats for a few more years (until the inbreeding
wipes the fans out).  But if they're all as fun as Furious, I say bring 'em
on.
Furious is set in and around the street-racing district of Los Angeles and
begins with a nicely staged truck heist, in which three cars and a harpoon
gun are able to procure a ton of stereo and television equipment from an
18-wheeler.  The truck-jackings are happening with increasing regularity,
which catches the eye of local police and the FBI, who send a dreamy,
blond-haired, blue-eyed boy undercover into the world of muscle cars and
monkey wrenches.
The cop is Brian Spindler (Paul Walker, The Skulls), and although we don't
know he's a cop at first, anyone with minimal brain activity will be able to
figure it out.  Brian decides to infiltrate the inner circle of LA's racing
kingpin - one Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, Pitch Black) - by sniffing around
the convenience store he runs with his younger sister, Mia (Jordana
Brewster, The Faculty), who seems to be receiving the majority of Brian's
sniffing. To show how painfully un-street Brian is, the script has him order
a tuna sandwich on white bread, with the crusts cut off, no less.  He also
lands a job at a high-end auto parts store in the racing district.
After a testosterone-bathed scene that depicts him earning his street cred
and the respect of Dominic, Brian is accepted into the in-crowd, which
includes, but is not limited to, characters played by October Sky's Chad
Lindberg, Get Carter's Johnny Strong and Girlfight's Michelle Rodriguez, the
latter of whom could probably kick the crap out of any of Furious' men.  The
scene also features a shot of Diesel running down the street at the speed of
a glacier.  Brian provides reports back to his boss (Silence of the Lambs'
dick-tucker Ted Levine) and an FBI suit (Thom Barry), neither of whom are
happy with the progress of the case.  But none of it seems to stop Brian
from flashing those blue eyes and pearly whites.  One might even get the
impression he's mildly retarded.
But the plot barely matters here.  It's all about the cars and the driving
scenes.  Heck, even the girls (even the unattractive ones, like Brewster)
have spoilers of their own.  Laugh, if you must, at the gearheads
inconspicuously traveling everywhere in packs of juiced cars.  It looks
cool, so it doesn't have to make sense. Come to think of it, I think that's
how we ended up with our President.
Diesel, who is a horrible actor but has somehow managed to land in three
underachieving films with decent buzz (like Boiler Room), logs in his
career-best at overacting (and that's quite an achievement).  Walker is eye
candy, and it looks like he could have been one of the sons on Home
Improvement, or maybe in one of the incarnations of Saved By the Bell, or,
at minimum, Mark-Paul Gosselaar's inevitable replacement on NYPD Blue for
the 2002/2003 season. Snow Falling on Cedars' Rick Yune plays The Bad Asian
Guy, and MTV tough-guy Ja Rule makes an appearance, too.  Yay!
Furious contains some of the worst dialogue ever written, and I'm saying
this less than two months after seeing Driven.  The highlight is Dominic's
elegant soliloquy, in which he bravely utters the line, "I live my life a
quarter-mile at a time."  Straight up, D?  That little gem, and all the
others, come courtesy of Gary Scott Thompson (Hollow Man), David Ayer
(U-571) and newcomer Erik Bergquist.  Furious was directed by Rob Cohen, who
recently directed Walker in The Skulls.

Title
Review for Planet of the Apes (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
As cheesy as the original Planet of the Apes film is, it sets a pretty high
cinematic bar.  It'd be easy to outdo the special effects and best the
acting, but tackling the infamous Statue of Liberty ending is an entirely
different story.  Duplicating or removing it would be a cop-out, and
changing it virtually guarantees the new version won't be any good (it'd be
like making Rosebud a woman in a Citizen Kane remake).
While the new ending is a little clunky (and a lot predictable), director
Tim Burton does, for the most part, a pretty decent job with his
"revisitation" of Apes.  It's probably the most un-Burton-esque film he has
made, relying more on special effects, makeup and costume than his typically
stunning visual presentation.  Apes is a rare remake that is shorter than
its predecessor, and one that doesn't cast actors from the
original...because most of them are dead (aside from Charlton Heston, who is
dead only between his ears, and makes a brief appearance here).  There are
enough differences to make this film unique (for better or for worse), but
it's also similar enough to avoid sending diehard Ape fans into nerd comas.
Apes opens in 2029 inside a research station just outside Saturn.  Mark
Wahlberg (The Perfect Storm) plays Leo Davidson, a pilot chomping at the bit
to fly into an electrical storm (didn't Wahlberg learn to stay away from
storms last summer?), but a space chimp is tapped to make the journey before
any human lives are risked.  When the monkey's pod disappears, Leo takes off
after it, despite the orders to stop from his commanding officer.  Sure
enough, Leo's pod vanishes into a Contact-like wormhole that spits him out
several hundred years later as he crashes into a strange planet ruled by
apes.
Like the first film, there are humans on the planet, but they can talk and
have more interaction with their monkey overlords, who act a lot more simian
than they did in the original.  Some humans are slaves, some are kept as
pets and some have even been molded into butlers, but the apes are firmly in
control of things despite their apparent lack of ability to invent stuff
beyond rudimentary weapons and armor.  There are no guns, no doctors and
generally no knowledge of what lies over the mountain in The Forbidden Zone.
While Wahlberg's Leo is clearly crafted in the same mold as Charlton
Heston's Colonel Taylor, the only ape character that makes the evolutionary
leap from 1968 to 2001 is Ari, played by Fight Club's Helena Bonham Carter
(her ancestor was Dr. Zira, which is almost Ari spelled backward).  Ari, the
rebellious daughter of a senator and the ex-lover of the evil General Thade
(Tim Roth, Lucky Numbers), leads the Human Rights Faction and, for some
reason, develops an instant bond with Leo.
With a few exceptions, the second act follows the original film pretty
closely and finds Leo, his hot human squeeze (Estella Warren, Driven), Ari
and a handful of others trying to make it into The Forbidden Zone while
being chased by the gorilla army (led by Michael Clarke Duncan, See Spot
Run). But as things degenerate into Braveheart (Apeheart?) or, worse yet,
The 13th Warrior, it becomes clear this film is working its way to a more
upbeat resolution, which kind of blows, and, coming from Burton, is just
plain disappointing.  Yeah, there's a twist, but you can see it coming from
a mile away (assuming you know how the first film ended).
One major improvement in the film is the appearance of the apes.  Rick
Baker's (Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas) creatures look amazing
and can show much more emotion in their faces.  But nearly all of the apes
sound like a bunch of people with fake teeth awkwardly jammed into their
mouths (which is what they all are, but still).  Another minor effects
complaint is the over-the-top jumping skills of the chimps.  I can overlook
the fact that it's preposterous, but the editing of these scenes leaves a
little to be desired.  You never once see a clean landing, instead getting a
jumpy edit. It's like throwing a dummy off a cliff and then having an actor
pop into the shot from the bottom.
Apes, based on Pierre Boulle's novel, only scratches the surface of the
complex racial issues and battles over religion versus science that made the
first film such a treat.  The screenplay, from William Broyles, Jr. (Cast
Away), Lawrence Konner and Mark D. Rosenthal (Mighty Joe Young), does riff
on a few of the original's more popular lines, and includes more children
and teenage characters, both ape and human.  What's more amazing is the
inclusion of a swimming scene for Warren, who got to breaststroke in Driven,
too (she used to be a synchronized swimmer).
Maybe it's because half of the actors were buried under latex (or because
there's no Johnny Depp), but Apes seems like Burton's least actor-driven
film.  There's no weird cross-species chemistry between Wahlberg and Bonham
Carter, but there isn't any between him and Warren, either.  Roth sounds
nothing like himself but becomes a wonderful snarling antagonist.  If chimps
had moustaches, he'd be twirling his.  Danny Elfman's (Proof of Life) score
reaches its peak during the opening credits, never factors into the rest of
the film, and never equals the unmistakable power of Jerry Goldsmith's
original.
1:47 - PG-13 for some sequences of action/violence

Review for Jing ke ci qin wang (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Chen Kaige's (Farewell My Concubine) latest film has a lot going for
it.  This gorgeous, sweeping epic is reportedly the most expensive Asian
film ever produced.  It won a technical award at the Cannes Film
Festival.  And it reunites Kaige with his Concubine and Temptress Moon
star Gong Li, one of Asia's greatest actresses.  But despite this, The
Emperor & The Assassin is still a tough sell because of its running time
and its subject matter  a nearly three-hour film about political
turmoil in 3rd century B.C. China.  And it ain't in English either.
Doesn't exactly scream crowd-pleaser, does it?
According to history, there was a 200-year period of unrest between the
many kingdoms that composed China.  There were seven major territories,
with the strongest, called Qin, ruled by Ying Zheng (Li Xuejian, The
Blue Kite).  Ying was fixated on the unification of the Chinese
territories so that he could rule the cohesive land as its first
Emperor.  He destroyed everything he viewed as a potential obstacle,
slowly conquering the other kingdoms and eventually realizing his goal.
But Ying died only one year into his reign, and his Qin dynasty
dissolved within nine years, leaving the original Emperor a casualty of
his own ambition and voracity.
The film, which is divided into five acts, focuses on Ying's attempt to
defeat China's other states without appearing ravenously bloodthirsty.
His concubine, Zhao (Li, Chinese Box) hatches a brilliant scheme
involving a phony assassination attempt on Ying, whose attempted
elimination would appear to be the doing of Yan, a neighboring kingdom
that has proven to be the biggest hurdle for his plans to integrate the
country.  But in the process of setting up the assassination, Ying
learns something about his ancestry that causes him to go unhinged,
killing anyone that could either know or find out his secret, as well as
turning against Zhao's native soil (which, just to be confusing, is also
called `Zhao').
Zhao, horrified at Ying's actions, is forced to support the Prince of
Yan (Sun Zhou), intending to make the phony assassination attempt on
Ying into a very real threat.  In Yan, she meets Jing Ke (Zhang Fengyi,
The Blue Kite), an ex-killer who returns to his brutal ways in order to
help Zhao.  The double-crossing is reminiscent of Shakespeare, while the
surprise heritage is suggestive of Star Wars.
Kaige's direction (he also wrote the script with Wang Peigong),
especially of the intensely gruesome battle scenes, is tremendous.
Cinematographer Fei Zhao (Sweet & Lowdown) bathes the film a warm light
and Li delivers her best performance in years.  Costumes and design
teams add to a top-notch production.

Review for Remember the Titans (2000)
Denzel Washington's latest picture is  surprise  another `Denzel
against the world' film.  In the last five years, the
forty-five-year-old actor has been in seven films where he has played
either a cop, a military man or the victim of some horrible racial
injustice.  In each of these films, Denzel's straight-laced character
has to fight an uphill battle against a seemingly insurmountable force.
It's getting pretty tired.  Aren't there any juicy bad guy roles he can
play?
Luckily, Denzel's fondness for tackling only likeable roles doesn't
hamper his latest picture too badly.  In Remember the Titans, which was
based on a true story, Mr. Washington plays the head football coach of a
recently integrated school in the early seventies.  He has to contend
with the bigoted crackers in his new town, as well as his racially
divided team.
Set in Alexandria, Virginia in summer of 1971, Titans begins be showing
the racial tension caused by recent laws forbidding segregation.  For
the upcoming school year, Alexandria combined three local high schools
into one new integrated location  T.C. Williams High.  Coach Boone
(Washington, The Hurricane), who was a winning football instructor in
North Carolina, was reassigned to T.C. William's head coaching position
by the local school board (how a local school board can reassign a coach
from a different state is beyond me).
Coach Yoast (Will Patton, Gone in 60 Seconds) is the lame duck coach of
the T.C. William Titans (how a new school can have an existing coach is
also beyond me).  He's also a successful instructor of the game and a
beloved member of the community, but still loses his job to what must
have been one of the earliest cases of affirmative action.  It quickly
becomes clear that the football program will be a racially divided, with
Boone and the black players on one side, and Yoast and the white players
on the other.
But Coach Boone isn't just a football coach.  He's also an apparent
expert in race relations, who marched with Martin Luther King and stood
toe to toe with the Klan.  After an intensive summer training camp,
Boone has his Titan players begin working together as a team after
dividing them by offense and defense, instead of by race.  After weeks
of hating each other, the Titans inexplicably seem to unite over a
Marvin Gaye song and a contest where they rank out each other's moms.
When the school year finally starts, T.C. Williams is still bursting
with racial tension.  Coach Boone finds out that he'll be fired if he
loses one game, and the Titans begin their improbable run toward the
state championship.  Improbable, that is, if you've never seen an
inspirational sport film in your life.
Among the problems already listed above, it seemed odd for Titans to
never bring up Viet Nam.  The film has a really hokey epilogue, but I
guess you can't fault it if it's based on a true story.  Of the Titan
players, Donald Faison (Felicity) stands out as the loud-mouthed running
back-turned-defensive back.  Also of note is the performance of Hayden
Panettiere (The Guiding Light), who plays the precocious nine-year-old
daughter of Coach Yoast.  Washington and Patton capably handle their
roles, but there isn't much to them, other than a few funny one-liners.
Titans was directed by Boaz Yakin (A Price Above Rubies) and is the
writing debut of Gregory Allen Howard.  The film was produced by Jerry
Bruckheimer, who generally only makes big, noisy summer pictures that
make a ton of money.  Titans games scenes are pretty well-done, thanks
to the snappy editing of Philippe Rousselot (Random Hearts).  Yes'
Trevor Rabin (a Bruckheimer staple) provides an annoying, heavy-handed
score that lets you know when you're supposed to feel various emotions.

Review for Bone Collector, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Phillip Noyce's (The Saint) adaptation of Jeffrey Deaver's bestseller is
a clunky effort that could have been much better under a decent
director's care.  Denzel Washington stars as a decorated cop that became
paralyzed in the line of duty.  Bedridden, he tries to catch a serial
killer using an inexperienced female officer as his vessel to catch the
murderer in this sloppy whodunit.
Washington (The Siege) plays Lincoln Rhyme, who is not only a successful
New York City police officer but the author of several true-crime books
as well.  The film opens with Rhyme bravely trying to rescue a trapped
citizen, only to be hit with a falling hunk of metal that nearly cuts
him in half.  Four years later, Rhyme is still technically a member of
the police force, although he can move only his head, one shoulder and,
for some reason, the index finger of his right hand, which he uses to
operate several computers and televisions while he is confined to his
bed.  He also has seizures with increasing frequency and is terrified
that a big one could leave him like a vegetable.  Apparently he hasn't
seen himself act lately.
Meanwhile, the killer is a cabbie and each fare is a potential victim.
We see him pick up a ritzy white couple at the airport.  They want to go
to 5th Avenue, but instead he takes them into a desolate neighborhood
while they desperately try to escape from the backseat.  Couldn't they
call for help?  I'm thinking that the odds of picking up New Yorkers
without a cell phone are staggering, as is the likelihood of the
existence of that perfectly straight road he sped down with no lights,
stop signs, traffic or pedestrians.
The man's body is discovered by Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie, Pushing
Tin), a child-model-turned-beat-cop that plans to be transferred to the
less-exciting Youth Services Division.  The evidence she finds - white
powder, a newspaper clipping, a large bolt and a page number torn from a
book  are taken to Rhyme, where he is able to quickly determine the
exact time and place of the murderer's next act.  Unlikely?  You bet.
This is explained away by having Rhyme well-versed in the history of the
city.  Right.  And monkeys might fly out of my butt.
While confined to bed, Rhyme sends Donaghy to each crime scene as they
try to gain ground on the killer.  He instructs her in what evidence to
look for, relying on her eyes and ears as he tries to avoid having
control of the investigation wrestled away by Captain Howard Cheney
(Michael Rooker, The Replacement Killers).  At one point, Cheney is kept
at bay by Rhyme's live-in nurse Thelma (Queen Latifah, Living out
Loud).  Nurse Latifah is actually the acting high-point of Collector.
Washington is better than he has been lately, which isn't saying much.
I hear he's very good in The Hurricane, which arrives in theaters in
January, but I'll believe it when I see it.  Jolie isn't bad in her
role, but her attractiveness is almost distracting.  Other than her, the
other highlights are the dazzling overhead shots of New York City.  The
bland cast of co-stars include Ed O'Neill (Married with Children), Luis
Guzmán (OZ), Leland Orser (Very Bad Things) and Mike McGlone (She's the
One).  I'm sure the book was much better.
Comparisons to Silence of the Lambs will be inevitable, as the
experienced but immobile Washington guides the still-wet-behind-the-ears
Jolie to the murderer.  Instead, Collector seems more like See No Evil,
Hear No Evil, where a blind guy (Richard Pryor) and a deaf guy (Gene
Wilder) try to solve a murder.  Collector will likely be compared to
Se7en as well, but its staged murder scenes are not nearly as disturbing
as David Fincher's serial-killer benchmark.  Neither of these films
offered a red herring as poorly as in Collector.

Title
Review for Spy Kids (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Leave it to Robert Rodriguez to make a high-octane kiddie pic largely set in
Mexico and full of music straight from his Hollywood calling card, El
Mariachi.  If I had seen Spy Kids as a child, it would have blown my mind,
and it's easy to envision the sequel-ready blockbuster-to-be becoming a Star
Wars for today's grammar school crowd.
Kids is about a brother and sister who, unbeknownst to them, are the
offspring of two of the world's top secret agents.  The film opens with
mother Ingrid (Carla Gugino, Snake Eyes) telling young Carmen (Alexa Vega)
and Juni (Daryl Sabara) a bedtime story called "The Two Spies Who Fell in
Love."  The story, of course, is a non-fictional account of how she and
husband Gregorio (Antonio Banderas, Play It To the Bone) met, fell in love
and decided to trade in a life of espionage for parenting.  They've been out
of the spy game for years but still maintain old contacts and keep up on the
latest international terrorist news.
Meanwhile, the star of a children's Teletubby-ish TV show is threatening to
wreak havoc on the world (what would a spy film be without a guy like
this?).  It seems that Floop (Alan Cumming, Get Carter), the star of
"Floop's Fooglies," has been capturing spies and turning them into mutants
for his show.  His goal, apparently, is to create a race of atomic
super-robots that he will use to do his bidding.  Floop has a sidekick named
Minion (Tony Shalhoub, Galaxy Quest) who is the real brains of the
operation - a Sideshow Bob, if you will, to Floop's Krusty the Clown.
The catch is that Floop and Minion need an intelligence prototype created by
Gregorio to complete their dastardly creations.  They kidnap Gregorio and
Ingrid, leaving the two kids to rescue their parents, and the world.  Carmen
and Juni get to play with all kinds of cool gadgets and modes of
transportation that, frankly, put the recent James Bond films to shame. They
also engage in typical sibling battles with each other while they battle
Floop's henchmen and cronies.
The special effects in Kids range from really cheesy to quite staggering (at
least for a kids' film; we're not talking The Matrix here). Rodriguez has a
reputation of making expensive-looking films for peanuts, and he doesn't
disappoint here.  Kids cost $36 million, but it looks like two or three
times that amount was used.  To keep costs down, Rodriguez, as usual, wore
many hats on the set, serving as producer, editor, director, writer, sound
mixer and visual supervisor.  Vega and Sabara helped out by insisting they
perform most of their own stunts.
The casting here is pretty decent, with Vega the only real standout.  There
are a bunch of actors that contribute tiny parts (Teri Hatcher, Robert
Patrick), including some veterans of Rodriguez's other films (Cheech Marin,
Danny Trejo) and one superstar cameo from the director's From Dusk Till
Dawn.  Kelly Preston was originally cast in Gugino's role but backed out
because she had just given birth to an evil little Scientologist
Kids reminded me a lot of Cloak & Dagger, a similar kid-oriented spy caper
from the early '80s that starred a hot-off-E.T. Henry Thomas.  Like Dagger,
this film doesn't dumb down the action for really young kids and, as a
result, makes the picture a lot more enjoyable for older kids and adults.

Title
Review for American Psycho (2000)
Bret Easton Ellis' novel American Psycho was so disturbing and
controversial that it had to scramble for new publisher at the last
minute when Simon & Schuster backed out after having second thoughts
regarding the murderous tale of an 80s yuppie that adorns his posh
apartment with the body parts of his female victims.  Ellis' book was a
detailed satirization of uninhibited materialism and decadence in
post-Last Days of Disco New York City.  But like Disco, this picture is
tough to enjoy because there really isn't anyone to root for.
Christian Bale (William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream) plays
Patrick Bateman, a twenty-seven-year-old Wall Street hotshot whose
biggest problems in life are limited to getting a bad table at a trendy
restaurant, discovering that someone has better business cards than he
does, and trying to find a dry cleaner to get the blood stains out of
his sheets. Bateman admits that he is incapable of feeling any emotion
other than greed and disgust, a fact he demonstrates by killing hookers,
the homeless and an occasional co-worker.
Bateman's world is full of name-dropping co-workers and acquaintances
that can barely remember each other's names but have total recall when
it comes to knowing who wears what kind of suit or who ate at what
restaurant last Wednesday.  He has an unfaithful fiancée (Reese
Witherspoon, Election), a sterile white apartment and a job that seems
to consist of reading porn, watching Jeopardy! and listening to his
Walkman.  As the film opens, Bateman gives a detailed list of name-brand
toiletries that he uses to prepare himself for a hard day of murders and
executions (a bimbo mistakenly thinks he says `mergers and
acquisitions').
You may be wondering about the story right about now, but there really
isn't one.  Bateman hops from home to work to bar to restaurant acting
like a jerk and randomly killing people.  The closest Psycho comes to
any semblance of plot is when Bateman offs a co-worker played by Jared
Leto (Black & White) and is questioned several times by a police officer
(Willem Dafoe, eXistenZ).  Much will be made about Bateman's long,
pre-killing diatribe on 80s music, but by the third time he does this,
it's boring.
An overrated actor, Bale does little with Bateman that we haven't
already seen in Michael Douglas' Gordon Gecko or, more recently, Tom
Cruise's Frank `T.J.' Mackey.  But he's much better than Leonardo
DiCaprio would have been (he was originally slated to play the part but,
like Simon & Schuster, backed out at the last minute).  Witherspoon does
a good job at acting like the girl on Stark Raving Mad, who in turn
seems to be doing an impression of Witherspoon.  Leto is as dim-witted
as ever (who keeps casting him?).  Samantha Mathis (Broken Arrow) and
Chloë Sevigny (Boys Don't Cry) co-star, the latter of whom could be
playing the same part as her monotone Last Days of Disco character.
Psycho is a real indie affair, which doesn't help explain why it's
playing multiplexes with a national release date instead of a platformed
art-house run.  Director Mary Harron, who helmed the far superior I Shot
Andy Warhol, as well as episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street and OZ,
doesn't bother to show most of the story's carnage. The film, co-written
by Harron and Go Fish scribe Guinevere Turner, isn't nearly as graphic
as you would think.  Ex-Velvet Undergrounder John Cale (Warhol) provides
a handsome score, and Andrzej Sekula's (Pulp Fiction) camera work is, at
times, breathtaking.

Review for Hua yang nian hua (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood For Love is kind of like the Harrison
Ford/Kristin Scott Thomas debacle Random Hearts, except there isn't a
plane crash and it's not nearly as sucky. The film is about two married
neighbors who forge a relationship and then learn their respective
spouses have been having an affair. In the Mood, which snagged the
Technical Grand Prize and Best Actor trophies at Cannes, as well as the
prestigious Five Award from the European equivalent of the Oscars, is
intricately paced and was largely improvised by Wong (Happy Together)
and his actors on the set.
The film is set in 1962, where fate brings two strangers together in a
cramped Hong Kong apartment building. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung, Happy
Together) is a newspaper editor who dreams of writing pulpy martial arts
serials, and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung, Chinese Box) is the assistant to
an executive of a large shipping company. The two characters meet when
they rent rooms from families who just happen to live next door to each
other.
Su's husband frequently travels to Japan for business, accompanied by
Chow's wife, who tells her husband she's working late, or spending time
with her sick mother. But neither Chow nor Su have a clue their partners
are being disloyal - that is, until they begin to develop their own
relationship. It begins with a glance as they cross paths both in the
tiny hallway leading to their apartments and on a dark stairway leading
to a noodle cart where the characters get lunch. It isn't until their
romance blossoms that Chow and Su learn of the irony of the relationship
shared by their spouses.
Their resolution to the situation is simultaneously anguished and
exquisite. The fact that these two characters are so likeable, coupled
with Wong's decision to never show them sharing a physical moment (he
shot a sex scene, but wisely left it on the cutting room floor) makes
the outcome of In the Mood as heartbreaking as anything you'll see on
the screen this year. Wong keeps thing subtly erotic by occasionally
having Chow and Su's hands brush together as they pass, trying to avoid
raising suspicion from their nosy, gossiping landlords, who have epic
Mahjong tournaments that last for days at a time.
Chow and Su's adulterous spouses are barely in the film, and when they
are, Wong opts to keep these characters hidden from viewers through
careful location of his camera. In fact, the writer/director gives In
the Mood more of a voyeuristic, fly-on-the-wall feel than any
reality-based television programming. Like Steven Soderbergh, Wong often
blocks off part of his shots with a door jam or some other inanimate
object, which, in addition to placing his camera at just the right angle
in a hallway or doorway, gives the film a cramped, cluttered look that
ads to the claustrophobic feeling that the two main characters must also
share. Actingwise, Leung and Cheung have never been better.
In the Mood is one of the most beautiful films I've ever had the
pleasure of seeing. Wong's previous pictures have all been gorgeous in
their own way, but never as elegant as here. His city is so dark and so
moody (hence the title), you'll think the sun has never risen in Hong
Kong. Wong's right-hand men - cinematographer Christopher Doyle (Liberty
Heights) and editor and costume/production designer William Chang, do an
unbelievably incredible job at making the film seem like the most
colorful, romantic dream you've ever had. If the shots of Cheung
gracefully swishing her lavish silk dresses through various surroundings
don't hypnotize you, then the repetitive use of a Spanish version of a
Nat King Cole song (and other period pop songs from the West) will be
sure to do the trick.

Review for Virgin Suicides, The (1999)
I don't know when it started, but films that open with shots of suburbia
give me the chills.  Oak-lined streets, white picket fences, moms
watering the lawn, kids playing basketball, dads barbequing  should I
really find them that creepy, or is American Beauty still fresh in my
mind?  You practically expect something alarming to happen, like for the
camera to pan down and reveal a human ear lying in the grass (a la David
Lynch's Blue Velvet).
It's no Blue Velvet, but The Virgin Suicides has a development just as
disturbing.  And all it takes is one line to snap you out of the
suburban daydream  `Cecilia was the first to go.'  The images of moms
and dads and lawns and fences are replaced with one of a
thirteen-year-old girl in a bathtub filled with crimson-tinged water.
It's akin to a slap across the face.  And like Lester Burnham's opening
monologue in American Beauty, that line gives you an idea of what to
expect from the rest of the film.
Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall, young Jenny in Forrest Gump), we learn, is the
youngest daughter in the Lisbon family.  The Lisbons (James Woods, Any
Given Sunday and Kathleen Turner, Baby Geniuses) are the parents of five
beautiful teenaged daughters that look like they just stepped out of a
Golden Grahams commercial.  There's fourteen-year-old Bonnie (Chelse
Swain, sister of Lolita's Dominique), fifteen-year-old Lux (Kirsten
Dunst, Dick), sixteen-year-old Mary (A.J. Cook) and seventeen-year-old
Therese (Leslie Hayman).  Together, the Lisbon daughters form their own
little clique of well-developed, blonde girls, which, as you might
expect, attracts the attention of every teenaged boy within pheromone
range.
But the Lisbon parents are maniacally strict, barely allowing their
voluptuous flock to leave the house, let alone date boys, which only
makes the forbidden girls more tantalizing.  In fact, Suicides is told
from the point of view of a boy that lived in the neighborhood (Giovanni
Ribisi, Boiler Room, provides the narration but does not appear in the
film).
Like other similarly aged young men that lived near the Lisbons, the
narrator explains their infatuation with the girls led them to find and
collect Lisbon memorabilia.  They still talk about them, even though the
events that play out in the film transpired twenty-five years ago.  The
boys-turned-men have a burning desire to know what went on in the Lisbon
house, but just don't have enough information to piece the past
together.
While Cecilia's suicide was a major catalyst for the actions of the
other Lisbon girls, Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett, Here on Earth) was
certainly another.  The most popular boy in school, Trip successfully
woos Lux with his rock-star swagger (and a wig like Kelso on That 70s
Show), but then ditches her after a school dance, setting off a chain of
tragic events in the Lisbon house; events that nobody seemed to care
about but the narrator and his friends.
Suicides is full of amazing performances from everyone, including the
interchangeable Lisbon girls.  Woods character gets nuttier and nuttier
as the film progresses and things in his house begin to spin out of
control.  The luminous Dunst chalks up another fantastic performance 
it's hard to believe she just turned eighteen.  But the surprising
standout acting-wise is Hartnett, who gets so far into his role that
you'll likely forget that it's him.  Scott Glenn (Firestorm) and Danny
DeVito (Drowning Mona) also appear in one scene apiece.
Suicides is the directorial debut of Sofia Coppola, the daughter of
Oscar winner Francis Ford Coppola, who, until now, was probably most
famous for playing Mary Corleone in The Godfather, Part III or, at best,
the wife of last year's Oscar-nominee Spike Jonze (Being John
Malkovich).  But Sofia proves here that's she's just as talented as her
pop, her Oscar-winner cousin (Nicolas Cage), her Oscar-winning grandpa
(Carmine Coppola), her Oscar-nominated aunt (Talia Shire) or her
husband.  Coppola adapted the script from Jeffrey Eugenides' debut novel
of the same name, and pumped the music full of great period music (but
not stuff that you're tired of hearing in films), like Heart, Todd
Rundgren, ELO and Janis Ian.  The standout score was provided by the
French band Air.

Review for Krámpack (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The original Spanish title of Nico and Dani -  Krámpack -  sounds much more
exciting than the film actually is (Hint: It involves your hand, your mouth
and someone else).  It's received numerous awards from various film
festivals and a shocking number of positive reviews from various media
outlets, but I just don't get it.  Maybe it's because I cut my teeth on teen
sex romps like Porky's and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, as well as
my-parents-are-gone-so-come-over-and-let's-have-some-fun comedies like Risky
Business and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
Dani is set over 10 days in and around a big beach house just outside
Barcelona.  When Dani's (Fernando Ramallo) parents leave their 17-year-old
son, he invites his buddy, Nico (former circus performer Jordi Vilches),
over for various teen hijinks.  Both boys are virgins and decide to do what
they can to remedy that situation, making Dani somewhat like a European
version of American Pie (do not fear - no pastry is violated).
Various adventures ensue, including trysts with two girls (Marieta Orozco
and Esther Nubiola), an older writer (Chisco Amado) and...well, each other.
That's right - the only remarkable thing about Dani is its gay content, and
I'd bet my next six paychecks that this film would have been completely
overlooked if it was about two "breeder" boys.  It's a simple coming-of-age
yawn...I mean yarn.  It's a yarn.  A coming-of-age yarn.
To make matters worse, Dani practically condones promiscuity and drug use,
and even features one of the boys raping an unconscious girl he has slipped
a mickey, but suffering absolutely no repercussion.  Is it realistic in its
portrayal of sexually charged young men?  Probably, but Big Brother is
realistic, too.  And nobody's raving about that.

Review for Eu, Tu, Eles (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Brazil's entry to this year's Best Foreign Film competition at the Oscars
(Me, You, Them  wasn't nominated) is set in a remote area in the northeast
part of the country.  It's extremely flat, barren, burnt and desolate, and
its inhabitants live well below the poverty level.  Hammocks are the rage
because nobody can afford a proper bed, which is a good thing because the
film's main character jumps from man to man so quickly, she'd probably have
broken one or two of them.
As the film opens, a pregnant woman named Darlene (Regina Case) gets stood
up at the altar.  She hitches a ride out of town and, three years later,
returns with her son in the hopes of having her mother bless him.  But she's
too late.  Her mom has died, and Darlene finds herself fighting off marriage
proposals from an old man named Osias (Lima Duarte). "You're not ugly," he
declares, "Marry me."  She accepts, largely because he has a nice house.
Ah, to be in love.
Osias doesn't treat Darlene too well, using her basically to perform the
cooking, cleaning and baby-birthing (they have one child together).  This
drives the attention-starved Darlene into the arms of her husband's live-in
cousin, Zezinho (Stęnio Garcia).  He and Darlene have an affair, and a kid
of their own, and the whole process repeats itself when the hunky young Ciro
(Luís Carlos Vasconcelos) shows up.
The men are all jealous of each other, but nobody really ever shows it.
They're all just happy to be involved in Darlene's life for some reason.
She's a radiant woman - not conventionally attractive, especially by
Hollywood standards, but special enough for a group of men not to act
like...well, men, and beat their chests to win her affection.
Them is full of long stretches with no dialogue, giving the film a very high
nod-off factor.  It's kind of like a baseball game - the ball is only in
play for about 10 minutes.  The dialogue picks up toward the end, but until
then, you'll be able to enjoy the film's wonderful scenery and
cinematographer Breno Silveira's exquisite compositions bathed in natural
light.  Gilberto Gil provides a soothing score that gives the film a real
flavor.  Director Andrucha Waddington keeps things interesting with a series
of long shots that enhance the film's beauty.  Them may not be for everyone,
but fans of polygamy and Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami should thoroughly
enjoy it.

shoulders above most other films, a point proven with O Brother, Where
Art Thou?.  Compared to any of the Coen's previous films, O Brother just
doesn't measure up.  But since the brothers have consistently made some
of the best films over the last decade and a half, even something that
doesn't seem up to their usual standards can tower over its competition.
O Brother, which is loosely based on Homer's `The Odyssey,' in set in
1937 Mississippi, where a rock-breaking chain gang appears on the screen
after the nifty silent movie title cards used for the film's opening
credits. Three of the convicts (apparently the only three white
prisoners there) escape through a giant cornfield and are quickly
involved in two very funny sight gags because of their still-shackled
feet.
The fast-talking leader of the group is Everett Ulysses McGill (George
Clooney, The Perfect Storm), who orchestrated the jailbreak because only
four days remain before his `treasure' will be underwater. The treasure
in question is from an armored car robbery McGill pulled off some years
earlier, while the "underwater" comment remains somewhat of a mystery.
In addition to the treasure, McGill also has some pretty serious issues
with his hair, which he constantly slicks back with Dapper Dan's Pomade.
McGill's two sidekicks are Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro, Cradle Will
Rock) and Delmar O'Donnel (Tim Blake Nelson, The Thin Red Line), two
animated dimwits who specialize in hysterical slack-jawed expressions.
The three men begin the trek to McGill's home, but first they come upon
a strange black man speaking in riddles that foreshadow what the escaped
cons are going to encounter over the next four days.
And, oh, the things they encounter.  They rob a bank with the manically
sensitive `Babyface' Nelson (Michael Badalucco, The Practice), interrupt
a Ku Klux Klan rally, run into a slightly deranged bible salesman (John
Goodman, Normal, Ohio), cross paths with three lovely sirens, and even
cut a hit record at a radio station owned by a blind man (Stephen Root,
Bicentennial Man).  And the coppers are on their tail the entire
journey.
O Brother is full of all kinds of great 30s slang and mannerisms, plus
some wonderful Southern accents.  The music is first-rate, too, with
most being penned by T-Bone Burnett (he was part of Bob Dylan's `Rolling
Thunder Review') and Chris Thomas King, who appears in the film as a
blues musician at a familiar crossroads after a certain appointment (his
name is Johnson  Tommy, not Robert).  And Roger Deakins' (Thirteen
Days) lush photography is spellbinding, giving every scene in O Brother
a golden glow that could translate to a golden night at next year's
Oscar ceremony.
The negatives of O Brother are pretty minor.  At times, it seems like
the Coens (The Big Lebowski) just stuck a bunch of random ideas
together, using bits that they couldn't squeeze into their previous
films.  From the color of the leaves and the dead corn stalks that make
up the backgrounds of nearly every scene, it should be autumn, but a
newspaper tells us it's the middle of July.  The film also wags its
tongue at P.E.T.A., showing some pretty bad stuff happening to animals
for comedic value.
Surprisingly, O Brother is practically a musical, offering more than a
couple of nicely orchestrated song and dance numbers.  Also somewhat
shocking is the strong performance from Clooney, who seems totally wrong
for a role like this, but does an exceedingly good job.  Turturro and
the relatively unknown Nelson (he directs an upcoming version of
Othello'  called O) deliver great performances, too.  An interesting
note: Turturro supplied the voice of Badalucco's dog when he played
David Berkowitz in Summer of Sam.

Review for Punks (2000)
Patrik-Ian Polk's Punks is about a tight-knit group of four gay men (or
`punks') looking for love in West Hollywood.  What makes the film unique
is the fact that the central characters are all black and Hispanic.
After a funny bit where the men shout out names of celebrities they'd be
willing to have sex with, Punks shows the party thrown for Hill's 30th
birthday.  Instead of feeling celebratory, Hill (Dwight Ewell, Hooper X
from Chasing Amy) is down in the dumps after catching his French
boyfriend making out with another guy.  He leans on his three close
friends for support, and we quickly learn that they're all just as
unlucky in love.
Chris (Jazzmun) is a popular female impersonator, but none of the other
guys have ever seen the boyfriend he swears isn't imaginary.  Dante
(Renoly Santiago) has an endless string of one-night stands, but can't
ever find the right guy to settle down with.  And despite the fact that
Marcus (Seth Gilliam, OZ) hasn't ever had a homosexual experience, he
insists on being HIV-tested every month (by Loretta Devine, Urban
Legends)
Most of Punks centers on Marcus' relationship with his new neighbor, the
hunky (but straight) Darby, a successful music producer new to the west
coast.  This entertaining film is chock full of Chris' musical numbers,
in which he lip-syncs a large portion of the Sister Sledge catalog with
his group, The Ladies.

Title
Review for Dogma (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Leave it to the Catholic Church to damn something that could actually
turn people on to God.  They've done it before with other films deemed
blasphemous  sight unseen  by their bible-thumping leaders.  Remember
The Last Temptation of Christ?  They were upset because Jesus had a
mortal thought.  The horror!  And then there was Priest, where the
leader of a Roman Catholic parish struggled with his homosexuality.
Like that's not happening anywhere in the real world.
With Kevin Smith's Dogma, it seems as if the Church has sunk to new
lows.  While going out of its way to openly mock organized religion,
Dogma is probably the biggest pro-God film in decades.  It's an
effective portrayal of redemption and faith that will really make people
think about their current religious beliefs, and it does it in a way
that doesn't hit you over the head.  Perhaps the Catholic Church is
frightened that its flock will see the film and then question the word
that has been spoon-fed to them over the years.  God forbid people think
for themselves.
When Dogma had its US premiere, throngs of vocal protestors yelled at
people entering the theater.  As Smith (Chasing Amy) hit the red carpet,
he tried to explain to them that his movie was a `really devout,
pro-faith' film.  But as right-wing protest organizer C. Preston Noell
III of The American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and
Property later explained, Smith was wrong.  How fortunate for this
talented filmmaker to come across someone able to point out to him that
a film that he wrote and directed is not what he thinks it is.  Noell
also stated that the movie is `made by sad, silly people who, in effect,
are puppets manipulated by the devil' and that his 200,000 group members
planned to picket theaters once the film opened nationally.  When asked
what he specifically objected to, Noell admitted that he had not seen
the film.  Understandable, since siphoning money from the wallets of
your followers has got to be pretty time-consuming.
So who do you believe?  The `puppets manipulated by the devil' or the
puppets manipulated by the Catholic Church?  See the movie and judge for
yourself.  You can't be damned to spend eternity in a lake of fire just
from watching a movie.  Not with today's ticket prices.  If you sneak in
without paying, that's another story.  And if you're still scared, stay
home and watch CBS's prime-time line-up.
Dogma opens (after a hilarious disclaimer discussing film critics and
platypuses) on the steps of a Red Bank, New Jersey church, where
Cardinal Glick (George Carlin, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure) is
holding a press conference to announce the launch of the new
`Catholicism  WOW' campaign that hopes to plant more asses in church
pews.  In addition to a new breakfast cereal (the wafer-like Hosties)
and the new `Buddy-Christ' (a winking, smiling Jesus giving a
thumbs-up), Glick also explains that this particular church is home to
an all-forgiving arch that will erase the sins of anyone that passes
through it.
News of the arch makes it to Wisconsin, where two fallen angels named
Loki (Matt Damon, Rounders) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck, Forces of Nature)
have spent their days since being banished from Heaven.  Loki and
Bartleby used to carry out God's dirty work - back when he was vengeful
- and see the arch as one last chance to escape the banality of
Wisconsin for the posh confines of Heaven's paradise.  The trouble is
that if Loki and Bartleby are forgiven, it will prove God's fallibility,
which will cause the world to end.
But God is wise to Loki and Bartleby's plans and dispatches angel
Metatron (Alan Rickman, Sense and Sensibility) to urge a mortal into a
crusade to stop the duo.  The mortal is Bethany (Linda Fiorentino, Men
in Black), an Illinois Planned Parenthood employee that has recently
found herself doubting her Catholic beliefs.  Although she initially
believes Metatron's visit was just a bad dream, Bethany reluctantly hits
the road, meeting  - in Wizard of Oz fashion - two horny prophets
(Smith's recurring characters Jay and Silent Bob), a forgotten
thirteenth Apostle named Rufus (Chris Rock, Lethal Weapon 4) and a
stripper/muse named Serendipity (Salma Hayek, Wild Wild West).
Other uniquely cast roles include Bud Cort (Harold & Maude) as a
homeless man and best-selling crooner Alanis Morissette as God.  If it
sounds like too much, it really is  especially Hayek's unnecessary
character and the scene with the poop monster.  Dogma is unrelentingly
and blisteringly hysterical, which, in measured doses, is fantastic.
Unfortunately here, like South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, it
becomes tiresome after a while, leaving the film with a very uneven
feel.  But this can easily be overlooked, if not just for being an
incredible commercial for the very people that are trying to convince
you not to see it.  That is perhaps a greater irony than anything in
Smith's script.

Title
Review for Blow Dry (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Miramax Films makes two kinds of movies - those that win awards and those
that make money.  The former are arthouse hits that star the likes of
Natasha Richardson, Alan Rickman and Rachel Griffiths, while the latter are
usually teen-oriented comedies featuring dreamy (but dull) talent like Josh
Hartnett and Rachael Leigh Cook.  The creative gap between the two resembles
the Pacific Ocean, but nobody minds because each turd like Down To You can
bring in enough money to make five Hamlets and buy five Butterflys.
Apparently some stroke victim over at Miramax greenlit a project that merged
the studio's two genres into one ugly film.  It's called Blow Dry and it's
about a British hairdressing competition.  The very idea of a film about
competitive hairdressing is preposterous to begin with, and it could
possibly be the worst premise for a movie since Stallone's Over the Top, but
what makes Blow Dry even more bothersome is that it isn't even the 21st
century's first film about a British haircutting contest.  That's right -
less than one year ago, we saw the release of The Big Tease, a similarly
themed farce that looks like Citizen Kane when placed next to Blow Dry.
Now let's discuss the title.  There are certain words that should be avoided
when choosing a name for your film.  If you're not careful, something that
seemed clever at the time could turn around and bite you in the ass when
review headlines blare "Do Whatever It Takes to avoid this movie." Obviously
"awful" and "bad" are off limits (see Bad Girls), as are "good" and "great"
(see Isn't She Great).  Anything with "love" or "hate" could cause trouble
(see A Thin Line Between Love and Hate).  I'd even be leery of words that
could taunt in rhyme ("If you're a big, fat dummy, you'll love The Mummy").
But "blow?"  Come on.  It's like shooting fish in a barrel. Or making fun of
the President.
Blow Dry opens with the announcement that the small town of Keighley will
host the 2000 British Hair Championship.  Keighley's Mayor (Warren Clarke)
is thrilled about the news, but when he announces it to the village's press
corps, they all yawn disapprovingly.  Or maybe it was everyone in the
audience yawning.  It's hard to tell because I was distracted by the fact
that such a small town had so many members of the press.
It becomes clear fairly early on that there are three hairdressing teams in
the film:  the one we're supposed to root for, the one we're supposed to
dislike, and the one that's supposed to make us laugh until our sides hurt.
The good guys are, essentially, a family torn apart by infidelity.  Former
hairdressing champ Phil (Rickman, Galaxy Quest) was married to Shelley
(Richardson, The Parent Trap), but she ran off with his model, Sandra
(Griffiths, Me Myself I).  Now Phil and his son Brian (Hartnett, Here on
Earth) run a Keighley barbershop, while Shelley and Sandra own the town's
only salon.  Will they be able to patch up their differences before the
contest's all-important Total Look category begins?
The bad guys are even less interesting.  Bill Nighy (Still Crazy) plays an
evil stylist with an underling who rigs each competition with things like
trick combs.  He also has a daughter (Cook, AntiTrust) who is visiting from
Minneapolis and gets temporarily sucked into her father's evil plans before
falling for the hunky Brian.  The supposedly funny hairdressing team is made
up of two sexually ambiguous Siegfried and Roy-types who have a beautiful
model (played by supermodel Heidi Klum).
Hartnett and Cook aside, the remaining acting talent looks embarrassed to be
here, but not nearly as embarrassed as it should be.  The characters get
more and more annoying as we're introduced to them, but each individual
character grows more aggravating as the film progresses, as well.  Hartnett
mumbles his way through a British accent, which sounded decent at first, but
that was because his lines were limited to one word.  Thankfully, Cook
doesn't even attempt the accent, and is, basically, eye candy.
Blow Dry was written by The Full Monty's Simon Beaufoy, who peppers the film
with a bunch of stuff that's supposed to make the audience titter but
instead is greeted with groans.  The movie is surprisingly short on gay
jokes, which is just about the only cliché that isn't totally exploited by
Beaufoy.  Blow Dry doesn't have a lick of Monty's charm and, worse yet, just
isn't funny.  Even the film's big sight gag - a shot of Heidi Klum's
well-coiffed bush - goes over like a lead zeppelin.  But since Everybody
Loves Raymond is popular, some folks may actually enjoy it.

Review for Closer You Get, The (2000)
It seems there are three routes a film can take if said picture is a
whimsical, ninety-minute comedy set in the British Isles.  There's the
Full Monty course, which leads to critical acclaim, multiple Oscar
nominations and a healthy box office take.  There's the Waking Ned
Devine path, which results in mixed reviews but fantastic audience
response and strong word of mouth.  And, of course, there is least
desirable road previously traveled by The Matchmaker, which was widely
panned and even more widely unseen.
The Closer You Get has elements of each of these films  it's produced
by Monty's Uberto Pasolini, set in a wee Irish town like Devine, and its
romantic theme is similar to that of The Matchmaker.  And like the other
three, Closer's story is an unbelievably lightweight but somewhat
charming fable.  But in terms of overall execution, the picture ends up
taking the unfortunate route of The Matchmaker. It's not bad, but the
film definitely seems amateurish (it's the first for director Aileen
Ritchie and screenwriter William Ivory).
Set in the Irish coastal town of Donegal, Closer is narrated by a
teenager named Sean (Sean McDonagh, in his film debut).  A dead-ringer
for American Pie's Jason Biggs (he even asks a friend what sex feels
like, but doesn't actually assault any pastries), Sean tells the viewers
how tired he is of taking the rowboat into town, drinking at the pub and
then rowing home every night.  His repetitive exploits mimic the daily
grind of every other single man in Donegal, including butcher Kieran
O'Donnell (Ian Hart, The End of the Affair), sheep farmer Ian O'Donnell
(Sean McGinley, The General) and rubber-valve fetishist Ollie (Pat
Shortt).
One night, these lads cook up a crazy, alcohol-fueled idea  place a
personal ad in the Miami Herald and entice hot American babes to
accompany them to their town's annual St. Martha's Day dance, and
presumably much, much more (read: hot Irish luvin').  Their crass ad
targets fit and trim women between the ages of twenty and twenty-one who
seek outdoorsmen with an ample supply of meats and fish.  Basically,
they have a better chance of find a winning lottery ticket in the hand
of a local dead man.
When the women in Donegal learn of the men's scheme, they become
understandably upset, but that doesn't stop the chaps from venturing
into previously unknown realms of hygiene, haircuts, fitness and heavy
oyster consumption.  Of course, at the end, most of the men predictably
end up paired with local gals, despite their wish for broads from
abroad.  Toward Closer's end, a character explains that `Sometimes the
closer you get to something, the further away it seems.'  I think the
driver's side mirror on my car imparts the same sort of wisdom.
The whole thing plays out like an extra-long episode of television's
Emmy Award-winning Northern Exposure, with its far-fetched plot and a
zany cast of isolated small-town irregulars.  Like NX, characters
include `the woman that runs the grocery store/post office' (Ruth
McCabe, Circle of Friends), `the cute local girl' (Cathleen Bradley, in
her film debut), `the guy that runs the business where everyone hangs
out' (Ewan Stewart, Titanic), and even `the guy with the leather jacket
and long black hair' (Pat Laffan).
Speaking of hair, Hart is almost unrecognizable (againI'm not even sure
what he's supposed to look like at this point) and has a strange, floppy
hair-do like Gary Oldman from The Fifth Element.  Then, to prepare for
the onslaught of American beauties, Hart's Kieran bleaches his locks,
which makes him look like a cross between Oldman and rock n' roll ghoul
Johnny Winter.  Even though this butcher runs around singing the
Bernstein/Sondheim hit `America' and is constantly readjusting his meats
(the bits in his pants, not in his shop's display case), you know he's a
perfect match for his lovely co-worker Siobhan (Bradley).  The ending is
even more predictable than Rachel Portman's (recent Oscar nominee for
The Cider House Rules) repetitive score.

Title
Review for Inspector Gadget (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Disney's live-action big-screen version of the popular animated
television series, while likely be entertaining for kids, will be a bore
for those who have reached a double-digit age.  Giving the lead role to
Matthew Broderick could be part of the problem  Gadget should be
bumbling and cocky, not bumbling and bland.
Broderick (Godzilla) stars as John Brown, a security guard for a
scientific research facility and a wannabe cop.  He is also in love with
Brenda (Joely Fisher, TV's Ellen), the daughter of a scientist that is
on the brink of creating robot police officers.  When a late-night
break-in attempt leaves her dad dead and John clinging to life, Brenda
decides to have doctors remove John's innards and replace them with the
lifework of her father.  The result?  John Brown becomes Inspector
Gadget, a high-tech officer for the Riverton Police Department.  Gadget
can implement any of his new features by shouting `Go Go Gadget,'
followed by whatever it is he wants to use  like spring legs or
helicopter hat.  But, like the series, he usually gets it wrong,
hilarity ensues, yet he still manages to get the bad guy.
Speaking of bad guys, Gadget's nemesis Claw is hammily played by Rupert
Everett (An Ideal Husband).  The world's youngest (and formerly the
fattest) billionaire, he has both an evil cackle and a net worth counter
on the front of his desk.  He's the one responsible for the break-in and
was left with a crushed right hand, which is eventually replaced with
the claw from which he derives his moniker.  Claw's headquarters are
located within the same Pittsburgh building that was supposed to have
been used to house Brainiac in the stalled production of Superman.
Like the TV series, Gadget has a dog named Brain and a niece named Penny
(Michelle Trachtenberg, Harriet the Spy), both of which appear smarter
than him.  Like the TV series, Gadget also has a talking car, voiced
here by D.L. Hughley (The Hughleys), who breathes some much-needed
energy into the film.  And like the TV series, Gadget always gets his
man and delivers him to Police Chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman, You've Got
Mail).  Other characters include a wasted (probably literally) Andy Dick
(NewsRadio) as one of Claw's scientists and an annoying Cheri Oteri
(Saturday Night Live) as Riverton's Mayor.
Perhaps even odder than the casting of Broderick is Disney's selection
of director David Kellogg, whose only previous effort was Playboy's
Playmates at Play video release.  This could explain the scene where
Gadget hoses down a cleavage-bearing Fisher with a giant load of blue
toothpaste.  Also, be on the lookout for several bothersome product
placement scenes.  (1:36 - PG for wacky violence/action, language and

Review for Trolösa (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2000 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
I wanted to hate Faithless.  I wanted to hate it so much that I'd leave
after 15 minutes and save the two-plus hours for something that sounded
more enjoyable than a slow-moving Swedish film about marital
infidelity.  You know, like picking out drapes, or giving my cat a bath,
or volunteering to be a mall Santa.
But Faithless turned out to be anything but a bore.  The film, which was
nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress at the European Film Awards,
did more than hold my interest  it shook me to my very core with a
riveting and, at times, horrifying portrayal of the effect infidelity
can have on a close-knit group of people.
The film begins with an old man (Erland Josephson) sitting down at desk
in a room that overlooks the sea.  He opens his notebook to begin
writing a story and, literally, creates a main character out of thin
air.  Her name is Marianne (Lena Endre), and she's a happily married
actress with a beautiful nine-year-old daughter.  The old man asks
Marianne questions about her life and, as she answers, he jots down her
responses as his story begins to take shape.
Despite having a great career, a loving husband and child, and a
beautiful home, Marianne plans an affair with David (Krister
Henriksson), her director and close friend of the family.  Their fling,
set to take place over a three-week period in Paris, is supposed to be
temporary, with neither party having to worry about sneaking around or,
theoretically, jealousy.  Things don't go as planned, of course, and
their affair follows them home to Sweden, where Marianne's husband
Markus (Thomas Hanzon) finds out, kicking off a series of ugly events
and a bitter custody battle over little Isabelle (Michelle Gylemo).
As Marianne slowly reveals the story to the old man, he looks stunned
and appalled by the actions of his own creation.  But, like a shrink, he
continues to ask her questions in an attempt to get Marianne to finish
her tragic tale.  And her emotional account is far from predictable,
too, often causing the old man to seem on the brink of tears.
It should come as no surprise that Faithless was written by nine-time
Academy Award nominee Ingmar Bergman, who is certainly no stranger to
films showcasing the tragic failure of a marriage.  Bergman's long-time
collaborator Liv Ullmann (a double Oscar nominee for acting) directed
the mesmerizing film, which is full of wonderful performances from the
five main characters.  Erland Josephson, one of the original players
from Bergman's acting company, plays the old man  a role obviously
meant to be Bergman.  Ironically, Josephson has played several
Bergman-esque characters over the years.

Review for Carne trémula (1997)
Ok, I'll admit it.  The only reason I went to see Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down
when it came out was because it was one of the first films to feature an
`NC-17' rating.  I was a horny teenager back then.  And, now I'm a horny
adult, so I've graduated to Pedro Almodovar's latest flick Live Flesh
(Carne Tremula).
The film opens in 1970 Madrid, when people apparently were too scared to
be out on the streets.  A hooker gives birth on an empty city bus, with
her motherly pimp and the driver acting as birthing coaches.  This is
one of the funnier baby delivery gags I have seen in a while and is
capped of the pimp (who resembles a Spanish Bea Arthur) gnawing the
umbilical cord off with her mighty incisors.
Flash forward twenty years  bus baby grows up to be Victor Plaza
(Liberto Rabal), a loveable oaf who wants only to start a relationship
with a coked-up wench named Elena (Francesca Neri) that he shagged in
the bathroom the previous weekend.  Way to set your sights high, Victor!
The feelings that Victor has for Elena are not mutual and, upon his
false entry into her apartment, the two struggle both aurally and
physically.  The police are called.  Shots are fired.  Victor goes to
jail.  The cop named David (Javier Bardem) is paralyzed and ends up
marrying Elena.  Poor Victor is forced to watch his beloved cheer for
her new husband as her becomes a successful wheelchair basketball star.
Most of the film takes place two years later, when Victor is released
from prison.  He starts by having an affair with the wife of Javier's
partner and it just gets wackier from there.  By the way, Elena has made
a miraculous transformation from Sandra Bernhardt to Dr. Quinn.  She has
even flattened and discontinued bleaching her foofy hair.  I did even
get that it was the same person, but I'm a frigging idiot.  So there.
Doesn't sound like your typical movie, eh?  It doesn't look like it
either.  Almodovar makes every scene look like a campy nightmare and can
only be matched in style to the work of Wong Kar-wai (Happy Together).
Live Flesh is a visual feast and, oh yeah, has some really hot sex
scenes.

Review for Gojira ni-sen mireniamu (1999)
Don't worry.  Just because a film comes from Japan and has the numbers
`2000' in its title, it doesn't necessarily mean it will be as bad as
Pokémon 2000.  And just because a film has the word `Godzilla' in its
title, it doesn't necessarily mean it will be as bad as the 1998
travesty that shared the same name.
Well, maybe you should worry after all.  Godzilla 2000 certainly can't
be considered a good film by any stretch of the imagination.  Made in
Japan and poorly dubbed in English, the picture is neither cheesy enough
to make you laugh at it, nor good enough for you to enjoy it as a
conventional action flick.  The plot is laughable and the film features
a closing line so ridiculous you'll have to hear it to believe it.
In Godzilla 2000, the giant lizard is still as nasty as he wants to be,
emerging from the ocean to use large ships as chew-toys and to stomp
electrical transformers into oblivion.  When he heads toward a huge
nuclear power plant, the people in the Godzilla Prediction Network raise
their cumulative eyebrow, thinking that the lizard may have some wacky
ulterior motive in his seemingly random attacks.
The GPN continually butts heads with a governmental agency called the
Crisis Control Initiative.  While the GPN wants to study the giant
beast, the CCI is hell-bent on destroying him.  Of course, their petty
differences are put on the back burner when a mysterious underwater rock
turns out to be a sixty-billion-year-old spaceship that has apparently
been waiting to drain the Earth of its precious computer data.  HmmmI
guess that makes sense.  Aliens saw dinosaurs roaming around during our
Cretaceous Period, and figured the planet would someday host a
technologically advanced civilization.  They must have seen those kids
from Land of the Lost and thought evolution would be a much quicker
process.
There are a lot of silly moments in Godzilla 2000, and I hope that at
least some of them were intentional.  Dubbing foreign films in English
usually results in bad translations which end up being inadvertently
hysterical, but only one made me laugh here.  A guy in a restaurant
complains that the teriyaki is cold, but doesn't care `as long as the
beer is cold.'  Then he downs a glass of a clear liquid that is
obviously not beer.
When something like this is the standout moment of a film, skipping the
multiplex might be a good idea.

 ŠCopyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Like Frank Darabont has cornered the unique market of Stephen
King-written period prison films (The Green Mile and The Shawshank
Redemption), Sean Penn is making a name for himself by directing films
that star Jack Nicholson and use the death of a young girl as the
story's catalyst.  The two, along with Penn's wife Robin Wright, made a
pretty decent but largely unseen 1995 film called The Crossing Guard, in
which Nicholson plays the vengeful father of a girl killed by a drunk
driver.
The Pledge pits Nicholson (As Good as it Gets), playing a retiring Reno
cop named Jerry Black, against a serial killer who rapes and murders
little blonde girls with red dresses.  The most recent slaying
interrupts Jerry's retirement party, but the dedicated detective chooses
to can his celebration and investigate the crime scene.  After promising
the girl's mother (The Green Mile's Patricia Clarkson) that he would
find the person responsible for the murder, the police get a quick
confession from a retarded mountain man (Benicio del Toro, who mumbles a
la Fenster from The Usual Suspects and sounds a bit like Yoda).
Jerry, like any other screen dick worth his weight in donuts, doesn't
believe they got the right guy, but his boss (Sam Shepard, All the
Pretty Horses) and arrogant young partner (Aaron Eckhart, Erin
Brockovich) think Jerry is just reluctant to let go of his last case.
Blowing off his retirement party present of a fishing trip to Cabo San
Lucas, he begins a rogue investigation into the brutal murder.  Like del
Toro's quick appearance and exit, there are a handful of great one-scene
appearances from numerous acting giants like Helen Mirren (Teaching Mrs.
Tingle), Vanessa Redgrave (Girl Interrupted), Harry Dean Stanton (The
Green Mile) and Mickey Rourke (Get Carterokay, maybe he's not an acting
giant).
The Pledge kind of shifts gears when Jerry buys a tiny gas station in
the area where the murders took place.  He also befriends single mom
Lori (Wright Penn, Unbreakable) and her young, blonde daughter,
eventually inviting them to live with him in the home above his gas
station.  It becomes clear that he is using Lori's daughter as bait for
the killer, providing his Jerry with one of the best character flaws in
recent memory.  He clearly will stop at nothing to catch the suspect,
and you can tell the pursuit has completely taken over every aspect of
Jerry's life.  There's a scene where Jerry reads fairy tales to the girl
as they lay in bed, giving a whole new frightening dimension to the
Brothers Grimm and raising questions about the identity of the killer
for the more imaginative viewer.
Fans of non-stop action will probably start groaning during the film's
middle portion, which is full of what may seem like a whole lot of
superfluous stuff.  But this isn't an action film.  It's something that
makes conventional audiences shudder:  a character study  something we
don't get to see much of nowadays in a major release.  And it doesn't
come as much of a surprise to find it in a film directed by an actor.
Penn wrote his previous two directorial efforts but The Pledge was based
on Swiss author Friedrich Dürrenmatt's book (adapted by Jerzy and Mary
Olson-Kromolowski), leaving Penn to focus his talent solely on the
film's direction, and the result is startling.  It's easily Penn's best
behind-the-camera work yet, as well as a considerable improvement over
The Crossing Guard.
This is also the best Nicholson has been in several years.  He is
extremely believable as a man unhinged by both a savage crime and his
own futility.  The Pledge also marks the third major release in the
first three weeks of 2001 to feature Traffic's del Toro (making '01 the
Year of the Bull), and one of two due in theatres this week where the
actor is unrecognizable and doesn't last too long (the other is
Snatch).  In addition to a handsome score from Gladiator's Klaus Badelt
and Hans Zimmer, The Pledge is also beautifully photographed by two-time
Oscar winner Chris Menges (The Mission, The Killing Fields).

Title
Review for Sugar & Spice (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
It almost sounded too good to be true - high school cheerleaders-turned-bank
robbers, and slumber parties where they roll around together in giant piles
of cash wearing only underwear and bras.  But Sugar & Spice's PG-13 rating
dashed the hopes and dreams of men throughout the country.  The good news is
that the film probably deserved an R rating, and while the slumber party
money-rolling scene was left out, there is a slumber party money-throwing
scene.  It's not the same, but at least it's something.
Spice is about the A-squad cheerleading team at Lincoln High School who
decide to rob a bank to ensure the financial security of the unborn child of
the team's captain who was knocked up by the school's dreamily dumb
quarterback.  A silly concept, but rife with comedic possibilities, the film
stretches a weak script that would have been better suited for a short into
a (barely) feature length picture that, like the last big cheerleading flick
(Bring It On) tries way to hard to have witty, acidic dialogue like
Clueless.
Spice, which is shown almost entirely in flashback, opens with jealous
B-squad cheerleader Lisa Janusch (Marla Sokoloff, The Practice) spilling her
guts in a police interrogation.  Lisa had nothing to do with the bank
robbery, or the events leading up to it, but happily fingers the girls who
were involved.  At first, her voiceover and the flashback technique work
well to establish the background of each of the film's characters, but it
quickly becomes very tiresome.  An alarming percentage of Spice is told with
the voiceover, which usually signals a major problem and attempted last
minute resuscitation in the editing room.
The five members of Lincoln A-team are the typical cross section of girls
you'd find in any teen movie.  Kansas (Mena Suvari, Loser) is the bad ass,
Hannah (Rachel Blanchard, Road Trip) is the goody-goody Bible-thumper, Lucy
(Sara Marsh) is the Harvard-bound braniac, Cleo (Melissa George, The Limey)
is obsessed with Conan O'Brien, and Diane (Marley Shelton, Never Been
Kissed) is the perpetually perky captain who becomes impregnated by Tom
Cruise-clone named Jack (James Marsden, X-Men).  That's right - Jack and
Diane.
When Diane realizes that she and Jack don't have enough money to take care
of their impending arrival, she hatches the idea to knock off the grocery
store bank branch she works at after school.  Diane gets the idea from
watching Point Break, and she and her cheering chums pick up robbery tips
from other bank heist films, like Dog Day Afternoon and Reservoir Dogs (even
though the latter didn't have a robbery scene) and from Kansas' convict
mother (played by an unrecognizable Sean Young, Poor White Trash).
There are big problems with the film, most notably the bizarre gestation
period of the American Cheerleader (or Titimus Bouncimus Maximus).  Spice
starts at the beginning of the school year, but one scene where Jack
measures the growth of Diane's stomach tells us it's August.  To make things
more confusing, Diane is seven-months pregnant at Christmas.  She also
sports the fakest looking stomach in the history of film.
That said, there are still a lot of really funny one-liners, and it's pretty
entertaining to watch the girls bicker before the robbery while donned in
Betty Doll masks and matching outfits.  Spice would have made a great short
and, ironically, was directed by a woman who won an award at the 1996
Sundance Festival for a short called Pig! (Francine McDougall).  There just
isn't enough material here to justify a running time of this length.
Perhaps another robbery or two would have livened things up a bit.

Title
Review for Scream 3 (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
There are two well-known film trilogies: The Godfather and the original
Star Wars series.  In both of these examples, the first installments
were fluke, out-of-left-field success stories that actually got better
with the second film before grinding to a halt with a lesser-acclaimed
third and final picture.  By the way, there are no spoilers here, so
don't be afraid to keep reading.
Forget all of that when it comes to Scream.  The only reason I bring it
up is irony - the Scream series called The Godfather, Part II the only
sequel that was better than the original.  Also, there was that scene
where the video store clerk and the convenience store employee decide
that The Empire Strikes Back was the best of the Star Wars films  wait;
that was Clerks.  It's tough to keep this stuff straight, especially
when Jay, Silent Bob and Princess Leia all have cameos in Scream 3.
While Scream 3 lacks the obvious bite of creator Kevin Williamson's
acidic pen, it's still better than the second film.  What is sacrificed
in terms of witty banter and keen pop culture references is made up for,
pound-for-pound, in genuine fright.  The film should keep most of the
audience on the edge of their seats, with hands intermittently clutching
chests, covering eyes and, if you're the type to try to figure out the
ending, scratching heads.  Scream 3 offers enough red herrings to gag
Hitchcock.  Hey, even Hitch gets a mention in the film, with one
particularly dimwitted character refusing to take a shower because she's
`seen Vertigo.'
The story for Scream 3 is set up around the production of Stab 3: Return
to Woodsboro, the third film in a series that has starred Tori Spelling,
Heather Graham, Luke Wilson and David Schwimmer (although he's never
seen; just referred to).  The whole idea of the movie within the movie
was pretty cool the first time but seemed in danger of being ground into
the dirt here (and what happened to Stab 2, anyway?).  But it's actually
handled pretty well, thanks to some good casting and scene settings.
Imagine the poor sap that wanders into the Sunrise Studios dark prop
room, where there's dozens of those creepy masks, flowing black robes
and pointy knives.
After the well-done opening murder scene, we begin to see the performers
in Stab 3 bumped off in the order their characters die in the script.
At the same time, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell, Three to Tango) starts
to have visions of her dead mother Maureen, which ties in nicely with
the murders because the killer is leaving old photographs of Mrs.
Prescott at each of the slaughter scenes.
Sidney, now a crisis counselor, has moved away from Woodsboro to
distance herself from the murders (and movies about the murders).  Other
holdovers from the first two films include talk-show host Cotton Weary
(Liev Schreiber, The Hurricane), cutthroat journalist Gale Weathers
(Courteney Cox-Arquette, Friends) and Deputy Dwight "Dewey" Riley (David
Arquette, Never Been Kissed), who is a creative consultant for Stab 3.
Oh, and there's also Roger L. Jackson, who has provided that scary phone
voice for all three pictures.
Dewey, Gale and Sidney are reunited on the Stab 3 set after two murders
shut down the production.  Before long, the killer is slashing at all of
them like OJ after a particularly bad round of golf.  They notice
similarities between reality and the Scream 3 script, but nobody knows
how the fictitious film ends because three finales were written to keep
the real one off the Internet.  Everything comes to a head in a mansion
owned by Stab producer John Milton (Lance Henriksen, Millennium), where
our three heroes run around like Scooby, Shaggy and Velma.
The best parts of Scream 3 are when the characters meet the people who
are playing them in Stab 3, especially Gale and Jennifer Jolie (Parker
Posey, The House of Yes), who does a dead-on impersonation of the
aggressive reporter.  Both skinny brunettes are perfect two-dimensional
bookends for Deputy Dewey, the object of both women's desire.  The
denouement is a little improbable, but it's a pretty effective ending
for what is supposed to be the last film in the series.  When Williamson
abandoned the script for Scream 3 to make bad television shows
(Wasteland), Ehren Kruger (Arlington Road) was brought on board, which
would explain the better-than-average conclusion.

Review for Dirty Work (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Dirty Work is America's best comedy.  There.  Now maybe MGM can use that
quote in their newspaper ads.  Apparently, the buzz on the film was so
bad that they didn't screen it to the press until after the release
date.  I don't get it, because I thought the movie was very funny.  In
fact, I haven't laughed this hard since Ron Brown's helicopter crashed.
Funnyman Norm Macdonald stars as Mitch Weaver, a lifelong loser who
finds himself fired and kicked out of his house in the opening reel.
Mitch crashes at buddy Sam's (Lang, Mad TV) house, but not before his
sex-crazed father (Jack Warden) has a massive coronary from watching
aerobics on the telly.
Turns out Pops needs a heart transplant, which will run $50,000
according to the gambling-addict Doctor Farthing (Chase, Fletch).  So,
Mitch and Sam decide to start a revenge-for-hire business to earn the
money within the two-week deadline.  Simple enough, right?
The two dunderheads have quite a history in the vengeance business,
framing a childhood bully, a perverted crossing guard and the
neighborhood Doberman as kids.  And, my friend, they don't miss a step
in the transition to duping adults.  In fact, they ruin businesses and
condemn apartment buildings virtually at will.  There are also two
bizarre hallucination sequences featuring Gary Coleman (?).
Yeah, the story is boringly predictable, but it's loaded with tons of
filthy dick and shit jokes  most from so far out in left field that you
can't see them coming at all.  Most people forget that Macdonald wrote
for Roseanne back when it was somewhat cutting edge, and co-writer Fred
Wolf worked on the Chris Farley laugh-fests Tommy Boy and Black Sheep.
Bob Saget's direction is unassuming while the film is punctuated with
tons of hot, overplayed modern rock tracks.  But ruin a movie, they do
not.  Dick and shit jokes trump frat-boy music any day.

Title
Review for S.L.C. Punk! (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
There are basically three groups of people that would like this film.
The first would be fans of similar apocalyptic films (anything made by
Gregg Araki).  The second group would be adult males between the ages
of, say, 25 and 32, that were not into `The Joshua Tree' when it came
out.  Lastly, squealing fans of spastic actor Matthew Lillard may also
enjoy the movie.  And, no  I only fit into the first two categories.
The lizard-like Lillard (Wing Commander) plays Stevo, a nihilistic
teenager growing up in Salt Lake City (thus the S.L.C. of the title)
during the mid 80s.  He's a punk, but has little to rebel against,
admitting in the film's opening line that `to be an anarchist in Salt
Lake City was pretty hard.'  Luckily, Stevo can still dye his hair blue,
beat up rednecks (the S.L.C. punk's mortal enemy) and hang around with
his best friend, the mohawked Heroin Bob (Michael A. Goorjian, Justin on
TV's Party of Five).  Don't worry, Bob doesn't really do heroin.  He's
afraid of needles and the name is a joke.
S.L.C. Punk!, written and directed by James Merendino (Livers Ain't
Cheap), has a fantastic soundtrack, featuring The Ramones, Black Flag
and Minor Threat.  In fact, the opening credits are a bit of a tribute
to Black Flag, showing all of the band's album covers changed slightly
to accommodate the names of the film's talent.  Especially funny was Til
Schweiger's (The Replacement Killers) album, which was stamped `import,'
as he is German.
Lillard will probably never be better than he is here  a bored, snotty,
upper-middle-class twerp with A.D.D. and parents intent on him going to
Harvard Law School, while he would rather beat the piss out of everybody
in the name of rebellion.  The movie is almost filmed in a documentary
style, with Stevo often narrating to the camera, describing why he and
his friends are doing what they're doing.  He also points out the
different `tribes' in S.L.C., like the Mods, who would be somewhat
equivalent to the Socials in The Outsiders.  But rest assured that
S.L.C. Punk!'s young cast isn't anywhere near the hotbed of talent found
in Francis Ford Coppola's film, although Lillard is often as endearing
as a young C. Thomas Howell.  (1:37  R for adult language, drug use,

Title
Review for Firestorm (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
WOW - Talk about divine intervention.  About 55 minutes into my screening
of `Firestorm', the tape broke or got wound up on the reel or
something.  The manager said it was unfixable, so not only did I not
have to suffer through the rest of this silly film, I also received a
free ticket to another film and got home in time to watch prime time
television.  Needless to say, things could not have gone better.
What I did get to see wasn't much.  There was a brief description of
what a `Smokejumper' was before the pictures came on.  At first, I
thought it might have been a disclaimer, like at the end of `Mr.
Magoo'.  I always secretly wished that they would do that with really
bad movies.  You know, something like this:
`The people at [studio name here] would like to apologize for the film
you are about to see.  When we started production, it seemed like such a
good idea.  But when we got the finished product, we were disappointed.
Very disappointed.  Unfortunately, it was way too late to do anything
about it.  We had already paid for it, so we released it.  Now that we
got your money, we felt we could be honest.  Thank you for your support
and we hope that you enjoy our next film.'
Anyway, from the opening scene, we learn that a smokejumper is a kind of
person who parachutes out of a plane into a forest fire.  Jesse Graves
(Long) is this kind of person.  So is Wynt Pekins (Glenn), but he is the
chief smokejumping person.  After Graves cuts down a tree for no
apparent reason, he and Glenn rush toward a burning cabin to rescue a
little girl trapped inside.  They get her and her little dog out just
before a burning tree crushes the cabin, but are completely surrounded
by the fire as they run out.  So Graves whips out a big piece of
aluminum foil to cover Glenn, the girl and himself, but not the dog.
Now I always thought that foil made things cook faster, but this was no
ordinary foil.  This was special smokejumper foil and the fire went
right over it, just like the nuclear fallout did in those `Duck & Cover'
spots they used to show to kids in the 50's.  The dog miraculously
survives.
I know that sound exhilarating enough, but there's more to this film
than fighting fires and magic foil.  There are also bad people in this
film.  The bad people start out in jail, but then they escape when Randy
Earl Shave (William Forsythe) dies his hair, gives himself a temporary
tattoo and sticks a guy in the neck with a knife.  When I was in jail,
they wouldn't give us any temporary tattoos until the hair dye had
washed out, just to avoid this type of prison break.  I must have gone
to a really good prison.  I didn't escape until they put me on an
airplane full of other convicts and we took control of the plane and
landed on the Las Vegas strip.  But that's another story
There was also a wildlife photographer played by Suzy Amis (`Titanic').
Her character only got to be in one scene before fate stepped in and
broke the film.
`Firestorm' is the directorial debut of Dean Semler, the Oscar winning
cinematographer of `Dances With Wolves' fame.  Ironically, the
cinematographer for this film is Stephen F. Windon, who is also
responsible for the equally reprehensible, but more recent Kevin Costner
self-love fes, `The Postman'.
As far as fire for entertainment goes, the `Backdraft' ride at Universal
Studios was more entertaining.  But I didn't see the whole thing, so
what do I know?  Benjamin Harrison was an appropriate rating because his
presidency ended before we could truly evaluate it.

Title
Review for Girl, Interrupted (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
`Have you ever confused a dream with life?' asks Susanna Kaysen in the
opening line of Girl, Interrupted.  It's tough to say whether she asks
this question before or after her recuperative stint in the nuthouse.
Winona Ryder (Celebrity), who also executive-produced the film, stars as
Susanna, a suburban, chain-smoking writer-wannabe that almost kills
herself by chasing a bottle of aspirin with a bottle of vodka shortly
after her high school graduation in 1967.  She is sent to Claymoore, a
mental institution for young women, after one brief meeting with a
psychiatrist friend of her father's.  Since she is over eighteen,
Susanna must voluntarily check herself into the home, despite not
believing that she has any actual mental problems.  We learn later that
her diagnosis is Borderline Personality Disorder, an ailment with
generic symptoms that basically means that a person is lazy and
self-indulgent.
After taking a tour of the facility with Nurse Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg,
How Stella Got Her Groove Back), Susanna begins to unpack but is
sidetracked by the arrival of recent escapee Lisa (Angelina Jolie, The
Bone Collector), a willowy, whacked-out, alpha-female sociopath that
manipulates the other girls in Claymoore.  Within moments of her
entrance, Lisa does enough screaming to land Jolie her first Oscar
nomination.  She oozes crazy like she oozed sex in Pushing Tin.  She's
criminally insane, yet also an intelligent, self-absorbed button-pusher
that doesn't feel crazy as long as she is able to maintain control over
a situation.  Apparently, this could get you locked up in the 60s, but
this describes more than half of the people that I've ever known.
Susanna and Lisa hit it off almost immediately, the latter goading the
former into not taking medication and rallying against the
establishment.  She's the devil on Susanna's shoulder  Tyler Durden to
Susanna's Jack.  They dream of escaping from Claymoore and getting jobs
at the new DisneyWorld in Florida but settle for breaking into Dr.
Melvin's (Jeffrey Tambor, Teaching Mrs. Tingle) office and reading their
clinical diagnoses with fellow nutcases played by Clea DuVall (The
Astronaut's Wife), Brittany Murphy (Drop Dead Gorgeous) and Elizabeth
Moss (the First Daughter on The West Wing).
Ryder is decent enough as Susanna, but how long is she going to continue
to play teenage roles?  She even keeps a journal here like she did in
Heathers.  One of the problems that I had with the film is that at the
beginning, Susanna seemed to dwell on flashbacks of integral moments of
her life.  The flashbacks stop almost as soon as she hits Claymoore.
Does that mean she's cured?  I dunno.  Does it mean she was never
crazy?  I dunno that either.  Susanna never seems to make any real
progress until she meets with Claymoore's head head-shrink, played well
by Vanessa Redgrave (Mrs. Dalloway).  The hapless Jared Leto (Fight
Club) also has a small part as Susanna's draft-dodging boyfriend.
Based on a book by the real Susanna Kaysen, Girl, Interrupted is
directed by James Mangold (Copland), who adapted the script with debut
screenwriters Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan.  Some of Mangold's
flashbacks early in the film were done pretty well, but, like I said,
they stopped pretty quickly.  Like any film set in that era, the use of
music is of particular importance and Mangold doesn't shortchange us
here, using gem after gem  from Simon and Garfunkel's `Bookends' at the
opening to Petula Clark's `Downtown' during the closing credits.

Title
Review for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
It'd help if you watched Kevin Smith's first four films before you see Jay
and Silent Bob Strike Back, just to familiarize yourself with some of the
characters.  But if you don't, you'll still be rolling on the floor.  Heck,
even if you've never seen any of them, Back offers more laughs per minute
than anything you'll see this year.  Here's a refreshing idea - the film
blows through most of the gags we've already seen a dozen times in the
trailer within about 15 minutes, leaving nothing but fresh laughs for the
remainder of this comedic gem.
Although Back contains very little of the rapid-fire dialogue many expect
from Smith (Dogma), it's still the most relentlessly funny movie since South
Park: BLU.  Smith takes self-deprecation to a new, sub-Woody Allen level
(but unlike Woody, Kevin never, ever saves the good lines for himself) as he
rips on himself, his films, his stars and their films, his studio and their
films, other directors and their films, and even his own audience (but not
nearly as inanely as they did in America's Sweethearts).
The film begins with a '70s flashback that shows something every comic book
fan craves - the origin of the main characters, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent
Bob (Smith).  Then Back re-introduces several of the characters from Smith's
previous films in a way that will leave your head spinning and your sides
splitting - you know, folks like Dante Hicks, Randal Graves, Brodie Bruce
and Holden McNeil (Brian O'Halloran even gets to say his big line over and
over again).
The story here is completely inconsequential, as Smith is going all out to
get you to bust your gut as he closes the book on his View Askew-niverse.
Jay and Silent Bob learn that a film is being made that features characters
based on their own lives (Holden, it seems, has sold the rights to the
"Bluntman and Chronic" comic to former partner Banky Edwards).  Pissed that
they're being cut out of the action (and even more pissed that people are
writing mean shit about them on an Ain't-It-Cool News spoof site called The
Poop Shoot), the boys decide to hitchhike to Hollywood to put a stop to the
film's production, but instead end up in a conspiracy involving four
vinyl-clad hotties, an orangutan, Daredevil, Steve Kmetko, Morris Day, and
their old friends Fanboy Walt and Steve Dave (to divulge more would be
criminal).
This ain't rocket science - Smith fans will think Back is the greatest thing
ever, and the uptight pricks who hate his stuff will hate this, too.  Smith
parodies everything from Winnie the Pooh to The Fugitive (he even works one
in for a movie that just came out, and one that won't be out until next
summer) and does it with a bevy of WB stars (Eliza Dushku, James Van Der
Beek, Marc Blucas), Chris Rock doing his best Spike Lee impression, and a
load of appearances from characters a lot of people may have completely
forgotten about, like Clark (Scott William Winters) from Good Will Hunting.
Where else can you see two Academy Award winners (Ben Affleck and Matt
Damon) ripping on the movie that won them an Oscar?  Where else can you see
Jason Lee play two different parts in the same film?  Where else can you see
Luke and Leia in the same movie?  Where else can you see a director cast his
wife, ex-girlfriend and infant son?  It can all be found right here - just
be sure to stick around for the closing credits for Smith's "apology" for
riling up the gay community, and for yet another surprise cameo when the
credits are finished.

Review for Matrix, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
In the opening scene of The Matrix, a foxy, leather-clad woman named
Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss, Models, Inc.) is surrounded by four beefy
cops intent on taking her down.  She doesn't go down.  Instead, she
beats the snot out of them so quickly and so effectively that you could
actually hear jaws hit the floor in the theater.  Who is she?  How does
she run up the sides of the walls?  How does she defy gravity?  How does
she seem to move four times as fast as the blockheads that are trying to
catch her?
While that amazing spectacle helps to draw you immediately into the
film, it's just the tip of the iceberg. Led by stunt coordinator and
four-time Hong Kong Film Award nominee Woo-Ping Yuen (Drunken Master),
The Matrix boasts some of the best martial arts ever seen in an
American-made picture.  It also features the finest slow-motion gunplay
not filmed by John Woo.
The story?  It's not bad, but it definitely takes a back seat to the
astounding visuals.  Keanu Reeves (Johnny Mnemonic) stars as Thomas
`Neo' Anderson, a corporate computer programmer by day and a
cyber-hacker by night.  His life changes forever when he decides to
follow the white rabbit to a gentleman named Morpheus (Laurence
Fishburne, Event Horizon), tries to get Neo to believe that the entire
world is just an elaborate computer program designed to pull the wool
over the collective eyes of mankind.
It's pretty tricky to follow, due, in part, to the distractingly
dazzling special effects (Matthew Ferro, Face/Off).  Writer/directors
Andy and Larry Wachowski (Bound) re-team with cinematographer Bill Pope
(Zero Effect) to create a nightmarish vision of a world where machines
are king and humans are cultivated as a natural resource.  And watch out
for Hugo Weaving (The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert), who
plays a creepy Robert Patrick-in-Terminator 2-style agent gunning for
Neo and his new pals.  (2:10  R for violence, adult language and some
very disturbing futuristic scenes)

Review for Isn't She Great (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Is there anything worse than a comedy with no laughs?  You bet there is
 a comedy with no laughs and a screeching, self-absorbed lead character
that has an autistic kid and dies of cancer.  Actually, that description
makes it sound kind of interesting.  It's not.  It's Isn't She Great 
the horrible story of actress-turned-best-selling-novelist Jacqueline
Susann.
Susann (played here by Bette Midler, That Old Feeling), a
self-proclaimed `star of stage and screen' found her career sagging as
low as Midler's bust in the mid 60s.  The film shows her tossed off of
a game show called `What's My Job?' for ridiculing a dimwitted
co-panelist.  The business has already chewed her up and spit her out,
and the past-her-prime starlet gets by on residual checks.  Her
publicist Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane, Mouse Hunt) proposes to her,
marries her and, through one of the stranger screen scenes I can
remember, sees a woman enjoying a book in Central Park, which gives him
the idea to prod Susann into writing a novel about the `real'
Hollywood.  The dirtier, the better.
The book, of course, is `The Valley of the Dolls,' which went on to
become the best-selling novel of its time.  Susann went on to write two
other stories, `The Love Machine' and `Once is Not Enough' (the latter
should have been the title of the last Bond film), but the film doesn't
mention either.  Instead, it concentrates on Susann and Mansfield trying
to find a publisher and an audience for her tawdry wares.  They
practically invented the idea of a promotional book tour, hocking the
novel from the trunk of their car as they barnstormed every local
bookstore from Pismal Beach to Walla Walla, Washington.
But Susann is more than a groundbreaking sales entrepreneur.  Her
character is perhaps one of the most annoying of all-time and I can't
recall a less sympathetic lead in the annals of Tinseltown.  She makes
Tom Ripley seem like goddamn Rocky Balboa, and if Susann were a figure
skater, she would have hired someone to whack Nancy Kerrigan in the
knee.  She was a fame addict and actually had the audacity to demand
that God make her more popular.  Truman Capote (portrayed eerily well by
Sam Street) claimed that Susann looked like `a truck driver in drag.'
He later issued an apologyto truck drivers.  Midler is perfect casting,
and so is the limp-wristed Lane.  Even Great's press kit calls their
relationship `unconventional.'
There's some tragedy, too.  Susann and Mansfield have the autistic kid
(this is what happens when a queen and a horse-faced diva try to
populate the earth).  And she gets breast cancer, just as God relented
to her constant yammering about her need for `mass love.'  While the
inclusion of these misfortunes attempt to soften Susann's brash
character, they just don't.  The script could have used some punch-ups,
like the rumors that Susann was a bisexual (and bedded, among others,
Ethel Merman, Coco Chanel and, I think, Mr. Ed).  Incredibly, Susann was
also invited to the party at Roman Polanski's house the night that Chuck
Manson's kids wiped out Sharon Tate, et al. (Tate appeared in the
theatrical version of Dolls, but Susann missed it because of her chemo
treatments.)  Either of these developments would have made the film a
little more interesting.  And it's not like there wasn't enough time,
with Great clocking in under an hour-and-a-half.
Great was directed by Andrew Bergman (Striptease) and the sorry script
was based on Michael Korda's New Yorker magazine article `Wasn't She
Great' (Korda was a Simon and Schuster editor on Susann's second novel)
and adapted by In & Out's Paul Rudnick (a.k.a. Libby Gelman-Waxner).
Midler is awful, Lane seems content to hide behind her wide hips, and
David Hyde Pierce (Frasier) offers further proof that he and Neil
Patrick Harris are actually the same person.
While Susann was probably a bit ahead of her time, Great is a bad comedy
that refuses to end.  The best part was watching the book binded in the
factory.  The second-best part?  When it was over.  The creators of the
film insist that Great is only `loosely based' on Susann's life, which
is comforting.  I feel safer thinking that a person this horrible didn't
exist in the world.

Review for Highlander: Endgame (2000)
I've never seen any of the three Highlander films, or one episode of the
syndicated television series, so I don't know Highlander from Hi-C.  But
I do know a good action film when I see it, and Highlander: Endgame
doesn't fit the bill.  It's a slow-moving piece of garbage with choppy
fight sequences and bad acting.
The story merges the paths of Connor (Christopher Lambert, from the
first three films) and Duncan Macleod (Adrian Paul, from the television
series)  two brothers that are members of an exclusive club of
immortals.  Supposedly, each of the immortals battle each other, gaining
the power of each person they slay.  At the end, only one immortal can
exist, which makes no sense because immortal people shouldn't be able to
die!
In Endgame, a diabolical character named Kell (Bruce Payne, Howling 6),
who, according to the film's press notes, has become `the most
invincible immortal ever.'  Say what?  That would be like saying that
Mickey Mantle was the most Yankeeist Yankee of all time.  Anyway, Kell
has killed over 600 immortals and assumed the power of all of his
victims.  Only 5,000-year-old brothers Connor and Duncan can stop the
power-hungry madman.
Endgame's press notes also speak of `dizzying time shifts across the
eons,' and, boy, they aren't kidding.  In the film's first five minutes,
the setting switches from 1990 to 2000 to the 1500s.  Don't look down to
find your popcorn or, God forbid, leave to use the bathroom because
you'll be completely lost once you shift your attention back to the
film.
Endgame is the directorial debut of Douglas Aarniokoski, who cut his
teeth working as an assistant on the last three Robert Rodriguez films.
The screenplay was written by the sequel-happy Joel Soisson, who also
penned Maniac Cop 3, The Prophecy 3 and the upcoming Mimic 2.  It's
supposed to be the final film in the series, and to that, I can only
say, `Thank God.'

Review for Don't Say a Word (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Don't Say a Word sounds a lot better on paper than it ends up being on the
big screen.  It's a psychological thriller based on a novel - a good start -
and features performances from the usually reliable Michael Douglas and
stars-in-the-making Brittany Murphy and Sean Bean, the latter of whom will
appear in the upcoming Lord of the Rings trilogy.
But Word is merely a predictable, by-the-numbers action flick with a little
psychobabble thrown in to the mix.  In fact, the only shocking thing about
the film is the fact it was one of three set to open on September 28 that
feature prominent shots of the World Trade Center (the others are
Serendipity, which will remove the potentially offending images; and
Sidewalks of New York, which also stars Murphy and has been pushed back to a
November release).
Word begins ten years ago with a group of five expert thieves knocking off a
Manhattan bank to get their mitts on a $10 million ruby (for some reason,
they pass up various other riches).  The gang, led by Patrick Koster (Bean,
Ronin), leaves in two cars and, as they get away, realize they've been the
victims of the old switcheroo.  Before we learn more, Word brings us into
the present day, where Dr. Nathan Conrad (Douglas, One Night at McCool's) is
heading home from his upscale psychiatry practice to spend the Thanksgiving
holiday with his wife Aggie (Famke Janssen, X-Men) and eight-year-old
daughter Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak, The Patriot).
Before he reaches his luxurious Central Park West home, however, Nathan
receives a call from Dr. Jerald Sachs (Oliver Platt, Ready to Rumble), an
old colleague who needs his help with a new patient at a dingy nuthouse on
the other side of town.  Figuring it will only postpone his arrival home by
an hour or two, Nathan meets Jerald and his patient, a spooky 18-year-old
named Elisabeth Burrows (Murphy, Summer Catch) who has been in 20 different
institutions and had just as many different diagnoses.  It seems that
Elisabeth witnessed her father being hit by a subway when she was eight and
hasn't been the same sense.
Long story short, Nathan wakes up the next morning to find his daughter has
been kidnapped, and her captors say he has until 5:00 that evening to pry a
mysterious six-digit code from Elisabeth's crazy noggin.  Hmmm.let me get my
abacus.  Elisabeth is 18 and her dad was killed when she was eight.  That's
ten years ago.  I wonder if her dad had something to do with the ruby
robbery?  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to stay at least one step ahead
of Word at any point.  It becomes clear fairly early on that Nathan will
both save his daughter and cure Elisabeth like some kind of psychiatric
superhero.  The only unanswered question is whether Word's final shot will
show Elisabeth eating Thanksgiving dinner with Nathan's family or not.
The best aspects of Word come from the most unexpected places.  Nathan's
wife Aggie has a broken leg and is in traction, confined to her bed for the
entire film while she's being watched by the bad guys' hidden video cameras
(it's like a reverse Rear Window).  And the badly underdeveloped
relationship between little Jessie and her kidnapper has a lot of potential,
as the girl seems to grow on the gruff, tattooed gangster (it's like a
reverse Stockholm Syndrome).  And Amir Mokri's (Coyote Ugly) cinematography
is, at times, quite captivating, especially in the gritty flashback scenes
and prologue that make New York City look like Sarajevo.
Instead, director Gary Fleder (Kiss the Girls) and screenwriters Patrick
Smith Kelly (A Perfect Murder) and Anthony Peckham, adapting from Andrew
Klavan's novel, insist on including a completely worthless subplot involving
a homicide detective (Jennifer Esposito, Dracula 2000) who may be the
toughest female law enforcement agent since J.Lo in Out of Sight.  Still,
her character does nothing but take up time, making Word about 20 minutes
longer than it needs to be.

Title
Review for Chopper (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
A title card that precedes Andrew Dominik's first film declares the work to
be a dramatization rather than a biography, but it doesn't really lessen the
impact Chopper can have on an audience.  It's essentially a biopic about
notorious Australian bad boy Mark Brandon Read, who earned the nickname
"Chopper" by hacking off the toes of his victims (of which there are,
reportedly, 19).
Unlike America's infamous nerdy killers, the heavily tattooed Read is as
charismatic as they come.  When he explains the world really would be a
better place without his victims, we believe that just might be the case.
The public's fascination with Read doesn't stop with rehashing the grisly
details of his crimes, either.  Read has written a series of books from
prison, and each has become a bestseller.  Although Read's exploits are
probably a bit exaggerated, make no mistake about it - he's one bad dude.
The film begins in the '70s, where Read (played by Eric Bana) is in the
pokey for botching a kidnapping attempt he'd been dreaming of since he was a
boy (and all I was concerned with was scoring me some Batman Underoos). It's
a maximum-security prison (it still looks like a country club compared to
Oz), and Read makes some pretty big enemies while inside. So big, in fact,
Read had his own ears sliced off to get himself moved to a different cell
block.
Fast-forward to the '80s, where Read is back on the streets, raising all
kinds of hell in the seedy underbelly of Melbourne. And he does a lot of
really bad things, most of which probably actually happened. It's ghastly,
horrible stuff, but Chopper is the rare film in which you can root for a
heinous, real-life criminal and not feel like a tool for doing it, making it
a bit like John Boorman's The General in some respect. Also appealing is
Dominik's decision to neither demonize nor praise Read, leaving that
decision to be made by each individual viewer. Dominik fills the film with a
number of pretty dazzling visual tricks, as well.
The real star here is Bana, one of Australia's biggest standup comedians He
doesn't have much acting experience (he had a small part in The Castle), yet
is still able to stick this performance. Think about Ray Romano nailing the
lead role in a Ted Bundy biopic to get an idea of how impressive this feat
is. Bana is probably just as charismatic as Read, and his deadpan one-liners
make the film something special. When Read is shanked by one of his friends,
he doesn't roll around in agony, but responds, "What's gotten into you?"
When he stabs a foe in the neck, Read doesn't run away, but instead asks,
"You all right, mate?"
I think President Dubya would call that Compassionate Callousness.

Title
Review for Jack Frost (1998)
When Jack Frost (**) was in its development stages, it sounded like a
potentially great film.  The title role wasn't yet cast, but John
Travolta, George Clooney and Billy Bob Thornton were rumored to be the
top contenders for the coveted part.  Gloomy director Sam Raimi (Evil
Dead, A Simple Plan) was tentatively attached to direct the story of a
lousy father who, after dying, gets a second chance to be a good dad
when he comes back to life  as a snowman.
The finished product, however, is drastically different than the dark
and quirky film that I expected.  Michael Keaton won the lead and Troy
Miller replaced Raimi at the helm, so, on paper, it still didn't sound
too bad.  Keaton has done dark (Batman) and quirky (Beetlejuice) while
first-time director Miller has done both as a member of HBO's wickedly
fantastic Mr. Show comedy troupe.  But there are still problems with
Frost.
Problem #1 is that Frost has turned out to be a kid-flick.  Not that
kid-flicks are inherently bad (see current releases Babe: Pig in the
City and A Bug's Life for proof), but the ray of hope grew somewhat
dimmer.  I remained optimistic as the credited screenwriters were Mark
Steven Johnson (writer/director of the terrific Simon Birch) and Steven
Bloom (James & the Giant Peach).
Problem #2 is the snow.  They must have filmed this during the sunniest
part of August in southern California.  The snow is so fake-looking that
it's actually distracting.  At one point, the family dog trods through
the fluffy white stuff, which comes up to his belly, but doesn't leave
any kind of trail.  Granted, this is a pretty minor issue, but if you're
going to pay Jim Henson's Creatureshop to animate the snowman, why not
go the extra yard and have realistic snow?
Problem #3 is that Keaton's father, leader of the struggling bluesy Jack
Frost Band, isn't really that bad of a dad at all.  Being a traveling
musician, Jack isn't always there to see his kid Charlie (Joseph Cross)
play hockey or congratulate him for an exemplary report card.  He
doesn't beat his wife (Kelly Preston), nor does he snuff out his
cigarettes on Charlie's arms.  If anything, Charlie comes off as a bit
whiny.
The last straw for Charlie is when Jack's band gets their first big
break, but must play a show on Christmas to get signed to a major label
(perhaps Charlie thought his pop was selling out).  On the way to the
show, Jack decides to turn around and spend the holiday with his
family.  But he crashes the car and dies instead.  This setup takes
about forty minutes.
Flash forward one year to a bitter, fatherless Charlie struggling in
both school and social life.  One night, he wishes Jack back to life
with a magic harmonica, and when the snowman in the front yard channels
the spirit of his dead dad, the two are reunited at last.  Of course at
first, everyone in the sleepy Colorado town thinks that Charlie's grief
is causing him to crack up.  They see him arguing with the snowman.
They see him dragging the snowman through the center of town on a sled.
We had a kid like that in our neighborhood, but my mom always made me
come inside when he was loose.
Anyway, Frozen Pop teaches Charlie the `J' shot in hockey and helps him
get even with Rory Buck, the evil school bully (who appears to be the
grandson of A Christmas Story's yellow-eyed Scut Farcas), and -
blah-blah-blah - everyone goes home happy.
Despite dumbing the story down to the level of a second grader, the
movie is still enjoyable for adults for three reasons.  The first is the
fun of picking out Frank Zappa's three kids (Dweezil, Moon and Ahmet all
appear).  The second is spotting the cast members of TV's Mr. Show (I
counted three, plus one voice-over).  The third is trying to figure out
why Mark Addy (the fat guy from The Full Monty) was cast as a hardware
store employee and why screaming poet Henry Rollins played a suburban
hockey dad.
The kids will love the snowball fight, which is second in intensity this
year only to the storming of the beaches at Normandy in Saving Private
Ryan.  They'll also love the unexplainable snowboard/sled chase scene
down what must be the biggest hill on the planet.  This rivals The
French Connection in terms of elapsed time and sheer square mileage
covered.  In real life, the participants would have ended up somewhere
in Idaho.
While not an instant holiday classic, Frost is still the best Christmas
film of the year (sure, the only other one is Jonathan Taylor-Thomas'
awful I'll Be Home for Christmas, but who's counting).  Now, if I were
some big, high-falutin' film critic, they would cut that first sentence
up and use it for promotion by blaring `The BestFilm of the Year!' in
television and newspaper ads.  It ain't, but it ain't too bad, either.
Jack Frost (1:38) is rated PG for mild profanity, cartoonish violence,
some light sexual innuendo and talk of `frozen balls'

Review for Spice World (1997)
The following is a list (Larry Kink-style) of things that I learned from
the new film, Spiceworld:
   * The Spice Girls have the best teeth in all of England
   * George Wendt's career is washed up (although I should have figured
that out when he was thrown off of the sitcom The Naked Truth)
   * Sadly, Mark McKean (The Kids in the Hall) may also be having career
problems
   * The Spice Bus is very roomy and comfortable
   * Sporty Spice is arguably the most talented of the spices
   * `Girl Power' has something to do with Wonder-Bras and unwed
pregnancy, but I'm not sure because I nodded off for a bit
   * I believe that Posh Spice would best suit my mature and refined
demeanor
   * The best parts of the movie are when Mark McKean pitches ideas for
potential Spice Girls movie plotsall better than the one that
actually made it to the screen
   * Director Bob Spiers has proven that his previous flop, That Darn
Cat! (Worst 10 Films of 1997) was no fluke
   * I actually prayed for the songs.  The singing scenes were far less
vapid than the ones where the acting was trying to happen
   * There is nothing that can be found in a dark theater to aid a
person with a suicide attempt.  Believe me, I looked
   * The screenplay, by Kim Fuller (Tracy Takes On) and Jennifer
Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous) is as annoying as Tracy Takes On
and Absolutely Fabulous
   * The names of the Spice Girls should be changed to Red, Itchy,
Swollen, Burning and Painful (after a certain proctologic

Title
Review for Summer of Sam (1999)
You would think that a movie about David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam
killer, would be fascinating.  Well, it might be.  I don't know, because
Summer of Sam isn't that movie.  Replacing what could have been an
interesting story is a hodgepodge of dull characters played by even
duller actors with occasionally interesting photography and an
irritating score.  They say there are eight million stories in the naked
city, and they sure picked the dumbest one to tell.
The film opens and closes with a Jimmy Breslin narrative.  He's the guy
that Berkowitz wrote letters to during his killing spree in the dog days
of 1977.  That summer also featured scorching temperatures, a blackout
(and looting attendant thereto), the Yankees' run for the pennant, the
emergence of Studio 54 and the birth of the punk scene.  Director Spike
Lee (He Got Game), who co-wrote the script with first-timers Victor
Colicchio and Michael Imperioli (Christopher from The Sopranos), crams
so many plotlines and characters into the film that you could literally
nod off, wake up, and think that a completely different film was playing
(I didn't fall asleep, but really wish that I had).
Loosely held together by the killings are the stories of:
   * Sex-crazed Vinny (John Leguizamo, Spawn) and straight-laced Dionna
     (Mira Sorvino, At First Sight), a young couple plagued by
     hairdresser Vinny's infidelity and penchant for looking and acting
     like a Tony Manero (Saturday Night Fever) wannabe.  When he isn't
     trolling for tail, Vinny hangs out with
   * Joe T. (Michael Rispoli) and his Goomba gang of posturing failures
     that think that the .44 killer could be
   * Ritchie (Adrien Brody, The Thin Red Line), a burgeoning fan of the
     British punk scene (complete with bad English accent) who is forced
     to live in the garage after walking in on his mom and step-father
     in the midst of a raucous shag-fest.  Ritchie secretly works in a
     gay club, shoots porn and eventually starts the band Late Term
     Abortion with his girlfriend
   * Ruby (Jennifer Esposito, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), a
     vivacious neighborhood girl who shuns her Italian roots to be with
     the outcast Ritchie.  She ignores the fact that her boyfriend is on
     the short list of potential killers composed by
   * Luigi (Ben Gazzara, Happiness), the king of the community, who
     organizes a blackout party and arms the citizens with baseball bats
     to keep the looters out of his neighborhood.  Luigi was apparently
     somewhat of a father figure to
   * Detective Lou Petrocelli (Anthony LaPaglia, Lansky) who, together
     with Detective Curt Atwater (Roger Guenveur Smith), haplessly
     stagger in and out of the film in an attempt to catch the killer
   * David Berkowitz (Michael Badalucco, The Practice), a crazy guy who
     looks like he lives in a Nine Inch Nails video and is driven off
     the deep end by
   * His neighbor's dog (voiced by John Turturro) who will give hophead
     viewers something to piss their shorts over.
The film has occasional moments of visual brilliance, and viewers can
almost smell the stench of the rancid New York streets, thanks to
cinematographer Ellen Kuras' (The Mod Squad) rich photography.  Sam's
ending transforms the capture of Berkowitz into the fervor of a huge
rock concert.  But that's been done before (and better, in Natural Born
Killers).  And why is Berkowitz only shown sporadically through the
film?  Why don't we see what makes him tick?  For some reason, Lee
doesn't even show his face when he offs his victims.  Speaking of
victims, viewers will wish that each one of these horrible people in the
film would be a casualty.  And some will even wish that they were murder
victims as well.  And don't get me started on the extended orgy scene or
the two music videos that are roughly inserted into the film.  Lee is a
talented filmmaker, but only when he has a good script (read: not one of
his own).
There are precious few funny scenes (other than the talking dog), like
when Joe T. and gang go to a Late Term Abortion show at seminal punk
club CBGB, dressed like goodfellas, to question Ritchie about the
murders.  They walk out of the club saying that they could take ten
showers and still not rid themselves of the bar's fetor.  You could say
the same thing about Summer of Sam as you walk out of the theater.

Review for Snatch. (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2000 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Quentin Tarantino had the good sense to step back after the world ate up
the cinematic feast that was Pulp Fiction (that is, if you don't count
his forgettable appearances as an actor).  Or maybe the three and a half
years between Fiction's Golden Palm win at Cannes and the release of
Jackie Brown just seemed like an eternity.  While Brown wasn't embraced
as warmly by critics or viewers, the film was a step forward in terms of
Tarantino's visual style and, more importantly, it allowed the
writer/director to tell a different story with different characters.
Conversely, Guy Ritchie has quickly followed up his hit Lock, Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels with a film that shows very little growth.  Snatch
is simply more of the same, and could even be considered a companion
film to Lock, Stock.  It offers nothing new, but that's not necessarily
a bad thing.  You don't hear people complaining that George Lucas is
still making films about Jedi Masters and The Force, do you?
Snatch offers two different stories for your viewing pleasure.  One
features two amateur boxing promoters  Turkish (Jason Statham from
Lock, Stock) and Tony (Stephen Graham)  who inadvertently get wrapped
up in a fight-fixing scheme with a crooked Don King type aptly named
Brick Top (Lock, Stock's Alan Ford).  When Turkish and Tony's fighter,
Gorgeous George, is put out of commission just days before Brick Top's
fixed fight, the two protagonists have to lure a greasy, unintelligible,
bare-knuckled Gypsy legend (deftly played by Brad Pitt, Fight Club) to
stand in for their injured man.
In the meantime, an 84-karat diamond has been stolen from Antwerp by a
gambling addict named Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro, Traffic).
As the giant stone makes its way to London, groups of various thugs wait
to take it off Franky's hands (or take off Franky's hand, since the
diamond is in a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist).  There's the
seemingly indestructible Russian gangster Boris The Blade (Rade
Sherbedgia, Space Cowboys), the American crook Avi (Dennis Farina,
Reindeer Games) and a plethora of other zany characters that pass the
rock around like a hot potato.
The two stories converge at various times throughout the film, and all
of it is completely unbelievable, but entertaining nonetheless.  Ritchie
ups the formula he used in Lock, Stock by making Snatch's story a bit
more complicated, using more characters with wackier names played by
bigger acting talent.  Unfortunately, it's not nearly as funny or
well-structured as his previous film.  Instead, Snatch is like a typical
American blockbuster, where the plot takes a backseat to a collection of
cartoonish supporting characters and over-the-top action sequences. Some
of the unnecessary violence was reminiscent of the mean-spirited dud
Payback, but the boxing scenes were done very well.
On the plus side, Ritchie's gritty, stylish direction is just as slick
here as it was in Lock, Stock.  Whether you're talking about the
impressive title cards that introduce each character at the beginning of
the film, or the Run Lola Run-ish montage used to show Franky's gambling
addiction, or the accelerated/decelerated/repeated clips of key events,
Ritchie is clearly on top of his game.  The film is full of clever
editing (some of it is very much like Requiem For a Dream), dazzling
camera work and great music (plus a Madonna song, to boot).

Review for Baby Boy (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Since the turn of the century, there have been seven major motion pictures
released on Wednesdays that didn't precede holiday weekends.  Five of those
seven were films targeted to urban audiences, most of them were big bags of
crap (Next Friday, 3 Strikes, Backstage and Turn It Up), and the most recent
doesn't come close to bucking the trend.  Baby Boy is poorly written, poorly
directed, poorly acted and, worst of all, has the audacity to carry on for
over two hours.
Boy focuses on the life of a 20-year-old black man named Jody (R&B
star/model Tyrese), who spends his days kickin' it around Crenshaw like it
ain't no thang.  He's a pretty likeable lad, assuming your idea of
"likeable" is a man with no job, babies all over the city and not enough
common sense to pull his own pants up.  Jody still lives at home with his
36-year-old mother (Adrienne-Joi Johnson), where he rides his low-rider
bicycle and puts together model cars in his room, which is covered with
pictures of scantily clad women.
The first scene of the film brings up an interesting point about black men
in America being extremely infantile (they call their mothers "Momma," their
friends "boyz," and their homes "the crib"), while showing the adult Jody in
his mother's womb before transitioning into a scene where the mother of his
first child is having yet another of his babies aborted Yvette (Taraji P.
Henson) is in pain, both mentally and physically, and wants nothing to do
with her son's father.
So what does our boy do?  Heads over to see his second child's mother,
Peanut (Tamara LaSeon Bass).  She's in the shower when he drops in, but that
doesn't stop him from tearing open the shower curtain and demanding she
clean the place up and make him some mo-fo food (a real charmer, this Jody).
In the meantime, Jody's mom has begun to date Melvin (Ving Rhames, M-I:2), a
hard-edged OG ex-con who owns a landscaping business.  Jody hates Melvin's
checkered past, even though, if he's lucky, he'll end up just like him. He
demands Melvin show his mother respect, despite the fact that Jody gives
none to any of his own bitches.  There's also some hoo-ha about an older
brother who was kicked out of the house when Mom dated her last gangsta
boyfriend and was subsequently killed on the streets.  Jody is afraid the
same thing will happen to him, and there are all kinds of nightmarish
scenarios depicting the same.
Boy rambles on and on, with no rhythm and virtually no purpose (Jody does
eventually get a job...selling boosted women's clothes), other than to show
what is supposed to be the transition of a cocky boy into a real man.  I
didn't buy it and don't believe his character changed in the slightest.
We're talking about a guy who doesn't have a problem with hitting women,
stealing, disrespecting everyone within earshot and knocking up women left
and right, but then has the audacity to say, ""I ain't no killer - I can't
have that on my heart," in a pre-murder prayer before he snuffs the film's
only interesting character, played by Snoop Dogg.  When Snoop is the
highlight of your film, you've got big problems. Come to think of it, you've
got problems when you cast a model as your lead character.  Remember Fair
Game?  I didn't think so.
Okay, there's a chance I didn't get the whole thing because, after all, I am
the third whitest man in America (after Bryant Gumbel and Tony Gwynn).  But
before you start playing the race card, keep in mind the fact I loved Boy
writer/director John Singleton's first film, Boyz in the Hood, which landed
him two Oscar nominations 10 years ago.  Boy is supposed to be a "companion
piece" to Boyz, but don't sully its good name by comparing it to this mess.

Review for American Pie 2 (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The world needed American Pie about as badly as it needs Dubya leading it
into oblivion.  It was Porky's for the next generation (believe me, kids -
that's no compliment); a funny, teen-oriented film that people flocked to
even though they already knew its biggest gags.  Aside from the strong
performance by Jason Biggs, the three other main characters were so
painfully bland, they could be described as The Guy Who Acts Like He's 40
(Eddie Kaye Thomas), The Guy Who Acts Like He's Retarded (Chris Klein) and
The Guy Who May As Well Not Even Be There (Thomas Ian Nicholas).  And the
aforementioned world needs a sequel to Pie as badly as it needed Porky's 2:
The Next Day.
When we last saw our four Michigan misfits, Oz (Klein, Say It Isn't So) had
just fucked glee-club nerd Heather (Mena Suvari, Sugar & Spice), Kevin
(Thomas Ian Nicholas) had just fucked longtime girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid,
Josie and the Pussycats), and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas, Freddy Got Fingered)
had just fucked Stifler's mom (Jennifer Coolidge, Legally Blonde).  Our
hero, the nebbish Jim (Biggs, Saving Silverman), had fucked band geek
Michelle (Alyson Hannigan, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), after, of course,
fucking a pie and coming really close (twice) to fucking Nadia, a Czech
exchange student with a really bad accent (Shannon Elizabeth, Tomcats).
Hey, why mince words?  Pie was a movie about fucking, and the sequel isn't
any different.  Pie 2 opens just after the gang's freshman year of college
as they tackle the 12 weeks of summer with a party-minded vengeance.  Oz is
patiently waiting for Heather to return from a European trip so he can fuck
her.  Kevin really wants to fuck Vicky again, but she just wants to be
friends.  Finch can't stop thinking about fucking Stifler's mom, and poor
Jim is about to fuck a classmate (Joelle Carter, Just One Time) when his dad
(Eugene Levy, Down To Earth) walks in on them in the film's opening salvo.
It's a funny scene, but just about the entire thing is shown in Pie 2's
trailer, which was a big problem with the first film, as well.  When the
people sitting behind you at an advance screening recite the dialogue along
with the actors, you know they've divulged too much of the film in the
coming attractions.  Pie 2 is essentially built around five set pieces that
are very funny and extremely well-executed.  But two of these five scenes
are shown in the trailer, and everything that takes place between these five
scenes is crap.
When Stifler's (Seann William Scott, Evolution) summer party palace is
busted up by the fuzz, Kevin's wise old brother (Casey Affleck) suggests the
quintet rent out a summer home on Lake Michigan.  Most of the action takes
place here, where the boys are forced to get jobs as house painters to
afford their swank new digs.  And, of course, they get themselves in various
sexual predicaments that usually lead to subtle-as-a-jackhammer Pepsi
product placement.
To top it off, this Gen-Y Porky's is packed full of songs by blink-182, 3
Doors Down, Sum 41 and a myriad of other lame Abercrombie-core bands with
numeric monikers (I think my musical combo is going to be called Smell My
Weiner 285).  It might be easy to overlook the fact that most of these
"kids" are too old for grad school, but it's downright shocking to learn
that 22-year-old Natasha Lyonne (Scary Movie 2) is one of the youngest
actresses involved in Pie 2 (Elizabeth is 28, Hannigan 27, Reid 26).
Original directors Chris and Paul Weitz are producers here, handing the
reins over to James B. Rogers (Say It Isn't So), who was an associate
producer and assistant director on the first Pie.  Grand Rapids native Adam
Herz once again provides a script full of shocking, gross-out humor that is
rooted exclusively in bodily fluids and copulation.  If you like that kind
of humor, and aren't put off by the fact that most of the laughs have
already been given away for free, then Pie 2 will be a surefire hit.

Review for Perfect Murder, A (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
More than adequately suspenseful, A Perfect Murder one-ups its
predecessor with a bigger and better cast and a boatload of twists and
turns.  Based on the Frederick Knott play, which spawned the Hitchcock
thriller Dial M' for Murder, the modernization is a glowing exception
of a remake surpassing its original in terms of sheer entertainment
value.
Michael Douglas (The Game) stars as Steven Taylor, a seemingly
successful New York businessman married to trophy wife, Emily (Paltrow,
Sliding Doors), a United Nations employee.  They live in a swank pad
overlooking Central Park, but that don't mean they're happy  he's is
secretly going broke and she's boffing an angry long-haired artist named
David Shaw (Mortensen, G.I. Jane).
Not being a dumb guy, Steven quickly finds out about the affair and
confronts David with a strange proposition  murder Emily for $500,000.
Why does Steven want his wife dead?  Turns out she's worth millions and
needs the cash to keep his business afloat.  Why would David kill the
fuck-bunny that he's been more than eager to use for a sperm
receptacle?  He's really a gold digger who has already been convicted
twice and faces the deadly `three strikes  you're out' law if charged
again.  In fear of being caught for his previous scam in Florida, David
agrees to take $100,000 up front and the balance on receipt of the dead
babe.
While Steven has the entire murder planned out, things quickly spin out
of control.  By the time you realize that something is afoul, it becomes
impossible to tell who's trying to con who into what.  I've seen the
original and I was on the edge of my seat.  OK  slumped down on the
edge of my seat.  But you get the point.
Douglas is wonderful as the savvy equal to Gordon Gecko, although he is
flawed in different ways and much angrier and much scarier (I think).
He's the only guy that I can think of that can win the support of the
audience by trying to kill his wife.  Paltrow is, well, nice eye-candy.
She's perfect as a leggy May to Douglas' December and even spends time
in a subway and elevator ala Sliding Doors.
The ugly duckling of the threesome is Viggo Mortensen, who's pretty boy
looks make him more of a candidate for Melrose Place than the big
screen.  His chin dimple is a huge distraction, rivaling only Harry
Hamlin in terms of size and depth.  I spent too much time trying to
think of funny things to jam in there  a tennis ball, a rubber chicken,
Sandy Duncan's glass eye.  In certain light, Mortensen strikes a
disturbing resemblance to Douglas.
The real heroes of the film are, as always, behind the scenes.
Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski (The Crow) keeps everything dark but
bathes the leads in a warm overhead light.  The score, composed by James
Newton Howard (E.R.), is both eerie and precarious, and the direction
(Andrew Davis, The Fugitive  no stranger to making really old guys look
good) adds a classy touch to the mix.
Yeah, it's not The Spanish Prisoner, but that's like comparing apples
and oranges.  Or maybe apples and orange Jello.

Title
Review for Enemy at the Gates (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The most expensive European film ever made (reportedly $95 million) kicks
off with a 20-minute battle scene in which Russia's Red Army unsuccessfully
tries to drive Hitler's troops out of 1942 Stalingrad.  If Enemy at the
Gates had been released, oh, say, two and a half years ago, this opening
would have been downright shocking, but in our post-Saving Private Ryan
world, it feels blasé.  Is it horrifying?  You bet, but it still pales in
comparison to Ryan's graphic icebreaker.  We see the Volga River strewn with
debris that includes arms and legs, and a little Braveheart is thrown in for
good measure when the Russians charge toward their demise.  Of course, Ryan
and Braveheart weren't saddled with James Horner's unnecessary heavy-handed
score, either.
Set against the backdrop of the Battle of Stalingrad, Enemy is about a young
sniper from the Ural Mountains named Vassily Zaitsev (Jude Law, The Talented
Mr. Ripley), who, as we learn from the film's prelude, was educated in
marksmanship by his grandfather.  After the Germans wipe out most of the Red
Army in Enemy's opening scene, Vassily and a Russian political officer named
Danilov (Joseph Fiennes, Shakespeare in Love) meet while hiding out in a
pile of dead bodies.  One has a rifle, and one has five rounds of
ammunition, but before you can say "Texas Book Depository," Vassily has
scored five nice head shots on a group of nearby German officers.
The incident propels Vassily to hero status in Russia, thanks mostly to
Danilov's cunning in the production and distribution of a Russian war
newspaper that sings the praises of the Russian Davy Crockett (he killed him
a wolf when he was only five, as the legend goes).  Vassily's story
invigorates his homeland, which then proceeds to dig in their heels and push
the Germans out of their country in what became one of the key turning
points of World War II.  Danilov is Colonel Tom to Vassily's Elvis, making
him a larger-than-life figure, a national hero and a real thorn in Hitler's
side.
But the bulk of Enemy is comprised of a cat-and-mouse game between Vassily
and a German sniper named Koenig (Ed Harris, Pollock), who was brought in to
Stalingrad to eliminate his Russian counterpart.  It might sound exciting,
but a 15-minute set piece about two snipers can get pretty tiring.  You
could easily be on the edge of your seat for the first five minutes, lose
interest, and then fall asleep for the last five.  There's a lot of lying
around and remaining very still.  It takes a special director to pull this
off, and I'm not sure Jean-Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) is the
right guy. This is a typical David vs. Goliath battle that plays like the
Wachowski brothers' Assassins meets The Bad News Bears (with Sunshine's
Rachel Weisz playing the Tatum O'Neal role).
Weisz plays Tania, an educated Russian Jew who volunteered to fight the
Germans after they killed her parents.  Because she knows German, Danilov
wants Tania to stay behind the scenes with him to interpret intercepted
messages, while Vassily prefers she focus her rage on physical battles. The
men end up playing tug-of-war with Tania's skills and heart, which puts them
at odds with each other.  She prefers Vassily (the two share an extremely
laughable but really hot sex scene - it was so Vas-silly), so Danilov is
faced with the option of selling out his comrade for the chance to hit that
thang.  This all could have been left out to help Enemy's pacing.
In addition to putting American audiences in the unlikely position of
rooting for the Krushchev-led Russians, Enemy takes the unfortunate route of
having each character speak with a British accent (even the ones who
actually sound German).  It's a regrettable copout made by too many films
(except Traffic).  Harris, who logs a very nice performance here, goes in
and out of a clipped German accent like he's got a split personality.  On
the more positive side of things are the lovely costumes (from likely Oscar
winner Janty Yates, Gladiator), the beautifully dark photography (Robert
Fraisse) and really terrific sets, which are mostly comprised of the inside
and outside of crumbling buildings.
Besides Harris' turn as the steely Koenig, Bob Hoskins (Felicia's Journey)
does extremely well playing Nikita Krushchev, although he's only on the
screen for all of two minutes.  Law, Fiennes and Weisz are all capable but
do nothing too spectacular with their roles.

Review for Kid, The (2000)
Imagine Hollywood had something similar to baseball^Ňs Hall of Fame and
that retired/dead stars had to have their entire careers summarized in a
brief paragraph on a bronze plaque hanging in an overpriced tourist
attraction somewhere in Los Angeles. What the heck would Bruce Willis^Ň
plaque say? Would it mention his great work in edgy films like Pulp
Fiction and Twelve Monkeys? Probably not. Would the plaque list the
actor^Ňs popular action films like Die Hard and Armageddon? Maybe, but
this is probably how Willis^Ň plaque would read:
^ÓBorn in West Germany, ^ŃBruno^Ň made the successful leap from bartender
to television^Ňs Moonlighting to feature films in the late 1980s. Willis
was best known for starring opposite talented child actors and providing
the voices for infants. He was married to actress Demi Moore for ten
years, and the two superstars had three kids with really dumb names^Ô
Okay, the last part might not make it on there, but you get the point.
Despite having a pretty eclectic resumé, Willis^Ň career may be
remembered this way. Why? Because the following mathematical formula is
the hottest thing in Hollywood: ^ÓWillis + pre-pubescent boy + clever
script = box office gold^Ô
The movie with the kid who could see dead people made how much money?
Quick, let^Ňs get Willis in something else with a kid right away. The
result is Disney^Ňs The Kid, a whimsical tale about a grumpy workaholic
that gets in touch with the kid he used to be by actually meeting the
kid he used to be. That^Ňs right; through some sort of kooky Freaky
Friday movie magic, the grouch actually meets himself at age seven.
Willis (The Whole Nine Yards) plays Russell Morley Duritz, an
over-stressed image consultant with a twitchy left eye. The Kid^Ňs first
five minutes sets up Russell as a maniacal jerk that shuns his own
family but helps his crooked, high-profile clients look better in the
public^Ňs eye. Though this is supposed to make Russell an unsympathetic
character, I couldn^Ňt help but think that the world would be a better
place with more people like him. He^Ňs smart, efficient and cuts through
the bull with a blunt honesty that comes off as rude and arrogant. If
saying things that are on your mind is a bad thing, then lock me up.
A few days before his fortieth birthday, Russell begins seeing some
strange things. A red bi-plane seems to be following him around and a
snot-nosed kid appears in his house, somehow evading his
state-of-the-art security system. At first, he thinks he^Ňs hallucinating
the whole thing, but after comparing scars and birthmarks, he realizes
that the kid, Rusty (Spencer Breslin from the short-lived Dan Ackroyd
sitcom Soul Man), is really himself from thirty-two years ago.
The rest of The Kid involves Russell hating Rusty and trying to get rid
of him, but eventually growing attached to the boy and learning a little
bit about himself in the process before the film winds down to a
two-hankie finale that should choke up anyone that has recently had a
pulse. I^Ňm sure The Kid will hit home with anyone under age twelve or
over age forty, but everybody else might just roll their eyes at the
films sentimentality, which is hammered home by South Park musical
collaborator Marc Shaiman^Ňs sweeping score.
Breslin is a revelation as young Rusty, who shrieks his disappointment
that he grows up to be wife-less, dog-less and cool-job-less. Willis
plays a pretty good tight-ass but looks like he^Ňs having way too much
fun doing it. There are times when Willis is barely able to stifle his
smirk when he^Ňs supposed to be miserable. He did nasty and irritable
much better with General William Devereaux in The Siege. Willis^Ň
apparent new best friend Matthew Perry makes a funny unbilled cameo, as
well.
The Kid^Ňs script, which was written by Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award
winner Audrey Wells (Guinevere), is pretty clever for a family film, but
it had a bunch of problems, too. Russell spends his whole life trying to
distance himself from his past, yet somehow has totally forgotten the
most traumatic event that ever happened to him. And the film is dragged
down a bit by the romance between Russell and his perky moralistic
sidekick (played by British waif Emily Mortimer, Love^Ňs Labour^Ňs Lost).
She^Ňs not even the best match for Russell. He would have been better off
with his wisecracking personal assistant (Lily Tomlin, Tea With
Mussolini) or a local television news anchor (Jean Smart from Wells^Ň
Guinevere).
The Kid was directed by Jon Turteltaub, who has helmed such
non-kid-friendly films as Instinct and Phenomenon. It plays pretty
similarly to a couple of films that have already come out this year,
especially the arthouse release of Pip Karmel^Ňs Me Myself I, where
Rachel Griffiths goes through a similar ordeal on her thirtieth
birthday. You know, movies like these are the reason people dread the
big 3-0 and 4-0 (and beyond). They aren^Ňt upset about getting older ^Ö
they^Ňre worried about having to meet themselves.

Title
Review for Monkeybone (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The trailers for Monkeybone trumpet that it was made by the creators of The
Nightmare Before Christmas, which is making a lot of people think ultra-cool
director Tim Burton has something to do with the film.  He doesn't - Burton
only produced and co-wrote Nightmare.  The good news is that Monkeybone
director Henry Selick, who directed Nightmare and the equally hip James &
The Giant Peach, is probably the only person who can even come close to
making a Burton-esque film.
Monkeybone's opening credits show an artist creating a cartoon that he hopes
will become an integral part of a surprise marriage proposal.  The artist is
Stu Miley (Brendan Fraser, Bedazzled), the creator of a popular animated
television show about a frenzied, Roger Rabbit-like monkey (it's called
"Monkeybone").  Stu is shy, introverted, and totally freaked out by his own
success, as evidenced by his discomfort at a public premiere of his latest
show.  He's also dead-set against the merchandising of various Monkeybone
products, despite the pleadings of his business manager (Dave Foley).
Stu tries to leave the post-premiere party early to pop the big question to
his girlfriend, Julie (Bridget Fonda, Lake Placid).  But they're involved in
a car wreck (a funny one, if there is such a thing) that leaves Stu in a
very Trainspotting-ish coma.  Julie is devastated, but Stu's sister (Will &
Grace's Megan Mullally) wants to pull the plug.
The fun really starts when Stu enters his coma world.  It's a nightmarish
land of carnival rides, martinis and Rose McGowan in a low-cut cat suit
(geez, it sounds really awful).  In this in-between world known as Downtown,
people in situations similar to Stu's experience have their nightmares come
true.  For Stu, this means Monkeybone (voiced by John Turturro) has become
real, and his creation becomes a real pain in the neck, as well.  The chimp
hops around like David Arquette on speed and generally makes Stu's life even
more miserable.  After all, a cartoon monkey can't really replace somebody
like Bridget Fonda.
Without going into too much detail about the story, I'll just say Monkeybone
and Stu head back to real life in two different bodies - one of which is a
recently deceased organ donor played by Saturday Night Live's Chris Kattan
(it's one of the funniest physical comedy bits you'll ever see).  If you
don't pay too much attention to the plot, which involves a dream god
(Giancarlo Esposito) who tries to increase the world's nightmare output, you
should find Monkeybone pretty darn entertaining.
Monkeybone is based on Kaja Blackley's comic book called "Dark Town," which
was adapted by Sam Hamm, who has worked on several of Burton's films
(including the upcoming Planet of the Apes remake).  Helping to make the
picture look like one of Burton's is Sleepy Hollow's production designer
Bill Boes.  Monkeybone has sets The Grinch wishes it could have had.  The
film effectively blends stop-frame animation with live action, and flaunts
visual effects that may not be topped this year.

Title
Review for Species II (1998)
More of a soft-core porno than a sci-fi thriller, Species II fails to
live up to its predecessor in terms of story, direction or amount of
nudity.  And let's face it, the bar wasn't really set that high to begin
with.  Errrexcept for the latter.
The whole idea of the story is so implausible that it makes David Lynch
easy to understand.  It seems that the government has recreated the
alien from the first film  the one that they destroyed  in an attempt
to evaluate potential vulnerabilities on the off chance that they ever
choose to attack Earth.  This time, she's called Eve (Natasha
Henstridge, Maximum Risk) and is isolated in a high security lab far
away from the men that she needs to procreate.  This babe gets all moist
when she sees Michael Madsen, so you know she's just aching for it.
Like Banky says in Chasing Amy, `Chicks need dick.  I mean, they just
plain NEED it' and Eve is certainly no exception.
The dick is Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), the astronaut son of a
successful Senator (James Cromwell, Babe).  We are introduced to Patrick
as he becomes the first man to walk on Mars, in a mission to collect
dirt from the red planet.  Why a three-man crew needed to do this, I
will never know.
In this dirt is some very unfriendly space goo that thaws and runs about
the floor of the spacecraft.  As it reaches the unsuspecting trio, they
suddenly lose about eight minutes of time.  This is fine with me because
it's eight less minutes that I have to suffer through on the screen.
Did I mention that the ship is plastered with advertisements for various
companies that really exist?  I was relieved to find out that Microsoft
doesn't take over the world in the future, but my contentment was short
lived because I think that Species II actually takes place in the
present.  My evidence is twofold  the presence of a Bill Clinton photo
behind Senator Ross' desk and the Clinton-esque Richard Belzer
portraying the leader of the free world.
Anyway, the space goo gets all into Patrick's head and somehow turns him
into an alien.  This means that every time he bangs some girl, she
becomes instantly pregnant and gives violent bloody birth in a just a
few minutes.  Since Patrick is a national hero, he's getting all kinds
of hot action - including two sisters - and soon has a whole pack of
creepy Village of the Damned type kids following him around.  In other
news, Patrick's blood can also morph into an alien.  I don't even know
what this means.
The government, led by fathead Marilyn Manson twin Colonel Carter
Burgess (George Dzundza, Basic Instinct), hires the fathead who helped
save the planet in the first picture, Press Lennox (Madsen, Reservoir
Dogs).  Together, they track down Patrick and find an unlikely ally in
sickle-cell anemia.  Now that's a strange twist.
On a positive note, Species II is mercifully short and boasts a
collection of at least five pairs of naked breasts.  It is the latter,
not the former, that results in the PLANET SICK-BOY rating.

Title
Review for Drowning Mona (2000)
 Every film with Bette Midler should start with her driving off of a
cliff.  It could be a recurring cinematic gag  like when Kenny buys the
farm on each episode of South Park.  Somebody actually suggested that
Midler's new film Drowning Mona would be entertaining because she was
playing a character that was really despicable and obnoxious.  I
explained that Midler has already done despicable and obnoxious five
weeks ago in the atrocious Isn't She Great, and hinted that the
horse-faced diva probably wasn't even acting in either film.
Midler stars as Mona Dearly, a vindictive meanie from Verplanck, New
York, that terrorizes her family and anybody else stupid enough to cross
her path.  When Mona's Yugo takes a swan dive into the Hudson River and
the resulting investigation reveals that her brakes were tampered with,
everyone in the tiny burg becomes a suspect.  Husband Phil (William
Fichtner, Go) is having an affair with a slutty waitress named Rona
(Jamie Lee Curtis, Virus), so they both have a motive.  As does son Jeff
(Marcus Thomas, Palmetto), although I won't say why (even though Mona's
trailer shows it, the film saves it for the big final reel surprise).
Sheriff Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito, Man on the Moon) can't even rule out
his own daughter Ellen (Neve Campbell, Scream 3) or her fiancé Bobby
Calzone (Casey Affleck, 200 Cigarettes), the latter of whom owns a
struggling landscaping business with the lazy, dimwitted Jeff.  As Rash
investigates the crime, the film flashes back to show everybody's
individual beef with the late Mona.  The result is a sloppy whodunit
that tries too hard to be quirky and, instead, is a pretty darn dull
knock-off of Fargo.  Most of the funny parts are shown in the trailer
and, of course, the ending is pretty predictable.  The only surprise in
the film is that Affleck (Ben's brother) has the biggest role in the
film, despite four other names reading above Mona's title.
Mona is another weak big-screen directorial effort from Nick Gomez, who
has done some much better work on television (Homicide, The Sopranos and
OZ), and the paper-thin script was written by first-timer Peter
Steinfeld.  Mona was financed by DeVito's Jersey Films, a production
company the diminutive actor runs with Hollywood cohorts Michael
Shamberg and Stacy Sher.  While Jersey has pumped out some of the best
cinema in recent years (Gattaca, Pulp Fiction and Out of Sight), they're
also creating a disturbing trend by casting their littlest partner in
their projects that are, at best, mediocre (Get Shorty, Man on the Moon
and Living Out Loud).  DeVito isn't in Jersey's upcoming Erin
Brockovich, so you may just want to save your money for that film.

Title
Review for He Got Game (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
With his latest film He Got Game, writer/director Spike Lee has crafted
a film that's both lovely and enjoyable to watch as his previous effort,
Girl 6.  Like Girl 6, Lee has chosen a subject typically worthy of an
eighty-five minute picture and fashioned it into a sweeping epic.
PssssstI'm joking.  He Got Game is a long, boring, meandering, dog of a
movie.  One might compare watching it to walking forty acres with a
mule, but I see it as more of pissing-a-kidney stone with a side order
of numb-ass.
The main story is simple enough to barely fill an after school special 
jailed Jake Shuttlesworth (Washington) gets a one week release from
prison to persuade his estranged son and top basketball recruit, Jesus
(NBA's Ray Allen), to attend the Governor's alma mater in an attempt to
win a chance at early parole.  Since Jake is in the big house for
killing Jesus' mom, his task seems a formidable one.
Among other prominent problems, Lee takes over two hours to lead the
viewer to the glaringly obvious one-on-one game between Jake and Jesus.
In fact, the two only have about four scenes together.  So what do you
fill the two hours with?  For starters, there is the completely
worthless sub-plot of Jake's romance with a fleabag whore (Jovovich).
There's also Jesus' relationship with plotting girlfriend, Lala (Rosario
Dawson).  But mostly there is a whole lot of Oliver Stone-style
flashbacks and editing, teamed with a nails-across-the-blackboard score
by Aaron Copeland.
On a positive note, Game features one of the most graphically hilarious
three-way sex scenes that I have ever viewed.  And there is a vomiting
scene, too.  But these are not nearly enough to make Game worthy of
renting, let alone shelling out green for.  Stay home and roll your
loose change instead.

Review for Scary Movie 2 (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The poster for Scary Movie proudly declared there wouldn't be a sequel, and
there really shouldn't have been.  It's yet another testament to the power
of the almighty dollar.  Here's how the conversation probably went down on
the Monday morning after its $42 million opening weekend (which was less
than one year ago):
Bob Weinstein: "Hey, fellas.  We'd like you to do a sequel.  How quickly can
you make it happen?"
Keenan Ivory Wayans: "Ummm...we're ready right now."
Weinstein: "Really.  What's the sequel about?"
Shawn Wayans: "Well, errrr, this time we're going to make fun of older
horror films instead of the newer ones."
Marlon Wayans: "Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!"
The original was mostly a send-up of the Scream series (which made it a
spoof of a spoof), but the sequel is a lot messier.  Scary Movie 2 has a
bigger budget and bigger stars, but it's not nearly as funny.  Part of it
has to be attributable to the quick turnaround time, which becomes painfully
obvious when you see send-ups of recent hits like Charlie's Angels and
Hannibal. The sequel doesn't even roll outtakes during the closing credits,
presumably because they had to scrape every inch of film together to break
the 80-minute running time.
The principals are back both in front of and behind the camera, with Keenan
Ivory Wayans directing brothers Marlon and Shawn, who are also two of the
film's seven screenwriters.  Anna Faris (who looks completely different) and
Regina King are back as well, alongside newcomers Tori Spelling, Christopher
Kennedy Masterson (Malcolm in the Middle) and Kathleen Robertson
(Beautiful).  Hey, didn't Shawn and Regina die in the first one?
This time around, the kids are in college and are required to spend the
weekend in an allegedly haunted house as a course requirement of a lecherous
professor (Tim Curry) and his wheelchair-bound assistant (David Cross, who
has the best cinematic comb-over since Bill Murray's coif in Kingpin).  The
caretaker of Hell House is played by Chris Elliott, who sports a gimpy arm.
Wheelchair-bound?  Gimpy arm?  I can practically hear Eric Cartman
screaming, "Cripple fight!"
Okay, so there isn't much of a story, but Scary 2 is still full of the sick
sight gags that made the first one such a hit.  Commercials for the film
that ran as recently as a few days before it opened claimed the film wasn't
yet rated, which means the producers were probably trying to decide if they
should tame it down to a PG-13 or keep it a more disgusting R.  Here's your
answer:  There's a piss scene within 90 seconds, a priest taking a shit less
than three minutes later, and the film's first vomit scene comes within the
first six minutes.  And, yes, there's another gratuitous dick scene.
There are a bunch of cool cameos, too, like James Woods (who replaced a
sickly Marlon Brando at the last minute), Andy Richter, Richard Moll and
Natasha Lyonne.  But best of all is Beetlejuice from The Howard Stern Show,
who makes a brief but unforgettable appearance.

Review for Wild Wild West (1999)

President Grant assigns two U.S. Marshals (Will Smith and Kevin Kline)
to stop a deranged madman (Kenneth Branagh) from wreaking havoc on the
country with a giant mechanical spider.
That's the basic premise of Wild Wild West.  Now let's break it down:
Take out `Will Smith' and `Kevin Kline' because everyone knows that
they're the stars of this film.  Take out `two U.S. Marshals to' because
it's common knowledge that Smith and Kline are reprising roles
popularized by the 60s television show of the same name.  Take out `a
giant mechanical spider' because it's already been rammed down the
throat of you, the moviegoer, for several months (via the trailer).
Take out `Kenneth Branagh' and `deranged madman' because the two are
mutually exclusive and, therefore, should cancel each other out.  Take
out `from wreaking havoc on the country' because you should expect
nothing less from a deranged madman.  Take out `President Grant assigns'
becausewell, just because I've written myself into a hole.
What do we have left from our original sentence?
Stop paying to see movies like this.  Then studios will stop making
movies like this and stop ripping off old movies and TV shows.  Please
make them stop.
West opens in 1869 Louisiana, where we encounter a terrified man with a
giant metal collar around his neck.  He's running from a deadly spinning
disc that seems intent on removing his head from his torso.  It does.
Then the film launches into its finest moment  the slick retro opening
credits, which are a hopped-up version of the TV version.  But it's all
downhill from there.
Smith (Enemy of the State) plays James T. West, the character previously
handled on television by Robert Conrad.  That's right; Will Smith.
Playing a U.S. Marshal in 1869.  In the South.  Anybody have a problem
with this?  I guess the filmmakers decided it was okay to cast West
black so they could add the racism jokes and the hysterical lynching
scene.  Bruce Willis just wouldn't have cut it in the noose.  Besides,
everybody likes watching Smith on the big screen so that we can forget
just how annoying his yapping real-life wife is.
Kevin Kline (William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream) is Artemus
Gordon, a Marshal slightly more refined than the trigger-happy West.
Gordon is content to work without a sidearm and almost seems too eager
to don dress and makeup to catch his man.  He also likes to invent
things - like the airplane he quickly whipped up to beat the enormous
spider.  In 1869.  Decades before Kitty Hawk.  It actually made The
A-Team look realistic.  Gordon is also a master of disguise and, at one
point, impersonates President Grant.  Dave anyone?
Kenneth Branagh (Celebrity) handles the role of Dr. Arliss Loveless 
previously a midget on the television show, but missing his legs on the
big screen  a victim of the Civil War (and, more specifically,
according to Lovelace, the premature surrender of the Confederacy).  He
also is short one lung, bladder, a kidney and approximately 32 feet of
intestines, but does have facial hair that made me think of the Insane
Clown Posse.  Loveless has kidnapped scientists specializing in physics
and hydraulics in order to build his death spider, which he unveils at
the opening of the Transcontinental Railroad in Utah.  Instead of a cool
sidekick, he has three comely underlings: Amazonia (supermodel
Frederique Van Der Wal), Munitia (Musetta Vander, Mortal Kombat:
Annihilation) and Lippenreider (Sofia Eng).  She reads lips.  Get it?
Point the finger of shame at the crack staff of writers, who previously
churned out earlier crap like Ghost Dad and Doc Hollywood.  Don't let
director Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black) off the hook either.  He's
0-for-2 since abandoning films that don't feature a character named
`Lerch.'
Other annoyances included Gordon's invention of a primitive type of
Kevlar, which stopped a bullet fired at point-blank range into West's
chest.  There were a slew of hit-and-miss double entendres, mostly
involving blacks and cripples.  Then there was the ending, where Grant
enlisted West and Gordon to create the Secret Service because they did
such a good job protecting him.  The Secret Service was actually created
a few years earlier for the sole purpose of preventing counterfeiting;
they didn't protect the President until about sixty years later.  And
don't forget the IQ-reducing theme song.  I made my own up

Title
Review for American Rhapsody, An (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Many films based on true stories probably seem like good ideas while
storyboarding but suffer because there just isn't that much happening on
screen.  That's not to say they're bad, but a real-life event doesn't
automatically make for an entertaining movie.  Take that trip I made to the
gas station on the way to work today.  It was uneventful, and while I'm
happy with the way things turned out, it isn't something that should be
rushed into production anytime soon.
That's part of the problem with An American Rhapsody - it's just a bunch of
stuff that happens.  The film kicks off during the early 1950s in
Soviet-controlled Hungary, where a young family is about to hightail it
through the Red Curtain to make a new life for themselves in America.  Peter
(Tony Goldwyn, Bounce) and his kin are well off (he owns a publishing house,
just like Goldwyn's character in Substance of Fire), which makes it easier
to bribe their way into Austria.  With him are wife Margit (Nastassja
Kinski, The Claim) and young daughter Marie (Kelly Banlaki).  Not making the
journey is their infant, Suzanne, who will stay behind and, somehow, meet
them in Vienna in a few days (it's never clearly explained).
Of course, things go wrong and the family is forced to leave for the U.S
before little Suzanne can meet them, because it's apparently really
important to stick to an itinerary when you're taking a trip.  While Peter
and crew eat barbeque and listen to Elvis in suburban Los Angeles, Suzanne
is stuck with a pair of surrogate parents (Zsuzsa Czinkóczi and Balázs
Galkó) back in Budapest, where, presumably, she eats kindling and listens to
Zamfir.  But she's happy, and that's all that matters.
With help from the Red Cross, Peter and Margit are finally able to have
young Suzanne flown to the United States, where she is finally reunited with
the parents she never knew.  She has trouble fitting in (think having an
older sister is hard?  Try one who literally can't understand you) and longs
to return to the people who raised her, considering them more parental than
her biological parents.  Rhapsody flashes forward several years, where
Suzanne (Scarlett Johansson, Ghost World) is now a rebellious teen who
constantly butts heads with her mother, who has now become a Red Curtain
unto herself, locking Suzanne into her bedroom and barring the windows shut.
To escape the oppression, Suzanne decides to go back to Hungary.
This is where things begin to go askew in the film.  For starters, it's hard
to believe a teenage girl would want to ditch mid '60s suburban Southern
California for Cold War Budapest, no matter how badly her life is going (she
could have hung around a few more years and joined the Manson Family, for
pete's sake).  Plus it offers little resolution to the preceding scenes of
full-on teen angst.  But, again, it's a true story, so you can't complain
too much about the lack of excitement.
Writer/director Éva Gárdos, who makes her debut behind the camera here, has
created a partially autobiographical film of her own youth.  She previously
worked as an editor, most recently on two films directed by Anjelica Huston
(Bastard Out of Carolina and Agnes Browne).  Gárdos certainly has an eye for
striking images, especially the shot of Suzanne wearing a red coat while
standing on a bridge in gray, lifeless Budapest. She also chose to shoot the
film's early scenes in black and white, switching to color stock when the
family finally crosses the border into Austria.
Rhapsody loses a bunch of points for having a third act that doesn't make
much sense, but gains some back for not being the calculating tearjerker you
might expect.  And it scores even more points for not wussing out on the
whole language thing.  I screened Rhapsody a few days after seeing Captain
Corelli's Mandolin, in which Nicolas Cage pretended he was an Italian
speaking Greek but was reciting his lines English the whole damn time.
That's not good enough for me, and it's not good enough for Rhapsody,
either.  Goldwyn and Kinski actually speak Magyar in the film's early scenes
(they're subtitled), which is a hundred times more enjoyable than hearing
them butcher some accent.

Review for Wo hu cang long (2000)
Hollywood marketing departments are always declaring that their
particular film has something to offer to every type of moviegoer, but,
until now, they've all been blowing smoke up your ass.  Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon defines the term `something for everyone,' and, what's
more, it accomplishes this rare feat in a way that will leave you
breathless.
Allow me to use an anonymous family to illustrate Dragon's appeal to a
wide array of potential viewers. Mom likes sweeping romances, and Dragon
offers one of the year's best. It's also one of the finest martial arts
films ever made, which thrills little Bobby to no end.  Big sister
Claire is a big fan of Yo-Yo Ma, who provides the film with a number of
haunting cello solos.  Aunt Sally is an aging militant feminist, but
even she's impressed by Dragon's strong portrayal of women.  Grandma
enjoys the picture's subtitles, on account of not being able to hear a
goddamn thing, and Dad has a little thing for Asian chicks.  Despite the
vast differences in this family's cinematic taste, each of these six
people is going to ride home from the theater with a smile plastered on
their face.
Dragon is set in and around Beijing in the early 19th century.  Giang Hu
warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat, Anna & the King) has just quit the
martial arts business, choosing literally to hang up his blade in favor
of a life of meditation and reflection.  His sword, a 400-year-old
weapon named Green Destiny, is temporarily presented to an old friend,
Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh, Tomorrow Never Dies).  But the sword is
stolen one night, leading Li to momentarily interrupt his new lifestyle
to face the evil force that took the life of his Giang Hu master.
Meanwhile, Yu befriends young Jen (Ziyi Zhang), the Governor's wispy
daughter who is being forced to marry a guy she doesn't like.  She is
jealous of Yu's adventurous past, but Jen doesn't realize her dedication
to an honorable life cost her a shot at trying to land Li.  When the
sword is stolen, Yu suspects Jen may be involved.  And then the fighting
starts.
Maybe `fighting' isn't the right word.  This is more like air ballet.
When Dragon's first hand-to-hand clash hits the screen, you'll think
your eyes are playing tricks on you.  In fact, some people even
snickered and guffawed at the pre-festival press screening at the
Toronto Film Festival (where Dragon was the audience's pick for the best
picture).  Choreographer Yuen Wo Ping (The Matrix), who directed the
original Drunken Master film, outdoes himself here, and the result is
likely to knock the socks off kids weaned on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Don't get the idea that Dragon is just an action flick  martial arts
films have never been able to boast acting this strong before.  Though
Chow Yun-Fat is the best-known actor of the bunch, his role is really
just a supporting effort.  Yeoh's part is a lot juicier, and she handles
it remarkably well.  The two Hong Kong legends do an incredible job of
acting uncomfortable and stumbling around, like actual people trying to
hide their feelings for each other.  As good as they are, Dragon's real
star is Ziyi Zhang, who is both breathtakingly beautiful and
astonishingly believable as a pint-sized punch Princess.
Dragon's biggest problem is that its story is a bit muddled.  The film
is based on a five-volume novel by Wang Du Lu, so there's a good chance
that a lot of the original continuity was abandoned to keep the running
time from exceeding the two-hour mark.  Dragon also features a goofy `be
true to yourself' message, and there are probably a couple of times when
you may think, `Geez, this is just Mortal Kombat with an international
cast and a love story.'  There's probably a very fine line between the
two, but Dragon is definitely superior in every aspect.
Dragon is the first Chinese-language feature that Taiwanese filmmaker
Ang Lee (Ride With the Devil) has directed since 1994's Eat Drink Man
Woman.  Like most of Lee's films, Dragon is beautifully shot and
surprisingly funny.  The gorgeous cinematography comes courtesy of Peter
Pau, who has shot big Hong Kong features like The Bride With White Hair
and John Woo's classic The Killer.  Wang Du Lu's novel was co-adapted by
first-timer Kuo Jung Tsai, Eat Drink Man Woman's Wang Hui-Ling and
longtime Lee collaborator James Schamus.  With this feature, Lee proves
he is one of the industry's most versatile directors.
2:00  PG-13 for martial arts violence and some sexuality

Title
Review for Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
There's just no middle ground when it comes to Eddie Murphy films.  It's
either a throw-your-hands-in-the-air blockbuster that spawns an incredible
amount of sequels (like Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours, The Nutty Professor
and, eventually Shrek), or a flop that is swept under the carpet so quickly
that most people have forgotten it ever existed (like Holy Man, Vampire in
Brooklyn and Metro).  What is it about Murphy that makes people want to
watch him play the same roles over and over again?  You don't see it with
his comedic contemporaries, like Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey (I'm still
pretending Ace Ventura 2 never happened).  Murphy could probably pump a
sequel to Professor out every two years and still gross well over $100
million at the box office each time.
Dr. Dolittle 2 probably won't be much of an exception, but that certainly
doesn't mean it's a good film.  In fact, it will probably gross less than
the first version did, which brings up another interesting point about
Murphy:  How come the films in which he doesn't primarily appear as himself
make so much less money?  Think about it.  People love his voice work in
animation (Shrek, Mulan) and think it's great when he's hidden behind fat
suits and prosthetics (Professor), but when it's just Eddie, it's usually a
bomb.  Not counting Dolittle, which was really more about the talking
animals than Murphy, his last genuine box-office hit that wasn't either
animated or a sequel was 13 years ago (Coming to America).  Most of Dolittle
2's target audience wasn't even alive back then.
In Dolittle 2, Murphy reprises his role as the titular John Dolittle, a San
Francisco doctor who, since the closing credits rolled in the 1998 original,
has become a world-famous, globetrotting superstar, much to the displeasure
of his neglected family.  His practice now treats both humans and animals,
and Dolittle spends a lot of free time with various animal support groups,
as well.  When he does manage to find his way home, the family's quiet
moments are routinely interrupted by animals with strange physical ailments
looking for the healing hands of the good doctor.
One such interruption comes via a wiseguy raccoon (Michael Rappaport) who
swears he's not in the Mafia and insists Dolittle meet his boss, the Beaver
(Richard C. Sarafian).  The Beaver tries to enlist Dolittle to stop the
deforestation of a large wooded area outside San Francisco proper.
Dolittle's attorney wife (Kristen Wilson) advises him the only way to stop
the loggers (led by 3000 Miles to Graceland's Kevin Pollack and Sleepy
Hollow's Jeffrey Jones) from going chop-crazy is to find an endangered
species in the forest and attempt to create offspring of said species.
There is one rare female Pacific Northwest bear (Lisa Kudrow, Lucky
Numbers), but the only male in existence has been working in a circus his
entire life (Steve Zahn, Saving Silverman).  Will Dolittle postpone his
family's much-needed vacation to attempt mating a circus bear with a forest
bear?  Do they shit in the woods?  (The bears, not the Dolittles.)
Dolittle and family move to the forest, where the doctor tries to train
Archie the circus bear to survive in the wild (they call it a
"bear-a-thon"), and the bear even helps him learn a little bit about
himself, too.  And the whole time, all I could think of was the Robert
Schimmel joke (Q. How do they teach bears to ride bikes?  A. They nail their
feet to the pedals and beat the shit out them.) that was funnier than
anything in the movie.  The animals piss, shit and fart up a storm, and
there's enough gags about ball-licking and various sexual acts to make you
wonder how this earned a PG rating.  But what else would you expect from a
film that is narrated by a talking dog (Norm Macdonald) and stars a drunken,
sweater-wearing monkey?
The original Dolittle (not the Rex Harrison one) was directed by Betty
Thomas, who was hot off the success of Private Parts and Late Shift.  This
time, the reins are handed to Steve Carr, whose only feature film credit was
the nearly unwatchable Next Friday.  Carr has worked on numerous music
videos for the likes of Method Man, Jay-Z and Redman - not exactly a sound
pick for a children's film, but stranger things have happened (remember
Julia Roberts and Lyle Lovett?).  I'm not sure Dolittle is bad enough to
have original author Hugh Lofting spinning in his grave, but it ain't no
Babe, either.

Title
Review for Serendipity (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Have you ever tasted anything so sweet it makes you sick to your stomach?
If you like that feeling, there's more than a good chance you'll like
Serendipity, a new humdrum, paper-thin version of Sleepless in Seattle with
John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale taking over for Tom and Meg.  The film is
forced and utterly predictable, despite two decent performances from the
very likeable, charismatic leads.  Other than that, the best thing I can say
about Serendipity is that it's short.
The action begins a decade in the past where Jonathan Trager (Cusack,
America's Sweethearts) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale, Pearl Harbor) meet
in a Christmas-shopping free-for-all at Bloomingdale's.  Each has a
significant other, but when they reach for the same pair of black cashmere
gloves, the sparks fly and the two spend a few hours ice-skating and eating
at a trendy cafe called Serendipity.
Although she's clearly interested in Jonathan, Sara lays some destiny
twaddle on him and refuses to give him her name, letting fate determine the
outcome of any potential relationship.  Sara makes Jonathan write his name
and phone number on a $5 bill (which she uses to by some mints), while she
scribbles her name and number on the inside of the novel she's reading
(which she sells to a used bookstore the following morning).  If Jonathan
and Sara are somehow able to find each other (via the book or the fin),
that'll be destiny's way of saying they're meant to be together. The book,
by the way, is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera, which
is about a man who waits 50 years to get the girl.
Nobody would want to see 75-year-old versions of Cusack and Beckinsale get
together, so Serendipity makes them wait only ten years.  At this point,
Sara is living in San Francisco and has just gotten engaged to a kooky
Eastern music star (John Corbett, Dinner Rush).  Meanwhile, Jonathan is
still in New York City and about to marry his slightly bitchy fiancee
(Bridget Moynahan, Coyote Ugly).  It's hard to say whether Jonathan is still
obsessed with finding Sara or if he just has cold feet, but he continues to
track down the girl of his dreams, who ironically is headed to Manhattan the
same weekend his wedding is scheduled to take place.  Sara says she's going
away to clear her head but is really hoping to run into Jonathan.
The two search for each other, and narrowly miss meeting a dozen or so
times.  What's the point?  You know they'll eventually find each other and
make sweet love down by the fire.  To liven things up, each has their own
comedic sidekick (Osmosis Jones' Molly Shannon and The Family Man's Jeremy
Piven) to aid in their seemingly impossible effort.  Piven plays Jonathan's
best man, which is somewhat scary considering his hijinks at the bachelor
party in Very Bad Things.
It's no surprise to learn Serendipity's contrived screenplay came from Marc
Klein, whose biggest previous foray into feature film was working as an
assistant on the equally syrupy While You Were Sleeping.  Director Peter
Chelsom continues his downward slide since helming the enjoyable Funny Bones
(he followed that with The Mighty and Town and Country).  The best parts of
the film revolve around Eugene Levy (American Pie 2), who logs a memorable
performance as an uptight Bloomingdale's salesman.

Review for War Zone, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Actor Tim Roth's directorial debut has already garnered incredible
reviews and multiple awards/nominations during its European run.  But as
The War Zone is set to open in North America, it lacks both a major
distributor and the buzz necessary to propel the film through the award
season.  The reason is simple - the theme of the film (incest) is just
too disturbing.  When the director describes his feelings toward the
subject matter as "disgusting and evil," marketers and potential viewers
tend to back away.  The last film that shook me up this much was
Anjelica Huston's Bastard Out of Carolina (ironically, another actor
making a directorial debut), which went straight to cable because of the
premise (child abuse).
The War Zone opens in an isolated part of North Devon, where a family of
four has just moved from London.  They appear to be a happy, cohesive
unit - wisecracking, blue-collar Dad (Ray Winstone, Nil By Mouth),
pregnant Mum (Tilda Swinton, Orlando) and their two teenage children
that miss the bustle of London: 18-year-old Jesse (Lara Belmont) and
15-year-old Tom (Freddie Cunliffe).  Other than being a little open with
nudity, the family seems to be as normal as can be.  But, then again,
the Burhams seemed pretty normal on the surface of American Beauty, too.
After the birth of his baby sister, Tom begins to suspect something
devious is going on between his dad and Jessie.  He thinks they may have
been in the shower together and he finds naked pictures of his older
sister in a dresser.  Tom confronts Jessie, but she denies everything. 
As his suspicion grows, you can almost feel the emptiness in Tom's
stomach when he watches Dad play with the new baby.  Then, one day in an
old military bunker near their home, Tom stumbles onto a situation that
will forever change the family.
The film is brutal to watch, even for a hardened viewer like myself.  At
the screening I attended during the Toronto International Film Festival,
many film fans walked out during the bunker scene.  One man shouted "Is
this really necessary?" at the screen before loudly chastising the
remaining audience for "just sitting there."  His ranting could still be
heard as he stormed through the lobby and out the door.  The scene is
that powerful.  It seems to go on for ages and was uncomfortable enough
before the outburst.
Roth's (Hoodlum) filmmaking debut is as good as they come, purposefully
leaving many questions open after the credits roll.  He refused to
answer many questions during the Q&A session after the screening, often
responding "Well, what do you think?" to queries about characters.  He
appeared visibly nervous, saying that the book (written by Alexander
Stuart) made him weep, while the subject matter "disturbs the f--- out
of him."  Roth, who alluded to the fact that he too was a victim of
similar abuse, said that he tried to be honest and respectful to the
subject matter that obviously hit close to him for him and a surprising
portion of the audience.
During the Q&A, Belmont was standing off in the shadows near the
theatre's exit.  As people began to leave, they would see the amazing
actress, approach her and, unable to vocalize their feelings, touch her
hand before hurrying out the door, their eyes brimming with tears.  Her
performance is beyond incredible and, amazingly, The War Zone is her
first acting gig.  Ditto for Cunliffe, in a portrayal of a young teen at
an age when he should be discovering his own sexuality, but instead
finds a nightmare beyond words.  Roth explained that he cast these roles
with the intention of using unknowns.  In addition to the fine acting
and direction, cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (The Winter Guest) helps
to apply a bleak, cold feel to the film.  Like it wouldn't have been
anyway.
1:38 - Not rated but includes nudity, strong sexual content including
rape and incest, adult language and violence

Review for Himalaya - l'enfance d'un chef (1999)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Himalaya sounds a lot like something you'd find at your local IMAX theatre.
For starters, it's full of stunning panoramic shots that can't help but
overshadow an inferior plot.  The film tells the story of a young boy (kids
are an IMAX staple) on track to become Chief of his Nepalese village, which
means audiences will be treated to magnificent views of snow-covered
mountains that practically dare people to cross them.
Anyone familiar with Iranian cinema will notice similarities between
Himalaya (an awfully fun word to type) and that country's recent critical
hit A Time For Drunken Horses - this could have been called A Time For
Teetotaling Yaks.  Both films deal with impoverished villages whose survival
depends on caravans that wind through the dangerous mountains. While Horses'
characters smuggled contraband into Iraq, the people in Himalaya haul packs
of salt hundreds of miles away to exchange for grain that will keep their
tribes eating throughout the harsh winter months.
As Himalaya opens, the salt caravan has just returned to town.  One might
think this would be a time for celebration, like when the fishing boats came
home to Gloucester at the beginning of The Perfect Storm, but this time the
convoy has returned with the remains of their Chief in a burlap sack.
Lhakpa, we are told by his close friend and caravaneer Karma (Gurgon Kyap),
died trying to follow a risky path.  Lhakpa's elderly father Tinle (Thilen
Lhondup) doesn't believe Karma, suspecting he may have done something
devious to assume his place in the community.
A power struggle ensues, with most of the villagers in favor of Karma taking
over, but Tinle thinks the gig should remain in his lineage (he was the
Chief before Lhakpa).  The only problem is that the family's next male heir
is little boy named Tsering (Karma Wangel), who isn't nearly ready to man a
salt caravan through mountains big enough to make Lance Armstrong burst into
tears.
But that's not enough to stop crotchety old Tinle, who comes off as a
taller, Far East version of Cotton from King of the Hill (he even has a few
"I've been blah-blah-blah-ing since before you were born!" lines).  Tinle
hauls his other son, Norbou (Karma Tensing), out of the monastery he was
forced into as a boy and starts his own damn caravan (another fun word to
type) with a few of the village elders, his grandson and his widowed
daughter-in-law (Lhakpa Tsamchoe).
What follows is probably the closest thing we'll ever see to a Nepalese
road-trip flick, as the two separate caravans (Karma's and Tinle's) embark
on the salt-for-grain journey. There's one dicey scene where Tinle's crew
tries to cross a very narrow mountain path, but filming it was probably a
hundred times more precarious than it appeared on screen.  Not only are
there no stunt doubles in Himalaya, there aren't any professional actors,
either.  The faces weathered by the elements that you see on the screen
really have to lug salt through the mountains to exchange for grain.
Some folks might complain about the lack of character development, but since
Himalaya is populated by non-actors, beefing up their parts isn't going to
be a positive thing.  It'd be one thing if the picture starred Brad, Julia,
Haley Joel and Robert (as in Redford - his craggy puss would have been
perfect), but the story here is kept pleasantly simple.  It's almost a
fable - old customs (like using astronomy to tell you when to start the
caravan) butting heads with modern thinking (like using medicine over
hocus-pocus stuff).  But not too modern, mind you.  The only major problem
with Himalaya is that there isn't supposed to be a clear-cut protagonist,
yet it's hard not to root for Karma over the gratingly unpleasant Tinle.
Himalaya, which won César Awards for its score (Bruno Coulais) and
cinematography (Eric Guichard), was Nepal's first-ever submission to the
Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film category in 1999 (it was actually
nominated, too, but lost to Spain's All About My Mother).  The picture was
directed by Eric Valli, a National Geographic photographer who, for the last
20 years, has lived in the same remote Dolpo region of Nepal in which
Himalaya is set (he was also a unit director for Seven Years in Tibet).  The
uncomplicated screenplay took four writers to tackle (one of whom,
ironically, was a scribe on fellow 1999 Foreign Film nominee East-West).

Review for Shrek (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
It took three years and over 275 artists and computer geeks to bring Shrek
to the big screen, and the PDI/DreamWorks (the peeps who made Antz) film
kicks off with a crappy "modern rock" song that was popular, oh, about three
years ago ("Hey now/you're an all-star/pull your pants down/you lame-o").
It's hardly an auspicious start for something that, on the surface, looked
like it could have been one of the bright spots of the summer release
schedule.
Luckily, things - including the music (there's a new Eels song and a Bob
Dylan cover) - get much better.  Shrek, based on William Steig's book, is a
quality production, from its appearance to its voice work and even to its
laughably predictable story.  It's the first feature-length film to showcase
computer-animated human characters, and, while it seemed creepy and
distracting in the trailer, it's really incredibly detailed and enjoyable.
The film's main character is the titular Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers, Austin
Powers), a big green ogre who loves his privacy and lives in an isolated
swamp far away from just about everybody.  With both the accent and rotten
teeth of a Scotsman, Shrek is often besieged by gangs of torch and
pitchfork-wielding men intent on either driving him from his home or,
possibly, from the face of the Earth (it's a kids' movie - their motives
remain unclear). But Shrek can usually scare them off simply by raising his
voice a bit.  He is, after all, an ogre.
Shrek's dream lifestyle comes to a screeching halt one day when his swamp
becomes overrun with fairytale characters that have been banished from a
nearby kingdom.  Everyone from the Little Gingerbread Man to the Three
Little Pigs have nowhere else to go after being given the boot by the
diabolically short Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow, 3rd Rock From the Sun), a
man intent on creating the perfect empire over which he shall rule like a
king.  To do so, Farquaad is told, he needs to marry a princess, and we see
him as a contestant in a very amusing animated version of The Dating Game.
Farquaad settles on Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz, Charlie's Angels), who is,
like every decent princess should be, locked away in a dragon-guarded tower
as she eagerly awaits her first kiss.  Because Farquaad has Short Man's
Syndrome, he has decided it would be better to get someone else to rescue
the princess and bring her to him.  Enter Shrek, who is willing to do just
about anything in exchange for the removal of Pinocchio and Goldilocks from
his piece of land.
Shrek, along with the wisecracking donkey (Eddie Murphy, Nutty Professor II)
he reluctantly befriends, sets off to slay the dragon and rescue the
princess, who, of course, turns out to be the foxiest animated babe since
Lara Croft.  It comes as no surprise that Shrek and Fiona fall in love, but
the princess' dark secret is a nice touch, helping kids learn that whole
moral about books and covers.
The film gives nods to everything from Babe to The Matrix (the latter is
getting kind of boring, but the Shrek folks get some slack because this film
took so long to make).  Shrek and company even run into a spoof of
Disneyland, one of two jabs at producer Jeffrey Katzenberg's former employer
(the other, apparently, is that Farquaad looks like Disney's Michael
Eisner - the ultimate inside joke as the average viewer has no idea who he
is, let alone what he looks like).
Myers is a pleasure to listen to, as his Shrek is essentially a toned-down
version of Austin Powers' Fat Bastard (his accent was thicker, but test
audiences didn't care for it).  There was also some tweaking with Diaz's
character, but more for her appearance than her voice.  The original
versions of her Fiona looked too realistic, and they, too, were revamped for
the benefit of the audience.  One thing that wasn't kicked down a notch is
Murphy's Donkey, who plays a brasher version of his Mushu from Disney's
Mulan and steals just about every scene.
Shrek is full of jokes about farting, earwax, bad breath and body odor, and
I'll bet you my right arm that the same critics who have blasted every film
released in 2001 for containing the same kind of humor will be raving about
how good Shrek is and how it's perfect entertainment for the entire family.
It is, but cut Freddy Got Fingered and Tomcats some slack, will you?

Review for Boiler Room (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Welcome to J.T. Marlin, a Long Island stock brokerage that guarantees
recruits that they will become millionaires within three years.
Although J.T. Marlin is over an hour away from the hustle and bustle of
Wall Street, their parking lot is full of expensive, new cars, driven by
employees in expensive, new suits.  The senior executives are
twenty-seven and they know Wall Street by heart.
The allure of the job is certainly understandable  get rich and bond
with guys that are just like you.  But for Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi,
The Other Sister), it's also a chance to finally gain the one thing he's
never had:  His father's respect.  All he needs to do is work his ass
off and follow J.T. Marlin's few rules.  The first is `ABC,' or `Always
Be Closing,' an acronym lifted from David Mamet's amazing Glengarry Glen
Ross, a similar film with similar subject matter.
Instead of Alec Baldwin spouting these mottos, Boiler Room uses Ben
Affleck (Dogma) as its pitchman.  He plays Jim Young, a senior manager
at the firm in charge of firing up the new recruits (done here in three
hysterical scenes).  In addition to `ABC,' Jim also teaches the trainees
not to `Pitch the Bitch' (sell to women) and to always `Act As If'
(insert whatever phrase you'd please  like `You Own the Company').
Of course, the one rule that the recruits don't learn is that if it
seems to good to be true, it usually is.  J.T. Marlin sells worthless
stock in phony businesses to whomever they can get on the phone.  Their
tactics are aggressive, manipulative and illegal, but everyone is so
busy counting the piles of money that nobody seems to care that they're
bilking honest people out of their life savings.
Also serving as the film's narrator, we learn that Seth is different.
He doesn't care about the money  his parents are loaded, his dad (Ron
Rifkin, The Negotiator) a federal judge.  A college dropout that ran a
highly profitable casino out of his Queens apartment, Seth takes the job
on the advice of childhood friend and J.T. Marlin manager Greg Weinstein
(Nicky Katt, The Limey), seeing the new profession as a way to get back
in his father's good graces.  He spends three months as a trainee,
passes the Section 7 exam and becomes one of the firm's better
salesmen.  But Seth knows a good scam when he sees one and wisely
proceeds with caution.
Boiler Room is a very impressive film debut from Ben Younger, who wrote
and directed the film after spending over a year interviewing real-life
brokers.  In a world where it seems everyone is a day-trader and
Microsoft secretaries make as much money as professional athletes, the
subject matter is hip and topical.  He shows the men of Generation X as
power-hungry deviants that will do anything to get ahead in life,
including ridiculing others for their race, creed, color and sexual
preference.  They mix in brokerage lingo with their insults, but
Younger's script deftly explains the entire process from cold sales call
to closing.
The film also looks amazingly accomplished for a first-timer.  Younger,
cinematographer Enrique Chediak (The Faculty) and editor Chris Peppe
(Suicide Kings) do a great job at capturing both the look of the giant,
action-packed sales floor of J.T. Marlin, as well as the genuinely
gut-wrenching emotion portrayed by Ribisi.  The acting is great, and its
hip-hop heavy score was produced by The Angel.  The only complaint is
the presence of the tiresome romantic subplot involving a black
secretary (played by Nia Long, The Best Man), which seems thrown in just
to offset the objectionable racial material in the film.

Review for Election (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Matthew Broderick's character in the new Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth)
comedy could be an adult version of Ferris Bueller.  Sure, we don't want
to think about the carefree Ferris turning into Election's popular high
school teacher Jim McAllister, but you almost can't help it.
McAllister is a mélange of every educator you've ever had  dingy
short-sleeved oxford shirt, bad tie, brown shoes, tiny Ford Festiva, and
a genuine love of teaching.  Despite winning George Washington Carver
High's `Teacher of the Year' a record three times in his twelve-year
tenure, McAllister still has one major Achilles heel that ultimately
leads to his unraveling  a peppy junior named Tracy Flick.
Flick (Reese Witherspoon, Cruel Intentions) is running unopposed for the
student body President, and her vivacity and eagerness are just the
qualities that would have made her an easy target for people like
Ferris.  She in the top seven percent of her class, dresses like she's
still trapped in Pleasantville, walks like she has a bulky object
crammed up her backside, and perfectly pronounces every word that leaves
her tightly pursed lips.  And don't get me started on her hair, which,
at one point, resembles demonic horns.
Things take an odd turn at Carver when McAllister convinces well-liked
school quarterback Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against the
seemingly unstoppable Flick juggernaut.  When the dust settles, viewers
will have been treated to tastes of pornography, marital infidelity,
lesbianism, sex with minors, election tampering, and a very disturbing
scene where McAllister cleanses his genitals in the bathtub of a cheap
hotel.  Not your typical MTV Production, eh?
Payne's direction (he also co-wrote the script, based on the Tom
Perrotta novel) is reminiscent of both Wes Anderson's superior Rushmore
and either of Betty Thomas' biopics, The Late Show and Private Parts.
Repeatedly using montage clips, Payne also bathes his actors in a sea of
horrible fluorescent lighting, exposing every physical flaw.
Although the acting is first-rate, Witherspoon's Flick really stands
out.  Her unknowingly fiendish role will likely be remembered among the
more evil roles in film history, along with Oddjob, Keyser Soze, Robert
Patrick in Terminator 2 and that Russian guy from the fourth Rocky
film.  Or was it the third?  Well, you get my point.  (1:43  R for

Title
Review for Ciénaga, La (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Lucrecia Martel's directorial debut, a Berlin Film Festival winner, is a
terrific picture, even though it's pretty difficult to watch.  La Cienaga,
which translates into The Swamp, is about a large family in northwest
Argentina who gets together when their matriarch is injured.  There isn't
much introduction to any of the film's 15 characters, which is somewhat
frustrating because a couple of them are damn hard to tell apart.  Instead,
Martel slowly lets things unfold without much explanation.  It's kind of
like going to your partner's parent's house on Christmas and not knowing who
anyone is or who's related to whom.
The most impressive scene in La Cienaga might be its first, which shows what
I will politely refer to as a zombie pool party.  The in-ground pool itself
is a thick, soupy mess and the corpses around it slouch in lounge chairs
like invertebrates.  When Mecha (Graciela Borges) arises and stumbles across
the concrete on her way to get a refill, she trips and lands on the wine
glasses she was carrying, resulting in some deep lacerations.  But none of
the zombies move, despite the coppery smell of blood in the air (that's
because zombies eat brains, stupid!).  Martel's camera work here is
fantastic, using a shaky handheld to make Mecha's dizzying fall something to
remember.
Soon enough, there's a flurry of activity, prompted by Mecha's children and
servants.  Mecha is whisked away to a hospital in La Cienaga, a nearby city
where her cousin Tali (Mercedes Morán) and her family live.  When Tali
learns about Mecha's injuries, her kin heads to the family's decaying
country estate in La Mandragora.  These two branches of the family tree
haven't spent much time together in recent years and, like most family
get-togethers, things don't always go smoothly.
It's hard to even begin explaining the problems.  For starters, Mecha is a
fall-down drunk, and now that she's bedridden, she's afraid she'll rot away
like her mother did.  Mecha's husband Gregorio (Martín Adjemián) is just as
much of a lush, causing their 15-year-old daughter Momi (Sofia Bertolotto)
to develop a disturbingly close relationship with one of the estate's
servants, Isabel (Andrea López).  Young Joaquín (Diego Baenas) spends the
entire film hunting in the mountainous woods that surround La Mandragora,
even though he's already missing an eye (no word on whether he, like so many
mothers have warned, shot his own eye out).
Tali's family isn't much better off.  She wants to go to Bolivia to do
back-to-school shopping, but her husband Rafael (Daniel Valenzuela) refuses
to let her go alone.  Little Luciano (Sebastián Montagna) has a huge gash on
his leg, a stray tooth growing out of the roof of his mouth and an intense
fear of African rats after hearing an urban legend.  Beautiful Agustina
(Noelia Bravo Herrera) doesn't seem to have much wrong with her, but she
could be Momi's twin, which just makes everything confusing.  There are more
kids and more serious problems, but I think you get the idea.
La Cienaga is set in February, right before Carnival (which, according to
Tali, brings nothing but problems), a hot, sticky time of the year for the
southern hemisphere.  The close, cramped quarters do nothing but make
everybody lazy and pissed off.  Martel's fly-on-the-wall style might remind
some of the Dogme 95 aesthetic, and it's a real shock to learn most of La
Cienaga's acting talent had no acting experience (especially the kids, who
were just residents of the villages where Martel filmed).  It's a gritty,
accomplished work that will ultimately pay off if you can sort out the
characters and their stories.

Review for Lost & Found (1999/I)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
I can't decide which is more sick  seeing Hollywood cast my
grandfather's classmates as the romantic interests of girls that are
still waiting for their adult teeth, or the oddball casting of Dungeons
and Dragons club president David Spade and the ravishing French beauty
Sophie Marceau.  Or is it more twisted to make Spade, in his biggest
theatrical release since the death of Chris Farley, have a big, fat,
loser guy (Artie Lange, MAD TV) to hang around with?
Golden Globe nominee Spade (Just Shoot Me) stars as Dylan Ramsey, the
owner of a struggling Italian eatery who falls for the new tenant in his
L.A. apartment building.  She is Lila Dubois (Marceau, Braveheart), a
transplanted Parisian cellist who fled her country in an attempt to
ditch her smarmy ex-boyfriend Rene (Patrick Bruel).  Lila also has a
yapping little dog with a penchant of jumping out the window and hanging
out by the pier.
Dylan sees the dog as an attempt to get close to Lila, so he kidnaps the
dog while pretending to help her look for it.  As she grows fonder and
fonder of her seemingly kindhearted neighbor, he is horrified to find
out that the dog has apparently eaten the engagement ring of Dylan's
best friend and restaurant chef.  And, yes, there is a great scene where
he has to sift through the dog poop.
Spade, who co-wrote the film with first-timers James B. Cook and Marc
Meeks, is a slightly more sensitive version of his television character,
though his lines don't have the same gratifying sarcastic bite.  And he
is a little more successful than Just Shoot Me's Finch, as he is able to
woo both strippers (like Dylan's previous girlfriend) and women of
Marceau's caliber alike.  Conversely, Marceau really makes you
appreciate Emily Watson's cello-playing in Hilary & Jackie, although
when Sophie wraps her legs around the instrument, you don't so much care
about her acting chops.
Directed by Jeff Pollack (Booty Call), Lost & Found features a
hysterical cameo from hysterical cameo messiah Jon Lovitz, who plays a
dog whisperer (a la the Robert Redford film of a similar name).  There
are also a few great scenes involving some poker-playing grannies -
Estelle Harris (Seinfeld), Rose Marie (The Dick Van Dyke Show) and Marla
Gibbs (The Jeffersons).  For what it is, Lost & Found is not
disappointing and good for more than a few laughs.
1:40  PG-13 for adult language, sex jokes and a little dog violence,
but nothing like There's Something About Mary

Title
Review for Tea with Mussolini (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
`Close the door and take off your shirt.'  It would be hard to fathom
Cher not saying that to a much younger man in any of her starring roles,
but in Tea with Mussolini, the single-monickered wonder actually doesn't
have a sexual motive.  Here, she plays Elsa, a snobby, art-collecting
American Jew (disguised, of course, as Morticia Adams) who finds herself
trapped in 1940's Florence as Mussolini quickly leads the country to the
brink of war with England and France.
The kid losing his shirt is Luca (Baird Wallace, in his film debut), a
teenage orphan that is, at first, an unwitting pawn in Elsa's attempt to
smuggle desperate Jews out of Italy - she tapes passports to the boy's
chest and tells him where to deliver them.  And with the look and feel
of the film, you almost expect Luca to bump into and run off with
Dominique Sanda's Micol from The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, the 1970
Best Foreign Film winner that shares an obviously similar subject with
Mussolini.  Or maybe see Roberto Benigni's Guido (from fellow Oscar
winner Life is Beautiful) crashing his bicycle into something.  Or maybe
even that dead guy from Il Postino.
Elsa's tea-drinking clique (nicknamed The Scorpioni) is an odd one.
There is fellow American Georgie (Lily Tomlin, Krippendorf's Tribe), a
lesbian archaeologist.  There's Mary (Joan Plowright, Dennis the
Menace), the warm, grandmotherly woman that raised the orphan Luca, who
is actually the son of the man she works for.  There's fragile and dippy
Arabella (Judi Dench, Elizabeth), a dog-rescuing artist.  But best of
all, there's Hester (Maggie Smith, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit) the
blissfully ignorant widow of the former British ambassador to Italy.
She blindly trusts Mussolini's personal assurances that no harm will
come to her and her friends.  Come on - who would trust somebody that
looks like Mussolini?  He looked like Brando in The Island of Dr.
Moreau, for God's sake.
Among the rich vocal tones of Dench, Smith and Plowright, Cher's accent
is, at first, like a slap in the face.  Her character comes off as an
arrogant loudmouth, and it's no surprise that Hester finds her
obnoxious, whorish and a disgrace.  But truth be told, Cher is actually
fantastic.  She looks decades younger than her actual age (so would you
if you shot poison into your face to stop the aging process) and
invigorates every scene her Elsa is in.  But even though Cher gets top
billing (the filmmakers would have you believe that it's because stars
are listed in alphabetical order), her thunder is repeatedly stolen by
Smith's tight-laced Hester.  Her character is oblivious enough to not
notice the things happening around her, but also strong enough to berate
her captors into both knocking before they enter a lady's room and
saying goodnight when they leave one.
Directed by Franco Zeffirelli (Jane Eyre), Mussolini was written by
British novelist/playwright John Mortimer and is actually based loosely
on Zeffirelli's own life (as told in his autobiography).  While not as
heavy-handed as Finzi-Continis or as light as Life is Beautiful, it
successfully blends elements of both, and the result is one terrific
film.  (1:56 - PG for adult language, brief nudity and some mild
violence)

Title
Review for Bedazzled (2000)
If I didn't know it was a remake, I'd swear Bedazzled was modeled after
two of the annual `Treehouse of Horror' episodes of The Simpsons.  One
involved Homer getting four wishes from a magical Moroccan monkey's paw,
and in the other Homer sold his soul to the Devil Flanders for a donut.
But Bedazzled IS a remake.  The original, a 1967 film written by and
starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, was about a hapless fry cook that
unsuccessfully tried to off himself because he couldn't work up the
nerve to ask out a pretty waitress.  In pops the Devil, who offers the
loser seven wishes, each of which revolve around the seven deadly sins
(Raquel Welch played Lust).
The new version isn't quite as dark.  The main character isn't suicidal,
and the deadly sins are completely omitted.  But the biggest change to
the original is the fact that the Devil is played by a scantily clad
supermodel.  The result is a light, entertaining film that is probably
the best family comedy to be released in several months.
After the clever opening credits, where anonymous citizens are literally
labeled `bad tipper,' `horny,' and `cheats on taxes,' we are introduced
to Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser, The Mummy), a customer service rep
for a San Francisco-based computer company called Synedyne.  Elliot is
essentially a grown-up version of Jason Biggs' Paul Tannek from Loser.
He's despised by the co-workers he thinks are his friends and longs to
be with a Synedyne employee named Allison (Frances O'Connor, Mansfield
Park), who is way out of Elliot's league.
One evening in a bar, Elliot's `friends' talk him into approaching
Allison, who, of course, blows him off.  Exasperated, Elliot says that
he would do anything to win her affection, at which point the Devil
(Estee Lauder scab Elizabeth Hurley, Edtv) appears and offers to make
all of his dreams come true via seven wishes.  Elliot is skeptical, but
he eventually begins making wishes, all of which turn out horribly
wrong.
Admirably, the trailers for Bedazzled show only Elliot's first wish, in
which he requests to be rich and powerful, but becomes a Columbian drug
lord.  In each of the wish sequences, which incorporate Elliot's
co-workers Wizard of Oz-style, Fraser gets to play a completely
different character, some of which don't resemble the actor at all.  His
performance is just as good as Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor
films.
The beauty of the film becomes watching Elliot wish for the wrong thing
over and over again, while everybody knows that he should have asked to
be a sexually ambiguous magician, because that's the only sure-fire way
to land hot babes.  Elliot never even figures out how to drag out his
wishes to ask for more things, unlike Homer, who covered himself by
being very specific.
`I wish for a turkey sandwich on rye bread with lettuce and mustard.
And  AND I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a
turkey myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises  you got it?'
Bedazzled was directed by Harold Ramis (Analyze This), who co-adapted
the script with Larry Gelbart (Tootsie) and Peter Tolan (Analyze This).
The film's ending is very flat and doesn't show enough of Elliot's
character growth.  Hurley is at her least annoying and her least dressed
(the former probably has some effect on the latter).  O'Connor is good,
but looks disturbingly like Mariah Carey in several scenes.
1:32  PG-13 for sex-related humor, adult language and some drug content

Title
Review for Proof of Life (2000)
Proof of Life is the second of three movies slated for release at the
end of 2000 containing actors that were or are in real-life
relationships.  First, there was the `are they or aren't they' duo of
Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow in the surprisingly good Bounce. Later
this year, viewers will be treated to Traffic, which, in addition to
being one of the year's best films, features newlyweds Michael Douglas
and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Sandwiched in the middle of these two strong
films is the decidedly lackluster Life, which boasts the presence of
current Hollywood cuddle-bunnies Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe.
Life opens in Russia, with a 10-minute, hyper-edited segment that
introduces Terry Thorne (Crowe, Gladiator) as the Kidnap and Ransom
Specialist (or `K&R,' for the hostage-savvy) for London-based Luthan
Risk International.  Basically, he's a negotiator who excels at bringing
home people who have been kidnapped - assuming, of course, that the
victim is employed by a business that is insured by Luthan.
Meanwhile, in Tecala, South America (it's Ecuador, although the film
never mentions the name of the country), a young American couple is
settling in after bouncing around between various other third-world
countries.  Peter Bowman (David Morse, Dancer in the Dark) is building a
dam to save villages from being flooded, and his company is being taken
over by a large oil company planning to build a pipeline around the
dam.  His wife, Alice (Meg Ryan, Hanging Up), is a chain-smoking flower
child whose hair is too perfect to even pick out Ecuador on a map, let
alone live there.
Long story short, Peter is kidnapped by rebel fighters, and Luthan's K&R
man Terry is called in to save the day.  But Luthan finds out that
Peter's company dropped their kidnapping insurance during their
corporate transition, and Terry is forced to give up the job, despite
his interest in both the assignment and Alice's cute button nose.  But
will the allure of the case and the nose be too much for Terry to
ignore?  What do you think, stupid?
The film follows two stories  one featuring Peter and his painful
ordeal (in which he actually turns into Tom Hanks in Cast Away), while
the other concentrates on Alice and Terry's attempts to rescue Peter
from the crazy rebels.  The trouble is that neither of the stories is
interesting enough to carry the film, although the former is, by far,
the more interesting of the two.
Many viewers will be watching Proof closely to see if they can pinpoint
the instant Crowe and Ryan fell in love.  I'll answer that question for
those people right now  you can't.  Not only is the chemistry missing
between the two actors, there isn't any between the two characters,
either.  When Terry and Alice finally kiss, it seems as forced as the
laughter at a taping of Hollywood Squares.  I almost forgot there was
supposed to be a romantic angle to the story, and wondered afterward if
it was added at the last minute.  The film's trailer and poster make it
seem like Terry and Alice will be doing a lot of running around together
to find Peter, but it never materializes.
The horribly paced Proof was directed by Taylor Hackford (The Devil's
Advocate) and was nicely lensed by Slavomir Idziak (Gattaca).  The
script was written by Advocate's Tony Gilroy, who based the story on two
different sources  a Vanity Fair article about K&R men, and an
autobiography from the survivor of a Columbian guerilla kidnapping. This
would explain the two separate stories, but it doesn't explain why they
were both such a bore.  Proof is as dull, routine and as eventful as a
trip to the grocery store.  It's a taut thriller that is neither taut,
nor thrilling, and it's unnecessarily long, too.

Review for Tailor of Panama, The (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Based on John LeCarré's popular novel, The Tailor of Panama is a clumsy spy
flick that fits like a bad suit.  It's a bit more sophisticated than a James
Bond film but without the gadgets or the pyrotechnics, which is kind of like
ordering a chicken sandwich with mayo and asking the waiter to hold the
chicken. Tailor is receiving mostly glowing marks from critics around the
country, but I have a suspicion that their praise has more to do with the
crappy teen flicks that have populated 2001's calendar than the film's
actual merit.
Pierce Brosnan (The World is Not Enough) stars as Osnard, an overly
ambitious, womanizing British spy who has been relegated to Panama after
dipping his wick where it didn't belong.  His assignment is to befriend a
person of power in Panama City in an attempt to learn whether the government
plans on selling the Panama Canal to a country that the U.S. and Britain
aren't particularly fond of (the opening credits feature a weird history
lesson on the Canal).  Osnard is given a list of about 200 Brits living in
Panama and, after quickly scanning the roster of names and occupations,
immediately chooses a tailor over the dozens of lawyers, bankers and
politicians you'd think would be a better source of information.
But ol' Osnard is a crafty little devil.  He figures the revered tailor to
be the perfect mole, as he has regular contact with the country's movers and
shakers.  Osnard also learns that Harry (Geoffrey Rush, Quills) has the
added benefit of being an ex-con with a secret past who is in hock up to his
eyeballs, as well as a wife (Jamie Lee Curtis, Drowning Mona) who is an
assistant to a high-ranking government employee.  Osnard feeds Harry thick
envelopes full of cash, and Harry gives Osnard information about the sale of
the Canal.  The catch is that he's making it all up.  A tailor weaving a
fake story - get it?  It's funny.
There are supposed to be a bunch of twists and turns in Tailor, but nothing
too surprising happens as the actors go through the same motions we've seen
over and over again in films of this genre.  Also detracting from potential
entertainment is the fact that there isn't anyone to root for in the film.
One character says Panama is "Casablanca without the heroes," an obvious
poke at the picture's lack of a protagonist, which illustrates Tailor's
other big problem - its tongue is planted too far in its cheek and it can't
decide whether it wants to be serious or silly.  One thing is for sure - it
ain't either.
Brosnan seems like he's having fun playing Bond's alter ego here.  His
Osnard is a sleazy pussyhound who even gets a sexy dance scene just like the
one in The Thomas Crown Affair.  Rush, who is always better when he's cast
in subtle roles like this (as opposed to, say, Quills, Mystery Men or House
on Haunted Hill), does well as the harried, slightly delusional suitmaker
who converses with his dead uncle (playwright Harold Pinter) during
particularly stressful moments.  Curtis basically reprises her
oh-my-God-my-husband-is-a-spy! role from True Lies (although, at times, it's
hard to tell if she or Rush has more testosterone pumping through them).
Brendan Gleeson (M:I-2) is nearly unrecognizable as a bearded drunk who may
or may not be running a group in opposition of the sale of the Canal that
may or may not be taking place.  And look out for little Daniel Radcliffe;
he plays Harry's son here, but in a few months, he'll be portraying Harry
himself - Harry Potter, that is.
Tailor is mostly unsatisfying, especially since it's John Boorman's
follow-up to the brilliant film The General (which also starred Gleeson).
Boorman adapted the novel with help from Le Carré and Bridget Jones's Diary'
s scribe Andrew Davies.  The film is certainly pretty enough, with lovely
photography from Philippe Rousselot (Remember the Titans) and unobtrusive
editing from Boorman regular Ron Davis.  If nothing else, Tailor helps
perpetuate the myth that all countries south of Texas have daily,
street-blocking parades complete with giant religious icons (it's always the
Day of the Dead in Central America, right?).

Review for Shanghai Noon (2000)
After Wild Wild West, viewers might be understandably apprehensive about
a summer film set in the Old West, the mere sight of a tumbleweed
striking fear into the hearts of moviegoers round the world.  But
Shanghai Noon will change the way you feel about the recently maligned
genre.  Noon not only proves that Jackie Chan's mainstream hit Rush Hour
was no fluke, but also looks likely to establish co-star Owen Wilson as
one of Hollywood's most likeable comedic stars.
Noon's story is so simplistic that it could have been taken from a video
game (in fact, some games are much more complicated).  A Chinese
Imperial Guard named Chon Wang (Chan, Rush Hour) is sent to the great
western frontier of the United States to rescue a beautiful princess
(Lucy Liu, Ally McBeal) from working in a railroad slave camp.  Along
the way, he teams up with a struggling outlaw named Roy O'Bannon
(Wilson, The Haunting), who is being chased by a Machiavellian U.S.
Marshal.
As in any self-respecting buddy film, Chon Wang (pronounced like `John
Wayne') and Roy don't become friends right off the bat.  As Noon opens,
Roy and his gang of inept cowboys are trying to rob the train that is
carrying Chon Wang and his fellow Imperial Guardsmen.  It doesn't go
down as planned, and Roy ends up buried up to his neck in the desert,
while Chon Wang is separated from his group, which is now light
approximately one person.
What transpires from that point is a series of fantastic fighting scenes
that display Chan's physical prowess, plus enough side-splitting
one-liners from Wilson to keep even those that abhor martial arts glued
to the screen.  There are at least six great fight sequences that, quite
frankly, blow away the ones in the highly touted Mission: Impossible 2.
And, like many of Chan's other high-kicking extravaganzas, Noon offers
outtakes of flubbed lines and stunts gone bad (hey, that sounds like one
of Fox's May `sweeps' specials!).
As politically incorrect as any film that I can remember (fun is poked
at the Chinese, Native Americans, Jews and the irreverent White Man),
Noon also boasts a very funny scene where Roy trains Chon Wang to become
a cowboy (to Kid Rock's song of the same name), as well as a very
bizarre sequence involving a whorehouse, bubble bath and a Chinese
drinking game, the latter of which I was hoping would result in some
intoxicated fighting (a la Chan's wickedly cool Drunken Master 2), but
unfortunately that dream was never realized.
Noon is the directorial debut of Tom Dey and was written by Miles Millar
and Alfred Gough of Lethal Weapon 4 fame.  Dey's direction and the
co-written script skillfully blend the important elements of action and
comedy, but Wilson's deadpan drawl makes the whole picture worthwhile.
I couldn't help but wonder how much creative input he had in his own
lines, which seem as well written as either of the finely crafted
screenplays the actor has penned (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore).
PG-13 for action violence, some drug humor and mild adult language

Title
Review for Mercury Rising (1998)
It must have something to do with the title.  First, they gave us Deep
Rising, and now they force Mercury Rising on the unsuspecting public.
Mercury boasts a bigger and better cast, but is still just as
ridiculous.  And I'm not even sure that ridiculous is strong enough of a
word.
Is it just me or is Bruce Willis just playing the same role over and
over again?  Don't get me wrong, I like Bruce.  I mean, he was in three
of the best films in the past few years (Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys and
The Fifth Element), but is still mostly typecast as the downtrodden
recently fired/demoted law enforcement type guy.  In Mercury Rising, he
is Art Jeffries, an undercover FBI agent busted down to an office grunt
after taking the fall for a Ruby Ridge-type militia standoff.
One of his assignments is to look for a missing kid named Simon (Miko
Hughes, Spawn), who has somehow cracked the government super-code using
his amazing and seemingly limitless powers of autism.  Now, call me
crazy, but how often is this kid going to run across scrambled
government code involving top secret military plans.  It's not like
they're putting this stuff on the back of Cheerios boxes.  But, rather
than ignoring the problem, the powers that be (represented by Alec
Baldwin, The Shadow) decide that it would be a better world if Simon
would just die.
And what's the deal with Alec Baldwin's career?  When was the last time
he was in a profitable or well reviewed film?  I can't remember either.
He is arguably the least talented of all the Baldwin Boys (and is
approaching Daniel for the largest), but yet somehow remains on the
`A'-list of Hollywood leading men.  Of course, I might be saying all of
this because I'm jealous of the fact that he probably "loved" Kim
Bay-Sing-Er with her own Academy Award.  `Just relax, Kim.  This is an
Oscar tradition.  No, I'm not making it up'.
You can probably figure out the rest of the moronic story (from the
writers of For Love or Money) on your own.  There's lots of gunplay and
fighting and punching and yelling.  There's the token girl thrown in for
no reason (Kim Dickens, Zero Effect).  The only characters that I even
came close to liking were the two geeky computer experts that work for
Baldwin.  But, even they couldn't hold my attention, which was busy
thinking of the most poetic way to kill each character.  I also wondered
if the film would be any better if they had cast the wives of the male
leads instead.

Title
Review for Rules of Engagement (2000)
I always get directors William Friedkin (The Exorcist) and John
Frankenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate) mixed up.  They were both at
the top of their game a few decades ago and spent most of the  90s
making first-rate but widely ignored television movies like 12 Angry Men
and George Wallace.  Friedkin helmed The French Connection and
Frankenheimer directed its sequel.  And six weeks after Frankenheimer's
mildly entertaining, big-budget bust Reindeer Games opened, Friedkin's
latest feature film hits the big screen.  And darned if Rules of
Engagement isn't a mildly entertaining, big-budget bust as well.
Rules begins in 1968 Viet Nam, where young Marines Hayes Hodges (Tommy
Lee Jones, Double Jeopardy) and Terry L. Childers (Samuel L. Jackson,
Deep Blue  Sea) slink through a booby-trapped jungle.  You may be
wondering how fifty-three-year-old Jones and fifty-one-year-old Jackson
were able to pull off young soldiers.  They don't  Jackson wears a
kerchief on his head, while Jones has a floppy hat pulled down over his
face and blood smeared over the giant cracks in it like crimson
spackle.  They could have dug up some younger look-a-likes.   Anyway,
Hodges takes one in the knee and Childers saves his life.  The scene is
filled with mud, water, bullets, red mist, gruesome wounds, and some
very Saving Private Ryan-esque camera work, editing and film speed.
Flash to 1996, where Hodges is retiring from the Corps and Childers has
just received orders to head up a special ops unit.  While he and his
men are aboard the U.S.S. Wake Island in the Indian Ocean, Childers gets
an assignment to rescue the U.S. Ambassador to Yemen (Ben Kingsley, What
Planet Are You From?) and his family from the embassy, which is
currently surrounded by hundreds of demonstrators that are growing more
and more violent.  Childers and his crew fly three choppers to the
embassy and rescue the Americans, despite drawing heavy fire from
snipers on the roofs of nearby buildings.
When several of his men are killed in action, Childers orders his troops
to open fire into the crowd of demonstrators, instead of just going
after the snipers.  Eighty-three die and over a hundred more are
seriously injured, including dozens of unarmed women and children.  The
worldwide public outcry in the aftermath of this shooting is too
deafening for the U.S. to ignore.  They need a scapegoat, immediately
labeling Childers as `a hotheaded miscalculation,' and subject the Major
to a court martial eight days later where he is charged with murder and
other assorted atrocities.
The film is really quite good through this point, at which Childers
hires Hodges to represent him, playing the `Gee, I did save your life'
card.  Rules then becomes a run-of-the-mill courtroom bore with one of
the most anti-climatic ending in recent memory.  Much of Childers' case
revolves around a missing videotape of the incident captured on an
embassy security camera that proves the demonstrators were firing on the
Marines, not just the snipers.  In real life, they would have determined
the origin of the gunfire from the holes in the front of the embassy,
but the promise of detailed forensic analysis doesn't usually bring 'em
out opening weekend.
There are a couple of bright spots in Rules, like some pretty nifty
shots shown through the eyes of the sniper during the embassy siege, and
a blistering, applause-inducing exchange on the stand between Childers
and prosecutor Major Mark Biggs (Guy Pearce, Ravenous), who sports a
wicked New Yawk accent (he's Australian).  There are no opening credits,
and the scenes set in Yemen (it's actually Morocco) look quite lovely.
Another interesting aspect to Rules is that there really aren't any bad
guys.  Biggs is just doing his job (he refuses to seek the death penalty
for Childers), and the National Security Advisor (Bruce Greenwood, Here
on Earth) and the Ambassador are only after Childers to protect the
interests of the country.
Rules was written by Stephen Gaghan (his first movie script), an
executive story editor on The Practice.  The film co-stars Anne Archer
(Clear & Present Danger), Blair Underwood (television's
soon-to-be-cancelled City of Angels), Philip Baker Hall (Magnolia) and
Nicky Katt (Boiler Room).

Review for World Is Not Enough, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The world is not enough indeed.  The latest James Bond flick falls as
flat as Tomorrow Never Dies, with decent action sequences and bad soap
opera acting.  Here, 007 (Pierce Brosnan, The Thomas Crown Affair) tries
to quell  get this  a terrorist with a nuclear warhead.  Yawn - now
there's something we haven't seen before.
The nineteenth film in the longest-running series in the history of
cinema kicks off with the familiar JB opening and music before settling
in Bilboa, Spain, where Bond is calmly dealing with a crooked Swiss
banker.  Of course, the situation comes to a head, and Bond is involved
with an impressive boat chase that not only runs through the streets of
London, but wraps up on a hot-air balloon before launching into the sexy
opening credits and new 007 song from Garbage.  Why do songs from Bond
films always sound the same?
Bond's initial assignment is to recover money stolen from a Sir Robert
King, which leads him to become involved with King's leggy daughter
Elektra (Sophie Marceau, Lost & Found).  Elektra is currently building a
huge oil pipeline in her native Azerbaijan, and Bond believes that her
life may be threatened by a devious terrorist named Renard (Robert
Carlyle, Plunkett & Macleane).  Renard, previously a target of MI6, has
a bullet lodged in his medulla oblongotta, which renders him unable to
feel pain.
As goofy as that sounds, Bond also gets involved with a buxom nuclear
physicist named Christmas Jones (Denise Richards, Drop Dead Gorgeous, in
a bit of awful casting).  But wait until the point in the movie where
they say that Elektra is only twenty-one.  If she is twenty-one, then
Dr. Jones must be around thirteen.  On the plus side  other than
getting to watch two attractive women try to act  there are two
fantastic one-liners about Christmas' name at the end of the film.  I
was getting nervous that the screenwriters dubbed her `Christmas' and
forgot to make fun of the name.  Jones is Bond's third lay of the film,
after Elektra and the MI6 doctor Molly Warmflesh, whom 007 poles in
order to regain his active duty status.  He probably just missed a
fourth in Il Postino's Maria Grazia Cucinotta, but she escaped his
sexual grasp in the film's opening.
The script is another example of a bad action film with too many
writers.  Sure, all the bad double-entendres and one-liners are still
there, but what was the deal with John Cleese (The Out-of-Towners)
playing the successor to Q (Desmond Llewelyn)?  You almost feel sorry
for people as talented as Robby Coltrane (Message in a Bottle), who
again plays Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky, and Dame Judi Dench, who
reprises her role as M in a healthy supporting role with more screen
time than her Oscar-winning turn as Queen Elizabeth in Shakespeare in
Love.  And as soon as you see Denise Richards in a white tank top, you
know that chilly water will figure into the film at some point.
Directed by Michael Apted (Extreme Measures), Enough was filmed by
Adrian Biddle (The Butcher Boy) on location in several European
countries.  The action scenes are barely enough to keep viewers
interested (aside from the early boat chase) and the final fight between
Bond and Renard is completely anti-climactic.  You would expect Bond in
a battle against a guy that can't feel pain to be a lot more
interesting.  But, then again, you would expect the whole film to be a
lot more interesting.  I've had Enough.
2:08 - PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence, some sexuality
and innuendo

Title
Review for Tomcats (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you're wondering how far Hollywood can push the envelope in this
post-There's-Something-About-Mary world, look no further than the first film
from former Disney chief Joe Roth's new Revolution Studios.  All of those
years producing animated family films must have warped old Joe's mind just a
little bit because Tomcats is one raunchy piece of work.  But it's also
pretty funny, assuming you can handle jokes about, among other things,
diseased testicles, bestiality and dominatrix grandmothers.  Tomcats knows
what its target audience is, goes all out to entertain it and, in that
respect, the film should be a success.
The film tries rather hard to alienate everyone who isn't in that target
demographic almost immediately.  Tomcats' opening credits feature a group of
cartoon cats ogling, chasing and pretty much humping a busty bunch of
animated felines while, as if that wasn't already a frat-boy wet dream, a
new Offspring song plays in the background.  You barely notice the cartoon
fade to reality, where, seven years ago, the first member of a group of
pussyhounds called "Tomcats" is about to be married.  One boner joke later,
the unmarried 'Cats decide to kick money into a pot which will be given to
the last group member to get hitched.
Flash to present-day Las Vegas, where fat 'Cat Steve (Horatio Sanz, Saturday
Night Live) is about to marry a girl named Tricia (Jaime Pressly, Poor White
Trash), leaving only Michael (Jerry O'Connell, Mission to Mars) and Kyle
(Jake Busey, Enemy of the State) as the group's remaining bachelors.  When
Michael blows $51,000 playing craps, his life is threatened by a mobster
(played by the truly unthreatening Bill Maher) who gives the lad just 30
days to come up with the money.
Hence the crux of Tomcats story - Michael hatches a plan to make Kyle fall
in love with one of his many former conquests, leaving him the winner of the
kitty, which, thanks to some wise investing, has grown to nearly $500,000
(the movie must have taken place before the NASDAQ "correction").  He
strikes a deal with Natalie (Shannon Elizabeth, Scary Movie), an undercover
vice cop and the only girl Kyle thinks he could ever even think of marrying,
and the two begin to spend time together on recon missions to prepare their
strategy.  In a completely surprising development, Michael and Natalie end
up falling for each other.  Wait, I meant unsurprising.
While the story isn't worth the bar napkin on which it was probably
scribbled, Tomcats is full of some clever and disgusting sight gags, and has
a few decent recurring jokes involving Michael having all his property
repossessed, a possibly gay 'Cat, and Steve trying to catch his wife in bed
with other women.  Parodies of M:I-2 and American Beauty fall pretty flat,
and Elizabeth, Tomcats' sparkplug, isn't even in the first 20 minutes, and
then disappears for 20 right before the denouement.  On the plus side, the
finale includes a very funny performance from Garry Marshall.  O'Connell, a
pretty likeable actor, does a capable job with what seems like a script even
Brendan Fraser would have rejected (he even plays a cartoonist, like
Fraser's Monkeybone character).
Tomcats was written and directed by See Spot Run scribe Gregory Poirier, who
isn't quite in the same league as the brothers Wayans or Farrelly.  But it
looks like everybody had a blast making it (especially judging from the
closing credit outtakes, which were the best non-Jackie Chan clips I've seen
in a while), and that makes it more fun to watch.

Title
Review for High Fidelity (2000)
I read High Fidelity several months ago in anticipation of its
theatrical release.  While the best-selling Gen X novel was certainly a
good read, I couldn't envision it being made into film - a film worth
watching, anyway.  There really isn't any action, and it's pretty light
on dialogue, instead focusing on the rambling thoughts of its
romantically challenged main character.  I figured there was two ways to
handle this in a screen adaptation:  Either use a voice-over to show
what the character is thinking, or replace what he's thinking with
additional dialogue and action not found in the novel.
Imagine my surprise at the first scene, where protagonist Rob Gordon is
delivering his lines right into the camera.  `Jesus,' I thought, `this
is going to be really annoying for two hours.'  But the narrations
actually grew on me.  Fidelity is lucky to have cast John Cusack (Being
John Malkovich), who may be the only actor in the world that could pull
off this role.  It probably didn't hurt that Cusack also produced and
co-wrote the film, tailoring it to meet both his splendid comic timing
and hangdog vulnerability (read: sad puppy-dog eyes).  Fidelity is an
unqualified hit and, although it's way too early to be saying this,
might be one of the better films you'll see all year.
Formerly a successful club DJ, Cusack's thirty-something Rob is now the
owner of a struggling record shop called Championship Vinyl, which is
located off the beaten path in downtown Chicago.  His two employees,
Barry and Dick (Jack Black, Enemy of the State; and Todd Louiso, Eight
Heads in a Duffel Bag), are the type of elitist record geeks that mock
you to your face if you can't tell the difference between an original
pressing and a reissue of an obscure Frank Zappa album.  But Rob
tolerates it because he's a bit of a musical snob, as well.  The three
busy themselves by compiling Top 5 lists that cover everything from the
all-time best death songs to the greatest Monday morning songs.  And be
warned  expect the more jug-headed critics to begin their reviews with
a `Top Five Reasons I Loved/Hated This Movie' list.
The film actually opens with Rob listing his desert-island, all-time,
top five most memorable split-ups, which are then shown in flashbacks
over the first third of the film.  He's recently been jilted by live-in
lover Laura (Iben Hjejle, Mifune  this is her first English-speaking
role) and begins to contact all of his old exes in an attempt to
pinpoint the exact cause of his inability to maintain relationships with
members of the opposite sex.  This quest, together with Rob's bizarre
need to reorganize his massive record collection in times of crisis,
make up the bulk of the film.
Aside from changing the setting of the film from London to Chicago,
Fidelity stays extremely faithful to its source.  Most of the lines are
taken verbatim from the book, which was written by Nick Hornby, who also
penned the soccer novel Fever Pitch, the film of which saw limited
release in 1999.  Ironically, the only thing British in the film (other
than some behind-the-camera talent) is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who plays
one of Rob's exes.  And everyone think she's Hispanic (she's Welsh).  My
only complaint is that `book' Rob would have hated most of the bands
that `movie' Rob was into.  He had a Bush poster on the wall of his
apartment, for God's sake.  I think that may even be illegal in England
- and if it isn't, it should be.
Perhaps the greatest thing about Fidelity is its uncanny ability to make
viewers point out old albums that they've owned during interior shots of
Rob's record store.  Oh, there goes that King Crimson bootleg that I
just bought on eBay for $50.  Hey, there's the first Hanoi Rocks record
that my sister crayoned all over.  I saw people literally pointing at
the screen in awe that these records existed anywhere but in their own
personal collections.
Also noteworthy is the wildly kinetic performance of Jack Black, who
steals every scene he's in.  This role could make him into the new
Philip Seymour Hoffman.  There is a surprise cameo (musical, of course)
and the closing credits are fantastic, showing the names of the film's
participants on concert handbills.  Fidelity was directed by Stephen
Frears (The Hi-Lo Country) and adapted from Hornby's novel by Cusack and
his Grosse Pointe Blank collaborators D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink,
as well as ConAir's Scott Rosenberg.  Their film is obviously a
carefully crafted labor of love that should be a big hit with everyone,
especially if you were born in the 1960s or 70s, still own a turntable
or ever worked in a record store.

Review for Story of Us, The (1999)
Rob Reiner has done the unfathomable: The accomplished director has
actually made a film as bad as his previous career low North.  With The
Story of Us, Meathead blends top Hollywood talent with an irritating
script to deliver a slow, torturously towering achievement in bad
filmmaking.  Not coincidentally, North author Alan Zweibel created this
story as well.
The film doesn't immediately seem to annoy, opening with a monologue
from Ben Jordan (Bruce Willis, The Sixth Sense) as he explains his idea
of true love.  Something about being married for sixty years and dying
days apart from one another; I don't know.  The film then launches into
present day, where Ben and his wife of fifteen years, Katie (Michelle
Pfeiffer, The Deep End of the Ocean), share a seemingly happy dinner
with their two children.  They play a game called "High/Low," where each
takes a turn describing their best and worst moments of the day.  It
seems like the perfect family, with white, toothy smiles all around.
Once the children excuse themselves, we eventually learn that it's all a
façade.  Ben and Katie's marriage has been rotting from the inside for
several years and, despite the approach of their anniversary, the two
plan to separate once they ship the unsuspecting kids off to summer
camp.
Katie explains to the camera  in her own monologue  why she feels her
marriage to Ben is failing, drawing a strange analogy between him and
the children's book Harold & the Purple Crayon.  I'm still not sure I
understand what she was talking about.  But we all know the real reason
Katie is unhappy.  I've seen the uncut version of Color of Night.  The
girl just isn't satisfied, if you know what I mean.
Anyway, the kids go to camp, Ben moves into a hotel, and through a
never-ending string of flashbacks we see how the two met and how things
got to the point of dissolution.  We glimpse a flashback montage of
bedroom fights.  We see flashbacks of happier days.  We view another
montage of hapless marriage counselor flashbacks.  As if the flashbacks
weren't enough, Reiner peppers the film with more monologues than
Macbeth.  It's almost like the guy is just scared to make a simple film
in the present time.
To make matters worse, we are also introduced to Ben and Katie's friends
as each meets their gender-specific cronies for lunch.  He tolerates his
two pals (Reiner and Paul Reiser) as they talk loudly about
masturbation, colon exams and cyber-sex.  She is treated to her chums
(Rita Wilson and Julie Hagerty) bitching about their husbands without
taking a second to either breathe or eat.  Ben and Katie just sit and
watch, amazed that so little has changed since the times of cavemen.
And can I just say how annoying Mrs. Tom Hanks is? Paul Reiser, too.
And why does Rob Reiner have to talk about his ass in every scene?  Does
he think he's Garry Shandling?  Writer Zweibel was the co-creator of
It's Garry Shandling's Show, so maybe he's the one with the ass
infatuation.
After two weeks, Ben and Katie can't stand being apart from each other
and make up excuses to call one another.  Thanks to some dry-cleaning
they meet for dinner, Ben as nervous as a pimply teen picking up his
prom date, while Katie glows like an 11-year-old that just got her first
kiss.  Things go well, but the evening is ruined in the film's only
legitimate comedic sequence.  I won't ruin it, but I will say that it
involves a bed, Red Buttons and Steve Allen's loudmouth wife.
If you have seen the film's trailer, you already know that the film is
chock full of melodramatic acoustic guitar playing.  It's fitting for a
movie featuring two idiots that think if they just touch each other's
feet in bed, all of their marital problems will be magically solved.
Willis, who was so wonderful in The Sixth Sense, reminds us how horrible
he was in the little-seen Breakfast of Champions, no doubt using his own
failed marriage as fodder for his celluloid screaming.  Pfeiffer, who
hasn't been in a blockbuster since she wore a cat-suit, looks pretty and
gets to have a bunch of different hairstyles because of the incessant
flashbacks.
Exiting the theater after a screening of this film, I overheard one
knucklehead saying that she didn't care for the language but was "happy
with the way everything ended," as if there was any doubt that they
would get back together.  I'm just glad they were able to do it in under
100 minutes.  I'm sure if the film went five minutes longer, Ben and
Katie would be history.
Potential viewers should just stay home and argue.  It's a lot cheaper.

Review for Snow Falling on Cedars (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Director Scott Hicks' visually stunning follow-up to the Oscar-nominated
Shine appears, on its surface, to be a simple murder mystery.  Instead,
Snow Falling on Cedars is an intricate tale of forbidden love, humanity,
integrity and decency.  Based on the best-selling novel by David
Guterson, Cedars is hauntingly beautiful, using long takes and close-ups
that show the story more than telling it.
Set in 1954 San Piedro, a tiny fishing village north of the Puget Sound,
Cedars opens aboard a ship on a particularly foggy evening.  The
fisherman, a meticulous, by-the-book sailor, is found the next morning
washed up in his own fishing net and with multiple stab wounds.  His
accused killer is Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a young man born in
America but of Japanese descent.  The murder and incarceration of Kazuo
reawakens both the prejudices of the small town's white population, with
Pearl Harbor still fresh in their minds, as well as reminding those of
Japanese ancestry of their imprisonment in internment camps the previous
decade.
Cedars' story concentrates on the aftermath of the death and subsequent
trial, which are some of the finest courtroom scenes ever filmed.  But
the strength of the film is its unusual narrative structure, offering
numerous flashbacks to several different periods in the history of the
town.  Some are directly related to the trial, while the majority of
these flashbacks concentrate on the childhood relationship between
Kazuo's wife Hatsue (Youki Kudoh, Mystery Train) and the son of the
town's newspaper owner, Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke, The Newton Boys).
Playmates as children, Hatsue and Ishmael grew closer and closer as the
years passed.  Knowing that she was forbidden to date white boys, the
two are forced to relegate their burgeoning passion to a hollowed-out
cedar tree in the woods near each of their homes.  But World War II
interrupts their already delicate bond; Hatsue and her family are
dragged off to an internment camp, while Ishmael is sent to fight for
his country.  Without divulging too much of the plot, Ishmael learns
that Hatsue has called off their relationship while he is overseas, and
the resulting scene still gives me chills when I think about it.
In the present day, Ishmael, who has inherited the Island Review from
his deceased father, recognizes the importance of the trial as it
relates to the future of his town.  Together with Kazuo's defense
attorney Nels Gudmundsson (Max von Sydow, What Dreams May Come), Ishmael
sets out to prove Kazuo's innocence, despite both the bigotry of the
majority of his advertisers and subscribers and the bitterness he feels
toward Kazuo for stealing the heart of the girl that he still loves.
It's tough to pick a place to begin praising the hypnotic and
atmospheric Cedars.  The film is jaw-in-your-lap beautiful, from the
silvery-black look to the steely water at the film's beginning, to the
vibrant red strawberry patches that Ishmael and Hatsue played in as
children, to the blinding white blizzard that engulfs the town during
the final stretch of the trial, to the darkness that hangs over the
candlelit courtroom as a result of the blizzard's disruption of the
building's power.  This is definitely Oscar-worthy work from one of last
year's nominees, Robert Richardson (The Horse Whisperer).
Pleasantville's art and production teams help give the film a rich,
realistic look and feel.  Editor Hank Corwin (Natural Born Killers)
pieces together the past and the future magnificently and without
seeming like a Lone Star rip-off (unlike Simpatico).  Of the
behind-the-scenes work, only the score (James Newton Howard, The Sixth
Sense) is slightly annoying.
It's very hard to imagine Ethan Hawke carrying a picture, and he doesn't
here.  It's a great role for him because he has few lines, required
mostly to look good and thoughtful instead.  James Cromwell (The Green
Mile) is typically wonderful as the presiding judge, but von Sydow
steals the show with his closing argument that all but flashes `For Your
Consideration' at the bottom of the screen.  His character seems
bewildered and frail, but he is still obviously a legal menace, capable
of swaying any jury.
Hicks, who adapted Guterson's novel with Ron Bass (Stepmom), should be
praised if not just for assembling the talent necessary to pull the film
off.  His direction is first-rate, repeatedly using long stretches with
no dialogue (especially as the Japanese are taken from their homes to
the internment camps), and his World War II scene is nearly as
devastating as Saving Private Ryan's Normandy invasion.  Hopefully Hicks
and his crew will be remembered when it's time to hand out nominations,
if not awards.

Review for L.I.E. (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If movies have taught us one thing over the last few years, it's that the
suburbs are a very dark, very screwed-up place.  L.I.E. confirms this
semi-revelation by taking the gritty subject matter of Kids and moving it
about 35 miles east to Dix Hills in Long Island's Suffolk County.  The title
refers to the Long Island Expressway in a not-so-subtle metaphor for the
fate of L.I.E.'s main character, who explains that some of the freeway's
lanes go straight to hell, having claimed the lives of such notables as
singer/songwriter Harry Chapin and director Alan J. Pakula, as well as his
own mother, who bought it on Exit 52.
His name is Howie Blitzer (Paul Franklin Dano) and he's a scrawny
15-year-old with braces and a talent for poetry.  Howie is a good kid who
has fallen in with a bad crowd, no doubt thanks to his mother's death and
his father Marty's (Bruce Altman, Girl Interrupted) refusal to get involved
in his son's life.  The two are clearly haunted by the death of their mother
and wife, with Marty turning to 80-hour workweeks and a live-in bimbo for
comfort, while Howie occasionally pulls a shoebox of his mother's bathroom
effects down from a shelf just so he can smell her perfume.
Part of the aforementioned "wrong crowd" includes Gary Terrio (Billy Kay,
The Guiding Light), a pierced, tattooed young man who gets Howie and two
others involved in a series of home break-ins that usually consist of
raiding the refrigerator (they're just bored, misguided kids, you see).
Gary, who holds somewhat of a sexual spell over Howie, is also a rent boy
who leads Howie to commit a basement burglary of a john upon whom he'd like
to exact a bit of revenge.
Howie knows nothing about Gary's extracurricular activities or that he's
being led into the den of one of the area's biggest pedophiles, "Big John"
Harrigan (Brian Cox, Rushmore), who hears the boys' attempt to rob him,
gives chase and manages to tear the pocket off of Howie's jeans.  The
ex-Marine (his license plate reads "BJ," which refers to both his nickname
and something he claims he can do better than anybody in the western
hemisphere) and pillar of the local community sniffs the pocket like an
animal, which is probably the most disturbing screen inhaling since Dennis
Hopper in Blue Velvet.  Like Velvet, it's a sign of bad things to come...or
so you might think.
A typical film about a child abuser would portray Big John as pure,
unadulterated evil, but here, he's kind and almost loving.  He listens to
Howie, which is something his own father never does.  The relationship
forged between Howie and the 60-something would-be monster is far from
predictable, and the film never judges any of its characters, whether they
diddle young boys or ignore their kids.  With an odd twist on that famous
scene from The Graduate, the film succeeds at getting the audience to
empathize with a pedophile, and for that, L.I.E. is somewhat groundbreaking.
L.I.E. is the debut of writer/director Michael Cuesta, who co-penned the
script with Stephen M. Ryder and Gerald Cuesta.  While the story sometimes
loses its way, the trio does a wonderful job at developing each of these
characters.  The film looks great, too, and is highlighted by a scene in
which Howie and Gary break into each other's homes and ransack each other's
rooms.
Those of you brave and lucky enough to see L.I.E. will be treated to Cox's
terrific performance that - and I can pretty safely guarantee this - nobody
will be talking about at the office water cooler.  No one would blame you
for being scared away by the film's content and its unfair NC-17 rating,
which was affixed by a clearly clueless MPAA.  L.I.E. contains absolutely no
nudity and only implied sexual content.  If anything, it's something parents
should want their kids to see, just so they can understand evil sometimes
comes in surprising disguises.

Review for Say It Isn't So (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The Hollywood Bakery has just concocted a new recipe that's bound to
tantalize the tastebuds of the tasteless throughout the country.  Add one
part American Pie to one part There's Something About Mary, bake for 90
minutes and - poof - out pops Say It Isn't So.  It's crudely funny and has a
story you'll likely forget about halfway home from the theatre.
So's voiceover gives us the important background on its main character as
the film opens.  Gilly Noble (Chris Klein, Here on Earth) was raised in an
orphanage and is currently working in Shelbyville, Indiana's animal control
department.  Despite his loneliness, Gilly still dreads having dinner with
his boss' severely dysfunctional family, which provides one of So's early
shock scenes and sets the pace for the rest of the film's seemingly endless
parade of sight gags.
Gilly becomes smitten with Jo Wingfield (Heather Graham, Bowfinger), a
former Shelbyville resident and hairdresser who has recently moved back to
town.  She's awful at her job, a point driven home in a scene that shows
everything Tarantino left out of Reservoir Dogs.  The two fall in love,
Gilly pops the question, and, shortly after they consummate their
relationship, Gilly finds out his birth parents are - surprise - Valdine and
Walter Wingfield (Sally Field and Richard Jenkins).  That makes him Jo's
brother, if you happen to be a little slow on the uptake.
Long story short, Jo moves back to Oregon (to a town called Beaver) and gets
engaged to a millionaire you know will turn out to be a really bad dude.
Gilly finds out he isn't really Jo's sibling, and the remaining 60 minutes
involves him trekking across the country to win back his true love.  Along
the way, he befriends a pilot who looks like Jimi Hendrix but swears he's
part American Indian (Orlando Jones, Double Take) and falls prey to a series
of jokes involving pubic hair, amputees, parapalegics and bovine proctology.
We're not talking subtle humor, people.  Here's the bottom line - if you
liked Pie and Mary, you'll like this.  If you didn't, stay home and shut up.
With a film like this, you can't expect too much from the actors.  It's hard
to tell if Graham is an airhead or just playing one on the screen.  Klein
comes off a little better, more than making up for the miserable Earth.
Jones logs his best performance yet and steals every scene he's in. Ditto
for Jenkins, but Field gives one of those
is-it-too-late-to-take-back-her-Oscar? performances.  Lin Shaye, a frequent
bit player in the Farrelly films, is surprisingly subdued here.  There's
cameo at the end that's kind of shocking and quite funny.
The gross-out jokes will definitely remind you of Pie and Mary, but the
feeble story is reminiscent of Mary, too.  Think about sad-sack Ben Stiller
(Klein) wooing the beautiful Cameron Diaz (Graham), meeting her wacky father
played by David Keith (Jenkins) and then horribly disfiguring his scrotum
(ear).  Klein was in Pie and is starring in this summer's sequel, and
Jenkins was just in the Farrelly's Me, Myself & Irene.  The similarities to
Pie and Mary extend behind the camera, too.  Director James B. Rogers,
making his debut here, served as the first assistant director on all four
Farrelly brothers' films and Pie (he's also directing Pie's sequel).  And
the Farrellys are producers here, as well.  It's all one, big, sick family.

Title
Review for Billy Elliot (2000)
Call it The Full Monty 2.  You can even call it Rocky VI - I don't
really care.  Billy Elliot is the `Feel Good Movie of the Year' in a
time when four of the last five Best Picture winners featured main
characters that died in the final reel.  It's just not cool to be the
FGMOTY anymore, and the films that try to shoot for FGMOTY status
usually fail miserably by cramming schmaltz down your throat (i.e., Pay
It Forward).
While Elliot's story isn't particularly groundbreaking, the film manages
to avoid the gimmicky devices and relentless button-pushing that usually
derail FGMOTY wannabes.  Instead, it relies on terrific acting
performances, highlighted by 13-year-old newcomer Jamie Bell, who plays
the titular Elliot.  I haven't found myself rooting for a character this
fiercely in a long, long time, and if this film doesn't put a smile on
your face and a lump in your throat, there's something very wrong with
you.
Elliot is set in a small town in northeast England during a coal miners'
strike in 1984.  The film opens with 11-year-old Billy jumping up and
down on his bed to his brother's record collection (the soundtrack is
loaded with T-Rex tunes).  Billy shares his bedroom with older brother
Tony (Jamie Draven), who, like their father (Gary Lewis, East is East),
spends his time on the picket line throwing produce at the scabs who
have taken their jobs.  Billy breaks up his day between keeping an eye
on his senile grandmother (Jean Heywood) and plunking away at the piano
that his dead mother used to play.
Although money is tight, Billy's father gives him a stipend for weekly
boxing lessons.  He's awful at it, and one night after practice, Billy
sticks around and watches a group of young girls learn ballet.
Infatuated by the dancing, Billy joins in and finds that he's quite good
at it, despite worrying that he'll become `a right sissy.'  The teacher,
Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters, Titanic Town), is a crass, chain-smoking
teacher who could be a cousin to Brenda Blethyn's character in Little
Voice, but she recognizes Billy's talent and suddenly finds herself with
a new interest in her work.
The rest of the film follows a fairly predictable trajectory, with Billy
struggling to perfect his craft for an audition at the Royal Ballet
School in London.  Mrs. Wilkinson becomes somewhat of a mother figure to
him, and his father and brother hit the roof when they find out that
their own blood is dabbling in poofy dancing (these are the kind of
blue-collar Englishmen that think Mikhail Barishnikov is a striker for
Dynamo Kiev).
The film does have a couple of minor hitches, like the inclusion of a
subplot featuring Billy's cross-dressing best friend (Stuart Wells, in
his film debut) and the failure to beef up the sweet but neglected
subplot involving Billy and Mrs. Wilkinson's daughter, Debbie (Nicola
Blackwell a dead ringer for Patricia Clarkson).  But the picture is
held together by a truly inspirational performance from young Bell, who
does an extremely good job of towing the delicate line between childhood
and adulthood.
Elliot is the feature film directorial debut of Stephen Daldry, whose
short film Eight was nominated for a British Academy Award in 1998.  The
script was written by Lee Hall, who is also making his feature film
debut with this film festival favorite that has fared well in the early
rounds of year-end accolades.  Comparisons to the out-of-left-field hit
The Full Monty are going to be inevitable, as each film features
working-class stiffs who become unlikely local heroes.  And I wouldn't
be surprised to see Elliot land a Monty-esque load of Oscar nominations,
either.

Review for Dangerous Beauty (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Poor Veronica.  She's in love with the wealthy Senator, Marco Venier.
But because of that pesky caste system, it is impossible for them to
marry.  So Veronica does the next logical thing.  She becomes a
courtesan.
Such is the allegedly true story behind Dangerous Beauty, a beautiful
yet unintentionally hilarious look at high-class whores in 1583 Venice.
Catherine McCormack (Braveheart) is Veronica, the milky-breasted hottie
with hair of spun copper who falls for her unobtainable hunk, the
bug/lazy-eyed nobleman played by Rufus Sewell (Dark City).  Luckily,
they live in a time when mistresses are pretty much acceptable.
Veronica's Mom (Jacqueline Bisset), a former courtesan (as was her
Mother), shows her future-slut-of-a-daughter the hooking ropes.  She
starts slowly, teaching Veronica how to properly eat and drink like a
seductive concubine and then quickly builds up to the proper technique
for `man-handling' the johns.
Showing little remorse or inhibition in her new profession, Veronica
eagerly pleases her first lay and quickly becomes the most popular
trollop in all of Venice.  She also possesses a unique flare for poetry,
which strangely makes the guys want her even more.  Early on, the city
is sent in to a tizzy by a very public and very silly sword and pen
fight between Veronica and Maffio Venier (Oliver Platt, A Time to Kill),
a friend of Marco.
When the Venetian warmongers turn to France for help in the impending
war over Cypress, the visiting horndog King Henry takes immediate notice
of Veronica and makes it clear that if she pleases him, he will lend his
ships for battle.  Now this King Henry is twice the man of both faggy
Prince Edward from Braveheart and the upcoming limp-wristed King Louis
in The Man in the Iron Mask.  Our Veronica shags him so well that he
commits most of his fleet.
So far, so good, but the story takes an idiotic twist involving the
plague and the religious right.  See, the church blames the plague on
the courtesans and, even though she curled the toes of the King of
France for her fair city, Veronica is deemed deserving of death for
being a dirty stinking harlot.  There is a big dumb Holy Inquisition
scene that borders on being wildly ridiculous.
I expected a more depressing ending from director Marshall Herskovitz
and producer Edward Zwick, the gloomy minds behind the quality
television tear-jerkers thirtysomething, My So Called Life and
relativity and, more dramatically, Legends of the Fall.  Herskovitz and
cinematographer Bojan Bazelli (Kalifornia) craft pictures of an
astonishingly dazzling quality.  The soft warm lighting brings to mind
the works of Emmanuel Lubezki (Like Water for Chocolate), Darius Khondji
(Stealing Beauty) and maybe even the Vaseline-coated photography of
Gerald Perry Finnerman (Moonlighting).
McCormack is thoroughly mesmerizing as Veronica, blending the
tantalizing qualities of both the Virgin Mother and Mary Magdalene
simultaneously.  She also resembles former Sports Illustrated swimsuit
model Paulina Porizkova.  Her beauty was obviously played down in
Braveheart as her acting skills were in Loaded.  Sewell is merely
adequate in his role, although the sex scene between the two is one of
the hottest screen spectacles since Broken English.
Dangerous Beauty could have been a much better movie if it didn't take
the ugly turn towards Demi Moore's The Scarlet Letter.  But, I guess
when you're filming a true story, you don't have too many options to
liven things up.  And, in this case, that's just too bad.

Title
Review for Hannibal (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
It would be difficult to walk into Hannibal without any preconceived
notions. To begin with, it's only the fourth sequel to a film that won the
Academy Award for Best Picture (even though all but The Godfather, Part II
sucked eggs). Even more rare is the fact that The Silence of the Lambs swept
the five major Oscar categories (Picture, Director, Actor, Actress,
[Adapted] Screenplay) - a feat achieved but twice (1975's One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest and 1934's It Happened One Night).
As if that wasn't enough, Hannibal has generated enough dish to be the
leading story on Entertainment Tonight since Thomas Harris' sequel abruptly
surfaced on bookstore shelves in the summer of 1999. The novel was too
gruesome for Lambs' director (Jonathan Demme) and screenwriter (Ted Tally).
Then, producer Dino De Laurentiis (U-571) paid an ungodly amount of money
for the screen rights to the book. Jodie Foster was in, but wanted to be
paid almost as much as Lambs cost to make. Then she was scared off by the
material as well. Her equally important counterpart, Anthony Hopkins, had
recently announced his retirement from film (What's up with that? He was in,
like, four movies last year). The casting nightmares, along with the
critically poor reception of Harris' novel, seemed to doom the project
before it could even begin.
What you can't deny is that Hannibal's assemblage of acting talent is pretty
amazing. Two-time Oscar nominee Julianne Moore (Magnolia) replaces Foster as
Clarice Starling, while Hopkins reprises the role that won him a Best Actor
trophy. Gary Oldman, who could see Oscar action for his recent turn in The
Contender, appears here, but is uncredited (and even more unrecognizable).
Even some of the smaller roles, played by folks like Giancarlo Giannini,
have been to Oscar's big dance (for Seven Beauties).
As impressive as that collection of talent is, the technical players are
even more extraordinary. Director Ridley Scott and his Gladiator gang
(cinematographer John Mathieson, editor Pietro Scalia, costume designer
Janty Yates and scoremeister Hans Zimmer) are all likely to receive Oscar
nominations for their action epic just days after Hannibal opens. Ditto
David Mamet (State and Main), who shares a screenwriting credit with
Schindler's List's Oscar winner Steven Zaillian (although, reportedly, Mamet
's draft was scrapped).
So is it any good? It'll depend on what your expectations are. Hannibal is a
really good film, but it's nowhere near as earth-shattering as Lambs. It' s
pretty faithful to the book, although that's not saying much, since the
story seemed to be curiously cobbled together. They're both set 10 years
after Lambs concluded. Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter is on the loose in
Tuscany, while Starling is still holding down her gig as an FBI agent.
Hannibal opens with Starling heading a botched raid of a D.C. drug dealer's
hideout. She loses a friend and her credibility, and finds her face splashed
all over the news for the first time since she used Lecter's help to catch
the serial killer knows as Buffalo Bob. She gets busted down to a desk job,
where she obsesses about catching Lecter and takes flack from ex-lover and
Justice Department stuffed shirt Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta).
In the meantime, one Mason Verger (Oldman) is close to flushing Lecter out
of his Italian hiding spot. Verger was Lecter's fourth victim, and the only
one who survived his encounter, but had his face sliced apart for good
measure (think The Grinch sans green fur). He's as rich as they come, and
has been trying to track down Lecter for years, hoping to bring him back to
his Virginia estate for a particularly gruesome farewell. The first half of
the film involves Verger bribing an Italian cop (Giannini) to lead his men
to Lecter. His plan, of course, goes horribly awry, and Lecter heads for the
States to have a showdown with both Verger and Starling. The ending is
excruciating and as gruesome as you've likely heard, but after the gore is
over, its conclusion is different and more pleasing than the one found in
the novel.
Some people may have a problem with the pacing of the film. It's 30 minutes
before you see Lecter properly (not in a flashback, or on video), and the
whole section in Italy takes a while to get moving. But when it does, it's a
thing of beauty. Particularly well done is a scene where Starling tries to
locate Lecter in a crowded area of D.C. while he talks to her on a cell
phone. It's a great cat-and-mouse chase with a surprising ending to those
that haven't read the book. Moore does a capable job as Starling, but Foster
left some pretty big shoes to fill. If they were size 8, Moore is around a
7.
Hannibal was shot in Tuscany, Sardinia, and in and around the D.C. area,
including stops at properties owned by James Madison and the Vanderbilt
family. Like Gladiator, it's a technically slick little film, with
razor-sharp editing and a string-and-opera-heavy score that uses
over-the-top classical music standards to underscore the almost comedic
violence, like Kubrick did with A Clockwork Orange. Complaints are minor,
like the Italians who don't speak Italian (which really makes you appreciate
the authenticity in Traffic), but all of that will be wiped from your memory
after the finale, where Liotta does his best impression of George W. Bush.

Review for Last Resort (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Ever get claustrophobic even though you have an entire city in which to
roam?  That's just how Tanya and Artyom feel when they try to move from
Moscow to London in Last Resort, the first film from Shooting Gallery's 2001
Film Series.  The film, which could possibly redefine the word "bleak," has
won awards at a number of festivals and garnered director Pawel Pavlikovsky
the Most Promising Newcomer Award at the British version of the Oscars.
Upon arrival in the UK, young mother Tanya (Dina Korzun) and her
ten-year-old son Artyom (Artyom Strelnikov) are given the third degree by a
customs officer.  Tanya, who doesn't have a firm grasp of the English
language, explains she and her son are heading to London to meet her fiancé.
Because she has little money and no work permit, Tanya tells the customs
officer she's a refugee in the hopes they'll leave the pretty children's
book illustrator alone long enough to contact her beau.
They don't, though.  Tanya and Artyom are taken to coastal Stonehaven, which
is, essentially, a holding area for immigrants that England doesn't want
wandering around London.  They get a free flat (in a building called
Dreamland," of all things) and vouchers for food, but as political asylum
applicants, they must stay in Stonehaven for at least a year.  Withdrawing
the application can take up to six months.  So Tanya is stuck with no work
permit (and no jobs even if she had one) and a fiancé who won't return her
calls (shades of Felicia's Journey) while she tries to get by in a drab town
full of security cameras and fish dinners that contain no fish at all.
While the street-smart Artyom (think a Growing Pains-era Leonardo DiCaprio)
begins to associate with a seedy crowd, two men offer to give Tanya (think a
Russian Emily Watson) a hand - one is a successful businessman and the other
is an ex-con.  The entrepreneur is an Internet porn guru (Lindsey Honey -
he's the Al Goldstein of the U.K.) who wants Tanya to drop her knickers for
a live video stream that could net her big bucks.  The ex-con (Paddy
Considine, Born Romantic), a kindly arcade manager and part-time bingo
caller (making Resort the second Brit film of the year to feature a bingo
caller - the other is House!), is a sweetie who falls for Tanya, befriends
her boy and helps them out with furnishing and decorating their tiny
apartment.
Resort, which has an ending that's just about as un-Hollywood as they come,
is reminiscent of Jim Jarmusch's Down By Law, which featured characters
spending the entire film trying to escape from a dreary place only to end up
in a place just as dreary.  Pavlikovsky, who has made a career of filming
documentaries for the BBC (they financed Resort, too), does a great job
wielding his handheld camera to make this film feel like a documentary, as
well.  He and cinematographer Ryszard Lenczewski also add a few startlingly
well-composed shots that are beautiful, yet add to Resort's overall
dreariness.

Review for Max Keeble's Big Move (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
August and September are a wasteland when it comes to children's films, and
October is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios don't want to
see slaughtered against family-oriented Thanksgiving films.  Last year, the
benevolent studio gods gave us Digimon, and this year, they bestow Max
Keeble's Big Move on delighted moviegoers across the country.  Parents will
be thrilled because they'll finally have something to drag little Austin and
Kayla to see that doesn't smell nearly as much like ass as Digimon did.
Don't get me wrong - Keeble, which is actually only a "ment" away from being
a fetish film, isn't that entertaining.  In fact, you'd be better off
waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics (Monsters,
Inc., Harry Potter) come out next month.  But if Dubya Dubya III tells you
to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy, then you'd better do it
(because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isn't going to cut it).
We first see young Max Keeble (Alex D. Linz, Home Alone 3) as a pint-sized
superhero, delivering newspapers with the pinpoint accuracy of a David
Beckham cross, foiling the diabolical plans of the evil ice cream man (Jamie
Kennedy, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and landing the neighborhood honey
(Brooke Anne Smith), who, by the way, is the hottest chick in a Disney film
since Emmanuelle Chriqui played Claire Boner in Snow Day.
The scenario is, of course, a dream.  Max is really a doofus and he wakes up
on his first day of junior high school with a pessimistic attitude, no luck
with the ladies and only two friends, both of whom can kindly be described
as social outcasts (and who were both in Snow Day) - the perpetually robed
Robe (Josh Peck) and a clarinet-playing cutie named Megan (Summer Catch's
Zena Grey), who harbors secret feelings for Max.
Things don't get any better for Max when he arrives at school.  He has to
contend with, among other things, a red-hot science teacher (Amber Valletta,
Family Man), a pair of polar-opposite bullies (Noel Fisher and Orlando
Brown), and an illiterate principal (Larry Miller, The Princess Diaries)
who's secretly diverting the school's last dime into the football program.
When Max's father (grownup Nerd Robert Carradine) unexpectedly announces the
family is moving to a new town at the end of the week, Max decides this is
the perfect time to exact revenge on everyone who pisses him off.  Whoa -
don't worry, parents.  He doesn't do it Klebold-Harris style.  It's all
pretty tame stuff, but Max ends up in hot water when Dad nixes the move,
leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings.
Director Tim Hill (Muppets From Space) adds a few nice touches, like Max's
voiceover character introductions for the film's main characters and a
flashback scene that's pretty funny, but there isn't too much else happening
here stylewise...unless you count some farting, a little puking, and a
couple of bizarre cameos from Tony Hawk and Lil' Romeo.

Review for Beyond the Mat (1999)
There is one particularly thought-provoking moment in the new
professional wrestling documentary Beyond the Mat.  The setting is just
before a World Wrestling Federation extravaganza called `The Royal
Rumble,' where two competitors calmly discuss the choreography of their
well-scripted WWF title match scheduled for later that evening.  The
wrestlers are defending champ Mick Foley (a.k.a. Cactus Jack [a.k.a.
Mankind]) and The Rock, but that's not what makes this moment
noteworthy.  It's the fact that these two gentlemen are responsible for
the #1 and #2 slots on the current New York Times list of the country's
best-selling books.  I couldn't help but wonder if Ernest Hemingway and
William Faulkner had a similar conversation before their steel cage
match.
That is one of the few memorable interludes from Barry W. Blaustein's
film.  Blaustein, a screenwriter on several Eddie Murphy films
(including The Nutty Professor and its forthcoming sequel Nutty II: The
Klumps), describes himself as a lifelong fan of professional wrestling.
He knows it's fake, but still loves the theatrical pageantry and
athletics involved.  Once Blaustein declares his adoration of the faux
sport, you know that this isn't going to be a hysterical look at the
inbred legions of wrestling fans throughout the country (like
Trekkies).  That approach would have made for a much more substantial
and less one-sided film.  Mat is more of a fluff-piece.
Experienced documentary fans may assume that since Blaustein avoided the
mocking nature of Trekkies-style films, Mat must be a carefully
composed, beautifully lensed picture with a compelling score, like the
works of Errol Morris (Mr. Death).  Wrong.  Mat isn't even shot on
film.  It's like watching somebody's homemade video of a family
picnicif their family consisted primarily of clinically insane,
middle-aged, overweight wrestling uncles.
Mat begins promisingly enough, with Blaustein and his crew filming
within the posh confines of the WWF world headquarters.  Before the film
shows WWF honcho Vince McMahon interview an ex-footballer that can vomit
on command, a Senior Marketing Vice President of the billion-dollar
company compares the WWF to the Muppets  with a straight face.  He says
they're both family-owned businesses, but fails to provide any other
evidence of similarity.  I must have forgotten about that puking Muppet
on Sesame Street who kept bashing Snuffleupagus with a chair.
The documentary then downshifts into a wrestling school run by an
accountant as wide as he is tall.  Specifically, this portion of the
film focuses on two up-and-comers  WWF hopefuls that get a huge break
when they're allowed to fake-fight on the undercard of a WWF tour stop.
So far, so good.
Mat loses steam by telling the tale of Terry Funk, a `living legend'
(a.k.a. washed-up has-been) from Amarillo, Texas.  Funk still wrestles
despite warnings from his doctor and pleadings from his family.  Using
his two bad knees, Funk helps support a fledgling wrestling group called
Extreme Championship Wrestling land their first pay-per-view event.
It's fun to watch the looks on the faces of Funk's wife and children as
he wrestles.  Is it embarrassment or genuine concern for the welfare of
a close relative?
Mat's next subject sucks the remaining life out of the film.  Another
wrestler in the twilight of his career  one Jake `The Snake' Roberts 
recounts a life story that would make Jerry Springer drool.  His saga
includes incest, murder, rape, kidnapping and crack addiction.  Roberts
really brings the film down, not so much with the content of his story,
but rather the way he (and Blaustein) tells it.  He doesn't move his
mouth much, which made me think that it would have been better to use
photographs of a younger Roberts instead.  But then I realized that you
would still be able to hear his monotonous, sleep-inducing tone.
Things pick up a bit when Mat shows Foley/Cactus/Mankind getting a wound
on his head that resembles a woman's private parts after being
repeatedly beaten by a folding chair brandished by The Rock.  This
beat-down is as real as the horrified looks on the faces of Foley's
teary-eyed wife and sobbing kids that watch from the front row.  But
then Blaustein goes back to the much less interesting Roberts.  The
result is a film that's choppy, uneven and practically screams `Jesus,
show wrestlers and their fans as deranged carny folk and freaks of
nature that evolution passed by!'  That's the film that I wanted to
see.  Instead, Mat is a biased story of a billion-dollar industry that
must have tons of skeletons in its closet.  But it didn't even open the
closet door.

Title
Review for Tarzan (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Disney's annual summer animation extravaganza begins promisingly 
there's no annoying Mickey Mouse cartoon and about ten minutes of
fantastic-looking action with no dialogue or song.  But it can't keep up
the pace and it fails to generate the laughs that adults have enjoyed in
Disney's past two summer hits, Mulan and Hercules.
Don't get me wrong  it's certainly not a bad film.  Disney and
screenwriter Tab Murphy (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) do an admirable
job of adapting the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs novel.  The script
pulls no punches and might actually be a bit jarring and melancholy for
the youngsters.  And old-timers beware - this ain't your father's
Tarzan.  The loin-clothed wonder not only swings from vines, but also
surfs down tree trunks like those bastard kids that rollerblade down the
handrails in front of the post office.
The infant Tarzan (voiced by Alex D. Linz, Home Alone 3) and his parents
land on a deserted island after narrowly escaping death on a flaming
ship.  They quickly build a remarkable treehouse (a la Swiss Family
Robinson) and seem fairly content spending their lives in their remote
surroundings.  But one day, a bloodthirsty leopard slays both parents,
leaving the tot to be discovered by Kala (Glenn Close, 101 Dalmatians),
a gorilla that ironically lost her only child to the same deadly feline.
When Kala brings the human child home to the tight-knit gorilla
community, she is met with great resistance  especially from her
husband and primate leader, Kerchak (Lance Henriksen, Millenium).  The
boy grows up feeling like an outcast, but is able to befriend a
similarly aged gorilla named Terk (annoyingly voiced by nasally K-Mart
pitch-person and media whore Rosie O'Donnell) and a bumbling elephant,
Tantor (Wayne Knight, Seinfeld's Newman).
Years later, an older and more chiseled Tarzan (Tony Goldwyn, Kiss the
Girls) turns everything around when he saves Kerchak's life after the
savage leopard attacks the patriarchal figure.  In an instant, Tarzan
becomes a man, unknowingly avenges the death of his birth parents, wins
the affection of Kerchak and develops his trademark yell.  But the
excitement doesn't stop there.  Almost immediately after dispatching the
deadly leopard, the jungle is jolted by the sound of gunfire.  There are
visitors on the island!
Of course, the visitors include Jane (Minnie Driver, An Ideal Husband),
the girl who would be Mrs. Tarzan.  Almost instantly, she strays from
her three-party group  father Porter (Nigel Hawthorne, The Winslow Boy)
and trigger-happy bad guy Clayton (Brian Blessed, Boss Nass in Episode
One)  and quickly finds herself being chased by a bunch of angry
baboons.  Tarzan saves her and realizes that Jane is more like him than
his monkey brethren.
Having not been trained in human social skills, Tarzan shocks Jane by
first mimicking her and then violating her `personal boundaries' by
looking up her dress and jamming his head between her perky Disney
breasts.  Needless to say, the two hit it off and Tarzan even considers
leaving the island to return home with Jane.  If she had simply put out,
he probably would have gone with her, leaving the film with a completely
different ending.
Tarzan was directed by Chris Buck (his debut) and Kevin Lima (A Goofy
Movie) and features new music from former Genesis frontman Phil
Collins.  His songs replace the big, flashy musical numbers that usually
plague Disney toons, leaving precious little time to develop any
semblance of a story.  But that isn't the case here  the absence of
singing characters is welcomed in any film.  (1:30  Rated G, but
contains some seriously depressing and violent scenes)

Title
Review for Deep Rising (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Welcome to January  the month of movie hell.  One needs to only look
back to past Januarys to see that studios dump crappy projects onto the
unsuspecting audience faster than Kirstie Alley can pound tequila
shooters.  Fierce Creatures, Zeus & Roxanne, Turbulence, Bio-Dome, Eye
for an Eye, The Relic , Bed Of Roses  Bleah!  Chalk Deep Rising up to
the list of shame.
The way that I see it, if you're going to rip off another film, you
might as well make it a good one.  Deep Rising is a offensive
combination of bad Anaconda and a worse Event Horizon.  Its story is
unimaginative and the acting is even worse.  Treat Williams is making a
late charge for the elusive `Worst Actor Of The Decade' title.  Too bad,
Keanu got such a big jump on him.
The story begins on the super-luxury liner `The Argonautica', where the
rich dine and gamble until something knocks it all to hell.  Then, we
cut to a rag-tag bunch on a smaller boat.  The leader is John Finnegan
(Williams) and he and his hapless crew are apparently chartering their
boat to a group of missile-toting thugs.  They break down and seek
refuge on `The Argonautica'.
But, waitthe giant boat is empty, and thus the endless tirade of
cliches and unoriginal situations begin.  Finnegan even utters the line
`I've got a really bad feeling about this'.  So do I, pal.  So do I.
At one point, Finnegan rescues the stock female off of `The Argonautica'
and leads her to his boat to make the big getaway and she utters `That
heap of junk is your ship?'.  Well tape some cinnamon buns to her head
and call me a Wookie.  Finnegan also pilfers the line `Now there's
something you don't see everyday' from ConAir.  And it's not even a
great line.
There are a few good gory scenes and Finnegan's Shaggy-like sidekick
provides adequate comic moments, but it still stinks.  Director Stephen
Sommers, whose previous credits include both Tom & Huck and The
Adventures of Huck Finn, may or may not have been alive during
production.  He has been tagged to helm The Mummy from the Anne Rice
novel.  If she made such a big stink about Tom Cruise playing Lestat,
she'll drop dead over this.

Title
Review for Bread and Roses (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Ken Loach has made a career of directing films that feature scrappy,
blue-collar protagonists that deal with class conflicts and other inequities
rooted in money, power and politics.  He has always worked outside the
Hollywood system, and one of his early documentaries (Cathy Come Home) was
so powerful, it actually led to a change in England's laws concerning the
homeless.
Having apparently tapped every possible unjust social issue in the U.K.,
Loach loaded up his truck and moved to Beverly.  Or Los Angeles, that is.
Bread and Roses is Loach's first American film, but don't be fooled by its
shooting location.  It's still packed full of rah-rah social commentary, and
even though Roses takes place within spitting distance of Tinseltown, it was
still independently financed.
No matter what anyone tells you, Roses isn't the name of the ballyhooed
return to music by Axl Rose.  The film takes place in the spacious glass
towers of downtown Los Angeles, where multi-million-dollar deals are
routinely made every day.  But when darkness falls, the empty buildings are
taken over by dirt-poor cleaning crews, largely made up of illegal aliens
from south of the border.  They make very little money and have no benefits.
Miss a day of work, for any reason at all, and you're fired.  Hey - not all
of those downtown businessmen are as nice as Leland McKenzie.
Pilar Padilla plays Maya, a recent import from Tijuana who gets a cleaning
job through her older sister Rosa (Elpidia Carrillo).  They work their
fingers to the bone for a few measly dollars and the privilege of having the
people they're cleaning up after look down their noses at them.  But the
grueling, repetitive world of office cleaning is set on its ear when a union
organizer named Sam (Adrien Brody, Liberty Heights) arrives on the scene.
He heads an organization called Janitors for Justice and has just
successfully negotiated benefits for cleaners in Chicago.  He tries to get
the L.A. janitors to unionize, but they're all too scared about silly things
like losing their jobs and being deported.  Eventually they come around and
become Sam's army of picketing, sign-wielding minorities.
Roses comes to a head during an emotional, well-acted battle between Maya
and Rosa, the former finding herself falling in love with Sam, while the
latter is firmly anti-union.  There's also a pretty cool protest scene where
the J for Js crash a party full of big Hollywood stars, like Gary Busey, Ron
Perlman, Tim Roth, that guy from Deuce Bigalow and Benicio Del Toro (Jesus -
can he give it a rest already?).
Yeah!  Go union!  Fight the Man!  Disrupt his business meetings!  Crash his
parties!  Generally raise a lot of - what?  What's that?  Hmmm.  That's a
good point.  What rights are you due when you're not supposed to be here in
the first place?  Maybe that's why I had a problem mustering sympathy for
the protagonists.  We're talking about folks who keep quiet and fly under
the radar to avoid getting booted out of a country they entered illegally.
Michael Moore can do a much better job of making potentially unsympathetic
people more likeable in his pursuit for truth and justice.
Roses reminded me a lot of Haskell Wexler's documentary called Bus Riders
Union.  Like Roses, it was set in Los Angeles, but pitted the poor community
against the city's Metro Transit Authority.  It's probably because Loach's
directorial style gives Roses a bit of a documentary feel.  The film's
dialogue is great and rarely seems scripted, even though longtime Loach
collaborator Paul Laverty's story is kind of weak as a whole.

Review for End of the Affair, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Neil Jordan's (In Dreams) latest is a lean adaptation of Graham Greene's
novel of the same name.  There isn't much to the story (some even say
that the book would have been better as a novella) and there aren't many
characters.  But thanks to first-rate acting talent and gorgeously dark
cinematography, The End of the Affair is still a winner.
The story takes place in London during and after World War II, where
Sarah Miles (Julianne Moore, An Ideal Husband) steps out on her boring,
loveless, civil-servant husband Henry (Stephen Rea, Guinevere) to have a
torrid affair with a novelist named Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes, The
Avengers).  Their trysts begin in 1939 and the two carry on unchecked
for years until one day Sarah abruptly calls off the relationship
without even giving Maurice a reason.
Years later, Maurice is still perplexed about the termination of their
affair.  Believing that she left him for another man, he hires a private
investigator (Ian Hart, Enemy of the State) to shadow his ex-lover.
Their relationship is shown in a series of intricate flashbacks, with
the first half of the film from Maurice's perspective and the second
from Sarah's as he reads it from a diary lifted by the PI.
Jordan's unique structure and Roger Pratt's (12 Monkeys) haunting camera
work complement the great performances from Fiennes, Moore and Hart.
The story of jealousy and lust is simple and predictable, yet in the
capable hands of this cast and crew, The End of the Affair is always
entertaining.

Review for Veuve de Saint-Pierre, La (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Juliette Binoche, perhaps the most unlikely (and most undeserving) Best
Actress nominee in recent memory, does a full 180° with her latest film, The
Widow of Saint-Pierre.  In the dazzlingly overrated Chocolat, Binoche played
Vianne, a woman with some serious man issues.  She was always either running
away from the opposite sex, or helping other women to do the same. But in
Widow, her character is a firm believer than even the most vile man can
change under the right circumstances.
Binoche plays Pauline, a resident of tiny Dog Island off the coast of
Newfoundland, which was a French territory at the time the film is set
(1849).  She's married to a Parisian man named Jean (Daniel Auteuil, Girl on
the Bridge), who is referred to simply as The Captain by the rest of the
island's crusty inhabitants.  Note: In case you're unfamiliar with French
cinema, the presence of Binoche and Auteuil in the same film is a little
like seeing Brad and Julia in The Mexican.
One morning, the residents of Dog Island awake to a grisly scene.  It seems
the evening before, two fishermen cut up their boss to settle a drunken
argument (one thought the man was fat, and the other merely big).  The town,
of course, is outraged, the men are quickly tried, and the Powers That Be
declare the man who did the cutting should lose his head, while his cohort
is sentenced to a life of hard labor (he dies shortly after transport).
The problem is that Dog Island has neither an executioner nor the means to
perform an execution.  They order a guillotine from Paris, but it won't
arrive until the following spring.  In the meantime, Pauline decides the
surviving prisoner, Ariel Neel Auguste (played by the great Yugoslavian
filmmaker Emir Kusturica), should be rehabilitated.  She excuses his drunken
actions, letting Auguste live in her house and help her with her greenhouse.
Pauline even gives him intimate reading lessons, and none of it seems to
bother Jean, who seems to like his horse even more than his wife.  Does
Pauline have tingly feelings for Auguste, or is she just another left-wing
crybaby?
When spring finally rolls around and the guillotine arrives, Dog Island has
become quite attached to their wonderful prisoner, at which point Widow
becomes kind of a preachy, anti-death-penalty film.  If somebody wanted to
watch one of those, they'd rent The Chamber (and judging from its box office
take, nobody does).  Claude Faraldo's script just isn't that interesting,
especially compared to director Patrice Leconte's last film, the wonderfully
original Girl on the Bridge (Leconte is becoming the John Sayles of France,
picking drastically different projects each time around). The highlight here
is the lovely photography from Eduardo Serra (Unbreakable).
Binoche is nearly good enough to make you forget how ridiculous Chocolat
was, and Auteuil clocks in with another typically strong and stoic
performance.  Kusturica does well, especially for a first-time actor (he
recently directed the arthouse hit Black Cat, White Cat).  As an aside,
Widow is the first of two imports we'll see this year that show prisoners
being rehabilitated through gardening.  The other, due this summer, is
called Greenfingers and stars Croupier's Clive Owen as a convict with a
green thumb.

Title
Review for Payback (1999)
Mel Gibson's latest action vehicle is PAYBACK (* ˝), a terribly violent,
terribly choppy film that's, well, just plain terrible.  Armed with the
expectation of seeing Gibson in the rare role of a bad guy, viewers will
instead find every other character so unimaginatively despicable that
Gibson will still emerge smelling like a rose.  But more on that later.
First, a little history
Payback was actually filmed a while ago by first-time director Brian
Helgeland, last year's Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay (L.A.
Confidential) and the writer of Gibson's 1997 action blockbuster
Conspiracy Theory.  Reportedly, Gibson was so unhappy with the finished
product that he convinced the studio to jettison Helgeland out of the
editing room, leaving Gibson to make the final cut himself.  Now, mind
you, this shouldn't be like Jean-Claude Van Damme suddenly gaining
control of a film  Gibson is, after all, an Oscar-winning director
(Braveheart).  But sadly, it is.
Gibson plays Porter, an ex-Marine turned hoodlum that has just scored
$70,000 by robbing a Chinese money-laundering syndicate.  His
heroin-addicted wife (Deborah Kara Unger, The Game) double-crosses him
after the heist, leaving Porter with two ugly bullet holes in his back
while Porter's pilfering partner makes off with all of the loot,
planning to use it to join a mysterious group called `The Outfit.'
In order to get his $70,000 back, Porter starts at the bottom of the
crime world (David Paymer) and works his way to the head of The Outfit
(Kris Kristofferson), meeting many zany characters along the way.  He
also gets back together with Rosie (Maria Bello, Permanent Midnight [and
now 0 for 2 in film since leaving ER]), his girlfriend who also happens
to be a whore controlled by The Outfit.  The only other female in
Payback is an Asian hooker with a specialty in sadomasochism.  So, for
those of you women keeping track at home, that's two whores and a
junkie.  And the three of them are routinely beaten by whichever male
character happens to be in the scene with them.  Hey, you've come a long
way, baby!
Early into the picture, in one of the only pleasing scenes, we see a
beat-up and penniless Porter stealing $3 from a panhandler and parlaying
it into a new suit, a new gun and several hundred dollars by simply
pick-pocketing and leaving lousy tips.  The film is also accented by
Porter's sporadic, gravel-voiced narrations that seem haphazardly thrown
in just to make the awkward scenes blend together better.  There are
also several scenes that run out of sequence; again, probably due to
Gibson's attempt to salvage his project.  For his $20 million fee, he
could have offered to do a lot more.
As an added bonus, every frame of Payback seems to be bathed in blue
light.  You may have seen the style before in television commercials or
your favorite music videos.  I have no idea what this means.  Is it a
metaphor for the cheerless downcasts that the film portrays?  Or is it
symbolic of its crude, distasteful content?  Maybe cinematographer
(Ericson Core, 187) just likes the color blue.  It would have been
better served if used just for the flashback scenes.  Or not at all.
Helgeland also co-wrote the bland script with Terry Hayes, who scripted
Gibson's last two Mad Max films.  It was based on Donald E. Westlake's
novel `The Hunter' which he wrote under the pseudonym Richard Stark.
Helgeland and Hayes should have used pseudonyms as well.  Their story is
as boring as it is formulaic, and its unnecessary graphic violence and
obscenity-laced dialogue often induced my fellow viewers into
uncomfortable laughter and, I swear to God, audible wincing.
Payback and Gibson's Porter are best summed up by the genius that sat
behind me, who, in one particularly ridiculous scene, exclaimed, `Man,
he's whack!'  Whack, indeed.
Payback (1:44) is rated R for graphic violence and lewd language

Title
Review for Mansfield Park (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Mansfield Park isn't a great movie.  Heck, it may not even be a good
movie.  It's the kind of period romance picture where you can tell who
each character will end up with romantically after about ten minutes.
The premise  a young girl uprooted from her impoverished family to live
with wealthy relatives - sounds like a bad Cinderella knock-off.  Yet
somehow, despite this, Park is damn entertaining.
How could something so predictable be so enjoyable?  For starters, the
film is based on a novel written by Jane Austen, the most consistent and
prolific writer of romantic comedies in the late 1990s.  Which is pretty
sad since she's been dead for almost 200 years.  Think about it  she
published four books when she was alive and their big screen adaptations
this decade have resulted in an Oscar and Writers Guild Award (Sense and
Sensibility), a Writers Guild nomination (Emma), a National Society of
Film Critics Award (Clueless, which was based on Emma) and an Emmy
nomination (Pride and Prejudice).  And not only is the film based on
Austen's 1814 novel, but also on her personal letters and journals,
which renders the film a bit more autobiographical than the book.
In the film, a ten-year-old girl named Fanny Price (Hannah
Taylor-Gordon, Jakob the Liar) is sent to Mansfield Park, her Aunt
Bertram's wealthy estate in Northamptonshire.  Fanny thinks the move
from her family's hovel in Portsmouth is temporary, but she quickly
learns otherwise.  Although she is treated like an unwanted stepchild
(especially by her snooty cousins Julia and Maria), Fanny is a gracious
guest during her stay at Mansfield.  She passes the time writing her
younger sister with creatively outlandish stories of her new
surroundings and new family.  She reads the letters presumably Austen's
letters - directly into the camera.  Fanny also finds comfort in her
cousin Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller, Plunkett & Macleane), who is sharp
enough to overlook the differences in their social status.
Years later, an older Fanny (Frances O'Connor, Kiss or Kill) has
accepted her place in the Bertram caste system.  She's content to be in
the presence of her kin and guests, but is relegated to the background
of most societal functions.  But Mansfield Park is thrown into upheaval
when a brother/sister team hit the local scene.  Londoner Mary Crawford
(Embeth Davidtz, The Gingerbread Man) is a gossipy meddler that
recognizes Fanny as a bright young woman, declaring that she has a
`tongue sharper than a guillotine.'  Brother Henry Crawford (Alessandro
Nivola, Face/Off) is instantly smitten with Fanny, who must choose
between a superficial marriage that will secure both her social status
and the family's name, and an unlikely romance with the uninterested
Edmund, who wants to be a clergyman.
Directed and adapted by Patricia Rozema (When Night is Falling), Park
looks great and is lensed by Michael Coulter (Sense and Sensibility).
The art and production teams are led by Velvet Goldmine vets Andrew
Munro and Christopher Hobbs.  Of other note is the performance of
Lindsay Duncan (An Ideal Husband), who plays both Fanny's mother and
Lady Bertram.  Rozema's careful direction almost explains away the
predictability of the film by having Fanny deliver a nifty monologue
(directly into the camera again), saying `It could have turned out
differently  but it didn't.'  I guess we'll have to wait for the
Mansfield South Park spoof.  Or the big screen version of Austen's
posthumously published Northanger Abbey, which is set to star Rachel
Leigh Cook.

Review for Filth and the Fury, The (2000)
Julien Temple's second swing at documenting the rise and fall of British
punk purveyors The Sex Pistols is a home run deep into the center field
bleachers. Hell, The Filth & The Fury is one of those moon shots that's
still going up when you finally lose sight of it  a legendary rip that
actually knocks the cover off the ball, leaving the rawhide wrapping to
float gently back down into the hands of a lucky kid that, God willing,
will one day be inspired to radically overhaul the crappy state of music
today. We're about due for another sweeping change  there was a
twenty-two year gap between Bill Haley and the Comets `(We're Gonna)
Rock Around the Clock' and the Pistols `God Save the Queen (She Ain't No
Human Being).' And it's been another twenty-two since the Pistols' song
hit number one (or, as shown in Fury, since it didn't hit number one).
Don't tell me that it's `Boy Bands,' either, because I'll legally
acquire an automatic rifle and pepper MTV's Times Square studio with
enough metal to turn Carson Daly into the Tin Man, I swear to God.
See  just talking about The Sex Pistols gets people riled up. In a
music world that was populated by the likes of Kansas, The Eagles and
Roxy Music, the Sex Pistols burst onto London's music scene at a time
when the country was mired in garbage strikes, lethally high
unemployment and race riots. The economically drained blue-collar
workers had little else to do than hate the upper class and the Royal
family, especially when wealth was flaunted right in front of their
faces (like seeing the Queen riding around in a gold carriage during her
Silver Jubilee celebration).
Filth is the third documentary about the Pistols, but the first to
really tell their story. Temple's first attempt was 1980's The Great
Rock n' Roll Swindle (the second was a non-Temple film called D.O.A.).
When he began filming Swindle, Temple could never have predicted the
ending  the break-up of the band and the suicide of its enigmatic bass
player, Sid Vicious. Swindle told the story through maniacal manager
Malcolm McLaren's eyes (he even narrated the film). The film premiered
not long after Vicious' death, and the `swindle' in question, at least
according to McLaren, was the bilking of money by record companies, the
mindless youth of England and the actual members of the Pistols  all
from a craze that he pretty much implies that he started on his own.
In Filth (the film's title is taken from one of the many London tabloid
headlines about the Pistols), the story of the band's twenty-six-month
existence is told from the band's perspective. We learn about the
childhood of the band members - some things aren't surprising (broken
homes) and some are (Lydon was in a coma for a year). But it isn't long
before Johnny (Lydon) Rotten, Paul Cook, Steve Jones and Glen Matlock
form the Pistols, and the band took off like a depraved, spitting
rocket, triggering a London politician to say that the band would be
"much improved by sudden death.' Imagine Asa Hutchinson saying something
like that about Limp Bizkit.
Temple's film, while an amazing visual and aural assault, doesn't hit
you over the head with a bunch of silly messages that point out the
obvious. He lets you discover the irony of a band rallying against
conformity, but unwittingly launching a fashion trend where everyone
dressed in similar torn shirts and black leather jackets. He tosses in
animated clips of the band and British television comedies, as well as
snippets of Laurence Olivier playing Richard III. Temple also bathes the
surviving members of the Pistols in shadows during their interview
sessions. It looks like they're in the witness protection program, but
after a while, you don't even notice it. At least not until Rotten/Lydon
starts to get weepy when he talks about Vicious' death.  McLaren is
interviewed, too, but he's wearing a bondage mask. And the only thing
that they can all seem to agree on is that Sid's girlfriend, Nancy
Spungen, was the most despicable person on the face of the Earth (see if
you can watch her and not think about Courtney Love).
Fury also includes all of the famous Pistol-related incidents that many
of you may have only heard about or seen tiny portions of. There's the
Bill Grundy television interview, the Thames performance in honor of Her
Majesty's Silver Jubilee celebration, and the band's final concert,
which consisted of just one song. The film also includes a very touching
post-Pistol breakup interview with Vicious, as well as appearances by
future stars Billy Idol, Siouxsie Sioux and Shane McGowan.

Title
Review for Chuck & Buck (2000)
Plenty of films that have explored the relationship between two
characters that were close friends at a young age only to grown apart as
they entered adulthood, but there's never been anything quite like Chuck
and Buck.  The film plays like a low-budget blend of Rain Man and The
Cable Guy, with a healthy dose of homosexual undertones.  In other
words, it's just the kind of film that will both delight the hearts of
independent film fans and draw the ire of closed-minded politicians
using the `family values' platform to win elections.
Buck (Mike White) is a twenty-seven-year-old Blow Pop addict from
northern California.  To put it simply, Buck is an idiot who hasn't
successfully made the leap from childhood to adulthood.  He does and
says whatever he wants without realizing the consequences.  He'd fit
right in as the third wheel to Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne in the
sequel to Dumb and Dumber.  But Buck is a kind-hearted, innocent boob,
and his character seems real, making him all the more likeable and
sympathetic.
As the films opens, Buck's mom dies (always the sign of a quality
disturbing film), and he sends a letter to his friend Chuck (Chris
Weitz) to let him know the funeral arrangements.  Chuck, who now goes by
the name Charles, moved to Los Angeles after graduation in order to
pursue a job in the music industry (he signed a band that sounds a lot
like They Might Be Giants), and hasn't seen Buck in years.  Thanks to
the funeral the two old friends meet, where it becomes quite obvious
that one has grown up, and one hasn't.
You know something sinister lies ahead when Buck tries to cup Chuck's
package during a post-funeral hug.  Despite the breach in etiquette,
Chuck gives his friend a vague invitation to `come visit sometime,'
before he and his fiancée Carlyn (Beth Colt) hit the road back to the
big city.  Being a simpleton with no living parents, Buck somehow
mistakes the offer for an invitation to go to L.A. and stalk Chuck.
Armed with all of his toys and his vaporizer, he shows up unannounced at
Charles' home and place of business, embarrassing and mortifying the hip
music executive in front of his smarmy new friends and business cohorts.
At first, Chuck painfully grins his way through each encounter, but his
patience is obviously wearing thin.  The more he avoids Buck, the more
psycho Buck becomes, eventually leading the man-child to pen a play that
jumbles The Wizard of Oz with his own life story (it's called `Frank and
Hank').  Things take some strange turns when Buck befriends the actors
who portray the younger and older versions of Chuck.  Buck also gets to
deliver some heart-breakingly honest lines, like `Wanna see my room?'
and `You're house is kind of old person-y.'
The acting in Buck might not be as professional as your used to seeing,
but that's because the majority of the acting talentwell, they have no
acting talent.  White, who wrote Buck, penned the dud Big Man on Campus
and served as a producer on two popular television shows (Freaks and
Geeks and Dawson's Creek).  Weitz co-wrote the script to Nutty Professor
2 and produced the gross-out hit American Pie.  The two have no acting
experience, and it shows.  Even Colt is an acting rookie, landing the
job only after working as a producer/first assistant director on Buck
helmer Miguel Arteta's first film (Star Maps).  Buck was filmed using
handheld digital cameras to add to the film's independent look.
If it seems like Chuck's character looks a hell of a lot like the
character that plays his part in `Hank and Frank,' it's because it's his
real life brother.  Paul Weitz, who also has no acting experience, also
co-wrote Nutty 2 and directed Pie.  As a side note, Chris Weitz looks a
lot like Dharma's Greg, and White shares the same vacant stare of the
lead singer in The Offspring.

Review for Greenfingers (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Greenfingers is not unlike most comedies imported from Great Britain over
the last few years.  It's extremely likeable, short, predictable,
heartwarming and ultimately empty, although you don't realize the latter
until several days later (see Saving Grace, Waking Ned Devine, The Full
Monty, etc.). Most Brit-com success rests entirely on the shoulders of its
stars, and Greenfingers is certainly no different, boasting the
well-respected Helen Mirren and Croupier's Clive Owen.
Greenfingers begins by letting us know the film was "inspired by actual
events," via a 1998 New York Times article called "Free To Grow Bluebells in
England."  Owen plays Colin Briggs, a convicted murderer who has just been
transferred to the minimum-security HMP Edgefield to serve out the tail-end
of a long sentence.  Although Edgefield is a bit more relaxed as far as
prisons go, Colin is still on edge and keeps to himself.  In other words,
he's the opposite of his roommate, Fergus (David Kelly, Waking Ned Devine),
who is elderly, ailing and knows he'll soon die in prison (he killed three
wives).
The story starts to take off when Fergus gives Colin a packet of violet
seeds for Christmas.  Colin begrudgingly plants them into a patch of hard,
barren earth, and is taken aback when the little buggers start to grow. When
the progressive prison warden (Warren Clarke, Blow Dry) sees the lovely
flowers, he decides to let Colin and Fergus start their own horticulture
club.  Their group takes on three additional members: murderers Jimmy
(Paterson Joseph, The Beach) and Raw (Adam Fogerty, Snatch), and armed
robber Tony (Danny Dyer).  The men seem interested in gardening only to
increase their chances of being paroled early.
As Edgefield's first garden begins to take shape, the prisoners attract the
attention of Georgina Woodhouse (Mirren, The Pledge), who is to British
gardening what Ron Jeremy is to pornography.  Georgina is impressed by Colin
and company, and decides to sponsor them in the highly competitive Hampton
Court Palace Flower Show.  Their exposure increases, and Colin even gets a
love interest in Georgina's lovely daughter, the aptly named Primrose
(Natasha Little).
Writer/director Joel Hershman (Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me) does well to
keep viewers interested in the film, but it all comes down to a bunch of
hard-edged prisoners blossoming like little flowers (gag!).  I'm not saying
Greenfingers is bad - it's actually quite entertaining - but there just
isn't much to it.

Title
Review for Cast Away (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2000 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
It's a shame that two of the year's best films were ruined by a
promotional trailer that gave away too much of both stories.  It's an
even bigger shame that both movies were directed by the same person -
Robert Zemeckis.  Is it a coincidence? Beats me.  What is known is that
his previous film, What Lies Beneath, took nearly an hour-and-a-half to
reveal plot points that the trailer showed months before the film was
released. So much for the red herring in that one.
Cast Away offers more of the same shenanigans.  The two-minute preview
shows a plane crashing into the Pacific Ocean and its lone survivor
washing up on the shores of a deserted island.  He has to rough it 
Lord of the Flies style  but eventually makes it home, much to the
surprise of his friends and family, who all assume he died in the crash.
So why would anybody want to venture out into the cold and spend money
to sit in a dark room to watch a film whose ending is no secret?  The
answer is simple  Tom Hanks.  People seem to like the guy an awful lot,
and he acts his ass off in Cast Away, where he plays Chuck Noland, a
slightly puffy Memphis-based Federal Express employee who spends most of
his time on the road training international branches of his company.
Cast Away opens with several scenes that don't seem necessary but play a
vital role in the film's final reel.  The first act sets up Chuck's
hectic life and relationship with girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt, Pay it
Forward).  It's Christmas Day, and Chuck gets a page to jet off to
Tahiti, postponing a planned proposal to Kelly until New Year's Eve.
"I'll be right back," he tells her, but we all know better.
The plane crash is as intense as anything you've seen lately, especially
if you've been watching election coverage on CNN.  Because Chuck's pilot
flew 200 miles off course to avoid a storm (which also conveniently left
the craft unable to make radio contact with the ground), any search
efforts made won't be anywhere near his new island home.
On the island, Chuck has to abandon his "live and die by the clock"
lifestyle in favor of finding things like food, water and shelter.
Before long, he's doing fire dances, painting on cave walls and
searching the sky for clues about the tide, just like our
knuckle-dragging, monosyllabic forefathers (and I don't mean the Bush
family).  This isn't your typical Hollywood deserted island, either.
There are no drug farmers (like The Beach), no headhunters (like
Gilligan's Island) and no naked fat guys (like ... you know).
Chuck is kept alive by the contents of several packages from the FedEx
crash that wash up on the shore of his island, one of which provides the
castaway his only friend and confidant - a volleyball he calls "Wilson"
(which I'd have eaten - leather is as close to steak as you'd get on a
deserted island).  This middle part of Cast Away is over an hour long
and features no music and very little dialogue (the least in a film this
length since The Thin Red Line).  It's all Hanks, and he does a very
admirable job.
Zemeckis pulls off his best directorial effort yet, and that's quite a
statement considering the films he already has under his belt.  He mixes
in a bunch of the long tracking shots that we've come to expect, and the
transitions between his scenes are typically amazing, but the director
makes his greatest contribution to Cast Away by leaving important pieces
of the story out of the film.  Scenes that you expect to see are
missing, but he's a strong enough storyteller to fill in the blanks in
other ways.  He even mounts a camera to a FedEx package to show its
delivery journey.  Now, if we can just get somebody to edit Zemeckis'
trailers a little more carefully, he'll be in business.
Hanks may also have reached his career zenith with his performance in
Cast Away.  After all, not just any actor can carry a film with this
little action and dialogue.  Much has been made of Hanks' weight gain
and loss for the film (it was filmed in two segments so he could lose
several dozen pounds), but his physical appearance takes a backseat to
his acting, which is quite smashing considering his costar was a
volleyball.  If you put Joaquin Phoenix on an island with only a round
piece of leather, nothing remotely exciting would happen.
And what's with poor Helen Hunt?  She was in one of the biggest
blockbusters ever (Twister) and won an Oscar (As Good as it Gets) while
she appeared on television's Mad About You.  Since abandoning the sitcom
(which she did, presumably, to make films), she's spun her wheels with
strong performances in shaky projects like Dr. T and the Women and
Forward.  Now, Hunt has finally found a film to match her acting
ability, and she's barely in it.

Review for Bruiser (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
George A. Romero, the writer/director credited with ushering in the
modern horror film era with 1968's Night of the Living Dead, brings his
latest film to Rochester this Saturday as part of the Dryden Theater's
continuous `Visiting Filmmaker' series. Bruiser, full of Romero's
trademark humor and lower-than-low budget for acting talent, is an
interesting but gimmicky parable that is more remarkable for its
similarity to two recent films than anything else.
Jason Flemyng (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) plays Henry
Creedlow, an employee of a men's magazine called `Bruiser.' Despite
having a somewhat successful career, a hot wife and a giant, newly
constructed home, Henry is Joe Vanilla  one of those guys you never
notice because he doesn't have a smidgen of character (kind of like the
straight white guys on the last few seasons of The Real World). He's
practically invisible and lacks the backbone to stand up to anybody who
gets in his face or questions his opinions.
And, like anyone who lets people wipe their feet on his back, Henry's
life is full of people who take advantage of him. His wife, Janine,
(Nina Garbiras, The $treet) is unfaithful and keeps her thumb on Henry's
money. His best friend Jimmy (Andrew Tarbet) is a financial advisor who
is robbing Henry blind. Even his housekeeper gets in on the action,
pilfering money from Henry's wallet when she thinks he isn't looking.
And, worst of all, his bigoted, ass-grabbing, cock-waggling boss (Peter
Stormare, Chocolat) belittles Henry in front of his colleagues and seems
a little too familiar with Janine.
We can tell Henry is close to some kind of breaking point from his
homicidal/suicidal fantasies (the highlight of the film) that begin with
his repetitive morning bathroom and workout ritual (like American
Psycho). Waking up to discover his face has become white and featureless
is the last straw, and you know what that means, don't you? No more Mr.
Nice Guy.
Henry spends the rest of the film righting all of the wrongs that he
feels have, literally, stolen his identity. Like Kevin Bacon in Hollow
Man, Henry dons a hat, sunglasses and flesh-colored makeup to walk the
streets unnoticed, leading to the big masquerade party finale, which is
as anticlimactic as most of the film's revenge killings. As an added
bonus, The Misfits play three songs, including one called `Bruiser,'
written for this film, at the over-the-top party climax.
Speaking of over-the-top, that's just what Stormare is in his role. His
accent seems to change from Russian to Irish from line to line, no doubt
distracted by the stress of chewing up the scenery every time the camera
focuses on him. When he gets his at the end, it's a huge letdown,
considering how despicable the character was. Other disappointments
include the failure to use a dangerous table saw as an implement of
destruction, and the fact that Janine's annoying poodle doesn't meet the
grisly fate it deserves.
Other than Stormare and Garbiras, who gets naked a bunch of times, the
rest of the actors are as bland as Henry's character is supposed to be.
But Romero fans will likely be hooting and hollering from the opening
scene, right through the odd cover of A-Ha's `Take on Me' that plays
during the closing credits.

Review for Bounce (2000)
Everybody is making such a big deal about Ben Affleck, Gwyneth Paltrow
and their highly publicized `are they or aren't they' relationship.  I
couldn't give a rat's ass what any Hollywood star does with their
personal life (unless it actually involves a rat's ass), but even I have
to take my hat off to Affleck and Paltrow for their performances in
Bounce, the new three-hankie chick-flick starring the
former/current/future real-life couple.  I don't know if their
off-screen relationship has anything to do with it, but their chemistry
in Bounce is terrific.  The Oscar-winning duo seem so comfortable in
their roles that it doesn't appear that either is acting.
Affleck (Reindeer Games) stars as Buddy Amaral, a smooth-talking
advertising salesman who appears to be an extension of Affleck's Jim
Young from Boiler Room.  As the film opens, he has just landed the Big
Account but finds himself stranded at Chicago's O'Hare Airport due to a
snowstorm.  He meets a married father of two from Los Angeles named Greg
Janello (Tony Goldwyn, Kiss the Girls).  Buddy has a boarding pass for
the next flight to L.A. but gives it to Greg so he can make it home for
his son's Cub Scouts Christmas tree sale the following day.
Greg's plane ends up crashing, killing all 216 people onboard.  His
wife, Abby (Paltrow, Duets), assumes Greg is okay, since he wasn't
supposed to be on that particular flight.  Eventually she gets
confirmation that her husband is dead, leaving her two sons fatherless.
Without seeing a dime from a class-action suit against the airline, Abby
makes ends meet as a struggling commercial real estate agent.
In the meantime, Buddy goes on a one-year bender.  It's hard to tell if
he's just freaked out from narrowly escaping death or if he's bothered
by indirectly killing a nice guy with two little kids (the character
doesn't even acknowledge the latter scenario).  As part of his alcohol
rehab, he's forced to take that dreaded eighth step, where you're
supposed to make amends with all the people you hurt as a drunk.  He
finds Abby, pretends to be a complete stranger, and hooks her up with a
peach of a real estate transaction.  Buddy only means his atonement to
be financial, but he ends up falling for Abby when she orders a grilled
cheese sandwich at a diner after the big closing.
The rest of the film shows the budding relationship between Buddy and
Abby, but as a viewer, you know it's only a matter of time before she
finds out about the boarding pass swap that left her a widow.  It's
obvious that Buddy really wants to be honest with Abby but knows the
truth will crush her.  The further he gets into the relationship, the
worse his secret becomes.  He's the first person who has been nice to
her without knowing she's a widow  except he really does, but has to
pretend he doesn't.
Bounce's ending is kind of a cop-out, compared to the quality of the
rest of the script.  I won't go into why here, as it could ruin the
ending, but it seems like it could have been mistakenly inserted from a
completely different film.  Admittedly, it's different than what you'd
expect from a typical chick-flick, but it still doesn't work.
As I mentioned earlier, the acting in Bounce is fabulous.  The smart
script and direction (from The Opposite of Sex's Don Roos) is also much
better than average.  Both of Roos' main characters are more flawed than
we're used to seeing on the screen, and the flaws aren't your typical
Hollywood defects.  Roos doesn't hit you over the head with emotional
stuff, either.  You don't see the plane crash, and the scene where Abby
learns that her husband was on the flight is surprisingly tasteful,
while most other films would have exploited both of these scenarios.
Credit Atom Egoyan regular Mychael Danna for keeping his score in check
throughout the film.

Review for 1732 Hřtten - marerittet har et postnummer (1998)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Some of the creepiest psychological studies of the last few years have come
from Scandinavia. Bloody Angels tries to duplicate the eeriness of its
Norwegian predecessors, Insomnia and Junk Mail. Though those shoes may be
tough to fill, Angels is still a bitter disappointment.
Angels takes place in a tiny rural town where, several months prior to the
film's opening, a young girl with Down's syndrome was brutally raped and
murdered (shades of Paradise Lost?). The townsfolk believe that the killers
are the two oldest sons of the most despised family in the bleak burg and,
as the film opens, one of the alleged attackers is found dead in an icy
river. His accomplice brother is missing, but nobody in the town will own up
to the obvious retaliation.
Enter an Oslo detective named Nicholas Ramm (Reidar Sřrensen), an old friend
of the stymied local sheriff. Ramm gives new meaning to the term
`no-nonsense cop,' instantly butting heads with the locals, who insist that
they saw `bloody angels' descend from heaven and do the deed. Hoping to
unravel the mystery, Ramm befriends the tormented younger brother of the
suspects (Gaute Skjegstad), which makes everybody in town hate him even
more. Is it really heavenly intervention, or mob justice? Duh - what do you
think?
The directorial debut of Karin Julsrud, Angels isn't totally wasted. The
music is downright hair-raising and the cinematography is great, creating a
drab, washed-out look. The weak story (Finn Gjerdrum and Kjetil Indregard)
by is the real problem here, and the ending should be particularly
predictable to anyone that has seen a Pearl Jam video.

Review for Plunkett & Macleane (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
A gorgeous-looking but uneven twist on Robin Hood, Plunkett & Macleane
reunites two Trainspotting stars as criminals that rob from the rich,
but keep the wealth for themselves rather than passing it along to the
poor. The promising directorial debut from music video director Jake
Scott brings to mind Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet  another pic that
modernized (to an extent) a period piece. The script is a bit of a mess,
but the film's astonishing look is more than enough to offset any story
problems.
Set in 1748 London, the film opens with Captain James Macleane (Jonny
Lee Miller, Hackers) en route to debtor's prison. His stagecoach crashes
with another and, while crouching in the darkness, Macleane witnesses
two shadowy figures rob the passengers. One crook swallows a giant red
jewel after being shot by the approaching authorities. As he lies there
slowly dying, the lawmen press his wound in an attempt to procure the
name of his accomplice. The wounded criminal doesn't finger his friend
and Macleane watches as he is put out of his misery.
Several days later, the on-the-lam Macleane watches the outlaw's funeral
from a distance and returns that night to dig up the body and fish the
jewel out of the cadaver. But his grave-robbing is interrupted by the
dead man's partner, who has returned to lay claim to the jewel. His name
is Plunkett (Robert Carlyle, Ravenous) and, with his gun to Macleane's
head, Plunkett makes him delve into the corpse's innards in a very
disgusting-looking and sounding scene. They eventually surrender as
authorities surround them and Plunkett swallows the oft-eaten jewel for
safe keeping.
In New Gate Prison, we discover that Macleane is formerly of wealth but
ended up in tattered clothes because of monstrous gambling debts.
Plunkett approaches him with a plan  use the jewel to buy their way out
of the clink and, once freed, join forces to rob the rich. Macleane
agrees, but the two must wait until Plunkett passes their bauble, which
eventually hits the metal pan with a satisfying "clang."
The plan includes reestablishing Macleane as a "gentleman" in local
society as he stakes out the ritziest parties in town in an attempt to
learn the most vulnerable rich folk to rob. He loses money gambling at
these parties only to promise "I'll get ii back," which he does  and
then some  as he and Plunkett hijack the mark's stagecoach on the way
home. Macleane will even go so far as to copulate with disgusting
richies and at one point gets a bad case of "the pox," an early venereal
disease. Later, the men disrupt the heifer's wedding, robbing its
opulent guests during a fantastic fireworks display in this
great-looking scene.
As their escapades continue, their notoriety rises, as well as their
reward for capture. Plunkett and Macleane even knock over an important
figurehead in local government, who happens to be escorting his lovely
young niece (Liv Tyler, Cookie's Fortune) for whom Macleane fall. Of
interesting note, this is Tyler's second period piece that features
characters drawing at ten paces. The other is the upcoming Ralph Fiennes
film Onegin.
The picture's modern twist includes piercing, prominent cursing,
widespread gambling and the use of modern music, which is a bit
distracting at first, but as the film continues you realize that it's
better than the typical harpsichord crap that would ordinarily accompany
a frocky period piece like this. Critics will probably laugh this film
off, but its fantastic looks  especially the nighttime robbery scenes 
appear to be equal to that of the upcoming Sleepy Hollow (at least from
what I've seen from the trailer). The hodgepodge script comes from five
writers and the movie was filmed in three locations - London, Prague and
Spain.

Review for Wonderland (1999/I)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
After Jude and Welcome to Sarajevo, a person might have certain
preconceptions about director Michael Winterbottom.  To call them both
both dark films is a bit of an understatement.  I was actually smacked
in the head after letting a female co-worker borrower my copy of Jude.
All of this makes Winterbottom's latest - Wonderland - even more of a
surprise.  And when I say `surprise,' I don't mean it in a good way.
An unwelcome change of pace for Winterbottom, Wonderland follows three
generations of a South London family through a tumultuous November
weekend.  Each family member has their own story line, and they
frequently intersect with each other.  Their stories are almost all
boring, particularly coming on the heels of Paul Thomas Anderson's far
superior film Magnolia.  In fact, Wonderland will really make you
appreciate how good Magnolia was, even for you dicks that walked out
after the first hour.
It's not all bad.  The acting is solid, showing that Winterbottom is, if
nothing else, routinely capable of eliciting great performances from his
casts.  The problem is with the script, written by debut screenwriter
Laurence Coriat.  Winterbottom's two previous gems were adapted from
novels (Jude from Thomas Hardy's `Jude the Obscure' and Sarajevo from
Michael Nicholson's `Natasha's Story').  Dude, find some more messed-up
books and direct them instead of stories from first-time writers.
Mum - Eileen (Kika Markham) hates her husband Bill (Jack Shepherd),
constantly badgering him and calling him `pathetic.'  Their relationship
started to crumble when their youngest child and only son ran away from
home, apparently so he could have sex with his girlfriend.  Oh, yeah 
Bill seems to have a thing for his black neighbor, as well.  Eileen and
Bill also spawned three daughters, including:
Debbie (Shirley Henderson, Topsy-Turvy), a divorced hairdresser (with
bad hair, no less) that loves penis almost as much as her only child,
eleven-year-old soccer fan Jack (Peter Marfleet).  Her ex-husband Dan
(Ian Hart, The End of the Affair) is an irresponsible lout.
Molly (Molly Parker, Dean Koontz's Intensity) is about to have her first
child and is happily married to a kitchen remodeling salesman named
Eddie (John Simm, Cracker), who hates his job, wants to quit and doesn't
so much want a wife or kid.
Nadia (Gina McKee, Notting Hill) a gangly waitress that hopelessly looks
for love in the personal ads, but has yet to manage a third date with
any of them.
Did I miss something here?  Did Winterbottom wake up and find a vagina
between his legs?  Although I don't have an inherent problem with
chick-flicks, I do have a problem with a guy that's made two strong,
masculine films making a wimpy flick where all of the male characters
are deplorable.  The women in Wonderland aren't much better than the
men, but it is definitely told from a female perspective.  On the plus
side, each character is miserable in their own way.  The only person
that seems remotely happy is little Jack when he sneaks out of his house
to go to the Bonfire Night festival, but then he gets mugged.
Just to keep things interesting, Winterbottom employed several kooky
techniques to Wonderland.  He used only hand-held cameras and hidden
microphones.  There were no extras, no lights and no clapperboard was
used during filming.  Winterbottom also chose to use 16mm film, which
was later blown up to 35mm.  The result, as you can imagine, is very
grainy and looks a bit like a documentary.  While attempting a sort of
cinematic freedom, Winterbottom readily denies the fact that he tried to
copy the Dogme aesthetic.  In fact, Wonderland was in pre-production
when the first two Dogme films (The Celebration and The Idiots) screened
at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, where the director sat on the jury.
But despite not trying to achieve results like his Danish counterparts,
the hospital scenes at the end of Wonderland look very Kingdom-esque.

Review for General's Daughter, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
You just can't shake the `been there, done that' feeling while sitting
through director Simon West's ConAir follow-up.  It plays like a
second-rate version of Rob Reiner's multiple Oscar nominee A Few Good
Men, driving home the tired cliché that there are three ways to do
things  the right way, the wrong way and the Army way.  File this one
under Choice No. 2.
Based on the popular Nelson DeMille novel, Daughter takes place at Fort
MacCallum in Georgia.  Warrant Officers Paul Brenner (John Travolta, A
Civil Action) and Sara Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe, Playing by Heart) are
assigned to investigate the murder of  you guessed it  the General's
daughter, Captain Elizabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson, Flubber).  Her
naked body was found strangled, tied down and spread-eagle on the base
during evening maneuvers.
The General is "Fighting' Joe Campbell (James Cromwell, Babe), a
retiring leader with major political ambitions.  He needs to have the
murder case sewn up in 36 hours, before the Feds come in and leak the
story to the media, spoiling his shot to run on the next Republican
Presidential ticket.  Campbell actually utters the words `just find the
son of a bitch' to Brenner.  And he gets to rhetorically ask Brenner the
tried-and-true question of whether he is a soldier or a policeman.
Brenner and Sunhill's investigation leads them to a secret room in the
basement of the deceased Campbell's home, learning that she was quite
the sexual deviant in her spare time.  Confirmation of Campbell's
extra-curricular activities arrives via Colonels Kent (Timothy Hutton,
Playing God) and Moore (James Woods, Another Day in Paradise).  The
latter, Campbell's boss and mentor, is initially accused and arrested by
Brenner, but later freed in a fatal mistake.
Daughter is kept alive only by Travolta's electric performance and
occasionally saucy one-liners.  The shallow adaptation by debut
screenwriter Christopher Bertolini is a dud, despite being `punched up'
by veteran scribe William Goldman (Absolute Power).  Sadly, Goldman is
probably best know these days as the guy who annually writes the
scathing reviews of each Oscar-nominated film in Premiere magazine.
Goldman completely annihilated Saving Private Ryan this year, but then
turns around and gives us crap like this.  Thanks a lot, pal.  (1:58 - R

Review for Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Attention, all gay Jewish cannibals!  Are you tired of Hollywood's
stereotypical portrayal of your unique lifestyle?  Then David and Laurie
Shapiro have just the film for you.  It's called Keep the River on Your
Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale, and it just happens to be one of the best and
most intriguing documentaries to hit the screen in quite some time.
River, which just won the Independent Spirit "Truer Than Fiction" Award and
has taken home trophies from just about every film festival it has played,
chooses 76-year-old Tobias Schneebaum as its subject.  He seems like a
typical old man ravaged by time, hobbling around New York City with an
artificial hip and Parkinson's Disease, but Schneebaum can tell tales that
would make the toughest sailor whimper.
Schneebaum was a promising young painter who, in the '50s, received a
Fulbright scholarship to study Peruvian art.  He disappeared into the woods
and, like Michael Rockefeller, was presumed to have been killed and eaten by
one of the country's headhunting tribes.  But months later, Schneebaum
emerged from the jungle covered in paint and full of stories about taking
part in both bloody tribal battles and cannibalistic acts. Needless to say,
Schneebaum shocked the talk show circuit (clips of Charlie Rose and Mike
Douglas are included, and quite funny) with his gruesome tales about
indulging in the other other white meat, as well as his participation in
numerous homosexual acts.
Schneebaum was never quite the same since "the Peruvian experience," which
made him give up painting (he still draws) and abandon any future excursions
to the country.  But filmmakers David and Laurie Shapiro were somehow able
to talk him into returning to his old chomping grounds, where he chews the
fat with some of his old buddies, who have long since abandoned their
cannibalistic ways, human auctions and nudist lifestyle (proving there is
little difference between the words "nudist" and "nutso").  It may just be
me, but a tribe of ex-headhunters puts me at ease as much as a country full
of ex-Nazis.
It's difficult to believe, but Schneebaum's trip back to Peru isn't even the
best part of the film.  Before heading to South America, the Shapiros and
their delicate subject visit Asmat, New Guinea, where Schneebaum lived for
several years (River's title comes from a book he wrote about Asmat) and
practiced gay aboriginal polygamy.  We also get plenty of background on
Schneebaum, watching him educate rich, white cruise-ship patrons about
Indonesian art and anthropology, as well as fielding the inevitable "How do
people taste?" questions from a group of students on a field trip to a
Manhattan museum.
We also see some pretty amazing sights, too - not the pedestrian Travel
Channel stuff, but off-the-beaten-path things like mass ceremonial
circumcisions and the beautiful ruins of Machu Picchu (and the even more
magnificent view attendant thereto).  But most amazing of all is Schneebaum,
who will make you think twice about the mild-mannered old man sitting next
to you on the bus. The only thing that might have made this more interesting
is if it was directed by Errol Morris.  But the Shapiros (brother and
sister) do a strong enough job telling Schneebaum's story to make up for the
stylistic shortcomings.

Title
Review for Double Jeopardy (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
A rather unimaginative thriller  considering that the title gives away
the film's already predictable ending  about a woman (Ashley Judd,
Simon Birch) accused of murdering her husband, only to find out that the
two-timing schmuck is still alive while she rots away in the clink.
Like the titular legal loophole, Judd learns that she can get out of
prison and legally kill her spouse and not be convicted because a person
can't be accused of committing the same crime twice.
Judd plays Elizabeth Parsons, a seemingly happily married co-owner of a
child-care center in the Pacific northwest.  For Elizabeth's birthday,
her husband Nick (Bruce Greenwood, Disturbing Behavior) rents the
loveliest boat in the area and takes her out for a night of sailing and
passion - you even get to see one of her Judds and the crack of her
Ashley.  But when Elizabeth wakes up at dawn, she finds a bloody trail
that rivals even O.J.'s  and can't find her husband anywhere
(unbeknownst to her, he is experiencing financial difficulties at work
and just took out a huge insurance policy).  Acting like a person who is
about to be framed, Elizabeth picks up the bloody murder weapon on the
ship's deck just as the Coast Guard swoops in and hauls her off.
Long story short, Elizabeth ends up in prison with a lengthy sentence,
where she celebrates her kid's birthdays without him.  I've got to tell
you that this is the least frightening penitentiary that I have seen
since GoodFellas.  It's almost like a resort.  After the obligatory
prison-workout-while-plotting-revenge scene, Elizabeth is given a
conditional release to serve her remaining three years on probation and
living in a halfway house.
Elizabeth, who hasn't aged or changed her hairstyle during her six-year
absence, immediately starts to track down her ex, who has apparently run
off with their son and his new wife Angela (Annabeth Gish, S.L.C. Punk),
who was formerly Elizabeth's best friend.  Dedicated to her search,
Elizabeth misses curfew, breaks into her old office and almost eludes
the police during a thrilling beach chase.
Enter Parole Officer Travis Layman (Tommy Lee Jones, U.S. Marshals), who
staggers unpurposefully about as if he were trying to hunt down Harrison
Ford but his heart isn't really in it.  Do guys who win Best Supporting
Actor Oscars all think that they can call in performances in crappy
films for the rest of their lives?  Let me answer my own question by
saying Chill Factor (Cuba), Patch Adams (Robin) and Men in Black
(Tommy).  Thank God for Kevin Spacey.
For a few seconds, it almost seemed like there was going to be a cool
twist at the end, but then the film resumed its course toward the
inevitably mediocre ending that you know is coming.  Jeopardy was
directed by Bruce Beresford (Paradise Road) and written by Robert Benton
(Twilight), who penned the story created by two co-writers from The Rock
(Douglas Cook and David Weisberg).  My question is `Why bother?'
Imagine Citizen Kane being called Rosebud the Sled and you get the
idea.  (1:43 - R for language, brief nudity and some violence)

Title
Review for Last Castle, The (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
People looking for escapist fun at the theatre may be polarized by Rod
Lurie's The Last Castle.  While it doesn't deal with terrorism and isn't set
in New York City, the film does feature a scene where a helicopter is
hijacked and used to plow into a building in order to kill a guy who's just
doing his job.  And that's not even counting the patriotic, flag-waving
(literally) finale.
In the film, Robert Redford (The Horse Whisperer) plays a three-star U.S.
Army General named Irwin, who, after pleading guilty to a crime, is shipped
off to a maximum-security military prison run by Colonel Winter (James
Gandolfini, The Mexican).  Although we don't know anything about his
background, it is assumed Irwin is some kind of military hero, on account of
Winter being all geeked up about his impending arrival.  The other inmates
don't feel quite the same way, as some place bets with the prison bookie
(Mark Ruffalo, You Can Count on Me) about potential suicide attempts.
The two men butt heads almost immediately, launching a
who's-got-a-bigger-cock battle for control of the prison (it's called The
Castle, by the way).  Winter has fun using the inmates as pawns and watches
it all from a big third-story window like a kid with an ant farm, while
Irwin quickly earns the respect of his peers in a very silly scene that
involves moving a large pile of heavy rocks (it probably should have been
set to Aretha Franklin's "Respect").  Winter looks down from on high,
proudly declaring, "He's playing soldier," as he surveys Irwin from an
office filled with shiny war toys he has collected over his combat-free
career. How's that for subtle?
We slowly begin to learn things about Irwin (he was both a bad father and a
POW), but as Castle approaches the 70-minute mark, there are still two huge
questions left hanging in the air:  What crime did he commit, and where the
hell is Delroy Lindo?  But the background of his character barely matters
when he's so busy questioning and undermining Winter's authority.  Like the
song goes, Irwin wants to accentuate the positive when it comes to these
incarcerated soldiers, while Winter would rather dwell on the negatives in
their lives, like the times they committed murder and assault and stuff.
It's hard to say whether Irwin is doing it all for one last battlefield
victory, or out of sheer boredom, or because he has a legitimate beef with
Winter and his managerial style.
Castle was directed by former film critic Rod Lurie (The Contender), and
while his casts keep getting bigger and better, this is his first picture to
be penned by someone else.  Unfortunately, that "someone else" is David
Scarpa and Graham Yost, the latter of whom has churned out a whole lot of
crap (Mission to Mars, Hard Rain) since hitting pay dirt with Speed a decade
ago.  Their story is as far-fetched as anything you'll see on the screen
this year, and is worsened by their decision to make hardened criminals into
something resembling the football players in Remember the Titans.  I've got
a problem with prison pictures that are, essentially, about a guy who isn't
supposed to be there (which is why Oz is so frigging great), but making
every single murderer and rapist into a sympathetic character is going way
too far.

Title
Review for Suicide Kings (1997)
With its cast of up-and-coming non A-list stars, Suicide Kings
profoundly succeeds where other all-boy ensemble casts (like The Newton
Boys) generally fail.  It is a wickedly dark comedy that revolves around
dual kidnappings, one the daughter of a wealthy New York family and the
other of an ex-Mafia boss.
The first abduction is of Lisa Chasten (Laura R. Harris), who is scooped
up whilst in the throes of parking lot passion with her secret boyfriend
and doctor wannabe, Max Minot (Jeremy Sisto, Clueless).  Max is the only
witness to the crime, but can offer precious few details.
Although he is affluent beyond my wildest dreams, Lisa's father can't
get his hands on the two million-dollar ransom and misses the first
payoff deadline.  Then, one of Lisa's digits is delivered, so the
picture shifts to a backup plan.
It seems that Lisa's brother Avery (Henry Thomas, Niagara, Niagara)
decides to befriend and kidnap Charles Barrett (Christopher Walken, The
Prophecy).  Why Charles Barrett?  Well, here's one clue  his name used
to be Carlo Bertolucci.  Charles decided to change it when he retired as
the head of the New York crime family syndicate, on the road to the
straight and narrow.
Avery, Max and their bratty socialite schoolmates, Brett (Jay Mohr,
Jerry Maguire) and T.K. (Sean Patrick Flannery, Powder) figure if they
can get Charles attention, he can help locate Lisa's captors and quickly
resolve the whole incident.  They befriend him at his daily dinner digs,
convince him to take a little car ride through his `old neighborhood'
and hit him with the chloroform once the trip begins.
Dragging him back to a summer home of the Chasten family, the rich kids
demand assistance from the drugged Charles.  Enter comic relief from
geeky worrywart Ira (Johnny Galecki, Roseanne) and shoe fetishist Lono
Vecchio (Denis Leary, The Ref) and that's when real fun begins.
Suicide Kings is wryly written by Wayne Rice and Gina Goldman, the
latter a producer of the television series The Wonder Years.  It is the
feature film debut of Peter O'Fallon, an Emmy award winning director
best known for his work on such shows as Northern Exposure,
thirtysomething and Party of Five.  His stylish and highly entertaining
filming can only lead one to hope that frigging television naysayers
will shut the hell up about my second favorite medium.

Title
Review for Sphere (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
It sounded too good on paper.  One of my favorite directors, Barry
Levinson (Wag the Dog), re-teaming with one of my favorite writers, Paul
Attanasio (Quiz Show), to adapt a book by one of my favorite authors,
Michael Crichton (AirFrame).  They pulled it off with Disclosure and its
A-list stars, so why couldn'tno, why SHOULDN'T they be able to do it
again?
Well, I imagine the main reason is that the story is no good.  I never
read Sphere, but have it on good authority that it kinda sucked rocks.
Levinson and Attanasio probably polished this turd as well as they
could, and the end product is a dull rip-off of the superior films in
its genre.
One should have become suspicious when Levinson ordered the actors back
to shoot additional footage less than three weeks before the scheduled
release date.  I guess the reactions from the test screenings made the
executives at Warner Bros. a little antsy.  Who could blame them?  WB's
latest crop of box office bombs include The Postman, Mad City, The Man
Who Knew Too Little, Steel, Free Willy 3 and Fire Down Below.  By Jobe,
there should be people jumping out of windows!
Sphere opens with four `experts', a bio-chemist (Sharon Stone), a
mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), an astrophysicist (fat head Liev
Schreiber) and a shrink (Hoffman) joining a military leader (Peter
Coyote) to explore what is believed to be an ancient alien craft buried
beneath the floor of the Pacific Ocean.  Throw in rap star Queen Latifah
and performance artist Marga Gomez, and you've got yourself an eerie
preview of the next season of MTV's The Real World.  Seven strangers
picked to live in a submarine
After it kills off all of the people that don't receive billing above
its title, Sphere proceeds to `borrow' ideas from Alien, 2001, The
Thing, The Abyss and probably a bunch of other groundbreaking films that
I was too bored to notice.  Want to see a much better sci-fi film about
strangers unwillingly thrown together in a confined space?  Wait for
Cube, which will hopefully be released later this year.  Its budget was
about 2% of Sphere.  Literally.
The thing that is supposed to separate Sphere from silly films like Deep
Rising and Anaconda is that there really isn't a giant snake or angry
octopus to do battle with.  The real enemy is the imagination of the
characters.  Personally, I would have used my imagination to create a
world where I was the slave master and my harem included the entire
lineup of those Cover Girl commercials.  Instead, the characters
predictably and boringly turn against each other in individual fits of
distrust.
Levinson displays similar editing techniques to Homicide: Life on the
Streets by quickly replaying the actors dialogue from several different
camera angles.  He also lays the film out in titled chapters, which will
make it easy to `pause' and `pee' when you're watching the video, or to
get up and sneak out of the theater.

Title
Review for Mickey Blue Eyes (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Solidifying 1999 as the Year of the Mob Comedy, Mickey Blue Eyes is not
quite as well-structured as this spring's Analyze This, or as
substantial as HBO's much-lauded series The Sopranos.  But it is full of
several charming performances and very entertaining, nonetheless.
Hugh Grant (Notting Hill) stars as Michael Felgate, a British art
auctioneer at a New York City Sotheby's clone.  Despite not having yet
met the family of his girlfriend Gina (played by Jeanne Tripplehorn,
Very Bad Things), Michael decides to propose after only three months of
courting.  He pops the question via doctored fortune cookie and is
shocked when Gina gets up and flees the Chinese restaurant in tears
immediately following the proposal.  (Not to quibble, but Gina and
Michael had reservations at a finer bistro and didn't make it on time to
keep them - so where did he get the fortune cookie message?)
Thinking that she may have gone to her father's restaurant, Michael
heads to The La Trattoria (meaning, literally, `the the restaurant') and
meets Gina's father, Frank Vitali (James Caan, This is My Father), as
well as a myriad of other shady Sicilian characters.  Although everyone
hits it off nicely, Michael becomes a bit suspicious when he stumbles
upon a frosty gentleman in the freezer while trying to find the
bathroom.  He is also able to track down Gina in the bedroom of her
childhood home  complete with Duran Duran poster  where she explains
that her fear is that her connected family members will somehow corrupt
her honest and naďve man.
Gina has good reason to worry.  The next day Michael's art deliveries
are early for the first time ever, thanks to freshly rejuvenated
Teamster drivers.  He thinks nothing of it until Frank suggests that
Michael help auction the painting of the son of his mob boss (played by
Burt Young, Rocky).  The picture depicts Jesus wielding an automatic
rifle while executing what appears to be a mob-like hit.  At that
evening's auction, the painting is sold for $50,000 to someone
resembling the man in The La Trattoria's freezer.  Within twelve hours,
the FBI is questioning Michael for money laundering.
Sadly, Mickey follows the trend of current films by revealing most of
its funny moments in the trailer  especially when Frank tries to teach
Michael to drop the stuffy British accent to become Kansas City Little
Big Mickey Blue Eyes, a hard-ass Italian gangster. A talking stuffed
gorilla has some of the film's best lines, and Burt Young can elicit
laughs just from peering out from behind his super-thick Harry Caray
glasses.
Mickey's less-than-stellar production pedigree makes the film even more
surprisingly enjoyable.  Writers Adam Scheinman (Little Big League) and
Robert Kuhn (The Cure) have crafted a nifty little script that, frankly,
could have used a little less of the romantic plot and a lot more
cursing.  Director Kelly Makin (Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy) packed
the cast with alumni of Analyze This, The Sopranos and HBO's other
fantastic drama series OZ, as well as Kids cast member Scott Thompson.
Caan is wonderful as Frank, and it is truly a joy to watch Grant's
Michael abandon his sheepish, puppy-dog schtick while breaking dozens of
laws trying to cover his own tail.  Unfortunately, Joe Viterelli (the
scene-stealing Jelly from Analyze This) is completely underused in his
role.  For that, we will have to wait for the sequel, Analyze
ThisAgain.  (1:42 - PG-13 for some adult language, mild violence and
slight sexual content)

Title
Review for O (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The title is enough to strike fear into the hearts of the testosterone-laden
around the world.  But don't worry - O isn't Oprah's big move from making
crappy books into crappy films (that's already happened with Where the Heart
Is).  It's a modernization of Shakespeare's Othello set at a Charleston,
South Carolina prep school, and despite the heavy baggage it lugs into
theatres, O is a pretty decent flick.
That baggage, in case you've been living under a rock, is the film's violent
content and target audience, which caused the original distributor to push
back targeted release dates for two years before dumping it off onto a
smaller, gutsier company.  You're probably thinking O is one violent
sumbitch, but it isn't - the film simply had the misfortune of being
scheduled for release around the same time as Colombine, and since it's
about high school students and murder, and stars actors popular with the
under-17 crowd, people got freaked out.
Unlike Baz Luhrmann's updating of Romeo + Juliet, this film doesn't keep the
Bard's dialogue intact, which will be welcome to some and considered a
tragedy to others.  The action takes place at Palmetto Groves, a private
school home to a successful basketball program run by Coach Duke Goulding
(Martin Sheen, Apocalypse Now Redux), which means the Duke of Venice's court
has been transformed into a basketball court.  The Hawks are headed to the
state tournament, thanks to the prowess of senior Odin James (Mekhi Phifer,
Shaft).
The film begins at a pep rally for the team in which Coach Duke presents
Odin the team MVP award after emotionally confessing that he loves his
high-scoring threat like a son.  Not the kind of thing you want to hear when
you're the Coach's real son, like Hugo (Josh Hartnett, Pearl Harbor).  To
make matters worse, when Odin is handed the trophy, he calls down sophomore
Michael Cassio (Andrew Keegan, 10 Things I Hate About You) to accept the
award with him.  Why, it's almost enough to set somebody off on a murderous
rampage, isn't it?
Most of the elements of Shakespeare's play are here, including Odin's
girlfriend, Desi (Julia Stiles, Save the Last Dance), who also happens to be
the daughter of Palmetto Grove's Dean, who is named Brable instead of
Brabantio (John Heard, Pollock).  Hugo has a pawn in Roger (Elden Henson,
The Mighty), and Desi's friend Emily (Rain Phoenix) gets wise to the whole
thing before anybody else.  The only thing surprising here, at least when it
comes to the story, is that Hugo and Desi share very few scenes together,
and it's never clear whether he wants her for his own or not (it sure
doesn't seem like he does).  O isn't as heavy on the race stuff as I had
expected, either, even though Odin is a real fly in the buttermilk as the
only black student at Palmetto Grove.
Hartnett really shines as the oft-overlooked Hugo, who is one of the most
likable, admirable antagonists to hit the screen in a while.  As he plants
both evidence and seeds of doubt in anyone he pleases, you have to wonder
how he'd fare as a contestant on Survivor or Big Brother.
O was directed by Tim Blake Nelson, who is probably best known as Delmar
from O Brother, Where Art Thou? (you know, the Soggy Bottom Boy who wasn't
George Clooney or John Turturro).  The script was written by debut scribe
Brad Kaaya, who does a good job at changing the setting of the play and
incorporating a handful of Shakespeare's original lines, as well.
1:35 - R for violence, a scene of strong sexuality, language and drug use

Title
Review for Du rififi chez les hommes (1955)
Thank you, Rialto Pictures, for cleaning up and re-releasing Jules
Dassin's Rififi, an incredible French masterpiece in black and white
about a high-stakes jewel heist.  The film, which won Dassin the Best
Director award at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival, is said to have
inspired the likes of Quentin Tarantino and François Truffaut, the
latter of whom called Rififi the best Film Noir he'd ever seen.
Rififi is set in Paris, where gristly Tony (Jean Servais) has just been
popped from the pokey after serving five years for a jewel robbery.  We
later learn that Tony took the fall for his young protégé named Jo (Carl
Möhner) because of his student's young wife and son.  After filling his
lungs with the sweet air of freedom, Tony quickly finds out that Jo is
still involved in the burglary racket and that his girlfriend Mado
(Marie Sabouret) has taken up with a gangster named Grutter (Marcel
Lupovici).
In fact, Jo and his cousin Mario (Robert Manuel) ask Tony if he wants in
on their latest endeavor  stealing diamonds from the window display of
a prominent jeweler.  At first, Tony balks at the idea, declaring that
the store has `more alarms than a firehouse,' but eventually agrees to
participate if Jo and Mario agree to two conditions  they can't use
guns, and they have to go after the jeweler's well-protected vault
instead of the merchandise in the window.  Their pilfering plan is
rounded out by the addition of a safecracker from Milan named Cesar
(played by Dassin under the pseudonym Perlo Vita).
The four men meticulously case the joint, detailing everything from the
hours of operation of each surrounding business to the lap time around
the block.  There's a great scene where they acquire a duplicate of the
jeweler's state-of-the-art alarm system, causing one of the men to
observe that `It's getting harder to make a living' before methodically
testing the alarm like a Consumer Reports scientist.
All of the preparation is merely a set-up for what is probably the best
on-screen robbery ever filmed.  Using rope, an umbrella and some simple
tools, the burglary takes nearly 30 maddening, nail-biting minutes to
unfold, accentuated by a complete lack of dialogue and score.  The
half-hour heist is so detailed, it was actually banned in several
countries when Rififi was first released.
Rififi is pretty violent for a 45-year-old film, but most of the brutal
stuff takes place just off-camera (like the ear-severing scene in
Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs).  Dassin (Never on Sunday), who wrote the
screenplay in six days, does a fantastic job of directing, and the
film's newly restored black-and-white photography looks as lush as
ever.  Rififi is based on Auguste Le Breton's novel and features a
performance by La Dolce Vita's Magali Noël, who sings `Rififi,' a song
about physical confrontation in Grutter's nightclub.
2:00  Not Rated, but contains violence and some mild sexual content

Title
Review for Small Time Crooks (2000)
>From Small Time Crooks' one-sheet, you might think the film is a kids'
movie.  It features a shadowy figure munching on a chocolate-chip
cookie, while the title seems to be a play on words, with the
implication that the `crooks' in question may be diminutive in height.
Relax, pedophobiacs  there isn't a child anywhere in Crooks.
Crooks starts off like a modern-day version of The Honeymooners.  A
dishwashing ex-con named Ray Winkler (Woody Allen) dreams of retiring to
Miami, where he wants only to swim and spend time at the dog track.  One
day, the former stick-up man hatches a plan to rob a Manhattan bank by
renting an abandoned pizza parlor on the same block and tunneling into
the bank's vault.  As Ray sees it, the only thing that stands between
him and his big score is his wife Frenchie (Tracey Ullman, Tracey Takes
On), a derisive manicurist that becomes immediately suspicious when her
husband brings home a box of chocolates before revealing his devious
robbery plans.  When she hesitates, Ray practically sends her to the
moon, Ralph Kramden-style.
Aiding Ray in his attempt to convince Frenchie to go along with his idea
are his two friends and cohorts, Tommy (Tony Darrow, Mickey Blue Eyes)
and Denny (Michael Rapaport, Deep Blue Sea), who are described as being
`so dumb that they never graduated kindergarten because they were
drafted.'  The three would-be criminals need Frenchie for both her
monetary contribution to their scheme, as well as to run the cookie
store that will serve as a front while the men burrow toward the bank
vault.
Of course, the bank heist doesn't go as planned, and the bumbling
burglars instead decide to franchise Sunset Cookies, which has become so
popular that they've hired Frenchie's dimwitted cousin May (Primary
Colors writer Elaine May).  One year later, everyone involved in Sunset
is filthy rich and are even interviewed by 60 Minutes' Steve Kroft in a
particularly funny segment.  All of this takes place in the Crooks first
half-hour.
The remaining hour of Crooks focuses on how money affects the Winklers'
relationship.  Ray despises being rich and longs for his old life back,
while Frenchie dives headfirst into Manhattan's high society, despite
having horrendous taste in both decorating and fashion (in other words,
she turns into Carmella Soprano).  Frenchie, a former stripper, also
hires an art dealer (Hugh Grant, Mickey Blue Eyes) to teach her to how
to become a more proper socialite by escorting her to museums and
performance art shows that Ray wouldn't be caught dead attending.
If there's one thing that Allen can do (besides writing fantastically
original screenplays), it's eliciting great performances from his
actors.  In his last film, Sweet & Lowdown, both principal actors (Sean
Penn and Samantha Morton) received Oscar nods.  Hell, he even made Mira
Sorvino an Oscar winner in Mighty Aphrodite.  And Crooks is no different
- the film features some of the best comedic acting that you will ever
see.  Period.  Crooks is also one of Allen's loudest films, with
cinematographer Fei Zhao perfectly capturing just how loud and gaudy
Frenchie's taste became once she came into money.
Crooks is Allen's thirty-second directorial effort, and the first he's
featured himself in since 1997's Deconstructing Harry.  Since then, the
sixty-four-year-old has appeared in several unbilled cameos (The
Impostors and A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries), provided the voice for
an animated film (Antz) and been the subject of a documentary (Wild Man
Blues).  It's also the second film that the prolific, twenty-time Oscar
nominee has released in the last six months.

Review for Valentine (2001)
Valentine opens in 1988, where a young, nerdy boy asks several girls to
dance with him at a middle school Valentine's Day party.  They all refuse,
and a psychopath is created.  Flash to 13 years later, where all of the
girls who snubbed the boy have grown up to be serious spanking material and,
for some strange reason, are all still living in San Francisco.  One, a
medical student (Roswell's Katherine Heigl), becomes the jilted lover's
first victim in truly predictable fashion (the only thing unpredictable is
that she's studying for finals in February).  We quickly learn that the
killer intends to eliminate the other girls in a similar fashion.  Oh, and
he wears a cherubic Cupid mask, just like one of his classmates had that
tragic night in the sixth grade.
The girls - three blondes and Denise Richards (The World Is Not Enough) -
are murdered one at a time, and the film's goofy script offers several weak
red herrings to throw you off the trail.  The identity of the killer, which
isn't revealed until the last frame of the film, is so painfully obvious, I'
m surprised they don't just show it in the film's trailer.
It's one thing to make a slasher flick and do something original with it
(like Scream), but Valentine doesn't even attempt to distinguish itself in
any way.  It barely makes sense (one of the girls is killed in public.at a
crowded party.and is never discovered), and I actually saw several people
checking their watches during what were supposed to be the exciting scenes.
Angel's David Boreanaz plays one of the girls' boyfriends, and he can't act
for shit.  The whole hunched over, monotone thing he does on television is,
apparently, the extent of his range (there are two Angel jokes that may have
actually been unintentional).  The girls are all unlikable, and none of them
get naked.  Since nudity is sometimes the only redeeming quality of a horror
film, this is a pretty big thing to omit.
Valentine was directed by Jamie Blanks (Urban Legend) and written by Donna
and Wayne Powers (Deep Blue Sea), and Roswell writer/producers Gretchen J.
Berg and Aaron Harberts.  The story is based on a novel written by Tom
Savage, which, from what I understand, is a pretty good read.  The book
spends a great deal of time developing the killer's character, and has him
off his victims one at a time annually on Valentine's Day.

Review for What Lies Beneath (2000)
Here^Ňs another textbook example of a film^Ňs preview giving away too much
of its plot.  What Lies Beneath is a full three-quarters over before you
get to the content revealed in the trailer.  Fortunately, it doesn^Ňt
much matter ^Ö Beneath is a taut psychological thriller that would make
Hitchcock proud.  In fact, it could do for bathtubs what Hitch^Ňs Psycho
did for showers.
Beneath features Harrison Ford (Random Hearts) and Michelle Pfeiffer
(The Story of Us), two stars with box office clout fading faster than
the Baltimore Orioles' chance at a playoff berth.  They play Dr. Norman
and Claire Spencer, a genetic biologist and an ex-concert cellist,
respectively.  They live in a picturesque waterfront Vermont home that
was formerly owned by Norman^Ňs recently deceased father.
While Norman is completely consumed by his work, Claire stays at home
and begins to experience strange and spooky stuff in their new house.
It^Ňs your typical poltergeist fare ^Ö doors opening on their own,
pictures crashing to the floor ^Ö but nobody^Ňs sure if it^Ňs just Claire
suffering from Empty Nest Syndrome (her only daughter just left for
college) or if she^Ňs really experiencing some type of otherworldly
force.  And if Claire is being haunted by an apparition, whose ghost is
it?  Norman^Ňs dead father or perhaps the Spencers' new neighbor, who
Claire believes was murdered?  In an homage to Hitchcock^Ňs Rear Window,
Claire thinks she sees her body being removed from the house one night
in the pouring rain.  Like I said, if you^Ňve seen the trailer, you
already know the answer.
Claire also seems to be suffering from selective amnesia, forgetting
important events that happened in her life, especially those surrounding
a social event where Norman was awarded a Chair at a prestigious
University.  The whole role kind of reminded me of Emma Thompson in
Kenneth Branagh^Ňs wonderful Dead Again.  Claire has to piece her own
life back together with virtually no help from her unsympathetic
husband, who seems to only care that her kookiness is inconveniencing
his career.
There are about a dozen jump-out-of-your-skin moments in Beneath.  You
can see most of them coming, but they^Ňre so well done that it doesn^Ňt
matter.  The ending is very maddening and takes so long to develop
(about thirty minutes) that people at my screening nearly became
physically ill.  I can^Ňt ever recall being at a film before and hearing
a group of men shouting out loud in fear or a woman shrieking at the top
of her lungs. Beneath is a terrific popcorn thriller that plays better
than The Sixth Sense and its sucker-punch ending.  Just don^Ňt eat too
much popcorn.
Pfeiffer gives one of her best performances ever, but Ford has just
turned into a really bad actor.  He^Ňs becoming more and more like
Frankenstein with each film he makes.  I^Ňm not sure if he^Ňs actually
wooden or just grumpy.  Even Beneath^Ňs tagline could be interpreted as a
poke at the fifty-eight-year-old actor ^Ö ^ÓHe was the perfect husband
until his one mistake followed them home.^Ô  What was it?  Sabrina?  Six
Days, Seven Nights?  Random Hearts?  It doesn^Ňt matter ^Ö when Ford takes
off his shirt, studio executives roll around in money like Demi Moore in
Indecent Proposal.
Director Robert Zemeckis (Contact) fills Beneath with a bunch of
technically dazzling long shots, some of which left me scratching my
head and wanting to see the film again.  He^Ňs one of the better
mainstream directors out there, and the fact that Zemeckis and crew are
able to sustain such a level of sheer terror for the last thirty minutes
is a real testament to the director and the script, which was written by
Clark Gregg.  Beneath is Gregg^Ňs debut screenplay, but he^Ňs appeared in
a myriad of films with amazing scripts (Magnolia, The Usual Suspects,
The Spanish Prisoner) and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award
last year for his performance in The Adventures of Sebastian Cole.
Zemeckis, who won an Oscar for Forrest Gump, reassembled his top-notch
crew for Beneath (namely, editor Arthur Schmidt, cinematographer Don
Burgess, score-meister Alan Silvestri and production designer Rick
Carter ^Ö all Oscar nominees for Gump).  They do a fantastic job of
making a beautiful lakefront home seem warm, cozy and inviting, as well
as creepy, ominous and terrifying.  Beneath is the first of two
potential blockbusters helmed by Zemeckis this year - Cast Away, which
re-teams the director with Gump star Tom Hanks, is set to be released
this Christmas.

Review for Next Friday (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
1999 was a great year for film, especially when it came to creating
refreshingly original scripts.  Whether it involved journeys through the
brains of superstars or amphibians falling from the sky, screenwriters
upped the ante in '99, showing that stuff like The Out-of-Towners and
Wild Wild West just don't cut it anymore.  Tired stories, usually
remakes or film versions of television shows, floundered at the box
office, while repeat business for movies like The Sixth Sense and The
Blair Witch Project signaled the public's exhaustion with the same ol'
same ol'.
Gotcha.  Forget that whole paragraph.  This is 2000, baby.  The 21st
century (for those of you that can't count).  The Willennium.  And
what's the first film that comes our way?  A harebrained sequel of a
movie that was, at best, mediocre.  No, I'm not talking about Shaft
Returns or Blade 2 (they aren't until later this year).  The film in
question is Next Friday, a lifeless follow-up to the 1995 underachiever
Friday.
Friday wasn't totally devoid of entertainment value.  In fact, it was
often pretty funny.  The plotless mess didn't perform too admirably at
the box office, but it was a huge video rental and is probably best
known for launching the career of Chris Tucker (Money Talks).  Friday
also boosted the careers of Boyz in the Hood co-stars Nia Long and
Regina King, and was the directorial debut of the marginally talented
F.Gary Gray, who later found success helming Set it Off and The
Negotiator.  But Tucker, Long, King and Gray are all absent from this
miserable project.
Making a sequel to Friday without Tucker is like Thanksgiving without
the turkey.  But, speaking of turkey, Ice Cube returns from the original
film, and he's as plump and round as a Butterball bird.  Mr. Cube (Three
Kings) reprises his role of Craig Jones, a dumpy, perpetually
unemployed, wannabe playa from the hood in south central Los Angeles.
In Friday, Craig and his sidekick Smokey (Tucker) had to raise $200 to
keep the neighborhood bully Deebo (Tom 'Tiny' Lister Jr.) from kicking
the crap out of them.  As the film ended, Craig beat Deebo with a brick
and became somewhat of a neighborhood hero as the tyrant was hauled off
to prison.  Next Friday's story is remarkably similar to its
predecessor.  In fact, you just have to replace the following words:
ˇ Change `hood' to `suburbs'
ˇ Change `Smokey' to `cousin'
ˇ Change `$200' to `$3,800'
ˇ Change `neighborhood bully' to `property tax collector'
ˇ Change `kicking the crap out of them' to `foreclosing on their house'
It's just that simple.  The sequel takes place years after the original,
and the hapless Craig is still unemployed, his buddy Smokey is
conveniently in rehab, his foul-bowel dad is still catching dogs and his
arch-enemy Deebo is still in the clink.  But the word on the street is
that Deebo plans to bust out of the joint and mess up Craig real good.
So, to protect his son, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) decides to send his
boy to live with his brother Uncle Elroy (Don `D.C.' Curry).
A recent resident of the hood, Uncle Elroy escaped his past by winning a
cool million in the lottery and paying cash for a giant house on a
cul-de-sac in posh Rancho Cucamonga.  Or, as Craig says after rolling up
on his peeps crib, `fake-ass Brady Bunch.'  Of course, the secluded
street still offers both a love interest (Tamala Jones, Blue Streak) and
an antagonistic Latino family as neighbors.  No wonder the only white
person in the whole film is the guy that delivers the notice that Uncle
Elroy's house is being foreclosed on due to delinquent taxes.  And the
white guy (Michael Rapaport) doesn't even appear in the credits.
The strange thing about the Friday films is that the characters can
never think of an original way to get the money they need to get out of
trouble.  In the first film, Craig never even got the cash, and the
sequel is nearly as stupid in that regard.  Films like Risky Business or
The Brady Bunch or even Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo offer characters that
are motivated to earn those frogpelts.  I guess that's what you get when
you have a rapper write the script to your film.
Next Friday is the directorial debut of Steve Carr and, quite frankly,
the film shows the uneven pacing of a novice.  Toss in Day-Day's psycho
pregnant ex-girlfriend and her chubby sidekick sister, a killer
pit-bull, numerous pot scenes and a flurry of cheap jokes and derogatory
female characters, and you've basically got yourself an R-rated,
three-part episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.  Hey, I warned you
that it was the Willennium.

Review for Mulholland Drive (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
First things first: David Lynch's latest film has absolutely nothing to do
with that stupid 1996 Chinatown rip-off called Mulholland Falls (you should
always be wary of a film that's selling point is how realistic its hats
are). Mulholland Drive was something Lynch made years ago as a two-hour
pilot for ABC, but it was ultimately never picked up by the network...and
with good reason.  This shit would have terrified a television audience.
The notion of Fred and Mary Lou Cornpone from Peoria watching Who Wants to
be a Millionaire lead in to this must have been too much for the network
brass to handle.
Luckily, a French company gave Lynch (The Straight Story) $7 million to turn
the unresolved pilot into a movie.  The writer/director re-shot some
existing scenes and added new material to Drive, which ultimately netted him
the Best Director Award at this year's Cannes Film Festival.  As you would
expect from a movie that made the unusual transformation from television
drama to feature-length picture, Drive becomes garbled and unintelligible
over its last 30 minutes, which, presumably, is what Lynch added to the
film's original format.  If you can understand the last half-hour, you
should either be heading up your own brain trust or immediately locked up.
While Lynch might be best known for his surreal takes on small-town America,
Drive seems like his spooky tribute to Hollywood.  The film's opening
credits play over what could be a Gap khakis commercial, but it only takes
about three minutes to get seriously creepy.  The action begins with a vampy
looker (Laura Harring) riding in the back of a limousine.  The car stops on
Mulholland Drive and the driver orders the woman out at gunpoint, but before
she can react, the parked limo is creamed by an oncoming car.  The woman,
who appears to be the only survivor of the crash, stumbles away and passes
out, Margot Kidder-style, on somebody's lawn.
The lawn in question belongs to an elderly couple who are on their way out
of L.A. and have left their gorgeous apartment (which looks a lot like
Melrose Place) to their equally gorgeous niece Betty (Naomi Watts), who is
naive, chipper and eager enough to have been teleported from the '50s.  She
wants to be an actress and has just arrived in town from Deep River, Ontario
(which drew a huge laugh from the audience at the Toronto International Film
Festival), presumably making the journey on a turnip truck.  The crash
survivor, now suffering from amnesia, is discovered by Betty, and like any
native of Deep River, she bends over backward to help the stranger, who says
her name is Rita (as in Hayworth) after seeing a movie poster hanging in the
apartment.  The mystery deepens when Rita's purse is opened to reveal stack
upon stack of large bills.
The third leg of Drive's story is about a young, hotshot movie director
named Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux, American Psycho), who is appalled to
learn the producers of his latest film want to replace his lead actress.  In
a very surreal business meeting, his producers show him a picture of the
woman they'd like him to cast, repeating the phrase "This is the girl" over
and over again.  If that wasn't odd enough, Adam heads home and finds his
wife getting reamed by Billy Ray Cyrus, who then proceeds to beat the
stuffing out of him.  Former tap dance legend Ann Miller even makes an
appearance as Betty's nosy landlord.
The tales of Betty, Rita (couldn't Lynch have just named her Veronica?) and
Adam intertwine and are added to other set pieces (some involving curtained
rooms with a certain midget Lynch fans have grown to love) that barely make
sense but are so damn entertaining and visually pleasing that it hardly
matters.  Angelo Badalamenti's score is typically strong and simultaneously
eerie, while cinematographer Peter Deming, who also does a great job on the
upcoming From Hell, makes everything shadowy and claustrophobic.
In Story, you kept waiting for something dark and weird to happen, but it
never did (which was part of the film's genius).  That dark, weird stuff
happens here, and often.  Drive is likely to divide critics and fans as
decisively as last year's Cannes champ Dancer in the Dark did.  Of the three
relatively unknown stars, Watts steals the show and could be the new Meg
Ryan (because I think we're all a little tired of the old one, aren't we?).
And she's involved in some of the hottest non-porn girl-on-girl action you'
re likely ever to see in a mainstream film.

Title
Review for Jump Tomorrow (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Jump Tomorrow is cute with a capital C.  Everything about it is cute, from
the story, to the direction, to the sets, to the songs.  If you can't walk
away from this film with a smile on your face, you'd better keep right on
walking to your shrink's office.
Tomorrow focuses on George Abiola (Tunde Adebimpe), a perpetually
uncomfortable-looking Nigerian man who is about to marry a childhood friend.
George, who looks like he came out of his mom wearing a suit, could be a
grown-up Urkel on quaaludes.  And to say he's nervous about his impending
nuptials would be a drastic understatement.
With his traditional Nigerian wedding just a few days away (it's set to take
place in Niagara Falls), George heads to the airport to pick up his fiancée,
who is on her way from Nigeria.  But he comes one day late, and, after
calling his uncle (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), finds out Sophie (Abiola Wendy
Abrams) is already in Niagara Falls.
George meets two strangers at the airport - a Latina beauty named Alicia
(Natalia Verbeke) and a man named Gerard (two-time César Award nominee
Hippolyte Girardot) who was dumped by his fiancée at the airport.  George is
instantly smitten with Alicia, who calls him Jorge and invites him to a
party later that night, and, almost against his will, George becomes
Gerard's co-pilot after he offers to drive the groom-to-be to Niagara Falls.
As chance would have it, Alicia and her smarmy Brit boyfriend Nathan (James
Wilby) are hitching a ride to Canada, and most of Tomorrow shows Gerard
trying to coerce George into following Alicia and winning her affections.
Gerard, who George talks out of jumping off a building (convincing him to
"jump tomorrow"), is kind of like a suicidal Cupid.  Even his license plate
reads "Amour 1."  And then your basic road trip flick stuff ensues.
Tomorrow is a lot like Jim Jarmusch's Stranger Than Paradise in more ways
than just having three main characters and being predominantly set on Lake
Erie. Paradise, like most of Jarmusch's other films, shows complete
strangers of different nationalities, who would ordinarily have nothing to
do with each other, forced into contact with one another for bizarre
reasons.  Granted, there's a lot more going on in Tomorrow than in Paradise,
but the similarities are still there.
Tomorrow is a British film packed full of folks from a bunch of different
countries.  Writer/director Joel Hopkins based Tomorrow on an award-winning
short (called Jorge) that featured Adebimpe playing the same character but
in a different setting.

Title
Review for Mummy Returns, The (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you're at all familiar with the legend of The Mummy, you already know its
producers phoned writer/director Stephen Sommers the morning after the film
opened to boffo business and told him to start preparing a sequel.  Now,
almost two years to the day later, The Mummy Returns hits the screen with
more action and an even dumber story, as completely far-fetched as that may
seem.  It makes the original look like the greatest story ever told, when,
in fact, it was a bloated, brainless action film that boasted only decent
special effects and some odd casting which stuck (some) arthouse talent into
a Hollywood blockbuster.
Returns is set almost a decade after the first film concluded, so here's a
little update on your favorite characters.  Dashing Rick O'Connell (Brendan
Fraser, Monkeybone), the former French Legion soldier, has unknowingly
become The Chosen One because of a tattoo on his hand that we never saw in
the original, even though his character mentions the fact that he got it in
an orphanage as a child.  Rick is now married to Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel
Weisz, Enemy at the Gates), who has made the remarkable transformation from
bumbling librarian to something akin to Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2.
Evie's brother Jonathan (John Hannah) is just as inept and unnecessary as
ever, and the mysterious Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr, Deuce Bigalow) is still
hanging around for some reason.
Christ - who am I kidding?  It doesn't make a lick of difference who is cast
in these roles or what has happened to the characters since we've last seen
them.  Fraser, Weisz & Co. could have been replaced with dogs and chimps
wearing period costumes and the net result on the box office take would be
negligible (if not a little better).  Returns is like many films that suffer
from sequel-itis, finding half-assed ways to get the characters into the
story, loading up the dialogue with gems like "Oh, no - not these guys
again," as well as creating better bad guys (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) and
new and improved good guys (Freddie Boath, who plays the son of Rick and
Evie).
Returns kicks off with a scene set in 3067 BC, where we learn the confusing
story of the Scorpion King (Johnson) and his band of deadly Anubis warriors.
There's talk of curses and soul-selling and stuff, but there's so much
action packed into these first five minutes, it's hard to keep up.  Long
story short, the Scorpion King dies, but whoever finds his magic bracelet
can revive him, kill him and take control of his fearsome fighters,
presumably in hopes of world domination.  Oh, and if you're going to Returns
because you're a fan of The People's Champion, you'll probably want to leave
when this little intro is over because that's pretty much the last whiff
you'll get of what the Rock is cookin'.
The film then switches gears and takes us to 1933 (the Year of the Scorpion,
no less), where Rick and Evie unearth the Scorpion King's bracelet, which
accidentally finds its way onto the hand of their son.  This, of course,
means the Scorpion King will rise from the dead in just seven days and raise
all kinds of trouble (as well as, we assume, his eyebrow).  In the meantime,
a group of bad guys have located the remains of Imhotep (Billy Zane clone
Arnold Vosloo) and wake him up from his dirt nap so he can do battle with
the big SK and be reunited with his dead lover (Patricia Velazquez).  I'm
still not sure who I was supposed to be rooting for.
The protagonists do a lot of moving around here, using strange modes of
transportation (camel, double-decker bus, a wave, dirigible and train)
throughout several different locations in an attempt to accomplish something
that I'm not yet clear on.  One thing I do know is that it took way too long
to get there.  At the 60-minute mark, there's still five days left before
the Scorpion King is supposed to come back to life, and when he does, it's
like getting coal for Christmas.  During one five-minute span, the film rips
off Gremlins, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Star Wars and Princess Mononoke.
But why stop there?  Returns evens pilfers scenes from its original, which
made me do one of those cartoon double-takes.
Sommers, whose previous film effort was the awful Deep Rising, has penned
one of the worst stories of the year, smacking of more unoriginality than
anything I've seen in a while.  Even the score from Alan Silvestri (The
Mexican) seems like a calculated cross between Star Wars and Superman. Sure,
the effects are good, but the whole Imhotep reanimation thing isn't nearly
as cool as last year's Hollow Man.  Returns does look nice, though, with
cinematographer Adrian Biddle returning from the original picture.

Review for Sous le sable (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
François Ozon's latest feature is shocking because it's not the slightest
bit shocking.  Anybody who has seen Criminal Lovers, a crazy cross between
Badlands and Hansel & Gretel, knows Ozon can make films that are just as
controversial and disturbing as Hannibal or Freddy Got Fingered.  But Under
the Sand is quite a departure from Lovers - is it maturity, or the desire to
build an eclectic filmography?  Who knows, but if you're expecting something
similar to Ozon's previous films, you might find Sand to be a bit slow and
tedious.  As long as you don't mind the lack of unsettling content, viewers
should find the film to be an interesting story with a terrific lead
performance.
The film opens with a scene more than a little reminiscent of With a Friend
Like Harry, which was written and directed by Ozon's fellow countryman
Dominik Moll.  It shows a husband and wife driving to their vacation home,
but, unlike Harry, the couple is older, have no children and enjoy a quiet
ride. After taking a break at a rest stop, they finally make it to their
destination without uttering so much as a word to each other.  Although they
travel in silence, you can clearly tell that Jean (Bruno Cremer) and Marie
Drillon (Charlotte Rampling, Aberdeen) are a happily married couple that
have become accustomed to each other's little quirks and routines.
Then again, things aren't always what they seem to be (just ask the guy who
won the last Presidential election).  One day, while enjoying the sun and a
book on a quiet beach, Jean decides to take a swim.  Several hours pass
before Marie notices he hasn't returned.  She alerts lifeguards and the
police, but nobody can find her husband.  Was he done in by the strong tide,
or was foul play involved?  Perhaps Jean was unhappy and ran off to start a
new life in a new city, or maybe he was suicidal.  With no body and no
evidence, Marie and the police are unable to jump to any conclusions.
Sand then flashes forward several months, where Marie has returned to Paris
and resumed her career (she teaches English literature) and her social life.
We see her at a friend's dinner party, where she fields compliments from a
potential suitor named Vincent (Jacques Nolot), but notice that Marie is
still referring to Jean in the present tense.  When she gets home, Jean is
there, and Marie carries on as if the whole beach incident never happened,
leaving more unanswered questions.  Did Jean fake his death for insurance
money?  Is Marie off her nut and imagining that Jean is still alive?  Or
maybe we're seeing Jean in flashbacks?  Things become more mysterious when
Marie has an affair with Vincent and begins to incorporate him into the
routines we previously saw her engage in with Jean.
As the truth becomes clearer and clearer, we're treated to a wonderful
performance from Rampling, who, at 56, still looks amazing, and Ozon's
direction doesn't let you forget it.  People who complain that there aren't
any decent roles for middle-aged women need to check this film out (so do
Gena Rowlands fans, who will be amazed by the resemblance of actress
Alexandra Stewart, who plays Marie's friend).
Although Sand is quite a departure from Lovers in terms of both content and
the way they were shot (the former is almost drab compared to the latter's
flamboyant colors), it's certainly a step forward in Ozon's direction,
leaving the world holding their breath in anticipation of his next project.

Review for Vulgar (2000)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Insulting, unlikable, badly acted, yet a tribute to how much Kevin Smith
believes in his friends, Vulgar looks like a high school film project
completed the day before it was due. Produced by Smith and written, directed
and edited by Bryan Johnson (better known as Steve Dave from Smith's
View-Askewniverse), the film caused dozens of people to flee the theatre at
last year's Toronto International Film Festival. Walkouts are somewhat of a
rarity in Toronto, especially with the director and stars in attendance
(seated right next to the door, no less), so that should give you an idea of
what we're dealing with here.
You know how some adults are still spooked by the sight of clowns? Those
folks should stay far away from Vulgar. Actually, now that I think about it,
everyone should stay away from Vulgar. The film stars Brian O'Halloran
(better know as Dante Hicks from Clerks) as Will Carlson, a sad sack young
man who dresses as a clown and works children's birthday parties. Without
getting into too many of the sick details, Will ends up in the wrong place
at the wrong time and gets gang-raped by a father and two sons who videotape
the anal intrusion.
Somehow, Will becomes a hero and gets his own television show (called
"Flappy's Funhouse"), but finds himself blackmailed by his rapists, who have
the rape tape. There are familiar faces (like Smith, Jason Mewes, Walter
Flanagan, Scott Mosier and Ethan Suplee), a familiar setting (Red Bank, New
Jersey, natch) and some familiar gags (like calling someone a "fudgestick"),
but Vulgar is mostly nasty and, uh, vulgar. The crowd in Toronto, which was
packed full of Smith's fans, anxiously jumped all over anything that
involved the slightest hint of a joke with nervous laughter.

Review for Doctor Dolittle (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Eddie Murphy is back in what is being touted by Fox as `The funniest
movie since The Nutty Professor'.  Hell, it's not even the funniest
Eddie Murphy movie since The Nutty Professor.  Well, that's true if you
can count Mulan as an Eddie Murphy movie.  And who would have thought
that the trash-talking comic would have two kiddie-pics open in
back-to-back weekends?
Based on the Hugh Lofting books and its 1967 musical predecessor, Doctor
Dolittle stars Murphy in the title role of a man who can communicate
with the animals.  It's a bless/curse he discovered as a child, but
blocked it out when his father (Ossie Davis, I'm Not Rappaport) sent the
family dog to the pound.
Dolittle resurrects his special talent when he accidentally hits a dog
in his fancy doctor utility vehicle.  The fun ensues via dozens of cameo
voice appearances by seemingly every star in Hollywood.  Half of the fun
is trying to figure out who is who and the other half is trying to read
the credits while the people in front of you stand up and scratch their
asses for the better part of five minutes.
I'm not saying that Doctor Dolittle is bad or boring.  In fact, it's
quite funny for the first thirty minutes, but after that it's kind of
like beating a dead horse.  A dead talking horse.  Most of the good
stuff has already appeared in the trailer and most of it can be
classified as `toilet humor' or `potty jokes', which is my favorite.
Murphy is pretty bland in his somewhat confined roll, but more
disappointing is the direction of Betty Thomas (Private Parts, The Late
Shift), whose previous efforts are more of a fly-on-the-wall documentary
style features.  Perhaps the limited subject matter (from first time
writer Larry Levin and The Preacher's Wife scribe Nat Mauldin) has cost
Thomas her usually brilliantly sharp comic edge.  Dolittle seems very
flat and very by-the-numbers.  But, at least it's not a musical.

Title
Review for Heartbreakers (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
Some movies are bad enough to make you say, "One thousand monkeys in a room
with one thousand typewriters couldn't come up with an idea this bad."  Some
movies make you say, "I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and throw up a
better story than this."  And then there's Heartbreakers.
The film opens with a wedding between Max (Sigourney Weaver, Galaxy Quest)
and Dean (Ray Liotta, Hannibal).  Apparently, they're waiting until their
wedding night to have sex, so he's as horny as can be.  But she falls asleep
before he can consummate the marriage, and Dean heads off to his chop shop
to tie up some loose ends before they begin their honeymoon.  17 hours after
their wedding, Max catches Dean getting oral from his receptionist Page
(Jennifer Love Hewitt, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), files for
divorce and walks away with a wad of cash and a brand-new car.
The catch is that Max and Page are really a mother/daughter grifting team
(they're the Conners.get it?). This is the thirteenth time the
overprotective Max has participated in a phony marriage to squeeze money out
of an unsuspecting man, and it's supposed to be the last scam the two pull
as a team.  Page wants to go out on her own, but she's forced into one last
score with her mom when they learn an IRS agent (Anne Bancroft, Keeping the
Faith) has seized their bank accounts and expects another $200,000 in just
90 days.
So the two barracudas head for Palm Beach (home of the ignorant, if you
remember that little election snafu) and start casing potential marks.  Max
settles on billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman, The Replacements), a
chain smoker with baked-bean teeth who is on death's doorstep.  In the
meantime, Page sets her sights on a local bar owner named Jack (Jason Lee,
Almost Famous) whose property could be worth millions.  He's the nice guy
you know the conniving Page will eventually fall for after initially
disgusting her.
Heartbreakers is a mean-spirited comedy - a la Whipped - that thinks it can
get away with two hours of bile-spewing because its lead characters are
intelligent women who only pretend to be a couple of whores.  Imagine the
picketing if Heartbreakers was about crafty men scamming idiotic women in
the same manner.  In a good film, they'd end up getting grifted themselves,
but the script isn't even that clever.  What's more, it's implausible, too.
Extravagant weddings happen at the snap of the fingers, and the ending makes
as much sense as a New York City cabdriver.
Aside from Lee, who acts circles around Hewitt and still looks embarrassed,
everyone else seems like they've had their brains eaten (especially Liotta,
for some reason).  It's hard to tell where things went wrong, but when all
else fails, point at the writer(s).  There's three of them here, but two of
them penned the amusing Liar Liar.  Director David Mirkin is an Emmy winner
for The Simpsons, so he gets some slack.  Even the music is annoying, with
one snippet of a Danny Elfman song played until it's blue in the face.
The best part of the film is when Max has a breakdown at the end, shouting,
"I'm a horrible mother.  I'm a horrible person."  It wouldn't be out of line
to shout back "You're a horrible actress," or at least, "You have horrible
taste in picking projects" right back at her.

Title
Review for Psycho Beach Party (2000)
Campy playwright Charles Busch's screenwriting debut is  surprise 
great campy, B-movie fun.  Psycho Beach Party is a funny murder mystery
decorated with surf music, cars with fins, poodle skirts, drive-ins,
luaus and split personality disorder.  The film's eclectic cast
literally has something for everyone.
The cherubic Lauren Ambrose (Can't Hardly Wait) stars as Florence
Forrest, an underdeveloped teenage girl from Malibu who is worried that
something is wrong with her because she doesn't like boys.  Despite all
of the reassurances from her family's Swedish exchange student Lars
(Matt Keeslar, Scream 3), Florence is perpetually down in the dumps.
One day at the beach, Florence notices some buff whitecap riders and
develops an interest in surfing.  But her wide-eyed eagerness is met
with resistance from the boys, who point out that `girls can't surf.'
Luckily, Florence befriends the Great Kanaka (Thomas Gibson, Dharma &
Greg) the local surf guru (who talks in rhyme) and, before long, she's
hanging ten with the best of them.  She even begins to get close with a
surfer named Starcat (Nicholas Brendon, Buffy the Vampire Slayer).
On a more disturbing note, Florence has a bit of an alter ego problem.
It seems that whenever she sees something circular, her personality
changes from squaresville into an acid-tongued sexpot.  And to make
matters worse, every time Florence becomes Ann, a grisly murder occurs.
Throw in a haunted beach house, guys rolling around in the sand and a
butch police captain (played by Busch), and you've got a pretty smart
whodunit.
Directed by Robert Lee King (Boys Life), Party is entertaining,
tongue-in-cheek fun that's real cool, daddy-o.  Dig?  Good.

Title
Review for Notting Hill (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Julia Roberts?  Playing the role of the most popular actress on the
planet?  It sounds like the biggest head-trip in the world, but it's
actually Notting Hill, the best romantic comedy produced by Hollywood in
recent memory.
Roberts (My Best Friend's Wedding) plays Anna Scott, the kind of movie
star that often finds herself the fodder for tabloids all over the
world.  One day, on a rare occasion where she is not being ushered by a
publicist, Anna stumbles into a store that specializes in travel books.
The shop, located in the diverse Notting Hill section of London, is
owned by a chap named William Thacker (Hugh Grant, Nine Months).
Within a few minutes, William lives out the fantasy of every male over
the age of twelve  meeting a rich, beautiful celebrity and having her
instantly fall for your `regular guy' charm.  Of course, my fantasy
doesn't usually involve dumping orange juice down the front of her and
then having her clean up at your flat, which happens to be right across
the street.  In my fantasy, it's usually barbecue sauce.
Thanks to his Pig-Pen-esque Welsh roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans, Twin
Town), it's days before William finds out that Anna has called and asked
to meet at her hotel.  A gleeful William hurries to the hotel, only to
find himself smack in the middle of the press junket for Anna's latest
flick, the sci-fi thriller Helix.  This hysterical scene involves
William being mistaken as a member of the press (namely Horses and
Hounds magazine) and being forced to interview the stars of Helix, a
movie that he has never seen.  Believe me, critics will be raving about
this scene, as it plays out as a bit of an inside joke just for them.
The film really takes off when Anna accompanies William to his younger
sister's birthday party.  The partygoers try not to overreact to the
presence of such a huge star, while Anna, amazed by the activities of
common folk, just tries to fit in.  At the end of their next date Anna
asks William back to her hotel room, only to find her boorish boyfriend
(the well-cast boor Alec Baldwin), which brings both the wonderful
evening and their blossoming relationship to a screeching halt.
Notting Hill will likely draw comparisons to Best Picture nominee Four
Weddings and a Funeral (Richard Curtis wrote both Hugh Grant vehicles),
and with good reason.  In Four Weddings, the story was slowed down by
the romance between Grant and Andie MacDowell, just like it is here.
The best moments are not when director Roger Michell's (Persuasion)
camera focuses on just Hugh and Julia  they're when William's
close-knit friends, or the perpetually filthy Spike, are on the screen.
Although it's more than just a chick flick, will Notting Hill's female
viewers be able to sympathize with the Julia Roberts character?  Despite
the fact that she is both famous and gorgeous, Anna has more to complain
about than a leper at an arm wrestling competition.  My guess is that
they will.  Like Howard Stern eloquently said, `It's like Pretty Woman,
only in reverse!'  (2:03 - PG-13 for sexual content and mild adult
language)

Title
Review for Cider House Rules, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Author John Irving so despised last fall's film adaptation of his short
story A Prayer for Owen Meaney that he yanked his blessing from it,
forcing the producers to call it Simon Birch instead.  So he wrote the
screenplay for his novel The Cider House Rules himself, and the result
is one whopper of a fantastic picture.  It's an unconventional
coming-of-age story that is split into two equally beautiful halves.
The film begins in the 1920s, where we are introduced to young Homer
Wells, a resident of a secluded orphanage in St. Clouds, Maine.  Homer
was actually adopted and returned twice; once because he didn't cry
(orphans quickly learn it does them no good) and once because he
wouldn't stop (a victim of child abuse).  Taken under the wing of the
orphanage's director, Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine, Little Voice),
Homer grows up (becoming Tobey Maguire, Ride with the Devil) in the
institution, watches the other children find homes and comes to accept
the fact that he will likely spend his entire youth there.  Under the
doctor's tutelage, Homer even learns how to deliver babies and perform
abortions, even though the idea of the latter is at odds with his
personal beliefs.
Despite having a warm father figure in Dr. Larch and the job of big
brother to the orphanage's other children, Homer longs for a different
life with firm rules and clearer objectives.  He longs to leave, but
can't even join the armed forces because of a heart defect.  Homer finds
an opportunity when a pregnant young woman named Candy Kendall (Charlize
Theron, Mighty Joe Young) visits the orphanage to have an abortion
performed.  Her fiancé, Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd, The Object of My
Affection), is a serviceman on leave to help harvest his family's apple
orchard.  When Candy and Wally depart, Homer goes with them, taking up
residence in the rundown cider house on the Worthingtons' land.
In the cider house, which is chock full of popular R&B artists
(including Heavy D and Erykah Badu), Homer finds exactly what he is
looking for, despite the hard, backbreaking work in the orchards.  He
misses Dr. Larch and the other children, but hey, when you've got a girl
like Candy hanging around, it's easy to forget the things that you used
to hold close to you.  The two develop a relationship once Wally heads
back to war and, let me tell you, there is almost nothing more
disturbing than watching Maguire with the angelic Theron.  But even in
the happiness of his newly found freedom, Homer learns that life isn't
full of straightforward answers, despite having rules to live by for the
first time in his life.
The acting in The Cider House Rules is terrific, especially Caine, who
was robbed of a statue last year for Little Voice.  Well, someone was
robbed  either him or Bill Murray (Rushmore).  As the ether-sniffing
doctor, Caine shows genuine love for every child that he cares for,
taking the time to name each one as they are born, and reading them
stories each night.  The line `Goodnight, you Princes of Maine, you
Kings of New England,' which Larch uses as a sign-off to the children
every evening before bed, still leaves a lump in my throat when I see
the trailer, even though it's been over two months since I've seen the
film.  Delroy Lindo (A Life Less Ordinary) also shines in a supporting
role as Badu's father.
The Cider House Rules is a breathtakingly gorgeous film, with director
Lasse Hallström (What's Eating Gilbert Grape) and cinematographer Oliver
Stapleton (William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream) crafting
both beautiful backgrounds and amazingly lush scenery.  The film is as
beautiful as any you will see this year, save possibly Sleepy Hollow and
Snow Falling on Cedars.  My only complaint is the ending (which I would
spoil by explaining here) and the fact that the credits say `Introducing
Erykah Badu,' despite the fact that she already had a role in Blues
Brothers 2000.  Do they think we could ever forget the train wreck that
was Blues Brothers 2000?  Make another film like The Cider House Rules
and I just might be able to.
2:11 - PG-13 for mature thematic elements, sexuality, nudity, substance
abuse and some violence

Title
Review for Straight Story, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Ordinarily, I wouldn't give a second thought to the dunderheads that
think the world will end with the onset of the new millennium.  But who
was counting on two G-rated films being among the best of this year's
releases?  Scarier yet is the fact that both films were directed by two
of the last people you would ordinarily associate with a G-rated film -
David Mamet (The Winslow Boy) and here, David Lynch's The Straight
Story.  Mamet's forte seems to be cramming as many expletives into a
film as humanly possible, while Lynch's films are a mélange of adult
language, kinky sex, gratuitous violence and deranged characters.  The
Straight Story is a different story altogether.
Story begins with several shots of a small Midwestern town - houses,
people, businesses, landscapes.  Since Lynch is involved in the project,
I held my breath waiting for the camera to pan down and reveal a
detached body part laying in a field (a la Blue Velvet).  But it doesn't
happen.  The film's protagonist is 73-year-old Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), a kindly old codger with bad hips, diabetes and emphysema. 
Despite his declining physical health, Straight refuses his doctor's
advice, rebuffing the need for surgery, tests, x-rays and the use of a
walker.  Straight is a widower and lives with his slow-witted daughter
Rose (Sissy Spacek, Blast From the Past).
When he gets news that his estranged brother Lyle has suffered a stroke,
Straight decides at once that he needs to visit his sibling in
Wisconsin.  With no car, a mentally challenged daughter, failing
eyesight and the inability to walk more than a few steps at a time,
Straight begins the trip from Laurens, Iowa to Wisconsin the only way he
can - on his riding lawnmower.  The trip takes many weeks and Straight
encounters the typical road-movie hazards along the way, including
breakdowns, hitchhikers, inclement weather and traffic accidents.  As he
chomps on cold hot dogs, he slowly waves to slack-jawed onlookers that
don't seem sure whether to laugh, salute or wave back.
Probably best known for his Oscar-nominated performance in the Alan J.
Pakula western Comes a Horseman, Farnsworth gives one of the year's best
and most heartfelt performances, and is destined for year-end
recognition.  His Straight is reminiscent of Peter Fonda's
Oscar-nominated turn in Ulee's Gold, with both mature characters going
to any length to preserve their family in films that take their time to
unravel.  Spacek is memorable as the birdhouse-building Rose and could
also garner accolades if Disney gives the film a big marketing push. 
But Story could be overshadowed by the Mouse House's unusual number of
Oscar-contenders this year, including The Sixth Sense and The Insider. 
Each is capable of receiving multiple nods.
Lynch's (Lost Highway) direction has never been better than it is here,
reminding viewers how much can be said with long shots, a good score and
minimal dialogue.  He more than effectively portrays the severity of
Straight's physical condition, as well as just how slowly his lawnmower
travels down the long, country roads.  And speaking of the score, it's
amazing.  Longtime Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti crafts one
beautiful melody after another, using more guitars in Story that we're
used to hearing from the composer.  The film is wisely set in the fall,
so viewers will be treated to lush, colorful scenery that seems to burst
off of the screen.  Another old-timer, 82-year-old cinematographer
Freddie Francis (an Oscar winner for Glory) provides the beautiful
visuals.  Remarkably, the film is based on a true story and is adapted
by debut screenwriters John Roach and Mary Sweeney, the latter also
serving as the film's editor.

Title
Review for Red Planet (2000)
When 2000 dawned, it looked like we'd have dueling Mars films, kind of
similar to the two films about computer-generated ants we had back in
1998, or the battling volcano pictures from 1997.  Like those other
movies, the Mars films were originally scheduled to hit the theatres
within a month of each other.  Ultimately, Mission to Mars opted for a
March release and Red Planet picked a pre-holiday opening in November.
At the time, it seemed as though Planet changed its date to distance
itself from the similarly themed Mission, but it turns out that wasn't
the case.  Planet sucks, and its studio is hoping the film gets lost in
the dust that will be created by the freight train known as Adam
Sandler's Little Nicky.  It's a sacrificial lamb with knocking knees and
dingleberries stuck to its ass fur.
Planet is set halfway through the 21st century, where our race has
apparently sapped the Earth of its resources, leading to an extensive
period of the development of Mars for human use.  They've grown algae
and built a station that is supposed to support a crew of scientists for
over two years.  Everything seems to be going well, and then the oxygen
levels suddenly bottom out.  With no time to figure out why, humanity
blasts six people off to Mars.  Here's the rundown on the crew:
ˇ Commander Kate Bowman (Carrie-Anne Moss, The Crew) is in charge of the
mission and acts as the Mars-1 pilot.  She's a tough, no-nonsense girl
with a great rack.
ˇ Ted Santen (Benjamin Bratt, The Next Best Thing) is the mission's
co-pilot.  He's well-built, cocky and doesn't mind letting everybody
else know how great he is.
ˇ Dr. Bud Chantillas (Terence Stamp, The Limey) is the Chief Science
Officer.  He's an old codger (the only crew member who has seen frogs in
his lifetime) who has recently shifted his allegiance from science to
God.
ˇ Robby Gallagher (Val Kilmer, Joe the King) is the mechanic.  Despite
his intelligence, is often looked down on by the other crewmembers.
ˇ Dr. Quinn Burchenal (Tom Sizemore, Play It to the Bone) is a civilian
bioengineer sent to solve the mystery of the missing oxygen.  If you're
familiar with Sizemore, you'll know that him playing a doctor is a
little more than a stretch.
ˇ Chip Pettengill (Simon Baker, Ride With the Devil) is another
civilian, but this guy is an expert in terraforming.  Which means he
knows a lot about dirt and rocks.  Yawn.
ˇ AMEE is a robotic elimination machine that looks like one of those
Poo-Chi dogs.  She's a cold-blooded killer when set in `military mode'
but is just as sweet as can be otherwise.
As you would expect in a sci-fi/action film, Mars-1 experiences problems
minutes before the crew is set to leave for the rocky terrain of Mars.
In a spectacularly silly scene, the crew hurtles toward terra firma in a
pod that is covered with airbags that make it look like an oversized
bunch of grapes.  The crew is banged up, their pied-ŕ-terre has been
trashed by some unknown enemy, and AMEE is on the loose and out for
blood.  Oh, yeah, and they're out of oxygen, too.
There are some plot holes wide enough to drive a space shuttle through
in Planet.  The Mars-1 crew is supposed to be making the first manned
mission to the fourth planet from the sun, so who built the place they
were supposed to live in?  How does Gallagher get a solar-powered radio
to work after the sun has gone down?  At one point, the remaining
members of the expedition walk over 100 kilometers in 19 hours 
including a stop to sleep for the night.  The best part may have been
when Gallagher uses parts from the '97 Mars Rover to build a radio.  At
least he knows where to find it.
Planet is the directorial debut of Antony Hoffman and, with any luck,
somebody will confiscate his license to make any more films (he can't
even spell his name right, for Christ's sake).  The hackneyed script was
penned by the Lethal Weapon 4 team of Jonathan Lemkin and Channing
Gibson.  Even the cinematography from David Cronenberg regular Peter
Suschitzky is underwhelming.

Review for Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY:  http://www.sick-boy.com
Imagine that you talk your three best friends into giving you their life
savings for you to wager in a can't-miss high-stakes poker game.
Imagine that, despite your remarkable card-playing skills, you somehow
lose everything and even end up in debt to a fellow named `Hatchet'
Harry, a local crime boss and porn king that once beat a man to death
with a gigantic black rubber marital aid.  Imagine Harry tells you that
if you don't cough up his cash within a week, he'll send his henchman,
Barry the Baptist, to start chopping off the digits of you and your
friends.
That's the basic plot of Guy Ritchie's exhilarating big-screen debut,
which was a critical and box office hit in England and the darling of
this year's Sundance Film Festival.  Ritchie's inspired directing
technique, especially during the aforementioned card game (where it
almost feels like you were actually punched in the stomach), is actually
one-upped by his splendid script, which also includes a drug kingpin, a
group of degenerates led by a guy named `Dog,' a stoned group of pot
growers, two idiot hitmen, a father-and-son debt-collecting team, a pair
of antique shotguns and a bartender played by Sting.
Sound confusing?  It is for a while, but Ritchie ties everything up so
deliciously in the last ten minutes that you can't help grin as the cast
is hilariously thinned out by a series of misunderstandings and bad
timing.  What starts out as a hodgepodge of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting
and Reservoir Dogs slowly becomes as enjoyable and visually stylish as
the films from which Lock, Stock draws its comparisons.  For fans from
across the pond, look for notorious soccer bad-boy Vinnie Jones as the
debt-collector Big Chris and the late bare-knuckle fighting champ P.H.
Moriarty as Barry the Baptist, a man who earned his name for his
drowning interrogation style.  The film also has a great soundtrack
featuring The Stooges, The Stone Roses and James Brown.  Produced by
Trudie Styler (aka Mrs. Sting).  (R  1:05 extreme violence, adult
language and brief nudity)
JON'S INTERVIEW WITH LOCK, STOCK STAR VINNIE JONES
That was the final line delivered by Big Chris, a vicious debt collector
in the new, highly stylish British import Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels.  The funny thing is that he utters it with as much vigor and
emotion as a Stallone or a Van Damme.
But the actor playing Big Chris isn't a `big' action hero  he's Vinnie
Jones, a major star in English soccer making his film debut in Lock,
Stock.  Describing his thuggish role, Jones says, `He's very tough and
he's got a lot of respect on the street.'  Jones adds `He takes his boy
with him, Little Chris, and he's teaching him the ropes, but he's also
trying to teach him manners.'
The scenes featuring Big and Little Chris are some of the most
entertaining in the film.  And the irony isn't lost on Jones, who has
been known to strike fear into the hearts of opponents on the soccer
pitch.  `When I'm on the football field, I've got like a Jekyl and Hyde
character; I know that,' Jones continues, `But I'm just going out there
and I want to win, and sometimes that gets you into a lot of trouble.'
Trouble, indeed  Jones has been ejected from ten matches in his career,
but that kind of passion might be what caught the eyes of casting
directors.  The 33-year-old Welsh star might sound like somewhat of a
British Dennis Rodman  he made a few cameo appearances on British TV
and even hosted his own award-winning television talk show.  `It was a
lads' show really,' Jones notes, `It was based in a pub and we had a
live audience sort of thing.  I'd invite guests into the pub, three or
four at a time, to talk about football and women and magazines.'
And that's not the only acting experience on Jones' resume  he also
grappled with Stone Cold Steve Austin when the World Wrestling
Federation made a stop in London last December.  `I got in and knocked
him out and I had a couple of fights with The Bossman,' beams Jones,
also noting that there isn't much difference between acting in the WWF
and acting in feature film.
`My energy is going to be toward movies now,' Jones remarks, `If I get a
big enough part, I shall just hang the ol' boots up, I think.'  He has
played for such prestigious English clubs as Chelsea, Leeds, Sheffield
United and Wimbledon, the team he first signed with in 1986, giving up
his less glamorous job as a brick carrier.  He hasn't played since
November, when he was passed over for a coaching job at his last club,
Queens Park.  `I think the football part of my life is drawn to an end
and this (film) is another challenge I want to get on with.'
Jones couldn't have picked a better film for his debut; Lock, Stock was
a monster hit in England, earning the princely sum of $19.3 million on a
paltry $1.6 million budget.  Describing the reactions at screenings
during the Sundance Film Festival, Jones says the audience reaction `was
brilliant  it's been getting standing ovations.'  The film, best
described as a cross between Reservoir Dogs and Trainspotting, was the
only film that generated widespread excitement at Sundance.
Up next for Jones is writer/director Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock
follow-up, The Diamonds.  But the London Sunday Times reports that Jones
is in negotiations to play a British spy in the upcoming Tom Cruise
vehicle, Mission Impossible II.  `I haven't received any phone calls
about it, but you never know,' muses Jones. `I'm just an apprentice in
this business at the moment.  I just don't know how things work or
anything like that.  It's flattering to be even mentioned in that
context.'  Ironically, the same newspaper also reported that Cruise
plans to shoot an American version of Lock, Stock.
After The Diamonds, Jones says, `I don't really have any plans.  I'm
just going to see how this movie goes out here and see if we get any
offers of any other bigger movies.'  He reflects on his career by
stating, `It's fantastic.  I suppose it's any lad's dream to be a big
football player and then try the chance of being in movies.  I've done
this very much for a challenge, just for a change of direction and it's
all snowballed.'
We should all be so lucky in our careers.

Review for Traffic (2000)
It's really too bad that most people will think of Traffic as `that film
with Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones.'  While it's true that
the presence of the newlyweds could help the film in terms of its take
at the box office, it would be wrong to dismiss Traffic as a novelty
thrown on the screen simply to please Americans in search of new royalty
to worship (which is what Douglas and Zeta-Jones have become now that
all the good Kennedys are dead).  Besides, they never appear in one
scene together.
You wouldn't call American Beauty `that movie where Kevin Spacey jerks
off in the shower' or refer to Citizen Kane as `the thing with the guy
and the sled,' so don't do the same to Traffic.  And, yes  Traffic is
good enough to mention with films like Beauty and Kane.  It's also the
fourth film Steven Soderbergh has directed in less than three years (and
third in just over one year)  a pretty amazing feat, considering that
those films are four of the best that have been released over that same
period (Out of Sight, The Limey and Erin Brockovich).
Traffic comes at you with both barrels blazing (there aren't even any
opening credits to get in the way).  Within fifteen minutes, you'll be
introduced to about a dozen major characters as you're whisked along to
six different settings.  The film bounces between three different,
unrelated storylines that all have to do with drugs.
In Tijuana, Mexico, two state police officers  Javier Rodriguez
(Benicio Del Toro, The Way of the Gun) and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas,
Next Friday)  find themselves in the middle of a drug war between the
Obregón and Madrigal families.  Both men are honest (as much as a
Mexican cop can be) and are legitimately interested in stopping the flow
of drugs from Mexico to the United States.  Javier and Manolo even begin
taking orders from the shifty General Salazar (Tomas Milian, The Yards),
who also seems intent on fighting the war against drugs.
The second thread takes place in Cincinnati, Ohio, where State Supreme
Court Justice Robert Lewis (Douglas, Wonder Boys) has just been
appointed by the President to head the Office of the National Drug
Control Policy.  The country's new anti-drug czar doesn't have a clue
that his own daughter (Erika Christensen) freebases smack with her
prep-school classmate (Topher Grace, That 70s Show).
The final storyline takes place in and around San Diego, where a
big-fish dealer (Miguel Ferrer, Lateline) has just been busted by two
federal agents  Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle, Mission to Mars) and Ray
Castro (Luis Guzmán, OZ)  and turned over his bigger-fish boss in
exchange for immunity.  The boss (Steven Bauer, Primal Fear) is dragged
off to prison, while his pregnant wife (Zeta-Jones, Entrapment) tries to
deal with the surprise of finding out that her husband wasn't really in
the construction business after all.
Soderbergh, who also photographed the film (under the pseudonym Peter
Andrews), shot each of the three stories as differently as the U.S. and
Mexico handle the war on drugs (one country has meetings about the drug
problem, while the other breaks the law to combat it).  The Tijuana
story (which contains dialogue mostly in Spanish) is grainy, gritty and
dark, while the American threads are bright and glossy.  Most of Traffic
was filmed with Soderbergh wielding his own handheld camera, which gave
the film a more realistic look and enabled him to pull terrific
performances from each and every actor, some of whom may be competing
against other Soderbergh-directed actors (from Erin Brockovich) when the
award season rolls around.
It would be tough to pick a favorite story from Traffic, as each is done
so well and has unique elements to enjoy.  I loved the washed-out, Three
Kings look of the Tijuana story and thought that Del Toro gave the
film's best performance.  Newcomer Christensen was amazing as the
drugged-out National Merit finalist with a high-profile father (a la
Magnolia), and it was fun to see Zeta-Jones work her real-life pregnancy
into the part and to use her Welsh accent in a film for the first time.
The most enjoyable part of Traffic was realizing that there were no
heroes or clearly defined good guys to root for.
Like his other films, Soderbergh uses a wide variety of music in Traffic
 from Fatboy Slim to Brian Eno's haunting `An Ending (Ascent)' which
closes the film.  The score, written by Soderbergh regular Cliff
Martinez, was performed by (among others) Michael Brook, Herbie Hancock
and Flea (who is billed as `Master of the 4-String Electric Bassius
O'Phellius').  Traffic was filmed on location in Washington, D.C.,
Cincinnati, El Paso, Mexico, San Diego and even used one of the sets
from The West Wing.
Traffic was written by Rules of Engagement's Stephen Gaghan, who has
also penned episodes of The Practice and NYPD Blue.  His script was
adapted from a popular British television miniseries (called Traffik),
which starred Julia Ormond and focused on a drug route that flowed from
Pakistan to England.  The film has one of the largest casts I've ever
seen, including an unbilled performance from Salma Hayek and appearances
by several U.S. Senators, including Barbara Boxer and Orrin Hatch.
2:18  R for adult language, violence, teen drinking and drug use, brief
nudity, sexual content, and some frank sex talk

Title
Review for Goya (1999)
If you believe what you see in the movies, everyone who has ever picked
up a paintbrush is completely whacked out of their mind.  Henry Thomas'
character in Fever should have been locked up forever, and let's not
even talk about the messed-up Mafia art in Mickey Blue Eyes.  Films
based on real-life talents like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Jackson Pollock
aren't much different, showing artists as suffering, angst-ridden kooks
with a gift that ultimately consumes them.
Carlos Saura's Goya in Bordeaux is more of the same.  Spanish painter
Francisco de Goya, considered by many to be the greatest artist of the
modern era, is portrayed as an unhinged madman with a life full of
enough hallucinations to make Timothy Leary jealous.  One of the
continuing themes running through Goya's work was that humans are no
better than animals, a point driven home by the film's opening scene, in
which the bloody carcass of a bull dissolves into Goya's decrepit
82-year-old face.
Bordeaux shows two different Goyas  one young and vivacious (José
Coronado), and one old and out of his mind (Francisco Rabal).  The tales
of young Goya are shown in flashbacks as the older Goya bores his young
daughter (Daphne Fernández) with story after story of his glory days as
he rots away on his deathbed.
We see a young Goya hoping to one day become the court painter to
Spain's Charles IV but instead finding exile with other nationalists
after the liberal-stomping Ferdinand VII reclaimed his throne in 1814.
He fell in love with a beautiful Duchess (Maribel Verdú), and in his
40s, Goya went blind and found himself tormented by powerful headaches.
His work, which was always pretty dark, became even more disturbing.
The painter found himself haunted by both his troubling art and the
Duchess, who died because of her opposition to the Queen.
Bordeaux's story plays second fiddle to the film's amazing visuals,
which are as close as you can get to a Peter Greenaway film without
actually having Greenaway involved.  Armed with his extraordinary
cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro (Bulworth), Saura keeps the film
interesting with several unique cinematic devices, ranging from the use
of transparent wallpaper to having Goya's art coming to life before your
very eyes.  The film is highlighted by a recreation of Goya's series of
paintings called `Disasters of War,' which depicted Napoleon attacking
the Spanish.
It would have been one thing if Saura (Tango) made Bordeaux into a
plodding, two-plus-hour film, but it barely cracks the 90-minute mark 
just enough to hold my attention.  The film won several Goya Awards,
which are the Spanish equivalent of the Oscars.  Interestingly enough,
the American film Oscar did not win any Oscars.
1:39  R for some sexual content and violent imagery

Title
Review for Crazy/Beautiful (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
crazy/beautiful tries awfully hard not to be formulaic but fails miserably
in the process.  It's not like we haven't seen this story before - the whole
girl-falling-for-the-boy-she-isn't-supposed-to-love thing can be traced at
least as far back as Romeo and Juliet and as recently as Save the Last
Dance.  crazy is so similar to Dance - the story of a painfully white blonde
girl and dark-skinned boy from a poor neighborhood - that one critic has
already dubbed the film Save the Last Burrito, because, in this picture, the
boy is played by a Latino actor.
crazy's opening credits show us a collage of arty photographs (like Dance,
this cracker also has a creative outlet - photography) before we meet our
two romantic leads.  Carlos Nuńez (Jay Hernandez, MTV's Undressed) spots a
fair-haired cutie picking up trash as part of a community service sentence
for robbing a convenience store.  She is Nicole Oakley (Kirsten Dunst, Get
Over It), a classmate of Carlos' at the predominantly white Pacific High.
She lives in giant glass house overlooking the ocean; he lives in the barrio
and has to take a two-hour bus trip (uphill both ways) just to attend
Pacific.
But wait, there's more.  Nicole's neglectful father is a U.S. Congressman
(Bruce Davison, X-Men) and she's a real problem child.  Daddy can't seem to
get his bleary-eyed, belly-baring beauty to stop drinking, drugging, banging
loads of different guys, or mouthing off to her young stepmother (Lucinda
Jenney, Thirteen Days).  Meanwhile, Carlos is a football star with an Oscar
de la Hoya smile who plans on becoming a Navy pilot (even though he's never
stepped foot on a plane) and has a closet-sized bedroom (complete with bare
light bulb) as well as a very supportive family.  Get it?  It's a twist on
the typical good-girl-dating-the-boy-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks
story.
But wait, there's still more!  When Nicole and her dog-faced girlfriend
(Taryn Manning) drive Carlos back to the barrio for the first time, they
aren't all, like, "Oh my God - these street signs are all in Spanish!"
Instead, the girls hop out of the car and give a lap dance to each patron of
a taco cart.  When Nicole's dad gives Carlos the "Stay away from my
daughter" speech, he's not doing it because he's a racist - he's doing it
because he thinks his daughter is going to screw up this boy's obviously
bright future.
You know, if you really want to break the stereotypes found in these types
of films, do something drastic.  Make the guy the popular black quarterback
and the girl the slutty, pregnant daughter of a drunken crack whore.
Afflict one of them with AIDS.  Make one a serial killer.  Or at least have
a couple of the over-30 Latino females clock in under 300 pounds.  Even
though some of the specifics have changed, crazy is still the same-old
same-old.  If it's a hit, like Dance, you should expect to see a film where
a lily-white poet played by Kate Hudson falls for an Asian gangster played
by Rick Yune.
As bad as Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi's script is (they're both feature-film
rookies), crazy is made somewhat palatable by director John Stockwell, who
wrote and helmed the enjoyable HBO film Cheaters.  crazy is filled with
interesting shot composition and editing, often using nice montages to get
its tiresome point across.  The film also has a bunch of TRL-ready songs,
some of which are embarrassingly effective.  But it's all easily forgotten
by the laughable ending.
Hernandez does well in what should be a breakout role.  Dunst is a great
actress, and she gets a couple of scenes to show off her chops here, but if
you compare any of her weepy drug-addled rants to Traffic's Erika
Christensen, they just don't measure up.
1:35 - PG-13 for mature thematic material involving teens, drug/alcohol
content, sexuality & language

Title
Review for Down to You (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Last January, Miramax struck gold with a teen comedy based on the tale
of `Pygmalion.'  She's All That opened to decent reviews and an amazing
$16 million, eventually taking in over $63 million as well as garnering
two MTV Movie Award nominations.  That starred up-and-comers Freddie
Prinze, Jr. and that girl from the anti-heroin commercial that smashes
the egg with the frying pan.
Firm believers that lightning can strike twice, Miramax is back with a
new January teen comedy with Prinze.  The film, Down to You, is
refreshing in the fact that it places its young stars in college rather
than the typical high school setting.  But in doing so, it tries to be
too adult and comes off as a failed attempt at making Annie Hall for the
Gen-Y crowd.  The film also suffers from both a really bad set-up and a
complete lack of a proper ending.
You opens with aspiring chef Al Connelly (Prinze, Wing Commander) in a
New York coffee shop.  As he watches a young couple pawing at each
other, Al explains his story of true love.  He does this by delivering
his lines right into the camera, which makes the whole thing seem like a
hemorrhoid commercial.  So the whole film is a flashback, being told by
Al as he waits in line to get a double mocha latte.
Al launches into the tale of how he first met the girl of his dreams,
which is one of the more bizarre tales I can recall in a mainstream
movie.  He's in a seedy bar with his two pals Eddie and Monk (Shawn
Hatosy, Outside Providence, and Zak Orth, Snow Falling on Cedars), who
are arguing about their sexual stamina.  Monk is a well-endowed rising
star in the porn world and Eddie thinks he has both the girth and vigor
to break into the business as well.  A bet is made involving a bar slag
(Rosario Dawson, Light it Up) and, as a result, Al is left without a bed
for the evening.  When the college sophomore complains about his lack of
sleeping accommodations, Monk points Al toward a wispy freshman that, of
course, turns out to be Ms. Right.
The babe is Imogen (Julia Stiles, 10 Things I Hate About You)  not
Imogene  a first-year student interesting in pursuing an arts career.
She's gorgeous until she opens her mouth, revealing a voice like a
forty-year-old and a maw full of crooked, yellow-tinted fangs.  It
sounds like she's had a three-pack-a-day habit since kindergarten, which
would explain her discolored teeth.  The two hit it off way too easily
and before long Al is introducing Imogen to his television chef dad
(Henry Winkler, The Waterboy) and disc jockey mom (Lucie Arnaz).  I
wonder what the late Freddie Prinze, Sr. would think of  the Fonz
playing his kids screen pop.
As expected, their relationship momentarily turns sour when Imogen
spends a summer in France, but don't worry  things work out.  The
structure of the film is of bigger concern, namely when the two
lovebirds flashback to their first kisses and high school squeezes.  Can
you flashback within a flashback?  Then there is the equally troubling
moment when Imogen starts to co-narrate the film with Al.  How's that
work?  You can't just jump in and hijack the voice-over.  Al is clearly
the main character in the film, so butt out.
You is the feature film debut of Kris Isacsson, an assistant to Barbra
Streisand for The Mirror has Two Faces.  Isacsson also wrote the
screenplay, which features some pretty frank sexual dialogue for a PG-13
film.  Also of note is the fact that the characters are rarely without a
drink in their hands, despite the fact that they're all underage.  Also
look for the hilarious Ashton Kutcher (Kelso from That 70s Show) who
plays a guy named Jim Morrison.
1:40  PG-13 for adult language, sexual content and underage drinking

Title
Review for Pokémon 3: The Movie (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The Pokémon marketing folks are Einstein-caliber geniuses.  First, they
hypnotize kids with flashing, seizure-inducing lights which turn them into
sticky little zombies that "Gotta Catch 'em All" (meaning collect the cards
for each Pokémon character, of which there are hundreds).  Then they rush a
cheaply made film into theatres every six months which introduces a handful
of new characters and means more "catching" for your brainwashed offspring.
But the smartest thing they may have done is to release three horrendously
bad films so close together.  This move has left critics wringing their
hands, as they have already used every possible creative way to say the
first two films sucked.  Lucky for you, I've scraped the bottom of the
barrel and still have a few left.  How bad is Pokémon 3?  It's
rub-hot-sauce-on-your-genitals bad. It's turn-your-head-and-cough bad.  It's
George-W.-Bush-is-our-President bad.
That said, Pokémon 3 is probably the best of the three Pokémon films  Sure,
that's kind of like debating whether Wrestlemania VI or Wrestlemania IX was
better, but hey - it's a step in the right direction.  Like the previous
two, it begins with what is, essentially, an unaired episode of the
television show.  This time it's "Pikachu and Pichu," where everyone's
favorite yellow squeak toy and all his pals take a trip to The Big City (a
name is never offered).  They get chased by a rabid Pokédog and saved by two
new characters, the Pichu brothers.  There's also some cheesy narration,
because without it, nobody would have a clue what was going on - as I'm sure
you all know, Pokémon don't talk.
The film proper, titled "Spell of the Unknown," is about a little girl named
Molly, whose father is a well-known hunter of legendary Pokémon.  One day,
he disappears when discovering some odd little Scrabble tiles called "The
Unown."  Molly tries to unlock the secret of The Unown, but instead ends up
having the strange tiles read her mind and build a fantasy world around her.
It's a pretty decent intro, but then Ash and the other Pokémon trainers show
up and bring with them a bunch of bad songs and more squeak toys than you
can shake a stick at.  Ash and company try to stop the legendary Pokémon
named Enteimon (also the producer of delicious baked goods available at fine
stores everywhere), who is the force responsible for creating Molly's crazy
new city.
Of course, there are numerous Pokémon battles, and you'll get to see your
favorite little critters, like Duckémon, Catémon, Squirrelémon, Batémon,
Rockémon and Bonémon.  And there are a slew of new characters, as well.  So
adults - get ready to open your wallets.  The best part of Pokémon 3 is
Ash's friend Brock, who doesn't open his eyes for the entire film.  At one
point, when the Pokégang meet a girl named Lisa, Brock tells her she's got a
cute Pokémon.  C'mon, Brock - she's no Judy Jetson.  And this is a kids'
film.  Please keep it in your pants.

Title
Review for Up at the Villa (2000)
Hold on to your hats  Philip and Belinda Haas have made another dull
and slow-moving film.  Their latest is based on a W. Somerset Maugham
novella, which was directed by Philip and adapted for the screen by
Belinda, the duo responsible for the snore-fests Angels & Insects and
The Blood Oranges.
The setting may sound familiar - pre-World War II Florence at that time
when things are just beginning to get a bit uncomfortable for English
citizens living in Italy.  But this is no Tea With Mussolini.  Possibly
Crumpets With Clara (as in Peracci  Mussolini's mistress), but even
that would be pushing it.  I don't know where it's written that all
period pictures have to include at least one ballroom dancing scene that
features fancy chandeliers, ladies in long, white gloves and men in
tails and top hats.  Just once, I'd like to see a film that leaves this
scene out.  Or at least postpones it for the first thirty or forty
minutes.  Here, it's Villa's first scene.
Villa stars Kristin Scott Thomas (Random Hearts) as Mary Panton, a
widowed Brit freeloading in Florence (that would have been a better
title as well).  She hobnobs with society's upper crust, thanks to a
friendship with gossipy Princess San Ferdinando (Anne Bancroft, Keeping
the Faith), and even has a potential beau in Sir Edgar Swift (James
Fox, Mickey Blue Eyes).  He's the kind of uptight Englishman that seems
like he's got a pole jammed where the sun don't shine, and he requests
Mary's hand in marriage as if he just asked her to pass the Grey
Poupon.  Sir Edgar is also the Governor of Bengal, so Mary would be set
financially and socially for life.
Right off the bat, allow me to suggest two ways that Villa could have
been better.  First, they could have cast Jaime Foxx instead of James
Fox.  Now that's already more interesting.  Second, they could have made
his role as the Governor of Bengal involve wearing a rainbow-colored wig
at all of Cincinnati's home football games.
Anyway, Mary doesn't love Sir Edgar but will probably marry him
regardless.  Then she meets a randy American named Rowley Flint (Sean
Penn, Sweet and Lowdown) and confides her situation to him one evening
after a party.  Mary is obviously attracted to Rowley, but gives him a
fresh one when he tells her not to marry Sir Edgar and then tries to put
the moves on her.
Instead, Mary has a one-night fling with an Austrian refugee violin
player (Jeremy Davies, Ravenous) that ends up offing himself in a
particularly lackluster scene that I'm sure was supposed to be
suspenseful.  Mary and Rowley ditch the body and almost get caught,
which made me think that Villa had one more chance to redeem itself by
turning into Weekend at Bernie's Villa.  But, of course, it doesn't.
It's just too happy being miserably boring instead.  And who would have
thought that this role would have been more embarrassing for Bancroft
than Keeping the Faith?
1:55  PG-13 for light sexual content and mild violence

Title
Review for Godzilla (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Let me make this point first  Godzilla isn't even as good as the
inferior South Park episode starring Barbra Streisand as the lizard
king.  It's a horrendously long, poorly acted, unoriginal piece of crap
that made me sad to be a Japanese-American.
Brought to you by the creative team responsible for the reprehensible
but slightly more entertaining Independence Day, Godzilla breaks
virtually no new ground in terms of mayhem, destruction or disaster.
You've seen it all before  giant reptile running through a major city
(The Lost World: Jurassic Park), doing the breaststroke (Alien
Resurrection) and multiplying like a bunny (Gremlins).  Mix it up with
some of the most obvious product placement scenes ever and you've got
yourself one hell of a condemnable snoozer.
Can I mention the glaring omission of people being chomped up by the
great beast?  Why bother giving him sharp pointy teeth if he ain't gonna
use humans for chew toys?  They've made Godzilla into such a PC/PG panty
waste, that if he ever did show up on Manhattan, the kids would want to
hug it instead of running away in terror.  Barney is actually a more
offensive creature, albeit on a completely different level.
Yeah, the beginning is all right and the ending is OK, but what the hell
happened to the 90 minutes in the middle?  I guess the filmmakers felt
that they needed an opportunity to showcase the fantastic story and
Oscar caliber acting.  It's certainly understandable, since most people
are paid to see Maria Pitillo and not the actual monster.
Maybe I was expecting too much originality.  I mean if I made this film,
I would have had Godzilla dry humping buildings, taking a huge dump into
Yankee Stadium, using Patrick Ewing as a toothpick and cramming subway
cars up its ass.  But that's just me.  I like things dark.
And as if that wasn't enough recycling, just wait until the closing
credits where Puff Daddy shuffles all over Led Zeppelin's `Kashmir'.  A
perfect ending to a perfectly boring film.

Title
Review for Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)
There's something admirable about a film that manages to entertain
despite not making any sense at all.  As you sit through films like Gone
in 60 Seconds, your brain practically screams, `Get up and leave before
you rot me away!' but the message never quite makes it down to your
feet.  Somewhere in between your head and toes, something happens that
makes you sit there with a dopey grin on your face for two hours before
getting up and admitting `Geez, that was pretty good.'  Personally, I
blame the sneaky epiglottis for intercepting the brain's warning
message, but I have no concrete proof of this.
Seconds is about a retired car thief named Randall "Memphis" Raines
(Nicolas Cage, Bringing Out the Dead) who is temporarily drafted back
into a life of crime when his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi,
Boiler Room) ends up in hot water with a local bad ass with an English
accent and a fetish for handcrafted wooden furniture.  The Brit is
Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston, eXistenZ), and he turns down
Memphis' offer of $10,000 for Kip, instead making the older Raines
brother agree to boost fifty specific automobiles in four days to
prevent him from becoming an only child.
It doesn't take long to set up the film's premise (about fifteen
minutes), and I settled back in my seat under the assumption that I was
in for a good hour-and-a-half of car boosting and the hilarious hijinks
attendant thereto.  But Seconds doesn't go down like that.  While the
bottom of the screen reminds viewers that there are only seventy-two
hours remaining in Memphis' deadline, he has a touchy-feely breakfast
with Kip.  Wait a second.  Kip?  Why the heck would Calitri let Kip go?
Couldn't he just skip town with Memphis and his $10,000 and leave
Calitri and the car-jacking business behind them?
Memphis blows the next few days visiting his mom (Grace Zabriskie, Twin
Peaks) and trying to put together a team of top-notch car thieves.  He
starts with the man that taught him everything he knows: former
chop-shop owner Otto Halliwell (Robert Duvall, A Civil Action).
Together, Memphis and Otto complete the rest of their lawbreaking
lineup.  The ranks include a mechanic/bartender named Sara "Sway"
Wayland (Angelina Jolie, Girl, Interrupted), a mute morgue attendant
called `The Sphinx' (Vinnie Jones, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels),
and a driving instructor named Donny Astricky (Chi McBride, Mercury
Rising).  Memphis also reluctantly agrees to let Kip's gang assist in
the heist.  The Gen-Y brigands include Scott Caan  (Ready to Rumble),
James Duval (Go), T.J. Cross and William Lee Scott (Black & White).
Memphis and his criminal comrades plan to steal all fifty cars in one
twelve-hour period.  And not just any twelve-hour period, but, of
course, the twelve-hour period immediately before the deadline (I
shouldn't complain  I waited until the morning of my 12th grade English
class to write my final thesis, even though I had months to complete the
project).  To make matters worse, Memphis and crew are being pursued by
two cops (Delroy Lindo, Romeo Must Die, and Timothy Olyphant, Go), as
well as a rival gang of car thieves that actually complained that
Memphis stole the fifty-car job out from under them.  
Okay, let me get this straight:  They're willing to do Calitri's heist,
but he insists on using a rusty ex-thief and his band of miscreants
instead?
You know that the heist is going to go down to the wire, which begs the
question `Why didn't they start earlier?'  There's the mandatory chase
through the L.A. River Aqueduct (which, at this point, is used only for
filming Hollywood chase scenes), and the big shoot-em-up action finale
is so ridiculously unbelievable that I couldn't help laughing out loud.
And don't get up and leave when the big chase scene is over, because
you'll miss Jones' hysterical, out-of-the-blue line, which is probably
the best since Alyson Hannigan's `One time, in band camp' confession in
American Pie.
There are so many things in Seconds that just don't make sense, and I'm
not sure I even have the space to list all of them here.  Like when the
bandits break into a warehouse full of about fifty rare, expensive cars,
and the five that they need to boost are all lined up behind one another
for easy removal.  And how do you explain that each thief gets back out
on the streets after they drop off the car they've just stolen?  Seconds
isn't even sure what city it's supposed to take place in, mentioning
Long Beach several times, but filming multiple scenes in San Francisco
in addition to the Los Angeles suburb.
Seconds is also full of all of the spastic editing, plot-holes and lack
of female characters that you come to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer
(Armageddon) produced summer blockbuster.  In addition to inciting the
audience to root against the police and for the criminals, Seconds also
features a couple of pretty bad racial stereotypes (black people can't
swim and Asian women can't drive).
Seconds was directed by Dominic Sena (Kalifornia) and written by Scott
Rosenberg (ConAir), who adapted the script from a little-seen 1974 H.B.
Halicki film of the same name (it spawned a sequel called The Junkman
eight years later).  Despite its many flaws, Seconds is still worth the
price of admission just for the unique and diverse casting, which
includes big-name stars, regulars in independent cinema, a British
soccer star and  get this  three Oscar winners (Cage, Jolie and
Duvall).

Review for Gladiator (2000)
Until now, Hollywood hadn't made an Ancient Roman epic in my lifetime.
And they may as well not attempt another, because I can't see them
creating a better one than Gladiator.  Director Ridley Scott's (G.I.
Jane) unique visual stamp  from the colorless studio logos for
Dreamworks and Universal at the beginning, to the startling, dream-like
ending  has crafted a real winner, firmly establishing Gladiator as
2000's first genuine blockbuster.
Gladiator takes place at the tail end of the second century, where the
Roman Empire controls much of existence.  With one more campaign
remaining to bring peace to this vast empire, General Maximus (Russell
Crowe, The Insider) leads his troops into battle in the woods of
Germania against a group of barbarians in the winter of 180 A.D.  Before
giving the signal to begin the skirmish, Maximus bends down to scoop up
a handful of dirt, which he rubs into his hands and smells, before
uttering the wonderful line, `At my signal, unleash Hell.'  And
thankfully the way he says it isn't totally over the top, like a
Stallone or a Schwarzenegger.  The battle scene is as well done as
Braveheart, but darker, muddier, foggier, and probably more akin to The
13th Warrior.
After annihilating the barbarians, Maximus is summoned by the current
Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris, Smilla's Sense of Snow), who
is dying and expresses his desire for the well-respected General to take
over his throne.  Despite wanting only to return to his farm, wife and
young son, Maximus reluctantly agrees.  The news of the Emperor's
appointment doesn't sit well with Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, 8mm), who
is Marcus Aurelius' only son.
Without divulging too many surprises, I'll just say that a bunch of
stuff happens.  Now Marcus Aurelius is dead, Commodus rules the Empire,
and Maximus is a slave purchased by a former gladiator named Proximo
(the late Oliver Reed, who died before filming ended), along with Juba
(Djimon Hounsou, Amistad) and Hagen (former Mr. Universe Ralph
Moeller).  Proximo plans to enter his new slaves in fight-to-the-death
battles that will entertain the masses.
Maximus isn't the biggest soldier or the strongest soldier, but like
Braveheart's William Wallace, Maximus is the perfect combination of
heart and head, with an ample dose of hell-bent revenge tossed in for
good measure.  Together with Juba and Hagen, he plows through local
competition, smelling dirt and fighting his way to the top like Rocky,
eventually earning the right to battle before 50,000 in Rome.  This, of
course, give Maximus the perfect opportunity to get close to Commodus
and, potentially, to settle the score.
Crowe is fantastic as Maximus and, for the twenty-nine people that
actually saw his Oscar-nominated turn in The Insider, you won't see even
a trace of Jeffrey Wigand here.  The biggest surprise is Phoenix, who
turns in a respectably strong performance as the picture-perfect,
sneering antagonist.  Gladiator was filmed in Morocco and Malta, and was
written by John Logan (Any Given Sunday), William Nicholson (Nell) and
co-producer David H. Franzoni (Amistad).  The film was brilliantly
photographed by John Mathieson (Plunkett & Macleane, which was directed
by Scott's son Jake) and edited by Oscar-winner Pietro Scalia (JFK). The
unobtrusive score is from another Oscar-winner - Hans Zimmer (The Lion
King), and the marvelous sets and costumes, which reminded me a lot of
the World War II look in Titus, were designed by Arthur Max (Se7en) and
Janty Yates (Plunkett & Macleane), respectively.

Review for Kirikou et la sorcičre (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2000 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you're tired of the crappy children's films that Hollywood keeps
cramming down your throat, check out these two gems from French
filmmaker Michel Ocelot - the most happening animator this side of Nick
Park and Aardman Studios (Chicken Run).  Ocelot's films are uniquely
animated and offer stories fresh enough to make the typical Disney film
seem like two-week-old bread.
Ocelot first became recognized in 1999 with a film called Kirikou and
the Sorceress, a wonderful adaptation of an African folktale. You know
Kirikou isn't the typical kiddie pic from its first scene, which depicts
a pregnant woman hearing her unborn child shout, "Mother - bring me into
the world!" Before you know it, the infant has bolted out of his
mother's womb, cut his own umbilical cord and begins to run around,
announcing to everyone within earshot that he is Kirikou.
But Kirikou quickly finds out that life on the outside isn't all it's
cracked up to be.  His father and most of his uncles have been eaten
trying to battle an evil sorceress and her robotic henchmen.  Despite
the sorceress' winning streak, Kirikou's last remaining uncle is on his
way to try his luck at knocking her block off.  Little Kirikou tags
along and is mistaken for a magic hat.
A battle ensues between the sorceress and Kirikou's village, with the
wicked woman setting various traps to capture the village's children.
She's a crafty sorceress, using a magic boat, a malevolent tree and a
wild boar (a la Princess Mononoke).
Although Kirikou plays well with most adults, it may not be a film for
your kids if you're concerned about cartoon nudity.  All of the female
characters are topless, and most boast an impressive, perky D-cup.  At
times, Kirikou looks like Howard Stern's dream come true as opposed to a
children's film, but if you're willing to overlook that very minor
problem, you'll find a gem of a film with important lessons that the
whole family will enjoy.
Ocelot's latest film - Princes and Princesses - offers more of the same
distinctive animation, but divides itself into six different sections,
which are held together with an interesting narrative.  Two children and
an adult sit in a dark studio and dream up ideas to turn into animated
shorts (there's no evidence confirming Ocelot developed his ideas in a
similar manner).  The three characters are silhouetted and use crazy,
magical equipment to develop their simple ideas into grand spectacles.
Each segment is set in a different time and place in history and, as the
title suggests, contains either a prince, a princess, or both.  The
stories, which are completely different and unrelated to each other, are
repetitive, like a children's book, and involve Egyptian fig trees, 19th
century Japanese coats and humans turning into ants.  There's even a
funny intermission about halfway through Princes that tells the audience
to take "a one-minute break to talk things over."  And each is packed
full of Ocelot's distinctive animation and thought-provoking morals,
which will thrill viewers of all ages.
Kirikou  1:17  Not rated, but includes a lot of cartoon boob action
Princes  1:10  Not Rated, and contains no objectionable material

Review for Panic (2000)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"
 ŠCopyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
`Do you ever get the feeling you're dead?'  That's the first line in
Henry Bromell's Panic, and it's uttered by an upper-middle-class man in
the throes of a midlife crisis.  Sounds a little like the beginning of
American Beauty, eh?  If you think that's bad, wait until you learn that
the character is also a killer-for-hire who visits a shrink.  Now
there's something we haven't seen in a while.
Thankfully, Panic isn't just a derivative knockoff of Beauty or the
whole shrink/hitman thing from Analyze This and The Sopranos.  While the
film's characters are pretty decently fleshed out, and its story follows
a fairly predictable trajectory, Panic's real drawing card is its
fantastic cast.  Each turns in great performances that keep the film
interesting and fresh, despite the fact its content was lifted from the
day-old rack at the Hollywood Food Market.
William H. Macy (State and Main) plays Alex, unhappy husband to Martha
(Tracey Ullman, Small Time Crooks) and father to precocious six-year-old
Sammy (David Dorfman, Bounce).  Alex has two jobs  one running a
moderately successful mail-order business from his home, and the other
as a contract killer for his father (Donald Sutherland, Space Cowboys).
It's the latter that lands him on the couch of Dr. Josh Parks (John
Ritter, Felicity).
Alex tells Dr. Parks about meeting a girl named Sarah (Neve Campbell,
Scream 3) who doesn't make him feel dead.  Coincidentally, he met Sarah
while waiting in Dr. Parks' waiting room (never a good place to pick up
women, if you ask me).  Alex explains that he was instantly smitten with
Sarah, and that the no-nonsense bisexual eventually fell in love with
his wonderfully sad eyes.
Dr. Parks bolsters Alex's confidence to stand up to his overbearing
father, who simply refuses to believe that his only son wants to quit
the family business.  When Alex receives a photograph of his next
target, it sends him reeling.  His life is truly at a crossroads.  Does
he choose his supportive wife, or the hot manic chick?  Mail-order or
contract killing?  Wouldn't we all like to have choices like these to
make?
Bromell, an executive producer for Northern Exposure and Homicide, makes
his feature-film writing and directorial debuts with Panic, with the
latter easily outclassing the former.  He cleverly uses flashbacks to a
series of firsts in Alex's life (first encounters with Martha, Dr. Parks
and Sarah, first firearms lesson from his father, first professional
hit) to bring us into the character's life.  The scenes featuring Alex
and little Sammy are touching and done rather well.
With this role, Campbell displays talent we haven't seen since the first
two seasons of Party of Five.  It's really nice to see Ullman doing
something where I don't want to choke the shit out of her (read:  not
playing multiple, unfunny characters), and what can you say about Macy?
He turns in another typically incredible performance as Alex  a bit of
a cross between his `Quiz Kid' Donnie Smith from Magnolia and Jerry
Lundegaard from Fargo.

Review for Jurassic Park III (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
The press notes for Jurassic Park 3 proudly trumpet the fact that there are
as many new dinosaurs in the new sequel as there were in the first two films
combined. While that may sound impressive, it simply means that the
filmmakers are concerned only with giving viewers more of the same instead
of trying something new.  I guess you could say they're sticking to the old
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it" adage, considering the first film was, at
the time, the highest-grossing picture ever and its first sequel still holds
the record for the biggest opening weekend in history.
But bigger budgets and projected box-office grosses don't stop JP3 from
being a by-the-numbers action flick with a decent cast and impressive
special effects.  A drop-off in quality from the first to the second was
noticeable, as it is from the second to the third, but it probably has much
more to do with the fact that it's the only film not based on a Michael
Crichton novel, rather than Steven Spielberg's move from the director's
chair to an executive-producing credit.
Sam Neill (The Dish) reprises his role as Dr. Alan Grant, a dinosaur expert
who believes raptors are much smarter than anyone had previously thought,
and even believes the creatures are capable of speech (apparently, this guy
has never heard an interview with Dell Curry).  With funding for his
research project running short, Grant reluctantly accepts a strange offer
from a rich, thrill-seeking couple (William H. Macy, State and Main, and Téa
Leoni, The Family Man) that wants to fly over Isla Sorna and have Mr.
Dinosaur point things out to them.
Guess what?  Things go horribly wrong.  Members of the group are shed like
so many layers of clothing (following the Brother Rule, of course) and,
before long, JP3 starts with the running and the screaming and the, "Oh,
God, it hurts."  Anybody else tired of seeing characters picked off in
reverse order of their popularity?  In no way do I recognize Deep Blue Sea
as an example of a good action film, but it was pretty damn surprising when
Sammy Jackson got swallowed up by that shark.  Don't look for any surprises
here.
Grant, his assistant Billy (Alessandro Nivola, Time Code), and the Kirbys
are repeatedly split up into various groups, creeping around the island like
the Scooby gang before meeting one last time for what appears to be a Cape
Fear spoof.  Sure, they've got two new dinosaurs after them - the flying
Pteranodon and swimming Spinosaurus - but we know everyone crucial to a
possible Jurassic Park 4 will make it off the island with most of their
limbs intact.
JP3 is so heavy on action that it didn't really need dialogue.  Thankfully,
Grant never utters typical sequel lines, such as anything that came out of
Brendan Fraser's mouth in The Mummy Returns or Danny Glover's in any of the
Lethal Weapon sequels.  Give that credit to Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor
(Election), who polished the script by debut scribe Peter Buchman.
JP3 was directed by October Sky's Joe Johnston, who is no stranger to
high-tech films which feature giant creatures (he also helmed the
animal-laden Jumanji).  While the film is technically seamless and a great
way to blow 90 minutes, its complete lack of story greatly diminishes the
effects of JP3's amazing visuals.  Maybe we're spoiled by the technology of
the 21st century, but humans running away from dinosaurs isn't nearly as
entertaining as it was in the '90s.

Title
Review for Stardom (2000)
Denys Arcand's latest film is a somewhat fascinating look at stardom and
fame, as well as the silliness of professional modeling.  But the fact
that Stardom fixes a cynical magnifying glass on these show business
buffoons isn't what makes the film interesting.  Arcand's film, which
shows the rise and fall of a teenage supermodel, is shown entirely
through clips of television shows, telethons, news reports and talk
shows.
This gimmicky concept reminded me of `Fan Mail,' a Ronald Munson novel
about a psychopath stalking a female newscaster.  The book wasn't
particularly interesting, or well-written, but the draw was that the
story was narrated entirely by e-mail, faxes, letters and memos. Stardom
is the film equivalent of `Fan Mail.'
Even more interesting than Stardom's unique narrative structure is the
fact that it was the closing night film at Cannes and the opening night
film at Toronto's festival.  Both events pack in celebrities like
nobody's business, and the famous seemed to react quite positively to
the film, even though it pretty much portrayed the lot of them as
gluttonous morons.  Go figure.
Newcomer Jessica Paré stars as Tina Menzhal, a comely cross between Liv
Tyler and Ione Skye, who, as the film opens, is a frizzy-haired woman's
hockey player in Cornwall, Ontario.  Through a series of freaky
coincidences, a photograph of Tina lands in the right pair of hands, and
she literally wakes up to a life of fame and celebrity.
Tina's new modeling career whisks her off to New York, Paris and Milan,
where she rubs elbows with pretentious personalities at trendy
restaurants, goofy celebrity events and fundraisers, all of which are
recorded by various media sources.  She doesn't seem to mind that
interviewers never let her finish a sentence, or when they refer to her
as having been `raised in the wilderness.'  Tina begins a series of
affairs with older men that she would never find herself attracted to
(like Dan Aykroyd, Diamonds, and Frank Langella, The Ninth Gate).
But, like any star devoid of talent, Tina's career begins to bottom
out.  It's predictable and uninteresting, aside from the fact that the
very cameras that made her famous are also being used to record her
downfall.  More appealing is the effect of Tina on Aykroyd's character,
which plays as a new cinematic lesson for skirt-chasing men in the midst
of a midlife crisis.
Arcand (Jesus of Montreal), who co-wrote Stardom's script with newcomer
Jacob Potashnik, does an admirable job of piecing together the different
media sources into a (somewhat) coherent film.  But the film, which has
the vibe of a VH-1 original movie, or something made for E! Television,
just goes on for too long.  It would have been nice as an 80-minute
picture, but Stardom stretches Tina's 15 minutes of fame into a nearly
two-hour film.

Review for Saving Silverman (2001)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
There are many talented actors and actresses who remain relatively unknown
despite logging one memorable, scene-stealing performance after another.
Even though they may have more talent than household names like Kevin
Costner and Sandra Bullock, these fine performers remain nameless to most
moviegoers, who instead know them only by outrageous things their characters
have done.
Take Jason Biggs. He's not recognized as being an up-and-coming comedic
actor - he's the kid who fucked the pastry in American Pie. Mention the name
Amanda Peet, and people shrug their shoulders. But if you say "the girl who
took off her top in The Whole Nine Yards," everybody knows who you're
talking about. Ditto for Jack Black - the fat guy who worked in the record
store in High Fidelity. Steve Zahn doesn't even have a memorable moment, but
has had roles in a bunch of terrific films, like Out of Sight, Happy, Texas
and Hamlet.
Toss these actors into the same weakly written film, and you get Saving
Silverman, a sporadically entertaining picture that will appeal to the Adam
Sandler crowd. It's no coincidence, since director Dennis Dugan also helmed
Sandler's Big Daddy and Happy Gilmore. The film's formula will seem familiar
to viewers who have seen any comedy that the uptight crowd refers to as
"appealing to the lowest common denominator." It goes a little something
like this - sight gag, pratfall, dick joke, double-take, cleavage shot,
repeat as (un)necessary.
Silverman's story focuses on three lifelong Seattle friends who, as shown in
the first few minutes of the film, have gone from being nerdy kids to nerdy
adults with kooky jobs. Darren Silverman (Biggs) is the entertainment
director at a local nursing home. Buddies Wayne (Zahn) and J.D. (Black) are,
respectively, a rodent exterminator and a Subway employee. The trio also
perform in a Neil Diamond cover band, so it goes without saying that none of
 them are exactly chick magnets.
But that all changes when Darren meets Judith (Peet), a beautiful
psychologist hell-bent on finding a naďve man who can be molded into her
idea of perfection. She's a controlling bitch-on-wheels who forbids Darren
from seeing his pals, and, to make matters worse, she doesn't put out. Wayne
and J.D. know they need to do something drastic to save Darren from the
devious dish, and hatch a plan to kidnap Judith, stage her death and fix
Darren up with his old flame (Amanda Detmer), a shapely, soon-to-be-nun from
a family of circus performers. Seriously.
There are a lot of legitimately funny moments in Silverman, but, as usual,
you can see most of them in trailer. There are also appearances by Neil
Diamond and Kyle Gass, the latter of whom is half of Black's acoustic heavy
metal duo, Tenacious D. Also worth noting is the name of Zahn's character
(he played Wayne Wayne Wayne, Jr. in Happy Texas) and the fact that the film
mentions Hannibal Lecter (Silverman opens the same weekend as Hannibal).
As far as the acting performances go, you'd think these stars would be above
this kind of baloney (you'd never see Philip Seymour Hoffman making a film
like this). They're all very likeable actors, and they probably add much
more life to their characters than what was written in the silly script
(written by Hank Nelken and Greg DePaul). While their talent is largely
wasted here, it's scary to think about how bad Silverman would have been
without them.

Title
Review for Battlefield Earth (2000)
My thesaurus lists several synonyms for the word `dumb,' but I've
crossed them all out and printed just two words in their place:
"Battlefield Earth."  This film adaptation of L. Ron Hubbard's
best-selling 1982 sci-fi book is just as silly as the religion he
created, and it probably never would have been made if it weren't for
the constant lobbying by the film's star/producer (and raging
Scientologist) John Travolta.
Comparisons to Planet of the Apes will be inevitable, but Earth comes
off as more of an ill-conceived cross between the 1984 Brat Pack film
Red Dawn and Styx's concept album `Killroy Was Here.'  It's a
heavy-handed good-versus-evil story that is poorly directed, poorly
written, poorly acted and plays like a movie made for 2:00 AM viewing on
basic cable rather than the summer blockbuster season.  The best
description of the film I've seen is as follows: `Give Ed Wood a $100
million budget, and you get Battlefield Earth.'
Earth is set in the year 3000 (it's actually subtitled A Saga of the
Year 3000), where a sadistic alien race from the planet Psychlos has
taken over Earth and wiped out most of its inhabitants.  Terl (Travolta,
The General's Daughter) is the Psychlo Security Director of Earth who,
as the film opens, finds out that his proposed transfer back to Psychlos
has been postponed for several years.  Terl has a sidekick named Ker
(Forest Whitaker, Ghost Dog), who looks like a melange of The Next
Generation's Worf and the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz.
Meanwhile, Johnnie (Barry Pepper, The Green Mile), one of Earth's few
remaining humans, decides he's fed up with living in fear of the
Psychlos and rides horseback to what used to be Denver to confront the
aliens head-on.  Johnnie is immediately captured by Terl, who tries to
use the spunky young Earthling to mine gold in an area of the planet
containing radioactive air that is deadly for Psychlos.
What unfolds is a predictably conventional story of the meek inheriting
the Earth  literally.  With a story this unimaginative, you would
expect some decent, over-the-top violence, or at least cutting-edge
special effects, but Earth offers neither.  Instead, the film attempts
to be inventive by shooting every scene off-kilter and using a
completely annoying dissolve from the center of the screen as a
transition between scenes.  Some of Earth's dialogue is bad enough to
induce mock laughter and applause from the audience, MST3K-style.
Travolta is just plain silly in the role he's been waiting his whole
life to play.  His Terl kind of sounds like Stewie on The Family Guy 
another person with an oddly-shaped head and, in a harmlessly evil kind
of way, ambitions beyond his means.  The cackling Terl and his alien
cohorts all look like Coneheads with dreadlocks and disgusting
baked-bean teeth (Travolta's wife, Kelly Preston makes a brief cameo and
has perfect white choppers).  I'd like to comment on the other actors in
the film, but Earth is one of those pictures where you're not sure what
anybody's name is.  And to make matters worse, Earth only covers half of
Hubbard's 1,000-plus page novel.  The filmmakers plan on releasing a
sequel in two years.
Much has and will be said about the similarities between Earth and
Scientology.  Travolta swears one has nothing to do with the other, but
he's as honest with himself as anybody else that's this into their
religion. Scientologists believe that psychiatrists are responsible for
the majority of evil in the world, so it's no coincidence that the bad
guys in the film (and Hubbard's book) are called Psychlos.  I have a lot
more to say about Scientology but won't, as their figureheads have a
tendency to sue people that don't think Hubbard hung the moon.  Some
people have even accused Scientologists of inserting subliminal messages
into Earth.  Don't worry  if they did, I'm sure that I would have liked
it a lot more.  Or, at least, I would have 
cluckcluckcluck.

Review for Superstar (1999)
Let's face it  films based on sketches from Saturday Night Live have a
really bad rap.  People have major problems with the concept of a
once-funny skit that's been driven into the ground for three or four
years being stretched into a 90-minute movie.  And who could blame
them?  But if you look closer at the list of skits-turned-films that SNL
bigwig Lorne Michaels has produced, you will see a surprising track
record.
Of the four previous attempts, only the most recent (A Night at the
Roxbury) has failed critically and commercially.  Roxbury wasn't even a
funny sketch to begin with, so it was doomed from the get-go.  Lorne's
other endeavors were much more successful, including both Wayne's World
films, The Coneheads and the teaming of Chris Farley and David Spade in
the hysterical Tommy Boy (which wasn't really ever a skitand I'm not
going to mention Black Sheep).  But because most of the mega-stars that
matured on SNL were featured in original films (read: not tired skits),
those featuring current cast members are tossed off quicker than Sharon
Stone's panties at a Hollywood Foreign Press party.
That said, Superstar is not at all a good movie.  Doesn't that
contradict everything I just said?  Well, yes and no.  It is still a
slight concept stretched way too thin, but the refreshing part of the
film is that it doesn't repeatedly hammer home the protagonist's snappy
catch phrase  `Sometimes, when I get nervous, I put my hands under my
arms and then I smell them like this.'
Based on the character she created on SNL, Molly Shannon (Never Been
Kissed) brings the soft-spoken, apologetic, TV-movie-loving Mary
Katherine Gallagher to the big screen.  Here, like the television
sketch, M.K. is a bit of an outcast at St. Monica's High, craves
popularity and dreams of becoming a superstar.  Additionally, viewers
will learn that M.K. was born and raised in the small town of Bessame
Heights in the ugliest house with the ugliest yard and the ugliest dog.
She is in love with Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell, Dick), the captain of
the football team, and ends up in the special ed. class when a nun
catches M.K. smooching a tree that she pretends is Sky.
M.K.'s home life isn't much better.  Originally told that her parents
were torn apart by hammerhead sharks, she later learns that they were
victims of a grisly step-dancing competition accident.  Raised by her
crippled grandmother (Glynis Johns, Lady Penelope Peasoup from the 60s
Batman serial), M.K. gets a very unprestigious after-school job at Kip's
Video as the rewind girl.  She fails at attempts to join both the
cheerleading squad and the gymnastics team, but sees a potential for her
big break when St. Monica's announces that they will conduct a `Let's
Fight Venereal Disease' talent competition.  The winner will receive an
all-expenses paid trip to Hollywood and a part in a movie with `positive
moral values.'
The film proceeds predictably to the big, dull finale, where M.K. is pit
against her arch-rival Evian (Elaine Hendrix, The Parent Trap), who also
happens to be both a popular cheerleader and Sky's current squeeze.
There isn't much imagination in the script (Steve Koren, Roxbury) or the
direction (Bruce McCulloch, Dog Park), except a spiffy Armageddon dream
sequence spoof.  I think Superstar's opening credits  featuring an
overhead drop shot into a pool of synchronized swimmers - probably cost
more than the entire production of Dog Park.  And I got really tired of
continually seeing M.K.'s white cotton panties.  Superstar co-stars MTV
shocker Tom Green, Harland Williams (Rocket Man) and Mark McKinney
(S.N.L.).

Review for Kyua (1997)
Š Copyright 2001 Planet Sick-Boy. All Rights Reserved.
If you've been wondering whether someone can make a film as moody,
atmospheric and downright disturbing as Se7en, you'll want to start pleading
with your local arthouse theatres to land Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Cure. Actually,
it's more of a blend of Memento's amnesia, The Manchurian Candidate's
mind-control and power of suggestion, and the bent serial killer from the
aforementioned Se7en.
Yakusho Koji (Shall We Dance?) plays Detective Kenichi Takabe, a man clearly
beaten down from both dealing with his mentally unstable wife and his
inability to solve a string of bizarre murders.  The victims all have a
large "X" carved into their throat and chest, but the killings have an even
more bizarre link.  The murderers are always found near the crime scene but
have no recollection of committing any crime.  To make matters worse,
they're usually friends and acquaintances of the victims, too.
Enter a peculiar psychology student named Mamiya Kunio (Hagiwara Masato),
who might be connected to the murders but suffers from acute amnesia, making
him impossible to question as he can't remember anything that happened more
than a few minutes ago.  Mamiya keeps asking, "Who are you?" over and over
again (his memory is much worse than Leonard Shelby's), but is he merely
trying to figure out who you are, or is he trying to get you to question
your own identity?
Kurosawa, who won an award at Cannes this year for Séance, uses long shots
almost exclusively in Cure, which, amazingly, is his first film to be
released in the United States.  The result makes the film a bit creepier,
sort of like you're spying on the characters, which makes everything more
realistic.  It's one bleak film, and its ending would make Kevin Spacey
proud.  But if you're the kind of idiot that needs every loose end neatly
tied up before the credits roll, you'll want to skip this and see America's
Sweethearts again.

Review for 28 Days (2000)
A change of pace for comedic director Betty Thomas, 28 Days is a wholly
predictable story of a booze-and-pill addict that learns how to overcome
her problems after spending some court-ordered time at a rehabilitation
center.  Aside from a few interesting camera tricks, there's nothing
here that you haven't already seen a dozen times.  The big drawing card
here is supposed to be Sandra Bullock, but she hasn't exactly been
lighting the show business world on fire lately.  Most people consider
her a top-shelf, A-list Hollywood star, but she's only had three
bona-fide hits (Speed, While You Were Sleeping and A Time to Kill) and
those films are all over five years old.
Bullock (Forces of Nature) stars as Gwen Cummings, who we learn is an
out-of-control partier via Days' first scene.  The Clash's `Should I
Stay Or Should I Go' blares over a frenzy of slow-mo and sped-up film as
Gwen and her boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West, William Shakespeare's A
Midsummer Night's Dream) pound drinks, dance and pass out on the eve of
her sister Lilly's (Elizabeth Perkins, Crazy in Alabama) wedding.  The
next day, Gwen and Jasper are late to the nuptials and trash the
reception before Gwen steals a limousine, loses control and crashes into
a lovely Bedford, New York home.
Days immediately hops forward in time, where Gwen is being dropped off
at a rehabilitation center called Serenity Glen, where she has been
ordered to spend four weeks in lieu of serving any jail time.  Sounds
like a pretty light sentence to me.  Of course, Gwen plans on coasting
through her court-ordered time at the Glen, but predictably begins to
bond with the other addicts once the waves of withdrawal begin to set
in.  We learn from Gwen's flashbacks that she inherited alcoholism from
her mom, who taught her young daughters that having fun was the most
important thing in life because `If you're not having fun, what's the
friggin' point?'
Serenity Glen is packed full of stock characters, including the old
woman (Diane Ladd, Primary Colors), the middle-aged man (Thomas regular
Reni Santoni, `Poppy' from Seinfeld), the black girl (Marianne
Jean-Baptiste, Secrets & Lies), the teenaged girl (Azura Skye, Zoey,
Duncan, Jack & Jane), the gay guy (Alan Tudyk, Patch Adams) and the
smart-mouth that tries to get in Gwen's pants (Mike O'Malley, ESPN's
`The Rick').  And what's with Jake from Melrose Place landing the big
role of the hunky heartthrob for whom Gwen falls?  Oh, wait  it's only
Viggo Mortensen (A Walk on the Moon).  Speaking of odd casting, Tudyk's
character reeks of fellow effeminate, blond stringbean Andy Dick. Maybe
Dick was supposed to be in the film but backed out because of real-life
rehab.
Days also features this odd guy (Loudon Wainwright III) playing a guitar
like a Greek chorus (a la Jonathan Richman in There's Something About
Mary), but then he disappeared until the ending.  There was also an
inappropriate amount of time spent on a fictional soap opera that the
Serenity Glen inmates watched.  But the biggest problem of all is
Bullock's character.  Are we supposed to feel sorry for her?  What about
the guy that owned the limo that she stole and crashed?  Or the people
that owned the house she ruined?
Thomas' (Doctor Dolittle, Private Parts) direction is the only thing
that keeps Days afloat.  Together with cinematographer Declan Quinn
(Flawless), Thomas creates several memorable scenes where Gwen flashes
back to either her drunk mother or wild drug-and-liquor parties, which
result in the character turning on all of the faucets in the bathroom to
drown out the sounds of her past.  Like most of her previous work,
Thomas also uses a handheld camera to shoot some of the `group' scenes,
which lends a nice fly-on-the-wall feel to the film.
Days' linear script was written Susannah Grant, who penned the equally
conventional (but much more enjoyable) Erin Brockovich.  It's your basic
story about a person that needs help but refuses it before finally
accepting it, overcoming their problem, and then moving on with their
life.  The plot offers nothing that you wouldn't expect and, at times,
the film seems like it should be on the Lifetime network, or possibly a
TV movie of the week, which is where Bullock seems to be headed.  Of
other note, the `F' word was noticeably removed from at least one scene
to preserve the PG-13 rating.  Like there's going to be a bunch of kids
between thirteen and sixteen clamoring to see this.
1:43 - PG-13 for substance abuse, adult language and minor adult
situations

Review for Beau travail (1999)
Ever hate somebody for being too well liked?  Too beautiful?  Too
respected?  Too perfect?  That's the basic gist of Beau Travail, Claire
Denis' strikingly beautiful film loosely based on Herman Melville's
`Billy Budd.'  I liken the film to fighting world featherweight champion
Prince Naseem  you laugh off Travail's near lack of dialogue,
indistinguishable characters, puny running time and paper-thin plot, but
before you know it, you're lying on your back with little birds floating
around your head.
Denis Lavant (Lovers On the Bridge) plays a French Foreign Legion
Sergeant named Galoup.  His men, an interesting blend of black Africans
and white Europeans, inhabit a post in Djibouti on Africa's east coast.
Travail goes out of its way to documents the grueling physical tasks
that the soldiers must routinely participate in while baking under the
blistering hot sun.  Their chores and maneuvers seem incredibly
pointless, often drawing smirks from the villagers that watch in
amazement.
Short, ugly and scarred (think of a French version of Tommy Lee Jones),
Galoup is respected by his men, but he develops an irrational hatred
toward one particular soldier named Sentain (Grégoire Colin, The
Dreamlife of Angels).  Galoup can't stand Sentain's popularity with his
fellow soldiers and, especially, the Legion's commanding officer (Michel
Subor).  His sweeping jealousy begins to affect everything in his life,
turning Galoup into an entirely different person.
With Galoup's sparse narration, and the presence of soldiers and
beautiful poetic images, Travail reminded me of The Thin Red Line (and
it's about half that Oscar nominee).  What I found strange was Denis'
(Nénette et Boni) need to let her camera linger on the soldier's
well-chiseled bodies.  The troops were almost always shirtless, and the
robotic manner at which they approached their tasks made parts of the
film seem like a commercial for The Gap.  This, along with Galoup's
inexplicable envy of Sentain, provided some very strong homoerotic
undertones to Travail.
If anything, Travail is worth a viewing just for its visuals.  The
pristine blue water of the Indian Ocean offsets the drab, rocky
surroundings of Djibouti.  Cinematographer Agnčs Godard (Nénette) does a
fantastic job of capturing the beauty of this particular area of Africa,
as well as the dark brutality of man.

Title
Review for Dancer in the Dark (2000)
Since premiering at this year's Cannes International Film Festival, Lars
von Trier's Dancer in the Dark has radically divided its viewers into
two distinct camps  those that love the film, and those that think it's
a piece of garbage.  The film won both the coveted Palme d'Or (for best
feature) and the Best Actress award at Cannes, but the announcement was
met with boos and hisses.
Critics are just as split as the audiences in Cannes, some hailing it as
a stunning success while others reserve their harshest condemnations for
von Trier's (The Idiots) picture.  Fine Line Features, Dancer's U.S.
distributor, uses the shocking disparity on the home page of the film's
official website, with Entertainment Weekly gushing words like
`exhilarating,' `astonishing,' and `a triumph,' while Variety grumbled
it was "artistically bankrupt on every level."
Despite all of this, I was surprised to find Dancer extremely mediocre.
It's certainly not a bad film, but it isn't a great one, either.  I
thought the best part about it was the performance of Björk, and my
critique is more positive than negative because of her.  Admittedly, I
am a huge fan of the Icelandic pop star, so people that don't care for
her music may like Dancer considerably less.
Dancer is set in small town in Washington State during 1964.  Björk
plays Selma, an immigrant from the former Czechoslovakia living in a
trailer located in the back yard of a local policeman named Bill (David
Morse, Bait).  Selma works in a factory, but her job performance is
hindered by a hereditary disease that will rob her of her sight within a
year.  The possibility of being rendered sightless doesn't seem to
bother Selma, who works double shifts at the factory to squirrel away
money for her 12-year-old son Gene (Vladica Kostic) to have an operation
to correct the inherited ocular disorder that he will soon develop.
Selma also has a fondness of musicals, spending her spare time at the
theatre with co-worker and best friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve, East
West), and is even set to play Maria in a local production of `The Sound
of Music.'  As her eyesight becomes worse and worse, Selma is forced to
make changes to her daily routines, but her spirits remain high, and her
desire to save money for Gene (named after Gene Kelly?) becomes only
stronger.
Oh, and there's singing, too.  Dancer features six musical numbers
(written and performed by Björk).  Song is Selma's means of escape from
her dreary, monotonous job, with the rhythmic clatter of the machines
helping her daydream about dance routines like the ones she saw in
American films as a child in Czechoslovakia.  `I've got little games I
play when it goes really hard,' Selma says, `I just start dreaming and
it all becomes music.'  And, boy, does it.  The choreographed musical
numbers are a striking contrast to the dowdy appearance and feel of the
rest of the film.
It's hard to watch Dancer and not think of von Trier's Breaking the
Waves.  Both pictures were filmed using handheld video cameras, giving
the final products a shaky, dizzying look.  Both are set years ago in
tiny towns with close-knit communities.  And both featured stunning
debut performances from female leads (Björk here, and Emily Watson in
Waves) that play haunting and, ultimately, doomed characters that seem a
little kooky, but end up making sacrifices that the rest of us would
never dream of.
Even the opening of Dancer is reminiscent of Waves.  Here, von Trier
begins with a three-minute overture played over abstract paintings that
slowly dissolve into one another.  You might remember Von Trier doing
something similar before each `chapter' in Waves.  While both films are
both triumphant and tragic, Dancer has an ending that's a vast
improvement over the disappointing epilogue in Waves.
It's tough to say whether the eccentric Danish director was trying to
make a film that shows a strong, pure character making the ultimate
sacrifice for a loved one, or if it was just a tongue-in-cheek poke at
the allure that sweeping American musicals have on susceptible children
in other countries.  Imagine thinking that America is one big, gaudy
song-and-dance number with a happy ending, only to get here, work your
fingers to the bone and then go blind.
von Trier has indicated that his parents strongly disapproved of big
Hollywood musicals.  But, then again, your typical Hollywood musical
usually doesn't have a seen where a guy gets his head bashed in.  I
wonder if they'd be happy with Dancer.

Review for Kissing a Fool (1998)
Kissing a Fool is the latest romantic comedy served up to the mindless
legion of brain-dead imbeciles that we call the American viewers.  It
does nothing new, but since they have embraced similar filth (read: My
Best Friend's Wedding), it will probably be well received.
The only interesting thing about Kissing is the unique casting.  David
Schwimmer (Friends) plays Max Abbott, an over-confident, ultra-macho
Chicago sportscaster who nails everything that moves and utters the line
`What Up, Chicago?' ad nauseum in both his professional and personal
lives.  Schwimmer is usually typecast as the super-shy downtrodden loser
type, but in Kissing, that role is filled by Jason Lee (Chasing Amy),
who plays the sensitive Air Supply/Barry Manilow loving writer, Jay.
Lee is known best for his offensive obscenity-screaming characters
written by Kevin Smith.  So, what I guess what I'm trying to say is that
the parts were kinda swapped.
Linda (Bonnie Hunt, Jumanji) tells the film in narrative flashback at a
wedding.  She is a wealthy publisher who claims to have been responsible
for introducing the happy newlyweds.  We don't know who has just been
married, but Linda doesn't care.  She starts her story at the
beginningMax and Jay have been friends since grammar school...
Long story short, Jay sets Max up with Sam (Avital, Polish Wedding), his
beautiful new editor.  They fall in love and quickly start planning a
wedding.  The boorish Max suddenly develops the strange notion that Sam
may not be `the one' and tries to get his pal to sleep with him as some
sort of bizarre testosterone love-test.  Jay, of course, wants nothing
to do with Max's sinister plan, but ends up falling for Sam regardless.
Other than the casting, the only other bright spot in all of the
banality is Israeli newcomer Avital.  Of course, that could just be
because she isn't Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston or Cameron Diaz.  Lee
seems more out of place in his role than Schwimmer does, but I have a
feeling that Schwimmer is probably like Max in real life.  Lee also has
very disturbing hair.  That could be because he had to have hair similar
to Max so that when the bride and groom kiss at the beginning of the
film, we wouldn't know who the groom was.  I would have cut that scene
and given Jay better hair.  Maybe that would have helped his
self-confidence, which would have led to him come to terms with his
feelings for Sam sooner, which would have led to me getting home
earlier.

Review for Paulie (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
Put out a movie with a talking parrot and my ass will be at the theater
in no time.  What kind of entertainment can top that?  While you stumble
about for a response, let me unleash the powerful story of Paulie.
Mind you, my friend Misha, a Russian immigrant janitor at the
university, passed on this tale to me.  He found Paulie locked up in the
dingy dark basement of the school and was amazed when he heard the bird
talk and sing like a human.  Now, when I see a bird that can talk and
sing like a human, I get a look on my face like that guy who dug up the
singing frog on the old Bugs Bunny cartoon.  But, my friend Misha is a
little bit naďve when it comes to exploitation, so I digress.
It turns out that Paulie has had one hell of a journey.  He started out
as a gift to a little girl named Marie.  They were the best of friends,
until her overbearing father came home from the war and got all nutso
when he found out that Marie had a stuttering problem.  The next thing
you know, the stupid kid takes a dive off of the roof like Michael
Douglas in The Game and Paulie is sent packing.
He finds his next home in a pawnshop run by Artie (Buddy Hackettisn't
he dead?) and frequented by a two-bit hoodlum named Benny (Jay Mohr,
Jerry Maguire and the voice of Paulie).  Apparently, this is where he
picks up his tough Jersey accent and insulting demeanor.
Paulie is bought by a lonely widow named Ivy (Gena Rowlands, Unhook the
Stars) and the two decide to make their way across the country to find
Marie.  But, in a strange twist, Ivy is suddenly rendered blind and
Paulie is forced to continue on his own.  This is an important message
to all the kids out there  help a bird find his owner and lose the
power of sight.
His next stop is in East Los Angeles, where Paulie finds work at a taco
stand run by Igancio (Cheech Marin).  He falls in love with another
parrot named Lupe, but is again forced to move on.
A bit too heady, Paulie may turn kids off with little action and a lot
of talking.  But screw them, I liked it.

Title
Review for Shadow Boxers (1999)
Director Katya Bankowsky began filming Shadow Boxers, a documentary
about woman fighters, in 1995 when, after 68 years of being an all-male
event, the prestigious New York Golden Gloves tournament finally allowed
women to compete.  Much to the astonishment of the male-dominated sport,
the women turned boxing on its ear by proving girls can be just as
ferocious as boys in the ring.
Boxers concentrates on a former kickboxing champion from Holland named
Lucia Rijker.  She describes the sport as addictive and all-consuming,
telling stories about other fighters who abandoned their men and their
children to pursue success between the ropes.  Beautiful and well spoken
(at least for now), we see Rijker gain both confidence and credibility
with each opponent she faces.
There is another fighter who gets some quality screen time toward the
beginning of Boxers.  Jill `Flyin' Lion' Matthews, a diminutive,
smart-mouthed (at least for now) boxer who turns pro after winning her
division of the Golden Gloves, facetiously asks if her makeup is messed
up when she steps out of the ring.  When a reporter asks how she
prepares for her fights, she quickly snaps back, `With a manicure and a
pedicure.'
But the real draw to Boxers is the way Bankowsky pieces together the
boxing scenes.  They're elegant and hypnotic, playing out in slow motion
over a hip-hop soundtrack.  Bankowsky also switches between color stock
and grainy black-and-white film, which only adds to the film's
dream-like quality.
Bankowsky also edited and produced Boxers, which starts to drag a bit
toward the end, when the film isn't concentrating on boxing.  The only
other knock I can give the film is the repetitive score provided by DJ
Zoël, a former MTV Latino VJ.  Boxers isn't a first-round knockout, but
it's probably a second-round TKO.  Even if you dislike the sport, you'll
still find the film enjoyable and entertaining.
1:12  Not Rated but contains some bloody boxing scenes and adult
language

Title
Review for Love Letter, The (1999)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
The curtain goes up.  A single woman jogs on the beach.  She finds an
incredibly romantic letter that changes her life and then ships her kid
off so that she can concentrate on the note.  No, it's not the eagerly
awaited re-release of Kevin Costner's Message in a Bottle  it's The
Love Letter, Dreamworks' counter-programming for the Star Wars
phenomenon.
The woman is Helen MacFarquhar (Kate Capshaw, Indiana Jones & the Temple
of Doom), the owner of a small used bookstore in a quaint Massachusetts
burg - you know, the kind of shop that can afford to have several
employees, but not one customer.  She doesn't know who wrote the letter,
but eventually decides that it must be Johnny (Tom Everett Scott, Dead
Man on Campus), a college student working at the shop during the
summer.  Dopey Helen just leaves the life-changing letter out, and it is
discovered by Johnny, who thinks that Helen wrote it for him, and also
by co-worker Janet (Ellen DeGeneres, Goodbye Lover), who thinks that
George (Tom Selleck, In & Out), the hunky town fireman, wrote it for
her.
More disturbing than the asinine story is the fact that Capshaw, for the
second movie in a row, gets to bump uglies with a boy half her age (it
was David Arquette in The Alarmist).  Plus, she also served as a
producer for The Love Letter, so that means that real-life hubby Steven
Spielberg had to shell out his own dough to watch his wife run around
with younger, better-looking guys.  Anybody have Amy Irving's phone
number?  (1:28  R for adult language and an out-of-focus ass-shot of
Capshaw)

Title
Review for Senseless (1998)
PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com
This time of year is always painful for me.  It's always mid-February
when people start to bitch that there are no black Academy Award
nominees.  Hey, dumb-ass, I've got a secret for youSenseless is the
reason why.  So are Booty Call, Def Jam's How To Be A Player and Most
Wanted, just to bring up the few that I have the misfortune of
remembering.  Ring any bells, Einstein?
Senseless is the latest comedy vehicle for Marlon Wayans, arguably the
least talented of the Wayans brothers.  But, at least he's not making
action films.  And what's the deal with the Wayans brothers?  Are there
enough of them to populate Rhode Island?  And does the WB network really
stand for `Wayans Brothers'?  While you ponder, I'll continue.
Wayans plays Darryl Witherspoon, an economic student at fictitious
Stratford University.  While trying to concentrate on his studies,
Witherspoon also works a series of odd jobs to pay for his tuition and
to support his mother and younger siblings.  These jobs include, but are
not limited in any way to: campus tour guide, dishwasher, salad bar
attendant, mail courier, water boy, blood and, of course, sperm donor.
The main plot line centers on Witherspoon vying for the prestigious
junior analyst job with Smythe-Barney, a powerful brokerage firm that
offers one position annually to a deserving Stratford graduate.  Enter
Scott Thorpe (David Spade), snotty-white-rich-son of a banker who
presents the main competition.
The funny is supposed to come from Witherspoon enlisting in an
experimental drug test for some quick cash.  According to the crazy
campus scientist, the drug is supposed to increase the senses
five-fold.  And you can pretty much write the rest of the film yourself.
There is one great recurring gag in which Witherspoon's apparently
Canadian roommate (Matthew Lillard) thinks that his pal is really a
smack freak and continuously consults a pamphlet entitled `Is My Friend
A Junky?' for information.  The script, from the writers of the funnier
Rocket Man, is also peppered with plenty of dick and shit jokes and even
includes a reference to `tossed salad' that only I seemed to get.
Helmer Penelope Spheeris (Black Sheep, The Little Rascals) continues to
stumble along the mediocre comedy-directing talent heap.  One might
think that she would choose a different career path after the success of
her documentary series, The Decline of Western Civilization, which
earned her kudos (and the `Freedom of Expression' award) at this year's
Sundance Film Festival.  Maybe those are harder to make, but they sure
are easier to watch.
