Title
Review for Spice World (1997)
Spiceworld Review by Eric Lurio (C)1998 
 If I didn't know better I would say that the first couple of drafts of the
 `Spiceworld' script was written while Jamie CurtisÂ and Kim Fuller were
 intoxicated.
 This may or may not be the case, but anything this cheerfully dumb could not
 be the product of a healthy mind.
 For better or worse, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm, Geri
 Haliwell and Victoria Addams are the Spice Girls. They go around in a bus
 [driven by Meat Loaf] who's interior is about twice the size of the exterior. 
 They pretty much do nothing but hang out, sing and show off their thier
 mammary glands while the likes of Roger Moore, Barry Humphries, George Wendt,
 Stephen Fry, Bob Geldof, Bob Hoskins, Elton John, Jennifer Saunders and Elvis
 Costello briefly step in front of the camera to ham it up for old times sake.
 There is some slight semblance of a plot concerning the sixth Spice Girl,
 played by Pete Bes..er...Naoko Mori, who is ten months pregnant and about to
 give birth just before the show at the Albert hall begins, but that doesn't
 really help or hurt whatever this thing is at all.
 People have compared `Spiceworld' to `A Hard Day's Night,' but it's in fact
 something close to a remake of the Monkees' `Head' which came out in 1968.
 Except that actually stands the test of time.
