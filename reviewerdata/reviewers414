Review for Sword and the Sorcerer, The (1982)
At first glance, I thought that The Sword And The Sorceror had
promise.  Its plotline goes like this: The evil King Cromwell,
desiring to take over the world, resurrects an evil, ancient sorceror,
Xusia for power.  He attacks the kingdom of Eh-Dan and kills young
Prince Talon's parents.  Given a triple-bladed sword (which can
shoot bad guys, like a gun) by his dying father, Talon vows for
revenge.  Eleven years later, when he's established his own army, the
Mercaneries, he vows to take back his kingdom.  Along the way, he
meets up with Alana, whose village is attacked by drunken guards and
her brother is kidnapped by Cromwell.  Talon vows to help, and, after
a series of minor escapades, eventually ends up rescuing Alana's
brother (and several other prisoners), only to be captured himself (in
other words, put on a Cross to be crucified!).  Fortunately he frees
himself, rescues Alana from marrying Cromwell, defeats Xusia, and then
Cromwell, all with his triple bladed sword (During the final battle,
the blade breaks, but Talon finishes Cromwell off by using a hidden
dagger in the blade).  Then, everything ends happily.
Unfortunately, The Sword And The Sorcerer is not even half as good as
it sounds.  What would have been a great film is completely destroyed
by uneven plot jumping, bad acting, and gruesomely gory, bloody
scenes.  Never once does the story seem to connect together, it just
jumps around repeatedly.
This problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where
Cromwell resurrects Xusia.  After telling him that he needs his help,
he leads the warlock out into daylight, but then stabs him and sends
him careening off a cliff afterwards.  Wait a minute, didn't the
plotline say that he needs the help of Xusia in order to invade
Eh-Dan, which he cannot do by military force?  If that is the case,
why does he dispose of Xusia after resurrecting him?  And why does he
manage to take over Eh-Dan anyway?  These questions are just NEVER -
no, NEVER - answered in the film.
Another example is that one moment we see Talon fighting for his life,
another moment we see him just about to be crucified during Alana's
wedding to Cromwell(!), and finally at the end, instead of settling
down with Alana, he just tells her to "wait", and then he just rides
off!  In addition to the extremely bloody scenes, this uneven plot
jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy
adventure.  Even some attempts to make it exciting, a few fire scenes,
battle scenes, don't work.  It just completely fails altogether
miserably.
The only good thing about this film is its musical score, contributed
by David Whittaker, who had an (extremely) short music composing
career.  The score is boomy and adventurous, powerful, and a billion
times better than this film is.  My suggestion: steer the hell away
from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead (if you can
find it).
Ironically, though, before the film's credits roll, there is a message
indicating that a sequel, Tales Of The Ancient Empire, would follow.
To my relief (and delight), it never got into production, because The
Sword And The Sorcerer laid an egg at the box office, grossing only
$39 million.
Critics were right on in slamming The Sword And The Sorcerer, all
right.  Leonard Maltin rightfully called it "second rate in scripting,
and acting" and At-A-Glance Film Reviews called it "a confusing,
stupid, unimaginative, unengaging, bloodfilled bore".  I totally agree
with these reviews, all right, and I hope that this piece of #$%! will
be forgotten about.  There are FAR better fantasy movies than The
Sword And The Sorcerer.  I hope you get a good laugh out of this
review, but I am not laughing.  In fact, my insults don't even come
close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its
100 minute running time.

Review for Po Mo Knock Knock (1999)
ShortStuffCentral.com presents a review by staff member Jon Turner.  For 
more reviews of Short films and Flash animation, check out 
www.shortstuffcentral.com, the Internet's home for Short Films.
Like so many great films, Po Mo Knock Knock is not what it appears on first 
viewing.  Ok, so it's no Fight Club, or even Sixth Sense for that matter, 
but for the message that it cleverly delivers in under three minutes, it's 
well worth your time to check out.  The entire black and white, experimental 
film consists of gloomy, artiste characters trying to communicate with each 
other through knock knock jokes.  It is a post-modern idea, if you will; 
hence the title, Po Mo Knock Knock.  The first time it plays through, the 
film appears dry, unintelligible, and random.  But once you catch on and 
become part of the inside joke, it proves to be a non-stop punch line.
Although, as a whole, it is definitely a comedy, the only actual joke in the 
film is one brief sight gag.  The Pollyanna comedy troupe wants you to 
experience it all as one long, surreal gag.  David Ball plays the character 
of Knock Knock, while his counterpart, played by the late Bill Stiles is 
called Who's There?  The men's struggle to communicate in a post-modern 
style parodies the general failure of such experimental films to convey 
their meanings.
The only problem with the film is that you just might not get it.  I 
certainly did not on my first viewing, but I found it quirky enough to want 
to delve further into the filmmaker's psyche.  With plenty of supplemental 
material on the DVD, I was able to do just that and came to really 
appreciate the intricacies of the extended joke.
Included with the film on this DVD compilation are four more tracks that 
illuminate the film's various meanings and serve up some great 
entertainment.  The Pollyanna troupe obviously has tremendous fun with their 
work as you can see in their 5 minute featurette, `Po Mo Love Doc,' during 
which they stay in character, and their `Matrix Special Edition' commentary 
track.  I find this bonus track to actually be funnier than the film itself. 
  The troupe completely ignores their film playing in the background as they 
elaborate on their fascination with the Wachowski's Matrix and tell 
hilarious stories about their obsession.  Also included is one more 
commentary track by director Greg Pak and another one with the whole troupe 
actually discussing their own film.
It may take you a few viewings to fully appreciate the work that went into 
Po Mo Knock Knock as well as the hilarity of the resulting film.  But at 
only 3 minutes running time, the joke never tires and the experience is well 
worth it.

Title
Review for Akira (1988)
Review:  Many, many fans of Japanese animation, consider AKIRA, an animated
adaption of the comic-book of the same title, at the time, to be one of the
finest animated films to come from the land of the Rising Sun.  Strangely,
however, it took me more than two viewings for me to get the message
surrounding this movie.
The story of how I saw the film begins in the summer of 1995, when I was 13
years old.  At the time, I was very interested in products that had come from
Japan.  I had owned a couple of videogame soundtracks, and was very fond of
Kitaro.  I was interested what Japnaese film scores was like.  That was when I
brought the soundtrack album to AKIRA.  It was arguably one of the most
impressive soundtracks I have ever heard.  Its mixture of synthesizer samples,
vocal chanting, and percussive instruments made it an experience unlike any
I've heard.  I was interested in seeing the film.
A few days later, I rented the movie from Palmer Video (This was a bad mistake
on my part, as my parents, at the time, did NOT permit me to watch movies
restricted for a mature audience, unless I had their approval.  In addition,
the video cover had NO warning that it was NOT FOR KIDS.)  I had no idea how
extremely dark (and violent) AKIRA was, nor was I really much of an Anime fan
(The only Anime I had seen, up until watching AKIRA, were THE BRAVE FROG, and
WINDARIA.  Okay, I also saw THE TRANSFORMERS:  THE MOVIE as well, and I guess
LITTLE NEMO:  ADVENTURES IN SLUMBERLAND can be counted as some other examples. 
I had also seen SECRET OF THE SEAL, SWAN LAKE, PUSS N BOOTS, SECRET OF THE
SEAL, and THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Years later, after AKIRA, around 1998, I saw the
FINAL FANTASY Anime, and after that, the fabulous ***** KIKI'S DELIVERY
SERVICE, and I had become somewhat involved in this totally different genre of
animation since then.  I know this seems like a bore, but I thought that you
probably might wanna know that about me).
So why was I both baffled and sick to my stomach after watching AKIRA?
Well, for starters, the storyline is SO complicated, I literally had to check
every source available to understand it.  However, from a visit to the AKIRA
ONLY website online, I was able to read (and download here) the storyline for
AKIRA.  It takes a strong mind to truly understand what is going on if you
don't have a clue what the storyline is, or even read the comic book which this
film is based on.  In addition, AKIRA is jampacked  and I really do mean
JAMPACKED  with an extreme amount of violence (as you will probably tell from
reading the synopsis of the film)
So, if you're one of those people who saw the film and was baffled by the
storyline, feel free to read on.  If you are not, be careful, because the
following *does* contain some spoilers (a thing I tend to give with my
reviews).  Don't say I didn't warn you
That said, this is how the story goes, as written by Matthew Zell for the 1989
Capricorn Anime Guide (Note that I've downloaded this article from the AKIRA
ONLY website, made a few changes, and added in some extra comments, for a more
entertaining, or perhaps gruesome, reading experience.):
The film opens with a helicopter shot of Tokyo, on July 16, 1988.  Flash
forward to 2019, after World War III (something I hope we never have), where
Tokyo had been completely destroyed.  Neo-Tokyo is constructed around the
remains of Tokyo  a crater which was caused by (presumably) the dropping of a
destructive bomb.
Next, we meet the story's protagonist, Kaneda, and his friends, a bunch of
juvenile delinquents.  They are bikers locked in a violent battle between a
rival group of bikers, called the clowns.  As they ride off into the night to
continue their battle (one of the most exciting scenes in the film), a man
holding what looks like a 100-year-old child attempts, unsuccessfully, to elude
the police.  When the man is shot and killed, the child, named Takashi, screams
and shatters the buildings around him.  The child escapes in the confusion
while Kay and Ryu, the dead man's friends, watch in amazement.  The Colonel
sets out with Masaru, another of these strange children, to find Takashi. 
While rioting crowds are subdued by the police with tear gas, Kaneda's rumble
continues. Tetsuo takes the lead and, after disposing of his opponents, nearly
has a collision with Takashi.  Tetsuo's bike suddenly explodes.  First Kaneda,
then the Colonel arrive.  Takashi and Tetsuo are taken while the rest of the
bikers are arrested.   
While Kaneda and his friends are being processed, he notices Kay's picture in
a book of wanted criminals.  After his interview, Kaneda spots Kay, who has yet
to be processed, in the hallway.  He manages to convince the officer to let him
take her with him.  Kaneda is beginnning to introduce himself when Kay spots
Ryu, who has also been arrested.  She eludes Kaneda so she can help her friend
escape.   
While analyzing him, the army doctors discover that Tetsuo's mind is
psychically active.  The Colonel orders Tetsuo to be held and taught to develop
his power.
We then discover that Kaneda and his friends are now attending some sort of
juvenile school.  In this sequence, we see a teacher punching each of the
bikers as he yells `Shut up!' at each of them.  Afterwords, the bikers shout
some really PROFANE insults towards the teacher, which I won't even bother to
go into detail about.  (Upon viewing this sequence to my mother, along with the
scene where the doctors are examining Tetsuo, she found it to be really
disturbing.  I can't say I blame her.)  After that, Kaneda and his friends are
joined by their girlfriends.  Tetsuo's girlfriend, Kaori, asks where her
boyfriend is, but Kaneda can only tell her that the army took him.
Later that night, Tetsuo escapes and meets Kaori, and they talk about going
someplace far away.  Apparently, Tetsuo has had enough of the torture he's
going through at the hospital, and so, next day, he and Kaori steal Kaneda's
bike and go for a ride.  They are spotted by the Clowns and pursued.  Tetsuo
and Kaori are both caught and tortured (This sequence involves Kaori getting
her front shirt ripped off where we see her front breasts.  Why did they have
to include this brief, but short, sexual attack in this scene?  It's pointless,
and it doesn't really do much of anything to tell the story, much less explain
what's going on.) but fortunately, Kaneda and his friends show up before
anything happens.  They capture one of the bikers, and Tetsuo beats him to
death.  Kaneda tries to stop his friend before he kills the guy.  Tetsuo whirls
on him and demands to know why Kaneda didn't help him escape from the hospital.
 It is here that we start to see a change in Tetsuo, as he screams out at
Kaneda and his friends, `You think I'm a loser!  It's not my fault I was
smaller!  Well there will come a day when I'll show all of you!  Don't you
forget it!'  Suddenly, upon hearing a voice say `Akira!', Tetsuo suffers from a
strange fit, and as a result we see some more grotesque images here; one of
which involves bloody guts of some sort spilling out of Tetsuo's chest(!). 
During all this, Tetsuo says, in bitter agony, `I'VE GOT AKIRA!!!'.  The army
shows up and carries him off again.
Later Kaneda sees Ryu and Kay after they have performed an act of terrorism.
He follows and helps Kay elude her army pursuers.   
While Tetsuo suffers nightmares in the hospital, yet another one of these
strange children meets the Colonel.  The girl, Kyoko, says she had a dream in
which she forsaw that Akira will awaken very soon.  This prompts the general to
pay a visit to Akira, who is frozen at 5 degrees Kelvin.
Kay takes Kaneda back to her hideout.  Kaneda is still going through his
`come-on' lines.  Ryu arrives and locks Kaneda up, believing him to be an army
spy.  They go into one of the other rooms where Ryu receives forged ID cards
which will allow them to pass the hospital security.  They are planning to
break into the hospital and kidnap another of the children.  Meanwhile, Kaneda
is caught while trying to escape and Ryu accuses him of spying on their
meeting.
Ryu meets with his boss, who is a member of the ruling council.  While they
discuss the planned attack, they observe a group of young people involved in a
religious ceremony worshipping Akira.
Later, at the council meeting, the Colonel meets with the other members, a
bunch of petty politicians, who tell him that he is spending too much money. 
They have funded the Akira Project for four years and there have been no
Results.  The Colonel tells them that he is already at his minimum expenditure
and warns of the dire consequences if they cut any further.  The council
ignores him, and he storms out.   
While Kaneda, Kay, and her group infitrate the hospital, Tetsuo's head begins
throbbing again.  He is assaulted by a series of illusions created by the
Children for the purpose of heightening his emotional distress and thereby
bringing forth his psychic powers.  (This sequence, which is probably the most
bizarre, involves cuddly stuffed animals - a teddy bear, a rag doll, and a
plush car - come to life and eventually mutate into larger versions, and what
follows after that I wouldn't dare mention it.) During this nightmarish
sequence, Tetsuo cuts his foot and the gruesomeness of the scene breaks the
children's concentration.  Tetsuo, who at this point has gone crazy, wants to
find the Children.  Suddenly, he knows how to find them.  While Tetsuo makes
his way to Room A, Kay and her friends are attacked in the sewers.  With help,
she and Kaneda steal one of the floating platforms and set off the find the
children.   
Tetsuo battles his way to Room A, while Kyoko tells Kaneda, through Kay, the
location of Room A.  Takashi and Masaru engage Tetsuo in an indecisive psychic
combat when the Colonel appears.  Tetsuo's head begins pounding again, and the
doctor tells him that if he would just cooperate, they could fix it.  Tetsuo
doesn't believe him. Kyoko tells Tetsuo that the most powerful of them, Akira,
had the same problem, but he found peace at last.  Tetsuo demands to know where
Akira is, and begins tearing the place apart to find him.  Kaneda arrives and
tells Tetsuo that he's come to rescue him (`Well, don't just stand there like a
dunce!  Hurry, come on, we've gotta get outta here!').  Tetsuo, resentful of
Kaneda's usually bad treatment (and they're supposed to be best friends!),
laughs at him (His laughter, at this point, is evil and crazy.  It must
probably be a part of the `powers' that he has acquired from his time at the
hospital) and tells Kaneda, `I don't think I'll be needing your help anymore,
if that's all right with you!  As a matter of fact, you might be needing MY
help!  When ya need a hand, just CALL, old buddy!'  He then confronts Kyoko and
pulls Akira's location, under the Olympic Stadium, from her mind.  He then
teleports himself out of the hospital.  (`Is this another one of my powers?'
Tetsuo asks, laughing hysterically, as he flies out the window.)
The Colonel sets out to deal with the menace when he is confronted by a
government agent.  He informs the Colonel that the council had decided to strip
him of command and have him arrested.  The Colonel resists and realizes he will
have to subdue the government so that he can deal with the crisis.
Tetsuo finds his way back to the usual hangout and asks the bartender for
`capsules', whatever that is. He then kills the bartender since he has no money
to pay for the drugs.  We don't actually see this happen, but we see the
results of it after Kaneda's friends, Yamagata and Kai, arrive at the bar, and
discover the destruction that Tetsuo caused. The drugs have had almost no
effect on him. Yamagata makes the mistake of offending Tetsuo, and crushed by a
refrigerator (and presumably killed by Tetsuo afterwards).
Imprisoned in the Hospital's detention area, Kay tries to explain to Kaneda
what little she knows of Akira and his awesome power.  Kyoko unlocks the cell
door and the pair escape.  (It also here that we get to see Kaneda quetsioning
Kay about her relationship with Ryo, and, like most of the characters in this
film, she shows a surly attitude about it.  Not that I blame her, though.)
Kaneda runs into Kai, who tells him what Tetsuo has done.  Kaneda takes
Yamagata's bike and smashes it, vowing revenge (He also says the B word as he
does so).  Takashi shows up and kidnaps Kay.  Kyoko warns Kaneda that the
consequences will be dire if Tetsuo isn't stopped.  Says Kaneda as he is about
to ride off on his bike to confront Tetsuo:  `I don't wanna keep the (No, I'm
not gonna say it) waiting!'
Meanwhile, Ryo's boss is trying to make his escape before the army can find
him. Ryu shows up and the panic-crazed councilman guns him down.  (We later see
the councilman die from choking on some pills that he takes while trying to
escape down an alley.) 
Tetsuo makes his way to the stadium, demolishing everything in its path.  Not
even the tanks from the army can stop him  the first one that fires ends up
creating a crater in the ground.  The doctor, who monitors Tetsuo's psychic
output, realizes that Tetsuo has become as powerful as Akira himself.  Tetsuo
arrives at Akira's cryogenic chamber and is confronted by Kay, who is being
controlled by the three Children.  She tells him that the power they have must
never be used, or a catastrophe will result.  Tetsuo, who finds all this to be
`utter stupidity!' attacks, and he and Kay have a terrible fight.  Tetsuo
prevails, only to discover that all that remains of Akira are some containers
filled with a print of his nervous system.   
Kaneda arrives, and they have a very nasty confrontation (via laser guns),
which culminates with Tetsuo's left arm completely amputated.  (The results of
this on the screen are REALLY bloody - I literally looked away from the screen
during this part!)  Later on, some sort of satellite from outer space
transports Tetsuo up and we see him get a bionic mechanical arm as a
replacement.  Later, Tetsuo sets himself up with the containers in the Olympic
Stadium.  Kaori enters looking for Tetsuo, and finds him writhing in pain. As
Tetsuo begins to loose control of his new arm (This is yet another
nightmarishly gruesome scene:  wires from Tetsuo's arm stretch out and
literally begin to crawl across the ground.), the Colonel arrives.  He tells
Tetsuo that his only hope for freedom from the intense pain is to return to the
hospital.  Tetsuo refuses and attacks first the Colonel, then Kaneda when he
arrives.
Then comes the moment where Tetsuo completely loses all control of his powers
and they go completely arwy, setting up yet another gory scene:  Tetsuo's body
literally mutates into a very gory, very large, and very grotesque mess.  His
voice, no longer sounding human, calls out for help to his friends, who of
course, can do nothing to help him.  In trying to reach out to Kaori, she gets
caught in his horribly mutated body and gets crushed to death.  `KAORI'S PAIN
IS INSIDE ME!!!' he screams.  Kaneda also gets caught, and he tries to get him
to stop, but Tetsuo is beyond controlling himself:  `MY BODY WON'T LISTEN TO
POWERS!!  KANEDA ESCAPE!!!!'  And he throws Kaneda out of the mess that his
body has become.
(Out of the many scenes in AKIRA, this one is the most horrifying  and
sickening  of them all.  However, there is a point that this scene is trying
to make:  we are not only horrified -and filled with pain- at Tetsuo's
transformation, first on the inside, then the outside as well, but we also feel
sorry for him  after all, this wasn't his fault.  Come to think of it, I can
relate to this kind of struggle, as I had a decision I had to make on whether
or not I was going to be a part of the real world, or stay forever enclosed in
my nutshell.)
During all this, the three Children appear and kneel before what remains of
Akira, calling for his help.  Suddenly, the bottles containing Akira burst open
and Akira regenerates himself.  (I was really quite surprised, and shocked to
discover that he is a `kid' like the Children.  I thought he'd be something
terrifying.  But then, we already have enough terrifying scenes like this.) 
His full power bursts forth, recreating the phenomenon that demolished Tokyo 38
years ago, giving Tetsuo the only peace he can ever know.
Kyoko teleports the Colonel to safety, but Kaneda is caught in the explosion. 
The Children sacrifice themselves to save him, as well as the whole world and
all of Neo-Tokyo.  Inside the explosion, Kaneda experiences several flashes of
Tetsuo's life:  Riding down the highway in Kaneda's wake, the strange
experiment that gave four ordinary children psychic ablities, and the first
time he met Kaneda.  This sequence culminates not only with Neo-Tokyo being
destroyed (well, not totally), but with Kaneda finding himself on a mound of
rubble in the middle of the wreckage, making peace with what remains of Tetsuo
 a bright dot of light  and reuniting with Kay and Kai.  We also see that the
colonel has survived the terrible apocalypse, having taken cover (along with
Kay and Kai) underneath the tunnel.  The apocaylpse is over, and as the sun
comes out through the clouds, Kaneda and his friends return to Neo-Tokyo.
We are then, at this point, supposed to realize that this is not an end, but a
beginning, as we hear the Children's voices:  `Someday, we will be.  It has
already begun.'
In a place that is no place (where we get some visuals that will leave one's
mouth hanging wide open), a voice is heard:  `I am Tetsuo.'
If the above has you baffled, and sick, I apologize, but that's what happens
throughout AKIRA.  What happens in the film is not terribly well explained, and
it will take only a strong mind (and stomach) to sit through two hours of
confusion and violence.  It was not until recently, when I viewed the film
again at the age of 18, on May 13, 2000, that I managed to acquire both and sit
through this film.  This time around, though, I wasn't as disturbed as I was
when I first viewed it five years ago.  I guess it takes time in order to do
certain things that you weren't able to do back then.
What struck me most about the film was the way it was trying to convey a
message, in spite of its gritty atmosphere.  Director Katsuhiro Ohtomo, who
wrote the original comic book, attempts to show us that humanity can be used
for both good and evil purposes.  But does he succeed in conveying what he
wants us to feel, or does he just deliver eyepopping visuals with an unclear
story?  I'm feeling like he succeeded in doing both.  While the storyline does
have a point, and the characters somewhat interesting (Like most Japanese
animated films, the characters here are not all bad or all good, but, well,
human.  The only real villain could be the powers that cause Tetsuo to go mad,
since it results with his presumed death at the end.), it is somewhat difficult
to follow along.  People who have never read the original comic (me included)
may be baffled by some of the parts of the film that are a little more unclear.
 (The ending and the concept involving Akira had me CONFUSED, if you want an
example.)  I guess part of the problem has to be that Ohtomo was trying to
squeeze 1256 pages of his graphic novel into a 124 minute movie.  This causes
the overall result of the film's storyline to be a cacophony of confusion,
despite supporting a strong message and complicated characters.
Incidentally, the critics found the storyline to be too confusing as well. 
However, they also found the animation to be an impressive achievement. 
There's no doubt about it that the animation is nothing short of spectacular. 
Most of the animated films from Japan I had seen before AKIRA had beautiful
colors, but there were not anywhere as fast - or grisly - as this.  The action
scenes are very breathtaking and masterfully executed.  In fact, I recently
found out from my cousin that the animators doubled the frame rate per second
of most animated films to make such scenes possible.  It really shows here. 
Unfortunately, when the film begins to get violent  and bloody  we get to see
plenty of it, and it almost makes us difficult for us to remember that this is
just a cartoon.  That is what occasionally makes watching AKIRA a painful task.
The result of the spectacular visuals is the time and effort (and money) spent
on the making of AKIRA.  Katsuhiro Ohtomo and his animation staff spent Ľ1.1
billion to make AKIRA, which, at the time, was quite a lot of money considering
how much it usually costs to produce an animated film in Japan.  (However, some
other Japanese animated films such as WINGS OF HONNEAMISE and PRINCESS MONONOKE
have cost a lot more than this.)  The work made into making AKIRA was worth it,
because the film was a big box office hit in Japan.  Unfortunately, I have no
data on how much it grossed in that country.
AKIRA was dubbed into English by Streamline Pictures (a company which got a
really bad name with its English dubs on Japanese animated films) and released
in the US around 1990.  The film grossed only $439,162 in its limited US
release, but it managed to become a best-seller on video.  Strangely, the
English dub affected my entertainment value of the film a little the second
time I saw it (even though I got used to it by the last half hour of the film).
 The problem isn't the translation from Japanese to English (It is a difficult
language to translate; believe me, I wasn't so successful on some attempts to
translate some CDs I imported from Japan), but by the acting.  The actors,
which the exception of some, sound like they don't have experience on matching
their words in synch wth the lip movement.  In addition, it almost sounds like
they aren't very experienced at acting.  I don't usually have a problem with
most dubs, unlike most Anime fans, but surprisingly this one bothered me a
little bit more than most.  However, like I said before, I got accustomed to it
as the film reach its last couple of minutes.
To sum it up, AKIRA is ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN.  It's dark plot and very
grisly visuals will scare them away and undoubtedly give them nightmares for
weeks.  The target audience for AKIRA is one that can stand to overlook its
violent images and see a gem beneath the grit.  But is it really necessary to
successfully achieve such feelings?  I personally don't like movies with
violence, but because I'm older, I at least was able to handle the grisly
images better than I did when I was 15.  However, I have failed to understand
just why violent movies appeal to such a wide audience.  Still, the animation
was dazzling enough for me to give it a passing grade, as you can probably
judge from the rating above.

the story, but it also explains a whole lot more about the film.  Be sure to go

Review for Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, The (1949)
Disney has recently released two new videos on May 26, it's 11th masterpiece,
The Adventures Of Ichabod & Mr. Toad and another direct-to-home sequel, The
Brave Little Toaster To The Rescue.  The question is, which one is good and
which one isn't?  You'll find out here.
Before I go into detail about this movie, there are a few things you should
know about it.  This film was created at a time when the studio was troubled. 
Walt was still around, but World War II had caused his studio to lose its
momentum that always gave its films, such as Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs,
Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi.  Because of money shortages (and the
Latin market cut off), Walt Disney and his staff had no choice; they couldn't
make another full-length feature, so they decided to do a multi-feature film. 
In other words, a compilation of various cartoons that had been in production
before, during, or after the war.  Two of these compilations were multi-feature
films, Make Mine Music and Melody Time.  The other two were double-feature
films, Fun And Fancy Free and the very film that I just mentioned earlier, The
Adventures Of Ichabod & Mr. Toad.
Don't be fooled by the title.  This was originally supposed to have been
called Two Fabulous Characters, but Walt probably thought the name would be a
disgrace.  The Adventures Of Ichabod & Mr. Toad is two famous stories given the
typical Disney treatment, Kenneth Grahame's The Wind In The Willows and
Washington Irving's The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.  Both featurettes were well
received by the public and critics.  Leonard Maltin, in his The Disney Films
book, particularly praised The Wind In The Willows for featuring "some of the
finest work the studio ever did".  This may be stretching things too far, but
The Wind In The Willows is nevertheless an entertaining, well-executed cartoon,
and it holds well to this day.
For those of you who don't know, here is how the story goes:  It's about a
toad, J. Thaddeus Toad, squire of the famous Toad Hall.  Now he has three
friends, Ratty, Moley, and Angus MacBadger.  Now Toad is not your average
every-day man; he has a tendency to get into maniasmanias that cause him to be
in greater debts than ever (near bankruptcy, in fact).  One particular mania
riding is a gypsy's carriage with a happy-go-lucky horse, Cyril.  As they ride
along the countryside singing, "We're merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily on our
way to nowhere in particular" they cause damage everywhere.  This is SO
shocking, in fact, that Ratty and Mole literally have to lock him up to prevent
something much worse happening.  Of course, this is exactly what happens.  Toad
gets obsessed with getting a motor car (even if it is stolen by a gang of
crafty weasels, which in this case, it is), and trades Toad Hall for itan act
that results with him arrested and put on trial.  All seems hopeless until
Winky, a pompous bar tender is called on to testify.  Only he can tell the
truth, but he tells a different side of the story: "You tried to sell me a
stolen motor car."  Toad lands in jail, but Cyril bails him out, and there is a
long, extended escape scene which includes a train chase.  The chase ends when
Toad jumps off the train into the river below (as they are passing over a
bridge, leaving the cops behind).  After getting himself out of the water (this
is never shown, so I have no idea how he gets out of there with his ball 'n
chain), he heads to his friends, who have discovered, courtesy of MacBadger,
that Winky is actually the leader of the weasels whom Toad traded Toad Hall for
the motor car.  They plan to get the deed back from Winky so they can prove
Toad's innocence.  It isn't easy.  They have to sneak in the back way of Toad
Hall and battle the weasels to retrieve the deed (by the way, this scene is
awesome, and strikingly staged; running around on the floor, swinging from the
chandeliersdon't try this at home!, and literally dropping in on a snoring
Winky to retrieve the paper).  Eventually, they succeed, and Toad is proven
innocent.  You might think that Toad may be, as the narrator (Basil Rathbone)
tells us, a "new toad", but that is not the case.  He has found a new
maniaairplanes.
To call The Wind In The Willows, as Maltin did, the finest piece of work ever
to be done by Disney may be stretching things too far, but there is much to
enjoy in this film.  There is a great cast of characters, and a couple of
amusing scenes.  One such amusing scene in particular is when Ratty starts
yakking away at Toad on his foolishness.  And how does Toad respond?  By
holding his hands over his ears, that's how! (As he does this, the soundtrack
becomes muted; a very nice touch).  It is moments like this (and the
unforgettable characters) that make The Wind In The Willows worth a look.  I
give it a ****1/2 out of *****.
The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow, on the other hand, is another story.  While it is
equally well staged, it is a trifle lackluster.  The problem might be in the
choice of Bing Crosby as the narrator.  He was, at the time of the film, a
popular choice during the Depression area.  However, to this day, he comes off
as lame and annoying.  He goes a little bit too far in narrating the story
(he's too over dramatic), and his singing (or what you would call it), along
with his humorous occasional "bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-boo-boo-boo-boo" don't help
much.  However, at the scene of the Halloween party at Van Tassel where tough
bully Brom Bones tells schoolmaster Ichabod Crane (who, by the way, has a habit
for snitching a few foods here and there) the story of the dreaded Headless(!)
Horseman, things do start to get more interesting.  Why is Brom telling Ichabod
such a terrible story?  Both of them are in love with the beautiful (and over
exaggerated) Katrina Van Tassell.  Ichabod has succeeded in sweeping Katrina
off her feet (not literally), and Bones is none too happy about that.  So to
buzz Ichabod off, he scares him to death with this tale, through song (one of
the more bouncy ones in this featurette).  Things REALLY get creepy when
Ichabod starts to ride home across his trusty steed, Gunpowder, where the sky
is dark, the forest menacing (the crickets chirp "Ichabod", and the frogs croak
"Headless Horseman".  Really scary, all right)  and Mr. Headless himself, with
a horrifyingly evil laughter, and a scary, black costume, red cape, and black
steed.  This is where things REALLY get more exciting; there is a spectacular,
long, extended chase scene in which Ichabod tries to outrun the Headless
Horseman.  How can he escape this monster?  He must cross the bridge of Sleepy
Hollow, for, as Brom Bones has told him, "Once you cross that bridge, my
friends, the ghost is throughhis power ends!"  When he FINALLY makes it across
the bridge, the Headless Horseman does not become powerless, his head (a
pumpkin) is whirled across the bridge, which explodes into a raging fire.  The
next morning, we see Ichabod's hat and a shattered pumpkin, but we don't see
Ichabod anywhere!  What happened to him?  Was he really spirited by the
Headless Horseman?  Or is he still alive, and married to a wealthy widow in a
distant county?  Whatever the answers, Bones succeeds in winning Katrina's
heart, and takes her to the altar.
Who are we rooting for in this story?  That is the most puzzling question one
could ask of The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.  Ichabod Crane barely says anything,
he just hums, trips across limbs, and try to win over the ladies.  Brom Bones
is too mean-spirited to be a sympathetic character; he plays tricks on Ichabod
everywhere he goes.  None of the characters in this sequence are well defined,
so it becomes difficult for us to feel happy or sad when this darkly
entertaining tale comes to a close.  Also, as mentioned before, Crosby spends
too much time showing off rather than seriously telling the story.  All that
said, The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow benefits greatly from its long, extended,
hair-raising, heart-thumping climax, and for that, if not anything else, I
enjoyed it.  I give it *** out of *****.
My average rating for The Adventures Of Ichabod & Mr. Toad is ***1/2.  It's
not the best feature Disney has every done, but if you're a diehard
Disney-Masterpiece collector fan (I certainly amI own almost every single film
Disney released on video, if you pardon me for bragging) it's yet another must
buy for your Disney collection.
THE BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER TO THE RESCUE
Disney is really going nuts on its Brave Little Toaster franchise.  The
original The Brave Little Toaster, based on a children's novella by Thomas M.
Disch, was a delightful animated piece of entertainment with hilarious
characters, such as the brave little toaster himself, a bright lamp, a
wisecracking radio, a sweet electric blanket, and a grumpy vacuum cleaner (They
have personalities of their own).  It was so enjoyable, in fact, that it won
the 1988 Parents' Choice Television Award.
It was followed, ten years later, by a direct to home video sequel, The Brave
Little Toaster Goes To Mars.  While it did have its moments, such as the
as-always funny characters, and gag lines "Houston, we have a problem!", the
whole film wasn't as much as enjoyable or delightful as it was silly and
formulaic (a toaster and appliances going to Mars?!  How ridiculous!).  It was
almost like a "cheap deal", and not anywhere near half as good as the original.
Now, Disney has released another sequel, The Brave Little Toaster To The
Rescue.  My guess is, is that they are trying to make another trilogy, like
they did with Aladdin.  What made the Aladdin trilogies enjoyable where the
fact that it took a lot of effort and heart to bring them to life.  The Toaster
direct-to-home-sequel, however, was a "cheap deal".  This one had me suspicious
since I was ticked off by the previous sequel, but this was a turnabout of
expectations:  this one is surprisingly decent.  It's not really a "sequel",
but a prequel to the Mars movie.  It's more exciting, it has more heart, and
while it falls far short of being as good as the original movie, this is still
a great improvement over the first sequel.
It starts out with Rob and his girlfriend, Chris, driving towards college
(with a catchy song playing), explaining that he can't wait for their
graduation and anniversary (Anniversary?  Anniversary about what?  Even Rob
doesn't know that).  He drops Chris off and heads towards an informatory
hospital, where his beloved appliances, Toaster, Blanky, Kirby, Lampy, and
Radio, who come to life when no one else is around, via the toys in Toy Story,
are awaiting his return (He is their master, after all).  After some by play,
Lampy jumps out of the window (with the help of Radio, who is pretty funny in
his own way, considering that this isn't Jon Lovitz).  He then "freezes" in his
lamp position when he arrives at the Master's dormitory, where Rob works on
some sort of assignment.
Meanwhile, the appliances back home hear complaints about "abandonment" from
the cranky rat, Ratso (from the unbelievably stupid Mars sequel).  It is hear
we meet some new characters.  One is a mother cat named Maisie, who worries
that the first thing her kittens will see is Ratso (there is some by play about
this).  Another is a tiny Chihuahua, Alberto, whose leg is busted.  There is
also a snake, Murgetroid, who spittles every time he hisses ("I'd recommend
steering clear of such words with too much s-s-s-sibiliance, pal," comments
Ratso, when he gets spitted on by the snake.)  Finally, there's a wise man in
the group, in the form of a monkey, Sebastian (not the crab).  Anyhow, the room
is a mess from a party last night (they invited party friendly Dobermans over
to have some fun), and they have to, as Radio states, "mambo out of this mess".
 This they do, while breaking into song, where the animals reminisce when they
first met Rob, with the exception of Sebastian (while Ratso covers his ears, as
the most anti-song fans probably will; I enjoyed the song, though).  Ratso runs
away, after reminding the appliances that they are "too old" for the Master,
and that he only takes Lampy with him because he can "do something useful". 
Blanky makes a fuss about it, although Toaster tries to reassure everyone that
they are high closest friends.
Meanwhile, Robby is working away on his computer, when he is interrupted by
the abrupt appearance of his assistant, Mack, who is pretty jealous about Rob
(he even wants to have Chris).  When Chris comes about, something terrible
happens:  electricity goes off for some reason, and Rob's newly completed
animal-thesis work is completely erased on the computer!  He blames the
computer for this, and he and Chris go off to fetch Charlie, who can probably
help out (after some by play the computer says that he SHOULD have saved it,
which he didn't).  This is to no avail; there is a virus affecting the computer
systems, now Rob won't be able to graduate!  Even a little reassurance from
Chris won't help.
At the same time, the appliances learn from Sebastian that there is a testing
laboratory where the humans there were cruel to him (so THAT explains his
broken arm!).  The appliances reassure everybody that the master will take care
of him (even though Ratso doesn't trust him).  Then, everybody goes to bed,
after a little bit of "late-night humor" from Radio.
Rob is still depressed about his lost file, but Chris states that his file is
just "hiding".  Rob is not any happier when she tries to use Kirby to clean up
the kitty litter (Kirby gets a sick stomach afterwards), and Chris responds by
walking out on Rob.  This is a bad day for Rob:  He's lost both his thesis AND
his girlfriendand his RAT!  (Ratso is heading towards the basement, avoiding
stampeding rats "Hey, I'm walking here!" he shouts at them.)  Rob decides to
write a better, newer report, even if it takes him a whole day.  Mack comes by
and Rob leaves him in charge of the house.  This is a bad mistake, because Mack
plots to send the animals to the testing laboratory in exchange for money. 
"I'm so bad!" he says.
Lampy returns, who tells them how sad the Master is.  The appliances vow to
help out, but they don't know how to use any computers.  Sebastian helps out
("Monkey see, monkey do"), after they get him up onto the chair.  (Listen to
Radio's wisecracks during this scene, they are really funny)  The computer
comes to life, and of course, there's another enjoyable (or annoying to those
of you who hate songs) song about computer technology and the internet.  It
echoes the gospel songs in Hercules, but it's more tolerable.  After that, the
computer gets a virus (beginning to crash), and starts to show secret
passwords, one which is ANIMAL TRANSPORTATION!  They all pull out the plug just
as it crashes.  Sebastian then tells them that the animals are going to be sent
to Tartarus Laboratory, which he was talking about earlier.
We cut back to Rob and Chris (who has forgiven him, by the way), and we learn
that he has to retype all 612 pages (including the title page), and that he
remembers the anniversary of when he first met Chris.  Still, it's a bad day
for him.
It's a bad day for the animals, too, for they don't want to leave (although
I'm sure Ratso wouldn't mind).  Leave it to Toaster to think of a plan.  Ratso
mentions that he saw a malfunctioning (er, sneezing) computer in the basement. 
Mack comes by, and locks the animals in their cages (he also mentions that at
midnight tonight, they're history).  The appliances free Ratso and head to the
basement, save Kirby (he's too big to fit, and he'll be the perfect guard for
the animals).  He fails to save the animals, from Mack, however.
Meanwhile, the appliances head to the basement where they discover the
computer, who is ancient and doing loud sneezes.  His name is Wittgenstein, and
he thinks he's useless, or outmoded (he's been down there 4,999,450,852,312
nanoseconds, ever since transistors were invented).  He explains this through a
song, which is the weakest in the film (although funny to this reviewer).  His
light bulbs break as he sings, thanks to a couple of sparks.  He also explains
that he knows of Mack's evil plan to transport the animals to the factory, and
that he had been trying to warn Rob (so THAT explains his computer crash!). 
Unfortunately, as he mentions, he is not PC compatible.  He also explains that
he's made of tubes, and that one of his tubes is busted, which is his only life
source.  Ratso and Radio set off, or rather gallop off, to find a replacement
in the camp storage supplies.  After much difficulty, they manage to find one
last tube, but they break it buy getting into a fight.  However, Wittgenstein
still manages to mention that the animals are being transmitted.  And he dies,
and Radio takes the blame; he takes out his last circuit to help Wittgenstein. 
Wittgenstein is saved, thanks to Radio's self-sacrifice, and is able to print
out a plan for the appliances (boo-boo proof), and alert the master about
Mack's plan.
The animals have been loaded into the truck, and Rob is after them with Chris,
while Toaster and the others chase after the truck on a table top piloted by
Kirby powered by Wittgenstein's modem.  There is a long, extended chase scene,
which of course, works out okay.  Maisie appears to be dead, but of course,
she's all right.  Ratso cries out of happiness in this scene.
Afterwards, the master finds Radio and tries to find a new circuit for him,
while Wittgenstein recovers Rob's thesis report and gets it printed.  The
kittens open their eyes, and Ratso is the first thing that they see!  They even
play with him.  This scene is so sweet.
Rob and Chris leave, secure with the fact that the animals will be taken to
well taken to new homes where they will be looked after.  Ratso comes along
with the master and mistress.  But what about Radio?  Well, his circuit is
restored to him, thanks to Chris.  By the way, Rob has also asked Chris to be
his wife.  How happier can this ending be?
If you think The Brave Little Toaster To The Rescue will be just as bad as The
Brave Little Toaster Goes To Mars, think again!  The exciting, emotional story
and the hilarious characters, including the show stealing ones, along with a
little more drama and action to top it all off, make this sequel good
entertainment.  Still, while not as good as The Brave Little Toaster, this 3rd
movie is pleasant enough for what it is.  And for that, I give it ***1/2 out of
*****.  Whether you want it for your collection is another question, but its
definitely one to rent, especially if you're a Toaster fan.
Both videos are splendid entertainment to come from the folks at Disney. 
Let's hope they continue to release good entertainment titles

Title
Review for Mulan (1998)
After the outrageous disappointment that was HERCULES, Disney animation has
recovered.  MULAN is positive proof of that.  And no wonder!  This film has
been a pet project at the Disney Animation Studio in Florida for five years,
first named China Doll, and at a staggering cost of $100 million.  The result
is a delightful, exciting piece of entertainment to come from the Disney
studio.  On my top ten favorite Disney films, MULAN is my second favorite
Disney film of all time, next to THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME.
The film opens with a stunning view of the Great Wall of China.  On the top,
we see a soldier pacing back and forthuntil the Huns and their leader, the
ruthless Shan-Yu breach the wall.  General Li informs the Emperor of this, and
he commands him to send parchments to every family in China, searching for men
powerful enough to defeat the Huns.  Meanwhile, Mulan is running late to her
meeting with the Matchmaker, and once she arrives on her horse, Khan, her
mother wastes no time in getting her bathed, powdered, and dressed up for her
meeting.  Her grandmother even gives her a cricket named Cri-Kee, just for
luck.  The meeting, however, turns out to be a disaster, and the Matchmaker
tells Mulan that she will never be able to bring her family honor.
Heartbroken and convinced that she has dishonored her family, Mulan leads Khan
home and sits in the garden all by herself.  Her father, Fa Zhou, comforts her
by showing her the blossoms in the garden, including one that is late.  `I'll
bet that when it blooms,' he says, `It will be the most beautiful of all.' 
Then, Chi-Fu, the Emperor's aide, rides into the village, announcing the
invasion of the Huns and says that one man from each family must serve in the
Imperial Army.  Fa Zhou agrees to come, despite an injury he had suffered in an
earlier war.
Mulan, however, knows that if her father goes into war, he will never be able
to return.  So that night, she decides to steal her father's armor and
disguises herself as a boy to take her father's place.  When her parents and
grandmother find out that she's gone, they start praying to the Ancestors for
help.  Besides, they know that the penalty for a woman impersonating a man is
death!
The Ancestors heed the Fa family's prayers, and summon a disgraced little
dragon, Mushu, who had failed to be a Family Guardian and since then, wants a
second chance, to awaken the Great Stone Dragon to send Mulan home.  Mushu goes
outside to do so, but instead accidentally breaks the statue!  He then decides
to go after Mulan and make her a war hero so that he might be able to regain
his post as a Guardian.  Aided by Cri-Kee, Mushu finds Mulan in the forest,
pondering over how she is going to get into the camp.
Mushu tries to help Mulan out by advising her how to act like a man in the
army, but the first thing he does is cause Mulan to start a battle between the
soldiers.  When the army's captain, Li Shang, appears, everyone blames Mulan
for the trouble.  Shang orders the army to clean up the mess that they made in
the fight, and asks who this `newcomer' is.  Mulan changes her name to `Ping'
to save her identity so that she would serve in the army (but not before she
struggles for such a name; one of the film's funniest sequences).
This leads to a song, `I'll Make A Man Out Of You', where Shang teaches the
army discipline and strength, by having them tie a bronze disk to each wrist
and attempt to climb a tall pole to retrieve an arrow.  Everyone fails,
including Mulan.  Shang is ready to dismiss her, but Mulan tries one last time
by tying the disks together and using them to pull herself up the pole.  Then,
the army, inspired by Mulan's strength, works hard to improve their military
skills to be ready to confront Shan-Yu.  In doing so, Mulan makes friends with
three comic soldiersthe huge Chien-Po, the tall, skinny Ling, and the short,
gravel voiced Yao.
However, Mulan remembers to cover her true identity, especially when she goes
off to bathe in a lake.  However, her friends come along, throwing off their
clothes!  Mushu covers Mulan's disguise by diving into the water and biting
Ling.  `Snake!' Ling shouts, and they hop onto a rock while Mulan escapes,
commenting, `I never want to see naked men again!'
In the meantime, Chi-Fu, unimpressed by Shang's efforts to make a great army
out of these `boys', is prepared to make a criticizing report to the Emperor. 
Not about to let his plan go wrong, Mushu creates a fake letter to Chi Fu from
Shang's father, General Li (with the help of Cri-Kee, of course), saying that
they are needed at the front.
Chi Fu falls for it, and the next day, Shang and his troops march off to war,
singing about a `girl worth fighting for' when they encounter a burned down
village.  Among the destroyed houses and dead bodies, they find General Li's
helmetand know at once that General Li is dead!  Shang then orders the army to
make for the Imperial City by going through the Tung-Shao Pass, hoping to
arrive before the Huns do.
As they cross through the pass, however, they encounter Shan Yu and his army. 
They fire cannons at the Huns, hoping to destroy them, to no avail.  The
situation takes a turn for the worst when Shan-Yu and 10,000 Huns begin
charging down the mountainside.  Mulan defeats the army by firing the last
cannon at the mountaintop, causing an avalanche.  The wall of snow burries the
Huns and Shan-Yu, but then it comes right towards the Chinese army!  Mulan
rescues Shang from the thundering snow, who says that Mulan has his trust
because of that.
At this point, Mulan faints from a wound that she has suffered from Shan-Yu. 
She is cared for by the medic, but then, her identity is revealed!  But instead
of killing Mulan, Shang throws her sword down, repaying Mulan for saving his
life.  Then, the army leaves her in the snow and moves out.
Mulan is heartbroken, and Mushu, finally admitting that he had risked her life
to regain his position as a Guardian, suggests telling Fa Zhou the truth. 
Mulan is about to, but she hears, from the distance, that Shan-Yu and his
toughest warriors have survived the avalanche and are heading for the Imperial
City!
Mulan then decides to go to the Imperial City and warn the army.  But when she
tries to tell Shang, he refuses to listen.  When he goes up to the emperor,
presenting Shan-Yu's sword, a falcon snatches the sword and carries it back to
Shan-Yu, on the palace roof.  The Emperor is then captured, but Mulan comes up
with an idea, and convinces Ling, Yao, Chien-Po, and even Shang, to help out. 
They disguise themselves as women so that they can sneak into the palace; they
take out the guards while Shang races to save the Emperor from certain doom. 
Mulan and the others help rescue the Emperor, and she outsmarts Shan-Yu by
leading him onto the palace roof where Mushu sends a rocket careening into him.
 The rocket carries Shan-Yu to the fireworks tower, and there is a tremendous
explosion.
When all is calm, the Emperor thanks Mulan and offers to make her a part of
his council, but Mulan, having been away from home for too long, says that she
must return.  Before she leaves, the Emperor hands her his pendant `so that
your family will know what you have done for me,' he says, and the sword of
Shan-Yu, `so that the world will know what you have done for China.'
Mulan returns home to Fa Zhou, presenting the Emperor's gifts to her father,
but Fa Zhou instead says that the greatest gift and honor `is having you for a
daughter.'  Even Shang realizes how special Mulan is, because he follows her
all the way home.  Mulan invites him to stay for dinner, and he agrees;  at the
family temple, Mushu has finally regained his position as a Family Guardian.
MULAN is truly one of Disney's better animated films.  Everything about this
movie is almost quite excellent.  The artwork is authentic and beautiful, the
story dramatic and meaningful, the characters effective and well cast (They
used mostly Asian actors, except for Mushu, amusingly voiced by Eddie Murphy),
and the music is just great. 
The best scene in the whole film is where the Huns charge down the mountain
and battle our heroes.  The computer generated animation is absolutely great
and almost reminds me of the stampede scene from THE LION KING.  What I really
like about the film, though, is a lot of things.  The heroine is more, well,
heroic than most other Disney `heroines', first of all.  It's easy to
understand her emotions and feelings, especially when she is upset about the
disastrous meeting with the grouchy Matchmaker.  So when she finally saves
China from Shan-Yu and his Hun Army, it almost made me want to stand up and
cheer!  Second, I really LOVE the way Disney took advantage of the sound of
silence throughout the film.  It enhances the drama throughout the story.  For
example, in one scene, we hear silence as Mulan and her family are eating
dinner, but then the silence is broken when Mulan says `You shouldn't have to
go!' to Fa Zhou (wonderfully played by Soon-Tek Oh).  Third, there is no
romance in the story at all.  That is a smart move on Disney's part, because in
every Disney animated film (except for a few, I guess), they have just
basically told the same love story over and over and over again: here they just
give a little hint of it at the end.  Finally, I love the way the film switches
emotional gears.  One moment you feel like crying for Mulan when her identity
is revealed in front of Shang and exiled from the army, then the next thing you
know, you will find yourself laughing hysterically at Mushu's wisecracks.  This
thing has worked in THE LION KING, and here Disney has made another film
equivalent to that same film. 
The music itself is something really worth describing here. The songs by
Matthew Wilder and David Zippel aren't as memorable as those in, say, THE LION
KING, but they are above average and better than the snappy, yet unmemorable
gospel songs in HERCULES.  Some have complained that the worst song in the film
is the song over the closing credits, `True To Your Heart', saying that it is
out of character and has nothing to do with the story.  Okay, so maybe that
song doesn't have anything to do with MULAN, but it is both enjoyable and
links well to the message of the story.  You must be true to yourself.  That is
another thing I loved about MULAN, not to mention it's tear jerking ending. 
But the very best thing about the music is the underscore written by Jerry
Goldsmith.  After the unoriginal, recycled underscore from HERCULES, Goldsmith
uses his theory and powers to create an evocative landscape of China, not to
mention the exciting cue over the Hun Battle scene (WOW! What a cue!).  The
score is SO great, it's easy to forget that you are watching a Disney animated
film.  By the way, the score was nominated for an Academy Award (which was good
news for Disney, since their last animated feature, HERCULES, failed to get
nominated for Best Score, despite a Best Song nomination for `Go The
Distance').   Too bad it lost to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, though.
There are a few minor things I could criticize, such as ridiculously executed
scenes (i.e. The Huns being buried in a snow avalanche and coming out
unscathed.  Since when is this realistic?) and Mushu at first seems American,
but later on, as the film progresses, he becomes more connected with the story.
 But such criticisms seem so laughable since this is one of Disney's truly
better films. 
Overall, I enjoyed MULAN very much, having seen it six times in the theaters,
and so did many people and critics who went to see this film.  Roger Ebert
called the film `an impressive achievement ranking it up there with THE LION
KING.' and USA Today was really impressed by the whole film, due to its
beautiful artwork and a truely heroic main character.
But not everyone liked MULAN; Janet Maslin of The New York Times was not
impressed.  She condemned the film as `the most formulaic and inert of all
Disney movies raises the bar for violence of children's television.'  Excuse
me, Ms. Maslin, but who are you to say that this film raises the bar of
violence for children's television?  `The most formulaic and inert of all
Disney movies'?  I don't think so!
Even The Los Angeles Times had plenty of quibbles about this film, stating
that, though Mulan is a good female role, the story, music, and the characters
were formulaic.  Geez!  What was his problem?
As for box office receipts, the film did not get off the ground in China,
partially because people were outraged at the way Disney changed around the
character of Mulan, and of motion picture piracy that had happening in China
for quite a while.  Elsewhere, however, MULAN proved to be a bigger hit than
THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and HERCULES (both which landed at $100 million
domestically), grossing over $120 million domestically.  It went on to gross
$116 million in the Non-USA, totalling the film's worldwide box office gross to
a stunning $237 million.  And so it was that MULAN proved to be the beginning
of a whole new era for the Disney studio.  It remains a modern masterpiece to
this day, and should be honored by generations to come.

Review for Tarzan (1999)
When I first heard that Disney's next animated feature was going to be TARZAN,
I was almost horrified.  I was worried that Disney was going to make another
HERCULES (Sorry, JERK-ULES).  That effort was too overloaded with comedy (and
the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero),
and, after viewing it to this day, I find it a disgrace for Disney animation.
When I saw the trailers, I was thinking "Hmm... This isn't bad at all.  This
just might have potential."
When I bought the soundtrack, I was really quite surprised at how different it
sounded from most Disney features.  I have never really heard of Phil Collins,
nor have I heard of Mark Mancina, so I was wondering, how would these two make
this Disney flick spin?  I was pleasantly surprised:  The music is top-notch. 
Phil Collins' songs are terrific, percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to
break the formula for typical Disney songs.  The score from Mark Mancina was
also neat; it reminded me a bit of THE LION KING, but it was more original. 
So, the soundtrack wasn't bad at all, considering it was by two people I am not
familiar with.  This film could be good... but will it be?
When I finally went to see it (on opening day, as I tend to do with most
Disney animated features), my question was answered, in a complete turnabout of
expectations for me:  Disney's TARZAN is surprisingly decent.
The story starts out with Tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a
home on an island where apes live in peace.  However, one day, a vicious
leopard, Sabor, attacks and kills Tarzan's parents, leaving him (at this
time, a baby) alone-until Kala of the Apes rescues him.
Kala wants to raise the child as her own (she lost hers previously to Sabor),
but her mate, Kerchak is not too sure.  "It's not our kind," he says.  He
agrees, though, to let her take care of little Tarzan, but "that doesn't make
him my son."
Tarzan grows up, vowing to be "the best ape ever", but no matter how hard he
tries or what he does (at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend, Terk), he
just can't convince Kerchak that he is one of the apes, even when he defeats
Sabor in a battle.
One day, a new animal shows up:  humans.  This is where Jane comes into the
picture.  She is on an expedition with her father (Professor Porter), and a
despicable hunter (Clayton) searching for gorillas.  Tarzan rescues her when
she is chased by baboons, and soon they get to know each other.
Even though Tarzan falls in love with Jane, this causes things to go wrong. 
Clayton tricks Tarzan into taking him, Jane, and Porter to see the apes, who
are convinced that he has betrayed them.  Worse, Clayton has plotted to send
the gorillas to London for money.  Will Tarzan find out which family he belongs
to and save the apes?
I'm not gonna tell you, sorry.  You're gonna have to see for yourself.  And
see it you should; the animation is, as always, top notch, particularly when
Tarzan goes soaring through the trees (read that, skateboarding).  The DEEP
CANVAS computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which
Tarzan lives in.  In fact, it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel
animation combination in rival Disney animted films, such as Fox's ANASTASIA
and Dreamworks' PRINCE OF EGYPT.  Could it be that Disney was actually taking
ideas from their rivals?
The casting is fairly good.  Tony Goldwyn is emotionally believeable as Tarzan
(and to my relief, the animators have succeeded in not making him another
Hercules.  Nicely done), and Glenn Close is wonderful as Kala (She has a
beautiful singing voice, too, by the way).  Lance Henrikson as Kerchak somewhat
reminds me of Robby Benson's Beast voice, which makes him all the more
ferocious and gripping.  Minnie Driver had me a little worried at first as the
voice of Jane.  I thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film
(when I first saw the trailers), but when I saw the film, I didn't have a
problem with her.  I take back my insult on Driver.  It's nice to hear Nigel
Hawthorne do another voice for a Disney animated feature (He was Fflewdurr
Flamm in Disney's most underrated classic, THE BLACK CAULDRON); he is funny and
delightful as Professor Porter.  On the villiany side of the voices, Brian
Blessed (the guy who did Boss Nass in STAR WARS:  EPISODE I-THE PHANTOM MENACE)
brings a pompous, and later on vicious, voice to the sinister Clayton.  He
might not be the strongest character in the film (he's just a plain bad guy,
nothing else), but Blessed's vocal work contributes greatly.
But if there is any voice that I think steals the whole show, it should be
Rosie O'Donnell, who is hilariously funny as Terk.  She also has a fiesty
attitude ("I'm gonna kill ya!" she says, more than once).  I almost sung along
with her during one of the film's best moments, where the apes make a mess of
the human's camp, via song, er, scatting "Shoo-be-doo, da-be-dah".  I can see
why she wanted to have a rock song for the film, she's a good singer.
Not that she was the only funny character in the film, though.  Wayne Knight
(who played Stan in SPACE JAM) gives a whimsically funny style to Tantor, an
elephant who is especially worried about stepping into "un-sanitary" water. 
(Thankfully, there is no real sound of flatuence-That would have killed the
picture).
The songs, as I said before, are decent, mostly sung by Collins.  This sets a
new standard for Disney animated films because for the first time, the
characters do NOT sing.  I tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more
than some other guys would, but I found this to be a nice change of pace.
The story does have elements of comedy in it, but they also load it with
strong dramatic touches, which makes this film far better than the
unbelieveably uninspired HERCULES.
If there is anything disappointing about TARZAN, it might be the omission of
the 'N Sync version of "Trashing The Camp" from the film.  I heard it on the
soundtrack, and wondered where it was going to be.  I was upset that it wasn't,
because I had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like 'N Sync to see
TARZAN.  Oh, well...
Overall, I was enthralled with TARZAN.  I wouldn't hold it high the way I do
with MULAN or THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (my all-time favorite Disney
classics), but this film deserves a high place among Disney's greatest
achievements.  I give a nod to Disney for following up their spectacular *****
masterpiece, MULAN, with this great animated adaption of Egar Rice Burrough's
TARZAN.

Review for Black Cauldron, The (1985)
I remember seeing the trailer of THE BLACK CAULDRON on the PINOCCHIO video. 
It really scared me, and I didn't want to go see it.  However, after I heard
about how wonderful it was, I wanted to see it.  I didn't get a chance to do
so, until now.
The film, Disney's 25th animated feature, opens with a menacing shot of a
great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale: 
A long time ago in the land of Prydain, there was a King so evil, that his
spirit was captured in the cauldron.  It has been hidden for centuries, and
whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless
warriors, and with them rule the world and destroy it.
Then, we meet a farmer-wizard, Dallben, and his young apprentice, Taran. 
Taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' (They have a
pig named Hen-Wen).  One day, as he gives Hen Wen a nice warm bath, the pig
goes crazy, and Dallben then realizes, after watching Hen Wen's thoughts
through a bucket of water, that Taran must hide Hen Wen in the forest.  An evil
ruler known as the Horned King is searching for the Black Cauldron, and only
Hen Wen has the power to show its location.
Taran leads Hen Wen into the forest, but of course, he loses her, and tries to
go find her.  Along the way, he meets up with a mischievous little creature
named Gurgi, who desires `munchings and crunchings', much to his dismay
(besides, he stole an apple that Taran was trying to use to bring back Hen
Wen).  When he hears Hen Wen's squeal from far away, though, he races to her
rescueonly to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants.  Taran chases
after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the Horned King's castle from
far away.
Taran climbs the castle walls, and brings himself into the castle, where he
attempts to rescue Hen Wen.  He manages to do so, but he is himself captured
and thrown into the dungeon.  There, he meets Princess Eilonwy (and her magic
bauble, another thing which the Horned King was hoping to use to find the
cauldron), and the two escape through the deep castle walls.  Along the way,
Taran finds a sword in a burial chamber, and they rescue a comic bard named
Fflewdurr Flamm, who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie. 
The three manage to escape the Horned King's castle, but not before Taran
realizes that his sword is magic.
As they rest in the forest, Gurgi reappears, claiming to have found Hen Wen's
trail.  He leads Taran, Eilonwy and Fflewdurr, by way of `pig tracks', to a
whirlpool.  Suddenly, they all get sucked under, and they meet the fairy-like
Fairfolk.  Taran is reunited with Hen Wen, and informed that the Black Cauldron
is hidden in the land of Morva.  He then devises a crazy idea that if they can
destroy the cauldron, it would prevent the Horned King from destroying their
world.
With the help of a grumpy fairy named Doli, the four travelers manage to find
themselves at a mysterious cottage.  It turns out to be no ordinary cottage;
three comically strange witches inhabit the place.  When Taran tells them that
they are searching for the Black Cauldron, they agree to let him have itin
exchange for his sword.  Taran agrees, much to Eilonwy's horror, but at least
they get the Black Cauldron.  But  the cauldron can't be destroyed, only its
evil powers can be stopped.  The only way to do so is for a living being to
climb into it of his own free will never to return alive.
Things take a turn for the worse when the Horned King's henchmen capture
Taran, Eilonwy, and Fflewdurr, along with the Black Cauldron, and lead them
back to the castle.  Taran, Eilonwy, and Fflewdurr watch in horror as the
Horned King unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his
army of deathless warriors (this is the most horrifying scene in the film,
because here, a dead army comes alive).
Just when all seems lost, though, Gurgi reappears, and rescues Taran, Eilonwy,
and Fflewdurr.  Taran is about to jump into the Black Cauldron, but Gurgi stops
him, not wanting him to throw his life away.  Gurgi then jumps into the Black
Cauldron, and the deathless warriors decay.  Taran tries to find a way to
rescue Gurgi, but he is forced to do battle against the Horned King.  He kicks
the Horned King away, who is then magically sucked into the Black Cauldron,
where its powers immediately destroy him completely.  Taran, Eilonwy, and
Fflewdurr manage to escape from the Horned King's castle just as it
self-destructs.
The witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless Black Cauldron
away, but Fflewdurr stops them, saying that they `never give anything away,
they bargain'.  In response to this, the witches offer Taran his sword back,
but Taran instead has a new trade:  the cauldron for Gurgi.  The trade is made;
Gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group.
As Taran cradles him in his arms, though, Gurgi stirs-he is not dead after
all!  The happy group then returns home, where Hen Wen (brought home by the
Fairfolk once the dangers are past), Dallben, and even Doli, await their
triumphant return.
As spectacular as it sounds, THE BLACK CAULDRON really suffered a lot in its
past times.  Before Ron Miller was fired from his position as chairman of Walt
Disney Productions, he had bought a novel by Lloyd Alexander called THE BLACK
CAULDRON, a sword and sorcery tale for the studio.  Bringing this book to the
screen was the studio's fondest dream.  Miller, who entitled himself as the
executive producer, promised that they would do so after they had proved
themselves on other projects.
When Micheal Eisner and his executives arrived at the Disney animation studio,
the animators were struggling to complete THE BLACK CAULDRON.  By this time,
things had gone really rocky for the animation department.  Many of the
studio's old men had retired or died.  Therefore, the animators suffered a hard
time making this film.  Originally budgeted at $25 million, the costs raised to
$40 million because of constant changes on everythingand when it was finally
released on June 24, 1985, THE BLACK CAULDRON was greeted by praising reviews
from some critics, but somehow the film flopped.  The film was rated PG and the
film, although `Disneyfied' from Lloyd Alexander's CHRONICLES OF PRYDAIN (which
is what this film is based on), was much more scarier and darker than Disney's
other previous efforts, such as THE RESCUERS and THE FOX AND THE HOUND, which
is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it.
 In addition, other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and
`unmemorable', compared to other Disney animated features.  But whatever the
real reason, THE BLACK CAULDRON was a financial disaster, grossing only $21
million.  The failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department,
and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby Glendale, and it
seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's
reputation.  The next two Disney animated features, THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE
and OLIVER AND COMPANY, although a little more lighthearted than THE BLACK
CAULDRON, didn't do much better (although OLIVER AND COMPANY grossed much more
than THE BLACK CAULDRON and THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE).  Only with THE LITTLE
MERMAID did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features.
As for THE BLACK CAULDRON, it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary
time under the title TARAN AND THE MAGIC CAULDRON.  Finally, the studio locked
the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released.  Because
of all this, you might ask yourself, was THE BLACK CAULDRON really such a bad
movie?  The people who had seen the film didn't think so.  In fact, many people
had calls to Buena Vista Home Video requesting for the film, but of course,
they denied it.  For a while, it seemed like THE BLACK CAULDRON would NEVER be
released to video until September 1997, Disney released THE BLACK CAULDRON to
video in the United Kingdom.  Few people imported the video from England and
converted to NTSC (including me) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet (I
am included here), they got quite a treat.  But people who had bootleg copies
of THE BLACK CAULDRON noticed that in the scene where The Horned King raises
his army of deathless warriors, about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons
were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a U rating (in the UK, the U
rating means Universal:  Suitable for all ages, kinda like their own version of
G).  Somewhere online, a team of diehard THE BLACK CAULDRON fans signed a
petition that said, `Bring Back The Black Cauldron!', and because of that,
Disney finally decided to release the video to the United States.  Before that
time, rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed, like the UK
video, so that it would get a G rating, and that they would add in songs. 
Those rumors were put to rest when the Walt Disney Company announced that THE
BLACK CAULDRON *would* be released in its PG rated version.  Even still, when
it was finally released to the US, some reaction was mixed.  Some felt that it
was indeed cut, but some felt that it wasn't.  But these where only minor
criticisms which seemed laughable, since a film that was absent for thirteen
years was finally available.
As for myself, when I saw the movie for the first time (on converted NTSC
video), I didn't expect much at all.  In fact, I had heard so many mediocre
things about it, that I didn't think the film would ever be such a good film. 
Much to my surprise, when I saw the first few minutes of the film, I was asking
myself, "This is the same film everyone saw? The one that flopped at the box
office? The one that critics and filmgoers alike called "a bad movie"? This
doesn't seem like all of the above.  Instead, it's a classic in its own right. 
The film has a wonderful cast of characters. There's Taran (Grant Bardsley),
an Assistant Pig Keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper, the
story's hero. The critics have said that Taran is not likeable at all, but the
opposite is true. He is brave, loyal, and eventually learns a lesson about
friendship later on. There's a likeable character here! Not that he's the only
likeable character in the film.  There's Gurgi (John Biner), a lovable little,
uh, thing who remains loyal to Taran, even though they don't quite hit it off
at first. But another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman, a dwarf
named Creeper (Phil Fondacairo), who is loyal to the film's imaginative and
sinister villain, The Horned King (voiced gruesomely by John Hurt), yet he also
fears his neck. The other characters, including the sidekicks, a spunky, but
sweet princess named Eilonwy and the comic bard Fflewdurr Flamm, and three
comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret, although pleasant and
likeable, aren't quite as well rounded as they should be. 
The story itself is an adventurous one, a quest involving the mystical pig,
Hen Wen, the black cauldron itself, and an army of deathless ones with
everything: a hooking opening to a spectacular finale.  Elmer Bernstein's music
also tells the story perfectly, in a dark, yet calming manner.  The animation
itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the
darkest time of the studios. Even though there are some occasional effects that
are not quite good, like the ground opening when the Black Cauldron rises out
of the earth, the animation overall is top notch. 
Overall? This film is an entertaining endeavor. Fans unfamiliar to the Lloyd
Alexander CHRONICLES OF PRYDAIN will get a kick out of this one, except young
kids.  There are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than
Disney's other films (although some consider the stampede sequence from THE
LION KING and Frollo observing Esmeralda in the fires of hell in THE HUNCHBACK
OF NOTRE DAME are just as scary), which is the main reason why this film is
rated PG.  Fans familiar to the Lloyd Alexander series will recognize the
differences between the novel and the movie. Even though it doesn't have all of
the ingredients of a true Disney film, this film  is a classic in its own
right, and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given.
That better chance has finally come.  Whatever reason about why THE BLACK
CAULDRON was such a big failure seems to have disappeared, and the film has
finally achieved its place among Disney's most proudest achievements.  I can't
help but think though, whatever would have happened if THE BLACK CAULDRON *was*
a box office success?

Review for Toy Story 2 (1999)
Review:  `To infinity and beyond!!'
In 1995, Disney released a Pixar computer animated production, TOY STORY, a
***** film that went on to gross over $192 million domestically, and earn a
special Academy Award for director John Lasseter.  Three years later, Pixar
released A BUG'S LIFE, which pushed the limits of computer animation even
further, and it grossed over $140 million domestically.  Now, just in time for
TOY STORY's fourth anniversary (Happy anniversary!), Disney has released
Pixar's latest productionTOY STORY 2!  This is a big step up for Disney,
especially since all their sequels have gone straight-to-video.  This was a
money making way since their first sequel, THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER, did only
modest business at the box office.  Never before has Disney released another
animated film sequel theatrically, until now.  Speaking of which, this
production was originally intended to be a direct-to-home-video production, but
since the opening scenes turned out so spectacular, that they recreated a
theatrical feature for the sequel.
Those opening scenes are one of the first things that might make you think,
`Hmmmm, this sequel is pretty good!'  But they're more than `pretty good'. 
They are outrageously funny and exciting.  In these scenes, one Buzz Lightyear,
a space ranger in the Gamma Quadrant, fighting his way on the planet of his
evil rival, Emperor Zurg, blasting enemies with his laser, dodging booby traps,
and plucking out batteries (they are Zurg's power source).  But then, he
confronts the evil emperor himself (who, by the way, is a howlingly funny
parody of Darth Vader), only to get blasted to smithereens (PS:  It all turns
out to be a video game).
Then, we find ourselves in Andy's room, where we meet all our familiar pals
from the original TOY STORY:  Slinky the loyal dog, the cantankerous Mr. Potato
Head (softened up, this time around, by the presence of a Mrs. Potato Head he
got his wish from the first `story'), the insecure Rex (no need to mention
he's a dinosaur), love struck Bo Peep, and of course, the ever-lovable (and
hilarious) pull-string cowboy doll, Woody.
After Andy accidentally rips Woody's arm, he is forced to leave him on the
shelf while he heads away to summer, er, cowboy, camp.  Woody befriends Wheezy,
a tiny, lovable penguin with a broken squeaker, who gets chosen to be in a Yard
Sale Andy's mom recently puts up.  Woody assaults a rescue mission (with the
aid of another lovable character, Andy's recently bought pet dog, Buster), and
in doing so, accidentally falls into the clutches of one Al McWiggin.  This
greedy, fat guy (who is nicknamed Chicken Man) intends to sell Woody to a
museum in Japan.
Anyway, Buzz Lightyear rallies up Potato Head, Rex, Hamm, and Slinky, and they
set off to rescue Woody from Al's Toy Barn.
Meanwhile, Woody meets up with three other valuable collectibles, Jessie, a
cowgirl who has an attitude about human owners (her owner outgrew and ditched
her in a donation box, we later on discover), a endearingly loyal horse,
Bullseye, and the Prospector (aka Stinky Pete).  These collectibles are
actually characters of an early TV show WOODY'S ROUNDUP, which stars (you
guessed it).  They have been anticipating Woody, who will finally be able to
help make them famous at the museum (or else they'll be put back into storage).
 And they want Woody to go, whether or not he likes it.
Should Woody take the next plane flight to Japan, and be admired (if not
loved) by millions of children, or should he return home with his old friends
and accept the fact that one day Andy might outgrow him?
If you think I'm going to give you the answer, you are absolutely, positively,
100% incorrect.  You have to see the movie in order to find out.  And I do
mean, you HAVE to see it.  There's a lot to catch your eye, including the as
always dazzling 3-D computer animation from Pixar.  Yet one cannot help but
guess that the animation is also a step up from the recent A BUG'S LIFE.  It
is.  TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE's animation seemed somewhat experimental in
comparison to this.  Everything is 100% realistically rendered (even though
some of the humans look somewhat like action figures, but I'm not complaining),
from Andy's playroom to Al's Toy Barn, to a climactic finale at an airport.
The scenes are very masterfully executed, with a lot of quick cuts and stunts
here and there.  It's so exciting, in fact, that it almost feels like you're on
a roller coaster ride and that makes TOY STORY 2 all the more entertaining. 
There's a lot of breathtaking, and suspenseful action scenes, when the toys run
across the street disguised as cones dodging cars (and causing traffic
accidents), driving carsthe goofy way (a toy one, and THEN a REAL one No, I'm
not kidding!  They really do!), running up an air vent system, climbing,
battling, and almost falling, up an elevator shaft, through an airport conveyer
belt (which looks more labyrinthe than it has to, but that makes it more
exciting), and even jumping off airplanes.  Whew!  With a lot of action scenes
like that, one can tell that director John Lasseter and his colleagues have
been taking lessons from Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki (creator of
***** films such as KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, CASTLE IN THE
SKY, and even the recently released PRINCESS MONONOKE).  Incidentally, they do.
 I read in an article that whenever Lasseter and his colleagues feel stumped,
they pop in a laser disc of one of his filmsand they get inspiration from it. 
(Miyazaki would be pleased to hear that. ^_^)
And the film, like TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE, is JAM-packed with humor. 
There are a lot of funny one-liners from the characters (`Are you gonna turn me
into a mashed potato?'  `I'll pack your angry eyes, just in case') that fail
miserably to get old fast.  In addition, there is an EXTREMELY funny STAR WARS
parody at the beginning, and it seems to continue throughout the film,
particularly when Buzz Lightyear (well, another Buzz who thinks he's real, that
is) and Emperor Zurg have their duel in which Buzz discovers Zurg is (you
guessed it) his father.  Later on, we see them playing catch, as if they were
really attached to each other.  There's something funny and sweet about that. 
And the action scenes are also funny, particularly from the doings of the toys,
and how they handle certain situations.
What's important about a sequel, however, are two things.  First, it must be
something original, not just a sorry remake of the film that preceded it.  With
Pixar, you can tell that these guys know what makes a good film.  The story is
not rehashed from the original, it's different and equally enjoyable.  And even
though there are a couple of references to the original (Buzz asking the toys
`Did Woody give up when Sid had me strapped to a rocket?'  `Did Woody give up
when you guys [the toys] threw him out of that moving truck?', and later on him
telling Woody `You are a TOY!'), the overall level of the story completely
avoids being a remake of the original.
Another thing that is important is a thing that is required with all films. 
They have to have heart.  Pixar is definitely not afraid to have any of that in
any of their films.  The heart here is the message about how comforting toys
can be to kids.  When Jessie recalls the good old days with her former owner,
Emily, and their fun activities together (playing, swinging, and rolling around
in leaves), we are filled with feelings of what it's like to be a kid, and how
nice it is to have toys to comfort you.  When Emily starts to spend more time
with her friends and less time with Jessie, we feel, just as she does,
neglected, but we also are aware that this same thing happens in real life. 
Kids outgrow toys.  And what is real love anyway?  Being watched at from a
glass bottle by millions of kids, or being with someone who really loves you? 
This is something to think about.
With the return of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and all the other actors who gave
life to the characters in the original TOY STORY, one expects nothing less than
enthusiasm and excellence.  These expectations are more than completely
fulfilledthey surpass them.  The cast hams it up (no offense, Miss Piggy) as
if they've never grown tired of their characters, as if they're, well, playing
with toys.  And the new additions to the cast (Joan Cusack as Jessie, Kelsley
Grammer as Prospector, Andrew Stanton as Emperor Zurg) carry on the same
tradition.
Pixar films have always had popular composer Randy Newman score their films,
and Newman returns once again to deliver another excellent score.  His scores
for TOY STORY and A BUG'S LIFE were experimental since he hadn't, back then,
done any music for any animated film, traditional cel, or computer rendered. 
The score for TOY STORY 2 is his crowning achievement in these kind of scores,
with a lot of really exciting, funny, and altogether enjoyable passages.  He
also provides the songs for the film.  TOY STORY 2, like Pixar's other films,
are not musicals, even though they do have `songs'.  Singing here on the
soundtrack is not Newman himself at all (One of my only gripes about the film;
what is wrong with Newman singing?  I think he's a terrific singer, and my
family thinks so, too.) but Sarah McLachlan, who helps a weakly composed but
effectively written number, `When She Loved Me', Riders in the Sky, who
contribute to an ingeniously created theme for WOODY'S ROUNDUP, and Robert
Goulet, who contributes to a jazzed up arrangement of `You've Got A Friend In
Me' (One of the finest songs Newman has ever written).
If there was anything that I could complain about the film (aside from Newman
not singing), it probably would be the Prospector.  I mentioned before that
he's actually Stinky Pete, right?  Not that I intend to give away any
surprises, but later on, he turns out to be, well, a real Stinker.  It seems
somewhat curious that Pixar decided to turn who appears to be one of the nicest
characters in the film into a baddie at the end.  But then, how did the
television set in Al's office come on when Woody attempted to retrieve his arm?
 Well, on the other hand, sometimes a real villain can be a person who acts as
a friend, but turns out to be far from it in the end.  Rather interesting.
Such criticisms, however, do not at all take away from my recommendation of
TOY STORY 2.  I recommend it very highly (as you can judge from my rating),
since it is so much fun to watch from start to finish.
Footnote:  There are a couple of inside references from A BUG'S LIFE in the
form of action figures and familiar images.  Be sure to keep an eye out for
them.
