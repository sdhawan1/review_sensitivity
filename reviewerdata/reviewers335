Title
Review for Deep Rising (1998)
Cast: Treat Williams, Famke Janssen, Wes Studi, Kevin J. O'Connor,
Anthony Heald
Director: Stephen Sommers
Producers: John Baldecchi, Laurence Mark
Screenplay: Stephen Sommers
Whilst sitting through DEEP RISING, I began to wonder why I was feeling
so very comfortable on my cinema seat? Shouldn't I be on the edge,
feeling terrified or at least thrilled at the notion of a sea monster
devouring a ship full of passengers?
Then I realised that everyone in this nobody' cast, was trying to be
either too smug or funny for my liking. Even in death, they seemed at
ease. Hardly, befitting men about to become monster chomp for members of
the squid family! Once this path is travelled, it is hard to recapture
the apical beat of growing suspense ie ALIENS, with too many lapses in
concentration to be able to sustain this thriller.
The passengers disappear before the terrorists board the ship. The
monster then decides to play peek-a-boo' for a while, before
conveniently sucking the juices out of the baddies, leaving most of the
good guys intact. Full marks for an interesting computer generated
tentacle, but rather too reminiscent of the man eating plants from the
musical comedy, THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS. After this comparison how
can one take these tentacle-like-creatures seriously? So I just waited
out the end of this formulaic movie, with a regular pulse rate of sixty,
three yawns and a toilet break.
It is likely that the special effects department devoured a large chunk
of the budget, so it is not surprising that a relatively unknown cast
was hired. Then again, nobody famous would have signed on anyway. So the
solution to the problem, was simply to employ a Mel Gibson look-alike,
Indiana Jones wannabe hero (Trent Williams), and a Julia Roberts
identical (Famke Janssen). Both of whom, are overly cute with their
performance, and it is quite evident from their perky behaviour, that
they will not end up in the monster's belly.
An overly disappointing effort overall.

Title
Review for Bed of Roses (1996)
Cast: Mary Stuart Masterson, Christian Slater, Pamela Segall, Josh
Brolin, Brian Tarantina, Ally Walker Director: Michael Goldenberg
Screenplay: Michael Goldenberg
"Once upon a time there was a little girl of no consequence. Left alone,
deserted by her own blood's relation. Abandoned on the doorsteps of
providence, not knowing even when her true date of birth. No past, no
memories except for sorrowful woes. Can I be loved for who I am, she
asks herself? Will I ever find true love? Through darkened streets walks
a boy lost in his deepest thoughts. Looks up to see a single lightened
room, and to his amazement finds a weeping child, the lost girl of his
dreams. So come with me the boy asks the girl, and I'll show you a place
where sorrows never grow. Come with me to my hiding place, to the secret
garden of my love."
      From the 'Grimmish Book of Fairytales' by T.M.T. Voon
As modern Fairy-tales go this is pleasantly enchanting. Simple in it's
storytelling it doesn't attempt to drown it's audience with unnecessary
melodrama. Not pretentious in it's presentation, it uses its characters
wisely to tell a simple tale of love.
So if it's a Valentine, birthday, or anniversary gift you seek, remember
that wise old saying that 'Flowers speak the universal language of
love'.

Title
Review for Deep End of the Ocean, The (1999)
Director: Ulu Grosbard
Writer: Stephen Schiff, book by Jacquelyn Mitchard
Cast: Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Jonathan Jackson, John Kapelos,
Ryan Merriman, Whoopi Goldberg
It is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has
not experienced the heartache of losing a child  whether that may be in
life or in death. After having said that, I will also say that this
movie does all of the above very well. One gets that choking sensation
in the throat (because of grief) when one brother forgives another for a
costly mistake, or when a husband hugs his wife after a long
estrangement.
There is no ocean, no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of
yet another Ordinary People'. In fact the only thing remotely connected
to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing (not that
this literally happened in the movie). So what are the lessons learnt:
1. Don't take your children to class reunions.
2. Don't leave them alone in the lobby, not even for a second.
Michelle Pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and
mother, a trend that started with A Thousand Acres' and One Fine Day'.
My comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie, so
much so that when she has a nervous break down, the veins on her temples
bulge impressively. Whoopi Golberg also puts in an understated
performance, playing a lesbian cop, with a name that makes one want to
reach for a lollipop. Lastly, who are the ideal companions for this sort
of movie  my grandmother comes to mind.

Title
Review for Good Will Hunting (1997)
Cast: Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Stellan Skarsgard, Minnie
Driver, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser
Director: Gus Van Sant
Producer: Lawrence Bender
Screenplay: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
Although this movie is not the over the top, sensational, earth
shattering experience that I had expected it to be; it is so well
written and acted that one cannot criticise it for its otherwise minute
flaws.
Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is the man that all mediocre folk carrying
mundane jobs in order to maintain their otherwise ordinary lives wish to
be. He has the gift of superior intelligence (a modern day Einstein) but
works at a construction site, has multiple problems with the law and
does not have aspirations to be greater. Now that's gratitude for you!
Discovered by a Professor of Mathematics (Stellan Skarsgard), just
before being imprisoned for aggravated assault, Will Hunting must attend
several psychological counselling sessions a week with a community
psychologist (Robin Williams).
>From this basic story line the audience is lead through a journey of
events that must occur to improve Will Hunting's disposition. If the
movie had ended on a bad note, like that of a genius throwing his life
away, it would not be getting the good press it's receiving today. So
the focus rests on Will Hunting, not just his intelligence, but rather
the emotional turmoil of this extraordinary young man. In the same vein
as FORREST GUMP, WILL HUNTING carries the message that intelligence does
not make the better person. Great care is taken in discussing the issues
dealing with physical abuse, broken homes and self blame. Before finally
bringing about the predictable cathartic moment when self defence
mechanisms collapse like the Walls of Jericho. Include in this journey
an understanding, sympathetic girlfriend (Minnie Driver) who he
initially tries to push away. Then add timely confronting questions from
a genuinely interested therapist, who reinforces the technique with
fatherly affirmation and you have discovered the method used to rescue
Will Hunting from himself.
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are the new kids on the block and this movie
is a major cornerstone in their budding careers. Be prepared to expect
much more from them in the future. Robin William's well controlled
interpretation of a psychological therapist is rightly up for Oscar
contention; as is Minnie Driver who is unlikely to win in her category.
Gus Van Sant will be overlooked in favour of the Cameron team, as shall
all other major contenders for Best Picture. Be overwhelmed by the
Titanic certainty on Oscar night. This movie will however receive best
original screenplay if that is any consolation.

Title
Review for Feeling Minnesota (1996)
Cast: Keanu Reeves, Vince D'Onofrio, Cameron Diaz, Dan Aykroyd, Delroy
Lindo, Tuesday Weld, Michael Rispoli, Courtney Love Director: Steven
Baigleman Screenplay: Steven Baigleman
I'm trying to think of a saving, good point to make about this movie,
but unfortunately I can't. Keanu Reeves choice of movies seems to be
getting from bad to worse.
Think of all the bad things in life like petrol station hold ups,
murdering family members, blackmail, corrupt police, and dysfunctional
relationships - this is the ugly feeling that 'Feeling Minnesota' leaves
you with.
The older brother (D'Onofrio) forces a young girl to marry him. The
younger brother (Reeves) arrives on the wedding day, sleeps with his
newly-wed sister-in-law (Diaz) and runs away with her. She instigates
the younger brother to steal from the older brother, who then shoots her
in a jealous rage. She survives, sleeps with the corrupt policeman
(Ackroyd) investigating the crime, before escaping to Las Vegas with the
money.
Some people will say, well that's life. Sure, but it's also meant to be
a movie, and it's not even entertaining.
Comment: This movie only serves to give Minnesota a bad name.

Title
Review for Anastasia (1997)
Featuring the voices of: Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Angela
Lansbury, Christopher Lloyd, Hank Azaria, Bernadette Peters, Kirsten
Dunst
Directors:  Don Bluth, Gary Goldman
Producers: Don Bluth and Gary Goldman
Screenplay: Susan Gauthier & Bruce Graham, Bob Tzudiker & Noni White
Music: David Newman, Stephen Flaherty
Lyrics: Lynn Ahrens
Who would have thought that Fox would have chosen a subject as
controversial as the dead Romanovs, to be the topic of their first
animated musical. But I guess if Disney got away with cashing in on a
little Indian Princess who dies of small pox in reality, then the issues
surrounding Anastasia Romanov, the surviving heiress of the great Czars
of Russia, is as much up for grabs as any other little princess.
I wasn't expecting much, but look it's got Meg Ryans voice and
mannerisms tied into the character of Anya  and anything with Meg Ryan
can't be bad. Importantly, the music is lively - if not as memorable as
the Disney greats, certainly much better than the recent Herculean Epic
of recent past year. Engaging us with the mysteries of whether this girl
is truly the last surviving Russian princess, we are swept off our feet
with Anastasia in her discovery of not only her heritage but also of
herself. Making a viable romantic interest and bantering partner is John
Cusack, as Dimitri, the kitchen-boy-turned-con-man. Other notable notes
are Rasputin (John Lloyd), a Russian mystical figure who places a curse
on the Romanov's. In reality very little is known about him, as much so
as the missing grand duchess.
So don't expect a historical lesson from this version of Anastasia, but
expect instead to be moderately entertained by flighty tunes that linger
in your mind as you stroll through the park on a winter's morn. The kids
will enjoy much of the commotion, the girls because the heroine is a
girl, and the boys may even take a liking to the evil Rasputin  but to
tell you frankly, the scenes in Hell, scarred the hell out of me.
Overall, good family entertainment.

Title
Review for Lethal Weapon 4 (1998)
Director: Richard Donner
Writer: Channing Gibson, story by Jonathan Lemkin
Cast: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, Chris Rock, Jet
Li
It's difficult to express my disappointment at seeing an unsatisfying
conclusion, to what would otherwise be considered a well made trilogy.
The spark has just left Lethal Weapon 4, as surely as the lights dim
before it's opening.
There are certain annoying tendencies that have cropped up in this
movie, which was not obvious in its predecessors. It has to do with age
and maturity, and unfortunately both Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are
getting too old to be still yelling and screaming like kids. In fact the
majority of their dialogue is so anxious, frenzied and manic  you
probably won't understand what they're shouting about! Add Joe Peschi to
the screeching and the noise has just become deafening. Not so funny
anymore, poor Peschi gets the brunt of most of the childish antics of
the two most immature Captains on the police force. Add Chris Rock to
the trio and well, we have an avalanche of hyperactivity and mayhem.
Rock tries to out-talk Peschi at every turn and Peschi responds by
yelling louder. In fact all sanity is loss from the word go as the movie
plummets into tedious routines of smart-arse cops trying to outdo each
other.
Fortunately, Renne Russo isn't as manic as the others and retains the
sanity and sanctity of a pregnant woman. The other commendable character
is Jet Li - the martial arts world wonder boy, who doesn't have to shout
to be heard. His stoic looks and staunch Mandarin dialogue, captures
more meaning and heart than the combined clown fest of Gibson, Peschi,
Rock and Glover put together. Not to mention the fact that Li could
probably have kicked their butts majorly bad in a fair fight, but
because he's the villain, ends up dead.
This was one movie where, I wanted the bad guy Li to win and give all
four clowns a good thumping for making too much noise. The stunts are
pretty average for this sort of action thriller  there are no
meteorites, tidal waves or giant monsters stomping through the streets
of this movie. Very disappointing overall, for what was otherwise an
intelligent, witty action duo.

Title
Review for Metro (1997)
It's not about planes, trains or automobiles. The closest thing that
this movie gets to metropolitan is several bank robberies. Why confuse
the issues with a name that plays no relevance to the movie at all? Why
not simply call the movie "Hostage", or the "The Rescue Techniques of a
Personnel Endangerment Officer"? Wait, we are forgetting a vital element
in this small picture - Eddie Murphy.
Yes. This once simple movie has just taken a U-turn into the
schizophrenic wards. However, I am happy to report that Mr Murphy has
not forgotten to take his medication, and carries himself throughout
this movie with dignified self-control. I haven't seen him this well
behaved, since his role as Sherman Klump. Then again he was overweight
in that role, and that can have a sobering effect.
The plot is none too complicated. A gunman holds a person hostage. The
idea is to rescue everybody without being shot. Eddie Murphy goes about
doing this his personal way. Which in no uncertain terms mean confusing
the hell out of the kidnapper, then shooting him in the shoulder. Now
tell me, where can I find an enlightening chapter on this technique in
the "Police Rescue Operator's Manual"? Let's not be overly sceptical, I
can see some logic in all of this. After all if Eddie can perplex an
entire audience, he should have no problems bewildering the likes of a
low IQ, psychopathic bank robber with an antisocial personality.
The mass confusion rescue technique only works with the dumb criminals.
The smart ones who graduated with honours in English, Geometry and
Personal Grudges, are more likely send a relative to kill your
girlfriend. If this fails, they'll come after you personally. This movie
has its moments in holding the audience in mild suspense, but these
scenes come too far and few in between. Ed is digging a shallow grave
with this movie, if he's looking for a more abundant resting hole, he
may need to look further abroad than the already corpse littered grounds
of Metropolitan.

Title
Review for Edge, The (1997)
Cast:  Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin, Harold Perrineau, Elle Macpherson.
Screenplay:  David Mamet. Director:  Lee Tamahori.
How many billionaires (Anthony Hopkins) in their late fifties are well read
and able to survive the winter wild and man-eating bears? Not many, but
let's put aside unlikelihoods to focus on what this movie has to offer. It
teaches us not to put our trust in young, pretty wives who are super models
(Elle Mcpherson) or to rely too heavily on their photographers (Alec
Baldwin). When your death is everybody else's gain, nobody can be trusted
and the cliché term poor little rich billionaire comes to mind.
This movie should just focus on men pooling their resources together to
survive the wilderness, leaving out the melodramatics of attempted murder
and betrayal. The plot is initially engrossing, but becomes hard to swallow
when one man becomes an excessively, forgiving hero and the other a literal
dying swan. Find me a humane billionaire and I'll gladly donate five dollars
to the Mother Theresa Foundation, find me one who doesn't have a lawyer as a
best friend' and I'll donate ten. One would have thought that life
threatening experiences such as a bear hunt would create sufficient male
bonding to resolve most differences, but apparently not so. If Helen was
enough to cause the fall of Troy and Eve the fall of man, then perhaps Elle
is sufficient to make a man think with his dick instead of his head.
By far the best actor is the bear. These big, mangy beasts are too often
disguised as soft cuddly toys which children take to sleep. This is most
uncharacteristic of them (soft, cuddly) and the question of beds should
never have arisen with Goldilocks in their jaws. Anyone who tells their
child otherwise is being dishonest. It is this fascinating creature that
makes this story exciting. The rest of the cast is merely supportive.
Anthony Hopkins skilfully portrays an intellectual, resourceful billionaire
who is unusually compassionate, and Alec Baldwin injects hilarity into the
situation when he starts crying; but this is truly the tale of the big, bad
bear.

Title
Review for You've Got Mail (1998)
Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Dave
Chappelle, Jean Stapleton, Steve Zahn, Dabney Coleman.
Screenplay: Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron.
Producers: Lauren Shuler Donner and Nora Ephron.
Director: Nora Ephron.
    In the romantic, feel-good comedy of the year we once again have the
successful pairing of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. This movie belongs to
Ryan, who is at her best - you won't see her smile or gesture more,
carrying with her an innate radiance that simply lights up the screen.
She has truly reached her prime, a remarkable, natural comedienne of our
time, who carries a unique, magical quality that will be remembered many
years from now. With Nora and Delia Ephron combining to write a
post-modern, romantic comedy that is well written, humorous and above
all intelligent, this story will bring cheer to everyone during the
holiday season.
     The story is about love on the Internet and love in real life. Ryan
and Hank's characters are soul mates by Net (known only to each other by
the pseudonyms Shopgirl' and NY152') and fierce competitors by day.
The dilemma lies in the fact that they despise each other in real life 
Hank's owns a megasize, chain of bookstores that is killing Ryan's
self-run, children's bookstore. The question posed to the viewer is
whether you can end up loving someone that you started out hating. With
frequent references to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the answer is
yes  the prejudiced Ms Bennet, does end up falling for the proud Mr
Darcy. But the answer is not so simple in this movie  not only do we
have computers, cyber-relationships and books to complicate the matter,
it is the fine tuning of wit, humour and circumstance, intricately
crafted by two sisters, that brings this difficult situation to a
believable, well-timed, lyrical ending.

Title
Review for Deep Impact (1998)
Cast: Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Vanessa Redgrave,
Maximilian Schell, Morgan Freeman, Leelee Sobieski, James Cromwell
Director: Mimi Leder
Producers: David Brown, Richard D. Zanuck
Screenplay: Michael Tolkin, Bruce Joel Rubin
If ever there was ever a disaster movie that focussed more on the
emotional issues of love and sacrifice, than the actual special effects
of destroying earth, then it will probably be remembered as DEEP IMPACT.
Man is on the verge of extinction as a comet plummets towards earth, and
like the dinosaurs before us, the human race is about to become
fossilised. But unlike the dinosaurs, mankind has a great ability to
innovate. With the combined effort between ex-cold war enemies, the US
and the USSR, a group of astronauts are assembled to blow up the big
rock.
If you were expecting to see large tidal waves, rip-apart famous
American cities, then your wait will be a long one. Much of the movie
focuses on the loneliness of a wannabe famous reporter, with divorced
parents. A great scene where a daughter says to her estranged father,
It was a perfect day', and moments later a large wave thumping them
into oblivion. An emotionally charged scene, where a mother screams to
her daughter escaping on a motorcycle, Take my baby, take my baby!'
This is soon followed by lovers holding each other peacefully, before
being blasted into oblivion by the same large wave. Before finally, the
first Black American President (Morgan Freeman), giving some tear
jerking words post IMPACT, about big waves rolling, cities falling but
mankind living on etc. etc. as if this movie was not emotionally packed
enough already.
The virtually unknown cast, except for some golden oldies (Robert
Duvall, Vanessa Redgrave, Maxcimilian Schell), who give this movie some
credibility and is a great economical plan for the worth-waiting-for
special effects heaped towards the end. Some people will dislike the
attempts at mixing a bowl full of thoughtfulness in with a dish full of
special effects', but it really ain't half bad.

Title
Review for Falling Fire (1997)
Directed by Daniel D'Or
Cast Michael Paré, Heidi von Palleske, Mackenzie Gray, Zerha Leverman,
Cedric Turner, Christian Vidosa
Written by Daniel D'Or, Peter I. Horton, Philip Jackson
There seems to be a revived interest surrounding falling meteorites and
the destruction of our beloved home planet Earth. It has been suggested
that these comets with pretty tails, were most likely caused the
extinction of the dinosaurs not too long ago. In the coming event of
METEOR another big, Hollywood disaster, action flick, there was first
FALLING FIRE, starring Michael Pare - an underrated C Grade action
prince.
This movie begins by explaining how all of earth's natural mineral
resources have been depleted by the demands of overpopulation. The
Earth's solution to this problem is not family planning, but rather
pulling a meteorite out of its trajectory and into earth's orbit for
mining. Anyone in their right minds will now that this is just asking
for unwanted trouble. But alas an intensely dangerous situation must be
created for Pare to display his fighting skills. To be fair, some credit
must be given to Pare for giving his character an element of depth, when
arguing in the problem with wife scene', and for showing some emotion
in the air born sex scene'.
To make the plot more simple than it already is, add a saboteur aboard
the space station, throw in a religious fanatic groups out to destroy
earth, include elements of murder/mystery, with Pare trying to act and
you'll have a unbelievably great time at the C Grade Pics.

Title
Review for G.I. Jane (1997)
Cast: Demi Moore, Viggo Mortensen, Anne Bancroft, Jason Beghe, Lucinda
Jenny, Scott Wilson, David Vadim, Morris Chestnut,
Josh Hopkins Director: Ridley Scott Producers: Ridley Scott, Roger
Birnbaum, Demi Moore, and Suzanne Todd Screenplay: David
Twohy and Danielle Alexandra
Some valid points are made in this movie about the role of women not
just in the defence force, but also in society. Why do some men feel the
need to open a car door for a woman, to pull out a chair for her at the
dining table, or to give up a seat on the bus for a mother? Why is there
an undeniable urge to want to protect the 'weaker' sex? Do they really
need protecting? Somehow the thought of my father and brother tussling
in hand to hand combat on a battlefield puts knots of worry in my
stomach, yet if it were my mother and sister should I be more concerned?
Could these feelings be the result of my over sensitive conditioning by
society?
The Navy SEALs encompasses the toughest training program there is in
defence force of the United States. One woman (Demi Moore) is asked by a
Senator (Anne Bancroft), to undertake the training thus forever changing
the limited role and positions of women in armed combat. Moore is at
first given preferential treatment by the corps, to account for the
gender differences. Namely, steps to help climb a wall, a longer time
limit to complete tasks and separate barracks and showers. Which is not
unreasonable considering women are physiologically smaller, though no
less intelligent than their male counterparts. However, Moore realises
that she needs to go head to head with the males if she is to gain any
respect from them.
The numerous scenes of bone breaking drills are as gruelling on the mind
as on the eye. One begins to huff and puff just watching these men being
pushed to the upper limits of human endurance. The most shocking scene
is during a role played hostage interrogation. When Moore the leader of
her group is battered, bashed and simulated raped in front of her men,
in a attempt to break their code of silence. It is here that the
commanding officer makes a solid statement - "She isn't the problem, we
are." Meaning that the weakness lies not with the mettle of the female
soldier, but in the heart of the male counterpart who cannot endure
watching the torture of the fairer sex.
So perhaps society may need to change it's thinking towards women, and
their right to defend their country in armed combat. However, since
peace is predominant in the majority of the civilised world, there may
not be any need to make a hasty decision about sending women into
battle. In the mean time, I will continue to open car doors, pull out
chairs and sacrifice my seat on a bus for women. I will also go into
battle first before allowing my mother and sister to take up arms.
Hopefully, there will also come a day when there are no battles left to
be fought or won, and the only issue remaining regarding sexual equality
is who should carry the baby.
This Ridley Scott movie is more melodrama than standard war flick,
dealing with gender roles rather than actual combat. Not his best work,
although thought provoking enough to keep the viewer interested. Moore's
testosterone charged male characterisation is amusing. She has
undoubtedly been taking tough guy lessons from husband Bruce.

Review for Harriet the Spy (1996)
Directed by Bronwen Hughes Cast Michelle Trachtenberg Vanessa Lee
Gregory Smith (I) Rosie O'Donnell J. Smith-Cameron Robert Joy (I) Eartha
Kitt Charlotte Sullivan Marion Hawthorne Teisha Kim Written by Louise
Fitzhugh (book) Douglas Petrie (I) Theresa Rebeck
There's something wonderful about childhood which allows us to believe
we are capable of anything. The future shines brightly ahead like the
rising sun in the distant horizon. Life's bitter lessons haven't taught
us to believe otherwise, as we stand invincible on the promising steps
of hopes and dreams. When I was young I believed that I could fly to the
moon and back in my space craft composed of broken down radio and hi-fi
set; that it was indeed the Millenium Falcon, and I was Han Solo
journeying to rescue Princess Leia. I won't tell you what I used for a
substitute light sabre, but that's my private childhood fantasy. For
Harriet M. Welsch it was to become the world's greatest spy. Whatever
she saw, whatever she heard, she wrote down in her very 'private'
notebook. For she aspired to be a great writer, and one has to start
somewhere in life, why not earlier.
So our tale of childhood dreams begins, with a girl sheltered beneath
the loving wings of her nanny Ms Golly (Rosie O'Donnell). Harriet has
been neglectfully ignored by her busy parents, leaving her to seek
thrilling sessions of spying and writing. Wherever she goes she carries
her book, and within it writes the most painful truths about her dearest
friends Sport and Janie, her greatest enemy Marion the class president,
and much, much more. Through a shift of unfortunate circumstance Ms
Golly is called to leave, forcing the young Harriet to spread her tender
wings. With much anticipation and under preparation, the spy is faced
with her first taste of cruelty that lost innocence brings. When Marion
exposes her most private thoughts from that most secret book, Harriet
becomes the object of much despise and ridicule. The once great spy is
flung into lonely solitude of careless abandon.
So for the first time in her young life, Harriet of the sixth grade
faces self doubt and wavering uncertainty. The child who once showed
unwavering confidence, now lies marred and wounded, confused and
vulnerable. With Ms Golly gone, her parents a distant relation, and
excommunicated by her closest friends, Harriet stands alone. Arising
from this adversity, angry and vengeful at first, the spy who would be,
learns to resolve her differences peacefully - to forgive those who have
hurt her most, her parents and best friends. Thus, Harriet the Spy has
learnt her first and most painful lesson in life, what it must be like
to be human.

Review for Entrapment (1999)
Cast: Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames, Will Patton.
Screenplay: Ron Bass and William Broyles.
Producers: Sean Connery, Michael Hertzberg and Rhonda Tollefson.
Director: Jon Amiel.
1. It's all right to date women forty years your junior, as long as it
looks good on screen. Don't ask me how, but Sean Connery, with his
undeniable lasting charm, gets away with a kiss from the lovely
Catherine Zeta Jones and nobody squirmed!
2. The idea of stealing billions from the world exchange bank on top of
the K.L. Twin Towers is a good idea, but I hear that the bank is
actually imaginary. In fact, the world's tallest building now stands
mostly half empty thanks to the recent SE Asia recession.
3. A story about professional thieving is exciting, and there hasn't
been one of this calibre and quality for awhile. My personal favourite
was a Sidney Sheldon mini series If Tomorrow Never Comes.' My only
complaint is that towards the end, the ability of these professional
thieves becomes too magical when they somehow start jumping trains
mid-motion in heels and dress.
4. This movie will be remembered for some very sensual and sensational
body movements from Zeta Jones, as she twists her firm, slim body
through some tight motions when navigating a maze of laser beams. And
WOW, what a body!

Review for Wilde (1997)
Directed by Brian Gilbert Cast Stephen Fry Jude Law Vanessa Redgrave
Jennifer Ehle Gemma Jones Judy Parfitt Michael Sheen Zoë Wanamaker Tom
Wilkinson (I) Written by Richard Ellmann Julian Mitchell
There is so much that can be said about a man who was so talented, that
he almost thought that he could have it all. This great play-write of
the late nineteenth century was undeniably one of the most charming men
to have graced the British Empire with his witty discourse and
intelligent writing. Yet somehow his downfall came not so much because
he was gay, but because he was selfish.
So why hasn't this movie been released in the US yet? Well I hear it has
to do something with the revealing homosexual scenes and the censorship
board. For main stream cinema this is not your average smooch between
Tom Selleck and Kevin Kline from IN AND OUT. These guys, Stephen Fry,
Jude Law etc etc really know how to kiss. I'm talking lips, tongues,
close ups you can tell they're all out, no holding back. This is not
surprising considering Stephen Fry (BLACK ADDER) has had plenty of
practice in real life prior to this excursion into male bonding. Not to
mention the numerous pretty boys' recruited to fill Oscar Wilde's bed
get to cuddle him, sit on top of him, get behind him, play with each
other in front of him. There are no close ups of any erections
travelling the ways of in and out holes, but enough to give a gay man a
hard on throughout the movie  so I hear. This is after all an art house
movie and the director would not in any way want his film mistakenly
labelled as pornographic.
So the main characters are superb in this movie. The very talented
Stephen Fry plays Wilde as naturally as he is gay and portrays the man
with great humanity and dignity. Jude Law's temperamental impersonation
of Bosey' is also memorable, but I fear the pretty lad may end up with
a price tag label wording Hire me if you need a toy boy who isn't
afraid to show butt and kiss arse.' Vanessa Redgrave puts on a very
liberal performance as the unconventional Irish mother who brought the
genius into the world, and also worth mentioning is the darling Jennifer
Ehle from TV's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, as the silent suffering wife.
An end quote from Wilde, One must do as one's nature dictates' is a
seriously flawed argument. He has overlooked factors like responsibility
and sacrifice. There are many things in life that we may want to do, but
we do not carry out these actions because the consequences are too far
reaching for all concerned. This statement is not in reference to being
gay or not being gay, but applies to everyone. Sometimes we must say NO
to the thing our very nature dictates. It has nothing to do with
sexuality, but to do with responsibility. Oscar Wilde had the
responsibility of a father and husband to fulfil. This became an
obligation when he allowed his passions to become unchecked. People will
argue that Bosey destroyed Wilde with his wanton desires, but really the
man was his own undoing when he travelled down the path of pure self
gratification with little thought of whom he hurt in due course. I think
Wilde knew that in the end his nature and poor choices destroyed the
people that mattered most, his wife and children. Perhaps if he were
never married Wilde would not appear the selfish giant he was, but the
martyr he tried to be.

Review for Mirror Has Two Faces, The (1996)
Cast: Barbra Streisand, Jeff Bridges, Lauren Bacall, Pierce Brosnan,
Mimi Rogers, George Segal, Brenda Vaccaro, Austin Pendleton Director:
Barbra Streisand Screenplay: Richard LaGravenese
The mirror has two faces, the reflection that you see, and the person
who you are behind that reflection.
I had a friend who once told me that it was better to be happily single,
than to settle for second best. I couldn't agree more. Don't settle for
second best. To find someone who loves you so much that it aches, well
that's worth waiting for.
This, in part, is one of the many themes in this movie. A single,
middle-aged professor of literature (Streisand), is always the
bridesmaid and never the bride. A single, middle-aged professor of
mathematics (Bridges), has unusual theories about the universe and sex -
that a lasting relationship with a woman, only requires friendship and
common interests. They get married, become best friends, but the
marriage is never consummated. It is then that Streisand's character
realises that she wants more; she wants it all, the flowers, the
romance, the passion and fireworks -- and not second best.
Great subject material for a movie. Well chosen by Streisand, who I am
sure directs from personal experience; and a cast well suited to their
roles.

Title
Review for Rush Hour (1998)
Cast: Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Tom Wilkinson, Elizabeth Pena.
Screenplay: Jim Kouf and Ross LaManna.
Director: Brett Ratner.
In RUSH HOUR, we have one of the oddest pairings of action movie heroes
since Lethal Weapon  - and it works! We have partly to thank Jackie Chan
for his gimic humour and Chris Tucker for being overtly hysterical. The
result is one of balance, when east meets west, in a fast paced, comical
action thriller which has both actors showing off what they are best at.
There have been comments that Jackie's hands and feet aren't as fast as
they used to be  give the man a break  he's forty plus! He may be
slower, but his choreography is also smoother and mature. As for Chris
Tucker, there isn't anyone to out speak him in this movie, which is just
as well, because the last thing you want is another smart mouth adding
to the cacophony of noise. Jackie is polite, sincere and nice, finely
balancing the rude, loud, manic Chris. If there was any other paring
outside these two actors, we may not have the success that is RUSH HOUR.
With a reasonable plot, fast action, humour and above all onscreen
chemistry between two unlikely co-workers  we have an assured hit on
our hands. Just watch out for the sequels in years to come, which is
likely to be far inferior to the parent.

Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
Cast: Liam Neeson; Ewan McGregor; Jake Lloyd; Natalie Portman; Ahmed
Best; Pernilla August; Ian McDiarmid; Ray Park; Samuel L. Jackson;
Oliver Ford Davies; Terence Stamp; Frank Oz; Kenny Baker; Anthony
Daniels
Director: George Lucas
Screenplay: George Lucas
In arguably the most anticipated movie this century, George Lucas has
achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster. Despite the fact
the script and plot is a bit of a let down, the entire movie on the
whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence, in the
sound and special effects department.
In terms of characters, by far the most outstanding and interesting is
Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), whose mature performance far exceeds
her tender 14 years of age. She is one hot' babe who defines true
woman leadership'. She not only has a presence, but knows how to take
command of the situation and save her planet from ruination. No thanks
to the Jedi Knights who although led by the Force, lack leadership
qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything.
The young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) who has a bad hair day in every
scene, gets to kill a bad guy in the end, but lacks a love interest to
make him a desirable sort of hero. In fact all the Jedi Knight are a bit
asexual - there must be something about the Force which makes them all
hermits and loners. I mean it would be interesting to see Yoda's
girlfriend for a change, if he has one. Not much better is Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson) who mostly broods, and has a better hair do than Obi-Wan,
but only to find the young Anakin Skywalker and make the biggest mistake
of his life.
Also fascinating is George Lucas Metoclorian' theory, which claims that
micro-organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the
universe. And it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an
individual which make them particularly powerful in the Force. More
humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of Darth Vader, no
doubt a concept stolen from the Christian faith, except there will be no
Christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the Force.
Overall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact
that it's predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior
successor. By all means not the pinnacle of the Star Wars phenomena but
an adequate addition to the clan. Watch out for the next one, it should
be one steamy encounter between Queen Amidala and Anakin Skywalker - who
I believe should be portrayed by  Leonardo Di Caprio.

Title
Review for Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman (1993) (TV)
When a 50 ft. woman demands sexual attention how can one say no, less
they be trampled on. Daryl Hannah, the timid housewife who becomes ten
storeys high, attempts to mend her marriage with her unfaithful husband
(Daniel Baldwin) with the sexual proposal of the decade. She asks him to
think of the immeasurable possibilities of making love to a 50 ft.
woman. To imagine the new horizons unexplored by mankind; that he would
be the envy of every man.
And I have decided that sex with a 50 ft. woman is a territory that is
best left uncharted. I have no sympathy for the unfaithful, sleazy
husband, but he is totally correct in freaking out. He yells, "What do
you expect me to do. Wear a rubber suit?". He doesn't mean a condom
either.
This movie empowers the psychologically abused, sexually deprived
housewife by making her grow to a size where argument with her is
futile. It would have been more rewarding to see this frightened, mousy
creature overcome her fears and problems as herself, and not as a
towering giant. We must realise that growing bigger doesn't necessarily
make our problems any smaller.
So we watch the fragile Daryl Hannah grow into a giant after being
zapped by an alien craft. Within minutes her clothes rip as the muscles
bulge, but somehow the bra seems to stay on. Now how did that happen?
After a domestic quarrel over sex, she is chased into the desert by the
US airforce. The helicopters are in much need of target practice, after
shooting a hundred missiles before one finally finds its mark. The giant
on the other hand has great difficulty swatting the flying machines,
which are small enough to rest in the palm of her hand.
The ending is pure feminist propaganda. The male chauvinistic pig is
made to spend an eternity caged, under the watchful eye of his giant
wife. She dictates the marriage now, and sex is no longer out of the
question.

Review for Man in the Iron Mask, The (1998)
Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gerard
Depardieu,  Gabriel Byrne, Anne Parillaud, Judith Godreche, Peter
Sarsgaard, Hugh Laurie
Director: Randall Wallace
Producers: Randall Wallace and Russ Smith
Screenplay:  Randall Wallace based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas
Hollywood has an annoying tendency to transform great classical pieces
of literature into whatever they fancy. If these changes were any good
then perhaps one can say  oh, that was neat; but when they are sloppily
done, one can only grit their teeth, rip at the seating material with
their finger nails and wait for the movie's end.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is by no means a faithful adaptation of the
Alexandre Dumas novel on which it is based. The question is did screen
writer/director newbie Randall Wallace even try to be loyal?
So let's forget about the story for the moment, and focus on the young
star of the moment, Leonardo Di Caprio. Hot off the heels of TITANIC,
this movie vehicle merely cashes in on the enormous popularity generated
from the aforementioned. His performance here merely ranges from pure
pouty (Evil King Louis) to pure innocence (Good Prince Phillipe) with
little in between, so much for dramatic range! He was by far better in
Titanic. Then there are the veterans of stage and screen. Jeremy Irons
(Aramis), very much reprises his priestly persona that worked
brilliantly in THE MISSION. I still can't get over John Malkovich's
awkward American accent as Athos. Fortunately, there is no such
discrepancy between speech and character with Gerard Depardieu. His role
as Porthos, farts and all, is the comic relief in this sullen movie.
Gabriel Byrne an ever reliable actor is the loyal, faithful D'Artagnan
who carries a mysterious secret with him.
Overall, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is mildly entertaining, but not a good
movie by any standard. There are some memorable scenes like Leo Di
Caprio looking his prettiest whilst moon gazing, a damsel in distress
who leaps to her death for selling herself cheap. And when the Four
Muskateers dressed in elegant garb, brandishing swords and fencing side
by side, yell slogans like All for One and One for All'  touching but
hardly the grand Dumas epic it should have been.

Title
Review for Aurora: Operation Intercept (1995)
Directed by Paul Levine
Cast Bruce Payne (I), Natasha Andreichenko, Lance Henriksen, John
Stockwell, Michael Champion, Dennis Christopher, Corbin Bernsen
Written by Paul Levine
This movie should have been wrapped up in fifteen minutes, thus saving
viewers form witnessing a shameful mockery of their intelligence.
Captain Pruett (Payne) is a pilot of one of the U.S. top secret air
craft code named Aurora'. He is ordered to destroy a terrorist base in
the middle-east, which contains a device which is able to scramble the
flight controls of any domestic or military plane. The terrorists are
threatening to down a domestic plane every four hours, unless their
demands are met. He disobeys his orders because another U.S. pilot is
currently held hostage in the base.
I could not understand how the military could have allowed a man as
indecisive and subversive as Pruett, to fly one of their most deadly
planes. I can understand his dilemma of saving the life of one man,
whilst risking the lives of thousands; but from what I understand of the
military, obeying orders comes before one's personal feelings.
His disobedience results in his capture; the deaths of two pilots,
including the man whom he risked his mission for; the endangered lives
of those on domestic flights, and the use of his captured plane by the
terrorists to blow up the White House.
Woe to this man, if only he had obeyed his orders. Although he rectifies
his error, his careless disobedience goes unpunished.
The writer and director Levine, really needs to rethink where this plot
is coming from. The audience will not simply accept this movie on the
basis of some impressive plane dog fights.
Comment: Painfully stupid and unsatisfying.

Title
Review for Species II (1998)
Cast: Michael Madsen, Natasha Henstridge, Marg Helgenberger, Justin
Lazard, Mykelti Williamson, George Dzundza, James Cromwell
Director: Peter Medak
Producer: Frank Mancuso Jr.
Screenplay: Chris Brancato
A movie could not suffer more, than if it loses all self-restraint in
its direction. As in the case of the overly indulgent, blood and guts'
SPECIES 2, all traces of sanity is lost somewhere in the morbid plot. It
seems that whoever wrote the script, became fixated with the idea that
aliens bursting from the bellies of pregnant women, was a hot topic that
would capture the public's interest. Almost every fifteen minutes, there
is a scene filled with lurid sex and copulation, soon followed by
gestation and ruptured wombs. If ever there were a movie that degrades
the value of motherhood, it would be this movie. Having said that, I
also felt violated after being pounded with sickening images.
The stars of this movie have been hired for no other purpose than body
material, to be manipulated for alien purposes. Michael Madsen is hired
because of his pretty face and no doubt for his body, which is entirely
wasted on sex scenes. Just as Natasha Henstridge was wasted in the first
movie for luring men to their deaths. As for the heroes', they're
basically goofy and unintelligent, and overweight ie George Dzundza.
As for killing the alien being, it comes as silly as stabbing somebody's
leg with sickle cell anaemia and throwing it at the alien and say die. I
actually enjoyed SPECIES, but with SPECIES 2, the makers have
unfortunately lost control of boundaries and ventured into a place where
nobody wants to go. Excessive sex, excessive violence and excessive in
every way and in need of a good mental and psychological re-workup if
ever there were to be a SPECIES 3.

Title
Review for Godzilla (1998)
Cast: Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria, Maria Pitillo, Kevin
Dunn, Michael Lerner, Harry Shearer, Arabella Field
Director: Roland Emmerich
Producers: Dean Devlin
Screenplay: Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich
The thing that struck me most about this big monster movie was that it
was thoroughly enjoyable  much more so than JURASSIC PARK or THE LOST
WORLD, which I believe took itself much too seriously. With Godzilla,
the experience was different, not merely special effects  okay a lot of
it was special effects somehow this monster is more intelligent and
interesting than a silly T-Rex running through the streets, not to
mention bigger in size.
There isn't a moment of boredom or tedium, with ongoing action and
dialogue to keep the viewer hyper-stimulated throughout the entire movie
experience. I can still hear the thumping of GODZILLA's big webbed feet
ringing in my ears, the whale-like-moan he makes before appearing, the
rattle of machine guns bouncing off concrete, the swish of flying
missiles flying through the air, the burr of helicopter propellers with
overheated engines, the screech of tyres skidding across the wet
landscape, the screams of numerous pedestrians trodden to death, the
shrillness of glass shattering as GODZILLA strolls past central park.
There is a plot, a reasonable one, although very much over the top
fantastic. Godzilla the giant aberrant mutation, is the result of
nuclear experimentation and so indirectly man made. He's the guy you've
come to see, and so overshadows the otherwise extremely well chosen
cast. Matthew Broderick as the weedy, geeky scientist, Jean Reno is
wonderfully humorous as the French secret agent, Hank Azaria is
colourful as a very American-Italian cameraman. But let's face it you
came to see the big guy have it out with the US airforce, navy and army
and what a wonderful spectacle it is. So just sit back and enjoy the
commotion.

Title
Review for Vampires (1998)
Cast: James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith, Tim
Guinee, Maximilian Schell.
Screenplay: Don Jakoby, based on the novel Vampire by John Steakley.
Director: John Carpenter.
Vampire's is a rude, chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as
pawns of abuse, present only to pleasure men, feed vampires, readied to
be bashed or beaten - till one's sensibilities is shocked by the low IQ
and mentality of this regressive movie. To make matters worse, the
buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks, and deserve to have
their heads bitten off, if not, their bodies carved in half. The dilemma
of hating the heroes' as much as the villains', makes one wish that
the Hand of God' would suddenly appear and blast both parties into
oblivion. James Wood portrays Jack Crow, a man obsessed with killing
vampires, whose soul reason for living is based on revenge (they killed
his parents), but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious
than the vampires. As for Adam Baldwin, he is nothing more than a stooge
who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts action', and the
script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the
female sex. As for the claims that the Catholic Church created
Dracula', well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion, outside
the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury, with
enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame. An awful movie on
all counts, my suggestion is to bring back Buffy and bury this group of
incompetent, rude vampire slayers.

Title
Review for Bean (1997)
Cast : Rowan Atkinson - Mr. Bean,  Larry Drake, Johnny Galecki,
Richard Gant, Andy Lawrence, Peter MacNicol, Sandra Oh, Pamela Reed,
Tricia Vessey, Harris Yulin. Directed by Mel Smith. Written by Richard
Curtis (I), Robin Driscol.
Bean fans, he's here! Billed as the 'Ultimate Disaster Movie', when in
truth this is the 'Pen-Ultimate Disaster Movie.' Move over Twister,
Volcano and up-coming Titanic, make-way for Bean - the man who can
generate laughs with the cataclysmic propensity of Hiroshima.
Yes, it was funny. Watch out U.S.A. here comes the infestation known
as Bean. He's ugly and mean, pays little respect to customs, or
hygiene. Beware this lean, mean, fighting machine known as Bean,
coming your way October.
Watch the Bean reduce a 50 million painting of The Whistler's Mother'
into a caricature of 'Hagar', and hear his insightful thoughts on the
painting after. He makes Tom Cruise look like an amateur, when it
comes to a 'Mission Impossible' break-in, with only the use of a skate
board, laxatives, eggs and underwear. Witness the life-saving
techniques of Bean as he removes bullets from downed cops, and the
'Bean-Defibrillator Method' of arousing coma victims; and at the end
of the day watch him warm the hearts of his audience, as he brings a
broken family together again.
Comment: Bean is his name. Disaster is his game. Hear him roar!

Title
Review for Six Days Seven Nights (1998)
Cast: Harrison Ford, Anne Heche, David Schwimmer, Jacqueline Obradors,
Temuera Morrison
Directors: Ivan Reitman
Producers: Ivan Reitman, Roger Birnbaum, Wallis Nicita
Screenplay: Michael Browning
Harrison Ford is getting to the age where playing a male lead, requires
more than just a set of good looks. The perpetually likeable Ford, has
charisma, charm and likeability that will tie him over into the next
century. Playing something reminiscent of the late Cary Grant in FATHER
GOOSE, Ford is a bit of a scruffy, drinking pilot that crashes his plane
on a deserted island, with a perky Anne Heche, fashion magazine editor
on board.
So this story has a Robinson Crusoe feel about it and the first half the
movie is about survival and mostly comic, because of a good series of
one liners between the Heche and Ford. Unfortunately, the final half
falls into a rather round-the-mill, die hard' action flick once the
pirates arrive on the scene. The idea of Anne Heche, being Ford's girl
Friday is quite entertaining, but is she really the right choice for a
good romantic lead? There is some chemistry between Heche and Ford, but
it really should have stayed more on an intellectual level, than a
physical one. The passion aspect of their relationship is as solid as a
half-boiled egg.
David Schwimmer doing his usual rah, rah', I'm such a jerk' persona,
is perfect for his role as the weak-spirited fiancée of the Heche
character. So tt's not surprising that she chooses Ford over him.
Although, no aspect of this movie is exceptional, overall it is well
written and directed and more enjoyable than one would expect. After
all, it is a product of Ivan Reitman and any admirers of his work should
expect a comic side to this movie.

Title
Review for Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)
Starring: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton,
Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, F. Murray Abraham.
Screenplay: Michael Piller.
Director: Jonathan Frakes.
There are those of you who will whinge about the fact that INSURRECTION,
is just as ordinary as another episode of the successful STTNG
franchise. There will be unfair comparisons made to the previous, likely
to be more successful, well made, FIRST CONTACT. All of the above may be
true, but this is still an enjoyable movie to watch. Then there are
those who will complain about the lack of action or special effects. My
reply would be, if you want to see special effects visit George Lucas,
if you want something more thoughtful and evenly paced, watch STTNG. It
is true that the tension is not as great as in FIRST CONTACT, but hey,
you can't have a Borg in every movie, and the lack of cliff hanger
action is well compensated by light humour and character developments.
The dependable cast is a joy to watch although visibly older -
especially Counsellor Troi, but appearances are secondary - it's the
characters we've come to watch. This movie is a team effort, with an
almost even focus on each member of the original cast, unlike FIRST
CONTACT, which belonged to Picard. Despite much criticism from others,
this is still a fine movie in the vein of what we have come to love and
enjoy about the hearty crew of the USS ENTERPRISE.

Title
Review for Prince of Egypt, The (1998)
Voices: Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock,
Jeff Goldblum, Patrick Stewart, Steve Martin, Martin Short.
Screenplay: Philip LaZebnik.
Directors: Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells
    A dramatic, full motion, animation epic is always a bit risky, and
will bring, a couple of sniggers from the mouth's of audiences who are
unaccustomed to the likes. So it is not surprising that The Prince of
Egypt, runs a difficult and lonely race against the dominating likes of
cute Disney animation flicks. But the fact it dares to be different pays
off, and those familiar with the story of Moses and the word Exodus,
will not be alienated by the plot, because it does not stray very far
from what is actually recorded in the Bible.
      There are odd moments of humour thrown in amidst the drama, but
these are so off beat that one is unsure whether to laugh or not. An
example is Moses post-sandstorm - a scene more reminiscent of a
Roadrunner cartoon. Besides these slight hiccups, the heavy score
composed by Hans Zimmer and Stephen Shwartz is well suited to the grand
scale of the story. And the special effects are bigger, better and
badder than the Cecil B. DeMille version of the same story, The Ten
Commandments. Of particular note are the burning bush and the parting of
the Red Sea. In fact, the parting of the sea, can be more accurately
described as the parting of an ocean  take my word, there's a lot of
water!
     As for the cast, Ralph Fiennes' wonderful accent lends Pharoah a
kind of British air that would have been missing from the original, but
is otherwise in character. Val Kilmer loans more of a humble tone to the
modest, troubled Moses. Michelle Pfeiffer sings well as Tzipporah, watch
for her part in the movie, which is sung by Mariah Carey in the hit
single We Believe. You will also recognise many other famous names in
the other lead roles, but in particular Steve Martin and Martin Short
lend their talents to one of the few, in synch, humorous parts of the
movie as the high priests, Hotep and Huy. Overall this is an immense
achievement from Dreamworks who have worked hard to develop an animation
epic that is worth watching.

Review for Nightwatch (1998)
Cast: Ewan McGregor, Patricia Arquette, Josh Brolin, Nick Nolte, Lauren
Graham, Brad Dourif, John C. Reilly, Alix Koromzay
Director: Ole Bornedal
Producer: Michael Obel
Screenplay: Ole Bornedal and Steven Soderbergh based on Bornedal's
NATTEVAGTEN
>From the opening bloodletting scene, to the moment I walked out
(something I've never done before), there was a lingering feeling of
nausea - brought on by the sickening nature of this sordid movie. The
feel of dead bodies, morgues, necrophilia and lingering smell of
formalin-pickled anatomy parts, left a bitter taste - not your average
cup of tea. I hated anatomy and medical school left me with bad memories
of a stale, dark museum  resulting in a low tolerance for this sort of
movie. Feeling run down from a hard days work (equals - not in mood for
psychopathic killer on mad sexual rampage, killing prostitutes), was
probably another reason why I left early.
I laughed at KISS THE GIRLS, I shrugged my shoulders with indifference
to I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and ignored most of the
grotesqueness of the SCREAMS, but I could not tolerate NIGHT WATCH. It
crossed that unseen barrier of acceptability. There were two others who
made an earlier departure than I, so clearly I was not alone in how I
felt.
>From what I did watch (about half the movie), the story revolves around
a night watch man (Ewan McGregor) who works part time at a morgue, in
order to supplement his income whilst studying. His best friend (Josh
Brolin) starts to show psychopathic tendencies early on. He keeps going
on about reaching highs'  and I don't mean drugs. Sex doesn't do it
for him', neither do prostitutes, he is unexcited with fighting, leaving
him with a void that needs to be filled. When he asks his best friend
(McGregor) to sleep with his girlfriend, so he can get turned on 
warning bells startedto ring. In this trend, it is hinted that the
psychotic bastard only gets a rush when he's murdering prostitutes. One
can only imagine what he does with the body after! This movie is like
Jeffrey Dharma revisited and is best avoided all together. It exploits
the darker side of human nature, a territory that is best left in the
unexplored realm of hell.
The only regrets I have is, watching talents like Patricia Arquette and
Ewan McGregor wasted on such poor material. After, A LIFE LESS ORDINARY,
Ewan McGregor has only himself to blame for choosing bad roles.
Hopefully, his upcoming performance as the young Obe-Wan Kenobe, in
George Lucas' STAR WARS pre-quels will be a redeeming feature - May the
force be with you Ewan.'

Title
Review for City of Angels (1998)
Cast: Nicolas Cage, Meg Ryan, Denis Franz, Andre Braugher, Colm Feore
Director: Brad Silberling
Producers: Dawn Steel, Charles Roven
Screenplay: Dana Stevens based on WINGS OF DESIRE
In the midst of a city filled with the bustle of impatient drivers and
the hustle of frantic pedestrians, there exist angels that watch over
mankind with the utmost patience and care. They are there to greet you
at birth and to comfort you in death. They are well read and well versed
in every language. After all, they have existed for an eternity and
seemingly have an eternity more to do their heavenly chores.
In one of the most picturesque movies this year, starring Nicholas Cage
as the angel Seth and Meg Ryan as the human Maggie who steals his heart;
comes a bitter-sweet, melancholy story of love  the tragic kind. A love
that is genuinely passionate, but is too easily snatched away by the
cruel hand of fate. Seemingly, we can't help whom we fall in love and
have little control over destiny.
Brad Silberling has filled his picture with memorable scenes of angels
dressed in black suits standing on skyscrapers and beaches, waiting for
the resounding echoes of sunrise and sunset to fill the screen. Angels
can hear the music of light on the horizon, but sadly they have never
experienced the power of human touch. So when Maggie looks into Seth's
eyes, he longs to hold and feel her in his arms. Is Seth willing to give
up his immortality for Maggie, and is she going to fall in love with a
stranger who always appears out of nowhere wearing the same clothes?
Meg Ryan fills her scenes with a sweet grace that comes from innate
beauty. She manages to keep her role as Maggie from becoming merely
depressed, with a good balance of drama and humour. She cannot hide the
smile that has won her a legion of fans, and her tears will move you. It
is also good to see Nicholas Cage taking a break from the
butt-kicking-action-money-making movies and delving into romantic drama
for a change. He's quite sensitive as the love struck Seth. In fact both
of these roles are atypical for Ryan and Cage, but they seem to work
well together.

Review for Borrowers, The (1997)
Cast: John Goodman, Jim Broadbent, Mark Williams, Hugh Laurie, Bradley
Pierce, Celia Imire, Flora Newbigin, Tom Felton, Raymond Pickard
Director: Peter Hewitt
Screenplay: Gavin Scott and John Kamps based on the books by Mary Norton
Having seen the Mary Norton books in the library as a child, I had
always thought they were called The Burrowers' - as in people who
tunnel holes in the ground and not THE BORROWERS - as in I would like to
borrow your pen. So I was pleasantly surprised (forgive my ignorance),
that this movie was more than just about little people living like
rabbits underground, but about little people surviving in a world of
giants (humans).
Numerous comparisons can be made with this movie. One of which would be
MOUSE HUNT, in which there is almost an identical scene of a pest
control freak trying to exterminate, in this instance, tiny children. I
absolutely detested MOUSE HUNT for its mindless, commercialism. However,
I feel that THE BURROWERS has a little more to offer than, This is a
mouse, this is a house, and this is about the level of my IQ.' In this
instance we have more than mere running about, blowing things up and
brainless tomfoolery. Ocious P. Potter (John Goodman) is trying to tear
down the house belonging to the Lenders, in which the Borrower Clock
family live. Unless the family will is found they will be made homeless.
Other comparisons can also be made to THE LAND OF THE GIANTS. There is a
wonderful opening scene, where the Borrowers are exploring the Lender's
kitchen, using tiny mountain climbing equipment made of paper clips,
thread etc. The initial feel of the two shows is much the same, except
the sets and special effects are far superior here and this is a comedy,
not a drama. The final scene is reminiscent of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS. If
you think that these little people can be easily squished under your
boot, then think again when they bring a giant down.
I think this is quite a fun movie for the family. Adults who have read
the Mary Norton books will probably relive memories of their childhood,
whilst a new generation be introduced to THE BORROWERS. However, sadly,
I believe these books are no longer in print.

Title
Review for Perfect Murder, A (1998)
Cast: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortensen, David Suchet,
Sarita Choudhury
Director: Andrew Davis
Screenplay: Patrick Smith Kelly based on the play "Dial M for Murder" by
Frederick Knott
When it comes to a good ol' murder yarn, one wants to be surprised,
thrilled and kept in suspense throughout. With these elements in place,
one will be swept away with the mystery. There is no perfect murder,
there are only those who get away with the crime and those who aren't so
lucky. In the case of this movie, the crime is almost perfect, with the
one exception of human error.
In a re-make-over of the classic DIAL M, we are represented with that
most horrid scenario of a man wanting to murder his wife. What is made
more poignant this time round, by Gwynetth Paltrow playing the wife,
than in the original role played by Grace Kelly, is that the wife is
having an extra marital affair. Whether this is a sufficient reason to
commit murder, is debatable, but it is made clear in the plot that the
two major roots for murder are money and jealousy.
Keeping this in mind, we are led through one man's (Michael Douglas)
most horrid attempt at ridding himself of his most beautiful, unfaithful
wife. There are new elements added to the original Hitchcock classic,
bringing it up to date with current trend of nineties plot twisting. The
lover (Viggo Mortensen) is one of these elements. This is not necessary
better, but does give a different perspective to those who have already
seen the many reruns of the original. Those who haven't seen the
Hitchcock classic, are the ones who will most likely appreciate this
almost perfect mystery.
Michael Douglas is ideal as the cold, manipulative husband, and all his
WALL STREET colours shine through brilliantly in this role. Gwyneth
Paltrow is as usual charming and beautiful as the wealthy, unfaithful
wife. Not classical material, but more a valiant attempt at trying to
recreate the magic of DIAL M.

Title
Review for Nutty Professor, The (1996)
Cast: Eddie Murphy (Prof. Sherman Klump, Buddy Love, the entire Klump
family), Jada Pinkett (Clara Purty), Larry Miller (Dean Richmond).
Written by
David Sheffield, Barry W. Blaustein, Tom Shadyac, Steve Odekerk,.
Directed by Tom Shadyac.
I had heard rumours that Eddie Murphy had used this movie to poke fun at
fat people. After watching the movie, I remain unsure. It's like that
episode of Seinfeld', where the dentist becomes Jewish, and has a field
day cracking jokes about Jews.
Whatever his intentions (money making I'm sure), at least the themes of
accepting yourself as you are come through by the end of the movie. Yes,
that cliched term beauty comes from within' and, no, it's not something
that only fat and ugly people say to make themselves feel better.
Eddie Murphy has enough split personalities, to easily fill the roles of
Buddy Love and Sherman Klump with ease. He just acts himself to play
Buddy, and pretends to be nice  when Sherman. I still feel shivers
running down my spine when he does one of his cheesy smiles.
Sadly to say, much of the humour is generated at the expense, and
improper portrayal of fat people. Sitting around a dining table laden
with food enough to feed a glutton, bingeing in front of the T.V. set,
and stashing snacks is not a problem of the obese, but the bulimic.
Comment: Sherman Klump NOT Forrest Gump.

Title
Review for Out to Sea (1997)
Cast: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Dyan Cannon, Gloria DeHaven, Brent
Spiner, Hal Linden, Rue McClanahan, Edward Mulhare, Donald O'Connor,
Elaine Stritch Director: Martha Coolidge Screenplay: Marshall Brickman,
David Jacobs
'Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily ....'
No, not so merrily. Twiddle your thumbs, count the number of tiny lights
along each seating row. Change cinema seats several times and see if
your perspective of the movie will improve. Count to 100, then divide
the even numbers with each alternate odd, and eventually you will have
survived a very tedious onscreen boat ride. Sure I was distracted with a
bloody nose and  contraband hot foods, but I found myself wishing the
premature end of this movie with let's say, an unsuspecting ice berg or
perhaps a lunatic saboteur with no 'Cruise Control'.
The 'Odd Couple' who became 'Grumpy Old Men', have less chemistry and
success, 'Out at Sea' than on dry land. Out in the ocean's blue yonder,
Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are struggling to stay afloat on a thin
plot and an even weaker script. Their usually witty banter and taunts
seem rusty from overexposure to salt air, and the cool ocean breeze has
added a touch of rheumatism to their acting. One thing that hasn't been
affected is their 'one, two, turn, slide' dance feet, which is the
highlight of this movie. Watch Matthau lead Ruth McClanahan around the
dance floor - it carries the same free spirit of something futuristic
and erotic. Brent Spiner (Data from STNG) is 'surprise, surprise' a bit
of an old Crooner on the side.
So if you can sing, and also dance; with much need of a free holiday,
look no further than 'Out to Sea'. Here they hire men in their 80's to
be the dance hosts for the over supply of lonely single women seeking
romance on Ocean Liners. So what does Matthau and Lemmon have that you
don't? Absolutlely nothing. So fish away, and rest assured that your
catch will be better if not younger, than the these two unhappy
fishermen who are out of sorts, out at sea.
Comment: A very mediocre episode of 'Love Boat'

Title
Review for Home Alone 3 (1997)
Cast: Alex D. Linz, Olek Krupa, David Thornton, Lenny von Dohlen, Rya
Kihlstedt, Haviland Morris, Marian Seldes, Scarlett Johansson, Seth
Smith, Kevin Kilner
Director: Raja Gosnell
Screenplay: John Hughes
I dislike HOME ALONE and the mention of the name McCauley Culkin, will
result in a shrill scream of displeasure. However, HOME ALONE without
Culkin, is like having Christmas without the Christmas tree. In the
first episode I sympathised with the neighbourhood burglars (Joe Peschi
and Daniel Stern), and wished the house would collapse on the overly
cute Culkin - who deserves a taste of his own medicine. The second
episode LOST IN NEW YORK, overly wallowed in sentimentality, which is
much the same as wading in your own puke.
Despite my intense dislike for these movies, when I think of HOME ALONE,
I also think of a White Christmas. In the latest instalment of HA 3,
it's Christmas again, but the warm fuzzy feeling of stockings above the
fireplace isn't there anymore. Maybe it's because the kid, alone at home
with pox (Alex Linz), is more bratty than cute. One of Macaulay Culkin's
greatest assets was getting away with blue murder and retaining the
charm of a cherub. Unfortunately, Alex Linz just looks like a kid who
enjoys playing pranks on people.
John Hugues, the brains behind the successful first two episodes, has
decided not to stray far from the formula that made HOME ALONE a
success. The minor variations come in the form of four international
spies (Olek Krupa, David Thornton, Lenny von Dohlen, and Rya Kihlstedt),
trying to recover a computer chip that ends up in the Pruitt household.
This sets up the once-done-too-often final scene, where the kid has a
field day bodily injuring and mocking the intelligence of adults. With a
variety of diabolical contraptions, likely to have originated from a
Nazi torture chamber, Alex punishes the four spies for invading his
turf. If you like to watch ball breaking, head cracking, fart smelling,
bum aching, electrocuting humour, then you have found it in HOME ALONE
3.
This movie does not compare well with the original HOME ALONE. If you
didn't like the original to begin, then there is no room for this movie
in your life. In HA3, the plot seems slower, the action sequences
laboured and the plot contrived - as if writer John Hugues were fishing
for trout in a dry stream.

Title
Review for Doctor Who (1996) (TV)
Paul McGann-The Doctor #8, Eric Roberts -The Master, Daphne Ashbrook-
Dr. Grace Holloway, Sylvester McCoy-The Doctor #7, Yee Jee Tso-Chang
Lee. Directed by Geoffrey Sax. Written by Matthew Jacobs.
This is the story of a 'Time Lord', half human, and half Gallifreyan,
who journeys through time battling everything from giant squids, giant
plants, giant spiders and bad nasties better known as the 'Daleks', and
in particular a evil, rival time lord known as 'The Master.' Or so this
is how many, viewers of the B.B.C. series, or avid sci-fi readers
remember him simply as - 'The Doctor.'
A cat has nine lives, but 'The Doctor' has thirteen. What could possibly
break this record number of lives? Perhaps the vast number of different
actors who have filled those timeless shoes, and their lovely female
companions with whom they share a little more than intellectual
interests.
So, after such a long wait, why have they brought back 'The Doctor',
'The Tardis' and 'The Master'?
This movie is a nice thought, and a nice effort. Special effects are up
to date, far superior to the slip-shod, 'flush the toilet for thunder
storm' special effects of the 1970's. We have a believable 'Doctor' and
a genuinely nasty 'Master'. The Doctor's new female companion is a
beautiful, intelligent heart surgeon, and the 'Tardis' has had its
interiors splendidly remodelled in the style of an English Library.
What could possibly go wrong? The answer is lack of chemistry. We have
all the ingredients, but none of the intense spark generated between the
'Doctor', his 'Companion', the 'Master' and the 'Time Machine.' Perhaps
the production isn't British enough, or simply, the time isn't right to
resurrect the 'Doctor'. Who knows, but there's nothing here that is
reminiscent of the classic 70's and 80's series, except for the familiar
whirr of the 'Tardis', which is forever immortalised in our minds in
another place, and another time.

Title
Review for Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)
Cast: Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner.
Screenplay: Mike Myers. Producers: Suzanne Todd, Demi Moore, Jennifer
Todd, Mike Myers. Director: Jay Roach.
In the 1960's Austin Powers (Mike Myers) International man of mystery is
as groovy as gravy, baby. Accompanied by Mrs Kensington (Mimi Rogers
ex-Cruise babe), one intense Bimbette who drapes leather well and knows
a judo chop or two (reminiscent of Ms Emma Peel of The Avengers'). This
Shagadellic pair chase the evil villain Dr Evil (Myers again), who has
done 6 years of medical school and is a personification of all Bond
baddies. Before Powers and Kensington can bag the evil Dr, he escapes
into the future with his furry feline in a cryogenic time capsule of a
Big Boy'.
In the 1990's Dr Evil re-emerges from his Big Boy' and so does Danger
is my middle name' Powers, whose personal effects include the handy
penis enlarger (an exotic weapon). Mrs Kensington now retired, is
succeeded by daughter Miss Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), who like her
mother knows a judo chop or two. They now battle Evil's new evils - the
pyschedellic Fembotic babes with bullet, booby-trapped breasts (out of
Dr Strangelove's books); Miss Alotta Fagina (who gives Pussy Galore a
run for her money), Number 2 (Robert business man' Wagner), and Evil's
very own IVF test tube son, with whom he shares a love me, hate you'
relationship.
So swing, shake and shag the years away - from sixties to nineties in
this absurd facade of the ridiculous. Myers is our for simple laughs and
sight gags. Of note is the fruit-covering-bodily-sexual-organ' scenes
which is quite cleverly done. So if you don't mind putting your brain in
your back pocket for let's say 87 minutes, you will probably enjoy this
brainless excursion into the mysterious world of Austin Powers, and his
international group of clowns.

Title
Review for Anaconda (1997)
Cast: Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Eric Stoltz, Jon Voight, Owen Wilson,
Jonathan Hyde, Kari Wuhrer, Vincent Castellanos Director: Luis Llosa
Screenplay: Hans Bauer and Jim Cash & Jack Epps Jr.
Anaconda is undoubtedly the most entertaining documentary of the year:
ANACONDA: A SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR THE GIANT SNAKE LOVER:
1.  Stay still, very still, look into it's eyes and don't move. Don't
even blink.
2.  The guaranteed way of not being eaten is to remain comatose for most
of the movie; ala get a amazon wasp to bite you on the tongue.
3.  Another way of making sure that you survive the longest is to make
sure that your name is at the top of the movie credits.
4.  Giant statues of snakes swallowing men, are generally a good warning
sign that there are Anacondas in the area.
5.  Axes are good, but a couple of double barrelled shot guns will do
the trick.
6.  If you can't shoot the snake, burn it.
7.  Snake bait - anything from monkey blood to humans will do nicely.
8.  Don't try using a fishing pole or a net, or you'll end up being the
bait.
9.  The snake spits, so get used to half digested bodies flying at you.
10.  And remember the trip ain't worth it if you're only making a
documentary on Amazon pygmies.
At first there were eight, then there were three,
Just when you thought you were safe, here comes Anacondee,
It's not the name of a bra, your jocks or undeewear,
Hold on tight all the same, the snake has no preference for what you
wear.
Sorry for crapping on; but my original review was too short, and I just
need a couple more paragraphs here and there to make the break; and I'm
plain running out of things to say about this stupid snake. So...
Comment: Skin the snake and make yourself a nice set of jacket, belts
and boots.

Title
Review for Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997)
Cast: Robin Shou, Talisa Soto, James Remar, Brian Thompson, Sandra Hess,
Lynn Red Williams, Irina Panteva
Director: John R. Leonetti
Screenplay: Brent V. Friedman and Bryce Zabel
Anyone who is a MORTAL KOMBAT fan will probably testify to the fact that
it is more enjoyable to play the game, than to actually watch the movie.
One doesn't get the same adrenaline rush when watching butts get kicked,
than if actively kicking butt themselves. Perhaps this is where the
future of cinema lies, with active participation from the viewer. Plus
the fact that computer game\kid's TV, never seem to transfer well from
small screen to big screen i.e. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Street
Fighter, Care Bears, The Power Rangers, whose popularity is as fleeting
as the change of seasons.
Much hasn't changed since the original MORTAL KOMBAT. Both movies have
plenty of well choreographed fight sequences, but when this is all it
has going for it, then MK2 becomes more than a tad tedious. The plot is
not surprisingly lost in the commotion of kicks and punches. Making this
an ill-balanced movie that comes to an abrupt end when the ideas
suddenly run dry. MORTAL KOMBAT was about saving the earth by winning a
fantastic tournament between out worlds. In MK2, all the rules are
broken and the reason it is called ANNIHLATION is because there are no
rules, feel free to kill anyone you wish.
Liu Kang (Robin Shou) the hero is back. I cannot understand why he
doesn't shoot fireballs like in the MK game. His love interest is
Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto), who only gets to use those deadly fans
once before spending most of her time locked in a cage. Rayden (James
Remar originally Christopher Lambert), does very little except say
sickly, chirpy things like I love humans', You must believe in
yourself' and We are family.' Sonya Blade (Sandra Hess) has her moment
of distinction mud fighting with Mileena (Dana Hee), whilst Jax (Lyn
Williams), who is White American in the game takes a genetic turn and
becomes Black American in the movie. Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) is as
frightening as a big bully and is too easily defeated in the end.
If you want to relive your MORTAL KOMBAT fantasies, then my suggestion
is to miss the movie and just play the game again.

Title
Review for Parent Trap, The (1998)
Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Elaine Hendrix,
Lisa Ann Walter, Simon Kunz.
Screenplay: David Swift and Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer, based on "Das
Doppelte Lottchen" by Erich Kastner.
Director: Nancy Meyers.
The danger of revamping a Disney classic is that it becomes unbelievably
difficult for the successor, to fill the shoes of the original. Try as
you might to revive the magical feel of the first Parent Trap, somehow
the nineties version lacks the same charm and grace, that made the first
an instant hit.
For beginners, Lindsay Lohan, the new Hallie and Annie Parker, who try
to reunite their long separated parents, somehow lacks the adorable
cheek of the original Hayley Mills. The basic story line is much the
same from memory, throw in a butler and a maid and the matchmaking
begins. If one word were needed to describe this film, it would be
incredibly perky.
If one knows the story line already, you may question why two seemingly
sensible adults, like Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) and Nick
Parker (Denis Quaid), would split up so quickly after the birth of their
daughter's; each taking a twin to care for on opposite sides of the
earth. There is no answer, and the question remains unanswered. They
just need to be apart, or the novelty of two girls finding out they're
twins would be lost, and the fun, pranks and plotting would not begin.
If anything, this movie brings some hope to those children who are
hurting after the separation or divorce of their parents. However,
Disney has a rather simple minded knack of superficially dealing with
such problems - the magical ending suggests that everyone lives happily
ever after. Unfortunately, the reality is that many parents don't get
back together, and the children carry much of the pain of family
break-ups into their adult life. Perhaps, the more truthful, unhappy
ending, which Disney has so obviously avoided, is the fact that
Elizabeth James and Nick Parker would in reality never get back together
again. But such is the policy of Disney, that this remote possibility
could never be so.

Title
Review for Legionnaire (1998)
Directed by Peter MacDonald
Writing credits: Sheldon Lettich, Rebecca Morrison
Cast: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Berkoff, Ana Sotrenovic
This movie is one in a long line of Jean-Claude Van Damme action flics
which unfortunately, hasn't reached any pinnacle. The focus in this
movie is on boxing, shooting, comradeship, desert, forlorn love rather
than martial arts. The theme is the French Foreign Legion', meaning
brown uniforms and LOTS of marching. It is very reminiscent of older war
epics like Khartoum'. A good proportion of the movie highlights how
well the men in the Legion are able to march across desert, with a
mixture of heroics highlighted by Van Damme, who includes Dumas' themes
like All for One', but without the Musketeers. If this movie was
intended to capture a Lawrence of Arabia' feel about it, it fails in
the area of cinematography, the sand isn't as white, the kurds not very
menacing (except for blowing up a fort and dragging a man across sand)
and Van Damme is not romance personified. This is not to say he doesn't
try, and this is probably one of his better films  at least he has
dared to venture out of the formula that has been a millstone in
disguise. The ending is abrupt and leaves the viewer wandering whether
they ran out of footage or budget and is the film's weakest point.

Title
Review for Mars Attacks! (1996)
Cast: Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah
Jessica Parker, Martin Short, Jim Brown, Pam Grier, Michael J. Fox,
Danny DeVito, Lukas Haas, Sylvia Sidney, Rod Steiger, Paul Winfield,
Natalie Portman, Tom Jones, Joe Don Baker Director: Tim Burton.
Screenplay: Jonathan Gems
"The Look" is probably the most distinguishing feature of any Tim Burton
movie. There is no exception with this finished product of alien
carnage. "Mars Attacks" carries a unique feel which is the handy-mark of
Burton's direction - everything from the decor of the pock-a-dot
interview chairs, to the shadows behind the president's curtains, and
the very interesting "paisely" wallpaper at the old folk's home
(eye-catching).
There isn't much to reveal about the plot which isn't already
encapsulated by the title of this movie. These Martians haven't come to
share philosophical discourses on the origins of the universe. There's a
big name cast which is too numerous to mention, but briefly, Pierce
Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker learn the concepts of intellectual
stimulation when decapitated. Two thumbs up for Martian-Human
experimentation. Those who get fried by Martian lasers are "con man"
Danny Devito, "My hair looks good" reporter Michael J. Fox, the American
Congress, a dove and lots of humans. The President of The US of A, Jack
Nicholson, gets impaled by a Martian "conquerors" flag and pole. The
president's wife, Glen Close, is squished beneath her favourite
chandlers; but happy to say "New Ager" Annette Bening and Tom Jones
escape safely to some hidden caves in Bali. Such is Martian Justice.
Not hilariously funny, but quietly amusing. Unfortunately there isn't
any aerial "Martian flying saucer - human jet fighter" dog fight's which
made ID4 interesting. The humans are too easily squelched by the
dazzling Martian laser-works display, and the Martians are too easily
defeated by the crooning sound of 50's music.

Title
Review for Bug's Life, A (1998)
Voices: Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, David Hyde
Pierce, Denis Leary, Joe Ranft, Phyllis Diller, Richard Kind.
Screenplay: Andrew Stanton and Donald McEnery & Bob Shaw. Directors:
John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton.
Somehow the idea of playful, individualistic insects with attitude
hasn't caught my imagination. This movie is primarily aimed at children,
but will entertain adults as well. It is not as cleverly scripted as the
humourous Antz, but carries about it a more innocent charm that is rose
coloured and typically Disney. From the story's start you get the
feeling that the dumb, mean locusts are being set up for the cute,
little, purple ants to overcome. This is to highlight several Disney
themes like  It doesn't pay to be a bully', for every Goliath there
are several Davids', there is strength in unity' and dare to be
yourself'. There is enough good O' southern preaching in this movie to
fill the sermon books of any lay preacher. Needless to say, Disney does
not failed to entertain or deliver the goods. The songs are lively, the
characters delightful and engaging. Although this is not my idea of A
Bug's Life, which is usually promptly ended under my foot, who is to say
we can't romanticise a picture perfect insect world where everything
works out perfectly in the end.

Title
Review for English Patient, The (1996)
Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche, Willem
Dafoe, Colin Firth, Naveen Andrews, Julian Wadham, Kevin Whately,
Juergen Prochnow Director: Anthony Minghella Producer: Saul Zaentz
Screenplay: Anthony Minghella based
on the novel by Michael Ondaatje Cinematography: John Seale Music:
Gabriel Yared
This movie gave me a neck ache, a backache, a bum ache and a headache. I
took two toilet breaks, waded through two litres of coke (to help me
stay awake) before it finally ended.
I spent 162 minutes of precious time to find out that the 'English
Patient', (Fiennes) was a count who was an adulterer, a traitor and a
murderer; all as a result of his fooling around. He ends up scar-faced
and unrecognisable so we are meant to feel sorry for him.
I don't buy it, but everybody around me did (especially the women all of
whom were snivelling with sympathy).
Perhaps I'm being too hard on him, after all he is a dying man. How
about the 'English woman' (Scott Thomas) who is involved, perhaps she is
of good character and somebody worth saving; but alas, she is a wealthy
snob, who has a loyal, caring husband and I'm beginning to feel sorry
for her already.
The only person that I had any sympathy for in the entire movie was the
husband who was cheated on. Perhaps he shouldn't have crashed the plane,
but sealed the 'English patient' and the 'English woman' up in that
lovely cave to give their romance some time to chill.
This movie is undoubtedly the con artist film of 1996. It conned the
audiences, the critics and the Academy Awards, all of whom failed to see
that it is nothing more than a glamorised story of two uninteresting,
English aristocrats.
The scenery and cinematography is undoubtedly spectacular, and the lull
of the soundtrack will reduce you to tears.
Comment: Get rid of Fiennes and Scott Thomas, bring in Garbo and
Valentino. Then perhaps the screen will start to sizzle.

Title
Review for Jing cha gu shi IV: Jian dan ren wu (1996)
Cast: Jackie Chan, Jackson Lou, Chen Chun Wu, Bill Tung Director:
Stanley Tong Producer: Barbie Tung Screenplay: Stanley Tong, Nick
Tramontane, Greg Mellott, and Elliot Tong
What is a Jackie Chan trademark? Attempting all his own stunts and
breaking all his bones is probably one. An extremely high premium rate
on his life insurance policy is probably another. How about the Mickey
Mouse comicness of his over exagerated expressions - probably a third? I
find this annoying and some critics will disagree with me. Some people
actually like this sort of kiddy mix of kick-butt-attitude action and it
probably served Chan well in his twenties and thirties, but there comes
a time in life, when it just doesn't seem appropriate anymore. When
you're past forty, showing you're naked butt, no matter how well toned,
just doesn't live up to what it was a decade ago. I'm referring to the
arse uncovered, dog sniffing, girl gawking scene which goes a little
past embarrassing. Please, Jackie not again.
As is expected of most of Chan's movie, this is fast moving. Let's face
it this little' 5'9' chap just can't keep still. He is undoubtedly the
most agile, acrobatic, hyperactive Hollywood star and proves it by
dancing elegantly to cat and mouse throughout this movie. So to the plot
- it all seems a vague blur, but has a something to do with Russian
Mafia, the CIA and Jackie. Who cares about the plot anyway, they're
always vaguely similar and most people paid to see the action anyway. Of
note is a particularly back breaking ladder scene, which Chan uncannily
uses as an extension of his body, creating the feel of two become one.
Artistic and well choreographed. Now I'd like to see him do these same
stunts on ice - which would be spectacular or a spectacle.
The acting .. hmmm . I'll just skip that discourse and mosey along to
say that this is number four in the long line of POLICE STORY sequels. I
missed the first three and somehow, I have the strangest feeling I
haven't missed much. There will be the die hard Chan fan's who will
disagree with me even as this never-ending saga of Chan sequel's
continue. So I didn't like the movie overall, but Chan will live to
fight another day.

Title
Review for Face/Off (1997)
Cast: John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, Alessandro
Nivola, Dominique Swain, Nick Cassavetes, Harve Presnell, Colm Feore,
Margaret Cho Director: John Woo Screenplay: Mike Werb & Michael Colleary
Today's modern standards of plastic surgery haven't quite reached the
pinnacle of sophisticated face lifting and shifting' so fancifully
displayed in this montage of action packed thrills. This however,
doesn't detract from the fundamental key elements of gut wrenching'
anguish, edge of the seat' suspense and bladder-bursting to go'
tension generated by this John Woo movie.
If violence can be described as artistic, then Face/Off' is the movie
to watch. John Woo has the impeccable flare of a master demolition
expert combined with the talents of a maestro painter; who uses the
brush strokes of exploding boats, flying bodies and two talented actors
to help colour the doll canvass of the big screen. John Travolta and
Nicholas Cage are two actors of commendable note-worthiness, who not
only switch faces but also families and identities. Their complex
characterisations and improvisations of the characters Sean Archer and
Castor Troy, are best appreciated when standing behind the other's face.
Sean Archer (Travolta), the deputy in charge of the special services
division of anti-terrorism is hell-bent on catching terrorist Castor
Troy (Cage). Troy the magnificently insane creator of chaos, is amongst
other things the executioner of Archer's son's life. The chase, which
carries more than a heart beat of professionalism, has now become a
personal vendetta for vengeance. It is Archer's way of overcoming the
grief of his lost son, and also the means of resolving the remorse of
survivor's guilt - why didn't I die instead?'
It is when Travolta becomes Cage, and Troy becomes Archer that things
begin to heat up on screen. Memorably and ironically, each is given the
opportunity to change, alter and\or destroy the worlds of their most
hated enemy. Troy the Terrorist is given the chance to become Archer the
Hero. The egotistical villain grasps the addictive opportunities for
much needed attention with two very greedy hands. So much so he defuses
his own bomb to get blazing national praise and personal glorification.
His opportunities include the sick urge to satisfy his enemy's wife in
bed, by becoming the alluring gentleman that never was; visiting the
grave of the child he killed without a shred of remorse, and teaching
his daughter self defence which in foresight would become his undoing.
Sean Archer is mortified by the prospect that he will be forever trapped
behind the face of the man who murdered his son. Looking in the mirror
is all he needs to remind himself of the heinous crime. When given the
opportunity to save Castor Troy's family, he does so because of the
gentleman that he is; and by a morbid twist of fate he finds the son he
lost by killing the man who would be Sean Archer.
Strangely satisfying, poetically just and painfully moving when the
enemy you face carries your own appearance.

Title
Review for Warriors of Virtue (1997)
Cast: Mario Yedidia, Angus Macfadyen, Marley Shelton, Chao-Li Chi, J.
Todd Adams, Adrienne Corcoran, Doug Jones, Don W. Lewis, Jack Tate
Director: Ronnie Yu
Producers: Dennis Law, Ronald Law, Christopher Law, Jeremy Law, and
Patricia Ruben
Screenplay: Michael Vickerman & Hugh Kelley
If you thought THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES or POWER RANGERS were
bad, wait till you watch WARRIORS OF VIRTUE. This creation has sunk the
quality of children's movies to a new all time low. I should have seen
it coming and heeded my friend's warning. No good can come from butt
kicking kangaroos, carrying far-eastern religious philosophies.
The dialogue is so garbled, that one may perhaps gain the true meaning
behind the gibberish, if one was perhaps meditating on Speed' and only
then if struck by lightning first. The ending comes as suddenly as
kangaroos becoming TRANSFORMERS. In this case, they merge into a bright
light and blast the bad guy into oblivion. What a major cop-out for an
ending!
As for each of the Roos  there are five of them, and each symbolises a
virtue that is colour coded - blue (water), red (fire), silver (metal),
green (wood) and white (air). They are all pretty lame (not to mention
stupid), except for great tail strength. As they started to annoy me
during the movie, I felt like tying them together and stringing them up
by their tails for a good Mexican Pińata.
Most annoying of all is the kid (Mario Yedidia) who finds himself lost
in the world of Tao. I detest whiny kids and this one isn't short on
that. Besides that, the director, Ronny Yu who is best known for his
Hong Kong fantasy, kick flicks' ie THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR, has made
this children's movie a little too outlandish for my taste.

Title
Review for Barb Wire (1996)
Cast: Pamela Anderson Lee, Temura Morrison, Victoria Rowell, Jack
Noseworthy, Xander Berkeley, Udo Kier Director: David Hogan Screenplay:
Chuck Pfarrer and Ilene Chaiken
She leaves a trail of dead men behind her. Hates to be called babe',
which results in violent mood swings, more often than not resulting in
the male offender's untimely death. She struts, and stalks her prey with
the style of a night club stripper, and calls herself Barb Wire' to
give her gimmick an edge.
The year is 2020 and we are in the midst of the second American Civil
War (Is there anything left to fight about?) A new breed of hero has
evolved - an ex-marine, very pre-pre-pre menstrual, angry woman, dumped
by her boyfriend, who has a lot on her mind, and a lot to prove to the
world (Hey, I thought that was G.I. Joe's set-up?).
What Ms. Barb Wire (Anderson Lee) needs to understand is that less
flesh, means more mystery; silicon belongs in computer chips, and not
part of the mammary glands; too much leather constitutes a sofa, not
clothing; a name like Barb Wire' rusts easily, and belongs on the metal
scrap pile; and no, there won't be a long line of future sequels.
This babe', (ooops, please don't shoot me) is history.

Title
Review for Lost in Space (1998)
Cast: Gary Oldman, William Hurt, Mimi Rogers, Matt LeBlanc, Heather
Graham, Lacey Chabert, Jack Johnson, Jared Harris
Director: Stephen Hopkins
Producers: Mark W. Koch, Stephen Hopkins, Akiva Goldsman, Carla Fry
Screenplay: Akiva Goldsman
LOST IN SPACE is as convolutedly, complex as an episode of Star Trek in
its time dimensional best. Action packed enough to keep hormonally
charged pubescents happy and worthwhile enough, for parents to get rid
of the kids for an Easter afternoon break. I'm sitting here, still
trying to work out the in and outs of who went where and when, looking
for who and found what, only to prevent something from happening, so
that they could travel through the centre of a planet to escape it's
gravitational collapse (theoretically not sound). If you're lost in time
and space, so am I, which is why this movie is so aptly titled LOST IN
SPACE.
Imagine giant metallic spiders, battling powerful pet robots controlled
by a highly intelligent, lonely child. Included are evil doctor
saboteurs, a Captain America unlucky in love, computer generalised
monkeys with a great set of lips; a mother in charge, a father
neglecting his children, the family pride, the family misfit - say hello
to the Robinson Family. This story is immersed in state of the art
special effects, fanciful explosions with loud metallic noises
interspersed in between moments of quiet reflection, before another bout
of noise and explosions, screams, numerous amusing one liners and
finally a way home.
This adaptation of the popular 60's sci-fi series is light years ahead
of its predecessor. Gone are the once daggy costumes, the Ed Wood sets
and the corny, soppy dialogue which suited its time. Put your seat belts
on because the 90's version of LOST IN SPACE doesn't give you much time
to contemplate a toilet break. Memorable scenes include still frames of
the family Robinson frozen in mid air whilst gate travelling, Will
Robinson jumping into a pit slow motion and numerous scenes of John West
humiliating himself trying to impress Penny Robinson.
The cast is well chosen. William Hurt is in fine form as the father,
John Robinson. Mimi Rogers is ideal as the down to earth,
speak-your-mind mother, who doesn't take crap from anyone. The evil,
troublesome, meddling, snivelling Dr Smith is portrayed by Gary Oldman,
who has a knack for playing villainous roles. Then there is Matt LeBlanc
of friends, who shamelessly humiliates himself with some of the worst
pick up lines a guy can think off. But I believe the story belongs to
Will Robinson (Jack Johnson), the genius kid with a heart of gold.
Good family entertainment for all members of the family.

Title
Review for As Good As It Gets (1997)
AS GOOD AS IT GETS is one of those brown packages that you get in the
mail that far exceeds all your expectations. Well written, sensitively
directed and wonderfully acted, makes this unusual romantic comedy one
of those rare treasures that one can look back on with utter delight.
Meet Simon the fag, Carol the waitress and Melvin the neurotic,
obsessive/compulsive, acid-tongued writer from hell. Mix these three
intriguing characters from very different walks in life together and the
result is an explosive experiment of human interactions. Watch the
neurotic writer (Jack Nicholson) spit hellfire on the fag (Greg Kinnear)
and waitress (Helen Hunt). Watch the fag get brutally beaten before
emerging triumphant, post emotional catharsis with renewed artistic
inspiration, thanks to the compassion of the waitress. Watch the
waitress struggle to bring up a sick child alone, waiter on the neurotic
writer before writing long thank-you letters where conscience becomes
the letter's most difficult issue. Then observe the neurotic demon
change into a guardian angel when he helps shelter the fag, the dog,
before falling in love with the most wonderful woman in the entire
world. This is life, and this is as good as it gets.
I've never liked Jack Nicholson as an actor or as a person. However, one
has to commend him on making his character Melvin, one of the most
ascorbic and entertaining characters to shine on screen. Greg Kinnear
uses his puppy-eyed look to effectively to draw sympathy from the
audience when he is savagely beaten. Lastly, the ever charming, ever
delightful Helen Hunt, whose character is similar to Jamie in MAD ABOUT
YOU, is ideal as the waitress who speaks her mind and holds her own.
Fine performances from all concerned. Making this movie experience one
of the most enjoyable this year.

Title
Review for Double Team (1997)
Cast: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Mickey Rourke, Dennis Rodman, Natacha
Lindinger, Paul Freeman Director: Tsui Hark Producer: Moshe Diamant
Screenplay: Dan Jakoby and Paul Mones based on a story by Dan Jakoby
Another day, another Van Damme action flick with the same recycled
elements of mind numbing violence, gore and countless explosions.
1.  The use of innocent children in bullet riddled scenes to help
heighten the lagging suspense. Rourke's child dies in the cross fire
when an undercover operation to capture him, goes badly wrong, and Van
Damme is to blame. Shortly after this horrendous event, the two of them
tussle it out with fists and bombs in a post-natal ward where cots and
babies are tossed, pushed about and used as shields in the ensuing
battle.
Leave the kids alone!!! I cannot condone the manipulation of children as
tools to create excitement for the sole enjoyment of overwhelming,
senseless violence.
2.  A brotherhood of 'cybermonks', and the use of a colourful basketball
star who changes his hair colour more often than Van Damme changes his
clothes.
3.  The addition of a tiger to the final dual in the Colosseum; where
ironically, Van Damme and Rourke play out the roles of gladiators who
have done battle there two thousand years earlier.
4.  And amusingly, the destruction of the Colosseum when there was
nothing left to blow up. I wander how the Italians responded to this?
Strangely enough this movie was not as bad as I imagined it would be.

Title
Review for Gattaca (1997)
Cast: Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, Jude Law, Loren Dean, Gore
Vidal, Ernest Borgnine Director: Andrew Niccol Producers: Danny DeVito,
Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher Screenplay: Andrew Niccol
There is no gene for the human spirit,
No gene to help brighten your day.
There is no gene that will carry you that extra mile,
No gene for carrying your dreams all the way.
After watching a film as sterile and polished as Gattaca, I'm kinda glad
my hair is a little dishevelled, my shirt a little wrinkled, my shoes in
need of polishing and I don't need a finger prick blood test everyday.
In an age where genetic engineering is used to eliminate "evils" like
heart disease, depression and other ill personality/physical traits,
only those near perfection are allowed the opportunities for success
available to all of us today.
There is something lacking about perfection when the creation is purely
man made. Without the imperfect traits of character and physical
disability, we would lack the personality and the will to improve
ourselves. Ever noticed that no one smiles in "Gattaca", no one laughs,
and nobody cries. It's as if emotion, one of the most important aspects
of being human has been erased with the re-sequencing of the DNA codes.
Sure I get depressed when I fail a task, and I get angry when something
goes wrong, but I can also laugh at my mistakes and forgive myself for
making them.
In the stylised world of "Gattaca" these issues are nicely illustrated.
Ethan Hawke is the imperfect being who shows us that character strengths
are more than a list of percentages or likelihood for success. Sure this
movie is a long sit, but it has enough good material and thought put
into it than most of the recycled crap churned out by Hollywood.

Title
Review for Volcano (1997)
Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Anne Heche, Don Cheadle, John Corbett, Keith
David, Gaby Hoffmann, Jacqui Kim, John Carroll Lynch Director: Mick
Jackson Producers: Neal Moritz and Andrew Davis Screenplay: Jerome
Armstrong and Billy Ray
It's not a 'volcano' as we know it. More the beginnings of one leaking
lava into L.A.
The movie jumps straight into lava erupting into the city. This is a big
mistake because it leaves no room for the rest of the movie to move to a
higher level of tension. What you see at the beginning is the same thing
you see at the end. Too much lava and burned bodies.
The human rescue scenes are also clumsily contrived. With the victims
positioning themselves near lava pools and collapsing buildings,
waiting, no asking for disaster to hit them. Then pathetically needing
to be rescued. The hero's daughter annoyed me the most as she just
stands and screams when she sees lava moving towards her. Disappointing,
when all the other little heroines of 1997 are kicking velociraptors and
helping to save ships.
There is nothing to rejoice about. The day may be saved, but the battle
has only just begun. A volcano has been woken, so pack your bags and
leave L.A.
Comment: A special effect junky's food fest, which is about the same
level as burning shoe soles - ouch!

Title
Review for Nell (1994)
Cast: Jodie Foster, Liam Neeson, Natasha Richardson, Richard Libertini,
Nick Searcy Director: Michael Screenplay: William Nicholson and Mark
Handley based on the play "Idioglossia" by Mark Handley
A girl dances in the woodlands like a dryad amongst trees,
Free from mankind's influence and inhumanity.
She knows only her mother's love, and speaks a language of her own,
Her cry is voice of emotion, with sounds both beautiful and ugly.
A free spirit roaming the hills alone and unafraid,
Her only enemy is mankind, wishing to snare her like fallen prey.
As Tarzan must become the 'Lord of the Jungle' of his worth,
So Nell must return to the woodlands of her birth.
Her name is Nell, and nature is her home,
The sky is her rooftop, and the stars her tapestry.
Naďve, innocent child of the Forrest wild,
She is her own master, sister and family.
How strange it must be to grow up without the influence of television,
telephones, cinemas and modern society as we know it today. Frankly, I
don't think it is a disadvantage at all - too much technology and one
may lose that important sense of individuality. Nell doesn't fuss when
there isn't any hot water for a bath or electricity for cooking. There's
always the lake in the backyard, and every tree carries enough wood to
make a homely fire. No candy bars, chips or popcorn, just the nutritious
greens and berries of wild nature full of vitamins and low in calories.
Back to the basics and simplicity of early settler life.
Michael Apted has chosen a subject full of complexities to direct and
relay to his viewers. A meaningful experience for those willing to sit
through and try to understand the dilemmas arising from unsympathetic
media attention, human research, and Nell's freedom of choice. Good
supports from Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson and a memorable Nell
performed by Jodie Foster.
Comment: As a friend once commented, this movie has an 'ethereal'
quality about it.

Title
Review for Second Jungle Book: Mowgli & Baloo, The (1997)
Directed by Duncan McLachlan
Cast Jamie Williams, Bill Campbell, Roddy McDowall, David Paul Francis,
Gulshan Grover, Dyrk Ashton
Written by Matthew Horton, Bayard Johnson, based on novel by Rudyard
Kipling
I was surprised to discover that there was such a thing as a SECOND
JUNGLE BOOK. This is followed by a curious question  what makes it
different from the first? Not much. We have Mowgli the wolf boy, Baloo
the Bear, Baheera the Panther, Shere Kahn the Tiger and Kaa the snake.
All present in the 1967 Disney version, except they don't speak or
perform cabaret in this version. This movie is primarily geared towards
children, and in many ways it works judging from the reaction of the
talented young audience (imitating chimpanzee sounds). Children are
fascinated by animals and watching a child wander through the jungle,
without fear of the wild is reminiscent of the Garden of Eden in it's
hey day. My only morbid concern is of kids after watching this movie,
sneaking into a bear cage only to be eaten by the bear. Don't laugh,
it's happened before.
An amusing opening scene is of Mowgli (a very talented Jamie Williams),
being chased through the trees by two ugly chimpanzees with bad cases of
haemorrhoids. The scene ends with two chimpanzees on one side and Mowgli
with bear, panther and wolves backing him on the other. We know whose
going to win that fight! There is another amusing scene where Shere Kahn
the Tiger is attacking a camp of hunters. The men scatter up trees to
hide. The scene ends with the 7 year-old boy waving a fire stick at the
beast, before the frightened tiger runs away chased by a growling kid!
There are also numerous support roles for adults. Bill Campbell (THE
ROCKETEER) as the hunter looking for the boy, Roddy McDowall as the mad
King Murphy of the Lost City of Apes. However, this movie belongs to
Mowgli and the animals.
Great entertainment for the kids, especially if you don't want to take
them to The Zoo for Easter.

Review for I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)
Cast: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe,
Freddie Prinze Jr., Anne Heche, Muse Watson Director: Jim Gillespie
Screenplay: Kevin Williamson based on the novel by Lois Duncan
>From a psychopathic serial killer point of view, why is it more fun to
murder blondes? This post-teen slasher-hacker, man-with-hook gore fest
consist of two blondes and two brunettes. It becomes cliche if I told
you the blondes are a bitchy bimbo beauty queen and a wealthy boozing
boastful bastard, whilst the brunettes carry brains and better
disposition. So who lives and who dies actually becomes a little
dependant on hair colour and the associated characteristics that go
along with it. Nobody wants to see likeable characters become victims of
a butchering heaven, so unleash the wrath of the monster on those who
deserve it the most - the blonde bitch and her bitchier sister, the
bastard boyfriend with blonde hair and the uptight brunette who should
have been a blonde.
If fair was fair and not dependant on the colour of your hair, everybody
should have died by the end of this movie. This is the tale of a murder
within a murder. Four high school grads make the imprudent mistake of
concealing a crime that will haunt them forever. Their actions cannot be
justified by the fact that the person they ran over deserved to die.
What were they thinking? Run a dog over and hope that it won't bite
again? Personally I thought they did a good job. With speeds estimated
at 110 kms/hr it is unlikely the average human being could have survived
such a collision. However, we are referring to the average monster
tormentor from hell and these have a tendency to live forever. So run
the beast down with a car and he'll keep coming after you. Drown him in
the murky depths of a lagoon and he'll open his eyes and wink at you.
Cut of his hand and fling him into the sea and he'll rise again for more
fun.
So I did scream aloud once in this movie, and embarrassingly so. It was
just a loud noise but then again, I'm the jumpy sort and finger shadows
on the wall could scare the daylights out of me. However, I didn't find
this movie as terrifying as "Scream" - purely because there was twice as
much blood curdling screams, multiple mutilating stab wounds and
entrails galore in the latter. But still there is enough blood spilt in
this movie to keep a vampire happy in it's grave this summer. So I did
like this movie's quaint perspective on butchering the blonde and the
beautiful, but I disliked the ordinariness of the villain made out to be
as frightening as my Uncle Ted gone fishing. If you gave me a hook, a
hood and hat, I'd probably think you were going on a holiday.
So last summer was rather forgettable despite the fact we ran a man over
with a car, dumped his body in the sea and tried to lead normal lives
after. Perhaps next summer we should resurrect the two young lovers
separated by an accident and death. That way the monster with the hook
will be motivated to write uplifting notes like:
"I'm sorry I tried to kill you last summer. Let's kiss and make up."
"Forgive and Forget. Let's get together for a BBQ."
"Peace. I only use my hook for the laundry now."
There's nothing better than a peaceful solution to what happened last
summer.

Title
Review for Opposite of Sex, The (1998)
Cast: Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow, Lyle Lovett, Ivan
Sergei, Johnny Galecki
Director: Don Roos
Producers: Michael Besman, David Kirkpatrick
Screenplay: Don Roos
What is the opposite of sex, no sex? The truth is this movie is filled
with sexual issues, and no one's getting more action than a 16 y.o.
delinquent, Dedee Truit (Christina Ricci). This girl is voracious and
not easily satisfied. She manages to seduce Bill's (her half-brother)
young, hunky, gay lover, Matt (Ivan Sergei). This must be a play on some
woman's fantasy about accomplishing the seemingly impossible feat 
unless they were bisexual to begin with. Ricci's Dedee, is brash, bold
and very in your face. A tart if you must label her and showing the
characteristic signs of a vamp. Sad to see one so young and able, so
very wasted on wantonness.
In contrast, Lucia (Lisa Kudrow) the sister of Bill's (Martin Donovan)
dead lover is the exact opposite of everything Dedee stands for. Lucia
is cold, prim and proper and hasn't had any sex at all. A pen-ultimate
virgin if you must label her something and very bitter. Her charming
younger brother landed the man she had always wanted  Bill, and then
died of AIDS. This is a unique performance from Lisa Kudrow, that is a
welcome breath of fresh air from her usual, ditzy FRIENDS persona.
In general this movie is all about sex, the ins and outs, the good the
bad and different sorts. There's promiscuous teen sex, a middle aged gay
man seeking companionship and a stable relationship, the younger gay man
that is swept away with having a good time and good looks. A very
lonely, middle-aged, single woman that is always looking and never
getting any. The police officer (Lyle Lovett) with a sick wife, that
isn't getting any either. Teen pregnancy, murder, fraud, theft,
blackmail and what you have for yourself is something of a PULP FICTION,
where the adrenaline has been switched with sex hormones.

Title
Review for Kull the Conqueror (1997)
Cast: Kevin Sorbo, Tia Carrere, Litefoot, Karina Lombard, Thomas Ian
Griffith, Harvey Fierstein, Joe Shaw, Roy Brocksmith Director: John
Nicolella Screenplay: Charles Edward Pogue "based on the worlds and
characters of Robert E. Howard"
The worst thing that Kevin Sorbo could have done was to start taking
himself seriously. I believe what makes Hercules' the syndicate series
a success is the fact that it constantly pokes fun at itself and somehow
manages to kick itself in the head with slapstick humour and giddy,
kiddy fun. This sudden swing from action comedy (Hercules) to action
drama (Kull) comes as sudden and silly as a spaghetti meatball trying to
imitate a poached pheasant. Somehow that savoury chunk of meat with
tomato gravy doesn't quite live up to that small dried bird in fancy
dressing.
Sorry Kevin, I don't buy it. Kull' will forever be compared to that
awful masterpiece Conan', and it doesn't compare well. Conan' may have
been one of the worst films made, but it is still a brilliantly bad
film. It had a young Arnold Shwarzenneger with heavy accent, coated with
sweat, humping females and hacking monsters  everything a barbarian
should and does do well. One thing the two films do have in common is
bare flesh and humping. Sorbo performs adequately in both departments,
but this really isn't his forte. I believe Sorbo's strength is the
subtle comic talent evident in Hercules', which should have been
utilised to his advantage in this film but is sadly swept under the rug.
Also greatly missed are the wonderful sidekick characters that make
Hercules' a bottle of laughter. Everyone is so serious in Kull' and
nobody significant dies till late in the film.
The main problem with films of this genre is that it gets awful lonesome
when the world of Kull' is sadly under populated. There needs to be
more people around if you want to make it worth saving. I mean it really
defeats the purpose if Kull' was flexing his muscles for a couple of
rocks and withered tree (I'm grossly exaggerating, but it's still a
valid point). It's as if the director hasn't been able to get enough
extras to fill the empty streets and barren landscape in time for the
shoot. My suggestion is to use plenty of mannequins in the background.
I'm sure nobody would notice anyway. After all this is not a film aimed
at academy award nominated performances. So overall the experience of
Kull' was sadly a grand mistake of barbaric proportions. This
miscalculated move by Kevin Sorbo should not damaged his popularity, but
next time he starts pumping iron, I would like to see him in that
familiar loin cloth of cheery Hercules'.

withered tree (I'm grossly exaggerating, but it's still a valid point).
It's as if the director hasn't been able to get enough extras to fill the
empty streets and barren landscape in time for the shoot. My suggestion
is to use plenty of mannequins in the background. I'm sure nobody would
notice anyway. After all this is not a film aimed at academy award nominated
performances. So overall the experience of Kull' was sadly a grand mistake
of barbaric proportions. This miscalculated move by Kevin Sorbo should
not damaged his popularity, but next time he starts pumping iron, I would
like to see him in that familiar loin cloth of cheery Hercules'.

Review for Spawn (1997)
Cast: Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Martin Sheen, Nicol Williamson,
D. B. Sweeney, Theresa Randle, Melinda Clarke Director: Mark A.Z. Dippe
Screenplay: Alan McElroy based on the comic book by Todd McFarlane
Satan's first choice to be the General of Hell's armies is a good guy
assassin who gets murdered. He sells his soul to Satan to see his wife
again and gets resurrected as "Spawn" the ultimate fighting machine
from Hell. All of a sudden, Spawn (Michael Jai White) decides he doesn't
want to be a bad guy after all and starts beating the crap out of all
the other bad guys. Wait a minute - didn't he just sell his soul to
Satan a moment ago? Fickle, fickle, fickle.
Satan's plans are entrusted to an old fart known as 'Clown' (John
Leguizzamo). The general whiff of things is to nuke the world with
biological weapons before Hell's armies invade. Clown's elaborate scheme
is to get an evil entrepreneur 'Wynn' (Martin Sheen) to murder Spawn;
put a pace maker in the heart of Wynn that will trigger the biological
bombs if he dies; then resurrect Spawn to murder Wynn thus ending the
world. A simple analogy to this is - buy a cat to murder a rat; then
resurrect the rat and make it bionic. Encourage the rat to murder the
cat with a specially implanted time bomb that will destroy the entire
cat population so the dogs from hell can take over. Now all we need is a
hat and we've got Dr Seuss.
The final battle in hell - Satan does nothing but holler and scream -
even I can do that. Clown is bigger and badder than Spawn, yet is
overlooked for the position of General of Hell's armies. Why bother with
silly little piffy bombs, just invade earth and get it over with - from
the look of things there are a lot of baddies down there. What does God
have to say about all of this? Why is Spawn called Spawn? Is there any
relevance to breeding? If so shouldn't there be a good guy of equivalent
power representing the good side, someone perhaps called 'Sperm'? Sperm
and Spawn the Heroes from Heaven and Hell carries a ring to it.
I hope the comic makes better sense that this movie - cause Spawn sure
smells like a carton of rotten eggs. The only thing that fascinated me
about the entire movie was my fixation with Spawn's crimson red, flowing
cloak. Now if someone can tell me where I can my hands on one of these,
and don't tell me Hell cause I have no intention of going there.

Title
Review for Amadeus (1984)
Cast: Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham, Elizabeth Berridge, Jeffrey Jones,
written by Peter Shaffer, directed by Milos Forman.
'ha Ha HA HA Ha ha' What a laugh. Who would have guessed that Mozart
alias 'Wolfy' would be as jovial, irreverent and light hearted as this
movie has made him out to be. I mean being German and a composer, and
creating such operatic masterpieces as 'Don Giavanni' and 'Le  nozze di
Figaro' one would have thought perhaps a more serious and conservative
man was behind the work; but if you listen carefully to Mozart's lighter
and more playful compositions ie 'Der Holle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen
from Act II Die Zauberflote' one can perhaps hear the laughter and joy
that must have filled this musician's heart as he composed.
It must be a wonderful gift to be able to hear the structures of melody
and harmony, chords and progressions swimming with the same fluidity as
daily thought, and greater talent to be able to string together the
chorus of sounds without having to place a single note down on paper.
When the sound of music comes as easily as eating, sleeping and
breathing we have arguably the greatest composer that mankind has known.
Tom Hulce is wonderfully petulant as the rude, arrogant talented
Amadeus. His unique interpretation of the man is commendable, with the
added signature of that laugh making this particular characterisation
distinctive to say the least. F. Murray Abraham, is Antonio Salieri a
rival composer of the time. He excels at giving scathing looks of
jealousy; whose own tepid mediocrity pits him to blame God for bestowing
the greater gift of music on another man. His resulting actions brings
both raging revenge and regretful remorse. Also of note are the creative
white wigs of that period, unfashionable now, but perhaps a foreseeable
revival in the 21st century?
So perhaps we will never know the true 'Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart', but we
still have his music to remind us of the man. Although he was
extraordinary in terms of musical talent, it is evident in the movie,
that he also carries the yearnings of a common man; and it is the
miraculous transformation of these ordinary feelings of joy and despair,
sorrow and laughter into the heartbeat of thoughtful notes, which sets
him far above the rest.

Title
Review for Boogie Nights (1997)
Let's take a long hard deep look at the porn industry. Far removed from
the norm are these gods and goddesses of sex, who use their bodies as
tools to arouse the onlooker. They're movies show sirens lost in the
addictive sea of lust as they mingle and mix scents and issues. We hear
repeated throaty moans as they go over and over and over the mechanics
of love making like the pistons of a steam engine. Performing the erotic
dance with possessed twist and turns, seemingly lost in a depraved
embrace as if they didn't get enough of it. They are seemingly able to
reach greater heights of pleasure with each successive multiple orgasm.
Yeah, tell me about it!
So who are these titans of sex? A homeless boy (Mark Wahlberg) who
didn't get enough love from his mama proves himself to the world by
using his greatest asset  a big dick. A forlorn mother (Julianne Moore)
caught up with her success' in the sex industry, makes up for her lost
child by mothering and f'king the homeless lad. Then there's
Rollergirl', a blonde bimbette school dropout well known for giving
good mouth, also gets mothered and f'kd. There are others, but in
particular the Godfather of this big f'king family, the director of the
movies himself (Burt Reynolds).
What makes this movie interesting, is that it shows us what life is like
behind these fantastic orgies. The lonely pain, the inner suffering, the
craving for love and acceptance, and the profound emptiness within. Add
to this poor self-esteem, psychological instability, alcohol and illicit
drug dependence and you have perfected an emotional wreck. It shows us
how easily young and homeless teens are led into the seemingly
glamorous' sex industry, tempted by its easy material gains. This is
followed by a vicious cycle of ups and downs caused by an industry that
chews up its stars quicker than a mouse can breed. Those who manage to
break the chain are the lucky ones, those who don't die young.
The actors who perform this study on the sex industry are marvellous.
Mark Wahlberg fills the shoes of the young, naďve boy who is transformed
by the sex industry with great sincerity. Julianne Moore shows us with
her performance that she has done her study by accurately portraying a
slut queen, but it is Burt Reynold's who excels and shines as the
business man porno king.
This is a well made, finely crafted, humorous study on the world of
pornography and is good resource material for anyone thinking about
becoming a counsellor for young people.

Title
Review for Smoke (1995)
Cast: William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Stockard Channing, Harold Perrineau
Jr., Forest Whitaker, Ashley Judd Director: Wayne Wang Screenplay: Paul
Auster
Smoking is a carcinogen, and it also hardens your blood vessels causing
coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular
accidents. In short you either die of lung cancer, a heart attack or
become an invalid, that is, unless, you die of old age first....and
everyone in this movie smokes.
Imagine taking out the garbage, making dinner, getting groceries or
buying a newspaper. This is what this movie feels like .very ordinary.
Strangely enough, being ordinary is its greatest strength.
Wayne Wang in his lapse-a-dasical manner, goes the long way about
telling a story about a grocery store owner (Keitel) who likes to take
photos, and smoke; who has an ex-girlfriend (Channing) needing money and
help, who also smokes; they have a illegitimate daughter who is drug
addicted and has an abusive boyfriend, who probably smokes; a regular
customer (Hurt), is an author, who chain smokes; he befriends a runaway
teenager, who learns to smoke; the kid is searching for his father
(Whitaker), who smokes expensive cigars. They all end up at a family
picnic smoking.
This is a very slow, non-involving movie, which has it's moments, but is
best left for nights when one is suffering from insomnia.
Comment: Where's the warning label that says smoking can be hazardous to
your health?!

Title
Review for Extreme Measures (1996)
Cast: Hugh Grant, Gene Hackman, Sarah Jessica Parker, David Morse, Bill
Nunn, Debra Monk, Paul Guilfoyle Director: Michael Apted Screenplay:
Tony Gilroy based on the novel by by Michael Palmer
As a member of the medical profession, I encourage the practice of organ
donation for the furtherance of research and medical science. So if
you'll kindly fill out this form. It merely states that members of my
trade can use your heart, kidneys and liver for transplantation. I
promise that the rest of the body will not go to waste, and will make
great viewing in an anatomy dissection lab. Imagine the heartfelt
appreciation of the first year medical students as they poke and prod
your insides and out, with fingers and scalpels not sparing any orifice.
I remember the "Oooohs" and "Aaaahs" having gone through the ritual
myself. If there is any pathology of note like a brain tumour,
perforated viscus or ambiguous genitalia, don't fret, we always pickle
and pot the most interesting specimens for display in our splendid
anatomy museum. Did I also mention that we want your body only after you
are dead, and not before.
When a prominent doctor becomes a renegade, we have the antiphony of
fears that Jekyll brings out in Hyde. Don't fear the doctor that wants
to kill a million people with a lethal viral genocidic bomb, fear the
one who wants your spine column so he can grow some pretty neural twine.
It seems that the overly clever doctor, is usually the one who ends up
preoccupied with himself and his work.
Dr. Lawrence Myric (Gene Hackman), a brilliant neurologist, has decided
to break his Hippocratic oath by kidnapping homeless men, and using them
as guinea pigs in his otherwise admirable feat of growing neural tissue.
This would be an outstanding achievement, no less deserving of a noble
prize, if the lame can once again walk, and the blind see. However, his
questionable method of research cannot be overlooked simply because he
carries good intentions. Hackman carries the natural elements of being
repugnant, which makes him ideal as the immoral doctor who sacrifices
his principles in place of his work. Dr Guy Luthan (Hugh Grant), seems a
bit too dithery and indecisive to make a good casualty officer; but once
out of the emergency seems more at ease with himself, despite being
shot, framed and beaten for uncovering the body stealing conspiracy.
Sarah Jessica Parker has a small but key role to play in the movie, and
is otherwise rarely seen.
So I did enjoy this psychological, medical thriller because it sparked
some professional interest within. The story isn't as tight or
suffocating as "Coma", but carries enough edge to keep you suspicious of
your local emergency department and doctor. When bodies start going
missing, think experimentation on a scale of extreme measures.

Title
Review for Anna Karenina (1997)
Cast: Sophie Marceau, Sean Bean, Alfred Molina, Mia Kirshner, James Fox,
Fiona Shaw Director: Bernard Rose Screenplay: Bernard Rose based on the
novel by Leo Tolstoy
The deranged mind ramblings of a majorly depressed woman.
'God Forgive me... I love my son, but I also love the Count... I like my
husband, but its the Count who really counts... My husband won't give me
a divorce, damn that Russian house keeper with a great English accent
for turning him against me... I need opium to dull this deep, unbearable
pain within me... God forgive me... I'm lonely... I'm a fool to think
the Count still loves me... Damn his mother.... Why does he get to go to
the opera every night and I have to stay at home.... It's not fair! He's
having an affair with Princess Georgina, I just know it... I can feel it
and see it in his eyes.... Why won't they let me see my son? I need
more opium.... I've cheated on my husband, what makes me think that I'm so
special that the Count won't also cheat on me... Ooooh look at that
pretty train on the tracks.... Reminds me of swimming when I was a kid...
Gosh, I really feel like swimming right now.... God forgive
meeeeeeeeee!'
Really Anna, pull yourself together. Fast trains and pretty bodies are a
no no. 'Arsenic and Old Lace', now that's a more lady like way to go.
Where's the Prozac when you really need it?
On a more serious note. This movie must be commended for its outstanding
costumes, sets and cinematography. Sophie Marceau doesn't carry quite
the same tense, woman on edge, feel that Vivien Leigh portrayed in the
1948 version of 'Karenina'. But few can, considering the amazing
parallel's between Leigh's real life and that of 'Anna Karenina'. Sean
Bean is a believable Count Vronsky, and James Fox carries the tortured
husband look well. Please get rid of that Russian Countess housekeeper,
with an English accent suitable only for 'tea and scones' within the
confines of Windsor castle. When she first spoke I broke into fits of
laughter in the cinema, and I apologise for my unruly behaviour to
anyone who may have witnessed it.
Be swept away by the romance of the Russian country; twirl till midnight
to the tune of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov; waltz the evening away in
palatial ballrooms draped with silks and satin; and watch the 'dying
swan' performed by artists who made the term 'ballet' famous; but above
all, keep a weary eye on that damn fast moving train.
Comment: One mind sweeping, breath taking, Russian operatic, Tol story.

Review for Scream 2 (1997)
Cast: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Liev
Schreiber, Jada Pinkett, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf, Omar
Epps, Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant Director: Wes Craven Screenplay:
Kevin Williamson
If something works well for a movie, don't change it. Keep what worked
in SCREAM and apply it to SCREAM 2.
Principle 1: Keep the blood bath going with multiple stab wounds, and in
the meantime kill as many people as you can.
Victim 1: Is pissing peacefully in toilet, before the moment of relief
is interrupted with a knife through the head. Victim 2: Watching a
movie, stab, scream, stab, scream, stab, scream. Victim 3: Blonde Girl
from I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER TV
series, redoes her famous run through the house chased by serial killer
number. Victim 5: The guy who talks too much gets it in the Van. Victim
6: Boyfriend gets crucified. Victim 7: Gets mulched by the good old but
handy axe. Victims 8 and 9: Don't forget the cops. Victims 10: Get rid
of the best friend.
Principle 2: Keep them guessing right to the very end. There are two
killers in the original SCREAM. This movie doesn't stray from the
original format and you may even guess who the killer(s) are, but the
motive although cliché, is a mystery in itself.
As with the first movie, I was simultaneously shocked and amused, at how
quickly the cast was decimated in number by the end of the movie. Those
who remain standing are the major leads but even they must go through
near death experiences. Sadly, Neve Campbell doesn't cop the axe like I
wanted her to, and disappointingly so, because she's the only one I
wanted out of the movie. Courtney Cox reprises her role as the bitchy
reporter, but despite her defensive female front, is still very
likeable. I wept for my favourite character Dewey (David Arquette),
handicapped after the original SCREAM, one can only imagine the worse
scenario after this movie - perhaps paraplegic or quadriplegic. On the
bright side, SCREAM 3 may be a bit of a REAR WINDOW, which would be
something to look forward two.  This is an overall satisfactory sequel
to the original.

Title
Review for Simple Wish, A (1997)
Cast: Mara Wilson, Martin Short, Kathleen Turner, Francis Capra, Robert
Pastorelli, Amanda Plummer, Teri Garr, Ruby Dee Director: Michael
Ritchie Screenplay: Jeff Rothberg
There's nothing simple about a movie which is more adequately described
as handicapped, retarded and disabled. Big warning bells should be
ringing in any parent's mind, if a strange man suddenly walks into their
child's bedroom, claiming to be a Fairy Godmother. My first reaction
would be to break his weedy little wand, before promptly raising a
double barrelled shot gun to his face.
This is a 'Cinderella' story gone badly wrong. A little girl's world is
turned upside down by the annoying intrusion of a whiny, whimpish,
incompetent Fairy Godfather (Martin Short). The result is a wish gone
awry - the girl's father becomes a statue, and his horse and carriage
turns into a mouse and pumpkin. Unless the spell is broken by midnight,
they will remain animal, mineral and vegetable forever. In the midst of
this mini-crisis, the evil witch, ex-fairy godmother Claudia (Kathleen
Turner), has also stolen the wands of all the good Fairy Godmothers.
Waves of nausea begin minutes into the movie, when Martin Short starts
waving his accident prone wand about the screen. This reaches
full-throttled retching, stomach churning gagging, and recurrent barfing
when a man starts to vomit frogs. This is probably a good time to exit
before the mean 'runs' start as well. If this movie was meant to make
children laugh, I didn't hear it. In fact the only noises I heard
throughout this screening were whimpering children frightened by the
Fairy Godfather 'oddity', and cries from others wanting to leave. Kids,
help your parent's save money; parent's protect your child's sanity; go
home and watch a good episode of 'Lassie' instead.
Fairy Godfathers are a fairy tale rarity. After this disgraceful
portrayal of male fairies, perhaps extinction would be the most humane
option - before another child makes the erroneous mistake of making a
not so simple wish - subjugating the world to further unnecessary
terror.

Title
Review for Boxer, The (1997)
Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Emily Watson, Brian Cox, Ken Stott, Gerard
McSorley, Ciaran Fitzgerald
Director: Jim Sheridan
Screenplay: Jim Sheridan & Terry George
I usually dislike movies that carry a strong political agenda and when
it concerns the IRA, the feeling sinks even lower. For one thing these
movies contain too many bombings, innocent killings, human suffering and
unhappy endings for my liking. Too much gloom and misery may be
gut-wrenching informing, but it sure kills the entertainment in the
industry. Fortunately, THE BOXER is more than just a political
statement. Director Jim Sheridan shows us the feelings of loss and pain
within a very closed secretive, community of the IRA. He paints for us a
gritty world of genuine suffering with non-glamorised footage of the
Irish world - cold concrete walls, perpetual grey skies, the rattle of
machine gun fire in the distance and the cries of an unhappy nation
shouting for independence.
What makes THE BOXER different is its approach to the subject material
and also an outstanding performance from Daniel Day Lewis. It shows us
how willing young lives are sacrificed for the belief in a single
principle. It focuses on a man who is a victim of circumstance (Daniel
Day Lewis). After being imprisoned for twelve years, he tries to rebuild
his life after being released from the penitentiary. A poignant point is
made when he realises that the best years of his life have been taken
away from him, by and for the IRA. His potential to be a great boxer,
his future, his childhood sweet heart, all the missed opportunities. It
is heartbreaking to see this grown man try to salvage the remains of the
day and to pick up where he left of with life. Fortunately, he sees the
need for change, to unite Protestant and Catholic and sets about doing
it the best way he knows how  through boxing. One of the most symbolic
moments of the movie comes when Day Lewis is fighting an African in the
boxing ring. His opponent is beaten, but instead of going on to finish
the man with more strokes, he puts his gloves down. Basically saying
that there comes a time to stop fighting.
This is thought provoking material, despite the fact that the ending is
rather ambiguous. One isn't quite sure what happens to THE BOXER. Does
he leave Ireland or does he go back to his neighbourhood? Otherwise this
movie does make a valiant attempt to try to shed some unbiased views on
the entire Irish Republican Situation.

Title
Review for Murder at 1600 (1997)
Cast: Wesley Snipes, Diane Lane, Dennis Miller, Daniel Benzali, Alan
Alda, Ronny Cox Director: Dwight Little Screenplay: Wayne Beach & David
Hodgin
A dead body in the bathroom makes a smelly, blood stained mess on the
floor. The mystery gets a little more baffling when the homicide takes
place in the White House. The victim is a blonde, Caucasian female in
her mid twenties who has had the honour of sleeping with Uncle Sam and
the dishonour of also sleeping with his son. Such is the shroud of
secrecy and hidden motives behind this slaying, that blame or suspicion
falls on anyone having come in contact with the woman, including the
janitor. The scene opens with the victim having gratuitous sex on the
president's desk, before moments later being bludgeoned to death in a
toilet cubicle. This is probably not the most sordid deal to have passed
over the polished wood of this most distinguished table, but it does
bring to mind that candid question - how many presidents have used this
table for recreational purposes other than political?
Wesley Snipes has reprised his role as a tough guy, no-nonsense homicide
officer assigned to uncover the layers of truth submerged beneath
thicker layers of lies. Teamed with Diane Lane posing as an Olympic
sharp shooter turned White House Secret Service Agent, together they
strip away the thick coats of mystery to find the President at the
bottom of the cake. This otherwise non-inspirational thriller has its
moment of pure silliness when we witness a game of murder in the dark'
in a maze of secret tunnels beneath the White House. The evil navy seal
is about to break Snipes neck in a death grip. Lane points her gun and
finds her mark between the Seal's eyes and should perhaps win the award
for best sharp shooting in the dark. If finding a target was this easy,
give me a blind fold, put an apple on your head and I promise I won't
miss.
This is the fifth tale involving the American President this year and
takes a rather ordinary fourth place behind the more thrilling AIR FORCE
ONE, the more corrupt ABSOLUTE POWER, and the more light hearted MY
FELLOW AMERICANS. When access to 1600 gets as easy as opening a couple
of metal grates, and roaming a few underground tunnels, I find it
surprising that nobody has tried to blow the Institution away with some
home made explosive. As for the excitement over a dead body in the White
House, well people die every day.

Title
Review for Thousand Acres, A (1997)
Cast: Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jason
Robards, Colin Firth, Keith Carradine, Kevin Anderson
Director: Jocelyn Moorhouse
Producer: Steve Golin
Screenplay: Laura Jones, based on the novel by Jane Smiley
Although this may appear to be another girly, weepy chic flic', and it
is, at least it comes at a reasonably high standard. Jocelyn Moorehouse
(HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT) does not resort to cheap tricks for
tears and the plight of these believable characters, are earnestly
addressed on screen.
A THOUSAND ACRES is based on a novel of the same name, written by Jane
Smiley. She has also cleverly entwined elements of KING LEAR into her
novel. A respectable farmer, a pillar in his community, wishes to leave
his farm to his three daughters. Everything seems perfect on the
outside, but beneath this veneer of a happy family, lies a most horrible
secret.
This is the story of three sisters torn apart by the past, the present
and the future. The youngest daughter, Caroline (Jennifer Jason Leigh),
is also her father's favourite. When she disagrees with his will, she is
unceremoniously disinherited from the family. The two older sisters
Ginny (Jessica Lange) and Rose (Michelle Pfeiffer), agree to his will
and take over the running of the farm. It is here that perfection
becomes to crumble, and the true nature of the family is revealed. As
the father (Jason Robards), becomes rapidly paranoid and believes that
the oldest daughters have stolen the farm from him and are now
mistreating him. This evolves into an ugly family and legal battle,
between the youngest daughter and father and the two older siblings.
Issues like infertility, breast cancer, dementia, incest, death and
dying, loss of a mother, forgiveness, unforgiveness, hate, anger,
resentment, sibling rivalry, unfaithfulness, family discord, husbands
and lovers and lots more tear jerking material are addressed. Although
too numerous for a single movie to handle, the novel is available for a
more comprehensive perspective.
Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are wonderful as the competitive,
and yet close sisters. Michelle is particularly good as an angry,
vindictive bitch who is out to destroy her father for what he did to her
in the past, whilst Jessica Lange shows more compassion and forgiveness.
It is these cornfields of A THOUSAND ACRES which binds them all
together, and which will eventually tear them apart.

Title
Review for Hussard sur le toit, Le (1995)
Cast: Olivier Martinez, Juliette Binoche, Pierre Arditi, Carlo Cecchi
Director: Jean-Paul Rappeneau
Screenplay: Jean-Paul Rappeneau, Nina Cornpaneez, and Jean-Claude
Carriere
There is something exciting about sex, when the players get to keep
their clothes on right till the end; and if there is a reason for
nudity, it is not to display the prowess of fantastic love making, but
for purpose and reason. The sexual tension, is so beautifully mounted in
this movie, that a gentle breath on the nape, can be as allegorically
erotic as a thousand kisses on the skin. This is a style that more
directors should learn to adopt. Being a French film, it also shows
commendable self-restraint.
The talented French cast includes Oliver Martinez, who plays Angelo
Pardi, an Italian of noble descent who is now living in exile. He is so
chivalrous, that he will brave the cholera plague to help a damsel in
distress. Hollywood, if not the world, needs more dashing gentleman like
this, to breathtakingly rapture the hearts of women who have lost faith
in the opposite sex. Then there is the beautiful Countess Pauline,
played by the stylish Juliette Binoche. Together, the duo, ride the wind
on stallions, shunning greedy soldiers and fleeing death.
This movie is set during the early 1800's, when the cholera plague
ravished towns in the south of France. Decaying corpses fill houses and
streets, as crows feed on the eyes of the dead. This is an unusual
setting for a love story, but the isolation and panic helps create a
breeding ground for respect to develop between the countess and her
champion. Although the ending comes too abruptly, it is easily forgiven
because of the overall lyrical style of the movie. When young lovers
meet, not even the world can stop them.

Review for Dune (1984)
Directed by David Lynch Cast Francesca Annis, Leonardo Cimino, Brad
Dourif, José Ferrer, Linda Hunt, Freddie Jones, Richard Jordan, Kyle
McLachlan, Virginia Madsen, Silvana Mangano, Everett McGill, Kenneth
McMillan, Jack Nance, Sian Phillips, Jürgen Prochnow, Patrick Stewart
Paul Smith, Sting, Dean Stockwell, Max von Sydow, Sean Young. Based on a
novel written by Frank Herbert
When one attempts to recreate a science fiction masterpiece, and a novel
as thick as Dune, it had better be well done, or there will be cries of
lynching or stoning from an angry mob. I cannot say that Dune is
exceptionally well done, when a good second half of the novel is
compressed into minutes of narration to help shorten the movie. So my
after thought is that perhaps a mini-series may have done this Epic
novel more justice than a feature length film.
One has to at least commend David Lynch for attempting a feat as
difficult as Dune. Although the special effects are not wiz bang
spectacular, he has managed to recreate the feel of the desert planet
Arrakis (aka Dune), which is the taste of Spice itself. Spice is the
most precious commodity in the universe. He who controls Spice controls
the world. For with it space travel or jumping is made possible, and it
is only found on one planet in the entire universe, on the desert planet
of Dune. The political scene is of an Emperor who controls the Spice but
is worried about the ascendancy of a rival House Atreides. To secure his
throne, he pits one powerful House against another. Namely Atreides
against Harkonnen, in order to weaken them, yet strengthen his own seat.
David Lynch best known for his dark, gothic, new age features like Twin
Peaks, in some ways is ideal for a movie like Dune. After all, one needs
a director to match the likes of the twisted yet brilliant mind of
author Frank Herbert. A prime example of the darker side, is the
homoerotic scene where a young man brings flowers in to the throne room
of the raving mad Baron Harkonnen. The obese and disfigured Baron
approaches the boy with a look of insatiable lust before ripping out his
heart plug. As the boy is dying, the Baron bathes in his victim's blood
before climaxing with an orgasm. The other scene of note is when an
enemy of the Baron is made to suffer by being made to shamefully milk
the antidote from a cat to counter the effects of a poison. Now if these
scenes do not encompass the meaning of perversity, I'm not sure what
does.
On a lighter and brighter note, less shadowed by the darker side of
Herbert and Lynch. This movie captures and recreates the wonders of dry
desert winds beating against frail human flesh; in a wilderness where
water is as precious as blood. Here the protectors of Spice are giant
Sand Worms which tower over the precious commodity like monolith
Colossi. This is a world where Bene Gesserit priestesses mind bend and
control the feeble minded, and the Fremen await the coming of a foretold
Messiah to inflame their blood with long awaited freedom. This is the
legacy of Dune.
Although Lynch has failed to recapture the immensity of the epic events
that unfold in the novel, he has succeeded in recreating the unique
flavour and feel of this most inspired of Herbert's works. On Dune,
Spice is the essence of life.

Review for Life Less Ordinary, A (1997)
Cast: Ewan McGregor, Cameron Diaz, Holly Hunter, Delroy Lindo, Ian Holm,
Dan Hedaya, Stanley Tucci, Tony Shalhoub, Ian McNeice, Maury Chaykin
Director: Danny Boyle Screenplay: John Hodge
This movie is an exercise on creativity, but in the midst of trying to
be original it loses all objectivity on the subject matter. We have the
usual scenario of a kidnapping which is your basic garden variety story
line for the round the mill mystery suspense thriller. Throw in a
kidnapper and victim who are destined to fall in love and get a surge of
endorphins as the eroticism mounts. Next include God, the angel Gabriel,
some other meddling angels and your mixture has just transformed into a
volatile stink bomb of a ludicrous farce.
The kidnapper (Ewan McGregor) is a poor nice guy who doesn't know what
he's doing. After being sacked he kidnaps the boss's daughter (Cameron
Diaz) who is not a very nice rich girl. We are meant to envision the
short, blue collar Ewan in grunge clothing, slipping within the leggy
tights of tall, classy, sexy Diaz. This erotic notion starts out on a
high note, but ends up with the same feeling of a trash romance novel
where the let down comes soon after the first sex scene. Oh and what a
let down it is. If only one can keep fantasising. Diaz's character soon
takes control of the kidnapping operation and soon has Ewan's character
trapped between her thighs. The movie starts to suffocate as she goes on
a wild spree of extortion, crime and bank robbery. Supposedly it is
meant to have a liberating feeling for this poor little rich girl. I
call it being plain bratty.
Sure there are great scenes of Diaz impersonating William Tell, and the
dialogue is in vogue and punchy. It sounds good, but a lot of it is
cleverly disguised nonsense that is as airy as the minds that thought it
up. The final scene discusses love and destiny between Diaz and
McGregor. It totally escaped me. I didn't see any love in the movie,
lust maybe, but definitely not love. As for destiny, well I'm glad these
sad characters found each other cause I wouldn't want them destroying
anybody else's life per chance. It is absolutely ludicrous that screen
play writer John Hodge has presumed that this is God's way of uniting
man and woman to have lasting relationships. I think a few Sunday School
lessons are in order.

Title
Review for Never Been Kissed (1999)
Cast: Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Michael Vartan, Leelee Sobieski,
Jeremy Jordan, Molly Shannon, John C. Reilly. Screenplay: Abby Kohn &
Marc Silverstein.
Producers: Sandy Isaac and Nancy Juvonen.
Director: Raja Gosnell.
I guess there are those who have never been kissed before (a rare and
dying breed), except if you're child  in which case it would be called
experimenting. Rarer still are those who have never been kissed before
they reach the twenties. Hardest to believe still, is that Drew
Barrymore has never been kissed. Despite all these hard to believe tit
bits, there are people out there who have never truly been kissed, and
who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet, sloppy
warm feeling of tongues intermingling, reassuring them that their search
for true love is over.
Well, this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her
the kiss of her life. And it's sweet. Drew Barrymore who shone in Ever
After' is wonderful as Josie, Grossy', the high school dweeb who becase
a professional editor, before being assigned by her paper to return to
school as an undercover reporter. It addresses the issues of how a
dweeb, becomes a prom Queen and finds the man of her life all in one
sitting. Hard to believe, but possible.
There may also be those who have been kissed before, but in fact, never
truly been given THE kiss. So this movie can be watched by those who are
waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it. Either
way, it is one enjoyable sit, with a fairytale ending.

Title
Review for Absolute Power (1997)
Cast: Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Judy Davis,
Scott Glenn, Dennis Haysbert, E.G. Marshall Director: Clint Eastwood
Screenplay: William Goldman based on the novel by David Baldacci
    "A two way mirror separates the master bedroom from a hidden vault
housing the accumulated wealth of an aged billionaire. In the vault, on
a chair, amidst bank notes worth one million, a jewel thief trapped
watches in deathly silence, as the young wife toys with a powerful
stranger on her master's bed. Laughter is mixed with the fragrance of
alcohol as the two tease and fondle each other playfully. Heightened by
the excitement of wine boiling blood, they toss and tantalise the other
with careless whispers and kisses. He wants more. She plays hard to get.
Furniture scatters like chips on a gaming table in this struggle for
dominance in the roulette of lust.
    He likes it rough. She enjoys the tease of the waiting game. Enough!
He strikes her. She hits back not so gently. Lust changes to anger as he
tears the silk fabric draping her slim body. He mounts her from behind.
She screams and squeezes him where it counts. It shocks him momentarily,
but doesn't dissuade his intent in this contest for sexual supremacy. He
pins her body to the ground with his own. With hands wrapped around her
neck, he tightens with the excitement of feeling her breathless and
writhing beneath him.
    Her hands grasps thin air, desperately she is losing this silent
crying game. A cold blade comes to reach. She blindly stabs. He pulls
away from her in pain, like a moth burnt by the flame. Mounting over her
tormentor in triumph, she raises both hands upwards ready to plunge the
blade into the heart of the beast. He cries for help. The bedroom door
bursts open. Gunfire. The woman drops into a pool of her own blood. She
has just lost the round in this 'Game for Absolute Power'."
Talk about a star packed action thriller - Eastwood, Hackman, Harris and
Scott. So were there enough pieces go around?  Sure. Eastwood is by my
accounts a fair director. So the distribution of power roles goes like
this. Gene Hackman gets to release his 'seven year urges', in 'ten
minute surges' (perhaps best left of screen); which is all too suddenly
ended by the 'boom boom' of Scott Glenn's long schlick fiery 'stick';
resulting in much overreaction by the 'anaemic' Judy Davis; soon
followed by an investigation headed by the 'Mr lonely hearts' Inspector
E. Harris; who longingly eyes the 'lovely' Laura Linney before she is
prematurely knocked of a sandy cliff, without hearing those unsaid words
'I love you'.
Clint Eastwood by far gets the best role - the 'fatherly', jewel thief
who has a conscience to uphold and a daughter to behold. It is this
particular character which stands above the rest. A man who does not
walk away from an unpardonable crime or an angry daughter, even when his
own life and fortune is at stake. If this movie is to be commended, it
should be for Eastwood's strong character and direction, if not for the
improbable plot and excessive sexual violence.

Title
Review for Turbulence (1997)
Cast: Ray Liotta, Lauren Holly, Hector Elizondo, Ben Cross, Catherine
Hicks, Rachel Ticotin, Brendan Gleeson Director: Robert Butler
Screenplay: Jonathan Brett
This is going to be a 'how stupid do ya take me for', 'winge review' on
an unhappy viewing of Turbulence.
1.  There must be strict government regulations about the passage of one
or more convicted felons aboard domestic flights - laws which protect
the innocent passengers. I would be very unhappy about taking my family
on board the same flight as two highly dangerous criminals.
2.  I'm also confused about the use of fire arms on air flights. In 'Con
Air', guns were strictly prohibited, even though the level of security
needed was higher on that occasion than in 'Turbulence'. On this flight
they allow four police officers to carry guns on board, yet these law
enforcers somehow manage to get killed and blow a hole in the plane at
the same time.
3.  When taking a prisoner to the toilet, one police officer goes into
the small toilet cubicle with the prisoner, and the other stands
outside. I have no problem with this except why lock the door? Why not
just leave the toilet door open, where both officers can keep an eye on
the prisoner at all times? All part of the stupidity to help create
situational tension.
4.  Gunshots are heard, and the two remaining officers investigate the
noise without cuffing the remaining prisoner to his seat. Trouble,
trouble, boil  and bubble! Soon after this, one officer struggles with
the prisoner, whilst the other just watches at a safe distance holding
his gun - excuse me, but how about lending your buddy a hand???
5.  Lauren Holly (the stewardess) has locked herself in the cockpit
(both pilots are dead) and is trying to program the auto pilot with help
from outside. She allows herself to be distracted and lured outside
(even when the plane is flying into a thunderstorm). Then wastes twenty
minutes of the viewer's time exchanging sexual innuendoes with Ray
Liotta, before finally realising he's evil. Yawn. When frightened, she
runs through the plane closing curtains behind her and putting away
fluffy toys in the luggage compartments above the seats!!!! Lauren,
aren't you meant to be saving the plane? Get back to that cockpit right
now!
6.  Ray Liotta (the serial rapist), is on death row and wants to end it
all with a 'big bang' - plummeting the plane into central district NY.
He goes the long way about trying to do this: namely trying to kill
Lauren, or sabotaging the plane's electrical systems. Wake up Ray, you
have a gun in your hands. Don't throw those bullets away! Wait till the
plane is nearer the city then blow several more holes in the plane. We
have an oversupply of guns on the plane and ya didn't think of using one
- not very smart for a serial killer.
7.  Is it aerodynamically possible for large domestic airliners to fly
upside down????
I'll also mention that Ray Liotta, who carries the same 'Ted Bundy'
charm, overacts with his fun role as the serial killer; and Lauren Holly
has given blondes a bad name. This movie made me laugh at its
incredulous plot as much as it made me want to strangle whoever wrote
the script.

Title
Review for Evening Star, The (1996)
Cast: Shirley MacLaine, Bill Paxton, Juliette Lewis, Miranda Richardson,
Ben Johnson, Scott Wolf, George Newbern, Marion Ross, MacKenzie Astin,
Donald Moffat, China Kantner, Jack Nicholson Director: Robert Harling
Screenplay: Robert Harling based on the novel by Larry McMurtry
The death of a young mother named Emma,
Claimed by that deadly ill known as cancer,
Leaves three children in the care of their grandmother,
The Grand Dame of doing things her own way'.
The sequel to Terms of Endearment' is a bad move in the direction of an
awful movie. One should not attempt to make a sequel to a classic tale
of dying if it is to be as morbid and unhappy as this. There was enough
misery in the first movie, why torture the audience with more sorrow.
How does one top a finale like death? More people dying of course. Not
just one death this time, but a minimum of two. Let's not toy with
cancer again, it's soooo yesterday. Let's use a vague disease that
nobody's heard of, or perhaps a handy debilitating illness known as
stroke. Sorry chaps (director Harling and author McMurty), no sympathy
points will be gained for killing off little old ladies. There's nothing
new in this material that can't already be found in a Nursing Home.
Aurora (Shirley Maclaine) hasn't learnt much from the suffocating
mistakes she made with her own daughter. She now reeks dominance and
disaster on her grandchildren. History repeats itself as the three
grandchildren, now adults, rebel in very different ways. Stubborn,
strong willed and impulsive. The youngest (Juliette Lewis) follows in
her mother's footsteps and becomes involved with the wrong guy (Scott
Wolf) despite advice to the contrary. The eldest (George Newbern) who is
also the angriest, has a history of juvenile delinquency and is
currently caged in a penitentiary. The middle (Mackenzie Astin) who is
perhaps the most stable has no ambitions, but carries a job, a de facto
and a child.
I don't blame them and I don't back them either. If had a grandmother
like Aurora, I would be jumping off a high rise building to escape her
clutches, and if I had grandchildren like these ungrateful mutts, I
would be bagging them alive. In truth this unhappy family deserve each
other's tormented misery.
Aurora's life is in shambles. Numerous failed marriages and affairs,
leads this unhappy come sleep with me' sixty year old, to hop into bed
with her much younger psychological counsellor (Bill Paxton). Things get
more tedious and fantastic when there is vying competition with Emma's
best friend (Miranda Richardson), a now wealthy divorcee who tries to
outshine and outdo Aurora in every way - including reading bed time
stories to the psychological counsellor.
Talk about unprofessional counsellor-patient conduct. Can you imagine,
Bill Paxton and Shirley Maclaine in bed doing it' several times over
and over - Ewwwwwhl! What was the director thinking - the turn on' of
the decade? Throw up.
Comment: Aurora - The Evening Star' - she who shines the longest and
burns the brightest', unfortunately doesn't also fizzle out the
fastest'.

Title
Review for Sliding Doors (1998)
Cast: Gwyneth Paltrow, John Lynch, John Hannah, Jeanne Tripplehorn,
Douglas McFerran, Zara Turner
Director: Peter Howitt
Producers: Phillipa Braithwaite, Sydney Pollack, William Hocberg
Screenplay: Peter Howitt
SLIDING DOORS, was a promising movie. It carried a high concept idea,
one that could have been quite poignant if done well. The question posed
is - would you life be markedly different, if just say you missed the
train? The movie explores these two different possibilities in the life
of a young woman Helen, played by the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow.
I'll tell you straight out why I didn't like the movie, and it is only
for one reason. It wasn't the plot, it certainly wasn't Gwyneth, it was
the fact that her two love interests are two of the biggest dorks this
side of London. Gerry (John Lynch), an aspiring writer is nothing more
that a conniving, weasly, greasy looking, two timer. He basically plays
Gwyneth's character for a fool, whilst having a hula of a time with the
bitchy Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). As for James (John Hannah), he's
married (but seperated), talks way, way too much, has a highly obnoxious
laugh and sings Father Abraham songs with his fellow boatsmen.
Throughout the entire movie, I kept asking myself this recurrent
question. What in the world is a woman as intelligent as Helen (Gwyneth
Paltrow), doing with these two boring men ????? I couldn't figure it
out. If only they carried presence, dignity, personality or
intelligence, it could have been so much more interesting.
Unfortunately, I'll have to put this movie to rest and only dream of
what could have been.

Title
Review for Full Monty, The (1997)
Cast: Robert Carlyle, Tom Wilkinson, Mark Addy, Steve Huison, Paul
Barber, Hugo Speer, Lesley Sharp, Emily Woof, Bruce Jones Director:
Peter Cattaneo Screenplay: Simon Beaufoy
It seems that unemployment in England has driven her unemployed subjects
to unusually high levels of creativity. First there was "Brassed Off"
where emotions are expressed through music, and now "The Full Monty",
where clothes come off, and women roll in for a peak at the real thing.
Well at least it's an honest living and a decent days wage.
These men come in all shapes and sizes, different ages and colour. It's
not necessary how you look or how you dance. It's who you are, and
whether you are capable of stripping in front of five hundred women AND
men. Imagine how difficult it must be to take your clothes off in front
of a single stranger, or having to piss in a urinal when there's
somebody looking over your shoulder. Well that's how it must feel when
six ordinary, unemployed men decide to strip for very different reasons.
Sure there's always the dole, but at least these men have the courage
to take action against their sinking fortunes.
The six male leads are relatively unknown to the general public, but
successfully engage the audience's attention with their problems and
failures. Director Peter Cattaneo has succeeded with the "Full Monty",
where "Striptease" and "Show Girls" both failed. It carries both heart
and humour, and enough male dignity to keep one's head high even when
the "Full Monty" is finally revealed. What the US of A needs is a full
scaled reply to unemployment. With perhaps the likes of say Tom Cruise,
Harrison Ford, Brad Pitt, Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves and Richard
Gere doing their bit with "The Full Monty" - the proceeds would
naturally go towards feeding hungry mouths.

Title
Review for Leave It to Beaver (1997)
Cast: Cameron Finley, Christopher McDonald, Janine Turner, Erik von
Detten, Grace Phillips, Adam Zolotin
Director: Andy Cadiff
Screenplay: Brian Levant & Lon Diamond
Having to grow up with great paternal expectations hanging over your
shoulder sure dampens ones creativity and self-initiative. I'm sure
anyone who has lived the experience, will acknowledge that they were
once little boys with impossible-to-please-fathers, who were once little
boys with impossible-to-please-fathers. So the merry-go-round keeps
going round until somewhere along the way, the chain breaks. The idea of
parenting is to guide, not take over your kid's life.
LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is best remembered as the popular 60's family series
that was full of morals and lessons learnt in childhood. It hits the
screens once again, this time the big screen. Beaver your average nice,
but non-too bright kid is trying to get a new bike of mum and dad. At
the same time he wants to make dad proud of him, by playing football and
wanting to be a doctor. Gosh, is that really what parents want for their
kids nowadays? Things come to a head when the bike gets stolen and
Beaver wants to drop out of the footy team  a mid-childhood crisis.
Having goals and expectations for your children is not necessarily a bad
thing, if it lies in your child's best interests. However, there is a
tendency for some parents to selfishly live out their own private
agendas through their children. Parents are always looking for an excuse
to be proud of their child. Some will go over the top and murder their
daughter's rival for cheer group leading, but on the whole most parents
are down to earth enough to just brag about their kid's grades, sporting
achievements etc to relatives, friends or anyone with a ready ear.
So after scoring a goal, finding his bike and ending up inside a giant
coffee mug, Beaver finally gets his dad to accept him for who he is and
not for what he would like him to be. A more a less important message
for over achieving parents. Janine Turner (NORTHERN EXPOSURE) is an
unusual choice for Mrs Cleaver. She vacuums in pearls, her hair is
permed and dyed blonde, and she carries a perpetual smile on her face.
Somehow, beneath this veneer of maternal perfection, one can see her
silently screaming to be released from her apron string bondage. Mr
Beaver (Christopher McDonald) seems grumpier than in the 60's series,
whilst Wally Cleaver (Eric von Detten) seems an overall nicer older
brother.
LEAVE IT TO BEAVER is not amongst the best children films released these
holidays, but at least it has something important to say about
parenting.

Review for Assignment, The (1997)
Director:  Christian Duguay
Writer:  Dan Gordon, Sabi H. Shabtai
Cast: Aidan Quinn, Ben Kingsley, Donald Sutherland, Claudia Terri,
Lilliana Duguay
Ever noticed how some Hollywood ideas are always released in pairs i.e.
last years DANTE'S PEAK and VOLCANO, this years upcoming ARMEGADDON and
DEEP IMPACT. So it is with THE ASSIGNEMENT and THE JACKAL. Both stories
are about the same man, but each takes a very different approach.
Needless to say, I detested the one starring Bruce Willis and Richard
Gere, for more reasons than can possibly fill this review. As for THE
ASSIGNMENT starring Aidan Quinn, Ben Kingsley and Donald Sutherland 
well it's marginally better. The subtle difference is that one actually
bored me to tears and the other was much better than I had expected.
Much of the thrill of this movie, comes from the fact that the villain
and hero are played by the same actor (Quinn). In general, I don't fancy
the idea off look-a-likes confusing the elements of plot, but the final
twist towards the end is reliant on this fact alone.
So who is this man they call The Jackal' anyway? From daily news we
know he was a ruthless assassin, now serving time in a French prison.
This movie postulates how the most illusive terrorist of the twentieth
century came to be captured.
An American naval captain, Annabel Ramirez (Quinn), carries an uncanny
resemblance to this criminal. He is convinced by the CIA (Sutherland)
and the Israelis (Kingsley) to embark on a most convoluted plot to bring
down The Jackal'. This involves a series of gruelling training
exercises and sexual reprogramming to recreate the personality of the
man he is hunting. It gets to a stage where the pleasant Ramirez begins
detesting himself for becoming the Jackal.

Title
Review for Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)
Cast: Pierce Brosnan, Jonathan Pryce, Michelle Yeoh, Teri Hatcher, Gotz
Otto, Judi Dench, Desmond Llewelyn, Samantha Bond, Geoffrey Palmer, Joe
Don Baker Director: Roger Spottiswoode Screenplay: Bruce Feirstein
In the secret place of every man's heart, there lies a fantasy to be
perfection incarnate. In this fantasy the gentleman is a distinguished
soldier, a polished diplomat and an insatiable lover all rolled into
one. Immaculately clothed, ingeniously armed this warrior/lover creation
of Ian Fleming emerges once again after forty year of immortal
existence. Bring out the caviar, serve the champagne and watch the
spectacular display of destructive fireworks caused by Bond, Mr James
Bond.
It must be Bond's legacy to taste every woman from every walk of life.
If women could be compared to fine food, then my favourite Bond dishes
would be the delectable Honey Ryder submerged in layers of chocolate,
the Pussy Galore dipped in whipped cream, and Alotta Fagina with Alotta
Fagina - sorry that's a missing page from my Austin Powers cook book.
Like any good Bond film, this movie begins with the usual culinary
delights of finger food appetisers, before moving on to the spicy main
course. Terri Hatcher, better know as Superman's girl, tries her hand
with Bond, but only lasts a good undressing and bedding before being
murdered by a jealous husband. Having served the purpose of a cocktail,
the next course is the perfect example of exquisite oriental cooking,
the sort that wriggles and sizzles on your plate. I'm referring to the
sumptuous Michelle Yeoh. I freely admit to being a sucker for woman in
dark leathers with multitalented use of their hands and legs. I haven't
been this fascinated by the thinking/fighting woman well, since Bambi
and Thumper decided to go group action with Bond.
Once again, the question asked is how does this James (Pierce Brosnan)
compare with the other Bonds? Well he's not as manly as the heartthrob
Connery of the sixties, not as clean cut as the single dimensional Moore
of the seventies, and not as emotional as the ordinary Dalton of the
eighties. Brosnan is like the corporate executive of the nineties
deciding he needs a bit of Rambo in his life. So far he's doing a good
job interpreting the nineties Bond and should hold together for another
decade.
The plot surrounds events of news making ground breaking news. Evil
Media Mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathon Pryce) has decided that there is no
better news than bad news, and the best publicity usually comes from
oneself. Why wait for heaven and hell to arrive when you can create it
yourself. Now that the Soviet Union is no longer considered a serious
threat to world peace, the Chinese have become unwitting victims for
beginning WWIII with the British. Carver's plan basically surrounds the
use of stealth boats downing naval vessels of both sides and
antagonising all concerned.
In summary, TOMORROW NEVER DIES is what every Bond film should be. A
mixture of light-hearted humour sprinkled over the noisy, undertones of
special effect driven action, with a coating of classy babes to help the
food go down with as little indigestion as possible. My compliment to
Cubby Brocolli for once again bringing as back the Bond that every man
wants to be.

Title
Review for Before Sunrise (1995)
Cast: Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy Director: Richard Linklater Producer:
Anne Walker-McBay Screenplay: Richard Linklater and Kim Krizan
Cinematography: Lee Daniel
An American boy meets a French girl on a train in Vienna. They 'connect'
and decide that they must do several things before sunrise.
Talk a lot. Childhood dreams. Grandmother's ghosts. Visit a graveyard.
Smile and laugh. Watch a birth dance performed by a non pregnant woman.
Men vs. women. Read a love poem. Dance at a night club. Change scenery
on numerous occasion (train, bridge, park, fountain, side street, river,
back to the train) to give their romantic chit chat some dimension.
Now for something to help pass the time. The Time's special edition on
Princess Di looks interesting. Could it really be a conspiracy to escape
media attention when there's a body in the casket already?
Now for a cup of Milo, and a browse through the sports results on the US
open. I say Chang in five come Sunday.
The article on Type I insulin diabetes mellitus looks interesting in
this months issue of 'Current Therapeutics'. Now if they could only
prevent the destruction of those beta islet cells.
My goodness they're shagging in the park. When did this eventuate with
so much conversation? REWIND.
Yep. They sure are shagging in the park. Something about how she doesn't
want a one night stand, so he doesn't force the issue. She wants it to
be meaningful, so he pretends to understand by leaning over her. She
tries hard to resist, but we now she's playing a game, so they do it.
The proof - lots of rolling about on the grass, and the next morning
she's topless (singlet gone but dress still there).
Gosh. How very shallow. So much focus on conversation and relationship
building, then a sudden burst of eroticism. It's not as if the viewers
paid to watch a movie called 'Before Sunrise' just so they could see two
kids jerk off. Honestly, whoever wrote this silly script, why bother
going to such enormous lengths to build intellectual companionship
(which will deepen with time), and then confuse the issues with a single
night of gratuitous sex in the park? Believe me, no one talks as
intelligently or fluently as this unless they've memorised a script.
Anyway, Ethan Hawke's goatee is annoying and sleazy. The French girl
giggles and laughs like a French Girl. Some sensible advice. This boy
and girl should not be wandering the streets of Vienna at such a late
hour; but be sound asleep under the watchful eyes of their parents.
Silly romantic notions like this movie suggest, will only lead to a
longer list of missing persons on the trans-continental Eurorails.

Review for Vita č bella, La (1997)
Cast: Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio Cantarini, Sergio
Bustric, Horst Buchholz.
Screenplay: Robert Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami.
Producers: Elda Ferri and Gianluigi Braschi.
Director: Roberto Benigni
Don't let the following quirks of this review, fool you into believing
that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love. But one
can see the humour of Roberto Benigni when you see that 
Life is beautiful, even though I'm a short, ugly looking man with an
obnoxious laugh. Life is beautiful even though I haven't amounted to
much in life, except working out the finer intricacies of waitering. I'm
a lucky sort of a guy, especially when a beautiful woman strips away my
venner of superficiality to find a new age,sensitive guy with the
biggest heart in the entire world underneath - Life is Beautiful! I'm a
Jew, but Life can still be beautiful. The Nazis put me in a
concentration camp, but Life is still beautiful. I love my son very much
and that's what matters, and that's what makes Life beautiful. My
ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a
concentration camp is somewhat beautiful? I get shot for my efforts and
the woman I love, but hey that's life and that's still a beautiful thing
- so by Jove don't give me any crap about it!
By far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves
every nomination and award that it has achieved. Well done, there should
be more film directors and actors like you Roberto Benigni.

 From 'The Forgotten Annals of Rare Princesses'  by T.M.T. Voon.
So the question which is nicely posed to the viewer throughout the movie
is - Is Princess Caraboo, who has been accepted whole heartedly into
England's highest social circles, truly a princess of the bluest blood,
or is she merely the greatest con artist of her time? I'll give you a
clue below.
"Give me a turban, or give me a name. Paint a tattoo on my arse and you
can call me Prince Voondavoodaloo. I speak no English, or so I claim,
but I can say 'Attoya Matoolie Estromish Zardoo', which in my language
means 'God Be With You'. So throw me a party, or show me around. I know
how to have a good time, all I have to do is smile. I am a prince of the
truest blood, or so I claim. I am after all the prince of my heart."
 From 'The Forgettable Annals of Jerky Princes' by T.M.T Voon
As a film directed towards the family audience, I would say this works.
Not a great fan of any film which claims to be a family film, I have to
say that this film isn't bad; and since it brought smiles to my parent's
faces, who give it two thumbs up, I'll refrain from being nasty.
What we have here is a tale of unprecedented imagination. Also a tale of
self-belief. Like 'The Little Princess' which claims that every little
girl is as special as a princess, so 'Caraboo' follows this same message
to the end. For those of you who get a little sensitive over gender
equality and equal opportunities, and since the rec.arts.movies.reviews
seems to be overpopulated by politically conscious males, yes, every
little boy can also be a prince.

Review for Seven Years in Tibet (1997)
Cast: Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, Jamyang Wangchuk, Lhakpa Tsamchoe, B.D.
Wong, Mako, Danny Denzongpa, Victor Wong, Ingeborga Dapkunaite Director:
Jean-Jacques Annaud Screenplay: Becky Johnson based on the novel by
Heinrich Harrer
In that distant far off 全hangri-La' known as Lhasa,
Lived a monk with a music box known as the Dalai Lama.
He carried a love for worms and picture theatres,
And a thirst for knowledge about how the world works around us.
>From the midst of troubled Europe on the brink of worldly war,
Journeyed a fair hair adventurer with wife and child unwanted.
Escaping the strife of Nazi patriotism, angry and bitter,
Come to conquer a Himalayan mountain with virgin snow uncharted.
An Avalanche stops this most noteworthy climb,
And flings the man into a British prison bind.
Escape he does to roam the winter wild,
Short on food, with scarcely little water.
With frost bitten feet and bruised from bandit bashings,
This lost soul somehow finds his way to 全hangri-La'.
Starved and hungered,
Made to feed on the scraps of dogs,
Pity falls on those in greatest need.
Favour finds its way to the highest seat,
With shelter and clothes made to fit this European man in deed.
Love finds its way in the strangest place,
Whether tinker, tailor, soldier, spy,
I think love falls on the one with the prettiest eyes.
Behold two men in love and only one object of affection,
Methinks the winner is not the one with the fairest complexion.
Friendship grows from the roughest ground,
This young man shunned once to often in love,
Finds a friend in the young Dalai of Lamas.
So from this strange company of men,
One finds healing and the other information.
So I wish this tale could have a happy end,
But alas the Opera continues as China forces Tibet to be her concubine.
So methinks it's time for a formal separation,
But I think I had better leave this issue in the hands of the United
Nations.

Review for Doctor Dolittle (1998)
Directed by Betty Thomas.
Cast Eddie Murphy, Ossie Davis, Oliver Platt, Richard Schiff, Kristen
Wilson, Jeffrey Tambor
Written by Hugh Lofting, Nat Mauldin, Larry Levin
There's probably one thing that annoys me more than a rude, verbose,
hyperactive Eddie Murphy, and that would be  smart-mouthed, lip
malleable, talking animals. So, I had every reason to dislike this movie
from the outset, but instead I decided to sit back and re-evaluate my
life. After momentarily journeying to the depths of my soul and
relieving myself of the hate I bore for the ones named Murphy and
talking animals, I decided to enjoy the holiday spirit of the movie.
This movie is great for the kids. They love animals and they love
animals that talk, even more. Eddie is well behaved, and if I had to
choose between watching him as a smart mouthed BEVERLY HILLS COP, or as
a disillusioned MD who can talk to animals  MD wins hands down. The
animals are o.k. Yes they generate great one liners, with style and
human expression thanks to Jim Henson and co.
In the opening credits of the movie, it is stated that the movie is
based on Hugh Lofting's children's books of the same name. To clarify
this further, I will say that they are only very, very, very loosely
based on the novels. In fact the only thing vaguely resembling Lofting's
characters is the name Dolittle and of course the talking animals.
The plot is simple. Dolittle (Murphy) has the gift of talking to
animals. A gift that he has repressed since childhood, and only recently
been awoken since hitting a stray dog with his car. After this, the
Doctor mostly psychologically counsels animals about their bowel habits,
sex life and numerous psychiatric disorders. By keeping the plot simple,
and the focus on the talking animals and away from Eddie Murphy, the
children will remain delighted and 20th Century Fox has another
potential box office hit on their hands.

Title
Review for Excess Baggage (1997)
Cast: Alicia Silverstone, Benicio Del Toro, Christopher Walken, Jack
Thompson, Harry Connick Jr., Nicholas Turturro, Michael Bowen Director:
Marco Brambilla Screenplay: Max D. Adams and Dick Clement & Ian La
Frenais
Ever gone on a holiday and suddenly realised that you took only enough
underwear for three days, but you really needed a weeks worth.
Fortunately most holiday retreats have a customer laundry and shops for
the accidental tourist with missing underwear in action. However, in a
movie like EXCESS BAGGAGE where do you turn when the most important
contents, like underwear, suddenly go missing? Missing elements like
passionate romance, witty dialogue, suspenseful action or light hearted
comedy? Surely there must be something worth wearing in this Alicia
Silverstone package. I remain sadly silent. It's like I suddenly woke up
one morning and discovered the world was naked, and I was the only one
wearing clothes and when I took my clothes off, there was nothing to see
underneath.
Like most young men who first saw Ms Silverstone in her starring role as
"Cher" in CLUELESS, I soon fell in love with her lips and the rest of
her body. I know sadly admit that the grand delusion of puppy love is
finally shattered by a ton of excess baggage. The basis of the story is
not too uncommon as wealthy rich girl tries to get attention from Papa
by staging her own kidnapping. She has nothing to complain about except
for the fact that her father has not given her the attention she needed
as a child, but then neither has half the human race. So I do not
sympathise entirely with her situation. However, this is not the
problem. The problem like most bad movies, is what you actually decide
to do with the material.
With romantic comedies, I'm not sure whether it is more difficult to
generate romance or comedy. Having both is like striking gold.
Unfortunately the romance factor in this movie doesn't take off at all.
It becomes hard to believe that this poor little rich girl falls in love
with a scruffy car thief who accident steals the car with her in the
boot. I haven't seen Mr Benicio Del Toro (car thief) act before, but I
think "subzero personality" best describes his character. He carries
that dark fazed look of a drug junky, and mumbles his lines with the
slurred, droll manner of a stoned alcoholic. My question is - is it all
an act or is it really him? If so, is this the sort of character that
attracts girls nowadays? The only reason I'm asking is because this
movie wants us to get all warm and fuzzy when he breathes down Ms
Silverstones neck after downing a bottle of Jack Daniels; and Ms
Silverstone's character isn't much better.
As for the comedy, I don't remember laughing once or hearing anybody
else laugh for that matter. The saddest factor is that Ms Silverstone is
out of her prime material. Gone is that innocent sweet girl that stole
the hearts of a generation of men. So perhaps it will take another
movie, or several more, before I fall in love again.

Review for Midsummer Night's Dream, A (1999)
Cast: Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci,
Calista Flockhart, Anna Friel, Christian Bale, Dominic West, David
Strathairn, Sophie Marceau.
Screenplay: Michael Hoffman, based on the play by William Shakespeare.
Producers: Leslie Urdang and Michael Hoffman.
Director: Michael Hoffman.
For those who have little idea of what this movie is about, it's about
Shakespeare. Don't be like the poor gentleman behind me who paid good
money for a seat, probably drawn in by names like Pfeiffer and
Flockhart, only to be disappointed that they are speaking in a different
language. That's right. It takes a good fifteen to twenty minutes for
the human brain to comprehend that this is actually English - the
smarter, more poetic sort. But once the brain has rearranged several
pathways of functioning, Shakespeare becomes understandable and that's
when you begin to realise, what a truly great artist he was.
 Problems  the setting, the costumes and the actors all seem slightly
out of place neither looking Greek, or as if the names Helena, Hermia,
Demetrius and Lysander truly belong to them.
 Humour. Lots of naked butts and sex references. The grade six kids who
were sent in by their parents, no doubt for the educational experience,
ended up giggling whenever bare flesh flashed their way. Shakespeare was
no doubt ahead of his time. The Fairy Queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer)
gets laid by an Ass (not arse), and when her husband Oberon finally
breaks the spell (in forgiveness), they get laid next to the Ass. This
says a lot about taking animals to bed. There is also implied group sex
when the love quadrangle of Helena (Calista Flockhart), Hermia (Anna
Friel), Lysander (Dominic West) and Demetrius (Christian Bale), all have
a mud fight\bath before waking up stripped naked (by the fairies) and in
each others arms. No one has a knack for sex and comedy like
Shakespeare.
Of note is Michelle Pfeiffer, who is devastatingly beautiful as the
fairy Queen. She has not exuded this much sensuality into a role since,
Lady Hawk'. Kevin Klein makes a great Ass, and Rupert Everett flaunts
his male form about no doubt to entice both sexes as Oberon the fairy
King (pun intended). Calista Flockhart takes her Ally McBeal into
Helena. This is Shakespeare and this is a love-story born from the heart
of a warm midsummer's night. When you awake the next morning, you will
wonder to yourself, was it all a wonderful dream or did you really have
sex with an Ass.

Title
Review for Flipper (1996)
Cast: Paul Hogan, Elijah Wood, Chelsea Field, Jonathan Banks, Isaac
Hayes, Jessica Wesson, Jason Fuchs Director: Alan Shapiro Screenplay:
Alan Shapiro
"I've lost all of my baby fat, but I'm still cute, so love me anyway.'
It must be hard for any child star (Wood) to enter that difficult period
of our lives known as adolescence. The teenage years are hard enough as
it is without the unnecessary attentions of fame and fortune, too easily
endowed on anyone who can help Hollywood' earn a quick buck.
Turn on 'Water Music' meditate on dolphins, and watch your blood
pressure drop to safe limits. Out with the anti-hypertensive medication,
and in with 'Flipper'. This dolphin befriends a lonely, angry young boy,
detects bins of chemical wastes underwater, and cons children out of
free fish and pocket money. Now where can I find myself a pet fish like
this? (Ooops, I mean mammal).
Where we live the sun always shines, the surf is always blue, the
natives are always friendly, and Uncle Porter's (Hogan) speciality is
'toast ala welding torch'. Ahhh, sounds like a good place to retire.
Fresh air, the sound of the sea, endless summer, and don't forget the
sun tan lotion.
So come join 'Flipper' in yet another adventure where he battles the bad
guys of the sea. The environmentally unfriendly fisherman who shoots
dolphins and poisons the ocean floors; the giant hammerhead shark who
has an acquired taste for seagulls and little boys. At the end of the
day I didn't really enjoy the movie, but it did remind me of a much
needed holiday.
Comment: Not 'Waterworld', but certainly more intelligent.

Review for Shakespeare in Love (1998)
Cast: Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Ben
Affleck, Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench.
Screenplay: Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard.
Producers: Donna Gigliotti, David Parfitt & Harvey Weinstein and Edward
Zwick & Marc Norman.
Director: John Madden
Don't let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of
William Shakespeare. No one will truly understand the heart and soul of
this man except through his work, and this movie makes a vain attempt at
that. Any moves to glamorise' his life, which Hollywood has an annoying
tendency to do, will only subtract from his achievement rather than
expound on his greatness. This movie about his life, although well
written, puts too much make-up on a man whose life was probably more
pork and potatoes, rather than lobster and champagne.
Oh well, let's fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a
flirtatious play-write, who falls in love with a beautiful woman
(Gwyneth Paltrow) and from her inspiration, several plays develop -
Romeo and Juliet', and The Twelfth Night'. It is easier for me to
believe that he had a wet dream and that's how all his plays develop,
but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama. But I guess my
version probably wouldn't draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen. So is
there any justification in romanticising the man Shakespeare, when all
we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul. I think not.
As for the Oscars were they deserved by this movie? I think not. In many
aspects Private Ryan' and Life is Beautiful' were far superior movies,
but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning
an Oscar, as time and again, for reasons unexplained, an undeserving
movie will win the accolade. Another sore point is the fact that Gwyneth
won the best female lead, over a more polished Cate, but I guess if you
go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being
hospitalised - people will start feeling sorry for you.

Review for Scream (1996)
Cast: Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Courteney Cox, David

Ring, RING. Ring, RING.
'Hello?' Drew asks.

(Put the phone down again bitch, and I'll shove pizza down your scrawny
little throat!)
'Who are you?' Whimper, whimper.
(The pizza man. I told you already. So tell me what is your favourite
pizza?)
'Look this isn't funny. My boyfriend's coming over anytime now. If you
don't leave me alone you'll have to deal with him.'
(Look outside the window)
'Why?'
(Just do it!)
'SCREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!'
(So tell me, what is your favourite pizza?)
'Leave him alone. What do you want?'
(I want to play a game)
'What game?'
(Answer the question correctly, and I promise that I won't drop the
200,000 pizzas on your boyfriend's head)
'Okay, I'll play just don't hurt him.'
(Good then answer the question, what's your favourite pizza?)
'I only eat Vegetarian.'

one correctly, he gets to live.)
'Noooooooo. That's not fair.'

the main ingredient would be chicken feet.)
'That's not fair. That was a trick question!'
(Bye, bye boyfriend.)
'No. SCREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!'
 From 'The Very Private Telephone Conversations' of TMT Voon.
I've never quite liked horror movies. So I am glad I watched this
particularly movie on video. You can tone down the screams with the
volume control; and the blood bath of butchering frenzy is nicely
reduced to a red fuzz on the screen with the fast forward button. I
openly, and unashamedly admit, that I have never watched any classic
horror movies like 'Friday the Thirteenth', 'Nightmare on Elm Street',
'Halloween', 'The Shining', 'Edward Scissorhands' (it's a joke) etc etc.
And I have no great plans to watch any either. Excessive bloodiness is
best left in abattoirs, and off the big screen.
However, I can say that the director Wes Craven, a name which inspires
thoughts of shiny metal blades and ripping skin, has made a 'horror'
flick much more acceptable by throwing in elements of a
mystery/thriller, to balance out the unpleasant elements of pure horror.
He has also carefully chosen a cast i.e. Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Drew
Barrymore names which are not synonymously linked with horror, to help
draw a more general audience into that acquired taste for blood.
I have to admit that I thought the serial killer was the 'boyish'
policeman from the word go. Boy was I wrong! I guess the bad hunch was
an unfortunate after effect of watching 'Primal Fear'. Although the plot
is unbelievable, it will keep you guessing right to the very end, and
that's what any movie really needs to do if it is to get a favourable
response from it's viewers.

Review for Career Girls (1997)
Cast: Katrin Cartlidge (Hannah), Lynda Steadman (Annie), Kate Byers,
Mark Benton (Ricky), Joe Tucker (Adrian) Director: Mike Leigh Producer:
Simon Channing-Williams Screenplay: Mike Leigh
When Annie was young she used to speak like this:
"I study psychology you know you know and I got this rash on my face
that the boys don't find attractive I don't know why please Miss Bronte
Miss Bronte tell me why I have this awful rash open page 183 throw your
finger to the winds of fate and it lands on the word 'Heathcliff' I knew
it was a stupid and dumb thing to do you know I did you know I did so
let's try it with sex anyway Miss Bronte Miss Bronte will I ever get
laid open page to 96 it's an empty page damn book as if it had anything
good to say anyway about whether I get laid or not sorry Ricky I like
you but not in that sort of a way but I have this fantasy about men
watching me when I do it do you mind Adrian can we do it can we?"
When Hannah was young she was one very angry lass:
"Stupid bloody idiot I'll hit you I will I really will so shut up and do
what I say I'm in charge here so don't F'k with me or I'll bloody hit
you I will I'll do what I please so Miss Bronte Miss Bronte I'll do as I
please so listen Ricky you stupid imbecile don't F'k with me and stay
still Adrian you hear me I like being in control so that means I stay on
top you hear me."
You must be wandering at this moment whether Tim Voon has gone
temporarily insane, in my defence the above writing styles in some ways
embodies how this movie feels. Two students Annie and Hannah, who spent
four very troubled and confusing years of college life together, are
reunited six years later elegant, mature and much changed career women.
So during this weekend of memories, they talk, they dine and they meet
past loves and likes in what becomes a rediscovery of the past.
Some concepts I found difficult to palate include: trying to believe the
miraculous transformation of two despots like Annie and Hannah, into
comprehensible, sane and intelligent persons over a short period of
years. Also annoying, is the huge amount of flashbacks and flashforwards
between the past and present. This leaves the viewer temporarily stunned
by the large amount of friction, caused by the static past and fluid
present. However, if such characters do exist in the world, what better
than in a Mike Leigh movie.

Review for Horse Whisperer, The (1998)
Cast: Robert Redford, Kristin Scott Thomas, Sam Neill, Scarlett
Johansson, Dianne Wiest, Chris Cooper, Ty Hillman, Catherine Bosworth
Director: Robert Redford
Producers: Robert Redford, Patrick Markey
Screenplay: Richard LaGravenese, Eric Roth based on the novel by
Nicholas Evans
If you survived the 3 to 4 hour scenic footage of DANCES WITH WOLVES, or
the odd 2 to 3 hours of fly fishing in A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, then
theoretically, you should have no problems sitting through this 3 hour
version of horse taming and beautiful Montana countryside. This film,
will either bore you to tears from its opening moments, or have the
exact opposite effect, and draw you into an intriguing story that is
filled with passion and traumatised psyche.
After witnessing one of the most horrific horse accidents I have come
across in my small life span, I have vowed never to get on these great
four legged beasts, ever. This is a story of healing, not only for a
young girl, but also for her horse that sustained horrific wounds during
a most tragic accident. An initially, emotionally detached mother
(Kristin Scott Thomas), fights to bring her daughter out of a morbid
depression. She searches out a horse doctor (Robert Redford) in vain
hopes that healing the horse-gone-mad, will also bring inner healing to
her daughter. This is where THE HORSE WHISPERER comes into the picture,
with a mixture of patience, firmness and of course whispering, the
doctor lures the emotionally unbalanced beast back into sanity.
Robert Redford in jeans and cowboy hat, now rugged appearance is
everybody's version of a Marlborough man, except for the cigarettes. He
is filled this movie with what many people want on a sunny summer
holiday. A house by a stream, yummy country style cooking, the surrounds
of loving family, plenty of horse riding over lush plains, and of course
a love interest to share the experience with. Kristin Scott Thomas is
looking very much like Emma Thompson, with her hair cropped short and
trying to exude the emotions of a bitter, angry mother, who doesn't know
what she wants in life until she meets the Marlborough Man. Then the
ever-dependable Sam Neil is the overly understanding, sensitive husband
who knows when to give his wife room to choose.
Overall, a very good effort, and worth looking at if you ever wanted to
see a well made picture about horses, emotional healing and romance.

Review for Kissing a Fool (1998)
Cast: David Schwimmer, Jason Lee, Mili Avital, Bonnie Hunt, Vanessa
Angel, Kari Wuhrer
Director: Doug Ellin
Producers: Andrew Form, Rick Lashbrook, Tag Mendillo
Screenplay: James Frey and Doug Ellin
Another day, another poorly made David Schwimmer movie. He ends up
making a fool of himself, but that's becoming a usual trend in his
movies. If you're the kind of person who likes David Schwimmer in
FRIENDS or who appreciated his performance in THE PALLBEARER, then you
may be able to tolerate this movie. Since I am neither, I will stand
back and be totally biased and say this was an awful movie.
Ever notice that David Schwimmer always carries the same persona in all
his acting roles. He just can't seem to get out of that annoying puppy
dog look, feel sorry for me,  duh  droll-sort-of-voice which makes
many women fall for him??? He's the kind of actor, that women probably
like to mother in real life, but has drawbacks in limiting your choice
of movie roles after awhile. Anyway enough about Schwimmer, before my
blood pressure soars through the roof. Let's just say that KISSING A
FOOL is marginally better than most of his co-star
FRIENDS-Hollywood-efforts, but that doesn't really say much considering
their poor track record.
The plot basically involves two best friends, Max Abbit (Schwimmer) and
Jay Murphy (Jason Lee) and how they end up falling in love with the same
woma, Samantha Andrews (Mili Avital). The story is told through the lips
of the ever-charming Bonnie Hunt, and the idea is to semi-guess what
happened and who ends up with whom in the end. It's all very
predictable, but I'm not sure how many guys will really appreciate their
best-friends ex-girlfriends after knowing how intimate they were in bed?
Can you still be best friends after this? In Hollywood you can, and with
a tremendous about of forgiving, forgetting and reading  all ends up
well in the rather foolish world of David Schwimmer.

Title
Review for Winter Guest, The (1997)
Cast: Phylida Law, Emma Thompson, Gary Hollywood, Arlene Cockburn,
SheilaReid, Sandra Voe, Douglas Murphy, Sean Biggerstaff
Director: Alan Rickman
Screenplay: Sharman Macdonald and Alan Rickman
I cannot adequately express how disappointed I feel after watching THE
WINTER GUEST. I had expected great things from Alan Rickman in this his
debut as a director. Let's face it, he's a better actor. Secondly,
whatever persuaded Emma Thompson, an Academy Award Winner for best
screen adaptation, to except a very poor adaptation of stage play to
screen play carrying the same name???
Yes I hated, I greatly detested, THE WINTER GUEST from the instant that
Phyllida Law opened her mouth. Perhaps, her character is meant to be
that of a nagging old bit'hmm, but to the extent that it cat whips the
viewer's nerves raw? Several people walked out early when they saw where
this movie was heading. I should have done the same and got my money
back, but unfortunately I don't do it on principle. One kept expecting
the old crone to drop dead, with the fake Parkisonian tremor an all, but
no she has to live right to the end and say My name is Elspeth', like
it's something profound and the audience is meant to understand what she
means by it. I couldn't, so I put it down to early onset dementia. She
could have done the audience a favour and walked out onto the frozen sea
and never returned.
Other annoying factors is how stagey the entire movie feels, even though
most of the sets are outdoors. There is also a problem with the script
sounding artificial, Shakespearan' without the heart of the great poet.
The actors speak, but most of the time what they rant about is
inconsequential, empty and even baffling. There's almost never more than
two people in a scene, it's like no one lives in this town except for
eight people split into pairs. Other problems concern two boys who find
condoms and kittens on the beach, before deciding to rub deep heat on
their dicks. Every second word spoken is a swear word, and they're only
ten! You may expect it from PULP FICTION, but not from kids! Then there
are two young people experimenting with their bodies, wanting to have
sex but don't because there's a feeling the dead boy's father is in the
room. Before we meet two old ladies, one screaming I'm going to fall,
I'm going to fall.' No doubt she is having a panic attack, but hey she's
on a bus there is no where to fall! Finally, Phyllida Law and Emma
Thompson, mother and daughter, I just hope there relationship in real
life is not as awful as it is on screen. There is enough nagging in this
movie to make one grow old in their seat.
This was an awful script and an awful movie with little resolution of
the presenting problems, leaving the viewer (myself) very angry and
dissatisfied.

Review for Avengers, The (1998)
Cast:  Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent.
Screenplay:  Don Macpherson.
Producer:  Jerry Weintraub.
Director:  Jeremiah Chechik.
This is the worst movie I've viewed so far in 98. THE AVENGERS = silly =
man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil
scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil, Sir August De
Wynter wearing kilt. The question is what could have gone wrong with a
potentially great idea with big name cast? The same question was
probably asked of last year's stinker BATMAN and ROBIN. I feel the
production got a little too smug, the script a little to smart and
direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided
together to form a movie.
My greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry
between Emma Peel and John Steed (Thurman and Fiennes)  something that
was a vital element of the 60's TV serial of the same name. The dialogue
goes on and on about tea and other finer British perks, but does not
allow much room for character development and interaction, except to
perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves. One wonders why the dynamic pair
bother kissing in the end except for pure English formality. Connery as
Sir August, does not fair better than Thurman or Fiennes. His dialogue
is as erratic as stormy weather, mostly embarrassing and poor quality.
If there is a movie you would prefer never to see, I believe THE
AVENGERS would be a good choice. For one thing, you will not have to
witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names
that is associated with the title. I cannot understand how something so
poorly produced could have been released, but I put it down to one of
those freak happenings in nature, like lightning you can't see it coming
until it hits you.

Review for Blues Brothers 2000 (1998)
Cast: Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, Joe Morton, J. Evan Bonifant, Nia
Peeples, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, B.B. King
Director: John Landis
Screenplay: Dan Aykroyd and John Landis
Music: Paul Shaffer U.S.
No sequel, can hope to bare, an inherent a cult classic as THE BLUES
BROTHERS, as brilliant a heir. There was something unique about the time
it was made, in the era of the early 80's, when the world was crying out
for something loud, original and immensely destructive to hit the
screens. The reply to this call of the wild was of course, THE BLUES
BROTHERS.
It is almost 20 years since the original hit the screens, but the world
is not howling for the likes of BLUES BROTHERS 2000. Why? Maybe it's
just the way of the times. This isn't an awful movie by any means, it
just lacks that cheeky sparkle of John Belushi. Dan Ackroyd is back, a
lean-n-mean, slim-n-trim, Elwood Blues. He's good and this is probably
his best role for some time, but he cannot carry this movie alone. John
Goodman, is Mighty Mack who sings the blues true, but even he cannot
fill the shoes of the missing Belushi. The other newcomer is a
twelve-year-old orphan, Buster Blues (J. Bonifant), who plays the
harmonica like mother's milk, but really he should be sucking on a
breast instead of hanging with the dudes.
Look, if you're here to listen to the music, then you've come to the
right cinema. Let's face it, there's no one who sings, plays, thinks
blues better than the likes of Aretha, James, Eric, Stevie, Charlie,
Billy, Lou, Joshua, Travis, Jimmie, Wylie, Grover, Paul, Steve, Donald,
Murphy, Lou, Tom, Allan, Matt and the BLUES BROTHERS, all jamming
together for a grand finale. Well, that's a dream come true for lovers
of soul.  However, for the rest of the world, this is not the ecstatic
reunion of home coming queens. So perhaps in another twenty years, there
may be a more successful resurrection of BLUES BROTHERS 2020  something
more in keeping with Beverly Hills 90210?

Title
Review for Ed Wood (1994)
Starring: Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia
Arquette, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray. Screenplay: Scott Alexander and
Larry Karaszewski. Director: Tim Burton.
Ed Wood is a man with an impossible dream, a Don Quixote of the movies.
This man made movies that nobody wanted to see because they were darn
awful. He is a man with a childlike naivety about life and movies, who
is unable to see how bad his productions actually were. Despite his
continued failures, he persists with his dream to make pictures that he
wanted to see. To become the Orson Welles of sci-fi\ horror flicks. One
cannot help but admire his persistence and dedication, but at the same
time be dismayed and heartbroken at his inability to learn from his
mistakes.
He is a man with all heart and vision. A dreamer who is driven by his
great passion and love for film making; but somehow, in the midst of his
shabby directing, all of his good intentions become blurred and
misplaced. That perhaps his talent lay not in the quality of his movies,
but in the heart of the man himself.
He is in essence a child with a dream. Despite numerous failures and
poor quality work, it is the dream which matters and that cannot be
taken from him. To remain true to himself and what he believed in.
Sensitive direction from Burton, and exceptional performances by Landau
and Depp.
Rating: A failed artist who would sing 'Don't cry for me Hollywood' on a
burning flying saucer over L.A.

Title
Review for Muppet Treasure Island (1996)
Those wonderful Muppets, they sing, they dance, they laugh and have a
lot more fun than a lot of humans -- gosh, I wish I was a Muppet, puppet.
The entire gang is back, they've converted Robert Louis Stevenson's
classic drama 'Treasure Island' into a musical comedy for children of
all ages.
They sing to the tune of Hans Zimmer, bleating out corny lyrics with
great enthusiasm; we actually get to see their feet when they dance;
they run about wildly beating each other up, with the occasional torture
scene for added variety. The kid Jim Hawkins sings with a high soprano
voice that makes me squirm; Long John Silver has a talking lobster, not
parrot, who is a proficient masochist; Kermit is the decent, lovable
captain and Miss Piggy is the Queen of the Island natives.
Have you ever seen a pig dressed in a tight, low cleavage, tiger skin
patterned cocktail dress? Well there's only one pig that can wear it
well, and believe me it clings marvellously to her, revealing all of her
feminine charms as she hangs upside down, dangling from a burning rope
tied to a tree over a cliff.
The thing I like about the Muppets is that they are never self conscious
about what they do. They are bold and daring without being crude or
obnoxious and are out to entertain with their easy going, frolicking
style.

Title
Review for Michael Collins (1996)
Cast: Liam Neeson, Aidan Quinn, Julia Roberts, Alan Rickman, Stephen
Rea, Ian Hart, Brendan Gleeson, Stuart Graham, Charles Dance Director:
Neil Jordan Screenplay: Neil Jordan
'An eye for an eye', and a dead cabinet minister for every year under
British Rule. That would mean 800 years, and a lot of dead ministers.
Not a good idea, but when desperation becomes despair, people will do
anything to succeed. I say 'turn the other cheek', but that's Tim Voon
speaking, not Michael Collins.
So the year is around 1915, and the republic of Ireland is having
problems establishing their independence. In the midst of this unsettled
times, rises a man by the name 'Michael Collins' who has a single,
focused vision for his nation - freedom! Rough around the edges, gritty
and plain spoken, this working class man, who in another time and place
could have been an ordinary husband, father and brother; employs
guerrilla tactics, to achieve his end. His philosophy summarised would
be, 'when no one listens, act.' Which in no uncertain terms means
assassinations and explosions, with the occasional innocent sacrificed
for the cause.
Liam Neeson, Scottish? Irish? English? Plays Collins down to a very fine
line of detailed particulars - of note is the Irish accent, which Aidan
Quinn and Julia Roberts have some difficulty mastering (they are after
all American). The director has captured the beauty of Ireland at its
grim best. Heavy, dark grey clouds, threatening to unleash its heavy
burden upon cold, colourless, slate roof tops and soot filled chimneys,
puffing smog upwards to the already overcast sky. Cobbled streets,
filled with the hustle, bustle, day to day mundane, chore-laden
pedestrian darting through and fro, avoiding the clip-clapper of horses
pounding their hooves on lifeless stone roads. Add to this the
rit-rattle of ricocheting bullets, tall smoking buildings, and distant
screams and you have for yourself a city in distress.
The result of these extreme measures, is history itself. The
establishment of the independent self-ruling state of Ireland. Not
independence, but neither is Australia (an ex-penal colony). The treaty
with the British, resulted in disunity and disharmony amongst the IRA,
with a resulting split; but Collins the soldier, a product of years of
resentment of English rule, knows when to stop fighting and regain his
humanity - to once again become Collins the working man.
This is not a particularly uplifting movie by any accounts, but it does
tell a story of an ordinary man forced to make difficult decisions under
very tense circumstances. Whether the details of the plot are accurate,
I do not know; but if in doubt, all you have to do is open the pages of
a British history book to find the name 'Michael Collins' included
within.
Comment: I say, passive resistance on this occasion for added variation.

Title
Review for Chamber, The (1996)
Cast: Chris O'Donnell, Gene Hackman, Faye Dunaway, Lela Rochon, Raymond
Barry, Bo Jackson, Robert Prosky Director: James Foley Screenplay:
William Goldman and Chris Reese based on the novel by John Grisham
I do not hold strong views on capital punishment either way. After
watching "The Chamber" I ended up disliking the offender so much so,
that I remained unsympathetic when the gas went up and his mouth began
to foam at the sides. "Dead Man Walking" is by far the best movie on the
subject. It left audiences hurting on the inside when the electrical
volts surged a minute past midnight. Then again "Dead Man" is also the
better adaptation and story.
Sam Cayhall (Gene Hackman) is the central character in this John Grisham
movie. This Klan member, terrorist and murderer now awaits execution on
death row. The situation becomes intense when the lawyer assigned to
defend Cayhall, is also his grandson Adam Hall (Chris O'Donnell).
However, little effort is made to help the audience understand a man
about to face death. The glib reason given to explain Cayhall's past
actions is that he is a product of years of hating, and three
generations of Klan influence. Will the audience empathise with him?
This man was a monster most of his life and remains a monster throughout
most of the movie. There is a sudden change of heart towards the end
when death perhaps makes him reflect on the error of his ways, but it
seems too little too late.
Director James Foley focuses mostly on the plot of this movie when he
should have perhaps focused more on the characters. "Dead Man Walking"
worked well because time was spent discovering the plight of the man who
walked the tight rope between life and death. In this movie both
grandfather and grandson waste precious minutes bickering with each
other instead of resolving the ghosts which haunt their past. So much so
that the missing years of their lives remain a mystery, as the door of
opportunity closes behind them.
Sam Cayhall is another detestable character in the long line of
detestable characters played by Gene Hackman and he's good at it. This
is not the long awaited defining movie for young Chris O'Donnell; better
luck next time. This is not the come back film for Faye Dunaway who
looks well beyond her years, which suits her character well. All in all,
by far the most disappointing of Grisham's movies.

Title
Review for Michael (1996)
Cast: John Travolta, William Hurt, Andie MacDowell, Robert Pastorelli,
Bob Hoskins, Jean Stapleton Director: Nora Ephron Screenplay: Nora
Ephron & Delia Ephron and Peter Dexter & Jim Quinlan
How does a man compete with an unkempt, invincible, chain-smoking
arch-angel "on heat"? Who also exumes charm, wit and pheromones
reminiscent of cookies, lavender and apple pie - how can a woman resist?
This multi-talented angel who defeated Lucifer on the heavenly
battlefields is currently on sabbatical from his Divine Armies. He has
decided to take one of his few RDOs on earth that each angel is
permitted within limits. Whilst here, Michael is on a mission outside
his usual tactical decision-makings of warfare, namely to practice his
other specialty of human match-making.
Sound odd? Well here's more quirkiness. This angel has claims to the
invention of "queues" for toilet usage, the institution of marriage and
the making of pie. The biblical sense of a good angel is also lost, when
this happy-go-lucky angel of the highest rank, hops into bed with the
first cute blonde to fly his way. His allure premotes helpless females
to adore and powerlessly surrender themselves to him. This is soon
followed by chaos on the dance floor tendered by raging male jealousy.
"Michael" carries a well written script at heart; professional rapport
and interaction between it's characters on screen; and a loveable dog
called "Sparky", who does a wonderful "Lazarus lives again"
impersonation towards the end. If you are expecting find a movie with a
"pocket full of mircales", don't expect too much from this worldy angel.

Title
Review for Up Close & Personal (1996)
Cast: Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert Redford, Joe Mantegna, Stockard
Channing, Kate Nelligan, Glenn Plummer, James Rebhorn Director: Jon
Avnet Screenplay: Joan Didion & John Gregory Dunne, suggested by the
book GOLDEN GIRL by Alanna Nash
Sleep your way to the top, but first, play hard to catch.
Tally Atwater (Pfeiffer) is an unknown reporter from a small town whose
dream is to become a 'star'. So she sends a fake resume to Warren
Justice (Redford), the director of a news broadcast in Miami and is
hired. At first she fetches his coffee and dry cleaning; then is given a
stint at being the weather girl before progressing to news reporting.
Pfeiffer is in my regards a good actress; however, she is just not
reporter material. The idea of dying her hair brunette to bring herself
credibility is as ludicrous as calling elephants pink, but what would I
know.
Redford becomes her teacher, mentor and lover. In a matter of years she
progresses to being a news anchor woman for the nations prime time news
station;  but this is not before she survives a prison riot where she is
locked up with angry, hostile, sex-deprived prisoners and comes through
unscathed!
Comment: She should have stayed the weather girl.

Title
Review for Wedding Singer, The (1998)
Cast: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Christine Taylor, Allen Covert,
Matthew Glave, Angela Featherstone, Alexis Arquette
Director: Frank Coraci
Producers: Robert Simonds, Jack Giarraputo
Screenplay: Tim Herlihy
There is something wonderfully, pleasant about THE WEDDING SINGER,
rarely found in the overly sophisticated romantic comedies of today.
Surprisingly, the acting leads are also played by two stars who are not
well known for their romantic touch. Adam Sandler is probably best known
as the golf abusing, amateur in HAPPY GILMORE. By putting away his usual
hysterical antics and allowing normality to take over, he not only
surprises the audience, but probably himself by creating a character
(Robbie Hart) that the audience cares about. Drew Barrymore, also
surprises us with a glowing smile that lights up the screen. She
delivers the overly sweetened dialogue, with such heartfelt sincerity
one almost believes her when she claims to dislike alcohol.
Set in the mid-80's and surrounding weddings (a popular Hollywood
theme), two people fall in love in the most unusual of circumstance.
Both are getting married to the wrong person. Robbie Hart (Sandler) is
left standing alone at the altar, when his bride fails to show up for
the occasion. This leaves him intensely depressed and deluded about life
and love. How can he live down the humiliation and go on being a wedding
singer? Julia Sullivan (Barrymore) has been waiting for two years for a
proposal from a boyfriend. Now that she has been finally asked, is this
the right man for her?
There is nothing sophisticated about the script or plot. Basically when
Robbie and Julia meet, the audience is shown why they are right for each
other. In this instance, screen chemistry is vital and both Sandler and
Barrymore deliver. The ending is a tad cliché, but the journey to reach
there is pleasantly entertaining, with enough 80's love tunes along the
way, to make this an enjoyable nostalgic piece.

Review for Secrets & Lies (1996)
Like most families we carry secrets which are best left behind cobwebs,
and we have told lies to help shield us from the painful truth. After
years of bitterness and distrust, and generation upon generation of ill
feeling and underlying falsities, a sense of brooding contempt and
dysfunction results.
This is the subject of this Mike Leigh movie, where the characters are
the movie itself. Imagine the scenario of a singe white middle-aged
Anglo-Saxon woman, living with her rebellious adult daughter. Her once
close, but now distant younger brother has been stolen away by a
seemingly cold and resentful sister-in-law. Leigh masterfully portrays
this sad and lonely woman, who has apparently failed in every aspect of
life, until a beautiful Anglo-African woman, refined and well achieved
in the field of optometry, enters her life. To her amazement she
discovers that this was the daughter who was given up for adoption many
years ago.
Don't snigger. If you dig around your past a little, you may
accidentally discover that your dad was an axe murderer, and your sister
is actually your mother. God forbid. Weirder things have happened. Muddy
waters are stirred, and chaos and confusion ignites in a household
already swamped with its fair share of bad weather. What initially
appears to be a natural disaster, becomes the catalyst that opens an old
festering wound in need of salting.
The climax amounts to a luncheon birthday party, where dusty rugs are
aired with more than a cough and a sneeze. With screaming, yelling,
crying and finally hugging, Mike Leigh bends this broken family back
into the twisted shape of a circle.

Review for Strike! (1998)
I had no idea that guys were referred to as hairy birds by girls (I can
only imagine why). More surprising still, I didn't think going co-ed was
such a big deal until I saw this movie. Being bred in an all boys
school, I can see the pros and cons of having the opposite around, but I
have no qualms either way.
So when Miss Goddards preparatory school for girls is being threatened
with the inclusion of boys, the loyalties of a group of close friends
become divided. On one side stands those immaculate virgins or those not
so immaculate, who are waiting to get laid by the first boy that comes
their way. In contrast there are those who do not want to be dominated
by boys (I'm not referring to lesbians), but believe that they should be
able to develop their aspirations in an environment free of the hairy
bird. So what follows is a high school romp not too dissimilar to the
Hayley Mills classic The Trouble With Angels'. Only this time, the plot
is to save the school from boys, and this involves getting them drunk,
getting them into bed and making them purge on stage. All very wicked
and light hearted fun.
The cast includes the familiar faces of Kursten Dunst (Little Women),
Gaby Hoffman (Now and Then) and Lynn Redgrave, as the seemingly cold
head mistress who has a heart beneath a stone exterior. I think this
should be considered a girl's movie, because I really can't see the
average, non-new age guy caring a toot about why a school shouldn't go
co-ed, when bigger things like tits and buns are at stake. Not for the
average Jo, but it will tickle the fancy of women liberationists.

Title
Review for Event Horizon (1997)
Cast: Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Kathleen Quinlan, Joely
Richardson,  Richard T. Jones, Jack Noseworthy, Jason Isaacs, Sean
Pertwee Director: Paul Anderson Screenplay: Philip Eisner
This movie works on pure horror and special effects. Both of which score
zilch when the mind is continually bombarded by wave upon wave of
shocking graphic gore. Is there a story line? Yes and no. YES, it is the
tale of an exploration ship known as the "Event Horizon", capable of
travel through a self-generated Black Hole. After being missing for
seven years, it reappears. Apparently the ship has been to Hell and
back, and NO it shouldn't have made a re-appearance.
There seems to be no limit to the human imagination when it comes to
horror. Sam Neil's face is mutilated to the point where Freddy Kruger
could be mistaken for Ronald McDonald in comparison. The simple scarred
face is no longer shocking enough. The eyes must also be gorged out for
added effect. Why not go all the way and remove the nose and tongue as
well. That way we would be spared the mumbo jumbo dialogue, and the
putrid stench that this movie creates. Let me mention a few horrific
moments of wasted movie time.
The "Silence of the Lambs" scene. This time the female gender is spared
the skinning process. Instead we have an average sized Caucasian male
who is skinned alive, before his carcass is poetically sprawled on the
butchering table. The rest of him dangles on a hook above the body,
giving "hung and dry" a new meaning.
The "Carrie" scene - a simple bucket of blood has become cliche. This
time we have a torrential river of crimson red, which floods and
submerges its characters. This is definitely what the blood bank needs.
Now for something not seen too often in Mainstream cinema. The "Body
Mutilation Orgy Scene", which was unsuspectingly thrown at the audience.
We have the naked, mutilated bodies of the missing crew running about
the ship, ripping each other's insides out; and I don't just mean the
eyes. I figured that this must have been the substitute sex scene, cause
the actors get to take their clothes off.
I won't forget to mention the "Blow the boy from the inside out" scene.
Where once again we watch a nice young man having his eyes and veins
explode in a pressure lock. There we go with the eyes again. Fetish,
fetish. fetish.
Now tell me, was I meant to enjoy the movie, or merely gag in the aisle
where I was sitting. I'm not a great connoisseur of food, but I guess
what is considered one man's vomit, is another man's creme de la creme.
Believe me, this movie leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth.
Are the actors worth mentioning? No. After portraying such used and
abused characters, whose bodies have no less been put through a meat
grinder, anonymity would be the kindest option. As for the director Paul
Anderson, enough with the exploding eyes and bloody torrents, we have no
wish to view the best left unseen effects of playing "Mortal Kombat" - a
much better movie if you ask me. If I wanted to scare myself, I could
have stayed at home and played "Peek-a-Boo" with a one year-old child.

Review for Cyborg 3: The Recycler (1995)
Certification:  USA:R  MPAA reasons. Rated R for non-stop violence, and
for some nudity.
Directed by Michael Schroeder
Cast :   Zach Galligan, Khrystyne Haje,  Richard Lynch, Andrew
Bryniarski, Malcolm McDowell, Michael Bailey Smith, Evan Lurie, Bill
Quin, Rebecca Ferratti, William Katt, Dave McSwain, Margaret Avery.
Written by Barry Victor, Troy Bolotnick
Enjoyment can be derived from what is considered B-Grade action
thrillers, with bad acting, embarrassing dialogue and numerous plot loop
holes.
The story revolves about the end of the 'Golden Age' between the humans
and cyborgs, in which humans now hunt the cyborgs for their spare parts.
The free cyborgs have hidden themselves in a secret location called
'Cyborg Town' which the bounty hunters are unable to find.
We are then introduced to Cash a female cyborg who is able to have
children, this is when the plot gets a bit hairy, and the laughs begin.
Supposedly her human lover\owner dies after successfully mating with
her. She is supposed to be an older model who has been around for awhile
so one wanders how well her eggs are holding out; she feels an energy
drain, wants an abortion, but then decides to keep the baby so goes
looking for a hermit scientist whilst being chased by human bounty
hunters who are intrigued by her spare parts.
If your mind isn't quite boggled by the complexities of this plot, mine
is.
Anyway, she finds the scientist, he takes her to Cyborg Town for
protection, opens her up like a dishwasher because her first trimester
is over, whips out what looks like a fly spray can which is supposedly
her womb, and passes it around to all the other cyborgs to have a good
gawk at in order to inspire a patriotic will to fight the human bounty
hunters who are breathing down their necks.
One wanders how the foetus is going to advance the next two trimesters
in something as small as that, or why the cyborgs, who are made
completely of machinery are so afraid of the humans. Whatever happened
to the precedence set by 'Terminator'. I'm shaking my head with great
disbelief at this point, but the story must go on.
The cyborgs finally gather enough courage to make a stand against the
human bounty hunters, a fight ensues in which the cyborgs win, but not
before the foetus in a can is tossed about as ransom by the chief bounty
hunter, who gets shot by Cash the mother, but the foetus in a can is
squished to death by the bounty hunter's last ounce of strength.
I figured at this point that perhaps the writers were trying to make a
statement about the unfairness of life.
But alas, when all the cyborgs are looking glummed face at not having
saved the foetus, Cash  smugly states that she hid the real foetus in a
can and the one that was squished was only a fake.
At this point I truly believe that there is no justice in this world.
Anyway, this movie was so bad that it was mildly entertaining.

Title
Review for Life of Brian (1979)
Cast: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Micahel Palin, Terry Gilliam, Eric
Idle, Terry Jones. Director: Terry Jones Written: By the cast.
At first there was 'The Life of Christ'. Who can forget 'The Sermon on
the Mount', 'The Feeding of the Five Thousand', and 'The Last Temptation
of Christ'. Ooops, did I say that? Must have misplaced a page out of
Scorsese's books. Then there is the 'Life of Brian'. Who can forget the
'Gourd of Life', the 'Missing Slipper' and the 'Miracle of the Berry
Tree.'
"Brian child prodigy, the creation of mistaken identity, who had the
misfortune of being born on Christmas day, to forever be compared to the
greater man. His gifts of Myrrh, Gold and Frankincense snatched away at
birth by three wise men. Not as stupid as haggard looked. His mother in
great need of shave, with voice so deep a frog prince one could almost
mistake her be. Grew up in town of Bethlehem, nay carpenter or humble
slave, but rising member of 'Judean People's Front'. To see the Pharisee
of Cleese organise let's stone 'Jehovah' speech, to watch women with
camel beards, pick up rocks in furious vent their anger be on that
stupid Pharisee. Next of note, on Graffiti paint. The walls of
Jerusalem, not 'All Hail Mary' or 'Hail King David', but one hundred
times from dusk till dawn, poor Brian slaves with picture words to pen
'Hail Caesar' not in one, but three Hebraic, Greek and Aramaic. Thus his
life goes on to forever be, remembered as Christ's prodigy. Where 'Bigus
Dickus' brings laughs bigger than 'Fall of Rome'; to mercies feet,
Brian's fate rests on Pontius Pilate's mouthy lisps with 'evewy Wobert,
Wichard and Bwian'. To end up crossed not with nail to hand, but rope to
arm and platformed feet. To die for cause J.P.F., P.L.O., and I.R.A. His
dying words nay 'Father forgive them for they know not what they do.',
but hey 'Always look on the bright side of life.'"
     From 'The Chronicles of Monty Python Snippets' by TMT Voon.
Technically speaking how can one criticise 'Monty Python' when in truth
they are a mockery of themselves. One cannot take the talents of Cleese,
Idle, Palin and the others and expect Shakespeare, Keats, or Wordsworth.
Confusing in many parts i.e. the kidnapping of Brian by a space craft, the
use of the same actors to play multiple characters. This irreverent
comedy pastes together not a script or a plot, but various stand up
situations of issues relating to the Christian faith. Most notably
'Blind Faith', and the unquestioned acceptance of miracles. However, the
definition of faith is one which does not have it's roots imbedded in
explanation or logic, so in truth faith is blind. As with every Monty
Python movie, the sets, the costumes, the entire film is always
secondary to the jokes and the actors. So what we have is a lot of
adolescent school boys having plenty of fun playing with themselves in
Jerusalem.

Review for House of the Spirits, The (1993)
Starring: Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Winona Ryder, Antonio
Banderas, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Vanessa Redgrave, Vincent Gallo, Maria
Conchita Alonso Director: Bille August Screenplay: Bille August based on
the novel LA CASA DE LOS ESPIRITUS by Isabel Allende Music: Hans Zimmer
This is the story of a male, chauvinistic pig, who has nothing; gains
something; marries a girl from a respectable family; thinks his spinster
sister is having an affair with his wife, so exiles her; rapes his
servant girls in the heat of passion; beats his daughter for falling in
love with a peasant boy; but mellows out in his old age.
I think I had better. Jeremy Irons plays the role of the sadistic
pioneering plantation owner, who unfortunately doesn't age fast enough.
Meryl Streep, arguably the best character actress of her generation, is
laughable as a sixteen year old girl, but swings into class acting mode
after adolescence. Glen Close plays the elderly spinster sister to a teen
- hey she is a spinster! Isn't she? Winona Ryder carries that wide-eyed
innocent sweetness that we have come to know and love. Antonio Banderas
at this point in time was probably still learning English as his third
or fourth language. He speaks the words but what do they mean?
Comment: Clearly the 'House of the Damned'.

Review for 101 Dalmatians (1996)
Cast: Glenn Close, Jeff Daniels, Joely Richardson, Joan Plowright, Hugh
Laurie, Mark Williams, John Shrapnel Director: Stephen Herek Screenplay:
John Hughes based on the novel by Dodie Smith
People look like the pets they own. There may be some truth in this
statement. Jeff Daniels carries the same dog eyed look of a Labrador,
and Joely Richardson carries herself with the same dainty steps of a
poodle, and Cruella De vil (Glen Close) has given the term 'bitch' a new
edge.
Animals talk to each other and this movie proves it. When our 99 puppies
are kidnapped, the dogs of England howl the night down like the sounding
of an air raid, and every creature whether domestic or wild, join in one
of the greatest rescues of the animal kingdom.
HOWWWWWWL, woof, woof, HOWWWWWWL. Sorry, I just felt like doing
something spontaneously canine.
Animals are more intelligent that human beings.  Of note is the similar
'Home Alone' sequences where the baddies, namely Cruella, get a run for
their money. Crime doesn't pay and the punishment for kidnapping puppies
is well deserved and hilariously painful to watch.
Forget about 'Perfect Match' or any dating service for lonely hearts.
All you need to find true love is a pet Dalmation, and a bicycle ride in
the park on a sunny day. I guarantee that your dog will sniff out all
the potential suspects for you. Falling in the pond also gains you extra
sympathy points, but getting the girl in the end is all that matters.
So the Disney cartoon classic, '101 Dalmations' comes to life, and I can
say that it is quite enjoyable to watch if one does not continually
compare it to the original. Like all Disney movies, they all get to live
happily ever after - Pongo, Pedita and all 99 puppies.

Review for Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace (1996)
My lawnmower man is personable, friendly and always punctual. He does a
wonderful job giving the grass an even trim and serves as an alarm clock
on Friday mornings. When I hear the burrrrr of the motor I know I'm
running late for work.  He is not Lady Chatterley's Lover even though
the neighbour has suggested a sensual thing or two regarding his manly
machine and long thick rake. She was mightily disappointed last week
when he didn't make an appearance because his gardening equipment had
been stolen. Now who could have done such a criminal thing and denied
dear 81 y.o. Ms Appleby from watching the lawnmower man at work.
Apparently he had gone on a killing spree when his thrusty, I mean
trustworthy hoe was stolen.
So my story seems a bit farfetched and my last statement appears totally
false. However, my point is when your lawnmower man suddenly changes
personality from a simple, non-malevolent person to a psychotic, power
hungry murderer, more often than not someone has tampered with his
neural pathways. The prime example of this situation is nicely outlined
and documented in the original LAWNMOWER MAN movie. In this previous
venture, the scientist (Pierce Brosnan) sticks electrodes where he
shouldn't - namely on the guinea pig gardener's head. He creates Jobe
(Matt Frewer), a supremely intelligent monster who not only survives
battle within virtual reality, but has the gall to demand a rematch. The
war waged between Jobe and mankind has become a personal vendetta for
vengeance.
In this mad struggle over CPU processors, the computer generated god
attempts to conquer mankind for ensnaring, transforming and ultimately
empowering him. Peter (Austin O'brien) is the only member of the
original cast to appear in the sequel besides Jobe. This boy befriended
Jobe as a child, and has since grown into a young man surviving in the
crime riddled streets of the future. He has made it his quest to save
Jobe from himself, and his search leads him to the only scientist
(Patrick Bergin) who can prevent Jobe from achieving world dominance and
so on and so on.
Needless to say the performances by the actors are wooden, or should I
say plastic. The poor direction and badly written plot results in a lack
of genuine excitement or interest. This is not a compelling watch, and
feels like a bad case of static. The problem with the Lawnmower Man 2 is
in its conclusion. The all powerful Jobe is too easily defeated by a
magical blade which appears from thin air. The result is the
oversimplification of how to get rid of the bad guy - we'll just cut him
in half! So mankind survives to fight another day, but perhaps the next
time round a hose carrying fireman or a greasy looking construction
worker will amuse us instead of this overworked simpleton gardener.

Review for Falling Fire (1997)
Directed by Daniel D'Or
Cast Michael Paré, Heidi von Palleske, Mackenzie Gray, Zerha Leverman,
Cedric Turner, Christian Vidosa
Written by Daniel D'Or, Peter I. Horton, Philip Jackson
There seems to be a revived interest surrounding falling meteorites and
the destruction of our beloved home planet Earth. It has been suggested
that these comets with pretty tails, were most likely caused the
extinction of the dinosaurs not too long ago. In the coming event of
METEOR another big, Hollywood disaster, action flick, there was first
FALLING FIRE, starring Michael Pare - an underrated C Grade action
prince.
This movie begins by explaining how all of earth's natural mineral
resources have been depleted by the demands of overpopulation. The
Earth's solution to this problem is not family planning, but rather
pulling a meteorite out of its trajectory and into earth's orbit for
mining. Anyone in their right minds will now that this is just asking
for unwanted trouble. But alas an intensely dangerous situation must be
created for Pare to display his fighting skills. To be fair, some credit
must be given to Pare for giving his character an element of depth, when
arguing in the problem with wife scene', and for showing some emotion
in the air born sex scene'.
To make the plot more simple than it already is, add a saboteur aboard
the space station, throw in a religious fanatic groups out to destroy
earth, include elements of murder/mystery, with Pare trying to act and
you'll have a unbelievably great time at the C Grade Pics.

Title
Review for Primary Colors (1998)
Cast: John Travolta, Emma Thompson, Adrian Lester, Billy Bob Thornton,
Maura Tierney, Kathy Bates, Larry Hagman, Paul Guilfoyle
Director: Mike Nichols
Producers: Mike Nichols
Screenplay: Elaine May based on the novel by "Anonymous" (Joe Klein)
One has to compliment John Travolta for perfecting his accent too match
that of President Clinton and from a distance even looking like him.
Emma Thompson has the hair thing down to a Hilary Clinton, and although
she finds it hard to kick the English accent completely, does a good job
impersonating the 1st Lady.
There is nothing like running a Presidential campaign. The lying,
cheating, sleeping about, cover ups, tearing down, scandalising, rumour
spreading, deceptions, name calling, fraudulent defaming etc etc.
Everything you've heard and hate about politics  well it's true.
So does this movie harm the Clintons' public popularity? I don't think
so, because when all is said and done, this movie tells us not to judge
a person for what they have done in the past (no doubt referring to the
sex scandals), but what they can do for the nation in the future. So
three cheers for Bill and the US of A. Another point made by this movie
is how difficult it is to practice clean politics in an arena full of
hungry lions. Also how the pure ideals of hopeful young presidential
candidates become corrupted by the crooked way the game is played.
This movie gives us a close look at what it's like to run a campaign.
The strategy planning, staying a step ahead of the opposition, how to
get public votes, using the media and damage control. Although this is
not engrossing material for a Friday night at the movies, it is still a
fascinating subject. For those of you thinking about getting into
politics, take a long hard look at this movie before jumping into the
Hornets nest. Kathy Bates (MISERY) gives us another powerful performance
as a political strategist that may get a nod from the Academy next year.

Title
Review for Smilla's Sense of Snow (1997)
When I first heard that Smilla had a sense of snow, I was expecting her
to climb Mt Everest. She doesn't. Instead this ice maiden spits liquid
nitrogen with a vengeance and shoots icicles from her arse. She is one
seriously, emotionally frozen lass who is perpetually on the edge of the
toilet seat. What is Smilla's problem? Her Icelandic mother died when
she was six depriving her of the comfort of breast milk. Her Anglo-Saxon
father whisks her away to the confines of Denmark, away from the open
spaces of Greenland. She then competes with her father's bimbette
mistress for his love, before she befriends a deaf Icelandic boy who
gets pushed off the roof of her apartment blocks. So it's not surprising
that Smilla (Julia Ormond) gets pretty pissed off when her only friend
gets killed. The reclusive, bitter Smilla shouts foul play, not because
she has a feeling for snow, but because she's got a feeling it's murder.
The story then revolves around bizarre meteorites and ancient parasitic
worms, which is all fantastically unbelievable. These elements serve as
a mere distraction to the far more interesting Smilla on which the story
is based. This woman who bites, fights, spits to get her way makes an
interesting character, but she is also confused, frightened and fragile
making her a bit of an enigma. If only this movie carried more romance
than mere mystery and suspense, then perhaps Gabrielle Byrne would not
have been wasted as a male body. He gets to bed Smilla and temporarily
defrosts the ice maiden, but that's as interesting as his character
gets. Annoyingly, he is so mysterious that he can't make up his mind
whether he wants to be a good guy or bad guy  leaving the audience with
little hope of figuring him out.
This movie has an interesting feel to it that one finds hard to put into
words, except to say that one gets a good sense of frost when Smilla's
around. Although it scores poorly in the department of plot conclusion,
it redeems itself in creating a character as memorable as Smilla.

Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
Cast: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Robert Wagner, Michael York, Mindy
Sterling, Seth Greene, Verne Troyer, Rob Lowe. Screenplay: Mike Myers &
Michael McCullers.
Producers: Suzanne Todd, Jennifer Todd, Demi Moore & Eric McLeod and
Mike Myers & John Lyons.
Director: Jay Roach.
`Oh BEHAVE! Felicity Shagwell is one shagadellic babe. Do I make your
horny? Female Fembots with breasts that require gun controlling.
Anything that resembles bananas and two balls of icecream. The
nut-biting finale between Mini Me and Austin. All that body hair is a
real turn on, it's a pity more leading men don't wear it on screen.
Anything that vaguely resembles sausages and eggs. Fat Bastard. The love
scene between Felicity and Fat Bastard, that redefines sex. The wrongly
implied love scene in the tent that redefines anal sex. The love scene
between Austin and Ivana Humpalot, that redefines chess and oral sex.
The love scene between Dr. Evil and Frau Farbissina, that redefines
weird sex. The love affair between Austin and Felicity, that does not
happen, because his Mojo goes missing. The relationship between Dr Evil,
himself and Mini Me which redefines a solo love affair. The unique
relationship between Dr Evil and his son Scott www.com.zip, that says a
lot about our relationship with our children nowadays. Weanies, Johnny,
Richard, Dick etc.'
This movie is every bit as silly and crazy as the first. There are
moments that will make your sick, which are probably best forgotten, but
overall Mike Myers has redefined what it means to be an international
spy and leading man.

Title
Review for Crossworlds (1996)
Directed by Krishna Rao Cast: Rutger Hauer, Josh Charles, Stuart Wilson
(II), Andrea Roth
On occasion I have a strange urge to watch a B-Grade science fiction
thriller which makes a quicker entrance onto a video rental shelf, than
one can exit the cinema. Crossworlds is no exception to the rest of the
dime a dozen killer robot, mad alien, time travelling flicks that
already swamp the Sci-Fi section at your local video store. If you look
at what's available, one begins to realise that Sci-Fi movies are either
exceptionally good like Star Wars, Star Trek, or exceptionally bad like
Crossworlds. There doesn't appear to be any middle ground.
What begins as an interesting, though not original concept for a movie
plummets to the ordinary and mundane within minutes. The movie is based
on the theory that there are several dimensions to our universe, and if
one has the key, one can travel through space and time. This idea will
not be too unfamiliar for anyone who watches the weekly episodes of
"Sliders". So the villains who threaten earth on this occasion are known
as "Warlords". They have already conquered several other dimensions, and
have their greedy eyes on puny earth. The catch is that they need the
key, which comes in the form of a gem and a staff.
We are thus introduced to the guardians of the key. Rutger Hauer of
"Blade Runner", and Josh Charles of "Threesome" and Andrea Roth of
"Robocop" the series. Unfortunately, this threesome don't quite hit the
right notes in bed with their perpetual arguments, bickering and
indecision. However, the real disappointment comes at the hands of the
director himself. His lack of imagination suggests that the way to cross
to another dimension is to stamp your feet on the ground, wait for some
wind to blow across your face, and when it stops, turn around and you
have just crossed worlds. Somehow, I think I would have better luck if I
sprinkled a bag full of Pixie dust over myself, before following the
second star to my right, then going straight ahead. "I can fly, I can
fly, I can fly."

Title
Review for U Turn (1997)
Cast: Sean Penn, Jennifer Lopez, Nick Nolte, Powers Boothe, Claire
Danes, Joaquin Phoenix, Billy Bob Thornton, Jon Voight Director: Oliver
Stone
There comes a unique moment in any bad movie, which redefines it as an
outright awful movie. Unfortunately, we arrive at this point much too
late or I would have left the theatre sooner. The line between good and
poor taste is crossed, when it is revealed that a half-breed Indian girl
(Jennifer Lopez), repeatedly raped by her father (Nick Nolte), decides
to marry the beast even when he murdered her mother. In this most
deranged arrangement, f'king the Sheriff (Powers Boothe) and a stray
stranger (Sean Penn) somehow comes into play. With the help of the
stranger, a succession of bullets and stabbings, murder and money is
obtained. What follows is a further succession of pushing, strangling
and death.
Some people will call this art, but I see it as pure lunacy.
What makes this movie particularly disappointing is the fact the
director is Oliver Stone. After his fixation with the sixties and the
NAM war and now this, one may wrongly accuse him of suffering from a bad
case of post-traumatic stress disorder. Get over it Oliver, we live in
the nineties. No more, no more of this pent up ill will which seem to
stain all your movies.
The plot takes place in the dead-beat town of Superior, Arizona. At
first the quirky characters in the town and the unusual camera angles is
reminiscent of NORTHERN EXPOSURE or RAISING ARIZONA. However, when the
bizarre plot sets in, one begins to experience the TWIN PEAKS phenomena,
before a plummeting straight to Hell.
Sean Penn is a wonderfully gifted actor and is unfortunately wasted as
the non-too-bright stranger who can't seem to get out of town. Nick
Nolte is surprisingly thin and haggard looking, but is otherwise well
suited to the role of a murderous, incestuous bigot. Jennifer Lopez
exudes all the charms of a sexually abused vixen, who is supposedly
meant to be haunted by her abusers, but one would never guess it from
all the hard on sex she's getting from her father, the sheriff and the
stranger - she actually looks like she's enjoying herself?
My final comments are angry. Don't make a U TURN, don't even look back,
keep on driving and miss this piece of trash cleverly disguised as
cinema.

Title
Review for Nothing to Lose (1997)
Cast: Tim Robbins, Martin Lawrence, John C. McGinley, Giancarlo
Esposito, Kelly Preston, Michael McKean Director: Steve Oedekerk
Screenplay: Steve Oedekerk
The humour in this movie is mostly derived from a clash of personalities
and different walks of life. Advertising executive Nick Beame (Tim
Robbins) has a pefect wife, a perfect job and a perfect life until he
walks into his bedroom to find his wife in bed with the boss. From this
point on his life takes a spiral downhill, as does the movie.
This man has lost the will to live and begins a series of
self-destructive tendencies as an out let for his anger and frustration.
Enter petty thief Terrence (Martin Lawrence) who gets dragged into the
grand scheme of reckless driving, petrol station hold-ups, rival villain
shoot-outs, robbing the boss and cutting the manhood of a fertility god.
I have always admired Robbins versatility in any role he plays, but he
has chosen something meaningless and forgettable in the character Nick
Beame. You'll be kicking yourself in the end when you realise the entire
fiasco was a mere accident of mistaken identities. It really doesn't get
more stupid than when you mistake your sister-in-law for your wife in
bed.
Martin Lawrence is a relative new comer to film. His annoying antics,
constant whining and endless nagging is reminiscent of nails scratching
the black board. If his career is to be based on this show of hysteria,
it may not be a long one. Especially where there are those on the market
who do it better and get away with it - namely the Murphys and Carries.
This is an absurd tale about losing all hope when you catch your wife
cheating. It basically states that everything else is meaningless
without her in your life. It's a sad philosophy and concept to carry
through life when per chance anyone could suddenly die or leave you.
Sure there's nothing more to lose when the thing you cherish most
disappears, but there is also nothing to gain by trying to destroy
yourself. Perhaps there will be a note of remorse from others when
you're dead, a black coffin that matches your suit, a homely Wake and a
touching quote from Ecclesiastes 3:20, but one has to realise that life
goes on after you're gone. The world does not stop revolving just
because you have decided to jump of the merry go round.

Review for Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (1989) (TV)
The 1989 BIONIC SHOWDOWN should have been one of those tele-movies long
forgotten in the whirlpool of ordinariness surrounding the 80's. If not
for a then unknown, but now well known star known as Ms Sandra Bullock,
this movie would not have come to my attention at all. In this
particular episode of metallic hardware, Sandra is the latest instalment
or should I say successor, of the Bionic Woman aka Jamie Summers
(Lindsey Wagner). Back with old flame Steve Austin (Lee Majors), whose
circuits are getting outdated as quickly as CPU's come in and out of
vogue, they once again battle the forces of evil.
Moving away from the popular theme of Bionics vs Cyborgs, the plot has
been redirected towards a scenario more common ground to the 80's -
namely the cold war between the east and west. Playing on the hot
prospect of tense relationships between the Soviet Union and the United
States, the villains aim to antagonise all concerned in order to
generate self-profit. Their wild card comes in the form of a new bionic
man.
So where does Ms Bullock fit into the big scheme of things? Well, she's
a young woman who was crippled during her childhood, and carries with
her intelligence, wit, sensitivity and humour. These characteristics
become evident in movies like SPEED and WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, are
present a decade ago. Even in this early piece of acting, she is
beginning to show the elements of vulnerability that make people love
and want to protect her. This is a weapon more powerful than bionics if
you ask me.
As for Jamie Summers and Steve Austin, surviving the eighties has become
harder than just reliving the seventies. With good humour and humility,
they graciously make room to the new generation of bionics that has
emerged to replace them. Jamie gets to pull a door apart and uses her
bionic ear only once. Steve gets to flex his bionic muscles, but gets
badly beaten by the new bionic on the block. Sad to say they are a
living testimony of the changing times and rapidly advancing technology.
However, the spotlight in this movie falls on Sandra. She is left with
the difficult task of defeating the evil bionic. For some unknown reason
she is technologically weaker than her male counterpart, and has to use
her brains instead of her brawn to defeat the villain. All that starts
well also ends well, but one gets the benign feeling that this movie was
intended to spawn a new tele-series. But time has revealed that this was
not to be and fortunately so, otherwise Sandra Bullock may not be the
movie star we know today.

Review for Hoodlum (1997)
Cast: Laurence Fishburne, Tim Roth, Andy Garcia, Vanessa L. Williams, Chi
McBride, Clarence Williams III, Cicely Tyson, William Atherton, Loretta
Devine Director: Bill Duke Screenplay: Chris Brancato
In the streets of Harlem 1930's, bullets fly and body counts rise as gang
war erupts between the mad and the black. The war is between the ruthlessly
insane Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) who is invading the turf of Madam Queen
(Cicely Tyson). This is the era of the great depression and illegal gambling
`numbers' (equivalent to today's lotto) is a lucrative source of income for
the mob and a source of employment and diversion for the poor. Queen is
losing the war to Dutch before Bumpy' Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) arrives
on the scene and takes the war to a higher level of intensity.
The sets are wonderfully designed, as are the costumes, but this does not
compensate for my intense dislike of gangster movies. Especially when the
endings are always so predictable  somebody has to die, if not everybody. I
find Laurence Fishburne an intensely stoic actor whose movements on screen
seem excessively deliberate. Nevertheless, it works to his advantage in this
movie and also in the awful EVENT HORIZON, where little emotion is required.
Tim Roth on the other hand excels as the mad Dutch Man and seems much more
at ease with his role. Vanessa Williams graces the screen with her pretty
face, but her character Fracine succumbs too easily to the brute charms of
Bumpy Johnson. Andy Garcia also has a supporting role as Lucky Luciano, the
Godfather who tries to resolve the conflict between the two groups.
There is nothing new in HOODLUM that has not been done, said and re-said in
the countless gangster films made prior to this. Most of which have a higher
quality of direction and acting i.e. THE GODFATHER series, GOOD FELLAS etc.
So unless you have spare cash on hand and spare time to squander, HOODLUM
can be left for a late night showing on television or an afternoon matinee.

Review for Within the Rock (1996)
Directed by Gary J. Tunnicliffe
Cast Xander Berkeley, Caroline Barclay, Bradford Tatum, Brian Krause,
Barbara Patrick
Written by Gary J. Tunnicliffe
Buried WITHIN THE ROCK, lies man's darkest nightmare. A creature with an
acquired taste for rotting flesh and teeth sharp enough to crush a man's
skull. It was trapped 2 million years earlier and labelled The Reaper
of Souls', by an ancient civilisation. They couldn't destroy it, so the
creature was captured and sent hurtling through space in a cage, with
vain hopes that the beast would perish in the void. Instead, it lives.
It hibernates, waiting to bestow death on those who embrace it. Mankind
will be its next prey.
This almost sounds like the beginning of a story used to scare children
at night or on Halloween. Usually, I'm easily frightened and the mention
of Easter bunnies with fangs or Santas with pick-axes will give me
nightmares; but this horrible alien that goes on feeding frenzies,
actually made me laugh. Not so much because it munched on human heads
with great graphic detail, but because it's rubber suit reminded of a
humorous tele-add about sun tan lotion' and lobsters on the beach. It
just goes to show how important costume design is in a movie.
A moon called Galileo's Child', is hurtling through space towards the
Earth. Unless the course of the moon is deviated, the projectile will
destroy our home planet. A small group of miners and scientists have
been assigned the duty of planting explosives beneath the moon's
surface, in order to alter its course. They are falling behind schedule
and finding an alien on board doesn't make the job easier.
This movie makes a vain attempt to recreate the feel of ALIEN, but sadly
lacks the funding or directing skill to make it much more than it is.
The fact that it has a relative nobody cast and mediocre quality script,
doesn't help get it of the ground either. So here comes another B Grade
Pic that hits the C Grade shelves at the video store.

Review for Tarzan and the Lost City (1998)
Cast: Casper Van Dien, Jane March, Steven Waddingham
Director: Carl Schenkel
Producers: Stanley Canter, Dieter Geissler, Michael Lake
Screenplay: Baynard Johnson and J. Anderson Black based on the "Tarzan"
stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs
I'm not sure how people usually like their heroes, but when it comes to
Tarzan, I usually picture a man's man. I don't mean size, cause Casper
Van Dien (STARSHIP TROOPERS) doesn't come small by any means, he's just
too petulant a schoolboy to be the brooding, dark Lord of Greystoke.
Having said that, Casper can't act, and even his growling, chimpanzee
noises and jungle call comes a little mediocre when compared to last
years summer hit GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE  a far superior movie by my
accounts. Little things that don't help are the poor quality of the
script ie when Tarzan tells Jane: I taught myself to read' ???? Also,
Tarzan's ape brethren look like men in monkey suits flying through the
trees. This made me laugh, but doesn't help with the poor credibility of
costume design.
Lots of unfavourable comparisons can about this movie to the early
Weissmuller films, Tarzan the series or even GREYSTOKE: THE LEGEND OF
TARZAN  which I believe to be the best dramatic version to date. This
movie tries to bring back the adventure and fun of the 1940 films, but
that is another time and place, where Tarzan (Weissmuller) retained a
lot of his mystery by grunting and saying very little  and rightly so,
considering he was raised in the jungle. Casper Van Dien has too much
too say and looks like he's on a Contiki-fun-adventure-holiday in
Africa! Jane (Jane March) on the other hand, is sweet but very plain and
flat chested. However, the major criticism is not her chest, but the
fact she lacks any spark and charisma to be a viable jungle man love
interest. When both Jane and Tarzan are boring', then you have a major
problem on your hands.
As for the Lost City of Opah, it looks someone has torn a picture of a
pyramid out of a National Geographic Journal, and very cleverly computer
pasted into the movie. The ending makes little sense, and comes as
suddenly and unexplainable as a bolt of lightning striking the bad guy
dead. Don't bother asking why, it's just because. As for Tarzan and
Jane, I don't think there will be a sequel, at least not if Casper Van
Dien is staring in it.

Review for MatchMaker, The (1997)
Cast: Janeane Garofalo, David O'Hara, Milo O'Shea, Denis Leary, Jay O.
Sanders, Rosaleen Linehan, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Saffron Burrows
Director: Mark Joffe Producers: Eric Fellner, Tim Bevan, Luc Roeg
Screenplay:  Karen Janszen, Louis Nowra, Graham Linehan based on a
screenplay by Greg Dinner
This isn't the best romantic comedy of the year, but it does carry a
quaint Irish charm that will win the hearts of some. I never thought
there was a shortage of single women in Ireland until I watched THE
MATCHMAKER. Single women, this movie is for you. If anyone is suffering
from the dread lonely-hearts syndrome, then I'll recommend a good Irish
dose of matchmaking. Empty your bank account, throw caution to the wind
and buy a ticket to Ireland during matchmaking season. I will guarantee
that even if you can't find yourself a potential mate for a date, at
least you will be treated like a Queen for your entire stay. Imagine men
with good character drooling over you, lining up to ask for your hand to
dance and singing their hearts out for your affection. If this is your
fantasy, then this movie hits all the right notes.
Janeane Garofalo is by all means a charming young actress who came to
our attention as the bubbly, witty Abbey, the gal with the personality,
not the body in THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS. Whilst she was
outstanding in that particular role, her character Marcy in this movie
isn't much of an improvement, but a mere improvisation of what we know
she is capable off. The premise of the movie surrounds Marcy travelling
to Ireland to discover the Irish origins of a Senator McGlory (Jay O.
Sanders), who is eyeing re-election. She arrives during the matchmaking
festival and becomes the unwitting object of marriage for every single
male in the Irish town of Ballinagra. With a bit of Irish luck, a bit of
Irish ale and two Matchmakers working over time on the side - does Marcy
find Mr Right in the end?
This lightweight comedy is easy going and should be enjoyed like a
leisurely stroll on a sunny afternoon. It's weightless content and
innocent fun is great daydream material, carrying with it all the
trivialities of life at its charming best.

Review for Pallbearer, The (1996)
Cast: David Schwimmer, Gwyneth Paltrow, Michael Rapaport, Barbara
Hershey, Toni Collette, Michael Vartan, Bitty Schram, Carol Kane
Director: Matt Reeves Producers: Jeffrey Abrams and Paul Webster
Screenplay: Jason Katims and Matt Reeves
The phone rings. You pick it up. There's someone crying on the other
end. Someone has died. Who is this person?  It's the dead man's mother.
She wants you to make a eulogy at his funeral. The truth of the matter
is that you can't remember him.
At this point I would have replied: Ma'am, it's a real honour to be
asked to say some loving words in memory of your son, but I would think
it inappropriate because I don't remember him.'
Being truthful, yet remaining sensitive, would have been the most
tactful approach to this situation. But being alone (Schwimmer).
Twenty-five years of age. Unemployed, and still living with mother, can
do strange things to a man. Namely, agreeing to make a eulogy for
someone that you don't remember from chess club at high school, then
sleeping with the dead man's mother.

Review for Con Air (1997)
Cast: Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, Steve
Buscemi, Mykelti Williamson, Rachel Ticotin, Colm Meaney, Danny Trejo,
Nick Chinlund, David Chappelle, M.C. Gainey Director: Simon West
Screenplay: Scott Rosenberg
There must be a good reason to justify mass destruction and excessively
loud noise on screen. People will not warm to pure special effects and
explosions which dazzle the eye like fireworks in the sky. So what
better than to introduce a weather beaten, unfairly punished, tortured
hero (Cage), who has served seven years in a penitentiary, for defending
his honour and protecting his wife.
Years pass as quickly as the sands of an egg timer, and soon our hero
has finished his sentence, and is aboard a plane carrying the convicted
to their release destinations or to their new prison home. He must
survive the journey of his life aboard 'Con Air' -
'Convicts-Onboard-No-smoking-And-Intellectual/Irreverent-Ratbags'.
It is the eve of his daughter's seventh birthday, and our hero will do
anything, and I mean literally anything, to be able to give his child a
birthday present in person. That is, of course, unless he gets waylaid
by other honourable deeds, such as finding an insulin syringe for his
best friend who is about to lapse into diabetic ketoacidosis, or
preventing the rape of a female law enforcer.
Such honour is certainly lacking amongst our assorted passengers,
ranging from the petty pick pocket, to the numeric rapist; from the
politically-incorrect racist, to the intellectually well-achieved mass
murderer, and of course a Hannibal Lector persona for added variety.
Just as we all have different styles of reviewing movies, this rat-bag
assortments of waylaid souls, intermingle to create a symphony of
destruction in the hi-jack of the decade.
Some petty quirks and misdemeanours to point out. Diabetics who have not
eaten the entire plane flight, will more likely develop hypoglycaemia
(low blood sugars, before coma) than acidosis (high blood sugars, before
coma). To which our hero, should be looking for jelly beans and not a
syringe full of insulin. According to this movie, singing has life
changing effects on the psychotic and mentally ill. Who knows? I guess
anything is possible if you survive a plane crash in the middle of
Vegas.

Review for Big Hit, The (1998)
Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christina Applegate, Avery
Brooks, Lela Rochon, Bokeem Woodbine, China Chow, Lainie Kazan, Elliot
Gould
Director: Che-Kirk Wong
Producers: Warren Zide, Wesley Snipes
Screenplay: Ben Ramsey
Someone should have warned the producers of this movie, not to cast two
ex-Calvin Klein models and a Federation Starfleet Captain in the same
movie, under the direction of a Hong Kong action flick director. The end
result is a pretty big mess filled with smart mouthed, pretty boys
playing with guns, with little idea of where to put their heads and when
to put on their pants.
I'm referring to the dressing scene where Lou Diamond Phillips, Mark
Wahlberg and Antonio Sabato Jr., bare butts and skin for the world to
see. As if Mark Wahlberg's ending fiasco in BOOGIE NIGHTS, wasn't enough
to define what is not considered the norm for that particular male
appendage! One can feel male egos soar and testosterone drip as each
tries to show off how great they look and how firm their muscles are. If
there were to be a winner - Sabato Jr is undoubtedly the better model in
Kleins.
So where did this go wrong, except for the fact that they hired models
instead of actors? Well, Mark Wahlberg has started an annoying trend of
playing idiosyncratic love-me, I'm so cute' roles (not as annoying as
David Schwimmer). I have to admit that the opening action scenes are
well choreographed and amongst the best this year. However, the rest of
the movie is tediously weighed down by a spineless Wahlberg, a slutty
(unintentional) Applegate, an overactive Diamond Phillips, a pin me up'
Sabato Jr and a kidnapped Japanese girl.
The BIG HIT is a big mess and deserves a big miss.

Title
Review for Amistad (1997)
Cast: Djimon Hounsou, Matthew McConaughey, Morgan Freeman, Anthony
Hopkins, Nigel Hawthorne, Stellan Skarsgard, David Paymer, Pete
Postlethwaite, Anna Paquin Director: Steven Spielberg Screenplay: David
Franzoni
I have perhaps wrongly felt that Steve Spielberg excels better as a
director of action packed adventure movies, than one needed to handle a
sensitive melodrama. With the exception of SCHINDLER'S LIST, which was
too intense for my comfort zone, I have continued to hold to this
generalisation until now. The AMISTAD is exactly this, a tense courtroom
drama with a powerful, universal message  Freedom!
Set in the 1800's, this is the true story of a group of African slaves
who manage to mutiny aboard a Spanish ship in their desperate efforts to
return home.  Recaptured of the coast of the United States, they are put
through the mill of judicious trials before reaching the Supreme Court
to be represented by the ex-President himself, John Quincy Adams
(Anthony Hopkins). The nature of this case was not as simple as letting
a few African slaves go, but would become the thorn of contention over
which North and South would go to war.
Spielberg draws horrific pictures of the maltreatment of slaves aboard
the slave ships. This is not dissimilar to the horrific suffering he
recreated during the Jewish Holocaust. The AMISTAD is also full of
powerful, sickening images of human beings subjected to torture, rape
and murder. Human life is reduced to a mere commodity and is as easily
exchanged for coin, as it is to toss into the sea as unwanted cargo. It
is these images that tell us of their unimaginable suffering and the
reason why slavery must and should always remain abolished.
Anthony Hopkins once again scores another Academy Award nomination for a
finely tuned character performance in portraying the great Quincy Adams.
Morgan Freeman says little in the movie and has little room to manoeuvre
with his character except to silently voice his protest through others.
Matthew McConaughey is no stranger to the courtroom (A TIME TO KILL) and
does well as the property lawyer who defends the Africans up until the
Supreme Court. But it is the African slave Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), who
shows us the torment of a captured human being with his every defiant
expression and shed tear. He gazes up at the night sky and carries with
him all the hopes of one looking for the way home. This movie is a long
sit, but should be worth your while if you are willing to understand the
plight of the human spirit.

Title
Review for Elizabeth (1998)
Director: Shekhar Kapur
Writer: Michael Hirst
Cast: Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston, Joseph
Fiennes, Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardendt, John Gielgud, Terence
Rigbby, et al
In one of the most engrossing history lessons I've come to experience
this year, ELIZABETH brings to life the tale of a princess who overcomes
the adversity of the Catholic Church, to become the greatest Queen of
her time. She is Elizabeth the First, Elizabeth the untouchable,
Elizabeth the virgin, Elizabeth the servant of her country. She set
herself immeasurable standards and never married. She rescued the
flagging English economy and pushed it in the direction of power,
despite being constantly under the threat of war from France and Spain.
Without her there may never have emerged such great writers like William
Shakespeare, for art flourished under her regime.
Her tale is set mostly in court, where the stuff of murder, intrigue and
deceit are woven into a web of suspense. We watch how perilously close
she comes to death, when her enemies had no greater wish than to see her
beheaded. Neglected by her father, the incorrigible Henry the 8th,
betrayed by her lover Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), it is not
surprising she clearly states that I am the mistress of this house and
no man will be my master'. In this context, we are shown why the Queen
suppresses her femininity and does not allow herself to love or be
loved, for treachery waits for her at every doorstep. In a time when
women were deemed inferior to men, she boldly tells the House of Lords 
I may be a woman, but I have the heart of a man, if I so choose.' And
so destiny was paved, when Elizabeth proved herself a worthy ruler, by
choosing to serve her country above herself.
This is a fine performance by Cate Blanchett, a talented Australian
actress, who deserves nothing less than an Oscar nomination for her
portrayal of the Queen. Jeffrey Rush should not to be overlooked, as he
gives another solid performance as the cunning Sir Francis Walshingham,
the Queen's most trusted confidante and adviser. This may be considered
a slow ride for some, but so are novels and they usually read better
than movies. Like a novel, this story comes across more finely paced
than most of the rushed 2 hour jobs out there today.

Title
Review for Everyone Says I Love You (1996)
Cast: Woody Allen, Natasha Lyonne, Julia Roberts, Goldie Hawn, Alan Alda,
Edward Norton, Drew Barrymore, Tim Roth, Lukas Haas, Natalie Portman, Gabby
Hoffman Director: Woody Allen Screenplay: Woody Allen
Everybody gets to sing, everyone gets to dance, and of course everybody
gets to say 'I love you' in this 'Woody Allen' musical. This movie feels
like a spring day on the 4th of July; bursting into song in the toilet,
shower or petrol station; with feelings of uninhibited spontaneity breaking
the chains of shy reservation and self consciousness; allowing that
something special from the inside to re-sparkle the glib world; or more
simply put, it's like that incredible 'glow' of being pregnant before the
morning sickness sets in.
Things of notes - Drew Barrymore's breasts. She doesn't like wearing bras,
and Woody Allen has smartly worked this asset into one of the movies
strengths. The effects of moonlight shining through that blue saffron
evening gown, are like dark cherries on two Christmas Puddings. Yum! The
Woody-Goldie/dance-fly sequence is a prime example of magical, onscreen
tenderness shown between two mature, divorced adults - touching and amusing
at the same time. However, I really wanted to see Woody swing Goldie so
hard that she would fly into the French Riviera. Now that would have been a
memorable scene.
As a very choosy Woody Allen fan, who carries an incredible 'hate/love'
relationship with his work - I would say that I like this movie because it
is witty, original and uplifting. 'Musicals' have unfortunately become a
rare, and dying breed of cinematic motion, and I admire Allen's courageous
attempt to revive the art with such droll satire. Dislikes - too much
partner swapping, too many people talking at the same time; both of which
are unfortunate Woody Allen trademarks.
Since everyone feels warm and fuzzy; and everybody loves everybody else
let's smile, group hug, camera and FLASH!

Title
Review for Oscar and Lucinda (1997)
We have a minister (Ralph Fiennes) who is scared of water, addicted to
gambling, a bit of a wimp, a murderer, who wages his girlfriend's
inheritance that he can deliver a glass church to the back yard of the
world (Australia bush), before being seduced by a female vamp and
drowning in the glass church and somehow I'm meant to be better off
for having journeyed with this tormented man to his watery grave? Hah.
This product of this Peter Carey novel had me annoyed and bored to tears
from the word gamble. To think that it was a prize-winning novel, had me
convinced that it achieved it's end not so much for what was written,
but how it was written. Yes, this movie is not for the pubescent
adolescent waiting for their first taste of love, not for those in their
twenties looking for true romance or those in their thirties searching
for a spouse. OSCAR AND LUCINDA can be left for the time when the kids
have come and gone, and you can once again afford to walk around the
house naked and contemplate the meaning of what else to do with your
life. Come to think of it everyone in the theatre was either carrying a
frame or a walking stick. This made me feel awkward and strangely out of
place for not having arrived on the same bus from the local retirement
village.
Needless to say, the performances by Ralph Fiennes and Cate Blanchett
are superb, but what is the use of fine performances when the story line
suffers from the angst of poor motivation. We have two
obsessive/compulsive gamblers. One is a woman and the other an Anglican
minister. Oh the dilemma the dilemma is like whether to light another
fag when you are desperately trying to stop smoking. So the minister
bites his nails, twitches nervously trying to water down his tainted
conscience, becomes tormented by his lack of self control which
ultimately results in a fool hardy bet that leads to his death.
Undoubtedly, this man is in dire need of Gambler's anonymous, but I
cannot bring myself to empathise with him. To think the entire situation
could have been easily prevented by a simple I love you' and not by
Lets make a bet that I can deliver a glass church to the
outback'..well annoys the hell out of me.
Full marks to Gillian Armstrong for tight direction, but really the
story line majorly sucks.

Review for Quiz Show (1994)
Starring: Ralph Fiennes, Rob Morrow, John Turturro, Paul Scofield, David
Paymer, Mira Sorvino, Martin Scorsese, Barry Levinson Director: Robert
Redford Screenplay: Paul Attanasio based on REMEMBERING AMERICA: A VOICE
FROM THE SIXTIES by Richard N. Goodwin
Ask me a question, and I will guarantee you a correct answer (but first
tell me what the questions are before hand).
That's what cheating is all about. This is the subject of Quiz show. A
scandal that occurred in the 50's when Twenty-One' was the biggest
ratings game show on television. Whenever the ratings fell, the network
would find new contestants to replace the sagging ones. They found their
biggest ratings winner in Charles Van Doren (Fiennes), the son of one of
America's leading intellectual family. That was until a inquest was made
into the affairs of the show.
Unfortunately, the network (N.B.C.) escaped non-implicated. The
scapegoats for this embarrassing scam fell on the producers of the show,
and it's star contestant Van Doren, who bravely owned up to the
cheating. The issues of money, ratings, and human character are nicely
explored  in this movie. It probes the viewer's mind, as to whether you
would also cheat, if placed in a similar situation as Van Doren.
Crisp directing from Redford, intriguing movie material, and solid
performances from Fiennes and Turturro.
Comment: I'd like to see them try it on Jeopardy.

Title
Review for Mad City (1997)
Cast: Dustin Hoffman, John Travolta, Blythe Danner, Mia Kirshner, Alan
Alda, William Atherton, Robert Prosky, Ted Levine, Bill Nunn, Lucinda
Jenny
Director: Costa-Gavras
Producers: Arnold Koppelson and Anne Koppelson
Screenplay: Tom Matthews
There is something intensely annoying about a story, that has only two
possible outcomes of which neither is satisfying.
Scenario 1:
An ex-security guard of a state museum (John Travolta) confronts his
boss with shotgun and explosives, in a desperate attempt to get his job
back. The boss (Blythe Danner) is a bit of a female tight arse, but hey,
if I were threatened with a pistol in my face, I wouldn't give you your
job back no matter how tight my arse. I mean I would initially say yes,
but sack you later.
Scenario 2:
During the confrontation, he accidentally shoots his buddy (Bill Nunn),
the other museum security officer in the stomach. This is the part where
the quick fix I'm sorry', doesn't work anymore.
Scenario 3:
He takes a group of children, a teacher and reporter (Dustin Hoffman)
hostage. This is the part where you've just lost all rational thinking,
the media starts portraying you as a lunatic and you get placed on top
of the police hit list all at once.
>From here on, there can only be two possible outcomes for the Travolta
character  To Jail' or To Death'. Knowing how Hollywood scripts work,
the To Jail' option is not very popular because audiences normally
don't like their hero/antiheroes to end up in jail. Jail is for bad guys
and the Travolta character isn't bad enough to end up there. So that
leaves us with the other option of To Death', which is cliché, but safe
enough to end a silly situation which couldn't have gone any other way.
John Travolta shows us how desperate a family man can get, if he is
unable to find work to support his family. Looking in the Classifieds
for a job would have been a better option, but that would be a different
story. Dustin Hoffman, the reporter, just mumbles his way through the
movie, trying to draw sympathy for the Travolta character, and is lucky
not get blown away for his efforts.
An overall, unnecessary tragedy and waste of human life.

Review for Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997)
Cast: John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, Jack Thompson, Lady Chablis, Alison
Eastwood, Irma P. Hall, Paul Hipp, Jude Law
Director: Clint Eastwood
Producers: Clint Eastwood, Randy Phillips, Arnold Stiefel
Screenplay: John Lee Hancock based on the novel by John Berendt
This is a movie that leaves its ending up for viewer speculation. The
mystery remains unresolved. Some people may find this style of vagueness
and lack of conclusion annoying. But, we must remember that much of
life's circumstances are a mystery, and no one may truly know the full
motives behind the foul actions of a crime.
In the quiet southern community of Savannah, evil takes root. A wealthy,
eccentric millionaire, Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey) is accused of
murdering a dead hustler (Jude Law) in his mansion  sending shock waves
through the community. Throw in a swig of good southern Voo Doo, about
how good comes a half hour before midnight and evil half past, and
you'll start needing a good swig of lemonade halfway through the movie
to help the crime go down better. Enter journalist and author John Kelso
(John Cusack), who is asked to write a feature article on our infamous
millionaire, but ends up unearthing more black magic and superstition
than he counted on.
The ending leaves one with an unearthly feeling of a graveyard. It makes
one wonder what happens to murderers, rapists and other criminals who
get away with the crime. This movie suggests that you will sow what you
reap, and even if you escape human judgement, beware the hand of fate
that holds the balance of good and evil in her hands. Her judgement may
come as quickly and as suddenly as a heart attack.
Once again, good direction from Clint Eastwood who has paced the movie
well. Kevin Spacey puts in a fine performance as a charming, deceptive
millionaire and John Cusack is believable as a reporter. This movie is
probably not everyone's cup of tea, but great thought provoking material
none the less.

Title
Review for Misérables, Les (1998)
Cast: Liam Neeson, Geoffrey Rush, Uma Thurman, Claire Danes, Hans
Matheson
Director: Bille August Producers: James Gorman, Sarah Radclyffe
Screenplay: Rafael Yglesias based on the novel by Victor Hugo
>From the start, I knew that this adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les
Miserables was going to be difficult. The 1000 plus English translation
of this French novel, which I read several years ago, was not going to
be easy to relay to screen.
For someone who has had no prior knowledge of this great accomplishment
in modern literature, watching this movie may be confusing. The motives
behind why certain characters react/act come across clearly on the
written page, but is watered down to basic facts without clear
reasoning, in two hours of film footage. For example, why can't the
Inspector Javert stop hunting down the reformed convict, Valjean? Why
does Javert commit suicide in the end? These are all unanswered actions
that a first time viewer is left lingering with at the end of the movie.
For this very reason, it is almost impossible for any film to fully
capture the finer intricacies of this expertly woven piece of art.
Other annoying happenings, which fans of Les Miserables may notice, is
how the relationship between Valjean and the prostitute, Fantine, is
thinned down to a lunch over cheese and wine, a passing touch and
connotations that there was something romantic lingering in the air. If
this was the case, it left me with as much romantic inclination as a
wingless bee attempting to pollinate the flowers. The villainous
scoundrels, the Thenardiers, are also quickly brushed aside due to time
constraints; most criminal off all, was the total emission of Eponine,
the silent heroine who sacrificed herself for love.
Perhaps if they added the music of the theatrical production of Les
Miserables, all could be forgiven; without the music, this adaptation of
Les Miserables seems empty and lifeless, somehow missing the heartbeat
of the revolutionaries  and unfortunately  I don't hear the people
sing, singing the songs of angry men.'
The cast is well chosen. Liam is big and believable enough to be the
immensely strong Valjean. Geoffrey Rush, throws all he has to bring out
the best and worse in Javert and is very good in the role. The whispy
beauty, Uma Thurman, works best when she is dying, looking pale and
forlorn. Whilst Clare Danes is charming as the young Cosette. As I
alluded to earlier, Les Miserables works best as a musical, pure acting,
unfortunately, serves only to keep the story afloat.

Title
Review for Enemy of the State (1998)
Cast: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Regina King, Loren Dean,
Jake Busey, Barry Pepper, Tom Sizemore, Lisa Bonet, Gabriel Byrne.
Screenplay: David Marconi.
Director: Tony Scott.
For a movie that was initially intended for Tom Cruise, it hasn't turned
out half bad with Will Smith instead. Will isn't the likely candidate
for any form of conspiracy campaign, but does well  toning down his
usual smugness, for a serious dramatisation of a lawyer being hunted
down by the state. The ENEMY OF THE STATE is a good thriller, although
reliant on the mere chance occurrence of several missing videotapes in
order for the ending to work out so finely. Despite this over-contriving
of the plot to bring about the conclusion, there is little else to
complain about. The viewer senses the terror of being continuously
watched, chased, monitored by video cameras, bugging devices,
state-of-the-art satellites - all pitted against an innocent man who
stumbles across a conspiracy by accident. This sort of the movie works
on one's paranoia, and will no doubt fuel public opinion against
government intrusions on privacy. One doesn't sleep easy knowing how
easy it is for every part of your life to become open to the eyes of the
world. This movie fares much better than THE NET which follows a similar
premise.

Title
Review for Madame Butterfly (1995)
Cast: Ying Huang, Richard Troxell, Ning Liang, Richard Cowan, Jing-Ma
Fan
Director: Frederic Mitterrand
Written by Giuseppe Giacosa and Luiji Illica
Music: Giacomo Puccini
I love the music of Puccini, and there wasn't any doubt in my mind that
I would enjoy MADAME BUTTERFLY - unless of course the actors couldn't
sing. Although, I had been previously exposed to the music of Puccini on
cassette and radio, I was little aware of what the words actually meant.
So with the help of the much needed and greatly appreciated sub text, I
began to uncover the sinister nature of MADAME BUTTERFLY.
I had the general understanding that Captain Pinkerton would eventually
leave Butterfly, and as a result she would end her own life. However, I
wasn't fully aware of what a bastard Pinkerton (Richard Troxwell) truly
was. To think that he entered into a marriage with a geisha girl, as a
temporary solution for his loneliness; knowing well that by American
law, he could cast her aside anytime for another woman  makes my blood
boil! Although, this story may be fictional, it is probably based
loosely on fact. I have been told, that what happened to Butterfly was
not an uncommon occurrence for that era.
So I'm not surprised that the Japanese harboured such anti-Americanism
sentiment for a long time. You can't expect to be overly forgiving when
American sailors treat your women so badly. This probably didn't start
2nd WW, but there wouldn't have been any holding back over Pearl
Harbour.
Ironically, it took an Italian Composer by the name of Puccini to infuse
his music with such a heart-felt tragedy. One can feel the heart of the
loyal, devoted Butterfly in Un bel di, vedremo one of the most
beautifully created Arias of this century. French director, Frederic
Mitterrand has chosen well, his leads in the Chinese Soprano, Ying Huang
and tenor Richard Troxell.  Overall, a great moving piece of Opera that
will haunt us for a very long time. But if I had it my way, I would have
ended the story with Butterfly carving out Pinkerton's wanton heart with
a dagger.

Title
Review for Dear God (1996)
Cast: Greg Kinnear, Laurie Metcalf, Maria Pitillo, Tim Conway, Roscoe
Lee Browne, Jen Seda, Hector Elizondo
Director: Garry Marshall
Screenplay: Warren Leight and Ed Kaplan Cinematography: Charles Minsky
When a con artist (Greg Kinear) is given the choice of prison or
community service, it's not surprising he chooses service  being a
pretty boy. In the dungeons of a mailroom, he is given the task of
sorting dead mail, with an odd ball group of socially impaired
co-workers. When they take to the habit of opening Dear God' letters,
and then answering them  i.e. giving away money, stopping suicides,
babysitting etc, they begin to find some common purpose in life.
So why doesn't this premise for a feel good movie work? Well there isn't
a specific reason why, just a lot of little annoying things that seem to
weigh it down. Like the constant whining of Laurie Metcalf (ROSEANNE's
sister), the general low IQ of the actors, the annoyingly tedious ways
of getting a miracle to happen. I know they're not angels, but at least
God has a plan. It's surprising that this severely, dysfunctional group,
are able to put a single constructive idea together between them. I
guess I should count my blessings, and include this as one of God's
miracles.
The movie then takes another tedious downward turn, when the City of New
York decides to take this group of muffin heads to court for answering
Dear God' letters. When they win the case and everyone starts rejoicing
in the city streets, one would have thought they had just discovered the
cure for AIDS. Now that would be a worthwhile miracle in response to a
Dear God' letter.
Greg Kinnear once again plays cute - something he does well i.e.
SABRINA, AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Whilst director, Garry Marshall, has chosen
an unusual subject material for his latest movie, far removed from the
PRETTY WOMAN stuff he is renown for.
In future, let God answer his own letters.

hear. There is no holding back, no matter how much you disagree with
him. When you watch this movie from start to finish, you have to listen
to him whine about this, that and the other. Some of it will be funny,
but most of it  is  tedious.
I enjoyed Allen's last two ventures into movie making - MIGHTY APHRODITE
and EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU. I felt that at last, Woody Allen was
becoming more commercial and palatable to the general public. In
DECONSTRUCTING, Woody tries to weave the tale of a man's life, his life,
through characters in his novels that are based on characters in
reality. This is an interesting approach, but can get annoying when one
is trying to match a novel character to the corresponding character in
real life, especially with constant flipping about. The general rule of
thumb is, the character in the novels are usually the better looking
ones ie Demi Moore\Kirsty Alley; Julia Louis Dreyfus\Judy Davis etc
Surprisingly, this is also one of Woody's most uninhibited movies with
plenty of casual sex, oral sex, writhing naked bodies (in hell), which
is too liberal for my taste. But hey this is a man who finds it
acceptable to bed an adopted daughter, so what can I say. His rant about
Judaism will no doubt shock and dismay some Jews, but this is a topic
that's too hot to handle, so I'll just say Shalom'. The script is well
written, the sentences wonderfully constructed and one can even find a
progressive chain of thought somewhere in this Academy nominated script,
but when Woody gets personal, he really let's himself go and the world
may not be ready for such an overly-progressive thinker.

Title
Review for Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997)
Cast: Sandra Bullock, Jason Patric, Willem Dafoe, Temuera Morrison,
Brian McCardie, Christine Firkins,  Royale Watkins Director: Jan de Bont
Screenplay:  Randall McCormick and Jeff Nathanson based on a story by
Jan de Bont and Randall McCormick
A stroll in the park, a bicycle ride, or even a paddle boat ride on the
lake would probably carry more excitement than this ship full of bores.
The only velocity that this movie creates is a hearty yawn, a deep sigh
and perhaps a burp to help the coke go down better. I have fond memories
of the original "Speed" leaving me with breathless anxiety for a bus
full of trapped passengers, an unstoppable train carrying hero and
heroine towards their imminent doom. What has happened to the nerve
racking tension, the bullet hardened action, and the precise timing of
cliff hanging situations???? Well it all sank along with the good
intentions of this boat full of hopeless wannabe action heroes. Yes, the
fast bus has been replaced by a big, big cumbersome slow moving boat.
We all know that Keanu Reeves can't act, so they've filled his missing
shoes with someone of equal talent. Jason Patric, a lad who not only
can't act, but goes a step further when he decides to carry the same
bored expression throughout the movie. Go back to sleep Jason, I'll wake
you up when the movie is over. In fact the only time Jason shows any
interest in his surroundings, is when he flirts with a teenage girl
using sign language; but how does the audience know he's interested?
Work on that smile Jason - it may come in handy in your next movie; and
remember you need to frown when suffering from sea sickness, and don't
forget there's an expression for pain if injured. If you need any help
in that department, my suggestion is - finger in the blender.
Willem Defoe is the vengeful computer expert, whose haematological
"leech" sucking disorder has led him to sabotage the ship's electrical
systems. Much better acting than Jason, but who's comparing. Sandra
Bullock on the other hand is the movie's only likeable element. She
mosies about with good humour and wit. When she starts wielding a chain
saw, you get the strangest feeling that everything is going to be all
right. BZZZZZZZ! She isn't given as much responsibility as in the
original speed, but has her moments usually saving Jason Patric.
So we're back to Jason again. I don't know how to describe his
character, he's not really a hero or an anti-hero, he's just too dumb to
be either. It's not let's have a go at Jason day, but I just have to
mention a couple of dumb things he does.
1.  On saving passengers aboard a dangerously dangling lifeboat. His
option is throw himself and a rope ladder aboard, and to get them out
one by one when there are only minutes to spare. He not only endangers
his own life but everyone else's as well. Sandra comes to the rescue.
Her option is to lower the gang plank so they can all walk safely
aboard. Now why didn't he think of that?
2.  On chasing the enemy, he runs into Willem Defoe's trap like a rabbit
into a snare. Yes, Sandra appears again to rescue her poor little
darling.
3.  On slowing the boat down. "Flood it, flood it" he screams. Ooops.
Jason we should think before we scream. There's that sweet little deaf
girl on the lower deck who is about to be blowing water bubbles soon.
Not to mention that something important in engineering which has just
disappeared underwater.
4.  Still on slowing the boat down. "Let's stuff up the propeller with
cable". Ooops, we almost forgot about the dangerous under tow. Don't
press that button Sandra, you've been saving his arse way too often.
5. On saving Sandra. No Jason, please don't.
My after thoughts are - why didn't they let Sandra steer instead? She
drove that damned bus pretty well! If Jan de Bont directed "Twister" and
"Speed", he should have shown better judgement, than to waste money on a
poorly written sequel of megalomaniac proportions. I mean wasting 30
million on a sea port, for ten very mediocre final minutes - I say
donate the money to UNICEF instead.

Title
Review for Batman & Robin (1997)
Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Uma
Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, Elle Macpherson. Written by: Akiva
Goldsman. Directed by: Joel Schumacher.
The Batty bunch is back! With what is undoubtedly, the 'Cape Crusaders'
corniest and most comic outing.
Every line is a punch line with more misses than hits.
Batman (Clooney), 'I love you old man', shows a more sensitive side to
him; Robin (McDonald), 'I want my own car, the chics love it', also
wants a Gotham emergency signal of his own; Alfred, 'I love you too', is
dying of McGregors syndrome; and Batgirl (Silverstone), 'I love you
Uncle Alfred', joins the gang to battle the villains - the fertile 'my
garden needs tending' Poison Ivy (Thurman), and 'I love my wife' Mr
Freeze (Schwarzenegger).
Gosh there's a lot of LOVE going around! I almost thought they would
break out in a chorus at the end.
All this and more in a day of the life of Bruce Wayne.
Plenty of kiddy fun to hate or appreciate. With a splashy, action packed
opening sequence, which lapses in the middle of the movie, before
picking up again towards the end.
Comment: One happy, loving, batty family which is best appreciated in
the grave.

Title
Review for Jackie Brown (1997)
Cast: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Bridget Fonda,
Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Chris Tucker Director: Quentin Tarantino
Screenplay: Quentin Tarantino, based on the book RUM PUNCH by Elmore
Leonard
I walked into the cinema with a strangely familiar, sick feeling in my
stomach; my head spining the words, Oh God not another Tarantino film.'
PULP FICTION actually nauseated me with it's bloody lack of respect for
life, and the dread feeling that I was about to be hit with another bout
of movie onset vertigo re: Jackie Brown, airline hostess, money
laundering, smart pussycat in high heels, and
We have none of that usual excessive Tarantino, violent sick shit of
bullets spraying flesh, blood, parting heads from body, riddling torso,
an absolute lack of self-control permeating the likes of hits like PULP
and RESERVOIR DOGS. None of that Quentinessential nonsense hindering
this film, although some scenes do come perilously close. Instead I
found a likeable mix of down town funky 60-70's tunes (Tarantino always
has a good ear) matching the heartbeat of the movie. Also a cleverly
thought out plot and stylish look of direction not too dissimilar to
PULP, but without the high body count. Style and Look is the word, and
Quentin's eyes captures the soul of his character's, each have
distinctive personalities and motivations, and the dialogue is as sharp
as Quentin can get it.
So Ms Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a gal in strife, an independent woman
in her 40's who has to out talk, out smart the likes of a murderous, gun
dealer Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), his hardened criminal henchman
(Robert De Niro) and the feds (Michael Keaton and pal). Up for grabs is
half a million and Jackie Brown is out to secure it.
Pam Grier is wonderful as the beauty with brains and a cool disposition
that matches her leggy heels and panty hose. She has the Look. Samuel L.
Jackson merely reprises the street wise, foul mouthed pretentious
intelligentsia that shocked and humoured everybody in PULP FICTION. He
excels in these stereo type roles. His co-partner in crime, the always
reliable Robert De Niro, is unfortunately miscast as a rather lifeless,
boring sidekick, a role which should perhaps have gone to someone
equally lifeless and boring. I haven't seen Bridget Fonda give such a
good performance, since IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU. She glows on screen like
a bride or pregnant mother, but her character is that of a slut  oddly
charming.
An overall well performed, disciplined Tarantino exercise into movie
making, which is moderately entertaining.

Title
Review for Mummy, The (1999)
Cast:  Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Kevin
J. O'Connor, Oded Fehr.
Screenplay:  Stephen Sommers.
Producers:  James Jacks and Sean Daniel.
Director:  Stephen Sommers.
Cap: Unfortunately, this is not Indiana Jones, although Brendan Fraser
tries his best to fill his shoes; which is as near an impossible feat to
let's say raising a mummy from the dead.
The concept and feel of this movie is what draws a crowd. Drawn perhaps
by the romance and sands of Egypt, where long ago the forbidden love
affair between the High Priest and the Pharaoh's Mistress draws a curse
so great that it could destroy the world. Yeah Right! What is impressive
though, is the ensemble of special effects. Walls of sand, whirling
dervishes, mummified priests, death beetles that eat you alive  now
that's what we've all really come to see. And if that's what you're
looking for, then it comes more or less served as a ten-course meal.
With the rise of the mummy, returns the ten plaques of Egypt. Believe me
this is one very, angry, nasty mummy whose out for revenge. Where death
is only the beginning, he's back to suck the life force out of grave
robbers, steal the girl, sacrifice her to raise another girl, beat the
good guy to a pulp and just generally be big, mean and very nasty.
Overall, disappointing in the script and acting department. Particularly
disappointing was the heroine (Rachel Weisz), who was so British that it
almost made it impossible for the hero (Brendan Fraser), to get into her
knickers. In fact there was no chemistry between them at all. Perhaps,
and just perhaps, the only one who could have lit her fire was the
Mummy, but then only maybe. Even more annoying was her brother (John
Hannah), who was so annoyingly unfunny, as the side kick, they should
have hired a camel instead. But don't let all these setbacks spoil your
enjoyment of the otherwise thrilling Mummy.

Title
Review for Evita (1996)
Cast: Madonna, Antonio Banderas, Jonathan Pryce, Jimmy Nail Director:
Alan Parker Screenplay: Alan Parker and Oliver Stone Cinematography:
Darius Khondji Music: Andrew Lloyd Webber Lyrics: Tim Rice
Sometimes, knowing the unpleasant and unfortunate outcome of a story,
before it unfolds, will destroy ones appreciation of the movie itself.
Yes, I watched a documentary on Eva Peron, before I watched the
musical "Evita." What shocked me about the documentary was the abuse
that the mummified body of Eva Peron suffered at the hands of the
anti-Peronists. I won't go into gory details but here's the low down.
After the fall of the Peron government, Eva has some of her fingers and
part of her ear cut off for an identification process. She is stored
away in a plain wooden coffin, at a secret location for fear that her
dead body will spark a revolution. Somehow, her body and coffin end up
in a shady general's office, where it is rumoured that the general
committed acts of necrophilia. After another change of government, her
body is sent to France and buried under a false name for a number of
years. The winds of change blows frequently in Argentina, before another
change of government finally allows the return of Eva's body to her
family. She now lies buried beneath fifteen feet of marble.
If this sad finale, doesn't wreck one's appreciation of Evita, I'm not
sure what will. On a brighter note, I was impressed with the lyrical
style of the movie, which is mostly photogenic images of Madonna,
Antonio and Jonathan set to song. It is a long sit with no dialogue, but
the patient will eventually end up appreciating the music of Andrew
Lloyd Webber. The most moving moment is when the title song "Evita" is
sung. Although Madonna does not have the voice to perform the song to
it's full impact, she manages to hold her notes. In fact watching
Madonna's solid performance as Eva Peron, was perhaps this movie's
greatest surprise. I'm quite shocked that I am actually complimenting
the likes of this pop diva. Maybe it's because she is only allowed to
sing and not speak, which makes her believable as Peron. It's like the
Holly Hunter paradox in "The Piano", where she acts better when she
isn't given any dialogue. Antonio Banderas is ever reliable as the song
and tune narrator who appears at every scene to give the viewers some
perspective on where they are on the Perone timeline. Jonathon Pryce a
talented character actor, fills the shoes of Juan Peron with ease.
So if it wasn't for the fact that I had seen the documentary before the
film, I would have appreciated "Evita" more. Cause every time I saw
Eva on screen, I couldn't help but want to barf at knowing what would
happen to the poor women after she died. Here I go again, where's the
bathroom?

Title
Review for Hilary and Jackie (1998)
Cast: Emily Watson, Rachel Griffiths, David Morrissey, James Frain.
Screenplay: Frank Cottrell Boyce, based on the memoir "A Genius in the
Family" by Hilary and Piers Du Pre.
Producers: Andy Paterson and Nicholas Kent.
Director: Anand Tucker.
1. Horror of horrors, husband sharing! This just does not fall into my
category of happy movie watching, and there isn't even a good reason
(maybe IVF?) for the request (prove that you love me). My response would
be let's go out to lunch', but loaning my life partner to a sibling for
a sexscapade, is not the answer to loneliness. These sisters, as you
could probably imagine are closer than the average, if one gets away
with asking and then granting such a request. However, the husband is
also to blame for agreeing to it in the first place.
2. Let's not get way laid by this issue, because there is more to this
movie besides sharing husbands. That is  sibling rivalry. Yes, and in
this case, the younger sister Jackie goes to great lengths (learning the
chelo) to outdo her older sister Hilary (who plays the flute). Jackie
does eventually outshine Hilary by becoming an international artist,
whilst Hilary fades into the obscurity of family life and love. Which
would you choose? Fame and fortune or settle for the ordinary and being
truly loved for what you are? Most people would probably answer both,
but in many cases one is sacrificed for the other.
3. Spot on acting for both Rachel Griffiths and Emily Watson who bring
to life two sisters who made a promise one summer's day on the beach,
that somehow, in the time of need, they would always be there for one
another, even in death.

Title
Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
Cast: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon,
Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel. Screenplay:
Robert Rodat.
Producers: Steven Spielberg, Ian Bryce, Mark Gordon & Gary Levinsohn.
Director: Steven Spielberg.
This true to war epic must be seen by every generation, to remind us why
we must settle our differences diplomatically, without resorting to
violence. Steven Spielberg once again amazes us with his ability to tell
a story, this time, without manipulating the viewer's emotions. This
movie attempts to explore the soldier's personal, emotional and physical
conflicts in battle, when conscience is constantly being checked by the
questionable acts of war. War has a tendency to blur the fine line
between what is considered right and wrong, mixing black and white into
an awful looking grey. The haunting images of men been slaughtered on
Omaha beach, will not only leave one shell shocked, but it will linger
in your memory for many years to come. There will probably never be
another movie that makes a more poignant point about the value of human
life  even if it is for one man  Private Ryan. This is a movie about
ultimate sacrifice, with no greater love than when one man, or should I
say several men, lay down their life for their brother.

Review for "Odyssey, The" (1997) (mini)
Directed by Andrei Konchalovsky. Cast (in credits order) Armand Assante
- Odysseus; Greta Scacchi - Penelope, Geraldine Chaplin, Jeroen Krabb=E9,
Christopher Lee, Irene Papas, Bernadette Peters - Circe, Eric Roberts,
Isabella Rossellini, Vanessa L. Williams - Calypso. Written by Homer
(poem), Andrei Konchalovsky, Christopher Solimine.
Odysseus the cunning ruler of Ithica, who fought at the sides of
Achilles, and brought about the fall of Troy with his ingenious
contraption - the Trojan Horse. Who defied Poseidon, and claimed the
right of victory over Troy as his own; thus angering the gods and was
cursed for twenty years, never to return to his home land and fair
Penelope.
Dear Odysseus,
A few simple words from a lowly movie critic.
Have you ever heard of the phrase, "I'm sorry, I was wrong."
Obviously not. I guess it takes some people, especially Greek heroes of
the tragic realm, a lot longer to realise that they have made a mistake.
A simple apology would have saved Odysseus, and his crew a lot of
unnecessary demise and heart ache.
"PENELOPE" a non-rhyming poem by Tim Voon.
Penelope, fair Penelope. I weep for you.
Whilst you raised your son alone, and watched your mother-in-law die,
Your stubborn husband was being tossed through and fro on the waves of
destiny.
He claimed to be forever loyal, and loving,
He was in truth having one heck of a time in the bed of Circe (10
years);
When he was through with her, he moved on to Calypso (5 years).
I guess one goddess was not enough to quench his lusty loins.
Fair Penelope, ever true.
You kept your word, and lay not with another man,
If only your Odysseus was as pure, as your sweet, gentle heart.
You deserved better.
Comment: Now lets hear the tale again, Homer Simpson style.

Title
Review for Replacement Killers, The (1998)
This movie is not directed by John Woo, but has Woo written all over it.
There are lots of Woo imitators floating about in celluloid land and
Antoine Fuqua is one of them. Fortunately, he is one of the better ones.
What we have is a mesh of slowed action sequences entangled with rapid
gunfire, the poetic stances of action puppets used to riddle each other
with passing bullets, whilst dressed in dark traditional overcoats now
the trade mark of Hong Kong action movies come to Hollywood. Not to
mention the poor lighting, dark sets, gloomy overcast skies and rainy
nights with a huge numbers of smoke, steam and wind generators and the
resident demolition expert to blow up every available automobile,
building and/or anything which stands or which closely resembles
suchand all in a single breath!
Excuse the static, but the plot goes - Chow/Sorvino (passports) 
Chinese Triad Clash (bullets fly)  Police (too late)  Chow/Sorvino
(family talk)  Triad Clash (lots of explosions)  Police (too late
again)  Chow/Sorvino (Buddha, family, save boy)  Triad Clash (more
bullets and explosions)  Police (Where are they?). Is there a recurring
theme somewhere in here?
The first time I saw Chow Yun Fat was 15 years ago  staring in a
Cantonese soap opera To Catch Good People in a Net'. This soapie had
most people in Hong Kong, Canton and Shang-Hai including all my Aunts
tuned to their TV sets every night. If you've ever seen a Chinese
soapie, you will understand that it is synonymous with the word tragedy.
The point of the entire exercise is to bring grief beyond belief and a
rainstorm of tears to your eyes. I haven't seen any of Chow's movies
between now and then, but I can say he hasn't changed much. Chow's
English isn't very good and fortunately he is given little to say except
for a few monosyllable sentences to express grief, pain or anger. The
lack of dialogue from Chow is otherwise adequately compensated by
Sorvino, gunfire and loud explosions. Mira Sorvino shows us once again
that she is not a babe or actress to be messed with, reprising the tough
girl image first seen in MIMIC.
Overall, this movie has some brilliant action sequences, but is
otherwise too repetitious for my liking.

Title
Review for Great Expectations (1998)
Cast: Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Bancroft, Robert DeNiro, Chris
Cooper, Hank Azaria, Raquel Beaudene, Jeremy Kissner
Director: Alfonso Cuaron
Producer: Art Linson
Screenplay: Mitch Glazer based on the novel by Charles Dickens
When one thinks of GREAT EXPECTATIONS, one thinks of Pip not Finn; Miss
Havisham who incinerates herself in her wedding dress, not a remorseful
Ms Dinsmoor who regrets what she has done; a vindictive, cold Estella
who is unable to love and mostly an unhappy ending.
 The original story may have been a miserable tale about an orphan and a
bratty girl, but that's how Dickens wanted it. Recreating Dickens 90's
style is a dangerous thing. Can we safely say that this is still
Dickens?
Although the jist of the story is much the same, there are elements
which make this story subtly different. Minor annoyances like how Finn's
sister sleeps around then leaves them. A seductive Estella who
eventually mellows into a human being and the implication that Finn and
Estella fall in love in the end, may be enough to make Dickens turn in
his grave. It is as ludicrous as rewriting ROMEO AND JULIET so they live
happily ever after, then still calling it Shakespeare!
If this story were not so closely tied with Dickens, then perhaps it
would not be receiving such harsh criticism. Ethan Hawke is a
charismatic actor and good in his role as Finn, although better in
GATTACA. The seductive Estella, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, works the
camera with looks that could kill. Anne Bancroft is delightful as the
eccentric Ms Dinsmoor, reminiscent of Gloria Swanson in SUNSET
BOULEVARD. Whilst Robert De Niro's puts in a heartfelt performance as
the escaped convict who brings fortune to the young Finn.
Playing around with classical literature is a dangerous thing,
especially if you're going to change the ending.

Title
Review for My Giant (1998)
Cast: Billy Crystal, Gheorghe Muresan, Kathleen Quinlan, Zane Carney,
Steven Seagal, Joss Ackland
Director: Michael Lehmann
Producers: Billy Crystal, Peter Schindler
Screenplay: David Seltzer
Why have Billy Crystal's films been so disappointing of late? I think
the answer lies in the fact that when he plays the main lead  he has a
tendency to be overpowering, like a spilt bottle of perfume in a small
room. The screen is over-permeated with Billy and this is the problem
with MY GIANT. His co-star Gheorge Muresan, is big, but has zero
personality. With nothing to counteract Crystal, it's like he's just
talking to a wall and that's what Billy does in this movie  he talks to
himself.
The fact that giant Gheorge, doesn't carry much charisma or charm, does
not help the cause. The poor darling suffers from acromegally, a
hormonal imbalance that results in overgrowth. We are meant to feel
sorry for his dilemma of being cursed with being big and for his
impossible search for love. Unfortunately, his accent is so thick that
it comes across like a rumble of thunder  vaguely understandable.
The highlight of the movie is undoubtedly Steven Segal. MY GIANT was
badly in need of life, and I started wishing that a Segal action
thriller would take over (not a good sign). Unfortunately, there were no
thrown daggers, kicking heads or gunfire. I badly needed be entertained
and woken from the monotony of the overwhelming, characteristic Crystal
whine. I believe that Billy Crystal does best when he is co-starring and
providing the comic relief for otherwise serious acting. Either that or
hosting the Oscars.

Title
Review for Truman Show, The (1998)
Cast: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Ed Harris, Noah Emmerich, Natascha
McElhone, Holland Taylor, Ted Raymond
Director: Peter Weir
Screenplay: Andrew Niccol
Cinematography: Peter Biziou
In one of the most original and critically acclaimed movies this year,
we have a non-hysterical Jim Carrey in his most thought provoking,
intelligent role to date. This is the way I like Carrey - away from pets
and cable. Peter Weir has mixed a nice cocktail of comedy and drama that
will keep you engrossed throughout the film. The question is whether in
reality, mankind would stoop to this lowest form of entertainment,
watching another man's life fully played out on the TV screen like a
soap opera. It is an obvious invasion of privacy, but highlights our
voyeuristic tendencies and curiosity about the private lives of others.
If this movie carried a theme, it would be the marked abuse of human
rights. In this claustrophobic world a man called Truman is raised in
front of television, under the scrutiny of the producer/director
Christof (Ed Harris) and the world. Truman does not know that his life
has been recorded on camera since birth, but begins to gravely suspect
the possibilities, when his father returns from the dead, a light prop
drops out of the sky and when he is unable to leave town.
Wonderful aspects include how delightfully this movie is filmed, from a
camera like view. It also highlights how blatant advertising has become,
when products are engineered into a live' television show. However, the
story is probably what makes this movie. It is the journey of one man in
search of himself and the need to discover the meaning of the world
around him. His search for true love and need to explore, drives him to
escape the lunacy of his man-imposed prison. It displays the uniqueness
of the human spirit, where no barriers can stop a man from overcoming
the adverse forces that wish to contain him. It is people like Truman
who dream of walking on the moon, flying to the stars, or in Truman's
case  sailing to Fiji.
A well made movie, wonderfully directed by Peter Weir, ingeniously
written by Andrew Niccol and sensitively portrayed by Jim Carrey.
Certainly an Oscar contender for 1999.

Title
Review for Mother (1996/II)
Cast: Albert Brooks, Debbie Reynolds, Rob Morrow Director: Albert Brooks
Producer: Scott Rudin and Herb Nanas Screenplay: Albert Brooks and
Monica Johnson
Forty, single and several failed relationships marks a mid life crisis.
The "male menopause" is no longer a myth. The years begin to show as
pockets of cellulite begin to emerge in the most unusual places; the
receding hair line and bald patch now crowns the once manly follicle
endowed head; the once energetic body slows metabolically until it is
comparably slower than the younger sex. What is there to look forward
to, when the trail left behind is littered with a long succession of
missed opportunities, and the path ahead looks like a much needed face
lift. Moody and slightly depressed, you begin to wander whether you have
achieved anything significant with your life, or will your tombstone
merely say "Here lies Jo Bloggs. He ate, He slept, then He died".
If feeling this way, there are several options. A friend of mine decided
he needed to discover his ancestral roots before he could reclaim his
identity. He travelled to Canada and met up with some distant relatives;
traced his heritage back to England; and discovered a war monument of an
ancestor somewhere in Australia - ironically it was a soldier who got
run down by a car before reaching battle. Anyway, somewhere along this
journey of self-discovery, he found himself again and is now happily
married with 2 children.
The other option, is to follow the context of this movie. Albert Brook's
thoughtful screenplay, suggests that one's problems with sex, life and
relationships are somehow related to your relationship with mother. So
his character, a divorced middle-aged man with writer's block, journeys
home in search of answers. This is an intriguing concept, but too simple
with it's solution. We are forgetting about the paternal part of the
picture, and the important role of sibling rivalry. Otherwise, Debby
Reynold's radiant portrayal as mother is a milestone in her "Golden
Years". She shows strength of character behind a fragile, docile
exterior. Rob Morrow gets to whine again post "Northern Exposure", but
this story belongs to Albert. This movie is a journey of self-discovery
for him in mid-life crisis. Here he finds reasons for why he is, and
after clearing the air with the first woman in his life, moves forward

Review for Object of My Affection, The (1998)
Cast: Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd, John Pankow, Timothy Daly, Amo
Gulinello, Allison Janney, Alan Alda, Nigel Hawthorne
Director: Nicholas Hytner
Producer: Laurence Mark
Screenplay: Wendy Wasserstein based on the novel by Stephen McCauley
There are some things in life that you just can't have, no matter how
much you tear your heart out trying to get it. These include a good seat
on Santa's Reindeer Express, meeting Uncle Walt at Disney land, happily
married men in general, or getting a gay man to change his sexual
orientation in order to marry you. Ladies, spare yourself the
unnecessary heart-breaking, tear-jerking disappointment. Turn your eyes
from the cute guy, flirting with the rugby captain in the change rooms,
and find yourself a dependable, straight guy who will be home in time to
help you set the dinner table. If you persist with the impossible
thought, you will only end up hurting yourself badly against a brick
wall.
Having said this, I have more or less revealed how this movie will end
and sadly, how pointless it becomes. Jennifer Aniston is Nina Borrowski.
Her flat mate, George Hanson (Paul Rudd), a first grade teacher has
recently broken up with his lover, Timothy Daly. Nina and George become
the best of friends (as always), before Nina becomes unexpectedly
pregnant to her casual boyfriend, Vince McBride (John Pankow). When Nina
doesn't want the child to be raised by Vince, but by George, strange
things start happening in Brooklyn. So much so, that George not only
becomes Nina's object of affection, but also her object of fixation.
When George can't return her love, you can't say you didn't try to warn
her!
Part of the reason why many people will not enjoy this movie, is because
of the preconceived notion that this is a romantic comedy. I will be
forward and spare you the heartache, there is no romance and there is
very little comedy. Part of the blame lies with the marketing of this
movie. The billboard poster entails Paul Rudd holding Aniston in a
romantic fashion - implying they fall in love, even though this is not
the case. An innocent bystander, deceived by the billboard into watching
the movie, gets a rude shock when they suddenly realise that this is not
your regular 組uy meets gal' love story.
The plot is jumbled and there is so much bed hoping, that you lose track
of who is whose official partner, and who gets to sleep with whom in
which room. Leaving the viewer extremely confused about everybody's
sexual orientation by the end of the movie. It certainly isn't as
bizarre as CHASING AMY, but when Paul Rudd kisses Amo Gulinello, a lot
of the women gasped with shock. Like they weren't pre-warned that guys
actually kiss guys, in a movie where half the characters are gay - once
again an error on the part of marketing.
If you're feeling sorry for yourself, don't mope alone. Join Jennifer
Aniston and you can't both wallow together, at not being able to obtain
the object of your affections.

Review for Alien: Resurrection (1997)
Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, Dan
Hedaya, J. E. Freeman, Brad Dourif, Michael Wincott. Screenplay: Joss
Whedon. Director: Jean-Pierre Jeunet.
In this resurrection of alien carnage only a handful will survive the
acid test of death. If nightmares could be personified in a living
creature, then whisper the word Alien. Through the miraculous wonders of
cloning we are represented with a newly revived Queen Alien and a
healthier, more robust Ripley. These two mothers who are perpetually on
heat are armed to the teeth, and when it comes down to a dogfight they
really know how to bitch.
The role of Ripley fits Sigourney Weaver as tightly as Indiana Jones has
become synonymous with Harrison Ford. She was made to battle Aliens and
come out smirking. Without her the family gathering would never be the
same. Once again Weaver does her sex proud as she claims the position of
dominant female and takes charge of the situation when aliens start
misbehaving. Unfortunately, the new Queen Alien is not as feisty as
reputed and it will suffice to say that she does a very maternal thing
towards the end of the movie.
The big question on every ones mind is how does this movie compare to
its predecessors? It is not as suspenseful as ALIEN, not as thrilling as
ALIENS and not as outright awful as ALIEN3. Writer Joss Whedon has
decided to mix the popular elements of the previous three movies into
his script. We're back on a research vessel with only a handful of crew
still on board, regenerating the claustrophobic feeling created in
ALIEN. The crew are once again grossly outnumbered and hunted down by a
pack of bloodthirsty aliens as introduced by James Cameron in ALIENS. As
for the other characters beside Ripley and the Queen, they are an
assorted rat bag of space scum, not too dissimilar to the inmates of
ALIEN3. The real fun comes in guessing who is going to have their head
bitten of next. Let's just say if you're not mutilated, mutated, robotic
or crippled  you have a pretty good chance of becoming monster chomp.
In terms of the general feel of the movie. The suspense is greatest when
the aliens are still caged and waiting to escape. After this it becomes
standard running about, with only a few memorable scenes worth
mentioning. Let's just say the aliens are graceful swimmers and I would
like to have them on my water ballet squad. As for acrobatics, I like a
man who can shoot a gun hanging upside down. The ending is not as
spectacular as the 1986 showdown between Ripley and the Queen, not as
melodramatic as the 1992 Ripley throwing herself into an inferno, but it
carries a lot more suck than the 1979 version of vacuuming the beast
into to space. If you're wandering what I mean - think about eating
spaghetti through a straw.

Review for Maximum Revenge (1997)
Directed by Fred Olen Ray
Cast Paul Michael Robinson, John Lazar, Landon Hall, Neil Delama, J.C.
Johnson, Arthur Roberts
Written by Sean O'Bannon
Misrepresenting the content of a film is an unpardonable mistake in my
book of movie viewing. In this instance the crime is in reference to the
movie capsule on the jacket of a video. The error in this case, is so
obvious, that whoever wrote it, obviously did not watch the film. It
states that five prisoners on death row have been placed in the latest
state of the art penitentiary; they must survive against a group of
terrorists who have taken over the complex. In actual fact, the
death-row-in-mates are merely petty thieves, political extremists,
fraudulent, a rapist and a cop wrongly convicted of a crime. The most
annoying fact is that the highly publicised MAXIMUM SECURITY prison, is
merely an empty block of offices. The security tower has multi-access
from open corridors, making this the most insecure prison I have ever
seen. Amusingly, the erotic sex scenes are also very badly timed ie A
cop (Paul Michael Robinson) and female reporter  (Landon Hall) are
trying to escape the prison, with terrorists hot in their pursuit. A
nuclear bomb is about to explode on timer, a rapist stands guard outside
the kitchen, whilst the two heroes' spend a good ten minutes of the
viewer's time making salami in the kitchen!
Since the success of TERMINATOR in 1982, there has been a-dime-a-dozen
release of similar clones hitting the video shelf. Usually, they entail
the presence of an indestructible machine/monster +\- the elements of
time travel and changing futures. None to memory have been comparable.
TIME UNDER FIRE, is such a movie. A submarine travelling through the
Bermuda Triangle? Suddenly hits a time\water continuum and are
conveniently transported into the future. The future is bleak and
hostile place, and mankind is suffering under the evil totalitarian rule
of a mad man. Sound familiar? So the mission is to basically get back to
the past, murder the man responsible for the catastrophe and set the
future right. The outstanding elements of this film was not how
unoriginal it was, but how the blood on the dead men looked like spilt
paint, and how the machine gun fire rattled unprofessionally like
firecrackers.

Review for Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain, The (1995)
Cast: Hugh Grant, Colm Meaney, Tara Fitzgerald, Ian McNeice, Kenneth
Griffith, Ian Hart, Robert Pugh Director: Christopher Monger Screenplay:
Christopher Monger based on the story told by Ivor Monger
We all have our unique quirks and obsessions; but when it comes to what
is considered a hill, and what is considered a mountain, the Welsh win
hands down. People have fought and died over less, so let's give this
tale of metric measurements a twenty foot chance.
'Ffynnon Garw' Welsh hill turned mountain, or mountain turned hill
(depending on the change of seasons or it's human residents), is twenty
feet short of one thousand. So guess what the community does about it?
Toil, sweat and buckets of dirt; a dead priest, a coffin at its peak,
and of course enough soil to allow 'The English Man' (Hughes) to walk
down a mountain.
This is not a particularly exciting, or well made film. But if ever
interested in a bit of Welsh history, or the joining of human effort -
T.E.M.W.W.U.A.H.B.C.D.A.M. is for you.
Comment: Not Mount Everest but still a pretty hill.

Title
Review for In & Out (1997)
Cast: Kevin Kline, Tom Selleck, Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Debbie
Reynolds, Wilford Brimley, Bob Newhart, Shalom Harlow Director: Frank Oz
Screenplay: Paul Rudnick
This comedy about coming out is in many ways both right and wrong. It
supposes that a man in his thirties, who has remained a closet
homosexual for most of life, needs to come out and announce to the world
that he is gay  on his wedding day. My point is we don't see the
average heterosexual needing to affirm their sexuality on their wedding
day, even when there has been a sudden change of heart. I don't think
the words I'm sorry I can't marry you but I'm straight by the by' are
in any ways familiar. So why does Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) a
clean-cut, neat, prissy looking bachelor feel the urge to stage a
fanfare of excitement before his wedding? The business of coming out'
is as baffling as it comes. We don't see heterosexuals needing to affirm
their sexual orientation to friends and family, so why does a homosexual
need to. You're either straight or gay and some fall in the shades
between, but really it's your own business wherever you lie.
So it comes as a big surprise to all concerned when Howard Brackett
(Kevin Kline), ordinary schoolteacher of Green Leaf Indiana, is
pronounced gay at the Academy Awards. Kline's wonderful comic talents
are used to highlight the none-to-subtle stereotyping of gay men. The
floppy hand gestures, tilted stance, Streisand loving, music funking
demeanour are entertainingly underlined by Kline, but I'm sure that
these quirks are not true of all gay men. Unfortunately most of this
movie's most humorous scenes are overexposed in the trailer, and if
you've seen the trailer once too often there isn't much to look forward
to in the movie.
Of note is the 20-30 second, much talked about kiss between Kline and
Tom Selleck. The audience gasps with shock, but soon the moment is swept
to the back of the mind along with any embarrassment it may have caused.
Really there wasn't much to see to begin with. There was no licking
tongues rolling about, no undue smooching or necking, no heavy
breathing. It just looked like too grown men giving each other mouth to
mouth from a distance  not a defining hot kiss by any means. Then
there's a rather amusing discussion between schoolboys about the In'
and Out' holes. That in-holes are meant for putting things in and
out-holes are not. So what do you do for a severely constipated person
in need of a good enema?
In Conclusion, IN AND OUT is not the hilarious comedy that I had hoped
it would be. However a good point is made at the end, when the whole
town announces they are a gay to down the fallacy that homosexuality is
an infectious disease. Perhaps next time more fun could be generated
from a gay man suddenly realising he's straight  that way we can
explore the themes surrounding the cupboard heterosexual  they wear
ties, carry mobile phones and like to listen to the artist formerly
known as Prince.

Review for People vs. Larry Flynt, The (1996)
Cast: Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, Edward Norton, James Cromwell,
Crispin Glover, Brett Harrelson, James Carville, Donna Hanover, Richard
Paul Director: Milos Forman Screenplay: Scott Alexander and Larry
Karaszewski
The First Amendment. It's a wonderful way of life when an ideal as
powerful as freedom itself, is allowed to protect and represent the
American people. However, when this unique law of the forefathers is
used and abused by the likes of Larry Flynt, then something beautiful
and natural, has become polluted by the fumes of the depraved and
amoral.
The issues begin with pornography and Larry's freedom to express his
views. I won't debate this point; but when Larry uses  his freedom to
fraudulently defame others, I cannot and will not side with him. His
utter contempt for the court and justices also becomes evident at every
hearing; when Larry needs to take centre stage in his shameless mockery
of the establishment.
Larry Flynt, "Hill Billy" child of misplaced dreams who,
Mounted only to sleaze and hustle, greed and "girly" bustle,
Whose claim to fame rests with spitting in righteous face,
Whose grievous deed protected by righteous grace,
Mock and laugh at Her Lady's Laws,
Rape and desecrate her first and most precious gift,
But True Freedom comes only to those who respect it,
Not to those who misuse and abuse it.
So the same law which guide and protect the innocent, need also turn a
blind eye to Larry Flynt. Although Lady Justice herself is prevented
from spitting back at this foul-mouthed monstrosity, this will not
shield Flynt from the contempt of others who have witnessed a
desecration of the First Amendment. No sympathy points for this lonely,
bitter, angry old man, who has pit himself against God, the world and
the goodness of life.
Solid performances by Woody Harrelson whose choice of "smutty" roles
"King Pin", "Natural Born Killers" etc. seem to have become his forte.
Courtney Love, a queen of the fast lane, instinctively knows how to
recreate the likes of Althea Leisure.

Title
Review for Cop Land (1997)
I like a man who isn't afraid to show his weight, look scruffy and worn
down by the ills of society. He walks about with a dogged look on his
face, at first blindly obeying his master's dodgy whims, turning a deaf
ear to the suspicious cries of organised crime. It would appear that
this sheriff who would be a cop, has been beaten into submission by the
forces above him, until that something timely snaps within. This is a
man who isn't macho' or even an action hero', but an ordinary man
trying to find meaning in his upside down world where nothing is as it
seems. I like this new Sylvester Stallone in his apparently first
non-egotistical role.
Following in the same vein as LA CONFIDENTIAL, COP LAND discusses all
the wonderful issues about corrupt police officers - the people who
society despises most. Headed by Harvey Keitel, this Mob/Cop syndicate
has made a safe haven for itself in a small town outside NY. In this
white washed community cops live peacefully side by side, but beneath
the calm exterior fury boils as they sleep with each others wives,
quibble amongst themselves and even kill their own when their community
is threatened. So the joy of the story arises from good eventually
prevailing over evil, and the once beaten Sheriff (Stallone) awakening
to his better self. Where like a faithful wounded dog, he'll keep coming
at you right till the very end.
The star studded cast is almost too numerous to mention, but there are
fine performances from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Annabella Sciorra,
Janeane Garofalo who play the other major leads. It almost seems like a
family reunion for American Italian actors come to make a spaghetti
meatball picture. Not as good or heartfelt as LA CONFIDENTIAL, but still
a movie which is worth an honourable mention. Worthwhile viewing
overall.

Title
Review for Game, The (1997)
Cast: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn,
Anna Katerina, Armin Mueller-Stahl Director: David Fincher Producer:
Cean Chaffin, Steve Golin Screenplay: John D. Brancato, Michael Ferris,
Andrew Kevin Walker
I found myself shaking my head continously at the absurdity of "The
Game", so much so that I developed a neck sprain. The director David
Fincher has tried to recreate the confusing "twist" and "turns" which
made his other movie "7" a success. If you like this sort of film that's
fine, but trying to keep the material believable is much harder. There
are numerous examples of how badly wrong, or how dangerous "The Game"
could have become. The prime example is Michael Douglas jumping of the
roof top towards the end, now tell me how did they know where to place
the cushions exactly?? Ooops a spoiler, but I don't recommend you watch
the movie either.
If you're wandering what I'm talking about at this point in time, I'm
not referring to Monopoly, Backgammon or Chess. Although all of these
games are much more fun to play than this particularly elaborate game.
Basically, it is the 42nd birthday of wealthy millionaire Nicholas Van
Orten (Michael Douglas). He is given a virtual gift from his unsuccesful
younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn). The surprise is that the gift
unravels itself in the form of daily experiences, encounters and strange
coincidences, which become weirder and more dangerous the longer you
play.
I didn't like "7" and I don't like this movie. It is disguised as an
elaborate excuse to thrill, when all it provides is a nervous twitch.
Talk about over working a person's paranoia. If my brother decided to
throw me a bash as stupid as this, I wouldn't hesitate to shoot him; and
I would be a hell of a lot angrier than Michael Douglas. Somehow, I
don't think being shot at, being drugged, being chased by dogs, being
drowned, being buried alive, being lost in a foreign country without
cash is very much fun. The only life changing experience "The Game"
provides is a nervous break down, not a hearty thank-you. Next time, a
simple birthday card will suffice instead.

Title
Review for That Old Feeling (1997)
Cast: Bette Midler, Dennis Farina, Paula Marshall, Danny Nucci, Gail
O'Grady, David Rasche, Jamie Denton Director: Carl
Reiner Screenplay: Leslie Dixon
A warning. The review you are about to read will feature mood swings
not too dissimilar to those expressed by Midler and cast throughout
this laborious labour of love (the movie).
HATE: is the basis. A failed marriage, divorce and a illegitimate
daughter (Marshall) fourteen years ago. The players. The author father
(Farina) who slept with the interior decorator before marrying
her. The movie star mother (Midler) who slept with the marriage
counsellor before marrying him. HAPPINESS: when newlyweds. The
illegitimate daughter is to wed a promising young congress man. This
is soon followed by FEAR: when she has to invite her parents to the
wedding. ANGER: at a photographer who keeps taking 'fat pictures' of
the movie star mother.  JEALOUSY: when the movie star mother keeps
making 'liposuction' jokes about the interior decorator with much
tit-a-tat.  RAGE: as the bride's parents attempt to strangle each
other at the wedding reception. LUST: when car-rocking sex occurs
between the bride's parents outside the reception. DISMAY: when the
adulterous pair run off with each other, leaving the interior
decorator and marriage counsellor to sulk. This is followed by more
LUST, HATE, ANGER, REJECTION, GUILT, LUST, HATE, LUST, LUST, RAGE,
RAGE, LUST, HATE, LUST, HATE, RAGE, RAGE - Hey are you all beginning
to feel the beat of the movie?
This movie is an overload of confusing, schizophrenic emotions. The
audience is not allowed to settle into any particular mood or feel for
the movie, because of the tumulus over the top, hysterical shift of
emotions displayed between Midler and Farino.  They are either
persistently yelling at each other or kissing each other; and the
scary thing is that you never now when the mood is going to swing from
RAGE to LUST. If the director Carl Reiner was intending to make the
movie unpredictable with these overly-exaggerated personifications of
character, he has missed the plot, and achieved the unthinkable by
making his characters REPREHENSIBLE.
I am a great fan of Midler's work, but her character in this movie is
purely loud, without self-control. It is also partly the fault of the
script which lacks true witty dialogue. I don't know much about
Farina, but it is suffice to say he's a loud Italian. However, some
charm and redemption was brought to this movie by the petite,
delightful performance of Paula Marshall as the confused daughter. I
mean who wouldn't be confused after witnessing your parents display
such ABHORRENT shifts of temperament.
So which of these overused 'Old Feelings' could this movie possibly be
referring to? Could it possibly be LOVE? Well if memory serves
correctly - this is the one feeling mercifully forgotten by the
moronic handlings of director, cast and crew involved with this
pathetic fiasco of emotions. If you failed to get the 'feeling' of my
words, I was attempting to express great DISPLEASURE.
Comment: Air these negative, bottled up feelings somewhere else.
Feeling Scale: 0% *PAINFUL* / Indifference / Love 100%

Title
Review for Trial and Error (1997)
Cast: Michael Richards, Jeff Daniels, Charlize Theron, Austin Pendleton,
Jessica Steen, Rip Torn, Alexandra Wentworth Director: Jonathan Lynn
Screenplay: Gregory Bernstein, Sara Bernstein, and Cliff Gardner
Needless to say crazy Kramer (Michael Richards), without smart mouth
Jerry, big mouth Elaine and dumb arse George is very much like a fish
out of water. Michael Richards first feature film as the male lead is a
major disappointment. Probably because his character, an out of sorts
actor impersonating a lawyer is not well defined or likeable. Richards
cannot make up his mind about whether he still wants to be Kramer or a
more regular guy, and the result is something of a half-poached egg.
Part of the problem may rest in the fact that Richard's face has become
synonymous with Seinfeld's Kramer, and it is difficult to picture him
otherwise. A big plus when his talented zaniness lights up the small
screen, but a big minus when he attempts a role outside what we are
accustomed to. Jeff Daniel's comic talent was evident opposite Jim Carey
in "Dumb and Dumber", but he alone cannot make up for the three missing
stooges. It's as if the ghosts of George, Jerry and Elaine are haunting
the set, wishing to make an appearance, but sadly do not.
So this overdrawn tale of an actor impersonating a lawyer with a moral
ending, would have fared better as a shorter, much-ado-about-nothing
episode of Seinfeld. In which case we would have all four clowns of
situational comedy together on screen, and that would generate more
laughs than if one were sitting alone.

Title
Review for Wild Things (1998)
Cast: Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, Theresa Russell, Denise
Richards, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Carrie Snodgress, Jeff Perry, Robert
Wagner, Bill Murray
Director: John McNaughton
Screenplay: Stephen Peters
The sound of drums beat heavily in time with the throb of jungle life
thrashing in the Florida swamps. The lustful note of this movie opens to
the angry snap of alligator jaws, as wild things sound their mating
call. The scent of pheromones lingers in the tepid air of the humid
climate. However, the animals aren't caged or lurking in the nearby
jungle, instead, they exist in a civilised community of man made wealth
next door  Blue Bay Florida.
The elite in the Bay dine at exclusive clubs, fuck who they wish and buy
what they want. A philanthropic school counsellor, Guy Lombardo (Matt
Dillon) who has done too many rounds, gets accused of raping two
schoolgirls. One is a drug addict and school misfit (Neve Campbell); the
other is the daughter (Denise Richards) of a prominent Bay family. What
follows is a series of bizarre twist and turns, literally both in bed
and in death, which will keep you guessing till the end.
Some people may find the unpredictable style of this movie to their
liking. However, it can also be annoyingly and unbelievable, to reach
the end only to be rudely awakened by three successive changes of plot.
Which in ways is reminiscent of the SCREAM franchise, which relies
heavily on the ferocious unpredictability of the story line.
If you haven't seen Matt Dillon (IN AND OUT) in a while, be prepared to
see a lot of him in this movie. He gets to show how talented he is in
bed and how group therapy poses no problems in his acting department.
Neve Campbell (SCREAM), has fallen into a genre of shlock, shock and now
sex movies, and her role in this movie is merely wild and depraved.
Whilst Miss Goody-Two-Shoes, Denise Richards (STARSHIP TROOPERS), plays
out her school girl fantasies in the most adult sort of a way. Then
there is also Theresa Russell, who also gets her share of bedtime.
Lots of raunchy sex which may or may not be therapeutic.

Review for Fled (1996)
Cast: Laurence Fishburne, Stephen Baldwin, Salma Hayek, Will Patton,
Robert John Burke, Victor Rivers, Robert Hooks, David Dukes, Brittney
Powell Director: Kevin Hooks Screenplay: Preston A. Whitmore 2d.
I don't know about you, but if two convicts (Fishburne and Baldwin),
handcuffed to each other jumped into my car, and ordered me to take them
home at gun point, I'd be wetting my pants. However, we have to hand it
to Salma Hayek for handling the situation very calmly, before
nonchalantly staring them in the eye and agreeing to their demands with
only the slightest of fuss. By the end of the short trip home, she has
these lawless men carrying groceries into her house, politely asking for
a shower in her bathroom, and wearing her ex-husband's baggy clothes.
What next? A marriage proposal?
That's right, a marriage proposal. Except the exchange of wedding vows
is between our two escaped convicts\heroes. It's an unofficial wedding,
with no guests except the police, and the cuffs symbolize the wedding
bands. There is no one to witness this binding contract except for God,
but who cares about the finer details when 5 million dollars is
involved. So this is vaguely how the vows go from memory.
'You see these chains, it means we're married.' Fishburne.
'Oh, yeah.' Baldwin.
'Yeah. For Better or worse. In sickness and in health. So you better do
what I say or I'll hit you.' Fisburne.
Baldwin punches Fishburne. Fishburne punches Baldwin back harder.
'Please don't hit me.' Baldwin.
'Why not?' Fishburne.
'Because I've got five million, and I'll give you one million.' Baldwin.
'Okay, stop hitting me. I'll give you half. It's settled then.' Baldwin.
'Till death do us part.' Fishburne punches Baldwin. 'Now it's settled.'
Sigh. They sure don't make romantic comedies like they use to.

Title
Review for Jackal, The (1997)
Cast: Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, Sydney Poitier, Diane Venora, Mathilda
May, Tess Harper Director: Michael Caton-Jones Screenplay: Chuck Pfarrer
based on the motion picture screenplay THE DAY OF THE JACKAL by Kenneth
Ross
If I could sum this movie into a single word, it would be SLOW. If I had
the pleasure of renaming THE JACKAL it would become THE TURTLE. I
haven=92t seen an action thriller with so little action and so few thrill=
s
since the days I was a connoisseur of budget movies made for television.
Even with two popular stars like Willis and Gere, this movie still
suffers from a lack of charisma, charm and character. It=92s hard to pump
life into this dead animal of a movie, when the only thing going for it
is an overdone scavenger hunt between two middle-aged Hollywood stars.
The plot is simple. Assassin extraordinare, THE JACKAL (Willis) has been
contracted to kill somebody important. When I found out who it was, I
yawned and went back to snooze. This movie is so quiet that you could
have a good 45 minute nap between the 1st and 2nd bullet, a 30 minute
doze between the 2nd and 3rd bullet, before finally being rudely awoken
by a sudden spurt of loud explosions, frenzied firing and frantic
screaming. Some people would say save the best till last, I call it post
mature ejaculation =96 too loud and very messy.
In this movie Bruce baby doesn=92t have to worry about the missing hairs
on his head, or the flab on his tum. He is THE JACKAL, the man with a
hundred faces, a thousand smiles, a million disguises, but hey Bruce
you=92ll never fool us into believing you=92re a Super Model. His nemesis=
,
IRA sharp shooter Gere, is as authentic as serving somebody Earl Grey
when they asked for Irish Coffee =96 sadly miscast.
In conclusion, THE JACKAL is as mysterious as a fart in a crowded room,
as action packed as pointing a finger at an unsuspecting victim and as
thrilling as getting away with it. A very disappointing effort overall.

Review for Devil's Own, The (1997)
Cast: Harrison Ford, Brad Pitt, Margaret Colin, Ruben Blades, Treat
Williams, George Hearn, Natascha McElhone Director: Alan J. Pakula
Screenplay: David Aaron Cohen & Vincent Patrick and Kevin Jarre based on
a story by Kevin Jarre
Why does an Irish tale need to have a sad ending, when Irish jokes carry
such moronic light heartedness? Probably because the IRA is no Irish man
joke or simple laughing matter. Yes, this is a sad tale indeed. When a
Irish lad (Brad Pitt) watches his father murdered before his eyes, he is
forced to choose between forgetting or fighting back. In his world gone
mad, he chooses to fight and exists only to strike again. In his living
nightmare there are no winners or losers, only an ever rising death
count. Revenge has an insatiable thirst for blood.
The boy grows into a man, and the man becomes a soldier in the Irish
Republican Army. His journey leads him to the land of opportunities,
where he must purchase weapons of warfare with which to hurt the enemy.
Under the pretence of immigration, he finds board with the family of
Irish policeman, Thomas O'Meara (Harrison Ford). Here he finds the
father he lost, but can they remain friends? A fox cannot befriend a
hound, as one is governed by the laws of instinct and the other by man.
So the hunt begins, and the chase is intense, but we always know how the
hunt will end.
So let me lighten this sad tale with an Irish Joke or two.
Why did the Irish man build a boat?
So he could carry some missiles across the Atlantic to blow up the
British.
What did the Irish cop do with his bad conscience?
He shot a friend through the heart.
Okay, okay so it's not very funny, but I'm not in the mood. Fine
performances from a brooding Brad Pitt and ageing Harrison Ford, in this
sad tale of Irish sorts. Anyone for some after dinner mints?

Review for Flubber (1997)
Cast: Robin Williams, Marcia Gay Harden, Christopher McDonald, Raymond
Barry, Clancy Brown, Ted Levine, Wil Wheaton, Edie McClurg, voice of
Jodi Benson Director: Les Mayfield Screenplay: John Hughes and Bill
Walsh
In this Disney offering for Christmas, our children are presented with
the latest in technological goo  FLUBBER i.e. flying rubber. Like most
John Hughes movies he is out to entertain the juvenile masses with his
usual slapstick style of mayhem-come-hurt-em comicness. How many laughs
can be generated from flying bowling balls repeatedly rebounding off
somebody's head? Lot's - that's if you're underage for both TITANIC and
TOMMOROW NEVER DIES. The standard of comedy reaches the profound heights
of FLUBBER shooting through the digestive system of an individual,
before exploding out the poop shoot in a spectacular display of
fireworks. It's the kind of grade six humour where farts, burps and
bodily sounds sends kids into a state of uproar; and perhaps the sought
of humour which should be left in the privacy of a classroom.
Sadly, our children are taught nothing from this movie. They are
undeniably entertained but no lesson is learnt. Where are those
wonderful holiday children's movies like BABE, MATILDA, A LITTLE
PRINCESS where entertainment and learning are rolled into one. Instead
our children are introduced to abstract adult themes like Cybersex. I
found the topic particularly fascinating, having a particularly close
relationship with my own computer, but this is not your everyday topic
for show and tell.
In this movie two females, a college professor (Sara Jane Reynolds) and
a flying robot Weebo, vie for the love of an absent-minded scientist
(Robin Williams). The robot in question projects an image of a woman in
a nightie before entering the bedroom of her master to plant a kiss on
his lips. When the robot in question awaits death, she tells the
scientist of her secret love for him and also about the love child
carrying a bit of both of them inside it. When it comes to sex, children
always want to know how and why. So how does a parent explain to a young
child that computers and humans can't copulate? Just when you thought
you hit home run with your lessons on the birds and the bees, here comes
a puzzling scenario of a computer with claims to immaculate conception.
How to tie it in with the Christmas Story?
FLUBBER isn't a poorly made children's movie by any means, it's just not
a very good one. Robin Williams plays second fiddle to the flying
elastic compound and sadly loses every scene to the special effects
department. The super goo that has a life force of its own and makes
possible the impossible, is also every bit the fluffy material daydreams
are made off. It comes as a big let down when you finally wake up to
reality and realise that the chemistry experiment has just blown up in
your face - very disappointing overall.

Review for Mimic (1997)
Cast: Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam, Charles Dutton, Giancarlo Giannini,
F. Murray Abraham, Josh Brolin, Alexander Goodwin Director: Guillermo
Del Toro Screenplay: John Sayles, Steven Soderbergh, Matthew Robbins
Ever thumped a fat bug with a book, and then watch it's insides splatter
on the wallpaper? It's the kind of sight that generally grosses people
out so I personally prefer spraying the bug to death. It's hands free,
hygienic and compact. Why swat the fly when you can fry it with
chemicals. This brings me to my point on the big, bad ugly bugs known as
the Judas breed. Once the salvation of mankind but now it's demise.
Mutated and evolved in a period of three years into horrific flying
creatures breeding in the murky depths of a city sewer and feeding
silently on fleshy prey. So if you're a fly swatter and not a bug
sprayer - this movie is for you. Imagine the juicy remains on wall or
book. Imagine a lot of it. Then imagine wiping the bug insides over
yourself over and over again. In "Mimic" the key to survival is the
perfume of bug slime, and the aroma of death is none other than human
blood.
Now imaging a spider in a feeding frenzy, or a preying mantis cleverly
dissecting its prey with razor sharp jaws. Now magnify this picture by a
hundred times and watch this enormous bug rip apart several children,
several cops, several homeless people, somebody's father and a homeless
Reverend. My query - was it really necessary to slaughter the boys - it
rather defeats the purpose of an innocent bug hunt. AND is it ethical to
murder a father in front of his son's eyes?  It isn't everyday that we
are made to see a child watch his father pierced with scissor-like fangs
and have his blood splatter over him.  It's a rather sloppy and
insensitive scene if you ask me. The father reaches out for his child
and before you know it - splat - lots of holes through the torso and
blood foaming at the mouth. How does a child respond to this?
So despite this movie's wanton thirst for blood, bug poop and
fascination with bug insides, it does create a confused and fascinating
story about the web of life. This time we are the prey and the insect
are the predator. It gives as a different perspective on life when the
giants are insects, and it's their turn to wreak revenge on humans who
wouldn't give two hoots to another bug gone under the boot. The heroine
(Mira Sorvino) does a good job faking terror, as she is privileged
enough to face the male drone in hand to hand combat and win -
politically correct. As for the our Hero (Jeremy Northam), who was the
dashing Mr Knightley in Emma, is present dashing about this movie
blowing up the female bugs which is not so politically correct. Also our
Hero and Heroine are trying to reproduce and are having great difficulty
conceiving a child despite repeated attempts. The writer's solution to
this problem is kill the autistic kid's father, make him an orphan,
place him in the middle of the hive and somebody will just have to adopt
him - I wonder who?
So I really should have hated this movie more for all the above reasons,
but somehow, I didn't and I don't know why. For some unexplained reason
my fascination with the big bad insect kept me interested throughout.
Personally I would have liked to spray the six legged vermin from a
distance, being a "Mortein" kind of a guy; but I guess on occasion I
won't mind getting my hands dirty, and slapping a bug or two around for
recreational purposes.

Review for Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)
Cast: Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Arliss Howard,
      Peter Stormare, Pete Postlethwaite, Richard Schiff,
      Vanessa Lee Chester, Richard Attenborough
Director: Steven Spielberg
Producers: Jerry Molen, Colin Wilson
Screenplay: David Koepp based on the novel by Michael Crichton
Cinematography: Janusz Kaminski
Music: John Williams
U.S. Distributor: Universal Pictures
What else can I say so much already has been said about this movie?
But despite all of its wows and hypes there are some problems with it
that I just have to point out.
Firstly, a PG rating
Hmmmm I wonder how the kids responded to T-Rex ripping a man in half (I
mean it was all there to see, believe me Spielberg didn't hold back on
that one) or those carnivorous, 'hyena' like, tiny little dinosaurs
attacking a little girl, or hunting down a man in packs. Just wandering
if they inspire nightmares?
Then there's cute baby T-rex who has his leg broken and needs plastering
from those crazy scientists. Mom and Dad T-Rex soon come to the rescue
and before you know it, baby T-rex is free and a couple of scenes down
the track is running around quite happily (without the plaster) and
capable of feasting on a man (not so cute any more).
Then one of the scientists unloads the bullets of the guns of one of the
hunters, knowing quite well that T-Rex is on the hunt for them. Was he
hoping to make friends????????
Otherwise, Stephen Spielberg has done what he achieved with the original
Jurassic Park another dinosaur epic.
Those who like the original Jurassic will undoubtedly also like this
movie and will rate at least an 8/10
Those who didn't will probably give it a 6/10

Title
Review for Othello (1995)
Cast: Laurence Fishburn, Irene Jacob, Kenneth Branagh, Nathaniel Parker,
Michael Maloney Director: Oliver Parker Screenplay: Oliver Parker based
on the play by William Shakespeare Cinematograpy
Would you think your wife was having an affair with your best friend, if
you saw him with her handkerchief?
That's an unfair question. Handkerchiefs were probably significant items
of clothing in the days of Shakespeare, and this in particular, was a
special handkerchief. So let's rephrase the question.
Would you think your wife was having an affair with your best friend, if
you saw him with her panties?
I probably would not, because women's underclothing all look alike to
me, BUT Othello would.
Othello (Fishburne), the greatest general of his time, the respected
governor of Cyprus whose one failing was jealousy. Fed by the subtle
lies of Iago (Branagh), Othello is led to believe that his wife (Jacob)
is having an affair with his lieutenant (Parker). He is driven into such
a jealous rage that he has convulsions thinking about it (I didn't know
that Othello was an epileptic?). One can only be as jealous as much as
one loves, and Othello was jealous enough to kill his wife.
This is not one of the better adaptations of Shakespeare to screen. I'm
biased because I personally prefer Shakespeare performed as a play.
Nevertheless, the lesson must be taught, that jealousy breeds contempt,
and if you're having marital problems - seek a marriage counsellor or
you may end up with four dead bodies on your bed.
Strong performances from Fishburne, Branagh and the rest of the cast.
Comment: Shakespeare at his morbid best.

Title
Review for Jungle2Jungle (1997)
Cast: Tim Allen, Sam Huntington, JoBeth Williams, Lolita Davidovich,
Martin Short, David Ogden Stiers, Bob Dishy Director: John Screenplay:
Bruce Evans and Raynold Gideon
How deep can the relationship between a father and son truly be? When
one is repeatedly called 'Baboon' and the other is named 'Mimu-Siku',
which literally means cat piss!
The level of this new Tim Allen comedy is as superficial as its idiotic
name calling. The humour is based on jokes involving blow guns used to
kill flies, moronic Russian Mafia, anaesthetised cats, and the dietary
habits of 'Mimu-Siku'; who shoots pigeons, eats tropical fish, and cat
food when denied the cat.
By far the most interesting character is the hairy, pet tarantula who
uses its radio sonic abilities to hunt its prey. What Tim Allen, and
every other character needs is a good bite from this spider, both to
wake them up and prevent  the audience from lapsing into a undeserved
coma.

Title
Review for Desperado (1995)
Cast: Antonio Bandaras, Salma Hayek, Joaquim de Almeida, Steve Buscemi,
Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino Director: Robert Rodriguez Screenplay:
Robert Rodriguez
I like a man who goes to confession, after he's just killed thirty drug
dealers in one of the noisiest gunfight, showdowns I have seen on
screen.
The sound of ricocheting bullets is still ringing in my ears, days after
I finished watching this movie; and the amount of ketchup splashing from
mouths, noses and puncture wounds, would have made the tomato industry
very happy.
Give me a Marguerita, light me a Cuban cigar and put on the 'Gypsy
Kings', and you have for yourself 'Desperado'.
Ooops! I forgot to mention, also bring along your arsenal of explosives
in a guitar case; your ten millimetre machine gun in another guitar
case; your secret rocket launcher in yet another guitar case; your
heroin in the guitar; your little boy who carries the guitar with the
dope; your librarian who stashes dope for the heroin dealer; the beer
that tastes like piss; and two brothers who are as different as night
and day.

Title
Review for George of the Jungle (1997)
Cast: Brendan Fraser, Leslie Mann, Thomas Haden Church, Greg Cruttwell,
Abraham Benrubi, voice of John Cleese, voice of Keith Scott Director:
Sam Weisman Screenplay: Dana Olsen, Audrey Wells
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!"
I didn't think a theme song could be this contagious until I found
myself humming it for breakfast, lunch and tea.
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEE!"
Yep. I've caught Jungle fever, God help me. Not long after George
started swinging, I felt the incredible urge to throw of all shy
reservation and self restraint, strip out of coat and tie, throw on a
loin cloth and swing from vine to vine. There's nothing quite like the
feel of flying through air, only to be stopped by the incredible jolt of
a large tree trunk. The feel of wood smashing against skin and bone,
shattering the vertebrate, the splinters embedding in the soft tissue of
tongue and cheek, the missing teeth .... I'm getting carried away!
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEE!"
As a decent, respectable citizen of this earth, I found myself laughing
at excrement jokes, painful male gonad jokes and self inflicted, bodily
harm jokes? Maybe it was because Jim Carrey was absent, and Brendan
Fraser present that made the slapstick so much more palatable. This
likeable portrayal of "George" by Brendan, carries with it the innocence
of a child, the pectorals of a Man, and other well proportioned parts
desired by Woman. Yes ladies, stop gawking - tongue in, close that jaw.
We've all got what he's got, more or less.
 "George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEE!"
I didn't know that animals were so computer malleable until I watched an
Ape philosophize, an elephant imitate a dog, gorillas become Ninjas, and a
monkey imitate George. The story is very simple. George finds Ursula,
George likes Ursula, George mates with Ursula - I don't mean initially,
because we need to build up the sexual tension between Man and Woman,
Tarzan and Jane, George and Ursula; and I don't mean literally - shame
on you, put away those thoughts, this is a children's movie! Who's
Ursula? Oh, she's a wealthy blonde who is the most fortunate and
compatible of her sex to be chosen for George, with a matching I.Q. of
one.
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"
So Disney has created a fun spoof with more vacuum than grey matter; but
who cares, after a hard days work, it's pretty invigorating to end up
laughing like a one year old. This movie doesn't pretend to be a great
myth of Olympic proportions, like the meat loaf "Hercules"; and so ends
up to being more enjoyable and likeable, with little expectations to
live up to.
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"
"Goodbye England's rose .... Like a candle in the wind..."
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"
"Let's hear it for the Men in Black.....Men in Black."
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"
"Now how does that song from My Bestfriend's Wedding go again?"
"George, George, George of the Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"
"It's the Circle of life....."
Nope, I still like this tune the best: "George, George, George of the
Jungle WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREEEEEE!"

Title
Review for Spice World (1997)
Cast Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm, Geri Haliwell,
Victoria Addams, Richard E. Grant, Alan Cumming, Roger Moore. Written by
Jamie Curtis, Kim Fuller. Directed by Bob Spiers
Let's begin by saying that I am not a fan of the SPICE GIRLS. I don't
know their names, and after watching this movie I still don't know their
names. However, for the sake of posterity, there's the blonde one who
likes fluffy toys, the red haired one with big boobs, the dark skinned
one fixated with hair, the dark haired one fixated with clothes and the
other dark haired one who does somersaults ...... and they can all sing
even if they can't act. Strangely this tact works because the girls are
being themselves and they want us to laugh at them, if not with them.
So I laughed at them and for all the wrong reasons. This screwy, corn
ball, wacky, silly movie is very pretentious and very them. The most
annoying part of the SPICE experience was waiting in line with two
hundred screaming adolescents, shoving and pushing their way into the
cinema. Embarrassingly, I laughed at all the silly jokes and they
didn't, but surprisingly I actually enjoyed myself. Maybe I'm just a
sucker for tacky British humour, but if I could rename the movie it
would be CARRY ON SPICE.
So who are the SPICE GIRLS? If you've seen the series SEVEN UP, they are
reminiscent of the three working class girls who end up pregnant,
divorced and obese 21 years later. I'm not in any way implying that this
will befall SPICE, but my theory is - in their twenties they look like
Marilyn, when they're forty they'll look like Roseanne. Imagine a cow
trying to chew grass and recite lines at the same time, well that's how
SPICE GIRLS speak.
The cameo appearances made by who's who of British song and screen is
one of this movie's highlights. To think they showed support and rallied
to the aid of the girls continues to baffle me. But if money can buy
loyalty, then the girls have plenty of that. The other main roles worth
mentioning are Roger Moore who gets to play with animals, and a
hysterical Richard E. Grant who manages the girls. Add to this some
London sight seeing, a SPICE BUS, an evil media baron, scenes copied
from SPEED, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, GREASE, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS; throw in
themes about motherhood, pregnancy, friendship and loyalty and you have
the volatile cocktail that is SPICE WORLD  you'll either hate it or
love it.

Title
Review for Dark City (1998)
Cast: Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, Richard
O'Brien, Ian Richardson, William Hurt Director: Alex Proyas Producers:
Andrew Mason and Alex Proyas
Screenplay: Alex Proyas and Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer
Cinematography:  Dariusz Wolski
There's something surreal about the world of DARK CITY. It has a deja vu
feel of a distant memory or a vivid dream. It is always night and at the
stroke of twelve, everything stops. Lives are rearranged, memories
stolen, as if everything here runs under the influence of some alien
clockwork. The imagery is strangely beautiful, mysteriously haunting,
and intricately woven into the strangeness of the flow. You continually
ask yourself, where is this place? Who are these players? There is no
simple answer.
Made in Australia, this is a remarkable achievement in STYLE and should
be commended for this, if for anything. Alex Proyas - known for his
gothic imagery in THE CROW, has infused this movie with visual images
that speak louder than the script. Unfortunately, not many people may
take to this kind of story telling. Tastes vary, but this movie may be
too imaginative, creative, progressive for some, and unfortunately
labelled weird or alternative. This movie is undoubtedly one of the
better Australian-made movies this year, (compared to crap, like JOEY
and CRACKERS) and is a milestone in visual cinema in itself.
With a budget of only 27 million, the money is well spent and stretched
to the limit. Good value has been spent on employing a cast worth their
weight in fees. William Hurt gives the movie credibility, Kiefer
Sutherland is in one of his better roles, Jennifer Connely has put on
weight since THE ROCKETEER and Rufus Sewell has eyes as haunting as the
city itself. This movie looks like it had a budget of 50-70 million and
it shows that good movies can still be made with only a limited budget.

Title
Review for Wings of the Dove, The (1997)
Cast: Helena Bonham Carter, Linus Roache, Alison Elliott, Charlotte
Rampling, Elizabeth McGovern, Michael Gambon, Alex Jennings Director:
Iain Softley
Silently she walks across the train carriage, her delicate eyes at first
downcast, her porcelain complexion hiding the pounding excitement that
fills her veins. Timidly she looks up, to find a gentleman who stands,
allowing her to take his seat. She trembles as her hand brushes against
his coat; momentarily she closes her eyes to allow his presence to fill
her. Her fingers long to touch his, but precaution restrains temptation.
Wisely she waits for the train to stop. Departing the carriage like a
bird taking flight, he follows like a moth attracted to the flame.
Together they enter a lift, when alone at last restraint falls from the
hand like a misplaced glove. The first touch, the kiss and embrace is
passion defined. She is an heiress, awaiting her fortune, to be disowned
if found in his presence. He is a man of no consequence, with everything
to gain and nothing to lose. She is Kate and he is Merton and when their
lust is forbidden, a way is found to find a fortune to fulfil their
communion.
There is another, her eyes are sad. An orphan who has everything in life
except for one true love, and nothing in death, except a wealthy
inheritance to fall where true love lies. Life has cursed her with frail
health and death bids his time at her doorstep. Her gift to the world is
her choice to see the good in all, and generosity is her mantle piece.
So these sad eyes fall on a man of no consequence and to him she bestows
her parting gift, for she can only see the good in him. She is Millie
and he is Merton. When death comes on raven wings to this sweet child,
regret and sorrow fills the man who deceived innocent love. For nothing
can lift his heinous crime except for the wings of the dove.
Reflections on The Wings of the Dove' by TMT Voon.
This movie is beautifully crafted and almost flows like poetry. The
hauntingly sad tale carries with it complex issues about love and
betrayal. Helena Bonham Carter is exquisite as the passionate Kate, who
devises the plan to obtain Millie's fortune. Linus Roache plays Merton,
the man who agrees to win Millie's affections and thus her inheritance,
before being filled with despair for having partaken of the evil deed.
Lastly, Allison Elliot plays the role of Millie, the dying heiress whose
trusting belief in others is abused by the aforementioned. This is a
touching story, which may not be appreciated by all, but is a
wonderfully acted and performed piece of cinema. Well worth watching.

Title
Review for Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997)
Starring: Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow, Janeane Garofolo, Alan Cumming,
Julia Campbell. Screenplay: Robin Schiff. Director: David Mirkin.
Who hasn't dreamed of returning to their high school reunion to show
that they have made something of their lives. It is especially difficult
to face up to the past when you were the odd kid on the block and nobody
liked you; and it takes even more courage to go as you are.
Romy and Michelle (Sorvino and Kudrow), are invited to return to their
high school reunion, Class of 87, Sagebrush  High. They haven't made
much of their opportunities in the last ten years since high school (one
is unemployed and the other is a receptionist). They feel that they need
to upgrade their profile in order to be liked, so they pretend to be
successful business women who discovered 'post-its' and the self
adhesive glue that binds it. After much ridicule from the 'brat pack' at
the reunion, they finally realise that they need to be themselves.
Shedding their disguises they face the past, the pack, and their
problems on their own level and terms.
This pleasant, mindless excursion into comedy is both charming and
flawed. It skims over issues of coming to terms with one's past fears of
rejection and lost hopes, with enough light hearted ditziness to give a
cow vertigo. Not everyone will leave their high school reunion,
transformed from a duckling to a swan, in the arms of a millionaire in
his private helicopter. I can guarantee that most of us will not.
The final dance sequence was so embarrassing I wanted to hide.
Sorvino and Kudrow play 'blondes' to a tee, with enough 80's music to
wallow with nostalgia.
Comment: One big, overdrawn blonde joke.

Title
Review for Fifth Element, The (1997)
I truly enjoyed the visual beauty of Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' and
in certain respects, director Luc Besson has achieved with the 'Fifth
Element',  what can be described as a visually beautiful movie.
The concept of five elements coming together to protect earth is a good
base for any plot. Its opening scenes has a similar reminiscent feel to
'Star Gate'; the movie is fast moving and is never for a moment dull,
with snappy, alternative music to guide it along. The big disappointment
is it's ending which becomes cliched, when Korben has to profess his
love to the fifth element before she can perform her duty (not so
perfect after all).
Part of the promotion for this movie was 'The Fifth Element It Must Be
Found.' In all fairness they should have added 'Where Did They Stash The
Other Four?' as much of the movie madly revolves about finding them; and
the advertisements for MacDonalds is shameless but nevertheless
entertaining.
People have been talking about the intricacies of Blade Runner's plot
since it's release more than a decade ago. Who was the fifth escapee
replicant? Was it Deckard? Or was it Rachael? This makes an intriguing
after-dinner conversation (+/- argument), believe me.
Unfortunately, nobody will be having long discussions about why the
earth doesn't have more moons if 'Darkness' returned every five thousand
years, or why human space was so badly patrolled allowing the Mangalore
fighters to destroy the Mondoshawan craft, or why the Fifth Element goes
all soft and gooey when she reads about war and man's other destructive
qualities, then has second thoughts about saving mankind. Hmmmmm.
This movie will be remembered if not for it's plot, for its memorable
scenes like Lee Loo jumping of a sky scraper, the police car line up,
the Chinese sail boat take-away, and the enchanting blue Diva singing
operetta as Lee Loo fights, and will inevitably become what is
considered a cult classic.

Title
Review for Devil's Advocate, The (1997)
What started out as a standard court room drama, took a turn for the
worse when the subject material went from weird to out right bizarre. In
fact much of the material is quite sickening if one has time to
contemplate it. The Devil is not just an allegory for someone evil in
this movie, the evil is actually THE DEVIL himself in flesh and blood.
Let's talk about bizarre. Keanu Reeves, the advocate, lawyer character
in this movie, is trying to make a baby with his wife on the lounge room
floor. As this is occurring the image of his wife keeps flipping between
her and another mysterious woman. He's confused at first, there is
hesitancy in his eyes, but then he really starts coming and going. His
wife is receptive, the other woman aggressive, it begins to turn him on
as he loses himself in this three way fantastic orgy. The only thing of
note about this entirely depraved scene is that Keanu Reaves has a hairy
bum.
If you were brought up in the Catholic, Christian, Jewish or Muslim
faith, then you may find the end scenes difficult to handle. The Devil
(Al Pacino) has a field day mocking God and some of the words spoken are
nothing short of blasphemous. So be warned. Issues like spawning the
Anti-Christ through incestuous relations between the devil's seed are
prominent themes in the movie. Not to mention sex, mutilation, nudity,
lunacy, suicide and any evil thing you can think off. If you can excuse
all of this, or if you like this sought of thing, then you will probably
enjoy the movie. Personally it's not something I could stomach.
Al Pacino does an over the top performances as the Devil. I feel of late
that he has been overacting with most of his movie roles. As for Keanu
Reeves, his is actually quite good in this movie, and this is probably
his best performance since .well since .. BILL AND TED??? I
personally disliked the content of this movie, much more so than its
make. This is not a movie for those with strong religious convictions.

Review for Kiss the Girls (1997)
Cast: Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Cary Elwes, Tony Goldwyn, Jay O.
Sanders, Bill Nunn, Brian Cox, Alex McArthur, Richard T. Jones, Jeremy
Piven, William Converse-Roberts, Gina Ravera Director: Gary Fleder
Screenplay: David Klass, based on the novel by James Patterson
If a movie contains mostly kidnapped girls, dead corpses, cops and a
psychopathic rapist known as Casanova, who are the prime suspects? I'll
give you a clue. It's not the ones in the morgue, its not the ones in
chains, its not the ones who need to lower the toilet seats to pee, so I
guess that leaves the ones who have a "Johnny", and like donuts and
coffee.
Not only does our Casanova have time to imprison his kidnapped girls in
a prison cell Harem, he has time to feed them home made sandwiches with
lettuce, ham and tomato, nicely sliced down the centre gourmet style.
This rapist who likes lots of sex, also has time to hold down a full
time job, write beautiful cursive on bulletin boards, and communicate
with others of his type on the Internet.
So I'll give you a quick run down on how I would have captured this
rapist without much ado fuss. I would have surfed the Net, browsed News
Groups like alt.sex.bondage, matched those subscribing to the group to
the vicinity of the missing girls - and Wella a suspect! It sure beats
having to find some unheard of Benzodiazepine drug in the MIMS.
Other annoying factors. The only victim to escape from Casanova is a
female doctor (Ashley Judd) who nearly loses her life in the process. 24
hours after being certified fit to leave the hospital, she's up moseying
about the woods where she nearly died without any worries. Next she's
gallivanting around town looking for the killer, trying not to be
conspicuous, but wearing exactly the same hair style when first eyed by
her rapist.
Equally annoying is the violin player (Gina Ravera) victim who plays
Bach for her tormentor to hear. Not only does she play the music
beautifully her performance is almost flawless. After being repeatedly
raped one would imagine that it would have some dampening effect on her
musical ability, no matter how talented. When rescued, her Uncle (Morgan
Freeman) gives her back the same violin with new strings. She smiles at
takes the instrument happily. One would have thought that this
instrument is the last thing this girl would want to see, when it serves
as a constant reminder of her abuse.
Most annoying of all we have eight girls dressed in lovely black silk
dresses, sitting in a circle as Casanova walks around the room fondling
them. Considering they are unchained, eight females should have no
problems overcoming a single male. Sure they've been psychologically
beaten into submission, but sooner or later the "battered wife" syndrome
is bound to emerge, and believe me any one of them could have the
strength to kill the bastard.
As for Morgan Freeman, this is the stupidest role I have seen him in.
His character is non-objective, renegade and too maverick for a police
psychiatrist. It's surprising that his dumb actions didn't get him
killed in the movie. I mean what does a doctor know about shooting guns,
entering the enemy camp virtually alone, unassisted and without backup?
Then again all the doctors in this movie are presented as moronic
persons - they are either raped, bungling investigations, drugging
girls, or collecting their feet.
If you wanted to watch something of this genre worth while, see Silence
of the Lambs again. The only thing "Kiss the Girls" will leave you with
is a recurrent case of cold sores.

Review for Free Willy 3: The Rescue (1997)
Cast:  Jason James Richter, August Schellenberg, Annie Corley, Vincent
Berry, Patrick Kilpatrick. Screenplay:  John Mattson. Producer:  Jennie
Lew Turgend. Director:  Sam Pillsbury.
Surprise yourself with this whale of a movie, where the ruthless killer
is man and the Killer Whale is more humane than mankind. Willy is not
the name of a hot dog, or your dangly 'uhum', but the name of Poseidon's
stallion who roams freely within the stables of the sea. In the first
instalment of "Free Willy", this Orca once in captivity, scales a
towering wall of stone in the most memorable footage we have of flying
whales. Now back with human chum Jesse (Jason James Richter), they
battle against the likes of whalers eager for the tasty hump of Willy,
worth a hefty sum on the Sushi market.
This is not a simple tale of good and evil. The Whaler (Patrick
Kilpatrick) is a descendant of generations of his kind, hand taught the
foul trade of whaling by his father, and by his father before him. It is
now the time of initiation and the handing down of skill from father to
son, but nature has the last laugh when Ahab's child (Vincent Berry)
becomes mesmerised by the song of the giant beast. With torn loyalties
and courageous fervour the child stands between his father's harpoon and
the vengeance of the sea. He cannot reclaim his father's soul for him,
until the hunter faces the beast.
I was impressed by the sensitivity by which this movie addressed such
thematic issues as loyalty, father/son relationships and the complex
characterisations of the hunter and hunted. By far one of the better
children's movies of the year, when compared to the likes of "Simple
Wish" and "Buddy". It came as a pleasant surprise when I was presented
with sushi instead of a sardine sandwich. Now all I need is a karaoke
machine, and I'll sing ya my made-up "Free Willy" song.
FREE WILLY SONG by TMT Voon - Can be sung to any tune.
Free Willy, shake it all about, Free Willy da dum da dum,
Yeah gotta Free Willy, so swing it all around,
He's not a Humpback, he's not a Blue Whale or a Sperm Bank,
(Whispered) He's your average Killer, your friendly Killer,
Your killing me with ya Free Willy da dum da dum.

Review for Gingerbread Man, The (1998)
Cast: Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davidtz, Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah,
Robert Duvall, Tom Berenger, Famke Janssen, Jesse James, Mae Whitman
Director: Robert Altman
Producer: Jeremy Tannenbaum
Screenplay: "Al Hayes" (Robert Altman) based on an original story by
John Grisham
The first thing that struck me about this movie, was how amateurish it
felt. Maybe, this was the intent of the usually brilliant Robert Altman,
who I am surprised decided to cash in on this potentially commercial,
John Grisham product. Well, why not, if Ford Coppola saw fit to direct
THE RAINMAKER?
This isn't your standard Grisham courtroom drama. Gone are the usual
features of the incredibly corrupt industrial forces vs. the severely
disadvantaged individual, with a lawyer carrying a conscience thrown
somewhere in between. Also gone, are some strong Grisham's tendencies to
highlight moralistic issues.
Sadly so, because this movie has ended up becoming melodramatic trash,
more in consistency with Sidney Sheldon or Jackie Collins, but lacking
the bitchy edge. What we have is a sleazy lawyer (Kenneth Branagh), who
ends up in bed with a mysterious waitress (Embeth Davidzt), living in
fear of her lunatic father (Robert Duvall). The movie hits an all time
low, when a mostly grumpy, whiney Branagh loses all self control when
his kids get kidnap. I guess there is a moral here, somewhere, if you
sleep around expect to get more than just you're fair share of STD's.
As already mentioned, Branagh is painful to watch when not reciting
Shakespeare. Daryl Hannah acts as an assistant lawyer, but it takes more
than her pair of glasses to make her role intelligent. Robert Downey Jr,
is once again stoned, etc. Duvall is genuinely crazed, whilst Davidzt
mopes, and Tom Berenger has very little screen time.
A most disappointing tale, with little relevance to the children's story
on which it is based, except for the fact that Davidzt got nightmares
when Duval told her the story when she was a kid.

Title
Review for X Files, The (1998)
Cast: David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Martin Landau, Blythe Danner,
William B. Davis, Armin Mueller-Stahl, John Neville, Terry O'Quinn
Director: Rob Bowman
Producers: Chris Carter, Daniel Sackheim
Screenplay: Chris Carter
There is no corporate conspiracy between the Uranians and certain
government groups, to re-populate the planet Earth. Nor is there a
mutated alien virus hidden beneath the ice caps of Antartica, ready to
emerge to infect humanity and transform the host into gestation pods for
the creation of a new species. There isn't, nor will there ever be a FBI
agent as paranoid as Fox Mulder or as sexy as Dana Scully. It is also
unlikely that these two uncanny heroes will get close enough to kiss
again, until perhaps, their next feature movie.
After stating all the unlikely-hoods, the likely-hoods are that if you
are not an X-Files fan, which I am not, you may actually enjoy the
movie. So what has made the X-Files such a hugely popular syndicate
series. That is a difficult question and there is no answer, except for
some strange reason, the public enjoys watching aliens possess humans,
kidnap humans, mutilate humans, infect humans, digest humans  which
just about covers every episode of the X-Files. This is purely
observational, from someone who has never watched a full episode, but
the adverts say it all.
So what made me like a movie about subject material, I don't even like
watching on TV? Well I guess that eerie opening tune was catchy and sent
tingles down my spine, and the awkward chemistry between Mulder and
Scully was quite electrifying. Pity a stupid bee had to sting her as the
sexual tension mounted, leaving more than a love bite. The question now
is will I watch the series, because I liked the movie. Probably not, but
I will certainly look out for the next movie.

Review for White Squall (1996)
Cast: Jeff Bridges, Caroline Goodall, John Savage, Scott Wolf, Jeremy
Sisto, Balthazar Getty, Ryan Phillipe, Jason Marsden Director: Ridley
Scott Screenplay: Todd Robinson based on the memoirs of Chuck Gieg
It's about a big wave which capsizes a boat killing a wife and some
school boys, AND it's a real story.
The name of the ship is 'The Albatross', its a solid beautiful vessel,
but I kind of thought it looked old and probably would not have allowed
my child to go sailing half way around the world in it; but hey some
parents are real crazy right.
The idea of studying as you travel is any school boys dream of having a
great bludge, but these boys do actually learn some important lessons
about life, survival and working as a team.
So getting back to this big wave, a meteorological phenomenon known as
the 'White Squall' which has the propensity to capsize ships. It strikes
swiftly and unsuspectingly like the 'Hand of God', and it does so with
such awesome majesty that you almost forget about the people who are
drowning. The most touching and memorable scene involves the captain.
When unable to rescue his wife, he mouths the words 'I Love You' through
the sky light of their cabin as the ship sinks. She can only look up to
see her husband float away as she sinks to a watery grave.
I wander whether such educational cruises are still available for school
boys today? The responsibility to carry out such a venture must be
overwhelming, and I can only imagine the legal nightmares that would
eventuate if anybody drowns. After this unusual, tragic occurrence, I'm
sure the contracts signed by parents must include a clause which exempts
the crew responsibility for their child's life if struck by a "White
Squall".
However, this is not were the story ends. The captain never remarries
and becomes the leader of a peace movement in South America, whilst the
surviving boys are shipped of to Vietnam three years after this tragedy.
Amazingly they all return safely. One cannot help but wonder whether the
'Squall' which on one hand claimed the lives of their friends, in the
other instilled in them the courage and determination to survive no
matter what the circumstance.

Title
Review for City Hall (1996)
Cast: Al Pacino, John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, David
Paymer, Martin Landau, Tony Franciosa Director: Harold Becker
Screenplay: Ken Lipper, Nicholas Pileggi, Paul Schrader, and Bo
Goldman
Sitting in the confines of polished stone walls and marble floors, the
mayor of a town like NY makes his daily decisions amidst the whispers
of his trusted counsellors. Behind the white-washed smiles of these
white collared workers, everything seems perfect and in place. No one
is expecting the unspeakable to happen when a distinguished police
officer confronts a known drug dealer.
Gunfire between the dealer and the law. Both men drop dead amidst the
flurry of bullets, but not before a small boy falls victim to a stray
bullet of crossfire.  The city mourns. The questions asked only leads
to more questions unanswered. Why was this dangerous drug dealer given
only a probationary sentence, when in fact he deserved a ten to
twenty. So we travel the road of corruption, in this journey of
ascension. With each step travelled and each clue uncovered, we find
questions which can only be answered by the pinnacle of
hierarchy. Here it is revealed, the greyness of power and the greeness
of money. Where those with whom we place our trust, can only provide
reasons for further injustice and false hope.
This movie is a long sit, with more dialogue than action to slow it's
momentum.  But fine performances from a charismatic Al Pacino as the
city Mayor, John Cussack as his inquisitive deputy, and a small side
role for Bridget Fonda the attorney.

Title
Review for My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)
Cast: Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz, Rupert Everett,
Philip Bosco, M. Emmet Walsh, Carrie Preston, Rachel Griffiths Director:
P.J. Hogan Screenplay: Ronald Bass
If I'm not married by twenty-eight, I'm NOT going to marry my best
friend cause I don't think it's legal. If Julianne (Julia Roberts) isn't
married by twenty eight she IS going to marry her best friend Michael
(Dermot Mulroney). Legally possible, personality compatible, wonderful,
except .... he's met somebody else.
Julianne was the centre of Michael's life 9 years ago. After splitting
with him, they have remained friends with the vague memory of a promise
of marriage, if still single by 28. Jules doesn't realise that she is
still in love with Michael until 3 weeks before her 28th birthday; when
he calls to tell her that he's getting married, and asks if she would
come to give him emotional support before the big day. Suddenly,
feelings of jealousy are awoken in her, as she sets out to win Michael
back in every underhanded way possible.
Yes, Julia Roberts is the BAD GUY. The fly in the Chardonet, the rain on
a wedding day, the good advice that you shouldn't take - isn't it
ironic? If cupid had a quiver full of arrows, they would probably all be
sticking in his little butt right now if Julianne had anything to do
with it. Which is the reason why I like this movie. It's a great
learning experience for those wishing to sabotage weddings, and failed.
Away with the simple 'I object' and in with karaoke aptitude tests, gay
fiancees, falsified E-mail and wicked lies. I would also have
recommended laxatives, but that's too cruel even for me, not on a
wedding day.
So these are the tests that true love faces, when a very jealous best
friend does not get her way. In this subtle competition for the groom,
the bride Kimmy (Cameron Diaz) carries with her the girdle of bright
eyed sincere innocence, whilst her rival maid of honour wields the magic
of brains and beauty. So with whom shall I side? They both love him
soooo much. How can one win without the other getting hurt. If I had to
take sides, I can only let my conscience guide me. I have always
believed that the motive behind every action, is the most important
reason behind a  good relationship. Sorry Jules you lose. But if I had
my way with the plot - Kimmy gets Michael, and Jules ends up with Rupert
- who makes an exception to his rule, and changes his sexual orientation
the last minute. Not likely, but an interesting idea - cause we'd have
something of a 'Chasing Amy' - Oh dear! Now if Shakespeare had his way
with this tale of jealousy, it would probably have ended up with four
dead bodies - now that would have been funny.
Director Hogan has once again decided to fill his 'wedding' movies with
catchy tunes, making the marital experience a joyful ride. Julia is back
in sparkling form, with an effervescent smile and long curly red hair.
She has once again left mankind panting for more. Her every look carries
with it an easy charm reminiscent of Rita Hayworth in her hey day. Yes,
beauty and humour makes this particular lady prettier still. Cameron
Diaz carries herself well against the stiff competition, whose
performance at a karaoke bar will be painfully remembered. Dermot
Mulroney is the ever likeable object of desire for both women, whose
bland personality makes him the ideal reliable husband that every woman
looks for; but it is Rupert Everett who steals the movie's funniest
moments with his wry wit, humorous tale telling and spontaneous singing
- making this wedding party a curious gem of rare sorts.

Title
Review for Madness of King George, The (1994)
Cast: Nigel Hawthorne, Helen Mirren, Ian Holm, Amanda Donohoe, Rupert
Graves, Rupert Everett Director: Nicholas Hytner Screenplay: Alan
Bennett based on his stage play THE MADNESS OF GEORGE III
They say 'Royal blood is blue', but how does one react to a mad king who
is pissing blue urine with as much self control as running about the
English countryside in his 'Jammys'. First, a quiet snigger is in order.
After all, one does not laugh aloud at the King of England. We are
referring to the 'infallible' British Monarchy, the oldest of the royal
families, where everything is spoken in hushed whispers and behind
closed doors. Here daily life is governed by minuscule laws and court
etiquette, bound by centuries of tiresome tradition and refined customs.
Just when the stuffiness of Royalty becomes unbearable, it's refreshing
to see a king of the longest lineage go temporarily mad. Not that it's
all that spectacular by today's standards. I mean with Charles and
Camilla, the tampons; Diana, Captain Hewitt, the rugby player and now
the ex-play boy billionaire - it all but makes 'The Madness of King
George' seem mild and inconsequential. God, I hope Di is OK - she was
when I wrote this review pre paparazzi car chase.
Nevertheless, this tale of unfortunate genetics - 'Porphyria' a
hereditary disease which makes the urine go blue and the brain batty
(temporarily), must be told. Fascinating performances by Nigel Hawthorne
as the mad king who is forced to behave himself by the 'body
restraining-mouth gagging' techniques of Dr Willis (Ian Holm). The rest
of the cast give noteworthy performances, but it's this mad, foul mouth,
flatulent king and his bulky, firm stools which gets the most attention.

Title
Review for Strange Days (1995)
Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore,
Director: Kathryn Bigelow Screenplay: James Cameron and Jay Cocks based
on a story by James Cameron
It is the eve of the coming century, the 31st December 1999. Humans have
developed the technology to record memories (I know, take it with a
grain of salt). Lenny (Fiennes) an ex-cop, now street hustler, supplies
these 'stolen dreams' in the black market. He becomes involved in the
schemes of a psychopathic rapist who is recording 'black jacks' (death
experiences) of his victim, and needs to stay alive to see the New Year.
This movie only gets from weird to worse, with nothing to slow it's
descent into utter ridiculousness. The plot promises unexpected twists
and turns, but produces only a convoluted mess.
Whenever Lenny is in a jam he tries to trade his rouleaux watch to the
villains to save himself a beating. What a wimpy ex-cop? He constantly
relies on his best friend (Basset), ex-housewife turned body guard, to
come and save his arse. I was so annoyed at Fienne's anti-hero,
wimpiness, that I thought that perhaps he should have played the
housewife, and let Basset play the lead.
This is an uneven offering from Cameron, who is normally very precise
with his characters and plot. Perhaps he should have directed the movie
himself, after all it was his idea to begin with.

Title
Review for Breakdown (1997)
Cast: Kurt Russell, J.T. Walsh, Kathleen Quinlan, M.C. Gainey, Jack
Noseworthy, Rex Linn, Ritch Brinkley Director: Jonathan Mostow
Screenplay: Jonathan Mostow and Sam Montgomery based on the story by
Jonathan Mostow
There are important lessons to be learnt from this movie. In the event
of a motor vehicle breakdown in the dust filled, lonely roads of
countryside, ALWAYS carry a mobile phone which covers more distance than
metropolitan, and NEVER allow your wife to hitch a ride with a stranger.
Enough said about common sense, or the tale of your BREAKDOWN may not
have a happy end.
A holiday in the country is reminiscent of lettuce and tomato sandwiches,
dreamy picnics, catching butterflies, gone fishing and endless sunny
days. On the same note, it can also be ruined by the smell of a burning
engine, the explosion of a flat tire, or harassment from several male,
lunatic country bumpkins, who kidnap your wife before giving you a hell
of a beating. Stranded and without mechanical assistance, you become
lost in a world where the sky is actually as blue as the textbooks
describe; man made buildings are replaced by God given trees, and the
concrete floors of suburbia play second fiddle to the green grass of
Wyoming. Take a man out of a city, remove his mobile phone and he'll end
up a nervous wreck in the country.
Kurt Russell is the object of our jibes. He plays a non-to wise,
ordinary city boy Jeff Tyler, who does the unthinkable by allowing his
wife to get help when their 4-Wheel drive stops running. His excuse,
`I'll stay with the car in case anything happens' Which becomes the
understatement of the entire movie. His wife is kidnapped, and what
follows is this film's most harrowing scene. A frightened man, with a
missing wife gazes up at a bulletin board filled with the impersonal
faces of missing persons. His most cherished lover, has just become a
meaningless number on the growing list of lost and not found. Their
legacy is an understated, glossy photo on the wall of a police outhouse.
His torment is heartbreaking as he begins to realise the futility of his
situation.
Kurt Russell is often a B actor in an A role, or an A actor in a B role;
but on occasion he will surprise us all and turn up a solid performance
as an A actor in an A role. He is quite convincing as the naive,
peaceful city dweller, who is transformed into a resourceful, angry
country visitor by the intensity of his circumstance. Kathleen Quinlan,
also known for her role as one of the mutilated bodies in "Event
Horizon", makes a likeable appearance as the kidnapped housewife. J.T.
Walsh, carries the misleading deception of an honest face, his role as
the kidnapper will forever mar one's trust in the friendly looking
trucker.
So I did enjoy this tense tale of driven fears. Where the once innocent
passive driver, becomes the now aggressive front seat passenger. The
final scene is something reminiscent of road wars, and gives monster
truck madness a run for its wheels.

Title
Review for Buddy (1997)
Cast: Rene Russo, Robbie Coltrane , Alan Cumming, Irma P. Hall Director:
Caroline Thompson Screenplay: Caroline Thompson, based on the book
ANIMALS ARE MY HOBBY by Gertrude Davies Lintz
I'll begin by telling you why I don't think 'Buddy' works well as a
family film. Remember Bambi, and how Bambi's mother gets shot towards
the end of the movie. Sad as this may be, the audience is fortunately
spared the gruesome details of what actually follows a kill - the
division of the spoils into venison, and a wall mount for her head.
Similarly, remember that kind spider in 'Charlotte's Web', who spun her
web in order to save Wilbur the pig's life. Fortunately, children are
spared the unpleasant details of how she will likely be her off-springs
first meal after they hatch.
So how does the above relate to 'Buddy'? A baby gorilla raised in the
wealthy, eccentric home of Gertrude Lintz (Renee Russo). Firstly, I
don't think the audience were expecting to see this once charming, sweet
innocent gorilla grow into a moody, violent animal who frightens
everyone at a fair, knocks his human mother about, rips his cage doors
open, and after a thunderstorm destroys several rooms of the mansion in
a confused, frightened rage. We all know he's out of his habitat, so
return him to the jungle, and save us from this 'ape-to-adolescent'
theatrical.
Some other comments. Children will be very frightened of gorillas by the
end of this movie. By Jo I was PETRIFIED, even after watching 'George of
the Jungle', which actually endeared me to the great Apes. This being a
true story makes it all the more heart breaking. Dressing animals in
clothes and pretending that they are your children, is very unnatural.
My advice to Gertrude Lintz is to buy a Ken and Barbie Doll if she wants
to play dress up, and to invest her time and fortune on homeless
children instead. Sure they may grow up to be anorexic or psychopathic,
but at least they won't grow up to be like this baby gorilla.

Title
Review for Looking for Richard (1996)
Cast: Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin, Winona Ryder, Aidan Quinn,
Penelope Allen, Harris Yulin
Director: Al Pacino
Screenplay: Al Pacino and Frederick Kimball based on the play by William
Shakespeare
Ever wanted to make a movie without any definite idea of how you want to
make it? So when the crunch comes, the simplest solution is to grab the
best footage and throw it together into a coherent mess. This is my
impression of Al Pacino's LOOKING FOR RICHARD' based on William
Shakespeare's Richard III'. A difficult Shakespearean play to
understand, even at the best of times. Despite being mostly documentary
and partly stagey, this film does work. One gets the general feel of
Pacino et al, urgently trying to understand Richard III. Their
earnestness rubs off on the audience, even if their acting doesn't.
Annoying factors include constant close ups of a deranged looking
Richard III/Al Pacino, staring into the camera with bewildered looking
eyes. Kevin Spacey, who just gets to smile on film, but without any
footage of his having recited any Shakespeare at all. Alec Baldwin, who
gets to say a few more lines than Spacey, before being murdered in a
bell tower. Winona Ryder looking pretty, but Shakespeare she ain't. The
lesser well-known actors have a better flare for Shakespeare, but you'll
end up asking yourself who are they? Also included, is informative
footage of interviews with Sir John Gielguld, Vanessa Redgrave and
Kenneth Branagh on Shakespeare.
Despite the patchwork style of this movie, one does conclude with a
better understanding of Richard III. However, we do not actually see the
play performed in its full glory, but presentation is the sacrifice that
Pacino has to pay, in order to get a fuller understanding of lines like
This is the winter of our discontent' or A kingdom for a horse.' By
far the most unusual and modern approach to Shakespeare, and also by far
the best high school resource for kids studying Richard III.

Review for Indian in the Cupboard, The (1995)
Cast: Hal Scardino, Litefoot, Lindsay Crouse, Richard Jenkins, Rishi
Bhat, David Keith Director: Frank Oz Screenplay: Melissa Mathison based
on the book by Lynne Reid Banks
When a kid with not so perfect teeth locks a toy Indian in his magical
cupboard, WELLA we have a walking, talking, child bearing, lactating
Indian Squaw. No that's not right. How about a turban wearing, pipe
smoking, Indian snake charmer? Nope. What we have is a genuine
hunter-gathering, soul searching Iroquois Indian, who is a widower.
On his birthday, a nine year old boy (Scardino) receives two presents of
note. A toy cupboard (ten by five inches), and a plastic Iroquois Indian
(two by three centimetres). Any one who can't add, like myself, will
know that the Indian if divided by three, to the square root of two,
will fit nicely into the toy cupboard; and too my surprise, and
everybody elses, like a chemistry experiment where lead becomes gold,
the toy Indian when placed in the cupboard comes alive (flesh and blood,
but real small).
Wow, Ooooh, it's magical. For anybody who is wandering whether this also
works on toy T-Rexes, Darth Vader dolls, monopoly money etc. Yep, it
sure does, as long as it can fit inside that magical cupboard. We have
all played with toy soldiers, cars, and planes as children. Remember Ken
and Barbie, well I liked ripping Barbie's head off. So let's stick her
in the cupboard and we have for ourselves a walking headless
Barbie... now that's food for thought!
Besides being a relatively entertaining children's movie, where the
imagination gets a little carried away (I mean really where did the
cupboard come from, the 'Twilight Zone'?). This movie does deal with
important issues where the child grasps the concept of the
responsibility for human life. The child becomes the parent, for his
living, talking little Indian, and by the end of the movie realises that
he cannot toy with the life of another for his own selfish pleasure. So
if you want a pet, get a puppy, they don't talk back, and they sure
don't shoot arrows at you when unhappy.
So kids, jump into bed with mom and dad, and watch the 'Cowboys and
Indians' at play. Don't click your heels three times and wish you were
in Kansas, and don't say 'Open Sesame' or 'Abracadabra', or you may end
up with 'Dorothy and the Forty Thieves'. If it's Indians you want,
remember to turn the key to the cupboard clockwise, then anticlockwise;
but don't do it too often or you'll scare your little Iroquois Indian to
death.

Review for Romeo + Juliet (1996)
Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo,
Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, Miriam Margolyes, Diane Venora, Harold
Perrineau Director: Baz Luhrmann. Screenplay: Craig Pearce and Baz
Luhrmann based on the play by William Shakespeare
I have read reports that claim this movie glamorised teen-age suicide. I
cannot agree. If someone wants to kill themselves, they're going to kill
themselves. Although there is a small possibility, that some movies, may
just tip an emotionally unstable person over the edge; it doesn't have
to be Shakespeare.
Well, whatever. I'm sure Shakespeare didn't have these tedious, social
issues to worry about, when writing 'Romeo and Juliet.' Some people have
found this movie to be too loud, noisy, splashy and colourful for their
liking. I can understand what they mean, but I personally didn't mind.
What I was more fascinated with was the lyrical beauty of the language
that was spoken:
'Two households both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona where we lay our scene.
>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes,
A pair of star crossed lovers take their life.' .
Comment: Close your eyes and hear the TALENT that is SHAKESPEARE.

Review for Small Soldiers (1998)
Cast: Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst, Jay Mohr, Kevin Dunn, Phil Hartman,
voices of Tommy Lee Jones, Frank Langella.
Screenplay: Gavin Scott, Adam Rifkin and Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio.
Producers: Michael Finnell and Colin Wilson.
Director: Joe Dante
What promised to be entertaining kids fun, in the name of TOY STORY,
turned out to be a disappointment, with a scary twist. What if your
favourite toys - Care Bears, Barbie dolls, G.I. Joes, Power Rangers or
Transformers were to come to life and start attacking you?
The story begins with a group of toy soldiers who have been
electronically designed to interact with children and each other.
Unfortunately, state-of-the-art military-defence CPUs, are mistakenly
introduced into the toys. So it is not surprising that they take a life
of their own, and begin World War III in your backyard. This is where
safety ends and mayhem begins, as small soldiers make weapons of
destruction that can kill a human being  nail guns, bombs and vehicles
wielding sharp utensils. It's surprising that no one actually gets
killed in this movie. It's no longer as simple as a kid choking on a
lego block - these toys fight back. It is sad that SKG has to resort to
guerrilla tactics and the abuse of toys, in order to gain an audience.
Changing a toy into a weapon and representing it to a child is highly
irresponsible. It is one thing to make toys in the image of warfare and
quite another, to make it workable.
If I were a child, I would have nightmares about my toys coming to life
and hurting me. The prime example, is when a girl's collection of
Barbie' dolls, come to life and attack her. If you ever had an
inclination to pull a doll's head off, think again, these miniature
demons can do the same to you! There isn't a strong moral lesson at the
end of the movie - the bad toys are destroyed and the good toys sail
away into the horizon. Unfortunately, because this movie needed a good
explanation in order to give some meaning to the mayhem it causes. Not
recommended for young, sensitive mind's who want to keep their sanity
about user friendly toys.

Review for Matilda (1996)
Cast: Mara Wilson, Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman, Embeth Davidtz, Pam
Ferris, Paul Reubens, Tracey Walter Director: Danny DeVito Screenplay:
Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord based on the book by Roald Dahl
Cinematography: Stefan Czapsky Music: David Newman
'I'm smart and you're dumb. I'm big and you're small. I'm right and
you're wrong.'
I certainly hope that you don't speak to your children in such a
condescending manner.
Matilda has parents from hell. This bright, intelligent little girl
prefers to read than to watch T.V., has a passionate desire to learn,
and attend school. All of which is strongly discouraged by her parents
who believe a quick buck is better than an education. Her schooling is
also a place of nightmares where Miss Trunchbull, the head mistress,
tosses children around by their hair, locks them away in an iron
maiden, and believes 'a perfect school is where there are no children
at all'.
Sure this maybe an exaggeration of the 'evil adults' theme, but
children do not have a voice when they are mistreated and abused. In
this remarkable story, Roald Dahl gives the child the power and
ability to fight back, and Matilda does so with a vengeance that is
worth watching.
This is a movie for both young and old, where the magic of imagination
is the central theme. Sit back and enjoy, and for a moment you may
remember what it was like to be a child.
Great direction and acting from DeVito, with a strong supporting cast.
Roald Dahl at his imaginative best.

Title
Review for Last Supper, The (1995)
Cast: Cameron Diaz, Courtney B. Vance, Annabeth Gish, Jonathan Penner,
Ron Eldard, Nora Dunn, Ron Perlman Director: Stacy Title Screenplay: Dan
Rosen
The question posed to the viewer. If able to journey into the past to
kill Adolf Hitler, would you do it?
This group of supposedly intelligent college graduates (see above cast),
with very liberal views would. As a result they have decided to rid the
world of all the would be Adolf Hitlers. Namely people who are harmless,
but politically incorrect in their eyes. Reverends not sympathetic to
the HIV cause; war veteran racists; male chauvinistic pigs; the
illiterate who have no appreciation for "Catcher in the Rye";
anti-abortionists; and a school girl with qualms about sexual education.
This meal is particularly distasteful, as we watch these college
graduates become the person who they hate most - Hitler himself. What
gives them the right to decide who lives and who dies. There is no
victory or satisfaction in watching people murdered at the dining table,
just because they have a different perception to life than what is
considered the norm. Although the grads realise their mistake in the
end, it doesn't make the viewer any happier that they had to kill eleven
people to find this out. Now if they had truly understood the full
meaning of "The Lord's Supper", words like forgiveness, tolerance and
compassion would have been extended to their guests instead of a bottle
of wine laced with arsenic.

Title
Review for One True Thing (1998)
Cast:  Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger, William Hurt.
Screenplay:  Karen Croner, based on the novel by Anna Quindlen.
Producers:  Harry Ufland and Jesse Burton.
Director:  Carl Franklin.
This movie should have a profound effect on people's understanding of
life and death, but somehow ends up being less effective than it could
have been, because it diverts its attention away from a mother's need
and focuses instead on a daughter's plight.
In this pandemonium of personal and family problems, we learn more than
we need to know about poor family dynamics. We have a mother (Meryl
Streep) who has given her life over to serving her family and helping
her husband achieve his dreams. A father (William Hurt) who is on the
surface an accomplished professor, but beneath the smooth exterior lacks
any character strength. A daughter (Renee Zellweger) and a son who are
constantly living in the shadow of their 組reat' father, and who are
unable live up to his high expectations for them.
It becomes apparent how important the role of the mother is to this
family, when she starts dying. The fabric that holds them all together
slowly begins to tear. Her husband is unable to cope with the situation
and unfairly unloads his responsibilities on a daughter, who is only
beginning to realise how great her mother is. Unfortunately, too much
time is spent exploring the daughter's dilemma of caring for her sick
mother, and not enough time is spent exploring the fears of the one who
is dying of cancer.
The other issue that is brought out in this movie is the need for cancer
sufferers to die with dignity. It is rather unfortunate that this movie
paints the picture of someone asking for euthanasia because of
inadequate pain control. I believe this is a biased, incorrect view of
cancer sufferers. With current medical treatments, suicide because of
inadequate pain control is not a valid option. However, the
deterioration of quality of life is a more difficult issue to address
and in this case, may have tipped the scales of life and death.

Title
Review for Hamlet (1996)
Cast: Kenneth Branagh, Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Richard Briers,
Nicholas Farrell, Kate Winslet, Michael Maloney, Brian Blessed, Rufus
Sewell, Billy Crystal, Jack Lemmon, Charlton Heston, Gerard Depardieu,
Rosemary Harris, Timothy Spall,  Reece Dinsdale, Robin Williams
Director: Kenneth Branagh
This version of HAMLET, will undoubtedly be remembered as the prettiest
version of the Shakespearean classic. Kenneth Branagh has filled this
production with more mirrors than at Tiffany's, and more rose petals
than at a garden show. If you can't change the words, at least you can
change the look. Not that this is bad, because décor is important in a
Shakespearean play. After all, the poetry of timeless verse, needs a
garden in which to sow it's timeless seed. It would take an absolute
moron who can't recite lines, to destroy the language of Shakespeare,
but one has to compliment Branagh and Hollywood ensemble, for delivering
HAMLET with great flourish and relish.
I stood in front of the video shelf, undecided as to whether to borrow
the 2 hour or 4 hour version of the feature film. Time set it's limits
on my agenda and 2 got the better of 4. As I sat down, half-heartedly to
watch the great play, not in the mood for Shakespeare after a weary day.
Slowly, I was entranced by the lyrical spell of the dead poet. His words
seemed vibrant and alive, as if calling from the grave. Hours seemed
like minutes, and I began to wish I had borrowed the
four-hour-for-two-days version of the play. My heart longed to hear more
musings from the great courts of the Danes, where disloyal brothers
murder kinsmen, to claim a crown and bed a wife, only to drive the young
prince Hamlet into royal rage. For no matter how often this story is
told, the cat's will mew and the dog's will have their day.'
The cast includes Kenneth Branagh as an intense Hamlet, Kate Winslet as
the forlorn Ophelia, Julie Christie as the unfaithful Queen Mother,
Gertrude and Derek Jacobi as the murderous uncle, Claudius. With notable
performances from Billy Crystal as The Gravedigger, Jack Lemmon as
Marcellus, Robin Williams as Osric and many others. This is probably the
most faithful version of the classic tale, and should be appreciated by
all followers of the master writer.

Review for Antz (1998)
ANTZ (DreamWorks) Voices: Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman,
Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft.
Screenplay: Todd Alcott and Chris Weitz & Paul Weitz.
Producers: Brad Lewis, Aron Warner and Patty Wooton.
Directors: Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson
In what is undoubtedly one of the funniest insect movies to date (there
haven't been that many, one other comes to mind - MICROCOSMOS, was
unintentionally funny) we are presented with a rare product of clever
devices. DreamWorks has used the miracle of computer generated graphics
to bring across a heart warming story of how being an individual is
integral to being a part of society. Using the neurosis of a very Woody
Allen character, we are charmed with something that Disney would have
been proud to present to the public.
This movie is littered with an impressive profile of Hollywood actors.
You will know who they are, even if you don't recognise their voice.
Stallone plays another caring, sensitive big guy role that brought him
critical acclaim in COPLAND - pulls out his droll voice for Weaver' the
ant who gets hurt for a friend. I'm not sure whether Sharon Stone will
ever come close to royalty, but she gets her chance as Bala', the ant
princess with an attitude. Gene Hackman thrives when it comes to guys
you love to hate and General Mandible' is no exception. Whilst
Chritopher Walken does something less typical and allows his conscience
to take a turn for the better in the end. There are many more fame
names, but the movie really belongs to Z-4195 (Woody Allen). His
character comes across like something the comedian would have written
about himself, and was undoubtedly written with him in mind.
This is a commendable effort containing computer generated graphics,
adult and kiddy humour, mixed in with relevant social issues. A very
entertaining, innovative enterprise from the DreamWorks team.

Title
Review for Head On (1998)
Directed by Ana Kokkinos, Cast :Alex Dimitriades, Paul Capsis, Julian
Garner, Tony Nikolakopoulos, Elena Mandalis, María Mercedes, Alex Papps,
Vassili Zappa, Damien Fotiou, Eugenia Fragos. Written by Andrew Bovell,
Ana Kokkinos, Mira Robertson, Christos Tsiolkas (novel).
HEAD ON is angry, noisy and confused like the highs and lows of a heroin
addict. This certainly isn't a heart warming, thoughtful movie and the R
in restricted, could easily be re-labelled Risqué. If anyone is
expecting this to be another episode of HEARTBREAK HIGH, think again,
don't be fooled by the ads  this is a kid on the fast lane to
self-destruction. Most people are probably not prepared for the shock
that comes with Alex Dimitriades' overnight change from straight, high
school heart throb, to blatant, sex obsessed homosexual.
There is a recurrent theme throughout this movie. The title of the movie
is aptly named HEAD ON. If you're wondering what it means, it isn't
about a simple head on concussion post fall, but full on oral sex. Oral
sex with an obese, Chinese grocery store man, oral sex with a dirty old,
Greek man, oral sex with a lesbian, and oral sex with a Caucasian hunk.
In fact there was so much oral sex one wonders whether this is something
more to sex, than just being oral?
The acting is mostly angry, and some of the sex scenes looked contrived.
I don't speak from first hand experience on either subject, but there
must be more to this movie than moans, groans and jerky movements,
identity crises, Greek self hatred, racism and addiction. Unfortunately,
this movie filled with St Kildaderish nightlife, may have too much to
say (or should I say show), for the sleepy residents of unglamorous
Melbourne. Perhaps a better choice of movies next time Alex Dimitriades
- the profile of angry, rebel, homosexual, drug addict will not
necessary boost your career, even if you did show your dick for the
world to see (a trick used too often nowadays by wannabe movie stars).

Title
Review for Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)
Cast: John Cusack, Minnie Driver, Dan Aykroyd, Joan Cusack, Alan Arkin,
Jeremy Piven, Hank Azaria, Mitchell Ryan Director: George Armitage
Screenplay: Tom Jankewicz, D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, and John Cusack
based on a story by Tom Jankewicz
Ever wanted to know what happened to Martin Blank (John Cusack), that
otherwise pleasant young man who disappeared ten years ago leaving his
girlfriend (Minnie Driver) in a $ 700 prom dress. From the class of 86
Grosse Pointe High some will become wealthy real estate agents, others
lowly security guards. There will be a lonely radio talk show host, and
most, if lucky, will get married once or twice; but sometimes, on that
rare occasion of inspirational spontaneity, somebody will decide that
they have the psychological profile of a killer and become a
professional hitman. Three cheers for Martin Blank.
This movie made me laugh and laugh I did. It carries a free flowing
audacity and lack of respect for everything and anything considered
usual. Like when lovers meet again, under the tense circumstance of
separation ten years earlier  first a thick big fat kiss (instead of a
slap) before discussing the issues of hurt and betrayal over the local
airways. This is followed by a heart warming scene of lovers reminiscing
over old times by playing aeroplane' on the bed  you know when
somebody lifts your whole body up with their legs, and you pretend you
can fly. God I love doing that, just don't do it on a full stomach.
So Martin has come back to Grosse Pointe to resolve the past, and also
to find his future. When he holds a baby in his arms we get the feeling
that it's time for him to put the gun down and start picking up the
nappies. After years of assassinating presidents, officials, dogs and
the odd other, there comes a time to settle and lead a more ordinary
life. So in order to be forgiven his past, Martin needs to save the girl
of his dreams and also her father. Only then can he properly proclaim
his love for the darling one he should have married a very long time
ago.
This is by far one of the most original, hilarious, quirky, well written
comedies I've seen this year. It by far outshines that other high school
reunion known simply as Romy and Michelle', and is well worth watching
again.

Title
Review for Ethan Frome (1993)
Starring: Liam Neeson, Patricia Arquette, Joan Allen
Director: John Madden
Producer: Stan Wlodkowski
Screenplay: Richard Nelson (based on the novel by Edith Wharton)
Edith Wharton must be the mistress of sexual angst. THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
carried such enormous, buried sexual tension, intricately suffocated
beneath layers of silk and corsets, that one can not get an erection
without hurting themselves. With ETHAN FROME, the issue of forbidden
love once again pops its curious head.
Times are harsh and the winter is bitterly unforgiving, like most of the
townsfolk when it comes to ETHAN FROME (Liam Neeson). A young pastor
arrives in town and with genuine Christian charity, extends his hand in
friendship to the crippled, outcast Frome. The movie opens like Emily
Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Frome like Heathcliff has a tragic story to
both hide and to tell. The viewer is then taken on a fascinating journey
leading to this man's demise. Ethan Frome was once married to a sickly
woman called Zeena (Joan Allen), whom he did not love. In the background
of this loveless marriage, is the presence of a young, beautiful girl
called Mattie (Patricia Arquette), and this is their story.
I can not say I enjoyed the ending, which came as a shock more so than a
surprise. Wharton is renown for her depressing tone and style of
writing, so the morbid finale is at least in keeping with her character.
Once again, a large amount of unreleased sexual tension is generated
between Mattie and Ethan. The feeling is wonderfully heightened by the
presence of a frigid wife and winter; the bleakness of life and love,
forcing these two characters into each other's arms. Even when the
tension is finally released, the lovemaking is silenced to the hush of a
flame flickering nervously on a shallow wick.

Title
Review for In Love and War (1997)
Cast: Sandra Bullock, Chris O'Donnell, MacKenzie Astin, Emilio Bonucci,
Ingrid Lacey, Ian Kelly, Margot Steinberg, Tara Hugo Director: Richard
Attenborough Screenplay: Allan Scott, Clancy Sigal, and Anna Hamilton Phelan
based on the book HEMINGWAY IN LOVE AND WAR: THE LOST DIARY OF AGNES VON
KUROWSKY by Henry S. Villard and James Nagel Cinematography: Roger Pratt
Well she sure ain't no 'Florence Nightingale', but does carry with her a
pretty smile and a good sense of humour; and he sure ain't no 'Ernest
Hemingway', but he does carry with him a certain amiable, boyish charm
highlighted by his kiddy manner; and this definitely ain't no Leo Tolstoy's
'War and Peace', which is why this movie is called 'In Love and War'.
If Attenbourough was hoping to make a film with classy actors, he sure did
miss the boat and landed in a muddy puddle. Hey, isn't this the same bus
driving, boat saving, while you were sleeping down town lass (Bulllock)? And
isn't that the green tomato eating, friend circling, bat loving, boy wonder
fomp, of an up town lad (O'Donnell)?
Are we meant to stretch our imaginations to believe that they are meant to
be Ernest Hemingway and his war time love interest, nurse Agnes Von
Kurowsky? Really Mr Attenborough, it is very unfair of you to ask this lad
and lass to stretch their acting skills beyond limits which are considered
humanely safe.
Nevertheless, what we do have is a concoction of melodramatic, heart rending
mush which goes nicely with lemonade. 'In Love and War' we can draw
conclusions that the reason why Hemingway was so brilliant and yet so
miserable, was probably because he was dumped by a pretty nurse post-1st
World War; and he never had the heart to forgive her. Please spare us the
violins.
I'm trying not to be overly nasty with my comments. I enjoyed 'Shadowlands'
and I even liked 'Chaplin'; but this movie is just screaming out to be
teased. On a positive note, I can freely say that Attenborough's movies are
always easy on the eye, and one can sit through them with the same relaxed
feel of a Sunday picnic.
Comment: 'In Love and War' we don't find 'An American in Paris', but we
do find two juvenile Yankees making hay in Italy.

Title
Review for Sphere (1998)
Cast: Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson, Liev Schreiber,
Peter Coyote
Director: Barry Levinson
Screenplay: Stephen Hauser and Paul Attanasio based on the novel by
Michael Crichton
Don't you just hate the element of fake surprise, when actors get
together to make a movie about UFOs. This is how much of the movie goes:
"Oh My God, a UFO! (Not another one!) ... It's so big! (It's also very
phallic)... It's been here 300 years? (Only?)... I thought you said this
thing was made of titanium, well look I've just scratched it! (Watch
that nail strengthener!) ... I can't see my reflection in the SPHERE!
(Get a mirror!) ... I have to get inside it! (Why? It's a big, golden
ball!).... Look at these pretty Jelly fish (They sting!) ... I see
footprints and a bin labelled 'Trash'! (Environmentally correct) ... And
now a flight log... Written in English! WOW! I bet it was made in America
(Ya don't say!)... I like to read TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA
Why am I getting these nightmares? (You read too much.) Where did the
giant squids come from? (Go figure?_ What is the problem here? (I think
you are.)
This movie begins with a group of scientists investigating a UFO buried
on the ocean floor. Like the awful EVENT HORIZON, weird and mysterious
phenomena occur on the science base resulting in the deaths of team
members trapped there by violent storms raging above them. This in ways
is reminiscent of THE ABYSS, a movie far superior in quality and make.
SPHERE unfortunately lacks the same intensity of suspense or tension
generated by the aforementioned. However, it does come perilously close
to being as ridiculous as EVENT HORIZON. Fortunately, it isn't as
distasteful or make claims to having gone to hell and back, although the
usual mumbo jumbo about Black Holes is used to give the viewer some lame
excuse for the ship's presence.
There is nothing worse than a poor ending to a movie and this movie does
not have a satisfactory conclusion. It leaves the audience annoyed at
the need to suspense disbelief, in order to accept what this movie wants
them to swallow. I almost choked when it was suggested that the solution
to the nightmare was holding hands, counting to three and forgetting
anything bad ever happened. God, if only it was so easy to forget, the
world would be a better place! There is a place for reality and a place
for fantasy, and only so much a person will believe just because you
said so. Sorry Michael, but even the dinosaurs are easier to swallow
than this big golden ball. Like the awful EVENT HORIZON this movie is
best viewed in the vacuum of a black hole. As for the cast, Dustin
Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson - all very unexciting.

Review for Microcosmos: Le peuple de l'herbe (1996)
Director: Claude Nuridsany & Marie Perennou Written by: Claude
Nuridsany, Marie Perennou, Hughes Ryffel, and Thierry Machado
Cinematography: Claude Nuridsany & Marie Perennou Music: Bruno Coulais
I never thought an insect movie could be this thought provoking until I
watched "Microcosmos". Let me explain.
An ant milks some aphids on a branch. Enter a ladybug who feeds on the
aphids. The ant responds by knocking the ladybug of the branch. It tries
to climb back on, but on it's travels bumps into another ladybug. They
start copulating. My, my, the wonders of nature.
Here's another scenario. Remember snails, those slugs who wear a shell,
and are frequently trampled on if not eaten at a French restaurant.
Well, I've just learnt how they copulate. The sex was elegantly set to
the moving music of Opera. I'm not sure how to explain this, but it's
like velcro. I'm beginning to understand why it must have taken
directors Nuridsany and Pernnou so long to film this movie. Although,
they could have helped the process along by let's say sticking the
snails together, but you'd have fingers in the way, and that can really
spoil the mood. At least fifteen years of research hasn't gone down the
drain, we have this glorious footage of snails forever petrified in our
minds and on film. Ya gotta see it ta believe it.
It's not all about sex, even though much of nature is interconnected
with reproduction. We have a narrator Kristin Scott Thomas who speaks a
few words at the beginning and at the end of the movie. She does much
better here than in "The English Patient". There are lots of other
insects who scurry and flutter about the screen like busy human beings.
The most memorable performances are from a dung beetle with a
problematic dung ball; hardworking ants busy at work gathering food for
the winter months; a pheasant who makes a Godzilla entrance before
terrorising the ants; a thunderstorm in the middle of the day
reminiscent of an air raid; and an ending which deserves more that a
swat and "damned mosquito".
This movie was so profound and meditational that I could have slept
through it, but I didn't. Educational to say the least, but I longed for
violence let's say between the wasps and the bees, or the preying mantis
and the black widow spider, or the ants vs. the termites. Oh by the way,
if you've ever stuck a hose into an ant hole, then turned it on - don't
do it again, cause all their food supplies are down there. :-)

Title
Review for Siege, The (1998)
Cast: Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis, Tony Shalhoub,
Sami Bouajila.
Screenplay: Lawrence Wright and Menno Meyjes & Edward Zwick. Director:
Edward Zwick
In this tedious movie about terrorism and counter terrorism, we have
little to keep us interested throughout the movie except for the
constant berating of Denzel Washington as FBI agent, Anthony Hubbard.
The unconvincing, pretentious, smug role of Bruce Willis as a
questionable, unfeeling General or the silly, unintelligent part of
Annette Benning as CIA agent Elise Kraft who makes one too many wrong
calls, does not make this movie any better. When there are too many
security agencies involved in any single plot, one runs the risk of
spoiling the broth  and the result is this movie suffers from too many
people trying to get in on the act.
The Siege makes a point at the end about the misuse of power, and the
abuse of human rights when a city is placed under marshal law. However,
I feel the only thing this movie promotes is fear in people's heart.
With scenes that would no doubt encourage and inflame, Islamic extremist
fundamentalist groups to further terrorise the free world. With images
of buses, theatres, schools filled with innocent people blown to pieces,
one can only wonder why one would want play out such possibilities! I'm
sure someone like Bin Laden is probably somewhere in Saudi Arabia
thinking, that's a great idea  why don't we just blow up the FBI
headquarters in New York by driving a truck full of TNT through the
front entrance.

Title
Review for James and the Giant Peach (1996)
Cast: Paul Terry, Joanna Lumley, Miriam Margoyles, Pete Postlethwaite;
and the voices of Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, Simon Callow, David
Thewlis, and Jane Leeves Director: Henry Selick Producers: Denise Di
Novi and Tim Burton Screenplay: Karey Kirkpatrick, Jonathan Roberts, and
Steve Bloom based on the book by Roald Dahl
As a great fan of any Roald Dahl work and adaptation to screen, I was
greatly disappointed with the results of 'James', when compared to the
other recent adaptation of 'Matilda'. Perhaps the stick-like animated
figures used for the most part of this movie, was what I found the most
annoying and dissatisfying. One would expect Burton and Dahl to go hand
in hand, as one has a tendency to paint dark moodiness and quirkiness
into his characters and movies, whilst the other had an unhappy
childhood which is reflected in the penniless 'Charlie', the
disadvantaged 'Matilda' and the orphaned 'James'. However, this union is
not to be.
'The Nightmare Before Christmas' effects on 'James' elegantly highlights
Dahl's darker side, but somehow mutates that fine connection between
fantasy and reality which makes Dahl believable and likeable. The
cartoon stick figures have made this movie pure fantasy, and even a
child with the greatest imagination will have great difficulty putting
'James' into perspective when compared to 'Charlie' or 'Matilda'. Then
again this is one of Dahl's taller tales, I mean - giant, flying
rhinoceroses swallowing parents, flying to New York on a giant peach
pulled by 100 seagulls, and magical green crocodile tongues - really! I
have to admit that when I read the novel as a child, I believed every
word and remain to this day fascinated by the story of 'James'. Then
again a child's imagination is so much more creative and magical than
anything Hollywood could ever offer.
So I was disappointed by the look and portrayal of this story. 45
minutes into the movie I felt like ripping Mr Centipedes legs off, I
wanted to divide Earth Worm into quarters, there was an incredible urge
to grind Mrs Ladybug beneath my heels, followed by the desire to swat Mr
Grasshopper and to 'Mortein' Ms Spider. I couldn't remember so much
bickering aboard the crew of the Giant Peach. James looked anorexic and
anaemic, and I had an incredible urge to insert a peripheral venous
catheter and transfuse the poor lad with blood and parenteral nutrition.
Unwell,  I watched 'James' with a raging fever,
I had taken the day off to help the clouded mind recover,
Perhaps against my better judgement,
I thought 'James' would be the best medicine.
So my analysis may appear virally septic,
But I really did feel that 'James' would make me feel better,
Instead I needed peaceful slumber,
For watching this movie sure made me despise it.

Review for Ghost and the Darkness, The (1996)
Cast: Val Kilmer, Michael Douglas, John Kani, Tom Wilkinson, Bernard
Hill, Brian McCardi, Om Puri, Emily Mortimer Director: Stephen Hopkins
Screenplay: William Goldman Cinematography: Vilmos Zsigmond
'The Ghost' and 'The Darkness' are two man eating lions who share
everything. They have a cool lions' den where they collect human skulls;
they like feasting on railway workers; they watch the other's behind for
snipers; and their attacks are both co-ordinated and organised. Any Lion
psychologist will tell you that the behaviour of these lions is
aberrant. Man eating lions usually hunt alone; they don't go around
killing for pleasure; and they don't collect human trophies of their
victims. So we are left with the scenario of serial killer lions,
terrorising the subjects of the British Empire in late 19th century,
outback Africa. Sounds like a promising documentary-thriller when it's
all based on fact.
One begins to wonder half way through the movie, why two male lions
share such intriguing intimacy, and an unexplainable understanding of
each other. Is there perhaps something more 'sexual' behind this
'buddy-killer' relationship than meets the eye? I guess we'll never
know, now that their heads are mounted in some British museum; but an
interesting National Geographic thesis may have been 'The Mating Habits
of Two Male Lions - The Ghost and The Darkness.'
Things heat up in Africa when the lions go on a killing spree on the
tracks. Precious minutes tick away in the race to trans-rail the African
continent. Kernel John Patterson (Val Kilmer), the British supervisor
assigned to complete building a bridge in this race, becomes
increasingly annoyed and baffled by these lions. The pressure mounts as
co-workers, doctors and surveyors all wait to be feasted on.
Enter Mr Charles Remington (Michael Douglas), lion hunter extraordinare.
Sent to stop the blood bath caused by Lion Fever. He becomes good
buddies with Patterson; the result is an amazing on screen parallel
drawn between the two hunters vs the two lions. However, the
relationship between Patterson and Remington remains purely platonic,
but the same can't be said about these two intriguing, raunchy lions.
GROWWWWWL!

hippopotamus, but hypothalamus -- the brain stem) by the end of the
movie.
Yes, my heart jumped with every sudden movement and loud noise on
screen, and I had to shield my eyes with my file-o-fax when 'The Relic'
butchered humans; but the grandmothers sitting behind me seemed to
having a grand old time, giggling at every scene. Then it dawned on me
what they were laughing about, this movie was pure, contrived stupidity.
The story is about a relic in a large, old museum and you guessed it,
'The Relic' likes killing people. Lot's of cat and mouse chases, feeding
frenzies, festering fungi, enormous dung beetles and grouchy cops with
missing dogs.

Review for Nick of Time (1995)
Cast: Johnny Depp, Christopher Walken, Roma Maffia, Charles S. Dutton,
Marsha Mason Director: John Badham Screenplay: Patrick Sheane Duncan
As the minutes tick away, we get older each day. This is a real time'
movie so let's do this review real time.
12.00pm Depp arrives at the train station with his daughter.
(The door bell rings, it's the Jehovah Witnesses. Oh no not again!)
12.15pm Walken and companion kidnap Depp and his daughter. Kill the
governor, or your little girl dies!'
(Phone call. It's a survey on cars. Do I like B.M.W.s, Mercedes, or
Porsches? I like Toyotas thank-you very much).
12.30pm Depp arrives at the hotel with Walken breathing down his neck.
(Time for a toilet break.)
12.45pm The Governor's in the lift. Here's Depp's opportunity to shoot
her, but the gun's not loaded.
(What shall I have for lunch? Pizza? Kentucky? MacDonald's? Oh what the
heck let's go Italian.)
1.00pm Ooops. Depp's just missed his second opportunity to kill the
governor. The conspiracy unfolds.
(Pause button. Home made Italian -  Bolognese in the microwave. Ugggh!)
1.15pm Depp and the governor have a heart to heart at gun point.
(Dry cleaning, groceries, return the videos and work tomorrow! And
there's still a million and one things to do today.)
1.30m Finale. Finally.
(Now of to the gym before it closes for renovations, and I got there in
the nick of time!)
Ever feel like you were being rushed to finish something. Well that's
what this movie feels like. Too much time focussed on the clock ticking
away, and not enough time spent thinking through the mechanics of the
movie.
Solid performances by Depp and Walken. An original concept, and
occasionally tense.

Title
Review for Titanic (1997)
Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Frances Fisher, Kathy
Bates, David Warner, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart. Screenplay: James
Cameron. Director: James Cameron.
This movie will be remembered as James Cameron's ultimate labour of
love. With nothing denied the unborn child from conception to delivery.
Described as both meticulous and a perfectionist, Cameron the doting
father, has doted, doted, and doted 200 million away. Now the big fat
Turkey is ready for Thanksgiving. Slaughter it and serve it with lush
sauce and amaze those who are the most ready to applaud or shun the big,
fat juicy bird. Fortunately, the critics and the public are pleased with
the offering, and TITANIC is on its way to scooping a big mouthful of
titillating praise and a big handful of golden awards. Cameron seems to
have played his hand just right.  Delaying the monster's release from
mid-year to end-year, away from the other monster child releases ready
to take away attention from his spoilt offspring.
The December winter can only be as cold as the sinking water's of the
TITANIC. This will only warm the hearts of audiences as they watch
enough tragic love erupt on screen to melt ice caps. Throw in fine young
actors like Leornado Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, who both know how to
deliver a thoughtful script and whose undeniable screen presence,
transforms this otherwise ordinary disaster movie into the biggest love
story of the decade. The story is central, and without it TITANIC would
have been that sinking disaster SPEED 2 was. These young lovers engage
us with their hopeful tale of love, which transcends social class and
breeches cultural differences in order to find each other. As their love
blossoms, they are faced with challenges uncommon to young couples in
love. Shot, chained, trapped beneath flooded decks, only the icy waters
of death itself can separate these two young lovers. Cameron knows that
these characters are vital to this movie's survival, and wisely brings
them to the forefront of the picture before breathtakingly sinking the
big ship. That way we actually care about what happens, and in many ways
separates this adaptation from the other 101 TITANIC versions of the
same over told story.
There is also much else to compliment besides saying that the baby is a
joy to watch. Namely, the soundtrack the vital thread of heartbeat
sewing pieces of an epic together, carries with it the same breath of
emotion ready to sweep you away with tears of sorrow and mirth. The
costumes and sets have been lifted straight from the pages of late
nineteenth century living, and neither can be faulted or criticised for
the time period believability factor. Cameron has spared no expense in
this department, as has exerted himself to bring the TITANIC back from
the grave as realistically and gloriously as it was first envisioned.
The 全hip of Dreams' it was called, and Cameron has had to work damned
hard to make this dream come true.
My final comments are well done James. There is little to fault about
this movie except that it is a long sit, and if this is my only
complaint about this carefully crafted masterpiece, then I have only
myself to blame for being a overtly impatient person.

Title
Review for Blade (1998)
Cast: Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright,
Donal Logue.
Screenplay: David S. Goyer, based on the character published by Marvel
Comics.
Director: Stephen Norrington
In an age when sane, clean-cut superheroes like Superman, are becoming
redundant, up rises a new generation of wannabe superheroes, that are
labelled complex, on virtue of their personality disorders alone -
namely BATMAN, SPAWN and now BLADE. I guess today's generation finds a
hero with a dark psyche, more fascinating, and an anti-hero more
appealing.
In a day and age when vampire movies rarely see the light of day, a vain
attempt is made to bring life back into the genre. The creator has
decided to make Blade an extra special vamp with more blood on top. His
mom was bitten when he was still in her womb, thus giving Blade the
special powers of a vampire, yet retaining his humanity. Blade can fly
at night, but he can also walk in daylight.
This is pleasant enough, but one doesn't sense the anguish or turmoil of
what is like to be a half-breed. Wesley Snipes (BLADE) manages an
abandoned look whenever he discusses his inner torment, and convulses
adequately enough, whenever he takes a serum to suppress his blood
sucking urges; but this is a rather superficial look at a man-vampire
who is living in a nightmare. Like that other guy SPAWN (don't bother
watching), deep inside WE KNOW there is a lot more going on than just an
ability to kick butt, severe heads, dismember limbs and special effects.
Move over BUFFY, your days of coy vampire slaying are over. BLADE's
arrived and will give you a better run for your money when it comes to
high grade, state-of-the-art, artillery and weapons. Yes, the special
effects are good, and there is enough blood, explosions and noise to
satisfy the cravings of any violent viewer. A particular scene that
misuses the sprinkler system to feed vampires is not for the faint of
heart. The ending is also rather coy, where a blood sucking scene is
used to imitate love making, before BLADE is then inspired to beat the
bad guy, Frost (Stephen Dorf). Who says you shouldn't have sex before a
big match?

Title
Review for Bionic Ever After? (1994) (TV)
Directed by Stephen Stafford
Cast Lindsay Wagner (Jamie Sommers), Lee Majors (Steve Austin), Richard
Anderson (I) (Oscar Goldman), Farrah Forke, Martin E. Brooks (Ruby
Wells)
Written by Norman Morrill
Yes the bionic man and bionic woman finally get married, and about time.
Lindsay Wagner still looks great, and Lee Majors hides his cellulite
well.
This movie perhaps draws to a close what many viewers who watched the TV
series in the 70's have been waiting for; but before the pre-nuptials
are allowed to tie the knot, their love for each other must be go
through tests of adversity uncommon to ordinary couples.
Jamie's circuits are breaking down, her bionic arm is experiencing
similar symptoms to what humans would describe as Parkinson's disease;
her bionic ear is also playing up but what is the cause of her problems?
She believes she is dying and the plot for a moment delves into the
familiar territory of day time soap opera when Jamie calls the wedding
off because she doesn't want Steve to look after an invalid. She then
lapses into a coma and we are made to watch the bionic man reduced to
tears at her bed side.
At this point I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry with him. I was
hoping for a spectacular introduction in which Jamie and Steve kick
major butt with those wonderfully annoying metallic sounds of bionics at
work which we have become familiar with. But not so as half the movie is
wasted on the ins and outs of their personal relationship in which Oscar
Goldman becomes something of a marriage counsellor????
Steve insane with worry for Jamie needs to keep himself busy, so he
returns to work for Oscar Goldman and the O.S.I. His assignment takes
him to the Bahamas where he must rescue a group of hostages held captive
in the American Embassy. Jamie wakes from her coma with the help of Ruby
Wells, who discovers that somebody has planted a virus in her circuitry.
He fixes and upgrades her as we would a 486 to a Pentium II chip; she
now has night vision and very good aim. They discover the saboteur is an
O.S.I. operative on assignment with Steve who is out for revenge for
past wrongs. Jamie must now save Steve and the hostages and finally we
get to see some action.
Jamie knocks down doors, breaks chains and throws metal grates with the
same ease and charm she did two decades ago, and Steve -- well Steve's
got the virus and isn't much use, but he does save the day with his
bionic eye.
This is great material to reminisce over. The days when we waited with
great anticipation for every episode of the Six Million Dollar Man and
The Bionic Woman; when we dreamed of having as marvellous the technology
as they, so we could venture out to beat up the bad guys.

Title
Review for Mulan (1998)
Featuring the voices of: Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, B.D. Wong, Miguel
Ferrer, Harvey Fierstein, Pat Morita, Soon-Tek Oh, George Takei
Directors: Tony Bancroft, Barry Cook
Screenplay: Eugenia Bostwick-Singer, Rita Hsiao, Philip LaZebnik, Chris
Sanders, Raymond Singer
Music: Jerry Goldsmith
Songs by: Matthew Wilder and David Zippel
In one of the most politically correct Disney movies to date, we have a
female saving China in an era when male chauvinistic pigs dominated the
continent  and they still do! This is the tale of a legendary Chinese
heroine, Mulan, a folk tale of courage and honour handed down by mouth
over centuries. It is the time when China stands on the brink of
disaster, and the threat isn't the Japanese. The Huns of Mongols are
about to invade China from the north, and not even The Great Wall can
keep these big, hairy barbarians out.
A royal decree is issued by the Emperor, summoning a male from every
family to stand and defend the country against the Huns. Mulan's father
is crippled in the last war and like any strong-willed, progressive
thinking, independent female, Mulan decides she can take her father's
place by acting the man - and she does a great job! In fact Mulan looks
outright ugly as a girl, but when she cuts her hair and throws on the
manly garb - she blossoms into one of the spunkiest looking young studs
this side of the divide. Don't get the wrong idea, this isn't just a
story about cross-dressing - there's ALSO romance. The love interest is
none other that the general's son, Captain Shang who has been ordered to
train the recruits. Shang has an annoying tendency to bear his muscles
every opportunity he gets in front of a very flat chested Mulan. This
actually generates a buried sexual tension that erupts in the end when
Mulan not only saves China, but also the hunky Shang. When she is
wounded the secret is out, but how does a man brought up on the
traditionalist views of a male domineering society take to being saved
by a woman?
Hearing Donny Osmond sing, will bring tears to your eyes - and it's not
because he can sing. Lea Salonga is the leading Asian girl of Broadway,
and would have easily snared the singing part of Mulan with little
difficulty, if not due to lack of competition. As for the speaking
voices, Ming-Na Wen of THE JOY LUCK CLUB and THE SINGLE GUY, is ideal as
the spirited Mulan. Eddie Murphy generates a lot of the laughs as Mushu
the family dragon  somehow hearing him is easier than watching him.
If this movie doesn't make a father proud of his daughter, I'm not sure
what will. If only the boys of this day and age had more of the
character and initiative shown by MULAN, the world would be a better
place. Great family viewing.

Title
Review for Last Man Standing (1996)
Cast: Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson,
David Patrick Kelly, Ned Eisenberg, Alexandra Powers, Karina Lombard,
Michael Imperioli Director: Walter Hill Screenplay: Walter Hill based on
the story by Ryuzo Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa
Two rival mobster gangs vie for dominance in a small town along the
Mexican Border. Come Bruce Willis, a free lance, fast gunslinger for
hire to the highest bidder. He plays each gang to his best advantage,
swapping from side to side until he develops a handy conscience towards
the end of the movie; that's if helping two dames and killing everyone
else, can be considered developing a conscience?
Boys will be boys. However, when the measure of each boy's manhood
depends on the size of his toy gun, the "last man standing" will also be
the most childish. Bruce baby, the biggest boy with the quickest toy gun
gets to shoot the most bullets. The other boys get their far share of
gunfire, but all must resign to being shot by this boy, before the movie
ends. The gunfight scenes reminiscent of "Desperado" (without the
excessive ketchup/blood), can be described as "boy walks into saloon and
guns everyone and everything down". This makes good target practice, but
is nonetheless senseless. In which case it becomes meaningless for the
victims to raise their weapons in resistance; and in fairness the lines
"Please shoot me I'm over here!" should be added to the script for every
man downed.
Bruce Willis plays a wry, stone faced gunner who attempts to stare every
victim down before he executes them. This cool, expressionless glazed
stare is amusing to begin with; but becomes monotonous and confusing,
when used without discretion on the mob, the dame and the dame's boss.
It's the same look he gives to the mob before a gunfight, and to the
dame before bedtime. The only time we are mercifully spared the stare,
is when Brucy's face is beaten and bloodied; even then he develops an
annoying squint. It's a no win situation, so perhaps we should just
follow the precedence of "Darkman", and hide the man behind the hood.
Director Walter Hill has decided to use a yellow filter screen, to give
the movie the same feel as a wild west frontier "Outlaw/Wanted" poster.
As my young cousin commented "This movie looks too yellow!" My reply,
bless his heart, was "It's not yellow, it's just jaundiced."

Title
Review for 'Til There Was You (1997)
Cast: Jeanne Tripplehorn, Dylan McDermott, Sarah Jessica Parker,
Jennifer Aniston, Craig Bierko, Steve Antin, Patrick Malahide, Karen
Allen
Director: Scott Winant
Screenplay: Winnie Holzman
This movie should have been more aptly titled, ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE I
HAD SEX WITH, UNTIL THERE WAS YOU.'
Gwen Moss (Jeanne Triplehorn), had always thought that her parents were
the perfect couple. She imagined that when she grew up, she would meet
the man of her dreams and like her parents, live her life in perfect
marital bliss. Boy was she wrong.
The first man was `Divine', a handsome college professor of literature,
that was until she found out he was also fucking all the other boys and
girls in class. The second was `Right', a dashing publicist for the rich
and famous, that was until she found out he was obsessed with someone
else. The third was `Perfect', a childhood sweetheart running for mayor,
that was until she found out he cared more about his career than her.
All of these men, TILL THERE WAS YOU.
Nick Dawkan (Dylan McDermott), came from a broken home rife with
parental discord. Like everyone else, he was searching for true love.
His first love was purely `Sexual', a college sweetheart and we know
that a relationship based on sex, doesn't last. The second had great
`Looks', but that doesn't last either. The third was the result of a
childhood crush on a TV star (Sarah Jessica Parker). Immeasurable
expectations only breeds immeasurable disappointment, when the real
person does not live up to her on screen persona. All of these women,
TILL THERE WAS YOU.
So when Nick and Gwen meet over a cigarette, outside a Smoker's
Anonymous meeting room, how do we know they are right for each other?
They could simply be number four in the long line of sexual contacts. A
relationship based purely on we share something in common' (loneliness
and smoking), does not necessarily equate to true love. This is the
movie's major flaw. We are shown why their other relationships failed,
but we aren't shown why they are right for each other. They meet, they
look compatible, they have some common interests i.e. poetry, old
buildings, but this could simply be a prequel for a one-night-stand, and
not the precursor for a long lasting relationship.
Unfortunately, this is not the movie that will launch Jeanne Tripplehorn
or Dylan McDermott into the greater public eye. Sarah Jessica Parker, is
as usual, entertaining as the ex-childhood TV star.

Review for Addicted to Love (1997)
Cast: Meg Ryan, Matthew Broderick, Kelly Preston, Tcheky Karyo, Maureen
Stapleton, Nesbitt Blaisdell Director: Griffen Dunne Producers: Jeffrey
Silver, Bobby Newmyer Screenplay: Robert Gordon
The naive, 'milky way', 'farm boy' Astronomer (Broderick). Watches the
night skies with his 'guiding light', the telescope. Whose passion for
star gazing is only matched by his love for his childhood sweet heart,
The School Teacher. He is unceremoniously dumped in favour of The French
Chef.
The flighty School Teacher (Preston). As fresh as the spring day itself,
isn't honest about her mediocre feelings of like for the astronomer, and
falls for The French Chef as easily as one can say 'Bona Petite'. She
has a sappy, annoying tendency to write 'Dear John' letters which is an
unpardonable offence in the 'TMT Voon Books of Courting Etiquette'.
The arrogant, virile French Chef (Karyo) who is not so virile in France,
erects with surmounting fertile confidence in New York, and shamefully
uses The Photographer to get his Visa. His one saving grace is that he
truly is in love with The School Teacher.
The hurt, foul mouthed, bike riding, Photographer (Ryan) is out for
revenge. She'll do anything to bring the hard erections of the French
Chef down on his cocky head - rashes, cockroaches, monkeys with
lipstick, broken arms and ribs are all part of the days work. 'Hell hath
no fury like a woman's' and this is one angry bitch.
The camera obscura. Ahhhh, I need to get one of these so that I can
watch my neighbour plant her gardenias in her nighty. The reflections
will come out perfectly on my white wardrobe wall.
So my astrological charts say that because the 'Men are from Mars and
Women are from Venus', the testosterone loaded French Chef deserves the
flighty School Teacher - may their relationship be as passionate and
fleeting as these gods of love and war. Astronomically, the moon circles
the earth and the earth circles the sun. So opposites attract when the
Sun, 'The Astronomer', and the Moon, 'The Photographer' find some common
ground, the Earth 'revenge'. I also predict a supernova in the year
2500AD.
Intelligent, witty and original. Much appreciated for the effort Griffen
Dunne and Robert Gorden. Not big box office material, but this film will
probably age well with the passing of time as will most Meg Ryan movies.
The eternal youth Matthew Broderick continues to amaze me at how little
he has aged since 'Ferris Bueller's'. Kelly Preston is charmingly sweet,
and Karyo Tcheky carries that something 'French' which brings women to
their knees. Meg, charming, beautiful, funny Meg -  will have a special
place in my heart, whether she's geared in dark leathers with heavily
smeared metallic makeup, or a crazed woman stomping in knee deep mud in
'Restoration' or the slightly, ditzy girl looking for love in
'Sleepless'. She is Meg Ryan and one can't help loving her for who she
is.
The bottom line is that we can't choose whom we fall in love with. So in
the end past wrongs must be settled and confessions made, before this
fiasco of revenge is resolved. Perhaps the means of coming to terms with
being dumped is not the most appropriate, or the most mature - but it
was sure fun to watch.

Review for Waking Ned Devine (1998)
Cast:  Ian Bannen, David Kelly, Fionnula Flanagan, James Nesbitt, Susan
Lynch, Brendan F. Dempsey.
Screenplay:  Kirk Jones.
Producers:  Glynis Murray and Richard Holmes.
Director:  Kirk Jones.
Who wants to be a millionaire? If you were Marilyn Monroe, the answer
would be to be to marry one. If you were Demi Moore, you would probably
sleep with one. If you were Nicholas Cage and Bridget Fonda, you would
lose it and then find it again through charity. If you were in an Agatha
Christie movie you would probably murder one. However, if you were Ned
Devine, you would win it and then cack it.
Yes, there's a dead guy in this movie, with a 7 million lottery ticket
and everyone in town is trying to steal it. Although there are moments
of tension when everyone is trying to fool the tattslotto man, or humour
when riding naked on a motorcycle, or a bit of competition when trying
to mate with the pig farmer's lay, and a bit of Irish humour which after
awhile runs dry.
I sat through this movie wandering what had transpired through 90
minutes of screening time. After awhile, I realised it was all about
stealing money and getting away with it. Where was the heart in this
movie, outside greed? Did they truly feel remorseful about stealing a
dead man's winnings? But none of these questions were left answered.
Which left me wandering is there more to life than just winning the
lottery?

Title
Review for Newton Boys, The (1998)
Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Skeet
Ulrich,  Dwight Yoakam, Julianna Margulies, Chloe Webb, Charles Gunning
Director: RichardLinklater
Producer: Anne Walker-McBay
Screenplay: Claude Stanush, Clark McBay, Richard Linklater
What could possibly go wrong if your simplest philosophies in life were
- don't kill anyone and its okay to rob banks because they steal from
farmers? If you're wandering who I am referring to, its none other than
the infamous Newton brothers, those Yankee thieves who got away with
emptying the vaults of more than 60 banks across the nation, plus
pocketing more than 3 million big ones in their finale of a mail train
heist.
But to be honest, I had never heard of the NEWTON BOYS until today.
However, this does not pose as a problem, because when you realise that
this unique story is based on fact and not merely fictional, it makes it
all the more amazing. These boys on first appearances are genuine,
regular decent looking lads, who you would probably trust with looking
after your house if on holiday.
The cast is impressive. Matthew McConaughey heads this cast of young
popular Hollywood actors to hit the screen. He is Willis Newton, the
mastermind and motivator of the brothers. Ethan Hawke plays Jess Newton,
the carefree, less responsible brother with a sense of humour who
carries the same vein of womanising, heavy drunkeness of older,
irresponsible brother Doc Newton, played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Finally,
there is the sweet, good-natured Joe Newton played by Skeet Ulrich, who
is more even tempered here than when last seen in SCREAM.
Overall, an interesting historical dramatisation, for anyone interested
in a piece of American Hill Billy pop culture.

Title
Review for Matrix, The (1999)
Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving,
Joe Pantoliano.
Screenplay:  Larry Wachowski and Andy Wachowski.
Producer:  Joel Silver.
Directors:  Larry Wachowski and Andy Wachowski.
In one of the slickest movies to arrive in our cinema this year, we have
Keanu Reeves and ensemble gang members donning leathers gunning down
computer generated anti-virus programmes, and anyone standing in
between.
Issues:
1. Can a movie such as Matrix tip hormonally-charged, acne-ridden
adolescent teenagers into gunning down their schoolmates? Possible in
theory, but made impossible without the existence of guns.
2. What is the Matrix? It's not a non-alcoholic cocktail, it's not a
formula for cold fusion, and it's not another name for the Rubik's Cube.
But it does smell of computer generated world used to house human guinea
pigs for energy.
3. Who got to keep all the leathers after shooting the movie finished?
Was it real leather or imitation? A budget of more than 100 000 000
answers this question.
4. Can Keanu Reeves act? Yes, but he was still better as Bill, or was it
Ted?
5. Was the movie boring? I watched it twice, but my best friend fell
asleep and the guy on the other side of me started snoring.
6. On action and special effects. What you see on the ads is really what
you get. Lots of smooth, streamlined karate kicks and bullet dodging.
7. Will my girlfriend like it? She will probably end up fantasising
about Keanu, leaving you feeling like an overweight jerk, who has done
little with his life. WARNING: Keanu Reeves is looking devastatingly
good in this movie; this movie should not be viewed by any male
individual who has a poor self image, or is on the verge of commiting
suicide.
8. Will there be a sequel? Probably.

Title
Review for Preacher's Wife, The (1996)
Cast: Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston, Courtney B. Vance, Gregory
Hines, Jenifer Lewis, Loretta Devine, Justin Pierre Edmund Director:
Penny Marshall Screenplay: Nat Mauldin and Allan Scott based on a
screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood and Leonardo Bercovici
"Father I ask of You this day,
Keep my loved ones safe and guide their ways.
Bless the selfless heart that freely gives,
And strengthen those who truthfully live.
Bid your angels to watch these humble souls,
And send that angel 'Dudley' to fulfil Your goals ."
   Amen. A prayer by TMT Voon.
Angels once walked on the earth as did men. Able to disguise themselves
as human kind they walked unnoticed amongst the people doing God's
bidding. Whether you believe there are angels or not, does not
discourage the hope of some, that these messengers of God protect and
encourage His own. So when the pastor of a rough neighbourhood begins
to feel the emotional and physical drains of daily service to the
community, God sends an angel called 'Dudley' to help lighten his
burdens.
Denzel Washington is the cuddly 'Dudley', wearing a very well made,
?Armani? grey suit with matching tie and overcoat. This suit is the envy
of every well dressed person; and since Whitney Houston has good taste
in clothes, she just can't keep her hands of this cuddly 'Dudley' in the
Armani. Whitney goes shopping with the angel in the grey suit. Then goes
dancing with the angel still in the grey suit, before skating with the
angel who is still wearing the grey suit. One wonders at this stage
whether this angel has anything to wear beside the grey suit????
This movie is another well-meant project by Penny Marshall which has
perhaps fallen short of great expectations. I'm not sure whether Whitney
gave them hell on the set of this movie, but she sure sings like an
angel. Denzel smiles sweetly, and is all pleasantness as the angel
Dudley. However, such restraint begins to wear thin behind those
white-tooth grins - let that 'Devil In A Blue Dress' out Denzel.
To the depressed and disillusioned pastors of this world, I have a few
simple words of advice. The business of church work, sacrifice and
giving is an important testimony for the Christian faith, but don't
forget why you are doing it in the first place. Like any other job, one
needs to rest, or you'll end up neglecting yourself and your family.
Remember even God needed a "Kit Kat" on that 7th day.

Review for Different for Girls (1996)
Cast: Steven Mackintosh, Rupert Graves, Miriam Margolyes, Saskia Reeves
Director: Richard Spence
Producer: John Chapman
Screenplay: Tony Marchant
There has been a movie made for almost every sexual encounter possible.
A man meets a woman they have sex (most movies), a man meets a man they
have sex (PRIEST), a woman meets a woman they have sex (BASIC INSTINCT),
a man meets a man dressed as woman they have sex (THE CRYING GAME) and
vice versa (TWELFTH NIGHT). So why is it DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS? Well, as
far as I know, this is one of the few films that deals with man meets
tran-sexual and they have sex.
The man we are referring to is Prentice (Rupert Everett), an
on-the-edge, adult-with-adolescent-complex, lacking-social-graces
misfit, who was once great friends with an effeminate guy named Karl
(Steven Mackintosh), in high school. The movie opens with Karl sensually
washing himself like a girl in the school shower, but when Karl becomes
Kim, instead of remaining sensual, he becomes a bit of an uptight,
prissy aristocrat. Steven Mackintosh does not seem to suit this role
well. He comes across as a bit of a Martina Navratilova - butch and
heavy-handed. If they wanted to make this movie a sensitive, romantic
piece they should have hired an actress to play the role of the
tran-sexual instead.
The whole film is a lead up to a moment where Kim gets to talk about her
skin softening with oestrogen replacement, her breasts getting larger
and fuller, the areolar darkening, inevitable giving Prentice a hard on.
The situation then leads to Prentice becoming confused about his sexual
orientation, followed by flashing his manhood around the neighbourhood,
before being arrested and assaulted by the police. Kim and Prentice then
put their personal and sexual differences aside and hop into bed. It is
here that Prentice gets to say ludicrously funny lines like, Oh my God
it fits', like he was expecting it not too. Before a trite ending where
they sell the Karl becomes Kim' story to a newspaper, buy an apartment
and ride off on a motor cycle like Easy Riders'.
If you were ever confused about the issues of tran-sexualism, this movie
will not clarify it further.

Review for Newton Boys, The (1998)
Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Skeet
Ulrich,  Dwight Yoakam, Julianna Margulies, Chloe Webb, Charles Gunning
Director: RichardLinklater
Producer: Anne Walker-McBay
Screenplay: Claude Stanush, Clark McBay, Richard Linklater
What could possibly go wrong if your simplest philosophies in life were
- don't kill anyone and its okay to rob banks because they steal from
farmers? If you're wandering who I am referring to, its none other than
the infamous Newton brothers, those Yankee thieves who got away with
emptying the vaults of more than 60 banks across the nation, plus
pocketing more than 3 million big ones in their finale of a mail train
heist.
But to be honest, I had never heard of the NEWTON BOYS until today.
However, this does not pose as a problem, because when you realise that
this unique story is based on fact and not merely fictional, it makes it
all the more amazing. These boys on first appearances are genuine,
regular decent looking lads, who you would probably trust with looking
after your house if on holiday.
The cast is impressive. Matthew McConaughey heads this cast of young
popular Hollywood actors to hit the screen. He is Willis Newton, the
mastermind and motivator of the brothers. Ethan Hawke plays Jess Newton,
the carefree, less responsible brother with a sense of humour who
carries the same vein of womanising, heavy drunkeness of older,
irresponsible brother Doc Newton, played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Finally,
there is the sweet, good-natured Joe Newton played by Skeet Ulrich, who
is more even tempered here than when last seen in SCREAM.
Overall, an interesting historical dramatisation, for anyone interested
in a piece of American Hill Billy pop culture.

Title
Review for Glimmer Man, The (1996)
Cast: Steven Seagal, Keenan Ivory Wayans, Bob Gunton, Brian Cox,
Michelle Johnson, John Jackson, Stephen Tobolowsky Director: John Gray
Screenplay: Kevin Brodbin
101 Dalai Lama brownie points, and full marks for donating some of the
proceeds of this movie to the Tibetan cause - earning Segal the title of
'Tulku' (reincarnated lama); but all that glitters is not gold, and the
only glimmer in this movie is sadly a fish out of water.
He has chosen the oriental look, dresses like a monk with a pony tail,
has put on a bit of weight, but beneath all his exterior show of
Buddhism is Steven Segal. It was hard to picture him as the same man who
had played the knife wielding chef of 'Under Siege.'
The plot is even more difficult to comprehend. What is the possibility
that an ex-mercenary, turned cop, now becomes involved with a serial killer
who crucifies his victims including Segal's ex-wife; but in truth there
are two killers, also a wealthy business man trying to murder his step
son, and a partner (Wayans) who cries every time he sees 'Casablanca'
and eats 'deer penis' for his allergies.

Title
Review for To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday (1996)
Cast: Peter Gallagher, Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathy Baker,
Wendy Crewson, Bruce Altman, Laurie Fortier, Freddie Prinze Jr.
Director: Michael Pressman Producers: Marykay Powell and David E. Kelley
Screenplay: David E. Kelley based on the play by Michael Brady
Gillian (Michelle Pfeiffer) died on her 35th birthday. This fun,
carefree, high risk taking, radical mother and loving wife climbed one
pole too high before falling to her death. Two years later she's roaming
the beaches outside her home communicating with her husband at night.
They mostly chat, and roll around in the waves, but she's real enough to
touch, kiss and hug but they never do. I guess Whoopi Goldberg isn't
around to help mediate the kiss between the living and the dead. So on
her 37th birthday, Gillian's family and friends gather to remember her
in most unusual ways. With a weekend of karaoke singing, sand castle
building and a feast of family melodrama.
There's a lot of "remember this" and "remember that" banter between
living husband and dead wife who wallow with nostalgia. Michelle
Pfeiffer giggles like an adorable wife, and occasionally throws in a
serious expression to show that she's not a single dimensional ghost.
Peter Gallagher is the forlorn husband who wanders the beaches at night
searching for his dead wife. He doesn't use his thick lips to the best
advantage as he pouts and throws moody tantrums. These lips would look
far better planted firmly on the mouth of Ms Pfeiffer. More kiss and
less talk is needed in this movie. Clare Danes throws in a convincing
performance as the distressed teenage daughter, whose loyalty to her
father is torn by the intrusion of her Aunt (Kathy Baker).
Eventually this movie reaches the conclusion that one has to leave the
past behind before one can progress into the future. It's a good point
to make, but it doesn't save Gillian's birthday party from being a long,
overdrawn droll sit. Without the birthday girl, the party is as dead as
Gillian's corpse. Midway through the movie it becomes evident that the
husband needs to leave his dead wife behind him, if he is to rebuild his
life. The only problem is that the ghost won't leave the poor man alone.
She keeps saying "I won't come anymore if you don't want me to" - yeah
like her love sick hubby is going to tell her not to come. If only
Gillian had been a little more sensible there would be no goodbyes to be
said yet, and if there were goodbyes to be made - it should have been
short, snappy and to the point. That way everyone can get on with their
lives, including the audience.

Title
Review for Peacemaker, The (1997)
Cast: George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Marcel Iures, Gary Werntz, Holt
McCallany, Alexander Baluev, Rene Medvesek, Michael Boatman, Armin
Mueller-Stahl Director: Mimi Leder Screenplay: Michael Schiffer
After watching too many movies where the bad guys are the Russians, the
Chinese, the entire Eastern block and now the Bosnians, AND the good
guys are none other than the Americans (once again), I badly need to see
a movie where the American's lose big time. And I think the most likely
place to find the product of such a fantasy would most likely be in Iraq
i.e. Hussein productions. Not that I have anything against the Americans
winning all the time, but I'm in great need of a different perspective
on life.
Once again in this movie 'The Peacemaker' the safety of the United
States is once again under threat by some very angry Bosnians who blame
the US and the UN for their problems. This brings to mind that too often
repeated statement by Nicole Kidman - "I'm not afraid of the man who has
ten nuclear warheads, I'm afraid of the one who only wants one." My
trite reply to this is - "Give me ten nuclear warheads and I'll show you
who to be afraid of." I'm a peaceable, easy going kind of a guy, but in
this movie I had this incredible urge to want to see the terrorist
succeed. Of course I wouldn't want anyone injured, but I felt the dire
urge for the bomb to go off, and with it that grand delusion that the
United States is the greatest nation on this earth.
Of course I've seen New York, Washington and Dallas enveloped in flames
i.e. "Independence Day", but that doesn't really count. When the world
is under threat from big bad aliens, of course I'm going to side with
the Americans. So this new movie from SKG productions aims at the heart
of the great nation, drawing on the wild card of patriotism and a threat
to the people. It's a safe tactic to play when the plot and script isn't
solid engrossing material. The SKG team has decided on the leading man
for the moment (George Clooney) to help boost this movie's popularity
and banked on an actress who is both attractive and a constant solid
performer (Nicole Kidman). However, this does not save "The Peacemaker"
from its otherwise very ordinary make. The ending gets as improbable as
Nicole Kidman dismantling a nuclear device with a pen knife in 2.5
minutes; which is more ludicrous than an American President kicking butt
on a hijacked plane if you ask me.

Title
Review for Red Corner (1997)
Cast: Richard Gere, Bai Ling, Bradley Whitford, Byron Mann Director: Jon
Avnet Screenplay: Robert King, Ron Koslow
Who better than Richard Gere, to star in a movie which shouts political
views against the Chinese Communist Regime? We know much of this to be
true - the suppression of free speech, the unfairness of the judicial
system, the misrepresentation and maltreatment of prisoners, the
totalitarian nature of it all; but to make a movie about it when you're
buddies with the Dalai Lama, well isn't that just a tincy wincy bit
biased? If one wanted to explore the paranoid, unfair nature of the
Chinese Government properly - make a documentary. But to entwine the
political story line with the fanciful murder of a General's daughter
(Jessey Meng), a framed business man (Gere) and then to finish it with a
deep meaningful relationship with a Chinese lawyer (Bai Ling), is too
much even for me.
I was expecting a love story, but instead I found murder and intrigue.
It is difficult to believe that a powerful businessman would become the
unwitting target of Chinese government officials. Nevertheless, anything
is possible. Gere the businessman is accused of murdering the beautiful
model Hong Ling, the daughter of a powerful Chinese official. Gere's
character then goes through a round the mill sequence of maltreatment in
prisons and numerous attempts on his life, all conveniently ignored by
the 'evil' Chinese Government. I do not doubt that these cruel scenes
are meant to raise anti-Chinese sentiment. However, when his initially
pro-Chinese defence lawyer Shen Yuelin falls in love with him, then
decides to speak against the corrupt Chinese judicial system -
believability becomes a problem. This sinks to further melodrama when
Gere gets mushy about Yuelin and sacrifices himself to protect her
safety. This lies beyond my comprehension. They've only known each other
for a week and they can't even communicate well with each other.
This problem with this movie lies in the fact that it can't make up it's
mind whether to be a piece of anti-Chinese propaganda or a love story
about one woman's belief in another man's innocence. The resulting
effect is mixed feelings and odd moments. The attempt to combine the two
ideas doesn't work well, especially when the acting isn't a highlight.
SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET does a better job at causing China to lose face in
the eyes of the world. This movie merely pokes its tongue at the great
eastern power, but doesn't give the viewer much more insight than that.

Title
Review for Xian dai hao xia zhuan (1993)
Yes the femme fatales are back with a vengeance. Wonder Woman (Anita
Mui), Invisible Woman (Michelle Yeoh) and The Thief Catcher (Maggie
Cheung).
If you consider yourself male then consider yourself an endangered
species in this movie. Males are good for providing temporary love
interests, before being efficiently disposed off. So let's rid the movie
of waste products like husbands and boyfriends, and once again THE
HEROIC TRIO can remain focus on their mission  the defeat of a
powerful, chemically enhanced mutant, monopolising clean water in post
apocalyptic Hong Kong.
Gone is the light-hearted humour sprinkled over action packed sequences
that laced the original movie. Instead this episode is filled with the
dark undertones of a suffering oppressed society. So much so that our
heroines are perpetually morose and depressed, not the chirpy female
vixens that dressed loudly and mightily kicked arse in the original.
What ultimately killed this movie for me, was when my favourite Chinese
actress, Michelle Yeoh was sacrificed  that was the last straw, an
unforgivable move. When this happened I lost all interest in what
happened next and wished that a sequel was never made to the delightful
original HEROIC TRIO, now sadly the HEROIC DUO.
Disappointing, very disappointing.

Title
Review for There's Something About Mary (1998)
Director: Bobby Farrelly & Peter Farrelly
Writers: Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly & Ed Decter & John J. Strauss
Cast: Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller, Lee Evans, Chris Elliott
There certainly is something about Mary. In one of the funniest and
darkest comedies this year we have a mixture of the vile and the
hilarious, that will keep you simultaneously shocked and amused at the
same time. This seems to be the winning combination for the Farrelly
brother team.
Cameron Diaz is undeniably charming as Mary, who has up to five guys
obsessed with her throughout the movie, if not the entire male audience.
She is the gal of every straight guy's fantasy  pretty, wholesome,
intelligent and outright nice. Of course a woman like Mary doesn't exist
in the real world, that's why we have Hollywood to create the illusion.
There's a lot to disbelieve about Mary, but because we are always
looking for the perfect someone, she exists in all of us.
This movie has interesting ways of dealing with issues like
masturbation, kissing dogs, wrinkled breasts, hair gel, missing sperm,
intellectually disabled people, hives, testes and zippers. Every time
you are on the brink of throwing up, the humour some how pulls you back
in time before you barf in shock. It is a dangerous tight rope of
balancing what is acceptable to watch on screen and pushing the limits
of the viewer's tolerance. This could easily have been a disaster if it
was just out to shock, but the witty script and intelligent plotting
saves the day and somehow makes Mary a success, when it could easily
have been a Turkey.
Other notable notes is Matt Dillon, who plays against his usual
stereotypic role of body hunk and plays a sleaze with big teeth,
graciously. Ben Stiller is wonderfully naďve and everybody else seems to
team up extremely well, making Mary one of the zanniest experiences
you'll come across this Spring.

Title
Review for Chain Reaction (1996)
Cast: Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, Rachel Weisz, Fred Ward, Kevin Dunn,
Brian Cox, Joanna Cassidy Director: Andrew Davis Screenplay: Michael
Bortman and J. F. Lawton
Make Keanu Reeves look like a hooligan and pretend he's intelligent;
throw in a implausible plot; add special effects which look dull and
mediocre; use up fifty million in production costs, and you have created
for yourself a recipe for disaster.
When Mr Reeves spoke his first word, I felt the impending doom of this
movie.
The story centers about a group of scientists who have discovered cold
fusion. They succeed, but their research and lab are completely
destroyed by a seemingly evil group of industrialists, who do not want
to lose their monopoly on natural fuel resources. Reeves is at the wrong
place at the wrong time, and he and another scientist are framed for the
accident.
This story goes from nowhere to nowhere. Lot's of running about in which
the good guys are the bad guy, and the CIA is somehow involved. Don't
ask me for details cause I kinda dozed ..
Comment: Put it in the nuclear waste disposal basket please.

Review for Ever After (1998)
Director:  Andy Tennant
Cast:  Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, Dougray Scott, Patrick Godfrey,
Megan Dodds, Melanie Lynskey Screenplay:  Susannah Grant, Andy Tennant,
Rick Parks
In an odd, but ever charming retelling of a dramatised version of the
Cinderella story, gone is the fairy Godmother, mice and pumpkin, but
remaining is an intelligent, witty Cinder girl (Drew Barrymore), who
reads her father's copy of UTOPIA in her spare time. Present still is
the wicked stepmother (Angelica Huston) and two sisters  one evil and
the other not. One may expect that this story may not go down well with
audiences because it strays too far from the original fairy tale, but it
carries with it, such odd charm that one cannot help but smile and like
it. For example, the friendly banter between the strong-willed,
thoughtful Danielle (Cinderella) and her depressed, disillusioned prince
brings out much humour. For once we are shown why they get along and are
attracted to one another, although not initially. This fairs better than
the romanticised versions of the same tale, which presume that they fall
in love, just because they're both good looking. Although at times the
dialogue wavers between 17th and 20th century English, this is easily
overlooked and is not so much an annoyance but instead unintentionally
funny. This story of a French prince who finds his match in a commoner
may be far fetched, but at least it leaves us with hope that behind
every fairy tale, lies a true story, ever after.

Review for Hercules (1997)
Featuring the voices of: Tate Donovan, Joshua Keaton, Roger Bart, Danny
DeVito, James Woods, Susan Egan, Rip Torn, Samantha Eggar, Bobcat
Goldthwait, Matt Frewer Directors: Ron Clements and John Musker
Screenplay: John Musker, Ron Clements, Bob Shaw, Don McEnery, Irene
Mecchi Music: Alan Menken Lyrics: David Zippel
I was excited when I heard that Disney's next new animated classic
"Hercules", would be brought to us by the creators of "Alladin". I
unrealistically expected material that carried the same humour, style
and wit; instead I found substance more reminiscent of a "Care Bear"
movie. I didn't realise that there were so many hues of "pastel" until I
visited "Mt Olympus" where every god and demigod is colour coded by
bright blues, oranges, reds and greens, embalmed in a shimmer of gold
(to show they are gods, and not just colour pencils). Perhaps these
artists have become tired of pencilling the realistic cartoon feel we
have come to expect form Disney; but going to the other extreme, and
ending up with something of an "Asterix" comic is rather amusing.
The next annoying feature was the use of "Gospel music" to help liven a
"Greek Tragedy"? Those damn sexy muses kept singing - "That's the Gospel
Truth" at the end of every commentary song, which left me wandering
whether Jesus Christ was going to suddenly make an entrance???? He
didn't.
Hercules is boring, clumsy and pure muscle with no brain. Sure this is a
"Coming of Age" movie where, boy becomes man, freak becomes famous, geek
becomes hero blah blah blah. Yeah, but in truth "We Don't Need Another
Hero". So I kept wishing Tina Turner would burst onto the screen and do
a number. She didn't.
Hades, looks like a creation from a "Beavis and Butthead" episode, and
may be mistaken for their missing triplet "Matchstick", if given half a
chance. Sure James Woods has a nice low, droll voice; who spits snippets
of wry cutting one liners, making him a hell hole of a tough Don; but
when compared to other recent Disney villains like "Jafar" and "Ursula",
he pales.
The two imps "Pain" and "Panic" come only second on my scale of
annoying, failed sidekick generated humour. Ranked first is still the
poodle and racoon from "Pochahontas". They weren't allowed to speak in
that movie, so perhaps these imps should have kept their mouth shut
throughout this one.
By far the most interesting character is "Meg", who exudes sensuality
with every hip swing, head toss, and eye blink. Whose "come ons" and
tantalising teasing makes Hercules' muscles go hard. Perhaps the movie
should have centred more around her, because without her Hercules would
have been pure meatballs without the spaghetti. Meg's musical number
with the Muses is probably this movie's highlight. I started to yawn
when the Hydra's head started to multiply by the thousands.
So "Hercules" has not quite lived up to the myth in set out to be. It's
not as romantic as "Beauty and the Beast"; not as humorous or lively as
"Alladin"; not as thoughtful and sensitive as "Hunchback"; not about
silly lions; but it's still way, way, way, way better than that little
Indian princess.

Title
Review for Heaven's Prisoners (1996)
Cast: Alec Baldwin, Mary Stuart Masterson, Kelly Lynch, Teri Hatcher,
Eric Roberts, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Samantha Lagpacan Director: Phil
Joanou Screenplay: Harley Peyton and Scott Frank based on the novel by
James Lee Burke
Does anybody know why this movie is called Heaven's Prisoners? The only
connection I can make is the fact that the wife gets shot and maybe goes
to Heaven. Have I missed an important point somewhere in this movie? Or
is 'Heaven' the name of the place where they live?
I had great difficulty understanding this complex (=confusing) movie
about a plane crash; a rescued 'please adopt me because I'm so cute'
Spanish girl; a flask carrying, smooth talking, 'sleep with me' tattooed
vixen; a lonely-hearts, 'love me or leave me' stripper; a 'kill me in
the first fifteen minutes', bullet-riddled wife; a 'have you been
sleeping with my wife - I'm going to punch you anyway' childhood friend;
some angry drug dealers and a vengeful ex-dick?
This movie based on a novel written by James Lee Burke, feels as though
the director has decided to randomly rip pages from the book, before
pasting it's remains to create a movie. I have never felt this
disjointed or confused about anything, except for the time I dislocated
my shoulder playing basketball, then lapsed into temporary bliss when
the pethidine kicked in.
The cast is no better. Kelly Lynch is terminated before she can
demonstrate any signs of emotion. Terri Hatcher gets to pout and show
all of her emotions from A to C, and unfortunately isn't disposed of
sooner. Mary Stuart Masterson who normally plays the 'girl next door',
is wasted as a stripper who never shows her wares; and Eric Roberts
'Bubba', looks like he's just attended Whoopi Goldberg's school on hair
braiding skills. The only person with any admirable talent is Baldwin
who plays the tortured, emotionally wrecked husband much better than he
does the vengeful ex-detective. Here take a tissue Alec you deserve it.
There's also a plentiful supply of sultry, sassy, southerners with great
slurring accents. Who don't walk, but strut; don't perspire but sweat.
Who settle misunderstandings the old fashioned way (with fists). Where
strippers are known synonymously as whores, and unfaithful wives are
executed by trigger happy husbands; and it's called 'Heaven's
Prisoners'???

Go'?

Review for Soldier (1998)
Starring:  Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, Connie Nielsen, Jason Isaacs,
Gary Busey, Sean Pertwee.
Screenplay:  David Webb Peoples.
Director:  Paul Anderson.
Numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi,
suspense thrillers. Soldier is a multicrossbreed between the likes of
Terminator, Aliens and offspring. The problem with such mixed genes is
that the final product is a real mongrel  not well made and should have
been put down before production got off the ground. Besides this, the
action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this
day and age. The fight scenes between Jason Scott Lee and Kurt Russell
seem laboured, slow and sluggish, and could have done with better
choreography. Russell who is usually a good actor in B-Grade action
flicks is unusually hampered by his character  Sergeant Todd, who seems
more like a Sergeant Toad. Besides having almost no dialogue, his
character appears stunted, zombie-like which is in line with his screen
persona, but scores little points of empathy with the audience. This
movie has not made me change my opinion about director Paul Anderson,
whose last epic Event Horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my
mouth. Although this movie does not come anywhere close to the
strangeness of former, it is still a long way from anything considered
desirable.

Title
Review for Twelfth Night: Or What You Will (1996)
Cast: Helena Bonham Carter, Imogen Stubbs, Nigel Hawthorne, Richard E.
Grant, Ben Kingsley, Mel Smith, Imelda Staunton, Toby Stephens, Steven
Mackintosh, Nicholas Farrell Director: Trevor Nunn Screenplay: Trevor
Nunn based on the play by William Shakespeare
Shakespeare is a visionary. This comic tale of mistaken identities,
cross-dressing and love triangles is way ahead of its time. The Master
of mirth and mire has impeccable timing, when it comes to awkward
situation comedy. This is no exception.
Picture the scenario of almost identical twins, a he and a she who are
lost at sea. The she-twin, Viola, (Imogen Stubbs), survives and arrives
in a land where a Duke (Toby Stephens) is infatuated with the
neighbouring Countess (Helena Bonham Carter). Viola assumes the
personage of a male, and finds work as the Duke's steward, before
becoming his closest confidante. She is sent as a messenger of love from
the Duke to the Countess, and unwittingly becomes the Countess's object
of passion. At the same time Viola bares a secret love for the Duke.
Thus, forming a love triangle uncommon for its time.
Amusing moments of note. When Viola has her breasts strapped, an
absolute look of delight crosses her face. At the end of the day when
the breasts are finally unstrapped the look of absolute pain, is
replaced with a look of absolute relief. Sexual tensions mount as the
Countess loses any understanding of personal space, and literally throws
herself at Viola with every opportune moment. At the same time, Viola
unavoidably keeps intruding into the Duke's personal space at the most
inopportune moment i.e. when he's taking a bath and needing a scrub on
the back, or when listening to a minstrel, comes close enough to kiss.
Anybody with a sound mind could tell a man from a woman, especially back
in the days when hormonal therapy wasn't an option. Imogen Stubbs does
her best to be as manly as possible, but the low voice and wispy
moustache is as effective as trying to strap down her chest. Helena
Bonham Carter grows more enchanting as she grows older, and the rest of
the well known cast - Ben Kingsley, Nigel Hawthorne, Richard E. Grant
etc. play supporting roles of side characters, who remain confusingly
anonymous until midway through the movie. Again, it is the language of
Shakespeare, which remains the true winning element of this movie.

Title
Review for Wag the Dog (1997)
Cast: Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Anne Heche, Woody Harrelson, Denis
Leary, Andrea Martin, Willie Nelson, Suzie Plakson, Kirsten Dunst,
William H. Macy Director: Barry Levinson Screenplay: David Mamet &
Hilary Henkin, based on the book by Larry Beinhart
What a silly name for a movie that's all about deception and the use of
tele-media to deceive a nation (USA), in the upcoming Presidential
Elections. The saying goes - a dog will wag it's tail, but if the tail
is smarter than the dog, it will WAG THE DOG. I get it  meaning the
president is the rear end and the American people are comparative to a
dog's body. But wouldn't a better title be HOW MANY WAYS CAN YOU WANK A
GREAT NATION?
The entire premise and punch line for the movie rests on the absurdly
hilarious, although very possible situations created by the US
Presidential Party into making their country believe that they are at
war with another nation (Albania of all places). The idea is divert
attention away from the President's sexual misconduct with a girl scout,
in order to win the upcoming elections in the remaining few days. This
is overall fun, especially the recreated scenes of an Albanian refugee
(Kirsten Dunst) escaping from terrorist fire, the production of the
sentimental, ever reliable war hero trapped behind enemy lines (Woody
Harrelson), and Willie Nelson's wonderful song making talents used to
recreate heart moving lyrical tunes about Old Shoes'. The idea is
refreshing and entertaining, but also a sad miscalculation by Barry
Levinson (director), in relying so heavily on this one movie gimmick
which eventually runs dry.
The Hollywood producer of the entire scam is Dustin Hoffman, who is not
particularly exciting, but gets an Academy nomination for his
performance anyway. Robert De Niro or Anne Heche are otherwise plausible
as Presidential campaigners who work hard to win the election.
This movie explores some interesting intellectual, conceptual ideas
about media brainwashing and how gullible we are as people. Did man
truly walk on the moon, did everything about the Gulf War happen as we
saw it on TV, or was it all just some contrived propaganda put there by
some government funded movie studio? Probably not, but there may come a
day when Big Brother will have the power to do so.

Title
Review for Beverly Hills Ninja (1997)
Cast: Chris Farley, Robin Shou, Nicollette Sheridan, Chris Rock, Soon
Tek-Oh, Nathaniel Parker Director: Dennis Dugan Producers: Brad Krevoy,
Steve Stabler, Bran Jenkel Screenplay: Mark Feldberg & Mitch Klebanoff
Fat is not necessarily funny, and this movie carries ill proportions of
both. Chris Farley, a relative unknown quantity in films, carries the
weight of his medium like a naive virgin. He is "The Great White Hope",
the fulfilment of an ancient prophecy - a white child will be found
adrift the shores of Japan, and he will become the greatest ninja of his
generation. Myth becomes farce, as babe becomes man. This is perhaps
where the prophecy should end, before the "Great White Ninja" makes a
"Big Fat Fool" of himself.
Wherever Farley treads, disaster follows. Almost every scene is awash
with disaster being caused by Farley, or being heaped on Farley. There's
something sickly and amusing about watching this accident-prone babe in
arms look ridiculously clumsy on screen. His earnest and sincere
actions, make his attempts at humour grow along the accidental sort.
Sabotage and stealth are his tools, and chaos is both a friend and foe.
Unfortunately, the end result of this single dimensional joke is
watching Humpty Dumpty fall down, over and over again. Although certain
scenes are idiosyncratically hilarious, it becomes difficult to sustain
an entire movie on such lean humour. Not everybody will appreciate this
comedy of excessive clumsiness when lame only becomes lamer. "The Great
White Ninja" will not win the hearts of an audience, by simply twirling
a couple of num-chukas about and hoping it will somehow crack a skull or
two.

Review for Hunchback of Notre Dame, The (1996)
Featuring the voices of Tom Hulce, Tony Jay, Demi Moore, Kevin Kline,
Paul Kendall, Jason Alexander, Charles Kimbrough, Mary Wickes, David
Ogden Stiers Directors: Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise Story for the
Screen by Tab Murphy, freely adapted from the novel by Victor Hugo
Music: Alan Menken Lyrics: Stephen Schwartz
Friendships develop from common interests and similar situations. So it
is not surprising when a beautiful gypsy girl, who is considered an
outcast, befriends an ugly, hunchback, who is alienated from human kind.
What is considered by fellow critics as a dark, Disney venture, is in
fact the most true to life cartoon epic to date. 'Alladin' was fun,
'Beauty and the Beast' was romantic, but unrealistic, 'The Lion King'
was about good and bad animals, and 'Pocahontas' well, that  little
Indian Princess was a little too much for me. In 'Hunchback' there's no
beast that transforms into a prince at the end, and the 'hero' does not
end up happily ever after. The road he walks can only be filled with
life's difficult hurdles created by the misfortune of his deformity.
This is a tale of living with ridicule, triumphing over self-doubt and
understanding self-worth, where sacrifice over selfishness is the
ultimate gift. Like most of us, the Hunchback ends up alone without the
'pretty girl'. His only reward for his good deed, being a better
understanding of himself, and a steadfast belief of what he is capable
of.
Comment: What next? The Elephant Man?

Review for Baby-Sitters Club, The (1995)
Cast: Schuyler Fisk, Rachael Leigh Cook, Larisa Oleynik, Bre Blair,
Tricia Joe, Ellen Burstyn, Brooke Adams, Peter Horton Director: Melanie
Mayron Producers: Jane Startz and Peter O. Almond Screenplay: Dalene
Young based on the books by Ann M. Martin
This movie started out with the same magical feel of childhood, carrying
all of the wondrous hopes and dreams of the future. Then it suddenly
plummeted into the tedious depths of teenage melodrama, which carries
with it the same offensive smell of puked chocolate milkshakes.
So let's describe the gang of BSC's which is feministically female.
Kristy the perky leader, is smart and lies to her mother and friends
because of some forlorn promise she made to her weak father, SIGH. Mary
Anne is Kristy's best friend, she has made a solemn vow not to tell the
other's about the secret of Kristy's father, BOO HOO. So everybody
starts to hate these two for keeping secrets, TUT TUT. The others are
namely the shop-a-hollic, "I'm for NY" Stacey (13) pretending to be (16)
so she can impress the "I'm so cute" Lucas (17), THROW UP. Then there's
Claudia "the artiste", who can make ornaments from forks, but can't pass
science class. If she fails she has to drop out of the BSC, SOB. The
other three members, whose names I can't remember, are all pretty
inconsequential like most of this movie.
I'm truly saddened at what children read nowadays. What utter BALOO! I
guess it could have been worse, but this movie comes close. Where's the
BBC (Beat-the-girls Boys Club), they would have made the game of
baby-sitting much more interesting.
Comment: No sympathy points for this group of annoying adolescents.

Title
Review for What Dreams May Come (1998)
Cast: Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding Jr., Annabella Sciorra, Max Von
Sydow, Jessica Brooks Grant, Josh Paddock.
Screenplay: Ron Bass, based on the novel by Richard Matheson. Producers:
Stephen Simon and Barnet Bain.
Director: Vincent Ward.
In a literally picturesque view of the afterlife, we are faced with
prospects of living out the rest of eternity in a universe carrying our
most fond and cherished memories of the living  that's providing you
didn't commit suicide  suicides, end up in hell. This movie suggests
these premises, and you can also choose to be reborn if so wished. All
rather wishful thinking, but who knows?
This sets the scene for one man after death, in search of his family and
wife. It is the search of one man in heaven, journeying into another
woman's hell. Whether you believe true love can rescue another soul from
eternal damnation, is up for debate, but it's the struggle and
determination of a man in love, which is of import. Will he succeed, or
will he be forever damned with her?
The cinematography is undoubtedly one of the ingenious pieces of art
that has been splashed onto screen. Much of this movie throbs with the
life of a living painting. It will push the viewer's imagination to new
dimensions, adding colour to the mundanity of movie re-making. This
alone is one good reason for watching this movie - it is fresh and
original. However, for those who have strong convictions about the after
life, this movie may disturb your sensibilities, with its mixture of New
Age thinking and eastern philosophies.
Robin Williams, is sensitive as the role of the man in search of his
wife after death, but because of the nature of the work, hardly gets to
crack a joke side ways. I'm not entirely convinced that Annabella
Sciorra was ideal person for the role of the lost wife, but it really
doesn't matter when it comes down to life and death.

Review for Full Circle (1996) (TV)
Directed by Bethany Rooney Cast Corbin Bernsen, Reed Diamond, Eric
Lutes, Teri Polo, Erika Slezak Written by Karol Ann Hoeffner, Pamela
Long, Danielle Steel (novel)
I was flipping channels, whilst having a snack and  well .I came
across "Full Circle".
There's no point discussing acting or make, because we all know that
this movie was not made for Oscar contention. What interested me was the
plot? What makes people buy Danielle Steel's books?
It's about a girl who was raped by her mother's lover's son. The event
is hushed up because the mother, does not want to lose her lover boy.
The girl grows up to be a successful attorney, whose best friend, a guy,
becomes crippled in a car accident. She falls in love with the father of
her best friend, but rejects his advances because her best friend is in
love with her. She rejects a marriage proposal from her best friend, so
he marries somebody else.
So you think at this point the way is left open for her to marry the
father, but not so.
Instead she falls in love with a colleague who is married, but separated
from his wife. The colleague promises to file for divorce so that he can
marry her, but remains undecided about finalising it. Then comes the
cheesiest line in the whole movie. When he tells her I can't decide, I
love you both.'
Anyway, she leaves him. The boy friend dies of renal failure, and the
father marries someone else. So, that's why it's called "Full Circle" -
she starts alone and ends up alone- hooray! But not so. She has to spoil
the movie by marrying a high court judge and having a kid; and the real
reason why the movie is called "First Circle" is something to do with
love, and forgiveness  all which escapes me?

Title
Review for Dust Off the Wings (1997)
If you're wandering what the title of this movie means, it has something
to do with the mating habits of moths, and the dust that falls off their
wings which act as pheromones. Now who would have chosen such an unusual
title for a movie about drugs, sex, surfing, marriage and infidelity? It
would have to be ex-junky, now happily married, still surfing,
Australian director Lee Rogers. The material on which the movie is based
hangs loosely on the type of lifestyle he lived as a Bondi Beach surfer.
Now married to Australian singer Kate Cebrano, who is also in the movie,
he closes a chapter on the youthful wild days of his life.
In this movie "fuck" is a word more commonly found in a sentence than
"and" or "the". He creates images of carefree surfers who do the average
crazy things to get a thrill outside riding waves. There's a bit of coke
snorting in the toilets, the occasional joint being smoked. Some casual
sex whilst high, and a blow job on the side. It's no wonder Rogers has
decided to get married and settle down. Such excessive roller coaster
riding couldn't be too good for anybody's physical or mental health.
So Roger's story circles about his getting married and the problems that
arise from within his world of confusion. He finds out that his fiancee
has been seduced by another surfer whilst on drugs. Can he forgive her
and go through with the wedding? He finds it hard to accept what has
happened, despite being the one to get a blow job the night before the
wedding. Whether the marriage will last isn't the issue here. Rogers
just wants to make a point about how difficult it is to stay faithful to
one person, when everybody around him is doing a lot of f-king and
jerking off.
Some salient points are made when Rogers and his best friend Ward
Steven's discuss how many women they have slept with in their short
lives. It doesn't surprise them that they have lost count, but the
figure hovers somewhere in the triple digits. An interesting comparison
is also made between a "Buck's Night" and a "Hen's Party". One party
settles for an enormously obese stripper, whilst the other chooses a Don
Juan impersonator. The film has a feel and look of a documentary, with
amateurish angles and views to serve the style of movie.
This isn't a story about morals, but it does have a lot to say about
choice of lifestyle. So after watching a lot of men my age chasing cheap
thrills and meaningless relationships, made me feel relieved that I had
chosen a life more ordinary.

Title
Review for Air Force One (1997)
Cast: Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Liesel
Matthews, Paul Guilfoyle, Xander Berkeley, William H. Macy, Dean
Stockwell, Jurgen Prochnow Directors: Wolfgang Petersen Screenplay:
Andrew W. Marlowe
When a 50 year old man dances about an aeroplane dispatching terrorists
half his age, I begin to understand the terms "Gung Ho" or "Big balls
with small jocks". This man is a "Congressional Medal of Honour" winner,
he served in NAM and is also a devoted husband and loving father. He is
a man who has impeccable character and would without hesitation place
his family and Nation above himself. He is the President of the Untied
States.
Wait a minute. Am I missing something here? We are talking about the
President of the Untied States. You mean people like Clinton, Reagan,
Bush and maybe Gore? Or have we somehow confused them with Hollywood
action heroes like Segal, Van Damme, or Harrison Ford per se. Then
again what we want to believe and what we actually have is two different
things, and believe me the President of the United States is no action
hero.
If anything this movies serves to give the American People a good reason
to pat themselves on the back. It seems condescending when they dish out
freebie favours for a struggling Russian government made to look weak
and pathetic in the movie. What gives them the right to take the burden
of protecting the free world upon their own shoulders?  What's happened
to the United Nations? This is two hours worth of solid American
patriotic propaganda. When the Vice President is a female and the
President is an action hero we delude ourselves into believing the world
is almost perfect. The day that I actually see an American President
actually follow through with the claim that he well put world justice
and peace above his own political agenda, will also be the day I apply for
citizenship.
However unbelievable this movie maybe, it did make me hyperventilate
with laughter, and I laughed harder than most in the cinema. So if one
can put aside their disbelief that this is actually an Amercian
President come fighting machine, the action will keep you entertained
for the duration of the flight and fight. Harrison Ford is getting
older, and it is becoming more difficult to see him kill men half his
age and twice his size in hand to hand combat. Gary Oldman has that
something Russian worked out to the fine details of facial tics, stares
and hand gestures. It is unlikely that Air Force One will ever be
hi-jacked, but should the scenario occur it should be interesting to
follow the outcome. That way we can look back and see how wrong this
movie actually is.

Title
Review for FairyTale: A True Story (1997)
Cast: Florence Hoath, Elizabeth Earl, Paul McGann, Phoebe Nicholls,
Peter O'Toole, Harvey Keitel Director: Charles Sturridge Producers:
Wendy Finerman, Bruce Davey Screenplay: Ernie Contreras
If someone told me there were pixies picking daisies on my front lawn
and sprites were salting salami in my back garden, I would smile and ask
them whether the wicked witch of the west was cleaning my roof as
ordered. What the heck, I'm in need of some recreational fantasy and if
sprites and pixies want to do my gardening and cooking, then by all
means let them.
In this magical tale of tiny people with wings, two little girls have
claims to fairies frolicking in their neck of the woods. If you don't
believe them, they can always whip out their Kodak shots of the
momentous occasion. This is a true story in the sense that these events
too place in the early twentieth century, and does not is any way imply
that fairies are true. In the grand scheme of things we have two
prominent historical figures like Houdidi (Harvey Keitel) and Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole), involved and scrutinising the photos of the
fairies. In may ways their presence makes this tale more real to life,
as it shows us that lots of people were interested with the photos at
the time, and more importantly - this is not just some washed up tale
from an outhouse.
With the miracle of special effects, the fairies in question are brought
to life more magically on screen than perhaps in life. However, their
screen presence is sadly limited to the occasional midnight flickering
appearance in the garden. This is unfortunate because the fairies are
this movies highlight and I felt the audience wanted to see more fairies
in action and less humans bumbling about. Harvey Keitel makes an
interesting interpretation of Houdini and O'Toole is very suitable in
the role of Conan Doyle. There is also a special cameo appearance of a
fellow Australian towards the end of the movie.
So the question on everybody's mind is whether or not to believe the two
girls? My response is - does it really matter? The fairies aren't here
to invade the world, cause mass genocide or to destroy it with pollution
and nuclear weapons. So let the girls believe in fairies if they want to
and if you had a little imagination in your life, perhaps you should
too.

Title
Review for American Werewolf in Paris, An (1997)
What started out as promising, spoofy fun took a turn for the worse when
the werewolf started getting nasty. You can't keep laughing when there's
an arm hanging here, a leg hanging there and a bit of blood splattered
everywhere. So what was I expecting? I wanted a tale as tragically
romantic as BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, as touching as BORN FREE and as
carefree as HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Too much to ask you might say, but
a subject as overdone as werewolves deserves only the utmost attention.
I was disappointed, not so much because it wasn't original, but because
it didn't carry any heart except within the jaws of the beast.
So I grimaced as I witnessed this blood bath reminiscent of hyenas
ripping apart prey on the Savannah. These mythological men who turn to
beasts at full moon, awaken to feast on the hearts of humans was too
difficult to swallow, even with popcorn and coke on hand. Remember the
Christians being fed to Lions in the Colosseum, well this time round
it's the Americans who get fed to werewolves at numerous night clubs.
Somehow, the French werewolves prefer American blood. This may be pure
coincidence, a subtle hint that Americans aren't welcome in Paris or
more likely that the over-friendly Americans make the easiest prey for
partying wolves. Anyway it was quite amusing to see werewolves
massacring Americans in Paris. It's not a sight you'll find at the zoo.
The cast includes Julie Delpy who talked too much with Ethan Hawke in
BEFORE SUNRISE. In this movie she says less but carries a lot more bite.
She is otherwise charming when she tries to calm the hallucinating Tom
Everett Scott (THAT THING YOU DO) post wolf bite. Her idea of helping
him through the difficult transition from man to wolf is to keep his
hands on her breasts. I've heard that this particular naturipathic
treatment is also effective for insomnia, anxiety and good for
rebuilding finger strength. Unfortunately, this is as enchanting as the
movie gets. Gone are the days when only a silver bullet will kill a
werewolf, now any bullet will do the job. Three cheers for modern
technology, but an overall unhappy movie experience.

Title
Review for Brassed Off (1996)
Cast: Pete Postlethwaite, Tara Fitzgerald, Ewan McGregor, Stephen
Thompkinson, Jim Carter. Screenplay: Mark Herman. Producer: Steve
Abbott. Director: Mark Herman.
When swamped by the sorrows of life, when day becomes night, and the
will to survive sinks with the burden of each breath, some of us will
sing, some of us will cry and some will blow their flugel'. It's during
these times of turbid turmoil, when the power of music can for a brief
moment, lift us above the troubled waters which is bitter with despair.
This is the story of music and the struggle of the ordinary working man
to keep his job, support his family, and keep the passion for music
alive. In a small Yorkshire community the coal miners work by day and
play the music of brass' by night. A shift of fortunes brings our
mining musicians to face the threat of mine closure, the end of their
livelihood and the dilemma of how can we play music when there is no
food on the table.'
The director Mark Herman has nicely blended the music of brass' with
the struggle of the human spirit. Sit and listen, and the two become
one, as the miner's plight is as much felt in the music they play as
seen on screen. When the corporate powers of the world attempts to bind
the fight of these men, we have the transformation of emotions into
music, which is the blend of brass' and sorrow, and the creation of one
of the most powerfully moving yet lamented sweetness that is heard.
The ending may not be as triumphant as one would have hoped for, but for
a brief moment these few men soared the high places' where most of us
only dream. Strong performances by Pete Postlethwaite as the Brass band
conductor dying of Coal Miner's Lung', and good supports from Tara
Fitzgerald and Ewan McGregor.
Comment: On the seventh day the trumpets sounded and the Walls of
Jericho fell.

Title
Review for For Richer or Poorer (1997)
Cast: Tim Allen, Kirstie Alley, Jay O. Sanders, Megan Cavanaugh, Wayne
Knight, Michael Lerner, Larry Miller
Director: Bryan Spicer
Producers: Bill, Jonathan, and Sid Sheinberg Screenplay: Jana Howington
and Steve LuKanic
In this big mistake and excuse for a Tim Allen film, one can see him
silently tearing his inside out trying to be funny on screen. Any
comedian will tell you that trying to be funny means doesn't actually
mean trying to be funny. What made Tim Allen a success in HOME
IMPROVEMENT, was the fact that he played the regular husband, father and
tool man with a comic ease that came naturally. In the surroundings of
wife to banter with, boys to play with, best friend to tease and
neighbour to listen to, Tim Allen presents his best work. Take him out
of this environment and Allen falters poorly. He made an atrocious SANTA
CLAUSE, a terrible businessman/father in JUNGLE TO JUNGLE, and is no
better as a real estate developer FOR RICHER OR POORER. Maybe his claim
to fame, will also be his bane as he will forever be compared to and
labelled the TOOL MAN.
The story surrounds Brad and Caroline Sexton (Tim Allen and Kirsty
Alley), successful real estate developers. Beneath the exterior of
wealth and glamour, their perfect marriage is actually in shambles. To
make matters worse, their accountant has embezzled 5 million dollars,
leaving them to take the fall for the crime. With the RSI hot on their
heels, the Sextons are forced to take shelter in an Amish community. It
is here that they find love again.
It is here that Allen and Alley try to generate laughs by adopting Amish
customs and habits. Unfortunately, there is nothing much to laugh about.
Allen is mostly in the fields ploughing, whilst Alley learns to cook,
scrub floors and sew. Like regular farmers. Kirsty Alley is as usual
playing a whiney, naggy, difficult woman and Allen tries too hard to be
who he isn't  a tool man trying to be farmer. However, there is one
scene where Alley puts on an Amish floorshow that is quite entertaining.
Otherwise, the intended romance and chemistry between Allen and Alley
doesn't exist, and the ending comes as abruptly as saying Amen' in the
middle of supper.
So the vows go, For richer or poorer, for better or worse, in sickness
and in health, till death do us part.' So how can I sum up this movie?
Simply  'For poorer, for worse, in sickness and death'.

Title
Review for Fire Down Below (1997)
Cast: Steven Seagal, Marg Helgenberger, Harry Dean Stanton, Kris
Kristofferson, Stephen Lang, Levon Helm, Brad Hunt Director: Felix
Enriquez Alcala Screenplay: Jeb Stuart and Philip Morton
There is something pristine about Segal and his action heroes who remain
virtually invincible in harms way. He will occasionally be cut or
stabbed, but you'll never see too much blood on that well chiselled face
and solid torso. For some reason blood, dirt, sweat and bruises don't
hang well on Segal. Punishing injury is for the die hard Willis,
physical damage follows the kick boxing Van Damme, and multiple gun shot
wounds riddle after the robotic Swharzenegger. As for Segal it's not his
style to let the enemy throw too many close punches, let alone get his
expensive clothes dirty. For that reason, I like Segal because he has
redefined the meaning of a clean fight.
Unfortunately, there isn't anything unique about "Fire Down Below" that
hasn't already traversed down the road of previous Segal action
thrillers. He's a special agent once again, with a slick appearance and
familiar pony tail; well dressed and diet controlled since his last
siting with pot belly in the embarrassing "The Glimmer Man". Once again
the hero he creates is perfectly balanced, poetically just and an
effortless killer who defeats up to twenty men with guns in any given
situation. I have no qualms with this particular style of polished
action and safety margin thrills. The real let down for me was how very
ordinary this movie turned out.
I do not carry a keen love of pure special effects in movies, but in an
action flick, especially in a Segal action flick I would like to see
more than a couple of bins explode and objects burn. I would also like
to see Segal wearing something outside his usual dark overcoat and
leather jackets; especially in a small country town where he is supposed
to blend with the natives in order to carry out an investigation. Come
on Steven, how about some jeans, a pleat shirt and a cowboy hat? Too
risque or just trying to hide weight? You need to dress the part if you
want us to believe you have some carpentry skills. Just swinging the
hammer in clothing suitable for a "Planet Hollywood" presentation
doesn't quite cut the cheese.
On the unusual side of things, Segal has decided to include a love
interest for his hero notably absent in his most recent movies. He has
strangely chosen a frail, weedy looking creature (Marg Helgenberger) to
be the main contender. There is no question that Segal remains the
perfect gentleman in his movies and women naturally fall for that sort
of a thing. But it becomes hard to swallow when he comes across as a
Russian Mafia thug, whilst his love interest is mostly clothed in rags
and lives like a hermit. The only thing they have in common is her porch
needs fixing, he likes her cooking and they both collect honey. Maybe
that's enough for some relationships to work, but there certainly isn't
any chemistry under the stove.
So overall I was disappointed by this latest of Segal offerings. I guess
in my heart, I still carry that simple wish that he'll get back into
whites and rescue another battle cruiser from the claws of terrorists.
Somehow rescuing country bumpkins from the jaws of polluting
industrialists doesn't carry the same missed heartbeat of thrill and
ride.

Title
Review for Postman, The (1997)
I don't understand Kevin Costner's fetish for legendary, bigger than
life heroes. We look at his work DANCES WITH WOLVES where ordinary
soldier becomes legendary Indian liaison officer. In PRINCE OF THIEVES
he is a legendary social worker. In WYATT EARP, a legendary police
officer and WATERWORLD is no exception with a legendary mutant. So it's
not surprising that a picture titled THE POSTMAN starring Kevin Costner,
will be about a legendary postman. Sorry Kevin, but I'm getting tired of
all this legendary stuff. I just like my mail delivered without much ado
legendary fuss.
Costner who directs this movie, has tried to recreate an epic as big as
the American Civil War in the future. He fails miserably especially when
he tries to draw on that all American patriotic spirit, by burning a
couple of US flags and getting one of his kids to sing the national
anthem. This doesn't draw much of an emotional response, especially if
you're foreign and carry little American sentiment. Still it is
difficult to believe that in the year 2012, 14 years from now, one will
be faced with a post-apocalyptic way of life. Chaos runs amuck. The
survivors of this 3rd WW holocaust now live in small towns isolated from
each other. Evil shows itself in the form of a Hitler like General with
an organised army of mercenaries. A man rises against the General's
totalitarian rule, the legendary POSTMAN.
The problem seems to arise from overcrowding the story with too many
events. This results in a patchy story line with garish errors. An
example is what I call the re-instillation of the ten commandments
scene. Rule number 1: No more killing', the postman yells aloud, and
this is followed by Rule number 8: Live and Let live'. Hello, but isn't
rule number 1 the same as rule number 8 and what about rules 2 to 7? The
middle of the movie is filled with the recreation of The Pony Express',
before a North meets South ending where the geriatric/adolescent army
confronts the mercenaries. There is no great finale, just a fist fight
showing who is the better man. If I wanted a history lesson I could have
gone to the public library, and if this is the way that legends are
made, I'd rather not.
My final comments are severe. THE POSTMAN is unoriginal, poorly written
and unimaginative. An over all waste of precious time and money.

Title
Review for Fathers' Day (1997)
Cast: Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Charlie Hofheimer, Bruce Greenwood,
Nastassja Kinski, Julia Louis-Dreyfus Director: Ivan Reitman Screenplay:
Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, based on the film LES COMPERES by
Francis Veber
I like presents. There is nothing quite like the feel of wrapping paper
ripping beneath your finger tips, and hearing the edges tear at the same
time. So I was pleasantly surprised by this particular 'Father's Day'
offering. Expecting to find some recycled, thoughtless gift beneath the
pretence of some pretty wrapping paper with the names 'Williams and
Crystal together for the first time' written all over it; instead I
found a decent, amusing, thoughtful pairing.
In this package of unusual goods, we have contained 'three fathers with
a teenage baby', and in the card a single question from the mother
(Natasha Kinski). Who is this baby's father?
Our options are the manic depressive, effervescent one minute, tearful
the next, failed playwright (Williams). Who is compassionate, but lacks
any direction in life. Then there is the smart talking, head butting,
sensible, no nonsense lawyer (Crystal). Who wants to have kids, but has
great reservations because of the heavy responsibility of child bearing.
Lastly, we have the usual regular, round the mill, responsible 'I can't
understand my son', 'how do I break through to him', 'struggling to
reach out' father (Greenwood). Who wants the best for his son, but
doesn't quite know how to express his feelings of love for his son.
Now if I had a choice, I would probably choose the best qualities of all
three fathers - fun but not frivolous, sensible but not stern, reliable
but not restrictive. In truth it takes all three of these very different
fathers to reach out to this very confused, lost prodigal son, who has
been waylaid by the wayward temptations of this world. Namely, drugs,
alcohol and untrue friends. This movie brings a positive message to all
fathers who have difficult teenage children, the reminder given is never
give up on them no matter how lost they have become.
Ivan Reitman has done a good job in controlling the talents that are
Williams and Crystal. My greatest preconceived fear before watching this
movie, was that these comic talents would be trying to out funny, or out
perform the other; but instead I have found a good rapport and mutual
respect develop between these two actors, who have fairly distributed
the humour between them. Was there electrifying chemistry? Probably not,
but friendship, self control, and a good understanding of timing under
the umbrella of sensitive direction is all that is required to make this
movie work.

Title
Review for Black Rose, The (1950)
Back in the days before Lolita', there was a movie called The Black
Rose' which carried a questionable G rating. The hero, Walter of Gurnie
(Tyrone Power), is the illegitimate child of a Saxon Lord who is denied
his inheritance and birthright. In an effort to find his fortune, he
journeys to the middle-east and joins Kublai Khan's army which is about
to invade China.
It is here that the film's controversy arises. The Black Rose' Maryam,
is a prepubescent teenager (at least 13 years of age, but played by an
actress who was 18 but looks 13), daughter of a white man who is on her
way as a gift to Kublai. She is rescued by Tyrone Power and Co. whilst
trying to escape the life of a concubine in the harem of the Mongul
King. Like most stories go, she falls in love with the hero and an
interesting chauvinistic relationship follows. The man treats the girl
like a servant and she seems to enjoy it  I wander whether this is
reflective of the era?
The final scene is a passionate kiss between the thirty something Tyrone
Powers and the 13 year old looking Cecile Aubry. No quite Lolita', but
comes a close second.

Review for Firestorm (1998)
After the likes of VOLCANO, TWISTER and HARD RAIN now comes the likes of
FIRESTORM. Thus completing the quartet of Elements i.e. Earth, Air,
Water and now Fire. Hollywood does not fail to surprise me time and
again with its ability to churn out disaster movies at such an alarming
rate. Using the smallness of man and pitting him against the greatness
of nature, to create a feeling of overwhelming awe as we get blown away
by the special effects.
This time the hero is a fireman (Howie Long). The aim is to make him
bigger than life and Howie sure has the size even if he doesn't have the
screen presence. He's probably the regular kind of guy that women like
to see sweaty with torn clothing, working at a construction site
quenching his thirst with a large can of coke, but then again I could be
wrong and he may have originated from a Chippendale troupe. Anyway,
Howie does well throwing axes, wrestling with men as huge as himself,
saving the girl and beating the smart, but ugly bad guy all in a single
day. How many firemen can claim they have done that?
I ask myself should I be amazed by the special effects, me being a
person who doesn't like playing with fire, who keeps a safe distance
from the stove. I guess I should have been, especially towards the end
when a sea of fire sweeps over everything, ripping forests and people's
heads apart but somehow I wasn't enthralled by the spectacle. Maybe it's
because one needs to feel a FIRESTORM in order to fully appreciate it,
but getting that close usually means you die, so I'll retract my
statement. The movie's saving grace was that it lived up to it's claims,
instead of just lighting a couple of trees and calling that a FIRESTORM.
Despite not being an overly innovative movie, it is still pretty
innocent, brainless fun for big beefy men - something which fans of big,
beefy action would most likely appreciate.

Title
Review for Swingers (1996)
In this tale about human mating rituals, we have the scenario of a down
and out comedian in L.A. who has recently been dumped by his long time
lover and is wallowing with depression. His juvenile friends, despite
being childish and irresponsible attempt to cheer him up by getting him
up and out to mingle with society. This is a good idea, but becomes
annoying when they give him mostly wrong advice. Advice like you can't
call someone out for a date until 2 days post first meeting. Leaving it
for several weeks is a better option. Or you need to look cool, be
slightly arrogant and throw money about for people to notice you.
Yes, people will start noticing you, all the wrong sorts. For this
lonely, otherwise pleasant young man he seems to be searching for the
right woman in all the wrong places i.e. bars, night clubs etc. Places
conducive for sex, drugs and alcohol but not ideal for a generating a
more lasting union. So night after night he searches for true love,
toddling behind his high swinging' friends whose main intent is to get
laid, whilst he is searching for a more meaningful relationship. My
advice to him is to look for love elsewhere. He stands a better chance
of finding a prospective partner who hasn't slept with all his friends
and a hundred different people let's say at a church picnic. The crowd
that haunts the night scene is also a festering pool of crime, suicide
and sexually transmitted diseases waiting to happen. When one gets older
this lifestyle loses its charm because it is based on youth, good looks
and vitality. When these virtues disappear it becomes evident how
rootless' this way of life truly is.
This movie makes a good study about the evolving rituals of courting in
late 20th century males. Where the subject matter, a man in his twenties
unexpectedly finds love in a bar. He takes a chance by not following the
usual conventions described to him by his friends. It also makes a good
study on resisting peer group pressure and making your own stance and
decisions in life. I was very proud of him when he actually decided not
to force himself on the girl after their first meeting, and remained a
gentleman throughout the encounter. This is a movie I started out hating
because of all the misconceived notions it suggests about courting, but
ended up liking because it declared how wrong these notions were.

Title
Review for Chasers (1994)
Directed by Dennis Hopper, Written by Jon Batteer, John Rice and Dan
Gilroy Cast Tom Berenger William McNamara, Erika Eleniak, Crispin
Glover, Dean Stockwell, Gary Busey, Seymour Cassell, Federic Forrest,
Marilu Henner, Dennis Hopper
This movie is a poor excuse for a comedy. There is no plot and plenty of
running about with nothing better to do (I guess that's why they called
it CHASERS because there is no other relation to the plot that I can
see.)
The story revolves around two navy officers (Berenger and McNamara) who
are assigned to transport a beautiful, young female navy officer
(Eleniak) to her court martial. She tries to escape numerous times; they
fall in a pit where they all have to strip in order to escape; the
younger officer (McNamara) sleeps with his prisoner (totally unethical),
then falls in love with her and, the Captain (Berenger) takes pity on
them and helps them to escape to Mexico.
All this in the name of comedy? What utter rubbish!
At least my video recorder had a good work out with my constant
thumb-pressing on the fast forward button of my remote control.

Title
Review for Liar Liar (1997)
I believe the problem lies in the fact that his overacting has a
tendency to kill any good elements of plot or dialogue in his films.
More often than not Jim Carrey tends to overwhelm everyone and
everything in his films so much so that it becomes suffocating to watch.
However, I am relieved to say that 'Liar Liar' has somehow survived the
loud, colourful, overdone antics of Carrey. The story brings out simple
but important issues about life like keeping your promises, loving your
children and of course being honest. These are the things which are most
admirable about the movie, beside the fact that it is also very
entertaining.
This is Carrey's best work since 'The Mask'. Sometimes I just wish he
would tone down a little, but I guess 'that thing he does' is what makes
people love him as much as hate him.
This is a must for high powered executive fathers who have little time
to spend with their kids. Don't make the same mistake or your children
may just end up making a wish worse than not being able to lie for an
entire day.

Title
Review for Little Princess, A (1995)
Cast: Liesel Matthews, Eleanor Bron, Liam Cunningham, Vanessa Lee
Chester, Errol Sitahal Director: Alfonso Cuaron Screenplay: Richard
LaGravanese and Elizabeth Chandler based on the novel SARA CREWE by
Frances Hodgson Burnett
Strip away the pink petty coats, frills and white lace and you're left
with a pair of shiny silk stockings. Like these stockings, this movie
shines a star or two above the mundane nylon/cotton crap giving the
general public an outbreak of jock itch, and other fungal infections. "A
Little Princess" is like a gem hidden beneath layers of sugar and spice,
and everything nice. Just don't choke on the rock when you guzzle down
the desert.
I was enchanted by the sweet experience of growing up in a fairy tale
world, where the niceties of living include having an adorable father
who adores you even more. This is the story of a child who goes from
riches to rags, with a life and death experience thrown in somewhere
between. Despite being maltreated and traumatised, this orphan keeps her
dignity and compassion throughout the ordeal. She holds firm to her
belief that every child is "A Little Princess" - meaning that all
children are special, despite their circumstance. This message holds
true with every child, but can the same be said in ten years time when
they grow into bratty, selfish teenagers? Or in thirty years time when
they develop power hungry tendencies? By sixty they should all have some
form of coronary heart disease.
I was impressed by the brazen colours, the bold images and insightful
themes. The most potent point in the movie is when the orphan girl
confronts her tormentor, the spinster head mistress, with a powerful
statement - "Didn't your father ever tell you that you were a princess?"
The Mistress's face grows cold, her eyes narrow and she storms out of
the room in a fit of rage - evidently not. All children are like royalty
when they enter the world, but depending on how they live their life,
the same cannot be said about them when they make a hasty exit.
This is an exceptional true to life story for children of all ages. Well
recommended and much enjoyed.

Title
Review for Fluke (1995)
Directed by Carlo Carlei. Cast Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew Modine, Nancy
Travis, Eric Stoltz, Max Pomeranc, Ron Perlman Written by Carlo Carlei,
James Carrington, James Herbert (novel).
When a puppy starts having visions of being a late husband, a departed
father and an ex-corporate manager, I begin to worry. Puppies have
enough problems of their own, without having to deal with the emotional
wranglings of an unbalanced past life. This movie is pure reincarnation
propaganda. One descends the chain of evolution if bad, and ascends if
not so bad. So we can assume from this precept that this homeless pup,
was once a bad little boy now become canine.
Matthew Modine, devoted husband, loving father and troubled business man
dies in a motor vehicle accident. He is now "Fluke", a mongrel dog who
remembers his past. He finds his family again (Nancy Travis and Max
Pomeranc) and worms his way back into their hearts; spending the time he
never had with his son, and staring longingly at his widowed wife in the
bathroom. When his best friend and ex-business partner (Eric Stoltz)
threatens to take away his family, he bites him. This is before he
realises that he is to blame for his own death, and comes to a decision
that he must leave his past as a man behind, if he is too have any
fulfillment as a dog.
If all this dog logic and philosophy is starting to get on your nerves -
you don't stand alone. Reincarnation stories have been done to death,
and this play for "Ghost" sympathisers is no exception. I say let this
dead man rest peacefully in his grave, and don't humiliate him by
bringing him back as a dog.
The final scene is that of crippled "Fluke" (another car accident),
hobbling through fields of wheat in eager anticipation of adventures
that await him. My advice for this stray, accident prone dog is to learn
to observe oncoming traffic, or next time being a goldfish would not be
too severe a fate.
So if it makes you feel any better, that your pet canine, feline or fish
is perhaps your beloved husband, child or cranky old Aunt; then by all
means let this movie guide you through the cathartic unpheaval of grief
and bereavment. However, don't let your sanity or better judgement, be
clouded by unrealistic expectations, that these animals are perhaps the
embodiment of your once great love. The disappointment that follows can
only be earth shattering.
There's nothing "Flukey" about dying and ending up as a mongrel dog, if
anything, like much of this movie, it's sheer bad luck.

Title
Review for Starship Troopers (1997)
Disappointment will adequately describe how I felt as I left the cinema
after watching this greatly anticipated film. This movie carried much
potential for greatness, but alas was ruined by a moronic, cliché'
script and a lack of serious direction from Paul Verhoeven. The end
result is not a tense sci-fi, action thriller, but becomes a boy
scout/girl guide venture into trying to define the difference between a
citizen and a civilian. If this was intentional, it subtracts from the
otherwise splendid visual effects of unprecedented alien quality. I've
never read the Robert Heinlein novel on which this movie is loosely
based, but I'm almost certain that the threat to the human race was not
in any way meant to be intentionally comic.
This group of immature actors has gone to great lengths in perfecting a
blood-curdling death scream, but unfortunately their efforts are wasted.
The frequent decapitations, limb amputations, torso dissections and
disembodiment is all for naught. My reason for making such comments is
because after watching the 20th person in the long line of innumerable
graphic deaths - desensitisation becomes inevitable. When the 30th human
execution approaches, variety begins to run thin. By this time caring
about what happens to this group of hormonally charged individuals is no
longer an issue. They are after all only post-pubescent,
soldiers-in-diapers who make a lot of noise over everything. They're
purpose is solely to shoot and get shot, but mention the word act and
they'll just nervously finger their guns.
So what we have is something of a CLUELESS in space, pretentious in
every way with no substance underneath. Add a show tune and you may even
get something of a JOSIE AND THE PUSSYCATS. The Ken doll' (Casper Van
Dien) is all brawn and no brains. He joins the dispensable army corps so
that he can impress his Barbie' girlfriend (Denise Richards) who wants
to fly a star ship. Then there is the nerdy ex-Doogie Howser (Neil
Patrick Harris) whose psychic powers allows him to communicate with
brainy bugs. Throw in a forlorn, other female, Dizzy (Dina Meyer) and
this completes the love triangle of cosmic soap opera proportions.
So why haven't I frowned on this movie like I should have? Well because
it's attempts at being serious made me laugh, and even if it wasn't a
dramatic masterpiece, it serves well as a trashy soapie.

Title
Review for Un divan ŕ New York (1996)
Directed by Chantal Akerman
Cast: Juliette Binoche, William Hurt, Stephanie Buttle, Barbara Garrick,
Paul Guilfoyle
Written by Chantal Akerman, Jean-Louis Benoît
Ever felt the need to just pick and leave. To simply forget about your
job and where you live, the daily problems that hound you and the
responsibilities that ground you. So why not post an advertisement in
lets say Paris, Apartment for exchange' for one in New York? No nosey
personal questions, discretion is important, as long as you look after
the place  it's yours for a short holiday.
So when a famous psychoanalyst, Henry Harriston (William Hurt), decides
he needs a change of pace, he swaps his apartment for one in Paris - one
that belongs to free spirited, Beatrice Saulnier (Juliette Binoche).
When he decides to drop by home for a visit, he finds that Beatrice is
counselling all his male patients, with better success than himself. He
is so mesmerised by this mysterious woman with an aura', that he
decides to become one of her patients.
When they fall in love, one asks the question, why? They hardly know
each other. She's pretending to be a psychologist, illegally accepting
money from his patients, whilst he is allowing her to continue with the
sick charade so he can satisfy his twisted curiosity of becoming her
patient. Isn't it obviously wrong to feign illness, just because you
find the doctor fascinating'? Or has it been made acceptable, just
because this is a movie and one can live out their
love-deprived-twisted-Freudian-fantasies on screen?
With this major flaw aside, Juliette Binoche carries with her a glowing,
care-freeness which is refreshing, whilst William Hurt (who speaks
French well) lumbers about like a book worm needing to get laid. The
ending is as empty and awkward as two strangers standing on a balcony,
proclaiming the words I love you', just because that's how the fantasy
is meant to end.

Title
Review for Ice Storm, The (1997)
Starring: Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Christina Ricci, Sigourney Weaver,
Elijah Wood, Adam Hann-Byrd, Toby Maguire. Screenplay: James Schamus,
based on the novel by Rick Moody. Director: Ang Lee.
On Thanksgiving weekend, winter 1973, there's more than just a blizzard
blowing in New Canaan Connecticut. There's a plenty married adults
having extra-marital affairs, a plenty children experimenting with their
bodies and tragedy waiting to erupt from the eye of the storm. If Ang
Lee wanted us to feel the coldness of the changing climate, then he has
succeeded in giving as a good bout of frostbite  everything from the
weather to the décor to the relationships are meticulously frigid and
marvellously frozen.
During the course of the movie the subject of a key chain party is
raised. When my companion asked me what this was I answered, Well I
think it's when they pick a key out of the bowl, and they get to test
drive each others cars.' Boy was I wrong. To think that grownups behaved
so in the decade when I was born made me worry about the conduct of my
own parents. So I went home and I interrogated them and they of course
denied any knowledge of such tomfoolery. But one wonders?
This movie is also about the childhood discovery of sex. Everybody finds
out sometime, some younger, some older and some not all. Knowledge is
obtained through dirty magazines, accidentally walking in on your sister
in the shower and of course first hand. In this movie, Ang Lee decides
to explore the themes by allowing the kids to have a peek at each others
pee pee, with suggestions of touching and tasting, then stripping a toy
soldier to look at it's pee pee also, before just getting plain naked.
It sounds offensive, but with Ang Lee's placid form of directing 
you'll probably just raise an eyebrow.
Needless to say the characters are very much in need of love and not
sex. Using the cold climate to his advantage, Lee shows us what life is
like, why it needs to change and then gives his conclusion. Kevin Kline
is purely dramatic in this movie as the unfaithful husband  a nice
change of pace for him. Joan Allen is every bit the sweet wife she was
in the movie FACE/OFF, and Sigourney Weaver every bit the vamp we
despised in WORKING GIRL  - 70's style of course. However, the praise
for fine acting also belongs to the children. Christina Ricci is as good
a child actress as they come, and in this movie she hones in on her tart
qualities. Elijah Wood seems to be perpetually trapped in roles
requiring wide-eye innocence and perhaps needs to develop a mean streak
or two. Any ways, I hope these two young actors manage an easy
transition from child to adult star without incident, for they are
amongst my favourite.
So if you like stories about complex relationships and in depth
character development, then you have found the movie in THE ICE STORM.
Nobody does movies on character driven situations better than Mr Lee.

Review for Men in Black (1997)
Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino, Rip Torn, Vincent
D'Onofrio, Tony Shalhoub Director: Barry Sonnenfeld Screenplay: Ed
Solomon based on the comic book by Lowell Cunningham
Mr Jones and Mr Smith wear black well,
Tailor made suits and "sunnys" look swell,
Two lone rangers who patrol human space,
Searching for illegal aliens, terminating their unwelcome stay,
I don't mean Mexicans, and I don't mean Cubans,
I do mean alien bugs which leave a sugar spectral trace,
Who wear humans well, and make "Stretch and Wear" look swell,
Poor Vincent D'Onofrio's face.
So the story is decent and somewhat compelling,
Throw in some nifty guns and loud explosions,
A puzzle on Orion's belt and a royal assassination,
Where the answer to earth's salvation rests in "Meow".
The actors are professional but less propelling,
Jones is serious and wry, not boring or dry,
Smith is smart mouthed and cheeky, not obnoxious or sleazy,
But it's the aliens which make this story, by far the most exciting.
So in this cocktail of laughs set on this rocky planet,
We have a mixture of "buggy" action with genuine illegal aliens,
Making the hangover effect of this movie a not too unpleasant experience,
For those willing to pay for the ride.
So don't worry and don't scurry about,
Red Martians, Purple Plutonians or Orange Uranians,
Rest assured, be comforted,
That these "Men in Black", will be back, next summer?
To protect the earth for another large chunk of box office takes.

Title
Review for Simple Plan, A (1998)
Cast:  Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda, Brent Briscoe,
Gary Cole.
Screenplay:  Scott B. Smith, based on his novel.
Producers:  James Jacks and Adam Schroeder.
Director:  Sam Raimi.
This is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and
getting away with the cash. This is more about a parable of greed, and
how money can become the bane of your life. Yes, there are elements of
Fargo' here (the snow and cold), although not as vivid in the blood and
gore department. It shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading
to death and the destruction of lives. And how at the end of the day,
the things that matter most are love, truth and honesty.
Although in one sense it may seem tedious, making a movie about the
ugliness of greed (not box office material), it does become tedious, not
because of the morale ending, but because one expects the movie to end
that way. This becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the
crime, the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there. The
characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk,
brothers and friends, who all fall prey to the avarice of money. They
should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible, level headed and not
affected by greed to give the party more balance.
Commendable is the exceptional performance of Billy Bob Thornton, whose
portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful. Bill Paxton also gives
a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother, whilst Bridget
Fonda is convincing as the greediest wife, who indirectly causes the
most problems. Fill a room full of greedy people and several million
dollars, and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath. It's
not a simple plan, when you shoot everyone you love for money, unless
you're the Menendez brothers.

Title
Review for Rainmaker, The (1997)
So here I am faced with the dilemma of reviewing another John Grisham
movie. I ask myself, shall I be fair or should I trash it? After all
this is number umpteen in a long line of successful Grisham movies, and
the one most likely to be torn apart by critics hungry for blood. Let's
be fair.
This is not by any means the most engrossing court room drama to date,
but it is certainly one of the more amusing attempts to lighten the
heavy weight of legal discourse. Thanks to Danny Devito and his funny
man antics we have achieved the latter to the end. Frances Ford Cappola
seems an unusual choice for directing such an unconventional mixture of
drama and comedy, and remarkably this movie isn't clouded by his usual
heavy directional undertones. When the movie finishes, you'll be
wandering to yourself  My God, Frances Ford Cappola directed this ???'.
For better or worse, Coppola has decided to sway away from using a prime
grade star by choosing a relative unknown such as Matt Damon, to play
the lead. This I personally believe was a mistake. People are always
asking about who the male and female leads of a movie are, and when you
can only provide a . Ummmmh.. in response to their question, you will
likely get an .Ohhhh.. from them, before they brush the movie into
their memory  that's unless you are a die hard Grisham fan. Matt Damon
is every bit good quality for money as the young lawyer who makes a
miracle happen in court, but someone like Ethan Hawke may have been
better material.
There is however a strong cast of supporting actors and actresses. Jon
Voight is delightfully crooked as the powerful lawyer providing defence
for the fraudulent health insurance business. Devito I have already
mentioned, and other well knowns like Danny Glover, Roy Scheider and
Mickey Rourke throw in fine performances. The most unbelievable and
sadly miscast is Clare Danes in the role of a battered wife who also
provides a love interest for the young Matt Damon. Not only are the
bandages hanging off her face in the most pathetic manner, but the
flimsy method of application with a stuck band-aid here and there is
ludicrous. This is sadly the fault of a misinformed make-up artist with
no first aid experience.
Beside this, there is only one point of contention in this movie that I
have to mention. When the battered wife (Danes) asks the young lawyer
(Damon) for the baseball bat and then closes the door behind her before
beating her husband's brains out . sad to say this can no longer be
considered The Battered Wife Syndrome' or Manslaughter'  the correct
term would be intent to kill and cannot be justified by the fact the
abusive husband deserved to die. Once the husband is dead it is implied
that the lawyer and housewife get together. This surprised me
considering that all John Grisham movies carry such an undeniable sense
of right and wrong, but now such leeway is given. Besides this minor
quirk, the audience is drawn into caring about what happens to the
characters, and you will end up with another cathartic experience of
courtroom melodramatics to help soothe your society ill laden
conscience.

Title
Review for L.A. Confidential (1997)
Cast: Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, David
Strathairn, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito Director: Curtis Hanson
Screenplay: Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland based on the novel by
James Ellroy
This movie is about good cops and bad cops, with shades of grey smudging
the fine line in between. Throw in a classy hooker and the dead rat
smells like organised crime.
The good cop (Guy Pearce) follows in the footsteps of his old man and
carries his badge with honour and duty. His father, a highly decorated
dick in the police force was gunned down by a nobody felon who got away
with it. His motivation for joining the force is to catch the ghost of
the murderer who killed his father, and any criminal that thinks he
won't get caught. With more brains than brawn, and spectacles to go with
intelligence, he's a goody two shoes who knows when to snitch on another
cop and climb the political arena of justice at the same time.
The bad cop (Russel Crowe) watched his mother beaten to death by his
father as a boy. His idea of justice comes with a fist and a punch
before reading your rights. He makes a good thug of an interrogator, and
knows how to beat all the crap and information out of you. This angry
young man won't take no for an answer, and when it comes to battered
women, he gives the abusive husband an equally good battering. He's not
your regular textbook cop who follows the rules, and will take the law
into his own hands by executing justice with the point of his gun. This
renegade lone star is someone you don't want around in a highly volatile
situation, but if your life is on the line he knows how to let the
bullets fly.
The grey cop (Kevin Spacey) can't remember why he became a cop in the
first place. His motivation and sense of right and wrong have become
blurred by the glitz of Hollywood. He's a cop seeking media attention
and knows how to play smart, look good and talk right. He'll tell you
what you want to hear, and gives you a hell of a story to sell. His
brushes with fame come in the form of catching movie stars and high
profile politicians engaging the services of prostitutes. He'll do just
about anything to make the headlines with a photo snap. His amoral life
takes a turn when a set-up between a male prostitute and councillor goes
badly wrong. This wakes up his conscience long since drowned by years of
bribe taking and easy living. Before he can make amends for his waylaid
calling, his life is snatched from him as easily as slipping a 50 dollar
bill into your wallet.
The classy hooker (Kim Basinger) looks like Veronica Lake. She knows how
to play both good cop and bad cop to her best advantage, and can make a
man come as easily as slipping out of her lingerie and into bed. Her
tools are seduction and trickery, but the moves are not hers to direct.
She is a lowly pawn on the chessboard of crime that is used by a crafty
master in the grand finale act of checkmate. She is lucky to survive the
game when so many other important pieces have already been sacrificed
for the greater goal of winning.
This is certainly one of the better suspense, mystery thrillers of the
year, with intelligent script writing, plot control and motivation. Well
worth a nod towards at the cinema.

Title
Review for Grumpier Old Men (1995)
Directed by Howard Deutch
Cast Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Ann-Margret, Sophia Loren, Burgess
Meredith, Daryl Hannah, Kevin Pollak.
Written by Mark Steven Johnson
These grumpy old men keep getting older and crankier with fewer excuses
for abusing each other and getting laid.
The personal mini-war between 'Putz' and 'Moron', played respectively by
Lemmon and Mathau is temporarily on hold because their children (Pollak
and Hannah) are getting married. Now that their avenue for playing
childish pranks on each other is closed, they divert their foolery
towards the unsuspecting Maria (Loren), the new gal in town who has
taken over the old bait shop to open a classy Italian restaurant on the
waterfront.
Loren plays the sultry, Italian lass with the same fire and spirit which
made her famous in 'House Boat'. She rubs cold water and ice over her
breasts as she tempts Matthau's character to leave her restaurant alone;
then invites him over for dinner where they discuss the bisexual organs
of the earth worm resulting in the urge to go worm hunting after desert;
she giggles like a school girl as they fumble in the dark before falling
conveniently onto the moist soil where they start --.. well -- you can
only imagine what happens next.
Although this is not the most romantic way to court a woman, it is
certainly one of the more inventive. What can you say when Matthau's
character takes sexual advise from "Geraldo" and buys gifts for his
girlfriend on the home shopping net work.
The kids eventually call the wedding off because of the overwhelming
meddling of their respective father into their private affairs. As a
result second world war erupts between 'Putz' and 'Moron' in Minnesota,
and it requires the death of Grandpa Gustafson (played by the delightful
Burgess Meredith) to bring everyone back to focus on the more important
issues of life.
Yes there are better things to do in life than to banter over the size
of one's manhood, accuse another's sister of having crabs or getting
laid when it is way pass your bed time.
Comment: Diverting entertainment for the elderly with lots of sex

Review for Jerry Maguire (1996)
Cast: Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., Renee Zellweger, Regina King, Bonnie
Hunt, Jay Mohr, Jonathan Lipnicki, Kelly Preston Director: Cameron Crowe
Screenplay: Cameron Crowe
The business of sports star agencies has fallen into the disreputable
rubbles of mass clientele, money making, and non personal relationships.
(You've gone a million miles, how far to get.)
A man has the inspired vision of returning to the basic, honest, quality
'client first' attitude that the business once had.
(That place that you can't remember, and you can't forget.)
(If you paid a price, she'll let you deep inside.)
With only his principles to rebuild his dreams, and the heart of someone
who believes in him.
(She'll lead you down the path, there'll be tenderness in the air, she'll
let you come just far enough so you know she's really there.)

Review for Picture Perfect (1997)
Cast: Jennifer Aniston, Jay Mohr, Kevin Bacon, Olympia Dukakis, Illeana
Douglas, Kevin Dunn Director: Glenn Gordon Caron Screenplay: Arleen
Sorkin & Paul Slansky and Glenn Gordon
This girl says it all with her hair. Ms Aniston, one of T.V.'s popular
"Friends" would otherwise look ordinary without her healthy, silky brown
locks to toss from side to side. With her hair dominating the screen, I
couldn't help but wonder what conditioner or shampoo she uses, or how
her hair feels or smells. I wanted to caress it, comb it, stroke it --.
No matter how perfect Ms Aniston's hair, the same cannot be said about
her character. She plays Kate Mosley, a young advertising executive
seeking opportunity in a family oriented world of business. The boss
wants ties, roots, and loans to bind the person to the company. In order
to succeed Kate needs a picture perfect family. In order to get the
highly prized promotion she is forced to lie.
The lie, "I'm engaged. Here's a photo of the two of us."
The truth, "The guy in the photo is a perfect stranger"
A small lie only leads to a bigger one, when the simple truth would have
been a better option.
Greater love hath no man than one who is willing to humiliate himself
for the love of a woman. Nick (Jay Mohr), the perfect stranger in the
picture is entirely sincere with his love for Kate. His love carries no
lies, no tricks, and no false motives. He is willing to play along with
her self-destructive charade, up to the point where she chooses her
career over him.
Why is it that we can't see the people who really love us for who we are
until it's almost too late? I don't just mean fiancees and lovers, but
also family and friends. When Kate realises her mistake, it takes a big
heart to forgive her for her cruel actions, and an even bigger one to
accept her for her not so picture perfect trimmings.

Title
Review for Fools Rush In (1997)
Cast: Matthew Perry, Salma Hayek, Jon Tenney. Screenplay: Katherine
Reback. Producer: Doug Draizin. Director: Andy Tennant.
Condoms must have a success rate of about 99.95%. So when a gifted
architect (Perry) temporarily moves to Vegas, and meets an out of sorts
photographer (Hayek), whilst queuing to use the toilet, sparks fly.
Their night of intense passion results in a bundle of joy carrying the
same probability of 0.05%. This leaves us with the basic premise of our
story - the unwed mother, the confused father, and the unborn child.
"Away in a manger, no crib for a bed...."
Fools rush into thunderstorms carrying golf sticks, and fools also rush
into love. The question here is did he marry her because of the baby, or
did he marry her because of love? Our Court Jester answer is - 'What's
Love got to do with it?'  That's right, we're talking about fools aren't
we? Sure thing.
The truth of the matter is this movie really shouldn't have happened.
What is Matthew Perry of 'Friends' fame doing in a movie about fools? Of
course, he's decided to join the rest of his 'Friends' co-stars in their
fleeting fiasco with movie stardom. Now who were they? Oh yes, one ended
up playing the sidekick to a chimp, another ended up in bed with the
dead man's mother, and the third was called either Romy or Michelle. I
begin to see the trend - join the long line of make fun of me movies.
In view that this movie is termed a romantic comedy, a few comments must
be mad to clarify that it is not all that romantic or all that funny. It
is difficult to laugh or feel warm and fuzzy, when within the first half
hour of the film, the couple are in bed, with child and married in the
eyes of 'Elvis'. This is soon followed by the all too familiar
post-marriage problems. Matthew Perry has great difficulty breaking out
of stereotypic nice guy 'Friends' persona, and Hayek always plays here
sultry women roles with enough spice to set the Mexican dip on fire.
Still this movie does point out some salient issues concerning the
difficulties of inter-racial marriage, unsympathetic parents, and
overprotective brothers. Those first few months after you just get
married can be the most happy and also the most difficult -  when you
are still getting use to your partner's pace, and needing to find the
middle ground on which the both of you agree. This is the major problem
that these fools (Perry\Hayek) face when they rush into marriage - when
push comes to shove, they only shove each other harder.

Title
Review for Contact (1997)
Making contact with an alien race doesn't come as easily as "E.T. phone
home" anymore. This reflective movie directed by Robert Zemeckis and
starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey, prods the human skull
with a radar dish full of science and religion. Ever looked up at the
night sky and wondered to yourself, quote "What a great waste of space"?
Well it is, and this movie attempts to give some meaning to those
pondering whether man is truly alone in the universe.
Behind every motive lies an underlying reason, which drives a heroine to
become great. In the case of the Scientist (Foster), the search for the
meaning of her existence is the same as her quest to find her dead
parents. The orphan, whose fascination with the universe begins with a
low frequency radio and telescope, sets out to reach the furthest stars,
in the furthest galaxies, to confirm what man has always feared or
fantasised. She listens and watches from dusk till dawn, for a sign, a
message that carries with it the same vain hope of a child wishing her
parents would return from the grave. Patience is a product of time, not
relativity, and the patient Scientist is rewarded with a signal from
Vega.
To every action there must be an equal and opposite reaction - not so.
For every agnostic scientist there lies in wait a thousand religious
gnostics. Representing the unbalanced proportion of this equation of
beliefs, is the Reverend (McConaughey). Can God and Science coexist?
Does placing faith in one necessarily rule out the existence of the
other? There are two sides to this search for the truth, but enough room
for both sides to come out smiling. After all, the universe is a big,
big place.
E=MC2. Extra-terrestrial = making contact twice. If you receive a
message from an alien, it is only polite to reply. Close to a trillion
dollars is spent on an amusing looking gadget reminiscent of the nucleus
of an atom. Drop a small pod in the centre of revolving twirling rings,
and leave the rest to speculation and imagination. I had a good laugh
when I first saw the contraption. "That thing is not taking anyone
anywhere", I said aloud, but perhaps to a hospital bed with a fracture
or two.
The Quest to make first contact, gets as political as politicians on
heat. The Scientist stands by her belief that there is no God, in front
of an international selection committee. Her application to be earth's
messenger to the stars is rejected. However, the right hand of religion
which strikes her cheek, also carries a fanatical left, which ironically
allows her to journey where no man has gone before.
The Scientist returns without an incredulous story of space and time
travel. She has only a sense of wonder, and feelings of a glorious
encounter of the millennium kind to share with others. An international
enquiry is assembled to judge her story, but brushes aside the truth as
a mere figment of her imagination. At this moment, the Scientist
realises that she is asking others to believe her words on faith alone,
a concept which is as foreign as believing in God; and those who have no
qualms about believing in a supreme being, are unable to believe the
tale of her miraculous journey.
So in this meeting place, Science asks Religion to Believe, but
ironically Religion turns her face. So my longwinded after thought is
that perhaps if the Science had more faith in God, and Religion had more
faith in Science, there may be harmony on the third rock from the Sun.
Exceptionally thought-provoking material, splendidly directed, and
visually sensational. Well done.

Title
Review for Armageddon (1998)
Director: Michael Bay
Writer: Jonathan Hensleigh, J.J. Abrams
Cast: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Will
Patton, Peter Stormare, Keith David, Steve Buscemi
In ARMAGEDDON, everyone wants to save the world, each other, and carry
on them so much love and comradeship, you'll gag on the popcorn. There
are no bad guys, except for a big, mean meteorite and a highly
unintelligent president. Throw in volatile father/daughter/lover
relationships, the fate of humanity hanging on limbo, about to be
blasted into oblivion and NOISE, NOISE, MORE NOISE, and before long,
you're senses have been thrown into overdrive by the Jerry Bruckheimer
team. They have once again pulled out a no stops, glitzy, action packed,
noisy adventure that will leave you dizzy with explosions and
collisions, that just seem to roll across the screen.
Unlike the slower, more thoughtful, DEEP IMPACT, this movie begins with
a flash of destruction  the collapsing Chrysler building - you can't
get smaller than that. Not to mention, an action packed cast all wanting
their fair share of screen time - namely, Mr. B.Willis, Mr. B.Affleck,
and Mr. B.B.Thornton. Mr. Willis gets to give his customary, look how
tough I am' stare, that also spells I'm the greatest American Action
Hero'. Whilst Mr. Affleck, who hasn't learnt how to develop this
technique yet, throws himself about the screen, saying Watch out for
me, I'm better looking, and I'm going to be the next best American
Action Hero.' Mr B.B. Thornton, on the other hand, carries himself with
such self-control and dignity, that says to Willis and Affleck, I may
not be as good looking, but I can sure act better than the both of you.'
On the side, Liv Tyler, looks prettier than all three.
On the whole, an action packed thrill ride that is certain to please
lovers of special effects and action heroes. If this is your kind of
film, then it is probably worth the weight of a movie ticket, as it will
be much less impressive on tape.

Review for Tong fong sam hop (1992)
Starring: Michelle Yeoh, Anita Mui, Maggie Cheung, Damian Lau, Anthony
Wong Paul Chin, James Pak,  Shiguan Ren Directed by: Johnny To Kei-Fung
Action Director: Ching Siu-Tung Written by: Sandy Shaw
The only reason why I came across this China Town kung-fu, girl chic
flick was because my eyes caught the name Michelle Yeoh on the front
cover. A recent convert fan of hers since Bond James Bond, I couldn't
help myself but indulge. Fantasy and fascination are quite becoming when
there are plenty of flying, fighting women in leathers lighting the
screen. So I had a picnic with this movie raging war faring women.
Somebody in modern time Hong Kong is stealing all the babies in town.
This has something vaguely to do with the search for the next Chinese
Emperor and a prophecy resurrecting Chinese world domination. All pretty
unconvincing, mumbo jumbo Chinese fiction, so let's forget about the
plot and focus on the women.
Wonder woman (Anita Mui) wears a rather flimsy purple two piece suit,
with matching cloak and mask. Boring! Nothing as sexy as the US version
of the one piece, flag drag outfit, with wonder belt, lasso and head
piece. Otherwise, Mui knows how to give good kick and glass eyed looks
of emotion when a baby cacks it, and the music, the music really swells
with the moment.
Now to Invisible Woman, my favourite actress Michelle Yeoh is dressed in
divine red. What makes her outfit by far the best, is the use of
excessive wind to blow lots of cloth about. She doubly knows how to kick
arse and when it comes to tragedy, the scale of wind is increased to
blow petals of flowers around the room  to remind her of the lover who
wanted to smell roses before he died. Hmmmm?
Then there is the effervescent, ever boisterous, femme fatale Maggie
Cheung  nicknamed the Thief Catcher - very sexy and very butch. Cheung
delightfully contrasts the dramatic styles of the other two females. She
is all playfulness and gives the movie cheek, as Mui represents
sensibility and Yeoh emits tragedy.
So the ending is all together great fun, as these Amazon sisters combine
to fight a demon reminiscent of the original TERMINATOR  no matter what
you do he keeps coming back. Making this funfest of female action
unbelievably exciting.

Title
Review for Vegas Vacation (1997)
Cast:  Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, Ethan Embry, Marisol
Nichols. Screenplay:  Elisa Bell. Director:  Stephen Kessler.
What was I expecting on this vacation? A five star hotel with a
presidential suite and adjoining swimming pool and spa? Fool. I'm
forgetting that this is a Chevy Chase movie, where pearls are tossed to
swine. I should have rented "Leaving Las Vegas" instead, in which case I
would have got a budget motel and a bargain priced prostitute. Then at
least I would have been spared the meaningless squander of the Griswald
Clan. After four Vacations, "National Lampoon's", "European",
"Christmas" and now "Vegas", I think the next family outing should be
kept a private affair.
I have great difficulty remembering the basic plot elements with any
Chevy Chase movie. In particular the ones where he goes on holiday with
his family. What do they end up doing? How does it start or end? The
truth is I can't remember. Aren't movies meant to be memorable, the good
ones at least. So one can reflect back and say that was a good movie
because -- My single memory of any Vacation movie is of a cyclist who
starts spurting blood from all his major vessels, after being run down
by the Griswald family. Not one for the family photo album I'm afraid.
Little happens in this movie that hasn't already joined the black hole
of lost thoughts lingering in my mind. The children, now grown up go
their worldly ways as their father abandons the family to the guile of
gambling. The wife, lonely and miserable falls into the arms of Wayne
Newton. The movie climaxes when they steal a winning lottery ticket from
a dead man. Which brings up the only thought provoking moment of the
entire movie. Would you do the same?

Title
Review for Notting Hill (1999)
Director: Roger Michell
Cast: Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Mischa Barton, Hugh Bonneville, Rhys
Ifans, Tim McInnerny, Sally Phillips
Screenplay:  Richard Curtis.
When I was asked to see this movie with a friend, my initial reaction
was not Hugh Grant!' I was perhaps wrong to be so harsh, but after his
insidious flirtation with a street hooker, I just could not picture him
in any romantic lead.
What makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars
Hugh, but because it stars Julia and carries with it a brilliantly
written script. This writer Richard Curtis, whose exceptional first work
Four Weddings and Funeral' shows us that he is a master in the domain
of the romantic comedy, with splashes of drama thrown in between.
Hugh and his hair, is almost identical to the character that made him
famous in Four Weddings'. He plays an ordinary guy who is down and out
on his luck. Unfortunately, he is type cast in this role, but
fortunately it works well for him in this movie. If only he would dither
a little less. Julia knows this role well. The glamorous movie star who
is searching for true love. There are moments in this movie, that you
almost weep for her pain felt loneliness. How sad it must be to be so
wealthy and beautiful, but to have no one to share it with.
The writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on
various levels. How differences in social standing can make it almost
impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment. How the media
can be as cruel as it can be attentive, and how fulfilment in life and
love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice.

Title
Review for Mouse Hunt (1997)
Starring: Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, Maury Chaykin, and Christopher Walken.
Screenplay: Adam Rifkin. Producers: Alan Riche, Tony Ludwig, and Bruce
Cohen. Director: Gore Verbinski.
This is a mouse and this is a house, and this is about as funny as the
movie gets. In this unnecessary epic tale of two none-too bright
brothers come to stake their claims on a 10 million house, they must
first boot the illegal tenant a mouse, into the snow. If you like movies
where grown men continually make idiots of themselves, then this movie
is for you. There are enough HOME ALONE scenes in this movie to make all
McCauley Culken wanna-bes, happy little boys.
The mouse doesn't speak a word of English, but has an impeccable sense
of timing and undeniable good sense of humour. Foiling the greedy
brothers with every twist of traps and turn of cheese, it outwits the
dimwit brothers, inflicting hell on all concerned. This rising star of
the animal kingdom is not by any means as talented as BABE, but still
encapsulates intelligence, wit and cheek in its tiny body. Judging from
the fickleness of Hollywood contracts, it is likely that more that two
dozen mice were dumped from the set because they were either getting too
old, too ugly or just plain pregnant. Isn't the going settlement 7
million for all pregnant stars unduly discharged? How I wish I was a
pregnant mouse.
Taking the passenger seats in this roller coaster comedy are the Smuntz
brothers Nathan Lane and Lee Evans. Lane from THE BIRDCAGE once again
shows us his comedic talents as he is beaten and battered to death by a
mouse. Hard to believe, but I guess it takes more than just contrived
acting to convince the audience that a mouse has just beaten you up  so
full marks to Lane for lowering himself to the task. There is also a
delightful appearance from Christopher Walken as the pest control
extraordinare - even he the master of villainous guises falls prey to
the mightier mouse.
So this new offering from SKG is not as funny as it had hoped. Diverting
enough entertainment for the holiday period, but the material is as
intelligent as handing a mouse a script, letting it chew it up before
releasing it in a house to cause mayhem on the world. Happier hunting
next time SKG, this is not the big cheese that everyone will take the
bait for.

Title
Review for High School High (1996)
Cast: Jon Lovitz, Tia Carrere, Louise Fletcher, Mekhi Phifer, Malinda
Williams, Guillermo Diaz Director: Hart Bochner Producers: David Zucker,
Robert Locash, and Gil Netter Screenplay: David Zucker & Robert Locash
and Pat Proft
The big failing of 'send up' movies is that they are never as amusing or
as good as the original. Why see 'High School High' when you can have
heartier laughs watching Michelle Pfeiffer, pretend to be a ex-marine,
turned teacher, changing the lives of her pupils in 'Dangerous Minds.'
Needless to say these movies are out to make money. Scraping the
left-over crumbs from the far superior original movies, at whose expense
they make a living. So who are the big suckers of the general public who
are pulled into watching these send ups?  Most probably, those still
hung up about 'Dangerous Minds', or those still longing for more Opus
from 'Mr Holland's Opus', or as clueless as 'Clueless' itself. With the
exception of movie critics who have to watch the movie in order to
review it.
I won't have to say how bad it was, because that goes without saying.

Title
Review for Hard Rain (1998)
Cast: Cristian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Randy Quaid, Minnie Driver,
Edward Asner, Mark Rolston, Richard Dysart, Betty White, Henry Sears,
Wayne Duvall Director: Mikael Salomon
Too much rain and too much water almost sinks this armoured car heist.
Nevertheless, one has to compliment the production team for playing with
water and attempting to create a feel different from the mundane dry
land bank robbery. Add water, lots of water, so much so that everyone
needs to have a grade A certificate in water treading and a breath span
of 2 minutes. Following in the footsteps of TWISTER and DANTE'S PEAK we
watch nature wreak havoc on a small town. Although the special effects
are not as spectacular as the aforementioned, there is something special
about water not found in wind or lava. The level of destruction lies on
a slowly rising exponential curve and drowning is so peaceful.
I started out desperately wanting to hate this movie for the very
reasons it stared Christian Slater (armour car guard) and Morgan Freeman
(robber) - two actors who I don't particularly enjoy watching. You
wouldn't guess, by watching Slater on screen that he's the problem child
he is in real life. Freeman on the other hand is totally miscast as the
outlaw. His demeanour is entirely too dignified and controlled for a man
desperate to secure his retirement plan. Slater's onscreen love interest
is Minnie Driver (stain glass window expert) who is over the top pouty
and far too concerned about her glass windows than staying alive. The
attempts to generate heart felt emotion between the couple Driver and
Slater fails miserably. They take turns rescuing each other from
drowning, but tense life threatening situations does not equate to long
lasting love relationships. It's Randy Quaid (Sheriff) who by far gives
the best performance amongst this bunch of wet actors.
As I watched this movie from start to conclusion, the more I was able to
forgive its annoying flaws. The only reason for this is purely
philosophical and not theatrical. As I left the cinema I asked myself
this question - If I was in a flooding town excommunicated from the rest
of the world, would I kill for three million dollars tied to a
tombstone? My concluding thought was  no. I can't swim and I can't
shoot and I'm way too generous.

Title
Review for That Thing You Do! (1996)
Cast: Tom Everett Scott, Jonathan Schaech, Liv Tyler, Steve Zahn, Ethan
Embry, Tom Hanks, Charlize Theron, Obba Babatunde Director: Tom Hanks
Screenplay: Tom Hanks Music: Howard Shore U.S.
Some of us carry the burden of two jobs in our life time - the job we do
for a living, and the job which we wished we were doing for a living.
Then there are those who find the two are actually one and the same -
how blessed are they.
So it is not surprising when a talented drum player (Everett Scott),
locked in the confines of a stuffy hardware store, doomed to follow in
the footsteps of his father the owner, breaks free of his paternal
chains to seek his life long dream - playing music. Dreams become
reality and soon the band 'The Wonders' is formed. Their one hit 'That
Thing You Do' climbs the record charts at a record-breaking, phenomenal
rate. This song is repeated so many times during the movie, that you
will either be jumping up and down on the dance floor with the 'Go Go'
dancers, or tearing your hair out with utter insanity.
Tom Hanks in his directing debut, has chosen a movie piece well suited
to his genre. He seems to relish and thrive on anything 60'ish. Namely,
the chocolate eating, mother loving 'Gump Man', or plummeting rockets of
the 13th attempt which both fall somewhere on the JFK timeline. So where
does 'That Thing You Do' fit into this picture - well probably some
where between Vietnam and the Moon.
Hanks has decided to fill his movie with youth, colour and music. These
new faces Everett Scott, Tyler, Schaech and Zahn makes the most of their
opportunity to display their talents in 'That Thing You Do'. Knowing
full well that this 'make it' or 'break it' movie could terminally label
them as 'One Hit Wonders' or 'Multi-hit Contracts'.  An adventurous
directing effort by Hanks, who also contributed to the musical score of
this movie.
Whatever caused the ultimate destruction of the 'Beatles'? Some people
will say Yoko Ono, others will say anti-psychotic medication. Who knows?
Maybe they just got tired of each other. In this movie, it only requires
the selfish ambition of one individual, to destroy the web of friendship
which was in truth the basis of this band's success. A pleasant movie at
any level, but unfortunately, 'That Thing You Do' doesn't quite do it
for me.

Review for Chasing Amy (1997)
Cast: Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Jason Lee, Dwight Ewell, Jason
Mewes, Kevin Smith Director: Kevin Smith Producer: Scott Mosier
Screenplay: Kevin Smith
Silly me thought this movie was a children's story about a boy chasing a
girl called 'Amy'. I wasn't far wrong, just drop the 'R' in children's
and you have for yourself a movie rating. So you can imagine my
eye-popping surprise at receiving some intriguing sex education
experience, I had missed as a happy child; and it was presented with
such heart moving earnesty, timed to 141 'minty' minutes (I was sucking
'minties' all the way through).
Sure, I received my fair share of parental guidance about the 'birds and
the bees, the flowers and the trees', but they didn't quite say it with
the same flare that 'Chasing Amy' did. So here's a couple of things I
learnt about sex:
New Vocabulary (words used in a context never seen before): mouth, eat,
holes, hands, fists, three ways, finger cuffs, love, taste, pussy cat,
laid, riding high, working, shaft, virgin. Now Let's put these words
into a more educational context:
    "Once there was a penning cartoon artist with HANDS as supple as the
skin of a baby's butt. His every stroke WORKED it's way to create a mine
SHAFT of exciting pictures, that filled the imagination and teased the
eye. That was until he met Amy. Then his growing attentions shifted and
twisted and writhed, as he couldn't get this pretty 'dyke', ...ooops (slip
of the tongue), I mean girl out of his mind. Like him she also penned
pictures with lustful STROKES, she'd never penned a man before she
claimed, he was her very first. "My art is not of 'VIRGIN Birth' and
never before seen by any man."
    So with masterful, heaves and sighs, she stroked his ego and PUSSY
CAT, and  they fell in 'LOVE' with the same moans and groans of a
restless night. Then RIDING HIGH on this off-beat romance comes the
artist's best friend with breathless news, that in the deepest, darkest,
moistest regions of the past, she had once been imprisoned in a HOLE
with 'FINGER CUFFS'. "I don't believe it the artists says, how can this
be, she claims her art has never been seen by another of my kind. Her
MOUTH has not EATEN of the forbidden fruit,  but only tasted the
sweetness of mine. I am her first I am sure of it."
    But those curious thoughts still plagued his mind, until he LAID
down those angry FISTS, to find the truth revealed - that there were
actually THREE WAYS of penning it. 'Nay' says Amy, 'I've changed my
style. There is but one way of ending it' - Slap!"
    From the pages of 'Masterful Penstrokes' by T.M.T. Voon
Kevin Smith the writer/director of 'Clerks' and 'Mallrats', once again
presents his material with the same bold, brash, no-apologies style
evident in his previous work. Relatively new faces, Ben Affleck (the
cartoonist) and Joey Lauren Adams (Alyssa=Amy), seem to have a lot of
fun presenting the daring ideas and gritty dialogue. Certainly, this is
not a movie to be viewed by the conservative, and faint hearted  -  I
guess that includes me, but I thought it was a child"R"en's movie.
This is an intelligent comedy, with a witty/dirty script which
challenges the mind about unusual relationships that seem to defy the
normal terms of convention. This story speaks not so much of whether
you're gay or not, but more so about accepting a person for who they
are, despite their colourful, regretful past.

Review for U.S. Marshals (1998)
Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes, Robert Downey Jr., Joe Pantoliano,
Tom Wood, Lorenzo Clemons, Ray Toler, LaTanya Richardson, Kate Nelligan,
Irene Jacob
Director: Stuart Baird
Producers: Anne Kopelson, Arnold Kopelson
Screenplay: John Pogue
My general impression of U.S. Marshals was, Oh no, not again'. Not that
this is an overtly bad film, its just very second rate and mediocre when
compared to its predecessor, THE FUGITIVE. How can one not compare it to
the well-crafted, 1993 thriller, starring Harrison Ford? Let's face it,
our new fugitive, Wesley Snipes, ex-federal agent, who is framed for
trading secrets to the Chinese Government, doesn't carry the same
charisma or crowd appeal as the perpetually, likeable Ford.
Part of the problem lies with the fact that the audience does not quite
identify or empathise with our present fugitive, Mark Sheridan (Snipes).
He kills two federal agents in self-defence  so what? Who cares? Secret
service agents get killed for a living. Whilst in the case of Dr Richard
Kimble (Harrison Ford)  his wife was brutally murdered and he was
framed for the crime. Now people, as a general rule, get quite upset
when personal items like wives and family members get slaughtered.
Besides not spending enough time, developing our fugitive's plight, too
much time is focussed on the Deputy Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee
Jones) and his group of uninteresting, deputy buffoons. Basically, Lee
Jones gets to show what a real Jock' his character can be.  Whilst his
deputies mope about, like a bunch of non-professional idiots sipping
coffee, cracking unfunny-smart-arse-jokes and occasionally getting
themselves killed. Most humorous of all is a spaced-out, tired-looking
Robert Downey Jr, who perhaps would have fared better off the set, and
in the comfort zone of rehab instead.
There are some memorable scenes, like Snipes swinging of a high rise
with cable in hand and then escaping on top of a train. But these tense
moments are far and few in between, and perhaps they shouldn't have
bothered to bring back U.S. MARSHALS, if it was only to let the fugitive
get away again.

Review for Hope Floats (1998)
Cast: Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick Jr., Gena Rowlands, Mae Whitman,
Michael Pare, Cameron Finley
Director: Forest Whitaker
Producer: Linda Obst
Screenplay: Steven Rogers
Sandra has finally found a movie of substance, after such disappointing
efforts like SPEED 2 and IN LOVE AND WAR. These epic disasters were
rather unfortunate in view of previous successes like SPEED and WHILE
YOU WERE SLEEPING. This otherwise, likeable, always charming, bankable
star, has decided to dig deeper this time round, and found something
that is unlikely to stink or sink. From this aspect itself, we can
literally say that yes, HOPE does FLOAT, even though your last two
movies were big box office duds.
In an age when divorce and separation is on the rise, comes a movie
about surviving the holocaust of family break-ups. This is a story of an
ex-beauty queen, Birdee Pruit (Bullock), who is dumped by her spineless
husband for her best friend. The point hits home when all is revealed on
a talk show, unbeknownst to the victim. Carrying wounded pride, Birdee
wanders home to her mother to nurse her wounds. This is a journey of a
woman who initially wallows in self-pity and depression, only to survive
the crisis by reclaiming her dignity and more importantly, retaining the
love of her daughter.
Yes, this deep and mushy stuff, but at least it makes a valiant attempt
to address the issues at hand. Sandra will not lose fans by smiling,
crying and laughing through problems relating to difficult mothers,
angry daughters and unfaithful husbands. Harry Connick Jr is affable
enough to be an old beau, who is still single and vies for her
affections. Whilst Michael Pare takes a break from C grade pics and
appears likeable as the unfaithful husband.
Overall, a thoughtful movie, that says that HOPE FLOATS when you are
holding on to the last straw. Things tend to get better even when you're
hurting badly on the inside. Don't mope about, don't blame yourself and
don't keep hoping your unfaithful husband will come back to you. Take
the remains of the day and do something worthwhile. Somehow you will
survive the awful mess of a marriage breakup.

Review for Beautician and the Beast, The (1997)
Cast: Fran Drescher, Timothy Dalton, Ian McNeice, Patrick Malahide, Lisa
Jakub, Adam Lavorgna, Heather DeLoach, Michael Lerner, Phyllis Newman
Director: Ken Kwapis Screenplay: Todd Graf
"The hills are alive with the sound of ...'
What's that awful noise? Oh my goodness .. It's THE NANNY!
My grandmother is a big fan of Fran Drescher, and "The Nanny". So we
went to see this movie, and what we essentially saw was - well - another
two hour episode of "The Nanny"; but without the strong supports of
Niles and Miss Babcock.
She's a beautician (what's new); is hired by the wealthy dictator of a
eastern European country (Dalton) to look after his children. Sound
familiar? Unfortunately, there isn't any singing nuns or hostile Nazi's
to help make the plot more exciting.
Nevertheless, Fran Drescher has decided to stick with what she knows
best - big hair, make-up, high heels and unorthodox child rearing.
Comment: For die hard fans of "The Nanny'.

Title
Review for Fallen (1998)
Cast: Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth
Davidtz,  James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas
Director: Gregory Hoblit
Screenplay: Nicholas Kazan
How does one catch a serial killer that is able to possess and transfer
itself from one human host to the next? I'm referring to evil spirits,
also known as fallen angels. In particular one called Azazel, a close
relative of Beezelbub who did so much body hopping during the movie it
gave me a blooming headache!
This movie presumes that serial killers are the way they are because of
possession by evil spirits. These spirits are supposedly able to take
complete control of man, causing them to do wicked things. Can you
imagine the legalities in the law court  Sorry Your Honour, I didn't
mean to murder the boss, my brother, the school teacher or his lover.
It's just that an evil spirit called Azazel made me do it.' Even if evil
spirits did exist, this version is totally unbiblical  taking away any
human responsibility for murder and making it in to some fancy Hollywood
concept for cheap thrills. I don't buy it.
This movie is a poor choice for Denzel Washington, a fine actor and
regular Church-goer. I find it surprising that he would condone such
nonsense  not the fact that spirits exist, but the fact they go body
hopping at a whim, causing good people to do evil things. John Goodman
is a steady co-star in any movie and helps lend a hand to deliver a slow
and thoughtless script. FALLEN is so full of superstitious mumbo-jumbo
that the words Acracadabra' and Open Sesame' should have been regular
quotes. It is a relief to see that Donald Sutherland doesn't play
another sinister bad guy, one of his more recent entrapments.
I have little else pleasant to say about this way over the top rendition
of an over regurgitated serial killer franchise.

Title
Review for Mercury Rising (1998)
Cast: Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin, Miko Hughes, Chi McBride, Kim Dickens
Director: Harold Becker Producers: Brian Grazer, Karen Kehela
Screenplay: Lawrence Konner, Mark Rosenthal based on the novel SIMPLE
SIMON by Ryne Pearson
After viewing MERCURY RISING, it may be wrongly supposed that Bruce
Willis appears to be fumbling about for interesting side-kicks to fill
his action flicks. This movie may be viewed as DIE HARD WITH AUTISTIC
BOY, mixed in with strong psychological elements of remorse and
atonement for past failures (failing to save teenagers in a foiled bank
robbery). The plot attempts to pull at the viewer's heart strings, by
setting up too many a situation where a handicapped child is put in
harms way, only then to be rescued and hugged by the burly Willis  Oh
please! Or this may be seen as a egotistical movie where Bruce gets to
do all the talking, whilst his autistic co-star Simon (Miko Hugues) does
little except stare into blank space, grunt and scream when touched.
MERCURY RISING is not all bad, cause I can name at least one other
Willis movie that far out stinks this one  THE JACKAL. This movie
speaks of the ruthlessness of the NSA (National Security Agency). When
an autistic child is able to crack the American Government's toughest
code, their solution to the problem is to eliminate the child and
family. Naturally Bruce baby (FBI Agent) sees through their charade and
goes about to right wrongs in a DIE HARD/BOY SCOUT sort of a way. One
would think that perhaps after soooo many movies where disputes are
settled by fists and guns, a solution to the problem would be found
through mature discussion  after all, the FBI and NSA are on the same
side! But noooo, Bruce and Alec have to fall into the childish routine
of slugging it out in the end, like kids in a playground fight. I
personally felt that instead of trying to kill the kid who can crack any
code, the NSA should have utilised his abilities to break enemy nation
security codes  resolving the situation peacefully, calmly and
sensibly.
So I was not impressed by this movie, or by Willis' acting, attitude or
action. Alec Baldwin (ruthless NSA chief) has hardly any screen time and
is not seen much till the end of the movie. As for the poor kid they
dragged into making this movie, I just hope he doesn't become
psychologically traumatised by all of this Hollywood, BULLAHOO
commotion.
The only thing that rises in this movie is your blood pressure, at
having to endure such heartfelt trash.

Review for Fargo (1996)
Cast: William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand, Peter Stormare,
Harve Presnell Director: Joel Coen Producer: Ethan Coen Screenplay: Joel
and Ethan Coen
So the Coen brothers get this idea for a picture about real life, yah.
It's about life in Minnesota where everybody speaks like this, yah. It's
very cold, and people are a bit strange, yah. So this car sales man
wants to get some money from his mean father-in-law. So he gets two bad
men to kidnap his wife for money, yah. These bad men go crazy or
something and start killing everyone, yah. Sounds like fun, yah, but
it's real sick. We have a great female sheriff and she's having a baby,
yah. Her husband loves her a lot, and makes her breakfast every morning,
yah. She's having a baby so she likes to eat a lot. Anyway she is
looking into these dead bodies, and she's real smart, yah. Smarter than
them bad guys. Her name is Frances McDormand, yah and she gets chosen
for one of these golden men things, and wins it yah. So I didn't like
the picture because the story was real sick, yah. I felt like throwing
up when the wood machine thing was used for something real bad and
naughty, yah. But otherwise it's real smart looking and the people get
to say smart things if they aren't being killed, yah.
Comment: Far out, Far off, Fargo, yah.

Title
Review for Man Who Knew Too Little, The (1997)
Cast: Bill Murray, Joanne Whalley, Alfred Molina, Peter Gallagher,
Richard Wilson, Geraldine James, John Standing, Anna Chancellor
Director: Jon Amiel
Screenplay: Robert Farrar and Howard Franklin based on the novel "Watch
That Man" by Robert Farrar
The problem with spy movies carrying comedy at every turn, is the
necessity to retain credibility with the audience and yet sustain the
slapstick humour right till the very end. A prime example that fails to
do both are the NAKED GUN movies. On the other hand, I feel THE PINK
PANTHER movies succeed solely because of the classical Sellers
performance they contain. Parallels can be drawn between THE MAN WHO
KNEW TOO LITTLE and Inspector Clouseau, yet it pales in comparison
because of Bill Murray.
The plot begins with an ordinary, down and out actor, Wallace Ritchie
(Bill Murray), who visits his successful, wealthy brother James (Peter
Gallagher) in England. In order to get the odd ball, family failure out
of his hair, James arranges for Wallace to join a live street theatre,
where the acting is played out in the real world. Unfortunately, Wallace
is in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets involved with actual
murder and mystery. However, Wallace remains totally ignorant of this
fact even when his life is in constant danger; and this is where the
problem lies - trying to maintain his naivety. The role of Wallace
requires the charms of an innocent fool; a role not suited to Murray (he
can play the fool, but with little charm or innocence), but a role ideal
for the late Peter Sellers.
Overall there are some amusing scenes with misplaced bombs, assassins
who are assassinated, playful torture scenes and wild car chases all
reminiscent of the 60's PINK PANTHER, but sadly missing Sellers. Bill
Murray tries his best but unfortunately is unable to carry out the part,
not because he is a bad actor, but because it requires a certain type of
actor. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer is adequate as a slightly, ditzy bombshell,
whilst Alfred Molina has fun with his role as Boris the Butcher.

Title
Review for Snow White (1997)
Cast : Sigourney Weaver, Sam Neill, Gil Bellows, Monica Keena Written by
Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm and Wilhelm Carl Grimm Screenplay by Thomas E.
Szollosi Deborah Serra
Hi Ho Hi Ho a merry way we go! Not any more. Get rid of the dwarfs and
Snow White is left standing at the alter like a bride without
bridesmaids. Make Snow White's love interest, one of the dwarfs instead
of Prince Charming, and you may be wrongly accused of indulging in sick
fantasies or reading too much Hustler'. When in truth the Brothers'
Grimm are too blame for not including these adorable little men in their
very grim original, but instead using dirty, odd ball ruffians to help a
girl out in need. Thanks, to Uncle Walt all this grim darkness is
removed and instead we have a very happy, very gay version of
enlightened, mirthful, sleepy, sneezy, grumpy, snotty etc etc midgets on
the constant move protecting the girl child in desperate need of a tan.
Okay, so it's the original story, but it doesn't mean that it's the
better version. To tell you the truth, I think this version sucks. But
first I will tell you what I did like about it. I liked the fact that
once upon a time, the Wicked Queen (Sigourney Weaver) was once a loving
wife and mother, until she miscarries Lord Hoffman's (Sam Neil) son.
Then a mixture of post natal psychosis and depression sets in resulting
in her extreme hatred of the surviving first child (Snow White  Monica
Keena) which is not hers. This helps us understand why she is sooooo
jealous, plus the fact she's getting older, in desperate need of Hormone
Replacement Therapy and a face-lift. Also, Snow White is a brat, and
deserves to get scratched and humiliated  she just isn't a very nice
little girl. So what didn't I like? I hated the fact that there were no
dwarves, and the bunch of brigand miners who help Snow White have names
that all begin with moron.
Sigourney Weaver shines in the role of the evil step-mother. Maybe it's
because she has all that mothering experience from close encounters with
Alien' Queens that give her a bitchy edge. Her pale white complexion
and fine facial features glow in the reflection of the mirror and there
is no doubt Who is the fairest of all'. Sam Neil is wasted in a
bombastic, silly role of a weak male figure far too easily manipulated.
Monca Keena, a relative new comer gives a very ordinary performance of
the fairy tale princess. She looks too anaemic and is too hot headed to
adequately portray a likeable Snow White.
This is definitely not the fairy tale you want to tell you're children
about.

Review for Devil's Advocate, The (1997)
What started out as a standard court room drama, took a turn for the
worse when the subject material went from weird to out right bizarre. In
fact much of the material is quite sickening if one has time to
contemplate it. The Devil is not just an allegory for someone evil in
this movie, the evil is actually THE DEVIL himself in flesh and blood.
Let's talk about bizarre. Keanu Reeves, the advocate, lawyer character
in this movie, is trying to make a baby with his wife on the lounge room
floor. As this is occurring the image of his wife keeps flipping between
her and another mysterious woman. He's confused at first, there is
hesitancy in his eyes, but then he really starts coming and going. His
wife is receptive, the other woman aggressive, it begins to turn him on
as he loses himself in this three way fantastic orgy. The only thing of
note about this entirely depraved scene is that Keanu Reaves has a hairy
bum.
If you were brought up in the Catholic, Christian, Jewish or Muslim
faith, then you may find the end scenes difficult to handle. The Devil
(Al Pacino) has a field day mocking God and some of the words spoken are
nothing short of blasphemous. So be warned. Issues like spawning the
Anti-Christ through incestuous relations between the devil's seed are
prominent themes in the movie. Not to mention sex, mutilation, nudity,
lunacy, suicide and any evil thing you can think off. If you can excuse
all of this, or if you like this sought of thing, then you will probably
enjoy the movie. Personally it's not something I could stomach.
Al Pacino does an over the top performances as the Devil. I feel of late
that he has been overacting with most of his movie roles. As for Keanu
Reeves, his is actually quite good in this movie, and this is probably
his best performance since .well since .. BILL AND TED??? I
personally disliked the content of this movie, much more so than its
make. This is not a movie for those with strong religious convictions.

Review for Other Sister, The (1999)
Cast: Juliette Lewis, Diane Keaton, Tom Skerritt, Giovanni Ribisi, Poppy
Montgomery, Sarah Paulson, Hector Elizondo.
Screenplay: Bob Brunner and Garry Marshall.
Producers: Mario Iscovich and Alexandra Rose.
Director: Garry Marshall
1. The other sister is handicapped.
2. Handicapped people have feelings like normal' human beings.
3. They need to love and be loved by others, as we all do.
4. They also do it' (have sex). This is a valid topic and shouldn't be
subject to taboo. Although the issues of contraception should have been
more clearly brought out in the movie. But I guess there's only so much
one can explore within the boundaries of dominating mothers, lesbian
sisters and retarded boyfriends.
5. Every one has their song, and marching band music can be a real turn
on.
6. This is a romantic comedy that will bring laughter and tears to your
eyes at the same time.
7. The main actors Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi are not
handicapped in real life, although their performance may convince you
otherwise.
8. This movie should be viewed by anyone who has an unexplained fear of
disabled people.
9. This movie has more depth to it than Pretty Woman'. Although I would
have loved to see Julia Roberts and Richard Gere play a retarded
prostitute and demented business man respectively.

Review for Shine (1996)
Cast: Geoffrey Rush, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Noah Taylor, Lynn Redgrave,
Googie Withers, John Gielgud, Sonia Todd, Alex Rafalowicz, Nicholas Bell
Director: Scott Hicks Screenplay: Jan Sardi based on a story by Scott
Hicks
"Practice makes perfect", my mother always told me, but did I listen to
her? Stubborn to the very end, I remember defying her at age ten,
standing in front of the piano and refusing to play my scales. Boy did I
get a hiding that day, not so much for refusing to play the piano, but
for calling the piano numerous degenerate names, and in the midst of the
abuse including the much revered composers Chopin, Mozart and Bach. You
will be relieved to hear that my appreciation for classical music has
improved with time.
I was never a truly talented musician to begin with. My idea of piano
playing was 'slam the keys, make some noise, forget about timing, and
use those foot pedals for muscle toning'. So when faced with a talent
like David Helfgott, one cannot help but be amazed at how a human soul
can transform that hated instrument into the harp of the gods. Play,
David, play.
My mother took piano playing pretty seriously, but I can say without a
doubt David's father was obsessive. My one qualm with the movie is with
him: 'I love you David (shove). I really do (hit). You know I love you
David (whack). If you go David, I won't love you any more (punch). Did I
hurt you David? (kick). Remember David, you will survive, life goes on.'
It isn't clearly explained in the movie whether David Helfgott's main
psychiatric illness was schizophrenia, or a major depressive disorder.
The viewers are left with a picture of a young David receiving
electro-convulsive therapy to the brain, post playing 'Rachmaninov'. No
particular event or reason is given, but one can only conclude that it
was a combination of loneliness, the manipulative and emotional
wranglings of his father, and that unusual spirit which is David
Heffgot.
This is undoubtedly a moving tale of love of music, and survival of
parent guilt. Painful to watch because of the destructive paternal
instincts of David's father, who wished the best for his son, but also
needed to bathe in his prodigy child's glory. So when the fledgling
talent decides to spread his own wings, the control freak parent panics
that he will lose his one claim to fame. Thus reacting in an un-fatherly
manner which forever scars his child's life. A sensitive portrayal of
David Helfgott by Geoffrey Rush and a well deserved Oscar.
So my tale ends with my brother and sister, who were not so disobedient
as I, 'shining' at every local piano competition, winning every
'glittered' prize. Though I didn't quite get my opportunity to 'shine'
as a child, at least I knew what I didn't want to do. So the child which
was Tim Voon, enjoyed the rest of his youthful days, without that
peculiar instrument in his life; and as for the beating my mother did
give me, thank God it hasn't left me with rapid speech; and as David's
father would say 'you will survive, life goes on' - without that damned
finger-twitching, precise metronoming, endless scaling, piano.
