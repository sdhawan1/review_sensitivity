Title
Review for Chasing Amy (1997)
*** (out of 4) There is something about Kevin Smith's style that I just
don't like. I enjoyed Chasing Amy while I was watching it, but
afterwards I was glad it was over. In that sense it was like Pulp
Fiction. Both are fun to watch, but I was relieved to come out of the
theater and see that reality isn't like what was on screen.
To chase Amy is to regret having ruined your once-in-a-lifetime
relationship, as Holden (Ben Affleck) learns the hard way.
Holden lives with Banky (Jason Lee), and the two of them collaborate on
the comic book "Chronic and Bluntman." After a comic book convention,
they join two friends, Hooper and Alyssa (Dwight Ewell and Joey Lauren
Adams) for drinks.
While Banky and Hooper argue over the sexual orientation of the
characters in Archie comics, Holden and Alyssa get to know each other.
Alyssa invites Holden to a night club the next day and they hit it off
well. Holden is just starting to see the beginnings of a relationship
when Alyssa runs into her girlfriend and starts making out with her.
Naturally, Holden is disappointed and shocked. Later, while Alyssa and
Banky compare cunnilingus-related injuries, Holden moves from
disappointment to disgust and despair.
A few days later, Alyssa shows up to make amends with Holden. She
doesn't want their friendship to end. They become very good friends,
but Holden still wants more.
It turns out that Alyssa loves Holden enough to allow the relationship
to grow beyond friendship and all is well until Holden learns of her
sexual history with men.  This is too much for him and he calls the
relationship off. There is much soul-searching by all of the characters
before the movie reaches its logical conclusion.
The story is a refreshing twist on the standard romantic comedy, but
something about Kevin Smith's style leaves me feeling a little dirty.
First of all, this movie (like Clerks, his debut) is very
sex-centered.  His characters talk a lot about sex, which makes for
interesting, honest, and funny dialog, but the sum of the movie, then,
feels -- well, dirty. It seems that these characters live in a
mystical land far away from this reality -- another world where
everybody has sex with ten different partners by high school
graduation, then talks about it at length with strangers and
acquaintances.
Also, this movie has a very heterosexual male point of view. One might
say it borders on prejudice. Holden is okay with Alyssa's promiscuity
as a lesbian, but he can't accept the idea of her promiscuity with men.
Also, Alyssa's homosexuality is "cured" when she meets the right man.
The movie does handle this issue sensitively and carefully -- it is
within Alyssa's character to choose Holden -- but the whole idea seems
heterosexist. Imagine a counterexample: two friends, both male, one
gay. Imagine the gay friend falling hopelessly in love with the
straight friend. The straight friend is not likely to be swayed, no
matter how persistent the gay friend is. In fact, the awkwardness of
the situation might ruin their friendship.  But we accept the situation
when a charming heterosexual man wins over a sexually confused
lesbian.
Still, Chasing Amy has good characters, good dialog, and a good
screenplay.
Alyssa is a well developed character. She is not merely the object of
another character's desire, as is too often the case in romantic
comedies.  Hooper is a minor comic character but his wisdom adds a
rational voice to the movie. He is funny as the flaming homosexual
cartoonist whose plays the angry African-American in order to sell more
copies of his comic, "Cracker-Hatin' Coon." (This is another instance
of Smith the screenwriter walking a fine line between creating
interesting autonomous characters and furthering stereotypes.)
Banky and Holden share some good dialog. They disagree enough that
their discussions are always interesting, exposing all sorts of
different layers within different topics. When Holden and Alyssa talk,
they reveal their hearts to each other with a bare honesty uncommon in
most movies.
The story is simple enough, but Holden introduces an interesting twist
near the end which itself would have made for a clever ending. Smith
carries the story just a little further to explore the consequences of
that twist.
As repellent as I sometimes find Kevin Smith, I must admit that he is a
talented filmmaker. Chasing Amy appears to have been made on a
shoestring (albeit a bigger one than Clerks). Smith realizes that he
doesn't need special effects, slick lighting, or expensive sets to make
a good move. A good script, a few friends, and a promise to thank all
of his backers in the credits is all he needs.

Title
Review for For Love of the Game (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) Sam Raimi made his name in over-the-top horror films.
He broke into the mainstream with movies like DARKMAN and THE QUICK AND
THE DEAD, but they still had a hint of the macabre. Even A SIMPLE PLAN
had the trademark Raimi quirky darkness. But now that Raimi's directed
Kevin Costner in a sentimental baseball movie, what's next? A G-rated
David Lynch movie? Wes Craven directing a touching drama?
Costner plays Billy Chapel, a pitcher who's been with the Tigers his
entire, 19-year career. The owner, Roy Wheeler (Brian Cox) confides to
Billy that he's had to sell the team and that the new owners will trade
him away next season. If Billy would quit, it would sweeten the
unsatisfying business of selling the team.
Billy's pitching arm is in constant pain and he's not getting any
younger. His girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) stood him up last night and
this morning she told him she is leaving him for good. His team stinks
this year and today's game means nothing to the Tigers. Billy realizes
that after today, his life as he knows it will fade quickly and
unglamorously away.
He resolves not to give in. He resolves to fight the only way he can, by
playing ball.
For seven innings, the film shows his life in flashback as he broods on
the owner's request, his brilliant career, his relationship, and his
love of the game.
Come the eighth inning, Billy realizes he's in the midst of a perfect
game. If he can get past six more batters, he will have the perfect
reason to retire, and maybe follow his girlfriend to England.
For a large part of the movie, the emotion works. (FOR LOVE OF THE GAME
has been called a tearjerker, and not unfairly.) Costner's not the most
aggressive of actors, but the low-key brooding was well within his
grasp. His relationship with Jane seemed genuine and caring. His
relationship with baseball was particularly convincing.
However the character of Jane was not given a life of her own. She was
more a plot device than a person. She's a single mother who lives in New
York as a freelance writer for beauty magazines. I know single mothers
and I know freelance writers. You do not feed two mouths on a
freelancer's salary, especially in New York.
Her career aside, there are other places where her fights with Billy are
clearly written for the plot, rather than arising from the characters.
Billy says to her face that his personal trainer is more important to
him than she is, something even the crudest of males would know not to
say. Later, Jane, in return, snaps at him and angrily dumps him. It's
clear that they fight, but it's not clear why either one of them,
individually, would. The only explanation is that the plot needed more
conflict.
The supporting characters were pretty good, considering how small a role
each one played. Jena Malone (from Contact) played Jane's daughter
Heather, both as a 13-year old and a college freshman. ** played Birch,
Billy's former teammate and current opponent, with just enough
exaggeration to make him stand out. And John C. Reilly (BOOGIE NIGHTS,
WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE?) gives another very good performance as a
strong supporting player.
FOR LOVE OF THE GAME was well directed by Raimi (who managed to sneak in
a little blood and some talk of disfigurement). Small details give away
some of the thought that went into each scene, like the jeers of the
crowd while Billy pitches, or the constant presence of autograph seekers
in New York City.
In spite of some obvious flaws in a very important area, namely
character development, the emotion of the story plays pretty well. The
sentimentality isn't for everybody, but if you're interested in seeing
it, go for it.

Title
Review for 13th Warrior, The (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) THE 13TH WARRIOR is a fantasy/action movie that has
none of the trappings of the usual modern action movies. There are no
snappy insults, no romantic subplots, no comic sidekicks, and no
gratuitous pop songs blaring over the film or the credits. None of them
were missed.
It's worth mentioning that the two producers of this film were the
story's author (Michael Crichton) and the director. Perhaps it is
because the people close to the story had control, that the film didn't
become watered down. If so, it's a pairing I hope to see more of.  
Antonio Banderas plays Ahmed, an Arab poet. He is caught in a
compromising affair with a young princess and banished, along with his
teacher (Omar Sharif). The two head north out of the city.
Later, fleeing some bandits, the two invite themselves into the
hospitality of a tribe of Vikings who have wandered south. The next day,
a boy arrives from farther north, asking for help back in his home
village. The Viking fates decree that 13 warriors must go help, and that
the 13th man be not a northman. Ahmed the poet is drafted and his
teacher is sent back home.
The thirteen arrive at the besieged village to find almost no men of
fighting age left alive. The king welcomes the heroes-to-be, and tells
them that the Vin, a mysterious race of man-bear creatures, have been
making raids. The Vin always decapitate their victims and gnaw on the
remains.
It eventually becomes clear that 13 warriors and a village of farmers
are no match for a burgeoning tribe of cannibals. Expecting death and
defeat, they struggle for a plan that will make every life count.
Not many movies portray Vikings in the dark ages. In fact, the only one
that has had an impact on my generation is MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY
GRAIL. So the setting in THE 13TH WARRIOR is fairly original for 1999
(that is to say, unexploited by Hollywood).
The movie gives us a speculative glance at the lives the Vikings might
have led as well. Since our hero is an outsider, he gives the audience
someone to identify with as he learns their customs and ways. Having
that hero be Muslim adds an exotic flavor. It makes the entire setting
all the more exotic and foreign.
The movie has high production values, (a trait I admittedly respect more
highly than other critics). I was impressed by the look of the movie,
and by some of the obviously unfaked settings. A Viking village was at
least partially created, as was a great wooden Viking ship. A long scene
in a cave appeared to actually be lit by the torches carried by the
characters, and the cave itself appeared to be real, or at least made of
more substantial stuff than can be seen in STAR TREK.
Much of the movie was shot on location in British Columbia and other
parts of Canada. The cinematography (by Peter Menzies) captures the cold
outdoor atmosphere of northern climes. Whether it was the unsoftened
shadows at midday or some trick with the lens, the air in the north
looked crisp and cold.
In contrast, the nighttime battles and inky cave interiors were a dark
black, lit by harsh orange torches. The look could have been a cheap way
to save on precise special effects, but it was an effective way to
convey fear and claustrophobia.
One last noteworthy detail is the way in which McTiernan handles the
language barrier between Arabic, Latin, and Norse. It's the same trick
he used in THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and it works very well. Perhaps he
drew too much attention to his trick, but it forestalled an objection
that had been forming in my head.
Yet in spite of the best things about THE 13TH WARRIOR, I still found
myself less than entirely engaged. I kept waiting for the REALLY
thrilling parts, always expecting something more. Clearly, my
expectations were wrong, but it's also probably fair to criticize the
movie for being slow in parts, and for meandering at the beginning.
THE 13TH WARRIOR never really wowed me while I was watching it, but I
grew more impressed with it afterwards. You won't find explosive,
blockbuster action in THE 13TH WARRIOR, but see it if you'd like
something a notch older, more serious, and more mature.

Title
Review for Galaxy Quest (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) You're dragged to a party after a Star Trek convention,
and you get trapped in a corner by a "uniformed" nerd who thinks he's
interesting. He's telling you his idea for a screenplay, called GALAXY
QUEST, where William Shatner- and Leonard Nimoy-types are at a Con, and
they meet some REAL aliens, but they think they're just eccentric fans.
"Ho-hum," you yawn, and politely excuse yourself to go find your date so
you can get out of this nuthouse.
Well, believe it or not, somebody actually produced GALAXY QUEST
(namely, Mark Johnson and Charles Newirth). It's as bad as you would
imagine, and yet it's as good as it could possibly be.
Tim Allen plays Jason Nesmith, an actor on the TV show Galaxy Quest.
He's at a sci-fi convention with his "crew" (Alan Rickman as Sir Alex,
who wears an elaborate alien headpiece for the show and who longs for
some real acting work; Sigourney Weaver as the female officer who has to
wear a revealing outfit; and Tony Shalhoub who looks like he's having
fun as the ship's engineer.)
Nesmith often takes side jobs playing his character at private parties.
One of the "parties" turns out to be thrown by four real space aliens
who have built a ship exactly like the one on the show. They invite the
captain and his crew to their home planet. Once there, the demure,
polite aliens get to the point -- they ask the crew if they wouldn't
mind saving their world from an evil alien race, just like they do every
week on TV.
I say GALAXY QUEST is as bad as you would imagine because there is very
little you can do with this concept. It's one joke, repeated in as many
ways as will fit into 90 minutes. What's worse is that the joke is a
specific parody, and if you've never followed Star Trek, the movie just
won't make sense.
The second-worst thing the filmmakers could have done is to make a joke
of the movie's TV show, which they did. Cardboard sets and cornball
dialogue get a few cheap laughs, but the movie would have been better if
the TV show were more plausible. Part of the humor in GALAXY QUEST
relies on mistaking what's real for what's fake. By making the show
cheap and hokey, they lost some of that comic leverage for the bigger
jokes.
The WORST thing they could have done is to make a joke of the TV show's
actors (the movie's characters). But they didn't, and because the
characters are not parodies, because they have real depth, the movie is
as good as it could possibly be.
Tim Allen in particular breaths life into his role. He drinks and has a
huge ego. But on the other hand, he loves his role, he loves his fans,
and he loves signing autographs and answering questions. In other words,
Allen brings a unique, vivid personality to the role instead of just
settling for a bad William Shatner imitation. If Academy Awards were
based on the ratio of performance quality to source material, Allen's
score might earn him a nomination.  
Clearly, GALAXY QUEST takes some well-deserved shots at Star Trek, like
the elaborate headpieces and the revealing outfit. The movie also has
some funny lines that we've always wanted to hear on Star Trek. The
expendable crewmate manning a computer console calls out "Hey guys,
there's a red thingy movin' toward the green thingy. I think we're the
green thingy." Sigourney Weaver, crawling through the ventilation to get
to the bridge, says "Ducts. Why is it always ducts?" 
But taken as a whole, GALAXY QUEST is just a parody. And parody is only
funny when you know the source material. GALAXY QUEST could never stand
on its own, and in the annals of filmmaking, it won't get its own entry.
If it is mentioned at all it will only be as a footnote to the Star Trek
movies.
If you're a Trekkie who doesn't take it too seriously, you will probably
have a good laugh at GALAXY QUEST. You should take a look. But if you
don't know the difference between Star Trek, Star Wars, and Star Search,
then you might as well see something else.

Title
Review for Simple Plan, A (1998)
*** (out of 4) This film provoked a strong emotional response in me. The
doomed scheme, the naďve players, and the sad, twisted music filled me
with dread and made me squirm in my seat.
A Simple Plan is a neo-noir, a crime film whose downward spiral is a
black hole from which there is no escape. Scripted by Scott Smith, it
was based on his novel. It starts with a forlorn Bill Paxton explaining
in voiceover, "I was a happy man." Past tense. 
Hank (Paxton), his brother Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton, who is superb in
the role), and their friend Louis (Brent Briscoe) are in their truck on
a secluded road. It is the middle of winter and snow covering the fields
and the roads blends with the nondescript white sky. A fox crosses their
path and Louis and Jacob insist on stopping to track it down.
The three come across an old plane crash. The plane is covered in snow
and the pilot is long dead. Further exploration reveals a duffel bag
full of money, piles of stacks of hundred dollar bills. A quick debate
reveals only two options: report the money to the authorities, or split
the money three ways. 
Jacob and Louis, being a little dimmer than Hank, want to split the
money three ways and become instant millionaires. Hank sees that their
plan won't work if someone finds the plane and knows the money is
missing. He agrees to split the money, but only if they agree that
nobody collects a share until AFTER the plane is found. If the money is
missed, they can always turn it in or burn it. If nobody mentions the
money in connection with the plane, they will keep it.
Hank takes the money to his place for safe keeping and almost instantly,
the paranoia creeps into their lives. What about the footprints in the
fresh snow? Can Hank be trusted? Can they keep their stories straight?
The paranoia leads to mistakes, as it always does in this type of film.
The mistakes lead to attempted corrections, which in turn lead to more
mistakes. The downward spiral is as fascinating as it is foreboding.
Several factors add to the doomed, queasy feeling of this film. Danny
Elfman's amazing score should have been nominated for an Oscar. The
orchestra plays a sad, folksy tune, but the strings are about a
quarter-step out of tune, adding a gut-wrenching twang to the
soundtrack. The bleak, lifeless, wintery setting and cinematography are
reminiscent of FARGO. The omnipresence of crows presage death and
disease.
In addition, the characters are well-formed. Jacob and Louis are best
friends from high school. They haven't done much with their lives since
then. They are not too bright, a bit too greedy, and far too mistrustful
of each other to be likely to pull off their heist. Hank is a little
smarter, but he hasn't escaped the small, poor farming community he was
born in. All in all, they are a sad bunch, and perfect for this film.
With so many things done so well, you'd think this would be an excellent
film. But like PLEASANTVILLE, it crumbles under the pressure of critical
thought.
For one thing, Hank (the college graduate) and Jacob (his slow-witted
brother) are too completely different to be brothers. The gap in
intelligence between them cannot be explained by college attendance, as
the film suggests. The plot required most of the characters to be dumb,
but a smarter character was needed for contrast and leadership, and so
the college educated brother was introduced.
For another, the practical problems of spending hundred-dollar bills in
a small town was never brought up, even though other problems were
mentioned and dealt with. Perhaps the point was that none of them were
smart enough to think of it. Still, the movie should have addressed it.
I don't think it's too much to ask of screenwriter Smith to be one step
ahead of the audience. I was disappointed to have thought of something
that the characters and the film hadn't.
And finally, the film's great tragic ending -- the fate of the brothers
-- was not justified. After dozens of other problems were resolved with
great desperation and tenacity, the film's final solution should have
been even more desperate and tenacious. Barring that, it should have
been a great sigh of resignation. It was tragic and moving, but it was
also easy and premature.  
A Simple Plan is on many "ten best" lists, and I'm glad for it. I really
enjoyed the film, particularly the way it moved me and made me squirm.
But there were too many problems for it to be a really great film.

Title
Review for Summer of Sam (1999)
***1/2 (out of 4) NOTE: SUMMER OF SAM IS RATED R FOR LOTS OF SEX AND A
LITTLE GORE, SOME OF WHICH WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THIS REVIEW. READ AT
YOUR OWN RISK. 
When it comes to evoking a time and place, nobody is better than Spike
Lee. In DO THE RIGHT THING, he created an entire neighborhood and a
memorable, palpable couple of days. In SUMMER OF SAM, Lee does it again.
Moreover, the interesting racial and ethical gray areas that spangled DO
THE RIGHT THING, add texture to this movie.
SUMMER OF SAM is set in the Bronx, New York, in the summer of 1977, one
of the hottest summers on record. It was also the summer that the
so-called "Son of Sam" serial killer was on the loose. Fear of the
serial killer (so the movie says) forever defines that time and place.
Lee is often an impressionist filmmaker. He'll try to capture a moment
in time. Small details, like a "Dead End" sign, or a heat wave, or a
serial killer in the headlines really aren't that important to the plot,
but are essential to definition of time and place. And even WITHIN the
movie, Lee highlights a particular moment with an oddly-chosen image
(like when he shows the space BETWEEN two characters, rather than the
characters themselves) or with expressionistic lighting and effects
(i.e., effects that reflects the characters' inner moods, rather than
external reality).
So although the Son of Sam killer (now know to be David Berkowitz,
played by Michael Badalucco) is in this movie, his role is small. This
is not a horror movie about a serial killer. Rather, it is an ensemble
drama. The serial killings touch the lives of the characters, but only
indirectly as future memories.
The movie's center is Vinnie (John Leguizamo, proving himself to be a
talented actor), a small-time hairdresser. Vinnie is married to Dionna
(Mira Sorvino) and the two make a handsome couple.
Their sex life is busy, but troubled. Vinnie likes all kinds of sex, but
he believes that he can only have "normal" sex with his wife. She, on
the other hand, would like to please him however she can, and so both of
them end up unsatisfied and frustrated.
In many movies, dialogue about, and depiction of their sex life would be
gratuitous, but in SUMMER OF SAM, it really drives the characters' words
and actions. Without it, we wouldn't know who the characters are or why
their relationship is as troubled as it is.
Vinnie also hangs around with his old buddies from the neighborhood.
Joey (Michael Rispoli) and his three pals can almost always be found at
the dead end, peddling drugs and discussing the issues of the day. Their
machismo makes for some of the movie's funniest conversations. Everyone
has to be the smartest and the loudest, which sometimes makes for a
conversation where everyone is talking and nobody is listening. It's a
bit of insightful writing and directing by Lee.
Vinnie's friend Richie re-emerges into the neighborhood with a Sid
Vicious hairdo, a British-flag t-shirt, and an English-punk accent. Once
they recognize him, Richie is still allowed to be "one of the guys," but
just barely. Vinnie still likes him because they go way back. Joey's
gang tolerates him because he's a paying customer.
But his appearances aren't all that has changed (or should I say
emerged?). When Richie needs money, he dances at a gay strip bar, then
gets a few extra "tips" back stage. He has a girlfriend, but their
relationship is more platonic than she'd like.
So when Joey's gang finds out about Richie's homosexuality, (added to
his weird behavior & appearance) they decide that he must be the Son of
Sam killer. One night they drive over to the punk club where they think
he'll be.
The contrast between the cultures is huge: four Italian street toughs
among a club full of pierced, mohawked, leathered punks. Perhaps the
epitome of that contrast is the image of Vinnie in his disco best,
talking over old times with Richie in his new blond mohawk. The
conversation soon becomes an argument, Vinnie accusing Richie of having
changed so much and Richie saying he's just being himself. Both of them
are as right and as honest as they've been in the whole movie. Yet their
perspectives are so different that it seems like they're just fighting.
Neither can see the other's point of view, which really sums up the
tragedy of the whole Jocks-vs.-Goths war.
In a classic enactment of that war, Joey's gang forms a posse to go take
care of Richie, once and for all. They've learned he's at home tonight,
and they're off to make him pay. For a moment, it seems like they know
what they're doing is wrong. They hesitate. Their revenge requires some
moral legitimacy, so they decide to make Vinnie come along and be a part
of their mob. Vinnie is so messed up from problems with his wife and
from alcohol and drugs that he gives in to their pressure.
The dreadful march of the vigilantes is tensely intercut with the
triumphant capture of the real Son of Sam killer. The appropriately
grave score (from Terrence Blanchard) and well-chosen song (The Who's
WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN) bring the movie to its grim, yet hopeful close.
Spike Lee is a great director. He is one of the best when it comes to
pulling great performances from a large cast, and when it comes to
creating a real, palpable impression of a moment. He has made his share
of bad movies, but when he's on his mark, he is very good. SUMMER OF SAM
will surely be remembered among the best.

Review for That Old Feeling (1997)
*1/2 (out of 4) NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS ONE OR TWO OF THOSE WORDS
SOME PEOPLE GET UPSET OVER. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy, That Old Feeling
is embarrassing to sit through.
Bette Midler and Dennis Farina play Lilly and Dan, Actress and Author,
once married, now violently divorced, and back together one last time
for their daughter Molly's (Paula Marshall) wedding. Lilly and Dan hate
each other passionately -- so passionately that they have sex at the
wedding and fall in love again.
Each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the
other. Molly, married now only 24 hours, runs off in search of her
irresponsible parents while her husband Keith (Jamie Denton) tries to
console the abandoned spouses.
In Molly's search for her parents, she somehow falls in love with
Lilly's paparazzo Joey (Danny Nucci). Meanwhile, the newlywed Keith ends
up consoling Dan's wife Rowena (Gail O'Grady) in bed.
The audience I saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery
was hilarious. I'm no Dan Quayle, but I thought it was a bit creepy. The
message seemed to be "ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and
have fun fucking who you wish." "Family values" aside, there's something
cruel about all this.
Perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy, but the
movie is a romantic comedy. We are supposed to be ROOTING for these
creeps.
Reiner and screenwriter Leslie Dixon tried to make it easier on us by
making the victims unlikeable. Lilly's husband is a new-age flake who
rambles about "emotional valet parking," so we can write him off as
irrelevant. Dan's wife is vain, manipulative, and jealous so we can
write her off as a bitch. Molly's husband is a career-conscious,
self-centered Republican politician who thinks she's too fat (and just
for good measure, he also fucked Dan's wife), so we can write him off as
a prick. Everyone else falls in love.
But still, that somehow doesn't justify the actions of the movie's main
characters. "He's a prick" or "she's a bitch" is no defense.
The movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog -- often during heated
arguments -- and by above-average performances by Midler and Farina
(breaking out of his character-actor mold).
Other than that, it's a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard
gimmick.

Review for Fight Club (1999)
***1/2 (out of 4) "If you could fight one celebrity, who would you
fight?" That's what Edward Norton asks of Brad Pitt.
Their two perfect answers? Ernest Hemingway and William Shatner. Both
Hemingway and Shatner (as Captain Kirk) fought, almost as a Zen-like
expression of being human. That focus, that concentration of reality, is
what Fight Club is all about (although there's more to it than meets the
eye).
FIGHT CLUB's long setup is the funniest stuff Fincher has ever directed,
and it hits its corporate, materialistic target with better accuracy
than Mike Judge's OFFICE SPACE. 
Norton plays a cube-dweller/business traveler. His job, he narrates, is
to apply The Formula. Working for a major car maker, he weighs the cost
of a manufacturer's recall against the cost of a lawsuit. The lack of a
human element in the equation is turning him off his job.
He can't sleep nights and his doctor refuses to prescribe pills. Taking
an offhand remark seriously, he goes to a testicular cancer support
group and cries in the arms of Bob (Meat Loaf). That night, he sleeps. 
Crying at support groups becomes his sole means of emotional outlet, and
his sole cure for insomnia. He joins every support group he can find.
The details of this setup are hilarious, and the pacing is rapid-fire.
It's one of the funniest half-hours in any movie this year.
The movie changes tone and tempo a little when Brad Pitt is introduced.
The two meet on a plane and share their thoughts on the single-serving
lifestyle. They amiably trade business cards and go their separate ways. 
Norton arrives home from the airport to discover that his apartment has
been blown to bits. All his perfect furniture lies charred and
smoldering out front. He calls the only phone number he has --Pitt's.
The two get drunk together and agree that Norton has to stay with Pitt.
On their way out of the bar, Pitt insists that Norton hit him as hard as
he can. It is exhilarating for both of them, so they fight some more in
the parking lot. Eventually, they break it up and stagger to Pitt's flop
house to lick their wounds.
Fistfights become better than crying for Norton's insomnia. The two main
characters start fighting behind that same bar every week. Soon, a few
other guys join in and the whole endeavor is given a name: Fight Club.
Pitt takes Fight Club further. There's now a Tuesday and a Thursday
group that Pitt formed without Norton's knowing. It becomes so popular
that Norton begins to worry. Meanwhile, Pitt seems to relish the idea of
forming his own loyal little army. 
 The tone of the movie now changes drastically. What was funny has gone
too far. Norton wants to apply the brakes but Pitt won't stop. In fact,
he's accelerating, and now he even has a political agenda. In place of a
good laugh, the movie now gives us a dose of tension and horror.
Although David Ansen of Newsweek was on to something when he called it a
"mess," presumably referring to the multiple shifts in style and tone,
it really didn't seem to hurt the movie a bit. FIGHT CLUB is comedy,
action, horror/thriller, and eventually, romance, but the plot and
characters drive the transitions. Norton's dissatisfaction is funny, but
what helps cure it naturally leads to the action segment. Letting the
action escalate to extremes leads naturally to the horror/thriller
stage, and so on. So even if it seems "a mess," it still holds together
well.
FIGHT CLUB is great looking. That's not surprising coming from Fincher,
who has directed only solidly-stylized movies(SEVEN and THE GAME). The
opening sequence is a little like the great solar-system pull-back in
Contact, only this time, the "camera" pulls out of neurons and synapses
before coming out of a pore in Edward Norton's face. Later sequences
make great use of new camera/computer techniques that tightly control
the motion and speed of the images and motion on screen.
Thematically, FIGHT CLUB compares well to another recent "modern
malaise" movie: AMERICAN BEAUTY.
In AMERICAN BEAUTY, Kevin Spacey gives up on his pretty and
"successful," but unfulfilling life. He regresses to adolescence and
finds vivacious existence in drugs, cheerleaders, and muscle cars. In
FIGHT CLUB, Norton is suffering from the same vague dissatisfaction, and
finds solace in the reality of pain and the exhilaration of
physicalizing his weekly routine. (Both characters have strikingly
similar scenes in which they solve their "day job" problem.)
I really liked FIGHT CLUB and foundit lacking in almost no areas. The
acting was very good, the production looked great, and the story was
always interesting and entertaining.
Perhaps the biggest complaint is that it made the mistake every
"on-the-lam" movie makes: it overestimates the public's sympathy for the
anti-hero. A movie audience can sympathize with an on-screen rogue who
has the right sort of charm, but that just doesn't happen outside of a
movie. In the case of FIGHT CLUB, screenwriter Jim Uhls assumes that
LOTS of men would be interesting in joining Pitt's fistfighting army,
and I think he's wrong. There's one scene where it is particularly
distracting, which I can't mention without giving something away. Write
to me if you want to know.
But any reservations about the movie are more than made up for by its
wit, its energy, and its wonderful attention to detail. Fincher packed a
lot of stuff into FIGHT CLUB, and maybe that makes it a mess. I prefer
to call it "getting your money's worth."

Review for Lost Highway (1997)
*** (out of 4) LOST HIGHWAY uses a technique that other films have used
before; namely it starts and ends in the same place. But LOST HIGHWAY is
not a loop; it is a Moebius strip, turning itself inside out before
coming back to the beginning.=20
One part of the story involves a man who kills his wife (Bill Pullman
and Patricia Arquette); the other part of the story involves a young kid
of a mechanic who gets caught up with a powerful mobster and his moll
(Balthazar Getty, Robert Loggia, and Patricia Arquette, again).=20
Much debate has raged over the "plot" of this movie and every critic I
have read so far has dismissed the connection between the stories as
unsolvable. Later in the review I propose a solution to the story, as
suggested by my dear sister.=20
Realizing before I went that I might not "get" the movie, I tried to
keep an open mind while watching it. The first thing that struck me was
that the characters were two dimensional. Pullman's character =97 Fred
Madison =97 lives in an expensive-looking house in what appears to be L.A.
His job? He's an avant-garde saxaphone player. His wife Renee apparently
does not work.=20
Forgive me for being cynical, but a saxophone player cannot make enough
to afford a $300,000 house, let alone support two people, at least not
without selling out. But then he wouldn't be avant-garde, would he?=20
Okay. I can forgive the movie some 2-D characters. In fact, the dry,
crisp 2-D cops were an amusing touch to the movie. I understood that the
movie was not about characters but about mystery. There is one character
who, though he may be 2-D, is very interesting. He is Mystery Man
(Robert Blake) and he is extremely creepy. He has an evil intensity
about him and somehow, he is part of the key to the connection between
the two stories.=20
As I continued to watch I kept noticing how great the cinematography
was. When movies switched from mostly black & white to mostly color, one
of the greatest losses was the richness, depth, and texture of shadows.
Bruce Kawin says in HOW MOVIES WORK, "In color, shadows are in danger of
being washed out or of appearing as patches of muted color." LOST
HIGHWAY has neither problem. Lynch and cinematographer Peter Deming have
taken control of light and created a film with the range of color and
the depth of black & white.=20
A few examples spring to mind. Early in the film, Fred walks away from
the camera down a dark hallway into the bathroom. He eventually
disappears into the blackness of the screen. The shots of the highway at
night make such a good use of black that you can't tell where theater
ends and the screen begins. When the cops are searching the Madison
home, the orange walls show not muted tones of color, but clearly
defined shadows.=20
As withCRASH, the story doesn't make a lot of sense by itself and some
examination of the tone and emotion is required to appreciate what is
happening. The tone of LOST HIGHWAY is set, not with music, like CRASH,
but with the visual elements of colors, textures, and shadows. The tone
of LOST HIGHWAY is mysterious, vaguely ominous, and frightening by means
of the unknown.=20
Without much in the way of a story, I still recommend this movie for its
tone and its look. And if you like a good mystery, see the movie and try
to piece it all together. I felt it wasn't worth the effort to try to
put it together when nobody has come up with an "answer."=20
Having said that, let me present my sister's interpretation of the
"plot." If you think she's got something here, or if you know why she
can't be right, please email me your comments. I'll publish any
responses I get on my page (http://net.indra.com/~mmapes). Here's the
the theory of how the story works in a literal chronology.=20
The literal story starts when Renee/Alice (she's the same person) is
forced to strip for Mr. Eddy at gunpoint. She realizes she likes it and
gets sucked into the world of pornography and violence. Notice that she
and Mr. Eddy are making out at a party, watching a "death porn" film.=20
She is later introduced to Pete (the young mechanic), whom she seduces,
uses, and kills. She kills him when they both arrive at the burning
beach house with Mystery Man. Mystery Man represents murderousness; he
embodies the ability to commit murder ("I don't go where I'm not
invited").=20
Alice becomes Renee, seduces Fred, and marries him. She says the same
line to him that she said to Pete (something about getting a job; "just
a job" at a certain club). Fred looks into this (though not on screen)
and learns that his wife is not only a porn star, but that she is a
monster who uses men, seduces them, and kills them. In a way, Fred is a
victim, just like his Moebius-strip counterpart Pete. But Fred catches
on to her game and sets out to murder his monster of a wife (he meets
the Mystery Man at the party; he is ready to commit murder). He carries
out his deed and is sentenced to death.=20
At the end of the movie (not the timeline) Fred speaks in the intercom
TO RENEE that Dick Laurent is dead. He's really saying: "I'm on to you;
I know what you are and I have put a stop to it."=20
I can think of one unanswered question if this is the "solution"; when
did he kill his wife, relative to when he killed Mr. Eddie/Dick Laurent?
Still, this could be a small detail in the larger picture. Also, other
stylistic elements must be discarded as red herrings, but I think she's
on to something here.=20

Title
Review for Dark City (1998)
***1/2 (out of 4) There seem to be two reactions to DARK CITY. You either
love it or you are unimpressed. Count me as a "love it." 
As good as THE CROW and SPAWN are, DARK CITY is better. Where the former two
have a specific comic-book following, the latter is an original work with
the potential for broader appeal. It has a similar look to the others, but
DARK CITY is much more thoughtful and much less violent. 
Not clever or complex, the story is still fascinating, like a selection from
the Twilight Zone. A man (Rufus Sewell) is awakened in his bathtub by a man
with a syringe. Surprised, the attacker runs off. The dazed man gets out of
the tub and finds a woman's body in the room. A mysterious caller warns him
to leave the apartment immediately, so he packs some clothes and leaves,
never sure why he's leaving or what he's fleeing. 
Ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the
dark city, hounding him like figures in a nightmare. An odd blast of
willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough
to check his I.D. The amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his
name is John Murdoch. Now if only he could remember the rest of his life.... 
DARK CITY is good on many levels. First, the look of the movie is excellent.
Give credit to production designers George Liddle and Patrick Tatopolous for
creating a coherent look from diverse elements. There are visual elements
from the American 1920s-60s, mixed with Dickens-era urban industrial
elements. It is all pulled together in a sad, dark look reminiscent of the
diner in Edward Hopper's painting, NIGHTHAWKS. 
Proyas' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film's
world (for not only does the AUDIENCE see the city a model, but so do the
ghouls). The look is like a cross between Tim Burton's BATMAN and the bleak
animation of the Brothers Quay. 
Second, the editing of the film is good. The pacing is on track, and the
plot is revealed, the "amnesia" explained, in satisfying increments. Also,
the stylized editing WITHIN each scene gives the movie a tense, caffeinated
look. 
Third, the special effects are well used. They look good, but more
importantly, the right effects are used for the right job. One example
stands out in my mind: the coated figures who haunt the city can attack
telekinetically. A simple ripple effect is used. A more showy effect could
have been chosen, but then it would have just been gratuitous. Restraint was
shown where necessary, letting the more critical effects look more impressive. 
Finally, like GATTACA, DARK CITY spends a just a little effort striving for
mythical significance. Unlike GATTACA, the story is just open-ended and
non-literal enough to be successful. John Murdoch's recovery from amnesia is
tied to the passing of the night, and the hopeful coming of the dawn. His
struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all
mankind (at least in his world). When we finally see the big picture of the
movie's world, it is as mysterious as the Iroquois image of the world being
carried on the back of a giant turtle. 
A few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score
Roger Ebert gave, but I do strongly recommend it, for its look, its pace,
its story, and its timelessness.

Title
Review for Leggenda del pianista sull'oceano, La (1998)
***1/2 (out of 4) THE LEGEND OF 1900 is an unconventional, imaginative
fable about a man whose entire universe is a ship. 
The story is told by Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince), a sad and lonely guy
who's giving up his career as a musician. He tells the story as he sells
his trumpet to the man at the music shop.
The story begins after the passengers disembark in New York, on the
first day of the first month of the new century -- 1900, that is -- a
ship worker (Bill Nunn) finds a baby on the piano in the ship's lounge.
He names the boy 1900 (for short) and raises him in the boiler room of
the ship.
One day the boy is found playing the piano. He has a natural talent for
it, and so moves out of the boilers to the upper decks of the ship,
where he entertains the passengers.
The talent of 1900 (now played by Tim Roth) is enormous. He can play any
style of music, even from just a hummed scrap of a tune. One of his
favorite styles is jazz, and he earns a sterling reputation as a jazz
pianist. Some say he's even better than Jelly Roll Morton.
Jelly Roll (played with fierce pride by Clarence Williams) takes this
challenge seriously. Since 1900 refuses to set foot on land, Jelly Roll
books a trip across the Atlantic, just to meet this man -- and to put
him in his place. In one of the most memorable scenes, Jelly Roll and
1900 have a musical duel.
In another episode, 1900 comes as close as he ever will to falling in
love. As he plays a ballad for a new recording, he notices a girl on the
other side of the porthole. The song becomes his love for her.
Two of the best things about THE LEGEND OF 1900 are clear in these
scenes. The first is that, because the story is told AS A STORY, the
movie is allowed to take on an imaginative, slightly-exaggerated,
storybook feel. The exaggeration stops well short of zaniness. There is
merely enough to give the characters a larger-than-life charm. (That's
something Tornatore did well in CINEMA PARADISO, too)
The second is that Tornatore acknowledges that music is important to the
movie, and lets it play for a long time. This is worth mentioning
because a lot of directors don't show music scenes for very long 
they're hard to film in a way that's not boring. (Recall Jane Horrocks'
"evening" of music in LITTLE VOICE. It was compressed down to about 5
minutes of screen time, even though it was the film's whole RAISON
D'ETRE. A more recent example is the penultimate scene in MUSIC OF THE
HEART, where no composition gets more than about 30 seconds of screen
time.)
Ennio Morricone wrote most of the music for this movie, and he was the
perfect choice. Morricone's music often seems weird and unconventional
-- as though he had no formal training in how music is "supposed" to be.
(Think of the screamed and quacked voices in the theme from THE GOOD,
THE BAD, AND THE UGLY.) 1900's music isn't THAT far-out, but Morricone's
unconventional-yet-functional style is perfect for the character of
1900, who is self-taught and musically isolated.
The acting by Roth and Vince is impeccable. Although Roth's part was
smaller than it at first seems, he captured the shy, fragile charm of
1900. He wasn't listed in the music credits at the end, but he knew
enough piano to look like he was really doing it. And even though Vince
has acted in a dozen movies, he's never had a part this big. Vince has
darting eyes, which might seem a hindrance, but they add to the pathos
and sympathy of his character. 
One final trait of THE LEGEND OF 1900 is worth mentioning: the
cinematography by Lajos Koltai. A few scenes in particular are
noteworthy. One is the fluid, energetic photography of the great piano
duel. As I said, most filmmakers can't shoot music performances without
making them boring. Tornatore was able to make his performances last
longer by letting Koltai shoot some great stuff.
The other great-looking scene was of the first meeting between 1900 and
Max. Max was seasick and 1900 had the perfect cure. I won't say more,
except that the cinematography in this scene won me over completely.
Roger Ebert gave THE LEGEND OF 1900 a so-so review because he didn't
completely understand the character of 1900. I can't say I understood
him any better, but that's not what this movie was saying to me.

Title
Review for Liar Liar (1997)
*** (out of 4). LIAR LIAR is the funniest movie I have seen in a very
long time (A year? More?). It is Jim Carrey's funniest film role yet and
his funniest performance since the TV show IN LIVING COLOR.
Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur wrote some great comedy for Jim Carrey and
it should be noted that the material is funny without degenerating into
cheap jokes about human secretions and excretions. With that in mind,
this movie is as funny as the best work the Marx Brothers ever did, and
much more enjoyable than, say, DUMB AND DUMBER, BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD, or
even PRIVATE PARTS.
Jim Carrey plays Fletcher Reid, a lawyer who cannot lie for a whole day,
thanks to a magic wish by his son Max (Justin Cooper). Max lives with
his mother Audrey (Maura Tierney). When Fletcher and Max do see each
other, they love each other a lot. But Max easily tires of all the
broken promises from dad. So when dad skips Max's birthday party to
"work," Max lets loose with the birthday wish.
All of this is a relatively unnecessary setup for the real heart of the
movie, which is Jim Carrey's performance. In fact, the beginning and end
of the movie are about as unoriginal and clich'd as the worst
straight-to-video "family films." But this is the kind of movie sold on
the idea that film historian Bruce Kawin calls "high concept plus a
hook." The idea is easily summarized, and an interesting angle is chosen
from which to tell the story. The objective is not originality. The
objective is to get Jim Carrey in front of the camera in a funny
situation.
In that endeavor, LIAR LIAR succeeds wonderfully. I will refrain from
giving away any of the jokes -- I DETEST people who sit in theaters and
"predict" the lines they've read in reviews, especially in a comedy --
but I have a theory as to why Carrey is so funny.
Part of what makes great comedy is stripping a person down to their
core. John Cleese is so funny because the British are a stuffy, priggish
people. John Cleese looks, acts, and sounds British, but when all the
puffery is stripped away his sheer silliness is heightened. Jacques
Tati's MR. HULOT'S HOLIDAY is one of my favorite films ever. It is not
hilarious like LIAR LIAR but it is subtly funny in a way that makes it
endlessly watchable. It is funny because Mr. Hulot and all the other
guests at the resort are on holiday and they have left their inhibitions
at home. Each person can relax and be their true self at the holiday
resort. Each character is funny in their own way. Steve Martin is so
funny because his comic persona is naive. Martin walks on stage with an
arrow through his head and doesn't realize it for three or four minutes.
He tells you the way to make a million dollars is, first, to get a
million dollars . . .
Likewise, in LIAR LIAR, Carrey plays an inconsiderate prick who is
successful in part because of how well he tells little white lies. When
that outer shell is removed, his true nature shows through and it is
hilarious.
LIAR LIAR is a big step for Carrey as an actor. Okay, he had to do
slightly more acting in THE CABLE GUY than he did in the ACE VENTURAs or
in DUMB AND DUMBER, but in LIAR LIAR, his character is immediately
likeable, and not just because of the comedy. His love for his son looks
genuine. He and his son share a screen chemistry (if I may use that term
without being accused of NAMBLA sympathies) that is genuine and
heartwarming (in that straight-to-video "family film" kind of way).
Carrey is not a great actor, but he's not bad when called upon.
I hope Carrey is able to follow up with more great comedy like this.
Good comedies are hard to come by. Just check your local video store and
prove it to yourself. All the great films are docudramas, action epics,
or space sagas. Comedies come and go and are often forgotten as soon as
the credits roll. It's hard to sustain the humor for two hours and leave
the audience calling for more. Jim Carrey has that gift and it was put
to excellent use in LIAR LIAR.

Review for Anna and the King (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) ANNA AND THE KING is a joy to sit through. The lush,
exotic setting; a stirring performance from Jodie Foster; and a charming
Chow Yun-Fat make the two and a half hours drift by. One could easily
enjoy an afternoon at this movie.
But ANNA AND THE KING is full of problems, mostly coming from the script
of Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes. There are gratuitous explosions,
edits, subplots, and songs, not to mention a muddled message and fuzzy
focus.
The movie starts in Bangkok in 1862, just as Anna Leonowens is to
arrive. The British schoolteacher is here to teach King Mongkut's
children in the ways of the West. It's the story told in THE KING AND I,
and it's based on the diaries of Leonowens.
My own prejudiced notions say that this story should be about the
culture clash between Siam and Britain, and more to the point, the way
this clash works its way into a personal relationship.
For a while, this is exactly the focus of the movie. Anna settles in to
the new culture without giving up her Britishness. Her bold, cocky ways
make the Siamese bristle, but she remains proud and stoic. Because he
invited Anna, King Mongkut knows he should not restrain her. (He quickly
learns he CANNOT restrain her). Instead, he watches her efforts with
charmed amusement.
On the other hand, Anna truly IS arrogant, at one point stating
unquestionably that "The ways of England are the ways of the world."
Their relationship is flirtatious at first. Their mutual affection
reaches its peak at a great Western-style dinner party, where Anna and
Mongkut dance.
Afterwards, Mongkut presents Anna with a generous gift -- an elaborate
gold ring. She of course refuses the gift, which is far too great a
token. It represents a new level of seriousness in their relationship
where Anna will not go.
Her refusal of the king's gift casts an ugly light on Anna. The king no
longer sees her as charming, but as an arrogant, ungrateful guest, a
teacher who needs to be taught a lesson.
The first half of the movie works very well. The chemistry between
Foster and Chow is enjoyable and believable. The themes of power,
propriety, and respect are played out in every conversation. But the
movie loses its focus and intensity. It becomes less about cultures and
relationships and more about conflict and resolution.
Little problems abound, but worst of all are the two subplots that
hijack center stage. One is of a young couple's forbidden love, the
other is of a military coup. Both ostensibly tie in with the main
characters' relationship. But they are so prominent and distracting that
you forget whose movie this is.
The movie loses credibility in its handling of the subplot of the
lovers. Mongkut tells Anna that their cultures differ in every respect 
including love. The editor (Roger Bondelli) makes a point by immediately
cutting to the two lovers who are as Western as Romeo and Juliet. In
other words, the movie is choosing sides. It says that Mongkut is wrong
about love and that the Western way of love is correct. A movie about
culture clashes needs to be more open-minded than this.
It does even worse in its handling of the military coup. What started
out as a thoughtful movie about a relationship (a chick flick) now has
stunts, plan-blabbing villains, and even a gratuitous explosion (a guy
flick). All the while Anna (remember her?) is nowhere to be found. At
this point, the entire subplot is irrelevant. The movie's main
relationship has run its course. The 20 minutes it takes to follow the
"guy flick" plot should have simply been cut.
If there is a single problem that encapsulates all of the little
problems, it is that the movie panders. An explosion for the guys, Romeo
and Juliet for the gals, some cute children for the parents, and a pop
song over the credits for the teens. There's no mystery as to why the
movie panders: it's a big-budget studio picture with a Christmas
release. It bends over backwards to please all, which it can only do if
it is spineless.
I can't decide if the great-looking spectacle was enough to outweigh the
pandering plot. What I am sure of is that this movie could have been so
much more.

Title
Review for Wedding Singer, The (1998)
*** (out of 4) The thing about Adam Sandler is, his heart is in the right
place. 
For example, in HAPPY GILMORE, Sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat
a self-confident jerk of a pro. If the star were any other comic, that would
be enough motivation to drive the movie, but with Sandler, the rookie also
wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house. 
That extra motive doesn't make HAPPY GILMORE a funnier movie. It doesn't
really add any genuine emotional depth, either. In fact, the motive is
almost totally irrelevant to the movie. But Sandler's philosophy seems to
be, if it's a token gesture, why not make it a nice gesture? That is
endlessly refreshing. 
In THE WEDDING SINGER, Sandler is right on track. The fact that he's a
wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story. What KIND of a
wedding singer he is is even less important. David Spade could have filled
the role with cynicism and sarcasm. He could make fun of the fat, ugly, or
embarrassing people he meets at weddings, and the story would be intact. 
But Sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character. He seems to
really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his
own family. Robbie Hart (Sandler) doesn't just SING at weddings; he also
gets the loners to join in and have fun, and he smooths it over when someone
does something embarrassing. He is exactly the man you would want at your
wedding. 
The day comes when Robbie has his own wedding, and he is stood up by his
heavy-metal bride (the movie is set in 1985). Robbie takes it hard. He
doesn't sleep, he doesn't eat, and he gets punched out at work when he sings
"Love Stinks" at a wedding. Julia (Drew Barrymore), who waitresses all the
weddings in town, gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to. 
Eventually, Robbie starts rebounding toward Julia. He really likes her, but
she's engaged. Her fiancé is a self-confident jerk (do I see a trend - nope,
just a formula) who doesn't deserve her, but Robbie is too depressed to
fight for her hand. Julia seems to like Robbie too, but she can't leave her
seemingly safe and stable fiancé for the off-chance that Robbie might be
serious about her. 
You know the story. You've seen it a million times before. There's always a
new way to tell it, with new lovers, new chemistry, and new details, but
it's the same story. And sometimes, it works. 
First of all, the chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore is effective.
Actually, it's not so much the chemistry BETWEEN the two as it is each one's
own romantic tension. Sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a
jilted man, struck with an unattainable love. Barrymore is charming as the
girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with. Sparks don't
fly when they kiss, but they both seem right for each other. 
Second, their love is mature. They are not driven by passionate sexual
attraction - they're a cute couple, but neither Sandler nor Barrymore is
centerfold material. Instead, they are both looking for someone meaningful,
someone to settle down with, someone to grow old with. At a wedding, Robbie
comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while Julia sits by. The repulsing
situation is taken in stride, as if the two were already parents, caring for
their sick child. 
The 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie. Other
critics liked this movie in part because of the '80s soundtrack. 
Often, the music and references felt forced. For example, Robbie tells his
ex-fiancé to "get out of my Van Halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and
they break up." (Ha ha ha. Get it? David Lee Roth DID leave Van Halen!) Or
how about when Sammy (Allen Covert), Robbie's chauffeur friend, shows up at
a party wearing a Michael Jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver
glove. (That's EXACTLY what MJ used to wear ALL THE TIME!). 
Unfortunately, making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to
be rewarding. 
That's not to say the movie isn't funny. Screenwriter Tim Herlihy has
written for Sandler before (BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE), and the two
make a good combination. Herlihy knows what sort of jokes Sandler is good at
and has tailored the script to his straight-faced, smart-aleck style.  
Let's hope Herlihy and Sandler stick together for a few more projects
because this movie really won me over. With Barrymore's charm and Sandler's
heart, it was hard to go wrong.

Title
Review for Love Stinks (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) LOVE STINKS is the Antichrist of romantic comedies.
It's a "guy" movie, but it follows some of the rules of chick flicks.
What it does with them, though, is push them through a bitter, black
filter. The result is either an incomprehensible mess, or revenge for
FIRST WIVES' CLUB, depending on your point of view.
I am ashamed to admit that I thought this movie was funny. Immediately
after it was over, my wife said she thought it deserved the lowest
rating possible, and I overheard another woman on the phone tell a
friend that it was "not very good." On the other hand, several men in
the theater hooted at all the right moments, and I found myself laughing
along with them.
Why be ashamed to laugh at a comedy? Why do men and women react
differently? Because the "villain" (Chelsea, played by Bridgette Wilson)
is the embodiment of a stereotype: a matrimony-obsessed, man-trapping
woman. I feel guilty because I'm a sensitive man who should be above
such an immature view of women. (But then I also like Beavis and
Butt-Head, so I guess I'm not as sensitive or mature as I thought.)
Chelsea is a neurotic FEMME FATALE who aims to either marry Seth (French
Stewart) or kill him trying. Think of Glenn Close in BASIC INSTINCT, but
less psychotic and more comedic, and you'll start to get an idea of who
she is. Admittedly, she's not a very well-rounded character. She's more
a situation than a person.
Seth is a sitcom writer living in a bachelor-pad wasteland. He's not
looking for a new girlfriend, but when he sees Chelsea, he becomes
infatuated. He dumps his current girlfriend to go out with the new one.
Chelsea is a decorator and "professional bridesmaid," as she likes to
say (they met at a friend's wedding). But as soon as she's in Seth's
life, she gives it all up to be his personal decorator and stay-at-home
girlfriend.
The movie follows their progress as a couple, through the tumultuous
saying of "I love you" to talking about children. Through bickering and
fighting to serious discussions about marriage. Through it all (and with
the help of the narrator), you can see the subtle manipulative
implementation of Chelsea's scheme to win Seth's hand.
Eventually, Seth decides he'd rather not be with Chelsea. But somehow,
she manages to keep him living under the same roof. Pretty soon they are
engaged - in an all-out War of the Roses. (God help me for saying it,
but this movie actually has a funny fart joke.)
But in spite of my amusement, I will not recommend it. Some of the
bigger problems are that Seth and Chelsea's friends (Tyra Banks, Bill
Bellamy) are too similar and badly developed. They could have provided
some sort of grounded contrast to the exaggerated love/hate. Instead,
they are almost exact duplicates of the main couple. Also, some of the
jokes are uninspired and cheap, like Seth's fascination with Elvis, or
Chelsea's devotion to her cat. Worst of all is the utter
two-dimensionality of most of the characters, including all of the
women.
LOVE STINKS fills a niche that is so far pretty empty. It's an inverted
chick-flick. It's a romantic comedy for cynical men. That probably makes
it dumber and meaner than a lot of other movies. If you go, don't laugh.
And if you laugh, don't say I sent you.

Title
Review for Game, The (1997)
*** (out of 4) THE GAME is an exciting, tense mystery, but I suspect it
won't stand the test of time. Like THE CRYING GAME, half the fun is
seeing the movie before you know how it ends. 
Millionaire investor Nicholas Van Orten (Michael Douglas) receives a
birthday gift certificate from his uncultured brother Conrad (Sean
Penn). The certificate is good for a Game at a company called CRS.
Conrad will not explain the Game except to promise that it will change
Nicholas's life. Nicholas, who is too busy for such nonsense, tucks away
the certificate and abruptly ends their lunch. 
A few days later, Nicholas finds himself in the same building as CRS.
Having herard some intriguing word of mouth about the Game, he stops in
to ask a few questions. 
The "few questions" turns into an application to play the Game, which
drags on into hours and hours of psychological and physical testing
(which Michael Douglas' character would have walked out on, had not the
plot required that he stay). 
Once the Game has begun, Nicholas still doesn't know what the game is,
but he gets the idea one night when he goes home . . . . 
Obviously mysterious things begin to happen to Nicholas, which he
correctly identifies as being rigged by CRS. But fewer and fewer obvious
mysteries occur as more and more coincidences and accidents (?) Happen.
Without knowing beforehand, it is impossible to be sure which theory is
correct. 
Congratulations should go to Fincher and screenwriters John D. Brancato
and Michael Ferris. Tension and suspense in movies are relatively easy
to achieve, but inventing a satisfying ending is not. THE GAME avoids
that pitfall. Without revealing the specifics of the ending, I can say
only that it felt right. With 20/20 hindsight I can see that no other
ending would have worked as well (especially in light of my theories set
forth at the end of this review). 
On top of a satisfying story line, the movie had lots else going for it.
One thing is director David Fincher. Looking at his three big features
(ALIEN3, SEVEN, and this one), it is apparent that Fincher has a great
eye for how his films will look in the theater. He uses the blacks of
night and shadow (and luxury cars) to great effect, merging the black on
the screen with the darkness of the theater. One never knows when or
where something may pop up from the black patches of the screen. 
Also, the music was very good. It set the mood but it was not
overbearing. At the end when Nicholas is embraced by the black bag, the
music could have triumphantly swelled, which would have been utterly
inappropriate. Instead, the music warmly welcomed Nicholas home, which
was a more creative and appropriate tone. I find that lately, when I
like the score to a movie, Howard Shore is inevitably the composer - as
he is here. (His score for COP LAND was great and solemn, and the CRASH
soundtrack was so outstanding that I bought the CD). 
Still, the movie is not perfect. When the paranoia and tension are
working, THE GAME is a nail-biter. But that pace is hard to sustain for
a long time and there are gaps where the action seems to stagnate. Also,
there is a lot of visual complexity to THE GAME which almost calls for a
second viewing. But because the movie is so gimmick-oriented, it doesn't
seem to welcome a repeat audience. 
Finally, THE GAME is an interesting study because it works as a metaphor
for moviegoing. Both Nicholas' Game and our moviegoing seem strange at
first. We have better things to do than to waste our time on some
frivolous fantasy. Some good word of mouth usually has to draw us in. 
When Nick applies for the Game, and we go to the moves, we are aware,
for a time, that we are choosing to play along. For Nicholas, the
can't-miss-it clown in the driveway is a fascinating development, but
it's obviously part of the Game. For us, maybe we haven't totally
settled in yet. The popcorn isn't finished or the latecomers are still
walking down the aisles. We know we're at the movies. But when Nick's
Game really gets interesting is when he's not sure that it IS a game.
Likewise, a good movie can draw us in make us forget about or own
"reality" for a while. If Nick's Game had ended differently, the
metaphor would be broken, but because it ended how it did, it makes a
very nice metaphor for the moviegoing experience. 
Taking the metaphor to another level, the party at the end of the movie
was Oscar night; the employees of CRS were really the filmmakers in
Hollywood, congratulating each other, comparing notes from the year, and
partying big. 
A good mystery movie is satisfying but it can never be great. That's
because nobody wants to see it a second time. Once you know how it ends,
a second viewing just isn't that interesting. That's too bad in this
case, because there's a lot to be gleaned from this movie.

Title
Review for Mask of Zorro, The (1998)
** (out of 4) Lots of overacting. Lots of clichés. Lots of fun. 
Two out of three ain't good. In school, it'll earn you a D. 
Anthony Hopkins plays the aging masked avenger in this perennially remade
movie. Hoping to draw Zorro out of hiding, the villainous governor Don
Rafael (Stuart Wilson) has chosen three peasants at random to be hanged. His
plot works. Zorro arrives to free the peasants. But Rafael's trap is not
quick enough or strong enough to hold this hero. Setting the overblown,
clichéd tone of the movie, Zorro ascends a staircase in front of the setting
sun and poses, yes, poses for the cheering masses. 
Later that evening, Don Diego (Zorro's alter ego) comes home, through his
unnecessarily Bat-Cave-like secret passageways, to his loving wife and
infant daughter. His wife has been worried about his dangerous heroics, and
she urges him to hang up his sword. He admits he's getting too old for this
work, so he promises he'll quit. 
Before they can celebrate his retirement, Don Rafael shows up with his
militia looking for Zorro. A wound from the day's battle gives away Diego's
secret identity. Rafael's man kills Diego's wife while Rafael throws him in
prison and carries away his beautiful daughter. 
Twenty years later, we are introduced to two thieves, brothers from the same
village as Diego. One is killed by the zealous Captain Love (Matthew
Letscher), and the other, Alejandro (Antonio Banderas), vows revenge.
Alejandro is falling-down drunk when he next sees the captain, but he cannot
let the opportunity for revenge slip by. He's about to charge when, out of
nowhere, Diego disarms him. 
Diego, who has escaped from prison, recognizes Alejandro's potential. He
sees an opportunity to pass the mask and sword to the next generation, so he
gets Alejandro sobered up and takes him under his wing. 
Coincidentally, the villain Rafael is returning from Spain after twenty
years away. Even more coincidentally, he gets involved in an illegal
land-grab scheme with the aid of Captain Love. 
Two heroes. Two villains. Two noble opportunities for revenge. I bet you can
guess how it all ends. 
Clearly, this film is meant to be a melodrama. Love, villainy, and honor are
all exaggerated. But melodrama is hard to pull off. TITANIC did it fairly
well, but even it carried the melodrama too far, in the inhuman callousness
of its villain. Needless to say, THE MASK OF ZORRO is no TITANIC. In this
film, the melodrama is often eyeball-rolling ridiculous, like Zorro posing
in front of the sunset, or Rafael's random execution of peasants. 
In addition, the movie has cartoonish set pieces which, funny as they may
be, make the movie a lot less consistent. (Think of Yosemite Sam when you
watch the film and you'll see what I mean.) Campbell knows that he's
directing a "summer blockbuster" and doesn't even try to make a solid movie.
Instead, he just goes for obligatory skits, loosely held together by the
Zorro story. 
That's not to say the movie can't be fun, but it will require that you check
your brain with the usher. Perhaps if I had known this beforehand, I could
have enjoyed it more. 
Some of these skits actually won me over. Anytime there was a swordfight, it
was worth watching. Anytime a horse was on screen, it was worth watching
(there were some very good stunts). Any time Banderas was allowed to pour on
the charm, it was worth watching. Add this all up and you have a fair amount
of screen time. 
But you don't have 136 minutes. What's left is enough time to notice, and
ponder, several of the movie's faults. 
Ordinarily I wouldn't mention set design unless it was good, but even in
this motley patchwork of a movie, it stuck out like a sore thumb. As stated
above, Diego has secret Batman tunnels in his mansion. It is an unimportant
detail, and it should have been left out. It made Hopkins look silly and it
didn't add to the character's depth. All it accomplished was to draw
attention to the bad set design. 
The other instance that jumped out was near the end of the film, when
hundreds of peasant miners are locked in wooden cages that appear to be
recycled from WATERWORLD. The plot tells us that these cages were built for
a one-time use, on a limited budget, by near-slave labor, yet these
"makeshift" cages have the look of professionally built Hollywood sets. This
might not have been so noticeable had not the camera and plot kept focusing
our attention on them. 
The screenplay has problems too. One problem is the patchwork makeup of the
film - six writers contributed to the screenplay (along with a seventh
uncredited writer, according to the IMDB). One moment the movie is a comedy,
the next it is a noble adventure. There's no reason it can't be both, but
usually the mix is not so random or haphazard. 
Another script problem is the way the characters were written. Zorro is
supposed to be a hero for the people. Instead, both Zorros are extremely
self-centered. This is particularly clear at the end. Hundreds of doomed
peasants fill the well-built cages, but instead of freeing them, both Zorros
pick grudge fights with their personal nemeses, leaving these apparently
helpless miners trapped. 
And finally the soundtrack, which was so promising early on, sold itself out
at the film's conclusion. There was some excellent flamenco music during
several of the movie's swordfights. The syncopated sounds of guitar, claps,
and stamps added a nice spicy flavor not only to the scenes but to the film
as a whole. And then, as the credits start to roll, out comes a soulless
white-bread pop song, sprinkled with a tiny dash of off-brand, extra-mild
salsa. It was a weak choice that gave the movie a disappointingly bland,
dull aftertaste. 
For me, the clichés and cheap laughs belied a shoddy, aimless movie. But if
you shop around for reviews, you will find that nearly everyone liked this
movie better than I did. More power to them, and to you if you go.

Review for Hercules (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) I skipped the last two Disney features because I
thought they looked exactly like the previous four - beautiful
adolescent heroes, nonbeautiful comic-relief sidekicks, simplistic
morality, and a song here and there. 
Looks like I should have skipped this one too. 
If you have kids and feel obligated to see this movie, go right ahead.
It is a clone of all the Disney features since THE LITTLE MERMAID. You
know exactly what you're getting into. If you're like me - looking for
something original or fresh, then you can probably skip this one. 
The story is a Disneyfied version of Hercules. Lots of the details are
wrong (see http://net.indra.com/~mmapes/her_gz97.htm), but the basic
story is about right. Hercules is the mortal son of Zeus, but he has the
strength of a god.  Brave Herc decides to become a hero and sets out to
prove himself by fighting all sorts of nasty monsters. Eventually, he
gains the notice of a jealous god (Hades, not Hera) whom he must later
confront. This being Disney, there is of course a love interest, Megara. 
As usual, the only character that's not white bread with mayo is the
villain. James Woods steals the show as a very show-businesslike CEO of
the underworld, complete with flaming blue hair.  
Of the songs, two stand out: one because it's bad, the other because
it's good. "Go the Distance" is a thankfully short gaggy schmaltzy
you-can-do-anything number, and "Zero to Hero" accompanies a packed
montage of heroic feats and mythological references that actually might
merit a second viewing. Parents who feel obligated to buy every Disney
movie shouldn't mind seeing that sequecne the first 15 times. There's
probably a lot there. 
One final note deserves mentioning; the credits zoom by at an unusually
high speed. Most people walk out during the credits anyway, so the crawl
speed really shouldn't matter. Nevertheless, the credits rocket upwards
insultingly fast. A lot of people worked very hard to produce HERCULES,
and they deserve better.

Title
Review for Small Time Crooks (2000)
*** (out of 4) After thoroughly enjoying Woody Allen's latest
lightweight comedy, a friend said something that makes it harder for me
to recommend it. He pointed out, correctly, that the movie has no third
act. It just ends. The structure is sloppy and incomplete.
That doesn't mean I suddenly enjoyed the movie less. I still found
Allen's comedy to be as funny as any of his recent comic successes such
as EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU and MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY. 
Ray (Woody Allen) is a small time crook who gets a brilliant scheme to
rent out a shop two doors down from a bank. He'll set up a front
operation, which his wife Frenchie (Tracy Ullman) will operate, and
he'll tunnel his way to the bank. The scheme goes horribly wrong, but
Frenchie's front operation takes off, and soon the small band of crooks
is making it big in legitimate business.
The plot is as sparse and as simple as that, which ordinarily would
leave a lot to be desired. However, in this case, a wisp of plot is all
that's needed, a simple setting against which Allen's cast of colorful
characters can react and play.
Each of the funny figures in this movie is dumb in his or her own,
unique way.
For example, Allen's character is blue-collar dumb. He has made a career
as a dishwasher. When he was in jail for a crime he botched, the other
prisoners sarcastically called him "The Brain," which he took as a
compliment.
Frenchie is low-brow dumb. She wants to be cultured and refined, but her
inborn taste is against her. Even with one-on-one lessons in class from
Hugh Grant, she can't seem to master the art of subtlety.
My husband Otto was dyslexic. The only thing he could spell correctly
was his name.-- Elaine May, as May
Frenchie's cousin May (played by writer/director Elaine May) is low-IQ
dumb. She takes everything at face value. White lies, subterfuge, and
personal secrets are all beyond her mental capacity. May delivers some
of the funniest lines in the movie with a perfect deadpan.
Just to round things out, Michael Rapaport, in a small role, is
"dumb-blond" dumb. He looks up to Ray "The Brain" and is eager to help
in Ray's latest greatest caper. While digging a tunnel he wears his
miners' helmet (complete with lamp) backwards because it looks cool that
way.
Allen's humor in SMALL TIME CROOKS is largely verbal. It's a style of
comedy that not many modern filmmakers do well. The Marx Brothers were
experts (except for Harpo, of course). But since then it's been a long,
dry spell. Only Woody Allen makes good, solid comedies where most of the
jokes are in the dialogue, and this is one of them.

Title
Review for Contact (1997)
***1/2 (out of 4) Jodie Foster is great, and Zemeckis knows how to use
film technology without compromising a story's humanity, but the real
star of CONTACT is its author, Carl Sagan. 
CONTACT is a smart movie. It is a science fiction movie without being an
action movie. Instead of laser blasts, chases and grunting, it offers
questions, dilemmas, and discussion. It is science fiction from the
perspective of a scientist, not from that of a studio with too much
money and gunpowder. 
Foster plays Ellie Arroway, a Sagan-like scientist working for SETI (the
Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence). Faced with a government
bureaucracy unwilling to pay for pure research, it is Ellie's
determination alone that keeps her in her job. 
Her determination pays off when she hears a repeating signal coming from
a nearby star. As Ellie starts decoding the cryptic message, the world
watches, frets, and prays. As the message becomes clearer and clearer to
Ellie, the world's reaction becomes more and more muddled. Ellie learns
that the message is a blueprint for a kind of spaceship, while humanity
argues over the aliens' intentions, legitimacy, and divinity. 
The blueprints are ultimately realized through the funding of a
worldwide coalition of nations, and a representative is chosen to be the
first ambassador to our new neighbors. 
Contact is a great tribute to Sagan. Ellie has all of Sagan's curiosity,
morality, and rationality. She repeats a probabilistic argument for the
existence of extraterrestrial intelligence that Sagan used in his
COSMOS. Ellie is a rational athiest who's interested in religious
discussion, like Sagan. And when she says "billion" you can almost hear
his voice.  
Beyond the character of Ellie, the movie itself honors Sagan. It asks
relevant questions about religion and science without taking sides, it
recognizes the humanity of even the bad guys (though James Woods'
portrayal was a little prickly). Most of all, it values human curiosity
- that inexplicable force that makes scientists like Ellie and Sagan so
determined. 
Zemeckis proves his ability right from the start. The opening shot of
the movie is absolutely beautiful, and the richly layered soundtrack
gives meaning to that beauty (kudos to supervising sound editor Phil
Benson). The second sequence of shots foreshadows Ellie's future: young
Ellie makes radio contact with distant life forms from a thousand miles
away. 
Zemeckis doesn't condescend to his audience; he gives us credit for
being able to understand science and to appreciate the discussion of
religion. Even in such mundane tasks as introducing characters, Zemeckis
does not insult our intelligence. A blind man is introduced without
anyone saying "Meet Fisher, he's blind;" a reclusive benefactor is
revealed with a glance, not a grand, James Bond-like introduction. 
Finally, Zemeckis and editor Arthur Schmidt really heap on the tension
when, toward the end, our ambassador is ready to be sent. Lately, movie
tension has been less than subtle: consider the bus-over-the-cliff scene
in THE LOST WORLD or the paranoia of homocidal prisoners in CON AIR. In
CONTACT, the tension is just as taut, but more complex. There is a
chance for death, but other factors gnaw at the characters and at the
audience: the anticipation of meeting an alien race, the uncertainty of
using technology we don't understand, the fear of aborting a mission so
close to comletion. 
Still, all of this talent could have been spent on a less deserving
story. It is a tribute to the producers (other than Sagan and Ann
Druyan, his wife) and Zemeckis that they took a chance on a smart, human
science fiction movie, instead of buying explosions and space battles.

Title
Review for Out of Sight (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4) Too often, a movie with lots of momentum loses it all at a
crucial scene. It happened in this film when a character accidentally killed
himself. The movie seemed to play up this gruesome scene as comedy, and my
audience laughed at it. The pressure to find this scene funny was awkward
and disquieting, and it made me respect the film much less. 
This movie has a lot going for it. For one, the story was written by Elmore
Leonard, whose offbeat crime dramas inevitably make for good movies. GET
SHORTY, JACKIE BROWN, and now OUT OF SIGHT make an interesting trio of capers. 
The style and look of the movie held together nicely. The simplified
four-color poster for the movie tells us to expect a late sixties/early
seventies action movie, and that's what the movie delivers. It captured the
feel of those great cops-and-robbers TV shows without parodying them, and
without setting the movie in that era. The music, the sideburns, the liberal
use of freeze frames and quick zooms add to the overall impression of a
solid late-sixties crime drama. 
The movie is actually set in the present. Jack Foley (George Clooney) is a
smooth bank robber. He helps his victims relax and obey with his casual air.
Unfortunately, his car doesn't run so smooth and he gets sent to prison
where he makes some connections for when he gets out. There's Glenn (Steve
Zahn), who has a tip on a big score, Ripley (Albert Brooks), who blabs about
his wealth, making himself a target, Buddy (Ving Rhames), and Snoopy (Don
Cheadle), who rules Detroit. 
Foley breaks out of prison with the help of Glenn, but their plan is
somewhat hampered by the appearance of a federal Marshall, Karen Sisco
(Jennifer Lopez). She gets locked in a trunk with Foley as they make their
getaway. Foley comes on to her and she isn't entirely unreceptive. Finally
she escapes, and so does he. 
Foley works his way to Detroit, looking for one last big score while Sisco
works her way there on his trail. She is looking for him both professionally
and personally, and he won't be too sorry if she catches him. The night
before the big heist, they meet in a bar, and they try to work out which one
will give up their career for the other. 
And soon thereafter, the momentum dies an ugly gruesome death. 
(To be fair, nobody else has criticized the accidental death scene and I can
only assume that, for most people, it wasn't a problem. Mentally give this
movie an extra half-star if you're not squeamish.) 
Veteran editor Anne V. Coates used lots of good technique. There were a few
places where the cut from one scene to the next makes a wry visual joke. For
example, after Foley's getaway car won't start, Coates cuts directly to him
in prison. When Sisco has Foley trapped, Coates cuts to a scene of her in
the hospital with a broken nose. In addition, she had a good feel for the
chemistry between Lopez and Clooney, letting their eyes linger just long
enough before cutting to the other. 
All in all, this movie is a step or two above average. The writing,
chemistry, editing, and momentum PROBABLY made up for any deficiencies.

Title
Review for Truman Show, The (1998)
*** (out of 4) Truman ("true-man") Burbank is the perfect name for Jim
Carrey's character in this film. President Truman was an unassuming man who
became known worldwide, in spite of (or was it because of) his stature.
"Truman" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war, an era when
planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life
for Americans. And Burbank, California, brings to mind THE TONIGHT SHOW and
the home of NBC. If Hollywood is the center of the film world, Burbank is,
or was, the center of TV's world, the world where our protagonist lives.
Combine all these names and concepts into "Truman Burbank," and you get
something that well describes him and his artificial world. 
Truman leads the perfect life. His town, his car, and his wife are picture
perfect. His idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light
falls from the sky. The radio explains that an overflying airplane started
coming apart . . . but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio
light? The next day during the drive to work, the radio jams and he starts
picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements. He is so distracted
that he nearly hits a pedestrian. When the radio comes back to normal, the
announcer warns listeners to drive carefully. His suspicion aroused, he
wanders around the town square looking for other oddities. The world appears
to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to
take the elevator. The elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people
on coffee breaks. A grip sees Truman him and quickly moves a paneled door,
made to look like the back of an elevator, into place. Two security guards
grab him and throw him out. 
Truman is really suspicious now. It gets even worse the next day when his
wife, a nurse, describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw
the lounge. "It's best not to think about it," she says, trying vainly to
change Truman's memory. Truman becomes determined to see who or what is
behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense. At every turn he is
stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own
little town. His last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the
edge of the world. 
You know by now that Truman's life is the subject of a television program.
His actions are "real" but everything else is carefully scripted, from the
death of his father to the choice of his wife. Truman is determined to find
out what the big hoax is. Meanwhile, Christof, the all-seeing creator of
Truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy. It's sort of
like WESTWORLD told from the robots' point of view, or JURASSIC PARK from
the dinosaurs' point of view. We root for the CAPTIVE of the cage-world. Our
protagonist is counting on "chaos theory" to help him escape his elaborate
trap. 
The story, written by Andrew Niccol (writer/director of GATTACA), introduces
some interesting questions, such as the ethics of subjecting a person to
this type of life, or the psychological impact of learning that your entire
life has all been fake. Although these questions came to mind, I don't think
the film itself asked them. It certainly didn't address them or try to
answer them.  I was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more
with the trauma of learning one's life is a TV show. Carrey's performance at
the end showed a smidgen of Truman's pain, but I almost felt that he got
over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing. 
Earlier in the movie I found myself wondering if it would be better for
Truman to find out the truth or whether I should root for him to be well.
The two seemed exclusive of one another, but Weir and Niccol didn't see it
that way. Perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it ISN'T, but
it seems like there were some missed opportunities here. 
But on its own terms, the movie is well made. Sight, sound and pacing are
all handled competently.  
Much of the first part of the movie IS The Truman Show. The scenes are all
apparently shot from hidden cameras, with snoots and obstructions covering
the corners of the screen. One hidden camera is apparently in his car radio,
the green LED numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen. 
The music is well-chosen and scored. The film opens with what sounds like
family drama theme music, when Truman's world is still beautiful and
perfect. When the movie ends, the score sounds more like a frantic, driven,
Tangerine Dream opus, while still keeping the same timbre. Philip Glass'
epic music (from POWAQQATSI) permeates Truman's scenes of suspicion and
awakening. (Glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show.) 
And the pacing of the story was brisk. There was no unnecessarily long setup
explaining the concept behind The Truman Show, just a few quick title cards,
a few interviews, and then right into the show, and the movie. One of the
first scenes is of the studio light falling; there was no token scene of
Truman's idyllic life before it falls apart, because it wasn't necessary, we
pick up the story at the first sign of trouble, and no sooner. There's also
no point in the movie where the plot slows down. It's a quick, straight shot
to the movie's end. 
In terms of overall quality, I would compare THE TRUMAN SHOW to Niccol's
GATTACA. Both films are well made with interesting stories set in
interesting worlds. But neither film really felt like it capitalized on all
the great ideas; neither film "clicked" and became an instant classic.
Nevertheless, I look forward to Niccol's next film, whatever it may be.

Review for Dogma (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) DOGMA entertained me but it did not impress me.
Kevin Smith (Chasing Amy, Clerks) is both a good writer and a bad
writer. His ideas are inventive, perceptive, and honest. His material is
some of the freshest around. On the other hand, his characters speak in
wordy monologues and obvious plot-driven exposition.
DOGMA is a comic-book-like story of two angels bent on getting into
heaven as human souls. Their plan is to become human, walk through a
Catholic loophole to purify themselves, then die and go to straight to
heaven. Of course, once they do this all of creation will be unmade, but
what do they care? No foul, no harm, right?
The mythic rules of this heroic tale are those of the rich, complex
world of Catholic dogma. The hero (Bethany, played by Linda Fiorentino)
is referred to as the Last Scion. Her spirit guides are the Seraphim
Metatron (how's THAT for a comic book name? -- he's played by Alan
Rickman) and the thirteenth Apostle (Chris Rock). She's aided by two
prophets (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, reprising their roles as Jay and
Silent Bob). And the beast trying to stop her is the Demon Azrael (Jason
Lee) who abets the fallen angels and sends three skating minions and a
Shit Demon against the hero (okay, maybe the Shit Demon isn't a Catholic
symbol).
At first glance it seems irreverent, if not downright heretical. Among
other things, Bethany works at an abortion clinic and must perform
euthanasia to save the world. But deeper down, Smith really seems to
take it seriously. He DOES poke fun at the church, but always as an
insider, like he's making fun of himself. He never takes any cruel,
cheap shots, and he never disses it just to shock or annoy. There's
always a sense of real acceptance of and interest in the church. No
other movie in recent memory has so many characters talking seriously
about religion.
Unfortunately this talking is often stagey and obvious. In order to work
in everything he has to say, Smith's characters speak as if in a play.
Nobody interrupts the paragraph-length discussions on race, the
structure of the church, and on the validity of "Plenary Indulgences" 
the loophole that will allow the angels to get away with the murder of
Creation.
Although the discussions are interesting and relevant to the topic of
the film, a narrative film isn't the best art form for what Smith's
lengthy speeches. A comic book would be much more appropriate. (On the
other hand, feature filmmaking has a broader audience for Smith's
message. As Metatron said, "If there isn't a movie about it, it isn't
worth knowing, is it?")
As a non-Catholic, I found DOGMA to be entertaining, but I could tell
that about half of the jokes went over my head. I felt like I was the
third person in a conversation between two old friends. In other words,
Smith's movie did not speak to me at all.
To Catholics with a sense of humor about themselves, I would recommend
this movie more highly. For the rest of us, it's an entertaining, if
unimpressive matinee.

Title
Review for Mystery, Alaska (1999)
*1/2 (out of 4) The previews for the movie are pretty good. They show a
little plot, all the characters, and the emotional highlights, all
spliced together to give a general impression of the script.
Unfortunately, the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes.
The residents of Mystery love hockey. Mystery and hockey go together
like Texas and high school football. The townsfolk love hockey so much
that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man
(yes, that's one of the movie's jokes.) Every Saturday, the best players
pair off for a game, and the whole town comes to watch. 
The town's prodigal son Charlie (Hank Azaria) wrote an article on the
weekly game for Sports Illustrated. Mystery's national fame has the town
abuzz. A week later, Charlie actually shows up in person, and he brings
with him an offer from the NHL. The New York Rangers will come to
Mystery to play the locals.
The Mysterians see this as both good and bad. On the one hand, they'd
love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition. On the other
hand, they don't want to turn up as the butt of Leno and Letterman
jokes.
The movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the
proposition. 
Biebe (Russell Crowe) has just been retired from the team and is asked
to coach the boys, including his new replacement. He's already
resentful, and to top it off Charlie has been making eyes at his wife.
Crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film, so he's just kind
of stuck with constantly brooding.
Charlie, meanwhile, is resentful of having born in a town where hockey
is the only measure of a man's worth. His "gift" of the feature story,
and of the New York Rangers, was his way of compensating for not being a
better skater. He hoped it would earn him some respect and merit, but
the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him.
Burt Reynolds could have been interesting as Walter, the judge whose
courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans. Walter actually
has some experience with collegiate hockey, but he actively tries to put
it behind him. He wants his son to take the game more seriously, but he
wants his community to just get over it. Reynolds could have been good,
but sloppy writing and/or editing keep Walter in the corner, and so
Reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together.
One character actually was interesting. Biebe's wife (Mary McCormack),
like the judge, understood that there was more to life than hockey. But
unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community. She
chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open. Her unique
insight is verbalized once, and it lasts only a scene before it is gone,
but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom.
MYSTERTY, ALASKA follows a handful of other characters, but none are
well developed or worth mentioning.
The biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to
the story, no underlying thing that the movie is really ABOUT. Instead,
Roach and screenwriters David E. Kelley and Sean O'Byrne try to cram the
entire human condition into this sports comedy. They try to make you
laugh and cry, to feel outrage and pride. They present the framing and
cadence for jokes, but there's nothing truly funny. They show
appropriately staged scenes of sadness, but they give you nothing to be
really sad about. As columnist Molly Ivins would say, it's all hat, no
cattle.
The perfect opportunity arises for Roach to say what this movie is
really about. There is a funeral scene, played with appropriate gravity
and somber music. It is a chance for the characters to reflect on their
lives and decide what's truly important. Russell Crowe steps forward to
speak, about to spell out the movie's metaphor for us. He says that what
really matters in life is "community...." Then adds "and hockey." I
guess these Mysterians really are as shallow as they appear.
Only mildly bad, Mystery, Alaska probably deserves 2 stars. I even
laughed out loud, genuine laughs in places. But I docked it an extra
half star when Mike Myers, a friend of Roach, turned up in a role that
didn't suit him. Myers is a comic character actor. He puts on masks,
becomes an outrageous caricature, and is funny. He's great as Austin
Powers, Dr. Evil, or any of his Scottish characters. 
Nobody else in MYSTERTY, ALASKA is a comic caricature. All the other
people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles. For
Roach to bring in Myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt
toward the rest of his cast, toward his audience, and indeed toward the
film itself. It's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not
worth taking seriously.

Title
Review for Ronin (1998)
*** (out of 4) RONIN tries to be a thinking man's thriller. It doesn't
succeed in that endeavor, but it approaches the action with such vigor
and confidence that it ends up being an excellent flick. 
Sam (Robert DeNiro), an American freelance mercenary, meets his contact
in a French café. He has been hired by an Irish agent (Natascha
McElhone) to acquire a certain briefcase. Joining Sam are Vincent (Jean
Reno), the French acquirer; Gregor (Stellan Skarsgĺrd), the
possibly-German agent with catlike reflexes; and Spence (Sean Bean), the
overeager young Englishman. 
The contents of the briefcase are secret, even to the audience. This was
one of Frankenheimer's devices to increase the depth of the film. The
idea is that without knowing what they are fighting for, these
mercenaries must carefully examine their motives and loyalties. But when
Sam is told he can't know the contents, he ups his price and ends the
conversation. So much for the thought- provoking device. Actually, it
doesn't detract from the film at all, it just doesn't have the
importance that Frankenheimer had obviously hoped for. 
Before they begin their mission, the crew stocks up on weapons and
technology. The scene of the weapons buy introduces us to the movie's
intricately planned, paranoid action scenes. First Sam gets a funny
feeling that something isn't right. Then Spence notices that only some
of the shipment has been delivered. The dealers try to lure the
mercenaries into a trap, giving them their first taste of danger on a
mission destined to be filled with it. 
If I were to see the movie again, I might appreciate the way this scene
makes the characters question their loyalty to an unknown cause. But
because the tension and action were so deftly handled, I was too
engrossed to be thinking about the big picture. Ironically, that also
contributes to why I say Frankenheimer didn't fully succeed in what he
intended. 
The mysterious case is now in Italy, and our anti-heroes plan their
attack. The level of detail in their plan is fascinating. The 30 minutes
or so that goes into setting up the big grab is as cunning as the best
caper, heist, or spy movie. The plan culminates in an outstanding action
sequence full of amazing stunts and adrenalin-pumping car chases. 
Admittedly, the chase scene has a few hackneyed moments - the
Construction-on-the-Roadway, the Fish Cart, and that timeless classic,
the Vegetable Stand With Stacked Boxes. Seems like it shouldn't be so
difficult to think up some new obstacles, but maybe the filmmakers were
paying homage to the great cinematic tradition that is the car chase. 
Regardless, Frankenheimer can be forgiven some clichés, because he
avoided the use of digital effects in the car chase scenes. It's an
expensive decision, but the results are worth it. When a stunt is real,
it is a feat worthy of the medium - an amazing act of ingenuity and
bravery immortalized on film. When a stunt is computer-generated, (or
faked by sound effects and deceptive editing) the gut-level excitement
and tension just isn't there. In RONIN, it's there, thanks to some of
the best car chases on film. 
Needless to say, Sam and company do not retrieve the case (the movie's
only half over). The second half of the movie has them tracking the case
as before, but this half lacks the cleverness and intricate planning
introduced earlier. There is more action and as much tension, but it
doesn't have the finesse of the first hour, and its absence is felt. 
The second half of the film reintroduces the question of loyalty and
explains the film's title. The Ronin, we are told, were a group of
samurai whose master was betrayed and killed. They banded together,
lordless, to exact their revenge. When the Ronin executed the traitor,
they still didn't have a master and they no longer had a crusade, so
they committed ritual suicide. "They chose honor, they chose myth," says
Jean-Pierre (Michael Lonsdale, who is very good in this marginal role).
"They chose wrong," retorts Sam, reinforcing the film's easy answer to
the its own questions about loyalty. 
Like the device of the mystery case, this scene is an attempt to add a
level of depth to the film. But like the device of the mystery case, it
doesn't succeed. 
Even without Sam's curt response, the scene doesn't add much, because
the movie goes out of its way to introduce Jean-Pierre. It is a little
too convenient that Vincent knows this particular man in this particular
town, right when they need a place to hole up. Instead of this keystone
metaphor arising from the action, it feels as though it has been
carefully placed on top of the action. 
After they leave Jean-Pierre, the mercenaries head back to France, hot
on the trail of the prized case. One final breathtaking car chase (the
one that will be remembered) keeps the film's pace brisk, right up to
the obligatory twist ending. 
The ultimate ending, the one that explains the significance of the
mission, seems like one final contrivance, one last attempt by
Frankenheimer to make this action movie appear smarter than it really
is. Nevertheless, the addition of this (and the other) devices never
really hurt the movie. That's because as a pure action-thriller, RONIN
is far above average.

Title
Review for Lost in Space (1998)
*1/2 (out of 4) Watching the movie, I vowed to subtract half a star from the
review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup, cute 'n cuddly,
computer-generated monkey. If the monkey died, the movie got an extra half
star. Alas, the monkey showed up at the end, unharmed, to the wet sickly
sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs. 
What that means is that LOST IN SPACE actually deserved 2 stars. That's
pretty generous, considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in
cheek. When Will Robinson (Jack Johnson) teaches his pet robot about
friendship, you are actually supposed to buy it. 
So why such a seemingly high rating? There are a few reasons that made me
unable to throw away the experience with the garbage. First, we saw the
movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater.
The sound and screen kicked ass. Nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as
much as my audience did (and I don't necessarily mean that in a good way).
Also, there were more than zero scenes where I found myself rooting for the
Robinsons, or getting caught up in the movie's tension. I even liked the
computer-generated settings. I usually prefer to see models or sets, but the
CG was more detailed than I've seen in a lot of movies; it looks like
someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities. 
Also, Gary Oldman is never a bad actor, even though he is typecast as a
villain. William Hurt isn't too bad either. Neither actor had a great role,
but their performances were watchable. 
And perhaps I shouldn't admit this, but something about the tone and outlook
of the movie brought me back to my childhood. There is very little swearing
or blood; there is a strong moral message, saccharine though it is; there is
a bit of romance (whose culmination after 2 hours is a "real" kiss -- no
sex). It felt like one of those Disney movies that I so looked forward to
when I was six. Those movies were probably as bad as LOST IN SPACE, but at
the time, they were manna from Heaven. That type of moviemaking is a lost art. 
Worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue. It's
squeaky-clean, family fun, trying hard to be as hip as Pulp Fiction. "You
better hold on to your joystick," is one such line. And when a Robinson is
called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs, they
inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest Star Trek
ensign. 
Second worst, and closely related, is the screenplay. The story's exposition
takes place at a press conference, which allows the writers to explain
what's happening with the least amount of creativity, effort, or interest.
Once the story gets going, I do concede a momentary burst of interest once
in a while, but on the whole, the situations that arise are silly and
contrived. When Gary Oldman easily reprograms Will's pet robot to kill the
Robinsons, my friend summed it up perfectly: "he flipped the switch to 'evil.'" 
Then there's the tone of the movie. The Colorado Daily said the film would
have been more interesting if the central character was Will Robinson and
not his father John Robinson. Then it could be an adventure movie. They're
mostly right, except that Johnson (Will) wasn't a good enough actor to carry
it off. Still, that the film has the Robinson patriarch as our hero shows a
lack of imagination. Just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't
mean that we have to bow to a "promise keepers" notion of who's the center
of a family. Many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional
family structure (FLY AWAY HOME comes to mind) to much better effect. 
And the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a
futuristic movie. In STAR WARS, the rebels were the good guys. We were
rooting for those who were fighting against the system. In LOST IN SPACE,
the rebels are the bad guys, a terrorist force that must be killed, crushed
and silenced so that our children may live free. That ominous excuse for
violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists. 
Finally, a few specific details deserve criticism. The movie tells us that
the setting is the year 2056. Why? Why bother saying what year this is. Just
tell us it's the future. I bring it up because the TV series was supposed to
take place in 1997. Setting a specific date only dates the movie and
guarantees that it won't be timeless (not that this movie was really in the
running anyway.). Then there is a scene that shows John Robinson checking
one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole. This
silly waste of money reminded me of Bugs Bunny's barber chair, and only
shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a
thing about ergonomics. 
One vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest
of the film failed: it made LOST IN SPACE look cool. The strong techno beat
sampled the cheesiest dialogue and, out of context, made it sound hip. This
is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips
from the movie. 
But if that's the best part of the movie, I can't in good conscience
recommend it. Still, if you get stuck seeing it, as we did, you might be
able to appreciate it if you keep your distance, think of liking bad movies
as a child, and bring along your "bad movie bingo" cards.

Title
Review for Besieged (1998)
**** (out of 4) BESIEGED is elegantly structured and concisely told.
Based on a short story by James Lasdun, it has the feel of a folk tale.
The setting is modern, but the characters and their motivations are
timeless and cross-cultural.
Before I continue, let me say that if you're interested already, go see
BESIEGED before reading this or any other reviews. It's not that the
movie centers around a surprise; it's that the movie's structure and
pace are very part of what's best about it. Knowing too much beforehand
might diminish their impact. Forgive me if the rest of the review is a
little vague as I try not to spoil anything.
Shandurai (Thandie Newton) is a medical student who earns her keep as a
live-in maid. Originally from Africa (from an unspecified military
dictatorship), she is now in Rome.
Her employer is Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis), a reclusive English pianist
who rarely goes out and only teaches a few students. He lives alone
(except for Shandurai) in a rich, multistory apartment left to him by
his aunt. Antique statues, tapestries, and paintings adorn his lonely
home. Amid all the beautiful objects, only the black lacquer grand piano
is loved.
BESIEGED'S setup is subtle. It is elegantly arranged so that after about
15 minutes, all the introductory shots and scenes -- from Africa and
from Rome -- click into place. More exposition might have answered some
questions sooner, but Bertolucci's introduction is cleaner, more
succinct, and more forceful.
In this first part, there is an amazing lack of dialogue. Bertolucci
sets the scene without explaining it for the camera. Except for some
incidental dialogue in Africa, nothing is said until Mr. Kinsky abruptly
professes his love for Shandurai.
Kinsky's announcement is sudden and jarring, both to Shandurai and to
the audience. Usually a filmmaker lets you know right away whether a
screen couple will end up together or not. But at this point, the
characters have barely been introduced, and they have hardly spoken to
each other. The first words they share shouldn't be a desperate proposal
of marriage. When Kinsky says he's never felt this way before, it is
easy to believe him. His reclusive lifestyle seems to have deprived him
of the emotional maturity and experience that would have helped him
control his feelings.
Obviously, Shandurai rebuffs him. And to clearly draw the line for Mr.
Kinsky, she tells him that she is married; her husband is an African
prison. Bertolucci captures the awkward moment perfectly, using handheld
camera, slow motion, and jump cuts. (In fact he uses these techniques
throughout the movie to highlight or flit past a moment.) Soon enough,
the moment passes and the two never speak of the incident again.
But the words have been spoken and the can't be called back. Shandurai
tries to forget them by looking for another living situation and
immersing herself in school. Mr. Kinsky is the perfect gentleman,
apologizing once, then acting as though the embarrassing exchange is
completely behind them.
While Shandurai studies, Mr. Kinsky starts frequenting the African
churches. Soon, small things start disappearing from Mr. Kinsky's
apartment, to the surprise of Shandurai. Very slowly, very gradually,
his apartment becomes sparser and sparser. Life goes on, but the opulent
setting is becoming more and more humble. Kinsky never explains where
the rich adornments go, and Shandurai is afraid to ask.
Our suspicions (and Shandurai's hopes) are confirmed when she discovers
a letter in his wastebasket from her country's government in
Africa....
The story of sacrifice is very simple. So simple, in fact, that it
almost sounds like a fairy tale -- like a story once told around
campfires to extended families.
In fact, BESIEGED features an African storyteller. He exists outside of
the story but appears on-camera at key moments from Shandurai's life in
Africa. Perhaps he is the director's shadow, because with BESIEGED,
Bertolucci proves himself a great storyteller.
Bertolucci uses the medium of film to its fullest extent. He slows time
when a moment has weight, and skims through it when a moment is
fleeting. He avoids unnecessary dialogue and SHOWS, rather than TELLS,
when possible. He uses editing to concisely compress time, and to draw
thematic parallels between scenes.
The use of music in this film is wonderful. Rich African rhythms and
harmonies contrast with the luxurious beauty of Kinsky's solo piano
pieces. The musical contrast echoes the differences between the two main
characters. (It's interesting to note that Kinsky's music takes on more
rhythm and life after he visits the African church.) A single jazz tune
in the middle -- "My Favorite Things," appropriately enough -- bridges
the two styles of music and the two halves of the film.
Finally, and most importantly, Bertolucci keeps the actors in an
emotional middle ground, rather than locking them into a strong,
fully-explained passion. This leaves room to interpret words or deeds in
different ways. Does Kinsky love Shandurai or is he merely infatuated?
Does he hope to make her happy or does he hope to win her love? Does she
love him, or is she merely grateful? Different answers could leave
viewers with completely different ideas about what the movie was about.
That's not to say that Bertolucci was being vague. Rather, he was
acknowledging that when it comes to human behavior, there is usually no
single, identifiable motivation.

Title
Review for Apostle, The (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) Sonny sees a car crash not as a tragedy but as an
opportunity. He's not a lawyer, though; he's a preacher. 
When we first meet Sonny, he is fortunate enough to come upon an accident
just after it happened. He grabs a Bible and runs to one of the cars. Sonny
is able to comfort the semi-conscious, bleeding occupant, and save his soul
before the cops chase him off. 
Thus opens THE APOSTLE, Robert Duvall's directing debut. Duvall also stars,
playing Sonny, a traveling Alabama preacher. Sonny is on the road so much
that his family is breaking up. His wife Jessie (Farrah Fawcett) has started
seeing another man, and she's ready for divorce. On top of that, she manages
to vote Sonny out of the church that he himself founded. 
Sonny still loves his wife and kids, so when Jessie's lover has the audacity
to stand between him and his own children, Sonny snaps. He beats the other
man to death with a softball bat. (In a culturally revealing echo from the
beginning of the film, the bystanders do not administer CPR to the dying
man, they collectively pray over him.) 
Sonny isn't stupid. He knows he lost his head and that he was terribly
wrong. But rather than stay in his own forsaken community and face the
music, Sonny ditches his car, his ID, and his name. He becomes "The Apostle
E.F." and sets off on foot looking for a sign from the Lord. 
He is led to a small town where he hooks up with the local preacher to found
a new church. 
That's it. That's the plot. If that summary makes it sound a little
open-ended, it is. Plotwise, a lot happens in the first third of the movie,
and then the pace changes drastically. When Sonny/E.F. settles in to his
newly adopted home town, the slow process of building a church begins. The
last two-thirds of the movie is relatively uneventful, giving the movie an
aimless, endless quality. 
When it comes time for the movie to end (about 20-30 minutes too late), it
comes from out of the blue. In fact, in an otherwise "realistic" film, it
takes a miracle (a kitchen radio changes stations unexpectedly) to bring
about the movie's conclusion. It's as though Duvall knows only how to direct
actors, and not how to handle a plot. 
Nevertheless, the movie has a lot going for it. Robert Duvall (the actor) is
very good in this film. In fact, it may be his best acting ever. He feels
natural in the role. When he's preaching, he is so caught up in the emotion
and the words, it's as if Duvall really is preaching and not acting. Even
when he's not preaching, Duvall captures the quirks and mannerisms of a
plain, friendly, extroverted man; the type of man that everyone likes and
nobody knows. 
Sonny has a healthy outlook for a movie character - for anyone - to have.
He's not in his job for the money, he's in it because he loves it. Sonny
knows his faults and prays forgiveness for his sins, but he doesn't dwell on
them. He simply lives each day as the Good Lord gives it to him. 
Also, in a refreshing twist, the film deals with religion without a hint of
cynicism or hypocrisy. One could infer some irony in that this preacher has
committed murder and fled the crime, but Sonny doesn't preach perfection, he
preaches repentance and salvation as an alternative to eternal damnation.
Given his character and the approach of the film, there is nothing
hypocritical in Sonny's chosen path. 
I can appreciate everything that was right in the movie, but unfortunately,
the whole experience didn't measure up. In spite of the interesting
characters and fresh look at southern religion, my overall impression is
that the movie was aimless and too long. That's too bad because I was really
rooting for Duvall. He is a good actor, and he's a good actor's director,
but it seems he's just not cut out for pulling a film together.

Review for Insider, The (1999)
Not that I put much stock in the Academy Awards, but 3 people deserve
nominations for their work on THE INSIDER: Al Pacino and Russell Crowe
for their focused performances, and Michael Mann for his clockwork
direction.
THE INSIDER is an intense, involved drama about Jeffrey Wigand's
whistleblowing on Big Tobacco and Lowell Bergman's work producing a 60
MINUTES segment about him. Two and one-half hours fly by as the detailed
drama unfolds.
The movie opens on Bergman (Pacino) risking his life to set up a 60
MINUTES interview with the leader of the Hezbollah. Yet even while he's
producing one segment, he's looking ahead to the next one - a segment on
the fire hazards of smoking in bed.
Wigand (Crowe) is introduced to us as he leaves his job at Brown &
Williamson, one of the Big Seven tobacco companies. Mann's close-up,
hand-held camera (his cinematographer was Dante Spinotti) implies an
ominous, Big-Brother watchfulness as Wigand leaves the building, and
throughout the movie.
The two cross paths when Bergman calls Wigand, hoping to hire him as a
consultant on his fire-hazard story. Wigand strongly refuses Bergman -
so strongly that it piques his curiosity. Bergman smells a bigger story
under Wigand's nervousness.
Meanwhile, the Big Brother cinematography that implied Wigand's
paranoia, turns out to have been well-founded. Brown & Williamson calls
him back in to renegotiate the terms of his confidentiality agreement.
They seem to know that he has spoken to someone, and they want to
tighten the knots in his gag order.
Luckily for Bergman and 60 MINUTES, the more pressure Brown & Williamson
put on Wigand, the more eager he is to come forward with his story.
Part of the reason Mann is so successful is that every character has his
own motives. No character exists merely as a plot device. So although
Bergman and Wigand often collaborate, each has a different reason for
doing so, each with a different goal. Such human motivators as trust,
integrity and honesty all figure in to the characters and their actions.
Another reason is that the intensity of the story never falters.
Although the movie is over two hours loX-Mozilla-Status: 0009at should
have been trimmed. Every scene is important to the film, and no scene
goes on too long.
Finally, there are some technical reasons that Mann's movie succeeds.
The first is where Mann and Spinotti put the camera. For example, they
broke one of the fundamental rules of filmmaking, but for a good reason.
One should never "cross the eyeline" - that is to say, if Pacino and
Crowe are talking and Pacino is on the right side of the screen, he
should ALWAYS be on the right side, at least during that conversation.
But in two places, the eyeline is crossed repeatedly. The effect is
disorienting, which is both why you shouldn't do it, and why they DID do
it in THE INSIDER.
The second is in the editing. Mann and editor William Goldenberg would
sometimes edit for mood. For example, when Wigand crosses back into
Kentucky after possibly violating part of his confidentiality agreement,
he puts himself at risk of arrest. A burning car sits by the side of the
road. Plotwise, the car is a coincidence, but its inclusion shows
externally what Wigand's emotions must be doing internally. 
And finally, the amount of polish the filmmakers used shows great craft
and respect for the audience. Carefully designed sound schemes and
well-framed widescreen shots are the outer signs of a movie that is very
good through and through.
To top it all off, Pacino and Crowe give outstanding performances in
serious, well-rounded, and substantial roles.
THE INSIDER is a success at every level. It's a gripping drama, not to
be missed.

Review for U.S. Marshals (1998)
My first reaction to U.S. MARSHALS was that there was nothing original,
nothing that broke from the action movie formula, in the entire film.
I was wrong, but not by much. 
The movie is a sequel to THE FUGITIVE, the above-average thriller starring
Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford. Actually, it's more of a remake than a
sequel. This time, Sam Gerard (Jones) is on the trail of Mark Sheridan
(Wesley Snipes). Sheridan, like Ford's character in THE FUGITIVE, is falsely
accused, arrested, convicted, and put on a prison transport that crashes.
Sheridan is able to escape, and Marshal Sam Gerard is called off his current
assignment to catch him. 
I felt bad for Jones being caught in such a mediocre film after he won an
Oscar for the same role (he won Best Supporting Actor in 1993 for THE
FUGITIVE). In fact, the first time we see Jones on screen he is dressed in a
chicken suit. It was beneath his dignity. When he first read the script he
should have turned it down cold. 
But because Jones took the role, the movie was somewhat salvaged. Jones'
portrayal of Sam's almost neurotic relentlessness added an interesting angle
to the movie. Also, the pacing was surprisingly good, considering that the
movie was so predictable. No sequence lingered too long before the hunt
moved to a new setting or took a new turn. And the supporting cast of
marshals (particularly Joe Pantoliano and LaTanya Richardson) was good. The
dialog and banter among them was lively and natural; it felt like they
actually worked together, as a unit, every day. 
But the movie also had big problems in the script and in the direction. 
The movie was too unoriginal and predictable to be much fun. It looks
different from its predecessor, but the differences are purely superficial.
The structure and outcome borrow heavily from the first, and the whole movie
has the feel of a slapped-together, uninspired sequel. 
And other than Jones', none of the characters were very well developed.
Snipes' character was contrived to be similar to Harrison Ford's in the
original, constraining his acting options. Robert Downey Jr. had a
two-dimensional part as an unwelcome outsider assigned to work on Sam's
close-knit team. And Iréne Jacob's talents were wasted as Sheridan's
girlfriend, a part that was clearly written for the sole purpose of getting
a beautiful model into the movie. 
With U.S. MARSHALS, Baird and the film's seven producers built an expensive
mansion on a swampy patch of land in Greeley, Colorado: they spent a lot of
money on a bad script written from a story that's only mildly interesting,
regardless of the quality of its telling. 
Skip this one unless you're a Jones fan, and even then, wait for video.
Shouldn't be too much longer now.

Title
Review for Cop Land (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) I've seen rave reviews for Cop Land and I've seen
reviews that say to avoid it. Ah, if only I could feel that strongly
about it. 
It was good. You won't hear me telling you why you should skip it. It's
just that I never got interested in it; it never pulled me in. Once you
get past the hook, the details are conventional cop-movie material. 
The movie is set in the aptly named town of Garrison, NJ, right across
the bridge from New York City. About thirty NYC cops and their families
live in Garrison, away from the crime and the slime of the big city.
Most of the cops are crooked, and living in Garrison is just the tip of
the iceberg (to be in the NYPD, cops are required to live in New York
City; these cops found a loophole). 
A deaf ear kept Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) from joining New
York's Finest, so he became the sheriff of "Cop Land." In contrast to
the cops across the bridge, Freddy's days are spent retrieving stuffed
animals and resolving tiffs between neighbors. For all the policing he
does, he could be the sheriff of Bedford Falls. 
When the New York cops cover up a case of brutality and murder by
bringing their comrade to Garrison, Freddy is faced with a moral
dilemma. On the one hand, there is no need to make his own life worse by
turning in his neighbors on the force. Besides, these people are his
link to his dreams. Hanging out with them is as close as he'll get to
being an NYPD officer. On the other hand, the corruption runs deep, and
the leaks in the coverup are being plugged with the bodies of innocent
people. 
The movie is intellectually engaging, but the "cop" aspect offers
nothing that you can't get on prime time TV. When Robert de Niro as the
archetypal "police chief" explodes in frustration, it is so much like
every other cop movie that you wonder if director Mangold is poking fun
at the genre or just being lazy. 
The movie takes itself seriously, and it is never lighthearted. Howard
Shore's music sets this tone very well (Shore also composed the haunting
score to CRASH.) The weighty, ponderous music is at times reminiscent of
Bernard Herrmann's CAPE FEAR, and at times it calls to mind the pure
dark tones of Philip Glass' KOYAANISQATSI. The music was very good, but
on the other hand, it may have promised more emotion than the rest of
the movie actually delivered. It seems wrong to fault a movie for having
TOO GOOD a score, but maybe a better match could have been made. 
Much has been said about Sylvester Stallone. He is trying to shed his
action-movie persona and get into meatier roles, starting with this one.
He isn't outstanding, but he is better than usual and better than most
people are giving him credit for. The most obvious difference in
Stallone is not the 20 pounds he gained, but the expression he wears on
his face. Instead of a hostile, indifferent scowl, he has a naďve,
insecure grin. 
Stallone is flat, but the role is not exactly dynamic. The character's
dream is to work as a New York City cop, and that dream can never be
fulfilled. But instead of setting new goals, Freddy plants himself as
close to New York as possible, on the outside looking in, trying to fit
in with those whose careers he admires. The character doesn't know how
to give up his youthful dreams, and so is living a self-doubting,
came-in-second life. A low-key approach to the character was called for,
and Stallone did fine. (Perhaps he found the story to be a parallel to
his own career. Maybe some defect kept him OUT OF the New York City,
andINthe New Jersey, of acting careers.) 
It's possible that Mangold didn't entirely trust Stallone with the
character of Freddy. The dialogue tells us how Freddy went deaf in one
ear, but we also see how it happened through flashback. The flashbacks
add to Freddy's character, but they have little to do with the story and
they seemed out of place. Maybe Mangold thought Stallone's Freddy needed
some extra depth (no pun intended). 
Still, a couple of scenes were very good and deserve to be mentioned.
Early on, a young NYPD cop who's drunk and off-duty, runs two men off
the road, killing them. The scene is intercut with Freddy, drunk and
off-duty, running into a deer, killing it. Each has accidentally taken
an innocent life, and they are equally branded by the same gash across
the nose. Another scene that showed some directorial ingenuity is told
from Freddy's aural point of view; we hear what Freddy hears. 
I could say a lot of nice things about Cop Land, but I can't recommend
it. The vital spark that pulls you in and makes you care about the movie
is missing. Many people really liked this movie, and a few despised it.
I just wish I had been that moved, either way.

Title
Review for Matrix, The (1999)
*** (out of 4) THE MATRIX is a great piece of eye candy. From our
normal, everyday "reality," the film travels back and forth into
Wonderland, and changes the definition of which is which.
Keanu Reeves is Mr. Anderson, a cubicle-dweller in an unconvincing
high-rise. His job, his life, and his caricatured boss are never
explained, and so the movie starts out flat and amateurish. It's
disappointing, but we know this soon won't matter, so we continue to
watch.
In his cube he receives a phone call that tells him to get out of the
building; the suits at the elevator are coming for him. Sure enough,
peering over his cube, he sees some men in black come his way. The voice
on the phone directs him to a window in the high rise, from which he's
supposed to make a difficult jump to a scaffolding. Realizing he has
nothing to hide and has no idea who the caller is, he wisely chucks the
phone and turns himself in to the suits.
For the first 20 minutes of the film, the suited "establishment" and the
vague "underground" fight for his attention and loyalty, warning him not
to join the other side. Neither side explains who they are or what they
want with him, but when the "underground" expose a bug planted in his
gut by the other side, he agrees to trust the underground. He is taken
to their leader, Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne). 
THE MATRIX packs a lot of mythology into its story. Readers of Joseph
Campbell, the scholar of comparative mythology, will recognize in
"Neo's" (Reeves') story, the traditional hero's journey -- the call to
adventure, the refusal of the call, the spirit guide, the special human
ability attained by those who open themselves to it....
So when Morpheus offers the choice of a red pill that leads to danger,
adventure, and self-awakening; or a blue pill that leads a safe,
comfortable return to the status quo; the age-old story has already
chosen for him. Anderson (his computer name is Neo) eats the red pill
and is reborn, both mythically and visually.
Through the looking-glass, Neo meets the half-dozen others who have gone
before him. The small band comprises those who have awoken from their
DREAM OF reality, into reality itself, a dark cloudy world a century
into "the future." In this reality, humans and artificial intelligence
are fighting for control of the planet, and for control of each other.
Neo, the chosen one, is prophesied to be the first who can beat the
computers on their own turf (that is, in the virtual reality that is the
Matrix).
I suppose this nerdly premise is partly borrowed from such sources as
DARK CITY and the TERMINATOR movies. Still, the concept is sufficiently
creepy to drive the plot, and the overlay of both ALICE IN WONDERLAND
and timeless mythology adds a dash of legitimacy to the otherwise
adolescent fantasy.
As I said, THE MATRIX is a great piece of eye candy, and credit should
go to the visual effects supervisor John Gaeta and cinematographer Bill
Pope. Although the unflavored modern world from the first scenes is
uninspired, the later settings -- the stark white void, the bleak future
underground, and the computer-enhanced "reality" are convincing,
interesting worlds.
The time-changing special effects are the next evolutionary step in
cinematic gimmickry. Watch a few commercials from the last year and
you'll see what I mean -- time stopping while the camera moves, or the
speed of time changing instantly. Until now, these tricks have not been
integrated in to a feature film. They've been used as tricks to catch
your eye to sell products. 
But the same way TERMINATOR 2 commanded the morphing technologies of the
day and actually did something with them, THE MATRIX commands these
time-shifting film tricks and folds them into a story.
Does that mean the film automatically deserves praise? Not necessarily.
But because it's the first big film to use this technique as part of its
story, it will be as important to film history, decades from now, as T2.
(In the short term, it means that Hollywood is going to need a new bag
of tricks.)
Pope (who has worked with the Wachowskis before, and with Sam Raimi)
does deserve praise. His mastery of the texture of light -- the
highlights, shadows, and reflections -- show such tight control that the
film would look just as beautiful in black and white (a feat that's
harder than you might imagine).  
So THE MATRIX must be an awesome movie, right?
Well... sort of. There are several things that keep THE MATRIX from
being perfect.
The first that comes to mind is the film's ending. Or rather, endings.
The first ending is a false one, and the second one has a coda. It's as
though the Wachowski brothers knew they were on a roll and didn't want
to stop. Worst of all is the final scene of the movie where "love" comes
into play from out of the blue.
Also lacking is the acting. Keanu is no Anthony Hopkins. It's not that
he spoils the movie -- he doesn't -- it's just a little hard to take him
seriously. Hugo Weaving (of THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE
DESERT) plays Agent Smith with a deliberately stylized persona. But even
so, his speech and mannerisms are slow, awkward, and distracting.
As for the film's message, there is an unhealthy moment (BEFORE we are
aware of the film's definition of "reality") where Mr. Anderson is told
that the world doesn't apply to him, that the world "has been pulled
over your eyes to hide the truth".
In other words, the world and all its rules, mores, and authority
figures are for everyone else, and not for him. In fact, the world is a
lie that must be DESTROYED if the truth is to be revealed. This talk
made me uneasy, particularly while the film was still in "our" reality.
If Mr. Anderson had any sociopathic tendencies, this might have
encouraged him to go postal. Watching, I knew the movie wouldn't pursue
that avenue, but the idea is disturbing enough, and THE MATRIX
illustrates it just a little too well.
So THE MATRIX must be a terrible movie, right?
Well... no. In fact, I think it's one of the better movies I've seen
this year. I liked it so much I hoped I could give it a very high
rating. But with so many things not quite right, I think it's only fair
to point them out. But if you are undeterred and are want to see it
anyway, I highly recommend it. See it on a big screen while you can. -

Review for Dante's Peak (1997)
While I was watching it, I loved Dante's Peak. It was a great
action/disaster movie with lots of interesting sequences, riveting
special effects, and likeable characters. Afterwards, the movie left my
mind completely. It didn't resonate with any interesting themes or
ideas; it was just a story, and it was done. But really, what else could
anyone ask from an action movie?  The effects-laden previews made this
movie look like Twister, which I did not like. Many critics have called
the two movies similar. Roger Ebert even outlines the "rules" for such
disaster movies in his review. But I disagree that adherence to the
genre necessarily makes a sub-par movie. Some formula movies work and
others don't. Dante's Peak works.
Pierce Brosnan plays Harry Dalton, a volcanologist from the U.S.
Geological Survey, who is sent to the perky little town of Dante's Peak.
Strange things are happening in Dante's Peak; or maybe they aren't.
That's what Harry has to find out. He arrives and hooks up with mayor
Rachel Wando (played by Linda Hamilton) who shows him around. The movie
spends some time getting to know Rachel, Harry, his colleagues, and the
town. The characters are likeable, largely because Brosnan and Hamilton
are so charismatic. And thankfully, as Andrea says, Rachel's kids aren't
too annoying, (as many movie kids are these days).
The movie really takes off, though, when the mountain blows. At first
there is panic among the townspeople and the panic is well-staged. Quite
often action sequences comprise a bunch of close-ups, cut together.
(That's cheaper, easier, and less interesting than actually spending
time to choreograph the sequence.) The confusion in Dante's Peak is not
entirely created through editing. There are actually carefully staged
wide shots of townspeople running and driving amok. The freeway at the
edge of town collapses and it looks like footage from the San Francisco
earthquake. A flood of water, ash, and logs sweeps down the mountain and
it looks like footage from Mt. St. Helens. Harry Dalton (the character)
is trapped in a cave-in and I fear for Pierce Brosnan's (the actor's)
safety.
After the preliminary eruption, the main characters rush from one
dangerous situation to the next, and each of these sequences is riveting
and frightening. The characters never do anything inhumanly stupid to
bring the danger on themselves (as characters often do in horror
movies), but there's always one more dangerous situation for the
characters to face. Having survived several close geologic encounters,
Harry and Rachel try to drive down off the mountain, only to discover
that the road is blocked by a lava flow. Driving on might get them stuck
in lava, but turning around might trap them on a doomed mountain. Credit
the writing of Leslie Bohem for keeping these situations tense without
feeling contrived, and for including enough of these vignettes to keep
the pace moving.
I assume that most of these situations were computer generated (like the
flood and the freeway collapse), and if it's true, these are the best
computer-generated graphics I have seen. They were crude at the
beginning of Dante's Peak (the peak is clearly inserted into the
backgrounds), interesting in Terminator 2 and passably believable in
Jurassic Park, but the flood scene in Dante's Peak looked frighteningly
real and the freeway collapse had me riveted. They didn't work
everywhere, like when the lava burst though the back wall of the cabin,
but perhaps for the first time, some of the computer graphics are
seamless.
This movie was crafted and not slapped together. There is some
interesting camera work during the setup of the movie. The camera, in
two parallel shots started on the face of a character, then pulled back
and swung around to reveal the whole scene. It's not much, but it showed
me that some care and thought were put into the movie. There was no
superheroism, no dumb luck, no coincidences, no token sex scenes, and no
irrelevant pop music sprinkled in as an excuse for a soundtrack. Also,
three PhDs were credited as advisors. I am not qualified to say if the
science was true to life, but it felt about right and it wasn't
condescending.
Although this movie may be totally forgotten in five years, it is great
entertainment.

Title
Review for Negotiator, The (1998)
*** (out of 4) DIE HARD is a good movie. True, it is formulaic, but it is
very well made by someone who really understands the genre. The same can be
said of THE NEGOTIATOR. 
For the first fifteen minutes, THE NEGOTIATOR looks like it's going to be
just another cop movie. Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson), the hero cop, is
introduced to us in an unoriginal set piece. A police negotiator, he talks
down a potential murder-suicide long enough for snipers to kill the man. The
badly-written press fawns over him, the hero of the day. His new wife wants
him to be more careful at work. 
His plot device, I mean partner, secretly tells him that he's heard some
crooked cops, in Roman's own precinct, have been stealing from the
disability fund, and that internal affairs is in on it too. Before they can
meet again to get specific, his partner is killed, and the murder AND
corruption are pinned on Roman. 
Roman marches into the office of internal affairs, just for a minute, to
demand answers. One thing leads to another, and Roman finds himself as a
hostage taker. He clears the floor of everyone but his four hostages: two
cops, a secretary in internal affairs, and a mediocre crook. 
It is here that the movie's pace picks up. Jackson starts to shine as the
smart, determined cop forced into an awkward situation. Roman knows exactly
what the officers will try to do, so he has the edge. He plays it up, taking
away the "eyes and ears" of the cops, and taunting and abusing the rookie
negotiator assigned to the case. 
The first thing Roman does is to demand that Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey) be
his negotiator. The two haven't met, but Roman knows Sabian works slow, and
he can't trust anyone in his own precinct. 
Spacey is a very good actor with a commanding presence, and when Sabian
shows up, his deliberateness and intensity make the local cops shrink. When
the locals botch a rescue attempt, his indignation is so fierce that even
the audience can't help but wince. 
Sabian is finally given full command of the situation. Roman, relieved, is
able to leverage some help from Sabian in finding the real embezzler. Sabian
is not Roman's lapdog, but he is reasonable, and Roman knows how to exploit
that. Slowly, with the calculated timing of a good mystery, evidence
clearing Roman starts to fall into place. Don't forget that this is an
action movie and not a mystery, so there are lots of bullet-ridden
interludes of the dirty cops trying to cover their tracks. But that is not
all there is to this movie. 
Once it got going, this movie really drew me in. Part of the reason is the
great performances by Jackson and Spacey. It's not much of an ensemble
movie, but the stars give standout performances. 
Another part is the well-paced, fleshed-out script by James DeMonaco and
Kevin Fox, two relative newcomers. The script is full of detail in the
construction of the conflict, the revelation of the real crook, and the
resolution of the story. In addition, the secondary characters are
well-chosen, well-written and (relatively) three-dimensional. 
Yet another part is the direction by F. Gary Gray, also a relative newcomer.
Gray deserves a lot of the credit for the pacing and intensity of the film. 
The only filmmaker who's not a newcomer is the cinematographer, Russell
Carpenter, who won an Oscar for TITANIC.He gave the film a cohesive, dark look. 
As I said, this film is good like DIE HARD (or SEVEN, for that matter): it
is well crafted by a director and screenwriters who really know how to work
in the genre. It surprised me to learn that they didn't have more
professional experience than they do, but hopefully they have earned
themselves some more work after THE NEGOTIATOR.

Review for Wag the Dog (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) WHY DOES A DOG WAG ITS TAIL? BECAUSE THE DOG IS SMARTER
THAN THE TAIL. IF THE TAIL WERE SMARTER, IT WOULD WAG THE DOG.
Thus opens Barry Levinson's sharp and cynical WAG THE DOG. 
The president of the United States has spent 3 minutes unsupervised in a
White House closet with a Campfire Girl, 11 days before the election.
His spin team has that much time to distract the public and keep the
Campfire scandal out of the headlines. 
Conrad Brean (Robert DeNiro), the chief spinner, decides that something
big is needed to distract the public for 11 full days. Something huge,
like a war. And if an event is not wagging the media, then one has to
use the media to wag the event. 
Rather than having the president declare war, Conrad has the president's
press secretary deny nonexistent rumors about a fictitious bomber. He
has the president's representatives apologize to the American People for
the secrecy demanded by national security. In short, he has the
president give the public something even more interesting than a
scandal: a secret. A secret so big that it's busting out at the seams. 
But Conrad's war has to be more than a few rumors if it is to last
eleven days. A good war has to have something memorable, something
catchy that people can support and remember, like the video footage of
the smart bombs in the gulf war, the five soldiers raising the flag at
Iwo Jima, or even "fifty-four forty or fight." So Conrad enlists movie
producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to provide him with some
visuals. In turn, Stanley enlists the aid of songwriter Johnny Green
(Willie Nelson) and a team of Hollywood's great creative thinkers. 
Once all the talent is lined up, the magic really starts to happen.
Songs are written, footage is staged, and rumors are leaked with all the
tight cohesion of reality. A soulful "We Are The World" anthem is
recorded with lyrics straight from the Declaration of Independence. A
video clip is manufactured of a young girl rescuing a kitten from bombs
and guns. All eyes and ears are on the president, but not because of his
whoopsie in the closet. The process appears to be working. 
Problems do arise, and they usually seem insurmountable. But after we
get to know Conrad and Stanley, nothing seems insurmountable. Each new
problem is met with optimism ("This is not a problem! This is nothing!")
and creativity. When the opposing candidate plays his own ace, Stanley
and Conrad trump him with a wild card. When the CIA has them in check,
Conrad convinces them they're playing the same color. In fact, Conrad
admits that he'd be a good chess player if he could only remember how
all the pieces are SUPPOSED to move. 
Stanley and Conrad are a lot of fun to watch. Both characters are
clearly on top of the situation at all times, and both are masters of
quick thinking. Each new obstacle makes you smile because you want to
see how they'll think their way around it. DeNiro and Hoffman both give
top-notch performances to these smart and invigorating characters. 
But the movie is not all good. Some of the problems are forgivable
little annoyances, like the misleading ease with which the team creates
video effects, or the dragging as the story nears the end. But there is
one real problem that affects the whole movie, and it is the ending. 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING, THEN STOP READING HERE.
In music, a "picardy third" is a major chord played at the end of a song
in a minor key. There is no opposite to a picardy third; it just doesn't
work to put a minor chord at the end of a major song. The same appears
to be true of movies. An audience will always go for an artificially
sweetened ending, but an unhappy ending on a comedy, even a sharply
cynical black comedy, is downright abusive.
WAG THE DOG plays as a black comedy right up to the end. The tone
undergoes a sudden and grave shift when we learn of the "heart attack"
of one of the movie's good guys. On top of that, it appears that a real
war is going to start in Albania. Wacky "Albania," that country with the
funny name, becomes the real Albania, a country in economic ruin that
can't afford any more trouble. 
The change seems deliberate, as if Levinson were trying to impart a
moral, but it doesn't work and it isn't necessary. The change is too
sudden and too drastic for it to be effective, and the movie is so full
of cynicism that its message was never in question. 
I imagine I'm overreacting to the ending. Most reviews I've read have
called WAG THE DOG a great movie, and for the most part, I agree. But
the tone of the last few minutes really made me feel jerked around. My
last response to the movie was confusion and annoyance. 
Then again, maybe that was Levinson's intent.

Title
Review for Endless Summer, The (1966)
*** (out of 4) Brown loves to surf. It was his dream to spend one year
surfing, switching hemispheres as the seasons changed, and circling the
globe in the process. This documentary gave him the perfect excuse to
fulfill his dream. The title refers to the year in his life when, for
him, summer would never end. 
Along the way, we learn a little about surfboards and waves. What types
of waves are the best? Little curly ones that don't collapse. What does
great surfing mean? Long rides. 
But more interesting is the human story. 
The tone of the film is a little staged and familiar at first. Brown
seems like a big self-assured lug going for cheap clever laughs. He
realizes he has a movie camera and sets up a couple of visual gags, as
if that's what one is expected to do with a camera. But as he moves
around the globe, the novelty of the camera wears off and his wonder and
enjoyment grow. He stops TRYING so hard, which is for the best, because
the adventure he is living is enough for the camera. 
He arrives on the west coast of Africa with his two "stars" and
companions. Blond, white, well-dressed, and carrying 10-foot surfboards,
they stand out like a couple of sore thumbs. They catch some waves at a
nearby beach and are mobbed by locals (adults and children) who have
never seen a surfboard, much less a person riding one. The surfers let
their "hosts" try the boards, which are such a fascinating novelty that
they fear the locals won't give them back. This first encounter is a
real culture shock and it makes them grow up fast. What little "we're
Americans so respect us" attitude they started with, goes away fast. 
As they travel south along the coast, they gradually become more
streetwise, more confident, and more mature. 
In the most memorable scene of the film, the two surfers find the most
perfect spot on the globe for surfing. It is a little beach in South
Africa, miles away from the nearest civilization, only accessible by
walking 20 minutes from the road across some sand dunes. The spot itself
is pretty, but to the average viewer, it is no more amazing than any
other spot on earth. To these surfers, it is paradise. Their
enthusiastic declaration that it is the best surfing in the world makes
us feel privileged to have seen it and sorry not to have been there in
person (especially in light of what became of the spot . . . but more on
that in the next review). 
The movie is a favorable cross between a home movie and a serious
documentary. Bruce Brown's personality is apparent from the pranks he
pulls at the beginning, and through his more serious evaluations of
friendships and waves. But the movie is also long enough and of a broad
enough scope to be taken seriously. The mix is very effective. The
storyteller's personal enthusiasm for the subject matter is contagious,
and it makes both Brown and surfing much more interesting. In fact, it
will probably make you want to try surfing. 
Not many of us get to fulfill the kind of dream that Brown fulfilled by
making this movie. He knew he was lucky to be making THE ENDLESS SUMMER,
and by the end, he seems genuinely grateful for the chance. The year of
the endless summer was clearly the best year of his life, and we got to
see it all. 
He was a wonderful tour guide for one of the most interesting tours on
film.

Title
Review for Face/Off (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) Of all the John Woo movies I've seen, THE KILLER is the
most fascinating. It is difficult to watch because of all the blood and
violence, but it seems Woo chose violence as his medium, not his
message. The violence is the texture of the movie, not the movie itself. 
Since coming to America, his movies seem pretty tame by comparison. I
haven't seen his first U.S. film, HARD TARGET, but BROKEN ARROW and
FACE/OFF both seem much more polished and mainstream than THE KILLER.
Woo still includes tons of bullets, big explosions, and thematic
descants that float above the violence on-screen, but the violence is no
longer non-stop. It is no longer the canvas; it is now the flourish. 
In trying to appreciate Woo on his own level, it seemed that his whole
purpose, like Quentin Tarantino's in RESERVOIR DOGS, was to take the
violence inherent in the action genre and carry it so far that no action
movie could ever be viewed the same again. Rather than continuing that
experiment, Woo is now just making action movies. 
Woo does have a talent for making action movies, and many of his
signature pieces grace FACE/OFF. One brutal gunfight is partially shown
from a child's point of view, both visually and aurally, giving the
scene an emotionally confusing feel. There's also plenty of Woo's
trademark, a mutually-assured-destruction standoff, each participant
holding a gun to the other's head. 
FACE/OFF is smarter than many other action movies, but it lacks heart.
It's interesting to ponder, but it doesn't suck you in. 
Sean Archer (John Travolta) works for a secret anti-terrorism branch of
the government. He's tracking Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), a notorious
criminal who has planted a bomb somewhere in L.A. After losing a game of
cat-and-mouse, Castor goes into a coma, unable to talk (and therefore,
unable to tell Archer the location of the bomb). Archer's last hope is
to somehow convince Castor's brother Pollux to talk. 
Like their mythological namesakes, Castor and Pollux are very close
brothers, and Archer knows Pollux would never squeal. A new
"morphogenetic" mask, however, along with a computer chip implanted in
the larynx, would allow Archer to perfectly adopt the look and sound of
Castor, allowing Archer to get close enough to Pollux to learn the
location of the bomb. A modern-day Trojan horse. 
The plot takes an interesting twist when Castor wakes up without a face.
He and his cronies strongarm the doctors into putting Archer's face onto
Castor, and now the roles are completely reversed, and the bad guys have
the upper hand. 
It really does sound like it should be a good movie, and there are lots
of details that are well executed. For example, Nicolas Cage does a
wonderful job at playing John Travolta. All of the facial expressions we
got used to in GET SHORTY and PULP FICTION are copied exactly by Cage.
During a later standoff, Castor and Archer have trapped each other on
opposite sides of a mirror, an interesting metaphor for their
switcheroo. The Trojan War references that run through the movie are
interesting too - It was an archer who found the weakness in and killed
Achilles; pay attention to how Archer finally finishes off his nemesis. 
In fact, there are many aspects of FACE/OFF that can be praised, from
the careful costume design (Cage wears a big black billowing cape and a
blood red silk shirt), to the cool gross face effects. 
But one has to wonder if Woo's talent doesn't translate to Hollywood as
well as it could. The speed boat sequence at end was top notch, but the
stunt doubles didn't really match the actors (it'll play better on your
TV). The fight scenes were more edited and less choreographed than I
expected and hoped from Woo. Worst of all, FACE/OFF lacks that essential
spark that draws you in and makes you care about the outcome of the
movie. 
I'm starting to wonder if Woo is slipping or if I'm remembering his Hong
Kong films too flatteringly.

Title
Review for Dîner de cons, Le (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4) THE DINNER GAME is a lightweight French comedy from
Francis Veber, who is best known for writing LA CAGE AUX FOLLES, remade
in the U.S. as THE BIRDCAGE. THE DINNER GAME starts with a good recipe,
follows it closely, and serves it up in an appropriate (if cheap) dish.
The only thing wrong is that it's all dessert.
Mr. Brouchant belongs to a club of successful former frat boys. The club
meets each Wednesday, and each member must bring one idiot. Whoever's
idiot is the most long-winded and boring, wins. The movie introduces a
few examples of prize dates: a bank teller with an opinion on
everything, a boomerang collector, and a man who makes elaborate models
out of matchsticks. 
Brouchant's pick of the week is Mr. Pignon, the matchstick modeler. He
invites Pignon over to his house for drinks before dinner, but that
afternoon, he throws out his back playing golf. His doctor says he has
to stay home and rest.
Pignon shows up for drinks anyway, and Brouchant marvels at what a
perfect idiot he is. Not only does he go on and on about his matchstick
models, but he gets confused over the simplest conversational turns. He
is a grade-A, prize idiot.
The plot takes off from here at a steady pace that keeps increasing as
the movie races toward the end. First Brouchant's wife calls to dump
him, and Pignon wants to be a shoulder to cry on. Then Brouchant's
girlfriend calls and invites herself over, and Pignon volunteers to try
to keep her away. All the while, Pignon's "help" invariably makes things
worse. Brouchant keeps saying "au revoir" but Pignon always finds one
more reason to stay.
Eventually, what should have been a relaxing evening at home for the
ailing Brouchant, becomes a chaotic scene with Pignon, an old friend,
his wife, his wife's boyfriend, his girlfriend, and a tax auditor who
works with Pignon.
A complex comedic plot like this needs to have an ending that is not
contrived, and Veber comes up with something that caps it all off,
without coming across as DEUS EX MACHINA. It is the best possible ending
for this film.
The direction, also by Veber, is competent. The greatest directorial
challenge in a movie like this is to keep the plot moving ahead,
constantly accelerating. The pace can't slow down for a second, and
Veber handles this task very well. He also coaxes some good performances
out of his actors. I'm not familiar with any of the cast, but nobody was
wooden or amateurish. Each character was solid, "believable," and true
to the world of the script.
The most serious flaw of THE DINNER GAME is its feather weight. The
whole thing is insubstantial and meaningless. The sets and lighting are
stagey, like a play or a studio sitcom. The comedic extremes to which
the plot goes are so silly that they can't be taken seriously. As funny
and well written as it is, it's still a throwaway movie.
I found sitting through THE DINNER GAME to be enjoyable and amusing, but
I really got nothing out of it, which ultimately makes me like it less.
You could say THE DINNER GAME is all dessert and no main course.

Title
Review for Kiss the Girls (1997)
** (out of 4) Forgive me for being blunt, but KISS THE GIRLS is a sexist
and chauvinistic movie. 
The movie introduces Detective Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist,
talking down a suicide attempt (damsels rescued: 1). It also introduces
us to the bad guy leaving a woman to the wolves, tied to a tree in the
middle of a forest. The movie introduces us to one more person, Kate
McTiernan, who is already a doctor at the age of about 24, so it
appears. She specializes in brain trauma, so it's ironic that she's also
a kickboxer. (Maybe it's her way of drumming up clientele.) 
Turns out that Cross' niece has been abducted recently, probably by the
bad guy we saw at the beginning. Cross takes a few days off from his
duties in Washington D.C. to see if he can help the boys in North
Carolina with his niece's case. He learns that one of the kidnapper's
M.O.s is that he targets strong women. 
Not too long after that, Kate is abducted by the faceless bad guy, in
spite of her kickboxing ability. He puts her in a cave-like room where
Kate hears several other women being held. (Nine "strong" women are no
match for one man.) The kidnapper psychologically torments the women. He
breaks their wills and forces them to submit. But before Kate's will is
completely gone, too much luck and not enough strength allow her to
escape the cave system into the surrounding wilderness. When she is
finally cornered, she doesn't kick the kidnapper in the groin like she
learned in class. Instead she jumps into a raging stream, taking her
chances with the elements. 
THIS PARAGRAPH GIVES AWAY BITS OF THE ENDING. Cross and Kate become the
team that will investigate the crimes and track down the kidnapper. When
it comes time to face the kidnapper, Cross singlehandedly rescues the
nine "strong" women (damsels rescued: 10). But the movie has a coda. The
bad guy slipped away and at the end, Kate will face her captor one last
time. "Strong" kickboxing Kate will face a stabbed, lacerated bad guy
and still require another man to rescue her (damsels rescued: 11! Hooray
for the men! Our women are safe!) 
To be fair, I didn't hate this movie. It was no worse than many
mainstream films. There was even a scene or two that made me jump in
surprise. But the movie was so careless that I couldn't forgive it. 
For example, Cross is a forensic psychologist, but he knows more about a
drug that the kidnapper uses than our medical doctor (she is only a
woman, though). 
Also, Cross made some major mistakes in dealing with his psychologically
abused victims. The kidnapper spoke to them without revealing his face.
His was a calm, faceless voice. When Kate is rescued, one of the first
things Cross does is approach her from behind in a calm reassuring
voice, just like the kidnapper did. Another victim was forced to play
her violin for her kidnapper. After her rescue, cross gives her a new
violin. Just what a traumatized victim needs: a little reminder of her
torture. 
Finally, in Cross' raid on the kidnapper's hideout, he says that logic
dictates there should be no FBI involvement. He never explains why this
is so, and he was probably wrong. But then he couldn't be the knight in
shining armor, could he? 
In addition, the filmmaking was uneven. The movie did have a good "look"
to it, but it was often disrupted by a single bad element. For example,
the cave-rooms where the women were held looked like they were recycled
from the original Star Trek TV series. And there were times when the
sound editing was clunky and unsubtle. 
I suppose this movie could have earned a lower rating, but somehow, all
these flaws didn't congeal until after the movie was over, so the
experience itself wasn't that bad. Still, that's hardly a reason to see
this movie.

Title
Review for Big Lebowski, The (1998)
***1/2 (out of 4) I've never been a huge fan of Jeff Bridges, but I loved
him in THE BIG LEBOWSKI. The part of Jeff "The Dude" Lebowski was reportedly
written specifically with Bridges in mind, and the fit is perfect. 
The Dude is an unemployed denizen of Los Angeles, a hippie slob on a bowling
team with a soft spot for white russians. He's enjoying a leisurely soak in
the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the
money his wife owes. After much pleading he convinces them they have the
wrong guy, but not before they urinate on his rug. 
The Dude assumes that these "collection agents" were after another Jeff
Lebowski, a famous millionaire who also lives in L.A. so he goes to meet his
namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug. 
The millionaire refuses, but calls him back when he discovers his wife has
been kidnaped. He wants The Dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers.
Dude and his friend Walter (John Goodman) take on the task, and get caught
in an intricate web of kidnapers, millionaires, high schoolers, nihilists,
artists, pornographers, thugs, and league bowlers. 
Comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres, so take my recommendation
as you will: for me, THE BIG LEBOWSKI is very funny. It is an incredibly
successful comedy, the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in
most films. Not only are the two leads (Bridges and Goodman) funny
separately and together, but each supporting character is a refreshing comic
figure. 
All the characters end up as the butt of jokes, but the jokes are always
deserved and never contrived. Each person may be a comic caricature, but
there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these
people without condescension. The characters are firmly established, and
they never change their behavior for a quick, cheap laugh. It's not what
they DO that's funny, it's who they are, which is why the acting is so
important, and so successful, in this movie. 
Worth mentioning are John Turturro as Jesus (that's JEE-zus, not hay-SOOS),
the greaser bowler who's in a lusty marriage with the game; Julianne Moore
as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as "vaginal;"
Steve Buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and
ignored by teammates Dude and Walter; and Sam Elliott as the rambling,
long-winded narrator. 
Aside from the performances, what makes all the characters funny and
interesting is the astute dialogue. People lose trains of thought, they
interrupt, they boast, they repeat themselves, they repeat their friends...
they sound natural. Taken with FARGO, the Coen Brothers' last film, it is
evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers. 
Ethan Coen is not just good at directing actors, he's also good at technical
directing. He and cinematographr Roger Deakins created a beautiful world on
film. Perhaps "beautiful" is the wrong word; nihilists, carpet-pissers and
thugs are not objects of beauty. But the bowling photography and a series of
viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed, as though
The Dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film. 
All around, THE BIG LEBOWSKI is great, solid comedy. Outstanding acting,
writing, direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic
success.

Title
Review for Instinct (1999)
** (out of 4) INSTINCT is that odd movie that is thought-provoking and
worth talking about, yet is still somehow bad. 
INSTINCT is "suggested by" Daniel Quinn's book ISHMAEL, in which a
talking gorilla takes a human student. Using the Socratic method, he
teaches the student to see humanity, materialism, development, and human
culture, through the eyes of a simpler, less greedy soul. Most of the
book is filled with their telepathic conversation. It's pretty
unfilmable stuff.
Naturally, INSTINCT diverges from the book in many ways. The "teacher"
is now Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins), the anthropologist who has just
been found after disappearing for two years. During that time he lived
among a tribe of African gorillas. He has not spoken since his return to
civilization.
The "student" is now Theo (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a psychiatrist just
completing his residency. Theo hears about Ethan and is intrigued. He
pulls every string he has in order to get Ethan's case. (The "Socratic
method" is now a power trip, complete with death threats.) 
Screenwriter Gerald Di Pego (who also wrote Turteltaub's PHENOMENON)
does a great job of introducing Theo's character. His ingenious gamble
helps a paranoid patient have a breakthrough. And yet the scene is still
formulaic. Replace "psychiatrist" with "hostage negotiator" and you'd
have the same opening scene as two or three cop movies in the last year.
This pattern of small pockets of greatness in an otherwise bad script is
repeated throughout the movie.
Theo gives an emotional speech at the end. Gooding gives a top-notch
performance, and the actions of his character make the speech seem
appropriate. But the specific words of his speech sound so written and
hollow, that it's almost hard to take it seriously. 
Much of the movie takes place in a psychiatric prison, where a random
system is used for determining who gets fresh air privileges. But the
system is such that the strong can attack the weak and steal the
privilege, making the dysfunctional patients seem even more animal-like.
The whole prison seems to be a system of dominance and submission, so
that watching the movie is much like studying aggression in animals. But
the characters are treated as human props. They aren't well developed.
Their few actions are motivated by the script and not by any emotional
soul.
It's hard to go wrong on the cinematography when you have a lush jungle
to film. But when Anthony Hopkins breasts the utopian green hilltop, it
seems like stock footage from a time-share sales pitch. It's too easy
and obvious and it doesn't add to the character or the film.
One final point is worth noting. Danny Elfman composed the score for
this film. Usually, when Elfman is involved, you can tell by listening.
For the BATMAN movies he scored circus music into his orchestra. For A
SIMPLE PLAN he had the violins play just off-key enough to make you
squirm. But in INSTINCT, there is no quirk, no distinctive signature. It
seemed like a waste of Elfman's particular talents.
In all fairness, I found this movie to be a great conversation piece.
All the sparkling good ideas were memorable enough to grab onto and
examine more closely. But that's not enough to recommend it.
Turteltaub's last movie was PHENOMENON, which was a melodramatic drop of
syrup that I savored (yes, more than once.) But INSTINCT is somehow
harder to swallow. I couldn't tell if you if it was too sweet or too
insubstantial, but somehow, the recipe just wasn't right.

Title
Review for Pushing Tin (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) It is well known that air traffic controllers have one
of the most stressful jobs there is. So it seems odd that before now,
they haven't shown up as the subjects of a movie. 
John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton break onto the screen as two
interesting specimens. Both are at the top of their field, though each
takes a different approach to his job.
Nick (Cusack) is extroverted and fun-loving. He has nervous tics and
can't handle driving below the speed limit. He's an alpha-male
overachiever, a grown-up kid who loves the stress and challenges of his
job.
During the film's setup, we catch a glimpse of what goes on in his mind
while he's working. The simple blips on the controller's screen
transform themselves into an active, dynamic 3-D computer simulation
when he's "in the zone."
Once we get a feel for the fast-paced, close-knit camaraderie of the
control room, the film introduces us to Bell (Thornton). He's the new
kid on the job with a killer rep. Rumors that he stood under a landing
747 to ride the turbulence turn out to be true. But unlike Nick, he's
always cool under pressure. He's just as good as Nick, but he doesn't
wear his adrenalin on his sleeve.
Nick is thrown off-balance by the arrival of Bell. Having someone equal
to him in the control room shakes him deeply, and he doesn't know how to
react. He's jealous of Bell. He doesn't dislike or begrudge him, but he
can't let go of the fact that someone else might be as good as or better
than him.
An unspoken competitive tension exists between the two characters --
mostly in Nick, but kept alive by Bell. Their tension is a spark waiting
for some fuel, say three bottles of vodka and several glasses of wine,
to ignite it.
Nick finds Bell's buxom wife Mary (played by the big-lipped Angelina
Jolie) crying in the supermarket with mostly vodka in her cart. She's
looking for sympathy and he's looking to give it. Since neither spouse
is home, the two end up in an Italian restaurant sharing lots of stories
and too much wine. Nick valiantly offers to follow her home, just to be
sure she gets there safely. One thing inevitably leads to another, and
the two end up in bed together.
Bell finds out what happened and reacts with his usual calm. Although
he's calm, he still manages to get back at Nick by insinuating some
cross-cheating with Nick's wife. These mind games make Nick jealous and
confused, as they were no doubt intended to.
The plot wanders away from its two main characters before it takes a
firm shape. Just when you think the film is entirely about Nick and Bell
and their wives, screenwriters Glenn Charles and Les Charles (of
"Cheers" fame) introduce a horribly transparent plot device. A bomb
threat is called in and the shift supervisor says "I need two" (what a
coincidence) "good men to stay and man the scopes!"
After that, it's hardly worth tracking the plot. The bomb threat clears.
Nick's wife Connie (Cate Blanchett, underused in this role) eventually
learns of his infidelity. Nick's paranoia about Bell comes to a head.
There are two or three "endings," none of which really feels like it
wraps up the whole movie.
Suffice it to say everything works out in the end for everyone, after
Nick undergoes a contrived catharsis that doesn't even make sense
emotionally.
PUSHING TIN is borderline recommendable. With such a confused and
contrived final act, the movie leaves you with a bad taste. But it CAN
be worth the price of admission, if you're not going for the plot.
Go because of the well-formed, well written characters. Go because of
the funny, solid camaraderie of the air traffic controllers. Go because
Cusack is surprisingly good and Thornton is predictably good. Go with
forgiveness in your heart, save some for the ending, and have a good
time.

Review for Air Force One (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) A Los Angeles office building. A group of violent
terrorists. One man stands in their way - a tough New York cop. Die
Hard! 
A military vessel. A group of violent terrorists. One man stands in
their way - a former Navy SEAL. Under Siege! 
A presidential airborne fortress. A group of violent terrorists. One man
stands in their way - The President of the United States of America(?).
Air Force One! 
This formula has gone too far. A cop, okay. A Navy SEAL, alright. A
president, don't be silly. 
Because I was expecting IN THE LINE OF FIRE II, I was surprised and
insulted by the premise. The president as an action hero? What nonsense!
A president who's been through the political meat grinder with his
youthful idealism intact? Don't make me gag! 
You should know that this movie is an action movie, not a thriller. It
is closer to CON AIR than it is to IN THE LINE OF FIRE. The plot and the
details are cartoonish, not psychological. Now, with that in mind, AIR
FORCE ONE is pretty good. But it is not subtle or intellectual. 
Part of why I expected a smart thriller is because the director is
Wolfgang Petersen, director of DAS BOOT, a claustrophobic look at life
aboard a WWI German U-boat, and of IN THE LINE OF FIRE, an exciting
cat-and-mouse thriller. Petersen's latest, OUTBREAK, was a lot closer to
an action movie than a thriller, and it looks like he has finally fully
crossed over now with AIR FORCE ONE. 
There is a surprising similarity between AIR FORCE ONE and many of
Petersen's previous films. One of the first people we see is Jürgen
Prochnow, who played the Captain in DAS BOOT. Both settings (this movie
and DAS BOOT) are tight, closed, and finite. The airplane's defenses are
highlighted and even look similar to those of the U-boat. And like the
climactic scene in IN THE LINE OF FIRE, an F-14 puts itself between AFO
and a Russian missile, like some valiant winged secret service agent. 
If Petersen really is migrating away from thrillers, he's not a bad
action director. In fact, there are a few very tense sequences in AFO
that really stand out. An early attempt at landing AFO incorporates
tension from the ground rescue crew, the pilot, the terrorists, and the
President's cabinet. There is also an awesome non-stunt involving a
lifeline between two aircraft. 
There is a spark of an idea in this movie that could have proved
interesting, had it been played up - Ford's president is a lot like
Oldman's terrorist. In the opening scene, President Marshall delivers an
anti-terrorism speech. He vows to use whatever force is necessary to
defend what he knows is morally right. It is this absolute moral
certainty that makes him no better than Ivan Korshunov. Korshunov says
"you have just handed my country over to gangsters and prostitutes;" he
is as morally certain and rightfully indignant as Marshall. In
Marshall's stated moral landscape, this is all the justification
Korshunov needs to commit violent acts. Marshall is the victim of one
who shares his own morality. How beautifully ironic the situation, and
how disappointing that Petersen didn't do more with it. 
Further, when the terrorist's demands have been met, Korshunov does not
keep his end of the bargain; he doesn't release the hostages. Okay, he's
the bad guy. That's expected. But when the "Good guys" finally get the
upper hand, they behave no better, gunning down a man who has just been
freed from prison. 
Petersen didn't really explore this hypocrisy, but at least he left it
open by giving the terrorist some understandable motives and some
legitimate gripes. Still, the idea is obscured, if not lost, through the
haze of testosterone morality and action movie justice. 
Because I was expecting more, I was a little disappointed by AFO. On the
other hand, Petersen is a good action director, and if you keep that in
mind, you'll probably enjoy this movie.

Review for Antz (1998)
*** (out of 4) If you think Disney animated features have been getting
stale lately, give ANTZ a try. ANTZ is the first animated feature put
out by DreamWorks SKG, (not affiliated with Disney). As such, it has
more freedom to target an audience older than 6. It is hipper and
funnier than anything Disney has put out for years.
Woody Allen provides the voice of Z, our hero. Z doesn't fit in with the
crowd and wants to find a way to express his individuality. Not an easy
task when you're an ant.
Z is sulking in the saloon when Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) shows up,
slumming with her palace friends. Bala asks Z to dance with her, and he
accepts. While the entire bar dances together in lock-step, Z starts to
dance to his own drummer, and even convinces Bala to cut loose with him.
But it's not long before Bala has to return to the palace. 
The dance was enough to energize Z, and he takes the first opportunity
he can to trade places with his soldier-ant friend Weaver (Sylvester
Stallone). As a soldier, he will get to parade in front of the royal
family and see princess Bala again.
The switch goes well until the soldiers are sent out on a suicide
mission against the termites. Luckily for Z, his cowardice makes him
hide during the massacre (in a battle scene eerily reminiscent of last
year's STARSHIP TROOPERS). The lone survivor, Z returns to the colony,
where he is hailed as a war hero, and is given entree to the royal
court. After being exposed as a worker ant, Z ends up accidentally
kidnaping the princess and escaping the colony.
Since he can't return, he starts walking, half hoping the rumors of a
far-off "Insectopia" are true. Even if they're not, as long as he and
Bala are together, Z will be happy. But General Mandible (Gene Hackman)
wants Bala back in the colony and he wants Z destroyed....
ANTZ has two very simple things going for it: the animation and the
writing. Both are far enough above average to make this movie very
entertaining.
The animation is all computer generated. We've seen that before in
Disney's TOY STORY. What we haven't seen before is the uncanny depth
rendered on film for this movie. The CG ants look as though they were
filmed and not printed.
The ant colony in this film is full of earthy colors and lifelike
textures that are much more subdued than the garish, shiny, plastic
surfaces of TOY STORY. It's a more subtle, mature use of CG, and it's
the next step in CG evolution.
The writing, too, has matured compared to Disney's latest cartoons. When
I say the writing is better, I don't mean the story line. If you squint
your eyes so the specific details are blurred, you might mistake ANTZ
for last year's HERCULES. Both have your basic hero on your basic quest.
Both have a fairly superficial love interest and chummy, amusing
sidekicks..
When I say the writing is good, I mean that screenwriters Todd Alcott
and Chris and Paul Weitz, working within the genre of the animated
feature, have added personality and edge. (Credit also those who cast
Woody Allen in the lead role.)
Allen is allowed a one or two minute rant at the film's opening that
made me laugh out loud. He rambles on about his usual New York neuroses,
only this time he's an ant. He's allowed to stumble over his words or
get flustered, and the animation keeps up with his verbal quirks.
Instead of a bland, vanilla hero, we get one with a little flavor to
him.
Allen's lines are inevitably laced with bug-related puns, just as in
HERCULES there were mythological puns. But the Antz puns, tailor-made
for Woody Allen, work on more than one level. They are funny not so much
because they're puns, but because they're things Allen would say if he
were an ant (like when he credits his psychologist for putting him in
touch with his inner maggot). Allen has a surprisingly large number of
these lines, and most of them work.  
ANTZ is not an earthshaking movie, but it is fun. The animation,
writing, and casting are all above average, and the time (all 82
minutes) flies by. There wasn't a scene that dragged, which is quite an
accomplishment.
And hey, if you're a fellow Disney cynic, you can revel in a cartoon
unmarred by schmaltzy love ballads, white-bread heroes, and
source-mangling storylines!

Review for Local Hero (1983)
**** (out of 4) LOCAL HERO is one of my all-time favorite movies. I can
watch it again and again, year after year. Each time I see something
new, and each time I see something familiar. It is my yearly pilgrimage
to Scotland to visit old friends and homey places. 
The setting is a charming small town called Ferness. The town is
geographically and economically isolated. It conists of a small row of
houses, pressed between a cliff and the sea. There is a pub, a tiny
hotel, a church, and one red phone box. 
The inhabitants of Ferness are good, kind, small-town folk. Fishermen
pull a living from the sea and everyone else makes a living however they
can, doubling up on jobs when necessary. They may appear quirky at
first, but once you get to know them, they are no more unusual than your
own friends and family. 
Ferness sounds like an idyllic town, ripe for a fairy tale. The film
does indeed start out that way. There is an uncaring villain who works
for corporate developers. There is a town full of peasants in danger of
losing their charming homes, their rustic land, their simple livelihood
to make way for big business. There is even a mermaid. 
What ACTUALLY happens is less a fairy tale and more human nature. 
A big oil company sets out to buy the scenic little town on a bay in
north Scotland. It plans to replace the town with an oil refinery.
The oil company sends "Mac" MacIntyre (Peter Riegert) from acquisitions
to buy the land. (He's actually Polish, but he's got the right name for
the job.) He'd rather deal over the phone, but the company insists he be
on-site. He arrives and meets Danny (Peter Capaldi), his assistant while
in Scotland, and Marina (Jenny Seagrove), a marine biologist working for
the Aberdeen branch of Knox Oil, who wants to turn the bay into a marine
sanctuary. (She knows nothing of the company's plans, and wouldn't
believe them even if she knew.)
Mac and Danny head up to Ferness where they meet Gordon Urquhart (Denis
Lawson), hotel proprietor, accountant, and barkeep. Mac confirms to
Gordon the rumor that the the oil company wants to buy all of Ferness.
He entrusts Gordon, as the local accountant, to meet with the populace
and work out some numbers for the purchase of the town. In the meantime,
Gordon suggests that Mac take a look around; get to know the place.
Mac spends the day settling in and walking around the beach in his suit
and tie with Danny trailing behind. They spot an old man in the
distance, doing the same. 
The townspeople of this paradise are thrilled at the chance to sell
their land and become instant millionaires. That night, when Mac has to
call home, he learns his name and reputation have preceeded him. He has
become a local hero to these people he'll make rich, and they instantly
take a liking to him. 
The next day Mac has lightened up a bit. He still has his suit on, but
he fits in better. The locals are starting to accept him as part of the
population, and he's even learned a name or two. Eventually Mac slips
farther and farther into the local life. Each scene shows Mac in less
and less formal clothes as he grows more and more fond of Ferness.
Meanwhile, Gordon carries on the business of arranging for the sale of
the land. 
As the deal draws near, the locals call a ceilidh (pronounced "Kay-Lee",
it means town meeting) to socialize and talk about the deal. Everyone
gets drunk and talks about how they will spend their millions. Grizzled
fishermen argue over the relative merits of Mazzeratis and Ferraris. 
Everyone has a great time with the POSSIBLE exception of Mac. Mac has
grown to love this town and its people. The ceilidh only cements the
sense of community that Mac wants in his life, that only the undeveloped
village could provide. Ironically, he will be the destroyer of the
village, and even more ironically, he will be the only one who feels its
loss.  
At the emotional apex of the story, Mac, uninhibited with drink, asks
Gordon to trade with him. Everything. The car, the house, the job. Mac
wants to trade his Porsche, his six-figure salary, and his stock
options, for Gordon's life in Ferness, doing odd jobs, running the
hotel, being the local bartender, and living a simple life. Nothing
comes of the proposition, but it is the point when Mac sheds his shell
and bares his soul. 
The deal is nearly sealed when, the next day, Mac and Gordon get a
shock. Ben (Fulton Mackay), the old man who walks the beach, actually
OWNS the beach, and he won't sell. Mac's boss, Mr. Happer (Burt
Lancaster) flies to Ferness to close the deal himself. 
Happer and Ben, who share an interest in astronomy, become fast friends
and somehow, Old Ben manages to change Happer's mind, at least about the
refinery. Happer still wants to acquire the site, but not to destroy it.
He wants to build an observatory, an institute for scientific research.
Marina was right all along. 
Nearly everyone is happy with Happer's new arrangement. The townspeople
will still get to sell their property. Happer gets his bay. Ben keeps
his beach. Marina gets her laboratory, and Danny gets Marina. 
But not everyone wins. In the most devastating moment of the film,
Happer tells Mac to pack up and head back to Houston immediately to take
care of business from that end. It becomes painfully clear how far Mac
has fallen in love with Ferness-when he gets the order to return, he is
in a sweater, he has five o'clock shadow, and he's eating an orange that
Ben found on the beach. When the film cuts to him in his creaseless suit
and crisp tie, we understand what a transformation he had undergone
while in town.
Mac obeys his boss, but before he leaves he puts his outer shell back
on. He insists on paying for his stay at the hotel, he shaves, he
dresses properly, and his businesslike manner almost conceals the
disappointment in his face. 
He walks into his cold, cramped, fluorescent apartment, smells the sea
shells he brought back, and hangs up the snapshots he took of Ferness. 
He steps out on the balcony and looks out at the bleak neon skyline of
Houston, with its traffic and sirens, longing for the friendly open
streets of Ferness. 
Mac can't return and see Ferness. Work will presumably keep him in
Houston, and development will soon forever change the place.
But I can go back, year after year, and I do. With each viewing, the
simple joy of life at Ferness, and the transitory pricelessness of that
particular time and place becomes more and more dear.

Review for Zbogum na dvadesetiot vek (1998)
With Being John Malkovich getting such rave reviews, it just might be
possible that surrealism is making a comeback. That would be good news
for the creators of Goodbye 20th Century.
Goodbye 20th Century is a Macedonian film -- one of only 6 listed in the
IMDB. At first glance it looks like an American action film wannabe. A
band of armed men in black leather wander a desolate hillside. Before
anyone speaks, you might almost expect another Mad Max movie.
But it soon becomes clear that this is no Hollywood film. The angled
shots and extreme closeups look either like footage from an amateur
camera-nerd, or a surrealist playing with perspective. It becomes clear
that the latter is the actual case when a white-robed figure is shot,
but not killed. The stunned, would-be killers empty their guns into this
humble, dream-like, invincible man. Eventually, the murderous mob
decides to let their victim go with just a warning.
There is a circular plot to the film -- it eventually ends where it
began, but not before a second act is played out. This second act is
even more surreal than the first, taking place in a completely white
room with people dressed for a funeral. Our hero -- the character with
whom we empathize -- is apparently as confused by the random actions of
the funeral-goers as I was. This act finally ends as a Santa Claus
figure goes on a shooting spree in this pure-white world.
There are so many more details I could mention, but I have no idea how
to work them into any sort of review.
As you may have guessed, I was more confused than enthralled by this
movie. I did see some artistic merit in the staging and execution of
some of the dreamier scenes. I could appreciate the circular structure
of the film and the strumming of timeless themes. But I couldn't tell
you what it was "about."
Nor, unfortunately, could I tell you why you should see it.

Title
Review for Fifth Element, The (1997)
*** (out of 4)  The trailers for The Fifth Element make it look like it
tries very hard, perhaps too hard, to be cool and stylish. The
futuristic setting and the backflipping scraggly girl invite a
skeptical comparison to Blade Runner.
In fact, the movie does have some elements of Blade Runner. It also has
some from Die Hard, Brazil, Star Wars, and Stargate. It sounds like a
big confused jumble, but actually it has its own internal consistency
and look. It is almost immediately engaging and engrossing.
After an introductory scene in Egypt, 1918, the movie jumps to the 23rd
century.  A black hole of Evil threatens humanity. Attempts to destroy
this Evil with force result in the growth and strengthening of the evil
body.
Four stones from the early Egypt sequence, plus a perfectly engineered
human, the Fifth Element, are needed to banish the darkness and death.
The good aliens, the golden robot ducks, are the keepers of the stones
and of the Fifth Element. When they learn of humanity's impending doom,
they come to the aid of the Earth, bearing these five components. On
their way to Earth, they are shot down by the the evil mercenary
aliens, "destroying" the stones and the Fifth Element in the fiery
wreckage.
The human government is able to salvage a piece of the Fifth Element
from the wreckage and regenerate the perfect human using DNA from the
mummified and stone-encased piece of shrapnel. The human reincarnated
from the Fifth Element is Leeloo, and she escapes from the clutches of
the scientists so she can go off in search of the priest she's been
programmed to find.
She falls into the arms of Corben Dallas (Bruce Willis), a
down-on-his-luck space cab driver, an ex-space military man kicked out
of the space army who now lives alone with his cat. (In the last Besson
film, The Professional, the hero lived alone with his plant.). The two
end up on a search for the stones so that they can vanquish the evil
black hole.
Working against them is Jean-Baptise Emmanuel Zorg (that's
John-the-Baptist, Jesus, Zorg, played by Gary Oldman), who wants to
steal the stones and use them for evil and darkness. (Chaos is better
for the economy, you see.)
The plot sounds rather ridiculous, but The Fifth Element is so engaging
and has such integrity of style, that I was never bothered by the
cartoonishness of the plot.  This is a positive example of solving a
problem by throwing enough money at it.
Several factors make this movie much better than it sounds. First, the
visual elements of this movie are interesting, and the filmmakers went
all out. The sets are great (the scientist's chamber), the costumes are
great (the police officers, the aliens), the special effects are good,
and these are cartoonish by the same amount as the plot, which allows
them to cohabitate in the same movie.
Second, this movie is good, fun, escapist entertainment. The movie has
a little humor and camp -- not too much to distract from the action,
but enough to keep you watching for little jokes. If you haven't seen
it yet, pay attention to Dallas' cigarettes, or look for visual
"quotes" from Star Wars. There are lots of clever details packed into
the movie.
Finally, the editing (by Sylvie Landra) was superb. Besson and Landra
used some cross-cutting techniques both to cleverly link scenes and
also to transition from one scene to the next. The cross-cutting (as
well as the "regular" straight cutting) kept the movie's pace nice and
brisk.
The one factor that nearly everyone disklikes about this movie is the
character Ruby Rhod (played by Chris Tucker -- rhodamine is another
shade of red).  Ruby is a flamingly shrill, annoying DJ, ten times
worse than Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh combined. Many people say the
movie would have been better without him, and I'd have a hard time
disagreeing.
Nevertheless, it is refreshing to see a science fiction movie with
space scenes and interesting aliens that is not part of some
established Star (fill-in-the-blank) series or based on some
pre-existing comic book. Apparently, Besson wrote the story for The
Fifth Element when he was a teenager, and he is just now coming back to
it.
This movie is not as heavy as Blade Runner or as insightful as Brazil,
but incorporates a lot of the more fun elements from both. The result
is a movie that's less substantial than either, but a lot more fun.

Title
Review for Blair Witch Project, The (1999)
***1/2 (out of 4) If you'd like to be creeped out by an amazing and
shocking document, then go see THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT without reading
this or any other review. If you want to steel your resolve before
seeing it, then read on.
THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is an original urban myth. A title card tells us
that the film you are about to see is true. Three filmmakers disappeared
in 1994 while shooting a documentary about a legendary witch of
Burkitsville, Maryland. The filmmakers vanished somewhere, somehow, in
those woods. Finally, their footage was found and edited chronologically
to make this movie.
The three students, Josh, Michael and Heather, went in search of the
"Blair Witch." According to legend, an old woman disappeared several
hundred years ago and to this day she still haunts the woods outside the
town. 
The trio drive from film school to the town. An early shot in the
Burkitsville graveyard has Heather standing by a grave, reading from a
book. She looks like a bad TV news anchor wannabe. It's very hokey, but
then, she's no Ken Burns.
Next they interview a few of the locals. A man tells how she's rumored
to have killed her victims: killing one first while the others were
forced to listen to the screams, standing in a corner. Another woman
reassures her young daughter that there's no such thing as the Blair
Witch-- then winks at the camera and mouths "it's true." A couple of
fishermen debate whether or not they believe in the witch.
All in all, the residents of Burkitsville look like ordinary people. The
ones who talk about the witch look like the sorts of people who would
believe in that sort of thing. The movie is shot mostly on video, with
non-actors playing themselves. There are no bad actors because nobody's
"acting." There was surely a rough script, but most of the performances
were not rehearsed.
Next the three have to pack up their gear and hike a day into the woods,
to a spot where the witch was said to haunt. When they get there,
Heather stages a scene where she reads an account of the witch from a
certain cave. It's the exact spot where the witch supposedly abducted
some children. Heather's documentary looks like it would have been
pretty lame, but at least she's sticking to her schedule and her script.
The three must camp in the "haunted" woods that night because of the
length of the hike. The following day they pack their gear and head back
to the car. But instead of ending up at their car, they end up -- well,
somewhere else. In the 2 days hiking, they have become lost. 
(SPOILERS AHEAD: STOP READING NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE.)
As the title card tells you, they never get un-lost. Their agonizing
descent from annoyance and anger to fear and desperation is not so much
pitiable as it is horrible, which is exactly what Myrick and Sanchez
were hoping for.
There are four techniques that really make BLAIR WITCH effective.
The first is absolutely essential for this type of horror movie. In
order to be scared by the supernatural, you have to first be convinced
of it. You have to be led by the hand from scoffing disbelief, through
entertaining the theory, to buying in. The characters you empathize with
have to start out saying "yeah, right, ghosts" and end up running and
screaming.
BLAIR WITCH does this very well: when the trio realize they're lost in
the woods, they go through some very rational thoughts. They're not
afraid a witch is going to eat them, they're just annoyed at the
inconvenience: the rented equipment is going to be charged for an extra
day, someone's girlfriend is going to be angry, their filming schedule
has been ruined.
The movie takes its time going through the descent to fear, which gives
the audience time to come down with them. It is only after much screen
time, when they run out of cigarettes, food, and water, that they start
believing in the supernatural. And why not? You would too. 
The second technique is that it never shows you the agent of the terror.
By making the "witch" invisible, there is always the possibility that
the terror springs from the mind, from fear, hunger, and fatigue. Even
if you become convinced that the terror is real, its invisibility will
force your imagination to make the thing more horrible than any solid
image could.
The second technique is enhanced by the third, the amateur quality of
the footage. Sometimes it's too dark or blurry to get a clear picture of
even what's right in front of your face. Also, the whole concept of
shooting on video and cheap filmstock gives the movie a look of reality
that just can't be faked. Because the subjects acknowledge the camera,
you can't as easily say "it's just a movie."
Finally, the movie works so well because of its actors, who were put
through quite an ordeal in the taping and filming of the movie. Myrick
and Sanchez made their actors hike to a specified location with a map
and a global positioning system; none of them were familiar with the
terrain. They had to be in character the whole time the camera was
running (which was a lot), and their emotion, jibes, and fights were
probably 90% "real." To make it easier for them to stay in character,
the characters were given the same names as the actors.
Horror guru Pablo Kjolseth will tell you that this concept (of
terrorizing your actors in order to get realistic looking "fear") is not
original. Neither is the idea of creating an urban myth for the screen.
Nevertheless THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT it is fresh for 1999, and most
importantly, it worked. It really is the scariest movie in quite a long
time.

Title
Review for Shanghai Noon (2000)
**1/2 (out of 4) I love Jackie Chan movies. Even if the plot is
confusing or the characters are flat, I love them anyway because Chan's
amazing stunts and graceful moves are a joy to watch. Unfortunately,
SHANGHAI NOON has no amazing stunts, and although there are some fight
sequences, they are more edited and less performed than I've come to
expect from Chan. The movie isn't completely unlikeable, but it's not
for Chan connoisseurs.
The movie opens in China on one of the oldest and most-used plot devices
in the world: the Princess has been kidnapped. Naturally, Jackie Chan
(playing Chon Wang) is sent to the Western U.S. territories to find her
and bring her back.
The movie introduces us to Roy (Owen Wilson) and his band of comically
inept outlaws. Roy and his gang are robbing the passengers of a train --
the same train that Chon and the rest of the royal entourage is on. One
of Roy's men shoots one of the "Chinamen," Chon's uncle, which gives the
movie an excuse for a fight scene.
It had been about 15 minutes without any Jackie Chan stunts -- not even
any little easy ones. So when someone disconnected the last car on the
train, with Jackie on one side and the bad guys on the other, I knew I
was about to witness the first stunt. I was on the edge of my seat,
ready to be amazed and thrilled. Jackie backed up into the car to get a
running start, dashed toward the end of the car, and ...
And the editor cut to a blurry medium shot of a figure that MIGHT HAVE
been Chan, jumping between two train cars that MIGHT HAVE been moving at
different speeds. If Chan really did do the stunt, then the director and
the editor are idiots for obscuring it. But I'm sure that's not the
case.
The fight continues up the train as Chon takes on Roy's gang, one by
one. Finally, Chon finds himself on a stack of timbers piled on a
flatbed car. Gun in hand, Roy follows him onto the logs, and the two
stare each other down. One of Roy's henchmen appears, standing next to a
release lever at the end of the car. He growls "I know how to get him
offa there."
Again I saw the stunt coming. I was on the edge of my seat, ready to be
amazed and thrilled. Jackie stands on the logs with a look of shock on
his face. The henchman pulls the lever to release the logs, and...
And the editor cuts to a helicopter shot of two figures that MIGHT have
been real people (if they weren't computer-generated), harmlessly
flailing their limbs over a pile of rolling and tumbling logs.   Clang!
Ooof!
SHANGHAI NOON's fight scenes have the choreography and pace of Chan's
other movies. But still, I think they rely more heavily on editing and
less on performance than in previous Chan movies. The most obvious
example is when Chon makes a weapon from a rope and a horseshoe. It
LOOKS like the weapon was too hard to use because there's never a clear
shot of the thing working. But add a few sound effects and turn up the
volume (Whoosh-whoosh-whoosh! Clang! Ooof!), and you can get away with
visually sloppy fight scenes.
The movie does have some things going for it. Wilson is appealing as the
bandit who can't shoot straight and who doesn't have the heart to be
ruthless. Some of the movie's funniest lines, ad-libbed by Wilson, come
from the softspoken, yet sarcastic Roy.
Also, the camaraderie between Roy and Chon (after their first encounter,
they forgive and forget) was funny and warm. It's the same friendship
that Chris Tucker and Chan showed in RUSH HOUR, which makes me think
Chan is really as nice a guy as he seems.
Plus, it's just hard not to like Jackie Chan, especially when he's doing
fight scenes that have been choreographed just for him. At one point he
fends off two drunken cowboys wielding only moose antlers.

Title
Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
*** (out of 4) Austin fans, THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is funnier and better
than the first movie!
Actually, I should say that I found the first movie to be mediocre. The
concept was good and some jokes and scenes worked great, but the film
itself fell apart because of all the dry spells between gags. Those
spells were filled with observations on the late sixties, slavishly
worked-in spy movie references, and plot. 
This one is much funnier because it borrows the successful elements from
the first and shuns what didn't work. That means more jokes, lower-brow
humor, more of that handsome Dr. Evil, and less plot. Mike Myers wrote
the first film, and this time he was joined by newcomer Michael
McCullers. Together, they seem to have worked out the kinks.
The film opens with Austin Powers (Mike Myers) leading the easy life
with his wife Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) now that the evil Dr. Evil
(Mike Myers) has been vanquished. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Powers, Dr.
Evil has been thawing and plotting his revenge. Dr. Evil acquires a time
machine and goes back in time to steal Austin Powers' mojo.
Later, when Austin Powers... ahh, to heck with the plot summary. You
will not care about, much less notice, the plot. There is just enough to
keep the action moving and the jokes rolling in, and that's all that
matters, isn't it?
A comedy that makes me laugh out loud comes along once, maybe twice a
year, and SHAGGED is one of them. The near-nudity gags from the original
are repeated and expanded upon, and a new verbal gag using synonyms for
"penis" is introduced (told you it was low-brow). Actually, both had my
audience (okay, I admit, me too) laughing out loud. If there is a third
Austin Powers movies, you can bet both gags will resurface. 
Most importantly, Dr. Evil gets a lot more screen time than in the first
movie. He steals the show as he works out his paternal feelings both for
his son (Seth Green) and for his 1/8 size clone, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer).
Dr. Evil and Mini-Me get the biggest, best-deserved laughs.
I would certainly recommend this movie (especially if you have an
adolescent streak in you). As with most comedies, I would also recommend
seeing it in a big crowd. The fuller the theater, the funnier the jokes.
But a few tell-tale signs indicate that it may not be destined for the
next AFI top 100 list.
First is the caliber of the jokes. A few too many are grossout jokes.
Myers plays a third character, Fat Bastard, an agent of Dr. Evil's.
Myers wears a fat suit like the one made for Eddie Murphy in THE NUTTY
PROFESSOR. Naturally, since this is a comedy, we find out entirely too
much about Bastard's digestive system. As repulsed as I was, I have to
admit I laughed. But I don't know if I'll be renting this movie when I
have polite company over.
Second is the repetition of the jokes. Many of the funniest gags are
repeated. Luckily, the latest round is always just a little funnier than
the first round, but really, they're the same gag, and if you didn't
like it the first time, you'll just hate it the second time.
And finally, there are some references to Star Wars that play very well
right now because we are swamped by "Phantom Menace" pool toys and
galactic-mint Star Wars toothpaste. But in time, the Star Wars jokes
won't be quite so biting as they are now. Comedy that relies on parody
and reference (like a lot of Zucker Brothers movies) is extremely chancy
and very dated.
Based on these points, I would recommend seeing SHAGGED sooner rather
than later. I think the longer the movie has been around, the less funny
it will seem.
Now don't get me wrong. I'm not panning SHAGGED. I actually had a lot of
fun. But I do feel it's necessary to temper my praise with a dose of
reality.
But having hedged my review, let me close by saying that AUSTIN POWER:
THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is a very funny movie, and is one of the few
sequels to surpass its predecessor.

Review for Edge, The (1997)
***1/2 (out of 4) According to the Internet Movie Database, one of the
working titles for THE EDGE was BOOKWORM. Not very exciting, but it does
sum up what is most interesting about the movie, namely the character
Charles Morse, played superbly by Anthony Hopkins. 
In some ways, Charles is similar to Stevens, the character Hopkins
played in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY. Both have a quiet dignity; both are
reserved, almost shy, on the surface, but each has a buried pathos that
gives him resounding depth. 
Charles is a millionaire taking a winter holiday with his wife and
friends at a remote cabin in Alaska. His trophy wife Mickey (whom he
actually loves) is here for another reason, too; she is the model for
their photographer friend Bob (Alec Baldwin), who has also come along on
the trip. 
When it comes to his wife, Charles is jealous of everybody, and Bob is
on the top of the list. Hopkins shows you that his character is jealous,
but also, on top of the emotion, he shows you the intellectual man's
struggle to keep the emotion hidden. It is a superb and solid
performance. 
Charles's special talent is that facts stick to his mind like Post-ItŽ
Notes. The cabin's proprietor (L.Q. Jones, who is very good in a small
role) tries to stump Charles with a question about Indian lore: he asks
Charles what's on the opposite side of a paddle that shows a panther.
Charles knows that the counterpart is a rabbit sitting and smoking a
pipe. He even knows that the rabbit is acting casually because the
rabbit knows that it is smarter than the panther, and therefore has
nothing to worry about. 
The next day Charles and three friends set off in search of the
proprietor's Indian friend, who has the perfect face for Bob's camera.
They take the plane to the next lake North, but a flock of birds causes
the plane to crash into the ice-cold water. Three survive the crash and
realize that no rescue party will be coming, at least not very soon. If
they are to survive the cold (and the bears), they will need to rely on
their wits and their survival knowledge (i.e., on Charles). 
Much has been said of their nemesis, a bear with a taste for human
flesh. The bear was a convincing character, but he is not the only
conflict these men face. Panic, wounds, cold, fear, hunger, jealousy,
and greed all work against the survival of the men. None of the
conflicts they face, with the possible exception of the bear, feels
contrived or written. Each problem feels like a genuine obstacle to
survival, and each brings new panic, new fear, and in Charles' case, a
new chance to test his mind. 
I think one of the more interesting scenarios in fiction asks you how
you would handle it if you were REALLY put to the test. Some examples
that come to my mind are Steven King's THE STAND in which 99% of the
human population is wiped out. How would you handle being the last
person alive in your town? Or James Clavell's KING RAT, in which POWs
live in unbearable conditions of disease and starvation. Would you
retreat into insanity or would you fight to survive? 
THE EDGE, pits man against the Alaskan winter without the tools of
civilization to help him survive. Would you panic or could you think
your way out? 
The scenario alone would make an interesting movie, but because the hero
is a smart man instead of a strong man or a lucky man, the movie is even
more interesting, more tangible, more approachable. THE EDGE is not a
disaster movie like DANTE'S PEAK or TWISTER, where only luck or
superheroism can overcome the awesome forces of nature. Instead, man
overcomes nature calmly, slowly, and realistically. It doesn't take a
dashing young hero, it takes a calm, quiet, 50-year old man, who tries
to teach his friends "what one man can do, another can do." 
There is something of a twist at the ending. In general, I don't mind
giving away endings - there's usually enough ironic foreshadowing that
knowing about the ending actually helps you appreciate the rest of the
movie. But in this one, I was glad I had to guess, and so I won't
discuss the wonderful foreshadowing Tamahori and writer David Mamet put
in the movie. But thinking back, there were scenes and lines early on
that take on new significance knowing the outcome of the movie. 
And after the plot twist, the movie continues on for a bit longer. When
the survivors return home, they talk to the press, and what they say
makes one of the best endings to a film I've ever seen. Think about the
last line of the movie and all the meanings it can have - as intended,
as it COULD be interpreted by the audience, and as interpreted by the
press.  
THE EDGE is really a very good movie, and it may make a few "10 best"
lists, including this one. But I must fault it for a clumsy setup. The
movie really gets interesting after the plane crash. It takes 20 to 30
minutes to get to that point, and that first setup is essential to the
story. But it is clear that the beginning is a necessary evil that
clashes with the tone of the rest of the film. 
Still, I can't think of any better way to introduce the necessary traits
of the characters. And the characters and portrayals are what really
sets this movie apart, so the fact that there are two disjointed acts
doesn't need to be a major criticism. 
And if that's all that's wrong with a movie, you've got something worth
seeing.

Title
Review for Bean (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) A faithful follower of the British TV series, I was
eager to see BEAN. Rowan Atkinson, as Mr. Bean, is the only comic these
days who does great nonverbal comedy. Seeing him in a feature-length
film was going to be a treat. 
His TV show is presented in half-hour pieces, split into 2 or 3
seven-minute sketches. Each sketch, then, is about as long as a Looney
Tunes cartoon, and just as silly. 
In BEAN, there are still identifiable sketches, and each is about the
same length as in the show, maybe shorter. Some of them are great. Many
of them are recycled from his TV show. One thing's certain, there aren't
enough of them. 
These sketches fit within Mr. Bean's latest adventure: a night guard at
a museum, Bean is selected to be the museum's liaison in a deal to sell
Whistler's Mother to an American gallery. He is chosen not for his
knowledge of Whistler, but because the job will get him out of the
British museum's hair for three months. 
On the show, the sketches are always tightly packed with Atkinson's
gags. However, in the movie, a lot of time is spent between sketches on
the "required" structure of a movie - plot, characters, conflict, etc.
Those gaps are what makes BEAN an average movie instead of a hilarious
star vehicle. 
The problem with the gaps is not just the absence of Atkinson; it is the
presence of a token plot and shallow characters that requires the
attention to shift from silly abandon to forced concern. Any comic
momentum Atkinson builds is halted when the movie cuts to his American
host's (Peter MacNicol) wife (Pamela Reed) threatening divorce. 
I have seen interviews with Smith who says the movie structure was a
necessary evil. I think he's wrong. Too many directors take the
traditional structure of a movie as a necessity. I sometimes complain
that a movie has "too much plot, not enough action." This time, it's
"too much plot, not enough Rowan." 
A good example of a movie that shunned plot in favor of comedy is LIAR
LIAR. In that movie, a wisp of a plot and a clever idea gives Jim Carrey
a good 60 minutes of comic material. The story in BEAN seems solid
enough to have given Smith and Atkinson the same opportunity, but they
were too careful, too concerned with the plot. 
Smith even said he had to cut some of Rowan's sketches that didn't fit
well with the story. What Smith didn't realize is that if BEAN will be
remembered, it won't be for the story, it will be for Atkinson's
performance. Cutting Atkinson in favor of the story was a bad case of
misordered priorities.

Title
Review for Trekkies (1997)
***1/2 (out of 4) TREKKIES is one of the funniest movies of the year,
but it's not a comedy. It's a documentary about the fans of STAR TREK
who are fanatical, loyal, optimistic, and just a little crazy.
Although its "five-year mission" was canceled after only 3 seasons, STAR
TREK made an indelible mark on American culture. It captured the hearts,
minds, and imaginations of a generation (myself included). Some admired
it for its respectful treatment of science. Others, for its optimism
with regards to race, class, and nationality. And some were just happy
to see science fiction get a decent TV show.
But no matter how much you like STAR TREK, there's always someone who
carries that admiration too far. These people are the Trekkies. (Even
Trekkies try to separate themselves from the hard-core geeks by
splitting themselves into two camps  TrekkIES and TrekkERS  although
the distinction is purely semantic.)
Denise Crosby, the short-lived Lt. Yar from the NEXT GENERATION series,
narrates the movie and conducts some of the interviews. She shows us her
own collection of fan-junk (several large boxes), including sketches of
her and co-star Brent Spiner in naked, romantic, passionate poses.
Other actors have received bizarre stuff from their fans. The late
DeForrest Kelly (who played Dr. McCoy) tells of a fan who, along with
her photo, sent him a marijuana cigarette. James Doohan (who played
Scotty) told of a fan who sent a suicide note. Although he probably
should have forwarded the note to a psychologist or police, he responded
to the person by insisting that she show up, alive and well, at the next
convention. More letters came and Doohan kept responding in the same
way, until eventually, the fan was in the clear. Doohan gets choked up
when he thinks about it, awestruck that a simple actor could do
something as noble as save a life.
Still other cast members (I didn't note who, and I won't try to guess),
recount their trip to a NASA launch, where they hoped to get some
autographs of REAL astronauts. But when the astronauts saw who had come,
they got excited and turned everything around. The ASTRONAUTS ended up
asking for the ACTORS' autographs.
Nygard intercuts these interviews of actors, with interviews of their
fans - and boy did he find some doozies.
A fan dressed as a Klingon explains that there's now a Klingon-English
dictionary and a complete translation of Hamlet. A Klingon Bible is on
its way. He boasted that Klingon is now more widely spoken than some
fading tribal tongues.
A dentist in Florida has done up his entire office in a STAR TREK motif.
The walls and ceiling are covered with Trek stuff, and every employee
wears a uniform  including one receptionist who held out for a year
before finally agreeing. The dentist and his wife both wear their
uniforms at home, as well. They say that role-playing characters from
the show helps their "relationship." (Thankfully, Crosby didn't ask for
details.)  
Another promising young trekkie is writing a script for a new STAR TREK
movie. He's already modeled a spaceship fly-by on his home computer, and
the new uniforms he designed for the movie arrive back from the tailor
during his interviews, just in time for the next convention.
Another, older man dresses in the Starfleet uniform from the early
movies. He admits to the camera that if he had the money, he'd get his
ears surgically pointed to look like Spock's  something he had
obviously never mentioned to his wife, sitting next to him.
The only thing missing from Nygard's documentary is the Saturday Night
Live sketch of William Shatner at a Trek convention. After a few
ridiculous questions from hard-core fans, he breaks down, shouting "you
people need to get a life!"
In that spirit, and with the admission that I, too, am a Trekkie, I'll
close with some of my favorite quotes from thefans:
"One of my goals is to build a great big shelf." "I spent a lot of time
in vans." "I'm gonna connect my house with Jeffries tubes." "Every year
it gets bigger. This year we had a girl come." (REFERRING TO A GATHERING
IN IOWA.) 

Title
Review for Midsummer Night's Dream, A (1999)
*** (out of 4)
I'll start the film review with points against,
because by criticizing at the start
(and since the criticisms are but small)
we put behind us things unpleasant, which,
though necessary if one wants to share
the truth, do not comprise the all
of one's experience watching Hoffman's film.
This version of A Midsummer Night's Dream
at 19th century's turn's suppos'dly set
(though "turn" in this case surely means the last,
for phonographs in 1800 would
be out of place). But let's not fret o'er when
it's set; suffice to say that it was long ago.
The setting isn't modern like the one
Baz Luhrmann used when he made Romeo
+ Juliet some two or three years past.
Nor is the setting bold and striking like
McKellen and Loncraine's Richard III
which looks and feels like Nazi Germany
(it's chilling to the bone and worth a rent.)
The point is that this film does not have one
odd thing about it, leading one to ask:
"Why now? Why film? Why not a trav'ling play?"
Effects most special? Not particul'y
(although the fairies made of light are neat).
Amazing sound and music? Not to me.
(although I think the music rang a bell)
I guess that Hoffman simply wished to tell
a lightweight tale for summer moviegoers.
"Lightweight" describes the film most fittingly, 
unless perhaps you know of what I speak
when I say "fluff." But "fluff" is not the worst
of jibes; in fact a very pleasant time
is eas'ly had at movies which are fluff.
In short: it's nothing special and it's fluff, 
and that was it. That's all the bad I had 
to say about this film. (Espesh'ly since
I thought I wouldn't mention the first scene
with Michelle Pfeiffer -- her deliv'ry was
not great and sounded wooden. But, quite soon
the feeling passed and so I thought I'd leave
those unkind words unwritten in my piece).
At this point in reviews I often find
it's time to summarize the movie's plot, 
but this time I will not. For since the film's
retelling is quite faithful, I'll not bore
you with the details -- you can always look
them up in any tome of Shakespeare's work.
(In fact there's even now a "dummies" book!)
The changes Hoffman made, (he wrote the script
as well), it seems to me were mostly made 
to make the dialogue seem more like speech
and less like speeches. Shakespeare's words and deeds
were left intact as far as I can tell.
Okay, a little -- little! -- summary
to save you looking up the movie's plots.
(I say instead of "plot," the plural. Yes, 
this film has two threads, prob'ly more, but I'll
just keep my myself to two, for breviphiles.)
The first one is a love triangle, but
it is a square, because it has four sides:
Fair Helena fawns o'er Demetrius,
who loves her not; for he loves Hermia.
In fact, he'll marry her, though not because
she loves him back. Tis father's whim to whom
she'll wed; and he doth pick Demetrius.
But Hermia loves good Lysander, and
he requites her love, which means that of the four
sides to our square, just Helena's unloved.
The other thread tells of the fairy king
and how his plot to tease his wife ensnares
a simple weaver/actor by the name
of Bottom. (He's the one, and this the play,
where human head turns into ass's head.)
That's all the summary you'll get from me.
There's more, but tis of no immense import.
The film deserves some praise, now that we've moved
beyond the summary and criticism,
And most of it belongs to Hoffman's cast:
a fine job all around and in all roles.
Though Kevin Kline (as Bottom) gets the first
screen credit at the end, the credits at
the film's beginning show the players' names
in alphabetic order. In that way
ensemble acting's emphasized o'er "stars"
or egos. Quite refreshing, I do say.
Puck (Stanley Tucci), gray and bald, still has
a spritely step along with some of Dream's 
most funny lines. Calista Flockhart shines
as our fair Helena, and though comes close,
she never whines (a fear that's grounded in
her TV past). And Kevin Kline can act
the fool in such a charming way that you
can love him, foolish mortal though he be.
You'll surely recognize the faces of
the other actors, even if you don't 
know what their names may be. Of more import,
though, is that all performances are good.
Nor Rupert Everett (as the Fairy King --
don't laugh), nor Pfeiffer as his wife are bad,
though both of them are flatter than the rest.
So all in all A Midsummer Night's Dream
is pretty good, considering it's fluff.
And if you have a couple hours to spare --
say Star Wars is sold out and you have made
no other plans -- see Kline and Tucci play 
their parts. It may not change your life but for
an afternoon you will be entertained.

Review for Peacemaker, The (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) George Clooney was the best movie Batman yet. Val
Kilmer was flat and brooding and Michael Keaton was too much of a wimp.
Clooney brought the right mix of sophistication and wisdom. Not being a
fan of ER, I attributed his success to good acting. 
Now that I've seen him play the same character in ONE FINE DAY, ER, and
now THE PEACEMAKER, I see that he's one of the worst actors to make it
big, good looks aside. He's the next Arnold Schwarzenegger - icon, not
actor. 
THE PEACEMAKER is a very conventional action movie. All the baroque
trim, all the flourishes, have been removed. There is no love interest,
there are no wisecracks, just stripped down, economy model action movie.
This was no doubt Leder's point, and it was a good idea, but it didn't
work. 
The effect was that the movie felt, well, plain. It felt like a quickly
made, no-time-for-details, made-for-TV movie (not surprising considering
Leder's strong TV background). It didn't shun enough of the action genre
to really set itself apart. 
After an opening sequence of Russians stealing a packet of nukes, the
movie introduces Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman), a special investigator
whose job it is to find out what happened to them. Assigned to assist
her is Tom Devoe (Clooney), a military liaison with strong Russian
connections. 
They track the nukes through Vienna, where Clooney is tailed by a crew
of disposable bad guys in identical cars. The ensuing chase scene is
very well handled; it looks great on screen. But the endless
destruction, first without any airbags deploying, and second without any
apparent moral or legal consequence, shows that Leder and screenwriter
Michael Schiffer really didn't leave the action genre as far behind as
one might think. 
Kelly and Devoe eventually recover all but one of the stolen nukes. They
track this last one to Bosnia, where they learn that Gavrich (Marcel
Iures) a Bosnian politician disgusted with the West's lack of aid in
their war, intends to detonate a single nuke at the U.N. building in New
York.  
The movie crosses the Atlantic to Manhattan, where another good-looking,
but rather conventional chase scene happens. The movie's climax involves
what Roger Ebert calls RDRs - red digital readouts - counting down to
the destruction of New York. 
Can Kelly and Devoe stop the bomb in time? Well - yes and no. But even
that enigmatic conclusion isn't enough to set this movie apart. 
It would be interesting to see a truly genre-breaking action movie that
doesn't just shun the superficial elements (like love interests and
wisecracks), but questioned the very idea of using violence to combat
violence as the morally Right thing to do.

Title
Review for Pleasantville (1998)
*** (out of 4) Pleasantville is that rare movie that is
thought-provoking without being substantive. It's a parable without a
meaning. A metaphor without a referent. It's enjoyable and stimulating,
but it's not as deep as it leads you to believe.
David (Tobey Maguire) is a high school nerd. His greasy black hair is
the perfect complement to his encyclopedic knowledge of TV Trivia. He
has clearly grown up with Nick at Night, and his favorite show is
Pleasantville, a combination of Father Knows Best and Leave It To
Beaver.
His sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) wants to watch the MTV concert
with her boyfriend one evening, but David wants to watch the
Pleasantville marathon so he can enter the trivia contest. 
Their fight results in a broken remote control, without which the TV
will not function. Coincidentally, a mysterious TV repair man (Don
Knotts) shows up at their door with a super duper remote control.
The repairman is so impressed by David's knowledge of Pleasantville
trivia that he leaves them the remote free of charge. David clicks the
remote and he and Jennifer suddenly find themselves in Pleasantville.
They are now trapped in the sanitary, black-and-white "utopia" of 1950s
sitcoms. David and Jennifer are now "Bud" and "Mary Sue," at least until
they can find that repairman again.
David knows this universe pretty well and he is able to cope with the
change. Living in utopia and having a knowable, predictable future is
actually something "Bud" is looking forward to.
In contrast, Jennifer is angry and resentful. She accepts that the
universe around her has changed, but she's not going to play along with
it. When she finally makes it to school, she introduces the word "cool"
to her friends as a substitute for "swell." When she gets bored (which
doesn't take too long) she seduces Mary Sue's boyfriend (who's never
done more than hold hands with a girl) in the back seat of his car.
Her boyfriend had never heard of sex before (this IS the land where
married couples sleep five feet apart on single beds). So when he
experiences it for the first time, a rose appears in full, vivid, living
color. The next day he tells his friends about the experience and soon,
everyone is having sex and seeing real colors.
The universe as the inhabitants of Pleasantville know it shatters. Mr.
Johnson (Jeff Daniels) who runs the soda shop learns about free will the
hard way. Firemen learn about fires. Students learn about books. Boys
learn about girls and girls learn about boys. With each revelation comes
a new splash of color into the black and white world.
It seems as though modern ideas are so strong that they are unstoppable.
But after about half of the townspeople pop into full color,
Pleasantville hits a plateau. Some residents just don't like or
understand what is happening. They cling to their old-fashioned black
and white ways, and they don't experience the colorful epiphanies their
friends and families had.
Some people without color resent these changes that they can't control,
so they resort to prejudice and violence. The movie hits its climax with
Bud's trial in a colorless courtroom with colorless jurors and a fearful
colorless judge.
Although I enjoyed this film, I was ultimately disappointed that this
elaborate parable had so little meaning. The only apparent lesson is
that change - exciting to some and feared by others - is inevitable.
Lots of other lessons take shape, but when you think about them too
hard, they dissolve.
For example, it seems that passion sparks the change from black and
white to color. If true, it would lead to all sorts of interesting
conclusions about what the movie was trying to say. Later, an angry mob
smashes a store window and none of them change color. The film now says
that passion has to be "good" in order to effect the change to color. It
leads to a different set of ideas about the film. Still later in the
film, one of the last black and white holdouts changes color by
confronting his own hatred. The film once again changes its own rules,
leaving one to wonder if there really was supposed to be a metaphor at
work.
(NOTE: Gary Ross responded to this question in Ebert's "Answer Man"
column. Nevertheless, that's not a resource available to you when you're
sitting in the theater.)
I was also disappointed that this movie avoided some of the bigger
issues that could have made it really interesting. For example, when the
town is split, the black-and-whites are not given equal time. The film
doesn't let the audience see their point of view. It ignores the
deep-down terror they must feel at watching their world collapse. Why
weren't there any black-and-white suicides? What if the last one were
unable to change? Would the new colorful world have a place for these
leftovers, or would they become Pleasantville's forgotten homeless?
Finally, Ross let the film have an all-too-easy outcome. Conventional
storytelling doesn't let Utopia come without some cost. Utopia is too
boring or sterile to be one's permanent residence, or it requires some
sacrifice the characters aren't willing to make. Yet by the end of the
film, not only has everyone become colorful, the world is still free of
crime, rape, violence, and presumably toilets. A little turmoil in the
middle allowed the world of Pleasantville to become a true utopia, and
that usually isn't allowed in fiction. (Even more unconventional is that
Jennifer's decision at film's end is allowed to stand!)
Both before and during the movie, I was rooting to be won over, and I
actually enjoyed the experience. But it turns out my expectations were
too high. I saw that Ross was searching for human Truths, but the whole
thing fell apart in my head not long after the movie was over.
Still, I did enjoy it and it was worth thinking about outside the
theater, if only for an hour. That still lets me recommend this film.

Title
Review for Haunting, The (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) I wouldn't have expected Jan De Bont (SPEED, TWISTER)
to make a movie about ghosts. But if he had to make one, it would
probably be the biggest, loudest, most special effects- laden ghost
movie ever.
THE HAUNTING is the second film to be made from Shirley Jackson's book,
"The Haunting of Hill House." The 1963 version, directed by Robert Wise,
is a surprisingly scary movie for its time (or for any time, for that
matter). A well-written script and impeccable direction brought the
audience under its spell, little by little. 
This year's version is not quite as good. It lacks the finesse of the
original. Nevertheless, some of the chills are still there. After a
melodramatically lousy introduction, Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) brings a
small group of patients to a remote hideaway, ostensibly for a study on
insomnia. In fact, his insomniacs are subjects in a study on fear. The
doctor hopes to observe the spread of fear from person to person, and
among the group.
Nell (Lili Taylor) is the first to arrive. Her mother has just died
after 11 years of infirmity that required Nell's constant attention.
Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a strong, solid woman who feels energized
by her insomnia. Luke (Owen Wilson) is a good-natured, rational fellow
who relishes being the only male patient.
Dr. Marrow sets things in motion by telling his subjects about the man
who built the house, how he wanted children of his own, and how each
time his wife got pregnant, the infant died at birth. To really give the
house a haunted feeling, he tells them how the couple finally died of a
murder/suicide.
Like De Bont's other movies, this one is both good and bad. Both SPEED
and TWISTER were excellent IDEAS for movies, and the special effects
sequences were great. But both had sub-par plot and dialogue. Likewise,
THE HAUNTING has some good ideas and some great execution, but pieces of
bad writing taint it somewhat.
I already mentioned the melodramatic sequence at the beginning. The
other bad writing comes early too. Dr. Marrow is "arguing" with a
colleague about his study on fear. The "argument" is actually the
movie's exposition, crammed into about 3 or 4 lines of dialogue. It is
written so obtusely that even Liam Neeson couldn't make it sound good.
Also, Marrow's character is badly researched and poorly thought out. His
study on fear is completely unethical. No self-respecting, licensed
psychologist would deliberately terrorize his subjects just to see how
they react. Sure, those studies have been done in the past, but they
have been all but banned by the profession.
Later, Marrow says that natural responses to fear are detrimental to
coping with situations which cause fear. On the surface, that may appear
to be true, especially in modern man, but an expert in the field of
"fear psychology" (or animal behavior, or anthropology, etc.) should
know better.
But once the movie gets underway, the house takes center stage, and
nitpicks about bad writing drop away. The house is a huge, beautiful,
gothic-looking thing. Every wall, floor, and ceiling is filled with rich
texture. Sculptures, engravings, bas-reliefs, and mosaics fill every
frame, and promise a rich playground for sprites and spirits.
The detail of the furnishings is impressive, but so is the sheer size of
the place, as captured on film by cinematographer Caleb Deschanel (who
recently shot the verdant FLY AWAY HOME). Figures are dwarfed by
gigantic walls and huge, open rooms. Great paintings look down on the
mortals scuttling about underfoot. The walk-in fireplace could consume a
forest of trees. (The combination of huge scale, rich detail, and
ominous mood reminded me of the best traits of computer games like Myst,
Riven, and 7th Guest.)
Clearly the overall mood was successful, thanks largely to Deschanel,
production designer Eugenio Zanetti (who designed the look for WHAT
DREAMS MAY COME), and set designer Cosmas Demetriou. But the big
question is: was it scary?
I think the 1963 version was scarier. For one thing, it never showed you
any apparitions. The unseen, unexplained phenomena were terrifying. (THE
BLAIR WITCH PROJECT handles this very well, too.) You can't show a ghost
without making people think, at least in some small corner of their
mind, about how the image was created. When you start explaining what
the ghost is, or what it looks like, you move into a different area of
horror movies altogether. Compared to the original movie, this one
shows, and explains, far too much.
But that's not to say this movie isn't scary. There are scenes of
unseen, patient terrors; invigorating, only-caught-a-glimpse scares; and
some big frights with huge, loud noises and shaking, rumbling, bass. The
horror wasn't 100% successful because some of the frights were a little
too obvious. But when that was the case, De Bont and editor Michael Kahn
moved on, quickly and without comment, leaving just the good stuff in
the fore of your memory.

Review for Ever After (1998)
**** (out of 4) For years, Hollywood has paid lip service to the idea of a
strong female character. Yet from Disney's cartoons to THE SAINT to KISS THE
GIRLS, these "strong" women have needed a man to save them in the end. 
Drew Barrymore plays Cinderella, who, without giving up her femininity, is a
genuinely strong character. It is the most refreshing turn of the summer. 
In this retelling of the fairy tale, the magic and mysticism have been
stripped away, leaving human nature to drive the story. It makes for a much
more interesting movie. 
Danielle has been raised by her father Auguste (Jeroen Krabbe), her mother
having died in childbirth. Dad marries Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston), when
Danielle is about 9. Danielle immediately loves Rodmilla and her two
daughters, though the opposite isn't necessarily true. 
Soon after the wedding, Auguste leaves on business. Everyone is tense
because they sense that without him, their family will fall apart. They
understand that he is the buffer and the glue that allows them all to
coexist peacefully. Before he can make it to the front gate, he falls off
his horse and dies, his last words professing his love, not for his wife,
but for his daughter. This gives Danielle hope throughout her life, but it
makes her stepmother even more jealous and cruel. 
Danielle, nicknamed Cinderella because she likes to read on the hearth,
grows up less a daughter and more a servant to her step-family.
Nevertheless, she is happy, enjoying life more than her bitter mother and
sister Marguerite. (Her other sister Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey) is not so
bad.) 
One day a hooded figure on a stolen horse nearly tramples Danielle. She
pelts him with apples and demands the return of the horse, until she sees
that he is the prince. She makes her obeisance and allows him to ride on. He
pays her for her silence in this embarrassing matter. 
Danielle knows exactly what to do with the money. A hired hand has been sold
into slavery, parting him from his wife. She heads to town to buy him back,
disguised as nobility. There she meets the prince again and, when drawn into
conversation, scolds him for his elitist point of view toward slavery. 
The prince is taken by this challenging young woman, who is more than just a
pretty face, who can argue politics and morality with him as an intellectual
equal. Like in the fairy tale, the prince is smitten, but he doesn't know
his love's identity. He must learn who she is and where she lives before his
father the king forces him to marry another. 
Even though the story is melodramatic, there are no two-dimensional
characters. That's not to say they aren't exaggerated, but they have their
own motives and thoughts; they are not merely acting on behalf of the plot.
For example, Rodmilla is, on the whole, cruel and jealous. But the movie
took the time to show us why, and it even permitted her a scene of kindness.
She and Danielle are alone together, the stepdaughter braiding the
stepmother's hair. The camera captures them, locked in each other's gaze as
they talk about love. For a brief, fleeting moment, the two connect as
mother and daughter, before Rodmilla puts her hard exterior back on. (This
scene also demonstrates the capability of both Barrymore and Huston as actors). 
Another example is that Prince Henry falls in love with Danielle, not merely
because the plot demands it, but because she offers him something the other
courtiers do not. At first she is challenging and elusive. Later, she proves
to be an intelligent, clever, capable partner. They meet again several
times, each time discussing important and substantive issues. Their love
springs from their friendship and mutual respect, not the other way around. 
Along with the depth of the characters, the caliber of the dialogue makes
screenwriters Susannah Grant, Tenant, and Rick Parks a trio to watch. As
mentioned before, the arguments between characters are substantive and
insightful. When Danielle is at the table with her step-family the insults
are incisive and on-target. When she argues with the prince, the two bait
each other with rhetorical traps. Everyone in the movie is a notch smarter
than in your average film. 
The movie turns corny near the end, and a wrinkle in the plot contrives to
lengthen the film by about ten minutes, but on the whole, there is nothing
wrong with the film. 
It is incredibly refreshing to see a movie with a genuinely strong female
character. It is equally refreshing to see a love story that has time to
develop. EVER AFTER gives me hope that Hollywood is capable of producing
high-quality entertainment that doesn't treat its audience like idiots. This
is a movie not to be missed.

Title
Review for Waking Ned Devine (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4)Except that it's set in a small Irish village, WAKING
NED DEVINE could pass for GRUMPY OLD MEN 3. Instead of Walter Matthau
and Jack Lemmon, it stars two aging Irish actors, Ian Bannen and David
Kelly.
Bannen and Kelly play Jackie and Michael, two old friends who don't act
their age. (The two take motorcycle rides to the icy Atlantic to go
skinny-dipping.) When they learn someone from their village (of just 52
people) has won the lottery, they concoct some wacky schemes to befriend
the winner.
They target the 18 known lotto players from the village and invite them
all over for a nice chicken supper. One by one, they rule everyone out,
until they deduce the winner must have been the man who didn't come, Ned
Devine.  
Jackie trudges up to Devine's house in a storm, carrying a chicken
supper as a bribe... gift. He finds Devine sitting in front of the
telly, the winning ticket clutched in his dead hand. The shock of
winning the lottery must have given old Ned a heart attack.
Jackie and Michael try to claim the ticket for themselves, with Michael
taking Ned's identity. They manage to fool the lotto man on the first
visit, but he informs them he'll have to ask around - make sure Ned's
who he says he is. Now Jackie and Michael have to include the whole town
in the scheme if they want to avoid prison. They won't get their
millions, but it still leaves Ł130,000 for every person in the village -
if they can pull it off.
The movie's got a (mostly) good heart and more brain than you might
think. Jackie's wife Annie (Fionnula Flanagan) is the movie's loving
moral conscience. She makes the two heroes ponder the fraud they are
committing and the potential wishes of the deceased. If this were truly
a sitcom, such questions could be laughed off with a joke or two. But
the two heroes take the question to heart and consider how they can do
some good with the money.
The movie even remembers to tell us where the money would have gone, had
not Jackie and Michael intervened. After all, the money wouldn't have
vanished into thin air. It would have gone... well, you'll have to see
for yourself.
There is only one time that the movie is unapologetically blackhearted,
and it stands out in contrast to the rest of the film. It's a scene
that's supposed to make you cheer, but it is unnecessarily cruel, and it
calls into question the film's otherwise goodhearted nature. Many
audiences actually did cheer, so you may too. But I found myself wincing
at the films sudden wicked glee.
The film is full of colorful minor characters. There's a pig farmer in
love with the town's flirt. She loves him too but can't stand the smell.
There's a rookie minister who talks to the town's youngest boy, who has
tough and practical questions about God.
Unfortunately, none of the minor characters is developed enough to
really let you get attached. They are quirky, and at times amusing, but
they are on the whole flat and robotic. The fact that the "evil"
villager is dealt with so mercilessly is enough to tell you that Jones
didn't consider his minor characters to be fully human, but rather
offbeat icons of a small town.
WAKING NED DEVINE is no great film. The direction is adequate, if a bit
predictable. The film's timing seems to be just a bit off. The sitcom
aspect to the comedy feels a bit too contrived, as do the moments of
earnest friendship. The widescreen cinematography is good, but
disappointingly mundane given such a photogenic setting (the film was
shot on the rugged and rustic Isle of Man).
On the other hand, I don't think it was striving for greatness. It's
only supposed to be a lightweight, fun comedy. And on that level, it
succeeds pretty well. If you're interested in seeing GRUMPY OLD
IRISHMEN, don't let me stop you. It's not a bad movie, and it certainly
can be entertaining. 
Just don't say I sent you.

Title
Review for Wonder Boys (2000)
**1/2 (out of 4) WONDER BOYS is the kind of movie that makes a little
blip on the timeline of your life without actually changing its course.
As interesting or well told or charming as it may be, it's safe and pat
and unchallenging. You can leave the theater in the same emotional state
as when you went in.
Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr., lead a literary
ensemble through Michael Chabon's story. Douglas plays Professor Tripp,
who teaches English at a university in Pittsburgh. James (Maguire), one
of his best creative writing students, is always moody and depressed.
Downey plays Terry, Tripp's editor who has come to town ostensibly for
the university's "Wordfest" weekend, but also to check on Tripp's
long-overdue latest book.
The detailed, twisty story in WONDER BOYS takes place over a single,
eventful weekend. A dozen little developments add to the comic chaos.
James shoots the dog of Tripp's mistress and steals her husband's
Marilyn Monroe memorabilia. Terry's transvestite girlfriend decides to
abandon a tuba in Tripp's trunk. A strange man jumps out in traffic
claiming that Tripp has stolen his car. Tripp's pretty young boarder
gets a crush on him and starts reading his unfinished novel.
In a small way, WONDER BOYS is reminiscent of MAGNOLIA. Both deal with
complex plots and big casts of characters. Both involve many conflicts
coming to a head, all within a short time span. But where MAGNOLIA was
grand and almost melodramatic, WONDER BOYS is small and almost mundane.
Like MAGNOLIA, the ensemble acting in WONDER BOYS is very good. Douglas
is clearly the central figure, but none of the other actors seemed
intimidated or too deferential. All the characters had their own, clear
motives; they didn't solely exist as foils for Douglas' Tripp. The
characters were lively and well-rounded, and the actors looked like they
were having fun. 
WONDER BOYS has many good qualities, but I couldn't shake the feeling
that it was a tempest in a teapot. The goings-on at an English
department in Pittsburgh seemed a world away. The department was so
small and close-knit that I never felt like I could know these people;
I'd never be allowed into their clique. Their little problems, amusing
as they were, held no meaning or relevance. Had I never met these
people, never known what happened to their lives on this particular
weekend, at that particular university, I never would have noticed; I
never would have cared.
It may not be completely fair to pan WONDER BOYS for not being grander,
more melodramatic, more meaningful. After all, I try to enjoy every film
on its own terms. This one set modest goals and achieved them very well. 

Title
Review for Scream 2 (1997)
*** (out of 4) SCREAM 2, like its predecessor, is a genre-crossing film.
It is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery. The mix worked very
well last time and it continues to entertain this time. 
SCREAM was also known for its self-referential tone. Many inside jokes
were made in reference to horror movies and Wes Craven. Again, SCREAM 2
follows suit with characters saying such things as "sequels suck" and
"the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels." 
SCREAM 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's. Sidney (Neve
Campbell), having survived the killing spree in SCREAM, is now in
college. Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has written a book about the
murders and that book is now being released as a feature film, called
STAB (which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie SCREAM).
At the premiere of STAB, two students from Sidney's college are stabbed
to death, and a new story begins. 
The press descends on Sidney and her college to get the scoop on this
sequel killer. They want to know all about the links between STAB,
Sidney, and the recent murders. 
The most complex self-reference I saw (this should be an Olympic event)
was the scene where Gale Weathers was asking questions at a press
conference. The rest of the press was watching and videotaping Weathers.
The other survivors from SCREAM were watching and videotaping the press.
The audience was watching the whole, filmed scene. (Whew.) 
The movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a
pleasure to watch. Even better would be to watch a double feature of
SCREAM and SCREAM 2. That's not to say that these references necessarily
make SCREAM 2 a deep, or even a GOOD movie. The just add to the fun of
watching it. I recommend it for other reasons as well. 
What I liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the
monster is not supernatural. No werewolf or ghost or psycho with
superhuman strength is responsible. It is a person in a mask and a robe,
his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims. No
extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer. The down
side is that if you are frightened by horror movies, you have less
grounds to say "it's just a movie." 
The whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - Gale
Weathers and Deputy Dewey (David Arquette, also from the original) track
down a killer. They are likeable, but not outstanding. But in
combination with the horror aspect, the whodunit is a perfect
counterpoint. 
It was exactly a year ago today that I wrote the review for SCREAM. The
Internet Movie Database says that SCREAM 3 is in the works, so I wonder
if I'll be doing the same thing on January 1, 1999. If Craven and
screenwriter Kevin Williamson are able to keep the quality high, I'll be
happy to mark my calendar.

Title
Review for My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)
**** (out of 4) MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is not what I expected. The
previews made it look like a fluffy romantic comedy that follows formula
exactly. After the opening title sequence, I was certain the movie would
be trite and airheaded. 
In fact, the movie is NOT shallow and it breaks from formula in
interesting ways. It was surprising to see that the movie had a soul. 
Julianne (Julia Roberts) gets a call from her long-time bachelor friend
Michael (Dermot Mulroney), three weeks before her 28th birthday. They
had agreed to marry each other if they were both still single by 28, so
Julianne is expecting "the question." If you've seen the previews, you
know that Michael has called to tell her that he's engaged to someone
else, and that Julianne decides that SHE wants to marry Michael, and she
wants to do it now. Meanwhile Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), Michael's fiance,
wants to make Julianne her new best friend, both from Michael's
flattering descriptions and as an alternative to jealousy. 
It's easy to picture such a plot degenerating into a cheesy sitcom:
Julia Roberts concocting zany schemes to break up the wedding, creating
truckloads of wacky hilarity. P.J. Hogan's direction, Ronald Bass's
insightful script and the performances of all the main characters never
allowed that to be a real possibility. The movie is imbued with human
qualities - honesty, kindness, humanity - that most sitcoms - most
MOVIES - never even consider. 
The movie treats all of its characters well. Nobody is evil. Nobody is
"the bad guy" in the disposable villain sort of way. When Julianne
springs a trap on Kimmy, we don't cheer the cruelty because Kimmy is not
a 2-dimensional punching doll. Even the pair of man-hungry sisters
(Rachel Griffiths and Carrie Preston), who are in the movie mainly as
comic relief, are given self-awareness and self-respect. Other family
members may put them down, but the movie itself never condescends. 
MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is effective - some might say manipulative --at
winning you over to its side. For example, Julianne claims to be cynical
about big traditional weddings. But when she sees that her best friend
is going to have one without her, it turns out to be exactly what she -
and we, by our association with her as the hero - wants. Kimmy confides
to Julianne that she is just as sentimental as all the flighty nitwits
she's always pitied at weddings. Her heartfelt confession puts her on
our level and makes it okay for us to open our sentimental sides to the
movie. Even the trailers are effective(/manipulative) by making the
movie look much more simple than it is. I went to the movie "knowing"
exactly how it would play out based on the previews. As I said above, I
was pleasantly surprised by its depth and complexity (though perhaps
only relative to what I expected). 
There is one scene, however, that really won me over and made me love
this movie as much as I did. One of Julianne's schemes is to make
Michael jealous by claiming her handsome gay friend George (charmingly
played by Rupert Everett) is her fiance. 
There is a scene where George spontaneously starts singing shamelessly
in a restaurant. One by one, the other people at the table shed their
inhibitions and join in. Soon the whole big extended family is singing
boldly (and not too badly). After one chorus, the restaurant gives them
a round of applause. Not wanting the moment to end, someone from the
restaurant jumps on the piano and introduces another chorus, and now the
whole restaurant joins in. Everyone in the restaurant becomes one huge
family joined together to sing a love song for the young "couple," (and
each to remember their OWN first love). 
The scene is a modern parallel of a whole tribe joining together at a
feast to celebrate a marriage. What makes it even better is that
everyone in the room wants to join in, but modern barriers of politeness
among strangers keep them from doing so. One by one, the people join in
anyway until the whole room is included. They collectively agree, for a
wonderful moment, to be family, not strangers. 
Not only is this a great moment, but it also adds to the whole of the
movie. During this scene, the only person not singing is Julianne. Her
guilty conscience is starting to haunt her and she can't really
participate in the sincere expression of joy that everyone else in the
restaurant feels. 
Twice I thought the movie's heart was in the wrong place. During the
credit sequence, the movie appears to be about how to win a man. The
notion of treating men as marriage objects seems as shallow and wrong as
treating women as sex objects. Later, Julianne insists that her motives
in chasing Michael are 100% pure love (and not jealousy or "winning").
Both times I winced with disappointment at the movie's vapidity. Both
times, the movie came back to show that the characters themselves, and
not the movie, were wrong. 
Hogan's only other notable experience is his direction of MURIEL'S
WEDDING, which is another great movie that takes the romantic comedy and
adds a difficult twist. One wonders if he will be as good in another
genre, or if it's necessary that he even try. For the meantime, though,
he has found his niche: directing comedies with "Wedding" in the title.

Title
Review for Con Air (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) In a Newsweek story, Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of
Con Air, said that, after reading an earlier version of the script, he
insisted that the movie be more character driven. David Ansen, the
Newsweek reviewer, said that he couldn't detect the subtleties of the
characters through all of the loud explosions.
This particular outing is about an escape. A group of America's worst
criminals are being flown to a new, state-of-the-art jail. Oh, and
Cameron Poe is also on the flight. He's being released to go home to
his wife and daughter. Two of the cons manage to unlock their cuffs,
free the rest of the prisoners, kill most of the guards, and hijack the
plane. Cameron Poe decides to help bring the plane down and return the
criminals to captivity which entails many fights, shooting and of
course, explosions
One scene stood out as an interesting quirk. The entire movie takes
place on or near this airplane. There is very little opportunity for
car crashes.  But one is worked into the script where a body is
jettisoned from the plane and lands on a car. The movie didn't require
that we see the body land; in fact the scene is an interlude, isolated
by the elevator music soundtrack; and just for kicks, three or four
cars crash into the car onto which the body has fallen. You gotta
admire the ability to include a car crash scene into a movie that
doesn't call for it.
John Malkovich was good as the evil leader of the escapees. I almost
wonder if his talents are being wasted, but this seems to be the sort
of role that he takes most often, so I suspect he likes it.
At the end of an action movie, the bad guy has to die, and he has to be
doing something so awful and unrelentingly that he deserves it. Con Air
makes a mistake at the end of the movie by making the villain's death
unnecessarily gruesome. We don't really feel sorry for him, but by the
time he was staring death in the face, he wasn't fighting back
anymore.
Producer Bruckheimer knows what he's doing. He's the man behind Top
Gun, Crimson Tide, The Rock, and now Con Air. His formula is rather
simple:  testosterone, loud rock music, cool explosions, a little plot
here and there, and voila: a summer blockbuster.
One idea that Bruckheimer's been toying with recently is including a
dweebish, bookish young man in the mix and making his masculinity
really show through. In The Rock, Nicolas Cage was more of a scientist
than a mercenary, but he's put in a tough circumstance where he has to
become a mercenary to survive. In Con Air, that role is filled by John
Cusack. Cusack is an upper-middle manager in the prison system, but he
gets some hands-on experience with escaped convicts by the time the
movie's over.
I must admit that I had fun watching this movie, as I did watching all
the other Bruckheimer movies, but it's not a great movie. It may not
even be a good movie, except that it's fun.
Even so, there is something about Jerry Bruckheimer movies that leaves
me feeling a little slimy. First, there is a certain macho, military
point of view to all of his movies. Somehow male posturing is linked to
patriotism in a Bruckheimer film and I have to disagree. There's more
to patriotism than blowing up enemies of society.  And second, the
problem in all Bruckheimer movies is a man (or men) with too much
testosterone, and inevitably, the solution is more testosterone.  I'm
not saying a more feminine attitude would make a better action movie,
but the idea that the solution to violence is more violence is
disquieting.
But that's what we can expect from Hollywood in these June scorchers,
and given the genre, Con Air is okay.

Title
Review for Seven Years in Tibet (1997)
***1/2 (out of 4) SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET is great, in both senses of the
word. Much of the movie takes place in the Himalayas; the setting and
the cinematography are spectacular. Even those who dislike this movie
must admit that. 
But not all of SEVEN YEARS takes place on a mountain. Most of the movie
follows Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) in his dealings with other people.
In fact, if this epic movie has one center, it is Harrer, and on those
terms, this movie is excellent. 
Some critics have complained that there's "too much Brad Pitt, not
enough Dalai Lama." Others criticize the Western condescension of
Eastern culture. The latter comment is a valid complaint, and it is
perhaps the reason this movie doesn't deserve four stars. The former,
though, fails to take the movie on its own terms. This movie tells the
story Heinrich Harrer's life and emotional growth. In that life, the
Dalai Lama is a supporting character. 
The movie opens with "Harry" leaving his pregnant wife in Austria and
setting off to climb Nanga Parbet, a mountain in the Himalayas that his
country has presumptuously adopted as its own. His wife begs him to stay
but, annoyed, he coldly rejects her. At the station, official German
well-wishers are excited for Harry's attempt on Nanga Parbet, and they
give him a Nazi flag to plant on its summit. Coldly, again, he takes
their flag, and it is never seen again. His reasons for leaving Austria
are purely selfish. Neither fatherhood nor fatherland matters to him. 
On their first attempt on Nanga Parbet, Harry's party is beaten by the
weather and has to turn around. They get down to the camp and find
themselves prisoners of war. War has broken out between Britain and
Germany - and by association, India and Austria. 
Harry doesn't take to prison well, and makes several escape attempts
(reminiscent of Steve "The Cooler King" McQueen's role in THE GREAT
ESCAPE). A bitter but resigned "Dear John" letter from his wife, and his
comrades' enthusiasm, inspire one last bold escape attempt. Most of the
prisoners do escape, and most of them are recaptured, but not Harry and
Peter Aufschneiter (David Thewlis). 
The pair make their way out of the unfriendly territory of India and
into neigboring Tibet, but they find they are no more welcome here than
they were in India. They decide to stick together in spite of the
friction between them, and they spend quite a while wandering through
the Himalayas - long enough for them to grow long beards and dark,
leathery suntans. 
Since his wife gave up on him and the world is at war, Harry now has no
reason to go home. In fact, his life has very little purpose at all.
Wandering the beautiful land and encountering its spiritual people, he
begins to fill this void in his life with the Himalayas. 
The movie tells us that Tibetans walk long journeys to pray at distant
altars to atone for past wrongdoings. The longer the walk, the greater
the atonement. It is clear that, deliberate or not, the walking is
clearing Harry's head and his spirit. Harry is beginning to understand
his flaws and internally atone for them. 
But atoning for past sins is only part of Harry's epic journey. Changing
the current and future man is the other half.  
Eventually, driven toward the protection of civilization by bandits,
Harry and Peter find themselves in a caravan entering the forbidden city
of Lhasa, Tibet, where Westerners are not allowed. Once inside, Harry is
caught stealing something to eat (from a dog, no less), but the dog's
owner is kind and invites them to stay. A little influence with the
local politicaians, and Harry and Peter are welcomed into Tibetan
society. 
Harry is invited to an audience with the Dalai Lama (played by three
actors, though mostly by Jamyang Wang Chuck), a young boy who has a
sinful appetite for news and facts from the outside world. Harry handles
the formality of speaking to a Dalai Lama awkwardly, but the boy takes
to him and invites him to become a tutor, of sorts. 
This is where critics complain about Western condescension of Tibetan
culture. It IS presumptuous to take the customs of a different culture
lightly. And it's not just Pitt's character that presumes - Annaud
himself is guilty. He includes a scene, played up for comedy, of
Tibetans treating earthworms very reverently. Ha ha! Those silly
Tibetans! 
Harry has atoned for his past failures, but he still has room for
emotional growth. For example, when his best friend gets married, he
resents their happiness; he is jealous. The last third of the movie
shows Harry teaching the young Dalai Lama and immersing himself in work.
These responsibilities help him grow and genuinely change for the
better. 
I admit I am not a very good judge of acting. And because so many people
talk of Brad Pitt as a filmic object, it's hard to decide if what's
effective is his presence or his performance. Either way, I found his
portrayal of Henry to be very effective; his character genuinely grew
from beginning to end. The change was subtle, but it was there. (And,
hey, he managed to keep his accent all the way through.) 
The other performance that really stood out (for me) was that of Jamyang
Wang Chuck as the 14-year-old Dalai Lama, whose innocence, curiosity,
and wisdom were not marred by bad-child-actor syndrome. 
But maybe the best thing about SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET is the spectacular
setting and cinematography. Even if that were all this movie had in its
favor, it might deserve a recommendation. Luckily, there is more than
just pretty pictures, and this movie is well recommended, but be
prepared to forgive it its Western perspective.

Review for Road Trip (2000)
** (out of 4) ROAD TRIP is a bad college comedy with just a handful of
laughs. It will never be a GOOD movie, and it will only be a FUNNY movie
if you sit in a theater with a big crowd of college students.
In a bracketing story, Tom Green (of MTV fame), playing 7th-year
undergrad Barry, is giving a tour of Ithaca college. He tells his
audience would-be students and their parents about a legendary love in
one particular dormitory....
Josh and Tiffany (Breckin Meyer and Rachel Blanchard), have been
sweethearts since childhood, and they still keep in touch, even though
Josh is at Ithaca and Tiffany studies in Austin.
One lonely night Josh sleeps with another girl, and he videotapes his
tryst for the extra excitement. There is a mix-up, and the incriminating
tape is accidentally sent to Tiffany. With the tape on its way, the only
thing for Josh to do is to drive to Austin and try to beat the U.S.
Mail.
Josh gets three of his friends to go with him. E.L. (Seann William
Scott) is the party animal who can get his friends to agree to anything.
Ruben (Paulo Costanzo) is the guy who fills his brain with philosophy,
trivia, and any drug that might be interesting. Kyle (DJ Qualls) is the
token scrawny nerd who gets to come along because he has access to a
car.
The situation is perfect for a college comedy, but ROAD TRIP doesn't
have enough laughs to capitalize.
For one thing, the jokes were not fast-paced enough. Instead of
exhausting me with joke after joke, like THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,
ROAD TRIP made me wait for every joke, and I dutifully anticipated each
one. During the pauses between jokes I found myself getting ready for
the next moment of comic release.
My audience seemed to feel the same way, like they were primed to laugh,
like they were waiting for the slightest comic trigger. Once we were so
eager to laugh that when the woman next to me blew her nose it got a
polite wave of chuckles.
Another part of the problem lies somewhere between the writers and the
actors. Either Phillips (who also wrote the screenplay) can't write
college dialogue, or the actors didn't know how to work with the
material. In any case, many of the jokes felt forced. E.L. agrees to the
trip by saying "you expect me to stay here and learn?" He sounds more
like someone's vague idea of a college student than an actual student. 
There are a few reasons to recommend ROAD TRIP. The camaraderie of the
four main characters was genuine and eventually interesting. Green's
comic interludes were sick and amusing. Some of the jokes were
unexpected, and therefore quite funny.

Review for Eyes Wide Shut (1999)
**** (out of 4) Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director. I didn't know
who he was until AFTER 1987, the year of his last release, FULL METAL
JACKET. So EYES WIDE SHUT was the first and only Kubrick movie I've seen
in regular release. Maybe my perception is biased, but EYES WIDE SHUT is
excellent.
At a ritzy party, Dr. Bill Harford and his wife Alice (Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman) mingle separately. Bill is approached by two models. They
boldly flirt with the doctor, and he loves the attention. Alice is swept
onto the dance floor by a debonair Hungarian blueblood who makes a pass
at her. She too enjoys the attention and doesn't entirely rebuff the
come-on. Back at home, the two start making love, each having been
turned on by events at the party. This is the famous scene from the
trailers.
Their thoughts from the previous night have been gnawing at them, so the
next night the two talk about sex, about fantasies, and about how sex is
different for men and for women.
The talking turns into arguing. Alice, a little spacey from some
marijuana, and angry from the fight, decides to tell Bill her most
secret fantasy. Once, on vacation, she made eye contact with a naval
officer. In that moment, she fell in love -- not love, but lust -- with
the stranger. She had half hoped, half feared, that they could see each
other again, that they could meet, that they could make love. She tells
Bill, with a touch of provocation, "I was willing to give up EVERYTHING
for one night".
Their argument is interrupted -- which proves to be as frustrating as
being interrupted during sex -- with a phone call. One of Bill's
patients has died, and he has to go visit. The unfinished fight and his
wife's hurtful confession weigh heavy on his mind. After being
propositioned by the grieving daughter of the patient, and harassed by
some gay-bashers, he looks for some kind of sexual release, away from
Alice.
He spends that night, and the next several days, touring the seamy,
sexual underworld of New York in an angry, frustrated funk. Hookers,
ritualistic orgies, and underage prostitutes become the norm, while
visits to home, wife, and child start to seem unreal. But Bill is a
newcomer to this sex-filled world and he can never quite consummate his
desire. At every turn, fate, coincidence, or a false step keeps him
unfulfilled and still searching....
EYES WIDE SHUT is very well crafted. First off, the acting and direction
were great. This was probably Tom Cruise's most challenging role, and he
rose to the occasion, mostly. There were times where I was not convinced
he was a doctor, but his emotional control more than made up for it. His
dip down into obsession was key, and he acted the part well.
Kidman was equally good in a surprisingly small role, particularly
during their fight and their reconciliation. During the fight, Alice
doesn't have the words to clearly tell Bill what she wants him to know.
Kidman is able to convincingly and concisely portray the earnest
frustration of not being understood. Later, at the reconciliation, she
is in the position of power, and Kidman handles this opposite situation
just as well. 
Also, the look of the film is outstanding. Kubrick uses a grainy
film-stock throughout, which I can't explain, except that it might have
been a compromise for the sake of shooting in lower light (something
Kubrick has done before, notably in BARRY LYNDON). Many scenes are lit
in rich, low, golden tones. One set -- the party scene -- is seemingly
lit by thousands of tiny Christmas lights. Or maybe he did it to mask
the scenes using digital effects. The look is consistent and not
inappropriate, but I can't say for sure why Kubrick chose it.
Also, the interior scenes are simply amazing to look at. I already
mentioned the party scene lit by tiny lights. But the most impressive is
the ritual before the orgy. A perfect circle of bright light illuminates
a red-robed figure. Dozens of figures gather around the outside. Every
figure is masked and robed in lush, rich, dark cloth. The first glimpse
is shocking -- not in a cheap, SOUTH PARK way, but somehow disturbing to
the core. And yet it grows on you, which might make it even more
disturbing.
Kubrick's cinematography (carried out by rookie cinematographer Larry
Smith) and editing (by Nigel Galt, until now a sound editor) are
deliberate and exact. One can see a sharp mind making just the right
cut, to just the right angle, at just the right time.
A few examples come to mind: first, during the argument, Bill and Alice
are shown from mostly head-on. But when Alice drops her conversational
bomb, the angle moves to the side -- we are now outsiders looking in,
instead of intimate confidantes.
Later, after a very long sequence at the dark, exotic masquerade/orgy,
Kubrick and Galt cut directly to Bill entering his apartment. The stark,
sharp contrast in settings makes "home" seem so boring, so banal. It
tells us exactly how Bill must have felt coming back to "reality" after
seeing a titillating glimpse of a more sexually exotic world. 
Finally, music plays an important part of the experience, as with 2001:
A SPACE ODYSSEY. In particular, a sad, ominous 2-note theme (Jocelyn
Pook scored the movie) is played slowly on a piano over Bill's
wanderings through the New York underworld. It is like a slower, sadder
version of John Carpenter's theme to HALLOWEEN. It adds the final
dimension to a cohesive, expressionist world.
Perhaps the best thing about EYES WIDE SHUT is its hopeful ending. In a
way, Kubrick is like Dante. He is the guide on a journey through one
particular circle of Hell, but he safely brings us back to where we
started.
I'm sad that there will not be another Stanley Kubrick movie. Nobody
else does so much, so well. Each movie is a masterpiece for a different
reason. 2001 has an incredible look and painstaking detail. BARRY LYNDON
has unbelievable color, scope, and cinematography. PATHS OF GLORY is a
gut-wrenching human tragedy. And EYES WIDE SHUT, well, it has a little
bit of everything.
I really only got to see one NEW Kubrick movie, and that's a great
disappointment. But at least I finally got to see one. I hope another
director comes along with such a high "batting average" (Kubrick's worst
film was probably SPARTACUS, which was still pretty darn good) but I
won't hold my breath. Stanley Kubrick, here's to you.

Review for Shuang long hui (1992)
Twin Dragons is the latest Jackie Chan movie to be re-dubbed and
re-released in the United States (this one is actually 7 years old). As
MOVIES go, it's a good bit of entertainment. Chan wields his usual
charm, grace, and skill, playing identical twins. 
As JACKIE CHAN MOVIES go, it's mediocre. It has some good fight and
stunt sequences, but it lacks a really good one. The story is
interesting enough, and Jackie does alright at separating his two
characters (he's no Jeremy Irons). But identical-twin movies are nothing
new, and in at least one scene the special effects fail miserably. 
Chan 1 grows up with an alcoholic mother who dies young. He becomes a
mechanic and hangs around with his short pal Teddy (Teddy Robin Kwan),
who's always getting in trouble. It's amazing how easily a fight can
break out in these kinds of movies. 
Chan 2 grows up with a silver spoon in his mouth. He becomes a classical
pianist/composer/conductor. While Chan 1 lets his fists fly, Chan 2
waves his arms in front of an orchestra. 
The two come together in Hong Kong. Chan 1 has gotten in trouble with a
crime boss and is trying to flee to China. Chan 2 is in town to play a
concert. The big mix-up starts when their girlfriends fall deeper in
love with the wrong brother, and ends with the two switching identities
just as 1 was supposed to take on the crime boss and 2 was supposed to
conduct his symphony. 
There's not much to say about the plot. It's all driven by the crossed
identities, which you can only do so much with. Also, "the plot" isn't
what Jackie Chan movies are about. Chan movies are about stunts and
fighting and grace and balance. In one sense, Twin Dragons doesn't
disappoint. It has a great boat-chase scene, two or three fun fight
scenes, and not one but TWO big showdowns at the end. 
But when you put it all together, this one lacks the edge, the spark
that's in so many other of his movies. Watching TWIN DRAGONS, I felt
like I had seen it all before as Jackie went through the same routine,
one more time. There's usually an exotic setting or an amazing stunt or
an expensive special effect to make the movie stand apart. TWIN DRAGONS
lacked that something extra. 
The final insult came at the very end of the film as the credits rolled
and ... no outtakes. 
If you really want to see this one, save it for video.

Title
Review for Bulworth (1998)
*** (out of 4) On seeing the outrageous previews for BULWORTH one wonders
what plot could possibly allow Beatty get away with making those statements
(In case you missed it, Warren Beatty plays a politician on the campaign
trail. He says to a black congregation "...if you can't cut down on malt
liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back
who stabs his wife, you're never gonna get rid of me.") 
Well, there is such a plot, and it works very well in this comedy. Beatty
plays Jay Billington Bulworth, a long-time Democratic senator from
California. The movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of Bulworth's
latest commercials condemning affirmative action. The montage is ironically
intercut with pictures of Martin Luther King and Bulworth in his youth
working with Jack Kennedy. When we finally lay eyes on Bulworth he is
morosely weeping in front of his TV, having gone without food or sleep for
days. 
His campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his
depression has sunk in too far for him to care. First he calls a lobbyist
from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance
policy in his daughter's name. Then he calls an associate to arrange for his
own assassination. His assistant Murphy (Oliver Platt) is oblivious to
Bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements. 
Bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an African-American church, then
takes questions from the audience. He is hit hard with questions about his
voting record. He had promised money to help rebuild the community after the
riots, and it hasn't shown up. 
Since he's a dead man anyway, he figures he'll answer truthfully: he and
Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich came to L.A. for the photo opportunity. They
made some promises that improved their public image for a while, and then
counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises
they made. The shock and outrage from the congregation grows, the questions
keep coming, and he keeps shooting back honest, if ugly, answers. 
(Before I go further, I'd like to make a distinction that the Denver Post
failed to make, and that is that characterizing African-Americans as
malt-liquor drinking O.J. fans is not part of Bulworth's "truth." That line
is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political
confessions he makes in the movie. When the critics praise Beatty for
speaking the truth about politics, this line is not what they're talking
about.) 
The experience is liberating. With nothing left to lose, Bulworth is no
longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his
mouth. He can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway.
Why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he
is bought and paid for by lobbyists, and that racism among the populace
protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism? 
Bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church, one of whom,
Nikki (Halle Barry), he gets a crush on. He feels so good afterwards that he
actually eats something. Chicken wings, appropriately enough. 
Bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives.
When one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and
TV ratings, Bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed
entertainment. With so much money and so many talented people working so
hard, he wonders, why can't Hollywood make a quality product. (You go,
Warren!) When they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he
has such a low opinion of their product, he callously admits that it's
because they are rich Jews. 
That night he drops the three African-American volunteers at their
nightclub, and he decides to go in with them. He stays up all night
drinking, smoking pot, dancing, falling in love with Nikki, and learning to
scratch turntables and rap. 
The next day, he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the
suit-and-tie fundraisers. From then on, at all of his political appearances,
he raps his political truth. His rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy.
He's not very good, but it is his first try and at least he's not
embarrassingly bad. His lobbyists are not amused, but the rest of his
constituency seems to like the new Bulworth. 
Eventually, the movie's plot (remember he hired a hit man?) overtakes the
politics, which is too bad. Screen time is spent with Bulworth trying to
cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be
closing in on him. There are even a few gratuitous chase scenes, Bulworth
fleeing his killer. These scenes may have been necessary to keep the events
of the film moving along, but it distracted and detracted from Bulworth's
political ranting, which was much more interesting than the ever-present,
obvious-looking assassin. 
Still, most of the movie is original and very enjoyable, and Beatty deserves
most of credit for bringing it to the screen. As the story and screen
writer, he came up first with a good structure, then with good dialogue to
back it up (Jeremy Pikser co-wrote the screenplay). As an actor, he was able
to convincingly portray Bulworth's depression, then liberation and rebirth.
As a producer (there were four others) he was able to keep the movie free
from Hollywood's indulgent formulas (except for those inexcusable chase
scenes). Someone else probably could have directed, but since he was there
anyway, what the heck. 
It's too bad that there aren't more movies like this around - movies that
tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more
attention to real politics. After all, much of the inspiration for BULWORTH
is straight out of the news. Just a little perception and insight and you
could write your own Bulworth rants. Just don't expect to be popular with
the insurance companies.

Title
Review for Full Monty, The (1997)
*** (out of 4) "The full Monty" is a British phrase meaning full frontal
nudity. That might explain the movie's rabid popularity in England. 
No, even with a lesser title, this movie deserves its popularity. 
The movie starts with an industrial film from 25 years ago hyping the
economic paradise of the steel town of Sheffield. The film jumps 25
years forward to two friends stealing scrap metal from the now-closed
factory. Hard times have since fallen on Sheffield and the people are
desperately unemployed. 
On their way home from their unsuccessful visit to the steel factory,
Gaz (Robert Carlyle) uses a poster for the visiting Chippendale Dancers
show to illustrate the ironies of unemployment to his friend Dave (Mark
Addy). But the poster gives Gaz an inspired idea on how they can make
some money. They'll put on their own strip show, but they'll offer
something Chippendale's doesn't: The Full Monty! 
Dave is reluctant and self-conscious, but decides to humor Gaz, thinking
the notion will pass. But Gaz persists. 
In one of the movie's many visually funny scenes, Gaz does a great
striptease in an old garage to show his friends how it's done. What
makes the scene so funny is that Gaz is so good at the
you-know-you-want-me, over-the-shoulder look. Until now, Gaz has been
your average, former steel worker, GUY. Suddenly, he has all the right
moves and all the right looks. The change is so unexpected and so well
executed, we can't help but laugh. 
Gaz hires more and more out-of-work steel workers; some for their
dancing, some for their moves, and one of them for his . . . . uh . . .
. Monty. Soon there are enough of them to stage a show. 
The story is rather predictable, but that doesn't detract from the movie
any. It still has just the right mix of comedy and sympathy. Its
characters are funny, but they are not made fun of. 
For example, Gaz and Dave cause another character to flub a job
interview. The way they do it is hilarious (another one of those great
visually comic scenes), but the victim is human, and when we see the
joke from his point of view, it's more painful than funny. 
And when they remove their clothes, we can see the dancers'
insecurities. We laugh not because they are the butt of a joke, but
because they can laugh at themselves in an awkward and uncomfortable
situation. 
The only flaw I perceived was that the ending of the movie was too
abrupt. After an entire movie leading up to one inevitable climax, I
would have liked a little more time to come down. 
If you do go see THE FULL MONTY, there is an interesting question to ask
yourself afterwards. Could the movie have worked if the sex roles were
reversed. Would it be possible to make a comedy about "average" women
becoming strippers to earn a little money? Mabye it could be called Full
Reverse Monty.

Review for Sixth Sense, The (1999)
***1/2 (out of 4) People have said they appreciate a warning when a
movie ought to be seen without any foreknowledge -- when a review might
somehow take away from the experience. I recommend The Sixth Sense
pretty strongly, and it is a movie that's better if you don't know too
much about it. If you think you might see it, don't read any reviews
until afterwards.
THE SIXTH SENSE may look like a horror movie, but it isn't one. The mood
is tense, but never outright frightening. The movie is not so much a
horror movie as a psychological, supernatural thriller.
Cole (Haley Joel Osment, age 11 -- he played Forrest Gump Jr.) is in a
constant state of fear: he is withdrawn, he wakes up screaming, he shows
signs of possibly self-inflicted scratches and scars. He has a secret
that he keeps from his mother (Toni Collette, of "Muriel's Wedding"), so
she is unable to help with, much less understand, Cole's condition.
Their best hope for Cole is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.
Dr. Crowe (Bruce Willis) is Philadelphia's best child psychologist. He
saw a case remarkably like Cole's once before, but in the end, he
couldn't help the patient. This time, however, he is determined to
succeed. 
Dr. Crowe slowly builds trust in Cole, through psychological insight,
through humor, through constant attention. He is finally able to win
Cole's complete trust by baring his own soul: Crowe admits he's afraid
to lose his wife because of his obsession with Cole's case. Cole finally
confides in the doctor and tells his secret: he can see ghosts.
These undead souls are everywhere, in the physically gruesome state of
their deaths. Cole is wakened by them, terrorized by them, and sometimes
even assaulted by them. Dr. Crowe's job suddenly moves way out of his
league, but his promises to Cole and Cole's hard-won trust lock him in
to finishing the job, to doing what he can to help the kid cope.
The film is not perfect, but it is pretty darn good. Shyamalan's
direction is tightly controlled and very well executed. Willis breaks
from his tough-guy image and gives a surprisingly sensitive performance.
Osment is above average for a child actor, and he portrays fear expertly
(although his performance is a little uneven at times.)
But the best thing about the movie is not an individual trait. It is
that all the elements come together to produce the eerie atmosphere that
empathizes with the haunted child. The movie is shot under overcast
skies and cold, fluorescent lights. When night comes and Cole tenses
with fear, the audience tenses with him. The ghosts are rarely glimpsed,
and never for more than a creepy instant. We share Cole's hope that
Crowe can help, and his gray acceptance that he probably can't.
As I said, the film is not perfect. The introduction to Malcolm and his
wife is disgracefully clunky, and the ending is uneven, particularly
compared with the level tension of the rest of the film, but neither
ruined the picture, not by any means.
Look for this movie on my 1999 top ten list.

Title
Review for Crash (1996)
** (out of 4) The opening titles of CRASH are very interesting
(probably the best since SEVEN). Mysterious, haunting music plays while
crisp chrome names come slowly flying from the darkness. There is a
light, somewhere in the background, but its source is vague. Its source
is not as important as its effect on the chrome and interaction with the
darkness. Soon, some of the letters start turning up damaged. The chrome
is still polished, smooth, and sexy, but the underlying metal has been
stressed.
The mood of the sequence invites intimacy and asks to draw you into the
space behind the screen. At first, there's no reason not to give in, but
the damaged letters, replated in chrome imply some sort of darkness and
deception waiting beyond.
CRASH explores the connection between people and their cars in terms of
sexuality. In one sense, a person's car is an extension of their body,
and CRASH asks, with this in mind, what are the mechanics of sex? Not
reproduction, but sex. The only answer -- the only way two cars can
really interact -- is to crash. Simple enough. Some of the characters do
seem to be turned on by cars crashing, as if each bump were a nudge from
an agreeable pelvis. Some of the characters even tattoo themselves with
hood ornaments.
But there's more. CRASH also treats people as separate from their cars.
Crashes and sex are linked -- not interchangeable -- and crashes can
result in damage to the real human body. This introduces another
dimension of sexuality to the car crash. If car crashes can be sexual,
then the resulting damage to the human body can be a fascinating,
arousing secretion of this "sex." All of these ideas can be fascinating
and arousing, not to a strange literally metaphoric car-person, but to
real humans aroused by the whole subject, the movie seems to say.
The connection between cars, crashes, bodies, and sex is subtle, at
least in the real world. Cronenberg does explore the connection, but
more as a theme than as a metaphor. Perhaps "fetish" is a better word
because a fetish is a nonsexual object of sexual desire. Yet even this
is too literal a connection for CRASH. The connection in CRASH
encompasses all of these elements.
There is a scene in which the connection works particularly well. Three
characters are in a convertible, two, Vaughan and Catherine (played by
Elias Koteas and Deborah Unger) in the back seat. The car is taken to a
car wash because there is some blood on it. As the top of the car goes
up, the top on the woman comes down and the couple in the back seat
start making out. The car is now a closed dark intimate place making a
slow journey through a steamy soapy dark passage. The scene is paced
very slowly and each new phase of the car wash brings a new strange
rhythmic sound from the brushes hitting the car. The surround sound
places you (in your own dark theater) into the cramped cozy cockpit of
the black '64 Lincoln, and you can carry the metaphor one more step if
you like.
There are other spots where the connection is more of a stretch. For
Vaughan, car crashes are arousing and recreating famous car crashes is
like having sex with his favorite stars and starlets. The crash is a
substitute for sex. The attraction is never explained and the connection
is not inherently obvious, but Cronenberg handles Vaughan's fetish in
the same tone as he handles everyone else's desires.
Another connection Cronenberg explores in CRASH is the one between
sexual orifices and wounds caused by accidents (see also VIDEODROME).
Vaughan's girlfriend Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette) has suffered a lot of
damage to her body. She wears a body brace and has a long wound on the
back of her thigh of folded skin. This is apparently arousing to a
Mercedes salesman and to main character James Ballard (James Spader),
who eventually has his way with the thigh. In an earlier scene, James
survives a car crash, but his leg is damaged and it has to be pinned.
The steel pins penetrate through James' skin, deep into his bones, like
some cold permanent copulation. Another shot shows body damage to a
slick silver sports car. The seam between the door and fender has been
wrinkled and widened, which James runs his hand across and admires.
Let me take the opportunity to restate that while I can appreciate what
Cronenberg is attempting, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
However, often the tone of a dream is more important than the events
that transpire. The events could be true, but they don't make a lot of
sense under scrutiny of daylight. Being afraid or sad or angry because
of the events in a dream tells you something interesting about your
state of mind.
In that sense, CRASH is like a dream. The opening credits help to set a
dark, sad, brooding tone, and the rest of the movie follows suit. It's
almost as if the movie is asking for pity, except that it presents the
subjects, not pitiably, but enticingly, envelopingly. The movie is like
a siren whose song is not beautiful but sad and hypnotizing nonetheless.
What is true of the opening titles is true of the tone of the whole
movie. It is mysterious and intriguing and it invites you in, but there
is some odd mixture of sincerity (the damaged letters, the repulsive
connection between cars and sex) and slickness (the polishing of those
letters in fresh chrome, the sexiness and sexuality of the cast and
their cars).
In conclusion, I would have to say that CRASH is not as disturbing as it
was hyped to be, but I don't understand why someone would make this
movie. A case can be made connecting cars, crashes, bodies, and sex, but
it doesn't seem like this was a statement waiting to be made. There was
nothing wrong with CRASH; it was interesting on its own terms, but
ultimately I am left asking "okay, but so what?"

Title
Review for Blade (1998)
*** (out of 4)"Movies based on comic books represent one of the last best
hopes for visionary filmmaking." -- Roger Ebert 
Ebert was thinking of DARK CITY and SPAWN, as well as BLADE, when he made
that statement. Taken together, these three make a solid foundation for a
new genre of movies.  
These films rely on, and make the best use of, the latest film technology.
Innovations in costumes, make-up, set design, editing, and computer effects
are integrated more fully in these movies than in films like GODZILLA or
ARMAGEDDON. 
In SPAWN, the costumes and make-up took center stage. In DARK CITY, it was
the use of models and set design. In BLADE, it is editing, fight
choreography, and special effects. 
BLADE is a vampire movie that modernizes the whole mythology. Vampires have
been around long enough that science is beginning to understand them.
Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) has studied them for years and knows
empirically how vampirism works. "Crosses don't do squat. Silver works.
Sunlight, UV rays, vampire mace: silver nitrate, essence of garlic." 
One of the movie's characters is Dr. Karen Jensen (N'Bushe Wright), a
hematologist. When she gets pulled into the story, she is able to shed light
on how the blood of vampires reacts. She sees a similarity between the
vampire virus and sickle-cell anemia. She may even have a cure. 
These two characters are sidekicks, interesting in their own right, but
ultimately supporting the comic-book hero, Blade (Wesley Snipes). Where
these two are thinkers, Blade is a doer. He makes his living sending
roomfuls of vampires to their permanent deaths. 
Blade has superhuman powers. A vampire halfbreed (his mother was bitten
while pregnant), he has the strength and quickness of a vampire, without the
aversion to sunlight and garlic. He is adorned with lethal and inventive
gadgets, and he wears black rubber with an overcoat that's almost a cape. 
Blade is tracking down a vampire named Frost. He knows that something big is
happening in the vampire world, and he knows that Frost's power is
increasing. He is determined to stop Frost before he and the other vampires
gain any more power over the humans. 
Frost, meanwhile, is tracking down Blade, whom the vampires call "The
Daywalker." Frost plans to capture him and use his blood to summon an
ancient vampire god. 
The plot sounds corny and adolescent, but the movie is based on a comic
book. The entire production has the look, pacing, and intensity of a comic
book. Because the movie went for it whole-heartedly, it is much easier to
accept the plot and enjoy the movie on its own terms. 
This film is very bloody. In fact, there was a bloodbath scene early on that
was reminiscent of Peter Jackson's gore-fest, DEAD-ALIVE. But whereas the
blood in that film (and other horror films) was gratuitously gross, in this
one, it serves the plot. In that one, the blood was there for its own sake,
shocking in and of itself. In this movie, the blood is not just shocking, it
is also frightening because of what it reveals. Not even in Kubrick's THE
SHINING was a visual bloodbath so effectively used. 
Because the blood is motivated, BLADE is less gory than a slasher flick, and
the movie has a lot else going for it. 
The fight scenes between Blade and the vampires are some of the
best-choreographed in recent memory, this side of Hong Kong. When Blade's
silver weapons kill a vampire, there is an interesting visual effect of
dissipation, almost too quick to see. You have to watch close to see it. And
with the audience watching so closely it's hard to pull off a fight scene
where one man takes on a roomful of enemies. Too often, the director uses
closeups and quick cuts to distract you while the bad guys pile up.
Norrington choreographed the fights, giving you a sense of what's happening
with each individual combatant. 
Snipes makes a good comic-book hero. He seems to be aware of how he will
look on-screen and exaggerates just the right gestures to make him seem a
believably imposing figure. Ebert also credits him with a sadness that
accompanies the superhero way of life, and I agree to the extent that
sadness and a neurotic drive are intermixed. Either way, Snipes captured
that emotion without lingering too long on it. 
I would also add that part of Snipes' success in the role comes from his
being a producer of the film. As a producer, he would have more control over
how Blade would be presented, better allowing his performance to match the
goals of the production. 
The music served its purpose well in this movie. It was symphonic enough to
be a film score, with enough techno-industrial beats to keep it dark and
up-to-date. There are a few scenes of Blade pondering his mother's fate
where the music takes on an eastern mystical sound. The music always sounded
good, and it always served the needs of the film. 
Blade is well-made and I really enjoyed it. But I acknowledge that it isn't
for everyone. Even though it is R-rated, it seems to be aimed at adolescent
boys, the ones who read the comic books. If there are such things as "chick
flicks" and "guy flicks," this is one of the latter, so take my
recommendation as you will. 
But if you are interested, or if you can allow yourself to enjoy a movie
like this on its own terms, by all means go see it.

Title
Review for What Dreams May Come (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4) WHAT DREAMS MAY COME breaks new ground. The special
effects that make Heaven look like a romantic-era painting are
astounding and outstanding. The story is okay, but it alone shouldn't
get you into the theater. You should be going for the visual treat. 
Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams), a doctor, is on his way home when he
comes upon a car crash. He runs to the injured victim to give aid.
Another car fails to slow down and smashes into Chris, killing him.
After a short stint as a ghost, Chris heads up to Heaven where his guide
Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) shows him the ropes. 
Chris and his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra) shared a love of romantic
paintings, so Chris' version of heaven is made of, and made to look
like, paint. Chris' fanciful heaven fills the big screen and it looks
wonderful. The sky is full of blue brushstrokes, the ground is covered
with vibrantly colored flowers that turn into goopy paint when touched.
A minimalist bird swims through the painted sky. There are only a
handful of shots where you get to see his painted heaven, but they alone
are worth the price of admission. 
After he gets over the beauty of his heaven, (and turns it back into
something more closely resembling reality, something less costly to
film), Chris recalls his life in a series of flashbacks. Chris loved his
wife Annie too much and his kids not enough. Both of his kids died
before him (also in a car crash). Annie took their deaths very hard - so
hard she had to be committed to an institution. Chris on the other hand
let go, perhaps a little too easily. The difference in the way they
dealt with the loss of their children nearly forced Chris and Annie to
split. Her profound sadness was a place where he could not join her. 
Chris is just getting used to Heaven when Albert brings him news of
Annie's death. Annie has committed suicide. Suicides, the movie tells
us, automatically go to "the other place." Chris again lets go of his
children in favor of his wife. Instead of looking them up in Heaven, he
makes that heroic journey into Hell to save her soul. 
Done right, Ward and screenwriter Ronald Bass could have made their hero
into the next Dante or Orpheus. But the story is so full of compromises
and internal inconsistencies that Chris Nielsen will not be remembered. 
For one thing, Chris is no hero. His threadlike attachment to his kids
and slavish devotion to his wife cast a selfish shadow from him. But,
you say, common, fallible people make the BEST heroes. Maybe that's
true, but if Chris is Everyman and not a heroic figure, then he
shouldn't be the first to make the journey to and from Hell. It should
be happening all the time. 
For another, given the film's non-religious view of Heaven, it was dumb
to say that all suicides automatically go to Hell. Depression, a leading
cause of suicide, is widely recognized as a disease and not as a
character flaw. After the loss of a husband and child, a person with
depression could easily be pushed over the edge. If this film's heaven
were based on a strict religious doctrine, at least it might be
internally consistent to damn her, but by picking "rules" to fit the
story (and at the same time apologizing for those rules), the film
relinquishes any solid foundation that might have made it a great film. 
Finally, it seems like there should be some cost for stealing a soul
from Hell. This story is perfectly set up for a little tragedy. The
hints at Chris' selfishness seem to invite a little Faustian tradeoff.
Perhaps he could have been made to sacrifice something of himself in
trade for Annie's soul. But the bright and vivid tone of the movie made
that option impossible and doomed this movie to be empty calories from
the candy rack. 
In spite of these easy shortcuts, the film still has the trappings of a
good heroic journey. That is to say that Chris' journey is not really
about the journey, it's about setting his mind right. The reward comes
not because of how far he traveled, but because of how much he has
grown. If you try hard, you can make yourself see Chris as that heroic
icon, but the effort may or may not be worth it. 
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is hard to evaluate. On the one hand, its failures
were disappointing. On the other hand, it made a nice attempt on a story
that hasn't been made in recent memory. I can't fully praise it, but I
can't just write it off, either. 
The deciding factor for me was the film's incredible visual canvas. Not
only were the "painted" effects amazing, but the sets and costumes, both
in Heaven and in Hell were imaginative and apt. The overall look was
original enough and impressive enough that I can fairly recommend this
movie. 
If you're at all interested in seeing it, go now, not later. This movie
will never look as good on your TV (or at the Cinema Saver) as it will
on a big screen.

Title
Review for Breakdown (1997)
***1/2 (out of 4) BREAKDOWN is a very good, tense thriller that makes
very few mistakes. From the beginning, the movie grabs your attention
and doesn't let go. 
Other reviewers have compared BREAKDOWN to THE VANISHING, an excellent
Dutch-French thriller, remade (poorly, so I hear) under the same name in
America. The story is similar to THE VANISHING, and by comparison,
BREAKDOWN is not as good. But BREAKDOWN is not THE VANISHING, and on its
own terms, it excels. 
Jeff and Amy Taylor (Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan) are driving from
Massachusetts to California. They make it as far as Arizona before their
brand-new Jeep breaks down. Amy catches a ride to the nearest phone
booth with a friendly trucker, then disappears completely. 
A bit of luck leads Jeff to the very truck that was supposed to have
taken Amy to the diner. He stops the truck and questions the driver, who
claims never to have met him before in his life. Another bit of luck
brings the local police to the scene. The cop listens to each man's
story, searches the truck, then, finding no incriminating evidence,
sends the trucker on his way. 
Jeff, now confused, frustrated and angry, heads back to the diner to
demand some answers. But nobody's talking there, either. He's about to
call the police again when a local feeb drops a clue. Jeff follows the
tip and starts tracking down the kidnappers. 
Kurt Russell gives a seamless performance as the frustrated husband. His
performance, combined with a well-timed screenplay, elicits empathy from
the audience. When he is afraid, we fear for him. When he gets the upper
hand, we are righteously pissed too. Also, Russell comes off as a
regular guy. That is to say, he does not come across as some
wisecracking action-movie hero. Though there are action sequences, this
is not an action movie; it's a thriller. Russell realizes this and plays
his role accordingly. 
But since it came up, I have to say that the action sequences are top
notch. One sequence involves Jeff holding on to, and moving around in
the undercarriage of a moving semi. The sequence is genuinely tense
without coming off as a superhuman feat. Another sequence involves two
cars and a semi chasing a utility truck. The driving stunts appear to be
genuine which not only adds to the tension, but is a refreshing change
in this age of sterile, computer-animated action scenes. 
The action scenes bothered some critics. They say that the movie is
ambiguous: that it tries to be both a thriller and an action movie.
Comparing it to THE VANISHING, they are right. But as I said, BREAKDOWN
is not THE VANISHING. 
THE VANISHING has a dark, psychological ending. BREAKDOWN has an
explosive physical ending. Perhaps this is the difference between French
and American cinema. I like both, but neither should be the standard by
which the other is judged.  
A few other details struck me as particularly well thought out. 
First, the villains are not dumb or reactive. They have their own
motives and schemes, which makes the story much more complex and
interesting. What appears to be coincidence is often careful planning on
the part of the villains. 
Second, the last real dialog in the movie is a few minutes back from the
end. There is nothing anyone could have said to make the ending any
better or more meaningful, so Mostow gives us a few moments to react to
the story and to "come down" from the tension. There is some ambient
sound, but music doesn't even come up on the credits for several
seconds. It's a nice rest after a loud and tense 90 minutes. 
There are a few flaws in the movie. They certainly don't overshadow the
movie's strengths, but I will mention them in the spirit of fairness. 
For example, the kidnappers had Jeff exactly where they wanted him about
halfway through the movie. The right action on their part could have
guaranteed their victory. The reason for their inaction is never
revealed. [ON SECOND THOUGHT, AND AFTER A REASONED EXPLANATION FROM MY
BROTHER, I REALIZE "THE RIGHT ACTION" COULD HAVE BEEN THE WRONG ACTION.
THAT'S ONE LESS FLAW WITH THE MOVIE.] 
Also, the kidnappers, though smart, were a bit stereotyped. Someone else
aptly compared them to the inbred hicks from DELIVERANCE. Also, their
operation didn't seem big enough to justify the magnitude of their
crimes. The risks didn't seem to be worth the rewards (though this could
be my flawed view distorted by other, more exaggerated movies). 
These are minor flaws, though, in an otherwise engrossing and riveting
movie.

Title
Review for Straight Story, The (1999)
***1/2 (out of 4) David Lynch revealed his view of America on TWIN
PEAKS. He continues his offbeat portrait with the true story of Alvin
Straight.
Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is an old Iowan with hip,
circulation, and lung problems (to name a few). He lives with his
Daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) who has a strange, Lynchian speech
impediment. They get a call from Wisconsin, where Alvin's brother has
just had a stroke. Alvin moons and pines for a few days -- he's not
really fit for travel-- but ultimately decides to go visit. With all his
health problems, the only vehicle he can legally operate is a riding
mower, so he hooks his old Red's to a trailer and heads north across
Iowa.
At first his journey is merely functional: the destination is the goal.
But over time it becomes Alvin's last great quest, the thing that will
give meaning to his last years of life. Offers for help are politely
answered with "I wanna finish this one my own way." It becomes a ritual
for him, a way to put all his affairs right before he goes.
Along the way Alvin meets a handful of characters. I was going to say
"colorful" characters, but on reflection, they all seemed pretty
ordinary. What makes them seem quirky is that they are presented in a
David Lynch film.
Lynch has a unique talent for making the ordinary seem strange. He does
this by focusing attention on details that most directors would gloss
over. Alvin meets a woman who has hit a deer with her car every day this
week. It's not implausible, but when that's all we know about a person,
they might seem, well, "colorful."
Lynch does likewise with props and scenes. A shot of a sprinkler stays
on screen long enough to give it some significance. It has nothing to do
with the plot, but Lynch lingers, obsessed with this detail. In another
scene, Alvin buys a grabber tool from the local Ace hardware store. The
scene might have been shortened or cut altogether by another filmmaker,
but Lynch shows the whole 2-minute transaction between Alvin and the
clerk. Why? Only Lynch knows.
Other trademarks of Lynch's are beautifully photographed settings and
appropriately evocative music. Twin Peaks was set in the foggy northwest
scored by a sad, simple electric bass. This time the cinematographer is
Freddie Francis, who shot CAPE FEAR and Lynch's DUNE. He captures all
the lush beauty of the Midwest. Rows of corn, rolling hills, vast
expanses of fields and roads all fill his wide screen. The music (by
Angelo Badalamenti, who also scored TWIN PEAKS) has a calm, folksy feel
that matches the cinematography perfectly.
The worst thing about THE STRAIGHT STORY is that it is slow. The pace of
the movie matches Alvin's own pace, which is ambling, at best. Combine
this with Lynch's lingering details, and to the casual viewer or the
average 8-year old, THE STRAIGHT STORY could be downright boring.
But this movie isn't about action or events. It's about characters,
reflection, and old age. Taken on its own terms, THE STRAIGHT STORY is
an excellent, thoughtful piece of filmmaking.  

Title
Review for Newton Boys, The (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4) This is the first Linklater movie that didn't look like one
(no angst-ridden gen-Xers in this one). It's also the first Linklater movie
that I haven't been pleasantly surprised with. I suspect there's a
correlation.  
THE NEWTON BOYS is Linklater's most mainstream and conventional effort so
far. It is the self-proclaimed "true story of the most successful bank
robbers in the history of the United States." Starring Matthew McConaughey,
Skeet Ulrich, and Ethan Hawke, this movie also has a pretty high hunk
quotient (about a .675, almost as high as "Young Guns"). 
Willis Newton (McConaughey) hooks up with a couple of bank robbers who pull
a small job in the middle of nowhere. They ride into town in broad daylight
and make off with very little money before the local sheriff, in a
newfangled horseless carriage, shoots two of the three robbers. After Willis
escapes with his friend Glasscock (Dwight Yoakam, who is proving to be a
capable actor after his impressive debut in SLING BLADE), they talk about
what went wrong. 
They agree that the idea of a daylight robbery is just plain stupid. A night
robbery would have been much easier and more successful. They decide to
prove their hypothesis by robbing a bank at night. Willis enlists the aid of
his brothers (Ulrich, Hawke, and Vincent D'Onofrio) and before long, they
are robbing banks left and right. 
They are very successful. They rob at night, and they only attack banks they
know have square safes, which are susceptible to nitroglycerine explosives.
They are in and out before anybody can organize a posse. 
Their luck runs out in Canada, when a bank that was supposed to have a
square safe has gone to the uncrackable round-fronted kind. Willis,
desperate to make SOMETHING from his trip to Canada, organizes an ambitious
attempt at a daylight robbery. The Newtons prove to be as good at daylight
robberies as Linklater is at mainstream movies. Out of their element, the
robbery goes bad and the boys are lucky to escape unharmed. 
Glasscock and the Newtons realize that their bank robbing days are done
because everyone has gone to round safes (largely because of their success).
They are rich enough to retire, but they want one last big score. They
almost pull off a difficult train robbery, but can't quite make it work.
They mistakenly shoot one of their own men, payoffs to the Chicago mob
aren't made in time... before long they are all arrested. The movie ends
with the Newton boys getting light sentences because of their lovable
good-ole-boy demeanors. 
Linklater seems very taken with the "real story" of the Newton Boys. At the
end of the film he reveals what really happened to each character after
getting out of prison. Even over the credits he includes documentary footage
of Willis Newton recounting his youth and of Johnny Carson interviewing Joe
Newton on "The Tonight Show." There is so much information on the real
Newton boys that it is distracting. 
My first thought was that Linklater should have spent his energy making a
documentary. My second thought was that a more interesting movie might have
been made by someone who wasn't so taken with the real story. An adaptation
farther from the truth might have made a better movie. Here's why: 
As interesting as their story is, it doesn't necessarily lend itself to film
- it doesn't have much of an ending. They go to jail, get out, and live to
old age. Not exactly an exciting denouement. It's an interesting fact but it
doesn't really cap the conflict of the rest of the film. 
Also, there are too many characters that are too similar. Sure, each Newton
boy has a distinct personality, but their bank robbing careers are so
defining that their differences seem small by comparison. There is a slight
emphasis on Willis' character, but there is no single point of focus for the
film and the result is a movie that seems a little too even, a little too
flat. A bit more contrast might have been farther from the truth, but it
would have made a better movie. 
I have no other complaints about THE NEWTON BOYS. There are even a few areas
that I'd praise. Linklater's fabricated and computer-generated prairie town
was surprising in it's realism and insignificance in the landscape. The
music consists of modern recordings of period jazz, an  interesting
approach, well-suited to this film. But overall, the movie failed to capture
my imagination. 
Linklater is great at recording the pulse of his generation. He's a natural
with dialogue, self-discovery and angst.THE NEWTON BOYS gives him little
opportunity to do what he's good at. It's the kind of movie most anyone
could have directed, and it's too bad someone else didn't beat him to it.
Still, It looks like THE NEWTON BOYS was a labor of love for him, so perhaps
it's doesn't signal a permanent change in his style. We can only hope that
the director of SLACKER hasn't sold out.

Title
Review for Six Days Seven Nights (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4) 6 DAYS lacks originality. The whole thing is unabashedly
made from a cookie cutter. In this type of formula movie there is a danger
that you might be bored while "clever" moviegoers next to you predict
dialogue and actions. On the other hand, this type of film never has any
real danger of being utterly awful. It's a safe bet for a summer movie;
disposable, lightweight, and a decent distraction for two hours. 
Robin (Anne Heche) is on a tropical vacation with her potential fiancé
(David Schwimmer) when she is called away, just for 18 hours, to take care
of a project at work. The only pilot she can find is the coarse unrefined
drunkard (Harrison Ford) who flew her in. Halfway back to her job, a storm
comes up and causes them to crash on a deserted island. The two have to set
up house long enough for the search and rescue crew to find them. 
Robin thinks Quinn (Ford) is uncouth and Quinn thinks Robin is a stuck-up
prig. Naturally, they fall in love. Meanwhile, Frank (Schwimmer) and Quinn's
busty companion Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors), distraught over the possible
deaths of their loved ones, seek solace in each other's arms. Everything
works out perfectly for the great square dance of romantic comedy (don't
forget the false endings!). 
Still, the movie is pretty enjoyable, rated just above your average romantic
comedy. The first redeeming factor is the casting. Ford and Heche have a
pretty good chemistry. It's not a sexual chemistry; it's their banter and
their complementary strong wills that make them a good pair. Ford is showing
his age, but he still looks good, and he's got that grin that makes him
perfect for this movie. Heche holds her own against Ford, and thankfully,
her part was written just right. She was not a helpless porcelain woman, nor
was she a cold fish in need of thawing out. (Ugh, I I just quoted LOST IN
SPACE. Somebody kick me.) 
The dialogue is well written and well suited to the characters. There is a
scene in which a snake swims up Robin's shorts. Quinn comes to her aid, but
he doesn't just pull the thing out. The two stand hip-deep in water and talk
about the situation for a while. Each moment they delay is another moment of
tension, broken by a funny line, a double entendre, or a charming smirk. Yet
in spite of this obviously contrived situation, the humor never seemed forced. 
Another redeeming factor was the location and cinematography. The film was
shot on the island of Kauai in Hawaii, which allowed for lots of great
travelogue cinematography. In fact, this movie made me realize how rewarding
outdoor location shooting is and how rare it has become. Veteran
cinematographer Michael Chapman was not afraid to dwarf the characters with
the scenery. Often our heroes are small dots on a lush beautiful landscape.
I found myself surprised by how many medium and long shots there were in
this film, which probably goes to show that I have become used to the
cheaper technique of using a single long shot cutting straight to a closeup.
Chapman broke from that trend and it really paid off. 
Finally, I was pleased that the movie had a good heart. Frank and Angelica,
(Quinn and Robin's counterparts) were nice, likeable people. They were not
jealous or selfish or greedy. Sometimes a film will make the old
boyfriend/girlfriend insanely jealous or cruel so that we can root for the
heroes to end up together. Instead, Reitman allowed the CIRCUMSTANCES make
us root for the heroes to fall in love. The old lovers had their flaws, but
they weren't reduced to two-dimensional villains. 
6 DAYS is no instant classic, in spite of the qualities it has going for it.
But these qualities do help lift a formulaic plot from mediocre to
enjoyable. It's not original, but it's a decent distraction for two hours.

Title
Review for Snake Eyes (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4) The opening shot of Snake Eyes is great. It lasts for about
ten minutes, uninterrupted. Its geographic range is increased by the careful
use of video monitors receiving signals from elsewhere.  
The technical skill required to pull off the long shot at the beginning is
formidable. Such a carefully planned and executed shot leads one to expect
the same from the script. At first the script IS tight and twisty, but its
resolution is a mediocre anticlimax. 
Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) is a crooked Atlantic City cop, "covering
security" at one of the biggest boxing events of the year. In the big
introductory shot, he freely takes money in exchange for favors and
schmoozes with the powerful, rich, and sleazy elements of the city. 
The only unusual thing about security at this match is that the Secretary of
Defense is attending. Escorting the Secretary is Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise),
an old friend of Nick's. The fight moves on, and at the knockout punch, a
shot is heard. The Secretary has been hit. Another shot rings out, a woman
in a wig is hit as Nick throws her to the ground. 
Before the cops arrive, Dunne breaks down in front of Nick. He failed in his
assignment to protect the Secretary and is worried for his job and his
family. Nick suggests they get their stories straight before any
investigators show up. 
Eventually Nick and Dunne split apart to investigate the crime, starting
with the mystery woman. Given enough time alone, Nick starts to piece
together the mystery. 
The setup and investigation are interesting and well-told. De Palma uses
flashbacks to tell the same story from different points of view. With each
flashback, another piece of the story falls into place. This part of the
film is very good. 
Then it becomes clear what happened, or at least who is responsible. At this
point, the movie stops being so interesting. Instead of tantalizing clues
and a clever villain, we have slow chase scenes and a conventional killer.
The resolution of the film is anticlimactic, a ho-hum mix of guns and lucky
timing. 
In order to allow for De Palma's elaborate camera movement, there needs to
be lots of light, which means it can't be controlled as tightly. As the
movie's tone darkens, the lighting seems to get brighter and more even. In
JACKIE BROWN, the bright lights and solid colors seemed to be an ironic
twist, but in this movie, it seems like a cost-cutting compromise. 
Also, Sinise was the wrong choice for Commander Dunne. He never really
filled his uniform with the qualities demanded by the role. Granted, it was
a hard role to fill, with lots of acting-within-acting going on. But Sinise
just never had me convinced of anything. 
Cage, on the other hand, was very good. He's a crooked cop, taking money
wherever he can find it. As long as he's getting his share, his morality
threshold is low. The perfect example of his idea of ethics is brought out
when a whistleblower comes forward and asks for his protection. This cop's
first reaction is not to help her, but to verbally abuse her for breaking
her boss' trust, for violating the code of the good-ol'-boy network, for
expecting the world to play by the rules. But there is a glimmer of morality
left in him and by the end, his faith in the network is really put to the
test (in one of the movie's more clever developments). 
Two minor characters turned in great performances too. In the ring, the
boxer had such a look of humility and fear that one couldn't help but feel
sorry for him, even as he beat his opponent senseless. And Carla Gugino, a
relative newcomer, held her own on the screen with Cage and Sinise. 
De Palma's last film was MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, a great movie, well-written and
tightly executed. SNAKE EYES has similar aspirations, but it doesn't come close.

Review for Falkens öga (1998)
*** (out of 4) If a bird were to make a documentary about itself -- free
from any human commentary or anthropomorphizing -- it might look
something like KESTREL'S EYE, showing at the International Film Series
on Wednesday.
Filmmaker Mikael Kristersson placed remote control cameras in and around
the tower of a Swedish church where a pair of kestrels live. These
cameras observe the comings and goings of the birds to and from their
nest. Another camera watches the birds in a nearby field where they
hunt. Still another camera flies low over the country landscape to give
a kestrel's-eye view of flight.
On PBS or The Discovery Channel, this footage would be set to sober
narration or emotional music. The voiceover would explain what the
kestrels were doing, and why. The footage would be edited to emphasize
what fierce hunters these birds are, and what cute downy chicks they
have.
Instead, Kristersson edits the footage chronologically, and at a
leisurely and lifelike pace. Most daring of all, he adds no narration
and no music.
The first scenes of the film show the birds in their surroundings. The
important landmarks soon become familiar -- the nest in the tower, the
cemetery in the churchyard below, the field off in the distance, the
nearby brick rooftop. This is the entire world, as far as our kestrels
seem to know.
Once we're settled in, Kristersson begins to show us the day-to-day life
of the birds. For food, one bird goes to the field. It hovers over the
grass, waiting for prey to come into view. When it spots a target, it
tucks its wings and falls on its prey. When it finally catches a mouse
or a lizard, it brings the prize back to be shared with its mate.
Another sequence shows the process of mating and egg-laying. Without
narration, Kristersson tells us that each mating results in a single
egg. When the kestrels are done, there are six eggs.
Finally, Kristersson shows us the process of hatching the eggs and
fledging the chicks. By the end, the young birds have taken their first
awkward steps toward independence.
Although there's no narrator, there is a human presence. After all, the
birds live in a church, in a village. Joggers pass by on the road in
front of the nest. People walking dogs say hello in the street. And the
groomed-gravel cemetery in the churchyard gets constant attention from
the groundskeepers.
Occasionally the church becomes noisy with music and revelry as the
humans mark some birth, funeral, or wedding. But the birds proceed with
their own lives, oblivious to the similarities between our rituals and
their own.
At its worst, KESTREL'S EYE is a little slow. Sometimes the birds do
little else but watch the world go by.

Title
Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
*** (out of 4) "Whatever it takes to make someone a movie star, she's
got it."
That's what my friend says about Julia Roberts, and she's exactly right.
Roberts brings warmth and enthusiasm to ERIN BROCKOVICH, making it a
much better movie than it might have been.
ERIN   BROCKOVICH takes a new approach to the lawsuit movie. You might
say it's   like THE INSIDER without the serious tension, like A CIVIL
ACTION   without the laborious melodrama. What it has instead is the
human touch that   Roberts brings to it.  
Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is unemployed and underskilled. She's a single
mother raising three kids, and she'll take any kind of work she can get.
Unfortunately, nobody will hire her.
Her Toyota gets sideswiped by a Jaguar, and her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert
Finney) nearly wins her a big settlement. But Erin does so badly on the
stand -- wearing too-revealing clothes and suggestive makeup, then
shouting at the defendant -- that she loses the case. Desperate and
angry, she insists on a job from Masry, whom she blames for losing her
case.
Roberts reuses her low-class, unpretentious persona from PRETTY WOMAN.
Erin's gaudy and revealing outfits garner disapproving looks from the
other women in the office, but she takes it all in stride. Being a poor,
single mother of three has taught her how to ignore the bullies and
respect the true friends.
Erin notices something in one of Masry's real estate cases that strikes
her as odd. Medical records have gone back and forth between the buyer
and seller of a piece of property. Instead of doing her job filing, she
follows her curiosity. She gets Masry's vague, off-hand permission to do
some investigative work, and she heads to the small town where the
property is being sold.
After a few days' work making friends in the town, Erin realizes that
something big is happening. Pacific Gas & Electric, a major California
utility has been dumping industrial toxic chemicals into the water, and
now they're buying up every property in town to cover up what they've
done. 
Back at the office, Masry has fired Erin. He can't remember giving her
permission to investigate, and even if he had, he never would have let
her spend three days on it. But Erin shows him the evidence she's
gathered and convinces him to take the case. Erin's got such a winning
way with people that she rallies the whole town to their common cause.
Albert Finney does a great job as Erin's boss and friend Ed Masry. His
character could have been a two-dimensional foil for Erin, but Finney
knows when to play up to Roberts and when to stand back and watch. He
knows this is Roberts' movie and doesn't try to fight it.
Julia Roberts singlehandedly makes this movie work. She has a great
screen presence, and she brings emotion, sympathy, and strength to the
role. One moment she's telling her boss how to run his business, the
next moment she's reacting emotionally to a phone call about her
youngest daughter's latest accomplishment. (I mention the latter because
many directors say that phone call scenes don't work on screen, but
Roberts proves them wrong.)
Some of Roberts' "presence" comes from her cleavage. Some of the
costumes are almost insulting, and even the audience was giggling at her
appearance. But before long, Erin acknowledges that she dresses that
way, sometimes on purpose. Because it was worked into the character (and
even the plot), it wasn't nearly as gratuitous or insulting as it first
appeared.
The production design and art direction (by PhilipMessina and Christa
Munro) were surprisingly good. When you see a movie with Julia Roberts
you expect money, polish, and refinement. But ERIN BROCKOVICH calls for
an ambulance-chasing lawyer, a poor title character, and a small town
too powerless to fight a utility company. Masry's office looks like it
was built in 1964, complete with dark wood paneling. Erin drives a dusty
orange 15-year old car, and the poisoned town is just redneck enough to
be convincing.
There is a subplot involving George (Aaron Eckhart), Erin's biker
neighbor. A minor romance develops between them. It's not much, and it's
not relevant to the main story, but it is sweet. The movie probably
spends a little too much time on their love and conflict, but at the end
screenwriter Susannah Grant ties it nicely to the main story.
If you're looking for the quirky Soderberg touch, you can find it,
although it's not as noticeable as in THE LIMEY or OUT OF SIGHT. There
are appropriate shots from a low angle, or with handheld camera. The
steady pace of information streaming in reads like a good crime drama.
Also, the music has some character, some flavor, without being too
obtrusive. 
But really, ERIN BROCKOVICH is a mainstream Hollywood movie. The plot
and the dialogue often seem formulaic, even though it is based on a true
story. It may have a serious subject, but it is more entertaining than
thought provoking.
So it is to Julia Roberts' credit that she makes this formula,
mainstream movie into something worth going to the theater for.

Title
Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
**** (out of 4) The first 20 minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN had been so
hyped that I wondered if anyone had questioned whether it fit with the rest
of the movie. I knew it would be amazing, but I wondered if it would be
gratuitous, Spielberg's way of showing off his technical skill, a little
treat before the rest of the movie got underway.... 
The sequence is rightly praised for it's grim depiction of the chaos and
casualties of the invasion of Normandy. Spielberg's approach is to portray
the confusion and violence of battle on a personal, not a tactical, level.
There are no establishing shots or god's-eye views of the beach. We never
know how the battle is being played out because the hand held camera has a
personal point of view, following only a handful of the film's main characters. 
In a sense, the first sequence IS gratuitous, and Spielberg most certainly
is showing off. The sequence is full of small details that must have been
extremely difficult to set up. For each soldier the camera watches die, it
seems two others are killed in the corners of the screen. Yet this whole
sequence has little to do with the plot of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. If it were
cut, the story could be summarized in the same way. 
But the film's plot is not what the film is about. It is merely a thread
that ties together the patches that make up the rest of the film. SAVING
PRIVATE RYAN is really a tour of the life of American soldiers in Europe.
There are distinct vignettes in the film, each one showing a small part of
the big picture. In that sense, the taking of Normandy is an important part
of the tour, and therefore, its depiction is not gratuitous. 
The plot is that Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must find and return
Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) to the States. Ryan's three brothers died in
combat and his mother received the news of all three deaths on the same day.
A general back in Washington, feeling sympathy for the mother and possibly
seeing an opportunity for some good P.R., ordered that James Ryan must be
saved. 
But as I said, the film is not about its plot. It is about the war in
Europe, and more deeply, about the value of human life. The film follows
Miller from his landing at Normandy to the fields of northern France. From
the rainy town threatened by a sniper to the wreck of an American plane.
>From an isolated nest of German machine-gunners to the rubble-strewn bridge
in need of defending. 
In each episode, Spielberg finds a way to explore the value of human life. 
At Normandy, one soldier suggests that they hide behind the defenses on the
beach, because advancing costs so many lives. Miller points out that if they
don't advance, even more soldiers will die and it will have been for
nothing. By advancing, their lives buy two things: precious ground against
the Germans and more meaning, a higher value, if you will, for the lives of
those already killed.  
When Miller and his seven men learn of their mission to save Ryan, they are
outraged at the thought that so many lives should be risked for the sake of
just one. Yet Ryan's life is worth so much more, at least to his mother,
because his three brothers have died. An exponential curve is at work,
making the last son's life worth more than the first three combined. 
At the site of the plane crash, we learn that 22 soldiers died because one
general wanted extra protection for himself. He ordered a steel plate to be
welded to the plane under his seat to protect him from flak. But the weight
of the steel made the plane fly "like a freight train," and the pilot was
forced to crash-land, killing and wounding dozens of soldiers in the process. 
While talking to his men one night, Miller recounts the number of lives lost
under his command. He believes there must be a formula, some factor by which
each lost life can be multiplied, whose product is the number of other lives
saved. Losing 96 men must mean that at least 960 other lives were saved.
True or not, it is one way Miller can assuage his guilt. 
In one of the film's most interesting dilemmas, a single German gunner
remains alive after a battle. Most of Miller's men want to kill the German,
slowly and painfully, but, as Upham (Jeremy Davies, in a very interesting
role) points out, that would be against the rules. They cannot take him
prisoner because he would hinder their mission, so Miller must weigh the
moral costs of killing an unarmed man against the possibility that, once
released, he might live to kill more U.S. soldiers, perhaps even Miller's
own men. 
The movie is very well made. That's not surprising considering the skill of
the director. Thankfully, this time Spielberg refrained from including his
sermon and his directorial signature. InAMISTAD, there were signs throughout
the movie that reminded you what a clever director Spielberg was. It was
downright distracting. In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, there are no directorial
flourishes, just good filmmaking. 
During battle scenes, the camera is hand-held. The picture is jittery, but
not blurry. It's as though Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski
used a camera with a very fast shutter speed, or else shot at double speed,
then used every other frame. I can't say what the intent of this was, but it
made the film feel sharper, edgier, less soft. 
The film also pays very close attention to sound, making us feel much closer
to the events on screen. As Miller prepares for the invasion of Normandy,
the landing boat's motors are clear and distinct. It's a detail that makes
the scene seem mundane and real, not heroic and romanticized. For a time the
camera goes underwater and the sound becomes more distant, more dreamlike,
but as soon as it breaks the surface, the nasty whizzing of bullets and
screams of dying men return. At two points in the movie, the sound takes the
point of view of Miller, mentally and aurally drifting away from the
battlefield, before coming back to insistent reality. 
Finally, the casting of Tom Hanks as Captain Miller was an extraordinary
stroke of genius. At first he seems unlikely to lead a pack of soldiers in a
war movie. He's too much the nice guy. His voice is a gentle tenor instead
of a cussing bass. And yet, that seems to be exactly the point that
Spielberg was making in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN: that World War II was fought by
normal, everyday men. There were gruff generals and posturing politicians,
but the men on the front lines were average Joes with wives, jobs, and rose
bushes back home. And that makes the violence of the battle scenes all the
more horrifying, the cost of 96 lives all the more painful. 
One final comment is worth making. I believe this film raises the level of
acceptable graphic violence in mainstream movies. Soldiers are disemboweled,
decapitated, and blown to bits on screen. Perhaps the most difficult scene
is a closeup of a German soldier slowly and gently stabbing a G.I. in the
heart. It is hard to imagine this film getting anything less than an X
rating as little as a decade ago, yet it got an R rating from the MPAA on
the first try. Spielberg handles the subject matter well. He deals with a
gruesome subject matter honestly and appropriately. One scene reminds us not
to treat death lightly, even when it is too widespread to be comprehended.
No scene glorifies the mass slaughter of enemy soldiers. Still, the standard
has been raised, and the next war movie will have to be even more gruesome
to make its point. 
Let us hope the next filmmaker will be as thoughtful, careful, and serious
as Spielberg.

Title
Review for Orgazmo (1997)
*** (out of 4) Trey Parker is a very talented filmmaker. ORGAZMO was
made cheaply, and it shows. But even without a lot of money, Parker put
together a solid comedy with great writing, good directing, and
surprisingly good acting all around. 
Joe Young (Parker) is a Mormon, going door-to-door for converts in L.A.
Joe knocks on the door of Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs), a porn
director who gets so angry at the interruption that he sends his thugs
out to beat up the visitor. But Joe knows some moves and singlehandedly
beats Maxxx's thugs. Maxxx is so impressed he asks Joe to act in his
next movie. 
Joe learns what kind of movie Maxxx was talking about and starts to turn
him down, but the money is too good to pass up - by taking the part, Joe
would have enough money to marry his sweetheart in the temple in Salt
Lake City. When Maxxx suggests that a stuntman can do all the dirty work
so Joe can remain a virgin, Joe's moral objections dry up. Joe becomes
ORGAZMO, the pornographic superhero whose secret weapon is the
"orgazmorator." 
Joe's co-star Ben, aka "Choda Boy" (Dian Bachar), has two PhDs from MIT,
but enjoys working as a porn star. When he's not at work, he's inventing
things in his basement. One of his inventions is the orgazmorator, just
like in the porn films, but this one really works. Joe and Ben's lives
start to parallel Orgazmo and Choda Boy's as the two team up to fight
crime. 
Orgazmo is a very funny film. I haven't laughed so hard at a movie
since... well... THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. Granted, that's not very
long ago, but you get the point. 
Part of the reason is the sheer silliness of the movie. There are tons
of cheap jokes, and most of them work beautifully - credit Parker as
director, writer, and co-editor for that. Most of the jokes are visual
(like Choda Boy's costumes or Young's reaction to the industry's common
practices). But in addition there are some solidly funny ideas. 
For example, if Joe just SAID he was a Mormon, it would be a single,
funny joke: ha-ha, move on to the next one. But Joe really is a Mormon
(or at least the comic equivalent). His constant naivete and sincerity
make the whole CHARACTER funny, all the way through the film. The fact
that he never compromises his own morality gives the movie internal
consistency and makes the whole of the movie seem even funnier. 
And there are some surprisingly good performances, especially
considering that this is a cheap, rookie movie (it is Parker's second as
director). 
Parker makes the perfect comic hero. He conveys shock, wholesomeness,
and chivalry with great exaggeration, but without carrying the
performance into sarcasm and cynicism. 
Bachar is wonderful as Choda Boy, the movie's straight man (no pun
intended). He has some of the funniest lines in the film and has to
endure the most ridiculous costumes. There were times when I wondered
how anyone could keep a straight face, but Bachar managed to pull it
off. 
The other big role, that of Maxxx probably wasn't too challenging, and
Jacobs was thankfully good in the part. There were dozens of other small
parts, and not a single one of them left a bad actor taste. 
ORGAZMO is rated NC-17, but don't let that stigmatize it for you (it
probably should have been an R). The comedy is very mainstream and there
is no full frontal nudity (though there are several ... ahem...
artificial members). It's difficult to make a convincing argument for
how funny a movie is without giving away the jokes. But trust me, this
movie is very funny. If you are at all titillated - and not too easily
offended - go see this movie.

Title
Review for Inventing the Abbotts (1997)
*** (out of 4)INVENTING THE ABBOTTS is a nice period piece that doesn't
reach too far back into the past. The setting is Haley, Illinois, 1957
and great care was taken to get the look and feel of that time and
place. 
The scenery doesn't just set the time and place. It defines a world in
which the movie can take place. In a worse movie, we could see that the
year was 1957, with a vintage car here, a haircut there. INVENTING THE
ABBOTTS instead goes to great lengths to bring us to the world of 1957.
Production Designer Gary Frutkoff deserves credit for making "Illinois,
1957" into a real place and time. 
For example, at the high school, the parking lot is full of cars. Not
just a car here or there, but lots of them. One of the characters works
at a gas station. We don't just see the building and then lots of
closeups; the garage is filled with vintage equipment. There are one or
two long shots of wide-open fields or a silo and a barn, which, without
any specific reference, somehow evoke an America of the past. 
Set against this backdrop is the story of the Holts and the Abbotts, a
story a bit like Romeo and Juliet. The Holt family (the Montagues, if
you will) is middle class. Doug (Joaquin Phoenix) and his older brother
Jacey (Billy Crudup) live with their mom (Kathy Baker). Their neighbors,
the Abbotts (or the Capulets), are at the pinnacle of Haley society and
they are always throwing some sort of big party for one of the Abbott
girls. 
There is some unspoken tension between the families, but all the kids
are at least on speaking terms and their paths often cross at the high
school. Jacey starts courting Eleanor Abbott during his last year of
high school. Mr. Abbott frowns on their relationship, and when he learns
the youths have been having sex, he sends Eleanor away. 
The tension between the families grows until Jacey is persona non grata
at the Abbott parties. 
All of this proves to be very difficult for the youngest siblings, Doug
Holt (our Romeo) and Pamela Abbott (our Juliet). Doug and Pam are not
passionately in love with each other, but they do have a relationship.
When the families start drifting apart because of the behavior of the
older siblings, the fallout lands squarely on the younger siblings, who,
though disappointed, handle  the situation with dispassionate
acceptance. 
The characters in INVENTING THE ABBOTTS are well defined. Doug and Jacey
look, act, and dress like brothers until each grows up and becomes his
own man. (There is a scene of the two brothers fighting about their
individuality. Each is wearing a white shirt and dark pants, and in all
the commotion, we can't tell which one is which.) Mrs. Holt is one of
the wisest mothers to grace a movie screen. Each of the Abbott girls has
a distinct personality. We can easily see each character's role within
his or her family and how each family fits into the social order of the
town. 
The story has as much action as any romantic comedy, but in addition the
plot is advanced by revelations of information that some of the the
characters have always known, but that we the audience (and other
characters) aren't privy to right away. This is a great device for
keeping up a movie's pace and for giving the audience a fresh
perspective on the action and the characters. This technique was used
extremely well in SECRETS & LIES. 
There were only a few things I disliked about INVENTING THE ABBOTTS. One
is the title. Much was made of the title; characters hypothesized that
if the Abbotts didn't exist, Jacey would have invented them. This whole
notion felt forced somehow. Jacey was rebellious and sex-driven, but
this story would have been completely different with another family. I
understand the point but it doesn't seem strong enough to make the
title. 
Another was that the movie started going in several different directions
near the end. I suppose life was getting more confusing for the
characters, but after a certain point more plot twists and conflict just
get in the way of finishing the story. 
I had low expectations for this movie. I anticipated that it was going
to be a gray '50s drama-comedy. Even afterwards, these expectations
color my view of the movie, and I tend to think more about the confused
ending than about the great shots and the subtle comparison to Romeo and
Juliet. 
But objectively, I can see that it is well made, well written, and well
designed. Maybe this movie will prove to be just average on a second
viewing, but it does deserve a second viewing.

Title
Review for Absolute Power (1997)
It's Clint vs. Clinton! Knowing Clint Eastwood's Republican slant,
Absolute Power is an interesting jab at the presidency and at the
current president. Gene Hackman plays President Alan Richmond, a slimy
politician who uses his power for sexual favors and official coverups.
Clint Eastwood is Luther Whitney, the "master thief" with a heart of
gold. One night while robbing a mansion, he is surprised by noises in
the supposedly empty house. He hides in a vault with a two-way mirror
and watches a man and a woman enter the bedroom. They flirt and play for
a while, then the man starts getting rough. When the woman finally gets
the upper hand the man calls for help and two other men enter and shoot
the woman dead. The scene is covered up to look like a failed burglary
attempt (which puts Luther in a tough spot, him being a burglar and
all).
The man was no less than the president of the United States, accompanied
by his chief of staff and two secret service agents. Luther feels the
heat, and considers leaving the country. But when the president uses the
dead woman's husband for PR, Luther decides to stay and fight.
The story is interesting, and it is told without all the polish and hype
of a mainstream Hollywood thriller. Eastwood is good at breaking from
the formula and this movie is helped immensely by it. For example,
Luther is interested in art and sketching. He leaves his keys in the
plant on his front porch. He is as old as Eastwood and jokes about being
in the AARP. In short: he is not the caricature that he could have been
in a worse but slicker movie. (In contrast I recall the previews for
Murder at 1600, where Wesley Snipes lands at the White House and tells
his dispatcher [with a straight face, I might add] "There's been a
murder at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: an address that changes all the
rules.")
The movie also appears to have been made on a shoestring budget. The
credits rolled by in just a few minutes, and there were no lavish stunts
or expensive computer effects. At the time I didn't even notice, but
it's refreshing to think that good movies can still be made with only
actors, a script, and some nice locations. I won't be surprised if this
movie is much better than Murder at 1600, or if it's better because it
focused on the basics.
There is a subplot involving Luther and his daughter which feels
contrived and probably didn't need to be included. I suppose it gives
some depth to Luther's character, but their relationship was predictable
in an otherwise original movie. Luther worries about Kate's health; Kate
worries about dad's career. They are estranged at first, but going
through this conflict together reunites them. Blah blah blah.
The movie ended abruptly and left some loose ends. We know (from a TV
voice-over) what happens to many of the main characters, but we get no
time to digest that information. Rather than spending time on Kate's
life, screen time could have been better spent putting closure to some
of the smaller issues in the film.

Title
Review for Traveller (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) BEWARE! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS ONE (AND A HALF) OF THOSE
WORDS THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO READ.
The Travellers are this country's gypsies. They live in the south and
travel around, conning and scamming people (and sometimes big companies)
for whatever they can get. As my brother said, this is uncharted
territory, entertaining in and of itself because it shows something we
don't see in our pop culture.
He's right, but he's too generous. There are a lot of mistakes that keep
TRAVELLER from being a very good film. They are minor, but they are
pervasive.
The movie introduces us first to the scamming life, then to "the
family." They are not the mafia, but they are a close-knit clan, and
outsiders are not welcome. Pat (Mark Wahlberg), the son of a former
Traveller returns with his father's body to be buried on family ground.
His father was kicked out of the family because he married an outsider.
Now Pat wants to join the family and stick to it like his father
couldn't.
At first, the family patriarch Boss Jack (Luke Askew) doesn't want to
allow Pat into the clan, but Bokky (Bill Paxton) takes him under his
wing. The two leave home base and travel around together, scamming
farmers, homeowners, and bartenders. At one bar, the scam goes just as
planned, but afterwards, Bokky realizes that he has fallen in love with
Jean, the bartender (Juliana Margulies).
Bokky finds out that Jean has lost her job because of him, so he goes to
her house to return the money. He's developing a guilty conscience about
what he does for a living, and he sees a better life with Jean as a real
possibility.
Wahlberg (as Pat) starts to shine as Pat becomes more annoyed at Bokky
for falling in love with an outsider. His surrogate father is making the
same mistake his real father made. Here is Pat, working very hard to win
respect with "the family," frustrated, as he watches Bokky dissolve his
own ties "over a fucking woman."
Meanwhile, Double D (James Gammon), a fellow Traveller, starts hounding
Bokky in an attempt to convince him to help with a very big swindle that
he has planned.
All three see Double D's plan as their way to get what they want: Bokky
can make one last big score (both to start his new life and to soften
Boss Jack over his leaving), Pat can win respect, and Double D can
finally put his plan into action.
A movie like this is fun in the same way that Penn & Teller are fun.
(Penn & Teller are magicians known for giving away SOME of the tricks of
their trade.) It's easy to get caught up in the trick because it goes so
smoothly. Then you see how much work went in to making it look easy, and
you develop a new respect for the man pulling the strings. There are
some of these tricks in TRAVELLER, but not enough to really work your
brain.
I also have some reservations about the subject of the movie. I wouldn't
say that TRAVELLER glamorizes the life of a con artist, but it does
present it as the norm. Bokky does develop a conscience, but there are
spots in the movie where the con is sometimes cruel. When Jean realizes
she's been had, there is a scene of her reacting in anger and disbelief.
Another time, the victims are a young man and his pregnant wife.
These scenes are in the movie so that we can understand Bokky's desire
to get out of the business, but they are hard to watch because of their
cruelty. I suppose that doesn't have to be a criticism, though.
But there are grounds for criticism in TRAVELLER, which is a sloppily
made movie.
First, Paxton and Margulies lack screen chemistry. There's lots of sex,
but no chemistry. This wouldn't be a problem in another movie, but Bokky
is willing to change his life for this woman. Presumably, if the
relationship were "just" sex, he wouldn't go to the trouble of leaving
the clan. Then again, maybe that's why the cruel scenes mentioned
earlier are so important -- maybe it's Bokky's conscience and not his
heart that is pulling him away from the family.
Second, Green and screenwriter Jim McGlynn made the movie too blunt. The
setup has different characters repeating how the family ain't like the
outside world. Then,  After an early run-in with Boss Jack, Pat gets a
crush on a pretty girl. He follows her home and realizes that she is the
daughter of -- you guessed it -- Boss Jack. (To add irrelevance to insult,
this relationship is tossed aside and forgotten.) Worst of all, the
movie has a DEUS EX MACHINA ending. It appears that McGlynn wrote
himself into a corner and ran out of clever ideas.
Finally, the editing of the movie was clumsy. Most people don't notice
the editing, even when it's bad, so if you want to see this movie, skip
this paragraph. There are abrupt shifts of location and mood that reveal
either a novice director or a mediocre editor. This movie appears to
have both. Green, who has been a renowned cinematographer for a long
time, makes his directorial debut (he also acted as cinematographer).
Michael Ruscio, with only five movies under his belt edited TRAVELLER.
An example is a montage of Bokky crying over his wife's and daughter's
graves. Then, rather suddenly, we cut to him taking care of business
with Boss Jack. Another example is when Bokky learns that his
grandmother is ill. He reacts, then we cut to his car, then we quickly
cut to his grandmother's trailer. All three shots play as part of the
same scene. There is nothing to indicate the passage of time or
distance. (And, as my brother says, this is particularly jarring since
the characters seem to move about in such a large world.)
I think many people, including my brother, can see past technical flaws
and enjoy a movie because of an interesting story or setting or
character. I admit that I tend to be picky about the quality of the
filmmaking. If you're like me, you might want to skip this one. If
you're like him, by all means you should go see it.

Title
Review for Anywhere But Here (1999)
*** (out of 4) ANYWHERE BUT HERE has its share of flaws, but it has a
good clear sense of emotion. That probably makes it a chick flick, but
as chick flicks go, this one is very successful.
When I say that it has a clear sense of emotion, I mean that at every
point, the characters' emotions are real, well-expressed, and relevant.
I think it's worth mentioning because in other movies, the emotion is
often dictated by the plot. A character reacts, not they way they really
should react, but the way that the screenwriter needs them to. Not so in
this movie. 
A quick example: After a fight with her mother, Ann (Natalie Portman) is
left on the side of the road and mom drives off. Her first reaction is
to storm off in the opposite direction. When mom doesn't immediately
return, Ann starts to look worried, sad, and self-pitying. Then when her
mom finally does come back, she turns and walks away from the road
altogether, once again stubborn and angry. It shows the movie's solid,
astute sense of how people feel and behave.
ANYWHERE BUT HERE follows the story of a mother and daughter (Susan
Sarandon and Portman). They drive their no-longer new, gold Mercedes
from Wisconsin to California. They've left their old lives behind in
order to set up new ones on the west coast.
Adele (Sarandon) is satisfied and joyful at getting away from small town
life. She's very optimistic about living in California, perhaps a little
naďvely so. She is certain she will get a job teaching in L.A. and that
they will get a nice but affordable place in Beverly Hills, where Ann
will go to school. She also knows that Ann will make a beautiful child
actress, and that they will be the best of friends in their new home in
paradise.
Ann is often sullen and occasionally rebellious. She's not sure why they
had to leave Wisconsin, and she doesn't entirely approve of her mother's
behavior (although she doesn't know quite how to express it yet). She
doesn't share her mother's optimism about the move. That's not to say
she's cynical, but she is more realistic about what they have given up
and what they have yet to gain. To top it all off, she has no interest
in becoming an actress. 
Both Sarandon and Portman give very good, precise performances. Both had
a great sense of character that seemed to jibe with Wang's ideas of how
the movie should play. Their "chemistry" is hard to judge because their
characters weren't supposed to get along -- the inevitable friction
between mother and daughter defines most of their moments together --
but the scenes of them together felt right on target.
For a while, the movie looks like SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS from last year,
in which the family moves in and out of cheap apartments, always staying
just inside the school district. Adele and Ann's apartments are neither
big nor glamorous, nor well-furnished. Sometimes Adele forgets to pay
the bills and the apartment goes completely dark. Technically, they are
living Adele's dream, but only Ann has the perspective to see that it's
a pretty bad life.
A contrived plot device brings them back to Wisconsin, where Ann gets a
fresh perspective on their troubled life in California, and on her
images of home. "The streets are less wide, the trees are less tall and
the house is smaller," intones Ann in voiceover. Ann never thought of
California as home, but now, after returning, she realizes that "home"
isn't Wisconsin, either. "Home" is nowhere. That realization is both
frightening and liberating. It forces her (and to some extent her mom)
to find some roots within herself.
When they return to California, they get a new apartment with nice
furniture. They pick a color and paint their rooms. They are still poor,
but they choose to make their surroundings permanent and stable.
Although mom and daughter still fight, it seems more relaxing, now that
they're not transient. 
The emotional conflict between mother and daughter builds, but never to
too-exaggerated heights. Their differences finally reach a relatively
cool boiling point, and the movie comes to it's predictable but
satisfying conclusion.
What's important to a chick flick -- emotion -- is what works best in
ANYWHERE BUT HERE. Even the man next to me said when it was over,
"that's not really my type of movie but it was better than I expected."

Title
Review for Replacement Killers, The (1998)
** (out of 4) Maybe it was the caterer they used on the production of THE
REPLACEMENT KILLERS. Perhaps a Folgers saboteur infiltrated and switched
coffees, replacing regular with decaf. That might explain why nobody put
much effort into the making of this movie.  
Zeedo (Michael Rooker), a cop, breaks up a big drug deal and kills the
kingpin who will not surrender. The kingpin's father, the local Chinese
godfather, naturally wants revenge.  
John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat), in debt to the godfather, is assigned to
assassinate Zeedo's 10-year old son. Lee gets the kid in his sites but finds
he doesn't have the heart to kill a child. 
Refusing the godfather's assignment will mean death if he stays in town, so
Lee tries to leave the country by getting a passport from forger Meg Coburn
(Mira Sorvino). Before Lee can get his passport, the godfather's henchmen
track him to Coburn's apartment, and wreck the place. Lee and Coburn take it
on the lam.  
The plot doesn't sound AWFUL, but it certainly doesn't sound original. The
other components of this movie are the same way: they're workable, if not
original, but they lack the shine of elbow grease.  
For instance, the bad guys are introduced as drug dealers. Drug dealers in
an action movie might as well be made of catsup-filled cardboard. No action
movie criminal is less interesting or less threatening than a drug dealer.
These guys are dressed for perfectly for the role, wearing expensive suits
and dark shades. They are wealthy, smooth, and deadly. Years of the TV show
COPS showing us wiry, ugly, nervous drug dealers hasn't scratched the
surface of this movie stereotype yet. A token twist on this archetype would
have helped the movie immensely, but it was apparently too much effort. 
Then there was a potentially interesting cat and mouse sequence in a car
wash, but Fuqua and editor Jay Lash Cassidy minced it. Quickly-cut closeups
of blazing guns, and the lack of any sort of establishing shot, ensured that
the audience wouldn't have any idea what was going on. It looked
interesting, but it had no real meaning until we saw who was left standing.
It would have been better to choreograph the whole sequence, but that takes
more work. It's easier to just splice lots of quick shots of guns, which
they did.  
Later, after a don't-think-but-act super shootout, the bad guys get the drop
on our heroes. Do they kill them in the heat of the moment? Of course not.
Instead, they calm down enough to reveal their evil plans. It would be
better to let the heroes learn about the plans through their own ingenuity
and cunning, but it's easier to just write a scene where the bad guys spill
their guts and leave the heroes for dead.  
There are some parts of the movie that are just plain bad. No amount of
effort is likely to have helped the immature dialogue or the flat emotion.
For example, the godfather is very deeply moved by the death of his child,
so deeply that he vows a personal revenge. His grief takes the form of a
four-word segue: "A child is irreplaceable... which brings me to your task..."  
Occasionally the movie makes the mistake of asking for emotional
involvement. An officer is killed, a child is threatened. But these shallow
attempts to elicit feelings are a waste of time in a movie with such callous
and deadly killing. Real emotion is hard to put into an action movie. It's
easier to sprinkle in a dab so you know what the characters' motivations
are. It would have been better to leave it out entirely.  
Eventually the movie picks up a bit. When Meg and Lee are on the run, the
pace is good and they get to do some fun butt-kicking. Mira is eventually
allowed to hold a gun and pull the trigger a few times. A shootout in a
theater was tense and exciting.  
Also, the action cinematography was pretty good. The camera takes some
interesting points of view. In the car wash sequence, Yun-Fat polishes off a
drug dealer from an oil-change creeper. The opening sequence shows Yun-Fat
from an extremely low angle, making him an immensely imposing figure. It's
too bad that these shots weren't edited any better, because in and of
themselves, they looked pretty good.  
But these factors are not enough to make THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS worth seeing.  
I should admit that I didn't mind watching the movie. The experience itself
was average, kind of fun. I even thought I might give this movie a
break-even rating while I was watching it. But I realize I was waiting for
the one scene or sequence that was going to leave me satisfied. A few came
close, but when it was all over, that moment never came.  
If I may be permitted a bit of deconstruction, I found it interesting that
after all Meg and Lee went through, they parted with longing looks and
without so much as a hug. Compare this to what happens after James Bond and
Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) finish off their bad guys in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. I
think it's safe to say that good old semi-prude hypocritical America is okay
with white men making it with oriental women. But audiences are expected to
be uncomfortable with non-Anglo men making it with "our" pretty blond white
women. I was disappointed but I was not surprised.

Title
Review for Last Days, The (1998)
The sheer horrific audacity of the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews of
Europe is almost incomprehensible. People may make documentaries about
it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized,
methodical hatred.
Five concentration camp survivors from the last days of World War II
tell their stories in THE LAST DAYS, the first documentary from Steven
Spielberg's Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation.
The five interviewees are linked by their Hungarian ancestry. As the
introduction explains, even as Germany started to lose the war, the
Nazis stepped up their extermination of the Jews in Europe. In 1944,
Hungary had the last big population of Jews within Germany's reach, and
they became the last target of Hitler's "final solution."
Each of the five tells his or her story. Their stories are intercut
chronologically, starting from normal life in pre-war Hungary. They
recall the Nazi invasion of Hungary, being sent to "work" camps and
their realization that they were actually in death camps.
They recall their horrible, precarious lives in Auschwitz and
Buchenwald; the deaths of their family and friends; their loss of hope.
Each recalls his or her unfathomable, eventual liberation. And finally,
THE LAST DAYS shows their cathartic, pained, modern-day return to their
old homes and the camps.
Needless to say, their stories are horrifying, amazing, and emotionally
draining. By themselves, the stories would be forceful testaments, but
by cutting them in parallel, their impact is multiplied by five.
THE LAST DAYS is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly
pictures of people telling their stories, intercut with period
photographs and newsreel footage. In this kind of movie it's almost
impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being
discussed on-screen, but director James Moll made a better effort than
most at finding specific, or at least relevant, images to go with his
subjects' narration.
The liner notes (one of the many nice features of this DVD) indicate
that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in THE LAST
DAYS. It's not clear which scene it is. It could be one of two that I
hadn't seen before, both powerful. One is rare COLOR footage, shot by an
American, of piles of victims in cattle cars. There is something
jarring, something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color, when
so much of the footage from World War II is in black and white. Another
segment shows walking skeletons; survivors who are so starved that they
hardly look human anymore.  
There has been a glut of Holocaust movies and I was skeptical that a new
documentary would have anything new to say. But by focusing on Hungarian
Jews during the last days of the war, Moll told a specific part of the
story in a new way, in greater detail. And I'm glad he did because his
careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same
subject.
The transfer to DVD is rich and beautiful. X-Mozilla-Status: 0009f words
for a Holocaust documentary, but some of the interviews take place in
Europe in late spring, when skies are blue and trees are green. Also,
the movie was shot on 35mm film (and not video!), so the richness and
detail are impeccable.
The DVD's features are plentiful and well-chosen. There is a theatrical
trailer for the movie, which is a great introduction to the subject
matter. There are about fifty still photos, both from the production
crew and from the private collections of the survivors. Also, the disc
has two complete versions of the movie (widescreen and full screen),
both on the same side.
One of the more interesting DVD features is an outtake segment for each
of the survivors (plus one for the crew). You'd think outtakes would be
inappropriate in a Holocaust documentary, but they're not bloopers.
Instead, they are solid, moving segments that were probably cut from the
film only for length. 
One of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly
in the film. Renee Firestone (one of the five) spoke on camera with Dr.
Hans Münch, a German doctor who ran the medical clinic at Auschwitz.
Firestone was aggressive, questioning the doctor about what his children
thought. The doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable. Another of
the outtakes showed Bill Basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at
Auschwitz. He ends his prayer by saying "... forgive me for surviving."
It's ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film. It's ambitious to
make it on a subject that has saturated cable, television, and movies.
It's ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers. But THE
LAST DAYS handles all these potential obstacles very well.
It's only fitting that the DVD, with its wealth of interesting and
relevant features, would also be ambitious and successful.

Title
Review for Riding the Rails (1997)
*** (out of 4) René Champion, a professor of anthropology at the University
of Denver, was abused as a child. But that wasn't the only reason he ran
away from home -- it also had something to do with the irresistible lure of
the horizon. 
Champion is one of hundreds of thousands of teenagers who ran away during
the Great Depression. They became hobos and transients, riding freight
trains around the country in search of work and adventure. Documentary
filmmakers Michael Uys and Lexy Lovell sought these people out to tell their
stories, and out of 3,000 potential subjects, they found 10 amiable,
talkative people to speak on camera in "Riding the Rails." 
These people's stories offer great insight into the everyday lives of hobos;
they put a personal face on the transient life and make the Great Depression
seem less abstract to younger generations. Each person is bright and
articulate, and each has an engaging story to tell. 
One ran away from home for the sheer adventure of it, even though his family
was well off. Still another said his family told him he had to leave because
they couldn't afford him staying at home. One woman ran away after her
father refused to believe she would follow through on her threat to leave. 
Transience was a way to fight the economic hardship of the times. It was a
way of being pro-active in a near-hopeless situation. If you could get a cot
and a meal at a shelter, you might only be allowed to stay for a night or
two. But you could always move on to the next town. 
For those who were looking for work, transience gave them options. They
could follow the harvests -- picking strawberries in one place, apples in
another, and so on -- until the last harvest of the fall. In this fashion,
they could earn enough money to survive the winter. 
For those who just wanted to get away from home, it was a once-in-a-lifetime
adventure. 
Of the 10 profiled in "Riding the Rails," Guitar Whitey is the only one who
still rides the rails. He's retired, but he spends his summers traveling the
country by freight. He took one of the filmmakers with him on one trip,
which he describes as the last free red-blooded adventure: It's illegal,
dirty, cold and fun, and he says he plans to keep doing it until he can no
longer climb on a boxcar. 
This film's great strength is that the 10 subjects do most of the
storytelling. Uys and Lovell have structured the film by breaking the
interviews into recognizable segments, but they let their subjects tell
their stories in their own way. And it's these stories that make the film
worth seeing. 
Only a few minor points detract from the movie. The film uses archival
footage -- a necessity in this type of documentary -- but the picture and
narration aren't always a close match. I kept looking for the narrator's
face in the crowd, but I eventually realized that the footage was only meant
to be a generalized representation of the narrator's experience and not a
specific one. It's a conventional technique, but in an era when documentary
film has been pushing its formal and conceptual boundaries, even the use of
conventional techniques should probably be examined. More daring, but for
some reason not very effective, is the use of new black and white video
footage to ease the transition between the historical. 
"Riding the Rails" tells a story we've all heard before, but it puts a human
face on that story. It's a well-made documentary with some very interesting
people, and at only 72 minutes long, it should be easy to work into your
schedule.

Title
Review for Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is a caper movie - the kind of
light crime drama where sophisticated, clever thieves try to pull off
the perfect crime. As capers go, it's smart and well-oiled. The crime
story works wonderfully. The movie only fails when the plot wanders, and
unfortunately, at the end.
This remake of the 1968 movie stars Pierce Brosnan as Thomas Crown:
billionaire, hard-core businessman and art-lover. Rene Russo plays
Catherine, an insurance investigator hired to look into the theft of a
Monet painting from a New York art museum. Catherine quickly deduces
that Crown is the thief. Now she just needs some evidence.
Crown knows how to keep clean during the investigation, which draws it
out longer. Each time they meet, they fall deeper in love. The
protracted investigation becomes a coy game of power, sex, trust,
leverage and love.
Catherine collaborates with Michael (Denis Leary), the NYPD detective
assigned to the case. Michael's law-abiding infatuation throws
Catherine's options into clear contrast. She can choose a rich,
handsome, mature crook or a poor, plain, childish cop.
Catherine and Thomas do make love, and their scenes are pretty steamy.
Both leads are good-looking, mature adults. It was nice to see two
well-matched minds going at each other with their bodies. It draws
attention to how adolescent and male-centric movie sex tends to be.
But good looks and chemistry aside, neither Brosnan nor Russo gives an
outstanding performance. Brosnan manages to be different from 007 only
in subtle ways. Russo was better, but she played her part a little too
broadly.
For most of the movie, the remake improves on the original. The capers
are more elaborate and more smoothly portrayed. The temptations of
wealth are more real. Even the song WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND is integrated
better. The whole picture just seems to work better than the first
movie.
I won't give it away, but if you're not sure, skip the next paragraph.
The first movie ended in a certain way. It could have just as easily
ended one other way. The new version of the film finds a third way which
is a little too pat. It doesn't entirely compromise the characters'
integrity or the plot's believability, but it does stretch them both too
far.
But those problems aren't all that big and shouldn't detract from
enjoying the film. The interactions between the main characters are
well-thought-out and the intricate set-ups for the crimes, following the
tradition of all good caper movies, are fun to watch.

Title
Review for Great Expectations (1998)
*** (out of 4) If you didn't understand English, this would be a great movie
to see anyway. The cinematography is outstanding. It is fluid and graceful,
enamored and lightheaded. At times the widescreen shots are composed to
resemble the main character's paintings. And within each shot is a fully
textured world of birds or moss or art. 
Against the swampy Florida setting is the modernized retelling of Charles
Dickens' story about a poor young man with a wealthy benefactor. 
Ten-year old Finn (Jeremy James Kissner) grows up visiting his friend and
tormentor Estella Dinsmoor (Raquel Beaudene) once a week. Actually, it's
Estella's eccentric aunt (Anne Bancroft) who requests, and pays for, his
presence each week. Finn uses the money to keep him in sketch books, paints
and brushes. 
Mrs. Dinsmoor asks young Finn what he thinks of Estella. "I think she's a
snob," he replies. "I also thinks she's pretty." Mrs. Dinsmoor warns him at
the age of 10 to be careful about falling for Estella. "She'll only break
your heart, it's a fact," she says. 
When they reach high school, very close to graduation, Estella (now Gwynneth
Paltrow) complains to her aunt that she doesn't have a date for a big party.
Finn (now Ethan Hawke) still has a crush on her and gallantly volunteers for
the job. Afterwards, in one of those dizzying displays of passionate
cinematography, the shy and awkward Finn ALMOST wins the girl of his dreams.
Before he knows what's happening and before anything CAN happen, she is out
of his house, out of the country, and out of his life. Mrs. Dinsmoor's
prediction came true.  
Six years of Finn's life zip by. Disillusioned, he gives up on girls and on
painting, choosing instead a life of fishing with his uncle Joe (Chris
Cooper, recently in LONE STAR). 
The story picks up again when Mr. Ragno (Josh Mostel), a lawyer, approaches
Finn. Ragno is acting on behalf of a wealthy benefactor who wishes to remain
nameless, and who offers Finn a New York studio and a one-man show of his
work. After a quick stop to carefully thank Mrs. Dinsmoor, he is off to the
big city. 
In New York, Finn runs into Estella. Finn finds he STILL has a crush on her,
and when she agrees to model for him, he is ecstatic. The scene of him
sketching her is another one of those unabashed sequences of passionate
cinematography. As before, Estella abruptly walks out the door before
anything can happen. 
Turns out she already has a boyfriend. Walter (Hank Azaria) is wealthy and
therefore, in Finn's mind, better deserving of Estella's affections. When
she tells Finn that she's getting married, she  practically dares him to
object, but Finn still feels like he hasn't EARNED his fame, or the ability
to make her a better offer. If either of them were more forthright, they
might make each other happy, but their natures and their different-class
upbringings work against them. 
I haven't read the book, but the story seems to follow the original pretty
closely (based on a comparison with David Lean's more conventional
adaptation, and on other reviews). The modernizations actually improved the
story. For example, in the original, Pip (renamed Finn) is sponsored not as
an artist but as a monied gentleman. By giving the character a vocation
rather than a status, screenwriter Mitch Glazer makes him more approachable.
Glazer also made Estella's rejection of Finn less cruel and more
situational. That may have diminished our understanding of Estella's aunt,
but the movie is better off with two characters than with a hero and a
villainess. 
A friend of mine criticized the movie for trying to be too artsy, but I
disagree. Cuarón portrayed the New York art scene with just enough derision
to make it clear that he wasn't going to bow to it. For example, at a party
there is a wandering opera singer, as irksome as the wandering mariachi
bands in schmaltzy Mexican restaurants. In Finn's agent's gallery, the
current exhibit is belly art: human bellies poking through holes in white,
square pillars. I can't remember when I've laughed so hard as when I saw
that scene. 
The movie has a tidier ending than you might expect, and it doesn't seem to
quite fit. Then again, the original ending was unsatisfying in its own way,
so maybe nobody has figured out what the RIGHT ending is. (Dickens even
rewrote his own original ending at the urging of his friends). But the rest
of the story is wonderfully told and well structured. 
If you aren't familiar with the story, then the structure is particularly
interesting, especially toward the end. The film is highly recommended to
you. But even if you know the story, this adaptation is beautifully
photographed and lovingly decorated, and that is reason enough to recommend it.

Review for Mission to Mars (2000)
I know you look at sci-fi movies with a skeptical eye. If the science is
wrong because of lazy screenwriters, you get mad. That's why I recommend
you don't go see MISSION TO MARS.
M2M is set 20 years in the future. Budweiser comes in waxed cardboard
boxes, Isuzu builds a single-seat SUV, internal combustion engines are a
thing of the past, and NASA is sending the first manned mission to Mars.
After a quick introduction to the astronauts and their families, the
movie jumps ahead one year, where the first Martian explorers are doing
some radar mapping. While investigating a possible source of water, the
crew notices the wind start to blow. Soon the wind forms into a giant
worm-like dust vortex, which swallows the crew. Earth can't tell what
happened, but because of one last desperate signal, it knows three of
the four astronauts are dead.
Richard, I know you're going to see this anyway. At least there are some
good qualities to it
There are graceful, dizzying scenes of zero-g life onboard and outside
the rescue ship. Cinematography, direction, and special effects really
came together to produce some beautiful three-dimensional motion.
Backing up the great visuals was some impeccable sound editing. In two
different scenes the camera circles a room, and the sound of a person's
voice or of music circles with it. Home theater DVD geeks will go crazy
for this movie.
In addition, the screenplay (written by Jim Thomas, John Thomas and
Graham Yost) makes an incredibly bold decision that caught me completely
by surprise. Naturally, I can't say what it is, but it earned some extra
points for its gutsiness.
But the movie's science is going to make you mad. One scene crucial to
the plot cannot happen. It involves something from the ship drifting
back behind it. It's a situation that would only happen if the ship were
accelerating, which it isn't. We know it isn't because one of the
astronauts just came in from a space walk, and HE didn't drift back.  
Another part that won't work for you involves DNA. In fact, a LOT of
stupid things are said about DNA. Since the movie's climax hinges on the
specifics, I won't go into detail. However, I CAN repeat a quote for you
that illustrates my point. After glancing at a few dozen protein pairs
on a computer model, one of the astronauts says "That DNA looks human!"
Finally, with your background in ethics, I think you will dislike the
secret behind the dust vortex. The movie tells us why it's there, but
the reason it gives doesn't fit with the rest of what we learn. I won't
say too much now, but when the movie is over and you think about it,
you'll be disappointed. 
But even WITHOUT the flaws in science and ethics, M2M is really not a
very good movie. There were two corny scenes of exposition that were
almost intolerably bad. The first happens at the beginning when Jim
(Gary Sinise), sharing an emotional moment with the guys, brings up his
dead wife. The second happens when Jim and Woody (Tim Robbins) put
together their rescue plan, sounding like some 8-year-old's idea of a
heroic spaceman.
The film's payoff was equally bad. After taking us on a journey across
millions of miles, the movie ends with an idea that is neither original,
nor exciting, nor thought-provoking. In fact, if you've seen a few
trailers, then you've seen just about everything.
But I'm sure you'll go see it for yourself anyway. If and when you do,
drop me a line and let me know what you thought. I say it a
disappointment, but I'm not sorry I saw it.
Hope all is well with you. Give my best to your wife.

Title
Review for Blood and Wine (1997)
BLOOD AND WINE reminded me of last fall's CAUGHT. Both were hyped as
solid, non-mainstream films. Both took place in Florida with main
characters working the sea. Both involve a family with a two-timing
spouse and one adult son. And, unfortunately, both came across as rather
bland movies.
Jack Nicholson plays Alex Gates, a shady wine salesman who is having an
affair with a respected client's nanny. He steals some jewelry from the
client, and even seems to get away with it, but as he's leaving for the
airport to sell the jewels, his wife Suzanne (Judy Davis) confronts him
about the affair. A fight ensues and she gets the upper hand. She knocks
him out cold. Meantime, she unpacks his suitcase (not noticing the
jewelry in the hidden lining), and repacks it with her stuff. She
leaves, taking her son Jason (Stephen Dorff) and, unbeknownst to her,
the jewels with her to a friend's house in Key Largo. Alex and his
partner Victor (Michael Caine) chase after them.
 Nobody in this movie is very smart. For example, Alex steals the
diamonds even when two security guards have seen him enter the house.
When the diamonds are found missing, surely he will be a prime suspect,
but this doesn't occur to him. When Suzanne is being chased by Alex and
Victor in her car, she makes the mistake of panicking before she is any
immediate danger. When Jason confronts Alex at the end, he acts out of
anger and hatred toward his father, when just getting away would have
gotten him everything he wanted.
In Roger Ebert's review, he pointed out that the characters seemed to
have driven the story, and not vice-versa. The result is that the
characters are more believable and they have to pay for their actions
more so than in a standard Hollywood movie, but the drawback is that the
plot lacks a sense of reward and accomplishment. To borrow a phrase from
the Simpsons, it's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
 If the lack of a traditional story is not important to you, then you
might want to see the movie for other reasons. The music was used well.
It is dark and somber -- more sad for the characters than a violent
reflection of them. The overall tone of the movie is handled very well.
When cruel things happen, the movie is dark and closed, and when
characters are talking about escaping to a better way of life, the movie
is sunny and open. I don't think I've mentioned costumes in a
current-setting movie review yet, but Jack Nicholson was a well dressed
wine merchant. Every shirt he wore seemed to be the color of a different
wine.
It is details like these (plus the glowing review from Ebert) that make
me think maybe I missed something. The same thing happened with CAUGHT
last fall -- it got excellent reviews from the critics and it showed
signs of being well made, but it just wasn't satisfying as a movie
experience.

Review for Men in Black (1997)
The movie is light and airy fun. It never drags and it's always
entertaining, so after a mere 96 minutes we're sorry to have to leave
the theater. 
In case you haven't heard, K (Tommy Lee Jones) works for a secret
government agency, Men in Black (MiB, sort of like the interstellar
version of the INS). K recruits young J (Will Smith) to help him track
and control alien life forms living on planet Earth. 
Soon after J joins up, MiB learns of a threat from a race of aliens who
threaten to blow up Earth if a certain galaxy (don't ask) is not
returned. Or something like that. As NEWSWEEK says, the plot doesn't
really matter in this movie. What does matter are outstanding comedy
performances, wonderfully cartoonish sets, and a smart, witty script. 
Tommy Lee Jones is the perfect straight man. His K has been favorably
compared to Jack Webb's humorless lawman Joe Friday. Everything in the
movie is absurd, but K takes it all in stride. And Will Smith plays off
of Jones with an overeager confidence that tests the limits of Jones'
deadpan. 
Production designer Bo Welch has done some excellent work for Tim Burton
in the past. He designed EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, BEETLEJUICE, and BATMAN
RETURNS. That same bold cartoonish look is put to wonderful use in MEN
IN BLACK. The MiB testing room is designed for the 60's futuristic look
and not the functionality. The main foyer of the MiB offices is a giant
empty granite cube, its solitary features an industrial-sized blower and
return vent (the lone guard has dragged in a cheap office chair so he
can sit and work his crossword). Once inside, the offices of MiB
headquarters look like the exterior of Boulder's own mushroom house seen
in Woody Allen's SLEEPER. 
The script keeps the jokes coming at a nice brisk pace. In fact, you may
have to see the movie twice to catch all the jokes in the background and
the jokes you missed because the audience was laughing. Continuing the
tradition, I will NOT reveal any jokes in this review; suffice it to say
that you should pay close attention lest you miss something funny. 
Some of the fun in MiB comes from identifying its little winks at other
science fiction movies. I Found references to DR. STRANGELOVE, WAR OF
THE WORLDS, GHOSTBUSTERS, STAR TREK: GENERATIONS, and THE ADVENTURES OF
BUCKAROO BANZAI, to name a few. That's one more thing to keep your eyes
open for. 
Though you will be rewarded if you watch closely, the movie does not
require much effort. It is a light and refreshing diversion, a perfect
way to spend a few hours of your summer.

Title
Review for He Got Game (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4) When he's on his mark, Spike Lee is one of America's most
evocative directors. The look and sound of a well-made scene can make you
nostalgic for a time and place you've never experienced. 
DO THE RIGHT THING put the audience right in the Bedford-Stuyvesant
neighborhood of Brooklyn on the hottest day of summer in 1989.HE GOT GAME
puts us in Coney Island during a May weekend in 1998. Lee's decision to use
Aaron Copland music for the score to HE GOT GAME is unexpected, and the
results are surprisingly effective. The music takes the Coney Island story
and makes it representative of the whole nation. And why not? Basketball is
as American as George Washington, apple pie and Aaron Copland. The daring
decision proves that Lee's instincts are very good when it comes to evoking
a time and place. 
School's almost out. High School kids are thinking about graduation and
college. One kid in particular, Jesus Shuttlesworth (that's "Jee-zus", not
"Hay-soos", played pretty well by Ray Allen, an NBA athlete), has to decide
which of the many scholarships he will accept. The whole country is waiting
for his decision because he is the best high school basketballer in the
country. 
Shuttlesworth the elder (Denzel Washington) is in prison for the murder of
his wife. He is promised a quick parole if he can convince his son to sign
with the governor's alma mater. He's strapped to a radio transmitter and
released to find and convince his son. Jesus gave up on his father long ago
and wants nothing to do with him, making Shuttlesworth's task all the more
difficult. 
There are myriad relationships in HE GOT GAME, fraught with all sorts of
almost melodramatic conflict. No two people meet without having some sort of
deeper relationship. For this, Spike Lee should be praised. In lesser films,
characters share the screen but exist in different universes - they trade
dialogue but they don't really talk to each other. 
Not so in this film. For example, Shuttlesworth runs into some of Jesus'
friends. We know all of the characters on screen, but they have never met
each other. Everyone involved is motivated by the same objective - to do
what's best for Jesus - but they interact with a certain amount of hostility
and mistrust. Shuttlesworth suspects the youths of golddigging, and they
know of Jesus' hatred for his father. The characters are solid in their
integrity. Nobody is played up as "the bad guy" because each person is true
to what they know about Jesus. We may be frustrated that they can't
cooperate, but the characters are rightly jealous and mistrustful.  
However, the relationship that matters most in this film, that of Jesus and
his dad, feels contrived. The betrayed son and overbearing father are more
icons than characters. Some twist in their predictable relationship would
have made them more real, more human. A small deviation from the
stereotypical father-son conflict could have given the movie more
credibility, and could have even added an element of irony, which would have
helped a lot. Instead, we quickly recognize these archetypes and then,
having identified them, dismiss them. 
Relationships aside, some of the characters suffer from Spike Lee's
cynicism. Bill Nunn plays one such character. Nunn (who was great as the
sullen, stubborn Radio Raheem in DO THE RIGHT THING) is Jesus' golddigging
uncle, whose only apparent interest in the boy is the money he feels he is
owed for bringing up the Shuttlesworth children IN LOCO PARENTIS. The prison
warden (acting on behalf of the governor) is another. The warden and
governor manipulate and toy with Shuttlesworth for the apparent sole reason
that Lee's wants his filmed world to be cruel. 
If one insists on crediting these characters with motives, then they must be
unbelievably selfish or inexplicably evil. But these characters are not
handled as motivated people, they are handled as obstacles in the
Shuttlesworth environment. The presence of these two-dimensional characters
only draws attention to the fact that many of the other characters were much
better developed. It's an unfortunate aspect to a movie with lots of potential. 
One final comment is worth mentioning. Without giving anything away, I can
say that Lee made another daring but effective decision in making the final
scene mystical and metaphoric (with the added pomp of Copland's score). If I
had liked the body of the movie better, the ending would have been as
interesting and as perfect as the ending to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or the
ending to BREAKING THE WAVES. The ending was still interesting and touching,
but because the movie wasn't as grand as it set out to be, the ending felt a
little self-indulgent on Lee's part. 
Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING was excellent. Ever since then, his films
have captured some of that excellence in part, but never the quality of the
whole. HE GOT GAME is great for looking at a sense of time and place and at
the web of relationships that describes the community in the film, reasons
enough for setting this film above many others. But gaps in other
departments keep this Spike Lee Joint from being another masterpiece.

Title
Review for Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) TOMORROW NEVER DIES is another link in the chain of
James Bond movies. It doesn't deviate too far from the formula, so if
you know your Bond, you know what you're getting. 
The villain this time is media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) who
wants his near-monopoly on news and information, to become a monopoly.
He plans to instigate a war between Britain and China, right in front of
his news cameras, using a stealth ship to fool their military forces.
Because he's scripting the war, his news reports can stay well ahead of
the competition. 
James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is called in to examine possible links
between Carver and strange activity in the waters off China. China sends
Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), who becomes Bond's partner and counterpart. 
Bond has encountered strong women before but none who have kicked as
much ass as Yeoh. Yeoh, who has worked in Hong Kong action movies, most
notably with Jackie Chan, is a great counterpart to Brosnan. She has a
scene where she singlehandedly takes out a squadron of bad guys. Bond
shows up in time to "save" her from the last villain, but we know who
really won the fight. Wai Lin's relationship with Bond is professional,
not sexual, which seems at first like a refreshing twist, but is really
a necessity: she couldn't sleep with 007 (in his own movie) and keep her
dignity as an equal. 
Desmond Llewelyn makes his 16th appearance as Q, outlasting every other
Bond actor. He has the usual gadgets for "doublo sev'n," including, of
course, several car-mounted devices that are sure to make for some
excellent chase scenes. Judi Dench returns as the tough new M, making
sure that the men of the intelligence community don't do too much of
their thinking with their balls. 
TOMORROW has all the ingredients that we've come to know and love in
Bond films: the sexy, sexist title sequences; the gadgets; the stunts;
and the big cavernous room with an army of bad guys in identical jump
suits. But this is also what holds it back. Nothing new makes this Bond
anything more than just a link in the chain. I enjoyed the movie, but it
won't go down in the Bond books as a classic. 
If this film had been made ten years ago, it might have been more of an
achievement. But in this age of computer-generated special effects, some
excitement is lost. We know or are wise to suspect that some of the
stunts and gimmicks are more fake than they used to be. The days of a
"real" fistfight on the back of a jet are gone. But as the politics of
Bond have been updated, so too must the look be updated. 
One thing hasn't changed though. "James Bond will return."

Title
Review for Siege, The (1998)
***1/2 (out of 4) It seems that Director Edward Zwick knows how to push
my liberal buttons better than any other working filmmaker.
Zwick's films have often made me angry. LEGENDS OF THE FALL was so
enthralled with Brad Pitt that it treated Aidan Quinn very badly, and
COURAGE UNDER FIRE was laced with patriotic military messages I was
unwilling to swallow. Yet both films were very well made and solidly
thought out, so even as I got angry I couldn't condemn them. On the
contrary, I liked the intellectual and emotional challenge they
presented, enough so that I was really looking forward to Zwick's next
film, THE SIEGE.
Zwick did manage to sneak in a few right-wing jabs. Bill Clinton and
Charles Manson are mentioned in the same sentence, and a clever bit of
editing portrays Clinton's foreign policy as ruthless and dishonest.
Bruce Willis gets to say "card-carrying member of the ACLU," and later
makes a speech that sounds remarkably like Oliver North. But the overall
shape of the movie is not so right-leaning.
The first act of the film has Hubbard (Denzel Washington) leading the
New York FBI in search of a suspected terrorist. A fake bomb has gone
off in a bus, and Hub thinks the terrorists will strike again, this time
with a real bomb.
Hub learns that CIA agent Elise Kraft (Annette Bening) is also tracking
the terrorist, which is odd because the CIA is not supposed to operate
within U.S. borders. Hub has Kraft removed from the evidence hangar, in
one of the movie's unconventional yet exciting confrontations between
the FBI, the CIA, and later, the Army.
Another bomb does go off in NYC, this time a real one, also in a crowded
bus. Hub and his FBI team can't work fast enough for the public's taste.
Hub and his crew work tirelessly, but public fear is just as vigilant.
Among those in power, there is talk of bringing in the Army and
declaring martial law. For now it is only talk.
Hub does make progress. Several suspected terrorist cells are identified
and confronted. But before he can crack the case...
The terrorists strike again, this time with a hugely destructive bomb,
driven in a van through the front door of the FBI headquarters, killing
hundreds of agents and employees (but not Hub and his team).
With no FBI to speak of, the Army is called in and martial law is
declared. General Devereaux (Willis) leads the operation. When he sets
foot on Manhattan he makes a "detention speech" for the cameras. He
explains that the suspect is male, of Arab descent, between the ages of
16 and 40. He asks for the city's cooperation in complying with military
detention and questioning of ANYONE fitting the description.
Now the film becomes a three-way game of cat and mouse, set against a
surreal Manhattan-as-prison backdrop, as the CIA, FBI, and Army all
close in on the suspected terrorist, each claiming jurisdiction.
The insightfully written power struggle between three factions of the
U.S. Government is what is most interesting about this film. Each
faction has its own motive and style. The Army, represented by Willis,
is interested in order and "justice," preferably through violence and
force. The CIA, represented by Bening, is interested in deleting its own
connections to terrorist training camps in other countries, camps whose
graduates are the ones responsible for the bombings in New York. The
FBI, led by Washington, are the film's heroes, interested in solving the
case with as little collateral damage as possible.  
Arab-American groups have protested that the film portrays them badly,
and they are not wrong. However, at different times during the film, I
agreed and disagreed with them to different extents. For example, the
terrorists of the film actually ARE Arab-Americans, and for quite a
while, that's all we know about them. Clearly, that reinforces a certain
prejudice held in the U.S.
On the other hand, the film gives a voice to the Arab-Americans who are
treated with prejudice in this country. When the "detention speech" is
given, it comes from the mouth of Devereaux, whom the movie presents as
something of a monster. When the film shows detention camps for
Arab-American men, the camera sympathizes with them and shows the
audience that this sort of prejudice is un-American.
The subject matter itself is complicated, and I don't think there was a
way to handle it without rousing some sort of anger or backlash.
Nevertheless, I think Zwick handled it fairly and intelligently. He
certainly wasn't one-sided, and he seems more interested in EXPLORING
the prejudice - examining its roots and its effects - rather than merely
exploiting it or condemning it without thought.
It is Zwick's examination of controversial subjects, his unwillingness
to spew the easiest, most politically correct answer, that makes me
respect Zwick's work. THE SIEGE was no exception. It was a stimulating,
challenging film, and I'm looking forward to his next project, whatever
it may be.

Title
Review for Keeping the Faith (2000)
*** (out of 4) So this priest walks into a bar and pulls out a picture
of a priest, a rabbi, and a businesswoman....
Thus begins Edward Norton's career as a comedy director.
Norton directs himself and Ben Stiller as a priest and a rabbi,
respectively. The two have been best friends since childhood. Both now
live and work in New York. Both mix a portion of humanistic fun into
their reverence for tradition, and both have packed their congregations
with young, energetic crowds.
But the movie isn't about their professional lives; it's about their
friendship. While out shooting hoops one day, Brian (Norton) tells Jake
(Stiller) that their old friend Anna called. She was their best friend
in eighth grade, and both boys had a crush on her. Now she is coming to
town and she wants to see them.
Both men still carry a torch for Anna, but neither has much of a chance
with her. Brian has taken a vow of celibacy and he plans to stick to it.
Jake, on the other hand, feels pressure from his congregation to settle
down with a nice Jewish girl (which Anna is not).
When Anna comes to town, she impresses and confounds the two with her
feminine charm. She flirts with both of them, and they flirt back. But
there is also camaraderie among the three; a friendship and familiarity
that transcends mere flirtation. 
The rest of the film works through the holy geometry of this
friendship-and-love triangle.
There is much room for criticism in KEEPING THE FAITH. For one thing,
the character of Anna is a plot device, although Elfman's easy
friendship with the two leads helps flesh out her character. For
another, the movie is also too long, clocking in at about two hours
(most comedies are much shorter) The length becomes a problem toward the
end, when the plot starts rambling; it's as though Norton the director
didn't have the heart to cut Norton the screenwriter's words.
Yet there is much to like as well. KEEPING THE FAITH has some very good
lightweight dialogue. It has three appealing actors who share some good
on-screen energy. Also, it was nice to see a movie that includes matters
of faith and tradition -- not because they're handled in any new or
revealing way, but because they're acknowledged and factored in to
everyday life.

Title
Review for Simoom: A Passion in the Desert (1998)
*** (out of 4) A PASSION IN THE DESERT has good cinematography and an
inventive story. A slowly paced midsection and an off-putting subject matter
keep it from being great (or widely distributed), but for the adventurous
moviegoer, it's worth a look.
Augustin (played very well by Ben Daniels, in a role with little dialogue)
is a soldier in Napoleon's army. Augustin's unit is transporting Venture
(Michel Piccoli), one of Napoleon's artists, to some of the sights in the
Egyptian Desert. After a martial skirmish, Augustin and Venture find
themselves alone and lost in the desert.
Augustin leaves Venture in search of water (both men knowing that he's
leaving Venture to die). Time passes, Augustin walks, and eventually, his
horse dies. He keeps plodding on foot and finally comes to a tent, where he
steals some water. He is chased from the tent and flees into a desert
canyon, where he hides in a cave. As his pursuers approach, he discovers
that he is sharing his cave with a leopard. The cat leaps out of the cave
and kills one of the men, giving Augustin the opportunity to find a new
hiding place.
The surrounding desert condemns Augustin and the leopard to share the same
canyon. The leopard has spared Augustin's life once, but the two still don't
trust each other. They come to terms with each other around the watering
hole, learning to share the water without hostility. Eventually, they learn
to share food, and finally, affection.
Augustin's affection for the leopard takes an unnatural turn after several
nights spent sleeping near each other. A passionate lick is all we see (or
all that transpires, for all we know), but it changes an interesting
hypothetical situation into something more fantastic. It severs some of the
the audience's empathy by being more than most of us would be willing to share.
At this point, it seems that Augustin has given up on being human. After
desperate days wandering through the desert and facing his own death, he
adapts to life with the leopard (whom he names Simoom). He has given up on
finding a way out of the desert and has instead chosen to fulfill his needs
in Simoom's canyon. Being a French soldier has not allowed him to survive;
being this leopard's partner has. When a troop of French soldiers comes
within earshot, he hides himself from them. He truly has shunned humanity.
 Augustin's passion turns into jealousy when a male leopard shows up and
mates with his newfound love. He takes this insult badly. The problem, as he
sees it, is not his unnatural passion and jealousy, but his species. In
another of the film's awkward moments, Augustin strips naked, makes paint
from different-colored rocks, and cakes himself with orange and black mud.
Simoom seems to understand the limits of their relationship much better than
Augustin, and eventually she convinces him to rejoin his own species.
Daniels had a tough job in this role, and he pulled it off very well. The
range required for the part is expansive, and Daniels was convincing at each
level, from competent soldier to near-dead mummy to leopard-man. The
"acting" on the part of Simoom was also incredible (though some credit for
the "performance" should surely go to the director and editor for filling in
the gaps). The leopard had to, and did, communicate distrust, trust, and
affection. 
The cinematography (by Alexei Rodionov) was also very good, although it's
hard to go wrong when you are filming in a desert. The film was shot in
Jordan and in Moab, Utah, both of which seem naturally photogenic. The same
could be said for Daniels' piercing blue eyes and the leopard's sleek form.
Not to detract from Rodionov's accomplishment, but it would have been hard
to shoot this film badly.
With all this going for it, A PASSION IN THE DESERT should be an outstanding
film. But Augustin's unnatural passion keeps us from really empathizing with
him, and thus from getting caught up in the film. His behavior is
explainable, but it is not fathomable. And because this was so integral to
the movie, its length could not have been easily cut. Perhaps the setup
could have been shortened, but then we would not be able to see the change
in the man so drastically. The movie, too long by a couple of minutes, had
nothing left to trim.
Still, the movie is quite original, so if you're feeling daring, go and see it.

Title
Review for Psycho (1998)
*** (out of 4) There are three reasons why Universal might have withheld
screenings of PSYCHO from critics. Either 1) they knew it was a stinker,
2) they wanted to keep secret a new shocking twist, or 3) they were
merely paying homage to Hitchcock.
Thankfully, it wasn't the first reason. Though some hard-core fans of
the original may scoff at anything that tries to compete, Van Sant's
version of Psycho is actually pretty good.
It wasn't reason two, either. There was some speculation, especially in
Roger Ebert's Answer Man column, that perhaps the secrecy was meant to
disguise a new twist on Hitchcock's original. In fact, this version is a
very close remake of the original.
That leaves reason three. It appears that Van Sant and Universal were
actually trying to pay tribute not only to one of the all-time great
directors, but to one of his most memorable films. When the original
PSYCHO was released in 1960, Hitchcock and Universal withheld press
screenings to keep the audiences guessing. Van Sant is merely imitating
the master.
For the uninitiated, PSYCHO follows the story of Marion Crane, a
secretary in a real estate office. The opportunity to walk away with
$400,000 presents itself, and she takes it. She drives for several days,
trying to get far enough away to shake her pursuers. Late one night, in
a rainstorm, she decides to stop for the night at the Bates Motel. The
rest is history.
If you know your history, then I don't need to repeat it for you. If you
don't know your history, then it's better you find out for yourself. I
would recommend either version to you. I won't say this version is
better; it's not. But I acknowledge that some people have no desire to
rent a black and white movie for their 15-inch monaural TV. Given a
big-screen with big sound, this version may be the better way to get up
to speed on your cultural awareness.
This film isn't literally a shot-by-shot remake as some have claimed,
but it is very close. In fact, this kind of near-literal remake has
never been tried before. It was a fairly big gamble, especially
considering the possible backlash from die-hard fans. 
Nevertheless, it seems to have worked. The horrible and tense sequences
are recreated faithfully, resulting in a still-satisfying experience.
Trivia buffs could spend hours at the theaters comparing differences and
similarities (see "Did You Notice" on the sidebar at
http://net.indra.com/~mmapes/psy_ld98.htm for a handful of
examples). Yet some differences were unavoidable. Casting, set design,
costume design, and sound all had to be redone. Mostly, these decisions
were well made.
Vince Vaughn fills the role of Norman Bates. Others in the audience were
disappointed by this casting choice, but I was pleasantly surprised.
Vaughn had the right speech and mannerisms to fill the part. He was
meek, childish, and awkward in all the right proportions. Others faulted
him for having too much confidence for the role, and they do have a
point, but on the whole, Vaughn was great.
The only casting decision that I found to be a bad choice was William H.
Macy as the private investigator Arobgast. Macy's iconic face and tidy
haircut were perfect in PLEASANTVILLE, where he played a 50's sitcom
father figure. But because he is such an obvious choice for an
old-fashioned gumshoe, he stood out like a sore thumb. Everyone else
seemed modern in a world gone retro, but Macy seemed to actually come
from that era.
The set design and costume design were unavoidably modernized, but they
still had the look and feel of 1960. The real estate office looked
remarkably similar to the cheap set Hitchcock used in the original. The
hardware store was a far cry from today's big-box chains, and in fact it
looked a little out of place after seeing a new car dealership. Dresses
are loud and orange. Shirts are noisy and brash. Lamps are
salvation-army chic.  
Yet even if all this seems oddly outdated, it all contributes the
overall style of the film. Because the dialogue is reportedly unchanged,
the film was required to have a certain quaint, retro feel. (After all,
who in this day and age would say to a stranger, "if it don't gel, it
ain't Jell-O, friend".) The decision to use anachronistic elements does
a lot to support this old-fashioned dialogue and give the film a
coherent feel.
Bernard Herrmann's music from the original film was used to great
effect. Of all the elements, I believe the music was the least changed.
The fact that it still strikes terror in your heart speaks well to
Herrmann's talent. In addition, the soundtrack is more full and rich. At
times, you can hear inaudible whispers or buzzing flies. At one point
near the end, adept use of surround-sound technology enhances the
picture on the screen.
This film will invite all sorts of questions: Why do a shot-by-shot
remake? What was different from the original? Did the original need
updating? But the most important, most obvious question should be: Does
it work?
Creepiness and tension permeate this film. Even if you know the ultimate
outcome, you will still find yourself telling Marion not to stop at the
motel, not to change her clothes, and not to go into the shower. Even if
you know who lives with Norman in that big old house, you will shrivel
in anticipation as the house is searched.
Remakes of movies are always problematic: if you deviate too much,
you're open to criticism of changing the original. Yet if you follow too
closely, you give up any chance of improving on it. Van Sant took the
latter approach to its extreme, accepting that a close copy of the
original might still be pretty good

Review for Amistad (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) Steven Spielberg is like Alfred Hitchcock. 
A professor of mine once raised the question of whether Alfred Hitchcock
was a genius or merely a carnival ride operator. 
On the one hand, most of his films are exceptional pieces of work.
Suspense, intellect, and morality weave through his films, giving them
first-time enjoyment and multiple-viewing substance. 
On the other hand, most of his movies are so easily analyzed, and were
created with such calculated intent, that it's almost as if he never
created anything original, other than the PROCESS by which he made
movies. Once the process was in place, it only took a minimal effort to
create a new movie each time. 
Spielberg's AMISTAD has those qualities of Hitchcock's. On the one hand
most of my observations were favorable; Spielberg and his long-time
editor Michael Kahn packed many clever insights into the movie. On the
other hand, many of these insights seem mathematically calculated. They
are intellectual, and smooth, not evocative or mood-setting. 
Because the story is so moving, a more emotional approach from a more
intuitive (and less analytical) director would have worked better. 
The movie opens on a close-up of the harshly lit, animalistic face of an
African man wincing in pain and determination. This man is Cinque
(pronounced "SING-kay," played by Djimon Hounsou) and he is extracting a
spike from a post using only his fingernails and his willpower. He is
able to free himself and others, and together, they take over the slave
ship they are on, ironically named La Amistad (The Friendship, in
Spanish). 
None of the Africans know how to sail so they keep the ship's captain
and a skeleton crew alive. They demand to be sailed back home. Instead
of heading for Africa, the ship's captain sails to Boston where the
Africans are recaptured. 
Several interested parties claim ownership of the Africans. A black
freeman and abolitionist, Joadson (Morgan Freeman), hires a young
lawyer, Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey, showing his limited range), to
file a claim for the captured Africans' freedom. 
The trial goes rather quickly and favorably for the Africans, but just
as it looks like the abolitionist's case will win, President Martin Van
Buren (Nigel "King George" Hawthorne), up for re-election, appoints a
new, less sympathetic judge to the case. The case is so airtight that
the Africans are "freed," in spite of the new judge, but the case is
appealed over and over, all the way to the Supreme Court. Along the way,
Baldwin and Joadson convince John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins, superb
as always) to help them out. 
AMISTAD is at its best when Cinque gets to tell his story. The scenes of
his capture, enslavement, and sale are the most moving parts of the
film. Sadly, they take very little screen time. Instead, a lot of time
is spent in the courtroom or in the prison. These aspects of the story
are interesting in their own right, but it's not where I would have
focused my attention. 
Spielberg placed the rhetorical fights of the courtroom over the
emotional battles on-board. Like many of Hitchcock's stories,
Spielberg's is calculated rather than evocative. Here are some examples
from AMISTAD that reveal an insightful movie, more created than born: 
 Still on the Amistad, at night and through the fog, the Africans first
hear chamber music in the distance, then drift past another ship. It is
a ship full of rich white Americans out on a pleasure cruise. They are
in the same place at the same time, yet their situations are so
obviously different. 
 The scene of the Africans' initial imprisonment ends with Cinque
starting to cry. Kahn cuts from his face to the face of a shiny white
porcelain doll that we see belongs to the prepubescent Queen Isabella II
of Spain. From a man in pain and powerless to help himself, to a spoiled
brat who will never know pain with more power than she knows how to
handle. 
  When it first appears that Baldwin and Joadson have won their case, a
new judge is appointed and it appears likely that he will overturn their
decision. Their world is turned upside-down. Literally. Spielberg shows
us the new judge posing for a picture through a camera lens that inverts
the image. 
 One of the slaves is given a Bible. He can't understands the words,
but he spends lots of time thinking about the pictures. He explains the
story of Jesus to Cinque as best as he can by interpreting the pictures.
They compare their own plight in America to the trials of Jesus. Right
after they see the picture of the three crosses on Calvary hill, a ship
sails by with three masts in the same configuration as the crosses,
linking their martyrdom to his. 
 Former supreme court justice Harry Blackmun, and not a professional
actor, reads the final Supreme Court verdict. (He calls the ship the
"Armistead.") 
Each of these examples works very well, but they seem too perfect to be
natural. In each example Spielberg adds depth by comparing and
contrasting Cinque's situation with some other. But the examples don't
arise from the characters or the story; they are clearly introduced by a
godlike author. The effect is that you notice the author's winks rather
than getting emotionally involved. And since the story of a slave revolt
is such a rich mine for emotion, the direction of the film ends up
working against the story. 
I do think that Spielberg is a good director. He is very good at what he
does. But his technique doesn't work for every story. His cold
calculation doesn't work well with the hot injustice of slavery. AMISTAD
would have been a better film from someone less thoughtful and more
emotional, and Spielberg should stick to operating carnival rides.

Review for Next Stop Wonderland (1998)
***1/2 (out of 4) NEXT STOP WONDERLAND is a great romantic comedy, but you
wouldn't know it from the first scene. 
The movie opens on a woman getting dumped by her activist boyfriend. The
grainy look of the film, the traditional camera angles, and the youthful
political ranting make it look like a cheaply made student film. 
In fact, the film was cheaply made, and by a novice director. But it wasn't
POORLY made. It is one of the best-made films of the year, with interesting
characters (major and minor) and sharp dialogue. The film is uneven in
places, but the overall quality is good enough to overcome these stumbling
blocks. 
The dumpee from the beginning is Erin (Hope Davis), one of the most
interesting main characters in a long time. Erin is a quiet solitary type.
She's a nurse who likes to read. She enjoys being alone, and the only time
she feels LONELY is on a subway or in a crowded room. If only she could hate
men, her life would be so much easier. Instead, she tries to decide whether
to continue being alone or to make the effort of dating. 
This role required a sophisticated actor who could portray understated and
ambivalent emotions, and Davis did a fabulous job. She was helped by
writer/director Anderson, who surrounded Erin with extroverted friends and a
pushy, matchmaking mother. (Mom's view of single life is opposite Erin's -
she believes that women who are alone cannot be content.) 
Erin spends much of the film pondering Mr. Right: is there such a man, will
they ever meet, should she settle for less, can she be as happy without him?
Her search for love is all the more interesting because, with her solitary
personality, Mr. Perfect is not necessarily Mr. Right.  
Nevertheless, the film has chosen a match for her. The movie's sense of fate
is refreshing. In this film, Fate is not cruel or harsh, but quietly
persistent. Erin doesn't believe in fate, but Fate couldn't care less what
she thinks. 
After Erin dismisses the notion of a fated, perfect match, the movie
introduces Alan. Alan (played by Alan Gelfant) has been a plumber but he's
going back to school to study what he loves: marine biology. He is 35, but
his haggard face makes him look older. He has a tough-guy background, but
he's ready to put that behind him and start over in his new intellectual
pursuits. He is not obviously the most perfect man for Erin, but Fate seems
to think so. 
Though Erin's and Alan's stories are intercut (often cleverly), the two
don't actually meet. Each one has suitors but both are holding out for
something better, someone more perfect. 
An ingenious twist near the end of the film introduces Erin to Andre de
Silva (Josй Zъсiga), a new "Mr. Right," just before it seems that she and
Alan will meet.... 
The romantic tension is great and the dialogue is witty and sharp, but the
film does have some weak spots. Most are in Alan's subplots. He owes money
to a local mobster. When he can't pay on time, he is asked to kill a popular
fish at the aquarium where he works. As if that weren't outlandish enough,
the aquarium security guard is a clone of Don Knotts playing Barney Fife.
The scenes are a silly interlude to the main act of the movie, but they are
light enough that they don't cause any lasting harm. 
A refreshingly low-key main character, dialogue that made me laugh out loud,
and the film's belief in the gentlest kind of fate all made NEXT STOP
WONDERLAND a pleasure to watch.

Title
Review for Starship Troopers (1997)
***1/2 (out of 4) The war in Vietnam changed the face of American war
movies for good. War movies now show the horror, futility, and irony of
nations fighting. But before, once upon a time, war was the heroic,
romantic proving grounds where boys became men. By providing an inhuman
enemy, STARSHIP TROOPERS is able to make war fun again.  
STARSHIP TROOPERS is not a science fiction movie; it is a war movie
(specifically, a WWII movie, according to effects-man Phil Tippett).
Like GATTACA, only its setting is futuristic, giving the movie a
science-fiction look and feel; the story itself breaks the sci-fi mold. 
What are the conventions of war movies? A big cast. Lots of characters
with names, not all of whom will survive. Caricatured people from
different walks of life coming together in the military. Clear class
demarcation between strategists, flyboys, and grunts. Big,
well-choreographed battle scenes. Characters growing from "boys" to
"men." The African-American infantryman dying first. War-inspired
racism. This movie has them all. 
Our heroes (Carmen [Denise Richards], Johnny [Casper Van Dien], Carl
[Neil Patrick Harris], and Diz [Dina Meyer]) are just graduating high
school, contemplating their futures in a world on the brink of war with
Klendathu, a planet of giant insects. There are many options - college,
professional athletics - but like in GONE WITH THE WIND, "joining up" is
the only real option to any self-respecting youth. Our side needs you;
all your friends will be joining up; it's the best way to prove yourself
a man; and besides, this is history in the making. Being the right age
at the right time in one of humanity's greatest moments is fate and
destiny and downright fun! 
To really spark the characters' (and the audience's) interest, slickly
made propaganda films (reminiscent of the commercials in Verhoeven's
ROBOCOP) call all red-blooded humans to action in the adventure of a
lifetime. Making it even more irresistible, things at home are untouched
by the war. None of the awful destructive reality of war discolors the
young people's enthusiasm for going off to kill the enemy. They're doing
it as much for fun and camaraderie as for duty (again, reminiscent of
GONE WITH THE WIND). 
The movie is really well made, and it's hard not to get caught up in the
thrill of going to war. But Verhoeven doesn't let us forget that the
emotional hype has a dark side to it. For example, a newsreel tells us
that a man is caught, tried for murder, convicted, and executed, all
within 12 hours. Another newsreel refers to a group of "Mormon
Extremists;" actually, they were hoping for a peaceful solution to the
war. Another newsreel encourages war racism among kids too young to
fight: cockroach stomping is a great way for little Johnny to feel like
he's really killing gooks, too. These subjects are awful, but they're
presented with all the enthusiasm of real propaganda films, and the
audience is hard-pressed not to give in to the emotion of the moment.
(That's why you should see this movie during a crowded show, not when
you're the only one in the theater.) 
The world of STARSHIP TROOPERS is an interesting place. Details about
military service, citizenship, and Earth history add to the satirically
dark tone of the movie, though not very subtly. For example, a civilian
(with no military service) is not a citizen, and can't vote. Democracy
failed and "the Veterans" took over politics. These details seem
unnecessary at first, but they help explain many of the characters'
motives and they further distance the audience from the war-glorifying
world on-screen. 
Clearly, this movie is intended as a special-effects blowout, and the
effects are indeed great. A bug stampede around the camera has all the
tense energy of a "real" stampede. Battle scenes at an abandoned
fortress are choreographed and edited masterfully (and they look like
BEAU GESTE and INTOLERANCE). But if you have a taste for film history or
for war movies, there is more to STARSHIP TROOPERS than
computer-generated insects. The special effects action is a great start,
but deeper, you can find lots of interesting commentary on war movies
and on war itself. 
A friend of mine once proposed that the nations of the world should set
aside some remote island to be used for war. Any young man who felt the
need to go off to kill and die in glorious battle could choose a side,
hop over to War Island and engage in battle until he grew up or until he
died. The rest of us could go about our lives unaffected. 
Really, that's what STARSHIP TROOPERS is all about. It gives itself
enough distance from reality so that our lives aren't really affected by
the horrors of war, and then it taps into that young-man eagerness for
life-or-death adventure. 
Intellectually, I can't really condone that message, but I have to admit
that this will be a guilty pleasure of mine for years to come.

Title
Review for Home Alone (1990)
*** (out of 4) At first glance, it appears that the Home Alone movies
are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds.
That's true of HOME ALONE 2 and I'd bet money that it's true of HOME
ALONE 3 (opening soon). But HOME ALONE actually has a lot going for it,
and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way. 
The McAlisters, all 15 of them, are going to France for the holidays.
Four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before
heading to the airport EN MASSE. The littlest kid, Kevin, is the victim
of the older kids' cruelty. Kevin's patience runs out when he learns
that HIS plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten, and he's going to
have to starve. He attacks his big bully brother Buzz, who had been
teasing him. The fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner, spilling
milk and soft drinks all over the table, a few cousins, and an uncle. 
The knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame Kevin. Nobody came to
his rescue when he was being teased, but they all point their fingers
when he fights back. The ultimate punishment comes from mom (Catherine
O'Hara) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the
night. On his way up the stairs, he tells her that "families suck" and
that he hopes never to see any of his family again. 
That night the power goes out, knocking out the alarm clocks, so the
McAlisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport. In a
surprisingly plausible setup, Kevin is mistakenly accounted for, and the
family heads off without him. 
It's interesting that, in a subtle way, his parents never noticed him
missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from
their children. First they delegate the headcount to an older sibling,
and second, they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class.
They're two-thirds of the way across the Atlantic before they realize
they are missing a child. 
Meanwhile, Kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true. He's
finally rid of his family! Life is a dream come true. He can jump on the
beds, watch R-rated movies, eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips, and
dig through his big brother's secret box. 
Slowly, the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane. He grooms
himself, he does the laundry, he goes shopping ("I bought some milk,
eggs, and fabric softener"). He also starts to miss his family, not just
for their company, but for the security they bring. The furnace in the
basement is a scary monster, the old man next door is a snow-shovel
murderer, and two crooks are trying to break into his house. 
Macaulay Culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor. Still, we can see
that Kevin's character grows, thanks to some good direction and editing.
For example, acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the
scene where Kevin searches out a seasonal Santa at night, just as
"Santa" is getting in his car. Kevin asks the man to pass on his request
- he wants his family back - to the real Santa. 
He learned how to deal with the furnace. You turn on the lights and it's
not so scary anymore. He goes to a church one evening and there he sees
the snow-shovel murderer, who actually turns out to be a nice man. They
talk about their fears and Kevin learns that age alone does not make you
less afraid. Finally, in the last 20 minutes, Kevin confronts his last
fear - the bandits, head on (literally). This last act is full of
violent comedic slapstick, and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup,
it is dessert. It's a lot of fun, and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of
the movie. 
On the whole, Home Alone is a great holiday movie. John Williams'
original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the
disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls, and the Christmas setting
can put you in the mood for those family gatherings. But it does have
its flaws. 
The smallest problem is that Culkin doesn't act very well. As I said
before, he IS cute, but repeated viewings reveal more about how Columbus
covered himself than about Culkin's insight into his character. The
biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda, the villains threaten
Kevin's life about five times. Instead of "I'm gonna GET that kid" they
say "I'm gonna KILL that kid." Some might argue that the tone is the
same, but I strongly disagree. Mixing comedy with specific and viable
threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas. 
I'll probably never see HOME ALONE 3, and I wish I had skipped HOME
ALONE 2, but I do enjoy HOME ALONE almost every year. Don't let your
impressions of the others detract from the original, which has much more
to offer than cartoon slapstick.

Title
Review for Shall We Dansu? (1996)
*** (out of 4) Shall We Dance? Opens (at least to American audiences)
with an explanation that in Japan, dancing is as socially acceptable as,
say, picking your nose. 
The movie then introduces Mr. Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho), a good-looking
Japanese businessman in his early forties. He sold his soul to the
company to earn enough to buy a house for his wife and daughter. With
that accomplished, he realizes he is still unfulfilled. 
Every day, at a certain stop on his train ride home, he sees the same
girl gazing forlornly out the window of a dance studio. He becomes
infatuated and, one day, gets the nerve to go to the studio for a closer
look. Flustered, and unable to pay for private lessons with the girl in
the window, he enrolls in a beginning dance class with two other
students. Sugiyama is a below-average student, but his infatuation keeps
him coming back every Wednesday. 
After a few lessons, he gets up the nerve to ask Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari)
out for dinner. She coldly tells him that she doesn't date students -
then adds that if he joined the class because of her, he should quit.
Rather than admit his ulterior motive, he decides to stay in the class. 
Without any hope of winning Mai's affection, Sugiyama throws himself
into his studies. Not only does his dancing improve, he begins to enjoy
it more. For now, he has found another source of fulfillment. Soon he
finds himself practicing dance steps on the train platform while he
waits to go home. 
At the apex of the story's arch, Mai looks out her window and sees
Sugiyama absentmindedly practicing his steps. This time he is the object
of her glance, and she is the one who is moved. She sees that Sugiyama
has found a simple joy in dance, which moves her to re-evaluate her own
motives. 
The plot then continues to its rather conventional conclusion. 
Two aspects of this movie make it a rewarding choice. First, it is
good-natured and lighthearted. Sugiyama and Mai each start with a
certain dissatisfaction: Mai is always forlorn, Sugiyama is unfulfilled.
Along the way each finds satisfaction, not just through the ritual of
dance, but through simple human contact and interaction. The movie has
some light funny moments (some say at the expense of character depth),
that make a nice balance to the movie's simple but earnest "message." 
Second, the movie offers Americans a rare look at Japanese culture. Many
of the great Japanese movies available in the U.S. are historical epics
that don't show us the personal side of Japan today. SHALL WE DANCE
offers a look at the everyday modern Japanese world. For example,
Sugiyama doesn't even have a cubicle at work; he sits at a long table
with another person - right behind another long table seating four
people. (His computer uses Microsoft Windows.) A modest house in Japan
is hard to come by: it took Sugiyama until he was 40 to be able to
afford one. Many of these "mundane" details captured in the background
of SHALL WE DANCE? can be fascinating to the western viewer. 
So though SHALL WE DANCE is lightweight, it doesn't pretend to be
otherwise. It succeeds well in what it sets out to do. Let's hope it
does well enough in this country to encourage more cultural exports like
it.

Review for Brassed Off (1996)
*** (out of 4) BRASSED OFF is set in the British mining town of Grimley.
The town's colliery (coal plant) is its lifeblood and its backbone. It's
even the reason for the existence of the local band - the Grimley
Colliery Brass Band. Needless to say, when the colliery is threatened,
the whole town feels threatened. 
The movie opens after it has been announced that Grimley is on the list
of mines being considered for shutdown. Two of the band members head off
for their last practice with the band. The instability of the situation
at the colliery won't allow them the luxury of paying their band dues,
and the feeling is common among the band members. 
The band isn't dead yet, but the only things that keep them going are
the determination of Danny the bandleader (a moving, if melodramatic,
Pete Postlethwaite), and the surprise arrival of a pretty young woman
(Gloria, played by Tara Fitzgerald) who wants to join the band. 
The movie uses the band as a way to introduce the audience to the town
of Grimley and to the plight of miners all over Britain who are losing
their jobs. The movie is unapologetically pro-labor and anti-Tory, but
the tone is righteously angry, not just preachy. Once the movie hooks
you, it shows you all the division, pain, anger, and loss that a plant
closing in a one-industry town can cause. 
But the townspeople are not just victims who get wiped out. The movie
also shows how people cope and survive during economic peril, the brass
band serving as a positive outlet for their frustrations. 
The movie does a good job of keeping track of many characters, each
adding to the collective sense of community. Postlethwaite obviously
stands out as a star, and a subplot involving Gloria and Andy (Ewan
McGregor), gets a fair amount of screen time, but the rest of the movie
is nicely episodic, never lingering on any one person or story for too
long. 
The movie is very message-heavy without FEELING too heavy-handed, though
I can't imagine British conservatives appreciating the movie at all.
Perhaps it's hard as an American to feel manipulated one way or the
other about an issue so far removed from daily life. In this country the
movie plays as a bittersweetly charming movie. It's a nice change of
pace from the blaring summer action fare. 
But because of the biting condemnation of Thatcherism, I wonder if
perhaps it was intended as something else.

Title
Review for Anaconda (1997)
** (out of 4) I was looking forward to Anaconda. The previews looked
good. The subject matter was potentially scary. It had Ice Cube, who is
an interesting personality, if not a great actor. It even got a
favorable review from Roger Ebert.
After an introductory scene showing the strength, stealth, and terror of
(movie) anacondas, we meet the main characters: a film crew in search of
a reclusive tribe of South American aborigines. The crew is just
underway on their barge when they encounter Paul (John Voight), whose
boat has gotten stuck. They take him on board.
It turns out that Paul is a poacher specializing in snakes. He claims to
have met the reclusive tribe and offers to guide the film crew to their
location. Some of the crew don't trust the creepy man.
Eventually, the crew encounters a huge anaconda with an attitude who
starts picking them off, one by one.
As you can tell, the plot is not very original. Replace the snake with a
vampire or a swamp thing or a ghost and you have a movie that you have
probably seen many times before. So what's different about ANACONDA?
What does it have to offer? Not much, but here goes.
First, there are some good tilted camera shots that give an uneasy
feeling about what's going on on-screen. Second, I like Ice Cube. I
won't say he's a great actor, but he's fun to watch. Third, there is a
scene where I started to write that the character fell for the obvious
double-cross -- another stupid cliche -- when it turned out to be a
triple-cross. Nice touch. Fourth, there is a wonderfully disgusting
scene of one of the actors regurgitated from the snake.
Most everything else was boring or bad.
When the characters were introduced, each was an exaggerated caricature.
There's the producer (Eric Stoltz) and the director (Jennifer Lopez) who
just happen to identify each other's job title in their conversation.
Most of us could have figured this out without "I wanted only the BEST
DIRECTOR (hint, hint, wink) I could find." There's the production
manager (Kari Wuhrer) and the sound man (Owen Wilson) who just happen to
identify each other's job title in their conversation (as if the
clipboard and the microphone didn't give them away). Then there's the
"talent" (Johathan Hyde) who is an uptight prick. We could have learned
about this character flaw when he started driving golf balls, sipping
wine, and turning his nose up at rap music on the jungle river. But lest
we miss that point, the screenwriters (Hans Bauer, Jim Cash and Jack
Epps Jr.) have him ask the first woman he sees to carry his bags. Duh.
We got it already.
The movie makes a lot of other mistakes, and when it does, it errs on
the side of obtuseness. For example, two characters are alone in the
jungle in the dark. They comment on all the beautiful natural jungle
sounds. But on the soundtrack, there is music, too. When the jungle
noise stops and the characters remark on the shock of the utter silence,
the violins are still playing their tense chords. Here's a clue. Unless
your Luis Bunuel or Ed Wood, when someone on screen says "listen to the
silence" (or "my, what a red wall"), there should be silence (or the
wall should be red).
And of course, to round out the adolescent worldview of the movie, there
is cheesy dialog. Here are some examples in no particular order. "You
and whose army?" "Yo mama's." "This river can kill you in a thousand
ways." "I was up all night picking leeches off my scrotum."
I had high hopes for Anaconda. I suppose if I were a 13-year old boy, I
would have enjoyed this movie, but there's nothing in it for adults.
It's as if Llosa assumed none of us would be interested in seeing his
movie. That may have been a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Title
Review for Gattaca (1997)
*** (out of 4) In a world where children are genetically screened and
filtered before birth, Vincent is born with no artificial genetic help
from his parents. Which is too bad for him because he is born into a
society where a job interview consists solely of evaluating your DNA. 
Vincent's parents decide to have another child - a boy, for Vincent.
This time they get the help of a geneticist. So Vincent grows up weaker,
shorter and less graceful than his younger brother Anton. If that
weren't enough, mom and dad treat the boys differently, as if Vincent
might break from the same fall that Anton brushes off. Understandably,
Vincent grows up wanting to get as far away from home - and from people
- as possible, all the way to the moons of Jupiter. 
Vincent (Ethan Hawke) makes an arrangement with Jerome (Jude Law), a
genetically superior person who had the bad luck to become paralyzed
from the waist down in an accident. Vincent uses Jerome's blood, urine,
skin, and name to get the job that will send him away from Earth. Jerome
gets room and board and a part of Vincent's income. 
When Vincent's mission director is murdered, cops and FBI "hoovers"
(referring to the cell-gathering vacuums and to J. Edgar Hoover) begin a
close genetic scrutiny of all employees at Gattaca. A wayward eyelash of
Vincent's (not Jerome's) is found and the cops believe they are close to
finding the murderer. 
It sounds a lot like a sci-fi thriller, but really Gattaca is more a
human drama. The backdrop happens to be an Orwellian future, but the
story itself is a simple tale of a man with a dream fighting against
stereotypes. 
On the one hand, It was wonderful. It was a somber, dark, quiet, human
movie. The story was a noble struggle against an unfair oppressor, but
it was handled with quiet determination, not violent intensity. The
metaphoric details were relevant both to the story and to the underlying
myth. For example, our hero's last name is Freeman, his dream is to fly
to the stars, and those who hold him back judge his ignoble birth, not
his spirit. 
The pacing was calm and unhurried. The lighting and production design
was not literal but mood-setting: cars had fluorescent bulb-colored
headlights, Vincent's home was richly tinted blue, work was cold, stark
and clean. Overall, it felt like a return to the womb. It really drew me
in and made me want to stay. Gattaca started with a simple, beautiful
idea, took a calm and dignified approach, and was capably and coherently
given life. It could have been a superb movie. 
On the other hand, several details were, not BAD, but missed their mark. 
When I attended film school, we called making use of narration an "NYU
Save," the joke being that if you failed to make a coherent movie,
adding a narration would save it. (It also allowed us to make fun of
another film school.) There is a lot of narration in GATTACA. It didn't
DETRACT, but it made me wonder why the filmmakers thought so much of it
was necessary. Perhaps if I weren't privy to the film school joke, I
wouldn't have even noticed the narration. But it is a valid criticism in
a medium that is supposed to show rather than tell. 
Also, the movie's setting says that genetic makeup might one day
predetermine our lives. This is the adversity the hero must face. But it
is a straw man adversity. The movie makes the point that a man is more
than just his genes, but there's little satisfaction in proving the
point because nobody is seriously arguing otherwise. 
Finally, and most importantly, many of the movie's specifics were very
obvious or very simple. For example, If you were in-valid (not
genetically enhanced) the only job you could get was night janitor.
Literally. The real killer is identified because she spat in her
victim's eye. Literally. These pieces ALMOST felt as if they were
included to make the story mythic, timeless, or metaphoric. But the rest
of the movie was too specific to make a good myth, and so these
literalized metaphors felt almost like a joke. 
The story itself, "overcoming discrimination to achieve your goals,"
suffers the same problems. It sounds timeless and mythic, taken out of
context. But in a specific movie with a specific cast in a physical set,
open-ended metaphor slips down into uninspired reality. That's why I
think Gattaca would make a better book than a movie. All the elements
that, in the film seemed uninspired, would, with a reader's imagination,
be accepted more poetically. 
I'm rooting for GATTACA to do well because I think it was an inspired
attempt at timeless filmmaking (by a novice director, no less), but for
me, it didn't quite make it.

Title
Review for Fathers' Day (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) FATHER'S DAY has nothing new to add to the world of
film comedy. Robin Williams and Billy Crystal are funny, but not
memorably so. In short, this is a perfect example of a flat,
take-it-or-leave-it, 2-1/2 star movie.
Williams plays Dale Putley (oops, just gave away one of the jokes), an
unpublished writer of poems and plays on the verge of suicide. It is
impossible to imagine any character played by the animated Williams
committing suicide, but we need to know that Dale is a quirky loser.
This is a very good character type for Williams, if a little restrictive
for his style, and it allows him some funny dialog.
Crystal plays Jack Lawrence, an uptight lawyer on his third wife. This
is a very good role for Crystal. He usually plays a whiny east coast
Jew, (which I always think I will find annoying, but usually end up
liking), and this role suits him perfectly.
Seventeen years ago, both Dale and Jack had a fling with the same woman,
Collette (Nastassja Kinsky). Now, she tells them each (separately) that
he is the father of her son Scott (Charlie Hofheimer). Not only that,
but Scott has run away and she needs help tracking him down. Each,
separately, agrees to go in search of his long lost son.
Dale and Jack eventually meet and team up to find Scott.
For the most part, FATHER'S DAY is an extended comedy sketch. If you
know Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, then you already know what this
movie is going to be like. There are very few surprises, which in this
case, is not necessarily bad. Perhaps the only scene that really stands
out in the movie's favor is a brief cameo of a well-known action movie
star as a Pierced Wonder (nose rings, eyebrow rings, etc.).
There are also some scenes which make this movie A Movie, and not pure
comedy. Frankly, the movie would have been better off without them. The
first scene is one of the few in which Williams is given some room to
maneuver. Unfortunately, it comes off as an old trick reaching for
insincere laughs. It is a montage of Williams practicing the phrase "I'm
your dad" in the mirror in several different voices and costumes. This
is the stuff Williams is good at, but it comes right after his character
tried to commit suicide. Is Williams playing the quirky loser Dale or is
Williams playing himself? This scene says that the filmmakers don't
really care.
The other scene(s) that should have been left out involved two
caricatured drug dealters hunting down Scott. The conflict of a runaway
teen and the question of paternity was all the conflict this movie
needed. Introducing the conflict of the drug dealers detracted from the
everyday human quality that the other conflicts brought to the movie.
I did laugh. Williams and Crystal can make almost always make me laugh.
But there is nothing in FATHER'S DAY that you can't find better
somewhere else.

Title
Review for Lola rennt (1998)
***1/2 (out of 4) RUN LOLA RUN is the filmic equivalent of techno dance
music. There is never a gap between tracks and never a slow moment for
rest. It's all rhythm, style, and energy. There's not much you'd call a
melody, but then that's not what this style calls for.
Lola (Franka Potente) gets a phone call from her boyfriend Manni (Moritz
Bleibtreu). The crime they were supposed to be in on together went down
as planned, but Lola wasn't there to give him a getaway ride. Manni had
to take the train into town with the bag of loot. When the cops boarded
the train, he got off out of habit, only he forgot the bag. Now some bum
has the money and Manni has to tell the boss that he lost the money. He
knows for sure he's going to die. 
Lola tells Manni to hold on. She'll be there ASAP to set things right.
She spends the next 20 minutes of film time running through the streets,
stopping only at her father's bank to ask for money. She arrives at
Manni's location just one second too late.
Manni walks into a grocery store to rob it so he can pay the big boss.
The robbery goes bad and the two end up dead. Lola screams "STOP!" and
the movie starts over again.
Lola runs through two more iterations of the same scenario with varying
results. The differences are both subtle and grand. Are the scenarios
alternate universes? Are they imagined? Are they three separate films?
That question is never answered, nor is it important to the enjoyment of
the movie, because it's all about form and style.
It's all form because the film's shape is a carefully structured
trident. It CAN come across as Tykwer's cheap way to avoid having to
write a real plot. But that's like saying there's no melody in techno
dance music. It's not that the plot is MISSING, it's that it was
deliberately de-emphasized.
It's all style because specific shots use stylistic techniques like
video footage, split-screen POVs, and even animation. Even WITHIN the
frame the importance of style is evident in the gothic clocks ticking
off the seconds, and in Lola's flowing, magenta hair and offsetting
green pants. It can come across as haphazard and gratuitous, except that
it permeates every corner of the screen, every second of the film. I'm
confident repeat viewings would reveal a method to Tykwer's stylistic
madness.
Does it sound frustrating? Do you get annoyed at movies that are all
style and no plot? Then don't see it.
Does it sound intriguing? Do you get sucked in by movies that ignore the
rules and make new ones? Then don't miss it.

Title
Review for Spawn (1997)
*** (out of 4) The day SPAWN opened, I saw two very different reviews.
Roger Ebert gave it 3˝ stars because it was a good-looking exposition of
the state of the art in special effects; a melding of costumes, acting,
models, and computer effects in a hellish landscape worthy of
Hieronymous Bosch. Steven Rosen of the Denver Post called it an
incoherent waste of time that suffers from an overdose of special
effects.  
I suppose they were both right, but Roger Ebert had much more fun. 
If I had to guess, I would say that Ebert also liked WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO & JULIET (1996), and that Rosen hated it. Like ROMEO
& JULIET, SPAWN is a movie where style and pacing are given center
stage. The style is comic book and the pacing is fast, fast, fast. 
SPAWN is based on comic books by Todd McFarlane. The story opens with
hired killer Al Simmons being betrayed by his superiors. He ends up
badly burned before he dies and goes to Hell. Hell sends him back to
Earth with a new suit of "necroplasmic" armor and a mission. His mission
is to ensure that a certain chemical weapon will wipe out Earth's human
population. (The sudden influx of billions of souls will allow Hell's
army to wage war on Heaven's fortress, you see.) But Simmons has his own
noble motives for wanting to return to Earth: he wants to see his wife
again. That, and to murder the bastards who did this to him. 
Because much of the motivation in Spawn comes from Hell's plan to attack
Heaven, the gates for religious interpretation are wide open. When a
character exclaims "Jesus!" or says that the place is going to "hell in
a handbasket," there is a certain resonance that is usually absent from
such words. Whether or not it is intentional, the extra emphasis is not
lost. 
Perhaps because of the extra emphasis on these words, I wondered why the
demons did not rear back from their utterance. Vampires fear crosses and
holy water. Why do these demons from Hell not fear the muttered
"Christ!" The message seems to be that while Hell is going strong,
Heaven is weak, tottering on the brink of oblivion. If this movie has a
big box office, it'll be a telling sign of the adolescent worldview in
1997. 
It is interesting how closely Spawn parallels the traditional "hero's
journey." The hero hears the call to adventure, refuses at first, then
finally sees that the journey is inevitable. Along the way he is helped
by a spiritual guide who will show him the way. Luke Skywalker had his
Obi-wan. Disney's Hercules had his Philoctetes, even King Arthur had his
Merlin. 
What sets Spawn apart from other heroes is that his spiritual advisor,
Clown (John Leguizamo), is Evil's representative, not Good's. Clown is a
teacher, but Spawn doesn't get his lessons for free. He must distinguish
between the lesson and the propaganda. It is a simple twist on a
storytelling tradition that works very well for this movie. (One could
argue that this is a parallel for the influx of information we get in
this day and age. We have to learn to glean good information from those
messengers who have ulterior motives, be they government, media
monopolies, or Internet wackos.) 
When he's on the screen, Clown steals the show. Leguizamo, who is almost
unrecognizable as the stunted pear-shaped demon, looks like he had a
great time with the part. He is rude and crass, which is only
appropriate for a guardian demon. He teaches and guides the hero, but
unlike a guardian ANGEL, he gets to mock the hero's shortcomings. Clown
has a lot of good lines, and many of them draw attention to the fact
that this hero's teacher is hell-sent, not heaven-sent. 
But what really makes SPAWN stand out is its look. SPAWN looks like a
heavy metal fantasy. It is a black and orange Halloween explosion. It
looks like the latest series of Batman movies, only set in the most
horrible Hell Christianity can come up with. It looks like the Hell of
BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY ("our album covers lied to us, dude") without
the levity. 
Rosen said the movie was incoherent, but the style was very coherent.
There isn't one special effect that stands out above the rest (i.e., is
out of place). The look and tone of the movie is consistent from scene
to scene, presenting the audience with a single, integrated visual
"message." Even the opening and closing credits are designed with the
same edgy feel and look. (Maybe credit design should be the next
category for the Academy AwardsŠŽ.) 
For the record, the production designer (the person in charge of the
overall look of a film) was Philip Harrison, a veteran from THE RELIC,
TIMECOP, and other films going back as far as OUTLAND (1981). The rookie
director is a former special effects wizard. The cinematographer,
Guillermo Navarro, has worked with Quentin Tarantino and Robert
Rodriguez. 
Add up all that experience and you can please a lot of 13-year old boys.
But SPAWN can have a broader appeal, if you let it. Expectations are
everything, so do see this movie, but make sure you know what you're
getting into.

Title
Review for As Good As It Gets (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) Other people will tell you what's good about AS GOOD AS
IT GETS. They are not wrong, but too many people are putting this flawed
movie on their "ten best" lists, and I think a contrasting point of view
is deserved. 
The dialogue written for Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt by Mark Andrus
and Brooks is funny and fresh. Nicholson is great as Melvin, the cross
between Archie Bunker, Ebenezer Scrooge, and WHAT ABOUT BOB. Hunt is
very good as Carol the waitress, who endures Melvin when nobody else
will. Greg Kinnear is alright as Simon, Melvin's gay artist neighbor
whose little doggy is a source of friction between them. 
When Simon is hospitalized from a serious beating, Melvin is "suckered
in, set up, pushed around" into watching Simon's dog for him. The story
shows Melvin's slow and gradual redemption, starting with his affection
for the little dog. 
Melvin shows real progress toward becoming a likeable human being,
developing friendships both with Carol and with Simon, but the movie
runs into problems toward the end. 
The first sign of trouble comes when, after being paid the nicest
compliment of her life, Carol can't forgive Melvin a relatively small
slip of the tongue, even though she knows of his psychological handicap.
She storms out of the restaurant and into the arms of Simon. Simon SEEMS
to pose no sexual competition to Melvin, but his sensitivity proves
enough to satisfy Carol's needs. Carol and Simon realize they have
something good without Melvin. 
If that scene is as true as it plays, then the movie should logically
end as a tragedy for our main character Melvin. But because the genre is
romantic comedy, things have to work out for Melvin, and that makes the
previous scene a manipulative lie. 
What happens next is entirely too much will-they-or-won't-they. Since
the movie didn't end after Carol and Simon's night together, we know
that all the "tension" is a false attempt to pull on our heartstrings
one more time before the movie ends. It was a real disappointment after
an otherwise good movie. 
Perhaps another way to summarize what's wrong with AS GOOD AS IT GETS is
to say that the movie treats its female lead as an object. Melvin has
spent the entire movie proving himself worthy of Carol's affections, and
she has even come to accept them, fully knowing his flaws. But because
the writers need to drag the story out another 20 minutes, they have
Carol reject Melvin once or twice. She is not acting as a human being,
she is acting as the fickle object of Melvin's affections, serving the
purposes of her writers, not of herself. 
AS GOOD AS IT GETS reminds me of last year's JERRY MAGUIRE. Both are
heartwarming comedies about redemption, both are widely praised by
critics, but deep down, both are shallow and give too little freedom to
their characters, at the expense of manipulative, manufactured love
stories. 
This movie was a nice try: not quite perfect, but with lots of redeeming
qualities. Ordinarily I would recommend such a movie, but because this
movie has already gotten lots of praise - too much, in fact - I cannot.

Title
Review for Ayneh (1997)
***1/2 (out of 4) A film professor recalled that when he was little,
before he knew how movies worked, he assumed they were acted out live.
When you saw a movie twice, the actors had to do it all over again.
THE MIRROR is a thought-provoking, mindblower of a film that asks its
audience to believe just that.
Iranian director Jafar Panahi tells the story of Mina (Aida
Mohammadkhani), a grade schooler whose mother has not to come pick her
up this afternoon. The telephoto cinematography clutters the screen with
terrifying traffic jams and tangles of human legs, as Mina wanders the
streets of Teheran looking for help. Her teacher is busy talking to
other adults. Nobody answers the phone at her house. She is alone and
scared without anyone to get her home.
Mina gets a ride part-way with her teacher's friend. She gets off his
scooter at a bus stop. She rides a bus to the end of the line, listening
to the older women talk about men. But she is still no nearer to getting
un-lost.
So far, the movie has taken place in real time. That is to say, 45
minutes into the film, 45 minutes of Mina's "life" have passed.
At about the halfway point, Mina is on a bus, staring into the camera. A
voice says "Mina, don't look into the camera." After a tense moment,
Mina breaks down, angry and upset, and says "I don't want to act
anymore."
At this point, the color timing that makes a film look "polished" is
stopped and the film reverts to a more grainy, yellow look. The cameras
keep rolling as a crew member follows Mina off the bus to comfort and
reassure her. Others are sent with different tactics to try to convince
Mina to continue acting, but she refuses. She just wants to go home to
her mother.
The man behind "the camera," which we can now inexplicably see on
screen, realizes that Mina is still wearing her portable microphone. He
orders the crew to keep following her as she tries to get home. The
color timing starts back up and the film resumes, still in real time,
but now APPARENTLY as a documentary. The second half of the film mirrors
the first half. Mina still wants to get home, only this time, she
appears not to be acting for the camera.
Although the film hinges entirely on its gimmick, there is more to it
than JUST the gimmick. In addition to the rare glimpse of Iranian
culture, Panahi includes a cafeteria of food for thought, with each dish
made from the same tantalizing ingredient.
Broadly, the film asks what separates documentary film from fiction
film. But there are also specific puzzles, too. For example, in the
second half, Mina meets a woman from the bus in the first half. The
woman tells her that she was paid next to nothing to be in the movie and
that the lines she spoke were her real life. (But what about THESE
lines?)
Later Mina gets away from the camera truck, even though the microphone
is still working. Now off-camera, she meets the voice of John Wayne (the
man who dubbed the Duke's voice in Iranian movies). He tells Mina he saw
her shooting the opening of the film "two weeks ago," even though the
soccer game introduced at the start of the movie -- Iran vs. South Korea
-- is still being played. Appropriately, we never see "John Wayne's"
face -- he leaves Mina just before the camera finds her again.
If THE MIRROR never used its gimmick, it would still be an engrossing
film for its look at modern Iranian culture -- the segregated buses,
Mina's fearlessness of strangers, the "secret" talk of the women. But
THE MIRROR does crack, and the broken pieces make a unique, puzzling,
picture.

Title
Review for Lake Placid (1999)
** (out of 4) Lake Placid is a bad movie. But for a bad movie, it's
pretty fun. It has a good cast and it's "over the top." What else could
you call a movie featuring a wild animal death match between a crocodile
and a bear? (Okay, maybe Discovery Channel: The Movie.)
Lake Placid comes from a long line of ferocious animal movies with
titles like Tarantula! and Piranha! Its ancestors never rose very high
on the movie food chain, and Lake Placid doesn't rise any higher. It is
unmistakably a b-movie.
The ferocious animal in this movie is a gigantic crocodile and he's now
in Maine. Nobody knows how he got here, but there you have it. The first
sign of his presence is the disappearance of a few people from Black
Lake -- that plus the exaggerated, dark, symphonic soundtrack telling
you when to jump. Now, some people are starting to investigate.
Four people ultimately converge on the lake to investigate the mystery:
the local sheriff (Brendan Gleeson, fresh off his tour de force in The
General), a rep from Fish and Wildlife (Bill Pullman), a New York museum
paleontologist (Bridget Fonda), and a comically-eccentric, independently
wealthy, only-exists-in-the-movies, mythology professor (yes, mythology)
played by one of my favorite actors, Oliver Platt.
Leaving the monster aside, Pullman and Fonda were supposed to be the
love interest. Kelly (Fonda) had been dumped by her boss/boyfriend who
sent her to Black Lake ostensibly to look at the tooth from a recent
autopsy -- but really so that the boss can be alone with his new
girlfriend. Jack (Pullman) is a lonely man, just waiting for the right
girl to come along. The plot suggests that they were supposed to have
some chemistry, but there was never any spark between them. They were
one of the flattest screen "couples" in a long time.
On the other hand, there was some great chemistry between the professor
(Platt) and the sheriff (Gleeson). No, it was not sexual chemistry, it's
just that they had the most interesting relationship in the movie. The
sheriff was starting to get fed up with all the visitors to the lake.
Inevitably, they would end up in his boat, and inevitably they would
make all kinds of smart remarks to him.
The professor is just such a person, but three times as annoying.
Platt and Gleeson saw an opportunity to make their badly written
characters into something more interesting. They fed off each other and
escalated their little tiffs into show-stealing performances. Their
arguments were the best thing in the movie. I am sure their electric
relationship was completely unplanned and entirely to the credit of
these two very good actors. I wouldn't say they saved the movie -- it
was still pretty bad -- but they certainly made it more enjoyable.
In contrast, the comic relief was supposed to come from Betty White
playing Dolores. Dolores lives at the lake and takes care of the croc.
It is supposed to be funny that she cusses, swears, and feeds the beast
meat. Actually, it was kind of funny that she would take care of the
croc, but to have sweet old White swearing like a sailor just revealed
how uninspired and desperate David E. Kelley (the screenwriter) and
Miner were.
As for the movie's main character (the crocodile), he was almost
entirely rendered on a computer. For the most part, he was convincing
and was often worth marveling at. The image of a huge crocodile
advancing on a truckload of people was pretty tense, and surprisingly
believable. And when the thing moved, he had the look and feel of a real
reptile, not some computer-generated "reptile" formula.
So even though I know how bad this movie really is, I have to say I had
some fun. Still, I cannot in good conscience recommend it. It really is
a b-movie. The plot is pure formula, the lead characters were flat, and
the whole thing just crumbles under scrutiny. If you go, take your
lowest expectations and you might have some fun.

Title
Review for Scrapple (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4) Rookie Telluride filmmakers Christopher and Geoffrey
Hanson are taking their little film out into the big world.
Scrapple showed first at the Breckenridge and Slamdance film festivals.
Since then it has gone to Atlanta, Toronto, New York, and now, to
Boulder.
Scrapple is made of episodes and subplots, each of which adds a little
view to the film's big-picture look at a bygone era. Set in the early
1970s, Scrapple tries to capture the life of a little Colorado ski town
before its Aspenization.
The film focuses on Ajax, Colorado's young inhabitants. Al (Geoffrey
Hanson) is a housepainter, dope supplier, and bush-league baseball fan.
Tom (Buck Simmons) is Al's friend, who is haunted by the friendly ghost
of his ex-girlfriend. Beth is Tom's current love interest, but she
doesn't know if Tom can ever grow up and make a good partner. Errol
(Bunzy Bunworth) is an Australian who has ended up in Ajax as the town's
bartender and spiritual guide.
And then of course there's Scrapple the pig. Errol won him in a contest,
and Scrapple doesn't know that he's spending his last summer on Earth.
His destiny is to be the town's main course at the big feast at the end
of the summer. Meanwhile, he'll enjoy the view.
The story meanders through the summer mountain valley, variously
following Al and Tom - Al as he tries to scrape up enough money to buy a
house for him and his wheelchair-bound brother, and Tom as he tries to
cope with the death of his girlfriend.
Scrapple does a good job at capturing a unique time and place. The
cinematography and setting are quaint and inviting. The clothes, hair,
and culture (drug references, astrology, etc.) identify the half-decade,
without drawing unnecessary attention to themselves. In fact, one of the
best things about Scrapple is that it carefully avoids the easy trap of
making cheap jokes about the fashion and attitudes of its time. 
The film was made on a shoestring budget with amateurs and friends of
the director filling in most of the roles. Sometimes this is too
apparent as stiff, uncomfortable actors are thrust in front of an
oddly-placed camera. Once the movie gets started, it's easy to get used
to the style, but occasionally a performance will jump out and remind
you this is a cheap movie.
Also, the plot seemed unfocused for much of the movie. Since the film is
episodic, it wasn't often distracting, but I sometimes wondered where
the film was going. Nevertheless, by the end things began to come
together. Loose threads were tied up neatly, ultimately leaving you with
a sense of completion and satisfaction - and with a real sense of the
fictional town of Ajax.
Scrapple may not be the best film in town, but its local take on the
culture of the seventies is worth a look.

Title
Review for Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4) There is a rule of thumb that says odd-numbered Star
Trek movies are bad, and even-numbered ones are good (INSURRECTION is
Star Trek 9). I really hate that rule because at some point it becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy. People look for flaws in odd movies and
OVERlook them in even movies. STAR TREK: INSURRECTION is, to some
extent, a victim of this perception, particularly from that most
ubiquitous critic, Roger Ebert.
This time, the film opens on an idyllic little planet with kids
frolicking in stacks of hay. Commander Data is part of an invisible crew
that's monitoring the progress of this civilization. Without warning,
Data apparently goes berserk, firing on the other anthropologists and
exposing himself and the other scientists to the unsuspecting
civilization.
Concerned (but strangely, not shocked), Captain Picard ditches a boring
diplomatic party and takes the Enterprise to the planet where Data was
working. Picard heads out in a shuttlecraft to capture the rogue
android.
Sure enough, there was a perfectly logical explanation for his behavior.
It turns out that a blow to his head (from one of the other
anthropologists, no less) disabled Data's neocortex, leaving his base
programming to kick in. Since his base programming says to protect the
innocent, the crew of the Enterprise is left wondering what the
anthropologists were doing. Why would Data's base, unreasoning altruism
dictate that he blow their cover?
Turns out the Ba'ku, the "anthropologists," were not merely studying the
Son'a, the planet-dwellers -- they were trying to figure out how to
steal their fountain of youth. The way to steal the rejuvenating
"waters" would involve destroying both the local solar system AND the
source of the fount. Ordinarily, this would be a space no-no.
But since the Son'a, it is learned, are space-age settlers, and not a
native, developing culture, the Federation considers them exempt from
the protections of the Prime Directive. (For the uninitiated, the Prime
Directive was conceived by Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry during the
Vietnam War. It says that the Federation cannot interfere with the
affairs of developing civilizations). The crew of the Enterprise
disagrees. They think this unique culture should be protected. Thus the
film's title: insurrection.
Although this film is actually a mediocre entry into the series, this
moral question is worth talking about. Is it okay to move 600 people off
their homeland so that billions of other people might benefit?
The Federation says yes. More influentially, Roger Ebert says yes, and
he even got the cast of the
film to say yes, although he phrased the question in a way that slanted
the responses.
Ebert failed to take into account three key points. One, these billions
of lives won't be SAVED, they will merely be IMPROVED. Two, extracting
the youth-water destroys its natural source. Three, there is no
guarantee that, once extracted, the stuff can be replicated.
I'd like to propose a comparable, modern-day question. Would it be okay
to destroy a rainforest (where some Quaker settlers have been living for
hundreds of years), to build a road, to get to a small puddle of
something like aspirin? Everyone on the planet can have a little taste,
but there's no guarantee we can synthesize it in a laboratory once the
supply is gone.
Seems like a big waste of resources, a situation ripe for corruption,
and a rash destruction of something that future generations may be able
to better understand and use. Seems like the sane, sensible thing, would
be to leave this fountain of youth intact for further study by future
generations.
At least, that's what I think Roddenberry would say.  
Aside from the moral dilemma, STAR TREK: INSURRECTION is alright. It
wasn't my favorite, and in fact, Data's naďve antics were starting to
get on my nerves. It will probably fade into obscurity, as many of the
other odd-numbered movies have.
It's just too bad that the Star Trek Rule of Thumb had to gain
credibility, because it may doom 50% of all future Trek movies to
failure.

Review for Addicted to Love (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) Romantic comedies are often hard to differentiate. You
might think that a great romantic comedy would need something special
to set it apart -- a great gimmick that works well on film, funny
scenes, and great chemistry. Of these attributes, Addicted to Love only
lacks great chemistry.
Goes to show how important that attribute is.
Sam the astronomer (Matthew Broderick) tries to keep his girlfriend
Linda (Kelly Preston) from leaving their small hometown for New York
City. But she feels constricted by small town life and leaves anyway.
Sam waits for Linda to come back, but she doesn't return. Instead she
sends him a "Dear John" letter.
Sam doesn't take being dumped lightly, so he sets off for New York in
search of Linda.
He finds her with her new boyfriend and he watches them through the
window. He discovers that the apartment across the street is abandoned
so he makes a nest.  He orders a few spare parts from his observatory
and lines all the pieces up just right so that his camera obscura
projects what's happening across the street onto the big back wall of
the abandoned apartment.
In an inspired moment of great filmmaking, Sam "paints" Linda on the
wall. The projected image from the camera obscura is muted because the
wall is brown.  Sam starts painting the wall silvery white, following
Linda's virtual image around her apartment. Each time she moves, Sam
follows, leaving a trail of reflected light where he goes.
Maggie (Meg Ryan) moves into Sam's nest without telling him who she is
or what she's doing. Turns out that Maggie's ex-boyfriend (Anton,
played by Tcheky Karyo) is seeing Sam's ex-girlfriend. Maggie has
chosen Sam's nest as the best place to bug and monitor Anton's
apartment.
Between Sam's and Maggie's equipment, they have picture and sound: a
live-action movie of their ex-significant others.
Though Sam's motives are pathetic and Maggie's are spiteful, they find
they have a common goal -- breaking up Anton and Linda -- Sam, so he
can reunite with Linda, and Maggie, so she can revel in her revenge.
Most of their schemes are funny, and the movie is full of great lines.
One scene has Maggie and Sam watching Anton and Linda with the sound
off, while Maggie and Sam supply running comedy a la Mystery Science
Theater 3000.
If you've seen the previews (or if you know the genre) you already know
how it inevitably must end. Actually, the movie ends much more kindly
and humanely than it could have, but really there are no surprises.
Overall, the movie was enjoyable, and it's hard to fault it for
anything in particular.  Mostly, the problem is that Sam and Maggie
lack chemistry. Most of the time, they don't need it, but eventually,
it becomes important. (It's hard to imagine Broderick having
"chemistry" with anyone.)
But even with everything this movie did right, it just doesn't add up
to greatness.
P.S. you might be glad to know the title song never played over the
movie.  Frankly, the title seems like an afterthought. But a rose by
any other name . . . .

Title
Review for Selena (1997)
*** (out of 4) After watching SELENA it's hard not to like the "Tejano"
singer.
I went to the movie knowing very little about Selena's music. I even
anticipated that I might not like it very well, because there are types
of Tex-Mex music that I can't stand (e.g., norteno music, the Mexican
version of polka). I was relieved that Selena didn't do polka, but I
still don't think I'd go buy her albums. Her music just doesn't appeal
to me.
Luckily, the movie doesn't require that you love -- or even like --
Selena's music. The movie focuses enough on the characters and the story
that even non-fans can enjoy it. I did.
Selena was a pop music singer. She rose to fame singing Tex-Mex songs in
Spanish and she was just making progress as a crossover singer --
crossing over to mainstream pop in English --  when she was gunned down
at age 23, ironically, by the president of her fan club.
SELENA tells the story both of Selena (Jennifer Lopez) and of her father
Abraham (Edward James Olmos). The movie opens with Selena's last big
concert in the Houston Astrodome. Her opening number is a medley
starting with "I Will Survive," a bit of heavy-handed irony that could
have been overplayed, but which ends up working rather well.
The movie then flashes back to her father's early stint in music, before
Selena was born. Abraham's doo-wop group is pretty good, but can't get a
gig anywhere because racist Anglos won't hire a group of Mexicans and
Mexicans don't want to listen to doo-wop.
The movie jumps forward several years, to when Selena is just 9. Abraham
discovers that music runs in the Quintanilla family like Mexican blood.
Little Selena proves to have the same love of, and more talent for,
music than he has. Her voice and interest in music inspire him to buy a
vanload of instruments for his whole family. After a rocky start, they
begin to sound pretty good together. They stick together through it all
and move on to the big time.
Though the subject herself isn't that interesting to me, I like the
story and the characters in SELENA.
SELENA is a rags-to-riches story, but it shuns the extremes common to
movies of this sort. Selena was not dirt-poor as a child. Her father was
difficult at times, but he was not portrayed as an inhuman monster. He
pushed the kids to practice, but he didn't crack the whip. He
disapproved of Selena's boyfriend, but he knew when he was overreacting
and was able to apologize. There were obstacles and conflicts, but none
of them were blown out of proportion.
Also, though Selena is murdered in the end, the movie manages to be a
triumphal story and not a tragedy. Her death is tragic, but the tone of
the movie is gracious and joyful, not bitter and sad. Come to think of
it, that's probably the better way to be remembered. It is more
generous, more healthful, to celebrate a person's life than to brood
over their death.
The characters in SELENA are well developed and likeable. Abraham, as I
mentioned, is not presented as an ogre. He is stern, but he loves his
kids as most fathers do, and his family always comes first.
Jon Seda plays Chris, Selena's boyfriend, guitarist, and husband with
quiet, shy, downcast eyes in spite of his heavy metal tendencies. When
the time comes for him to say "I love you," it's not just because the
script calls for it; it's because Chris and Selena have become best
friends.
Lopez shines as Selena who is always cheerful and seems to have a true
love for life. When a boy climbs on stage and starts dancing with her,
she stops the security guard from removing him. Soon she is dancing with
a stageful of smiling children. When she sticks up for Chris, it is not
an act of defiance to her father, it is truly defense of her best
friend.
The movie has its shortcomings. Nava and editor Nancy Richardson
introduced a motif of the moon that doesn't play well. A split-screen
effect is used occasionally that doesn't play well and is distracting.
Worst of all, the ending is some sort of jump to reality; real-life
mourners are intercut with footage of the real-life Selena. This
sequence brought to mind the coda of SCHINDLER'S LIST and the comparison
left a bad taste in my mouth.
Still, the movie is worth seeing, even if you don't like the music. It's
a shame that the movie came out only two years after Selena's death
because it seems like the movie is carefully targeted at just her fans
and mourners. I wonder if a greater distance might have made her story
more universal and given this fine movie a broader audience.

Title
Review for Office Space (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) As uneven and unfocused as OFFICE SPACE is, it hits
home with enough jokes to make it an enjoyable comedy.
You'd think a movie about life in a cubicle would necessarily resemble
Dilbert. But OFFICE SPACE gives itself some distance from the outlandish
comic strip by having more humanly interesting characters and being much
more insightful. Instead of going for the broad, exaggerated gags (well,
it goes for them too), it goes for the more mundane, subtle comedy and
irony of being a Gen-X drone.
For example, Peter (Ron Livingston) begins every day with an unavoidable
static electric shock as he opens the door to the Initech offices. All
the professionals drive plain, silver Toyotas and live in apartments
that look like they're furnished by Target. As naďve and whitebread as
they are, they still listen to gangsta rap. Their detached, monotonous,
mockable boss decorates his office with "Cathy" cartoons.  
Then again, some of the gags are just too obvious to be funny, like the
elderly man outrunning the flow of the traffic jam, or the
squeaky-pitched receptionist incessantly answering the phone across from
Peter, or Michael's (David Herman) heated, personal feud with his
printer.
The movie seems like a string of these skits, corralled together by
their common office setting. (Jennifer Aniston is introduced as a love
interest, which allows the movie to run a few gags at the
"Bennigans"-style restaurant where she works.) But eventually, one idea
starts to take shape as the movie's main plot: Peter stops caring about
work after a hypnotherapist fails to take him out of a trance.
Ironically, his new attitude boosts him up the corporate ladder, even as
his hard-working friends are being laid off.
Peter has not forgotten his friends, though, and to show his solidarity
with them, he helps them come up with a scheme to embezzle money from
Initech.
If Mike Judge had more guts, or any respect for his "work sucks"
message, his protagonists would have stuck it to the man and gotten away
with it. They could have been downsized Davids putting one over on the
corporate Goliath. Wouldn't that be a glorious, triumphant message in
this age of corporations denigrating their employees and customers in
order to worship their shareholders?
But it quickly becomes clear that our heroes are too clean and meek to
make good criminals. They fit the sitcom-character mold that says they
have to end the episode where they started. You can deduce, even without
seeing it, that in order for our heroes to get out of the mess they
made, the movie will necessarily have a contrived, DEUS EX MACHINA
ending.
OFFICE SPACE has the look and feel of a low-budget student film, with
cheap sets, lots of gags, and a few unknown actors. Combined with the
moth-eaten, patchwork plot, a less funny movie could have been downright
bad. But luckily for Judge -- and for us -- OFFICE SPACE actually is
funny. Not always, but often enough.

Title
Review for Private Parts (1997)
*** If anyone ever had to play Howard Stern in a cartoon, Alan Alda is
the man. Stern and Alda have the same projecting deep voice with just a
hint of an east-coast accent. It's eerie. But I digress already. 
Private Parts is a typical rags-to-riches story. It tells the life of
Howard Stern from cowed kid to troubled teen to Number One in New York.
Along the way he gets married, finds the perfect co-hosts and pisses off
his bosses and their advertisers while pumping his show's ever-growing
ratings. 
 The story is told (mostly) chronologically, but it plays more like a
series of comic bits threaded together. There's not much overarching
plot or conflict, but structuring and pacing the movie this way was the
right decision. There is some growth in Stern's character, but that's
not what's interesting about the man. What's interesting is the funny
stuff he does on the air, and there's no overarching coherence to any of
that. 
Private Parts handles this problem of realism very well. When a movie is
based on actual people, sometimes it's distracting when you don't know
what's true and what was made up for the movie. Just rent an Oliver
Stone movie (JFK, The Doors, Nixon) if you doubt me. 
Private Parts tells you right out that it could be lying at any time.
Early on, the movie shows us Stern's childhood while in voiceover, Stern
describes his parents as very restrictive. The movie cuts to a shot of
his actual parents, today, denying everything we just saw on screen.
There are documentary aspects to the movie, intermixed with standard,
staged movie drama, along with Stern the man's voiceover for Stern the
character. The movie tells you that the drama and "reality" are mixed
together and that you shouldn't believe everything you see. 
 Again, this was the right decision for the movie because it allows more
funny stuff to happen without raising the distracting questions of
reality. A young starlet invites Stern to have his way with her in a
bathtub. First, it seems unlikely it would happen to an admittedly ugly
man like Stern; it seems much more likely that he's trying to impress
the Stern-worshippers in the audience. Then, when he turns her down
(sort of), it seems much more likely that he's trying to impress the
other half of the audience. Maybe what's on screen is all true, but
because the movie plays loose with the facts anyway, it doesn't matter.
It's a funny bit that adds to the movie. 
 After the movie, I liked Howard Stern. He comes off as a fun, likeable,
good guy. A little more thought reveals how well made and well
publicized this movie is. I don't know if I'd really like the real
Howard Stern, but by playing up the character Stern's devotion to his
wife and setting up straw-man detractors for him to knock down, he
becomes not just the hero of the movie, but a hero 
 By playing "match game" with his co-hosts, he gets the "contestants" to
say "pussy" and "cock" on the air by having them complete the phrases
_____ Willow and ____-a-Doodle-Doo. In the context of an irrational,
unfair, red-faced, prig of a program director sworn to the task of
keeping Stern reined in, this is a very funny and satisfying bit. Try to
imagine the same bit without that straw-man context, though, and four
adults giggling at the words "cock" and "pussy" is almost sad. 
 The publicity plays on Stern's reputation as a vulgar, obscene,
despicable fellow. Stern himself bragged to several critics about how
successful the movie was with test audiences, even with those who say
they don't like Howard Stern. One ad for the movie even says "the most
shocking thing about this movie is how much people love it." But really,
by building up this bad-boy aura about Stern, the publicists are also
setting up their own straw men for the public to knock down when they
see the movie, by finding the movie's radio bits more amusing than
offensive and by finding character Stern to be a loving family man. 
 The movie and the publicity are manipulative and the movie lies to the
audience, but in the case of Private Parts, it's all in the name of
making a better movie. I found it enjoyable and funny, and I found
myself liking Howard Stern. The movie says Stern is not only successful,
he's as a decent family man, too. Who could possibly dislike such an
American figure?

Title
Review for Vita č bella, La (1997)
**** (out of 4) LA VITA É BELLA (LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL) is a lightweight
drama. Directed by and starring one of Italy's greatest living comics,
it naturally contains some comic scenes. I mention these facts up-front
because they become interesting once you know that half the film is set
in a Nazi prison camp.
Mixing humor and concentration camps is audacious, and it has stirred a
healthy amount of controversy. Some say that the very idea cheapens the
memory of those who lost their lives. Frankly, it's hard to argue with
that point of view. If you can't forgive a movie for attempting such a
combination, you should skip it.
However, if you're willing to be open, Benigni handles the mix very
well. By focusing on the bond between father and son, and only drawing a
sketchy picture of the horrible life of Jewish prisoners, Benigni moved
and shrunk the target for criticism, and he allowed the small human
story to bloom.
The movie begins like any other light romantic drama. It is Italy,
before the war. Guido (Benigni) is a waiter with a penchant for riddles.
He is in love with a woman whom he's met only once. Through a series of
coincidences (some of them arranged) he finally gets to know Dora
(Nicoletta Braschi), the woman of his dreams.
Guido learns that Dora, a schoolteacher, is already promised to someone
"better," someone with more prestige and money than him. Nevertheless,
he persists in pursuing her affections.
Guido's charm is amazing. In one of the finest comic set pieces on film,
several gags, which have been set up over about 20 minutes of screen
time, are paid off, one by one, all to impress a beautiful girl. The
effect marvelous, both for the audience and for Dora.
One evening at a party, the cheerful harmony of the film starts to
shift. A horse of Guido's uncle has been painted bright green with
anti-Semitic slogans. A handful of partygoers, interested in the new
German situation, talk casually about mathematical word problems
involving money saved by executing cripples. Nevertheless, the film's
melody remains bright, for this is the night that Guido finally captures
Dora's heart, her soul, and her body.
The film cuts forward in time. Italy has changed drastically, especially
for Italian Jews. Guido now has a son, to whom he teaches meekness in
the face of repressive Italian authority. Meekness is life. The
alternative is death. And as the title reminds us, life - any life - is
beautiful.
Although he doesn't deal with the mistreatment of Jews as a whole,
Benigni shows how institutionalized racism affected a single ordinary
man. On their way home one day Guido and his son Giosué (Girogio
Cantarini) encounter a storefront sign that says "No Jews or Dogs."
How would you explain this sign, not as a historian, but as a father to
your son? How do you tell him what it means without blackening his
heart? Guido not only answers his son's questions, he does it in a way
that removes them from the cruelty, and elevates them above their cold
reality. In addition, it illustrates for the audience how childish the
sign really is.
Needless to say, the sign was a sign of worse things to come. It isn't
long before Guido and his son are shipped off to a prison camp. Now
instead of a single insulting sign, Guido has a whole world, an entire
reality, to explain away.
In this last half of the film, Guido tries desperately to come up with
an elaborate explanation of their situation. They are not in a prison
camp, they are playing an extended game. There are rules, opponents, and
points earned for bravery and for not talking. If they can only earn
1,000 points, they will win a tank and get to go home.  
The real heart of the movie is that Guido doesn't see anything fun about
his "game." He loves his son so much that he will risk everything, not
just to protect his body, but to protect his mind and soul as well. The
task is overwhelming, and it seems doomed to failure, but Guido refuses
to quit.
It is this indomitable struggle for some tiny shred of goodness and
hope, in the face of an overwhelming evil, that makes this film so
moving.
Benigni is great in the role of Guido. He knows that fighting the
situation head-on is futile. All he can do is smirk at the absurdity of
the Nazi ideology. But Benigni is careful never to laugh too hard, and
he never pretends he can fight head-on as a prisoner. He plays the part
with an ironic resignation that is perfect for this film.
This film has stirred resentment and disdain in some critics. That a
light, often humorous drama is set in a Nazi prison camp are an
unacceptable mix, they say. Others blame the director for deliberately
using that combination to push buttons and pull strings.
While I wouldn't argue with them - I don't think I could say anything to
change their minds - I do disagree. To the first objection I would say
that Benigni has as much right to set a story in a prison camp as any
other filmmaker. While his depiction wasn't as grim or graphic as in
other films, he still handled the setting with an appropriate gravity.
To the second objection, I would say: let your buttons be pushed and
your strings be pulled. Why else do we go to movies if not to be moved?
Giving myself to the film, I was rewarded with one of the most moving
and crushing films in years. Though I often cry at movies, I rarely lose
control. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, and its simple message that life - any life
- is beautiful, nearly succeeded.

Title
Review for Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997)
*** (out of 4) ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION is nearly
flawless. That's not to say that it's great (or even good, necessarily),
but it does accomplish what it sets out to do.
It's been ten years since Romy and Michele graduated. They are still
living together, partying together, dieting together, and when there are
no cute guys, dancing together. Romy (or is that Michele?) works as a
cashier at a garage specializing in Jaguars, and Michele is unemployed.
Their lives are not defined by their jobs, but by their vanity, their
clothes, and their social life.
At work, Romy runs into her old classmate Heather (vibrantly played by
Janeane Garofalo, whom I hope we start seeing more of). Seeing Heather,
Romy realizes how much time really has passed. She talks Michele into
going back to Tucson for their high school reunion.
The two concoct a story to convince everyone back home that they are
successful businesswomen. To back up the story, they design their own
"business suits" and wrangle a Jaguar from Romy's work. When the show
up, they show up in style.
Woven into the story are the defining moments from ten years ago that
make us understand why these two are eager to return home -- both to show
themselves off and to see how their friends and enemies are doing.
ROMY AND MICHELE works well, at least in part, because it doesn't judge
the main characters too harshly. The movie is practically made of blonde
jokes, but the characters are always in on the jokes, if not telling
them. No jokes are made at the expense of their dignity.
The movie also has a joy for life that shines through all the rigors of
filmmaking. The scene that comes to mind is the fantastic pas de trois
dance scene at the end. The broad choreographed movements are funny, but
the dance continues and it's not just a joke. Romy, Michele, and their
partner (I won't give away who it is) seem to really be living life and
enjoying themselves. The rest of us, both on screen and in the audience
look on in jealous admiration of their dance of life.
Along the same lines, the events of the movie lead up to a moral, of
sorts. I feared that the moral would be some awkward lesson imposed by
the film's producer, not learned by the main characters. But when the
time came, the lesson was simple, not shallow, and quite appropriate to
the characters.
The movie gets off to a slow start. Some of the early jokes are obvious
and the timing is a little off. But even though the movie takes a while
to hit its stride, it is well worth the wait.

Title
Review for Voci nel tempo (1996)
*** (out of 4) VOCI NEL TEMPO (VOICES THROUGH TIME) is a beautiful,
original Italian film that you can only see in Boulder, and only for the
next few weeks.
VOICES THROUGH TIME is a nonnarrative film. It's not a documentary - in
fact each shot is staged and acted. But it doesn't have a narrative plot
in the usual, movie sense of the word. Instead, the entire film, as a
whole, tells the story of being human. Starting at infancy and adding
from there, each segment shows different stages of life, ultimately
forming a mosaic of the human lifetime.
VOICES THROUGH TIME opens on dawn, sunrise, a kitten, and an infant. A
toddler struggles with a tall stone staircase, and soon young children
are holding imaginary conversations or roughhousing on the grass for a
dizzied camera. They run around a concrete well in the town's central
courtyard on their way to play soccer.
Later, older girls, just past puberty, sit together on the same concrete
well, dressed to impress the boys. The boys arrive in a pack, each one
on a scooter or motorcycle. The ride circles around the girls, posturing
and strutting their plumage. 
The girls whisper to each other, but Director Franco Piavoli wisely
decides not to use subtitles. Their coy glances and awkward stares tell
the story better than any language. Also, the foreignness of the words
gives the film an anthropological quality that makes the film more
timeless and universal. One gets the sense that these could be any
people, anywhere in the world. And that universality is central to the
film.
After the acne-faced strutting, VOICES moves on to a group of young
adults at a dance. The boys and girls have mixed together now. Their
vigor and enthusiasm is captured with the same cinematography as the
play and wrestling of the younger children, though now their energy is
harnessed and focused into the dance. Naturally, a wedding scene soon
follows.
All ages of people come together for the wedding. The newlyweds don't
remain at the center for very long, as they quickly drive off to their
honeymoon. But the old folks sit around for quite some time and talk and
sing songs. Later, a few couples dance, though much more gingerly than
the younger couples.
Soon it is night and the long slow process of aging manifests itself in
the film. After the young men have driven away to work, the old men
putter in the courtyard by the well, listening to the voice of a young
lady singing her voice lessons. Clocks tick as the remaining adults wait
for the inevitable last stage of life.
Between the wedding and old age, there are no scenes of working, raising
children, or keeping house. For most people, this would be about half of
a lifetime. The omission might be a deliberate comment on how quickly
and uneventfully this time of life passes, but its absence left me
wondering what Piavoli has to say about people my age.
Also at this point in the film, the message becomes somewhat muddled.
One sequence shows a shots of trains, planes, and cars that are intercut
with older and younger people alike. Is this the section on absent,
middle-aged people running the world, or is it about the isolation of
age? Whatever was intended, the message is less clear and forceful than,
say, a screen full of just children.
Nevertheless, VOICES THROUGH TIME is transfixing. Its observant,
unobtrusive style of cinematography perfectly captures the people in
their verdant, rural setting. Its universal story takes the entire
duration of the film to unfold. Each scene is beautiful and interesting
in itself, and then these pieces join to form a larger, more important
picture. It is a picture rarely, if ever, captured on film.

Title
Review for Mimic (1997)
** (out of 4) I went to MIMIC because it seemed like a good idea for a
thriller. During a deadly epidemic spread by cockroaches, a well-meaning
entomologist introduces a genetically engineered suicide-bomber
cockroach called the Judas breed. The Judas infiltrates the cockroach
nest, then releases a poison, killing all the disease-ridden bugs. The
process works and the epidemic is stopped, but the Judas turns out not
to have been sterile after all, and they have now been breeding and
mutating for thousands of generations. . . . 
It IS a good idea for a thriller, maybe along the lines of THE ANDROMEDA
STRAIN or OUTBREAK. But scratch the surface, and you'll see that MIMIC
is not as good as its shell would have you believe. 
The movie is advertised as a "sci-fi thriller." It is not. It is a
horror movie. The distinction is, as film historian Bruce Kawin points
out, that in a science fiction movie, science is the good guy, and
victory comes through intelligence and technology. In horror movies,
like MIMIC, science is the bad guy and victory comes through violence. 
But because the movie was conceived of as a science fiction story, ideas
that could have made it a good horror film were not played up, and round
ideas that could have made it good science fiction were forced into
square, horror-film holes. 
For example, there is a lot of entomology jargon in the movie. Susan
Tyler (Mira Sorvino), our scientist, explains how the Judas breed works.
Later she explains insect behavior to a couple of kids. Both scenes tell
us that knowledge of insects will be relevant to the final outcome of
the movie. Then the movie proceeds to show us a creature that is
entomologically and evolutionarily impossible. Are we supposed to pay
attention to the science, or are we supposed to suspend our disbelief?
The movie asks us to do both, which is distracting and keeps us from
getting into the movie. 
Specifically, the movie asserts that the monstrous Judas breed somehow
evolved from its laboratory forefathers. But only one generation was
released onto the world, and that generation was genetically sterile.
Evolution happens at reproduction; mutations are passed to the NEXT
generation. A genetically sterile generation could never reproduce to
pass the incredible mutations to its offspring. 
But let's say that God steps in and reverses the genetic sterility. The
monsters infesting the subways of New York are very large (man-sized).
The movie says that the only reason insects are usually small is their
lack of lungs. Actually, there's much more to it than that. Gigantic
insects need more than "lungs" to account for all the surface
area-to-volume ratio problems that would arise (exoskeleton weight,
metabolic rate, flight capability, etc.). 
So Mimic should have either ditched the science altogether (like ALIENS,
where the heroes don't care about the science, they just want to nuke
the buggers), or it should have made the monsters some other sort of
super-cockroaches. Lord knows hordes of cockroaches are scary enough,
even without being man-sized. 
This may all sound like nitpicking, but the movie has other flaws, too.
Two of its characters were of cardboard depth. The shoe shiner
(Giancarlo Giannini) is a kindly old immigrant. His kid (Alexander
Goodwin) is autistic, with a talent for identifying shoes that proves
useful against the insect monsters (puh-leeze). 
Then there's the movie's moral climax. Usually in this type of movie,
the scientist who unleashed the monster pays the ultimate price (read
FRANKENSTEIN, or look at Paul Reiser's character in ALIENS). But in
MIMIC, the scientist is a woman, and with several valiant (chauvinistic)
men to sacrifice themselves, she never even comes close to taking the
ultimate metaphoric responsibility for unleashing the monster on the
world. Are the filmmakers saying that women should have a lower standard
than men? That men are good for cleaning up after a woman's mistakes? 
Though they weren't enough to save the movie, there were some good
performances and some interesting ideas in MIMIC. Mira Sorvino is
believably good as a determined scientist; (compare her performance to
that of Elisabeth Shue in THE SAINT). Charles S. Dutton is a character
actor, but his shtick is likeable enough, and his role suited his
persona pretty well. 
There is an enjoyably gross scene where the heroes have to rub insect
glands all over their bodies. It's interesting that as the characters
get used to the idea, so does the audience. The first time someone
squeezes goop from the bug, the characters and audience wince in
disgust. Later on, reapplying the goop is no more disgusting than
putting on lotion. The character's desperation and will to survive has
acclimated both them and us to the awful necessity. 
A little bit of research on Bryant Frazer's part reveals that Graphic
Designer Kyle Cooper is responsible for the credits of both MIMIC and of
SEVEN; both are very cool. (He also created the extreme credit sequence
forSPAWN). 
But even these highlights show that the movie is inconsistent and
unfocused, which means that Mimic is unrewarding.

Title
Review for October Sky (1999)
*** (out of 4) I liked OCTOBER SKY and was moved by it in all the right
ways. But it's a movie that doesn't stand up to review very well.
Two-dimensional characters and a trite story (even though it's based on
a true story) almost force me to give it a lower rating than my heart
says it deserves.
While the miners of the town descend into the coal mines, high schooler
Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal) looks up to the stars to try to see
Sputnik. His first glimpse of the orbiter sets his resolve: someday he
will build rockets and satellites too.
Homer knows just enough about rocketry to know that he can't pursue it
alone. Since his coal-mining hometown has a definite lack of rocket
scientists to serve as mentors, he decides to sacrifice his social life
to befriend Quentin (Chris Owen), the redheaded nerd. Two other friends
of Homer's join them, rounding out their foursome. With Quentin's smarts
and Homer's enthusiasm, they should be able to launch a rocket in no
time.
The rocket boys master the basics pretty quickly, and they even manage a
meager launch or two. But each accomplishment presents new challenges.
The next rocket has to be bigger, fly farther, or have more control.
They boys hit several snags, and their solutions always delight. To
solve one problem, Quentin bones up on volatile chemistry until
inspiration strikes. Another problem is solved by befriending some of
the miners who have access to metal lathes.
In the meantime, a subplot involving Homer's differences with his father
(Chris Cooper) adds some too-harsh conflict to the film. Homer's father
is completely overbearing and totally inflexible. He's dead-set against
Homer's dreams of rockets. Based on a true story or not, the sharp
antagonism was too strong for this movie.
In fact, his father was so caricatured (blame the script, not the actor)
that I was reminded of a Monty Python sketch. Graham Chapman plays a
stern, hard-working, blue-collar poet. This poet refuses to stand by
while his mamby-pamby son throws away his life to follow his dream of
becoming a coal miner. It's a funny reversal of the cliché that this
movie perpetuates.
In spite of Homer's dad, the boys finally get a few really good rockets
launched. But OCTOBER SKY sticks to the formula and takes their dreams
away, once and for all. A forest fire spread from where one of their
rockets landed, and the boys are arrested. All seems lost, so Homer
gives up rocketry and high school to get an early start on coal mining.
The film actually takes us down into a coal mine (surely it was a set).
I mention it because it is something I have NEVER seen in a movie
before. From HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY in 1941 to BRASSED OFF two years
ago, there have been lots of movies about coal miners. But never have I
actually seen INSIDE one of the mines, -- seen how cramped, black, and
precarious the mine itself feels. October Sky gets bonus points for
these scenes.
But if that were the end of the story, we wouldn't be watching it on a
big screen, would we? In fact, the boys find a way to clear their names.
They calculate the flight time of their rocket, do a little geometry,
and track down the rocket that was alleged to have started the fire.
They found it in a stream. (Strictly speaking, they never could have
found their rocket from the information they had in the movie. They knew
flight time and direction, but not the angle at which the rocket was
launched. Without that, there's no way to measure distance.)
Like I said, the movie doesn't review well. The plot is trite, the
conflict feels forced, and even the math doesn't work out perfectly.
But Homer's story was moving, and all the more so because his goal was
scientific achievement. In movies with this success-story plot, the hero
often wants to become a great athlete or a famous performer. Homer's
dream was more unusual and somehow less selfish.
Ultimately, the emotion of the story simply worked for me, and I'll
never be able to put my finger on just why.

Title
Review for Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)
***1/2 (out of 4)   Lost World: Jurassic Park is the epitome of
American mainstream action movies. Spielberg has been through this
routine so many times that it has become second nature. He is a master
at what he does. It's not that he makes it look easy, it's that he
makes it seamless. One doesn't notice the acting or the editing or the
music; instead, we get caught up in the story and hold on to our
seats.
For the six of you on the planet who didn't see Jurassic Park, a
scientist, John Hammond, found a way to bring dinosaurs back to life by
cloning ancient DNA.  The dinosaurs were bred and raised as exhibits
for a brand-new safari park. At the park's premiere, the dinosaurs ran
amok and killed lots of people.
At the beginning of Lost World, we learn that those dinosaurs were
destroyed, but that other dinosaurs on another island survived. Now,
naturalists are going to the island to study dinosaur behavior and
"adventurers" are going back for fun and profit. Ian Malcolm, a
mathematician who survived Jurassic Park, is going to the island to
save his girlfriend (Dr. Sarah Harding, played by Julianne Moore).
But really, what does plot matter when you have an excellent summer
action movie with cool special effects?
Spielberg said something like, "Last time we invented the instrument.
This time we learned how to play it." That's a very apt summary of Lost
World. In Jurassic Park, the dinosaurs were treated with a sense of
awe: their mere existence (both on film and in the film) was enough.
The first time we see them, the characters spend a few moments staring
at the brachiosaurs. They didn't really have to do anything because we
hadn't seen them before.This time, Spielberg gets to the dinosaur
scenes more quickly and spends less time introducing them.  This allows
for more screen time devoted to seeing them doing cool stuff, like
eating people.
There are new dinosaurs in this movie. The little "compys" attack in
little hops, jumps, and nips. But because of their sheer numbers they
are almost more frightening than the big Tyrannosaurus Rexes. There are
two T. Rexes this time, along with a little baby one. And of course the
velociraptors are back (though not as prominently featured as last
time).
There is also an excellent action sequence that involves a T. Rex
pushing an occupied bus over a cliff. The sequence lasts several
minutes, and the tension never lets up.
Another sequence shows the dinosaurs on the run from the hunters. In
perhaps the most amazing shot, the camera follows a motorcycle through
the legs of a running dinosaur.
For the six of you on the planet who are going to this movie to see the
characters, they were alright. The big game hunter Roland Tembo (played
impatiently by Pete Postlethwaite -- don't you just love saying that
name?) was hard not to like.  Goldblum played the same character as
last time, a little flatly, but he was given some good lines. His
daughter was likeably headstrong without being a "tomboy." That she was
a different race and that the movie didn't apologize for it or explain
it away was a nice bow to color blindness (reminiscent of the casting
of Kenneth Branagh and Denzel Washington in Much Ado about Nothing).
A few little jokes are hidden in the movie near the end. Japanese
businessmen run away from the rampaging monster in a wry little quote
from Godzilla. A pedestrian who gets eaten is played by David Koepp,
the screenwriter. In another quick shot, we see two posters in a video
store: one for a Robin Williams version of Jack and the Beanstalk (the
last movie from Williams, a friend of Spielberg, was called Jack), and
a Schwarzenegger version of Shakspeare's King Lear.
A friend of mine said that there was too much King Kong/Godzilla going
on at the end, and she's right that it didn't really fit with the rest
of the movie, but it seems to be part of the action genre to throw in a
little tongue-in-cheek humor here and there. Keep that in mind, and you
won't have to roll your eyes at the humor.
It's hard to imagine anyone not knowing what they're getting into when
they go see Lost World. So since you're not expecting artful costumes,
insightful dialog, or careful exploration of themes, I can safely
recommend this movie as another great summer escape.

Title
Review for Horse Whisperer, The (1998)
***1/2 (out of 4) I believe the book was called SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD. In it,
the protagonist was trying to help a mother calm an unruly child whose
father had died. After the usual shushing noises failed to help, the man
simply HELD the squirming child on his lap. When the kid saw he saw he was
trapped, he resorted to wetting his pants, then trying to squirm free. The
man held the child tighter, letting the sour liquid soak his own clothes,
continuing to reassure the child as though nothing had happened. Gradually
the child's squirming turned into hugging, holding tight to the man whose
patience, unconditional love, and permanent presence had won out. 
Patience, love, and persistence are the virtues Tom Booker (Robert Redford)
embodies in THE HORSE WHISPERER. Booker uses these virtues to gentle horses
who have been spooked. They seem to work just as well with people.... 
Grace (played very well by a young Scarlett Johansson) has been betrayed by
the world. 
She and her best friend, riding horses, are involved in a devastating
accident; a truck collides with them, killing her best friend and one of the
horses. Part of Grace's leg has to be amputated. Her horse Pilgrim is so
badly injured that he should be "put down," though her mother Annie (Kristin
Scott Thomas) is too distraught to be able to authorize the horse's euthanasia. 
Grace can't cope with having survived such a terrible accident. Her mother
is concerned but is no real help. Annie wants Grace to get better, but she
doesn't know how to go about it. She gives Grace too much distance for fear
of not giving her enough, and Grace is left to deal with her problems on her
own. 
Grace learns of her horse Pilgrim's condition and insists on seeing him. She
tries to approach him, but he is so spooked that he won't allow even Grace
to approach him. 
Annie contacts Booker, hoping he can come have a look at Pilgrim. In a
somewhat contrived device, Booker refuses an all-expense paid trip to New
York. Annie, in an attempt to compensate for her inability to help Grace,
decides to take time off from work and drive Pilgrim to Montana in the hopes
that Booker will not turn her away. It's the only thing she can think to do,
and she can't stand doing nothing. 
On the way, Grace and Annie fight. Their dialogue is extremely well written
(credit screenwriters Richard LaGravenese [BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, THE
REF] and Eric Roth [FORREST GUMP]). Grace is genuinely angry at her mother
in a nondistinct, frustrated sort of way. Annie means well but it's as if
she's going through the motions of parenting. She's seems afraid to pry,
keeping too much distance from Grace every time they interact. Their fights
are selfish and frustrating and only mildly productive. Both characters are
so well developed (credit both actors) that neither reacts
two-dimensionally. You can see both sides of every argument, without ever
seeing the solution, which really makes you empathize with their situation. 
When they finally get to Montana, Booker's patience, persistence, wisdom,
and charm start working on Pilgrim, on Grace, and on Annie. With Pilgrim,
Booker administers physical therapy. When Pilgrim runs off one day, Booker
spends all afternoon waiting him out. With Grace, Booker gives
responsibility and trust, in exchange for Grace's commitment. With Annie,
Booker gives his attention and affection, not to mention a model for what
good parenting looks like. 
Probably the best thing about THE HORSE WHISPERER is the acting. Redford is
perfect as Tom Booker. His natural charm complements the folk wisdom and
quick wit of his character. Thomas and Johansson are a great pair of actors
who work very well together. Their mother-daughter conflict is as convincing
and natural as their growth and reconciliation. Alone, Thomas gets to show
her impressive range and Johansson proves to be a talented young actor. Even
Sam Neill, in a small role as Grace's father, gives a good performance as
the greenest of newcomers to Montana. 
Redford's direction is impeccable. Patience, love, and persistence help the
injured heal. Those same qualities describe the film itself. The pace is
gradual, but always progressing, keeping in stride with the progress of
Grace and Pilgrim. The accident scene is tightly shot and edited, giving the
whole sequence a severity appropriate to the damage it caused, and
appropriate in its contrast to the rest of the film. It is also likely that
Redford, as director, deserves some credit for coaxing such great
performances from the actors. 
The cinematography is gorgeous, albeit gratuitous. In what my friend Rob
calls "god's-eye view" shots, we see a tiny car and trailer moving through
the winding roads of Wyoming and Montana. The natural isolated location of a
Montana ranch backed by rugged mountains lends itself to beautiful pictures
and solid compositions (did the aspect ratio change when they arrived in
Montana or did my projectionist mess up?). On the other hand, these
great-looking shots don't always feel consistently used within the movie's
structure. They are wonderful to behold, but they are not always
incorporated into the prevailing mood of the storyline. 
And of course the story of healing is very good. Booker's way with people
and horses is at once mesmerizing and unbelievably simple. His story of
patience, love, and simple contact is a nice parable for our time.

Title
Review for Deconstructing Harry (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS ONE OF THOSE WORDS YOU CAN'T
SAY ON RADIO. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
The opening scene of DECONSTRUCTING HARRY shocked me. Richard Benjamin,
looking pretty old, is fucking Julia Louis-Dreyfus, looking way too
young for him. The age difference and the lack of romance in their eyes
made me think she was doing it for money. After all, their M.O. was
definitely giving him more enjoyment than her. 
It also bothered me that the scene was played up for comedy. These two
people are soullessly fucking, hoping they won't be caught by their
spouses, and in walks blind-as-a-bat grandma. What a wacky situation. It
was funny, but not ha-ha funny. 
Turns out Benjamin and Louis-Dreyfus are playing characters, not in this
movie, but in Harry's (Woody Allen's) book. They really are supposed to
be "funny" in a deliberately sick, larger-than-life way. 
Allen's films are notorious autobiographical exaggerations. In
DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, he has subjected his life to another round of
fictional distillation. Harry's characters are interpretations of Harry,
who is an interpretation of Allen. The residue left after all that
filtering is what we see in the first scene. Although it is shocking, it
is deliberate and appropriate. 
If you can appreciate the distillation of three layers of reference and
laugh at the underlying truth, then you will like this movie. If, in
spite of the cleverness, you still think it's a little sick, you may
hate the movie. 
The glue that holds all these characters and meta-characters together is
that Harry is being honored at his alma mater and he wants to find a
friend who will accompany him. This allows him to interact with the
people from his past, most of whom have been portrayed in one of his
stories. Enactments of these stories (like the opening scene) are cut
into the overarching story of Harry's trip back to college. 
After one or two of his ex-wives decline to join him, Harry pays Cookie
(Hazelle Goodman), a prostitute, to accompany him to the ceremony.
Richard (Bob Balaban), another friend decides at the last minute to go
too, and rounding out the fourth passenger in his Volvo is his son (whom
he has to kidnap, since mom won't let him miss school). 
Robert dies on the trip from New York, which is taken in stride. When
they arrive at Harry's college, Richard's body is taken away and before
he can be honored, Harry is arrested for kidnaping and possession
(Cookie left her pot in the back seat). 
Harry is jailed, left to mull over the fact that his only friends are
dead or hired or kidnaped. 
Allen seems to be acknowledging that his life, like Harry's, is full of
bungled relationships and missed opportunities. However, this
acknowledgment is not an apology, nor is it regret, for in the end,
Harry is able to justify his life through the art and the characters
that he has created. 
Had he been better at relationships, he reasons, his books would have
been worth less than this review. Instead, he decides to accept that
he's an asshole, and enjoy his fame and success as a writer. 
The ultimate point of DECONSTRUCTING HARRY is that, for artists, life is
hell. If it weren't, they wouldn't have any motivation to create beauty.
Happy people just don't make great artists, and great artists are not
happy people. 
I find this message quite depressing, but I can't say I disagree. I
dipped my toes into the cold water of filmmaking, and decided instead to
sit by the pool. I look at the swimmers with envy, and yet I can't
really say I'd like to trade places. Like it or not, I have chosen warm
and stable security over fame and big success. I wish I could have it
both ways. In DECONSTRUCTING HARRY, Allen corroborates my fears that
it's not possible. 
Technically, this is a very good film. Allen's long-time editor Susan
Morse took some risks that really paid off. The movie is full of jump
cuts that not only effectively tighten up some scenes, but also add an
appropriate sense of confusion. Often when Harry is looking for the
right words, Morse uses a series of short cuts that give the movie the
same frustrated manner that Harry has. 
The inserted story segments have the fresh hooks and quick morals of
good short fiction (like the actor who literally loses his focus, or the
man who changes his identity to cheat on his wife, only to find that
Death has come for this alter-ego.) 
Allen's filmmaking tone is a little more raw than usual, if that's
possible. For example, his lead character talks more about "fucking" and
less about sex, relationships, and lovemaking. But his unique sense of
neurotic humor is still evident. 
Did I like this movie? No. I hated it. First it repulsed me and then it
depressed me. 
Was it any good? Yes. By distilling his own life to a smelly,
concentrated sludge, Allen really did hit on some human truths. In
addition, the lucid, careful control of three layers of reality shows
that, as a filmmaker, Allen is very good. 
As for a recommendation, I could go either way.

Title
Review for Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)
*** (out of 4) GROSSE POINTE BLANK is a concept-driven movie with just a
single gimmick: that hired killers are "normal" people outside of work.
Surprisingly, it works well.
John Cusack plays Martin Q. Blank, a professional killer. He is very
businesslike: he has clients, agreements, a secretary, appointments,
expenses, and a therapist. If one didn't know that his specialty was
murder, he could be a real estate agent.
Lately, his work has been getting him down, so his secretary (Joan
Cusack, John's sister) suggests that he attend his 10-year high school
reunion. He eventually agrees to go back home for the weekend and see
all the old faces. He hopes to see one face in particular.
Ten years ago, Martin stood up Debi (Minnie Driver) on prom night. He's
been thinking about her all these years and hopes to make amends with
her. He's even willing to give up his career for her, if she'll let him.
He finds her working at the local radio station, single, and willing to
talk . . . .
With this type of concept movie, the screenwriter(s) must be careful not
to tell the same joke too many times. Many of the jokes are Martin
talking about the pressures of his job like everyone else does, but the
screenwriters (Tom Jankiewicz, D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, and John
Cusack) keep the jokes fresh and funny.
It is inspired comedy to make Martin a hired killer. I was reminded of a
comedy called THE DREAM TEAM, about a group of inmates from a mental
institution. That movie was funny, but some critics thought it unfairly
stereotyped mental patients. It was the wrong group to portray, so they
said. By making Martin an assassin, the movie can take all sorts of
liberties with Martin's profession without worrying about offending the
assassins of the world. And also, it's a funny idea.
As a counterexample, there is a therapist in this movie, lightly played
by Alan Arkin. There are some jokes involving psychobabble between
therapist and patient. Though better than usual (compare THAT OLD
FEELING, for example), these jokes border on condescending. In order for
the therapist's dialog to be funny, he has to be a caricature, a
stereotype. Nobody complains about the stereotype when the character is
a professional killer.
In spite of having a little too much screen time, Arkin was funny as the
therapist. Both Cusacks were good in their roles. Dan Aykroyd was funny,
if unmemorable. Minnie Driver was okay as Debi, but her role was a
little shallow.
Debi serves as the object of another character's desire. In Chasing Amy,
the female lead had an identity of her own. She wasn't just "the love
interest." In GROSSE POINTE BLANK, Debi is just the love interest. She
is a little more fun than most, but she's still mostly an object.
The movie's worst flaw is its ending -- not the outcome of events, but
the specific events that take place. Throughout the rest of the movie,
Martin, though an assassin, is not very bloody or violent. Near the end
there are two episodes of bloody violence. The first episode is treated
as black comedy, and it SORT OF fits into the movie. But the last
episode introduces a level of serious violence that not only doesn't fit
with the rest of the movie, it detracts from it.
If I hadn't liked this movie, I would have said that it was just an
excuse for an 80s soundtrack, (which it was). But the movie was more
than just a soundtrack, and it was quite entertaining. It's a bit of
fluff, but it's a lot of fun.

Title
Review for Tarzan (1999)
** (out of 4) I went to TARZAN hoping to hate it. I am generally cynical
about Disney movies, and I hoped I could pull a "Mr. Cranky."
I still won't say I liked TARZAN, but I liked parts of it, and on the
whole I couldn't really fault it, given the genre. But it never wowed me
and won me over. I never felt sheepish for having doubted Disney, as I
did with A BUG'S LIFE.
Plotwise, TARZAN is a fairly traditional retelling. A shipwrecked couple
are killed and their infant son is adopted by gorillas. The boy grows up
never knowing why he looks different from his friends, never knowing
about human beings.
One day, after Tarzan (voiced by Tony Goldwyn) has grown, he hears a
loud bang in the distance. It is a party of people. A ridiculous-looking
naturalist (Nigel Hawthorne), his daughter Jane (Minnie Driver), and
their trophy-hunting bodyguard Clayton (Brian Blessed) are looking for
gorillas.  
After their first encounter, Tarzan and Jane start hanging around
together (ouch, sorry). Meanwhile, the goofy professor Porter and the
slippery villain try to get Tarzan to say where the gorilla nesting site
is, the prof so he can study them, the bodyguard so he can cage them and
sell them.
As with other recent Disney cartoons, this one is a musical. Phil
Collins belts out the pop hits over montages of Tarzan "skating" down
tree branches. (The music is always over a montage because the cast
members don't perform their own songs. For example, Tarzan's "mother"
starts the first few bars of a lullaby, then Collins takes over the
soundtrack and the visuals shift into MTV mode.) None of the songs are
too saccharine, and there's even one that's fairly catchy -- "Trashing
the Camp."
Another trademark of Disney cartoons is that they always manage to top
themselves when it comes to technical innovation. First it was the
spinning ballroom shot in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Then it was the focus
pulls on THE LION KING. In TARZAN, the trick is "hand-held" camera.
Early in the film a leopard is chasing Tarzan's adoptive mother. The
scene happens very quickly anyway, and the "camera" hops around trying
to follow the action as though the virtual camera operator had legs.
(The same technique is repeated later in the movie.) So why create this
effect? Because they can? Because it hasn't been done before? To get
film nerds like me to say "whoa"? Whatever the reason, it's a neat
gimmick, even if it's gratuitous.
That brings me to a fairly big complaint about the movie. Because of the
animators' acute technophilia, TARZAN is stylistically incoherent.
Technical innovation may be neat, but that alone shouldn't be reason
enough to include it in a movie.
The characters in TARZAN are all traditional-looking animated creatures.
They could have been drawn for THE JUNGLE BOOK forty years ago. But the
setting they inhabit has become hyperrealistic. With computer-modeled
jungles, rivers, sunlight and shadows, it has become hard to tell for
sure where the cartoon ends and "reality" begins -- until you change
your focus to the cartoon apes in the foreground.
This inconsistency is a stylistic mistake. It keeps the audience from
understanding and getting into the animated world. The characters and
settings ARE animated separately, but they shouldn't look that way. Even
assuming there were a good reason to mix two such disparate styles,
Professor Porter's character introduces a third style that's even
further out of place.
Set in the "real" jungle, Tarzan was animated with sharp, heroic lines,
as was Jane. Clayton's figure was a bit more exaggerated, but as the
villain, it was excusable. But professor Porter's form was neither
realistic nor heroic. He was so flat, round, silly, and, well,
cartoonish, that he would have fit in better with Mickey Mouse and
Donald Duck. Each style might work on its own, but to ignore how they
integrate is a mistake.
I have one more complaint, and to discuss it, I'll have to give away the
ending. (That's okay, though. If you're familiar with the Disney
formula, you already know what the ending is.) 
The kid-movie justice system is insane.
My sister said it best: her daughter was telling her about a movie that
had a happy ending because the bad guy died at the end. Later, to me, my
sister was incredulous. "It's a HAPPY ending because someone you don't
like is DEAD? What kind of message is that?"
Having observed this childish system of justice in movies ranging from
TARZAN and A BUG'S LIFE (rated G) to CON AIR and THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE
CRADLE (rated R), I've discovered a few other "rules." The good guys
never do their own dirty work. The bad guy always dies because of his
fatal flaw, usually greed, rabid perseverence, and/or pure, inhuman
evilness. The more gruesome, sudden, and irreversible the death, the
better. The Greeks had DEUS EX MACHINA endings. We have MORTIS EX
FORMULA endings.
Ideally, we'd be teaching our kids to outwit their oppressors, not to
hope for luck to bring their deaths. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen
very often in movies. (A noteworthy exception is last year's "Ever
After," which I strongly recommend.) No wonder we are a nation in love
with the death penalty, where bad guys die without the rest of us
getting blood on our hands.
Back to TARZAN, I'm probably being too hard on this movie, when my real
complaint is with the formula. Still, I wouldn't say I liked it, and I'd
even go so far as to say that it doesn't quite measure up to other
Disney offerings. I'm sure those of you with younger kids would enjoy an
afternoon at TARZAN. But the rest of us could probably skip it.

Review for Wings of the Dove, The (1997)
*** (out of 4) Sometimes I find 19th century British costume dramas a
little hard to relate to. It's not the time or the distance, it's the
rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather
than sympathy. Yet somehow, the movies are all well made and I always
get caught up in the story. 
THE WINGS OF THE DOVE fits the pattern. 
Kate (Helena Bonham Carter) and Merton (Linus Roache) are in love.
Merton, a newspaper writer, would like to marry Kate. But Kate's "job",
if you will, is to be a member of the British upper class. Her father
lost all of her family's money, but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care
of her until she married a nice rich man. Naturally, a newspaper
writer's wages don't count as "rich." 
Kate leads him on, but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder,
ultimately because he's not marriageable. 
Kate's American friend Millie (Alison Elliot) stops in for a visit on
her way to Venice. At a party, Millie catches a glimpse of Merton and
likes what she sees. Kate realizes that if Merton were introduced to
Millie, he might forget about her. It appears that she is trying to
spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup. Merton sees
what Kate is doing and resents her for it. He is still in love with
Kate, and will accept no substitute. 
The three of them, along with a fourth friend (Elizabeth McGovern) end
up on holiday in Venice together, where their interactions are quite
complicated. Let's sum up: Millie has fallen for Merton. Merton has no
feelings for Millie because he is still in love with Kate. Kate loves
him but can't marry him, so on the one hand she's trying to match him up
with someone who will make him happy, but on the other hand she's
jealous of them as a couple. 
A clear solution presents itself to Kate when she realizes that Millie
is very sick - dying, in fact. At this point she decides that Merton
should marry Millie until she dies. Millie will leave her money to
Merton, who will then be rich enough to marry Kate. She lets Merton know
of her schemes and, since it will help him win Kate, he reluctantly
agrees. 
Kate leaves Venice so that the two M's can be alone together. Merton
finds that pretending to love Millie is a lot like actually loving her.
He's not sure he can separate the two. Kate finds that she's not so sure
she really wants her Merton falling in love with and marrying anyone
else. The brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved. Without
revealing the details, suffice it to say that the situation ends badly.
The title refers to the object of Merton's vain hope that something
might lift him from his predicament. 
One is left with feelings of regret and despair. What started as such a
promising relationship was damaged by greed, anger, and jealousy. An
interesting thought struck me after the movie was over, and that is that
THE WINGS OF THE DOVE almost fits the story line of a film noir. A
Couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live
happily ever after. Their involvement in the deception makes each less
attractive to the other, and after a few things go wrong, the whole idea
seems like an awful life-ruining mistake. I wouldn't call THE WINGS OF
THE DOVE a film noir, but the comparison is interesting. 
As I have acknowledged before, I am not a wonderful judge of acting, but
I liked the performances from Roache and Elliot. Roache successfully
conveyed his character's ambivalence toward Millie: near the end, he
hugs her, at first staring into space, as if he's thinking about his
plan with Kate, then giving that up to fully embrace Millie. Millie's
part didn't require as much range, but Elliot gave her the necessary
bubbly personality that made her irresistible. 
I will probably file away THE WINGS OF THE DOVE in the same low-traffic
corner of my mind as SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and PERSUASION. Their
settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically,
historically, and socially. Still, the movies are well made and the
stories inevitably win me over.

Title
Review for Magnolia (1999)
***1/2 (out of 4) MAGNOLIA is a masterpiece of structure. Some parts are
imperfect, some of the seams are  badly stitched, but the finished piece
is a work of art.
MAGNOLIA is ambitious. Ten characters share center stage, and some of
them never meet. But by carefully following the chain, you can get from
one to the next. Anderson's great script and Dylan Tichenor's editing
gives each character the right amount of time. The ensemble acting is
superb.
One story is Frank T.J. Mackey's. Mackey (Tom Cruise) runs seminars for
men called "Seduce and Destroy." He teaches men how to take what they
want from women. He's a real jerk and Cruise gives him believable
dimension. During the seminar's lunch break he gives an interview to
Guinivere (**), who catches him off guard by asking penetrating
questions about the "real" Frank Mackey. He returns to the afternoon
session worked up by his frustrating interview.
Another story is Jim Kurring's. Kurring (James C. Reilly) is a lonely
cop. He talks to himself in his patrol car with the flat philosophical
patter you'd expect to hear on COPS. His day gets more interesting when
he responds to a disturbance at Claudia's (Melora Walters) apartment. At
first sight, he decides he likes this girl, and she seems to like him
too. As he tries to start the relationship, his nervous tension builds
Jimmy Gator is a quiz show host. Now cancer is forcing him to retire. A
combination of alcohol and pain cause his last live performance to go
very badly. Also the whiz-kid contestant (Jeremy Blackman) refuses to
play the final round, stressing him even more.
Most of the other characters have similarly bad days. Halfway through, a
title card appears that says "99% humidity." In other words, something's
got to give, something has to burst.
Anderson keeps the pressure building throughout the movie. For one
thing, the music on the soundtrack is relentless. There is never a
moment of silence, there is always a song or music playing over the
action.
Also, the editing keeps the film moving. The characters are introduced
at a whirlwind pace, and except for a few long stops at Earl Partridge's
(Jason Robards') house, the characters' stories are intercut briskly.
There are a few basic problems with the movie that took me by surprise.
For example, when Tom Cruise leans forward or backward in his key scene,
the focus doesn't follow him perfectly. In film school, that kind of
carelessness would get your movie rejected.  
Also, some of the mid-level editing seemed off, like the too-long scenes
of Partridge and his nurse Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman), or like the
too-intense showdown between Donnie (William H. Macy) and his boss
(Alfred Molina).
And yet, none of these potential problems are critical. They give the
movie a unique texture, like bubbles in blown glass. Somehow they were
simply not important enough to worry about, either for Anderson or for
his audience.
The artist's technique isn't quite polished enough for him to be a
master craftsman, but it doesn't matter because he has created a unique
work of art.

Title
Review for American History X (1998)
***1/2 (out of 4) There is nothing like AMERICAN HISTORY X in theaters
or on video. No other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the
lure, the culture, and the brotherhood of white supremacy.
Nice guy Ed Norton Jr. (who sang in EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU) plays
Derek, a twenty-year old skinhead. Dad's subtle racism grew large in
Derek, after gang members killed his father. Dad was fighting a fire
when they shot him. Now Derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant
swastika tattooed over his heart.
Derek is more interested in the IDEAS of white supremacy than in its
culture of violence. At a basketball court, black and white tempers
flare. Derek channels the aggression into a game, black versus white,
for ownership of the courts. When the choice presents itself, Derek goes
for game point instead of the sucker-punch. 
Cameron (Stacy Keach) steps in to Derek's life as a surrogate father. He
takes Derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings. Keeping his
own criminal record spotless, he uses Derek as a leader and organizer
for high-visibility racial intimidation. Derek obliges by leading his
younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes. At the bottom
of the chain, Derek's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong, made famous
in TERMINATOR 2) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual
reasons, but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong.
One night three black youths break into Derek's truck, which is exactly
what Derek has been waiting for. Outside in his shorts and his tattoo,
he shoots them all. The third would-be thief, unarmed, is only wounded.
In the key scene of the film, Derek commands the kid into a position
where he can be killed with one glorious, enraptured, awful stomp. (The
fun-spoiling NC-17 of ORGAZMO seems even more inappropriate, considering
AMERICAN HISTORY X was rated R. What sort of country is this that says
sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal, ecstatic
violence?)
The police arrive just as Derek kills the last thief. Derek does not
resist the cops, and as they spin him around to cuff him, the film slows
down. Derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a
chilling, sadistic, satisfied grin.
Now in prison, Derek faces new challenges. As the black man in the
laundry tells him, "in the joint, you the nigra, not me." There is a
clique of swastika-wearing skinheads, but they are not interested in the
ideology of white supremacy. They only use the symbols as a means of
intimidation. Derek finds himself truly alone, truly in danger, and
truly afraid.
When Derek finally gets out of prison, he finds that his friends from
the gang have also changed. Without Derek's leadership, they have
shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist
culture. It is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he's
screwed up. In the end, he spends quality time with is brother trying to
undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in Danny.
The film ends a little too deliberately, too neatly after the unchained
emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film, but it barely detracts
from the overall experience.
Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Although some of his
dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction, Norton's
performance compensated. (An example that comes to mind is his pep talk
before looting the store.) He also captured the essence of an older
brother. He took his responsibility as a role model to his younger
brother very seriously, very lovingly, both before and after his change
of heart.
Though clearly not for all tastes, this film is bold and daring. The
subject matter is ugly, cruel, and at times hard to look at.
Nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity's great face. Kaye gives
us a good look at this fascinating, if distasteful, American subculture.

Title
Review for Conspiracy Theory (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) The problem with a movie titled CONSPIRACY THEORY is
that if you take it too seriously, the whole movie becomes a joke (like
JFK, to some extent). Don't take it seriously enough, and your action
movie becomes a farce. Richard Donner (who directed Mel Gibson in the
LETHAL WEAPONs and MAVERICK) found the right balance. 
Gibson plays Jerry Fletcher, a cabbie who talks the ears off his
passengers about all sorts of conspiracies, including black helicopters,
manufactured earthquakes, and Roswell, NM. I say that Donner found the
right balance because the opening sequence shows that Jerry is a nut.
He's not mean or angry, just hot for conspiracies. The important thing
is that the movie doesn't take him too seriously or too threateningly so
he can be our sympathetic hero. 
Still, Donner went too far in exposing us to Mel's character. By the
time we see the tapioca in the locked container inside the padlocked
fridge, we say "duh; we got it." 
Soon, though, we see that Jerry is right to be paranoid. He is put
through a CLOCKWORK ORANGE-type of treatment at the hands of a
diabolical Dr. Jonas (Patrick Stewart). At this point, we've already
accepted the movie's setup, so the problem here is no longer
plausibility, but emotional direction. 
As Jerry tries to escape, tense serious music plays, indicating the tone
for the scene. But visually, the scene is pure slapstick: Mel Gibson is
strapped to an old wooden wheelchair, eyelids taped open, moving as fast
as he can (not very fast), wildly waddling his feet to roll the chair,
while the incompetent bad guys slip and slide and never quite catch up.
It's the Keystone Kops on acid and, with a little circus music, would be
a great bit of comedy. But the music tells us it's not funny, so someone
somewhere didn't do their job - either composer Carter Burwell or
Donner. 
Julia Roberts is worked into the movie as Alice Sutton, the object of
Jerry's obsession. When Jerry is able to prove to her he's right about
one conspiracy (none of the big ones, though), she teams up with him out
of pity, curiosity, and professional duty (she's a public defender[?]). 
The movie really hums along for a while when Jerry and Alice both flee
and pursue the mysterious "them," but that pace doesn't last. Too soon,
the movie bogs down in details, and for the last hour, we keep waiting
for the pace to pick up like it did in the middle act. The movie was
probably 30 to 40 minutes too long. 
By now, there have been many other reviews of CONSPIRACY THEORY, and
they are mostly unfavorable. For the most part, they are right, but they
are probably too harsh. CONSPIRACY THEORY does have its moments. But you
may have to sift to find them.

Title
Review for American Psycho (2000)
***1/2 (out of 4) Greed, superficiality, and selfishness. These are the
traits we associate with the 1980s. Whether or not that's a fair
assessment, that's how the 80s are portrayed in AMERICAN PSYCHO.
This is not a horror film. It doesn't aim to frighten or gross out its
audiences. Instead, AMERICAN PSYCHO is a social satire, a character
study, and a dark comedy. 
Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is the quintessential yuppie. He's
rich, good-looking, has great taste. He's also shallow, and proud of it.
At one point he even says that there is no inside, that only the outside
matters.
Bateman is vain. Take his morning grooming routine: first he uses the
cold pack in case his eyes are puffy; then he does his stomach crunches
-- he can do a thousand; then he takes a shower, making sure to use the
half-dozen different cleansers and moisturizers; and finally, he applies
a cleansing facial mask that he puts on and peels off every morning.
Status is also important to him. After work, he hangs out with the other
vice presidents, posturing and playing social chess. For example,
deciding where to have dinner involves a competitive ritual where the
object is to suggest the most expensive and prestigious place you can,
while still being able to get reservations. If your suggestion is too
cheap or if you can't get reservations, you lose face among the other
alpha males. When this competitive group decides to compare business
cards, you can almost smell the testosterone.
Bateman can play social chess, but he's not the best at it, and it
leaves him nervous and insecure. He discovers that he can parlay that
insecurity into power by taking a human life. After just one murder,
he's addicted.
Bale portrays Bateman very well. He captures both the dashing confidence
of Bateman's outer self and the nervous insecurity of the inner man. The
wheels of Bateman's mind always seem to be turning, whether he's
checking himself in the mirror or feeling stress about being found out.
The production design is also very good. Gideon Ponte recreates the look
and feel of the 1980s throughout the movie. Food, clothes, furnishings,
even early-model cell phones, all have the aura of excess and indulgence
about them that is called for in this movie. 
What's best about the movie is the density of its satire. Its wry social
commentary permeates every aspect of the filmmaking. Its condemnation of
the 80s is well thought out and thematically coherent.

Title
Review for Rainmaker, The (1997)
*** (out of 4) You never know what to expect from Coppola: sometimes you
get a great film and sometimes you get JACK. THE RAINMAKER is an
above-average courtroom drama. It is a good, solid, well-made movie.
It's no classic, but it's worth seeing. 
This is the sixth big-screen adaptation of a John Grisham novel. In this
outing, the young Memphis lawyer is Rudy Baylor, played by Matt Damon.
Rudy is just out of law school and looking for work. He finds it in the
shady law office of "Bruiser" Stone (that's Mickey Rourke, believe it or
not) who's under investigation by the FBI. 
Bruiser agrees to hire Rudy on the condition that he recruit his own
clients. Rudy just happens to have two cases that he landed from a
school open-house event. One of the cases turns out to be big; a
leukemia patient, Donnie Ray Black (Johnnie Whitworth) and his mother
file a lawsuit against a crooked insurance company for denying their
legitimate claim. 
One night Rudy and his legal assistant Deck Shiffler (Danny DeVito)
discuss their future with Bruiser's law firm. They decide that the FBI
is getting too serious and that the heat will be too great at Bruiser's
offices, so they take their cases and leave the firm, just in the nick
of time. Now on their own, they bring Great Benefit Insurance and its
five lawyers to court. In the outstanding performance of the movie, Jon
Voight is Leo Drummond, the high-paid, slick, confident power lawyer of
the defense team. Coppola gave Drummond enough smarts and clout to match
Voight's performance. The role could have easily been under-written and
over-played, but the actor and the role were tailored to suit each
other. 
Most of the movie follows the specifics of the court case from beginning
to end, and that in itself is an interesting twist. Seems like most
so-called courtroom dramas dedicate lots of screen time to the crime and
the out-of-court implications; then they end with a big climax in the
courtroom. THE RAINMAKER actually follows the courtroom story for most
of the movie. 
But there are subplots. In an inept attempt at ambulance-chasing, Rudy
meets and falls for Kelly Riker (the sweet, likeable Claire Danes) who
is the victim of spousal abuse. Another subplot involves Rudy's other
case, an old woman, his landlord (Teresa Wright), who wants to rewrite
her will to exclude family and include a Texas televangelist. 
These subplots really were subservient to the main story line. Though
they were interwoven, they existed separately. They never really touched
on the main plot. They added a nice texture to the movie, but I often
felt the cross-cutting was labored and unmotivated. 
Also, I question the intent of making Kelly the victim of abuse. The way
the movie dealt with her husband was to violently hate him, much the
same way the movie made you feel about the insurance company. All of
Rudy's dialogue regarding Kelly's husband is talk of murderous revenge.
I suppose in that way, this movie is similar toSTARSHIP TROOPERS, which
takes pleasure in the extermination of its villains. But where the
hatred in STARSHIP TROOPERS was ironic and distanced, in THE RAINMAKER
it is "righteous." I think that's probably worse for society. (Is this a
trend in movies of the late nineties - to make the audience feel good
about killing? Are they sating our demand for public executions?) 
Still, these scenes didn't detract from the experience; they played a
small enough part, and they fit in with the movie's overall feel. 
If there was anything that was wrong with THE RAINMAKER, it was that the
movie's conflict was too easy. The insurance company was too cruel and
the victims too sympathetic for there to be any question of the outcome.
The movie left no room for any real debate on health care, insurance, or
tort reform. For example, a memo from the insurance company was written
by an employee having a bad day. The letter calls the claimant "stupid,
stupid, stupid." If that weren't enough, the letter is read aloud about
four times in the movie, and at one point, it fills the movie screen. 
That's not to say that the movie wasn't satisfying - what could be more
satisfying than the defeat of a melodramatic villain? But it means you
won't want to see the movie more than once, and you probably won't
remember it in five years. 
But for here and now, it's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.
It's a solid, well-made courtroom drama that actually spends a lot of
time in court.

Title
Review for Three Kings (1999)
*** (out of 4) David O. Russell uses the Gulf War as a backdrop for his
ironic, thoughtful film about war, freedom, and greed.
The three title characters (plus a fourth), all U.S. army, find a map to
Kuwaiti gold in a dead Iraqi soldier at the end of the war. Major Archie
Gates (George Clooney) leads his small team on an expedition to find the
gold. The map takes them into the heart of Iraq, where they finally meet
people who aren't soldiers. Some are villagers, some are police, and
some are resistance fighters, and each group has a different take on
America.
The civilians are inclined to greet the Americans as heroes. The
villagers believed the political promises of President Bush, and are
expecting to be governed justly by the occupying force. Archie doesn't
know how -- or whether -- to break the bad news to them, that there is
no occupying force and that Bush could not care less about the
oppression of Iraqi peasants.
They get a strange reaction from the police force, which is an internal
branch of Saddam Hussein's army. Archie is savvy enough to predict that
the police will ignore the Americans and go about their business of
repressing the civilians. Though the G.I.s (Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and
Spike Jonze) fear for their lives when the Iraqis show up with guns,
their commander turns out to be right -- the police ignore them.
Greed tells the Americans to be grateful for this strange behavior. Now
they can grab the gold and leave. But their curiosity, valor, and
outrage are also stimulated. Should they take the money and run?
Shouldn't they protect the civilians? Should they attack the police? If
they intervene, are they creating more war?
The plot contrives to bring the Americans through several war movie
vignettes -- the resistance fighters, capture and torture, a
resettlement camp -- and Russell brings irony and social commentary into
each one.
For example, one of the Americans is tortured by an Iraqi soldier who
rips on the social bankruptcy of American culture. He forces his
American prisoner to drink crude oil by cramming a compact disc into his
mouth as a makeshift funnel. Oil -- the stuff America was fighting for
-- becomes something to be reviled. And a compact disc -- a symbol of
the high technology good life -- becomes complicit in the torture of an
American. (The irony goes deeper when you remember that the American is
played by former recording artist Marky Mark [Wahlberg]).
One could make the case that Russell has put in too many metaphors, or
too much irony. You could say that this movie's message is heavy-handed.
On the other hand, I'm more inclined to hate a movie that DOESN'T
capitalize on the chance to make a statement, that's all plot and no
meaning. So on the whole, I'd prefer Russell's approach.
Along with the thoughtful commentary, Russell provides a uniquely
appropriate look. The film seems overexposed and bleached. The only
colors are desert yellow and anemic sky blue. The cinematography feels
dazedly sunstroked, giving the movie's irony an almost surreal logic. 
THREE KINGS sounds like a great movie, and indeed many critics call it
one of the year's best. But somehow, as soon as the credits rolled, the
whole experience evaporated. By the time I hit the parking lot the film
and its impact might as well have been mirages.

Title
Review for Titanic (1997)
***1/2 (out of 4) Modern-day treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton)
hears the story of one survivor from the sinking of the Titanic. When
her story is done, Brock says that even though he's been working on the
Titanic for 3 years, he never got it. Until he heard her story, he never
saw past the wreckage on the bottom of the Atlantic. 
The same might be said of the audience after seeing the movie. Without a
good story, the sinking of the Titanic could have been just another
special effects movie, more interested in the ship itself than on how it
affected lives. Instead, Cameron made the Titanic the BACKGROUND for his
story. 
Titanic is great. The melodramatic love story is the perfect foreground
for the sinking of the largest passenger ship in history. The film is a
technical marvel, and even without the spectacular sinking, the story is
engaging. 
The melodrama involves Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor boy who wins a
ticket to America on the Titanic in a poker game, and Rose (Kate
Winslet), a young socialite who is traveling to America for her wedding
to Cal. Though Rose doesn't love Cal, she must marry him because she and
her mother are penniless, unbeknownst to the rest of high society. 
Jack falls for Rose as soon as he sees her and is determined to win her
in spite of the class barrier. Rose doesn't even know Jack exists until
he comes along as she contemplates throwing herself into the Atlantic.
Not only does he talk her down from the ledge, but when her handlers
suddenly arrive and assume the worst of Jack, he keeps his mouth shut,
protecting her. 
The two fall deeply in love and talk of how they might escape together
when the ship lands. If this were any other ship, the conflict of two
lovers fighting class barriers would have been interesting enough to
make a movie. Instead, their relationship faces an even bigger conflict
. . . . 
There is a love scene in the movie that, for me, is one of the best in
quite a while. The two lovers don't have sex, or even touch. Rose knows
that Jack is an artist, so she insists that he sketch her in the nude.
Both are just shy enough and just eager enough to make the amorous
tension wonderful. 
DiCaprio is great in the male lead role. Ever since his astonishing
debut in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, his presence brings high
expectations. Not all of his films have been great (THE BASKETBALL
DIARIES,for example) but he shines in TITANIC. His character loves life,
and DiCaprio "lets his heart soar," as Cameron aptly put it. 
Kathy Bates was good in a small, sympathetic role: the unsinkable Molly
Brown. In Jack and Rose's story, Molly was a bridge between their social
classes. She had new money but started out poor, so she was interested
in seeing Jack succeed among the upper crust. 
The biggest flaw for me is the inexcusable 2-dimensionality of the
movie's "villain," Cal (Billy Zane). I have already called the story a
melodrama, and in melodramas, the villains are made of evil. But when
Cal had already lost the girl, and a chance for redemption presented
itself, he continued to be a prick. 
The special effects of the launching and the sinking of Titanic are
fascinating. Roger Ebert even called them seamless, but he was wrong.
Some scenes are clearly made of computerized cartoons and composites.
For example, when the ship launches and the camera flys overhead, some
of the figures on deck move very artificially. These effects may be more
elaborately made than ever before, but they are still not seamless. 
No amount of computer animation can yet pass for reality, which is
probably why Cameron chose to build a huge set that could actually sink.
The investment was worthwhile, for if the entire sinking only happened
on a computer, the effect would not have worked. The reality of the wood
and metal and water needed to be felt and seen. (See the last plane
crash in AIR FORCE ONE for a "realistic" cartoon that just isn't real
enough.) 
Because everyone knows the fate of the Titanic, Cameron (who also wrote
the script) included some ironic foreshadowing. There's almost too much
and it distracts in parts. Nevertheless, I found myself rooting for the
lovers to make it in America, in spite of their certain fate. 
And because the previews tell you where the lovers are when the ship
goes down, one would expect a predictable ending. But one doesn't need
surprise to create tension, as Cameron deftly showed. The slow march of
floodwaters, the violent cracking of a doomed ship, and the
unpredictable human response to certain death add to an incredibly
tense, emotionally draining experience. 
In fact, some might say that there is no best "part" of the movie; that
the best thing about it is the entire experience, the spectacle of it
all. The daunting length and melodramatics of the movie ask a lot from
audiences, but that contributes to the sense of TITANIC being more an
event than a movie. Also, the sheer size, not just of the subject
matter, but of the length, the cast and the cost of the film makes it a
once-in-five-years movie.

Review for Deep Blue Sea (1999)
*** (out of 4) "DEEP BLUE SEA is a shark movie with teeth!"
Yes, I'm trying to be quoted in ad copy. It's every unpaid critics'
dream.
DEEP BLUE SEA is a horror movie. It's not a thriller. It's not an action
movie. It's a horror movie, and it is a very good one. The film itself
has some bad writing and some terrible exposition-after the first ten
minutes of wooden speeches and clichéd setups, I was ready to give up on
it. But before long, the movie bares its teeth, bites down, and doesn't
let go.  
Russell Franklin ( Samuel L. Jackson) is the head of a big corporation
about to cut funding to a shark research facility, where the scientists
hope to find a cure for Alzheimer's. A plucky young scientist, Dr.
McAlester (Saffron Burrows), convinces him to visit the facility one
weekend in hopes he'll see the good work they're doing, and extend their
grant.
They've been experimenting with sharks in their gigantic, mid-ocean,
floating laboratory (complete with underwater pen). The scientists have
been tampering with the sharks' brains-trying to make them bigger so
they can extract more of the stuff that will make their Alzheimer's
drug.
The first night of Russell's visit, a big storm rolls in and the
facility is hit hard. At the same time, the brainy sharks start acting
up. One of the sedated specimens wakes up too soon and severely wounds
one of the 10-man crew. As the crew tries to get a rescue chopper for
the wounded scientist, the sharks start attacking the facility with
deliberate intent-seems their new brains are making them smarter.
Between the storm and the sharks, the small crew becomes trapped. 
Now damaged, the facility becomes a cage for the humans as well. The
sharks continue to attack the facility and its crew as the "floating
Alcatraz" starts to sink. The survivors must figure out a way to stay
afloat while avoiding the omnipresent supersharks.
Despite some clunky writing and lame exposition, DEEP BLUE SEA is a
satisfying horror movie. It has what horror movies have lost, namely,
RUTHLESSNESS.
It seems like a lot of extras die and a lot of main characters survive
in horror movies. It gets to be where you can predict who's going to
live and who's going to die, and in what order.
Sometimes the formula contains a "morality" indicator as well, that
kills off whoever "deserves" to die. Paul Rieser's slick, greedy
character in ALIENS is an obvious example. Or if you prefer slasher
flicks, you could predict a kill if the victim was 1) a teenager at
summer camp, and 2) about to have sex.
DEEP BLUE SEA shuns all of that in favor of sheer ruthless terror. I
knew, as soon as I saw somebody's loveable pet get swallowed whole, that
there was no telling who would live by who "deserved" it. It used to be
the rule that the loyal dog always had to survive, but no more.
And that, in essence, is what makes DEEP BLUE SEA a good horror movie.
It is scary, ruthless, and unpredictable. If that doesn't impress you,
then don't go see it because the bad writing will stand out even more.
Those of us who enjoy a good scare will have fun without you.

Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
***1/2 (out of 4) There are six main characters and another half-dozen
smaller parts in AMERICAN BEAUTY. All of them are well written and well
acted. Best of all, and most impressive for a mere movie, is that all
the characters grow and change in search of the niche that suits them.
On the surface they seem exaggerated, quirky, and sometimes a little
warped and sinister. But look closer and you'll see they are all within
the realm of credibility, and much more normal than they first appeared.
Their stage is a generic American neighborhood. 
Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) anchors the film. He says his wife is
oblivious to him, and when he tries to talk to his teenaged daughter, he
fails to communicate. He hates his dead-end job and wonders what
happened to the days when the family was happy. Spacey is excellent at
conveying the detached, sarcastic, bemused frustration at the turns his
life is taking.
Two events quickly turn Lester's life around. At a high school
basketball halftime show, a cheerleader friend of his daughter makes eye
contact with him, which sends him into a rose-petaled sexual fantasy
where she is dancing just for him.
Another night, he goes with his wife to a fancy party for her real
estate friends. A young waiter spots Lester getting drunk alone, and
asks if he would like some pot. Why not, he figures, and the two go out
back to smoke a joint. The boss finds the kid outside and orders him
back to work, so the kid quits, just like that. Lester says "I think you
just became my personal hero."
Lester becomes enthralled with this adolescent life of pretty
cheerleaders, smooth dope, and a to-hell-with-work attitude. He
completely regresses, leaving his career, getting a part-time job
flipping burgers, and buying the car he always wanted in high school. He
even starts working out in hopes that he'll impress the cheerleader,
maybe to start a little something on the side with her.
Each of the other characters is affected by Lester and his change in
lifestyle.
Lester's wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is one of the less sympathetic
characters in AMERICAN BEAUTY, in part because Lester, the central
figure, sees her as cold and selfish. She comes across as screechy and
closed-minded, but her character is still solidly written and acted.
Looking at the events from her point of view, her actions and emotions
are completely justified. From her perspective, she is a normal person
trapped in a family that has gone completely crazy.
The cheerleader is Angela (Mena Suvari), who looks very young, about 15.
(Her age gives Lester's earnest infatuation a creepy tone of lechery,
that somehow fits in with the movie's beauty-in-sickness themes.) Angela
is technically friends with Lester's daughter Jane (Thora Birch),
although the two have very little in common. Angela likes to outdo her
friends by talking about sex, and about which boy's dick is bigger.
Anything outside her Teen Beat world is passed off as "weird." In modern
parlance, Angela is a jock and Jane is a goth.
Jane claims to hate both of her parents. She think's dad is an
embarrassment and mom is out of touch. Two things in Jane's life seem
incongruous with a goth-type: first that she's a cheerleader, and second
that she's saving her babysitting money for a boob job. But Jane is at
that age where she's just discovering who she really is and she starts
to gravitate toward the quiet, moody boy next door (in spite of Angela's
speculations on how weird he probably is).
While the other characters are looking for something more, only Ricky
(Wes Bentley) seems to be at peace with life. He is smart, observant,
and a great judge of human nature, although he's still hiding in his
shell. Ricky is the Jane's boy next door and he's also the Lester's
young waiter. When he's not selling pot or staying out of the way of his
abusive father, he observes the world through his video camera,
searching for Beauty. He finds it in death, in sadness, in waste. 
Chris Cooper plays Ricky's overbearing father, Colonel Fitts. He loves
his son, and he THINKS he keeps a tight leash on him. Obviously, dealing
drugs isn't a very tight leash, but as Ricky says, "never underestimate
the power of denial." Cooper is almost becoming typecast as an
old-fashioned domineering figure. Still, he handles the character with
appropriate seriousness and gravity.
The plot is not one of actions but of character development. Starting
with Lester, the characters shun the lives they've become accustomed to.
In exchange, they discover and accept the lives their true natures
demand. Lester finds his inner adolescent. Carolyn accepts that her
career is what's most important. Jane and Ricky bring each other out of
their shells, and 
Over the soundtrack an amazingly simple musical theme plays. Scored by
Thomas Newman, the music hints at discovery, awakening, and revelation,
which ties in perfectly with the characters' metamorphosis.
AMERICAN BEAUTY is one of the best character studies in years. Movies
that shun plot for characters seem susceptible to problems. Sometimes
minor characters aren't fleshed out, which ruins the richness of the
movie. Sometimes a plot is tacked on that requires a character to do
something they wouldn't otherwise do. Very rarely is it done flawlessly.
Although it comes close, AMERICAN BEAUTY is not flawless, but it's
problems are almost never character-related. Sometimes the good-looking
cinematography seems a little staged. A few plot point setups are a
little too coincidental. But because the film succeeds where it tries
to, these complaints are nothing.
Come December, look for this movie to get honored with awards and high
spots on top ten lists, including mine.

Review for Waiting for Guffman (1996)
**1/2 (out of 4) WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is worth a little chuckle, but
that's about it.=20
GUFFMAN is a "mockumentary" about the little town of Blaine, Missouri,
and the play they're putting on for their sesquicentennial celebration.
The dentist (Eugene Levy), the travel agents (Fred Willard & Catherine
O'Hara), a mechanic (Matthew Keeslar), and the Dairy Queen girl (Parker
Posey) are recruited by the "New York" director (Guest himself) to put
on the play of the town's history. The movie's title refers to a New
York theatrical agent who has promised to fly to Blaine and review the
performance.=20
The actors and filmmakers do a good job of making the movie look like a
documentary. Willard and O'Hara are very good as the husband and wife
travel agents. The movie appears to have been shot, at least partially,
on 16mm film (the favored medium of film documentarians) with lots of
hand-held camera.=20
There are a few spots, however, where the movie is clearly NOT a
documentary, such as when the "documentary" camera shows us a character
who is supposedly locked in his bathroom, alone, or when the auditioning
hopefuls are too comically "bad" to be believable. These moments are
distracting and make one realize that this is all an elaborate joke.
Somehow the "mockumentary" is less funny when we are forced to remember
that these caricatures are carefully written to manipulate us into
laughing.=20
GUFFMAN could be said to be original because it is not about a band.
Ever since THE RUTLES, it seems these mockumentaries must inevitably be
about bands =97 CB4, FEAR OF A BLACK HAT. But really, GUFFMAN is just a
rehash of the formula that worked so well in THIS IS SPINAL TAP. The
movie's advertising even links it to THIS IS SPINAL TAP and indeed all
of the Tap are involved in the film (Guest directed and Harry Shearer
and Michael McKean helped with the music). Since the movie invites
comparison to SPINAL TAP, I will compare them.=20
WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, as Bentsen might say to Quayle, is no SPINAL TAP.=20
SPINAL TAP was funny start to finish. GUFFMAN has a funny premise but
the joke(s) start(s) getting old near the end (thankfully, it is not too
long). The characters in both movies are comic caricatures, but the
characters in SPINAL TAP are more sympathetic and resilient. The
"members" of Spinal Tap went on to record a second album (after the
soundtrack album) and somehow, they will live forever in our culture,
despite our derisive laughs. The characters in GUFFMAN are as funny, but
they are disposable. Maybe it's the difference between laughing at those
above us and laughing at those below us. When Rush Limbaugh insults the
President, we know he can take it. When he starts taking jabs at Chelsea
Clinton, the same jokes are less funny. I'm overstating the point, but I
never felt as if I was supposed to LIKE Corky St. Clair (Guest) =97 I was
just supposed to laugh at him.=20
The movie does have funny segments and several of the interviews made me
laugh out loud =97 the UFOlogist, the abductee who confuses "feelings" fo=
r
"feeling," and the self-serious city council members. But the overall
experience was nothing memorable.=20

Title
Review for Tranceformer - A Portrait of Lars von Trier (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) Filmmaker Lars Von Trier (Breaking the Waves) bought a
kayak. His friend and collaborator Ernst-Hugo Järegĺrd was surprised and
asked if he was afraid, with the water so cold. No, he replied, he would
be too busy maintaining his balance to have any fear. 
That story, from the new documentary about Von Trier called
Tranceformer, is a fitting metaphor for his career. He is comfortable
when he is working, when he is creating. He can stand on a table and
direct a film crew, but when he is alone, when he is idle, - when he
doesn't have to work to keep his balance - his phobias take over. 
Von Trier was raised without much discipline. His parents often made him
set his own boundaries. He recalls feeling as though discipline was a
form of love he didn't receive. As a result of his upbringing, Von Trier
now has a lot of demons, some of which are touched upon in this
documentary. He talks rather casually about his intense self-loathing
and his myriad encumbering phobias. 
It is no wonder that so many of his films are dark and brooding, and
that they often explore the nature of Evil. Zentropa (A.K.A. Europa) is
shot in dark black and white with only occasional tints of pastel
colors. Set six moths after the end of WWII, it deals with the lingering
violence and anger of fading Naziism. 
In Breaking the Waves, the heroine is naive and neurotically dependent.
The film watches her decay as she copes with God, spiraling guilt, and
the rejection of her community following her husband's paralysis.  
The first films Von Trier ever made (when he was still a child) showed
an understanding of film's use and conventions. They also show an
understanding of when to break those conventions. At film school he
rebelled against the rules of filmmaking as set forth by his teachers -
to the delight of his fans. Breaking the Waves, for example, was shot
entirely using hand-held cameras. 
Von Trier is reputed to be camera-shy; he apparently gives very few
interviews. That reputation is supported by the fact that Tranceformer
is less than an hour long, with as many film clips and interviews with
friends as there are moments of Von Trier on-camera. That doesn't
detract from the documentary, however, because the friends say things
that Von Trier might not confess, and the clips show how Von Trier's
personality is rendered on celluloid. 
Nevertheless, Tranceformer seems incomplete by itself. Von Trier is a
quirky, neurotic character, but he doesn't come across as truly
fascinating unless you know what he has created on film. 
To be fully enjoyed, Tranceformer needs to be accompanied by some
foreknowledge of the man and his work, or by an interest in renting some
of his films. 

Title
Review for Good Will Hunting (1997)
***1/2 (out of 4) Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a natural genius. For a movie
character, that's usually a death sentence. It's a trait associated with
what my brother calls "too good for this world" movies, like PHENOMENON or
POWDER. 
Forgive me for spoiling the ending, but Will doesn't die. 
This is no formula movie. In fact, it's quite fresh and original. It's a
character study more than anything, and that's not surprising, considering
it was written by two actors: Damon and co-star Ben Affleck. 
Will works whatever kind of job he can get. First he's a janitor, then he
works construction. Off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject
that interests him. On-screen he hangs out with his friends, picking fights
in robust, romanticized-Hemingway fashion. 
Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard from BREAKING THE WAVES), a math professor,
learns that the janitor (Will) is a genius with a special talent for
advanced mathematics. Having confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant, he does
what he can to get Will into the education system. He is firmly rejected. 
Finally, Will lands in jail for one of his fights. Lambeau can get him
probation instead of prison time as long as Will agrees to therapy sessions
and to discussing mathematics with him. Will (barely) decides to go for the
therapy over prison. 
Lambeau treats Will like a son. He's proud of, and amazed by, Will's
accomplishments in mathematics. He encourages Will and tries to give him
structure, knowing that, with a little discipline, he could be bigger than
Einstein. Will isn't really interested in academia. He knows he would be the
best in his field, and therefore spend all of his time in an office,
explaining math to people like Lambeau. He would rather work construction,
which breaks Lambeau's heart.  
Meanwhile, Will attends his mandated therapy sessions. It's not long before
he shreds all the therapists on Lambeau's "A" list. Will has read enough
psychology to know the tricks of the trade, and how to keep them from
affecting him. Shrink after shrink refuses to return after Will's mockery. 
Lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate, now a psychology teacher at
a small-time community college. Knowing that Will is going to try to shred
him too, Sean (Robin Williams) agrees to take him on as a favor to Lambeau
and for the chance to meet this next Einstein. 
True to form, Will finds Sean's emotional weakness and attacks. But unlike
the other shrinks, Sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions.
Like a foster mother with a fussy child, Sean knows that the attacks are
defensive and is able to take them in stride. Like the foster mother, Sean
knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach. 
Robin Williams is excellent in this role. He's not an actor with a great
range, but in the right roles he has great depth. In this movie, as in
AWAKENINGS, there comes a point when the quiet, shy man accomplishes
something of great personal importance, and a smile of pure joy spreads up
to his eyes. Williams is the only actor I can name who can make an audience
cry just by smiling. 
I have compared Will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair.
Emotionally, he has a lot to learn, but he is not a child. He has thought
about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants. Sean, his
girlfriend, his pals, and Lambeau all help him grow, but he didn't start out
asking for, or particularly needing, help. His exceptional gift singled him
out, and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction. 
If I had to say anything bad about GOOD WILL HUNTING is that it walks the
line between drama and melodrama. It's too sentimental and uplifiting for a
straight drama, but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama. It is
emotionally engaging, but it's not quite larger than life. This isn't a
problem PER SE, but at times I didn't know quite how to take it. But this is
a relatively small complaint about a very good movie. 
A good movie allows its characters to learn and grow. It doesn't just
happen; it takes a good script, good acting, and good direction. GOOD WILL
HUNTING has all three. If you are at all inclined to see it, by all means, go.

Title
Review for Winner, The (1996)
*** (out of 4) "Unfortunately, there are many great pianists who don't
have careers." -- Lawrence Tucker, Columbia Artists
The lack of demand for classical music is just one of the pitfalls young
musicians face, even exceptionally talented ones. THE WINNERS
is a documentary that looks at four winners of a world renowned Belgian
music competition. Each has worked hard to forge his career in music,
and yet world fame and worldly fortune have eluded them all.
The most cheerful of the four is Berl Senofsky, an American who teaches
music in Baltimore. He entered the competition just to see where he
stood in relation to his colleagues. In this documentary he looks back
on a life well-lived. He has no regrets and seems to truly enjoy what he
does.
Yevgen Moguilevsky is a timid Russian pianist whose career was damaged
for twenty years because the USSR wouldn't let him leave the country (he
was labeled "politically unreliable"). During the filming of the
documentary, he was getting photographed for the cover of a new
recording, but Lawrence Tucker, his new manager, confides to the camera
that the novelty of a Russian pianist is wearing off now that the cold
war is over, and that Moguilevsky may not have the "swagger" necessary
to make it big.
Mikhail Bezverkhny comes across as a perfectionist, and as such, the
classical music business has taken a toll on him. One of the most
telling scenes involving Bezverkhny shows him berating his accompanist
(also his wife) over a detail most people can't hear. At the start of
his career, he couldn't practice in his first apartment because his
neighbors wouldn't tolerate the classical music. He had to buy an old
van in which to practice. He complains that the globalization of
classical music has caused musicians and audiences to sink to a low,
common, "gray" level of performance which is unsatisfying for him.
The musician who's had the roughest breaks is perhaps Philipp
Hirschhorn. His early career was the most promising of the four. His
contemporaries had him pegged for worldwide fame and importance, and the
archival footage supports their claim. Yet at the time of the interview
(he died shortly thereafter) he had been forced to give up his career in
music because of cancer. His tone and mannerisms make it clear he had
not yet come to terms with his loss - he builds an emotional wall that
denies the importance of music in his life.
Some might see "The Winners" as an ironic title. After all, its subjects
are not household names, even in the most musical of houses.
But I don't think filmmakers Paul Cohen and David van Tijn intended it
that strongly. Their subjects have all pursued careers in music --
recording, performing, and teaching. All still work in music, and two
still perform for a living. Bezverkhny is shown playing for the King and
Queen of Belgium and Moguilevsky is beginning a new American contract.
All four are a far cry from being losers, and they all make interesting
subjects for a documentary.
Nevertheless, the bitter point is made that bad luck, ill health, or the
wrong personality can easily keep one from achieving the world renown
that is the unspoken dream of so many musicians.

Title
Review for Let's Talk About Sex (1998)
First Troy Beyer wrote the critically panned "B.A.P.S." Now she makes her
directorial debut, writing, directing, and starring in this sub-par film
about women talking about sex. Though not without redeeming qualities, this
film is bad. 
The basic story follows three single friends -- Jazz (Beyer), Lena (Randi
Ingerman), and Michelle (Paget Brewster) -- in their search for love. Jazz
has an idea for a local talk show; it would feature women talking about sex
and dating. She and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the
women of Miami. 
The film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout, both as
part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters.
The fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the
more melodramatic moments in the film. 
There are several moments of bad acting, corny dialogue, and emotional
overextension. In a low-budget independent film from a first-time director,
these faults can sometimes be forgiven, IF the screenplay is fresh and
solid. That is not the case here. 
The script suffers from random plot developments. There are four or five of
these turns in the plot, each one raising the question "where did that come
from?" At one point, a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her
mother. We are supposed to be moved, but since the scene is completely
un-led-up to, we really don't care if she and her mother get along. We've
never seen her mother before. We never see her again. Who cares? 
What's worse, these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy.
At another point, a character announces that she can't have children.
Apparently, this is devastating. We wouldn't know this because she never
talked about having kids before, but we are nevertheless expected to be
devastated for her. The scene feels like an afterthought, its emotion
manipulative and shallow. 
These scenes grow worse and worse, culminating in an absurd climax. Two
scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that I found myself
laughing. One scene is a lover's spat between two minor characters. The
other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning
house in wails of despair and clouds of Ajax. 
Thinking on these scenes, it is hard for me to admit that the film has
redeeming qualities. But it does. 
First, it is original. We men often wonder what women talk about when they
are alone in groups, and I imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea.
It's something I don't think has been the subject of a film. 
Second, the interviews of the Miami women are sincere. Taken together, they
form a mosaic picture of Miami beachwalkers and bistro diners. The mosaic is
made of sound bites and stereotypes, but each tile is some woman's real
experience. Neither the picture of women, nor their picture of men, is truly
representative, but the point is that both sets of generalizations are
telling in their own way. At some level, the stereotypes that emerge can be
called true. 
I can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about
their "likes, dislikes, skills, and thrills," but on the whole, it's pretty
bad. And that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting, corny
dialogue, and emotional overextension. 
I'll give Beyer one more strike, and then she's out. 
Rated R (almost got an NC-17) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity.

Title
Review for Vita č bella, La (1997)
**** (out of 4) LA VITA É BELLA (LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL) is a lightweight
drama. Directed by and starring one of Italy's greatest living comics,
it naturally contains some comic scenes. I mention these facts up-front
because they become interesting once you know that half the film is set
in a Nazi prison camp.
Mixing humor and concentration camps is audacious, and it has stirred a
healthy amount of controversy. Some say that the very idea cheapens the
memory of those who lost their lives. Frankly, it's hard to argue with
that point of view. If you can't forgive a movie for attempting such a
combination, you should skip it.
However, if you're willing to be open, Benigni handles the mix very
well. By focusing on the bond between father and son, and only drawing a
sketchy picture of the horrible life of Jewish prisoners, Benigni moved
and shrunk the target for criticism, and he allowed the small human
story to bloom.
The movie begins like any other light romantic drama. It is Italy,
before the war. Guido (Benigni) is a waiter with a penchant for riddles.
He is in love with a woman whom he's met only once. Through a series of
coincidences (some of them arranged) he finally gets to know Dora
(Nicoletta Braschi), the woman of his dreams.
Guido learns that Dora, a schoolteacher, is already promised to someone
"better," someone with more prestige and money than him. Nevertheless,
he persists in pursuing her affections.
Guido's charm is amazing. In one of the finest comic set pieces on film,
several gags, which have been set up over about 20 minutes of screen
time, are paid off, one by one, all to impress a beautiful girl. The
effect marvelous, both for the audience and for Dora.
One evening at a party, the cheerful harmony of the film starts to
shift. A horse of Guido's uncle has been painted bright green with
anti-Semitic slogans. A handful of partygoers, interested in the new
German situation, talk casually about mathematical word problems
involving money saved by executing cripples. Nevertheless, the film's
melody remains bright, for this is the night that Guido finally captures
Dora's heart, her soul, and her body.
The film cuts forward in time. Italy has changed drastically, especially
for Italian Jews. Guido now has a son, to whom he teaches meekness in
the face of repressive Italian authority. Meekness is life. The
alternative is death. And as the title reminds us, life - any life - is
beautiful.
Although he doesn't deal with the mistreatment of Jews as a whole,
Benigni shows how institutionalized racism affected a single ordinary
man. On their way home one day Guido and his son Giosué (Girogio
Cantarini) encounter a storefront sign that says "No Jews or Dogs."
How would you explain this sign, not as a historian, but as a father to
your son? How do you tell him what it means without blackening his
heart? Guido not only answers his son's questions, he does it in a way
that removes them from the cruelty, and elevates them above their cold
reality. In addition, it illustrates for the audience how childish the
sign really is.
Needless to say, the sign was a sign of worse things to come. It isn't
long before Guido and his son are shipped off to a prison camp. Now
instead of a single insulting sign, Guido has a whole world, an entire
reality, to explain away.
In this last half of the film, Guido tries desperately to come up with
an elaborate explanation of their situation. They are not in a prison
camp, they are playing an extended game. There are rules, opponents, and
points earned for bravery and for not talking. If they can only earn
1,000 points, they will win a tank and get to go home.  
The real heart of the movie is that Guido doesn't see anything fun about
his "game." He loves his son so much that he will risk everything, not
just to protect his body, but to protect his mind and soul as well. The
task is overwhelming, and it seems doomed to failure, but Guido refuses
to quit.
It is this indomitable struggle for some tiny shred of goodness and
hope, in the face of an overwhelming evil, that makes this film so
moving.
Benigni is great in the role of Guido. He knows that fighting the
situation head-on is futile. All he can do is smirk at the absurdity of
the Nazi ideology. But Benigni is careful never to laugh too hard, and
he never pretends he can fight head-on as a prisoner. He plays the part
with an ironic resignation that is perfect for this film.
This film has stirred resentment and disdain in some critics. That a
light, often humorous drama is set in a Nazi prison camp are an
unacceptable mix, they say. Others blame the director for deliberately
using that combination to push buttons and pull strings.
While I wouldn't argue with them - I don't think I could say anything to
change their minds - I do disagree. To the first objection I would say
that Benigni has as much right to set a story in a prison camp as any
other filmmaker. While his depiction wasn't as grim or graphic as in
other films, he still handled the setting with an appropriate gravity.
To the second objection, I would say: let your buttons be pushed and
your strings be pulled. Why else do we go to movies if not to be moved?
Giving myself to the film, I was rewarded with one of the most moving
and crushing films in years. Though I often cry at movies, I rarely lose
control. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, and its simple message that life - any life
- is beautiful, nearly succeeded.

Review for Beach, The (2000)
So with all that going for it, it will probably be well received, if not
by reviewers then at least by the public. It gets my premature
congratulations for its assured success.
But success and quality seem to have little correlation when it comes to
blockbusters, as THE BEACH proves.
The problem with THE BEACH is that there were plot holes and logical
leaps that I just couldn't accept. I generally dismiss negative reviews
where the only complaint is that the writer "didn't buy it," because
that's purely a matter of opinion. And yet, I don't know what else to
say about THE BEACH, so here goes.
Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) has just landed in Thailand and is looking
for some REAL travel experiences -- not just the usual tourist stuff. He
learns of a secret island paradise from a crazy hotel neighbor named
Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who has a map.
The next day, coming back from the bathroom, a strange maid tells
Richard there's a note on his door. He looks at the note and sees that
it is the map. He turns to ask about the note... but the maid has
mysteriously vanished! He opens his neigbor's door and sees the walls
covered in blood. His crazy neighbor is dead!
With such a contrived, enticing setup, how could Richard NOT follow the
map? The problem is that Richard goes, not because his character seeks
it out, but because the author rolls him up and chucks him in that
direction.
Richard invites another couple -- Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and
Etienne (Guillaume Canet) -- to join him in search of the perfect
secluded beach on the map. They travel as close as they can to the
island, then swim a kilometer or two across a channel to get to there. 
They land on the far side of the island and start hiking toward
paradise. They make it past a field of marijuana guarded by men with
guns and eventually find their beach.
The encounter with the men with guns is preposterous. First of all,
Richard has proven that he's not afraid of shady characters, but he sees
a sleeping man with a gun and immediately becomes frightened. When the
man is awakened he brings another four armed men to look for the source
of the noise, ready to shoot whatever it was that moved.
But if the island is so remote and there's no way to get to it except by
swimming, why are ALL of these men armed with guns. Who do they think
they're going to shoot? If nobody can get to the island, a single gun in
a lock box ought to be enough.
Anyway, when the three arrive, they are welcomed into a "Gilligan's
Island" community of fellow European travelers who believe they are
living in paradise. The only rules are that you must never leave and you
can't tell anyone about it -- in part because the community wants
privacy, and in part because of a deal struck with the men with guns.
Several things grate at this point. There is some subtle racism. The
community is populated solely by young, attractive Europeans while the
brown-skinned natives on the other side of the island are sinister and
violent. Francoise's character becomes a Hollywood cliché of womanhood.
She sleeps with Richard before dumping Etienne, but when she suspects
Richard has slept with another woman, she becomes insanely jealous.
And then there are unanswered questions, like why are there no children
in this six-year old colony? And why are the next wave of newcomers not
welcomed like Richard and his friends were? And why would the marijuana
farmers want the fellow islanders to leave if they're worried about
secrecy?
I could go on and on. I'm tempted to, so I can explain everything I left
out. But enough is enough. You get the point.

Title
Review for Kundun (1997)
*** (out of 4) Martin Scorsese's films used to intimidate me. Because of his
reputation, I felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than
as great flicks. As much as I enjoyed them, I usually felt like I missed
something. 
I learned from Scorsese's CASINO that whatever techniques he uses are merely
there to enhance the story. No mystical interpretation is required to
appreciate his movies. 
For example, in CASINO he uses subtitles when Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci
are using code words with each other. There was no meaning more exotic than
that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what
was really going on. Or toward the end, when he uses three quick dissolves
to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building. Again, the
simple, mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing. 
I don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking.
But he simply uses the best tool for the job. 
It shouldn't have surprised me, then, that KUNDUN, a film about a mystical
religion, actually turned out to be quite straightforward. 
The movie follows the life of the 14th Dalai Lama, the spiritual and
political leader of Tibet. The movie's title is another name for the Dalai
Lama which means "Ocean of Wisdom." His story is told in strict
chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish
the literal story. (One of which makes an interesting statement: pay
attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated.) 
We first glimpse the Dalai Lama when he is two years old. His curiosity and
self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the
new Lama. 
A test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13
Dalai Lamas who have gone before. Several items belonging to the previous
Dalai Lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items. The child is
asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own. The boy picks correctly,
proving that he is the new, and the old, Dalai Lama.  
Scorsese and long-time editor Thelma Schoonmaker were kind enough to allow
the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk. Before
selecting an item, he would look at the monk, perhaps for some sort of
confirmation. Sometimes he picked right the first time, and sometimes he
made a second choice. Either way, whether through reincarnation or quick
human perception, the Tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a
wise, perceptive leader. 
>From this point on, the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the Lama's
spirit and the future leader of a nation. It is a great weight to put on the
mind of a child. In the U.S. it might be grounds for a call to Social
Services. But the young Lama accepts his destiny without any apparent
emotional damage. Neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility
keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable, well-rounded person. 
Certain patterns take shape over the years. For example, the Dalai Lama is
fascinated by technology. Radios, clocks, and telescopes are some of his
favorite toys. When he is old enough to accept his leadership, he makes
plans to modernize isolated Tibet. 
He also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain,
including herd animals. It's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to
keep them from being herded to slaughter. 
But the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat
of Tibet's gigantic neighbor, China. Tibet and its leaders prove correct in
fearing China, as, first the propaganda, then the political pressure, and
finally the armies, come across their common border. 
The Chinese invasion is so successful that the Lama's life is in danger if
he stays. The movie ends when, after much agonizing, the Dalai Lama leaves
Tibet for India. 
The story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature
films do. It just doesn't fit that mold. If it were forced into such a shape
it would have been a completely different movie (perhaps more like SEVEN
YEARS IN TIBET, which is good in its own right). 
The pacing of KUNDUN is more calm and level than that. The structure of the
film is  made to fit the characters and events, not vice-versa. Perhaps
because the pace is slower, we have more time to notice the beautiful art,
vestments, and architecture of Tibet. 
A mandala, (Tibetan sand painting) with beautiful, vibrant colors is shown
throughout the movie. The robes and hats of state are bright red and gold.
The bricks are a rich reddish brown, not unlike the skin tone of the
Tibetans. Even the Touchstone pictures logo before the movie (which is
usually light blue) is the red and gold of Tibet. 
Philip Glass composed the music for KUNDUN, and he was the perfect choice.
For those who don't know of Glass, his music is like a Tibetan mandala. His
building blocks are lots of small notes, tiny grains of music, which are
first grouped, then repeated in patterns. These patterns create interesting
textures which are themselves part of a larger composition. 
People won't be flocking to KUNDUN for it's great ending, or talking about
its outstanding plot, but it does have a lot to offer: an interesting
lifetime, exotic sights, rich cinematography, and innovative music. It gives
interesting insight into Tibetan Buddhism and takes a warm look at the Dalai
Lama as a person. 
On top of it all is the cinematic mastery of Martin Scorsese, who gives the
film a strong, beautiful, consistent look.

Title
Review for There's Something About Mary (1998)
***1/2 (out of 4) Ben Stiller sure is a good sport. 
His role is downright degrading. He gets caught in his zipper, an episode
that brings him folkloric fame; his (mistaken) arrest for public lewdness is
nationally televised; he masturbates (not on-camera, but for the camera);
and the girl of his dreams endlessly teases him. He is the butt of most of
this movie's outrageous and embarrassing jokes. A lesser, more vain actor
would have turned down the script after reading to page 5, but Stiller stuck
it out. 
Stiller fills the role with the injured dignity of a cat: he can't laugh at
his own comic suffering (his hurt look is priceless), but as long as no harm
is done, he'll get over it. He is the perfect guy to play a joke on, and the
Farrelly brothers heap on the abuse. 
Stiller plays Ted, the hapless high-school geek who was lucky enough to be
asked to the prom by Mary (Cameron Diaz, who herself is the butt of some of
the jokes). The zipper incident ends their date before it can begin, and
before we know it, 13 years have passed. Stiller talks to his old friend Dom
(Chris Elliott, in a role that suits him) and decides that he wants to look
up good old Mary, who has moved to Miami. 
Dom's friend Pat (Matt Dillon, not too bad in one of his first comic roles)
is a private investigator who occasionally makes it down to Florida, so he
agrees to look her up. When he sees Mary he falls for her at first sight, so
hard that he burns his bridges and moves to Florida. Ted hears that Mary is
ugly, fat, and crippled - part of Pat's plan to keep the competition away -
but he still wants to see her after all these years. He too heads to
Florida.... 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is the funniest movie to come along since LIAR
LIAR, but it has a distinct type of humor that's relatively untapped. Jim
Carrey has a lock on one-man sight gags. AIRPLANE!had great verbal gags. HOT
SHOTS!(and others) twist cultural references into humor. But the Farrelly
brothers (and here I also include DUMB & DUMBER and KINGPIN) drill deep into
baser human strata and make jokes that require no command of English, no
understanding of the culture, and no intellect. These jokes are aimed right
at your gut, and good luck telling yourself that you are above all that. 
There are certainly jokes above which I will rise. But these jokes have
extra ammunition. They are never left out on their own, they are always
backed up by auxiliary and followup jokes arising from the same situation.
So while seeing Ted (Stiller) masturbate is something of a joke in itself,
it is by no means the whole joke, and you better watch out when the
reinforcements arrive. 
This movie was very funny, and that is the reason you should go see it. I'm
sure the film had its faults, but I hardly had time to take notice of them.
As for the humor, not all the jokes are as funny as the best ones, and there
are long spells (maybe 20 minutes) between scenes of chaotic hilarity. But
in this film, that really doesn't matter. The good parts make it worth
seeing regardless. 
If you're still not sure whether to see THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, I have
three comments to make: 
 The jokes are cruel. Not sadistic, but cruel. If you can't stand yourself
for laughing at someone else's misfortune, maybe this movie really isn't for
you. 
 The jokes are crude. There aren't too many scatological jokes, but there
are jokes about masturbation, genitalia, and death. If these are offensive
to you, don't go. 
 Go when it's crowded. The audience reaction will make it all the funnier.
If you are the only one in the theater, it just won't be as funny. It
probably won't even be as funny on video (remind me to dock it half a star
when it hits the shelves). 
Other than that, all I can say is go see this film and have a great time.

Title
Review for Being John Malkovich (1999)
**** (out of 4) BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is unquestionably the freshest,
most original  yes, I'll say it  best movie of the year. 
In the past, people have appreciated a warning when a movie is best seen
without any foreknowledge, and this movie is one of them. If you're at
all interested, then go see it before you read this or any other review. 
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is a surrealist comedy. 
(Surrealism is a movement in art that follows the logic of dreams.
Surrealist images are often funny or absurd, yet they are not purely
comic. There is usually some underlying irrational logic behind them.)
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a puppeteer (of marionettes) in New
York. That is to say, he's unemployed. Schwartz is very good at it, and
a few scenes of puppeteering (performed by Phil Huber) are quite
impressive, but they don't put food on the table.
Craig is married to Lottie (Cameron Diaz), a naďve, gentle soul who
loves and keeps animals. She works at the pet store to support Craig,
her menagerie, and herself.
Craig's unemployment is becoming a strain on the couple's finances, so
he takes a job as a file clerk. At work, he meets Maxine (Catherine
Keener). He's smitten with her, and she knows it. Whenever they talk,
she always gets right to the point, which as she sees it, is sex. She
strings him along for a while, occasionally letting him buy her a drink.
While filing one day, Craig discovers a little door, like the one Alice
found at the bottom of the rabbit hole. Naturally, he opens the door,
and behind it lies a little tunnel. He crawls through, emerging on the
other side, inside John Malkovich's head. Craig watches in amazement as
his new host travels through the city. After about fifteen minutes, he's
ejected from Malkovich, slimy and dirty, into a ditch on the New Jersey
Turnpike.
He tells his wife about the amazing discovery, and she insists on seeing
for herself. Lottie takes the trip through Malkovich and loves it.
Malkovich has just come out of the shower and is toweling himself off,
which Lottie really likes. Afterwards, Lottie decides that she is a
transsexual.
Back at the office, Craig tells Maxine about the Malkovich portal, and
the two go into business together, selling tickets to the experience.
One day when Lottie is in Malkovich, Maxine gets his number and calls
him (pretending to be an avid fan). She asks him if he would join her
for dinner, and before he can say no, she tells him when and where. Both
Lottie and Malkovich make a note of it. Lottie goes back into Malkovich
that night, hoping she/he will have sex with Maxine.
A jumble of infatuations emerges between Craig, Lottie, and Maxine, with
Malkovich forming the imaginary fourth corner of this space-time love
triangle.
Like in a dream, the human feelings in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH are
ordinary, blunt, and strong. Like in a dream, they are also the key to
understanding what it all means. When you look at how Craig, Lottie, and
Maxine FEEL, you understand what the movie is saying. Actually, the
underlying story is rather mundane.
What makes this movie so great, then, is the surreal detail that adorns
the story, from set design to costumes, to hairstyles.
Although these details are a rich source of conversation and writing
material, I think it best not to say too much. But do know that
the "Malkovich portal" is just the tip of the surreal iceberg floating
in
the film's subconscious.
What I can safely say is the this is director Jonze's first feature
film. Before MALKOVICH he directed commercials and music videos, and
acted in "Three Kings" (as the fourth "king"). The screenwriter is
first-timer Charlie Kaufman. Perhaps it is because they are both novices
that they risked it all and made no compromises.
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH has to be seen to be appreciated. No review can do
it justice. It is the kind of well-made, completely original movie that
reminds me why I love going to the movies in the first place.

Title
Review for Smilla's Sense of Snow (1997)
** (out of 4)SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW feels like it was written
chronologically. That is to say that it feels like the author (or
screenwriter) didn't really have an ending in mind, but plowed ahead
anyway with the story. 
It is a story about a death, probably a murder. Smilla (Julia Ormond)
comes home to her flat in Copenhagen and sees a crowd outside. A
Greenlandic child has fallen from the roof and died. Smilla recognizes
the child, Isaiah (Clipper Miano), and goes to the roof try to
understand the tragedy. She senses from the footprints left in the snow
that he was chased off the roof; he didn't just fall. 
The child's relationship to Smilla is gradually revealed through
flashback. We see that Isaiah's mother is often drunk and that Smilla,
half Greenlandic herself,  has been like another mother to him. Because
of this close bond, and because of a Greenlandic belief that murder is
an insult to the soul, Smilla embarks on a crusade to uncover the truth. 
She is surprised to see that she is thwarted at every turn. Nobody will
talk to her. The best she can get are vague pieces of some great puzzle.
Soon shadowy figures are trying to stop her or kill her. The mystery
grows from "who killed Isaiah" to "what is everybody hiding." 
I haven't read the book, but I suspect it was better than the movie.
Many of the devices used in mystery books just don't translate well to
the screen. For example, our hero has time to solve murders. She gets
some money from her father, and we vaguely know about her "work", but we
don't know how she lives. How does she pay for her apartment or her
computer? 
The movie also relied on too many coincidences. In a book, one could say
that an important sign was revealed in a photo. We could praise our hero
for her great detective work. In a movie, such a sign has to be big
enough for the audience to see, and in this movie, the photo comes
across as a comically obvious hint and not clever, observant detective
work. 
SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT THE "SURPRISE" BLOWN.Finally, the
answer to Smilla's great mystery is revealed to be a fantastic object
from the beginning of time. In a book, such things are much more
believable. Engrossed in the story and encouraged by subtle hints, we
tend to give internal reality to the author's words; we fill in the gaps
with our imaginations and with the tone of the book. However, in a
movie, there can be no gaps. An alternate reality must be created as
visually complete as possible in order to convince us that it is real.
In SMILLA, the movie's mystical keystone is a big wet rock and a pool of
water. In a book, our imaginations would tell us it's much more, but
visually, it's a big let-down. 
But this movie isn't bad just because of a poor translation from page to
screen. The story sets up expectations that it cannot meet. There is an
overwhelming sense of coverup and conspiracy. All of the characters
Smilla questions either lie to her, give evasive answers, or refuse to
talk. Whatever Smilla doesn't know is such a huge amazing conspiracy
that nobody dares speak of it to an outsider.The story sets up the
secret to be so incredibly amazing that nothing could possibly be
shocking enough to live up to all the hype. Naturally, this turns out to
be the case (see the previous paragraph). 
There were a few bright spots in the movie. The shots of the ice floes
of Greenland and of the ice-breaking ship are neat (even though some of
"Greenland" appears to be computer generated). 
Also, Clipper Miano gave a good performance as Isaiah. It was a small
role, but a bad child actor could have spoiled the mood of the movie.
The part could have easily been overplayed, but Miano was quiet,
reserved, and observant. 
I also liked Ormond's character in spite of some small inconsistencies.
Smilla is a very good female role.  She is genuinely strong and smart
(compared to fellow "scientist" Emma from THE SAINT). She has her own
desires. She's not interested in being someone's "better half." She is
her own person. 
She describes herself as "rough" and "heartbroken". She is both. When
The Mechanic (Gabriel Byrne), a neighbor who may be part of the
conspiracy,  approaches her, she interprets his interest as overtures to
sex, and she rebuffs him. She doesn't mind being friends with The
Mechanic, but she knows a pass when she sees it and she is just not
interested; she has other things on her mind. 
Later on, she actually complies with The Mechanic's request for a kiss,
and I find this to be an inconsistency with her character. On the other
hand, it could be the actors' faults for not generating any chemistry on
screen. 
But in spite of its good points, on the whole, I'd rather have read the
book. It feels like something got lost in the translation.

Title
Review for Cider House Rules, The (1999)
**1/2 (out of 4) The rules of the cider house remain unread for the
longest time. But in the meantime, there are other rules that everyone
follows, rules that help things run more smoothly. And these are the
rules that count.
THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is Lasse Hallström's adaptation of John Irving's
novel. It follows Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire in another solid,
well-delivered role), an orphan who grows to adolescence in a Maine
orphanage. The orphanage's doctor, Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine,
performing with a convincing American accent) raises Homer as though he
were his own. Under his tutelage Homer learns about general practice,
pediatrics, and yes, even gynecology.
Dr. Larch is relieved that Homer is growing into such a promising young
man because he'd hate to see the orphanage fall into the hands of more
traditional, less liberal doctors. (Dr. Larch is willing to perform
abortions, even though they are illegal in the 1940s). But Homer has
other ideas. He's lived his whole life in the orphanage and he wants to
get out. Besides, he's not willing to perform an abortion, in spite of
Dr. Larch's constant lecturing.
Eventually, Homer finds a way to leave, and he does. He takes the first
job he can find, picking apples. He starts a complicated yet rewarding
life outside the orphanage, where he finds love, work, money, and
friendship in the apple business, but Dr. Larch and the staff send him
reminders about how important it is for them that he return and take
over.
THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is sweet and sentimental. The characters are good
and well-meaning, even though the conflicts and complexities that
confront them are genuinely troubling. The characters address such
issues as abortion, violence, love, freedom, and responsibility. There's
a lot going on in THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, which should earn praise for
Hallström and Irving (who advised on the film and even plays a small
role as the stationmaster). 
But the movie takes on too much for my tastes. The life in the orphanage
and the life outside could have made two different movies. Maybe 45
minutes of film time pass at the orphanage, and we think we know the
story and all the characters. But after Homer leaves,we meet a bushel of
new characters at the orchard. To Irving (and to Homer), the two parts
are equally important. But on film, the Y-shaped story doesn't seem
right.
Similarly, the film isn't sharp or incisive. Its message is soft and
mushy like applesauce, instead of clear and distilled, like hard cider.
Instead of jolting your mind, it's easy to swallow, plain and palatable.
It brings up hard issues like abortion, trauma, and fraud, but it never
takes a convincing stance one way or the other. In itself this is not a
criticism; in fact, it seems to be Irving's point -- that meaningful
rules can only be made by those who have to abide by them; but because
the movie asked so many interesting and controversial questions, I wish
it had at least told us what ITS rules were, and how it arrived at them.
But these points could work in favor of the movie, depending on your
tastes. For instance, you might say that merely addressing these issues
is enough, or that a sweet drama is no place for divisive political
issues. 
For me, I wish the movie had narrowed and sharpened its focus. Still, I
enjoyed it overall. I was won over by the charming and simple
characters. Nobody had a mean streak. Nobody was the villain. The people
who caused pain and conflict were normal people making unoriginal
mistakes. Irving and Hallstrom gave them room to learn from their
mistakes, then let life flow on.

Review for Habit (1997)
*** (out of 4) "Vampirism is everywhere," according to Nick (Aaron Beall).
"It is at the bottom of a bottle or a needle in the arm. It is five hundred
channels of insipid cultural drivel... It is the insidious Faustian bargains
we make every day, the little compromises that eat at our soul." This is the
insight from a thoughtful new vampire movie called HABIT, a movie with one
of the highest quality-to-price ratios around. 
Nick is the best friend of Sam (played very well by director Fessenden). Sam
meets a great girl, Anna (Meredith Snaider), at a Halloween party. Drunk as
usual, he leaves with her, the perfect escape from his ex, with whom he has
just broken up. He realizes he grabbed the wrong coat and dashes back to the
party to change. When he gets back out, Anna is gone. 
Anna haunts his thoughts for a couple of days while he finishes moving his
girlfriend out. He never got Anna's phone number so all he can do is think
about her in-between drinks. 
She shows up again a couple of nights later and they hit it off. After a
wild night of semi-exhibitionist pleasures, Sam wakes up in a strange part
of town with a bloody lip. At least he's got her phone number, and they seem
to have a thing going. 
Sam feels good, but a little weak. His relationship with Anna seems to be
recharging his life. He still drinks, but he's more conscious of it. One
senses that with a few lucky breaks, Sam could get himself out of his
current rut and make it work with Anna. Her strength is just what he needs.
The sex is interesting, if a bit strange. Anna is something of an
exhibitionist and she likes to bite Sam, but he enjoys her vigor. 
Their relationship continues for several weeks, while Sam keeps feeling
sicker and weaker. Eventually Sam decides he needs some time away from Anna
and with his old friends. He recalls another friend from earlier in the
movie who mentioned something about feeling sick in spite of all the sex he
was getting, and THAT friend disappeared. And the strange bloodsucking
behavior during sex... it's almost as though Anna were a... well, of course
not LITERALLY, there is no such thing, but if there were.... 
Several things make this film a surprisingly good sleeper. 
The cinematography was surprisingly good, considering the film's low budget.
Frank DeMarco shot the film on 16mm stock using natural, preexisting, and
other inexpensive light sources. Habit was nominated for the Spirit Award
for best cinematography in 1998. 
For the most part, the acting was also surprisingly good. Fessenden in
particular was great as the man struggling against the drain on his
energies. His intense icy blue eyes, missing front tooth, and greasy stringy
hair add a lot to the credibility of his performance. Snaider had the
next-biggest role, and though not as strong a performer as Fessenden, she
held her own. Only a few performances, and in thankfully minor roles, had
the sour taste of amateur actors. 
The thing that makes this film really good is Fessenden's script. The
dialogue is natural and well written, but the best thing about it is the
insightful story. In this story, modern vampires aren't gothic wraiths who
feed on human blood. They are the embodiment of the mental stresses of
alcoholism, loneliness, and city life. Or rather, they are both. This fresh
perspective is a welcome change from more traditional treatments of the
vampire story, and is the thing that makes this movie deserve to be seen in
wider release. 
This film was reportedly made for a mere $190,000 by unpaid actors and
filmmakers over a period of three months in New York. Other films have been
made as cheaply but few have been made as well for that price.

Review for Jackie Brown (1997)
*** (out of 4) There are a lot of things right in JACKIE BROWN, and they
all combine to form an entertaining, stimulating movie. 
First, the plot is a twisty little caper which Tarantino adapted from an
Elmore Leonard novel (whose GET SHORTY also made the favorable jump to
the big screen). It involves a flight attendant (Pam Grier) who's a
small-time smuggler on the side. When the cops catch up to her and tell
her she either informs or to goes to jail, she informs. Then she tells
her "employer" about the cops. We can't tell what she's got in mind
because she's playing both sides, which keeps us interested and involved
in the story. 
Second, the performances are top notch. The most surprising comes from
Robert Forster, a character actor who plays Max Cherry, a bail bondsman.
One is convinced that the person on the screen really is a bail bondsman
and not an actor. Samuel L. Jackson as crime boss Ordell Robbie and
Robert De Niro as his stoned sidekick Louis check in with their usual
badass performances. Pam Grier makes a solid showing as the title
character, though I don't see how she is irreplaceably perfect for the
role, as Tarantino has suggested (maybe he sees himself as the great
reviver of pop culture icons of the 70s). 
Third, whether you like the look or not, Tarantino and production
designer David Wasco (who worked with Tarantino on PULP FICTION) have
created a unique style that successfully mixes elements of several
decades. The cop-funk music, the orange and brown interiors, and the
presence of Pam Grier all suggest the movie is set in the 70s. But
Jackson's millinery and long hair puts the movie in the 80s. The
pot-smoking blond beach girl and her VW bus pins the movie in the late
60s, while "Chicks with Guns" on the VCR reminds us that the real
setting is the 90s. 
Finally, The cinematography and editing are fresh and interesting, but
they also serve the story  - they're not just there to show off.
(Cinematographer Guillermo Navarro has worked with Tarantino before.)
Early on, JACKIE BROWN looks like a student film. Long takes with a
static camera let scenes play out how they will. In fact, one of the
first shots of the movie is a long take showing Ordell and Louis on a
couch. After quite a while, Jackson orders his blond groupie to get some
ice. She was framed out of the picture and we didn't even know she
existed until the men became thirsty. It was a clever way to show
Ordell's disdain for women. 
Toward the end, a critical scene is played out from a few different
perspectives, each revealing new and important details about the scene.
It was a nice little RASHOMON bit (or a CLUE: THE MOVIE bit for the
cynical among you) that drew out the tension of the scene and gave the
whole sequence some extra weight. Since it is critical to the story, the
extra weight is appropriate. 
One final point is well worth mentioning. I am constantly surprised (and
pleasantly so) by how NORMAL people look in British movies. Actors are
chosen for how well they fit the parts and not for how many glamour
magazine covers they have filled. I think it's great that a 44-year old,
nonanorexic woman is the hero in this hip, slick, American movie. 
Congratulations to Tarantino for proving himself an able filmmaker who
promises to change the face of Hollywood movies.

Review for Bug's Life, A (1998)
**** (out of 4) There are several reasons that, of the two bug movies
this year, I was rooting for ANTZ. Casting Woody Allen in a cartoon was
a stroke of genius, and it showed that the cartoon would not pander to
kids at the expense of entertainment for adults. Also, ANTZ was put out
by DreamWorks, which is not associated with Disney. It's nice to see
someone give The Mouse a run for His money.
But as much as I liked ANTZ, I have to admit that A BUG'S LIFE is
better. It is not just clever, it is imaginative. There are some
genuinely inventive scenes that only an ant could have dreamt up. The
people at Pixar must have worked hard at having so much fun.
The film introduces us to a certain colony where the grasshoppers are
running a protection racket. If the ants fail to feed them, the
grasshoppers will do violence. So the ants gather twice the food they
need, half going to the grasshoppers.
One ant, Flik (Dave Foley), spends his time inventing instead of
gathering. While showing his picking machine to little Dot, the
invention goes haywire and spills the piled grasshopper food into the
pond. When the hoppers show up, they are steaming mad and they increase
their demands and their threats.
The royal court has seen Flik mess things up before, so when he proposes
to leave the colony in search of aid, they gladly accept. Any plan that
involves him leaving is okay with them.
Flik makes it to the strange and cruel city peopled by hustlers and
beggars (including one vet who had his wings pulled off by some kid 
and people say BABE 2 was dark!). In a seamy tin can Flik encounters a
mismatched group of bugs who appear to be just the toughs he was looking
for. He asks for their help and they agree.
The mercenaries are actually a Fellini-esque troupe of starving
performers, but Flik thinks they are fighters. The actors think Flik is
going to pay them to perform, not fight grasshoppers. Eventually things
get straightened out, but by then, there is no time. The colony will
have to make do with what it has.
Necessity is the mother of invention. Screenwriters John Lasseter and
Andrew Stanton saw the necessity from the ants' point of view, and not
from their own. The problem was how to beat the grasshoppers, not how to
finish the script. I was amazed that the bugs' invention was nothing I
had seen before. The solution to their problem (forgive me for not
giving it away) was truly original, and not recycled from dozens of
other children's screenplays. 
Other refreshing examples of the screenwriters' (and the bugs')
innovation made me chuckle at the creative energy that went into making
this film. There was a flute-like instrument, played by several bugs at
once, and a second-grade art project - a mural depicting the grisly
victory of the ants. There was even a second-grade skit about the ants
versus the hoppers. Each of these bumps in the story was a reminder of
how important, and how rare, good writing is.
And speaking of writing, I should add that the characters in A BUG'S
LIFE are much better developed than I had feared. When the previews
showed an food-obsessed German caterpillar and a macho man ladybug, the
one-dimensional warning lights went off. But in fact, these characters
were given a little room to spread. Yes, the bugs are caricatures, but
they are introduced and developed individually.
In addition to the writing, the look of the film is truly outstanding. I
was at first disappointed, after having seen ANTZ, that the creatures in
A BUG'S LIFE appear to be made of plastic or clay, instead of something
more subtle or naturalistic. But on closer inspection, you can see that
older ants have wrinkles and pockmarks in their smooth clay surfaces.
You can also see some uncanny depth in the irises of the bugs' eyes. So
even though the look is more cartoony than in Antz, it wasn't any
simpler or cheaper. 
And when the "camera" moves, the swirling, changing perspective moves
with it. There seems to be some trick involved, but I can't put my
finger on it. Perhaps it's the photographic equivalent of a lens made at
tiny proportions. In any case, the handful of dizzying shots where the
camera moves are great.
There are lots of tangential comments I could make (see sidebar at
http://net.indra.com/~mmapes/bug_ad99.htm), but instead I'll leave you
with just this one. In this age of selling out and bottom lines, and
after the eyeball-rolling gratuitous picnic scene in ANTZ, A BUG'S LIFE
contained no product placement.
Enjoy! And don't miss the "outtakes" during the credits.

Title
Review for Endless Summer 2, The (1994)
*** (out of 4) The Endless Summer II, 1994, Bruce Brown. 
THE ENDLESS SUMMER was made in 1966, almost as a home movie. Brown and
two companions spent one year surfing, switching hemispheres as the
seasons changed, and circling the globe in the process. The year of the
endless summer was clearly the best year of his life, and thanks to his
16mm camera, we got to see it all. 
Nearly three decades later, Brown arranged for the once-in-a-lifetime
adventure to happen again. Even if this movie were less interesting on
its own, the comparison between the two would make it worth watching. 
The most apparent difference in production is that the sequel is shot in
35mm color widescreen. This time, Brown had a budget and sponsorship,
making the experience less personal than the home movie of his previous
journey. Because of the previous trip, Brown and his new companions knew
more what to expect, so the tone of the sequel is less awestruck and
more anticipatory. 
(Leonard Maltin reminds us that an important difference between the
films is that in this one, you get to see some breasts. Thanks,
Leonard.)  
Surfing has changed in 28 years, too. A few major developments have
arisen. The "short board" allows surfers more maneuverability so they
can ride bigger waves, and the "boogie board" allows beginners to get
their feet wet without mastering the balance needed to surf. The
composition and manufacture of surfboards has also gone high-tech,
making use of lighter and less brittle materials. 
In 1966, when there were only "long boards" the best waves were little
curly ones that don't collapse, and great surfing meant long rides. Now,
especially for shortboarders, the best waves are the biggest ones you
can find, and great surfing is as much determined by the size of the
waves as by their shape. 
Two new companions "star" in The Endless Summer II. "Wingnut" is a
shortboarder who exactly fit my stereotype of a surfer, and Patrick is a
longboarder, identifiable because he's not "Wingnut." 
This film, like the previous one, starts off on shaky ground. Because
the first movie was so personal, the bright colors and wide screen made
me think that this would be a cheap ripoff. Also, because Wingnut fit my
surfer stereotype so perfectly, I thought I would hate the smug,
shallow, airheaded dude. But once the world tour started, I got swept up
in the story, and I realized my stereotype was as shallow as I thought
the surfers would be. 
Brown and the surfers follow the same route as before, traveling along
Africa's coastline, hopping to Australia and Fiji, and ending in Hawaii.
They didn't make a point to visit all of the same spots, because not all
the spots had good surfing (especially by the standards of 1994). But
they DID revisit the best spot on the globe for surfing: the little
beach in South Africa that they found in 1966. 
This time, as they made their way over the sand dune, they found not a
beach but a housing development. Because the development had changed the
nature of the dunes, the sand no longer blew so easily into the ocean,
which changed the terrain of the ocean bottom, which changed the
structure of the waves. The surfers gave it a try for old times' sake,
but it just wasn't the same. 
This scene made me appreciate the footage from the first visit even
more. Because Brown made that trip in 1966, we all got to see a
beautiful little spot, the best in the world for a short time. (If a
wave breaks on the best surfing spot in the world and nobody rides it,
is it still the best spot in the world?) 
The new best spot for surfing seems to be on an island in Fiji. Near the
end of their world tour, Wingnut and Patrick follow a rumor to Fiji,
where the waves are supposed to be awesome. For several days, our tour
guides don't surf at all because the weather and the waves just aren't
cooperating. After a few days they are ready to head to Hawaii, when
finally, the waves come up. 
The brightly lit blue of the 8-foot waves mix with the green of the
island and the neon of the wetsuits to form some beautiful pictures.
Brown's camera is waterproof this time, and we get to see the surfers
close up. We get to ride along with them. We get eaten by waves. And the
exuberant photography matches the mood of the surfers, who after
jonesing for days on end, spend nine hours playing in the water without
even realizing it. 
The last stop in Hawaii showcases some of the best surfing (and surfers)
in the world. The footage is great but the story has lost its focus. The
sequel ends more with a sigh of relief than an exclamation of wonder.
The world is smaller now than it was 30 years ago, so the accomplishment
isn't as great. And with sponsorship comes the responsibility of
completing a film, whereas before, the film was a labor of love. 
All of this serves not to detract from the sequel, but to embellish the
original. The second movie succeeds but it is more apparent how much
work goes into a project like this. To have accomplished it the first
time with two friends and no backing is an amazing feat. 
Two times around is probably enough for Brown and his audiences. But
there's no doubt that the second time was worthwhile. Even if you don't
like surfing, there are lessons to be learned about how people and
places and customs change over a span of 28 years. 
Brown was a wonderful tour guide for two of the most interesting tours
on film.

Review for Rush Hour (1998)
Before I knew much about Chris Tucker, I found his schtick
(high-pitched, super-fast trash talking) annoying. His sense of
self-deprecation has allowed him to grow on me, and he is now one of my
favorite comics.
Jackie Chan's schtick is, and always has been, amazing. His graceful and
daring stunts always entertain.
Combining the two seems more like a cheap Hollywood gimmick than a
stroke of inspiration. But whatever the motive, the outcome works. The
two look like they had a great time with each other, and that genuine
energy makes this otherwise-formula movie into something worth
remembering.  
Tucker is James Carter, an LAPD cop. He's not very good, but his ego
doesn't know that. Carter ruins an undercover operation, blowing up the
evidence in the process. True to Tucker's schtick, Carter can't even
acknowledge the mistake. He has a million excuses and they are unleashed
fast and furious. He's a nuisance to his boss and a laughing stock to
his colleagues, yet he remains egotistic and cocky.
Meanwhile, the FBI is investigating an international kidnaping in L.A.
Their Chinese counterparts insist on sending their own agent Lee (Chan)
to help with the investigation. The FBI sees Lee as more of a hindrance
than a help, so they ask the police for someone to keep Lee busy. The
LAPD is all too happy to get Carter out of their hair for a while.
Turns out Carter isn't too pleased about the babysitting job, and
neither is Lee. The two team up to solve the crime themselves, with or
without the support of the FBI or the LAPD.
The movie, thankfully, makes no pretense about why the audience is in
the theater. It's not because of the plot or the conflict, it is only
because of Chan and Tucker, and the filmmakers know it. The movie
doesn't put us through any more plot than is necessary, and it gives us
plenty of Chan's amazing stunts.
Most of Chan's so-called "American" movies of late (Mr. Nice Guy,
Supercop, Rumble in the Bronx) were actually made a few years ago in
Hong Kong, so if Chan seems to have aged a lot since his "last" movie,
he has.
That doesn't mean he's lost his touch.
One of Chan's more amazing moves comes early in the film as he hops
between vehicles in slow-moving traffic. The stunts don't look as
physically challenging as some of his earlier ones, but they highlight
the grace with which Chan can still move.
Tucker is funnier than ever. As I said, his sense of self-deprecation
makes his annoying persona palatable, even tasty at times. His strutting
ego won't hesitate to broadcast a victory or explain away a defeat. But
his strutting is always an order of magnitude bigger than the actual
accomplishment. You can't help but laugh both at Tucker and at all the
other loudmouth braggarts in your life.
The two aren't a natural duo, but they do have some good scenes
together. While waiting at a stakeout, they teach each other their best
moves (to the tune of "War"). And in the tradition of Jackie Chan
movies, there are outtakes at the end that show just how much fun Tucker
and Chan had together.
And that's why this movie is worth seeing. Don't kid yourself. You're
not going for the plot or the suspense. You're going because Jackie Chan
kicks ass and because Chris Tucker is hilarious, and because the
combination is sure to be entertaining.

Review for X Files, The (1998)
*** (out of 4) First, I am not a big fan of the X-Files TV series. I have
nothing against it particularly, I just don't happen to watch it. Having
said that, I can now say that I liked THE X-FILES pretty well. For us
non-fans, there's nothing big going for it, but there are a lot of little
things. 
The movie opens on an ice cave in north Texas in 35,000 B.C. Two
proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside. The
alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is
seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien. The movie jumps to the
same cave today where a boy (Lucas Black, from SLING BLADE) is captured by
the same black ooze. 
We then cut to FBI agents Scully and Mulder (Gillian Anderson and David
Duchovny), who have been pulled off of their previous assignment
(investigations into the paranormal) and put onto the bomb squad detail. A
caller has threatened a federal building in Dallas, Texas. On a hunch,
Mulder checks out the building across the street, and, wouldn't you know it,
he turns out to be right. The FBI finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not
in time to defuse. Five people die in the blast, and when Mulder learns who
the victims were, a light bulb goes on over his head. 
The two agents team up to investigate, against FBI orders, the links Mulder
has made. Their search leads them back to the north Texas cave, all across
the country, and even to Antarctica as they get closer and closer to "the
truth." 
The plot, and "the truth," are uninspired. I got the feeling that what I
learned was supposed to shock and amaze me. It didn't. The possible
existence of aliens on Earth has been explored so many times before in
movies that one could hardly count them. But the point of THE X-FILES is not
what the truth is, but the extent to which it has been hidden. It's a
slightly more interesting angle, but it still raises expectations about that
"truth" too high. 
If this were the whole film, I would say the movie was mediocre, perhaps
even boring. But there are other qualities that make me like this movie well
enough to recommend it. 
The pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest. Before the
audience can get tired of one location, the agents follow a hot tip to
another location, and so on and so forth. The locations are not all
computer-generated sets, either. There are some artificial settings, but the
desert night of Nevada, the edge of suburbia in Texas, and the endless
fields of snow in Antarctica (actually somewhere in North America.) make
this fantastic film feel more real. 
Ward Russell's cinematography is very good. The overall look is dark and
ominous, appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot. Russell is
able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding. When the
movie is set in darkness, the picture quality is still rich and detailed.
Finally, and specifically, there is an incredible shot at night in which the
camera CROSSES the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train. I don't know if
the shot is faked in any way, but it looks dangerous, and it looks great. 
The movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the
film.(SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVE YET TO SEE THE MOVIE - THERE IS
A SPOILER IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCES.)During the opening prehistoric
sequence, a howling wind dogs the soundtrack, never giving the characters or
the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound. In one of the movie's
most effective sequences, metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a
cloud of buzzing bees. The visuals of the scene are good, but what makes it
so surprising and frightening is the sound. 
There was no question as to who the movie's stars would be. Even so,
Duchovny and Anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good
combination. Both are easy on the eyes and together, they have some good
timing, banter, and energy. There is a hint of chemistry between them, but
it never gets in the way of their professional relationship. They are like a
couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street. There
might be some romantic interest, but for now they're more interested in
their environs than they are in each other. 
No single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense
of paranoia that makes the TV show so popular. But enough things were done
right that THE X-FILES is one of the more interesting summer adventures to
come along.

Title
Review for Saint, The (1997)
** (out of 4) There are very few reasons to see THE SAINT.
One is that it has Val Kilmer. Another is that it has Elisabeth Shue.
Another is that not much else opened this week that's likely to be any
better, judging from current reviews.
Beyond that, THE SAINT is boring and too long (at under 2 hours). There
is very little in THE SAINT that's original or fresh. Here's the plot:
Simon Templar (Val Kilmer) is a thief and a master of disguise. He is
hired by evil Russians to steal the secret formula from the beautiful
young scientist, Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue). Simon seduces beautiful
Emma and has the secret formula in his hands when he realizes that he
has fallen in love. He tells the evil Russians to buzz off -- he has
found a better offer.
The evil Russians, being evil Russians, demand the secret formula for
double the price, or the girl gets it. Simon Templar steals the secret
formula from beautiful Emma and sells it to the evil Russians -- for her
own protection. But beautiful Emma, not realizing the danger she is
putting herself and her new love in, tracks the elusive Simon Templar
into the lion's den and they both end up in the iron fist of the evil
Russians, who are not satisfied with the lovely Emma's secret formula.
The pair of young lovers manage to escape. Luckily, the beautiful Emma
has not finished the final calculations on her secret formula (she's 2
hours away from finishing it), so Tretiak (Valery Nikolaev), leader of
the evil Russians, in the line that defines the entire movie, proclaims
"Kill him and bring her back . . . alive!" The young lovers,
inseparable, are chased through the rivers, slums, and sewers of Moscow,
hounded by the minions of the evil Tretiak.
Initially, I would say this movie is bad because it is formulaic and
cliched. However, I have defended admittedly formulaic movies (Dante's
Peak). Sometimes, I said,  the formula works. In THE SAINT, the formula
fails.
FORMULA DEVICE 1: THE DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.THE SAINT is condescending to
the lead female character Emma. She is treated as bait by the Russians
(do as we say or the girl gets it); she fouls things up for both her and
Simon when she tracks him to Russia; she is portrayed as an airheaded
ditz at the press conference early in the film (in spite of her being an
alleged expert in her field); the hero calls her very "domestic;" and
finally, the hero valiantly sacrifices his safety for hers at the end.
In light of all this, her being a brilliant scientist is a mere token
gesture by the screenwriters (Jonathan Hensleigh and Wesley Strick).
This device worked well when it was turned on its head in RAIDERS OF THE
LOST ARK. Marion (Karen Allen) is the damsel in distress, but she is
strong. She is not a helpless screaming sex object.
FORMULA DEVICE 2: BAD GUYS DIVULGING THEIR PLAN.The evil Russians are
sitting around having a casual conversation while, unbeknownst to them,
Simon is listening in. In the course of their casual discussion, one of
them mentions how funny it is that nobody knows where they were secretly
hiding the stash. They all have a good laugh.
This device works well in most of the James Bond movies, partly because
the movies are presented tongue-in-cheek (not so THE SAINT), and partly
because the Bond movies popularized, if not invented, this device (THE
SAINT has no such tradition). Also, the Bond villains viewed Bond as an
equal of sorts. They viewed him as a worthy opponent who could
appreciate their diabolical strategies. In THE SAINT, the device is
uninspired and transparent.
FORMULA DEVICE 3: TV REPORT SUMMARIES.This formula device has gotten
lots of exposure from the weekly humor newspaper, The Onion. Basically,
the movie shows TV reports (or, in a corollary, reporters on the scene)
to summarize what's happening, in case you haven't been paying attention
to the plot. THE SAINT is particularly guilty of this condescending
device.
I can't think where this formula worked well, but there are many fine
adventure movies that were better for not having to explain themselves.
If you missed the all the subtleties of the plot the first time around,
a second viewing was a pleasure (TOPKAPI, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, the
entire Indiana Jones trilogy, the James Bond series . . .).
FORMULA DEVICE 4: LUCK.When the author writes him/herself into a corner,
a stroke of luck will save the hero. There is a scene in which Simon is
doomed. He is unarmed and an evil Russian is pointing a gun at his head.
Luckily, a cop just happens to come by and tells the villain to freeze,
allowing Simon to escape.
This device doesn't work well. What works better is having a scene of
APPARENT luck that is attributable to a virtue of the hero. In other
words, the cop shows up because the hero foresaw the trouble and called
the police in advance, or the cop shows up because the hero is always
helping the cop, and this is an act of reciprocity (though even this is
becoming a formula device).
It is lazy and unfair to criticize a movie solely for being formulaic.
Let me criticize THE SAINT then, not because it follows a formula, but
because it is an unimaginative and half-hearted attempt at storytelling.
It does not borrow from, build on, or wink at formula; instead it uses
formula as the cheapest, easiest solution to the movie's potentially
interesting conflict.

Title
Review for Bowfinger (1999)
*** (out of 4) The situation is a little too wacky for BOWFINGER to be a
great, lasting comedy, but it is funny.
Steve Martin plays Bobby Bowfinger, a (very) small-time director trying
to complete one last picture before he turns 50. His accountant Afrim
(Adam Alexi-Malle) has written a great script, so now all he needs is
funding and a big-name star. 
Martin's Bowfinger would be a great director. That's not to say he could
make a good movie, but he has all the schmoozing techniques down pat.
When he needs help from above, he can dress to impress (including
ponytail, cell phone, and convertible, all "borrowed.") When he needs
help from below, he calls people, tells them what to do, then hangs up
before they can say no.
Martin uses his schooze to "run into" a big producer (Robert Downey,
Jr.), and even manages to get some conditional funding. All he has to do
is sign the biggest action star in Hollywood, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy),
to his picture and Renfro (Downey) will pay for it.
Bowfinger's next stop is the Ramsey mansion, where Kit won't give him
the time of day. Things look hopeful after Bowfinger lies about being in
"Mind Head," a psychological/religious organization that Ramsey puts his
faith in, but as soon as Bowfinger pulls out the script, he's out the
door.
Kit Ramsey is extremely paranoid, and Murphy is really not that fun to
watch in the role. He plays the part perfectly for this movie, but he's
got a nervous tension that's not as likeable or entertaining as the
other characters in BOWFINGER. It's unfortunate because it changes the
timbre of the movie when he's on screen.
Bowfinger realizes Ramsey will never agree to be in the movie. He tries
to break the news to his crew, but doesn't have the heart. Instead he
tells them that he's going to make the movie WITH Kit Ramsey, as
planned. And he is, too, only Ramsey won't know about it. He's going to
stalk Ramsey from afar, and have the actors walk up to him and say their
lines.
He hires a lookalike (Jiff, also played by Eddie Murphy) to do
reverse-angle shots, and action sequences that they can't stage with
Ramsey. Murphy's Jiff -- a dumb, goofy lug whose career aspiration is to
be an errand boy -- is much more fun to watch.
Rounding out Bowfinger's cast and crew are an aging actress (Christine
Baranski) who has worked hard without making it big -- she hopes this
movie will be the one; his cinematographer who has the means to "borrow"
professional equipment from a studio; his leading lady, fresh off the
bus from Ohio (Heather Graham), who sleeps her way to the top of the
little production, but somehow never cheapens herself by doing it, and
four undifferentiated Mexicans Bowfinger nabs crossing the border, who
throw themselves into their new vocation and start learning about
lenses, f-stops and "Cahiers du Cinema." 
BOWFINGER has been getting a lot of praise, most of it deserved. But
it's not a perfect movie, and there are lots of uneven spells. The jokes
are used one or two times too many, and as short as it is (98 minutes),
it's a little too long.
But it's still a funny movie, and credit should go to the great cast.
Everyone really did a good job overacting, each person trying to upstage
everyone else. They were having fun, and it showed.
Best of all, though is Steve Martin in another role that's just perfect
for him. He's energetic, optimistic, enthusiastic, and just a little
naďve. His philosophy seems to be "damn the laws, we're shooting a
MOVIE!"

Review for Batman & Robin (1997)
**1/2 (out of 4) When the first "new" Batman movie was released 8 years
ago, nearly everyone made something out of how dark it was. People
either loved the new tone of the movie or they missed the camp of the
old TV show. With the latest installment in the current series, it seems
that the pendulum is swinging back. 
BATMAN & ROBIN is more campy and less dark than any of its recent
predecessors, but it's hard to decide if that's bad or good. On the one
hand, the dark tone was hard to sustain for two hours - both for the
filmmakers and for the audience. On the other hand, now we are bombarded
by dumb jokey lines like those from the TV series, and we don't have a
mute button. 
In the first "action" sequence, after Batman (George Clooney) makes his
Fred Flintstone-like entrance via the frozen back of a dinosaur, hordes
of cartoonish villains "fight" Batman and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) while
everyone makes lame hockey jokes. This first sequence is the worst in
the film for cheesy camp, so at least the movie gets better as it
progresses. But those first impressions are hard to change. 
This time around bat-villains Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and
Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) conspire to wipe out Gotham - Freeze in a
misguided revenge plot and Ivy in an attempt to end oppression of plants
by animals (notably men). 
Freeze is a villain, no doubt, but he is also a dupe - he is much less
evil than Poison Ivy. Considering Schwarzenegger's shoot-to-WOUND role
in TERMINATOR 2, I wonder if he has a clause in his contract that
stipulates his characters must have some redeeming qualities. I also
wonder if his conservative politics had anything to do with evil Ivy's
association with environmental extremism. 
There are some plot threads that deal with the addition of Batgirl
(Alicia Silverstone) to the family, the terminal illness of loving
servant and father figure Alfred (Michael Gough), and the jealous
sibling rivlaries that arise between Batman and Robin. 
Actually, the "family" subplot of this movie was more thoughtful and
honest about family matters than most kids movies are. BATMAN & ROBIN
deals with trust, competition, caring for elderly family members, and
the sacrifices of parents for their children. Don't get me wrong. Most
of the movie is look and action; not plot. But still, it was nice to
include a bit of thoughtful fluff in this episode. And while the Michael
Medveds complain about a lack of "family"-oriented movies, a big bad
action movie gives them just what they asked for - but not necessarily
what they wanted. (Goes to show how misued the word "family" is in
political and critical circles.) 
It's hard to evaluate "acting" in a movie like this, where the sets,
costumes and special effects take center stage, but a good performance
is still important. 
I had very low expectations for Schwarzenegger, who got top billing. He
wasn't as bad as I had feared, which is not to say that he was very
good. Clooney gave the best performance yet as Batman/Bruce Wayne.
Michael Keaton made a good Bruce Wayne in the earlier movies, when the
neurosis of creating a superhero alter-ego was explored. But Clooney
makes a more confident, mature, approachable, and likeable Wayne. (Val
Kilmer was practically invisible as the last Wayne/Batman.) Chris
O'Donnell's youthful charm ordinarily makes him hard to take seriously,
but he's perfect for the role of Robin. 
But as I mentioned, the stars of this movie are the modelmakers,
costumers, and special effects technicians. Gotham's architecture was
nicely displayed, the oppressive size and weight of the city came across
well, the cartoonish sets were elaborately decorated, and the special
effects were seamless. 
There are significant differences between BATMAN & ROBIN and the
previous Batman movies, in scope, in tone, and in the details. But if
you've seen the others, then you know what you're getting into. If you
liked the last ones, chances are you'll like this one. 
By the way, depending on your intestinal fortitude, you may want to
stick around for the credits. The second song that plays over the
credits - GOTHAM CITY by R. Kelley (aka Love Theme from Batman & Robin?)
- is really awful. It's so bad that it's funny, but it is not for the
weak.

Title
Review for Donnie Brasco (1997)
Except for a superb performance by Al Pacino, Donnie Brasco is a
run-of-the mill gangster movie.
Donnie Brasco is the undercover name of Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), an
FBI agent who goes undercover in the mob to gather information. His
sponsor is Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), who personally vouches for
"Brasco." As the movie progress, Pistone becomes more and more like his
alter ego, distancing him from his family and endearing him to Lefty and
the other mob regulars.
Even though the movie is called "Donnie Brasco," the most interesting
character is Pacino's Lefty. Lefty is not your typical movie gangster.
Lefty has trouble at home: he loves his son, but cannot forgive him for
abusing drugs. Clearly, he had high hopes for him which are now
shattered. Lefty has trouble at work: when a superior is whacked and the
position opens up, Lefty is passed over for promotion by a young mob
go-getter (played by Michael Madsen). Early on, when Lefty is "called
in" (which almost always means certain death) he reacts not with hate or
anger or defiance, but with a dazed, fatalistic sense of fear and
resignation. Lefty is the Willy Loman of gangsters.
Pacino plays Lefty extremely well. At first, before we know he's a
loser, Pacino is a tough, hard-working gangster, but he is quickly
manipulated and misled by Brasco. Lefty is in such dire need for
companionship and respect that he takes Brasco under his wing a little
too hastily. Pacino beams when he's schooling young  Brasco in the ways
of mob life; when he finally has a son again. When problems arise at
work, Pacino conveys defeat and disbelief with his posture, his face,
his whole body. Lefty is a tragic figure and Pacino makes that figure
human.
Unfortunately, Donnie Brasco is not as much about Lefty as it is
about Brasco/Pistone. Johnny Depp is good, but not outstanding. There's
nothing wrong with the story, but it's nothing new. There are effective
moments of tension, claustrophobia, and fear, (like when the whole gang
knows there was a snitch in Florida) but there are also boring segments
that should have either been left out or given some importance (like
scenes of Brasco's troubled home life).
The movie raises interesting questions about trust and betrayal, about
children's needs for fathers (and vice-versa), and about balancing work
with family. These themes arise from the story and give it a more
interesting depth. Credit screenwriter Paul Attanasio for that. But
those themes don't resonate in the filmmaking. For example, Newell could
have paralleled the strife between Lefty and his son with the Pistone
family's loss of their father and husband -- and it seems that the story
might even imply such a parallel -- but the movie never tries to
makes any such connection.
In short, the movie is uneven. Pacino's performance is great and the
story seems to have an interesting take on human nature, but the bland,
mechanical direction make it not quite worthy of a full recommendation.
I should mention that most other reviewers have liked this movie better
than I did, so if you are interested in seeing Donnie Brasco, read some
more reviews for more positive hype.

Title
Review for Waterboy, The (1998)
**1/2 (out of 4) In spite of Roger Ebert's extremely negative review,
The Waterboy was the sold-outest show of the day when we went. After
just a few days in release, it has now set a box office record for
November openings.
If you're not a fan of Sandler's, you might not like this movie. The
plot is as dumb as Sandler's character, Bobby Bouchet, a 30-year old
dunce.
For example, Bobby gets his job as a waterboy by providing fresh water
to the local football coach. The coach (Henry Winkler) had been using
some slimy brown sludge until Bobby came along. Bobby won the coach's
respect with his knowledge of H20, and he got the job. 
Bobby gets razzed as the waterboy, and he takes the abuse with good
humor, as his mom (Oscar winner Kathy Bates) has no doubt taught him.
But Coach Klein tells Bobby he needs to stand up for himself. He needs
to fight back or else the razzing will never stop. So the next time a
player teases Bobby, he drives the bully to the ground with the force of
a pro wrestler. Klein is so impressed he signs Bobby up for the team as
a tackle.
Dumb as this all sounds, the setup has a certain film-plot logic to it.
It follows all the conventions and rules of a sports movie - the young
kid has to prove himself before he gets his first big break. Then he's
allowed to join the big boys and make a splash. The specifics are silly
and dumb, but they do fit the bill.
Coraci, screenwriter Tim Herlihy, and Sandler never let the movie go
above this level. It would be easy to imagine some sly wink at the
audience that says "we know this is a dumb plot and we're really above
this." Instead, the movie stays firmly rooted in its silly reality, and
I think that's important for this type of comedy. Once you start
winking, you're merely TALKING ABOUT comedy, not actually performing it,
and you end up with a dog like SPY HARD.
What's also funny is that in your average sports movie, the hero would
be a placekicker or a pitcher or a golfer. He would have some special
skill that set him apart. So the idea that tackling is a "special skill"
is actually pretty funny. It's even funnier from Sandler, whose comic
persona includes a dark, violent side (in BILLY MADISON he plays
dodgeball with first graders and shows no mercy).
THE WATERBOY wasn't as funny for me as THE WEDDING SINGER, Sandler's
last film. The Southern dunce character is funny, but it's almost too
much to endure for a whole movie. It almost seems as if THE WATERBOY
should have come first in the evolution of Sandler's career.
Sandler's character in THE WEDDING SINGER seems so much more mature and
well-developed (if such adjectives could EVER describe Sandler) than the
hulking slack-jawed dunce in THE WATERBOY, that I wonder if perhaps they
were written in reverse order.
Regardless, Sandler has established himself in American movies. Dumb as
his movies may be, Sandler can always make me laugh. It's a sure bet
that whatever he comes up with next will sell lots of tickets, including
one for me. No matter what Ebert says.
