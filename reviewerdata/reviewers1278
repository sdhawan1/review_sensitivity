Review for For Love or Money (1993)
CAST:  Michael J. Fox, Gabrielle Anwar, Anthony Higgins, Michael Tucker,
       Dan Hedaya, Bob Balaban (who never appeared...)
DIRECTOR:  Barry Sonnenfield
SCREENPLAY:  Mark Rosenthal, Lawrence Konner
SCORE:  Bruce Broughton
RELEASE:  October 1, 1993
     I don't like movies that start off bad and end up that way, too.
I don't like movies that present an audience with absolutely no
redeeming values (nothing to laugh at, or cry about, or feel excited
about).  I don't like movies that front as something that they're not.
I don't like movies like this one.
     Michael J. Fox stars as Douglas Ireland, concierge at a ritzy
hotel in New York.  He doesn't take his work lightly--the man makes
people feel useful, saves marriages, takes dogs for a walk, gives you
tickets to any Broadway show you want.  And Doug has a dream of
creating his very own hotel, called THE DOUG, or THE RIVER HOUSE.  He
just needs to make a big-time money man very happy in the mean time, so
that he can close a deal.  To do this, he must take good care of the
man's younger mistress (played by Gabrielle Anwar).  The woman is
beautiful, and Doug has been after her for some time now, so he gladly
accepts the job and does whatever it takes to make his dream a
reality.
     Well, Doug falls in love with her (big surprise, huh?).  The only
problem is, he can't act on his feelings for risk of crushing his
dream.  Ah, what's a man to do...?  I knew what would happen.  In fact,
I knew everything about this movie within the first ten minutes it
played.  FOR LOVE OR MONEY is an exercise in just how predictable and
utterly worthless a comedy--or *movie*, in general--can be.  It isn't
funny, or romantic, or engaging, or surprising, or original in any
way.  Fox acts with some sort of smirk on his mug the whole time, and
basically looks rather bored throughout the movie.  The usually strong
supporting "love interest" that should have backed him up--or, in this
case, sufficed for him--is played by an enigmatic young actress named
Gabrielle Anwar.  We saw her briefly in SCENT OF A WOMAN, doing the
tango with Al Pacino, but got nothing, no sort of impression, from her
little screen time in the film.  I guess FOR LOVE OR MONEY came to her
in the wake of the success of that movie, she read over the screen
play, and said, "Yeah, i should probably do this so I can work some
more and survive in this business."  It's just too bad for her that the
script, by two different people, has *no* luster about it whatsoever.
     And what about Michael J. Fox?  What's his problem?  I know he can
be funny, I saw it in BACK TO THE FUTURE 1, 2, and 3.  I know he can be
dramatic, I saw that in CASUALTIES OF WAR.  But lately, things just
don't seem to be working out for him (first LIFE WITH MIKEY, and now
this?).  His character of concierge here is pretty much a nice guy--
but that's it.  He's extremely shallow in the movie, and isn't able to
give his character the gravity it so desperately needs.
     I didn't want to give this movie a bad review--I hate doing that
for *any* film.  But the disappointing fact is:  Bad movies often are
written, and cast, and filmed.  FOR LOVE OR MONEY should've stopped
on the first level, been trashed, and then rewritten until it could
make us care about it.
     What we have here is an excruciatingly unnecessary film.

Title
Review for Judgment Night (1993)
       Somewhere between big-budget action films and small-budget
morality tales exists JUDGEMENT NIGHT, a constantly exciting, always
tense urban thriller about kids on the run.  And no matter how you feel
about foot-chase movies, or shoot-out movies (or even movies that
seldom show you the light of day), *this* movie is never less than
engaging at any time.
       We first meet Frank Wyatt, a family man whose wife thinks he
should stop hanging out with the guys who "have the hormones of
teenagers" and start being around adults more.  But Frank hasn't been
out of the house in a long while and he thinks he needs a breather.
So, he tells his wife he loves her, kisses his baby's head (just like
any devoted father and husband should), and is off with his best
friends for a night out.
       Next, are Mike, Ray, and Frank's brother (whom he never, ever
gets along with) John.  They all congregate in a van/bus, and are off
to watch boxing in downtown Chicago.  Wouldn't you know, traffic's too
damn slow, and Ray decides to get off the main highway for a short
detour.  And wouldn't you know, they find themselves in a part of town
none of them has ever seen before.  Ray is determined to get them to
the boxing match on time, but then a funny thing happens-- he hits some
guy on the run from bad guys.
       The guys try to help out this stranger they've nearly killed,
but before you know it the bad guys show up and retrieve the strange
man.  Enter Fallon (played by Denis Leary), a drug
kingpin/mobster/whatever who pulls a gun and murders the man in cold
blood.  "Rule number one:  Do not steal from me," Fallon states to his
band of henchmen.  "Rule number two, no witnesses."
       And so it goes, as this action-adventure is set into nonstop
motion.  Given the amount of time this film in on the screen, and the
number of long encounters which take place, not much time is allowed
for much character development.  So, there isn't any (except if you
count a whiner/wimp who only shows his true colors when it's too late).
Then again, developing characters who provide the grounds for a story
that just about leaves you breathless, and nothing more, would be a
waste of time, especially when the action is as good as it is here.  We
get fights in the sewers, on and off trains, in low-rent apartment
buildings, and even (the finale) in a small shopping mall downtown.
And each sequence has a distinct feel to it, and each is inventive
enough to make you feel as though you haven't seen any of this before.
       The script, by Lewis Colick, is extremely derivative in its ways
of executing action and suspense, and the score, by Alan Silvestri,
(when it can be heard through all the fantastic rap music) sets a nice
tone for what you see.  Director Stephen Hopkins, of PREDATOR II fame,
does what he couldn't do in that film with this one:  Make it credible
enough for us to want to continue watching.  True, this isn't a
classical piece of cinema, but it does just what it needs to:  Stay on
the screen as long as it needs to be there (no longer, and no less),
and excite us while we watch.

Review for Forrest Gump (1994)
CAST:  Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson
DIRECTOR:  Robert Zemeckis
SCREENPLAY:  Eric Roth
CINEMATOGRAPHY:  Don Burgess  /  VISUAL EFFECTS:  Ken Ralston
RUNNING TIME:  2:19
RELEASE  --  July 6, 1994
     "We all do things sometimes that, well ... just don't make sense."
     For all its broad scope, all its twenty years of American History,
FORREST GUMP tells a simple story of two people who can never be
together.  Through the eyes of the title character, the film quantum
leaps over a number of important events (wars, and such), but never
loses sight of what's most important.  Life unfolds comfortably here;
what our hero does may not make sense ... but it sure is noble.
     Tom Hanks (outdoing anything he's done to date) portrays Forrest,
a simpleton whose IQ may not meet basic educational norm, but whose
heart is as big as life itself.  As a young boy, Forrest faced
persecution from others not as understanding of his physical handicap
as mama (Sally Field).  Young boys and girls wouldn't let him sit next
to them on the school bus; they threw rocks at him, insulted him.  To
make life a bit more morally miserable, mama had to tell people things
about daddy that didn't seem quite right, and do things with men that
made no sense to Forrest.  But it was all for the benefit of her boy,
whom she would stop at nothing to get "the same opportunity as everyone
else" for.  Her loving devotion gave Forrest enough inspiration to, one
sunny afternoon, break away form the chains holding him back and
discover in himself an inner strength, something that no one else had so
much of--speed.
     Not all little children were unkind.  One girl accepted him for
who he was, and showed friendship still.  The daughter of an abusive
father, Jenny Curran understood with total clarity of young, open mind
the pain that Forrest was going through, perhaps in a different
respect, and with him sought refuge from home life.  As narrated by the
older Gump:  "She was my most special friend.  My only friend."  The
two children never separated for more than a second than need be and,
as we watch them grow older, we see that nothing between them changed.
     As high school ends, and Forrest enters college on sole account of
his running ability on the football field, he and Jenny are forced to
split up.  That's not an easy thing, especially when, during one of
many frequent visits to her all-girl college, Forrest sees her in the
midst of front-seat sex.  He doesn't know much about anything, and
understands even less why Jenny hasn't (apparently) kept him in her
heart as he has kept her.  It's one of many life, learning, experiences
that Forrest encounters throughout the film--others being Presidential
visits with the likes of Kennedy and Nixon, Vietnam, professional
shrimping, world-class ping pong championships.  But above all else,
the one experience that proves most difficult to endure is life without
Jenny.
     It's a nifty premise.  Forrest Gump--a man less smart than anyone
else around, finding more success and good fortune in life than anyone
else around.  The film would seem to say that if one has a good heart,
nothing can go wrong, nothing bad can happen.  Nothing, except the one
thing dearest to a heart.  And that's understandable for a man like
Forrest Gump; he may be an idiot, but he knows more about love from
silently loving one girl all his life than most men find loving
hundreds of women.  That one girl for Forrest can't (or won't) give him
what would mean more to him than a thousand wars, a thousand visits to
the White House--romantic love.  He would never harm her, never break
her heart, and always keep her safe.  It's extremely ironic, then, as
in a scene in which Forrest has just rescued her from a group of
perverts in a strip-tease, that she demands him leave her be:  "I can't
help it.  I love you."  She says, "You don't know what love is" and yet
he knows more about it than she does.  It's truly amazing how a person
can know someone else all their life, and never *really* know them at
all.  Just as he doesn't understand what love is (as far as Jenny
thinks), he doesn't understand to stop loving her, either.  The feeling
he has for Jenny is probably the only true, human emotion Forrest has
ever known, and the best thing for her even as she cannot reasonably
accept it.
     That's what FORREST GUMP is all about--relationships.  Aside from
Jenny, Forrest meets a man as intellectually down as himself named
Bubba, whose only goal in life is to eat and sell as much shrimp as
humanly possible.  In the army, Forrest meets and serves under
Lieutenant Dan Taylor, the man whose life Forrest saves, but whose
dignity Forrest "cheats" away.  These are friendships we care about,
with people we care about; people Forrest would do anything for, never
disobey, and always be loyal to.  But like Jenny, they don't always
know how to handle it; a scene with Forrest and Lt. Dan in a hospital,
after the Lieutenant's legs have been amputated, displays the madness
and rage of man whose life has been morally diminished because of the
bravery of another:  "Every man has a destiny in life, and you cheated
mine away from me."  Taylor is a complicated character--a man whose
entire life has been garnered to fight and cease to be in war, as did
every one of his ancestors in every American war; as Forrest narrates
of the first time he met Taylor:  "I guess you could say he had a lot
to live up to."  Sitting on the floor, as we witness one of the film's
remarkable special effects, the frustration of man dead inside is made
audible:  "What am I going to do now?"
     Forrest strongly effects the lives of several major and minor
historical figures, and those closest him.  Returning home from war,
Forrest becomes a rich man from ping pong advertisements and uses the
money to keep the promise he made his friend in Vietnam; the friend who
died there in his arms.  Forrest takes his riches and purchases a
shrimping boat, having little success at first, but major triumph in
the end.  From that springs even greater financial well-being, giving
him the opportunity to do something good for Bubba's family, even
though Bubba is gone, and for other places he visited along the way.
His partner in the shrimping business, also keeping a promise to a
friend, is Lt.  Dan who, through Forrest's belief in The Almighty and
the chance at a new life given him, finds spiritual meaning in the
world and the strength to carry on.  Just to see all this happen to her
son is the greatest success of all for Forrest's mother who, on her
death-bed, tells him with all honesty, "I did the best I could."
     Tremendously entertaining, FORREST GUMP brings with it deep and
heartfelt emotion.  The film is one of the best examples I can bring to
mind of artists who believe in telling a good story, and trust in the
power of it.  Forrest is a good, honest individual to whom good things
seem to come naturally.  But Director Robert Zemeckis--working with a
script by Eric Roth--doesn't rely on the fact that Forrest is mentally
'slow', or even want you to care for him merely because he is "not a
smart man."  You get the feeling that even if the character were
presented as normal (total contradiction to the novel on which this
picture is based), his actions would still warrant our trust and
dedication.  Forrest does whatever people tell him to do; in the
Army, a soldier tells him to turn off the television, and he does so
without question; Lt. Dan orders him run to the store and fetch a fresh
bottle of wine, and he instantly gets up to go.  And the best instance
of Forrest's obedience comes when Jenny is just about to leave him
(again), and he gives her the Medal of Honor he received for saving so
many lives in Vietnam; she refuses to take it from him but, as he
explains, he only got it for doing what she told him to do--what he
does best.  The scene ends just like this: "Why are you so good to
me?"  "... You're my girl."  Jenny--"I'll always be your girl."  A
nice, subtly moving moment between two people who care for each other
more than words could ever say.  That's what this movie incorporates
better than any other this critic has seen thus far in 1994--quiet
moments that endear into the heart and mind.  Some- thing not likely to
be forgotten any time soon after the film has made peace with itself,
or ever.  This is superb work from Director Zemeckis, most assuredly
the very best accomplishment of his career.
     Casting of the lead must have proven difficult task.  What actor
alive could play a man like Forrest Gump, bring out his inner strength,
beauty and struggle without letting the audience think he isn't taking
any of it serious?  Tom Hanks is probably not the first name that came
to mind.  But he puts a completely new spin on his talent here, while
at the same time putting forth the best performance of his career.
With Hanks as our guide, we see Forrest's pain, his frustration and
terror, his sadness and doubt, without actually seeing any of it at
all.  What's on the surface is the mostly blank-faced, open-eyed
sincerity of, not a retarded man, but a man who would have it all if
only God had permitted his intelligence to rise above.  What's
underneath all that is a strong spirit with more love to give, more
contributions for his world to make, than he or anyone else knows what
to do with.  An actor who can put that on the screen, non-judgmentally
and without satire, after it's all said and done making the viewer
agree without a doubt that Forrest deserved his, good fortune, is going
way above and beyond his duties as actor.  Hanks turns out to be the
key.  His performance is breathtakingly simplistic, but not simple; his
mannerisms, intonation, annunciation are all perfect.  Hanks' work is
not just good ... it's ethereal.
     As the love of his life, Robin Wright makes for a constant delight
in Jenny.  A woman who should probably open her heart to Forrest more
than she does but cannot because the heart she has is distraught, Jenny
wants to be a part of life, experience it for whatever good or bad it
will bring.  She and Forrest share a complicated relationship; he
begins life with total back-hold and ultimately find freedom of being,
while Jenny starts out with freedom but winds up immersed in
self-intoxication, prisoner to the demons inside.  What life has to
offer her is initial good followed by lack of control (drug abuse,
abuse from men): In a disturbing scene, Jenny walks out onto an
apartment ledge, high on drugs, contemplating suicide, the lyric "I
can't change" leading her along.  Over the course of two turbulent
decades, this emotionally scarred young woman proves willing to delve
so deeply into "expanding her mind" because of pain suffered her during
a mother-less childhood--as the film would seem to say during a
quietly moving scene in which Jenny throws rocks at the deteriorated
house she once called home.  When she falls to the ground in tears, you
realize just how lost this person is.  And yet, for all that complexion
Jenny remains somewhat of an enigma.  She cares for this man Forrest,
but does she *love* him?  Time apart passed by like a nightmare, and
once it is ended, the 80s are set into motion and she comes to him one
last time, her intentions are unclear.  Despite this lack of full
substance, Wright delivers a performance of delicacy and the utmost
care; you want Jenny and Forrest to come together, somehow, and that it
can never be is heartbreaking.  Why the underrated, talented, beautiful
Wright isn't working more is a mystery.
     Rounding out the flawless cast is Mykelti Williamson as Bubba,
Sally Field as Forrest's mother and (most notably) Gary Sinise.  Sinise
brings power and fury to the film just when it's needed, giving an
already tremendous motion picture its edge in the best performance of
his career.  Michael Humphreys effortlessly establishes the innocence
of the film, and little Hanna R. Hall is just the sweet "angel" she
needs to be.
     What surprised me most of all about FORREST GUMP is that, as easy
as it would have been to do, it does not exploit a war.  During the
brief appearance of it on screen, Vietnam is presented with more
authenticity than most films that've dealt with it directly.  The
soundtrack, an eclectic blend of songs from days gone by, is not here
to create anything the film doesn't already have.  The music
effectively enhances the mood.  And Alan Silvestri's score softly
provides a feeling of nostalgia, so that just as Forrest is narrating
the events of his life there is an extra level of poignance.
     1994 is seven months deep, and not too late to begin serving up
its crop of best pictures.  FORREST GUMP is one of them.  It has a
sense of being and, more importantly, time and place; an uplifting epic
of the human spirit about being all that you can be.  Its people, I
was happy to meet ... and awfully sad to say goodbye to.

Review for I Love Trouble (1994)
CAST:  Julia Roberts, Nick Nolte, Saul Rubinek, James Rebhorn, Robert Loggia
DIRECTOR:  Charles Shyer
SCREENPLAY:  Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer
CINEMATOGRAPHY:  John Lindley
RUNNING TIME:  2:01
RELEASE:  June 29, 1994
     Julia Roberts walks into this film like a dream.  Dressed in suit
and skirt, her long legs and hips moving in perfect rhythm with a
confident stride, she strolls smoothly through the cite of a train
wreck, sparks a-flying, and into the life of rival reporter Peter
Beckett (Nick Nolte).  She's just what he envisions in a
woman--beautiful, sexy and, more importantly, insecure enough to know
less about what she does for a living than him.  It's a tidy, engaging
introduction to a movie that, unfortunately for these two talented
stars, has no involving story to tell.
     Writers Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer have given Roberts a
character she can really sink her teeth into.  She plays Sabrina
Peterson, a cub reporter for the Chicago Globe, whose only apparent
goal in life is to out-scoop the famous Peter Brackett.  Perhaps it's a
way of getting ahead in her own publishing firm, getting a reputation,
or proving her independence--that she isn't just a pretty face on the
job--that gives her such ravenous interest in a case involving some
sort of hormone designed to make cows produce milk earlier than they
need to.  I LOVE TROUBLE isn't really about the investigation these
columnists pursue--and shouldn't treat it with the importance this film
does--but a subtle, light romantic comedy about two people who would
seem to have absolutely nothing in common but the work and wind up more
intimately involved than expected.  The dialogue given them is
sporadically snappy banter, and Roberts and Nolte breeze through it
with the smiles and batting eyes of two veterans.  What they do not
need is a moronic, recycled subplot with murderers that will put them
in danger at the film's apex.  And yet, I LOVE TROUBLE is another in
the long, long, long line of movies to emerge from Hollywood in recent
years featuring potentially talented writers who naturally assume
(based on what they've seen before them) they must give an audience
what the industry can't seem to do without.
     The clash between comic duo and suspense subtext couldn't work
less than it does here.  The continuous report being executed is
uninteresting; the villains are helplessly un-written; the
peril--including an elevator shaft and unsteady platforms--is boring.
But all the while there is Julia Roberts (who looks great in a knit
sweater and jeans).  Having returned to the screen after two hectic
years of personal unease, Roberts seems to have found an understanding
of herself, and what it is that makes her a charismatic persona.
Director Charles Shyer definitely knows what it is, and captures it in
the best part of his picture:  the grin, the eyes, the legs.  We get a
lot of it, as Nolte gazes at her in the beginning and never seems to
take his eyes off her; a scene in which he peeps through a keyhole at
Roberts' slender legs lets you know exactly what his character thinks
of her own, and what we should all concentrate on more than anything.
Even during PRETTY WOMAN and FLATLINERS, I can't remember ever enjoying
watching Roberts talk in a movie more.
     Nolte is his suave self, but he too cannot escape the irreparable
doom this film has made for itself.  It's completely predictable fluff,
with mild comic touches here and there and barely a thing to remember
it by.  Julia Roberts is beautiful to look at, but that alone does not
a movie make.  Take note, you future screenwriters.

Review for American Beauty (1999)
Ever seen a film so well-constructed, so accomplished
every moment, one to the next, you get chills?  That happened
to me about ten times during the brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant AMERICAN BEAUTY.
Hard to describe, and how often does that happen to
movies, BEAUTY stars Kevin Spacey (in _the_ performance of
1999) as Lester Burnham, a self-proclaimed loser who tells
us candidly hešll be dead soon.  He feels dead already,
anyway, so his presage sounds like that of someone content
with, at least, knowing how things are going to turn out,
knowing they gave a crack at changing their dolorous existence
for the better while they still had a chance to.  As opposed
to living in a constant state of numbness, and certainty life
will always be unsatisfactory and the best to possibly hope
for, from it, is to occasionally experience mediocrity.  Noone
around you respects you, youšre stuck in a dead-end job, home
and family couldnšt be more wrought with dysfunction -- so
much so that itšs like everybody knows their role, and nobody
even feels connected to themself any longer.  I canšt imagine
a lower form of being, which is right AMERICAN BEAUTY kicks
off.
Lester canšt take anymore.  The day to day to day emotional
void; the resent laying dormant, just below the surface,
chafing everything.  The nagging sense of detachment.  His power-
trip wife, Carolyn (a most energetic Annette Bening), places
too high a value on their couch, and dresses professionally to
tend garden; no time for sex.  His daughter Jane (Thora Birch)
hates both parents, equally, and wishes they would just go away.
At work, his boss hints around a firing, unless he writes a
company letter begging them to keep him on.  Hopeless scenario.
Then, Lester meets two individuals whošll turn things around.
One is Amanda Hayes (Mena Suvari), his daughteršs cheerleader
classmate.  At a high school basketball game, he spots the blonde
lolita -- in a rather racy dance sequence, ages considered, where
itšs just the two of them: Lester alone in the bleachers, spot-
light on her -- and is marvelled.  Therešs a great scene right
after -- Jane introduces Amanda, and Spacey stares at the girl,
mouth agape, stumbling desperately for something to say; itšs an
embarassing moment because Spacey plays it with genuine infatuation,
crush written all over his face, exposed and vulnerable.  Later,
he eavesdrops on an integral conversation which promptly inspires
Lester to start working out, get buff.  To impress, at first,
but it becomes more about building self-confidence.
Person #2 is Ricky (a mesmerizing Wes Bentley), the new
arrival next door with a propensity for filming everything in
sight; broken home, itšs a means of escape.  He hooks Lester
up with weed and, in another terrific scene, quits his job as
a waiter -- probably just as big a waste of time as Lesteršs
advertising position -- without batting an eye.  Lesteršs
floored by that kind of indifference; friendship is instantaneous.
We also meet Rickyšs domineering Marine colonel father
(Chris Cooper), who beats him up for disrespecting privacy and
requires a drug test every six months.  Something I canšt recall
ever having seen before in a movie.  I didnšt so much agree
with that characteršs turn of events, but hešs performed with
a firey intensity by Cooper that brings the caricature bully
out of cliche zone.
Same goes for the rest of this cast.  Thora Birch, as
Jane, with a permanent cautious/troubled gaze, lets us know
the isolation of jaded youth from scene one, as she is video-
taped by an unseen Ricky who asks her if she wants him to kill
her old man.  Birch finds just the right tone and sustains it
effortlessly.  She has the generation-angst, sure -- mom and
dad (mostly mom) construe her as brat -- but a scarred soul to
boot, and the actress looking lovely in her teens, hair dark,
face ravaged by repressed emotion, haunts in a knock-out piece
of work.  I loved all her scene with Bentley (Supporting nom for
this guy, please), the creepy new guy Jane catches spying on her
and dismisses with a łfuck you˛.  Face to face, though, Ricky
staring directly at Jane, nothing but eye contact, it isnšt so
easy since he seems to be looking into her.  Through her.
Getting to know her, which we presume nobodyšs ever taken the
time to do, without words -- just pure, unspoken honesty.  Their
best scene is spent watching a plastic bag dance in the wind;
he explains itšs like God speaking to anyone aware enough to
notce.  He notices.  And, therešs the great line, ł... so much
beauty in the world, I feel like I canšt take it˛, made all
the more powerful by Bentleyšs tear-eyed delivery.  Ricky is
observant, forthright:  łIšm not obsessing.  Išm just curious,˛
he tells Jane; or, łYoušre ugly.  Youšre boring.  Totally
ordinary.  And, you know it˛ to the superficial Amanda.  Sometimes
the words hurt, but theyšre always true.  Itšs a defense
mechanism, his brutal honesty, we sense.  We get to sense a lot,
with this nuanced portrayal of sophisticated toughness.
I have to go back to Kevin Spacey.  Hešs found a career
high.. no minor feat (his work, here, surpasses even GLENGARRY
GLENN ROSS - my favorite).  Like Billy Bob Thornton, in last
yearšs A SIMPLE PLAN, or Robert Downey, Jr., in TWO GIRLS AND A
GUY, this is truly superlative acting.  I always measure the
effectiveness of a performance by whether or not I can make
out an actoršs face, or if there is only the character; wierd,
but it happens.  Only the great ones do that, and in BEAUTY,
Spacey does it.  I was glad to see Lester Burnham regain self-
esteem.  I cared.  His alliance with the much younger, but only
in appearance, Ricky is palpabe and memorable.  His perhaps
insalubrious relationship with Amanda is expertly handled.
Lester is turned on by her, and she by him, and that doesnšt go
away once the script has established Lesteršs awakening, rebirth
so to speak; the sexual longing still remains, even after Lester
has become a better personš.  He also loves his wife (quite
obviously, from their couch scene), and that doesnšt disappear,
either.  This is three-dimensional writing at its best, and
the magnetic Spacey makes it unforgettable.
Three specific moments mark AMERICAN BEAUTY -- along
with everything else I have said -- best film of the Fall,
and year, thusfar:  Rickyšs final, mental revenge against
his father; perfect.  The long, aforementioned close-up of a
plastic bag, with voice-over; perfect.  And, in the warm,
poignant scene between Lester and the underage object of his
affection, when she asks him how his life has been; Spaceyšs
expression, reflecting back, the way it curls into a triumphant
smile moved me to tears.
Bravo to Adam Bellšs uninhibited, progressively interesting
screenplay.  Bravo to a stellar ensemble.  Bravo to myriad
inevitable Oscar nods.  AMERICAN BEAUTY reminds us, above all,
the vitality of indisputably great cinema.
    Best line:  "I'm looking for the least possible amount

Review for Lola rennt (1998)
     Once the technique - same scenario, three different
ways ­ has been established, RUN LOLA RUN loses its novelty
effect.  Thatšs unfortunate, as Tom Tykweršs tale of lovers
against the clock, I think, had some degree of potential.
Then again, what more is actually going on, here, than device?
Lola (Franka Potente) is given a very specific deadline by her
boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreau):  show up at a phone booth
downtown with 100,000 deutsche marks in exactly 20 minutes, or
he will rob a supermarket across the street.  He owes this sum ­
which was hastily left behind by him on a subway train ­ to a
gangster, forget why, whom he fears will kill him if not produced.
Lola insists (screams, actually) that he not do anything rash,
and vows to come up with the money, somehow, on her own in time
to save him.  What follows is a series of montages with red-haired
Lola running furiously down the streets of Berlin, seeking out
her father for a loan, and the several different outcomes of
various strangers she encounters along the way.
I enjoyed the filmmakeršs style, up to a point, using smash-
cuts and animation and continuous techno music to create a dizzying,
breathless atmosphere.  It works, invigorates us, and then quickly
fizzles.  Why?  The film is a mere 80-something minutes long, and
shouldšve been able to sustain its energy.  But, somehow, it
doesnšt.  One too many "and, then.." segments, perhaps; or, little
to no actual character arc (though, how much can one reasonably
expect from this premise).  I found myself not caring in the least
whether or not Lola would make it to her destination as scheduled,
or the outcome of a subplot involving her father and his mistress,
while at the same time admiring the filmšs construction.  Flip-
flopping time lines are always intriguing, and RUN LOLA RUN is
playful in this regard.  My favorite sequences are the purgatory-
esque ones between Lola and Manni, after one of them has been
killed; the dialogue is simple and contemplative when all we do
is lay in bed and listen to these characters speculate on the
importance, one way or another, of their relationship.  There is
also a rather feverish scene in a casino, which contains the single
funniest line of dialogue, and acts as a sort of culmination for
every ounce of steam the film has spent its time working up.
More often than not, though, the film refuses to rest.  Not
necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but after a while I just got
antsy:  see the old lady on the phone who needs shampoo; see Lola
run; watch as the street people have their fates altered depending
on whether cartoon Lola can avoid the dog on the staircase.
The film explores almost every single angle of the plot, leaving
nothing to question about any of it, until all wešre left with is
inventive editing.  Had RUN LOLA RUN been half as ingenious with
its story, as it is, for the most part, with its storytelling,
this couldšve been a remarkable achievement.
     Best line:  comes when Lola is trying to get in to the casino;
she asks how this works, and the clerk says something along the
lines of, "You put money down for chips, and then gamble it away."

Title
Review for American Pie (1999)
    In trying to give proper praise to AMERICAN PIE, the drop-dead funniest
film of 1999, I compare it to other recent teen comedies, like CANšT HARDLY
WAIT and SHEšS ALL THAT.  Movies which have zero ambition, go for the cheap,
easy laugh and nothing more, and dare not delve into the intricacies of what
adolescent sexual confusion might actually entail.  Movies concerned with
plot contrivance (will the geeky guy get the prom queen; will the girl be
able to figure out a devious bet against her, in time to fall in love), and
nothing that has to do with real life.
AMERICAN PIE puts them right in their place, with honesty and
unparalleled situational humor - embarrassing and rude as it may be.  Simply
put, this movie rocks.  Not about anything in particular, PIE focuses on a
group of high school guys who, three weeks before graduation, vow to lose
their virginity as of prom night, out of dignity if nothing else; because,
"Itšs tradition.  Like the Rose Bowl."  Oz (or Nova, played by a marvelous
Chris Klein) starts off the cliché misogynist pig jock, but then joins the
school choir, in hopes of wooing the pretty Heather (Mena Suvari), only to
realize his sensitive side.  Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) already has a
girlfriend, Vicky (the sexy Tara Reid), but shešs holding out for just the
right time to consummate their relationship; "Itšs not a Space Shuttle
launch.  Itšs sex" love that line.  Jim (a break-through Jason Biggs) has a
slight crush on foreign exchange student Nadia, but faces more complicated
issues with masturbation, mainly on the homefront, to wonderful comic
result; the uncomfortable discussions with his father (a sly Eugene Levy),
about the birds and bees, are perfect gems of comic timing.
Will they succeed in getting laid?  No matter.  What makes AMERICAN PIE
great is its intrinsic sweetness.  Even the narrow-minded Stifler (Seann W.
Scott), who accidentally drinks "pale ale", has a core of innocence ­
albeit, buried far beneath an abrasive exterior.  Perverted and lewd, at
times, the film remains not mean or bitter in the least.  You want these
guys and girls to find happiness, or as much as one can reasonably expect to
find at that age.  Every character is thoroughly likeable, which is kind of
rare in a film like this.  I think, again, back to CANšT HARDLY WAIT, from
earlier this year, in which just about every one of the characters was
immature and selfish, and compare it to AMERICAN PIE, full of real and
genuine people experiencing more truthful trials of growing up.  There isnšt
a comparison to be made, really.
I like the way Kevin goes the distance to please Vicky, and their
exploration of sexual satisfaction; you donšt see many teen comedies where
both the male and female party concentrates respective attention on the
otheršs personal gratification.
I also found Ozšs slow progression into true romantic kind of endearing.
And, not to be overlooked, is the filmšs overt raunch.  I laughed my ass
off during Finchešs (Eddie Kay Thomas) bout with uncontrollable diarrhea in
the girlšs bathroom.  Jim copulating with the titular centerpiece comes in a
close second.  And, I especially love Alyson Hanniganšs (doing her Willow
bit) band dork, who gets the two biggest guffaws during the concluding
post-prom party. The film originally garnered an NC-17 rating for its
full-bore graphic content, but all that does is minimize the heart of
AMERICAN PIE - a true-blue coming of age tale.  The script, by Adam Herz, is
audacious and perceptive, while at the same time smart and sophisticated and
surprisingly gentle.  The actors are amicable and seem to be having a good
time.
If the movie falters, itšs by ending on such a feel-good note.  By then,
it makes no real difference, however, as AMERICAN PIE has proved itself a
raucous hit.  Go!

Review for Lake Placid (1999)
     "I just have this feeling that everything is completely safe," 
says the local sheriff, late in LAKE PLACID.  I don't think anyone 
in the film, or watching it, would disagree with him
This has got to be one of the worst creature flicks ever, because 
its creature, a giant crocodile, is so terribly lifeless.  Timid, too:  
a character played by Oliver Platt (he's an, um, croc-spert) is swimming 
very slowly backward, away from his subject, the crocodile following 
closely, and never once is there an attack at the opportune time.  Later, 
Bridget Fonda - forgive me, actual character names didn't stick - is 
engaged is some kind of underwater battle (and, BTW, when you finally 
do resurface, maybe be more out of breath so we can at least pretend you 
were down there that long) with the crocodile, as it languorously 
swings open its long jaws just at the potential victim's feet, but only 
tries for the kill once Fonda is safely behind a tree big enough only 
to shroud her tiny frame.  Could she outswim the beast, when we've already 
seen it swiftly lunge ashore and drag both a cow and a bear into the
water?  Not likely.  But, there's a trend:  no actor with star billing 
is killed.  Or, severely injured; not one of them.  Only in the beginning, 
with a diver tagging beaver, and then with a town deputy, do deaths occur.  
Ok - I sound morbid; don't mean to, it's just that with something that moves
as quickly as this crocodile does on land, to have it be so laidback
and non-threatening the rest of the time, namely during confrontations 
with most of the cast, is boring.  Earlier, the Platt character explains 
that freshwater crocs do not usually attack _in_ the water.  So, what about 
the aforementioned diver?  Or, Fonda's narrow escape?
Contradictions in logic aside, LAKE has a pleasant, sunny look, and 
some witty, insult-laden dialogue for Fonda.  All of which is cute, while 
it lasts; you can literally feel the film run out of energy and resources 
and plot, and then all but evaporate from the screen.  100 minutes seems 
like 30, here, because there's nothing going on.  And, every time our
monster makes an appearance, the effect is that of a wet blanket thrown 
over a wet blanket.  It moves too slow, but maybe that's because of it's 
age (150 years, we are told); plus, there was all that swimming from Asia.  
And, when it takes to land, it will thrash about, chomping every which 
direction, but will not make contact.  How unbelievably dull.
     Best line:  hard to choose one more ridiculous than, "Don't throw 
heads at me!"

Title
Review for Eyes Wide Shut (1999)
     I must admit to being completely distracted a good ten or twelve
minutes into EYES WIDE SHUT, the film that took forever and a day to
complete.  Therešs been such a great mystique about it, and so much written
and gossiped and hypothesized, for so damn long ­ the film was practically
created on the internet ­ that to be seeing the finished
product, finally, was something of an event.  And, in a word:  wow.
The very first image, of Nicole Kidman gradually and teasingly exposing
her full figure from the back, is at once voyeuristic, kinky and poignant.
Which kind of describes up the picture, as a whole.  The couple, Bill (Tom
Cruise) and Alice (a vulnerable, esoteric Kidman) prepare casually for a
Christmas party in Manhattan; she asks his opinion of her
looks, from the toilet seat, and he tells her she is beautiful, "always
beautiful", without actually looking.  Itšs a nice, efficient set-up,
explaining in little time the state of a nine-year marriage.  Bill doesnšt
have to question or doubt his wifešs loyalty, nor her beauty; she, and it,
have always been there.  Over the course of the party, husband and wife
go their separate ways, and both are approached by individuals with more on
their minds than small talk.  Alice, buzzed from champagne, dances with an
older man who suggests it would be only natural for her to cheat, because
that is to be expected in a marriage.  Advice acknowledged, she cordially
declines his offer; she doesnšt give in to advances, drunk or otherwise, but
she almost seems willing to, nevertheless, in spite of herself.  Bill seems
readier to stray, arm in arm with two pretty models,
but also doesnšt, though for reasons which have nothing to do with
faithfulness.  Duty calls, instead, with a naked girl upstairs who has had
"a bad reaction" to narcotics and booze.
Back home, later, the couple gets stoned ­ she much more than he ­ and
have an open, intimate discussion about sexual possibilities and diversions;
mostly pertaining to people outside their marriage.  As a gorgeous, deep
blue emanates from the bathroom (evocative to the mood of the dialogue)
against Kidman in her underwear, the conversation quickly becomes heated and
defensive.  It is here, and in other places, too, that all those reported
multiple takes truly pays off.  The couplešs revealing talk sounds raw and
genuine and true; it has a valid, middle of
the night feel, when youšve been talking for hours and all thatšs left is
the heart of the matter.  Alice - and this is where Kidman (lovely, and sad)
shines ­ recounts a chance encounter from the past, involving herself and a
young officer of the Navy.  Nothing happened, but it couldšve, and she would
have given everything in her life that she knows or holds dear
to not have let that moment pass.  So, what holds/held her back?  The
obvious answer would be family and marriage, but watch Kidmanšs face all
through her characteršs confession, and you sense itšs something much deeper
than that.  Much deeper than what Bill accepts as general fact.  Alice would
not betray him, that one time, but now it seems more likely.
The idea pisses him off; that a single, solitary fleeting glance had
the potential to forever alter the course of their relationship is scary.
They are conveniently interrupted by a phone call from a patient of Billšs,
whose father has just died, and he leaves to console the woman.  And, during
the remainder of the long late night, he imagines his wife in the arms of
another.  We see his perception change, his cool demeanor slowly dissolve,
with each of the people he will come in to contact with.
Everything, every interaction, appears to revolve around sex.  The
woman who called is distraught, when Bill meets her, and she channels her
grief through sexual desire and a false declaration of love; the scene, on
the very bed of the deceased man, is funny and morose.  A hooker (an
alluring Vanessa Shaw) invites Bill to her place for sex, but the two share
nothing more than a soft kiss (and itšs, by the way, one of the best
looking close-ups Išve seen).  An old friend from med school (played by Todd
Field), who dropped out and is now a pianist working various gigs, tells of
a covert meeting place for men and women who wear cloaks and masks and
participate in acts like nothing hešs ever seen before.  Intrigued, and
against his friendšs better advice, Bill picks up a costume
to wear to the gathering, at a store run by an odd man, who first rebukes
the activities of his underage daughter, but will later extend an indirect
proposition to Bill for some of the same.
There is a distinct air of artificiality to the lives of these
strangers, this environment, somehow making Alicešs earlier admission all
the more profound; grounded.  And, as Billšs own marital devotion is called
into question and tested, time and again ­ culminating with the filmšs most
controversial sequence, at a strange, ritualistic orgy ­ EYES WIDE SHUT
develops into a rather shattering and mature meditation on whether or not we
really know our partner ­ ourselves, for that matter ­ and how much.
Speaking of the orgy sequence, I would like tošve seen the unabridged
version, because those much-debated 65 seconds, or so, carry the promise of
total erotic mischievousness.  The point is that Bill is witnessing things
he shouldnšt, or would be better off not seeing (like the pedophilia, that
has come before), and even one of the masked women at the party seems to
know it, though they remain completely anonymous to one another.  How
fitting is it, then, that this faceless person saves Bill from dire
consequences of his unauthorized visit.  From himself:  what is he doing?
Is he at this place because it turns him on to be, or is
being there a means of not dealing with newfound jealousy, and confusion?
Or, both?  He has come to Alicešs moment in time, and is rescued against his
will.  Which leads a tender moment between husband and wife, late in the
film, when the tables are turned and it is he who confesses to near sexual
indiscretion.
The orgy has since been remodeled, adding meticulously placed digital
figures, to escape the dreaded NC-17 rating, but I canšt for the life of me
see why the filmmakers felt it necessary to do so.  The film is head-to-toe
thoroughly adult; censoring even a tiny portion doesnšt make sense,
besides securing a wider audience.  EWS is strictly for the 17 and older age
range; Tom Cruise is a huge box office draw:  distribute the film in its
original, intended form, and people would still go.  Even still, I like what
was done; the orgy sequence does not seem real, anyway.  Itšs a fevered
daydream of libidinous imagery and flesh, screwing for the sake of screwing,
and feels kind of otherworldly.  We get just enough of a view of what is
being done, to figure out whatšs going on, and thatšs fine.  The censorship
- ugly word, but thatšs what it is ­ in no way detracts from the tone EWS
has worked so competently to establish by that point.
This is one of the best films of the year, provocative and intelligent.
It has been impeccably lit, be it the numerous arrays of bright yellows that
accompany the opening Christmas party and within Bill and Alicešs upscale
apartment, or the lush reds and neon greens along the streets Bill roams
aimlessly.  EYES WIDE SHUT is beautiful to look at.  The cast is solid,
most notably Vanessa Shaw, and Sydney Pollack as the enigmatic confidant who
sets the record straight on a few crucial events for Bill (or, does he?).
But, itšs Kidman, I think, who holds the movie together.  Her screen
time is nothing compared to that of Cruise, but she plays all of it with
nuance and precision.  Her pot-induced "millions of years of evolution"
monologue is a perfect example of timing and subtlety; Alice is altogether
happy and dissatisfied with her life ­ who isnšt ­ and struggling to figure
out why.  Or, maybe I was struggling to.  The performance is a revelation
for Kidman, last seen in the awful PRACTICAL MAGIC, and worthy of Oscar
consideration.
Some scenes seem a bit out of place, like the skin-bare tryst set to a
Chris Isaak song.  And, the flirtation between Cruise and the female
roommate of a prostitute who has been diagnosed HIV positive.  But they,
alike all others here, compound what is, for all the waiting and hype, an
elegant and mesmeric motion picture.

Review for Perfect Murder, A (1998)
As antiquated as the formula is, I'm surprised Hollywood keeps it
around: wife cheats on abusive spouse and, instead of leaving him,
convinces her lover to kill him so they can be together and get all
his money.  Or, roles can be switched and jealous husband can be the
one doing the plotting.  As is the case with MURDER, nicely conceived
and gamely acted.
Douglas plays a businessman, Steven Taylor.  His business is about to
go bankrupt.  His wife, Emily (Paltrow), is having an affair with a
painter across town, named David (the expressionless Mortensen).  They
plan to let Steven in on it - she more than he: "It's not fair to
him".  But, Steven is no dupe.  Though, how he knows, or even
suspects, enough to have the two photographed during an afternoon
rendezvous, is never explained.
Standard stuff.  But, the movie has smart, thinking individuals.  Like
Douglas, who has his plan to do away with his wife down to how and why
to do what with keys.  And, Mortensen - a scamster - who agrees to do
the "wet work", but has plans, also.  Every detail of the murder plot,
and the complications that inevitably arise, seems to be coherent and
logical, and it's kind of fun watching the genre played out
intelligently for once.
I liked someof the physical acting between Paltrow and Mortensen, as
during an art exhibition where he sees her, starts walking toward her
and she inconspicuously waves him off.  Then, once they've met in the
corner, and Douglas comes upon them, they act completely natural and
never give any sort of nervous reaction that maybe he knows.
And I liked the way Douglas seemed to have everything figured out, and
together.  He's able to verbally explain his motives with well- chosen
words.  I like dialogue where people come at the subject of discussion
from not just one angle, but think a situation through, think about
every possibility.  MURDER has that kind of banter.
I just wish the film had been about more.  I kept waiting for it to
ask questions movies like this never ask.  For instance, why does the
Paltrow character keep saying it's not fair to her husband to keep her
affair a secret?  As if she's concerned about how he feels.  I'm
wondering why she would've had the affair in the first place, and not
worry about how it may or may not affect him, and why it would only
hit her a good ways into the affair to at least let him know about it.
Does she love her husband?  People don't usually get married
otherwise, right?  And if she does love him, how much or how little
that she can't try and work things out?  Or, _has_ she tried?  Does
she care about whether or not she has hurt him, or that she'll hurt
him again?  Steven doesn't seem like such a bad guy (of course, he
_is_, but that's only later on).  He's rich.  He likes being rich,
gives him a certain air of superiority (at one point he tells Paltrow
which dress to wear - so, you know he's a real creep).  Maybe he makes
her feel small, and insecure, but has it always been that way?  How
did it _get_ that way?  Also, there's no tangible chemistry between
Paltrow and Mortensen, furthering my question into
why-is-she-with-either- man territory.
The same goes for Douglas' character.  He has multiple reasons for
wanting his wife dead, not just the obvious (which, come to think,
isn't really a reason at all, considering what he's most worried
with).  But, why is he married to her?
It's an inconsequential line of inquiry in the end, I guess, but
wouldn't answering such questions - or even addressing them - give the
film a little more dramatic depth?  Of course, that would make a
longer movie.  But hey, attention spans do exist.
And why, oh why, do they have to revert to a violent ending?  I saw a
movie once called, I believe, LADY BEWARE.  It starred Diane Lane.
The storyline wasn't quite the same, but it, too, could have ended in
a violent way.  Instead, it chose a more subtle approach that was
much, much more effective.  A PERFECT MURDER deserved one of those,
because it has a lot going for it already.  -R-

Title
Review for Hard Target (1993)
     For just a couple of years now, a certain film director has been
doing for action films what Marisa Tomei did earlier this year for the
"love interest" character in film--breathing life into it.  If you've
not guessed by now, the man I'm talking about is none other than John
Woo.  The only problem is that Mr. Woo has been doing his thing over in
Japan, and not in the U.S. of A.  Woo's THE KILLER had so much word of
mouth in Japan, that once the film arrived in the states in 1990 it was
welcomed with a massive dose of critical praise.  Well, the wait is
finally over.  John Woo is here, and his American debut goes the
distance to prove that he is here to stay.
     The story is particularly simple:  A Vietnam vet is murdered by a
group of trigger-happy hunters--partial to that race of human
beings--and the man's daughter goes looking for him.  It seems he was
homeless, and to get the proper tour of her father's homeland, the
daughter enlists the help of a down-and-out sailor named Chance
Beaudreaux (played by Van Damme).  Chance needs two-hundred bucks to
ship out of New Orleans, and figures that by taking this young and
innocent woman up on her offer, he can get what he needs.  To convince
her that he's the man for the job, Chance fights away some homeless
thugs looking to rip Natalie(the daughter, played by Yancy Butler) off
of a few hundred dollars, using his fists and feet to crush bones like
nothing you've ever seen in a Van Damme movie before.
     Natalie is definitely convinced.  She and Chance soon discover
that her father was murdered, and this leads them to cross paths with
the leader of the afore-mentioned group (played by Lance Henriksen).
*and* we get another murder-of-a-homeless scene.  The vet who's killed
this time is someone Chance knew as a friend, and--well, you can
probably figure out the rest.
     The story *is* simple at heart, but it isn't really the story
that's important here--it's the story*telling*.  This is a dynamite
action film.  Director John Woo uses techniques--like slow-mo,
quick-cut, and freeze frame--that other directors have either taken for
granted or have been too afraid to use, and creates an entirely new
kind of action movie that most American audiences have never seen
before.  It's exciting stuff, and it has a truly explosive impact to it
(especially in the climax, at an empty warehouse in the bayous).  The
characterizations *do* leave much to be desired--Van Damme has one
grimacing expression plastered on his mug at all times (does this guy
*ever* smile...?), and Yancy Butler doesn't have much to do here--but,
again, these things are nothing more than serviceable to John Woo's
unique directorial style.  He's a master at this kind of movie making.
     If you see HARD TARGET, but still want more Woo, check out some of
his earlier Japanese work (like THE KILLER and HARD BOILED).  These
movies all have one thing in common: a superior artist at work.  I can
compare Woo with Quentin Tarantino in that the two are fresh forces in
Hollywood who do not need or want to concede with any Hollywood
standards.  TARGET's ear-slicing scene had to be trimmed in order for
the film to attain an R-rating.  And perhaps that's saying something,
too.  Woo has a little to learn about the United States as far as
movies are concerned, and the MPAA and censorship.  But it's far from
too late, and if Woo keeps up the good work he might even be able to
break down the MPAA's standards on violence in the movies.

Review for True Lies (1994)
CAST:  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton,
       Art Malik, Tia Carrere
DIRECTOR:  James Cameron
SCREENPLAY:  James Cameron
CINEMATOGRAPHY:  Russel Carpenter  /  VE:  Digital Domain
RUNNING TIME:  2:19
RELEASE  --  July 15, 1994
     In the midst of an unusually less-exorbitant summer than past
years have seen comes TRUE LIES, the latest collaboration between two
science-fiction-action minds that marks a change of pace for Director
James Cameron and a return to form for his mega-superstar.  Their part
James Bond-esque thriller opus, part black comedy opens and closes with
manic destruction, and intelligently leaves behind a hugely lame
mid-plot that wouldn't seem to fit in the explosive universe of *any*
gratuitously exciting spectacle such as this.
     It's relatively clear what Cameron is aiming for: An average
working man (Schwarzenegger) living a life of big-time violence by day
and mundane family life by evening.  His wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis)
has absolutely no idea the kinds of things he does while they're
apart--running from terrorists across snowy mountainous landscapes in
Switzerland, fist fighting Arabs in bathrooms.  She just knows his
career as Sales Rep. for a computer company is keeping him at work and
away from her and their daughter way too much, too often when it counts
most.  This monologue (apparently derived from a French film) is fine
and good; not terribly original, not terribly without farce.
Unfortunately, Director/Screenwriter Cameron feels it necessary to up
the stakes, supplying a potentially straight-forward action lover's
dream-come-true with a moronic subtext of infidelity that starts
awkwardly and ends up borderline tasteless.
     It seems as though Hellen, the wife Harry Tasker has taken for
granted throughout the 15 years of their marriage, has gotten rather
exhausted with just being the 'good wife.'  She wants to role-play,
find and bring to life the adventure she's inexcusably let pass her
by.  The possibility is handed her by a smug wimp named Simon, who
convinces Helen he is some sort of secret agent when actually he's
nothing more than a lowly car salesman.  Simon rips bravery off others,
gives it his name and delivers the package to women totally bored with
home life and (more to the point) their gutless husbands.  That's his
angle, and it works perfectly.  Only this time Simon has picked just
the wrong woman for his jwa' de' vive' (can you tell I'm not French)
because Helen isn't only loyal and unchangeably devoted, she's married
to the real thing--a super-spy with a pension for brutality.
     Difficult as it is to put up with such debris, we keep trudging
along for we know exactly what will be rewarded us in the end.
However, this black comedy half of the film is worth some negative
comment.  Once Harry finds out what his wife is up to (what he *thinks*
is going on), he appears wind-stripped like nothing any terrorist could
ever culprit.  His esteemed colleague Gib (played by Tom Arnold)
notices and comments that affairs are a part of marriage, but being the
good friend he is wants to cheer up a pal: "We're gonna catch some
terrorists, beat the crap out of them.  You'll feel a hell of a lot
better."  That's funny.  What isn't so cute is Harry's explicit
investigation into his wife's goings-on from that point on; tracking
her, tapping her phone and ultimately--in this film's true low point--
sacking her head, locking her in a dark room and interrogating her.
Helen moves from terror to tears during this out-stretched, difficult
to watch sequence that builds a major wall against any sort of
satisfying outcome the film might want to reach ... might have done so
successfully.  Luckily, the wise-cracking Tom Arnold is around to
smooth the path every now and again.  If not for him, what has to be
some 35-minutes of degrading nonsense (including a husband's sexual
fantasia watching his wife strip-tease around a bed post) would be
intolerable.
     TRUE LIES comes to during its back half, in which Harry has to
save his wife and country from a psychotic Arab liberalist.  Reportedly
this film cost as much as our national debt to make, and it inebriates
us during a fantastic limo rescue scene (Schwarzenegger dangling from a
helicopter and pulling Curtis from an impossibly-moving car, just
before it crashes to the ocean's surface) and an even more spectacular
sequence, featuring Schwarzenegger at the helm of a marine harrier,
that ranks with Renny Harlin's CLIFFHANGER opening as one of the very
best jaw-droppers in film history.
     When Schwarz landed that baby, I wanted to forget what came before
it.  I really did.  But I couldn't.  James Cameron's first (I believe)
production outside the science-fiction realm--in which he's master--is
a mock epic, giving trivial events monumental proportions.  It's not
only unnecessary to the final conclusion ... it's a little sick.  I'm
not sure at what point Cameron lost his way writing this thing, found
it detrimental not to stoop, but despite what's wrong here is a whole
lot to gaze at and laugh at.  TRUE LIES is one humongous detonated
bomb, with no story to back it up.

Review for Fight Club (1999)
     Granted:  youšve never seen anything quite like FIGHT
CLUB.  Based on the cerebral, kick-ass novel by Chuck
Palahniuk, CLUB takes on a slew of issues, ranging from
materialism to moral decay.  It is visually stunning, quick,
smart, stimulating, a visceral powerhouse.  But, the film seems
to meander; too many themes bouncing off one another, priorities
misplaced, characters wandering aimlessly between brutal hand-
to-hand choreography and passive philosophizing.  Therešs
terrific material, here, let it be said -- just, a bit on the
disorganized side.
And, then I went back.  Had to; less intoxicated.  Bits
and pieces stuck with me as great, but not the whole, which
kind of baffled me since I absolutely loved the book.  Watching
a second time, the film is still scatterbrain.  Itšs also
spectacular cinema. Boldly directed by David Fincher (SEVEN is
one of the best, genre redefining, ever) -- a filmmaker who
consistently tests the limits of his medium -- FIGHT CLUB
focuses on insomniac every-man Narrator (Edward Norton, in a
performance that is nothing short of amazing) and his inadvertant
quest for self-improvement.  He starts with support groups, of
all disease and abnormality, where a hug from someone worse off
than you is just the thing for a good nightšs sleep.  Meets
Marla (a wild eyed Helena Bonham-Carter), who goes for the free
coffee, plus itšs less expensive than movies; a łfaker˛.  Then,
Tyler (another of our best and brightest, Brad Pitt), a social
nuisance who sells homemade soap at twenty bucks a bar to
finance militant uprising.  Narrator, or Jack, makes his most
resolute bond with Tyler; łHow much can you know about yourself
if youšve never been in a fight?˛  They beat the shit out of
each other, one night, in a parking lot and come to share the
same primal instinct:  emotional release via bodily harm.  As
Tyler puts it, you hit rock bottom when, and only if, you push
yourself physically beyond yourself, to rise above.  Spiritual
discovery, if you will; pain equals destruction, and destruction
equals awakening.  Hešs the rebellious alter ego to Jack, and
anyone for that matter daring enough to lose everything in order
to gain control.  Because, once youšve gotten low as you can
possibly get, the only direction is up.  Point taken.  That
perspective made him an intriguing character in Palahniukšs
brilliant novel, and it works, here, as well.
Both relationships mesmerize, and the ultra-faithful
script by Jim Uhlšs is quirky, witty and biting.  Not to mention
stunningly funny.  You can forget subtlety, though; FIGHT CLUBšs
grim and abrasive, virulent on top of its sometimes easy-goingness.
Wouldnšt have it any other way.  A łthree pitcher˛ bout amongst
friends draws attention, and quickly becomes Saturday night
ritual, relocated to bar basements where men join willingly to
pulverize one another.  No membership fees; each man, regardless
how worthless or respectable his lot in life, deific for a moment
or two of bare fisted suffering.  A sensation that turns into a
nationwide thing, existing łbetween the hours fight club starts
and the hours after fight club ends˛ according to Nortonšs droll,
eloquent voice-over.  Because, the first rule is... blah, blah.
Whatšs great about the novel (one thing, anyway) and here,
too, is that these savage little get togethers are a starting
place for something on more grand a scale.  Recruitment for
vandals and nihilists who believe łlosing all hope˛ is freedom.
Tyler starts Project Mayhem, and passes out homework assignments
which include initiating random fights.  Funny montage.  And,
how could you not like Jackšs contribution to the cause -- a
memorable scene, where Norton kicks his own ass before his
traumatized boss, leading to łcorporate sponsorship˛.
Itšs about damning the consumer mentality, getting a new
perspective, łfinding something out˛.  FC also has perhaps the
most playful story about the human psyche Išve ever seen, and
a realistic depiction of insomnia (ever had it, then you know).
łNothingšs real˛ is true; wastebasket contents and airplane food
take on a certain strange profound meaning.  łYoušre never really
asleep, and youšre never really awake˛, and hallucinations are
not unlikely.  Tyler may be one.  Jack may.  Lose sleep, days
on end, you get a distinct sense of futility, like nothing you
thought mattered really does.  You look for purpose; significance
in the world.  Anything to give yourself reprieve; God, Išve
been there.  Which is why Jack becomes a junkie to twelve-step
meetings.  Why he
listens to his inner misfit, gives his undivided attention (for
a while) and follows orders.  Seriously:  whenšs the last time
two sides of the same personality were this fully characterized?
Wasnšt sure how Fincher and team would pull off the infamous
plot twist, but... damn, job well done.  Allusion is perfection,
as with Jack thinking aloud during his solo tussle, łFor some
reason, I was reminded of my first fight with Tyler.˛  Marlašs
morning-after comment to Jack, łI can hardly believe anything
about last night.˛  A sex scene, in suspended animation, that
blurs the manšs face.  Or, one of Nortonšs very first lines in
the film:  łI know this, because Tyler knows this.˛  Fun stuff,
even if you already know whatšs going down.
Acting-wise?  What can you say..  Pittšs an experimentalist,
which fits in, whatever the project (MEET JOE BLACK excepted).
He takes risks, and you sense it every second hešs on screen.
Brit-beauty Carter -- accent gone, lady-like demeanor trashed --
isnšt so much in a performance, as a character sketch, but it
works.  I liked her scenes with Norton; the way he hasnšt caught
on, yet, and treats her by turns coldly and with affection.  She
doesnšt push it, or overplay.  Shešs manic, alright, but not out
of context.  Plus, as Marla, grunge never looked so delectable
(nor has it made me want a cigarette more in my life).  Then,
therešs Edward Norton.  Enough canšt be said about his work in
FIGHT CLUB, so Išll simply put it:  if no Academy notice comes
of what he has done in this film, consider the lot of them
unconscious.  He is out there, charismatic, assailable, naive,
alive with screen presence and non-assumption.  Beside giving
one of the best movie narrations (second only to Ray Liotta, in
GOODFELLAS), he nails every nuance of the character from
Palahniukšs scathing novel, and then some.  His scenes with
Carter, Jack defensive when Marla invades his space, are humorous
and kind of sexy.  They split up nights at therapy, so neither
gets exposed; he is resentful, because she sees through him,
and protective of his territory (łThis chick, Marla Singer,
did not have testicular cancer.˛) but drawn to her, also,
because shešs kindred.  Same respect:  Norton and Pitt have
chemistry to spare.  Much of their time spent is gruesome -- one
scene, with Pitt drizzling blood on a manšs face, is gory
beyond words; another, Norton pummeling a helpless youngster
into oblivion, features about the queasiest close-up of a mangled
face as I think Išve ever seen.  But, both stars shine in quieter
moments, like their first meeting on a plane, and later when
they make liposuctioned fat soap together.  Big names; no egos.
From its brain-tour opener (and BTW, one of these days,
cool title sequences are going to be refered to as Fincherian),
backed by a driving Dust Brothers selection, on, the furiously
entertaining FIGHT CLUB has masterpiece written all over it.
Unanswered questions?  You betšcha.  If Tyler knows what he is,
whatšs the ultimate goal?  Just cause chaos and/or remake Jack
from the inside out?  And, where _did_ Jack learn to make explosives
that way?  Was he born knowing it and didnšt realize or start
utilizing the technique till now, what?

Review for Sliver (1993)
     Before BASIC INSTINCT, did you even know her name?  For a long
while in Hollywood, a name had been floating around that no one could
actually place a name with.  With such titles as STARDUST MEMORIES,
IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES, and the ALAN QUARTERMAIN movies to her
name, who could be blamed for not taking recognition.  But then, a
funny thing happened:  A director named Paul Verhoeven saw potential in
this sensual blond beauty, and took a chance on her.  BASIC INSTINCT
was a smash success and, although it displayed no "raw" talent in the
acting department for her, the film acted as a huge boost and stepping
stone in her very unsure career in Hollywood.  Of course, I am speaking
of none other than Sharon Stone.  Her interrogation scene in INSTINCT
has become one of the most infamous images in the history of cinema.
It also said that there was, indeed (finally), an actress in the
business who was willing to take risks.
     Stone's second opportunity to prove herself as a serious actress
has also (like BASIC INSTINCT) turned out to be very controversial work
for this budding talent.  But is the movie *good*?  The answer is a
resounding ... well, not really.
     Stone stars as Carly Norris, a recently divorced book editor who
moves into a sliver high-rise in Manhattan.  There she meets three
different men, one of whom dies in the shower soon after the film
begins.  The other two--author, and tenant respectively--are played
by Tom Berenger and William Baldwin.  Both men lust after Carly, Jack
Landsford (Berenger) a bit more than he should.  So, Carly chooses the
younger and more attractive Zeke Hawkins (Baldwin), leading the two of
them to several erotic encounters which had to be trimmed in order to
avoid an NC-17.  Jack's jealous, instantly accusing Zeke of a number of
murders that have occurred in the building over the past couple years.
*no*, Zeke says--It was Jack.  So begins the blame game.  Ahh ... what's
a girl to believe?
     In a way, this film seems like the perfect murder-mystery- sex
thriller (it has just the right feel to it that any sort of thriller
needs).  A good opening track by Enigma sufficiently sets the correct
mood for this techno-thriller, but the film loses steam as it nears the
halfway mark.  Stone is marginally better here than she was in BASIC
INSTINCT, but just about the time the film reaches its midpoint, Stone
begins to look tired, unhappy, confused as to why she got involved with
this project in the first place.  Too many reshoots, too much
controversy over quarreling between the leads off-screen, and Tom
Berenger overacting like never before don't help save this film when it
needs saving the most.
CRITICAL RATING:  ** Rated R, for Violence, Profanity, Nudity, Sex

Title
Review for Deep Blue Sea (1999)
     There is a special-effects second or two in DEEP BLUE
SEA that makes the rest of the film stick out like a sore
thumb.  Samuel L. Jackson rambles incoherently, beginning
to raise his voice (in true SLJ fashion), about a botched...
avalanche mission (?), only to be rudely interrupted mid-
diatribe.  I'm not sure if this was itended as a bit of
self-referential parody - like, even non-human species'
can't stand bad dialogue - but that one, left field jolt
has more wit and humor than a dozen animated sharks or
dismembered bodies which litter the rest of DBS.
I'd like to compliment the local chain where I saw
this film, on Wednesday.  General Cinema, on 6th and Pine,
in Seattle:  great projection/picture quality; vivid color;
great sound; nice, panoramic screen.  Maybe it was just
that I saw one of the first showings of the day, I don't
know.  Sometimes, extraneous elements like these can influence
your viewing experience to the degree you find yourself
enjoying a film - even though, objectively speaking, it
sucks otherwise, probably.  And, I guess that's the case with
DEEP BLUE.  The premise is nifty:  six strangers stuck in
an oceanic research facility, headed by Saffron "could-I-look-
more-bored" Burrows, which is filling up with water, floor by
floor.  "We'll go down, to go up," they decide.  But, how;
what with man-eating Mako at every turn.  Swim 200 feet to the
surface and, having successfully held your breath, there would
still be the sharks to contend with until you've gotten safely
out of the water.  Not to mention avoiding them during the
ascent.  Because they move lightning fast, these sharks, whereas
an average person can only swim "two feet per second".  Not good
odds.  Plan B: stay put, and be killed via the eminent flood, or
a set of razors for teeth, whichever comes first.
The scenario reminded me, in a way, of the husband/wife
scene from THE ABYSS, when they came to the realization that one
of them was going to drown.  DBS has none of that tension or
impact, but the idea's there.
Also, the film looks fabulous.  Visual highlights include a
monkey-bar routine from a ladder, as water rises from below and
fireballs drip from high overhead; an underwater explosion, seen
through a fence; the death of a parrot; an aerial shot of Aquatica,
at sunset.  The shark attacks are explicit (check that twitching
foot), but not over the top; no need to get gross.  The cinema-
tography, I forget who by, is often stunning.
Yet, alas, looks are not everything.  Uh uh, not with this
measure of profoundly stilted dialogue ("Who ya gonna trust?  Me.
Cuz, I'm trust-worthy"), and performances this bland; Thomas Jane
is an expressionless actor - though nowhere the league of Viggo
Mortensen - to avoid... not to self.  The prologue, about reactivating
brain cells, feels profunctory and interminable.  And the action,
when it comes, isn't nearly the envelope-pushing sort I expect from
Renny Harlin (I'm thinking, LONG KISS GOODNIGHT... and scratching
my head).
In an interview, for Entertainment Tonight (I believe),
preceding the movie, Director Harlin described DEEP BLUE SEA as
"JAWS for the next generation".  Nope.

Title
Review for Arlington Road (1999)
    Despite its plethora of unanswered questions, and a loud, grating
performance by Jeff Bridges, ARLINGTON ROAD still turns out to be an
effective thriller.  Sort of.  I was reminded of the film SEVEN (the only
movie that has ever left me shaking), with its claustrophobic atmosphere,
moody score (courtesy the great Angelo Badalamenti), and sense of impending
doom.  SEVEN is a far superior motion picture, but I cannot discount any
film that manages to leave me unnerved.
You know right away that Michael Faraday (an unmercifully one-note
Bridges), who teaches a course on terrorism, and Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins),
the seemingly normal guy next door, are going to have problems.  After
rescuing the his neighboršs young boy ­ and, Išm not sure what this scene
has anything to with the rest of the film ­ Tom quickly suspects wrongdoing.
He is obsessed over the death of his wife, and rants about the evil that are
extremist groups ­ all of which seems to feed some basic paranoia he
harbors.  And, thus begins a film-long quest to find out just why somebody
would lie about where they attended college.
I mentioned loose ends:  this movie has em.  For instance, what does
the opening sequence have to do with anything else that comes after?  I
mean, except to introduce the two men.  And why (SPOILER alert), considering
the overall scheme of things, did Michaelšs girlfriend have to die?  What
was the deal with the blueprint, or whatever it was, hidden behind the
picture frame?  Those computers the villains were driving around with??
And, then ARLINGTON ROAD commits the ultimate cinematic no-no of assuming
that climactic events are going to unfold in just the right way, for the
film to pay off like it wants to, when any number of things could go wrong
to avert that ending.  Not that I have problem with this ending, which comes
completely out of left field, but in a good way.  Išm only saying donšt
cheat the audience.  Had ARLINGTON ROAD played fair, the whole way, it
wouldšve been a terrific entertainment.  Lose Jeff Bridges, or at least tone
him down a few trillion notches, and it wouldšve been one of the yearšs
best.

Title
Review for My Life (1993)
     It was, I believe, just around three years ago that a certain
screenwriter by the name of Bruce Joel Rubin produced what ultimately
became one of the most popular films of the year.  You know the movie.
Add to that one of the most talked about movies of its year, JACOB'S
LADDER, and what you've got is a very talented individual.  Now, in
1993, Rubin has created yet another heart-wrenching and emotionally
stimulating script by the name of MY LIFE.  The difference this time
round is that in addition to writing the film, Rubin is credited with
directorial status in order to give his film the touch of magic it
needs.
     The story surrounds an advertising executive named Bob Jones.  As
the film opens, right from the get-go, Jones has been diagnosed with
cancer in his lungs.  To complicate matters in his life even more, his
wife, Gail (played beautifully by Nicole Kidman), is pregnant with
their first child.  And knowing that he may not be around long enough
to see his baby's birth, Jones decides to video the part of his life he
is currently living so that his child will have something by which to
know him.  A sweet notion.
     However, Bob isn't willing to simply rest on his laurels.  No, he
goes through the full gamut of emotions from denial to confusion to
final acceptance.  This is a wonderful Michael Keaton performance,
totally unlike anything he has shown audiences as of yet.  And not only
does he he bring poignancy to his dying-man role, he brings forth humor
as well, so even the most cynical of cynics can appreciate something
about his performance.  Beside him all the way is Nicole Kidman.
Kidman is a gorgeous actress, always it seems.  And she has never been
prettier than she is in MY LIFE.  Of course, she can also act, and that
gives her role of the wife a touching bit of emotion in itself.  Gail
stands by her husband through the roughest of times, with ample
opportunity to leave at any time if so desired.  But that isn't what
she wants, and Kidman is the right actress to play the part of loving
wife.  When she tells Keaton, "You're the love of my life," we have no
choice but to believe her.
     In a way, MY LIFE is a bit of a let-down.  I kept wanting a little
grit along with all the poignancy, and the bit involving Keaton's toy
shopping spree and rollercoaster ride at a park really have no place in
such an otherwise heart-tugging movie.  But I can't complain; for
everything this film lacks it also has a lot to appreciate and an
awful lot to like.  Just try and keep from smiling when Keaton and
Kidman try hard to get their newborn to sit upright without falling
over.  Just try to keep from crying your eyes out when Keaton finally
tells his father that he loves him.  Just try and not walk away from
this film with an affirmation of life.

Review for South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)
" Southpark: Bigger, Longer, Uncut "  * * *
    Before it runs out of steam toward the end, SOUTHPARK (which
incidentally was cut to secure an R-rating) is the funniest film of the
year.  By default; there havenšt been many comedies, and certainly none this
unabashedly obscene.  And, right from the start, you know youšre in the
hands of a couple filmmakers with a keen sense of humor, as Kyle, Stan,
Cartman and Kenny head off to "a foreign film from Canada", via an hilarious
Disney rip-off show tune called "Mountain Town".  Iconoclasm in place;
politics are next.  The kids canšt get into the new Terrance and Phillip
film, because it is R-rated (for good reason) and theyšre underage.  Tip, if
you find yourself in a similar predicament:  bribe the local bum, and no
movie or ratings restriction is unbeatable.  Good thing they get in, too, as
the incessantly profane five minutes we see next are a riot, full of as many
fart noises and Fš words as Išve seen in that short a time.  Then comes the
hook:  Comedy Central canšt run "Southpark" in all its glory.  So, once the
boys leave their three-hour marathon of more bad language than they know
what to do with, BIGGER, LONGER, is caution-to-the-wind cursing.  Not more
than a lot of other R-rated films from, say, Martin Scorcese ­ like most
people seem to be obsessing about ­ mind you.  But, still; the creativity
with which these small fries spout about is, ah, a might off-setting.
Which takes only a few minutes to desensitize us to what wešre hearing;
I mean, really, you hear ten mutterings of "pig-fucker" or "shit-smeller" (I
may be a little inaccurate with those examples, but you get it), and youšve
heard a lifetime.  So, just being crude wouldnšt be enough.  No, series
creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are not ones to rest on their
considerable laurels, and thus, this SOUTHPARK feature goes a step or two
further with a clever storyline:  the parents of our four young anti-heroes
are shocked by their newfound vocabulary.  A scapegoat is needed, but whom.
Canadians, of course.  War is declared, Terrance and Phillip are taken
hostage and their public execution planned out, and Cartman ­ following his
humorous ditty, "Kylešs Momšs a Bitch", sung by members of several different
nationalities ­ gets a chip put in his head that prevents further use of
foul language through shock treatment.  In the meantime, Kenny suffers his
usual death, goes to hell, where Satan and Sadam Hussein are lovers, and
Satan is a big softie and wants to be able to communicate with his partner
instead of just having sex all the time.  But, nevermind.
SOUTHPARK is entertaining, on top of being sleazy, and that is to be
commended.  Because it didnšt have to be as good as it is, and who knew.
There are a few scratch that, way too many songs (some funny, some blah),
and thatšs why I say the film wears out its welcome.  Before that happens,
though, chances are you wonšt laugh more during any other movie this summer
than you will, here.
Highlights:  Winona Ryderšs performance with a ping-pong ball; the
untimely murder of Bill Gates; that "Uncle Fucker" song from ASSES OF FIRE
(oh.. my.. god); Cartmanšs improvisational use of his neural implant, to
save the day.  And, needless to say, getting to see the true face of Kenny;
canšt beat that.      

Title
Review for Blair Witch Project, The (1999)
     If youšve been paying attention to the media frenzy that
is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and who hasnšt, you know the story
and you know itšs pure dramatization.  Needless to say, though,
watching what has been committed to tape, one gets the undeniable
impression the events are veritable:  three students take hand-
helds into the woods, filming a school project about the myth of
a local witch, and get lost.  No biggie, as the put-upon leader
of their crew, Heather, states rationally, "Itšs hard to get
lost in America, and itšs harder to stay lost."  What starts
out fun and games, so to speak, amongst friends (correct "Gilliganšs
Island" vernacular; Heatheršs mishap with a pair of wet shoes)
quickly becomes something more serious.  Rations dwindle, their
only map disappears, and camaraderie gradually disintegrates into
bickering, nicotine jonesing and total disorientation.  They set
up camp, several times too often, and wake up to vague but ominous
noises just in the distance.  And, thatšs the ingenious thing of
the film:  the heard, yet unseen, proves to be a lot more
terrifying.  Because, try as you may to put whatšs going on into
perspective (twigs snap.. probably a small animal), you still
donšt know for certain.  And, because there is little light for
assistance, you can either stay in one place very quietly and pray,
or make a run for it in the pitch black and take your chances.
During Heatheršs emotionally-draining private confessional for
the camera, she sums this experience up quite nicely: "Išm afraid
to close my eyes, and Išm afraid to open them."
Whatšs also great about the film is its budget.  The point
of view footage is antsy, because the actors get antsy and donšt
know exactly where to look or where theyšre going in the heat of
apparent pursuit.  I think BLAIR WITCH will play even better on
the small screen, because of its aspect ratio and the likelihood
of a more quiet environment; occasionally, I was unable to hear
what the actors were hearing due to an audience loud with throat-
clearing and squeaky seats, and it bugged me immensely.
There is no special effects work, no computer-generated
anything, and mostly no gory close-ups (save for a set of teeth),
which gives the film a great deal of authenticity.  And, what I
like most is the eerie conclusion; that last scene, in an
abandoned, dilapidated house, is nerve-wracking and more than
a little disturbing.  The collective opinion circulating the
net at present is that this scene is too quick, and the film
ends rather abruptly.  Which is true, but thatšs the point.
It is Heatheršs fear and despondence, come to the breaking
point.  After being in the woods for so long, and not knowing
what would ultimately happen to them at any given moment ­ whether
she, or her friends, would make it ­ she and Mike arrive at one
last spot, maze-like and frustrating, and in an instant itšs all
over.  You leave with questions, and want to talk about what
youšve just witnessed with as many people as you can get it in
a room.  Movies that can put you there have done their job; real,
or fake (forget the whole is-it-a-sham-or-not business, already).
That final image ­ you know the one ­ is cryptic and haunting.
I wanted more scenes at night, with ­ not _clearer_ sounds,
but I donšt know, more of them.  Even greater a building of
exhaustion and fear.  The film does not quite go the psychological
distance, but itšs close.  Also, the arguing goes on a little
much for my taste (one fight, over the whereabouts of the map,
turns especially shrill), though such carrying-on is understand-
able, circumstances considered.     
"Scary as hell" no.  Creepy, yes.  Effective, brilliantly-
conceived and executed, and performed with all the conviction in
the world so that even if we doubt what wešre seeing is real,
suspension of disbelief is never an issue:  _oh yeah_.
Best line:  90% improv equals no cleverly constructed
dialogue; I like the reaction Heather has to a shot of scotch (I
hate it, too).

Title
Review for Better Than Chocolate (1999)
     The new les-genda romantic comedy łBetter Than Chocolate˛ has 
a good first act, followed by a rather shitty second, then falls 
apart completely in the third and final.  And, with one scene:  Maggie 
(beautiful red-head Karyn Dwyer), who works in an adult novelty shop, 
has met and fallen for Kim (Christina Cox), a caricature artist; 
Maggiešs mother (played by Wendy Crewson) has moved in with them both, 
unaware the nature of their relationship, and finds them in bed together.  
She asks whatšs going on, and Maggie lashes out.  About feeling controlled 
by mom, and how their different, and this is her life; blah blah.  Itšs a 
valid argument, actually - or, would be - except that the mother has not 
once to that moment said a thing negative toward her daughter, or criticized 
her in any way.  So, the scene plays a mite forced and overwrought.  Kim, 
who was waiting for her lover to fess up about them, mopes off with a łfuck 
you˛, and leaves town; contrived.  There should be another scene, here, of 
the girls arguing just a little longer - more than three seconds, I mean - 
before blowing up at one another and going separate ways.  It gets worse:  
the store where Maggie works has trouble with customs, and in protest, she 
stands naked on window display for the press.  Noone shows up, though, 
aside from gay-bashers who throw flaries into the store, so what was the 
point of doing it that time of night?  And, what was she hoping to prove?  
Maggie hasnšt shown much concern, one way or another, for the whole censorship 
issue (save for a book ice sculpture, donšt ask), nor the storešs welfare.  
So, um... why?  Channeling a bit of emotionally-distraught energy through 
anything but pining futilly over lost love?  I donšt know; unclear.  And, 
why do gay-bashers have to make an appearance (twice, no less) at all?  We 
even get an explosion (how very Hollywood, Trimark) in the end to tidy 
everything up - relationships, everything - and you can just hear that Sarah 
MacLachlan song coming on, as everybody stands around, happy, and our lovers 
reunite at the last second.
     Too much, too much.  łBetter˛ has a distinct s.f.w. air about it, 
almost from first frame to last.  The best thing about it, these two girls, 
shouldšve been the filmšs focalpoint, but they're treated as an afterthought.  
Which is a shame, because Cox (who resembles a grown-up twin from łFull 
House˛) and Dwyer make a nice, sexy couple.  Theyšre attractive, good-
natured and totally into eachother.  But, theyšre forgotten; two indisputably 
erotic sex scenes, and thatšs it.  I especially liked the dance club sequence, 
where the one girl gives the other a rose;  and, the body painting.  But, 
itšs hard to compete with such trite filler:  do we care what Maggiešs 
dingbat mom (fine to be the comic stooge, but show a little intelligence) 
will think of her daughteršs lifestyle?  Or, if the drag queen (well played 
by Peter Outerbridge) will win over the neurotic store owner?  Does the film 
have to tell us not everyone with same-sex proclivity is accepted in todayšs 
society; duh, we know that, letšs move on.  
     This is one of the yearšs worst scripts, about so much itšs about nothing.  
Išd keep act one, because the dialogue is smooth and witty, remove everything 
else that happens in the film, leave the sex where it is and start over.  Or, 
no - just take these two young leads and put them in something smarter and 
more serious.  They were certainly ready for it.

Review for Stigmata (1999)
     I missed a 1 ošclock for łStir of Echoes˛ by six minutes
and, not being one to miss a second of the movie-going
experience -- Išm talking lights dimming, previews, even that
THX thing with the cows (mšI psycho, or what) -- I caught a 1:15
of this film, instead.  Mistake.
Produced with an MTV-eye, łStigmata˛ is all photography
direction.  The story, next to impossible to concentrate on one
second to the next because the filmšs visual style is so abrasive,
follows Atheist hairdresser Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette) as
she becomes łafflicted˛ with the titular phenomena.  Meaning, wounds
of Christ; receive five, and you die.  So, the film is more or less
a countdown to her death.  Well.. why is this happening?  As a
form of extreme punishment on a non-believer, or a method of _making_
them believe?  Dunno.  Either way, thatšs not entertaining, itšs
depressing.  We get loving shots of large nails being hammered into
feet and hands, over and over again;  divine imagery, right?  If it
isnšt Arquette getting slashed or impaled, itšs blood dripping into
water, water dripping into water (Frankiešs apartment has a
convenient leak), or rain -- everything in annoying close-up.  Tip:
try to make everything look cool (microwaves, candles, coffee
cups, more candles.. did I mention water), and nothing does.
As for the gore, I wonder how a movie like this one skirts
the NC-17 rating.  One scene, featuring an open wound on Arquettešs
wrist that gushes blood so profusely for, like, five seconds, or
thereabouts, made me nauseous.  That, plus images of carnage
scattered throughout at what seemed like two-minute intervals;
wherešs the line?  A minutešs worth of sex in greater cinema like
łEyes Wide Shut˛ is too obscene for mass audiences, but 100
minutes of bloodshed here isnšt?  Oy... the hypocrisy continues.
If anything, I enjoyed Gabriel Byrnešs performance as the
priest/scientist/whatever the hell hešs supposed to be.  Hešs got
a couple reaction takes, off the possessed Frankie, that felt
natural.  Of course, then they get all doe-eyed toward one another,
and flirty, and talk about how he misses sex, and drink beer:  how
is there time for this?  Hešs supposed to be a man of the cloth,
what would she see in a -- nevermind.

Review for Romeo + Juliet (1996)
     I still believe that trailers should receive Academy Awards.  It's
kind of hard what those guys do:  They've got to successfully evoke the
mood and spirit of a film,  while not actually giving the film itself
away.  And most importantly,  of course,  they have to make us,  the
audience,  want to see the film.
     This is certainly true of a trailer I saw a few months back for
ROMEO AND JULIET.  With its use of sharp editing and the right
selection of music from the soundtrack,  it made me want to see the
film.  Actually,  I couldn't wait.  So,  I went wanting to like Baz
Luhrmann's update of the Shakespeare classic not only because of that
preview,  but because the concept of placing such poetic and elegant
verse in modern day intrigues me.  And the director does a damn good
job creating the surreality I'm sure he was looking to in which that
verse could exist.
     R&J plays as if somebody shot up,  got high,  then opened a copy
of Cliff's Notes and read.  Couldn't really understand what any of
it was supposed to mean,  and laughed at the whole thing.  The film is
trying to be different, like nothing we've ever seen before,  which I
definitely admire.  However, if you are going to take classic lit this
lightly,  you've got to show some more control.  I don't mean with
camera angles,  and editing techniques,  but over the flow of the
plot.  This picture seems a whole lot more interested in being
outrageous and bold than in the story it's trying to liven up.
     For all it's fresh approach,  there simply isn't much vitality.
     The opening duel at a gas station is played,  it seems,  for
laughs, and is filmed in a comical way,  with hardly anyone
getting shot.
     As is the scene of Juliet and her mom getting ready for the
upcoming party.
     There is a scene on the beach in which Tybault is pounding Romeo,
and Romeo doesn't fight back (primarily because he loves Juliet
and Tybault is related to her,  and I assume his restraint is out
of respect).  But then, Mercutio gets involved.  It's clear _he_ wants
to kill Tybault (because Romeo will not do it,  and because Tybault's
clan are bad boys and Mercutio doesn't want to see Romeo end up as
such),  but he drops his gun in the sand in order to fist fight with
Tybault.
     The father played by Paul Sorvino absolutely explodes when Juliet
says she isn't going to marry Paris,  quite nearly strangling his
own daughter.  I hear this is portrayed in Shakespeare's play,  but
here in the film we don't get to know Paris enough to care about him,
or understand his connection with Juliet's father aside from being her
suitor.
     The party that Romeo crashes - Romeo comes in,  having dropped
acid moments before,  and sees Mercutio in drag singing and
dancing,  and Juliet's father doing some sort of bad opera.  The point
of all of that,  of course, being to get the audience into Romeo's
mindset.  I just felt it was way,  way overdone.
      And so,  I left with a less than satisfied feeling.  I know that
the criticisms I have mentioned above are the director's new
vision on old themes,  and they are to be respected.  In intention.
But nothing he had to say sat right with me.

Review for Untamed Heart (1993)
     To begin this review, I must say that I did not want to see this
film.  The romantic-love-heart-ache genre in cinema has grown a bit
outdated in recent years, and basically I've become quite disillusioned
with the whole concept.  But, a funny thing happened while I sat down
to watch UNTAMED HEART--I found myself completely drawn into its world,
and the private lives of its characters.  I was pulled in, held--and as
soon as the lights in the theater were turned on again I felt as if a
part of me had been torn away from me.
     The story is simple:  Two lonely people fall in love.  Sounds just
like every other love story you've ever seen on film.  Where this one
differs, however, is that you really care about these people.  His name
is Adam.  Adam is an odd, reclusive young man who doesn't like to talk
a lot and isn't very good with people.  It seems as though he has
embodied a rather unhealthy heart since birth, and believes the story
about it that a nun told him at the orphanage where he was raised.
Adam has just one wish:  To love and be loved by a pretty young
waitress, with whom he works at an all-night diner in Minneapolis,
named Caroline.  Caroline is on a constant lookout for love, but she's
been dumped more times than she or anyone else can count.  Nobody wants
to be with her... except for Adam.  The only problem is that Caroline
hasn't given Adam much thought.  She thinks he's just plain weird.
Then, one night as she is walking home alone through the park, Caroline
is attacked by two men.  At her rescue is, of course, Adam.  He fights
both men off, and then carries an unconscious Caroline home.  He lays
her down in the swing on her front porch, covers her with his overcoat
and sits on the steps, keeping a constant watch on Caroline while she
sleeps.  She awakens ready to fight, but there's no need; no words are
spoken between her and Adam, and he runs away.
     They later meet at passing in a shopping mall.  He touches her
hand, and that's all.  You see, Caroline doesn't know what to say to
Adam or how to approach him.  She's always thought of him as a strange
part of life that she'd rather not get to know.  Nonetheless, Caroline
gets up the courage one night at work to finally thank Adam ... with a
kiss.  So begins their relationship.
     As I have said, this is a cut above other romance movies--a huge
cut above.  The characters are real people, not cookie-cutter, factory
outlet, assembly line characters.  These characters live on the screen,
and you feel all the time you spend watching this film that you are
intruding on their lives, or listening in.  That is the type realism
most film- makers strive for and fail miserably at capturing.  The per-
formances are absolutely indelible.  Christian Slater has never been
any better than he is here.  In the majority of his prior work, Slater
has pretty much hidden behind some sort of mask-- whether it be Jack
Nicholson, or whatever.  Here, he has nothing to hide behind.  As a
result, his work in this film is touching, endearing, subtly eloquent
and very moving.  This is not just a pretty face anymore; this is the
most competent actor working in film today.
     I'm afraid, however, that all credit for the success of this film
must go to Marisa Tomei.  She makes up the heart and soul of this film
with a performance that is as sweet and sensitive, as it is altogether
sexy.  Tomei is the most vibrant young face to grace the screen in
years, and she brings a great deal of freshness to the role of the
"love interest."  These two actors have wonderful chemistry on-screen--
they really do look great together.  All their scenes together can be
class- ified as love scenes, and each of them is a small gem.  Director
Tony Bill does a good job of erasing most of the grit of Tom Sierchio's
poignant script, and Cliff Eidelman skillfully captures the light,
exuberantly sweet tone of the film.  Put all these elements together,
and you have a truly involving and engaging movie.  UNTAMED HEART is
the best film of this, or any other, year.  See it, cry, and feel good
about life.
1993 -- 1:42m -- Rated PG-13, for mild Violence
