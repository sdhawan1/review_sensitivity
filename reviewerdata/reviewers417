Review for Scream 3 (2000)
Film Criticism By Zachary McGhee
Rated R (excessive violence, language), 110 minutes, 2000. Dimension. Neve
Campbell, Courtney Cox Arquette, David Arquette, Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey,
Jenny McCarthy, Scott Foley, Liev Schreiber. Directed by Wes Craven.
There was a lot riding on this movie. Everyone even moderately interested in
the "Scream" series was dying to know how it would end. What would be the
"final act"? This is the end of an era for them, a movie which has kept them up
nights searching for clues on the Internet, talking and tossing around rumors
with their equally enthused buddies, and, for kids under 17, those elaborate
plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into "Scream"
while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older
than themselves. No need to worry; "Scream 3" is endlessly inventive and
entertaining, a fine epilogue to the series that made Kevin Williamson a
household name, reinvented the horror genre, and continued in the
self-referential, post-modern tradition of Quentin and co.
So, how does the story go? As opposed to what some fanatical Internet sites
would have you believe, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), now all-grown-up and
constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her
psyche, is not living in Hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress,
but rather in upstate California, living, understandably, alone in the confines
of fences and vast security systems. She works at home as a crisis center
affiliate over the phone. But thatâs not where the movie starts off. Instead,
in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar, and conceptually
horrifying, sequence in "Eye For An Eye" (1995), Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber),
now a big star, drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls,
demands the location of Sidneyâs home, and, when he doesnât get it,
threatens the life of Cottonâs girlfriend Christine, and Cotton canât do
anything to stop him. The rest of the sequence is particularly clever, setting
up a constant throughout the picture: the killer has a high-tech electronic
voice-changer that tops that of the first two. Not only does he sound
unmistakably like talented voice-over artist Roger Jackson (ha, ha), he can now
easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters, including Sidney, and the
returned Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dewey Riley (David
Arquette).
At the same time, Stab 3, the third film-within-a-film based around the
characters and events of Woodsboro and Windsor College, has taken a less
authentic approach this time around in Return To Woodsboro; whereas the account
of the first two films was true, the franchise within "Scream" has now become
totally fictional. Nevertheless, we learn, Cotton made an appearance in the
movie which is now in production, as himself to be killed off in the first
scene. So, it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in
which they bite it in the movieâ'either the actor portraying them, or the real
thing. Sometimes both. Clever, indeed. But, who goes next? No one knows. Three
different scripts were penned, weâre told, to keep the true finale off the
Internet (a nod to the "Scream" 2 fiasco a few years back) and no one knows for
sure which one the killer read.
Still, all the while Sidney stays concealed in her home, only visiting dad for
the first half-hour of the film, while also having horrifying visions of her
mother, which takes us back a bit to Sidneyâs fear of becoming what her
mother wasâ'or, at least, what her mother was secretly. When Sidney finally
ventures out to Hollywood as the murders become more prevalent, sheâs chased
onto the set of Stab 3, wandering through "Woodsboro," written and directed as
an odd, surreal, nightmare indeed, this is one of "Scream 3"âs finest
moments.
Okay, over the years, Iâll admit that Iâve become quite the "Scream" fan.
No, I donât have the Ghostface costume or the directorâs cut laserdisc, but
I often find myself compelled to pop in the DVD of either member of the
preceding duo, and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these
films (yes, I said "dramatic element"), sometimes debating with family and
friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become
quintessentially affiliated with "Scream".
Throughout the film, though, I noticed a much more subtle approach than the
other two films. Granted that thereâs stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout,
but thereâs considerably less blood, less gore. Honestly, I like this
approach. Itâs more classical, more rebellious, constantly demonstrating the
capable direction of Wes Craven. He knows when to hold back and at the same
time makes the movie ooze with energy, illustrating the delicate poise flowing
from his years of experience. Some critics have noted that "Scream 3" seems to
take itself more seriously this time; maybe so, or maybe screenwriter Ehren
Kruger (Arlington Road), who took over after Williamson had scheduling
conflicts, saw an opportunity for true ironyâ'maybe even a little bit of
satireâ'if the film worked in a few more clichĂŠs.
What puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film, Iâm
afraid, is the ending, or, rather, the identity of the killer. It does the job,
I guess, accomplishes what it should, bringing the three films full circle, but
upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a
little too contrived, too arbitrary; after a second viewing, which I endeavored
upon due to this recurring disapprobation, the killerâs identity still seems
a little too random, but his motivation came across more sound this time
around, and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying.
All in all, "Scream 3" does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a
trilogy: it is not the worst of the films. As a trilogy, "Scream" was a lot of
fun; refreshing, humorous, offbeat. Almost sad to see it go. But then, it does
seem best to quit while youâre ahead, and "Scream 3" does a fine job of
providing closure to its characters. For now, "Scream" holds the title as the
finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid. Not too shabby.

Review for Psycho (1960)
Rated R (re-rated for video release, though it's
not clear why; the film met censorship standards
for its original release and contains only mature
themes and off screen violence), 110 minutes.
Anthony Perkins, John Gavin, Vera Miles, Martin
Balsam, and Janet Leigh. Screenplay by Joseph
Stefano. From the novel by Robert Bloch. Directed
by Alfred Hitchcock. Paramount/Universal.
"A boy's best friend is his mother." That line,
uttered desperately by Anthony Perkins' Norman
Bates during the infamous conversation between he
and Janet Leigh, frightened me more than anything
which came before it, or followed. The wispy vocal
presentation, the secrecy of Norman's attitude; he
yearns to protect what he knows is evil, for many
reasons. First, loyalty to his mother, and
secondly, a perverse, sexual longing that Norman
has for Leigh's Marion. If she knew the truth,
what he was concealing, she would never, in
Norman's mind, entertain the idea of sexual
congress of any kind with him; in reality, she
would never consider it regardless, she sees right
through him-to a degree; she obviously doesn't
spot the murderous intentions and psychological
torment going on inside this poor boy-she sees
that he's being manipulated, that he's protecting
something, though she doesn't detect precisely
what.
Everything that Alfred Hitchcock tried to inspire
in the viewer exists in that scene, everything
about human emotion, hidden desire, pain, lust,
and voyeurism (see the birds, lurking in the
background of the frame, and later in the film
when Norman spies on Marion as she undresses); the
recognition of those basic, but covert, elements
of the human psyche, that third face which we
build to conceal our very selves with the facade
of compassion were what Hitchcock was most
interested, what he most deeply explored in his
films. See Leigh sitting there, her body language
conflicting; she closes off to this young man
because, although he's personable enough, there is
something obviously wrong. She senses it, she
strives to decipher it, but she can't. Not, at
least, to the point of saving her own life. Just
as Norman refuses to acknowledge his own
underlying distress, she refuses to recognize the
depth of the danger which surrounds her. He tries,
as much as he can, to open up to her, because he
truly begins to care for her; she wouldn't have
died if he didn't.
Friday, December the Eleventh, 2:43p.m. We pan to
a hotel room in Arizona; two lovers are inside
after a romantic encounter, flirting with one
another. She is Marion, he is Sam Loomis (John
Gavin). She wants to marry, he's content meeting
in hotel rooms on the weekends, paying his
alimony. They part, nothing's been settled. He
retreats to his home in CITY, she returns to work.
A large sum of money comes into her possession and
she steals it, hoping to take it to Sam so that
they might be married. It begins to rain as she
drives, she grows tired, weary, sees a little
motel, the Bates' Motel, stops there for the
evening, chats with the young man, Norman Bates,
who runs it under guidance from his contemptible
mother, steps into her cabin for the evening,
decides to return the money the next day, takes a
shower in preparation for bed, and someone comes
in and quickly and brutally murders her.
"He liked that whole introduction to the movie; he
liked that it was going to be about her, and then
we were suddenly going to do this awful thing to
you and say, No, no, it's not about her, it's
about him'," recounted screenwriter Joseph Stefano
of his meetings with Hitchcock. The deception is
most effective, leading to not only one of the
greatest films of all time, but also revealing one
of the themes of the film: manipulation.
Psycho was based, loosely, on the novel by Robert
Bloch of the same name. Having read the book for
the first time roughly a year-and-a-half ago, I
can say that it is a very powerful, striking piece
of writing, but it has little in common with the
subsequent film. "We never mentioned the book; we
never returned to the book again," said Stefano.
The changes made in the translation to the screen
are appropriate, putting to shame the adaptations
of many modern novels to film. In the book, Norman
has regular conversations and arguments with his
mother, and descriptions of her are given, making
the end revelation a little less obvious, and
indeed the ending itself is rather ambiguous until
the absolute conclusion (i.e., Norman, Norma, and
Normal). Stefano's script is more subtle than
ambiguous. He and Hitchcock instead opted to
create an incessant theme of our maternal
attachments, with very few conversations overheard
between Norman and his mother, which, in the film,
makes the subject matter much more personal.
Take, for example, the framing of the scene in
which Norman wraps Marion's body, carefully
constructed so as not to show the nude, lifeless
remains. Obviously censorship standards at the
time would not have allowed it, but I doubt that
the scene could have had such power otherwise; the
mental firewall, the detachment, which Norman
constructs for himself in that scene-which is the
only way he ever could have concealed such an
grotesque, evil act as a character-is communicated
flawlessly with this technique, and drives the
audience's self-examination of their own ego,
their individuality, and how we as human being are
able to, as Roger Ebert says, build mental
firewalls between our outward personalities and
the evil or sinful deeds which we commit.
The performances are heartbreaking. Perkins'
Norman is a poor, misguided man who earns our
sympathy quickly, if incorrectly (at least, as far
as morality goes). Leigh is a little more distant,
and aptly so, until her final moments when our
hearts weep for her. John Gavin remains equally
aloof, a man who can't quite deal with or accept
the inevitable. Vera Miles as Marion's sister,
Lila, is more greatly sympathetic; rightfully
angry, but not hostile. And Martin Balsam's brief
stint as the inspector seems out of place to us.
He does his job, and we know that, but because, at
the time, we sympathize more with Norman and Lila
we don't understand the scope of his performance
until his violent death. The score by Bernard
Herrman is the soul of Psycho. Herrman's orchestra
was all strings, no percussion or brass, but
rather an eerie, stark representation of our inner
selves, Herrman never lets up.
And then there's those final moments. The one flaw
among perfection. The psychiatrist's speech.
Stefano fought for it, because it was something he
knew; he was in analysis at the time Psycho was
made and found an explanation necessary. Really,
though, ambiguity was more fitting here; to
dismiss and explain away the madness, the torment,
the suffering, the chaos of the past hundred
minutes undermines the preceding material. "Hitch
called it a hat grabber," he said. Indeed,
Hitchcock had his doubts about it, but Stefano was
adamant, and I'd have to agree with the master. If
the speech was cut, Norman's experience would not
have been easily labeled and resolved as a mere
"condition", but rather as an unexpected,
unexplainable force of evil, like John Carpenter's
Michael Myers in Halloween. No explanations, no
resolutions. Just a terrifying, and therefore more
disconcerting, power.
Still, it's a minor qualm. If I had my way, I
wouldn't have sat through seven, count em seven,
Halloween films in the first place, none of the
Psycho follow-ups would've never been made, and
Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt would've been "just
friends" at the conclusion of As Good As It Gets.
The speech in Psycho only dents, but does not
destroy, the ultimate reputation of Hitchcock and
his masterwork. Psycho is a devastating, potent
motion picture from one of the greatest, most
insightful directors who ever lived.

Review for Tigger Movie, The (2000)
I feel kind of bad so casually dismissing kindhearted kids' fare like "The
Tigger Movie", in which Tigger goes on a search for his "real" family after
being rejected by Pooh Bear and Co. when he requests that they go bouncing with
him and demands that, eventually, they all discover that they are his family,
but too much of this film had me thinking that AA Milne would be rotating like
a rotisserie in his grave over this literary sacrilege. The movie's
themeâ'accepting different kinds of families, particularly adoptiveâ'is nice
enough, but the metaphor isn't disguised too well. The presence of "Toy Story
2" in the same multiplex had me drawing a mental Venn diagram of their positive
aspects, and ultimately finding the similarities column thin, and the "Toy
Story 2" column about ten times longer than Falkensteinâs obvious potboiler.
Meanwhile, the movie rushes with the narrative, but somehow seems prolonged as
a whole, even though it clocks in at a mercifully short 77 minutes. Nice try,
but something about "The Tigger Movie" just screams "Direct-to-Video".

Review for Return to Me (2000)
RETURN TO ME [Hunt] -- I learned many, many of David Duchovny's weak
points in this film: (1) I cannot, under almost any circumstances, truly
picture him -- or believe him -- as an architect; (2) He looks horrible
in a tuxedo, but, somehow, manages realism in a bloodied one; (3) A dog
can cry better than he can; (4) At the onset of dancing, he appears
resolutely feminine; (5) None of it matters: He shares great chemistry
with the lovely Minnie Driver, and the premise is too contrived to be
accidental (movies like this, so long as they maintain their charm, are
allowed a free pass for their plot -- even Pleasantville relied on a
preposterous plot device in order to "leap into" its subject matter),
and Bonnie Hunt, though I suppose she could use a few more directing
lessons, maintains her title as Hollywood's best gal pal (her acting
ability is not in doubt, but I fear her in a lead) and seems a fairly
skilled screenwriter as well. If, however, the parallel introduction to
both characters had been reduced merely to Driver's entrance, the
film would've benefited as a whole, but instead I have mild
reservations. B-

Review for Keeping the Faith (2000)
KEEPING THE FAITH [Norton] -- Nothing more than passable fluff, really,
which I guess ain't bad, but I do prefer characters that I can truly
sympathize-slash-empathize with and I suppose Norton had it toughest:
the majority of the movie going public isn't exactly made up of Catholic
priests. Thankfully, first-time director/actors tend to be especially
critical of their performances; thus, his character, who bothered me
quite a bit until reel three, is absent from the majority of the
romantic proceedings. The subject-matter doesn't lend itself to any
particular visual style (other than the typical prose of Nora Ephron,
who is thanked in the end credits), so we, as an audience, are left
wondering if Nortion can really direct. But then, there's that whole
other mystery entirely: Who ever would've envisioned Edward Norton as
director of a romantic-comedy? By the way, Ben Stiller is a genius. C+

Title
Review for Rules of Engagement (2000)
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT [Friedkin] -- Boy, did they screw up reel one!
Really a mess from minute one to forty-five, an introduction as thought
provoking as colored toilet paper, the movie takes a sudden turn
for interesting once the courtroom battle begins, Tommy Lee Jones and
Samuel L. Jackson kick into high gear, and those pathetic Saving Private
Ryan-wannabe battle scenes cease fire. It certainly feels like something
downloaded from the creative mind of one Tom Clancy, with A Few Good Men
tossed in for good measure. C+

Title
Review for Frequency (2000)
FREQUENCY [Hoblit] -- Too contrived, with every key event so obviously
foreshadowed, to be either lucid, or enjoyed in the silliest context.
Actually, no, that's not right: in fact, the film's final suspense
sequence is to be enjoyed only in the silliest context. That said, the
whole project works best a thriller guided by baseball in the vein
of Summer Of Sam (which I haven't seen, actually), and the modern day
sequences pale in comparison to the older, despite Dennis Quaid's
stilted New York accent; most of it doesn't work (why does Hoblit have
to give a reason --the Northern Lights -- for their being able to
communicate?), but when it does it's a nailbiter (the aforementioned
final sequence in particular, with an odd, disjointed sense of fear and
unpredictably, albeit cut off by a laughable turnabout). Ironically,
though, it could've been a masterpiece if it hadn't a hint of the murder
mystery, and an actor other than Jim Caviezel in the lead role (though,
even he began to grow on me in the final reel). C+

Title
Review for Supernova (2000)
I wish I was around when kids spent their weekends at the movies watching
serials with each other, playfully shouting at the screen, just there to be
entertained. I imagine an adult version of such fare would be "Supernova", a
new sci-fi thriller in which the plot progresses at a playful tempo and the
characters and the somewhat inane plot actually seem to be more important than
the surrounding awe, unlike a certain big space blockbuster released two years
back.
In future times (a specific date is never given), small crews are apparently
sent into deep space for assorted missions, the subject of which here is the
Nightingale, a rescue vessel touring the universe just in case there's a
distress call from other space missions. The crew consists of six, Benjamin
(Wilson Cruz), Danika Lund (Robin Tunney), Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond
Phillips), lead doctor Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett), newcomer, a former
military pilot, Nick Vanzant (James Spader), and their captain (A.J. Marley).
Quick into the film, they receive a distress call from another dimension and
are forced to "jump" into it. The captain is killed in the jump and Spader's
character takes over as captain.
So, in the middle of all this madness, who sent the distress call? Apparently a
name that Kaela recognizes, Carl Larson, "your worst nightmare". Or is he? He
says he's Troy (Peter Facinelli), Carl's son, who has just discovered an
amazing secret of life, an odd enigma of an object which makes you grow
stronger physically, but, as suggested by the holes in the film's plot, not
mentally, and may be doing more harm than good. What follows is a series of
quick paced, occasionally quick witted, events.
Indeed, Thomas Lee's (a pseudonym for director Walter Hill) "Supernova"
definitely has its flaws to go right along with its, as they say, moments.
Let's start with the obvious. This is one hades of a spaceship. It's huge, and
that's not hyperbole. It could match those space stations in "2001". And while
that's fun to look at sometimes, and may be impressive, what's it doing here?
They're just a rescue crew made up of roughly seven individuals who tour the
galaxy waiting around for distress signals. Why all that hardware for so few
people with even littler opportunity to use it? And they aren't even
particularly good effects, even if they are big.
Then there's those off-the-shelf, standardized subplots. Namely, romantic
encounters between Bassett and Spader, and Phillips and Tunney. Since when did
the government start providing a big old spaceship (lest we return to that
subject) so that groups of people could have private orgies in deep space? From
the futuristic setting, I thought Clinton was long out of office in this movie.
But, what I liked about the movie is that occasionally the characters shone
through those effects as well. I'm not rushing to give credit to screenwriters,
though. The dialogue isn't bright, but the more talented of the ensemble make
it sound interesting. James Spader seems to be the most effective at this,
though Angela Bassett comes close too. They made a movie that could have been a
tepid, uninvolving replay of other equally pathetic films into something mildly
entertaining, even passable.
And then there's the little things, like the ship's original captain earning
his PhD from watching old episodes of "Tom and Jerry", or Bassett routinely
shouting "STAT!" in her medical dialogues, apparently inferring that she got
her degree from watching reruns of "ER". Or the fact that there must be a
little interference from Troy in the relationship between two of our
protagonists, simply so their can be a conflict between the two men.
There are some interesting ideas established throughout "Supernova", but the
problem is that they are ignored in favor of a depressing, fight-it-out, man to
man climax, and so I cannot recommend it. I am reminded that roughly one-half
of the way into "Supernova", when asked about the aforementioned odd, life
renewing object by her crew mate, Bassett remarks that it must have been made
by someone "Smart as God and a lot less nice." And? Who are they? Gee, I dunno.
The studio that turned down this script before it went to MGM?

Title
Review for Down to You (2000)
Rated PG-13 (brief graphic language, other mild language, sensuality and
related themes), 100 minutes, 2000. Miramax. Freddie Prinze, Jr, Julia Stiles,
Henry Winkler, Shawn Hatosy, Zak Orth, Selma Blair, Ashton Kutcher, Rosario
Dawson. Directed by Kris Isacsson.
When he defined morality, Hemmingway said that if you felt good after doing
something it was fundamentally good, and if you felt badly it was fundamentally
evil. I felt bad after watching Down To You. Hyperbole, you say? Yes, of
course, I retort, but youâll thank me in the end.
Maybe it was that neither of these characters are especially good people that
we can even begin to care about. Maybe it was that they did and said wretched
things to one another throughout the course of what some critics are calling
The Story Of Us-lite. Maybe itâs that the screenplay isnât the least bit
involving, or original, and instead volunteers tired teen and college clichĂŠs.
But, even after all that, Iâm pretty sure it was the ending.
Down To You begins and develops in what is becoming a much too common way to
tie up your narrative. It must have been in the latest edition of "How to Write
The Great American Screenplay," or something. The characters speak directly to
camera (which, you would think, would be weird to the people around them; see
Wayneâs World for the real way to do this) and relate their trite and
exhausted tale of romance passed.
Al, played by the incomprehensibly effete Freddie Prinze, Jr., begins weaving
the story of how they met, his "first love," he says. Cut to a bar a couple of
years back, Alâs in his sophomore year of college, sitting in a booth at a
bar ("We thought it was cool âcause they didnât check I.D.") discussing
with a friend the latterâs venture into the porn industry, and another friend
who wants to get into the business through this guy, Monkâs, connections. (A
timeline in the forthcoming relationship is basically provided by how far up
the ladder Monk travels in the industry: first low-key star, then director,
then withdrawalâ'like Boogie Nights for the kiddies.)
Anyway, somehow Al catches a glance at Imogen (Julia Stiles, not as clever or
quick witted here as her heroine of last yearâs 10 Things I Hate About You,
although that film earned the same two-and-a-half stars), a freshman who spends
a lot of time drinking and doing drugs (not always on screen), but is somehow
constantly sober enough to pop out the occasional one-liner. They start
talkingâ'something about Patsy Clineâ'and eventually begin dating. There are
a few useless subplots, like constant flirtation between Monkâs co-stars and
Al, problems between Al and his dad (Henry Winkler), etc., etc. But mainly the
movie centers on the budding relationship of Prinze, Jr. and Stiles. 
Things start off well, but then itâs like a three-year-old with access to a
light switch. On and off. On and off. The bickering never ceases, and neither
does the making up, which, according to Al, is when "it feels best" to be with
her. So we get into this constant cycle, allowing them to have their odd little
"relationship high," cursing and blaming one another just to get back to making
up. Then it starts to fall apart, and after seeing these people fight for 90
minutes we finally get to see what we know would, at long last, make them just
shut up so we can go home. And then, ugh, the Hollywood clichĂŠ machine kicks
into gear, tosses us our happy ending, and says "everything will be all right
now, you can go".
Watching Down To You, which is the directorial debut of Kris Isacsson, I came
to realize what Hollywood is missing out on. When I saw the ultimately
disappointing 10 Things I Hate About You, I celebrated the performance of Larry
Miller, who played the concerned father of two teenage girls. Here, I noted the
dazzling performance of Henry Winkler. And while Winklerâs role is not as
well written as Millerâs, it came to me. What we need is not a movie about
teenagers starring teenagers, but rather a movie about teenagers starring
parents, because, apparently, they lead lives which are much more interesting
and creative than their children. At least then, rather than lamenting over the
silly college affairs of immature losers we could go behind-the-scenes of a
t.v. show Winkler pitches as an on-air chef: "Cooks." Like "Cops", but not.

Review for U-571 (2000)
U-571 [Mostow] -- To summarize Breakdown, Jonathan Mostow's previous
endeavor, I'd offer about sixty-seven synonyms for the words taut,
powerful, suspenseful, professional, so on, so forth. Or, to much more
magnify the apparent slump that he appears to be in, I offer The Game,
1997's best film, as far as I'm concerned, for which Mostow served as
executive producer. This, for the observant among you, however, is not
Breakdown -- nor, by a long shot, The Game. Very little of this one
works, thespians included. The plot is interesting, I suppose, but it's
execution is not. The action is tepid: in fact, some of it is laced with
such boredom that the exit sign appeared much more interesting than the
goings on screen.

Title
Review for Trans (1998)
Not Rated (strong language, mild violence, mature themes), 90 minutes, 1998.
Released commercially in 2000. Justin Lakes, Ryan Daugherty, Jon Daugherty.
Directed by Julian Goldberg.
Movies like Trans get on my nerves. They’re the type of rubbish that makes up
roughly one-half of the independent film world, and give it a bad name. The
other half are grand motion pictures carried out in the traditions of cinema:
Bright, original, cutting edge. We, as critics, may urge Hollywood studios to
take a look at this emerging art form known as independent film, but imagine a
film like this slips through the cracks and they get a good look at it?
Even Supernova, a recent film which looks pretty much like a disaster area with
its background (that film’s director walked out in an editing dispute with
the studio and replaced his name with pseudonym Thomas Lee) and pathetic
screenplay, is preferable to this mediocre, muddled garbage. Few directors can
achieve the feat which Julian Goldberg has. This movie is boring, long, drawn
out and unnecessary. If you don’t have a story to tell, don’t tell it.
Truth be told, the most horrible and condemning fact about Trans is this: I
walked out of this movie.
The plot (which I had to look up on the Internet, as it can’t be found in the
film itself) seems to go something like this: A young delinquent of some sort
manages to escape the juvenile facility he’s been placed in and goes running
all around talking and meeting with different people who manage to assist in
concealing him from authorities out to catch him, along the way somehow
managing to be called by some a "coming-of-age" tale.
Sundance officials, who selected the film to run at the 1999 festival, say that
they were "so excited" when they saw Trans. No doubt because, if there were any
insomniacs among them, they were instantly cured. I was constantly checking my
watch during the movie, and when it felt as if the film ought to be reaching
some sort of merciful conclusion, I realized that only one-third of it had
passed, leaving another sixty minutes to be endured. And so I up and left.
I give Trans one star, rather than none, because perhaps I did not give it
enough of a chance, and maybe if I had seen the rest of it there might have
been some redeeming qualities about it. Of course, a film with a prologue as
tedious, incoherent and confused as this one hardly deserves such a
presumptuous credit.
Sundance officials also noted that the visual integrity of Trans appealed to
them, and the fact that Goldberg didn’t really know "where he wanted to go"
when he started shooting somehow makes the film more true to life in its art.
Ha. I say, you don’t know where you’re going when you start shooting?
You’re wasting film.
But then, that can be forgiven. If you know where you want to go when you start
editing. Chop out the tedium. That is, of course, unless there’s nothing but
that.

Review for Where the Money Is (2000)
WHERE THE MONEY IS [Kanievska] -- Clever is the only word to describe
the sheer veracity contained in watching Fiorentino, Newman, and, to a
lesser extent, Dermot Mulroney, exchanging a silent -- or verbal, for
that matter -- battle over *everything that Kanievska has set forth. I
mean, it's just so c-o-o-l! I'm sure many of you cynics, who, y'know,
don't know how to enjoy a movie, would say that the characters are
lacking and the plot is a bit ludicrous, which I retort, to all you
naysayers: And? Fiorentino's motivation may be simplistic, and the
ending may seem too neat and tidy (as much as that can be under the
circumstances of a bank heist), but that's how classic movies are made,
right? I mean, when Paul Newman -- now three-quarters of a century old
-- and Linda Fiorentino flirt with the romantic subtext, we really
believe it, and why shouldn't we? It's a movie folks, and Newman is one
darn fine actor. My one criticism: If one is ever to question the power
of music, correct your inverted perception by attending this one: the
score by one Mark Isham (who's work has been so-so for the last five
years) is so horrendous and ultimately distracting -- like something
made for the latest movie-of-the-week, if they still had those -- that
it bumped this one down a notch. B+

Review for 28 Days (2000)
28 DAYS [Thomas] -- Solid, well-balanced dramedy has more than its share
of melodrama, but Bullock makes it work, even so much that two scenes in
particular had me in tears. No, not the boo-hooing of teenage girls
sitting through Titanic, mind you, just a bit teary-eyed. B
