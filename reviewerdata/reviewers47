Review for Zoolander (2001)
Movies are back, and the public is flocking to see them.  After a week in
which nothing opened in Santa Fe and only the Mariah Carey flop `Glitter' tested
the waters nationwide, the screens are alive with the sound of movies, as people
try to recover that elusive feeling of feeling good.
`Zoolander' might do it for you.  The title character is dumb as dirt, but
the movie is not.  It takes a slender gag and dances with it, managing to keep
the laughs percolating most of the way.  Writer-director Ben Stiller and his
writing partners John Hamburg and Drake Sather have taken what began life as a
1996 VH1 Fashion Awards sketch, and strung it out to feature length with a
nimbler hand than you might imagine.  
Derek Zoolander is the world's top male model  or has been, up until now. 
 When he's beaten out for his fourth straight Male Model of the Year award by
blond-tressed upstart Hansel (Owen Wilson), he goes into a funk, and begins to
contemplate the heretical notion that there may be more to life than just being
really, really incredibly good-looking.  He shocks the fashion world by
announcing his retirement, but is soon lured out by an offer from super designer
Mugatu (Will Ferrell) to be the face of his new fashion concept inspired by the
homeless, a line called Derelicte.  But that's only a cover,  Mugatu's real
designs are dastardly and dark.
The fashion industry, it turns out, has been behind every political
assassination over the past 200 years.  Male models, really really incredibly
good-looking without and as vacant as an unfinished building within, are the
perfect tools for the job.  Mugatu wants the Prime Minister of Malaysia
eliminated.  The Prime Minister is one of those bleeding hearts who wants to
toughen child labor laws in his country and interfere with `the age-old right of
children to work.'  This could have serious consequences for the fashion
industry.  So Zoolander, all unsuspecting, is brainwashed and programmed to do
the nefarious deed.
In this space a week ago I wrote about the way the September 11th terror
has colored the way we see many things, and here's another example of that
shifted paradigm.  A comic premise involving a person or persons brainwashed to
carry out a lethal act doesn't retain the same sublime silliness today that it
must have had when Stiller and his partners were writing it.  The studio had no
way around that one, but it did take the trouble to digitally erase the World
Trade Center from several shots of the New York City skyline in an effort to
spare the sensibilities of an audience primed for comedy.
But `Zoolander' is just plain funny, silly stuff.  To hold it up as an
example of all that's wrong with America, as Roger Ebert has done in his
agonized review (`There have been articles lately asking why the United States
is so hated in some parts of the world. As this week's Exhibit A from Hollywood,
I offer Zoolander,'") is to betray a serious, if pardonable, loss of
perspective.  This is the kind of thing that inspired the phrase `Oh, lighten
up!'
Stiller's script and direction keep this spoof aloft for longer than you
might think possible, and at a trim 85 minutes it's only a little too long. 
It's strewn with cameos that include David Bowie, Billy Zane, Garry Shandling,
Winona Ryder, and a wonderful scene in a graveyard with David Duchovny as a
former star hand model who reveals the dark scope of the plot.  Stiller's pal
Owen Wilson is gloriously dim as Zoolander's rival, and his father Jerry Stiller
and his wife Christine Taylor are good in supporting roles.
Male models may not seem like a necessary target for satire, but there's
something so beguilingly ridiculous about the idea that it doesn't require
justification.  Stiller creates a character as fabulously glittering and empty
as cubic zirconium, and his purse-lipped, penetrating `Blue Steel' look is
hilarious.  If you don't think the idea of Stiller as the world's top male model
is funny, this kind of comedy may well be beneath you.  But that would be too
bad.

Title
Review for Hearts in Atlantis (2001)
In its own way, `Hearts in Atlantis' is just as silly as `Zoolander.'  It
just isn't supposed to be.  `Hearts' is one of those swelling-score-laden movies
dripping with quality that practically have Oscar acceptance speeches written
into the screenplay.  Item: Anthony Hopkins, Sir Anthony Hopkins, an actor whose
presence in a movie fairly screams Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  Item: Scott
Hicks, director of the wonderful `Shine' and the maligned `Snow Falling on
Cedars', a man who knows how to polish a movie and showcase a character.  Item,
William Goldman, the celebrated screenwriter who earned his place in the cinema
pantheon with `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' in 1969 and the incomparable
Hollywood study Adventures in the Screen Trade  in '83. Item, Stephen King, the
best-selling author who moves between horror and sensitivity with the élan of a
Rudy Giuliani.  
The story here comes from the sensitive side of King, the side that
produced `The Shawshank Redemption', `The Green Mile', and the end-of-childhood
melodrama `Stand By Me'.  Childhood ends again in `Hearts of Atlantis', this
time the childhood of 11-year-old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin), who lives in a
small Connecticut town with his self-absorbed mother, Liz (Hope Davis), a
cold-blooded skinflint who gives him a library card for his birthday instead of
the bike he wants.  His father died when he was little, and left his mother with
a lot of bills and a chip on her shoulder.  `He never met an inside straight he
didn't like,' she tells Bobby bitterly.
Things get cooking when elderly Mr. `call-me-Ted' Brautigan (Anthony
Hopkins) moves in upstairs, and offers Bobby a buck a week to read the
newspapers to him and keep an eye out for `low men' who may be closing in on
him.  Ted seems to have some sort of mind-reading gift (`People call it a
gift.I've always found it more of a burden.'), and he goes off from time to
time into glassy-eyed trances.  When he's not doing that he encourages Bobby to
read, and tells him stories; listening to Ted recount the comeback game of
football legend Bronco Nagurski is like hearing a play-by-play from Alistair
Cooke on Prozac.
The movie is framed, and perhaps you've encountered this device before, by
the present day funeral of a boyhood friend, where middle-aged Bobby (David
Morse) has his memory bank jimmied by a battered old baseball glove (which
doesn't figure in the movie any more importantly than Atlantis does.)  Back we
go to 1959, or at least they say it's '59, although the songs on the
available-in-stores soundtrack jump around disorientingly  from '55 (`OnlyYou',
`Aint That a Shame', `Sh-Boom') to '60 (`The Twist').
Lost innocence is a metaphor we can't get enough of in this country, and
innocence is lost with profligate carelessness here.  Bobby loses his, his
childhood sweetheart (Mika Boorem) loses hers, his Mom loses hers in a scene
where she must be the only person in the theater who doesn't see it coming.  The
country is poised to lose its as well, with low men skulking about and the faint
shadow felt of a young candidate for President who will not live out his term.
You can't make a movie with this kind of talent and not wind up with some
wonderful stuff.  There are moments of real charm.  Hope Davis is solid,
youngsters Yelchin and Boorem are good, and Hopkins is impressive as always,
though he often seems to be in another movie, reciting from the Tibetan Book of
the Dead.  The photography by the late Piotr Sobocinski (Krzysztof Kieslowski's 
cameraman) is beautiful.  But too much of the movie seems projected through a
Hallmark card, dredged in treacle and powdered sugar.  It may not be impossible
to enjoy this movie, but it might well be embarrassing.  

Title
Review for Training Day (2001)
It's a mean, bad world out there, and the guys with the responsibility to
protect and serve sometimes have to be meaner and badder than the rest.  That's
the lesson veteran narcotics cop Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) devotes the
training day of his rookie partner Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) to preaching.  But
just how mean and how bad?  And who gets protected, and what gets served?
There's an operatic sweep to "Training Day", a score of foulness and
violence that starts with small discords and swells up, up, and away into
bombast, super-bombast, and finally oozes over the top into absurdity and
cliché.  To want to see this movie, you have to be willing to accept the kind of
relentless, pounding violence that leaves faces a dripping pulp.  A calloused
ear for language is a help too.  This is a movie that prides itself on not
pulling any punches, verbal or physical.
Detective Alonzo Harris is a medieval warlord, running his fiefdom by laws
of his own devising, ruling by power, terror, and the scattering of favors. 
Washington plays him with a charismatic swagger, charm wrapped thinly around a
wrecking ball.  It is hard to think of another star who could have elevated this
character to a level that would justify the two hours this script demands of us.
 It's a performance that is likely to earn him another Oscar nomination, not
because it's such a well-written role, but because Washington's huge talent
riddles it with fascinating dramatic contradictions, and his scenery-chewing
magnetism inflates it to proportions that demand attention.  
It's a tough performance to have to share the screen with, and while Ethan
Hawke battles gamely and sometimes effectively for his camera time, he often
seems to be struggling just to breathe the depleted oxygen Washington has sucked
away.  His Jake is our eyes and ears on the inferno of Alonzo's
through-the-looking-glass underworld, a good guy trying to conceal his naiveté
and run with the big dogs, while at the same time trying to draw a line beyond
which he will not betray his sense of ethics.  "You remind me of myself," Alonzo
is fond of saying when Jake erupts with principled resistance to his methods. 
But "in this world you gotta have a little dirt on you for people to trust
you."
At first, the misery Alonzo puts Jake through seems like rough-hewn but
good-natured hazing, but it gradually descends into the sadistic and the
satanic.  Jake sometimes seems unnecessarily naďve: "What if that guy makes a
complaint?" he asks querulously after Alonzo has worked over a street lowlife. 
And yet even when Alonzo's actions seem unambiguously evil, he manages to pull
another reversal and cast them as tough but necessary tactics in the battle
against the bad guys.  "You've got to decide whether you're a wolf or a sheep,"
he tells Jake, and in this impenetrable world of lawlessness it's hard to get a
grasp of what's bad and what's worse.  
There is an establishment, and Alonzo is a different and diffident man when
he comes up against it.  There's a nice scene in a coffee shop with three old
pros, Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry, and lapsed leading man Tom Berenger as
suits from the D.A.'s office waxing cynical about the legal system and warning
Harris about the danger he faces from the Russian Mafia.
The movie's worst sins, if you discount its gargantuan appetite for
violence and villainy, come in the form of desperate plot turns in the last
twenty minutes or so.  Most unforgivable is a deus ex machina reprieve that Jake
gets when things look so grim that there should be no escape.  It's like one of
those cartoons in boys' magazines of yesteryear where the hero is dangling from
a cliff with crocodiles snapping at his legs from below and lions closing in
from above, and the challenge is to send in the winning suggestion for saving
the poor guy.  And after that it only gets worse, with scenes pilfered from old
westerns and action-adventures and "Bonnie and Clyde".  Director Antoine Fuqua
("Replacement Killers") has done a strong job up until then of measuring out the
tension and tightening the net, but in the end he screws up badly, throwing in
the directorial sponge as if he's succeeded in scaring himself and just wants
out.

Review for Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2000)
     You'd be angry too.  Hedwig used to be Hansel, an East German boy of
confused sexuality who fell in love with an American sergeant (Maurice Dean
Wint).  In order to pass the physical to get married, he had to undergo a sex
change operation (`To be free, one must give up a little piece of oneself,' his
mother counseled).  The operation went awry, and the residue was the eponymous
unit of measure.
     Writer/director/star John Cameron Mitchell created this rock fantasy of
gender identity Off-Broadway, where it became a cult hit, and he has transferred
it with notable success to the big screen (it has garnered a mantel-full of
awards, from Berlin to Sundance.)  The movie fairly bristles with originality
and energy; it stands out from the wasteland of failed summer blockbusters like
a whirling dervish in a Benedictine monastery.  Originality and energy in
themselves aren't enough to insure a worthwhile movie, but here they're
buttressed by a pretty solid serving of talent as well.
     Hedwig and her backup group the Angry Inch, and their manager (the
wonderful Andrea Martin) are touring a series of salad bar restaurants called
Bilgewater's, playing to scattered audiences of bored and bemused burghers,
always in the same cities where rock megastar Tommy Gnossis (Michael Pitt) is
playing to arenas packed with adoring fans.  In a series of songs and flashbacks
we piece together Hedwig's checkered history: molested by his G.I. father,
neglected by his East German mother (`Our apartment was so small mother made me
play in the oven'), inspired by the music of American masters (Toni Tenille,
Debbie Boone) on Armed Forces Radio, wooed, semi-transgendered, wed, and then
abandoned in a Kansas trailer park by her soldier boy, forced to shift for
herself as a nanny for yet another military man, whose born-again teenage son
Tommy becomes her musical protégé and almost lover.  Together they write songs
and create his Tommy Gnossis persona, but when he discovers her angry inch and
departs in revulsion, he takes her songs and all the credit and becomes a star. 
One question that nags is why, with the same material, Tommy is a superstar and
Hedwig is playing the salad circuit.  It would be hard to make the case that
gender confusion has been a drag on success in the rock era.
     `Hedwig' is all about duality and wholeness.  With the help of some
kaleidoscopically imaginative animation by Emily Hubley (daughter of veteran
animators Faith and John Hubley), it draws on sources as diverse as Plato and
the Berlin wall to explore the case that all of us are divided, all of us
contain masculine and feminine, all of us are searching for that complementary
self who will make us whole.  As philosophy that's all very well and good, and
probably as original as you want it to be.  What makes this movie rock is the
terrific performance of Mitchell in drag, bearing a startling resemblance to
Rachel Griffiths, and singing the daylights out of a slew of very listenable
songs in the glam rock tradition of David Bowie and Lou Reed, penned by fellow
cast member Stephen Trask.  Completing the drag race is Miriam Shor as Yitzak,
Hedwig's lead guitarist and lover, in vintage Axl Rose whiskers and doing a
creditable job of sensitive maleness to help stir the broth.  When at the end
Shor morphs back into a woman and Mitchell into a man, sort of, it bridges the
genderation gap and closes the circle.
     When a movie starts off with the pinwheeling fireworks this one musters,
you pray for it not to lose that magical edge; regrettably, those prayers are
not answered.  `Hedwig' bogs down in love story sentimentality and passages
that, for all of their brash naughtiness, are no better than soapsuds beneath
the glitter.  But momentum counts for a lot, and almost carries it over the
soggy parts.  

Title
Review for Kyua (1997)
     As I write, smoke and debris envelope lower Manhattan and the Pentagon on a
day of incomprehensible horror and unforeseeable implications.  We will know
more by the time this appears in print, but it seems to be the coordinated work
of suicide terrorists, controlled by authorities and allegiances as yet unknown.
     Perhaps in the grip of today's context it is difficult not to filter
everything through the trauma of this evil.  Writer/director Kiyoshi (no
relation to Akira) Kurosawa's 1997 film is about a series of grisly, ritualized
murders, connected in style but committed by different people.  The murderers
are all easily found; they know what they've done, but they don't know why.  `It
seemed like the natural thing to do at the time,' one says.  The victims are
strangers, friends, loved ones.  Detective Takabe (Koji Yakusho of `Shall We
Dance') and his psychologist colleague Sakuma (Tsuyoshi Ujiki) grope for
theories (`The devil made them do it'), and finally hit upon the answer: the
killers seem to have been operating under the hypnotic control of a shadowy
stranger, a veritable Johnny Appleseed of murder.  
     The premise is a shaky one in literal terms.  Most of what we know about
hypnosis from a layman's perspective (which is to say, from movies and TV shows)
suggests that people cannot be hypnotized to do something abhorrent to them, and
this is touched on but not pursued in `Cure'.  And the ease with which people
are brought under hypnotic trance also stretches credulity.  In the classic `The
Manchurian Candidate', Laurence Harvey's hypnotic suggestion is triggered by a
playing card, but the groundwork has been laid over months of captivity and
treatment.  Here the trigger is just a simple, but there's no preparation, and
the effects are instantaneous and devastating.
     But there are many layers of darkness at work here, and Kurosawa may be
suggesting that the most unimaginable atrocities are not abhorrent to us at some
level.  
     The story cuts away from Takabe's investigation of the murders periodically
to follow the wanderings of a rootless young man whose name, from a label in his
overcoat, seems to be Mamiya (Masato Hagiwara).  He claims to have no idea who
he is or where he is.  He suffers from amnesia of the `How long have you had
this problem?' `What problem?' variety.  The suspicion grows from time to time
that he may be dissembling, but we never know for sure.  There are many things
we never know for sure, including who he is, where he comes from, and what he
wants.  Motives are almost entirely absent from the eerie world Kurosawa creates
here; there may even be something supernatural at work.  `No one understands
what motivates a criminal,' the psychologist Sakuma repeats on several
occasions, and while one might take issue with that as blanket truth, it applies
here.   
     Complicating Detective Takabe's job and distracting his professional focus
is the fact that his wife also suffers from a degenerative amnesia.  This
personal tragedy ties him with particular force to the man he is investigating,
who seems to know more than he should about the detective's situation and even
what goes on inside his head.
     Kurosawa keeps his colors muted and his camera at a distance from the
action for the most part, telling the story with dispassionate coolness.  He
strews the field with questions, but is not generous with answers.  You'll leave
the theater baffled by things that have no apparent explanation  who is the man
in the dry cleaners, and what is his relationship with Takabe?  `Cure' is
intriguing, frustrating, and sometimes annoying.  It's also hypnotic.  Even when
the crimes are solved and the guilty brought to bay, there is none of the sense
of closure that we expect.  In a way that disconcertingly reflects the world
around us, something ominous and ungraspable still hangs in the air, refusing to
be exorcized by the closing credits.

Title
Review for Serendipity (2001)
Serendipity is a popular ice cream parlor on Manhattan's Upper East Side. 
It's a nice place to get a sweet syrupy confection, and so is the movie to which
it lends its name, although the latter's labored contrivances come close to
pushing it over the edge, or driving us over the edge, whichever comes first. 
What keeps the movie palatable is the irresistibility of its two leads, John
Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, and the siren appeal of New York City at its most
winsomely romantic, a city caught inside a sparkling snow globe.  
Jonathan (Cusack) and Sara (Beckinsale, with her real accent) meet over a
pair of cashmere gloves at Bloomingdale's in the Christmas rush.  It's love at
first sight -- but Sara is more of a believer in second sight, and other
mystical phenomena.  They spend a magical Manhattan evening together, eating ice
cream, making witty small talk, riding the elevator at the Waldorf Astoria, ice
skating in Central Park, and tracing on her freckles the heavenly outline of
Cassiopeia, "who made one tragic mistake, and paid for eternity."  But they both
have romantic entanglements, and she won't give him her name or phone number. 
She does, however, write them in a copy of a novel which she sells to a used
bookstore.  She has him write his on a $5 bill, which she immediately spends. 
If fate brings these items back into their possession, they'll know they were
meant to be together.  (The novel is Love in the Time of Cholera, which is about
as close as the movie comes to acknowledging that there may be a dark underbelly
to this world.)
Time passes.  You know time has passed, because you get clocks spinning
their hands, sundials sweeping their shadows, and then, just in case you didn't
get it, the words "A few years later" superimposed on the screen.  
Jon's about to be married to Halley (Bridget Moynahan).  She's a lovely
girl, bur she isn't Kate Beckinsale.  Sara's moved to the other coast, where
she's about to be married to Lars (John Corbett).  He's a New Age musician,
which is all the information you need about that.  Before taking the final
plunge into sparkless matrimony, they each decide to make one last whirlwind try
at finding that lost perfect love.  
Each is accompanied in this quest by a Faithful Friend.  Jon's is his best
buddy Dean (Jeremy Piven, Cusack's real-life sidekick), an obit writer at the
New York Times (another acknowledgement of life's tragic side.)  Piven is very
funny, especially in his rehearsal dinner toast.  Less successful is SNL's Molly
Shannon as Sara's pal Eve, who owns a San Francisco New Age shop but doesn't
believe that sappy mystical stuff.  Neither, by this time, does Sara, and small
wonder, seeing where that sort of thing has gotten her in the past.  The movie
uses these friendships to make several coy allusions to homosexuality, but
there's neither substance or purpose to them.
There are some wonderful scenes.  One of the best showcases Eugene Levy as
a devious martinet of a Bloomingdale's salesman.  But more and more, as the
story doubles back and forth across its paths of near-miss and extravagant
coincidence, the bubbly charm of the earlier scenes give way to the tortured 
tyrannies of plot, until the characters seem to be racing from place to place at
the demands of the script and the director rather than in response to any inner
voice of their own.  And as the movie whirls to its inevitable conclusion, it
dodges its responsibilities in dealing with the messiness that comes with the
disposing of pleasant characters who have become no longer necessary.  (It also
disposes discreetly of those awkward reminders of unpleasantness on the New York
skyline, the twin towers of the World Trade Center.)  
"Serendipity" is a romantic comedy, and there's no reason why it should
have to deal with anything it doesn't want to, as long as the romance is
romantic and the comedy is comic.  Screwball comedy thrived as a distraction to
the Great Depression, romantic comedy helped us through WWII, and there's
probably enough of what it takes in this slight but sweet indulgence to pry us
away from CNN and take us out of ourselves for an hour and a half of easy
watching.  It's predictable, and it's exasperating, but it's pretty inoffensive.
 "Serendipity" is "An Affair to Remember" without the accident and the
wheelchair, and with a lot more laughs.

Title
Review for Songcatcher (1999)
There should be a special place in purgatory for filmmakers who dig into a
wonderful subject and ruin it for everybody else by making a bad movie.  Maggie
Greenwald's Songcatcher ventures into the mountains of Appalachia at the turn of
the last century to mine the rich traditions of the folk music that had come
over with immigrants from the British Isles a couple of centuries before and had
survived, almost unchanged, to that time.  The music is good.  But the story,
the writing, and the direction are a travesty.  Songcatcher is artistic strip
mining, leaving the territory it plunders bare, forlorn, and unusable.
Greenwald has researched her subject and drawn on historical characters,
but the fictional characters and situations she has created don't suggest real
people in that place at that time.  Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer) is a
musicologist at an Eastern college.  She's a feisty one, aggressive sexually and
ambitious professionally.  When she's rejected for tenure because of her gender,
it riles her up.
This happens in the first scene, and it's a revealing scene for its
self-conscious exposition.  She's been passed over in favor of a male
musicologist -- "Cyrus Whittle,' her department chairman announces smugly, `who,
as you know, has almost singlehandedly created the revival of the English folk
song."  Scene after scene will follow this lead  uneasy, unconvincing moments
between badly drawn characters assembled to advance a forced narrative and an
afterthought of a love story, all in the service of a set of late-20th century
perspectives on social issues.  
After her snub in academia, Dr. Penleric heads off to Appalachia to visit
her sister Elna (Jane Adams) who has started a mountain school with her friend
Harriet (E. Katherine Kerr).  When Lily discovers the two are lesbians, she's
disgusted, but she finds a welcome distraction in the treasure of old folk songs
that the mountain people sing.  She starts collecting the songs, on paper and on
wax cylinders, but she runs into opposition from a local named Tom (Aidan
Quinn), who suspects that she's out to exploit his people.  
How he comes to change his mind about her, how she gradually sheds her
uppity, pedantic airs, how the lesbian cat escapes the bag and triggers
melodrama, heartbreak, and destruction in paradise, are matters best left for
the movie to unfold.  Sequences like the one in which Lily runs in panic through
the nighttime woods and emerges into a field in broad daylight provide the
respite of puzzlement.  The music makes some of it bearable, but even the
musical scenes are not an unalloyed gift.  There are a few pure moments, such as
the great bluesman Taj Mahal being trotted out for one brief guitar riff and
then packed off again into the wings, but Aidan Quinn, fine actor though he is,
fails to convince either with his playing of the banjo or the guitar or the
character.  The orphan Deladis (Emmy Rossum) and the old granny Viney (Pat
Carroll) sing us a number of ballads, and do pretty well with the music, but the
acting is a burden.  McTeer is a former Oscar nominee, but here the odds are
stacked against her.
Any movie that can arouse compassion is worthy of notice, and this movie
does arouse compassion for the poor actors, exposed in scene after scene without
the decent covering of adequate dialogue or direction.

Title
Review for Apocalypse Now (1979)
As America reels under the agony of terrorism and Washington rattles its
saber at Afghanistan, and CNN unfurls the banner of `AMERICA'S NEW WAR' across
our television screens, it's as good a time as any to remember another war in an
inaccessible land halfway around the world.  After 22 years, Francis Ford
Coppola has finally completed his Vietnam epic, `Apocalypse Now'.  When he
introduced it at Cannes in 1979, the director described it as `a work in
progress,' and complained of critics carping at a picture that wasn't even
finished, though it was coming out in theaters.  He was 100% over budget (a
then-scandalous $31 million), more than a year over schedule, battered in mind,
body, and spirit from massive production disasters of God's making and his own,
and under intense pressure to deliver a movie that would not tax the attention
span of its audience.  Sounding a little unhinged by the strain, he declared at
a press conference `This picture isn't about Vietnam.  It is Vietnam.'
Now, working with his original editor Walter Murch from the original
dailies, he has remixed and re-edited, and restored some 49 minutes from the
cutting room floor.  He calls this revisited version `Apocalypse Now Redux'.  
Now that it's finally ready for the critics, how is it?  It's extraordinary. 
Coppola, who's now in the wine business, has learned a little something about
letting things age and ripen.  At 2 ˝  hours the original release was hardly
rushed, but the restored footage expands and enlightens the director's Dantesque
vision of a world gone mad with war.
The story, briefly, is a Vietnam adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novella
Heart of Darkness.  Marlow becomes Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), a Special
Forces assassin who is given a mission to go up river, locate a rogue American
colonel named Kurtz (Marlon Brando), and `terminate him with extreme prejudice.'
 As he studies Kurtz's brilliant résumé, and as he draws closer to his quarry,
Willard comes to understand and even admire the man, and becomes increasingly
aware that the darkness is not just in the mad Kurtz, but in the system, in the
war, and in himself.  
The war in `Apocalypse' is a war without a real enemy presence.  It is not
filled with  pitched battles against enemy troops.  The primary thrust is the
American Willard on a mission to destroy the American Kurtz, with a few almost
incidental skirmishes en route, most of them involving civilians.  It is, in
effect, a war with ourselves.
The biggest chunk of restored footage is a scene at a French plantation,
where Willard puts in to bury a slain crewman (Larry Fishburne), and stays for
dinner and a bit of romance amid the ruined elegance of a lost colonial world
unmoored from reality.  Cut originally because it was thought to distract from
the upriver momentum of Willard's quest, it now opens a ghostly window onto the
experience of the French in Vietnam, a cause already lost but not yet learned
from.  `You Americans,' says the French planter (Christian Marquand), `you are
fighting for the biggest nothing in history.'  
Another resurrected scene has Willard bargaining fuel for sexual favors for
his men from a stranded USO troupe of Playboy bunnies.  This scene doesn't work
as well as it should, and smacks of pandering, but it has a point to make about
exploitation.  The rest of the additions serve to deepen the sense of place and
character.
The intervening years have given `Redux' a deeper resonance.  Many of the
lines of dialogue and narration vibrate like lost chords.  Those young actors
have grown older, but in the movie they're like soldiers thawed from memory on
the battlefield.  Martin Sheen was a down-the-ladder choice for the role of
Willard.  Coppola had wanted Pacino, Caan, Nicholson, even Clint Eastwood.  He'd
hired Harvey Keitel, then fired him, and settled at last on Sheen.  Looking at
it now it is apparent, as it was not to me then, that Sheen mustered a
heroically intense performance that is both wild-eyed and understated, nearly
killing himself with a heart attack in the process.  That he survived and is
now, in our hearts and television sets, the President of the United States,
gives that youthful military assassin an extra dimension.
Robert Duvall's celebrated Col. Kilgore is as vivid as ever, swaggering
through smoke and bullets, destroying a village to make a beach safe for
surfing, and relishing `the smell of napalm in the morning.'  But added moments
showing Kilgore compassionately helping wounded Vietnamese children, only to
drop them without a thought when the surf comes up, give a new insight to his
character, and ours.  Duvall has said in interviews he feels the added footage
shows that Kilgore is more than just a madman, but Coppola seems to me to be
making a different point  that we Americans enjoy our moment of compassion, but
we're easily distracted.  
Brando, who demanded and got the obscene sum of one million dollars (a
figure now tinny with irony, like Dr. Evil's world ransom) for playing Kurtz,
shocked the filmmakers and the public in '79 with his corpulence.  Coppola
swathed him in heavy shadows to conceal it, but with  today's huge Brando for a
point of reference, the man looks trim.  Anyway, why shouldn't Kurtz have been
fat?  He was living deep in the jungle, without a military regimen, deified by
Montagnard tribesmen who catered to his every whim.  Like Brando's in Tahiti,
Kurtz's situation is conducive to weight gain.  Brando is said to have toyed
with his young director, improvising dialogue, playing mind games, and behaving
arrogantly.  Whatever hell he put Coppola through, it works  Brando's
megalomania infuses Kurtz with a freakish truth that a disciplined, scripted
performance might not have accomplished. 
They don't make movies like this any more.  One has only to compare this
summer's big war movie, `Pearl Harbor', to see what accountancy and digital
gimcrackery have wrought on the genre.  Of course, they didn't make movies like
this back then, either  or perhaps only then, in that brief blaze of youthful
talent fueled with funds that seemed limitless, that produced `The Deer Hunter'
and `Apocalypse Now' and a few other works of impassioned, lunatic genius.  `The
way we made it was very much like the way the Americans were in Vietnam,'
Coppola said then.  `We were in the jungle, we had access to too much money and
too much equipment, and little by little we went insane.'
And now, we're back at war again.  As Kurtz observes, `the horror.'

Review for American Rhapsody, An (2001)
At a '50s California backyard barbeque to celebrate the family's reunion
with 6-year-old Suzanne (Kelly Endresz Banlaki), who was separated from her
parents at infancy and raised behind the Iron Curtain, her father proposes a
toast : `America  the greatest country in the world!'  It's a perspective we
appreciate today with special poignancy, as the Stars & Stripes fly from our
porches and flutter from our cars.  
Eva Gardos, the writer/director of this autobiographical film, traveled a
difficult road to her appreciation of this country.  In fact, it wasn't even
this country to which her family fled from communist Hungary in the early
Fifties.  They came to Canada, but Canada has a smaller movie market, so the
cinema version of her family wound up in southern California.
`An American Rhapsody' begins in Casablanca-esque  black-and-white, as
Peter (Tony Goldwyn) and Margit (Nastassja Kinski) escape from Budapest with
their 5-year-old daughter, leaving baby Suzanne to be smuggled out separately a
day or two later by a woman who specializes in baby-smuggling.  But all does not
go according to plan, and the baby winds up stuck in Hungary, to be raised by a
childless couple (Zsuzsa Czinkoczi and Balazs Galko) in the countryside.  The
family has made it safely to Vienna (which is steeped in color like the land of
Oz) and procured visas for America, but they have to go on without the baby.  
Her parents work tirelessly to secure her release, but it takes years.  By
the time Suzanne makes it to America, she's a little Hungarian girl, devoted to
her Hungarian `parents'.  It's not an easy adjustment to this strange family
that declares itself to be her own (especially with the Fifties songs that
drench the soundtrack  `Primrose Lane' and what sounds like the white-bread
Georgia Gibbs cover of LaVerne Baker's classic `Tweedlee Dee'.)  In a way
Suzanne is just an extreme version of many children who suspect they somehow
wound up in the wrong family.  She grows into a rebellious teenager (Scarlett
Johansson), and battles horribly with her mother, who tries to control her in
much the same way the Russians did the Hungarians, with bars and chains on her
room.  Finally in 1965 she convinces her parents to let her return to Budapest,
where she has a chance to see first hand the country that has survived as a
paradise in her nostalgic childhood dreams.
`An American Rhapsody' is a heartfelt and affecting story, without being in
the first rank of the cinematic craft.  In can err into the soapish and the
heavy-handed.  There is some confusion in the telling, especially when it deals
with the reasons for the family's flight from Hungary.  Peter is a publisher,
and we assume it's free-speech trouble with the authorities that makes it
essential for him to get out, particularly when Suzanne tells us in voice over
`Father said everybody he knew was either in jail, or going to jail, or worse' 
But near the end of the movie we discover that there's an entirely different,
and more melodramatic, reason for the escape.  The end of the movie itself is a
problem  after lingering more than necessary over some of the earlier periods,
it rushes to a conclusion that telescopes too much into too little time, giving
it a simplistic comic book feel.
But the movie's emotional resonance outweighs its shortcomings, and a large
slice of the credit goes to Ms. Johansson (`Ghost World'), who digs into the
essence of her character and delivers something utterly believable and
thoroughly moving.  Tony Goldwyn, getting a chance to shed his bad guy shackles,
is excellent as the understanding father, and the Hungarian contingent,
particularly little Kelly Endresz Banlaki, is marvelous.  
`An American Rhapsody' is a timely reminder of the preciousness and
privilege of many of the things we take for granted in this country, and of the
fundamental value of having a place where we belong.

Review for Kiss of the Dragon (2001)
      Jet Li has played bad guys, and he has played good guys, and it isn't 
easy to tell the difference.  Kiss of the Dragon begins with supercop Liu 
Jian (Li) arriving in France from Beijing to work with the French cops in 
busting a Chinese heroin ring.
Is this your first visit to Paris? asks the customs officer.
It is.  And a good thing, too.  Everywhere he goes devastation tags 
along like a pet Biblical plague.  He doesn t seem to ask for trouble, but 
trouble doesn't wait to be asked.  If Paris should be unlucky enough to 
host Kiss of the Dragon 2, there won t be a building or a body left 
standing, no tourists to insult and no Parisians to insult them.
There s not much plot to Dragon, and no suspense.  That wouldn't be 
so bad nobody goes to a martial arts movie for plot or suspense but there's 
nothing much in the way of character or cleverness either. The sound is 
harsh, the music is strident, and the direction is inept.  Worst of all, 
there's no soul.  Li takes on all comers, singly, in pairs, by the dozens, 
with the same cold efficiency.  He scarcely ever breaks a sweat, and never 
changes expression.  Chop, wham, crunch, pop, slam! and off he goes, 
unsmiling, unwrinkled, and unconcerned.
Director Chris Nahon and his mentor, producer/screenwriter Luc 
Besson, seem to have understood the basic soullessness of their product, so 
they inserted a soulful character in the form of a whore with a heart of 
gold.  Jessica (Bridget Fonda) is a nice girl from North Dakota who has 
somehow wound up in Paris, had a daughter out of wedlock, got hooked on 
drugs, and got her daughter kidnapped by the villainous Inspector Richard 
(Tcheky Karyo) of the Paris police.  Now he's forcing her to work the 
streets to get her little girl back.  This whoring is clearly against her 
will, but sometimes she seems better adjusted to it than others.  The first 
time we see her she is so nauseated at the prospect of servicing a Chinese 
drug lord in a luxury hotel room along with another hooker that she flees 
to the bathroom and escapes the ensuing massacre by throwing up.  Later on, 
though, she's more than willing to repay Li for his gift of a couple of 
bags of shrimp chips with the only coin she has at her disposal.
We meet Inspector Richard (this movie is shot in France with French 
people, but everybody speaks English, and the inspector isn t even Ree-shar 
, he s just plain Richard) in the act of pounding a helpless man to death 
with his fists in a hotel kitchen, so we are left with no doubts as to his 
badness.  We quickly see where this badness is headed he plans to frame the 
Chinese cop for a few of his brutal killings, but Li escapes with a 
computer disc containing visual evidence of Richard s guilt.  Boy, is he mad!
For the rest of the movie Richard has the entire Paris police force 
out after Li.  The cops spend most of their time annihilating everything in 
sight with automatic weapons, Hong Kong movie style.  Hotels, bridges, 
cars, bateaux mouches, sewers, shops, and police headquarters are reduced 
to powder.  There s more broken glass than you'd find at a Russian New Year's
Eve party.  They do show a little restraint with the gunfire when they 
get the drop on Li at a girl s orphanage, which I thought showed a nice 
touch of delicacy.  Li fights back with hands, feet, the occasional 
firearm, and a wrist band of little acupuncture needles that he uses 
expertly for good or ill and never for more ill than in the forbidden Kiss 
of the Dragon.
Li moves through it all with the look of a jaded Puritan minister, 
black-clad and joyless. His martial arts moves are phenomenal, but without 
a story or a sense of style to give them purpose they lose their power to 
entertain.

Title
Review for Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001)
     It is said that in preparation for his role as a music-loving WWII Italian
officer in the John Madden movie Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Nicolas Cage
communed with the spirit of his departed grandfather, Carmine Coppola.  Whatever
the old man gave him, it wasn't a credible Italian accent.  Cage made a good
Italian-American in the 1987 comedy Moonstruck, but as an Italian-Italian he
does not cut the pasta.  This is too bad, because when the central character of
a movie leaves a hole the size of Naples, the rest of the movie is hard-pressed
not to sink right through it.  
     Another disadvantage for a movie that is primarily a love story is a lack
of chemistry between its lovers.  Cage has become an action star, and has lost
the knack of connecting romantically to anyone other than himself.  His love
interest here is Penelope Cruz (rumored soon to be Penelope Cruz-Cruise), a
Spanish actress impersonating a Greek maiden named Pelagia.  Cruz is an
appealing sort, and very good in Spanish movies like All About My Mother, but
her appeal so far has resisted English translation.  The third corner of the
movie's romantic triangle is the talented young British actor Christian Bale
(American Psycho) who's been chopped and channeled into the illiterate Greek
partisan Mandras, a job of tailoring on a par with Natalie Wood playing a Native
American.
     The best acting comes from the always reliable John Hurt as Pelegia's
father, the local doctor, who narrates part of the movie.  Hurt may not seem
very Greek either, but he commands the screen with his hooded eyes and his
slow-moving, rumpled dignity.  Also good is David Morrissey as a German soldier
who would like to be a good guy and join in the Italians' carousing,
opera-singing good fellowship, but doesn't quite have it in him.  And worth
mentioning is the great Greek actress Irene Pappas, who plays Mandras's mother;
unfortunately, being really Greek, she sticks out like a sore thumb in this
company.
     The movie was shot on the island of Cephalonia, where the bestselling novel
by Louis de Bernieres was set, and Cephalonia at least does not disappoint. 
John Toll's camera lingers lovingly on the sparkling sapphire water, and moves
through the dappled hillsides and the dusty little town with the lazy
timelessness of an Aegean afternoon.  But Madden, who combined history, romance,
literature, and humor so effortlessly in Shakespeare In Love, seems at a loss
here without a Tom Stoppard screenplay to set him up.  
     The screenplay in hand is by Shawn Slovo, who last wrote a movie a dozen
years ago and probably should have quit while he was ahead.  Here he has the
thankless task of filleting out the cinematic spine of a well-loved novel,
figuring out what to keep, what to jettison, and what to invent.  He tries a bit
of all three. Those who loved the book will find some passages brought to life,
major themes and plotlines and character traits abandoned, and a few surprises,
including a Hollywood ending that even the studio wanted to reshoot. 
    Captain Corelli's Mandolin is by no means hopeless.  It looks good, and it
sometimes comes to life with real tension, particularly when the bad guys show
up in the form of vicious Nazi occupiers come to supplant the hedonistic Fascist
occupiers who have fraternized to excess with the natives and have abandoned the
Fuhrer's cause.  The movie surprises itself with flashes of drama and moments of
heroism.  But at its soft center, where Cage grapples romantically with Cruz,
and vainly with his Inner Italian, the movie is yet another of the high-profile
disappointments of 2001.

Title
Review for Made (2001)
In this appealingly off-center black comedy Vince Vaughn plays something
very close to the perfect jerk.  The gap between who Ricky is and who he thinks
he is, between his self-confidence and his self-awareness, between his level of
intelligence and his level of hubris, is blinding.  And Vaughn handles the role
with the sure-footedness and bursts of improvisational inspiration of a Kobe
Bryant going coast-to-coast for a layup.  It's a gutsy, antagonizing performance
sewn with just enough seeds of endearment to keep it from ricocheting off the
screen.
Still, it wouldn't work without the low-key finesse of costar Jon Favreau
as Bobby, a down-to-earth plug who balances his buddy's spectacular asininity
with his own plodding good sense.  Favreau, who also wrote and directed Made, is
a sort of latter-day William Bendix (of the 50s sitcom Life of Reilly.)
Vaughn and Favreau made an impact five years ago in Swingers, which was
also written by Favreau.  Here he doesn't try to extend the same characters, but
they're clearly related.  Bobby and Ricky are a pair of losers who scrabble at
the fringes of society, finding different ways to fail at a number of low-end
pursuits.  They're boxers, laborers, petty criminals.  Neither of them are too
bright, but Bobby at least has a solid head on his solid shoulders.  He's in
love with Jess (Famke Janssen), a lap-dancer in the stable of a West Coast crime
boss named Max (Peter Falk).  He `drives' (bodyguards) her until his jealous,
protective heart gets him canned by Max for decking a customer who gets out of
line.  
Max likes Bobby.  When he has to fire him from one job, he offers him
another  a trip to New York to deliver a package.  Max doesn't like Ricky, who
has managed to lose a van from his carpet-cleaning business, but he agrees to
let Bobby take him along on the operation, which is first class all the way. 
Why a canny guy like Max would send two shmoes first class to New York and put
them up in a ritzy hotel and give them a chauffeured limo and a hefty per diem
in order to do a drop that could perfectly well be done by his efficient New
York people, headed by Ruiz (Sean Combs), is a question best not examined too
closely.  It's simply a vehicle, in the tradition of the classic comedy team
movies of Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello, designed to get these
mismatched louts, this Yin and Yang of ineptitude, into a set of situations
where they can do their worst, and best.  
The cleverness of Made is certainly not in the plotting.  There's no `wow!'
twist, no layers and levels peeled away for a socko revelation.  This movie
works in its dialogue, and in the rapport of its characters.  Vaughn's
performance is dazzling, an edgy, obnoxious tour-de-force that makes you wince
while it makes you laugh.  Favreau, from his director's and writer's seat, is
content to cede the limelight to his buddy, and to let his own character provide
a cautious touchstone that gives the audience a place to park its sympathies. 
Combs lends a savvy New York cool, and stares incredulously as Ricky tries to
impress with his gangsta hipness; `Man, what is all this 21 Jump Street stuff?'
he asks.  Falk is wise and wizened, a made veteran who can shift from
compassionate to threatening on a dime.  The beautiful Famke Janssen doesn't get
much to do outside of her lap-dancing, but little Mackenzie Vega as her daughter
is adorable, and the rapport between her and Favreau provides one of the movie's
satisfying emotional chords.

Title
Review for Vengo (2000)
`Vengo' is a concert movie from which a vendetta plot keeps trying to break
out.  When it faces the music, it dances.  When it wanders into plot, it gets
hopelessly lost.
It's not that the plot is so complex.  You've got two clans of Spanish
gypsies who keep killing each other; and forgive and forget are not words that
you'll find in your English-to-Gypsy dictionary.   Caco (Antonio Canales) is the
head of one clan, and the rival Caravaca family wants the blood of his brother
for having killed one of theirs.  The brother is hiding out in Algiers, so
they're willing to settle for his son Diego (Orestes Villasan Rodriguez).  It
appears the Caravaca clan may have killed Caco's beloved daughter.  She's dead,
anyway, and Caco makes many grieving visits to her grave.  Caco realizes the
futility of this never-ending cycle of retribution, and wants to find a way to
end it; but the Caravacas are implacably bent on revenge.  
Caco's nephew Diego, on whom he dotes,  has something that could be
cerebral palsy.  It causes him to lurch when he walks and contort his mouth when
he talks, but he does not seem to be mentally handicapped  the things he says
makes sense, and would fit perfectly well into the mouth of an ordinary
sensitive young man.  Rodriguez plays him with energy, but I never had any
trouble believing that it was an actor putting on the trappings of affliction. 
Canales, who is a celebrated flamenco dancer in Spain, drags around as Caco with
the weight of the world on his shoulders, and doesn't get to do a lick of
dancing, which is like casting Elvis in a musical in a non-singing role.  It can
be done, but what's the point?  Canales is an arresting-looking man, but you're
more aware of what he's not doing than what he is, and you keep waiting for that
flamenco boot to drop.
Aside from Caco and Diego, it's pretty hard to figure out who anybody is in
this vast and wild assortment of darkly-dressed gypsy clansmen, and harder still
to care.  What we do care about is the music.  Director Tony Gatlif ("Latcho
Drom", "Gadjo Dilo") has enlisted the talents of some of the great contemporary
flamenco artists: Tomatito, Sheikh Ahmad al Tuni, La Caita, Gritos de Guerra,
and La Paquera de Jerez.  If he doesn't have much of a feel for story, he does
have a gut sense of what the music is about, and the alertness to step aside and
let it rip.  Sitting around in bars singing, breaking into dance on a flatbed
truck, the musicians seem to live the music which springs spontaneously out of 
centuries of intense feeling  rage, laughter, passion, cruelty, anguish, love,
and death. It's raw, it's transfixing, and it feels completely authentic, a
music not shaped for the cabaret or the concert hall, but protected and
preserved for the cathartic release of the people who make it.  With his bona
fides in the gypsy world, Gatlif has been able to persuade some of these
reclusive and limelight-shunning artists to venture out into the glare of lights
and camera, and has caught something remarkable on film.
The movie looks good.  Gatlif and cinematographer Thierry Pouget set a
handsome screen, with barren desert vistas of Andalusia, and dark, shadowy night
clubs and back alleys of Seville.  The uninspired storytelling and hackneyed
plot don't really matter so much, except that they take up our time and tax our
attention.  The story came to him, Gatlif says, after a night of tossing and
turning: `I slept little, and in the morning, everything was clearI knew that
vengeance was what the film was about.'
He's got a great handle on the music.  Maybe next time, with a bit more
sleep, he'll get the rest of it worked out.

Title
Review for Ghost World (2001)
Terry Zwigoff made `Crumb', the startling, insidiously brilliant
documentary about cartoonist R. Crumb and his world-class dysfunctional family. 
With his first fiction film, `Ghost World', Zwigoff stays on the underground
comics reservation, tackling the comic book of the same name by Dan Clowes, who
collaborated on the screenplay.
Enid (Thora Birch of `American Beauty') and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson of
`The Horse Whisperer') are a couple of high school misfits who have ostracized
themselves from the shallow mainstream.  They stand apart, lips pursed in
cynical scorn at the hypocrisy and false values of the world they inhabit at
arm's length.  At their high school graduation, an uplifting speech is given by
a girl strapped to a wheelchair and propped up by an erector set of braces.  In
the audience, Enid winces.  `I liked her better when she was an alcoholic and
drug addict. She gets in one stupid car crash and suddenly she's Little Miss
Perfect." 
But for all its traumas, high school affords a buffer against the quicksand
of the real world.  It's a safe house where poses, even the pose of outsiderdom,
are easier to maintain.  As graduation recedes, Enid and Rebecca are faced with
getting on with the rest of their lives.  College isn't an option; though
they're smart as whips, they want nothing to do with the structured expectations
of more schooling  though you half suspect, in a world beyond the last frame of
this movie, that someday Enid may reconsider.  What they want now is their own
apartment, that first great badge of adulthood and independent life.  That means
getting a job.  Rebecca finds one at Starbucks, and begins drifting away from
Enid and the Puritanical code of alienation that has forged their sisterhood.
Enid can't hold a job.  Her determined truth-telling gets in the way.  So
she continues to live at home with her well-meaning but ineffectual father (Bob
Balaban), and forms an unlikely relationship with a lonely-hearts loser named
Seymour (Steve Buscemi), whom she encounters first while playing a cruel prank
on him, but later comes to understand and appreciate, because "he's the exact
opposite of all the things I hate."  
Seymour has practically no illusions about himself.  He knows he's a dork,
he knows he hasn't a ghost of a chance with women.  He collects old jazz
records, one of the blessed refuges of the marginalized; jazz taps into a
spirituality that floats above the rat race of societal positioning, its pioneer
artists were marginalized themselves by a white society, and anyway discs of
grooved, recorded acetate don't judge or betray.   
`Ghost World' is based on a comic book, and it reflects its origins in a
surface depth that implies more meaning than it delivers.  It's nominally a
comedy, but it's more `hmm' than `ho-ho.'  It moves a bit haltingly, with
awkward editing, as if progressing along cartoon frames on a printed page, and
there's a designed flatness to the color and the visual plane.  Some of its plot
turns, particularly the romantic pairing of Seymour and a lady from the
personals, aren't persuasive.  But it digs at truths both disturbing and
amusing.  Enid has to attend a summer art class to fulfill her graduation
requirements, and she encounters a post-hippie teacher (Illeana Douglas) who is
dismissive of her cartoons (drawn for the screen by Crumb's cartoonist daughter
Sophie) and only values conceptual art.  Enid, borrowing an old poster from
Seymour, comes up with a humdinger of a concept.  
The great lift of this movie comes from its two excellent central
performances.  Thora Birch, playing an antiheroine role that a few years ago
might have gone to Christina Ricci, radiates intelligence through her hip
dissatisfaction, and promises a character with many worlds to explore as she
grows older.  And Buscemi grounds Seymour in a clear-eyed pathos that is both
funny and heartbreakingly true.  
Almost, but not quite, as funny, heartbreaking, and true as R. Crumb.

Title
Review for Scary Movie 2 (2001)
      It must be said of Scary Movie 2 that it is a very fluid 
movie.  Pretty much every fluid that can emerge from the human body does 
emerge from the human body, in living color and copious, screen-filling 
quantities.  There is solid waste as well, and of course the indispensable 
gaseous emissions without which no contemporary American comedy worthy of 
the name would dream of being seen or heard.
In short, Scary Movie 2 has pretty much everything that its 
chart-busting antecedent Scary Movie had except an original idea.  It has 
the same cast, more or less, including those wacky eternal college kids 
Shawn Wayans (30), Marlon Wayans (29), and Tori Spelling (28), and 
including a lot of characters who were killed in the original.  It has the 
same pacing, the same quality of jokes, the same striving tastelessness.
2 opens in a place called Hell House with an Exorcist take-off, which 
offers one of the few mildly amusing moments in the picture: a group of 
middle-aged white people gathered around a piano singing a rap hit.  But 
before we leave Hell House we are treated to dueling vomit, and the sight 
of James Woods (in the role of the Exorcist) straining and performing at 
top volume on the toilet.  It could have been worse.  The role was 
originally intended for Marlon Brando.
We move from there to One Year Later , and pick things up with our 
heroine Cindy (Anna Faris) now in college.  Evil Professor Oldman (Tim 
Curry) and his wheelchair-bound sidekick Dwight (David Cross) have hatched 
a nefarious research project that involves getting the stupidest 
undergraduates on campus to spend the weekend at a haunted house, the same 
Hell House where the opening Exorcist stuff took place, now presided over 
by Hanson (Chris Elliot), a butler with a deformed hand and mind.  This 
serves as a vehicle for a rapid-fire burst of parodies of haunted house 
movies, but Wayans and his team of seven, count em, writers never heard of 
a joke that didn t involve bodily functions, so if you were looking for wit 
with your haunted house mystery spoof, rent the 1976 Neil Simon movie 
Murder by Death.
Much hilarity is wrung from Hanson's deformed hand, and from Dwight's 
wheelchair, and from Tori Spelling performing ghostly fellatio, and from a 
sexually aggressive talking parrot, and from the heroine using the black 
cat's kitty litter box.  A reasonable definition of what is funny might be 
something that makes you laugh, and at the showing I attended, which was 
also attended by a lot of small children, there was the occasional ripple 
of laughter.  The original Scary Movie was the largest-grossing R-rated 
movie in history, so there is undoubtedly an audience for this one 
too.  But if you are literate enough to be reading a newspaper, it probably 
isn't you.

Review for Musíme si pomáhat (2000)
Divided We Fall, the Czech film that contended against hopeless odds with
Crouching Tiger for last year's Foreign Language Film award, has been linked
more conspicuously with an earlier foreign Oscar-winner, Life Is Beautiful. 
Both, it has been said, are movies that turn the warming light of comedy onto
the darkness of Nazi atrocities during WWII.  
The previews for Divided play up its comic aspect, but in truth, the Czech
film has only the most passing kinship with its Italian predecessor.  Roberto
Benigni's movie used an overtly comic persona to establish a celebration of life
that was able to push itself poignantly and resiliently up through the cracks in
the pavement of Nazi horror.  Jan Hrebejk's, in contrast, is about real people
and real situations, into which a certain amount of humor naturally flows, even
under the circumstance of Germany's wartime occupation of Czechoslovakia.  
In a series of short scenes during the opening credits, Hrebejk runs us
through the years leading up to the occupation.  In the first, three men are out
for a pleasant drive.  They are David (Csongor Kassai), the son of a local
Jewish industrialist; Josef (Boleslav Polivka), a management employee; and 
Horst (Jaroslav Dusek), the company chauffeur.  The scene shifts forward a
couple of years to 1939, and the Jewish family is being evicted from its estate
by the Nazis, who have also confiscated the factory.  Next it's 1941, and David
and his family are being taken from the apartment of Josef and his wife Marie
(Anna Siskova), where they've boarded for a couple of years, to be sent to a
concentration camp.  And then the action moves ahead two more years, to a gaunt
and harrowed David escaping from the camp and returning to seek shelter in his
old home town.
Nobody tries very hard to be funny in Divided.  And when occasionally
farcical situations arise in the course of events, as in a scene where David
cowers in terror under Marie's bedclothes while she wards off the amorous
advances of the Nazi collaborator Horst, terror easily balances the farce. 
There is nothing very funny about a life-or-death situation when the outcome
hangs in the balance.  
But Hrebejk's approach is that life, even under terrible circumstances,
maintains an aspect of the human comedy.  People are funny, whether
intentionally or inadvertently.  Josef has a quiet sense of humor when he's not
cracking under the strain of the terrible risk he's running in sheltering David.
 Horst has no sense of humor  with a straight face he instructs Josef in how to
keep a straight face so as not to let the Germans know what he's thinking.  
Divided is illuminated by wonderful performances.  Horst is a repulsive
opportunistic boor, and yet Dusek plays him with a humanity that makes him real
and justifies plot turns at the end.  Kassai gives David's hunted terror the
support of a quiet strength and dignity.  Siskova makes the beautiful Maria a
woman of practicality, uncertainty, and decency.  And Polivka, one of his
country's leading stage, television, and screen stars, brings tremendous depth
to his role as Josef, a character he based in part on his father, who lost
everything in the war, but `despite being half-broken and unhappy still retained
a gentlemanly type of humor.'  
`You wouldn't believe what abnormal times can do to normal people,' Josef
remarks apologetically to David.  Divided is about normal people in abnormal
times that bring out the best and the worst in them.

Review for Others, The (2001)
`The Others' is an old-fashioned ghost story that aims not to slash the
jugular but to constrict the throat, designed not so much for screams as for
raising the little hairs on the back of the neck.  Writer/director Alejandro
Amenabar (Abres los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) simmers his atmospheric broth with a
slow, sure relish over a low heat, with help immeasurable from the rich, darkly
textured visual flavors supplied by cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe.  The
terrors Amenabar treats us to are terrors of the mind, terrors of the soul,
terrors of the unknown and unseen, terrors of darkness and repression, terrors
of isolation, terrors of a religion designed to put the fear of God into little
children.   
There is very little that can be said about this movie without giving too
much away.  Not much happens for long stretches, but it builds its web strand by
strand, and its pleasures are in the buildup of little discoveries.  It is
probably safe to reveal that this is a haunted house yarn set in the formerly
Nazi-occupied  Isle of Jersey in the English Channel, just after WWII.  Nicole
Kidman plays Grace, whose husband has gone off to war and never returned.  She
lives in an isolated mansion with her two young children, who are afflicted with
a strange and terrible malady that makes it essential that they never be exposed
to daylight.  There is precious little daylight to be had in this dark-paneled
mansion at best; it is perpetually shrouded in a dense fog, and even to go out
for a walk beyond the great iron gate is to risk getting hopelessly and
terrifyingly lost in the swirling, changing mists.   Nevertheless, all the
windows are swathed in thick drawn curtains, and as Grace moves from room to
room she carries a heavy ring of keys with which she unlocks each door and locks
it again behind her to insure against one being carelessly opened or left ajar
to let in lethal daylight.  
A trio of servants  a middle-aged housekeeper (Fionnula Flanagan), an old
gardener (Eric Sykes) and a young maid (Elaine Cassidy) arrive on the doorstep
on the cold, misty morning on which the story begins.  They are quickly
employed, and set to work to replace the previous staff, which has left without
notice, and who's to blame them?  Days pass, there are strange noises, strange
happenings.
It is surely no coincidence that Amenabar has named his heroine Grace. 
With her post-war hairdo, her cool control and her exquisite patrician beauty,
Nicole Kidman bears a startling resemblance to Grace Kelly.  It's a nicely
calculated touch, lending an instant Hitchcockian classicism (and an eerie
reminder of her bizarre and shocking death) to the atmosphere of the film. 
Kidman delivers a skilled performance as a woman walking a shaky tightrope
between self-control and neurosis.  Her religious fanaticism as she home-schools
her children with warnings of `The Children's Limbo' and eternal torment
delivers some of the movie's most disturbing moments.  There is something very
fragile rattling beneath Grace's competent exterior, and something very wrong.
Fionnula Flanagan makes Mrs. Mills, the new housekeeper, a nurturing yet
vaguely malevolent presence, a sort of dark-side Mrs. Piggle Wiggle.  The
children are excellent, both the frightened, trembling little Nicholas (James
Bentley) and his almost preternaturally self-possessed older sister, Anne
(Alakina Mann).  Christopher Eccleston adds a haunting cameo.
There are holes in the story and gaps in its logic, and these can be mildly
troublesome in the last third of the picture.  But Amenabar recovers for an
ending that falls squarely within the traditions of the ghost story genre, like
a tale well told around the campfire.
And now, children, crawl into your tents and try to go to sleep.

Review for Curse of the Jade Scorpion, The (2001)
     Don't expect brilliance every time from Woody Allen..  With the exception
of a few masterpieces like Annie Hall and Manhattan, what Woody makes is movies
-- funny movies, entertaining movies, sometimes very good movies, movies that
earn their claim on our ticket dollars and a few hours of our time.  He's
established a persona who checks in with different names and occupations but the
same neuroses and mannerisms in one dependable movie a year.  He makes movies in
the tradition of Bob Hope, or Charlie Chan.
     The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is a B movie made with A movie talent.  The
period production design by longtime collaborator Santo Loquasto is stunning,
the cinematography by recent Allen acquisition Zhao Fei is rich and satisfying,
the cast, from Oscar-winner Helen Hunt on down is excellent.  Curiously, Hunt is
often unflatteringly lit  perhaps in an effort to narrow the 28-year generation
gap between her and her romantic lead.  Among the richness of characters and
performances, Charlize Theron is a knockout as a Bad Rich Girl.  
     Allen's direction is uneven.  He gets great work out of his cast, but his
pacing is off  there's plenty of down time to read the EXIT signs and count the
change in your pocket.  His screenplay could have used a few more laps around
the word processor.  It's packed with gags, some of them funny, some of them not
(a mix Allen may recognize  he has  Hunt's character describe him as `a little
man who makes bad jokes.').  The plot has a retread familiarity, and its twists
and turns are just not as clever as they ought to be.  On the other hand, it's
not bad.  It passes the time in an amusing way.  It's comfortable.  
     In a way, Scorpion's B-movieness dovetails nicely with its setting.  The
time is 1940, the place of course is Manhattan, and the deal is this: Woody is
C.W. Briggs, an investigator for a big insurance firm run by the affable
Magruder (Dan Aykroyd).  Briggs is an old-school guy, who gathers tips from his
informer network of blind beggars and street riff-raff, hits on the office
secretaries, hangs out in the neighborhood bar, and solves cases by the seat of
his pants.  `I get inside the criminal mind,' he tells his admiring co-workers. 
`I wouldn't want to have me after me.'
     It's a world that should go on forever, but a serpent has invaded his
Garden.  She's an efficiency expert, Miss FitzGerald (Helen Hunt), and she's
messing with the old ways of doing things.  Briggs and FitzGerald get along like
Arafat and Sharon.  In the world of a movie, no two people who hate each other
that much could be headed anywhere but romance.
     The fulcrum on which Allen's plot turns is a scene with a nightclub
hypnotist (David Ogden Stiers).  From there the plot marches inexorably and
inevitably  one might even say familiarly  to its conclusion.  Echoes of
movies past haunt the frames of Scorpion.  You'll recognize bits of The Court
Jester, The Manchurian Candidate, even The Woman in the Window, and others that
nibble at the fringes of memory.  These days we call that sort of thing homage,
a stream Allen fished for his previous (and most commercially successful) movie,
the Big Deal on Madonna Street-flavored Small Time Crooks. 
     For my money, Allen's best movie in recent years is the hilarious and
smartly original Bullets Over Broadway.  He used a surrogate actor (John Cusack)
to star, and more importantly, he worked with a collaborator (Douglas McGrath)
on the script.  It's a formula worth revisiting.

Review for Jeepers Creepers (2001)
After bloody clashes and independence won, Lumumba refused to pander to 
the Belgians, who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship 
with the Congo.  Their officers, particularly General Janssens (Rudi Delhem) 
in the Force Publique, the Congo's Army, caused rebellions, undermining 
Lumumba, who was outraged at the rape and murder of Belgian nationals.  With 
unrest building, Moise Tshombe (Pascal Nzonzi) and the province of Katanga, 
which contained 70 percent of the country's resources, proclaimed secession.  
Lumumba replaced Janssens, making Mobutu a colonel, and went on a pacification
tour with Congolese President Joseph Kasa Vubu (Maka Kotto), but it was too 
late.  'When you want to drown a dog, you say it has rabies,' prophesies
Lumumba of his own fate.
Peck and Bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a
myriad of players, although they frequently succumb to cliche, particularly
regarding Lumumba's private life.  Peck's script illuminates Bantu sayings 
like 'The hand that gives, rules' when Lumumba uses it with the American 
ambassador.  Peck's direction is less assured, with many scenes unfortunately 
playing like standard television fare.  He's served well, though, by his 
casting of Ebouaney in the title role.  Ebouaney is dynamic, radiating his 
character's fierce passion for his people and his country.  Lumumba's 
intelligence and ability to strategize, even as he's cornered by 
insurmountable odds, are given life by Ebouaney.  Peck's subject and lead 
actor elevate his film above its mediocre production.
"Lumumba" is a story that deserves to be told and Ebouaney's performance
makes the tragedy personally felt.

Review for Deep End, The (2001)
     Kids have no idea who their parents are or what they go through.  Parents
are a natural resource, like air or television, indispensable but hardly worth
much thought.  In the taut new thriller `The Deep End', the great Scottish
actress Tilda Swinton (`Orlando') plays Margaret Hall, a Lake Tahoe mom who
juggles laundry, shopping, fixing meals, driving the kids to practice, and
covering up an apparent murder with such nervy aplomb that none of her three
kids tumbles that there's anything unusual going on..  But as the deceased-to-be
points out to her oldest, `She's a mother, not a moron.'
     Writer-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel (`Suture') have taken
Elizabeth Sanxay Holding's 40s novel The Blank Wall (previously filmed in '49
by Max Ophuls as `The Reckless Moment') and updated it, introducing a homosexual
element for contemporary relevance into what is essentially an old-fashioned
woman's melodrama in the Joan Crawford/Barbara Stanwyck tradition.  17-year-old
Beau (Jonathan Tucker) has fallen into a relationship with Darby (Josh Lucas), a
decadently charming thirty-ish sleazebag who is leading him into corrupt ways. 
As the movie opens, Beau has already been an auto accident with Darby, and
Margaret, who disapproves of the relationship without being absolutely certain
of its nature and extent, beards the creep in his lair, a shady club called The
Deep End, and tells him to stay away from her boy.  
     The plot thickens when Darby turns up dead in the shallows by the Halls'
boathouse. Mothers like to think the best of their kids, but they suspect the
worst. Margaret jumps to the conclusion that Beau has done to Darby what she
would like to have done to him. She disposes of the body and the deceased's car
without even asking any questions, and by the time she does get a better picture
of what might actually have happened, she is well down a road that permits no
backing up.  Then the plot thickens some more, adding blackmail and betrayal and
even an off-beat sort of romance to its darkening brew.
     `The Deep End' is awash in water imagery, great (the adjacent Lake Tahoe),
greater (Margaret's absent husband is a naval officer off at sea), small (a
fishtank), and smaller (a room refracted through a drop swelling from a faucet),
and it sometimes goes a little overboard.  Cinematographer Giles Nuttgens shoots
the movie elegantly with a cool palette of underwater washes, punctuated with
strong color only in the bright reds of Margaret's coat and the blackmailer's
car, but once or twice jarring daylight seeps in from outdoors during a night
scene.  There is something a shade improbable in the character of the
blackmailer with a heart of gold (a moodily charismatic and outrageously
handsome Goran Visnjic of `E.R.'), and a climactic scene between him and
Margaret loses its footing on the slippery slope of melodrama.  But none of the
occasional missteps derail the mounting tension.  As the plot swirls along, the
filmmakers keep flinging setbacks at Margaret's feet like marbles, but she
dodges them doggedly and keeps on coming.
     McGehee and Siegel keep turning the screws and ratcheting up the suspense,
but they know as well as we do that none of it would be worth a tinker's dam
were it not for the Oscar-caliber performance of Tilda Swinton, who conveys
ordinariness stretched to the breaking point.  Swinton is one of the best
actresses practically nobody has ever seen, and here she grabs hold of us from
the first moment with her sharp, pale face erased of anything but fierce,
nervous resolve.  Peter Donat (seen here on stage last month in The Cherry
Orchard) is good as the doddering father-in-law, and Raymond Barry provides
muscular badness as the blackmailer's partner.  Tucker adds a gutsy low-keyed
portrayal of the troubled teenage son that avoids the pitfalls of exaggeration,
and he and Swinton create a moving chemistry from the moment when the son
finally awakens to the possibility that his mother may actually have a life and
a few secrets of her own.

Review for Ŕ la verticale de l'été (2000)
Some movies enter through the eyes and the senses, and bypass the brain.  Tran
Anh Hung's new movie is bathed in languorous heat, drenched in humidity and
rainfall, misted in cigarette smoke, steeped in the scent of green papaya. 
There are story specifics, but they're not insistent.  There is romance, and
there are romantic crises, but they are not resolved and nobody seems to care. 
The center of the world of this movie is three sisters living in contemporary
Hanoi.  The youngest, Lien (played by the director's beautiful wife Tran Nu
Yen-Khe, who has appeared in his features "Cyclo" and "The Scent of Green
Paqpaya") shares an apartment with her brother Hai (Ngo Quanq Hai), and seems to
entertain incestuous feelings for him, if she even knows what that means  we
later discover she is hopelessly sexually naďve.  The middle sister, Kanh (Le
Kanh), is married to aspiring writer Kien (Tran Manh Cuong), who is blocked
about 20 pages shy of the end of his first novel.  The oldest, Suong (Nguyen Nhu
Quynh), runs a café and is married to a melancholy photographer named Quoc (Chu
Hung), and both are involved in unusual romantic entanglements outside the bonds
of matrimony.  
But then these murky romantic tangles are par for the family course.  Their
mother, now deceased, had some sort of involvement at some time in her life with
a man other than her husband.  It could have been a schoolgirl crush  nobody
knows for sure, and the more they think about it, the more they think it might
be better to let sleeping lovers lie.  
The sisters have gathered together to prepare a meal for a family memorial
gathering on the anniversary of their mother's death.  The preparation of food
is visually irresistible in Tran's movies, and here it's enlivened with
speculation about the culinary methods and taste of a central part of the male
anatomy.  "In the old days, women were not allowed to touch a man's face," one
of them observes.  "It was considered too noble a part."  They giggle about the
implied lack of nobility of the part under discussion.  The scene seems to
suggest the separate continents with their separate languages that are the two
sexes, and the unbridgeable gulf between them.  "Vertical Ray" unfolds in the
time between the anniversaries of the deaths of the sisters' mother and their
father, a month later.
There's a lot of confusion of identities in this movie, and though some of it
can be ascribed to the cultural difficulty in telling people from other races
apart, some of it must be intentional.  Lien calls Hai "Big Brother" and he
calls her "Little Sister,' but there is another young man of the same age, a
prospective suitor, whom she calls "Big Brother" and who calls her "Big Sister".
 The mother's man of mystery was named Toan; Suong's lover is named Tuan.  
But none of this matters very much.  The seduction of Vertical Ray is in its
ravishing visuals (it's shot by Mark Lee Ping-bin, who shot Wong Kar-wai's In
the Mood for Love), its moods, and its moments.  Music figures strongly  the
sisters sing songs that could be translated and find a home in Appalachia, and
Lien and Hai wake up in the mornings to the sounds of Lou Reed and Velvet
Underground.  Some of the dialogue sounds stilted, but then we have to rely on
the subtitles, and at least part of the problem may lie there.  Tran is not
after plot, he's after a feeling.  "My thoughts turned back to my childhood in
DaNang," he reflects in the production notes, "remembering the time when I'd be
waiting to fall asleep at night, my mind racing from one thing to another,
nothing precise. The smell of fruit coming in through the window, a woman's
voice singing on the radio. Everything was so vague. It was like a feeling of
suspension. If I've ever experienced harmony in my life it was then. It was just
a matter of translating that rhythm and that musicality into the new film."
