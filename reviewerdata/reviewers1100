Title
Review for Manchurian Candidate, The (1962)
Continuing with the "movie list," here is number nine of the 
ten films that most shaped my life. These are not my favorite 
films. They are the movies I've seen that have had the greatest 
influence on my thinking, my character, my life. Some are 
favorites that I enjoy watching over and over again, which you 
can tell as you read each entry. Try to think of your own 
experiences with films and how they influenced the course of 
your life. It makes life more interesting to be aware, as you 
live it, to know how things such as books and films and magazine 
articles alter your path in significant ways. Sometime last year 
the Sunday NYTimes "Arts and Leisure" section had a piece on how 
difficult it is to think of a movie that may have changed 
history. The only movie they could think of was a silent film by 
D.W. Griffith, Birth of a Nation, which had a scene about the 
KuKluxKlan that the author believes changed national thinking 
about the KKK. How silly. Each of the ten films listed here 
changed my history, and if I had not seen them, I would not have 
helped change history in the ways that I have. Films don't move 
masses. They move individuals who move masses.
 9. "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962) I'd been a lefty in my 
political tastes from as far back as I could remember. In my 
first presidential vote, 1960, I cast my ballot for JFK over 
the hated Richard Nixon. In 1962, I was a reporter for the Las 
Vegas Review-Journal and had my first disillusionment with 
"liberals." At the same time, my editor, Robert L. Brown, 
persuaded me that I was being unjust in my evaluation of Nixon,
and my Ox-Bow incident experience forced me to swallow hard and 
read Nixon's Six Crises. Then, along came The Manchurian 
Candidate with Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, and Angela 
Lansbury, about how the COMMUNISTS were able to scheme in ways 
that could actually capture the American presidency. The movie 
hit me at a vulnerable moment and may have helped push me toward 
an eventual vote for Nixon in 1968. Thirty-five years later, I'm 
skeptical about genuine conspiracy theories that come from the 
left or the right, although I do appreciate their potential.

Title
Review for He Got Game (1998)
I'm afraid Spike can do comedy ten times better than evoking
sympathy or tears. It certainly wasn't better than "Hoop 
Dreams." A pity considering how much potential his story-line
had -- the father (Jake Shuttlesworth) of the nation's top 
basketball prospect is given a secret furlow from Attica, so 
he can convince his son (Jesus Shuttlesworth) to go to the 
governor's alma mater.
I don't know why Spike underplayed it. Perhaps he's not hungry 
anymore. He's got the exposure. He's got the reputation. He's 
got the undivided attention of black movie-goers. Maybe he's 
got too many "yes men" around him now. Success has a way of 
filing down a person's sharp edges. 
Not much politically correct stuff in the movie. Interestingly,
Spike scripts in more subtle affection for Italians than they 
deserve. And the Hispano-black lead in the movie -- Jesus's 
girlfriend -- has the curious name "Lala Bonita." Funny, but 
kind of slap. Kind of like naming the lone blackman in a 
movie "Nappy Hamhock." _Boricua_ is thrown all over the flick 
as I guess the Puerto Ricuenos are beginning to shape 
black/inner city culture. And one of Jesus' gangsta friends 
is a very white looking Puerto Rican. Jesus' mother looks 
whiter than Lena Horne. 
I get the sense that Spike has turned the corner on his 
racial animus, if he ever had any. I know he disapproved of 
his father's second (white) wife. And then again maybe it was 
more complex than that. After all, I remember the racial "hype"
surrounding Spike Lee and "Do the Right Thing" and rap groups 
such as Public Enemy. 
Maybe I should have been suspicious when this film got a 
white-media 3+ stars. Traditionally, they used to show up on 
my TV screen to protest some of his best work -- "School Daze,"
"Do the Right Thing," "Jungle Fever" -- thereby elevating those
films to "must see" status. Hey, any black man causing 
consternation among the whitefolk, while producing good 
entertainment and yielding provocative racial dialogue is a 
"must see" in my book. Yet, there was nothing even redeemingly
risky in this venture.
The movie's failure all made sense to me by about 30 minutes
into the overdone Nike Ad. Think about the promo, all the 
cameos and the Public Enemy soundtrack, I understand what 
Spike Lee is into now -- making money off the presentation 
rather than the substance. His film had a quintessentially 
American/multi-cultural sheen to it, but jazz always seems to 
sneak into his movies. And whereas I've almost always found 
his movies having something in them for everybody, this 
effort fell short. Simply, it tried too hard.
I bet Spike hoped this film would end up being a "cross-over" 
bonanza. Yet, all it signalled to me is that he ready to 
"sell-out." Way too much Aaron Copeland in the soundtrack. 
Way too many slow-pans over meaningless pastoral settings. 
One wheat-field shot is too much! All the P.E. tracks used 
classic-rock riffs as the back-beat. The first scene, in fact, 
had a farm boy with corn-colored hair shooting a basketball. 
C'mon! Basketball might be American, but really, any more 
genuflecting to the whitefolk in a sport mostly dominated 
blacks is just a few steps above pan-handling.
As for the drama, Spike left all the dramatic material wrapped
up in its unopened box. Jesus remains the same as when he 
began, his father, virtually unchanged -- save his 70s 'fro 
that the furlow produces. Other characters remain the cardboard
cut-outs they are introduced as. I know Spike's been criticized
of this before -- no character development -- but at least in 
his earlier works, he used these cartoons for comic effect and 
some important social commentary. 
Perhaps there's a lesson drawn from his film and its artistic 
failure. In one scene, when an Italian agent tries to court 
Jake's son into jumping right into the NBA, Jesus says he's 
going to pick a "brother" as an agent. The agent quickly pulls 
out a wad of greenbacks and says something like "I'm white, 
you're black and the only thing that matters is green...this is
green." Well, now I know what Spike's grabbing for and you 
better believe it ain't the soul.

Title
Review for Rhapsody in Blue (1945)
Memo To: Website browsers, fans & clients
Author: Jude Wanniski   http://www.polyconomics.com
Re: #10 "Rhapsody in Blue"
These are not my favorite films They are the movies I've seen that
have had the greatest influence on my thinking, my character, my
life. Some are favorites that I enjoy watching over and over again,
which you can tell by reading on. Try and think of your own
experiences with films and how they influenced the course of your
life. It makes life more interesting to be aware, as you live it, to
know how things like books and films and magazine articles alter your

move masses. They move individuals who move masses.
10. "Rhapsody in Blue" (1945) My mother also took me to see this film
at the Boro Park Theatre, when I was nine. Robert Alda plays George
Gershwin and Oscar Levant (of American in Paris) plays himself. I only
saw this film once, but it was enough. I fell in love with the music
and also with the story of George Gershwin. When I was a few years
older, I asked for Rhapsody in Blue for Christmas, and my father by
mistake bought me Gershwin's Concerto in F for piano and
orchestra. After I sulked over the mistake for several weeks, the
music propelled me toward a deep love of classical music that has
never ended. I also attribute to the movie an awareness of how young
Gershwin was when he died, in full flower. For the next 20 years, I
carried around a secret belief that I would die of a brain tumor at
age 36, like Gershwin. This encouraged me to work as hard as I could
to make my contribution before my number came up. I got into the
habit.

6. "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940) I was only four when this Henry 
Fonda flick hit the silver screen, and I rather doubt I saw it 
then, but did see it the first of many times before I was 10. 
Fonda was my maternal grandmother's favorite actor, not least 
because he almost always played a fellow who tried to help the 
poor folks and bravely confronted social injustice. (Note he 
also stars in Movie #1 on my list, "The Ox-Bow Incident."  
"Grapes of Wrath" is a Great Depression story, about 
down-and-out Okies leaving the dustbowl in search of the 
land-of-milk-and-honey in California in a rickety truck. They 
encounter ups and downs along the way and find the going rough 
even when they get to California. The scene that hit me hardest, 
as a little kid, takes place in a highway diner where they stop 
to buy half a loaf of bread, as I recall. One of the little 
Okie kids asks a waitress for a penny candy, because that's all 
he has. She looks at the ragamuffin and sells him a candy, while 
two husky truckdrivers look on waiting to pay their bill. They 
tip her a dollar, with one telling the waitress that he knows 
the candy she gave the kid cost a nickel. As the men walk out, 
she shakes her head and smiles: "Truckdrivers!" From that 
moment,it's a film moment that still occasionally inspires me to 
sudden impulses of generosity and a definite bias toward the 
Teamsters Union.

8. "Fantasia" (1940) The first movie I ever saw was a "Buck 
Jones" western, at the "OperaHouse" on Sunbury Street in 
Minersville, Pa., where I was born four years earlier. The 
second film I remember was a Nelson Eddy, Jeannette McDonald 
warbler, New Moon, also 1940, at the Hollywood Theater in 
Pottsville, a few miles away. My parents took me to see Fantasia 
about the same time, but I recall it was at the other Pottsville 
Theater, the Capitol. What an amazing movie, with cartoons set 
to classical music! It was my introduction to Beethoven's Sixth
Symphony, Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, Bach's Tacotta and Fugue
and Mickey Mouse as The Sorcerer's Apprentice. I've watched it 
countless times over the years and believe it was part of the 
foundation of my love of classical music. You can get it on 
videotape, but if it shows up on a big screen, take your kids.

Re: #5 Laura

5. "Laura" (1944) I was only eight when I first saw this 
mystery/romance, but that was enough to make me a life-long fan. 
It featured Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews and Clifton Webb and 
Vincent Price and Judith Anderson. It isn't the mystery that 
shook me up, but the romance. Gene Tierney is on my all-time 
list of gorgeous movie ladies, a very classy lady. I, of course, 
identified with Dana Andrews, who plays a detective who probably 
came from a working class family much like mine. While the high 
society types are sipping their wine and chewing on canapes, 
Andrews is playing with a handheld pinball game while he 
investigates "Laura's" murder. What knocked me out was that he 
winds up getting the classy lady once he finds out she has not 
been murdered after all. Impossible dreams can come true and in 
Laura there are two in combination. Throughout this era, there 
were hundreds of movies where the shopgirl winds up with the 
wordly man of means. This one was for me, the son of a 
coalminer. The theme song can still make me dreamy about Genie.

Review for Big Country, The (1958)

Re: #4 The Big Country

ten films that most shaped my life. These are not my favorite

influence on my thinking, my character, my life. Some are

4. "The Big Country" (1958) Another picture that I can watch at 
least once a year, never tiring of its strong men and beautiful 
women of the old west against gorgeous scenery and magnificent 
music. Gregory Peck and Charlton Heston are protagonists, with 
Chuck Conners thrown in for added manly tension. At another 
level there is the conflict between two older men, Burl Ives 
and Charles Bickford, ranchers who fight over the water of the 
Big Muddy. Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker are the beauties. Some
 critics saw this superb western as a metaphor for the Cold War,
 with Ives representing the proles, Bickford the capitalists. 
You can bear this in the back of your mind, although I didn't 
see it at first. The scene that most affected me, telling me it 
was okay to be a leader even if no one would follow, was 
Bickford riding into Blanco Canyon alone, when none of his men 
would follow him to what seemed certain death. Charlton Heston 
finally said "what the hell," and the rest came along too. It 
sounds like a man's movie, but it plays to all genders and ages.

3. "An American in Paris." (1951) There is no motion picture 
I've watched more than this MGM classic musical, easily a 
hundred times without exaggeration. Gene Kelly and Leslie 
Caron in a love story that made me dizzy when I first saw it 
in raging adolescence (15). The music is George Gershwin, my 
entry point to classical music. If I had to have one movie on a
 desert island, this would be it. It is flawless. There is no 
scene in it that is less than the others, no number I can 
decide is my favorite of all. Oscar Levant is priceless in a 
supporting role. George Guetary's "I'll Build a Stairway to 
Paradise," stoked my raging adolescence with every step. Gene 
Kelly plays a GI who stayed in Paris after the war to learn how
 to paint. When he sees Leslie Caron in a smoky nightclub, he is
 hit by the old lightning bolt, and pursues her until the 
movie's glorious finish. When she asks why, if he says he is 
such a great artist, he is not famous, he asks her to be 
patient. "Civilization," he says, "has a natural resistance to 
improving itself." In the years that followed, whenever I've 
been discouraged about my progress in moving the world in the 
direction I wish it to go, I think of that line and why it must
 be so.

7. "A Night at the Opera" (1935) This Marx Brothers picture was 
made the year before I was born, but I discovered it via my 
Uncle Vince, my mother's younger brother, the same fellow who 
introduced me to baseball, chess, classical music and a lot to 
do with politics. He was a left-winger who never quite forgave 
me for becoming a Republican. In my teenage years, the humor of
the Marx Brothers absolutely convulsed me. I could not get 
enough of it after seeing this first of several the boys 
produced. My closest friend, Leslie Nathanson, and I would get 
the NYTimes to see where in the city a theater was playing a 
Marx Brothers film. I remember trekking from Borough Park in 
Brooklyn to 96th Street in Manhattan one Saturday, and literally 
rolling in the aisle with laughter. I've seen all the films a 
dozen times, but the "Night at the Opera" -- with Harpo suddenly 
selling peanuts and popcorn down the aisle of the Met, while the 
orchestra broke out into "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" -- was 
the craziest of all. Bob Bartley, editor of The Wall Street 
Journal, once told me I had taught him "the art of the 
outrageous" in presenting editorials traditionally written with
lofty pomposity. It was Groucho, Chico and Harpo who taught me.

Review for Rashomon (1950)
Number Two of Ten Movies That Shook Wanniski
Memo To: Website browsers, fans & clients
Author: Jude Wanniski ">http://www.polyconomics.com>
Re: Ten movies that helped shape my life: #2
"Rashomon." (1950) There are several foreign films I saw as a 
boy that made me think of how different people were in other 
parts of the world. Rashomon, from the Japanese director Akira 
Kurosawa, was about the universality of human nature  --  the 
elusiveness of truth everywhere in the world. There are four 
people involved in an event that occurs in the middle of a 
forest in 16th century Japan. There is a nobleman, his beautiful
 consort, a bandit, and a bystander. There is conflict, a sexual
 episode between the woman and the bandit, and a murder. The 
heart of the film consists of the same event played out four 
different ways, according to the recollections of the four 
participants. This troubling film taught me that there is no 
such thing as objective fact or pure objectivity and built upon
 the lesson of The Ox-Bow Incident. It made it easy for me to 
see how Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill told the truth, although 
their stories were 180 degrees apart. It also enabled me to 
appreciate the conflicting stories of President Clinton and 
Kathleen Willey. People sometimes remember what was in their 
mind at the time of a stressful situation because it really was 
in their mind.

1. "The Ox-Bow Incident." (1943) This is the movie that most 
changed my life, instilling in me a fear of injustice that is 
produced by  lynch mobs. That came to be one of my distinguishing
 political characteristics. As you will notice I am attracted to 
the defense of those who nobody else will defend. My mother took 
me to see this when I was seven years old and I even remember 
sitting near the rear of the Borough Park Theater in Brooklyn, 
N.Y. Henry Fonda is part of a posse chasing men who killed a 
rancher in the course of stealing some of his cattle. The thieve
s, including Dana Andrews,  Anthony Quinn and an old man, insist 
they did nothing wrong, but after a quick tree-stump trial in 
the woods, they are pronounced guilty -- with Henry Fonda voting 
"not guilty" -- and hung. On the way back to town, the posse 
meets a man who tells them the rancher was not killed at all, 
but was alive and well. The men who had been hung were innocent
after all. I cried bitterly, not only in the theater, but for 
many nights thereafter. For years it came back to me in dreams.
I can't watch it when it shows up on late-night television. I hate
 lynch mobs.
