Title
Review for Avengers, The (1998)
We saw this movie on a pre-release screening at the Open Air Cinema
Cinelac in Geneva in the original version with french and german
subtitles.
For any who might not know, the movie builds on a rather succesful 
British TV series of the 60's. While I have a few fond memories of 
watching the series years later on German TV, I do not remember it
well enough to state how close the movie is to the tone and style of
the original series.
All in all we enjoyed the movie quite a bit, laughing often at some
of the purposely over-the-top scenes and dialogue. Thinking too much
about the movie later is prone to lead to some disappointment though
as you realize the many possibilities to improve it.
I've read several bad reviews in the press and tend to think that they
are caused by overly high expectations. With its stellar cast, The Avengers
*could* have become a very good movie, but it isn't. On the other hand
in my book it is still a fair movie, quite up to par in enjoyment value
with many of the action flics one sees as mind candy from time to time.
Overall rating: +1 (Mark Leeper scale) for enjoyment, 0+ all in all.
