Review for Pi (1998)
YO BOB GOES TO THE MOVIES
This weekŐs question: What are the limits of knowledge, and why?
ItŐs been said that knowing the nature of your fear reduces its power.  
Conversely, then, the less you understand about what frightens you, the more 
frightened you are.  And accordingly, if what youŐre trying to do is frighten 
someone, you should reveal as little information as possible.
Hitchcock knew this when he made _Psycho_, but he blew it in the last two 
minutes of the film by allowing the psychiatrist to explain Mother BatesŐ 
motivations.  Spielberg knew it when he made _Jaws_, but donŐt tell me there 
wasnŐt a letdown after the shark finally appeared.  
These two master directors understood the mechanics of fear, but they were 
operating within the classic, Aristotelian parameters of a story: beginning, 
middle, end.  Frighten the audience out of their wits, yes, but donŐt send them 
home without a resolution.
Now, however, in a popular culture that is increasingly hyperkinetic, jaded, 
self-referential, fragmented, paranoid and cynical, it is not only possible but 
advisable to dispense with the old model of entertainment.  Why bother with a 
resolution when your audience wonŐt stop flipping channels?
No one understands this better than Chris Carter, the man behind TVŐs hugely 
popular and widely imitated ŇThe X-FilesÓ.  Ask even the most hardcore fans of 
the show what itŐs all about or where itŐs going, and youŐll get an evasive 
answer at best.  The series has been humming along for years now, and while 
Mulder and Scully continue to discover tantalizing bits of information that 
_appear_ to build upon each other, they are really no closer to the truth than 
when they began.  Obviously, if they did arrive at any sort of conclusion, the 
show would lose its power to fascinate.  
So the conspiracy continues, and whether weŐre chasing or being chased, itŐs 
always just around the corner, always a fleeting shadow.
Enter Darren AronofskyŐs _¸_, a thoroughly postmodern thriller in which nothing 
is resolved but much is suggested.
Max Cohen is a sociophobic recluse obsessed with the meaning of numbers.  We 
learn that he is a mathematical prodigy who graduated college at age 14 and is 
able to multiply and divide large numbers in his head.  He lives alone in a 
triple-bolted apartment with his computer, Euclid, where he searches for 
patterns in the complex math of everyday life: leaves on a tree, the spiral of a 
seashell, the flow of the stock market.  Periodically, he suffers from splitting 
headaches that he fights with handfuls of pills; the headaches stem from an 
incident in his childhood when he stared into the sun and went temporarily 
blind.
_¸_ is the story (if story is the right word) of MaxŐs pursuit of a mysterious 
216-digit number that everyone wants him to identify.  It would be unfair to say 
what the number represents, but even if I did, it wouldnŐt really explain 
anything--just as the number itself, when it is finally discovered, is only a 
string of digits.  What matters, what keeps the audience fascinated, is the 
pursuit--or as Max says, Ňthe spaces between the numbers.Ó
The film is shot in black and white, establishing a mood of claustrophobic 
surrealism reminiscent of David LynchŐs _Eraserhead_.  Sometimes images are 
sharply defined (a smashed mirror, a power drill, MaxŐs face in close-up) and 
sometimes edges bleed into each other (the dark beards of Hasidic Jews, the 
stark white columns in a subway).  
As in a dream, we get the feeling sometimes that weŐve been here before, we even 
know whatŐs about to happen, but thereŐs nothing we can do to stop it.  And 
because the movie was made in the late Ő90s, we are subjected to some graphic, 
disturbing imagery that would have been neither possible nor appropriate in 
HitchcockŐs day.  But if youŐve watched ŇThe X-FilesÓ or seen _ThereŐs Something 
About Mary_, youŐre probably more prepared than your parents would be for the 
sight of a human brain being poked with a pencil.
Nevertheless, there are plenty who will walk out of _¸_ feeling disgusted and 
frustrated, asking themselves: Why, why, _why_ was this necessary?  Why the 
graphic violence, why the self-destructive vibe, why the endless search for the 
unattainable?  And there will be those who leave the movie despairing for the 
nihilistic glory of Generation X.
I canŐt answer the ŇwhyÓ questions; ask Aronofsky.  The most I can say is that 
while I understand the disgust and frustration, I also understand what it is to 
grow up in a time when the concept of resolution, of answerable questions, is 
itself suspect.  The byword of our times is Ňinformation,Ó the byphrase is Ňtoo 
much information,Ó and I applaud _¸_ for having the courage to consider the 
limits of knowledge.

Review for Blade (1998)
YO BOB GOES TO THE MOVIES
This weekŐs question: how is it possible for a film to be both
tongue-in-cheek _and_ completely devoid of irony?
I didnŐt mean to see _Blade_.  IŐd heard the basic
elements--Wesley Snipes, vampires--and wasnŐt especially intrigued.
Snipes hasnŐt been particularly watchable since _Jungle Fever_
(okay, it took chutzpah to do _To Wong Foo..._, but any connoisseur of
drag queen road movies will tell you what an inferior product that
was), and I doubted another superhero flick would reverse the downhill
trend.  Earlier that day IŐd finally gotten around to watching
Robert AltmanŐs great film _Short Cuts_ on video, and when my
friends Josh and Paul suggested going to see _54_, it sounded like a
suitable follow-up.  At the theater, unfortunately, we discovered that
_54_ wasnŐt starting until the next day.  Wesley won out over Drew
Barrymore and _Air Bud 2_.
_Blade_ is the polar opposite of _Short Cuts_.  The latter is an
intelligent, original film, hilarious and sad and subtle, one of
AltmanŐs clear triumphs.  It is also rife with irony.  _Blade_
shares none of these qualities, except perhaps hilarity.  I did laugh,
but IŐm still not sure how much of that was intended by the
filmmakers.
Two of the two-and-a-half stars I give this movie belong to the first
five minutes of screentime, a knockout opening sequence that ranks
with the best filmed imagery of vampires IŐve ever seen.  Two of
the two-and-a-half stars I _didnŐt_ give were out of pique at the
movieŐs failure to live up to its promise.  It just isnŐt fair
for a sequence that strong to give way to such an unrelenting
schlockfest.
It must be said that none of the principal actors are onscreen in the
first five minutes.  Night in the city: a girl leads a guy through a
meat locker into an underground techno club that turns out to be
chock-full of raving bloodsuckers.  They turn on him.  I was surprised
to feel real fear when it happened--surprised because, like most good
consumers of pop culture, IŐve been saturated with vampire
clichs courtesy of Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman (note: CoppolaŐs
_Dracula_ remains the worst of the genre) and Sarah Michelle Gellar.
ItŐs rare these days that a horror film possesses the ability,
nevermind the courage, to actually horrify.  But _Blade_ does, for a
few titillating moments.
And then, dammit, Wesley Snipes shows up lookinŐ all chocolate
cheesecake, wearing complicated latex and wielding a sword that turns
vampires into sizzling yellow skeletons.  HeŐs Blade, heŐs one
bad mother (shutcho mouth!) and no one understands him but Whistler, a
shaggy, squinty-eyed redneck played by Kris Kristofferson.  Together
they battle the undead establishment with garlic-filled silver bullets
and UV flashlights.  When an attractive doctor gets bitten, Blade
takes her to their bunker and injects her with liquid garlic to save
her, because, well, sheŐs an attractive doctor.  Not that he has
time for so much as a peck on the cheek between slaughtering his
mortal enemies.
In other words, _Blade_ becomes another superhero flick, a crashing,
blaring assault designed for maximum appeal to its target demographic.
No MTV-approved trend is left unfondled.  The music is cold
electronica, the violence is close-up gore, and every opportunity to
substitute cheesy computer graphics for live action is exploited.
While no one actually has sex, the movieŐs approach to the concept
of evil is positively pornographic: that is to say, blunt, obvious,
manipulative and shallow.
So much about _Blade_ is ridiculously contrived that _The Shadow_
seems Altmanesque in comparison.  Why is the librarian vampire an
enormous, Hutt-like slug creature?  How does the attractive doctor
survive being tossed from one skyscraper to the roof of another,
several stories below, with nary a scratch?  Why does the serum...
Okay, nevermind.  ItŐs supposed to be over-the-top fun, not a
homework assignment.  And it doesnŐt take extraordinary
intelligence to see that a lot of _Blade_ is played for laughs, not
chills.  But interspersed with moments of ghoulish humor (especially a
scene where the doctor is confronted by the shambling, rotting zombie
of her ex-boyfriend, who groans ŇDo you ever think about getting
back together?Ó) are scenes too gruesome to snicker at, too stupid
to take seriously.  I would have swallowed this nonsense as simple
lowbrow comedy if I hadnŐt caught Snipes and Stephen Dorff (a fine
actor, here slumming as the arch-vamp) trying to squeeze actual
emotion from the rubber duckies of their roles.  This movie has no
clue where to go, and further insults us by spreading its legs for a
sequel.  If _Blade II_ ever sees production, pray for us all.
You want a good vampire movie?  See _Near Dark_ or _The Addiction_. 
You want a supernatural comedy that works?  Watch _Ghostbusters_ or
_Army of Darkness_ again.
Just donŐt subject yourself to this miserable exercise in hara-kiri.
