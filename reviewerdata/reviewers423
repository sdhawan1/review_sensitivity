Title
Review for Critters (1986)
In the wake of "Gremlins" and its myriad rip-offs came this very funny horror 
comedy, for a lack of a better description. It is quick (at a full-throttle 
86 minutes), clever, self-parodic, and just plain delightful from first frame 
to last. 
The story begins in outer space on some floating prison ship, housing 
fugitives known simply as the Cripes, who are to be transported to some 
asteroid. The Cripes somehow escape on the ship and head for Earth (aliens 
just love our home planet), while two bounty hunters dressed in almost 
Western garb, a combination of long trenchcoats and pointed boots, search for 
them. They also have to change their nondescript appearances to human form. 
Flash forward to the typical American farmlands of Kansas where a nice 
American family live, consisting of the farmer, Jay Brown (Billy Green Bush), 
his housecleaning wife, Helen (Dee Wallace Stone), the presumptious son, Brad 
(Scott Grimes) who loves using his slingshot, and the sister he constantly 
fights with, April (Nadine Van Der Velde), who has the hots for the local 
handsome teen male, played by none other than Billy Zane!  
The town is full of the usual cast of denizens, including the local sheriff 
(the terrific M. Emmet Walsh) and the village idiot (Don Opper), who believes 
aliens will invade Earth (he of course was once attacked by an alien). But an 
invasion is imminent as a spaceship lands in the farmlands, and a host of 
furballs start killing livestock, and basically they try to eat their way 
through dear old Kansas. They are of course the Cripes, a crew of furball 
monsters that have razor sharp teeth and use sleep-inducing (or perhaps 
poisonous) darts that shoot from their heads.  They attack the farmer's 
family, and most of the town itself. Naturally, the bounty hunters finally 
land on Earth and cause their own havoc with their enormous guns blasting 
everything in sight (including churches and bowling alleys) as they search 
for the Cripes.
"Critters" is lots of fun, inducing more laughs than scares but of course, 
this is no serious horror flick. In a comical scene, Brad spots a silhouette 
of a Critter growing to mammoth proportions. I also like how one of the 
Critters utters the F curse, or how one plucks the eyes off of an E.T. doll. 
The scenes at the beginning are the best as we see how this oblivious 
American family lives. I love the moment where Dee Wallace smiles in 
recognition as her daughter speaks to her boyfriend, which leads to a dinner 
scene with the family and the boyfriend. As the sweet couple leaves for 
literally a romp in the hay, the patriarch Jay asks his wife: "Have you ever 
told April about...you know?" She responds: "Years ago." Moments like that, 
and there are several featuring the sly Grimes, gives a sense of humanity to 
the characters. They are not cartoonish types, though the movie is one big 
cartoon spectacle. 
It also helps that veteran character actor M. Emmet Walsh (the slimy, corrupt 
detective in "Blood Simple") and Don Opper (memorable as the title character 
in "Android") were cast, lending plenty of humorous asides throughout. 
"Critters" is a guilty pleasure, but full of smiles and knowing references to 
the B-movies of the past. It would make a great double-feature with "Mars 
Attacks!"

Title
Review for Almost Famous (2000)
Cameron Crowe is the Stanley Kubrick of rock n' roll cinema. Here is a man who takes his time to develop his stories before unveiling them to the public. Consider "Say Anything" in 1989, followed by "Singles" (his best film) in 1992, to the classic Tom Cruise comedy-drama "Jerry Maguire" in 1996. Four years later, Crowe has created his most personal film by far, and certainly one of his most insightful. "Almost Famous" is an autobiographical look at an ambitious reporter who loves rock n' roll music, and decides to interview a reluctant band. The only catch is that the reporter is 15 years old!
Newcomer Patrick Fugit plays overachiever William Miller (based on Crowe's own days as a teen reporter), who lands an unusual assigment - Rolling Stone has asked him to cover a story on the up-and-coming fictional band Stillwater. Apparently, Rolling Stone is astounded by his in-depth story of the band in the magazine "Creem." Low and behold, the youthful, naive William now travels with Stillwater, on the road across the United States. He stays in hotels, loses his virginity to a few groupies, develops a crush on Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), a groupie who is in love with the band's lead guitarist, Russell (Billy Crudup), and in short soaks up their grungy atmosphere while trying to record their thoughts on fame and their band's future on tape. As Penny grows charmed by the young man, she lets him know that he is "too sweet for rock n' roll." And so he is, to the point where William is continuously called by his overprotective mother, a college professor (Frances McDormand), who w!
!
arns him "Don't do drugs." 
There are many people that dominate William's life. The most significant is Russell, whom he develops a strong friendship with based on mutual respect. Penny is an even stronger friend who helps to get William laid, but she is so obsessed over her relationship with Russell that she forgets he may not love her. There is also the "uncool" rock journalist Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who warns William that rock music's genesis, the need to lose control, is losing its potency and to be wary of rock musicians who will only use him to get a nice cover story. The last thing a band needs is negative press. 
"Almost Famous" floats by on Patrick Fugit's charm and elfish eyes - he has the sympathetic ooze and trustworthiness of Tobey Maguire. He is so enamored by this band that he is willing to take risks along with them. This also means that William has to abandon his school career and pending graduation. But who cares when you have sex, drugs and rock n' roll! Fugit is so damn lovable and likable that it is impossible to hate the film for having such a warm, fuzzy character at its center. 
Also worth mentioning is the up-and-coming actor Billy Crudup ("Jesus's Son") who shows a tempermental nature in Russell, particularly at a party where he does acid and begins to badger the kid.  Russell is also changed by William, and realizes his mistakes in his affairs. Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn's daughter, is also quite good as the emotionally fraught Penny, affected by William's puppy-dog eyes and sweetness - her near-overdose scene is also effective as William tries to get help and admits his love for her. Philip Seymour Hoffman is delightfully witty and on-target as Lester Bangs - he has the best one-liners in the film and should get a deserved Best Supporting Actor nomination. Frances McDormand offers fine support as William's mother who has a disdain for rock music on purely immoral grounds. Also memorable are Jason Lee as the group's loud lead singer who considers William the "enemy", and Fairuza Balk and Anna Paquin as groupies who are there for the music. 
I could have lived without the tumultuous scene in a plane where everyone feels the need to confess to their sins or the far too tidy final scene, and yet there is nothing in "Almost Famous" that does not work. Every scene feels honest and truthful, and Cameron Crowe's gift is in keeping the camera static and observational. He has a gift for colorful dialogue and situations, and for bringing the appropriate mix of pathos and realism from his actors. My favorite scene is when the band is on a bus tour and they sing-along to Elton John's "Tiny Dancer." A scene like that might have been laughable or contrived under lesser hands, but Crowe manages to find a family connection between the members of the band and it pays off with poignance. Maybe someone like Paul Thomas Anderson might have shown the grittier, soulless side of the 70's rock music era whereas Crowe's affection for his characters and his own tumultuous, personal connection to them does not allow for it. By refusing to !
!
be sentimental, Crowe has made o
ne of the livelier, soulful films about the 1970's that I've seen in quite a long time.

Title
Review for Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999)
It pains me to write off Jim Jarmusch's "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai" as half-baked, but it truly is. It is also a half-cooked and undernourished tale of a cold-blooded hit man with little or no sense of individuality. 
Ghost Dog is the name of the hit man (Forest Whitaker), a lone wolf in an urban wasteland who performs hits for the mob. Basically, Ghost Dog is the retainer but he carries no phone and seems to have no mailing address. His only contact in the outside world is through a pigeon carrier that sends notes back and forth to his "master." You see Ghost Dog was once saved by this mob affiliate, referred to as the master, and now he has paid him back his respect by killing people for a living. Ghost Dog also avidly reads the ways of the Samurai, figuring his sense of loyalty and his brand of violence stems from it. He couldn't be more wrong as both are tested to the limit when a hit goes awry and now the mob want to kill the elusive, enigmatic hit man. 
"Ghost Dog" tries to be a fusion of hip-hop and gangster cliches coupled with Jarmusch's own brand of poetry, mixing in the urban wasteland of the titled character with the sense of grace and freedom, as witnessed by several shots of birds above tenements. There are many scenes of beauty and grace and all are succintly photographed by Robby Muller (who also shot the beautiful black-and-white "Dead Man," also directed by Jarmusch). Jarmusch, however, is not a stickler for narrative consistency and fails to bring any inner life to the crucial character of Ghost Dog. 
How are we suppose to view this man? As played with panache and glum looks by Forest Whitaker (who also played a similar character in "Diary of a Hitman"), Ghost Dog is the classic Man With No Name character with no real background or real sense of individuality. He seems to bond with the local French ice-cream truck vendor and with a young girl who likes to read books such as "Frankenstein," but essentially, this man has no friends and no family. All he has are his nest of pigeons and his loyalty to the so-called master whom he hardly sees much of. In an ironic twist, Ghost Dog gets paid only once a year and always during the first day of autumn as part of his contract by the master. Rarely do we get a glimpse of any humanity in the character - as played by Whitaker, he is a hooded hulk bereft of emotion or purpose other than to kill. He may lack individuality and truly has erroneous views on what being a samurai is next to being a cold-blooded hit man, but coldness and detac!
!
hment seem central to the charac
ter. I simply felt nothing, not even pity, for this remorseless man. Why did he choose to lead such a life? 
The film has some virtues, such as the casting of Cliff Gorman as the second-in-command of the mob who has trouble keeping up the rent for a Chinese restaurant backroom. I also enjoyed the scenes where Whitaker bonds with the French-speaking ice-cream truck vendor whom he never understands yet reiterates exactly what the other says. The violence is strong and brief, and there is a fine moment where a drainpipe is used as an unusual method of shooting someone (a moment lifted from Godard's "A Band Apart"). I also enjoyed seeing the exhausted gangsters trying to find the hit man, going from one tenement to another and coming up empty. It is also nice to see Jarmusch leaving his main character mute for the first forty-five minutes, thus allowing us to watch a man who is coming apart at the seams through Whitaker's expressive, haunting face. Unfortunately, just when a glimmer of hope appears at the end, we are still left with the same glum Ghost Dog we started with.

Title
Review for Clockwork Orange, A (1971)
"A Clockwork Orange" has created more diverse reactions in audiences and 
critics alike than in any other Stanley Kubrick film. Even Kubrick himself 
was outraged at how the film induced copycat incidents in Great Britain, 
causing him to ban the film until his death (now it has been re-released 
since Stanley died in March of 1999). Despite how others feel about the film, 
in my estimation, this is the greatest film ever made about the nature of 
violence, and the nature of behavior and moral choice in a clockwork society. 
It is as relevant and awe-inspiring and as intellectually charged today as 
any other film since on the subject.
Alex, the punk, the Droog, remains the most ironic, complex, and sympathetic 
antihero in the history of the cinema. As played by Malcolm McDowell, he is 
vicious, murderous but also a lover of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He also 
has nude paintings in his bedroom, has masturbatory fantasies to the tune of 
Beethoven with images from the movies (and himself as Dracula). Alex loves 
his working-class parents, his boa constrictor, and supposedly goes to school 
- he seems like a delightful lad you would see in your neighborhood on an 
"azure sky of deepest summer." There is only one difference - Alex has a 
knack, a love, for sex and violence. He has a creative imagination but it is 
fueled by his violent-proned rages - he seems to take delight in killing 
people. 
At the beginning of the film, in stunning close-up, we see Alex at the Korova 
Milkbar with his fellow Droogs drinking some milk substance that can "sharpen 
you up and get you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence." Their nightly 
activities consist of beating up old winos in dark alleys, attacking people 
in their homes, driving like madmen on the roads, having sex with women they 
pick up in record stores, and it is usually all to the tune of Beethoven's 
lovely Ninth. These Droogs dress in white, have ripped-out eyeball 
ornamentations on their cuffs, and often wear masks with phallic, Pinocchio 
noses. Kubrick shows us quite a bit of violence in the first half-hour but he 
has more up his sleeve as the film continues. 
Alex is eventually caught by the police after being betrayed by his fellow 
Droogs (he is hit in the nose with a milk bottle). Once in prison, he gets 
wind of a "Ludovico technique" where a prisoner is subjected to a 
rehabilitative process that results in getting out of prison in no time at 
all. Alex wants to do good or, as he says, "one act of goodness." The prison 
chaplain (Godfrey Quigley) tells Alex that the technique has not been tested 
much and is considered dangerous. As the chaplain explains, "Goodness comes 
from within - goodness, is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be 
a man." Alex doesn't comprehend such ideas, and decides to take part in the 
technique at all costs. He gets his chance when the Minister of the Interior 
(Anthony Sharp), who is looking for criminals to participate in such a 
technique, chooses Alex whom he considers ruthless, smart, and enterprising. 
In what remains surely the most perfectly realized scenes in the film, Alex 
is strapped to a chair with clamps that keeps his eyelids pried open as he is 
forced to watch violent film footage - at first, he enjoys it but slowly he 
becomes nauseous and sickly. Alex is becoming conditioned not just against 
violence but everything else he enjoys, including Beethoven's Ninth. 
So what is Kubrick trying to say? That in a clockwork, mechanized society, we 
have no rights - we must remain aligned with what is expected? All people who 
rebel are killers? Alex does not fit into society, he is in fact a rebel, 
allowing himself to choose violence over nonviolence because that is what 
makes him tick. Removing his instinctive behavior is not human - it is the 
result of a dehumanizing society and Alex is as human, direct and joyous as 
anyone else in the film, including the victims. 
Even in today's jaded world of ubiquitous sex and violence, "A Clockwork 
Orange" is still potent stuff - as disturbing now as it was in 1971. The 
reason is threefold: we, the audience, can't help but like Alex because he is 
so charming and ruthless despite his murderous ways. We are also asked to 
identify with him because we feel he is wronged by society and by the 
higher-ups who are abusing him and using him for political ambition. And yet 
Alex is not really cured, we sense he will go back to his violent self. 
The violence is both stylized and realistic. It is shown in slow-motion, 
time-lapse motion, and sometimes "viddied with the red, red vino on tap." 
When Alex kills his victims, it is shown at a remove, a distance from which 
we become observers particularly the attack on Alex (Patrick Magee), the 
Leftist writer, and his wife (Adrienne Corri), to the tune of "Singin' in the 
Rain." When Alex is attacked by his own droogs (who ironically become 
policemen) or by other higher-ups, it is realistic and bloody, with none of 
the enjoyment of "action and performance" that Alex feels when he inflicts 
pain or kills. 
Lastly, the film suggests that Alex cannot be changed by the Ludovico 
technique - his survival instinct is violence, it is what makes him a person. 
A moral choice cannot be made, as the prison chaplain says, because you 
cannot change a person's behavior. A liberal view to be sure but a 
justifiable view nonetheless.
"A Clockwork Orange" is terrifying, scary, witty, exciting, funny, and 
exhausting. It is Kubrick's most cinematic odyssey: beautifully shot and 
choreographed with almost monochromatic tones, and occasionally bursting with 
some bright, vivid colors of red and black justaxposed with blue and white.  
Malcolm McDowell gives what may be the seminal performance of any Kubrick 
film - exuding charm, arrogance and cleverness in the face of a callow, 
youthful killer. What's disturbing and provoking even today about the film is 
that Alex wants to retain his moral right to be bad. And we can't help but 
feel he is right.

Title
Review for Frequency (2000)
Time-travel can be an exciting arena for the cinema because it defies all 
logic and pretense. After all, it does not seem feasible that we can travel 
backwards in time, but the very notion does bring up all kinds of strange 
paradoxes, as does traveling forward into the future. But then you have a 
film like "Frequency" which asks not so much to defy logic but to defy 
reason. 
Consider the premise of the film. You have a sullen cop named John Sullivan 
(Jim Caveziel) who removes an old ham radio from his closet. He plays with it 
and discovers one night that he can communicate with his father (Dennis 
Quaid). Here is the catch: John's father, a dedicated firefighter, died in a 
horrific blazing fire while in the line of duty. So it is John in 1999 having 
conversations with his dad who is alive and well in 1969! How can this be? 
Can it be the strange forms of lights in the night sky that are causing a 
break in the space-time continuum? Or, to be more radical, could it be that 
it is all in John's mind? Nevertheless, we are left with suspending logic 
temporarily since John realizes his father will die in that fire within a few 
days in 1969, just before the Mets play their first game in the World Series! 
Can John prevent his father from dying in the past? And wouldn't that rupture 
the space-time continuum? 
I am willing to suspend disbelief at the cinemas as much as everyone else, 
but there is something horribly wrong from the get-go. Though the story is 
not possible by any stretch of the imagination, in terms of just pure 
scientific reasoning, how could John be talking to his father from the past? 
Would that not be changing the future at all just based solely on that 
premise alone? And how can John only feel that the future has changed until 
his father changes the past at the approximate time that coincides with the 
time in the future? Why should that matter? And if everything can be erased 
as it is with (*SPOILER*) John's father surviving the fire, then how can John 
feel an alternate time line existing when no one else can? Just a matter of 
logic and reasoning based on the filmmaker's rules. Stephen Hawking would 
have a field day with all this. 
All paradoxes aside, the basic problem with "Frequency" is that I never 
believed the relationship between John and his father. Simply put, there is 
no chemistry between Dennis Quaid and Jim Caveziel - they do not make a 
fitting father-son combo. And frankly all the time paradoxes, and an 
implausible serial-killer plot to boot, distracts from the emotional 
connection to the story, which is simply about a father and son trying to 
communicate. Added to that is the lack of an explanation about Jim's 
girlfriend, who leaves him at the beginning, and then does not recognize him 
later after the past had been changed. A little nod to "It's A Wonderful 
Life" to be sure, but the subplot is left dangling like an unexposed wire in 
a time machine, and thus she is never seen or heard from again.
If nothing else, it is a pleasure seeing Dennis Quaid back to his clever, 
sly, cocky self - sort of a grown-up version of his character in 
"Dreamscape." He is often like a live wire, ready to explode at any moment 
(the opening sequence where he survives a fire is followed by Martha Reeves' 
"Heatwave.") "Frequency" is too just too low on the voltage meter to follow 
Quaid's live-wire act.

Title
Review for Pay It Forward (2000)
You have heard the concept before. You receive an e-mail or a letter
in the mail regarding a great new opportunity - you send one dollar to
seven addresses and they will send one dollar to seven others, and so
on. Before you know it, you will make thousands of dollars a
month. The idea forms a chain or a pyramid strategy, hence, chain
letters. The reason the idea does not work is because it feels like a
rip-off, plus whose to say that people will follow through and pay it
forward. The film "Pay it Forward" wants us to believe that people
repaying acts of kindness for kindness done upon them can work if a
kid makes them believe in the idea. But how many people are genuinely
kind enough to follow through with such a plan? Do we want to be
forced to act kindly?
Consider the opening sequence of the film set in an elementary
school. Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment), a seventh grader, listens
attentively in class as his social-studies teacher, Mr. Simonet (Kevin
Spacey), gives an extra-credit assignment for the semester. The class
is to come up with a plan of action to make the world a better place
and follow through by performing said action. Trevor devises an
original plan: one person does an act of kindness for someone and that
person will pay it forward by helping three other people. A chain
reaction is expected as numbers will grow and before you know it, the
world will be at peace again. But there are flaws with such a plan,
aren't there? Could such a chain reaction occur with no money
involved? There may be benefits if the acts are reciprocated but what
if they aren't? This movie never dares to consider that certain people
do not want to be helped or even want to act kindly.
For example, there is the homeless drug addict, Jerry (Jim Caviezel),
who is taken home by Trevor. We sense that Jerry is only interested in
his next fix, which he is, but he also claims that this kid has helped
him to see the light and get another chance at life. There is the
homeless alcoholic (Angie Dickinson), her own alcoholic daughter,
Arlene, Trevor's mother (Helen Hunt), who always keep a bottle stashed
in her washer. There is also another drug addict and a couple of
school bullies. And then there is Mr. Simonet, who has burn scars all
over his body, uses "a lot of big words" and whom Trevor tries to fix
up with his mother, Arlene. Trevor hopes to at least help his mother
and Mr. Simonet, as well as his friend who is beaten up by bullies. He
is trying to pay it forward. Suddenly, a movement is born, or so it
seems.
"Pay it Forward's" structure is all over the place, as it jumps
backwards and forwards in time. We see a reporter (Jay Mohr) at a
crime scene where his car is nearly demolished. A lawyer sees him, and
offers his Jaguar as compensation for the reporter's loss. The lawyer
is paying it forward, and thus begins the reporter's quest to discover
the origins of this movement. "Four Months Earlier" is the title
reminding us of where we are in time yet throughout the film, Jay
Mohr's character seems to occupy the same timeline as Trevor's,
particularly during the genesis of his plan.
Time shifting is not this film's problem. A bigger flaw is the lack of
time spent on this ingenious plan, its pros and cons and so on. Too
much time is devoted to the silly romance between Mr. Simonet and
Trevor's mother to the point of nausea. Helen Hunt is astoundingly
good as the trashy waitress but her alcoholic mood swings seem too
abrupt to really believe, or as abrupt as it should be. She undergoes
such a quick recovery that it hardly seems plausible she was ever an
alcoholic to begin with. Kevin Spacey is adequately restrained as the
scarred Mr. Simonet, and has all the best dialogue scenes. But hardly
much of this matters as much as Trevor's plan of action. We see
samples of it but not enough is balanced with the film's increasingly
tepid romance, not to mention the inclusion of Trevor's own father
(Jon Bon Jovi) who appears and disappears so fast that you'll forget
he ever existed. I would also have liked to have seen more of
Dickinson's character or even Caviezel's!  .
Some have called "Pay it Forward" shamelessly manipulative and overly
sentimental. Some have called it touching. I just found the Spacey and
Hunt characters real and engaging yet they are mostly saddled with
unrealistic dialogue and shameless cliches, and the rest of the
characters are mere stereotypes. The film is strangely watchable but
also devoid of real human emotion, and plus there is a tragic,
unbelievable coda that negates most of the film's two hour running
time. All in all, not terrible but too thin and cliche ridden to
recommend to anyone, let alone three people.

dialogue and shameless cliches, and the rest of the characters are mere 
stereotypes. The film is strangely watchable but also devoid of real human 
emotion, and plus there is a tragic, unbelievable coda that negates most of 
the film's two hour running time. All in all, not terrible but too thin and 
cliche ridden to recommend to anyone, let alone three people.

Title
Review for Scorpio Rising (1964)
Kenneth Anger's "Scorpio Rising" is one of the most revolutionary films of 
the past forty years. It set a whole new precedent to filmmaking in general, 
in terms of its fast cutting style, rock n' roll montages, rebellious allure 
of motorcyclists, sex, death, and so on. In fact, I may be so bold as to say 
that this is the first sex, drugs and rock n' roll movie ever made. And Anger 
did it all in less than half-an-hour of film time. 
As director Anger recently explained about his most famous (or infamous) 
short film, "Scorpio Rising" is an ironic take on "The Wild Bunch," the 
latter being a fairly tame motorcycle movie next to this one. In fact, 
"Scorpio Rising" is all about irony, and yet it says something rather 
disconcerting about the world in America before the love generation and the 
decadence of the 1970's set in. At times, "Scorpio Rising" seems to be an 
ironic take on the 1950's yet commenting on the growing motorcycle cult of 
the late 1960's. Anger even dedicated the film to the Hell's Angels. 
"Scorpio Rising" begins with average men in their late teens or early 
twenties polishing and fixing their precious bikes (or as Anger referred to 
them as "Christmas tree versions of motorcycles".) They are inside their 
garages, and we hear lovely pop songs in the background as the camera tracks 
back and forth between the bikers and their bikes, wind-up toys of 
motorbikes, and a prominent visage of a skull in the background. Later, we 
see the bikers dressing up in their uniforms, a combination of leather 
jackets and straps to the tune of Bobby Vinton's "Blue Velvet." The irony 
begins again, as the song has the lyric, "She wore blue velvet," yet we see a 
blonde biker dressing up wearing a blue shirt and a black leather jacket. As 
photographed in close-up, along with subliminal shots of a barechested biker, 
there is a definite homoerotic subtext occurring here, as there was with 
Anger's first film "Fireworks" where Anger played a 17-year-old kid who 
dreams of being sodomized and beaten by Navy officers. There is one shot in 
"Scorpio" of the barechested biker standing over a cone pointing to his 
crotch. Most of "Scorpio Rising" has sexual connotations in every shot, 
especially the Halloween party where costumed, masked guests stand around 
having sex with their genitalia clearly exposed (the version I saw had such 
moments blotted out since it was from a Japanese laserdisc). 
"Scorpio Rising" combines elements of teen rebellion, popular culture, Nazi 
ideology, the motorcycle cult, sex, rock n' roll, religion, and death and it 
twists such elements around to form a rather haunting collage about the 
inevitable decline of the western civilization as we know it. And every 
sequence has a rock and roll song or some sentimental ditty playing on the 
soundtrack. "Scorpio Rising" is the first film to ever build a montage of 
shots with songs, and to do so ironically. If you are wondering where Martin 
Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson and any 
filmmaker since, not to mention MTV, got their ideas for their famous use of 
ironic pop songs as subtext or montage, look no further back than "Scorpio 
Rising." Another ironic fact is that the film was brought up on obscenity 
charges back in 1964, yet no one noticed the use of songs in the soundtrack 
which Anger had no permission to use. Since then, the film has been tough to 
find in video stores because the rights to such songs are still in a legal 
tangle.
"Scorpio Rising" is a frenetically charged, highly potent piece of cinema and 
it is guaranteed to still provoke anger (especially the use of the swastiza 
symbol). It was a sign of things to come, long before the advent of the 
post-60's youth rebellion in films such as "The Graduate," or youth violence 
in "A Clockwork Orange." There is of course the nineties equivalent of both, 
"Natural Born Killers." It all began with Anger's film, and we can either be 
grateful or unforgiving.

Title
Review for Clockwork Orange, A (1971)
"A Clockwork Orange" has created more diverse reactions in audiences and 
critics alike than in any other Stanley Kubrick film. Even Kubrick himself 
was outraged at how the film induced copycat incidents in Great Britain, 
causing him to ban the film until his death (now it has been re-released 
since Stanley died in March of 1999). Despite how others feel about the film, 
in my estimation, this is the greatest film ever made about the nature of 
violence, and the nature of behavior and moral choice in a clockwork society. 
It is as relevant and awe-inspiring and as intellectually charged today as 
any other film since on the subject.
Alex, the punk, the Droog, remains the most ironic, complex, and sympathetic 
antihero in the history of the cinema. As played by Malcolm McDowell, he is 
vicious, murderous but also a lover of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He also 
has nude paintings in his bedroom, has masturbatory fantasies to the tune of 
Beethoven with images from the movies (and himself as Dracula). Alex loves 
his working-class parents, his boa constrictor, and supposedly goes to school 
- he seems like a delightful lad you would see in your neighborhood on an 
"azure sky of deepest summer." There is only one difference - Alex has a 
knack, a love, for sex and violence. He has a creative imagination but it is 
fueled by his violent-proned rages - he seems to take delight in killing 
people. 
At the beginning of the film, in stunning close-up, we see Alex at the Korova 
Milkbar with his fellow Droogs drinking some milk substance that can "sharpen 
you up and get you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence." Their nightly 
activities consist of beating up old winos in dark alleys, attacking people 
in their homes, driving like madmen on the roads, having sex with women they 
pick up in record stores, and it is usually all to the tune of Beethoven's 
lovely Ninth. These Droogs dress in white, have ripped-out eyeball 
ornamentations on their cuffs, and often wear masks with phallic, Pinocchio 
noses. Kubrick shows us quite a bit of violence in the first half-hour but he 
has more up his sleeve as the film continues. 
Alex is eventually caught by the police after being betrayed by his fellow 
Droogs (he is hit in the nose with a milk bottle). Once in prison, he gets 
wind of a "Ludovico technique" where a prisoner is subjected to a 
rehabilitative process that results in getting out of prison in no time at 
all. Alex wants to do good or, as he says, "one act of goodness." The prison 
chaplain (Godfrey Quigley) tells Alex that the technique has not been tested 
much and is considered dangerous. As the chaplain explains, "Goodness comes 
from within - goodness, is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be 
a man." Alex doesn't comprehend such ideas, and decides to take part in the 
technique at all costs. He gets his chance when the Minister of the Interior 
(Anthony Sharp), who is looking for criminals to participate in such a 
technique, chooses Alex whom he considers ruthless, smart, and enterprising. 
In what remains surely the most perfectly realized scenes in the film, Alex 
is strapped to a chair with clamps that keeps his eyelids pried open as he is 
forced to watch violent film footage - at first, he enjoys it but slowly he 
becomes nauseous and sickly. Alex is becoming conditioned not just against 
violence but everything else he enjoys, including Beethoven's Ninth. 
So what is Kubrick trying to say? That in a clockwork, mechanized society, we 
have no rights - we must remain aligned with what is expected? All people who 
rebel are killers? Alex does not fit into society, he is in fact a rebel, 
allowing himself to choose violence over nonviolence because that is what 
makes him tick. Removing his instinctive behavior is not human - it is the 
result of a dehumanizing society and Alex is as human, direct and joyous as 
anyone else in the film, including the victims. 
Even in today's jaded world of ubiquitous sex and violence, "A Clockwork 
Orange" is still potent stuff - as disturbing now as it was in 1971. The 
reason is threefold: we, the audience, can't help but like Alex because he is 
so charming and ruthless despite his murderous ways. We are also asked to 
identify with him because we feel he is wronged by society and by the 
higher-ups who are abusing him and using him for political ambition. And yet 
Alex is not really cured, we sense he will go back to his violent self. 
The violence is both stylized and realistic. It is shown in slow-motion, 
time-lapse motion, and sometimes "viddied with the red, red vino on tap." 
When Alex kills his victims, it is shown at a remove, a distance from which 
we become observers particularly the attack on Alex (Patrick Magee), the 
Leftist writer, and his wife (Adrienne Corri), to the tune of "Singin' in the 
Rain." When Alex is attacked by his own droogs (who ironically become 
policemen) or by other higher-ups, it is realistic and bloody, with none of 
the enjoyment of "action and performance" that Alex feels when he inflicts 
pain or kills. 
Lastly, the film suggests that Alex cannot be changed by the Ludovico 
technique - his survival instinct is violence, it is what makes him a person. 
A moral choice cannot be made, as the prison chaplain says, because you 
cannot change a person's behavior. A liberal view to be sure but a 
justifiable view nonetheless.
"A Clockwork Orange" is terrifying, scary, witty, exciting, funny, and 
exhausting. It is Kubrick's most cinematic odyssey: beautifully shot and 
choreographed with almost monochromatic tones, and occasionally bursting with 
some bright, vivid colors of red and black justaxposed with blue and white.  
Malcolm McDowell gives what may be the seminal performance of any Kubrick 
film - exuding charm, arrogance and cleverness in the face of a callow, 
youthful killer. What's disturbing and provoking even today about the film is 
that Alex wants to retain his moral right to be bad. And we can't help but 
feel he is right.

Title
Review for Scary Movie (2000)
"Scary Movie" was the original title for Wes Craven's ultra-popular "Scream". 
That is probably the best thing I can say in favor of this slapdash, 
lackadaisical spoof of the "Scream" movies and the slasher film genre in 
general. As with most spoofs, there are far too many desperate gags to 
inspire much laughter in the audience. 
Anna Frais deftly plays the Neve Campbell role (she even mimics shrinking her 
eyes as Campbell did in the original "Scream"), the virginal dimwit whose 
father is a drug runner with the Colombians. Enter the pot-smoking teen 
(Marlon Wayans), the jock superstud who has homosexual tendencies (one of the 
other Wayan brothers, I forget which), the mentally challenged (or "retarted 
retard" as he is referred to) police deputy (Dave Sheridan aping David 
Arquette), the opening "death" cameo by Carmen Electra as Drew, and so on. 
Oh, and the killer wears the same Edvard Munch mask with a glinting knife and 
hook! Most of the cast act like gaping idiots seeking attention, and none 
exude the charm or straight-as-an-arrow acting style (central to spoofs as a 
rule) of Leslie Nielsen in "The Naked Gun" or for that matter, Val Kilmer in 
the superbly hilarious "Top Secret." The trick is to play it straight, not to 
act like a total buffoon otherwise, you are letting people know you are in on 
the joke as well. 
The central problem with "Scary Movie" is that the script does not skewer the 
slasher genre as much as pop culture hits like "The Matrix" (which actually 
works), "The Blair Witch Project," "Amistad," and "The Usual Suspects." When 
it does spoof the slasher films, as in the obvious "Scream," it fails 
miserably mainly because the "Scream" movies were already poking fun at 
themselves. They were postmodernist jokes on the rules and do's and don'ts of 
the slasher film genre - how can you spoof what was essentially a spoof? This 
shows a real dearth in imagination, which as far as I am concerned, the 
Wayans (Shawn and Marlon co-wrote the screenplay) do not possess a lick of. 
"In Living Color" at least showed some talent from the Wayans brothers, as 
did the underappreciated "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka." Here genuine laughs come 
in extremely short supply (though Electra's cameo is quite good), and there 
are far too many gross-out gags, homosexual locker-room humor and exaggerated 
bodily fluid jokes that went out of style shortly after "Porky's" and its 
slew of rip-offs a decade ago. 
In its 90 minute running time, I chuckled four times and only let out one big 
laugh for "Scary Movie." It is a roller coaster ride of missed opportunities 
- where are the Zucker brothers when you need them? By comparison, "Scream 3" 
was a lot funnier.

Title
Review for Mask of Zorro, The (1998)
It is rare to see an action-adventure film that evokes memories of the action serials of yesteryear - remember The Masked Avenger or Buck Rogers? A commonplace argument is that recent action films focus more on Dolby-ized explosions and car crashes than any story or plot. "The Mask of Zorro" is that rarity - a fast-paced, rollicking action film that brings back the snap and vigor of Zorro in all its glory, without resorting to extreme violence or heavy explosions, and it has a reasonably decent story to tell.
During the opening sequence, we learn that Zorro, otherwise known as Don Diego de la Vega (played with panache by Anthony Hopkins) is the masked hero of the Mexican people. Some prisoners are about to be executed by a firing squad led by Governor Don Rafaelo Montero (Stuart Wilson), and the crowd bawls. Before you know it, Zorro comes out of thin air and rescues the prisoners with sword, whip, a trusty steed, and attitude. Unfortunately, he is apprehended by Montero's guards resulting in the death of his wife. 
Twenty years later, Alejandro Murieta (Antonio Banderas) is a wandering street thief who inexplicably becomes Zorro's star pupil - I say inexplicably because who would want to tutor a curly long-haired wanderer on the street, but never mind. Zorro teaches Murieta everything about swords, chivalry, matters of etiquette, conversation, and well-groomed appearances. Thus, Murieta becomes the new, dashing Zorro slicing his way through several of Montero's minions, and dancing elegantly with Montero's daughter, Elena (British-born Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is really Vega's daughter. 
"The Mask of Zorro" has plenty of stunts and action scenes, but its main thrust is an expanded backstory about Vega's past and the revenge he seeks on his wife's death. This exposition with the well-cast Hopkins shows more flair and promise than I might have anticipated, even for a hokey Hollywood production like this one. 
As for Banderas and Zeta-Jones, they do have sparkling chemistry, culminating in a romantic kiss during a sword duel. The biggest weakness is Stuart Wilson (previously a villain in "Lethal Weapon 3") as the fatuous Montero, who isn't remotely threatening or evil. Still, "The Mask of Zorro" is as escapist and fun as Hollywood has been getting lately.
