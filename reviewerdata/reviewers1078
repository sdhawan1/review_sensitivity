Title
Review for Jawbreaker (1999)
There's a scene early on in "Jawbreaker" where a character utters the
unintentionally prophetic line, "That is *so* not funny".  How right
she was.  This pathetic tale of three high-schoolers who accidentally
kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly
awry is never even remotely funny.  Or fun.
Or original.  Not content with the too-obvious "Heathers" heisting,
the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of
sources, including "Carrie", "Bride of Frankenstein", "Blue Velvet",
and even Shaw's Pygmalion, itself recently remade as "She's All That".
"Jawbreaker" is a pastiche, and not even an enjoyable one.  I find it
extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the
credit sequence, a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by
Veruca Salt's "Volcano Girls"; serving as a blueprint for the rest of
the film, the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we're
watching.  Just close your eyes and pretend you're listening to an
alt-rock station; you won't be missing anything.
The blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the
principals.  Rebecca Gayheart, following roles in "Scream 2" and
"Urban Legend", should have known better than to take yet another role
in yet another teen body count movie.  Pam Grier has totally wasted
any credibility she might have gotten from her role in Quentin
Tarantino's "Jackie Brown".  And Rose McGowan should just quit acting.
She has no charisma, no presence, and no acting skills other than
rolling her eyes and looking disaffected.  McGowan manages to be
upstaged by her real-life boyfriend, rocker Marilyn Manson, whose
fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of
the "real" actors are doing.  Manson, sans trademark makeup & contact
lenses, and with an obviously fake moustache, looks eerily like
Nicholas Cage; who woulda thunk it?
That crack about direction by committee wasn't merely a pithy
sound-bite.  Stylistically, thematically & narratively, "Jawbreaker"
is all over the map, varying wildly in tone & content from scene to
scene.  Though credited solely to writer/director Darren Stein, one
gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the
same hands.  If Stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this
atrocity, someone needs to get the man some drugs, pronto.  Prozac,
lithium, kava, ritalin, something, anything.  He's quite obviously in
desperate need of chemical help.
"Jawbreaker" is a monumental waste of effort and resources, and quite
likely one of the single worst films I've ever seen.  To call
"Jawbreaker" garbage would be to insult garbage.  Bad flicks for the
rest of the year are safe; I've already got my pick for worst film of
'99.
"Jawbreaker" runs approximately 90 minutes, though it feels longer
than "Titanic", and is rated R for language, sexual situations and
graphic violence.  Not recommended for kids, teens, or anyone else.

Title
Review for Blast from the Past (1999)
While watching "Blast from the Past", a song by trip-hop maestro
Tricky came to mind: "Brand New, You're Retro".  Things end up being
too much retro, too little new, though Blast remains an enjoyable, if
familiar, fish out of water tale.
Blast opens with a poorly-conceived credit sequence in which we see a
newspaper montage as the classic "Accentuate the Positive" plays.
It's a great song, and a great opening... except that we've seen this
before, notably in one of 1997's best films, "L.A. Confidential", and
in the sadly defunt ABC series, "Homefront".
Fortunately, things pick up from there, as we're introduced to
paranoid husband Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) and his pregnant
wife Helen (Sissy Spacek).  Heading into their state-of-the-art bomb
shelter as Kennedy lashes out against Cuba on tv, they're startled as
a fighter jet on routine manuevers has engine trouble and crashes into
their house.  Mistaking this for "the big one", Walken hurriedly slams
the locks, sealing them in for thirty-five years, the amount of time
it will take for the radiation to clear.  A few days later, their son
-- appropriately, predictably named Adam -- is born, and the movie
spends nearly a third of its time showing us vignettes from Adam's
child- and eventually adult-hood.
We finally get to the main part of the story just after Adam's
thirty-fifth birthday.  Dad has broken the seal and gone to the
surface to see how the recovery is going, and is dumbfounded at the
"mutants" he encounters:  transvestite hookers, drunken bums, and gang
bangers.  (Hookers & bums & guns, oh my!)  Safe underground again, he
decides that they should wait another ten years before attempting to
return to the surface.
But there's a problem: they're running out of supplies.  After Dad has
an attack (heart, anxiety or panic, it's never made clear), it's up to
Adam to go out for food, batteries... and perhaps a wife.  Enter Eve
(Silverstone) & Troy (Foley) as that '90's staple, the bombshell with
the gay best friend ("My Best Friend's Wedding", tv's "Will & Grace",
etc.).
What follows is fairly entertaining, though wholly predictable.  It's
never in doubt that the square Adam will turn out to be the hippest
guy on the dance floor (both in a swing club number and in the
funniest YMCA bit since "Wayne's World"), or that Adam will fall for
Eve (duh), or that Adam will ultimately find his cloistered world to
be preferable in many ways to Eve's world.  (It's like an odd role
reversal on H. G. Wells' "The Time Machine": Adam is the bright &
sunny Eloi, while most of the surface-dwellers come across as hideous,
mutated Morlocks.)
The performances are solid all-around, especially Fraser who wipes out
any doubts about his ability to carry a film.  Though obviously not up
to par with his masterful performance in "Gods & Monsters", Fraser
here demonstrates an incredible screen presence, dominating his every
scene, even when paired with veterans like Walken & Spacek.  This
won't be the film that makes him a mega-star, but it's a step in the
right direction, and bodes well for his next, "The Mummy", due out May
7th.
Blast treads some of the same ground as another New Line Cinema
project, last fall's "Pleasantville", but doesn't bother itself with
any seriousness or social commentary;  Blast is a comedy, and knows
it.
What it doesn't know is when to quit, overstaying it's welcome by
about ten minutes.  We've been entertained, and are ready for the film
to be over, and it just keeps going.  The finale draws out far too
long, though it might not have mattered had the entire film been
tightened up a bit.  Many of the scenes with young Adam aren't
necessary, and a continuing sub-plot featuring Joey Slotnick as a bar
owner turned cult leader could have been excised with virtually no
impact on the narrative.  
Also, the film isn't quite sure when it takes place.  Pointedly
starting in 1962 in the thick of the Cuban missle crisis, it then
abandons concrete dates in favor of the nebulous "The Present Day".
Fine, except that Adam later tells us that he's 35, meaning the action
takes place in 1997... which is not the present day.  A minor point,
to be sure, but this coupled with the draggy pacing suggests the need
for a more hands-on producer.  Blast ain't bad, but it could've been
far better.
"Blast from the Past" runs approximately 1:45, and is rated PG-13,
presumably for the few scenes of '90's nastiness we're exposed to.

Title
Review for October Sky (1999)
October Sky is a highly entertaining film, a mix in equal parts of
Stand By Me, Iron Will & The Right Stuff.  Based on the memoir of NASA
scientist Homer Hickam, this feel-good film tells the true story of
four West Virginia coal town boys fascinated by the October, 1957
flight of Sputnik.
Dreaming of scholarships and a life after high school not involving
decades of heavy labor in the mines, the four friends set about
learning the fledgling field of rocketry on their own.  Despite an
inauspiscious beginning (they blow up the Hickam's white picket
fence), the boys keep at it, learning a little more with each
successive failure.  In a scene highly reminescent of The Right Stuff,
we're treated to an increasingly hysterical montage of exploding
rockets.  Equally amusing is the scene in which the four raise cash to
fund their experiments, borrowing parts from a closed-off section of
railroad and selling them off as scrap metal.
All this fascination with outer space nonsense eventually leads to
trouble with Hickam's down-to-earth mine foreman father, expertly
played by Chris Cooper (perhaps best known as the sheriff in John
Sayles' Lone Star).  Hickam, Sr. is strict, but fair in his own way;
it is to Cooper's credit that this portrayal doesn't come off as the
typical one-note father who just doesn't get it.
With this father-son friction providing the dramatic tension through
the film's mid-section, the boys continue their quest for a rocket
that will work, alternately aided & hindered by sympathetic mine
workers (notably a far under-used Ilya Baskin), a strike that
threatens to shut down the entire town, a science teacher with a
problem (Dern), & accusations of starting a forest fire with one of
their wayward rockets.  Reality ultimately intrudes on their dream,
when Homer's dad is injured in a mine mishap, & Homer has to give up
both school and rocketry to support the family by working in the
mines.  Though his spirit may be down, his mind is not, ultimately
leading him to a realization that gets him out of the mine and back to
the rockets.
The events that follow -- including a trip to Indianapolis for a
national science fair -- are a bit telegraphed, but by then you're
willing to forgive the film just about any faults.  Director Joe
Johnston proves here that he doesn't need heavy FX to tell a good
story.  After the visual excesses of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, The
Rocketeer & Jumanji, this must have felt like a vacation.
It feels like one for the audience as well.  October Sky is the kind
of inspiring, triumphant film that Hollywood regrettably just doesn't
make anymore.  Kudos to Universal for seeing it through to the screen.
October Sky, based on the book Rocket Boys by Homer Hickam,
opens nationwide on February 19th.  Running time is 1:40, with a PG
rating for mild violence and language.
