Title
Review for Jerry Maguire (1996)
JERRY MAGUIRE: Why is it that in every Tom Cruise movie of late, he has
to show the entire range of his acting abilities?  Going from primal
rage to a sensitive 90's man in under 120 minutes seems to be his
specialty.  Leaving that aside, I found the movie rather disjointed.  It
had a jerky start & stop feel, instead of flowing effortlessly from one
scene to the next.
There was only one good scene which stuck in my mind: Cruise & his wife
were talking about the failure of their marriage and how his weekly
trips have become a "welcome break" from the daily drudgery of polite
conversations which epitomized their relationship.
The worse scene in the movie was when he came back to her, ready to pour
out his heart in front of the bitter old maids club.  Instead, he
rambles on about nothing, and just as he was about to continue, his
teary eyed wife says: "Shut up, you had me from the word Hello."  WHAT
THE %&*@ IS GOING ON HERE????!!!!!  This is completely inconsistent with
her character.  She's been blaming him for lack of intimacy, but just as
he was ready to spill the beans, she effectively says "Nevermind."
There were also numerous annoying & cliched "Hollywood" touches which I
won't bother going into.

Review for Scream (1996)
SCREAM:  This movie bored the pants off of me.  All the self
reflecting winks at the genre just served to pull me out of the realm of
movie magic, instead of drawing me in.  There were no character
development to speak of.  Then again, I shouldn't be surprised, after
all there were no interesting characters at all!  To top it off, it
wasn't the least bit scary.
I wanted to fast forward to the end to find out if the whole thing had
been a movie within a movie, involving a screenwriter's dream sequence
brought about by a case of indigestion.  No luck, I should've followed
my gut and walked out.
