Review for Mighty, The (1998)
THE MIGHTY ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers, wchamber@netcom.ca
(Like movies? Me too.
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/
Movie trivia, notes, reviews, DVD stuff, blah, blah, blah)
starring Elden Henson, Kieran Culkin, Sharon Stone, Gillian Anderson
screenplay by Charles Leavitt, based on the novel "Freak The Mighty" by
Rodman Philbrick
directed by Peter Chelsom
THE MIGHTY is about a friendship between two boy outcasts. The latter
suffers from Morquiro Syndrome, a
disease that stunts growth and can affect other parts of the body, such
as the ears, eyes, muscles, etc. Modern
medicine has extended the lifespan of a Morquiro victim to about sixty
years. Fortunately, science progresses much
faster than Hollywood, which probably explains why Ian Michael Smith, an
eleven-year-old brainiac enduring
Morquiro in real-life, was turned down for the role of "Freak The
Mighty" in favour of the more handsome Culkin.
(Of course, months later, Smith landed the part of Simon Birch in the
film of the same name, ironically a character
not explicitly afflicted with Morquiro Syndrome--Simon is a dwarf.*)
Max Kane (Henson) is a friendless, illiterate, overweight adolescent
living in his grandparents' basement (his
father is in prison, his mother dead). Then "Freak", aka Kevin, moves in
next door (Culkin) and turns Max's world
upside-down. As Max explains in voice-over, "Freak was the brain, and I
was the legs." They become one person,
in a sense, with Freak planted atop Max's ample shoulders; as a
makeshift giant, they take on all kinds of bullies,
instilled with a code of honour they picked up from a joint fascination
with medieval legends. All does not remain
rosy for this gruesome twosome, however, as the ghosts that haunt them
inch closer and closer. (Max is afraid of
his violent father's release/escape; Freak is, essentially, running away
from the grim reaper himself.)
With his moussed-hair and big glasses, Culkin as Freak looks like a
hunchbacked, teenaged vision of the kid from
Jerry Maguire. There are a few feeble attempts to make him look smaller
than he obviously is-high angle shots
and the like. Culkin's performance is less credible than his appearance
(ultimately, he looks more lazy than
handicapped): it's difficult to empathize with a character this cocksure
and smarmy. Particularly in THE MIGHTY's
early scenes, Culkin is possessed of an arrogance that had me cheering
for the (downright phony, zero-dimensional)
sadistic school thugs who knock him off his crutches. I'm not sure it's
the screenplay's fault, either-some may
argue Freak overcompensates in attitude because of his physical defects,
but this brand of smugness seems to run
in Kieran's family.
Speaking of overcompensating, Gillian Anderson-playing the
fright-wigged, white-trash, vaguely Southern wife of
Iggy (Meat Loaf (!))-gives the most embarrassing supporting performance
of the year in THE MIGHTY. She sooo
doesn't want to remind you of her X-file alter-ego Dana Scully-"I have
range, damn it!"-that she acts instead
like a man in drag doing Gloria Swanson doing Blanche Dubois of "A
Streetcar Named Desire." The film is barely
watchable when she's on screen. Sharon Stone, as Freak's quiet mother,
fares much, much better than Anderson,
though we never learn anything about her except that she loves her son
to pieces. (She also has the best hairdo in
town, say I.)
There is ONE reason to see THE MIGHTY, and its name is Elden Henson. He
is a newcomer to the big screen, and
I hope we see more of him, though I suspect this is the only lead he'll
play for quite some time. (Ignore the film's
order of credits-Henson is the star.) Hollywood, you see, is almost as
intolerant of heavy people as it is the
disabled (except on sitcoms and talk shows, where big women named Rosie
and Roseanne rule.) Max is so
believably naive that I'll cop to feeling a lump in my throat towards
the end of the picture; his purity of emotion is a
sad and poignant sight to behold. Henson shines through all the
unnecessary knight imagery, questionable plot
devices (a toboggan ride sequence is all-too-reminiscent of Home Alone's
slapstick), and story holes (the bullies
eventually disappear because...well, they just do). He even sweetly
sells the voice-over.
I realize THE MIGHTY might have been made for the "Choose Your Own
Adventure" crowd, in which case I could
conceivably forgive some of its more blatant characterizations. It will
no doubt encourage some kids to pick up a
pen and start writing stories (after all, the whole film is essentially
a storybook of Max's creation come to life),
which is always a good thing. Yet whatever the target audience, very
little of it works.
*Notice how both The Mighty poster and Simon Birch's newspaper campaign
showcase their disabled characters in
silhouette.

Title
Review for High Fidelity (2000)
starring John Cusack, Jack Black, Lisa Bonet, Iben Hjejle
screenplay by D.V. Devincentis & Steve Pink & John Cusack and Scott
Rosenberg,
based on the novel by Nick Hornby
directed by Stephen Frears
Top five things thus far written about the film High Fidelity by critics
other than myself: 1. "The movie looks like it was easy to make-but it
must not have been because movies this wry and likable hardly ever get
made. Usually a clunky plot gets in the way, or the filmmakers are
afraid to let their characters seem too smart." (Roger Ebert, The
Chicago Sun Times) 2. "It's hard to remember the last time guys were
nailed so perceptively and dragged into adulthood so warmly and
entertainingly." (Jay Carr, The Boston Globe) 3. "It's the first great
date movie of 2000." (Joe Leydon, Variety) 4. "Few actors could pull off
the amount of narration required of Rob without becoming instantly
annoying; even fewer could make self-absorption somewhat sympathetic."
(Scott Renshaw, Scott Renshaw's Screening Room) 5. "I enjoyed myself
immensely." (Desson Howe, Washington Post)
Really and truly, the above compilation of quotations summarizes my
positive feelings on High Fidelity as a good mix tape should. The film
is perceptive and enjoyable, the most precisely aimed men's movie since
Swingers. Youthful males will see themselves in loquacious Rob (John
Cusack, prototypically charming), a self-pitying record store owner
intent on deciphering the mystery behind his string of failed
relationships. The first question he asks himself is "What came first:
the music or the misery?" Do sad songs ruin us, or do we gravitate
towards them after the heartbreak as a form of therapy? A chicken/egg
scenario if there ever was one.
This is what the fanatical do-I tend to filter all of my life
experiences, for better or worse, through my knowledge and appreciation
of cinema; it helps me give context to a complex emotional pathology.
Rob prisms the minutia of his existence through music-a quintet of
break-ups is related to us as another of his fanboy Top 5 lists, but
what he's really doing is playing the frustrated musician: wittily
recounting his unsuccessful love life-directly for the camera, no
less-is perhaps the closest he'll ever come to releasing a five-song EP.
(To get personal again, many movie critics are actually stymied
filmmakers, and though it's left largely unexplored, I'm assuming that
an absence of viable musical talent is what leads Rob to disc jockeying
and obsessively mixing compilation tapes for others-they're both
vicarious methods of attaining a faint taste of rock star glory.)
Of course, when we meet Rob, he's experiencing the misery instead of the
music whole; spinning records in his dingy apartment, a veritable vinyl
cellar, he's merely listening to the notes-unlike his two hired hands,
Rob's passion for music seems to rollercoaster in tune with his love
life. (He's also organizing his personal collection
"autobiographically", effectively deintellectualizing the albums
themselves.)
Those aforementioned employees are Dick (Todd Louiso), a timid buff of
all songs angst-ridden, and Barry (Jack Black), the sort of elitist one
anticipates meeting in comic book shops: fat, abrasive, elitist,
anti-populist. Barry will loudly, proudly, desperately shove his
knowledge in the face of a customer, and even refuse service to those he
deems unworthy, i.e. ignorant. (Surprise, surprise: Barry wants to form
a band, ill content with his zealot status. Naturally, Rob presumes that
Barry can't sing worth a damn.) Black's character is largely responsible
for the movie's vitality as a portrait of the record-peddling milieu.
Laura (Iben Hjejle), Rob's most recent dating casualty, has paralysed
him with self-examination; managing "Championship Records" (the sign is
missing the "SH") is the only thing getting him out of bed in the
morning, but it's not enough to keep his energies up. He'll sit idly by
as Barry abuses a potential buyer, and his Top 5 lists take on a
spectacular banality (Barry chides him for including the obvious "Smells
Like Teen Spirit" on a rundown of the best first songs of side ones).
Eventually, Rob contacts old flames (two of whom are played, in cameo,
by The Haunting duo Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones), hoping
they'll shed some new light on his perennial girl trouble.
Don't allow his current reputation as a mounter of gloomy, expensive
period pieces (Dangerous Liaisons and Mary Reilly) to deceive you:
Stephen Frears was an ingenious choice of director for High Fidelity.
The source book, by Nick Hornby, takes place in London, and hiring a
UK-born helmer was perhaps its only shot at retaining a British
sensibility in the cinematic shift to Chicago. (It has, profoundly so.)
B-sides, these kinds of working class love/hate stories were Frears'
domain once upon a time, as his Sammy and Rosie Get Laid and Prick Up
Your Ears demonstrate. (Additionally in his favour: Frears had worked
with Cusack before, on The Grifters, and so he understands Cusack's
rhythms and doesn't disturb them.)
Perhaps I mischaracterized High Fidelity as a "men's movie" above, as
the guys at my screening were noticeably squirmy throughout, even as
they laughed uproariously. Rather, it's a movie that those women looking
for an inside track on the male species would do well to attend. It's a
testament to Cusack's familiar screen presence that his character isn't
totally despicable by story's end (or maybe he is, but my gender bias is
getting in the way), as he is largely (and often cruelly) responsible
for the death of all his affairs. One particularly unflattering moment
sees habitual Rob celebrating the possibility of reunion with Laura by
bedding the first available girl he can find. (He's not afraid of
commitment-he's afraid of committing to the wrong girl.)
Rob, Barry, and Dick have been fully realized by a team of excellent
writers, as have all sequences that take place inside "CHAMPION  IP"; I
was notably moved by a scene depicting communion among shoppers over The
Beta Band's "Dry The Rain"-it captures the familial vibe one gets while
visiting these hole-in-the-wall downtown record emporiums. Not quite as
fleshed-out is Laura-she's spoken of as having personality to spare but
doesn't have the chance to reveal enough of it in our company, though
Hjejle projects considerable warmth. Far more problematic is Tim Robbins
as Laura's tentative boyfriend Ian, for his sole defining character
trait becomes a ponytail.
A few late-in-the-game turns of the plot are also underdeveloped. It's a
shame, for instance, that we never get to see the production of a
low-rent CD that figures prominently into the climax, because, in the
words of director George Roy Hill (via William Goldman), "The audience
loves how-to.'" Luckily, the movie's breezy confidence smoothes over
these rough patches.
Twenty years from now, they'll be calling High Fidelity a Golden Oldie;
Frears' latest excited me out of a Rob-like funk (pertaining to the
state of American Cinema) with convincing mise-en-scčne, compelling
leads, an unpredictable soundtrack, and observant humour. It already
feels from a bygone era.

Title
Review for Shadow of the Vampire (2000)
SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE  **1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring John Malkovich, Willem Dafoe, Catherine McCormack, Eddie Izzard
screenplay by Steven Katz
directed by E. Elias Merhige
They certainly dressed the part, in those days. John Malkovich's reading of 
the eminent German filmmaker F.W. Murnau declares: "We are scientists 
engaged in the creation of memory." On set, before the lamps are fired up, 
Murnau and his crew don tinted goggles, looking as if they're about to 
commence atomic testing.
This was standard practice during cinema's formative years, when it took an 
intense amount of light to satisfactorily expose an image. (It was not 
uncommon for those who didn't take precautions to go blind later in life.) 
But Malkovich/Murnau is not describing costumes; he's probably, in fact, 
speaking for the makers of the gothic comedy in which he appears as a 
central figure, Shadow of the Vampire. Director E. Elias Merhige, working 
from a screenplay by Steven Katz, forges a new memoir of Nosferatu, 
Murnau's take on Bram Stoker's Dracula that was rumoured to star a real 
vampire.
Said quote defends the existence of Shadow of the Vampire with mock 
pretension, and it recognizes the outlandish notion that someone might 
accept Merhige's movie at face value, just as Gladiator has probably 
inspired audience members everywhere to query "Maximus" at their favourite 
search engines. And for the duration that Merhige and Katz have tongues 
planted firmly in cheek, their efforts are generously funny, even if some 
of the humour seems anachronistic (there are big laughs at the expense of 
writers and students of the Stanislavsky Method, both of which can be found 
in any send-up of modern Hollywood). Take Willem Dafoe, unrecognizable 
beneath thick latex as Max Schreck, the bloodsucking lead in Murnau's 
production. The uniquely charming actor, one of the few to not embarrass 
himself in portraying Jesus Christ, isn't only asked to deliver jokes in a 
Transylvania 6-5000 accent: his Schreck spoofs the archetypal tragic 
vampyr--Dafoe is playing a mostly cranky, forgetful old man whose major 
affliction is an empty stomach.
Merhige also subverts Weimar-era artistic types with a general tweaking of 
Murnau's clan. Shadow of the Vampire depicts an egotistical helmer who 
doles out information to his peers on a need-to-know basis, a diva starlet 
(Catherine McCormack) with more, but no less insincere, respect for the 
theatre, an alcoholic, Aryan flyboy cameraman (Cary Elwes, channelling 
Klaus Kinski?), and so on. There is the implication, not made strongly 
enough, that Schreck is the most harmless vampire of them all, and even the 
suggestion is indicative of Shadow of the Vampire's reductionist leanings. 
The characters are more behaviourally than conceptually effective--thank 
goodness for the unvaryingly fine performances. I'd love to join the 
critical community in their unanimous adoration of the film, but it occurs 
to me the film's premise has one note and strikes it half-heartedly.
While Merhige nails the nuances of a fascinating period in twentieth 
century history (save a passage of dialogue that equates Murnau's greatness 
with Eisenstein's, who wasn't known at the time of Nosferatu)--the 
painstaking recreation of Murnau's hand-cranked footage is particularly 
arresting--I sympathized a bit too dearly with Schreck, who desires flesh; 
I yearned for something more fleshed-out than this bizarro sitcom. 
Additionally, Shadow of the Vampire is faced with the dilemma of having to 
end, and this is when faux self-importance gives way to something blurrier. 
A witty, not-scathing-enough satire turns nasty and alienatingly 
moralistic. The gifted Merhige should have listened to the advice of many a 
scientist before him: "Back to the drawing board." (--- For more first-run,

Title
Review for Analyze This (1999)
ANALYZE THIS **˝ (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( analyzethis@filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, Chazz Palminteri
screenplay by Peter Tolan, Harold Ramis, and Ken Lonergan
directed by Harold Ramis
Robert DeNiro is not a comedian. He used this to his advantage, in
what is arguably his best performance, as Rupert Pupkin in The King of
Comedy. In Scorsese's 1982 media-age satire, which becomes more
relevant with each passing year, Pupkin is a struggling comic obsessed
with talk show host Jerry Langford (a self-parodying Jerry Lewis) and
the thought of appearing on his program. Pupkin's routines, however,
are painfully unfunny-and he is blithely unaware of his own
mediocrity. That his jokes don't sound like they were written to bomb
(they're liked warmed over Henny Youngman one-liners that a Catskills
veteran could elicit a chuckle or two from) is because of DeNiro's
desperate delivery; the actor has awful timing in his bones. 
As Paul Vitti, the head of a mafia family in Analyze This, DeNiro
sends up his Goodfellas and Casino characters mostly by playing it
straight: when plunked into veritable comedy, we realize just how
goofy the whole mobster attitude can be. Vitti is having anxiety
attacks over his station in life and an upcoming meeting with the
heads of all the families. He seeks counsel from Dr. Ben Sobol
(Crystal, redeeming himself in this post-City Slickers 2/Forget
Paris/Father's Day/My Giant era), a psychiatrist engaged to be married
to reporter Laura (Kudrow). Vitti, who is the movie equivalent of John
Gotti, panics Ben at first. Ben loosens up and agrees to help after he
realizes they share common neuroses over their fathers, but Vitti's
request that he be "cured" in two weeks naturally puts a wrench in
Ben's nuptials. 
Analyze This takes more intelligent potshots at the gangster sub-genre
than, say, last year's Mafia!, but it doesn't attempt to mimic the
baroque visuals of The Godfather films or Once Upon A Time In America.
(One reason I so adore Mel Brooks' hilarious Young Frankenstein is
that it actually looks and feels like a Universal horror picture.)
Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography is full of missed
opportunities-Vitti's world should appear tantalizing, elegant,
and slightly foreboding to Ben. Even the Italian restaurant used in a
sequence that pays homage to the original Godfather looks like as
generic as the pizza parlour on TV's "Everybody Loves Raymond." 
The film's screenplay has similar problems. The concept is so good, so
utterly "pitch-able," that someone else got there first: the film
bears remarkable resemblance to HBO's weekly smash "The Sopranos."
Unlike that show, Analyze This makes the mistake of anchoring its
whole story on an amusing but thin premise. It lacks meat on its
bones: that's why the film is half over before Dr. Sobol officially
agrees to take on his special patient; that's why there are not one
but two wedding sequences, both involving Ben and Laura (!); that's
why Chazz Palminteri's role consists mainly of shouting "I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch Vitti!" every few scenes. (He's a crashing bore
(er, boor)-Palminteri (Hurlyburly) is a good actor in dire need of new
schtick.) The movie really falls apart in its final third, because it
has relied on up to that point the surprisingly excellent chemistry
between Crystal and DeNiro to carry it through, and the climax has
Crystal flying solo in a flat and endless impersonation gag. Academy
Awards aside, Crystal is always funnier playing off an able co-star. 
(Aside: the relationship between Crystal and his intelligent son sadly
remains mostly unexplored at the expense of plot; Kudrow, alas, is
also wasted in the "girlfriend" role she's too damn good for these
days.) 
Yet I'll remember Analyze This as being a fun movie because of DeNiro
and Crystal's rapport. Crystal, who truly gives zingers their zing, is
granted genuinely witty comebacks to DeNiro's numerous threats. (One
can practically hear the ba-bum-ch! drumbeat after his one-liners.)
Surprisingly, they both begin the film playing caricatures but
end up flesh and blood protagonists. The film also features
outstanding supporting work from Joe Viterelli as Vitti's right hand
man Jelly. Lastly, though the script has its flaws, it's at least as
profane as the genuine mob movie article-"Larry Sanders" refugee Tolan
surely must have been the one who liberally peppered Analyze This with
"fucks." Hearing DeNiro use the word is old hat, but hearing Crystal
repeat the word is a scream. 

Title
Review for Lost in Space (1998)
LOST IN SPACE
** (out of four)
--by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(For more lame-ass reviews visit my scum-hearted website: FILM FREAK
CENTRAL! http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504 Lots to read, and
a special section called CAN'T MISS where you can tell me (and others)
what to see. Visit it, you damn filthy apes!)
starring Matt LeBlanc, Gary Oldman, William Hurt, Mimi Rogers
written by Akiva Goldsman
directed by Stephen Hopkins
Lost In Space is better entertainment than the TV series upon which it
is based; to say that is to damn the film to faint praise, for it
should eradicate all memory of that barely entertaining '60's
show. Unfortunately, like its predecessor, Lost In Space only knows
how to lose the Astro Family Robinson--once they're lost, it becomes a
concept in search of a story.
LeBlanc stars as Major Don West, an ace pilot ordered to fly the
Robinson family to a distant planet so that they may prepare said
planet for future colonization--Earth's destruction, due to a civil
war, seems inevitable, so humans will be relocated to habitable Alpha
Prime. (Why the war wouldn't then be relocated also is not a subject
broached.) Unfortunately, they are sidetracked by evil engineer
Dr. Smith (Oldman), who first intends to sabotage the 10-year mission
but is betrayed by his own men, and stuck on board as a result. With
part of Smith's plan already executed, the Robinsons are forced to
abort their journey to Alpha Prime, drive through the sun, and fend
for themselves against various encounters, some alien, some less so.
After a rousing opening battle sequence, some nifty special effects,
and the suspenseful sun trip, Lost In Space becomes lost itself. Lost
in awkward characterizations (you'd never know the irritating Lacey
Chabert, as Penny, was familiar with Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, let alone
their daughter); lost in lifted-from-Star Trek plot points (the
future- spoiling "time bubble" that is the climax has become stock
sci-fi material); lost in increasingly bad computer-generated images
(the Robinsons encounter a pointless, "cute" space monkey, which looks
as if it has wandered off the Toy Story set--worse, so badly
integrated, it looks Scotch-taped to the film). I wasn't expecting
brilliance from the un-ironically bad screenwriter Goldsman (Batman
and Robin), nor director Hopkins (Predator 2), so the fact that the
first half is actually good makes it all the more unnerving. The cast
mostly rises above the material, Chabert and LeBlanc excepted. LeBlanc
comes off like his Friends alter-ego--aspiring actor Joey--playing a
part for laughs in a big-budget movie. Gary Oldman and little Jack
Johnson are standouts; as Will (as in, "Danger, Will Robinson!"),
Johnson has a lot of charisma, and he's cute enough that they can lose
the space monkey.
Oh, if they had. If they had lost so many things instead of their
marbles...
Perhaps the sequel will be an improvement.

Title
Review for Happiness (1998)
HAPPINESS **** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(Visit my review archive, play some movie trivia, and more!
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/ )
starring Dylan Baker, Jane Adams, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Cynthia
Stevenson
written and directed by Todd Solondz
The best movie of the year is, unfortunately, neither an 'entertaining'
nor a mainstream experience. I doubt HAPPINESS will enjoy success as
more than just a critical darling, for Solondz paints an even grimmer
portrait of suburbia than last year's The Ice Storm, as well as his own
Sundance winner, Welcome to the Dollhouse. HAPPINESS is not escapism; it
is a film for grown-ups.
Its narrative structure is Altman-esque. We meet three New Jersey
sisters: Joy Jordan (Adams), a single woman who fears her
passive-aggressive behavior provokes hostility in loved ones; Helen
(Lara Flynn Boyle), a famous poet with a private desire to be dominated;
and Trish (Stevenson), mother of three and wife of reputable
psychiatrist Bill Maplewood (Baker)-Trish is constantly boasting about
her idyllic home-life to her siblings. She is unaware that her shrink
husband lusts after young boys-teeny-bop magazines are fodder for his
obsessions. Nor is Dr. Maplewood above molesting one of his eleven year
old son's friends with the assistance of the date-rape drug. Meanwhile,
his patients are carrying out their own psychosexual
fantasies: Allen, Helen's anonymous, depraved, overweight neighbour,
spends his days as an affable office crony but at night strips down to
his underwear, gets drunk, calls women at random and barks orders at
them of the sort one hears in porno films. (The movie rather amusingly
makes an issue out of *69.) Helen is his fantasy figure, but he is
unable to connect with anyone on a sexually mature level, comfortless in
his own skin. Which makes his verbal abuse of equally portly other
neighbour Kristina (Camryn Manheim) all the more perplexing.
I could go on illustrating the various plot-threads: the Jordan girls'
separated parents (played by Ben Gazzarra and Louise Lasser; to my mind,
this bickering couple are the least compelling aspect of HAPPINESS)
cause perfectionist Trish much consternation, and Joy's difficult
relationship with a Russian refugee cabbie (Jared Harris) confuses Joy
further. (I've only described the tip of this 134 minute iceberg.) Yet
the soul of the film is one story: pedophilic Dr. Maplewood had my
sympathies to the very end, even as I was sickened by his actions. (The
events leading up to a boy's rape earned laughs from a preview audience
of nervous critics, which led a few of them to attack Solondz for
trivializing the subject matter-he didn't.) Baker's portrayal is
captivating and four-dimensional; Maplewood's scenes with loving son
Billy (Rufus Read)-whose own open, innocent desire to experience
ejaculation for the first time forces his father to confront his boy's
burgeoning adolescene at a time when his own secret nature is getting
the best of him-are heartbreaking, to say the least.
If someone were to ask me to summarize HAPPINESS in one awkward
sentence, I would probably respond: a group of characters discover that
acting upon their impulses, sexual and otherwise, will bring them
temporary "happiness"-they seem to have ditched all notions of attaining
it beyond superficially. What is happiness, anyway, and who said it
could/should/would last? Solondz' film, from the charged opening scene
(featuring a cameo by a raging Jon Lovitz!) to the melancholy (yet
controversial) finish, is a breathtakingly naturalistic creation. On the
cinematic side of things, the images seemed oversaturated at times-lawn
greens were so vibrant-looking, it was as if they'd been painted. (And
isn't that the point? Suburbia looks shiny on the surface?) I also
appreciated the old-fashioned title cards-HAPPINESS incidentally shares
its name with a 1924 silent.
Universal's "independent" division (an oxymoron), October, abandoned
Solondz' picture after his final cut turned out to be too "edgy" for
release under the major's banner. So Good Machine (the production
company behind, not ironically, The Ice Storm) is distributing it
instead. It's their first time at bat without support from a major
financier. Show them they took an important risk and see HAPPINESS, a
film for our times.

Title
Review for Go (1999)
GO *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( go@filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Sarah Polley, Desmond Askew, Jay Mohr, Scott Wolf
screenplay by John August
directed by Doug Liman
Go's is a gloriously slick hip machine. Director Liman (who also
photographed Go) and screenwriter August celebrate the drug/rave scene
in L.A., preferring to take (comedic) snapshots of troubled youth
rather than critique them. After more than ninety minutes of
pill-popping, tantric sex, car chases, and attempted murder, Go even
has a happy ending. This is the sort of film that gives members of the
Dove Foundation splitting headaches; as Go wound down, I anticipated
an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder
sermon that (blessedly) didn't arrive.
A la Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Go is comprised of three separate but
related stories. The basics are as follows: Ronna (Polley) is a bitter
grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for
extra dough. Her co-worker, Simon (the improbably named Askew), is a
clubber from Britain ecstatic about his first trip to Vegas.  Zack
(Mohr) and Adam (Wolf) are soap opera stars escaping a
career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop (Fichtner)
in a drug bust. Perhaps because the innovative structure of
Tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat, the id-fueled Go
delighted me but rarely surprised me (with the exception of that
mind-reading cat!); Pulp Fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen, but
we see Go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last.
Torontonian Polley (of The Sweet Hereafter) refused to do publicity
for this picture on the basis that she was "not pleased with" her turn
as the ill-fated cashier. In Go, she delivers, hands-down, her best
performance to date. Here's an (overrated) actress who agreed to
appear on the poster, but not support her team at the junket or in 
interviews; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for Ms. Polley, as
anyone who has read of her political agenda in the Canadian press will
tell you. If she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment, she
should have said "No," not Go.
But I digress. Go is a fun film, so chipperly depraved one can't help
but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride.
In that sense, it's a departure from Liman's last film, Swingers,
which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of Vince
Vaughan's Trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever
epilogue (which has been aped by McDonald's for their latest
commercial). I wish I cared more about Go's characters: like 
the techno music they listen to, the bands of anarchists on display
here are at once absorbing and vacuous. When the lights came up and
stung my eyes, it was difficult to recall what about it entertained
me.
Yet entertain me it did. Go is light and frothy, featuring compelling
if not endearing work by Polley, Timothy Olyphant (Scream 2), and
especially Fichtner, whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective
laughs. Fichtner is a character actor best known for playing
backstabbers (in Heat, Armageddon, and others); his previously
untapped comic abilities shine in Go. Unlike much of the film,
Fichtner is unpredictable.

Review for Wild Wild West (1999)
WILD WILD WEST *˝ (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( wwwest@filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Salma Hayek
screenplay by Brent Maddock, S.S. Wilson, Peter S. Seaman, and Jeffrey
Price
directed by Barry Sonnenfeld
If you don't think Kevin Kline in drag is funny, wait til you see
Will Smith in drag-it's even less funny. By the time Jim West (Smith)
disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade,
Artemus Gordon (Kline), from the clutches of evil Dr. Loveless
(Branagh), I was unequivocally bored by Wild Wild West, the new summer
blockbuster from Men in Black director Barry Sonnenfeld.
Is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy, anyway? (If
your answer is no, then you recall Rustler's Rhapsody or Back to the
Future Part III; if your answer is yes, you're thinking of Blazing
Saddles, but that movie was a parody of the western genre, not a
nineteenth century romp.)
1869. Jim West is a quick-draw lawman who teams up with brainiac
federal agent Gordon, under orders from President Grant (Kline again,
whose impression, for all we know, is dead-on), to apprehend legless
Loveless, the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the United
States and sell it back to Britain and Spain. How will Loveless
accomplish this? Well, by hulking around the desert in an enormous,
mechanical tarantula, of course.
Bosomy dance hall girl Rita Escobar (Hayek), whose scientist father
was kidnapped by Loveless, joins West and Gordon on their
gadget-filled train. (Gordon first discovers Rita in a cage, waiting
to be rescued.) Racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers
from pairing dull Rita romantically with West, despite the movie's
"hip" attitude toward the black thing. (West automatically shoots
anyone who calls him a "nigger" before that person can finish speaking
the word. Super.) At any rate, I kept waiting for Rita to say
something humourous, but she's a walking dress-up toy. (Her single
comic moment is also the best shot of the film: she bashfully reveals
bare bumcheeks through the peek-a-boo flap of her pyjamas.)
Jim West is the role that finally stymied Will Smith, whose comic
timing has always been hit or miss, as episodes of "The Fresh Prince
of Bel-Air" demonstrate. Smith's a better reactor than actor, which is
why he was so thoroughly engaging in Men in Black-he didn't start out
a hero. In Wild Wild West he's required to exude Eastwood cool and
amuse at the same time (and from frame one), a difficult feat I'm not
sure any living performer could pull off. Smith is ill equipped, for
example, to handle the moment in which Jim West performs stand-up for
some rednecks at his own hanging. 
What attracted Sonnenfeld to this material? This isn't the first time
he has adapted a TV show for the big screen (The Addams Family,
anyone?), but it's the first big stinker of his career as a director.
Wild Wild West is poorly-paced bombast, full of DOA gags (Ted Levine
shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid;
Levine played Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs-he's too
intense to get an intentional laugh), lousy special effects (the
bluescreening is amateurish-foregrounds are never proportionate to the
backgrounds), and frequent illogic. (To wit, its ridiculous villain so
badly wants Jim West out of the way that he...drops him onto a steel
platform to do battle with some generic, ugly henchmen, instead of
shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board
the tarantula.)
Wild Wild West's bright spots, such as the cool opening credits
sequence, Bai Ling's all-too-brief appearance as a femme fatale, or
the brilliant "His Master's Voice" joke, are all part of the film's
first half, which is more clever and enjoyable, at least, than its
second. When, towards what seemed like the end of Wild Wild West,
Gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and West rejects it,
there was a collective groan among audience members: it meant we were
going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before
Gordon builds the glider, the invention of which would inevitably lead
to the proverbial whiz-bang finale.

Title
Review for Notting Hill (1999)
NOTTING HILL *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( nottinghill@filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Rhys Ifans, Gina McKee
screenplay by Richard Curtis
directed by Roger Michell
Notting Hill's trailer is awful: a laughless, schmaltzy montage. The
movie was desperately marketed to the anti-Phantom Menace crowd, the
same lovelorn females who ignored The Love Letter. And it apparently
worked. Perhaps the presence of Julia Roberts-whose allure beyond
those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with Notting
Hill's opening weekend success, but the film's staying power is based
on word of mouth. Allow me to spread some more good buzz for Notting
Hill.
Grant stars as William Thacker, a travel-bookstore owner who works and
resides in a tiny English district called Notting Hill. Into his shop
one day wanders famous actress Anna Scott (Roberts). A common thief,
some spilled orange juice, and some stilted conversation leads to
their first, highly impetuous (or is that improbable?), kiss. Days
later, William sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a
magazine journalist, and so begins a passionate, albeit surreptitious,
affair. (Aside: Notting Hill's portrayal of press junkets is deadly
accurate.) Only Anna's celebrity-or William's lack thereof-threatens
to drive a wedge between them.
Richard Curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered, and for
at least its first half-hour the picture's "Beauty and the Beast"-like
scenario is (romantic) escapism of the highest order. As with
Groundhog Day or Pleasantville, while watching the high-concept comedy
Notting Hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead; it's
William's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored Anna. Curtis
(who previously penned Four Weddings and a Funeral) is also smart
enough to know that the unlikely couple's situation is not enough to
fuel two hours' worth of entertainment, so some of Notting Hill's
finest moments revolve around William's eccentric friends and family.
By now, dear reader, you've probably heard a lot about Rhys Ifans'
performance as William's imbecilic Welsh flatmate. Yes, he's a crowd
pleaser, a walking sight gag, but his character is not nearly as
involving as the wheelchair-bound (and appropriately named) Bella
(McKee, the anguished waitress of Naked) or Max (Tom McInnerny), her 
lousy chef of a husband. In the movie's best sequence, William, Anna,
and company sit around bloated from Max's latest concoction and hold a
contest: the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the
saddest life. The scene ends only as a British writer would end it.
If anything, fantastic bits like these dull the main plot's dramatic
impact. Roberts and Grant, especially, are appealing, but their
relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times (Four
Weddings' suffered similar flaws), and William and Anna ultimately
only have one thing in common: they're lonely. (Worth noting in
Roberts' and Grant's favour: the ubiquitous "I'm just a girl, standing
across from a boy, asking him to love her" episode is not nearly so
syrupy as it appears in clips, and it features some of the best
emoting either actor has ever done.) Notting Hill is nonetheless
enjoyable; on the visual side of things, I especially appreciated
Michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number. If only (and this is
a surprisinly minor gripe) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue;
for a story that thrives on what we bring to it, the filmmakers work
too hard to tidy things up, leaving our imaginations in the lurch.

Title
Review for Batman & Robin (1997)
A month ago I wrote that Speed 2 was the worst film I've ever reviewed
on paper. I didn't know at the time that I'd soon encounter and
despise Batman & Robin, which has just overtaken Speed 2 as the
picture least worthy of your attention this summer. As directed by
Joel Schumacher (who now specializes in Batman sequels and John
Grisham adaptations and isn't very good at either), B & R is one long
excuse for a Taco Bell promotion. The plot, which has Mr. Freeze and
Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) planning to take over Gotham City and then
"the vorld" (as an oddly ineffective Schwarzenegger states), is
weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust,
partnership, blah, blah, blah. But morals are not the point of this
film--topping each bloated, confusing action scene with next one
is. The garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this
picture oddly comparable to the trashy Showgirls. Since when did
Gotham City become a giant Las Vegas hotel? Only George Clooney comes
out on top; he underplays nicely and pretends like he's in a real
movie. * (out of four)

Title
Review for Antz (1998)
ztarring the voicez of Woody Allen, Zharon Ztone, Gene Hackman,
Zylvezter Ztallone
zcreenplay by Todd Alcott and Chris Weitz
directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnzon
Darnell, Johnson, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Danny Glover, Jennifer
Lopez, and Christopher Walken file into the sweaty, crowded Tudor Room
of Toronto's Four Seasons to discuss the Dreamworks/PDI production
ANTZ, a computer-generated movie that took two-and-a-half years to
complete. ANTZ will beat the not dissimilar Disney/Pixar project A
Bug's Life to screens by a month-that's why Jeffrey Katzenberg-Michael
Eisner's spurned (business) lover, and the K in Dreamworks SKG-is
there, tucked between some cameras and journalists:
he's gloating. Should he be? 
This is the first time this partial cast has been together; most of
their dialogue was recorded separately. All were cast on the basis of
their reputations. Said Darnell: "No auditions for these guys." A
discussion of the liberties afforded by voice acting goes something
like this: 
     Walken: "The animators kind of duplicate your body language." 
     Aykroyd (who plays a wasp): "They got the length of my stinger
too short." (Laughs.)
Woody Allen was cast very early on, which meant "we could really write
for him and stage for him," said Darnell. Perhaps it's no surprise
that Woody Allen's performance' is the best thing about ANTZ; the
movie begins with his character, "Z", kvetching on a psychiatrist's
couch about such insect dilemmas as being the middle child of
two-and-a-half-million siblings. Z knows there is something more to
life than burrowing through dirt tunnels. It's Deconstructing Harry
for the lunchbox set. 
Z, a worker ant, embarks on a journal of self-discovery: having fallen
in love with an ant princess (Stone), Z disguises himself as a soldier
at war, just to see her again. (Huh?) Thanks in large part to his
cowardice, Z is the only survivor of the Starship Troopers-like
termite battle that transpires. Lionized by his peers, Z's true
identity is discovered by the mean general (Hackman); Z subsequently
takes the princess hostage and heads for the hills. Together, Z and
his reluctant guest search for the mythical "Insectopia", with
pursuers not far behind. 
ANTZ' biggest problem is its lack of focus: one minute it's about a
war, the next about Insectopia, the next about the general's dastardly
plot against the entire ant colony. Z is looking for something
"better", and without giving too much away, he basically finds it
halfway through the film...yet the proceedings continue. Hackman's
villain is uninspired and, frankly, two-dimensional, like some reject
from Dreamworks' other military-themed cartoon Small Soldiers. The
whole film is a bit too mean-spirited, also. (With the words like
"damn" and "hell" liberally tossed around by the ANTZ characters, I
should be pleased as punch-it's the lack of humour with which these
curses are delivered that I found startling.) Also, even in
animated-insect form, the romance that blossoms between Woody
and Sharon is highly suspect. 
What about the look of the film? Some scenes in ANTZ are gorgeous,
like the tidal wave, or the establishing scenes of the colony. Others
play out in dull shot-reverse-shot, like the non-interactive sequences
of a CD-ROM game. I wasn't keen on Z's appearance-while other ants
resembled their human counterparts (Walken and Glover especially), PDI
has toiled to make Z look as un-Woody as possible. The result is an
aesthetically unappealing creation that might feel physically
mismatched with any actor's voice. (And why is it the characters are
expressionistic while the backgrounds are super-realistic?) 
When confronted about the competing A Bug's Life at the ANTZ press
conference, Aykroyd did some of the talking: "Different story. Lotta
heart in this one." Lotta? No. Some? Sure. Ultimately, it is difficult
to mine warmth from a story about an ant colony; worse, the only real
guffaws come from Allen doing Allen. (Cheap, cheap laughs.) ANTZ feels
computer-generated in every way.

Title
Review for Onegin (1999)
ONEGIN ***1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Ralph Fiennes, Liv Tyler, Toby Stephens, Lena Headey
screenplay by Peter Ettedgui and Michael Ignatieff,
based on the poem "Yevgeny Onegin" by Alexander Pushkin
directed by Martha Fiennes
"When will the devil take me?" he asks rhetorically in lulling voice
over. The spoiled title character of _Onegin_ (pronounced Oh-negg-in) is
waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour.
Martha Fiennes' debut feature is (quite literally) filmed poetry (it's
based on an epic Russian poem by Alexander Pushkin), a profound study of
regret, of how we confuse shame with guilt.
When we first meet Eugene Onegin (Ralph, acting for his sister; another
brother, Magnus, composed the score), a philandering aristocrat from St.
Petersburg, he has just inherited his uncle's estate. With plans to sell
it, Onegin pays a summer visit to the manor, which is located in an
underpopulated Russian countryside, and not long into the trip he meets
a neighbouring family of blue bloods. Smitten with Olga Larina (Headey),
he befriends Olga's fiancé, Vladimir Lensky (Stephens), while Olga's
sister, Tatyana (Tyler), romanticizing his flippant attitude (he's a
nineteenth bad boy), falls for Onegin.
In one sweaty, inky torrent of passion, Tatyana writes him a love
letter. He is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections,
it is implied, because he can. Soon after, tragedy strikes, and Onegin
makes himself scarce. When we catch up with him, six years later, he has
just returned to St. Petersburg, where at a grand ball he discovers that
an old friend (Donovan) has married a more womanly and wordly Tatyana.
This time, Onegin finds her irresistable.
What is most amazing about Ralph Fiennes' performance is his subtle
physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch. Overwhelmed
by a top hat, the Onegin who pines for Tatyana seems smaller in stature
than the one who brushed her off, an Ebeneezer Scrooge trapped in
Christmas past.
The actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there's
room to breathe in a role that's made up of shades of gray like
"Onegin". Petula Clark sang of a universal phenomenon in "Parking Lot":
"You don't know what you've got til it's gone." Onegin's about-face on
Tatyana speaks for those of us (read: most of us) who need confirmation
that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well.
What the character feels is not jealousy but remorse, embarrassment,
even, at having let her go. Out of identification we feel empathy for
Onegin, a callous bastard.
Tatyana's emotions echo a thousand ditties, but that makes them no less
vital. She changes, too, from a girl in crush to a woman with divided
loyalties. Tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her UK
co-stars, filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a
series of wanton stares. They both have faces, Mr. Fiennes and Ms.
Tyler, capable of conveying archetypal Russian misery.
_Onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode
of "Masterpiece Theater", even with its current cast of thoroughbreds
intact, were Martha Fiennes not at the helm. An MTV background (she cut
her teeth directing rock videos for XTC and others) has positively
influenced her sense of pace (though, thankfully, not her shot
lengths-no spasmodic cutting here); at just over 100 minutes, _Onegin_
clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair.
The film has an atypical period look, as well. Absent are the sumptuous
tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character
in those drippy Merchant Ivory productions. The sets are almost
expressionistically bare, echoing the loneliness of the protagonists.
(Cinematographer Remi Adafarasin often allows space to engulf them; I'm
reminded the climax, which unfolds in a sea of white.)
Martha Fiennes has a clear command of cinema, and her spare, often
painfully human visual presentation of "Yevgeny Onegin" is arguably the
most lucid translation of Pushkin's difficult text yet. Ms. Fiennes may
be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since Jane Campion.

Title
Review for Three Kings (1999)
THREE KINGS *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (3kings@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonze
written and directed by David O. Russell
The soldiers of Three Kings have taken their cue from movies about
Vietnam. (Fitting, since the media-saturated Gulf War became a pop
entertainment.) While driving through a long, flat Iraqi desert (in a
Humvee with a Bart Simpson hood ornament), one of the men under
Special Forces Sgt. Maj. Archie Gates' (who's steering) command
requests a Beach Boys tune. These men want their Apocalypse Now
moment, only instead of surfing, they bop to the music and skeet shoot
out the back of the vehicle, armed with automatic rifles. 
Our three kings (okay, four) are good fighters, but they don't
necessarily take Operation Desert Storm seriously-it's a reprieve from
their hellish day jobs. They are Gates, new father Sgt. Troy Barlow
(Wahlberg), Sgt. Chief Elgin (Cube), and Pvt. Conrad Vig (music video
director Jonze). At story's start, President Bush has declared a
ceasefire, and American troops are tying up loose ends. Barlow, Elgin,
and Vig discover during a round up of Iraqi captives an "ass-map" that
points to a bunker filled with gold bullion. 
Gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation; he
proposes-demands-that Barlow, Elgin, and Vig join him on a treasure
hunt. Ditching his escort, a relentless reporter named Adriana Cruz
(Nora Dunn), is easy. So is finding the treasure, until the four men
realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in Iraq: Saddam's men
are threatening the dictator's detractors (citizens of his own
country) with violence. 
When Gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck, ready
to loot, the unarmed rebels want help. (Bush encouraged them to rise
up against the government, but provided no military support for such
cause.) Gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war
mission, and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck. The
situation could go off without a hitch: the former enemies bear no
grudges. But the money hungry Gates has a conscience, and when one
female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these Americans
have left the scene, he orders Barlow, Elgin and Vig to open fire on
the surrounding Arab forces. The result: Barlow is kidnapped, and the
filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than
they ever did during wartime. 
Barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking
device. His interrogator lost his family to the bombs, and he wants
Barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child. (He does, in
chilling, lasting images.) I liked these scenes best, because the
political became personal. It's one thing to champion the plight of
thousands; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a
crib. Russell has shocked us before: his first film, Spanking the
Monkey, is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother. (It's
great.) His second, Flirting With Disaster, features a character who
has an armpit fetish. One could argue that it's easier to make an
audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions, though;
Russell disturbs us in Three Kings by being no-nonsense about the
violence. When Barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home,
Russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead
of THX bombast. 
Three Kings is Russell's first visually arresting picture.
Stylistically, it stands apart from other war dramas. Newton Thomas
Sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely
grainy, which is, of course, entirely appropriate. One practically
breaks out in sweat staring at the screen. (A friend enthusiastically
added, "It's like having sand in your eyes.") This also helps to blur
the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the Persian
Gulf facade. (Three Kings was shot in Arizona, California, and
Mexico.) Russell throws plenty at Sigel's camera for it to observe-as
was the case with Russell's previous efforts, the most absurd moments
are also the film's most realistic, even the most poignant. (We watch
a bullet puncture an organ from the inside.) 
If anything, Three Kings settles down and stops surprising us. Its
climax is pure Hollywood, no doubt the answer to why a major studio
felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded Russell.
Subsequently, the characters become more cartoonish-Barlow's
post-torture revelry felt phony, and Chief, a strong presence in the
first third, fails to escape the
God-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power cliché-so
much for Cube avoiding token status. (The Arab players, on the other
hand, duck stereotype.) Clooney, too, transforms into a blandly heroic
protestor-marching with the rebels, I waited for him to shout, "Let my
people go!" Hayseed Vig notwithstanding, the protagonists are very
intelligent, and self-serving, too; I had a glimmer of hope, based on
Russell's filmography, that our antiheroes would revert to their
greedy selves at some juncture. (It's not spoiling much to write
that.)
Then again, what historical importance would such nastiness serve?
(There's already enough cynicism in the film's mentioning of Kuwait's
oil-infested waters.) Russell offers the masses a primer on the
oft-dismissed Gulf conflict, and pulled off a neat trick: a war tale
full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared. If
he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally
significant, he succeeded. With flair.

Title
Review for Loser (2000)
LOSER *1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, Greg Kinnear
written and directed by Amy Heckerling
*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*
As with most of her films, director Amy Heckerling's latest, Loser, seesaws 
between unpleasant and artificial, and is sometimes both at once. When she 
tackles big issues, such as abortion in Fast Times at Ridgemont High , it's 
impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them 
(they carry an almost documentary starkness), but whatever the case, she 
continually refuses to comment politically. Such is the sitcom tendency of 
her work: to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the 
reset button. This fear of drama soured me on Fast Times..., Look Who's 
Talking, Clueless, and now Loser, in which Ms. Heckerling also 
demonstrates, for the first time, zero affinity for the milieu.
Has anyone, for instance, ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of Mena 
Suvari's Dora? Attired in black thrift, her eye shadow smeared to racoon 
chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips, she accepts 
the label of goth, but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to 
digging, as Dora does, those geriatric rockers Everclear, nor willingly 
went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger. The mechanics of 
Loser's tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its 
protagonists into cultural non-specificity, so that they become even less 
than stereotypes. They become walking wardrobes.
Small-town transplant Paul (a strangely static Jason Biggs), our eponymous 
hero, always wears his woolly hunter's cap with flaps covering the ears, 
and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn't scream "Shemp" (the lame 
Stooge) wig louder. He has three smug-looking roommates (the 
one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers, but they share similar 
facial features, including and especially mouths), and their fashion sense 
is incomprehensibly glam. Though they're not overtly transvestites, 
Heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy; how very 
Cruising of her. (The dormies conspire to evict Paul and regularly molest 
women they have drugged. Dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape 
potions. Unfortunately, either Heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to 
admit if she was subsequently violated.)
When Paul rescues Dora from said narcotic scare, he learns that she is 
dating their unctuous European lit professor Edward Alcott (superb Greg 
Kinnear). Although Paul's already in love with Dora by this point, as is 
bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name, he gets 
altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from Alcott. 
She's thrilled, but nevertheless spends a few days at Paul's to recuperate; 
the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a Broadway play ("Cabaret"), 
and just when Paul's got in his head that she's starting to love him back 
in that non-friendly way, she decides to become Alcott's live-in 
girlfriend. Cue precious hommage to The Graduate , shots of Paul drifting 
around Berkeley--er... (Aside: Simon & Garfunkel's "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary 
& Thyme" should never have been allowed in another motion picture.)
Heckerling has a lot in common with Nora "You've Got Mail " Ephron, the 
only other prominent chick directing comedies today, in that neither has 
any use for strong-willed women. Men continue to trod on Dora until the 
bitter end (in the final scene, she gives Paul a big smooch after he blurts 
out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum), and Dora 
ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after Paul 
hints to her that she was poisoned, she's cheerily redecorating his 
apartment. (Heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that 
she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue 
titles.)
Goth veneer aside, there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as 
erratically as Dora, and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies 
about them. Heckerling misses her shot at having Dora transform herself 
into a role model, and while such arcs may not be Heckerling's social 
responsibility, it is a privilege I would have taken advantage of if I were 
in her shoes. (Consider, too, that Dora is the film's sole female 
principal.) Not that Loser is worth contemplating this seriously--God knows 
Heckerling didn't. That is her hallmark. (--- For more first-run, DVD, and

Review for Postman, The (1997)

New address. New attitude. Same crappy writing.)
I'll bet right now you're just lounging by the pool, humming "I Will
Always Love You" and
wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success. It isn't
necessarily over for you: I
say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in
"Kevin!" for at least a few
more years. Begin by scribbling "the star that burns twice as bright
burns half as long"
somewhere you'll always see it, perhaps on the fridge door, or on a
bedroom mirror with
lipstick. You had a heck of a thing going there until you agreed to star
in Robin Hood: Prince of
Thieves, where you were not only upstaged by powerhouses Morgan Freeman
and Alan
Rickman, but Christian Slater (!), several dozen tall trees, bows,
arrows, and a canoe, too.
After Dances With Wolves and JFK, you decided the world needed more
three hour movies,
expensive three hour movies, so you starred in and produced Wyatt Earp;
Wyatt Earp the
man was a boring idiot who made the history books solely due to a
general lack of famous
Wyatts. Wyatt Earp was so dull a cowboy that he died of natural causes.
Tombstone was a
vastly superior movie based on the same legend, and that featured Kurt
Russell as Earp and
Dana Delaney as his girlfriend! (She was played by Joanna Going in your
movie-you know,
the character known best in Wyatt Earp as "Jew Whore". What were you and
Lawrence
Kasdan thinking?)
Now, you're suffering the demise of yet another of your epics, The
Postman, a film so
financially disastrous that it all but eradicated the memory
Waterworld's and Tin Cup's
mildly lucrative box office takes. The Postman is not the worst movie
ever made-people in
Hollywood are quick to forget movies like Howard the Duck whenever the
next bomb comes
along. Yet it is a ridiculous movie. I suspect you thought you had
another Braveheart on your
hands-why else line up two armies on horesback, all prepared for battle,
for the climax of
your film?-but "Mailheart" The Postman is not. (I can think of some more
appropriate
alternate titles: Post Encounters of the Worst Kind; Farewell, My
Salary; Howard the
Postman; The Postman's Never Watched Twice...)
What a brown movie. I hate brown. You love brown. Dances With Wolves was
golden and
brown-it looked like an Eggo commercial. The Postman had me running for
a glass of water
every two minutes; would the post-apocalyptic world look this
maddeningly bland and dry?
What exactly happened to this desert world, anyway? Did we all become so
stupid that we
didn't immediately begin rebuilding homes, restaurants, and most
importantly, shopping
malls, after "the war"? Why did you choose to drive the movie's plot
with a dumb group of
terrorists who, well, terrorize townfolk across America? Why is it only
*they* have ammunition,
anyway? Was it really appropriate to cast your DAUGHTER as a girl who
has a sweet crush
on you, the drifter-cum-postman? Why cast English actress Olivia
Williams as an American?
Don't you realize that European women can only deliver their big
emotional scenes in their
native accent? (Take a look at the less-than-stellar performances of an
American-ized Nicole
Kidman or an American-ized Minnie Driver.) Who could give a damn whether
you lived or
died at the end of this movie? If it came down to a fight for leadership
between you and the
leader of the terrorists, why didn't you do that halfway through the
film and save us all a lot
of headaches? Why cast Will Patton as the bad guy? Because you worked
with him in No Way
Out? Sure, he's a suitably creepy villain; know why? Because he's creepy
in everything,
including Armageddon, in which he plays a heroic astronaut who
practically slithers into his
space suit! Why heroize the most demonic institution in America, the
U.S. Postal System? Was
Tom Petty supposed to be playing Tom Petty? If so, why didn't he look
more skeletal? (He
should have been around 70 years old.) Why, oh why, do I have so many
questions? (I could
ask plenty more.) Shouldn't a three hour running time have provided you
enough space to
answer everything?
You have one great line in this film, and you deliver it to a mule!:
"The things I like about my
ass..." I had to wonder. Actually, I enjoyed the tone of the opening
scenes, a relaxed cynicism,
if you'll accept such clunky phrasing-too bad you couldn't resist the
temptation to film yet
another love letter to your country.
Ultimately, I'm saying relax. There is no quota, no need for you to make
a picture a year.
Settle down. Really question future screenplays before you commit to
them.
Feel free to write back. I know how much you like letters.

Review for Living Out Loud (1998)
LIVING OUT LOUD ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
[For past reviews, bi-weekly trivia, etc., visit
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/ ]
starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito, Martin Donovan, Queen Latifah
written and directed by Richard LaGravanese
LIVING OUT LOUD started production as "The Kiss" (borrowed from
Chekhov's story), a title dropped because of its associations with a
best-selling, non-fictional account of a father and daughter's
incestuous relationship. LIVING OUT LOUD is not about such family ties;
it's not about much of anything---a sheep dressed in "Girl Power"
clothing. LIVING OUT LOUD is the directorial debut of a wonderful
screenwriter (LaGravanese adapted The Bridges of Madison County and The
Horse Whisperer, in addition to receiving an Oscar-nomination for his
original screenplay The Fisher King) who should stay behind the
typewriter.
A blonde Hunter plays Judith, caregiver to an old, rich woman (Lin
Shaye) and recent dumpee of husband Dr. Nelson (the always-charismatic
Donovan). Judith fantasizes some of the time: about suicide, about
meeting her idol, torch singer Liz Bailey (Latifah)... These day-dream
sequences are weaved into the film without warning; sometimes, we're not
sure whether a scene is unfolding inside or outside of her head. (Echoes
of Le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie, Louis Buńuel's anti-narrative
masterwork.) DeVito plays Pat, the down-on-his luck elevator operator of
her building; his teenage daughter has just passed away, so he Judith
unite over their common losses. He falls in love with her quickly, but
she has her sights set on the mysterious stranger (Elias Koteas) who
accidentally (yes, accidentally) made out with her at her favourite
nightclub. Actually, Judith has her sights set on any man who is the
exact physical opposite of chubby, stubby Pat, though the filmmakers
gloss over her shallowness.
LaGravanese has an ear for dialogue-born and raised in a household of
women, he writes exceptionally good, complex female characters. But this
movie has all the trappings of a first-timer's feature: no sense of
economy-otherwise known as I'm-in-love-with-every-frame Syndrome
(DeVito's daughter's silent death scene is covered in so many shots the
cutting disrupts the mood), no sense of pace (though never boring, the
middle section is lumpy), and no idea what to do with anybody else but
the main protagonists (with the exception of Latifah, who has a presence
which extends beyond her slightly underwritten role-I wouldn't be
surprised if she received a Supporting Actress nomination come next
February). DeVito gives it his all-this is the warmest performance of
his career, which makes Judith seem all the more like a cold fish for
shunning his awkward advances; we are supposed to see a little bit of
ourselves in Judith, but I lost my affection for her once she hired a
studly masseuse before DeVito's despondent eyes. Reactions to Hunter's
character will surely vary from person to person (after all, selfishness
is our nature, and to some degree, Judith is a refreshingly flawed human
character), but her actions, compounded by a head-scratching "Mary Tyler
Moore"-esque epilogue, are ultimately what prevent me from recommending
the film.
I have mentally dwelled upon LIVING OUT LOUD for weeks since my initial
viewing, only to come to the above conclusions. At the very least,
DeVito begins a new career path with this film-were he and Latifah only
reason enough to see it.

Title
Review for Affliction (1997)
AFFLICTION ***˝ (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( wchamber@netcom.ca )
starring Nick Nolte, Sissy Spacek, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe
screenplay by Paul Schrader, based on the novel by Russell Banks
directed by Paul Schrader
     Wade: "I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe. And
some night I'm going to bite back."
     Rolfe: "Haven't you already done a bit of that?"
     Wade: "No, not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit."
Why Schrader chose to adapt Banks' disquieting literary novel
Affliction is no great mystery; its story follows an arc similar to
that of Schrader's best known works, such as his screenplays for
Scorsese's Taxi Driver and his own Hardcore. Affliction's Wade
Whitehouse, like Travis Bickle before him, is a man who fixates on
exposing corruption in place of confronting his own violent past. (In
Bickle's case, planning the assassination of a governor represses
memories of the Vietnam War, from which he was honourably discharged;
Wade has been afflicted for years by his father Glen's wickedness.)
Wade (Nolte) is a barren New Hampshire town's resident policeman and
snowplow operator. His personal life is a shambles: his ex-wife hates
him; his only child, a daughter named Jill (Brigid Tierney), has
little love left for him; his boss, Gordon LaRiviere (Holmes Osborne),
considers him expendable; and his current girlfriend, the humourously
named Margie Fogg (Spacek), is reluctant to become his fiancee. When
he sees a chance to play hero, by detecting the murderous motives
behind a hunting accident (in which Evan Twombley (Sean McCann), a
union leader about to testify against organized crime bosses, was
killed), he takes it.
Wade has a persistant toothache, which serves as a physical
manifestation of his grief. Bad memories, like his mouthsore,
occasionally prevent him from functioning normally. Glen, much to
Wade's chagrin, is still alive, and still prone to berating his
children and binge drinking. Wade obsesses over the Twombley case; if
he solves it, it might boost his self-esteem. The investigation also
provides him with an outlet for his rage; familial loyalty prevents
him from directing it at the people who truly deserve it.
In that respect, Wade is awfully reminiscent of another Banks'
antihero, "The Sweet Hereafter"'s ambulance chasing Stephens, who
spent weeks seducing a town into believing a fatal school bus accident
could be avenged to avoid confronting the news that his runaway
teenaged daughter tested HIV positive. Wade is a more compelling 
character, cinematically, than Stephens, because Schrader paints a
picture of Wade's world before diving into his crusade. We learn that
a night in the life of Wade Whitehouse consists of emotional tugs of
war with Jill, some pot smoking with the locals, copious amounts of
booze, a fight with the ex, and perhaps an early morning phone call to
his estranged brother, Rolfe (Dafoe), a history professor who was
smart enough to leave town at the first opportunity. Wade leads a
listless yet restrictive existence.
Nick Nolte is such a commanding screen presence; he makes even a
common toothache compelling. After a pair of dynamic performances in
Cape Fear and The Prince of Tides, Nolte frittered away his comeback
clout on I Love Trouble, Blue Chips, and other forgettable-sometimes
downright terrible-big movies. His recent Oscar nod for Affliction
signals the beginning of a new phase in his career-Nolte is finally
showing his vulnerable side and being recognized for it. Built like
Frankenstein's monster, he lurches in scenes with Coburn, revealing a
sorrow and hopelessness that appears to physically shrink him. He
deserves the award come March 21st.
Coburn, a frequent collaborator of the late, great Sam Peckinpah,
delivers his finest performance since Peckinpah's WWII drama Cross of
Iron. After two decades of jokey cameos in such films as The Muppet
Movie and Maverick (and even a how-to gambling video!), Coburn reminds
us the blood of a great actor courses through his veins. Gone are the
pearly whites and blow-dried hairdo; Glen "Pops" Whitehouse lacks
vanity. A good self-image is obviously none of Glen's concern.
Schrader strips iconic Coburn of his very Coburn-ness; Coburn's
trademark gruffness is abrasive in Affliction and not at all
endearing.
Affliction's super8 flashbacks lack sting. I dare say they aren't at
all necessary: the blankness in Wade's eyes conjures mental images
much more brutal and upsetting than anything a filmmaker can
manufacture. Thankfully, they're but a small portion of the tapestry
of anguish woven by Schrader and Banks (Schrader has quite faithfully 
translated Banks' prose); it should be warned that the film offers no
tidy resolutions to its plot threads. For some afflictions, the
filmmakers thrillingly speculate, there is no cure.

Title
Review for Shanghai Noon (2000)
SHANGHAI NOON **1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu, Xander Berkeley
screenplay by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar
directed by Tom Dey
The level of humour never rises above that of its title in Shanghai
Noon, a play-on-words that "Mad Magazine" staffers surely brainstormed
at some point, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The picture is so
juvenile it makes the 1985 western spoof Rustler's Rhapsody look
pretentious by comparison, which is a major selling point in my book,
for comedies these days tend to be cynical, scatological affairs--in
short, Porky's redux, everything but good-natured.
If its innocuousness ultimately earns Shanghai Noon the dreaded label of
"family entertainment", so be it. (Here is what I scribbled on a piece
of paper after seeing the film: "Jackie Chan's doing his thang and it
comes off as downright innovative in light of crap like Road Trip.")
The year is 1881, and Jackie Chan plays Chong Wang, one of the Imperial
Guards ordered to deliver the ransom for kidnapped Princess Pei Pei and
retrieve her from the Chinese mining camps of Carson City, Nevada. En
route in America, his uncle is killed in a train robbery that leaves
Jackie stranded and in the company of laconic cowpoke Roy O'Bannon (Owen
Wilson), the "good" thief who had no part in the homicide. I'm getting
ahead of myself: before they join forces, Jackie defeats armed Crow
warriors with his bare hands and marries into an Indian tribe.
There's fortune in Roy's eyes as Wang (whose full name sounds like John
Wayne, "a terrible cowboy name!" exclaims Roy) tells him of the 100 000
in gold coins waiting to be exchanged for the princess, and so he
volunteers to set our Jackie on course and instruct him in the way of
the West. (I won't belabour that Shanghai Noon glibly trumpets
assimilation over tradition--the movie sides with Roy as he encourages
Wang to abandon his Eastern code of ethics--but let it be duly noted.)
Soon, they have not so much hatched a plot as stumbled upon one to free
Pei Pei, leading to a whopper of a Mexican standoff in a church. (Shades
of John Woo.)
Speaking of Woo, he had the right idea when he commented in a recent
interview for "Premiere", "Some actors are good in slow motion, some
not. Some you want to see them fast, like Jackie Chan: Pow! Pow! Pow!
That's his real character. He's just like a tiger. There's no reason to
use slow motion." About the only directorial misstep first-timer Tom Dey
makes in the requisite fight scenes (the first reason to see any Jackie
Chan flick) is the occasional half-speed flourish--untrained fighters
require camera tricks to appear graceful (would Ralph Macchio have
gotten by in The Karate Kid without them?), but not Jackie Chan, Jet Li,
Bruce Lee, Sonny Chiba, etc.
As with Jackie's other English-language pictures (and the American
versions of his Hong Kong exports), the big, prop-dependent brawls could
and should be longer, though this time around their brevity might be on
account of Jackie's age and not studio ignorance. (Miramax, from what I
understand, is under the impression that we prefer car chases and big
stunts to martial arts combat--that's why they recut Operation Condor to
emphasize grandiose action over the kung fu, nearly invalidating the
presence of Jackie in the process.)
Otherwise, Dey has crafted a tasty matinee snack; if Shanghai Noon
doesn't have any lasting impact, it won't cause indigestion, either. The
amusingly anachronistic and nonconfrontational screenplay--the film owes
great debts to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Blazing
Saddles--occasionally goes slack (as to be expected from the writers of
the meandering Lethal Weapon 4), but Dey and his cannily cast performers
always find their footing. Owen Wilson, possessed of a warm, soothing
drawl, is the most charmingly goofball he's been since debuting in
Bottle Rocket. Nimble Jackie seems much more at ease with him than he
was with abrasive Chris Tucker in the excremental Rush Hour. And Lucy
Liu, as the prototypical Jackie Chan heroine/damsel in distress, is
adequately regal and sexy. Okay, fine, really sexy.

Title
Review for Spawn (1997)
starring John Leguizamo, Michael Jai White, Martin Sheen, D.B. Sweeney
screenplay by Alan McElroy, based on Todd McFarlane's comic books
directed by Mark A.Z. Dippe
The makers of Spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this
summer's other comic book adaptation, Batman and
Robin. Both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only
the
look of their graphic counterparts, but also their monosyllabic
dialogue and empty-headed
character motivations. In panel-sized morsels, implausible plots and
"Rambo"-esque
dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork, but on thirty foot
silver screens, it's
much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty
pictures.
Spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named Simmons (White) who is
framed
by a corporate baddie (played without irony by Sheen), then set on
fire and left for dead.
Though the movie skimps on the next few plot points, here's what I
could determine: said
assassin then becomes the leader of Satan's army, under the tutelage
of a flatulating midget
named Clown (Leguizamo, grating as always). He is renamed, for reasons
unbeknownst,
Spawn, and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become
something of a
human chameleon. But when Spawn spies on a birthday party for his
child, he realizes that
he can't be the evil superdemon he's expected to be, and he sets about
avenging his
untimely death.
Typical of summer blockbusters, Spawn is an effects-laden ninety
minute rock
video. While the visions of hell are laughably crude (think the
virtual reality sequences of
The Lawnmower Man), Spawn's prehensile outfit and the action sequences
are truly something to behold. But the storytelling is completely
lacking in emotion
(Spawn longs for his wife, but they don't have a single scene together
before Simmons'
death!), conflict (who will triumph is not anybody's guess), and
believability (not that I
expected it). So many questions are left unanswered, and I'm sure they
won't be addressed
in the inevitable sequel.
While last year's The Crow: City of Angels
suffered similar problems with its narrative (which was lazy and
somewhat incoherent), it
had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power. Spawn
is
an in-your-face, screaming banshee of a film; these guys know how to
graft a comic book
onto celluloid, but they haven't the faintest idea how to make a
movie.

Title
Review for Henry Fool (1997)
HENRY FOOL *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers, wchamber@netcom.ca
(Now with TRIVIA; film, DVD, LD reviews; a section where YOU can
recommend movies;
fabric softener; and much more!
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers
New address. New attitude. Same crappy writing.)
It is often said by his fans that Hal Hartley movies are an acquired
taste. Indeed. While perhaps less dangerous
than tequila shooters or bungee-jumping, they require no less amount of
physical stamina and concentration. I felt
rewarded at the end of HENRY FOOL; this movie creeps up on you-at a slow
139 minutes, I mean creeps-and
despite the final shot's ambiguity, I left completely satisfied.
Henry Fool ("used to have an e'") arrives at garbageman Simon Grim's
house, claims the vacant basement
apartment, and almost instantly inspires Simon (Urbaniak) to take up
writing-Henry (Martin Donovan look-alike
Ryan) is an ex-convict, a once-great author who has been "exiled and
marginalized" by the publishing community
because of his criminal activity. Simon's poetry turns him into a local
sensation, as it causes mute women to sing,
high-school girls to swoon, and councilmen to rile against its
"pornographic" content. Meanwhile, Henry seduces
both Simon's dependent mother (Porter) and immature sister (Sundance
Queen Posey) with philosophical babble
(which is by turns brilliant and inane) and breathy animal lust. These
story elements result in climaxes both
inevitable and unpredictable; the teacher-student relationship formed
between Henry and Simon eventually
reverses itself.
HENRY FOOL is sprinkled with Hartley-ian flourishes: Simon drinks milk
from "Udderley's"; the big teen
hang-out is called "World of Donuts"; Simon wears his garbageman's
uniform throughout; the editing style is
decidedly elliptical... (which is key to the conclusion's said
ambiguity). The performances by the three leads are
abrasive at first, self-consciously "quirky"; the introductory scenes
are a chore. These people do grow on you
because they convey genuine passion, a belief in themselves, and because
they have long-term goals; Henry and
Simon may drink a lot of Budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner, but
they aren't pop slackers. The story is
rather classical: the tutor is a better talker than a doer, raised on
books; the timid tutee has innate talent his master
only dreams of. (Shades of film school...) The finished film is epic in
its proportions for a story so small, and the final
third does test one's patience, yet HENRY FOOL is tight, hardly
excessive in its length. How refreshing to see a
movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character. And unless I
nodded off, not a single building exploded.
This, Hartley's seventh feature, is contemplative about "the artist";
fortunately, we never get a sampling of
Simon's work, and it's a testament to the actors and the screenplay that
by the end we can surmise what sort of
thoughts would pour from these writers' pens.

Review for Wild Things (1998)
Kem Nunn and Stephen Peters must have been on something when they wrote the
script. for this thing.
It's campy, it's cheezy as cheetos, and half the time it careens from one plot
twist to another in a paint by numbers fashion. 
Oh yeah, it's almost pornographic, too.
Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) is a guidence counsellor/sailing instructor at a
high school in the ritzy Miami suburb of Blue Bay.
We begin the movie with Sam moderating a class called `senior seminar,' and
today's program features police detectives Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) and
Gloria Perez (Daphne Rubin-Vega) in a discussion of SEX CRIMES! 
That's right folks! No sooner has the word been uttered than we find Kelly Van
Ryan (Denise Richards), the rich high school slut, trying to get into Sam's
pants. 
But poor Sam doesn't (apparently) want her to, because he's already done it
with Kelly's mom (Theresa Russell) and is currently working on Mom's lawyer's
daughter (Jennifer Bini).
Ah! But what about Suzie (Neve Campbell)? Yes...Suzi, the everglades punker.
She's hanging around too from the very beginning, getting ready to pounce.
Kelly makes her move. Sam (apparently) rebuffs her. So we get the old `Refusal
of sex? Then it must be rape' ploy. Detectives Duquette and Perez are on the
case! Then Suzie says SHE was raped by Sam too!
Sam's life goes in the toilet. His girlfriend won't sleep with him any more
and her father (Robert Wagner) gets him kicked out of the yacht club.
Fortunately, our hero (?) has hired a lawyer, and in keeping with the tone of
the movie, he just has to be Bill Murray...
Murray is at his best here. Sleazy as hell and wearing a neck brace in case
insurance agents drop by, it's almost a shock to see that he's actually
competent. 
It was all a plot. Murray forces Suzy to admit she and Kerry made it all up.
The scene's a real hoot.
Then we get to the first unexpected plot twist. 
We can tell you about the first unexpected plot twist because it's in the
trailer. 
Sam was in on the whole thing, and soon he and his two erstwhile accusers are
making love on the screen right in front of you. Then we have the lesbian love
scenes, and then things get weird.
Now Detective Duquette is unhappy at being duped. He is sure that it was a
plot to get Kerry's mom's money from the lawsuit that followed the confession.
They made us promise not to tell what the surprise ending is. And yes, there
is one after about twelve more unexpected plot twists.
Then they try unsuccessfully to explain the surprise ending through flashbacks
in the middle of the closing credits. 
Nekkid high school students with large boobs!!! Now that's what we in the
business call `high art!'

Review for Pollock (2000)
POLLOCK
***1/2 (out of four)
starring Ed Harris, Marcia Gay Harden, Tom Bower, Jennifer Connelly
screenplay by Barbara Turner and Susan J. Emshwiller,
based on the book "Jackson Pollock: An American Saga" by Steven Naifeh and 
Gregory White Smith

"How do you know when you're finished making love?" -Jackson Pollock to a 
LIFE Magazine reporter on recognizing when you've completed a painting
Jackson Pollock's "making love" quote is famous, but in practically the 
same breath, he said a more constructive thing, "It's like looking at a bed 
of flowers--tear your hair out over what it means." It took him sixteen 
words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed: equate God and 
abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to 
the point of resentment by the concept. The biopic _Pollock_, actor Ed 
Harris' directorial debut, reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts 
Pollock's creations as part of the order of things, and should similarly 
disarm haters of fine art.
Arguably more than any other living actor, Harris, who also plays 
_Pollock_, embodies the archetypal Working Stiff, and his blue-collar 
demystification of Pollock's labour-intensive art, both as performer and 
director, makes for unpretentious cinema. (From what I know of Harris, he, 
like Pollock, was not born gifted or lucky; instead, a strong work ethic is 
the seed of his success.) Granted, it's possible that _Pollock_ will 
alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable "purpose" of 
Pollock's splatter series: the common thread between them is a lack of 
editorializing. The movie _Pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent 
exchanges dotted by tantrums, but the motivations are left to our own 
perceptions. And it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film, as 
illustrated by a disheartening conclusion.
_Pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle 
against personal demons (alcoholism, depression, and the general attendant 
miseries of an artist) while finding a place of subconscious expression. A 
brief introduction to Pollock's raging drunk side segues into his getting 
accosted by a fellow New York artist, Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden, 
awarded a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this brilliant portrayal), who 
works from the outside-in, pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush. 
In a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining 
studios, she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas, grilling 
him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says, "You paint 
the fucking thing," and leaves in a huff. By the time they wed, she has 
become his de facto manager; it is form marrying function and chaos 
marrying discipline, a most harmonious collision. (Krasner denies him a 
baby, indicating that it would upset the balance.)
Such a union is destined to implode, and I hope I'm not ruining the 
_Pollock_ experience by saying that it does. While it is never depicted as 
a very romantic matrimony to start--Pollock and wife channel their passions 
elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several 
years, and it comes down to Krasner suffering one of Pollock's conniptions 
too many: "You are killing me! You are killing me! You are killing me!" 
(Aside: Harris' own wife, Amy Madigan, is unrecognizable and exceptional as 
gallery diva Peggy Guggenheim.) Pollock himself moves on to dalliances with 
younger women like Ruth Klingman (the scorching Jennifer Connelly), hoping, 
one supposes, to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth.
I love Jackson Pollock's stuff and I am enamoured of Harris' _Pollock_ as 
well. It's scrappy and observant; no coincidence that its minor failings 
are the occasional invasive flourish, such as Jeff Beal's hummable but no 
less lamentable score--I can't imagine that Pollock, or anyone, would paint 
to this music, which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing 
the images. One of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re-enactment 
of Hans Namuth shooting that famous Pollock footage in East Hampton, Long 
Island; the mounting tension is almost comic, as Namuth keeps interrupting 
Pollock's process to reload his camera or take a dinner break. A more 
seasoned director might've been too arrogant to admit that not all artists 
or mediums are created equal.

I'm pooping on my own party here: THE BIG HIT lifted my spirits in a
way I didn't expect it to. Honestly, I didn't
expect it to lift my spirits at all, on the basis of the trailer (next
time, preview-copy writers, please refrain from trumpeting 'by the
creators
of Broken Arrow') and a general wariness of '90s hitman-chic: though I
sort of liked THE BIG HIT, one more movie
about loveable "cleaners" and I'll be psychotically climbing a
Hollywood water tower or two. THE BIG HIT,
despite being choice time-filler/killer, is a bit too self-aware
of--yet not clever enough in handling--its own
fashionably ironic core to be recommended.
Wahlberg stars as Melvin Smiley, ostensibly the leader of a team of
assassins who so wants to be universally
adored that he lets people walk all over him between jobs: a cohort
(Phillips), wrongfully claims Smiley's bonus pay,
and Smiley doesn't object; one of his girlfriends (Lela Rochon) is
practically extorting him to support her own illicit
affair; another girlfriend (Christina Applegate) invites her obnoxious
parents down for the weekend against his
wishes. Eventually, Smiley's insecurity makes him the target of
someone else's fix: in agreeing to look after
Phillips' kidnap victim (the adorable Chow-- mayhaps it's the private
school uniform), his own boss--the victim's
godfather--orders Smiley dead.
The script for THE BIG HIT plays as if it was written by a sixteen
year old. One hitman (Bokeem Woodbine)
explains that he only discovered masturbation in his twenties, and a
running gag has him constantly flexing and
pumping the muscles of his right arm. An old Chinese businessman has
lost his life-savings financing the most
expensive film ever made: a trashy drama written, directed by, and
starring himself, entitled, amusingly, "Taste
The Golden Spray". The shooting and fighting sequences--and everything
in between-- essentially satirize the
hokiest Hong Kong action movies, but without subtlety or focus. Asian
directors such as John Woo, Ringo Lam, et.
al, ushered an era into their homeland: rendering virtually all their
characters expendable, they rediscovered
the poetry in a gun-battle not seen since the heyday of Sam Peckinpah.
The copycats, the bubble-gum wacky killers
on the lam movies are what THE BIG HIT more closely resembles--
rather, parodies--and only one scene really
stands out as genuinely sharp: a Mexican stand-off, recently fodder
for the likes of Eastern-inspired Tarantino,
here takes place at a kosher dinner, with drunken Elliot Gould
vomiting on the killers between rounds.
Most Jackie Chan movies are crowd-pleasers precisely because they
simultaneously send- up the Martial Arts
genre yet stand out as fine examples from it. THE BIG HIT features a
few ridiculous, choppy gunfights and an
immature script to connect the scenes. Had it been either more
action-packed or intelligent, it would amount to
more than just spoofing and riffing. As it is, the performances are
engaging, and it's fast-paced enough, but a big hit
I suspect it will not be.

Review for Low Self-Esteem Girl (2000)
LOW SELF ESTEEM GIRL *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Corrina Hammond, Ted Dave, James Dawes, Rob McBeth
written and directed by Blaine Thurier
"Guys want her body. Zealots want her soul."
-Low Self Esteem Girl's honest tagline
A few minutes into Low Self Esteem Girl, I got the distinct feeling of 
watching an episode of "Candid Camera" in which the recording device 
itself, and not the participants, is the one being had. First-time director 
Blaine Thurier (a former cartoonist for Vancouver's "Terminal City") 
zigzags his digital video camera about the house of Lois (Corrina Hammond) 
as if a spy who has unwittingly stumbled upon a stage exercise: Lois and 
Gregg (Ted Dave), her one night stand, conduct a pillow-fight with 
overtones of rape, and then she offers him a beer--at which point I 
half-expected a drama teacher to step into frame and critique their 
performances.
The problem with most non-professional actors is that they're introverted, 
but Thurier loaded Low Self Esteem Girl with seasoned indie rockers, so his 
cast was used to putting on some kind of show. This inevitably leads to as 
much "Dogma 95"-posturing in front of as behind the camera. But, 
considering how many Canadian productions are devoid of such enthusiasm, 
Low Self Esteem Girl feels like a breath of fresh air. Dismissing or 
condemning the film for its source of power (i.e. obvious nods in the 
direction of Cassavetes' Faces and A Woman Under the Influence that pave 
the way for more organic improvisation and experimentation) would be 
counter-productive and unreasonably spiteful, principally because I got 
such a charge out of watching it.
The movie starts making an impact after that opening sequence. Gregg is a 
chronically late pot dealer who winds up selling Lois' address and the 
words key to seducing her to his best client, Garth (James Dawes), thereby 
discovering a cottage industry. Meanwhile, Lois enters into a "nice" 
relationship with Rob (Rob McBeth), a born-again urged by Carl (Carl 
Newman, eerily realistic until the screenplay betrays him), the leader of 
his youth group, to weave her into their denomination. In an effort to 
please everybody--she last--Lois opens her mind to Christian teachings ("So 
you have a crush on Jesus?") and continues to sleep around.
In my recent "Perspective Canada Line-Up" article, I theorized from a 
single sentence synopsis of the electric Low Self Esteem Girl that it is 
"one of those self-consciously daring, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink 
comedies young Canucks are famous for." Now, having actually experienced 
it, I find that "self-consciously daring" better describes said logline 
that was distributed to members of the press. If the suggestion that 
finding God might not be the end-all/be-all offends, well, it's always 
likely to offend.
For the film to be truly impulsive it would have to side with the 
Christians, portrayed here as passive-aggressive (emphasis on aggressive) 
liberals steeped in pop doctrine. (All the more surprising that it doesn't, 
given that Thurier and Newman once fronted a Christian alt-folk band.) In 
Carl's eagerness to hold an exorcism, Thurier reveals his roots as a comic 
strip artist, reducing the young pastor's ideals to word balloons, and Low 
Self Esteem Girl derails. Yet it never train-wrecks, thanks to the truthful 
reactions of those affected by church hostility. There's real sadness in 
Lois' conversion of faith--all she really gains in the process is a guilt 
complex, which doesn't make anyone a 'better' person per se; her pain is 
mirrored by confused Rob's eventual rebellion against organized religion 
through hard partying.
I characterized Low Self Esteem Girl to a friend as "depressing comedy," in 
that we laugh on the outside and cringe on the inside. In a good, 
thought-provoking way, I might add. (I'm thinking back to how easily two of 
its Christian characters caved into temptation--young people need to be 
hedonists.) More often than not, the film smacks of life and reflection; 
Thurier observes the fringe suburban streets, where the jobless 
twentysomethings partake in a junkie-chic sense of community, astutely. 
(Believe me: all of my friends reside in such a place.) Rarely does 
Canadian cinema sanction this much apperception and empathy, or come in for 
as many close-ups as Thurier does! The home video aesthetic somehow endears 
it even further, like a spunky class project, although I anxiously await 
the renaissance of the tripod. (--- For more first-run, DVD, and

Title
Review for Starship Troopers (1997)
starring Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Michael Ironside, Denise
Richards
screenplay by Edward Neumeier, based on Robert A. Heinlein's novel
directed by Paul Verhoeven
(If you like this review, and you must have more, visit
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504
It's getting better.)
Guilt. Guilt is something I felt while watching Basic Instinct for the
ninth time; the penultimate T & A thriller, Basic Instinct made my
last few teenage years worth living. But I know so well that it's a
terrible film, made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt.
Verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive Showgirls and, on
November seventh, 1997, unleashed Starship Troopers to innocent
moviegoers like me, who cannot control the urge to see giant bug
movies.
The pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year. A
simple, white on black title card reads "Starship Troopers"-my friends
and I speculated that the night before the prints were shipped,
Verhoeven realized he forgot the credits. Is this how a hundred
million dollar movie should open?
Were the rest of the film that subdued... Starship Troopers is about a
group of white, blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have Spanish
last names. They graduate high school, join the military, and then,
rather curiously, decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all
lifeforms on that planet. The story is so incomprehensible, and told
so bombastically, it's akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming
punishments at you in a foreign tongue. (Aside, club lovers will be
happy to know that dance music hasn't changed in the future.)
One plus: Starship Troopers contains some very funny sequences,
specifically the newsreels of the future. Hysterically funny,
actually. But the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to
whether Verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between. The
storytelling lacks focus, to say the least.
The politics of the film are scary. The actions of the major female
characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos. There's even
a creepy sex scene: the lovely Dina Meyer makes out, nude, with the
sickening Van Dien while half her face is covered by her opaque
sweater, just the way he seems to like it. I use the term sickening
because Van Dien is the least appealing actor I've encountered in a
big budget picture; all chiseled features and machismo, he even barks
a eulogy at a funeral like military orders. Of course, Verhoeven's
probably the one to blame, and perhaps I'm jealous because I'm so
disgusting.
At any rate, a movie called Starship Troopers shouldn't be about sex.
Exactly ten years ago, Verhoeven made Robocop, which was about nothing
but skillfully made and oddly moving. And R-rated, despite its goofy
premise. Maybe it's asking too much for Verhoeven to make a PG-movie,
then-he's a master of insipid violence. However, ten year old boys
would adore Starship Troopers if they could see it.

Title
Review for Bride of Chucky (1998)
BRIDE OF CHUCKY **1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers' Id (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(Visit my review archive, play some movie trivia, and more!
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/ )
Revoke my critic's license; sentence me to a public hanging. Both
suitable punishments for what I'm about to write: BRIDE OF CHUCKY is a
fun, fun movie. Whether it's any good is another issue altogether, but
like another of this year's sequels-that-nobody-asked-for, Halloween:
H20 Twenty Years Later, BRIDE OF CHUCKY is bearable and even enjoyable.
Tilly stars as Meg (though not billed separately, Tilly's breasts steal
her every scene), ex-lover to Charles Lee Ray, the serial killer whose
soul inhabits "Chucky" the Good Guy doll. For three movies now, Chucky
has terrorized unsuspecting white folk. In this fourth Child's Play, Meg
steals a mangled Chucky from a police impound (which houses, among other
horror memorabilia, Jason's mask and Leatherface's chainsaw), sews him
back up, and revives his evil spirit with the assistance of a guidebook
called "Voodoo for Dummies". Their first victim: a goth punk wannabe
(hilarious Alexis Arquette of The Wedding Singer) who ends up suffocated
during a menage a trois with Chucky and Meg. But after domestic
squabbles ensue, Chucky electrocutes Meg in a bathtub-and her spirit
possesses a female doll called Tiffany. United as toys, Chucky
and Tiffany enlist the help of ignorant next door neighbour Jesse
(Stabile) to retrieve an amulet that will enable them to transfer their
souls back into a human being. So Jesse and his runaway fiancee, Jade
(Heigl, whose breasts also deserve special mention), naively transport
the multiple-murderer dolls across America, leaving a trail of bodies
behind.
As horror icons go, Chucky is one of the most absurd. His pint size and
minimal strength prevent him from doing much damage without the
assistance of a whole person. Yet in BRIDE OF CHUCKY, he (along with
Tiffany) manages to shoot a quiver of nails into corrupt police chief
John Ritter's face (after this and his turn as a psychotic android on
"Buffy The Vampire Slayer", Ritter has proved he can play a heavy), blow
up a car, and impale a pair of newleyweds with a thousand shards of
glass. After the lame, tame Urband Legend and I Know What You Did Last
Summer (why both those movies were given an "R" rating remains a mystery
to me), BRIDE OF CHUCKY's tasteless, repulsive and extreme violence is a
breath of fresh air. Chucky's a nihilist-he and Tiffany decide to off
one key character just because they haven't killed someone in a while!
Dourif's excellent voicework is the most lively and memorable
performance he (has repeatedly given) since becoming American cinema's
resident wacko. (After winning an Oscar for his portrayal of tragic
Billy Bibbit in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Dourif took to playing
human monsters in such films as The Exorcist III and Body Parts.) His
Beavis-esque vocal stylings are matched by Kevin Yagher's special
effects: the puppeteering of Chucky and his bride is flawless-very
little of it looks computer-assisted.
If BRIDE OF CHUCKY fails to entertain on one level, it's in the
alliterate characters Jesse and Jade. Both are unaware of Chucky and
Tiffany's evil: they take turns accusing each other of a secret and
insatiable appetite for homicide. The trouble is, this young couple is
excruciatingly dull (although I suppose it's difficult not to be
upstaged by Chucky and Tiffany). And don't bother going for the
scares-there aren't any. The fright factor is nil, but the laugh
quotient is high; not since Peter Jackson's Meet The Feebles have
devilish (and, I should add, carnal) dolls been this guiltily enjoyable
to watch.

Title
Review for Psycho (1998)
Were Alfred Hitchcock alive today, he probably wouldn't give half the
damn that Psycho 1998's detractors do-I'll bet that he would simply wish
Van Sant "good luck" and turn the other cheek. In fact, the new film is
unlikely to continue to drum up controversy; my guess is that within
weeks it will have all but vanished from cinemas and moviegoers' memory
banks, mostly because Van Sant has given a sixties movie a modern spin,
yet succeeded in taking the edge off the original.
Must I recount the tale of Norman Bates and his mum? Phoenix, Arizona
receptionist Marion Crane (Heche) steals a bunch of money ($400 000 this
time around) from her real estate company, with the intention of running
off with her lover, Sam Loomis (Mortensen). She stops at the Bates Motel
for a good night's sleep along the way to California, where she shares
sandwiches, milk, and stitled conversation with the taxidermist owner,
Norman Bates (Vaughan), a mama's boy if there ever was one. Later,
Marion is murdered in the shower by Mrs. Bates; her body, her car, and
her personal belongings-including the loot-are disposed of in a nearby
swamp by fearful Norman. An investigation ensues: Detective Arbogast
(William H. Macy), and amateur sleuths Loomis and Lila (Moore), Marion's
sister, attempt to uncover the truth behind Marion's disappearance.
Van Sant's version is basically a recreation of the original, with the
exception of a few wrongheaded additions (do we really need those added
flashcuts of storm clouds and human atrocities during the murder
sequences?). What struck me most about Psycho 1998 was how the
replicated pacing-a perfect tempo for the original-seemed too damn
sluggish for today's viewers: audience members were dropping off to
sleep all around me. (Perhaps that does defend Van Sant's MTV-style
killings, after all.) Psycho's screenplay remains brilliant-the stolen
money having no ultimate significance to the story was of course
Hitchcock's greatest red herring, but Heche is not nearly the big star
Janet Leigh was in 1960: even virgins to the tale will not be fazed by
her demise halfway through the film, as she's just one member of a cast
of solid but not popular actors. The current shower scene lacks its
predecessor's sense of pulp, mischief and kink. (Aside: for whatever
reason, the psycho-babble epilogue is more palpable this time around.
Another aside: Danny Elfman's reorchestration of Bernard Hermann's score
sounds great in digital sound.)
How are the performances? Occasionally, the dated dialogue sounds a
little silly coming out of their mouths. (If Van Sant went so far as to
update Hitch's vision by shooting in colour, why not extensively revise
the script, too?) The most successful at reinventing his role is Macy as
Arbogast, whose previous work with David Mamet positively affects his
delivery-whenever Macy is on screen, it's impossible to turn your head.
Heche, Mortensen, and Moore are just fine, but they seem to be dying to
improvise and ad-lib. The movie is such a rigid remake it barely allows
them breathing space.
With only a few puckers of his bee-stung lips and the occasional
narrowing of his fashion model eyes, Vaughan comes off as much more
sinister (not to mention physically imposing) than Anthony Perkins'
Bates-ultimately, Vaughan fails to convince us his psychotic behaviour
isn't premeditated. An impish Van Sant can be glimpsed through the
window of the real estate office in scene two, and I couldn't help but
think he should've played the title character: he bares a resemblance to
Perkins and obviously has a deeper affinity for the material than
Vaughan.
Ultimately, what disappointed me most about this Psycho was its
softness. Why is Marion lolling around in bed with her naked lover
wearing a bra and panties? Why the use of such obvious visual metaphors
as storm clouds? Is this same director responsible for Drugstore Cowboy
and the envelope-pushing My Own Private Idaho? I can't help but think of
the moment in Psycho 1998 when Moore is startled by her own reflection
on a giant mirror. It's as if Van Sant was too busy looking at
Hitchcock's movie and too frightened to explore the truly personal
aspects of the yarn, rendering this recreation functional but pointless.

Title
Review for Fast, Cheap & Out of Control (1997)
FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL ** (out of four)
documentary, directed by Errol Morris
Considered a leading documentarian, Morris's fifth non-fiction feature
is filled with rich characters and a unique-ness that we've come to
expect from the director of films as diverse as The Thin Blue Line and
Vernon, Florida.
In Fast, Cheap... Morris links the stories of a lion tamer, a topiary
gardener, a naked mole- rat expert, and a scientist who invents
robots. Each of these people is very interesting, particularly the
lion tamer, who is revealed to have an obsession for B-movie star and
circus performer Clyde Beatty. Clips of Mr. Beatty's films, dispersed
liberally throughout, are hysterically, Ed Wood-funny. But over the
course of 82 minutes, Morris barely lets any of them speak. Instead we
get endless montages, footage which visually equates each
interviewee's occupation. While most of said footage is beautifully
shot, by Oliver Stone's DP Robert Richardson, it's all very
self-indulgent and blunt. Morris insists on spelling out his ideas, as
if he doesn't trust his own (admittedly wobbly) hypotheses. The music,
by Caleb Sampson, doesn't help matters: all tinker-y piano and goofy
orchestrations, it would better accompany a Keystone Cops movie.
The title refers to a quote from the scientist, from a scene in which
he envisions hundreds of small robots roaming the surface of planets
instead of one lumbering explorer like the Mars probe.
The title more aptly refers to the picture itself, obviously not a
good thing.

Title
Review for Pecker (1998)
starring Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, Lili Taylor, Brendan Sexton
III
written and directed by John Waters
I wish so badly I could call myself a John Waters fan. His brand of
outrageousness is gleefully offensive and wholly sincere; Waters'
gross-out tendencies are his second-nature. It is his emotional
detachment, rather than his penchant for the perverse, that turns me
off. PECKER starts out promising, and it is a warm-hearted movie, I
suppose, but ultimately Waters goes through his standard
motions-suburbia as sideshow. 
T2's Furlong stars as Pecker, nicknamed so because he eats like a
bird. He is an obsessive photographer, snapping anything that falls
before his lens. His girlfriend, Shelly (Ricci), is a bitter
laundromat manager; his big sister (Martha Plimpton) works at a gay
strip bar; his best bud (Sexton) is a professional shop lifter; his
grandmother (Jean Schertler) does a Charlie McCarthy routine with a
Virgin Mary puppet; his little sister is addicted to sugar (as
Chrissy, Lauren Hulsey thieves every scene she's in); and so on. They
are all his subjects; when one of his exhibits is observed in a
Baltimore sandwich shop by Rorey (Taylor), a traveling New York art
dealer, Pecker and co. pack it up and head for the big city, where
they cause quite a stir. Rorey is allured by Pecker's naivete,
lavishes him with money and gifts. The impact is negative: the people
of his hometown begin to resent Pecker's success. 
Scenes of Pecker taking pictures with his beaten up camera are
inspiring and amusing. (His work is terrific.) The trouble is, that's
all there is to Pecker: he is a shutter-happy machine. While Furlong
is likable in the role, his character is never anything more than a
nice guy with an awe-shucks demeanor that contradicts his
surroundings. As well, the culture clash between the Manhattanites and
the 'Baltimore Hillbillies' that transpires is disappointingly
obvious. Waters has given the film a more realistic look than some of
his beach movie-coloured fantasies of the past, which is why some
scenes-like a surrealistic advertisement for Ritalin-induce more
discomfort than laughs: they feel out of place and laboured. Yet I was
never less than entertained by PECKER--the cast looks like it's having
a ball--and it's sure to start THE new term: teabagging. (I'll let
your imagination run wild.) Fine Line Pictures, which is releasing the
film, certainly agrees: after the press screening, they passed out
teabags inscribed with the "Pecker" logo. 
In this scatalogically-desensitized landscape, the most shocking thing
Waters could do these days is make a movie without any repulsive
jokes. Like Pecker, perhaps he should take a more observational
approach: in 1998, reality is much weirder than his blatant cinematic
universe. 

Title
Review for Sixth Sense, The (1999)
THE SIXTH SENSE *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (6sense@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia
Williams
written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan
You've seen this moment before, recently: a particularly troubled
character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room
temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing. The difference is
that when it happens to Lili Taylor's Nell in The Haunting, we don't
care. The hero of The Sixth Sense, a young boy named Cole, is a rich
creation, and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him
to take a hike.
The seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child
psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Willis) in the comfort of his own bedroom.
Desperate to get his career back on track, even at the expense of his
crumbling marriage (to Williams, of Rushmore), Malcolm councils the
deeply troubled Cole (Osment). The preteen displays all the quirks of
Malcolm's would-be killer: scars on his body; antisocial behaviour;
and the reluctance to reveal a big secret. Only after Cole is locked
in a closet by some bullies (and hospitalized as a result) does he
divulge to Malcolm, in a spine-tingling scene, that he sees dead
people walking among us, all the time.
Malcolm assumes, and given his profession, reasonably so, that Cole is
schizophrenic, not psychic, but the sincerity in Cole's anguished
confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures. He will
instead pursue the supernatural angle, becoming a kind of surrogate
father to Cole (who lives with his single mother, Lynn (Collette)) in
the process.
The Sixth Sense has more in common with Ghost than Poltergeist.
(Though Shyamalan does, somewhat unforgiveably, crib the
self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter.) It's far more
heartwarming than frightening, and the film would be none the worse
for wear without its few pulp shocks. Cole attracts the dead for
reasons unknown, but they're not out to harm him, really-they just
want to be heard, even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the
innocent gradeschooler. Perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to
us, at first, than they really are because we're looking at the
situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old.
That's right: Willis, for the first time in years, gives up the
spotlight to his costar. We appreciate Malcolm's domestic dilemma, but
we identify with Cole, recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the
closet monster or the thing under the bed. Both actors deliver
immensely likable performances, and their dynamic is manifest. Willis
convinces us that he's a doctor, something he was unable to do as a
horndog shrink in the overheated Color of Night. Osment is phenomenal,
a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child
stars with too much experience in television commercials do.
The Sixth Sense (atmospherically shot by The Silence of the Lambs'
cinematographer, Tak Fujimoto) is actually a drama-its spooky,
effective ad campaign is misleading. Only because I was expecting
something different did I notice-rather, feel-the movie's running
time, which is just shy of two hours. The story unfurls slowly but
engrossingly; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait. I'm
not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof, but I admired its
audacity.

Title
Review for Apt Pupil (1998)
APT PUPIL  *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(Visit my review archive, play some movie trivia, and more!
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/ )
starring Brad Renfro, Ian McKellan, Elias Koteas, David Schwimmer
screenplay by Brandon Boyce, based on the novella by Stephen King
directed by Bryan Singer
"No man is an island," one character quotes John Donne in APT PUPIL,
effectively summarizing the movie's themes. While hardly a great film,
Singer's ambitious adaptation of King's short story* is challenging
nonetheless; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement
psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it. APT PUPIL
is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses.
1984. Wonder-bred high school honours student Todd Bowden (Renfro)
conducts his own extracurricular investigation of Kurt Dussander, a Nazi
war criminal who fearfully fled Berlin in the 1960s and was never heard
from again. Bowden suspects Arthur Denker (McKellan), the lonely German
senior citizen who lives nearby, is actually a pseudonymous
Dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young Todd's
theory. Bowden strikes a deal with Dussander: in exchange for not
revealing his identity, Dussander must satisfy Bowden's intense
curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the Nazi
point of view. The stories he hears keep Todd up at night and haunt his
daydreams, but like a bystander at a traffic accident, Todd's desire for
gory details overrides his repulsion.
Bowden revives in Dussander feelings dormant since the end of WWII.
Marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for
Dussander: it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his
"student", among other things. Bowden, who has taken on very hateful
qualities (he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook),
engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship. Dussander
stands to lose his freedom, and Bowden his credibility-in effect, his
post-secondary school future. All of this winds down to a fairly
unpredictable (and unsettling) conclusion, one which requires leaps of
faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source
material's excessive climax.
Singer has yet to get Keyser Söze out of his system. His The Usual
Suspects and APT PUPIL are both about evil masquerading as innocence
(Verbal's tics and Todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses);
they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is
not an option if they are to achieve their goals. APT PUPIL is a richer
film than The Usual Suspects, a movie famous and popular partly because
its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way
you could see the ending coming, as it was all a hoodwink, anyway.
Thankfully, Singer has gotten most of The Usual Suspects' film-schoolish
geek theatrics out of his system. Some scenes in APT PUPIL feel
overdirected and/or obvious (the dream sequences were extraneous), but
the majority of the film is subdued-and Singer's handling of the violent
scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a
murderer-in-training. McKellan's and Renfro's performances contribute
enormously to the overall  success of the film; while most people will
focus on British stage vet McKellan's finely-tuned realization, I'd like
to single out Renfro's daring work. He isn't afraid to play someone
largely unappealing and cold-hearted; he strips his character of vanity,
something many of his peers wouldn't do. (Can you picture Kieran Culkin
or Jonathan Taylor-Thomas in the same role?) Renfro was recently charged
with possession of cocaine-I hope he doesn't continue down that path,
because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him.
As guidance counsellor Edward French, "Friend" Schwimmer also deserves
mention. He wants to be the parent to Todd that Todd's own well-to-do
folks are not (Todd, like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and
dad wrapped around his pinky finger), and his sincerity makes the apt
pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent. But one of the film's
ultimate questions, are we born evil or do we learn evil?, might be
answered in French, whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous. No
man is an island, indeed-we all have the capacity to make the "right" or
the "wrong" choices. Schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of
fascinating characters who make the unconventional APT PUPIL laudible.
     *The excellent collection King's stories called Different Seasons
spawned not only Apt Pupil, but The Shawshank Redemption (originally
titled Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption) and Stand By Me
(originally titled The Body).

Review for Godzilla (1998)
GODZILLA (1998) ZERO STARS (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(Ugh. This is becoming so routine... Just visit my damn website, FILM
FREAK CENTRAL.
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504
Send me some hate mail, recommend a movie, read the journals...just
have as good a time as you can there.)
starring Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria, Maria Pitillo, Godzilla
screenplay by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich
directed by Roland Emmerich
The team of Emmerich and Devlin scored a giant b.o. hit last time out
with their alien picture, Independence Day.  That film was critically
dissed largely because of their use of stereotyping and clichees to
define an ensemble of characters: we knew who the smart guy was
because he wore glasses and a pocket-protector; who the gay guy was
because he ran around squealing like a panzie for his mother; who the
hero was because he promised to "whoop E.T.'s ass". This time out,
Devlin and Emmerich have solved the problem by making no attempts
whatsoever to define their ensemble of characters. Not only is New
York City a shambles when Godzilla is through with it, so is the film,
a disaster-picture in every sense of the word. This may be the most
uncompelling summer movie contender in the history of the sport.
I'm going to give away the plot of this movie with relish, for all the
security surrounding this non-story before the May 20th release was
non-sensical, to say the least. To say the most, it was merely an
attempt to keep the publicity machine well-oiled: on-screen sponsor
Fruit-of-the-Loom is entangled in a breach of contract lawsuit after
revealing early sketches of Godzilla on the Internet. How about suing
Steven Spielberg for revealing the new monster's design in his
Jurassic Park films? For Godzilla, like the movie itself, is a most
derivative creation.
The movie begins with Broderick driving out into an open field at
Chernobyl to examine some mutated earthworms.  Then a helicopter
inexplicably lands before him, and stiffs in suits exit the chopper
and announce to him that his years of earthworm research have ended:
he has been reassigned to investigate giant footprints. Broderick
deduces that the footprints belong to a Polynesian lizard that has
grown to an enormous size because of "years of French Polynesia
nuclear testing". His hypotheses - which also include that the beast
is the first of its kind, and that it is pregnant (he deduces that one
with the aid of an over-the-counter home pregnancy kit) - eventually
prove accurate.  For reasons never explained, asexual Godzilla wishes
to lay his eggs in "The City That Never Sleeps" (that's how New
York City is billed!). So he does, in Madison Square Gardens, but only
after crushing a lot of taxi cabs - NO MENTION OF HUMAN CASUALTIES IS
MADE. So Broderick, his stupid ex-girlfriend (Pitillo), a
French-Polynesian top secret agent guy (Reno--the most enjoyable human
presence here), and a ballsy cameraman (Azaria) team up to get trapped
in Madison Square Gardens.
The filmmakers' idea of genuine comic relief is to name the mayor
Ebert (rotund Michael Lerner) and have his advisor, Gene (haha),
always slap Ebert's hand away from food. Oh, look, a fat guy wants
food. The filmmakers' idea of a plot development is to have said
stupid girlfriend - who is also an aspiring anchor beauty - discover a
top secret videotape with footage of a frightened Japanese man
repeating "Gojira...Gojira..." She knows this is a top secret tape
because it is labeled such, "Top Secret", and she seems to know how
bottom-of-the-barrel her news program is because they take the bait
and air the snippet as a top story. Then Ebert wants more food! Said
broadcast winds up getting Broderick fired, so he and Pitillo have a
fight, and break up again. Who cares? Until the night before, they
hadn't seen each other for EIGHT YEARS. And when they met up again, it
was only to EXCHANGE THE WORST WRITTEN EX-LOVER TO EX-LOVER DIALOGUE
THE SCREEN HAS POSSIBLY EVER KNOWN. To quote Ebert - the critic, not
the mayor (by the way, during the two times I met the man, he was not
eating) - in his review of North, I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate this
movie. GODZILLA is an entirely charmless 139 MINUTES(!), unlike the
Japanese counterparts which inspired it. Boring as hell, seemingly
edited with a machete and some Scotch tape, weighted by a screenplay
that makes Titanic's read like Edward Albee, GODZILLA is the worst
cinematic experience I've had in years. Flamers, take note: I am not
demanding hyperrealism from a movie about a giant lizard, nor am I
requesting good dialogue, even. I'm asking for entertainment, pure and
simple: for the reported $130 million budget, I want to mainline
unadulterated summer movie fun. Not even the effects held my interest
- they turn to digital mush in too many spots.
If this is reading a little too much like one of Harry Knowles'
Ain't-It-Cool caveman test-screening reviews, my apologies. It isn't
too often a movie sparks a fire in me like GODZILLA, a steady, burning
rage. Independence Day was a terrible movie, but terribly
fun. GODZILLA's cinematogrpohy and production design can't even match
the pastel appeal of ID4's images: almost every shot is a rain-soaked
bore. (Ladies and gentlemen, let's officially seal that moratorium on
homages to Blade Runner.) Perhaps I can't fully convey why I despised
this movie so much without slipping into incoherence, but it looks
like I may not be alone in my camp: despite months of hype, the
weekend late show of GODZILLA at a brand new multiplex saw an audience
of half-capacity. If we're lucky, Godzilla's damage won't end at the
credits: it will put an end to bloated, scriptless event pictures for
a good long while.

Review for Spice World (1997)
{Visit my updated website with new, silly graphics and a revised
guestbook: now you can recommend movies to me or the casual surfer via
this "Can't Miss" section. All's fun and badly written at FILM FREAK
CENTRAL:}
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504
starring Mel B., Mel C., Emma, Geri, Victoria, Richard E. Grant
written by Kim Fuller directed by Bob Spiers
Spice World is critic-proof. What kind of person would read a review
for this film before going to see it? The young, teenaged girls in
attendance on Friday afternoon certainly weren't concerned with
Ebert's assessment (he already declared it the worst film of
1998). Let's boil it down: if you like the Spice Girls, you will see
the movie. If you don't like the Spice Girls, you will not see the
movie. If there are such people out there heming and hawing over
whether or not to see this flick, read on.
The Spices, alternately known as Scary, Sporty, Baby, Ginger, and
Posh, respectively, are at the peak of their fame: the papers can't
get enough of them, the fans follow them through the streets, and
there isn't a day off in sight. It is because of this that the
backlash begins, and it's up to harried manager Grant to ward off bad
press, with assistance from a double-talking, animal loving mystery
man at the top (hilariously played by Roger Moore, relishing the
chance to mock Blofeld, James Bond's greatest villain). Meanwhile, two
Hollywood producers (played by George Wendt and Mark McKinney) are
keen to plug the girls into a big-budget movie.
The film unfolds over a one-week period in the girls' lives, during
which they also encounter aliens, a haunted house, and a tour bus
wired to explode. Director Bob Spiers, who helmed every hilarious
episode of the BBC's "French & Saunders", has a considerably less
talented main cast to work with here (let's say the Spice Girls do not
possess crack comic timing), and his attempt to fill out the remaining
roles with old pros is only somewhat successful, due to Fuller's
juvenile screenplay. But when things turn surreal--a downpour in an
office, the alien encounter--Spiers is just the man for the job, and
without him the movie could have been entirely witless. And the girls
are at least likeable, although they're better taken in small doses. I
felt after this film spoiled on too much dime-candy.
Spice World ultimately could use more edge. The Spice Girls' image has
been softened over time--when they first appeared, for instance, they
were frank and unsparing in their sex talk--and the movie
complies. While the filmmakers do poke fun at them, it is with a
gloved finger. There is nothing biting about this mockumentary (if one
can call it that); if it were a Spice World, after all, the world
would be very bland indeed.

Review for Music of the Heart (1999)
MUSIC OF THE HEART ** (out of four) 
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Meryl Streep, Angela Bassett, Aidan Quinn, Jane Leeves
screenplay by Pamela Gray
directed by Wes Craven
I must preface this review by admitting how much I despise the title
Music of the Heart-NASA's Think Tank couldn't come up with something
more generic. Wes Craven's new pic was more provocatively (and
appropriately) called 50 Violins in development, and the switch only
proves how far distributor Miramax has strayed from its edgy roots.
Almost as infuriating is the positioning of an 'N Sync/Gloria Estafan
duet as Music of the Heart's theme song-this unlistenable ballad opens
and closes a film about music appreciation. 
Faithfully based on the Oscar-nominated documentary Small Wonders,
Music of the Heart stars Streep as Roberta Guaspari, a divorced mother
of two sons who develops, at the urging of Brian, a man she met in
high school (Quinn), a music program for Harlem gradeschoolers. The
reception from staff, students, and parents of students is cool at
first (racial issues, for the most part), but Roberta's dedication
eventually wins over all three parties. 
The story shares not only its basic outline with Mr. Holland's Opus
but also an extremely frustrating "# Years Later" title card that
weakly compacts Roberta's experiences as an educator. (Are both movies
telling us that the life of a teacher is so repetitive that the
intervening years between getting hired and retiring are a write-off?)
I preferred what Craven had going in its first half: the moralizing
was kept to a minimum, the narrative took unexpected turns (who could
anticipate the outcome of Roberta's romance with Brian?), and
Roberta's militaristic conduct in the classroom provided a refreshing
take on the To Sir, With Love standard-no affable Mr. Holland is she. 
Unintentional humour, soapboxing, and slack direction mar Music of the
Heart's second half. When a few of Roberta's graduates return to strut
their stuff for the new batch of students, they are conveniently the
children we met earlier all grown up. When the horror of urban life in
the nineties hits Roberta, the sequence plays like one from a moldy
"ABC Afterschool Special". More gravely, this plot point and many
others are not satisfactorily paid off. Take, for example, the story
thread regarding Roberta's oldest son, Nick (played Michael Angarano
at 7 and Charlie Hofheimer at 17), who is almost expelled for a spate
of wild behaviour (emphasized in cheesy, choppy slow motion). One
heart-to-heart with Roberta later and he's a cherubic goodie-goodie
again. The primary grades are tough on a kid, especially in inner
cities-how were his problems resolved outside the home? (Young Nick
did, after all, almost murder another little boy.) 
Craven's biggest blunder is to build audience anticipation for a
rendez-vous between real-life master violinist Isaac Stern and the
small wonders. Roberta's funding is cut, so she opts to organize
(after she, Principal Williams (Bassett), a journalist (Leeves), and
what seems like everybody else in town have sat around in Roberta's
enormous living room the same way the Muppets do tossing out
harebrained ideas) a benefit concert, the venue for which hinges on
Stern's input. His name is also mentioned in virtually every scene
leading up to the climax, yet his cameo amounts to one shot. Blink and
you'll miss him. I wanted a moment in which the physically disabled
Isaac introduces himself to the girl who also can't stand up when she
plays her instrument, even if it didn't actually happen-Gray's
screenplay is, oddly, not formulaic enough.
You'll notice that up to this point I have neglected to discuss Wes "A
Nightmare on Elm Street" Craven's filmmaking background. I didn't feel
it necessary until moments ago I had an epiphany: timing is everything
in horror movies and comedies-there's little in Music of the Heart, a
light drama, that exercises Craven's well-honed editing skills, save
for a few genuinely amusing takes from Josh Pais as Roberta's teaching
rival, Dennis. That said, Craven just turned sixty, and I fully
sympathize with his desire to leave fright flicks. After two excellent
Scream pictures and a handful of other creepy classics, he's eligible
for retirement from the genre, but he does seem a little lost without
a reason to scare us.

Title
Review for Horse Whisperer, The (1998)
THE HORSE WHISPERER ***1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers, wchamber@netcom.ca
(Now with TRIVIA; film, DVD, LD reviews; a section where YOU can
recommend movies;
fabric softener; and much more!
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers
New address. New attitude. Same crappy writing.)
After Indecent Proposal and Up Close and Personal, Redford was wise to
direct himself in a picture at last. Redford
may look great on-screen, but over the past few years, he's proven
himself a bigger talent behind the camera.
Ordinary People is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties, and
it was the first picture he helmed. While The
Milagro Beanfield War was only occasionally successful at combining
magic-realism with...um, realism, and I've
never been much of a fan of A River Runs Through It (to the chagrin of
many), Quiz Show was dazzling, energetic
and convincing. THE HORSE WHISPERER represents both his directorial
return to nature films and the first time
in that sub-genre Redford seems equally concerned with humans and
scenery.
Scott-Thomas plays Annie MacLean, an uptight but respected New York
magazine editor whose daughter Grace
(Johanssen) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride
climaxes with their horses colliding with a
semi. Grace's horse survived, but barely, and has gone mad. Annie
refuses to put the animal out of his misery,
believing that if the horse heals it will mend Grace's newly-broken
spirit. Eventually, mother and daughter travel
alone to Montana to be with Tom Booker (Redford), a famed "horse
whisperer" who has a gift of calming horses
with simple looks and touches, leaving busy husband Neill behind.
Eventually, they move onto the Booker ranch
with the rest of Tom's family, and Annie finds herself falling in love
with all things Montana, including, naturally,
Tom, the wise and lonely trainer.
THE HORSE WHISPERER is delicately made. I dare say lyrical, since to
many people's ear, that word is
synonymous with boring. Hardly. THE HORSE WHISPERER has little to offer
in the way of surprise, but it does
have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch,
especially in the final third of the
story. Scott-Thomas and Johanssen seem like mother and daughter, and you
have no doubt believing that the
mountain vistas would put these New Yorkers under a spell, especially
since d.p. Robert Richardson's photography
casts Montana as Heaven on Earth. (A gimmicky but effective technique
the filmmakers employ is a switch in
aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location
shifts from New York to Montana.) The
underrated Sam Neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt, emotive
performance as the nice-guy husband, who is as
authoritive and likeable as Tom. He is indeed a refreshing change from
the sexist, lout of a husband so many
writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating
spouse's motivation. Unfortunately, one of THE
HORSE WHISPERER's only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers
Scott-Thomas and Redford. I liked
both of them, but I didn't necessarily believe that Redford would fall
for such a cold fish, even if the countryside air
thawed her slightly. Luckily (and curiously), this is such a rich and
textured movie that it doesn't quite matter-their adultery
seems like an afterthought, the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of
the characters' complex relationships together.

Title
Review for What Planet Are You From? (2000)
starring Garry Shandling, Annette Bening, John Goodman, Ben Kingsley
screenplay by Garry Shandling, Michael Leeson, Ed Solomon, Peter Tolan
directed by Mike Nichols
To paint a picture of how immature Mike Nichols' What Planet Are You
From? can get, its McGuffin is a vibrating penis. The film stoops,
often, to a level of humour rarely used outside the schoolyard-or an
episode of `Married With Children'. Yet there's an infectious sunshine
in its comedy; Garry Shandling's first big screen starring vehicle
revels in impropriety without lapsing into bad taste. My problems with
What Planet Are You From? generally lie outside its sense of humour.
A Star Wars-style credit crawl recounts the development of a faraway
planet populated entirely by brilliant, emotionless men. Their leader
(Ben Kingsley) has chosen galactic domination as their next course of
action, starting with Earth. One lucky citizen will be outfitted with an
electric schlong and transported via some bizarre molecular charge to
America, natch, where he will be expected to impregnate an earthling
woman. `Harold Anderson' (Shandling) proves himself up to the challenge
in a series of ignorantly designed tests on the art of courtship.
Harold's spaceship' crashes into a plane bound for Phoenix; he begins
work immediately upon exiting the tiny lavatory, flirting unsuccessfully
with a harried flight attendant (Judy Greer) and a passenger
(Shandling's receptionist from `The Larry Sanders Show', Janeane
Garofalo) who has been frightened by the faux turbulence. (`I like your
shoes,' he tells her as she cries out for comfort.) On ground, Harold
immediately lands an upper-level job at a non-descript financial
institution, where he seeks out dating advice from philandering
co-worker Perry (Greg Kinnear).
Following a few aborted flings, Harold meets recovering alcoholic Susan
(a game Annette Bening), with whom he shares a desire to have a baby.
They marry in Vegas and have a 21-hour honeymoon of non-stop sex. Like
many a horn dog before him, Harold misunderstands his duties as a
provider of emotional support thereafter, and would rather watch TV than
discuss feelings with his wife.
The film's witty hook is that Susan can't tell the difference between a
man and an alien-moreover, that a member of a notoriously unsympathetic
alien race is anthropologically indistinguishable from sleazy Perry or
Roland Jones (John Goodman), a neglectful airline insurance
investigator. (Jones allows his marriage to disintegrate in his quest to
expose Harold's secret identity.) As a result, Harold and Susan's
interstellar divide is, amusingly, a non-issue. Still, it's not news
that the sexes are eternally, and maybe extraterrestrially, engaged in
silent battle, and whenever What Planet Are You From? gets its mind out
of the gutter long enough to be about long term relationships, it is no
more revelatory than a night at `Yuk Yuk's. (A little vibrating penis
goes a long, long way.)
As the man responsible for The Graduate, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,
and Carnal Knowledge, director Nichols specializes in stories that
explore the male-female dynamic, which probably made him seem the ideal
choice to mount a quasi-adaptation of John Gray's soupy reference book
Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus. Yet What Planet Are You From?'s
guiding hand could be mistaken for that of John Landis or Amy
Heckerling, especially given the preponderance of skin and the shabbier
edges of the material (neither filmmaker is famed for his/her scrutiny):
the corners of the blasé plot don't always meet and Bo Welch's
outerspace sets are derivative of Men in Black's gleaming headquarters,
which he also designed.
Lacking any unique political perspective, What Planet Are You From? is a
high-profile T&A comedy, albeit an enjoyable one. The tone of  the film
is pleasantly relaxed and awfully sweet-we're barely alerted to the
climax before it happens and get to spend a lot of quality time with
Bening as she charms in spades. Shandling is droll, as always (as a
devoted fan of `...Larry Sanders...', I admit a certain bias to the
scrunch-faced actor), and, as Harold begins tearing down his emotional
girders and taking responsibility for his actions, he displays an
oft-muted warmth in full-force. (Shandling also makes off with the best
line in the movie, say I, though to reveal it is to spoil many
surprises.)
Others in the ensemble are not so successful, notably Kinnear, who
fritters away the clout earned from an Oscar nomination in a role that
has Sam McMurray (who played the wife-swapping boss of Nicolas Cage's
character in Raising Arizona) written all over it. And what the heck are
Linda Fiorentino and Ben Kingsley doing there? If Nichols didn't have
the reputation of a Woody Allen or a Robert Altman, and if the project
didn't necessitate hiring big names to elevate its cachet beyond that of
another coming-of-human tale, casting choices may have been a little
less all-star perfunctory, and subsequently improved the picture.

Title
Review for Scream 3 (2000)
Miramax "disinvited" on-line media from press screenings of Scream 3.
They ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled
reviews and post them prior to the film's February 4th release
date-unsound reasoning. You see, 'net critics established enough to be
on any sort of VIP list are professionals-Miramax surely knows the
difference between a member of The On-Line Film Critics Society (OFCS)
and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at Ain't It Cool News. No,
the mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than
whodunit, that Scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved (by this
writer, at least) franchise.
Something smells rotten in the state of California right from the
get-go: Cotton Weary (Liev Schrieber), the former lover and would-be
killer of Maureen Prescott, Sidney's mother, is juggling phone calls in
his luxury car. (Once considered a danger to society, Weary now hosts
his own talk show, "100% Cotton", a clever, if dated, jab at American
pop culture.) Of course, a new Ghostface dials him up, and, with
memories of Scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind, we
immediately wonder, Where is the killer? The backseat? The next car?
Thrilling prospects, to be sure, but actually, Ghostface is at the Weary
residence, waiting for Cotton's girlfriend (Kelly Rutheford) to
finishing showering. What's missing from this sequence, and indeed
Scream 3's remaining frights (most disappointingly, the moment when an
ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with Ghostface
costumes, one of which might spring to life), is an elaborate and
attenuated payoff.
Our other surviving regulars have become estranged. Sidney (Campbell) is
living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected
locks, while Dewey (Arquette) acts as technical advisor on the second
sequel to Scream 2's movie-within-a-movie, "Stab 3", and Gale Weathers
(Cox Arquette) headlines a gossipy news program. Murder reunites them,
as knife-wielding Ghostface stalks the set of "Stab 3", imitating its
sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with
Sidney's death.
The appeal of Ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your
boyfriend, your classmate, your next door neighbour...or a combination
of people. Scream was the first of its kind: a slasher mystery, with the
guessing game not only entailing who will be next, but also who is/are
the perpetrator(s) and what is/are his/her/their motive. Ironic
self-reflection aside, parts one and two stand out in a crowd that
includes umpteen Friday the 13th and Halloween flicks because there's at
last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume. With Scream 3,
the novelty of Ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some, but
the character remains conceptually potent.
Conceptually. The execution of Ghostface's master plan this time around
is creaky, because screenwriter Ehren Kruger has invented a new
mythology for the world of Sidney Prescott far afield from what we'd
come to understand in Scream and Scream 2. The movie gets in the silly
habit of saying "All bets are off!" in reference to the "rules" of a
trilogy's third act, but there's a difference between rule breaking and
cheating. With the departure of Kevin Williamson, who authored the
previous Screams as well as a tidy outline for Scream 3 (that, for
reasons incomprehensible to me, was ignored, save the notion of "Stab
3"), Kruger needed to be reined in tighter, and by Wes Craven.
Craven's direction of Scream 3 is lazy in most respects. How else to
explain the Jay and Silent Bob cameo (the slacker duo of Kevin Smith
movies), akin to seeing Mickey Mouse pop up in Mulan and more
distracting than funny. It pains me to write this, but Scream 3's comedy
is generally laughless, with the exception of well-timed performances by
Josh Pais (as a police detective possessed of the same personality he
had as a persnickety teacher in Craven's Music of the Heart), Jamie
Kennedy (resurrecting film geek Randy for the sendoff he was denied in
Scream 2), and Parker Posey (through sheer force of will as a
B-actress).
The visuals are much weaker in part three, as well-the occasional
sweeping gesture of Peter Deming's camera is a pale imitation of the
stalking Steadicam Craven gave us twice before. (Aside: in the wake of
Columbine, Craven toned down the violence significantly for Scream 3-why
the sanctimony, when  Scream and Scream 2 are still readily available on
video store shelves?) Finally, Marco Beltrami's music cues the suspense
too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station
in Scream 2? It's mostly silent. Sting notes are a whole lot more
effective if they spring from nowhere; here, they act as the crescendos
of an incessantly nerve-jangling score.
I look at Scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe, the same
place that birthed The Godfather Part III and Superman III-woefully out
of synch with its prequels, Scream 3 is a nightmare instead of
nightmarish, and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs. The
film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a T:
part three must disappoint'.

Review for Home Fries (1998)
HOME FRIES * (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
[For past reviews, bi-weekly trivia, etc., visit
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/ ]
starring Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson, Jake Busey, Catherine O'Hara
screenplay by Vince Gilligan
directed by Dean Parisot
Note to screenwriters and self: when you hit the big time, and the
studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your
bottom drawer, tell em all to hit the road.  Gilligan wrote the
arbitrarily-titled HOME FRIES ten years ago; it was shelved until he
found success as one of "The took a second look at Gilligan's
"comedy" - they read it again wearing rose-tinted glasses.
Drew stars as Sally, a dim (but sweet), pregnant waitress at a small
town burger joint located somewhere in the Southern United States. The
father of her child is dead, the victim of a severe heart attack
brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons - these
flyboys scared him with their low-flying helicopter. Dorian (Wilson)
and Angus (Busey) were getting even for his philandering ways on
behalf of their anguished mother (O'Hara). Trouble is, Sally picked
up some interference on her drive-thru headset, and Angus worries she
may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior
to the accidental killing. So Dorian goes undercover as a
burger-flipper; before you can say "with cheese" he falls for the
mother-to-be. Too bad Mom and Angus have homicidal plans for Sally.
Does this sound like a movie you want to see?
Without a doubt, the best thing about HOME FRIES is Barrymore; at the
risk of sounding sexist, she's never looked better than here, as a
curly redhead with twinkling eyes. She is winning in a role that
requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple-cheek cute and
gawk at Wilson, her real-life boyfriend. But the plot and the
situations are so off-putting that nothing could save it. This movie
desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the Coen
brothers, but HOME FRIES' brand of laboured hipness would be
foreign to geniuses like Ethan and Joel. It's Raising Arizona
without babies, without charm, without laughs, without human
characters, and without intelligence; worst of all, it's
creepy. What's funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman
with a machine gun? (Unless the woman in question is a Spice Girl.)
Take out the helicopters, the quasi-incestuous relationship between
the mother and her sons (it is absolutely illogical, within the
movie's framework, that Dorian still lives with his mother and
brother), and the scenes of murder (attempted and otherwise), and what
are you left with? The story of a single woman with child who works at
a fast food joint (but dreams of becoming a country singer). That
could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made, but it'd be
better than HOME FRIES.

Review for Dark City (1998)
DARK CITY ** (out of four)
-by Bill Chambers - wchamber@netcom.ca

FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504
I now include a section where YOU the surfer can recommend movies to
ME and other netheads. Have a freakin' good time.)
starring Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly
written by Lem Dobbs, David S. Goyer and Alex Proyas
directed by Alex Proyas
This review is more like an open letter to Alex Proyas, and thus
contains plot spoilers, which I urge you to indulge in if you haven't
yet seen this film, so you may donate your admission to a more
charitable cause.
It has to be said right away. Dark City is a deeply ironic film for
the following reason: this is a movie about the search for the human
soul, and yet it is entertainment entirely devoid of feeling. The
Crow's Proyas is so fussy about the look of his film that not even
three writers could save it from becoming an expensive- looking CD-ROM
adventure, replete with B-grade actors (Hurt excepted) and an
unsatisfactory conclusion.
Sewell stars as John, a man who wakes up one evening in a hotel
bathtub with a dead prostitute just outside the door. He can't
remember anything, and the Peter Lorre- impersonating doctor
(Sutherland) who phones him tells him only to flee the building, for
"The Strangers" are after him. In long, black trenchcoats and
wide-brimmed hats, The Strangers, a dying alien race in search of the
secrets of the human soul (they believe it may be the key to a
prolonged existence), pursue John through the streets of the dark
metropolis. It seems he poses a threat, for he can "tune"; like The
Strangers, John can stare at an object and have it morph into
something else, which poses a serious threat to them, though I must
admit even after 11 days of considering the story, I'm not sure why
this is.  The gorgeous Connelly is stuck in a thankless role as a
sultry jazz club singer for that dash of retro, and Hurt is the
detective on the non-case.
Proyas refuses to tackle certain issues. For instance, Connelly sings
melancholy tunes nightly, and Hurt plays his accordian by the light of
the street every evening after work. Instead of exploring the unifying
power of music as perhaps a key to the human soul, once the plot kicks
in Connelly and Hurt ditch their pastimes and we realize it was all
just filler, pretty moments in a movie made up entirely of either neat
or pretty moments that don't gel as a cohesive whole. And, like the
recent The Fifth Element, the screenwriters take great pains here to
establish their own logic that they then adhere to only when stuck in
a corner. Why is it John "tunes" a door onto a cement wall to escape
his enemies early on, but later in the film, when he discovers one of
the plot's big revelations may lie behind a gigantic brick wall, he
picks up a sledgehammer and starts smashing it apart? (Also, would he
really have the energy to do so, since he's been up for days?) The
Strangers have this identical "tuning" power, and yet some of them
seem to forget about it at inappropriate times, and die as a result.
Perhaps the silliest plot point has Sutherland fleeing to a giant pool
whenever he wants to hide from The Strangers, for they are afraid of
"moisture". Is this development dwelled upon at all after it is
introduced? No. Not even when it could have made for a hell of a
sequence: at one point, Sutherland, Hurt and Sewell find themselves in
a canoe, boating upstream to a mysterious beach. The Strangers could
have surrounded the boat, but they wouldn't have been able to attack
John and company for their collective fear of the river. Likewise,
John and company would not have been able to attack them, because they
would have had to exit the boat to do so. This could have been a very
tense moment, one I anticipated since they mapped it out for
themselves, and yet, what happens? John and company exit the boat and
proceed to destroy said wall. There are very few payoffs in this
screenplay.
For all its flaws, Dark City is a triumph of production design, and
the CGI effects are impressive. Proyas also resists the urge to gum up
the sound track with alternative tunes, dashing any studio hopes of a
hit tie-in album. And I must cop to being intrigued for the first half
of the film. Hurt is just fine in his role, and Sutherland has his
moments, but, for the most part, the acting is weak across the board.
Sewell is uncharismatic and we never get any real sense of jeopardy
from his noteless performance. Throughout Dark City, I couldn't help
but imagine one poor, lost Stranger, sitting in a darkened cinema,
tuning Proyas's film into something stronger.

Title
Review for Magnolia (1999)
MAGNOLIA ***1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour
Hoffman
written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson
Paul Thomas Anderson, hyphenate creator of Boogie Nights and the even
better Hard Eight, understands that chance encounters in movies, even
docudramas, never fly, so he braces you for the San Fernando Valley-set
Magnolia, his three hour ode to coincidence, with a dazzling prologue
that underlines the film's basic theme: "strange things happen." In
quick succession, Anderson, who goes by P.T. (evoking the name of a
certain ringleader), stages a 1911 murder, the death of a scuba-diving
casino dealer, and the homicide of a man in mid-suicide. The karmic
overtones of these three random acts of violence are absurd-we'd only
believe them in life if they were related to us in that reliable
fashion, "This friend of mine knows a guy who..."
A blaring TV announces the arrival of the story proper-all of Magnolia's
characters are at least peripherally connected with the television
trade. Game show producer Earl Patridge (Robards) is afflicted with
terminal cancer, as is Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall), the emcee of
his most popular program, "What Do Kids Know?". Earl's estranged son is
Frank T.J. Mackey (Cruise), a wildly successful host of seminars
("Seduce and Destroy") for sexually frustrated men. Jimmy's estranged
daughter is Claudia (Melora Walters), a sometime prostitute with a
fearsome coke habit.
Christian cop Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) will eventually meet and
court Claudia. The police officer, like Donnie Smith (William H. Macy),
a former quiz show contestant, is at first an object of ridicule, an
earnest stumblebum given to bouts of transparent bravado. The two men
generate pathos when the truth of their shared loneliness comes to the
fore. ("I have so much love to give," Donnie wails. "I just don't know
where to put it.") Adolescent Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman) is the
image of Donnie at the height of his fame-the child is a reigning "What
Do Kids Know?" champion and, mainly due to pressure from his greedy,
boorish father (Michael Bowen), on the brink of a breakdown.
Finally, there are Earl's caretakers: Linda (Moore), his hysterical
trophy wife, and Phil Parma (Hoffman), a devoted nurse-he, too, is
single, sparing no love for anyone but Earl. The old man's last request
is a reunion with his only child, so Phil dutifully hangs on the phone
forever with Frank's handlers. Wryly echoing what was suggested by the
elaborate introduction, Phil tells an operator, "You know the scene [in
the movie] in which the dying man tries to get in touch with his
long-lost son?...There's a reason they have those scenes-because they
actually happen." (Regrettably, the film's prevalent black character, a
rappin' klepto, falls victim to stereotype.)
One gathers from watching the glorious pop mess that is Magnolia that
Anderson has cobbled together every stray idea that ever landed in his
imagination. The film includes a gut-wrenching corker of a musical
number in which the characters sing along, in divergent locales, to a
lyric from Aimee Mann's pseudo-inspirational "Wise Up". (Nine of Mann's
tunes adroitly grace the soundtrack.) While the film's aggressively
unpredictable bent makes room for such playfulness, it also paves the
way for an irksome climax-an unforeseen event, guaranteed to blindside
cold audiences, lets the air out of the tire, so to speak. Artistically
liberating in that it lets Anderson off the hook at an especially tense
juncture, this final freak occurrence doesn't go far enough in mirroring
the mysteries outlined in Magnolia's preface-it lacks a sense of
destiny, of psychic neatness.
At least the conclusion is beautiful to behold-cinematographer Robert
Elswit at peak performance. His camera is more patient, but no less
animate, here than elsewhere in the picture. Anderson has encouraged
Elswit and editor Dylan Tichenor to pace Magnolia, for the first
two-thirds, like a coke binge. This risky, channel-surfing approach
keeps us sharp and is utterly appropriate, considering the content-the
extended family members on display are children of the boob tube and
have built boxes around themselves. I gather that, because he has called
Magnolia his most personal effort in interviews, Anderson's scope of
experience does not range beyond dealings with entertainment industry
types, for Earl's turf is only two steps away from that of Boogie
Nights' porn czar Floyd Gondolli. Fortunately, the emotions on parade in
Magnolia are universal.
As you may have surmised, I'm a big fan of both Hard Eight and Boogie
Nights (which earned fourth place on my Top 10 of 1997); Anderson is one
of the only hip directors to emerge from the nineties with a discernible
style. Beyond the most obvious motifs-the whip pans (borrowed from
Scorsese but used to signature effect), the cutesy title cards, the
persistent music, and the penis fixation (there lurks a Dirk
Diggler-sized dragon in the briefs of Frank Mackey, too)-a hopefulness
pervades his work. The initially miserable Magnolia is Anderson's most
optimistic vision yet, made sonorous by the best ensemble of the year.
(It would be fruitless to pick standouts, for each actor leaves a
ghost.) The film's absolute message is sentimental and appealing: fate
doesn't have to win.
Magnolia is a deeply felt kitchen sink movie reminiscent, in a good way,
of Robert Altman's sprawling ensemble pieces (the cameo appearance of
Henry Gibson-as an old queen named Thurston Howell (!)-is an oblique
reference to Nashville). According to its defamers, Anderson has
committed the high crime of self-indulgence, a stigmatic observation
I've regrettably made in past reviews-it unfairly insinuates that
ambition is offensive. One should exit this film with, above all else,
respect for the modern Barnum's talent, chutzpah, and sincerity, and
wonder what he'll do for an encore.

Review for Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)
TOMORROW NEVER DIES *** (out of four)
-a review by Chambers, Bill Chambers
(What movie do YOU recommend? Cast your opinion on my updated website,
Film Freak Central:
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504)
starring Pierce Brosnan, Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Pryce, Teri Hatcher
written by Bruce Fierstein
directed by Roger Spottiswoode
Let's face it: the $100 million-plus smash that was "Goldeneye" was
not a good film by any means, and as a Bond movie was only marginally
better than, say, "A View To A Kill" or either of the Timothy Dalton
pictures, by virtue of nice pacing. But it did revive the series, and
granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it (ie.
the new "M" is a woman). "Tomorrow Never Dies" is the picture
"Goldeneye" should have been; it's also the most entertaining Bond
outing since "The Spy Who Loved Me".
The new picture opens with China considering war with Britain after a
standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from
an English submarine. As an attack occurs, the front-page headline is
already being prepared, courtesy of Carver media. Carver (Pryce) the
man is a deluded magnate, a sort of hybrid of Ted Turner, Bill Gates,
and Peter Sellars' German scientist from "Dr. Strangelove"
(physically, Pryce even recalls Sellars in his Kubrick days). It's up
to James Bond to take him down, with assistance, of course, from a
wealth of gadgets (including a multi-purpose cell phone), and
beautiful women. Enter Michelle Yeoh, fresh from "Supercop", as a
Chinese secret agent with her own agenda; with effortless grace, she
cat burgles, dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing
pasta, and refuses the advances of our philandering hero. They make a
great team.
"Tomorrow Never Dies" is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient
film, given that at the helm is none other than the director of
"Turner & Hooch". Spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set
pieces, each much more intricate and impressive than, for instance,
the tank scene in "Goldeneye". Moreover, Brosnan has at last settled
into the role some feel he was born to play; last time out, the fate
of the franchise rested on his shoulders, and there was noticeable
discomfort in his body language. Returned in Brosnan's eyes has some
of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on TV's
"Remington Steele", as has his deadpan wit. And though Carver's
motives are muddy (when Carver explains that "genius is insanity with
some success", screenwriter Fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut),
Pryce makes an agreeable, memorable villain. In the future, they
should pursue actors as talented and experienced as Pryce to breathe
life into these cardboard figures.
There a few too many explosions in "Tomorrow Never Dies", perhaps so
many they qualify as dialogue. And it could have used a sharper
script, though I was amused by the double entendres, none of which I
will reveal here. As it stands, the plot suffers many holes (I'm not
taking about implausibilities), and the dialogue tends towards the
hackneyed. Now that the elements are in place: modern special effects
and stunt work, cool Pierce Brosnan, kickass female allies... it's
time to put them to use in something truly special. There's no
mistaking, however, that "Tomorrow Never Dies" is ideal holiday
escapism, and for the first time in perhaps years, you'll walk out
wanting more Bond movies.

Review for 8MM (1999)
8MM **˝ (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( 8mm@filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, Catherine Keener, James
Gandolfini
screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker
directed by Joel Schumacher
Last summer, I was slipped a copy of Andrew Kevin Walker's 8MM
screenplay. As someone who considers David Fincher's Se7en (also
penned by Walker) one of the most important films of the 1990s, I
couldn't resist opening the yellow covers of "eight millimeter" and
spoiling the eventual film that would come of it. What I read
essentially made it to the screen intact-but 8MM is brought to you by
Joel "Batman and Robin" Schumacher, a director not known for subtlety
or restraint.
Cage stars as private dick Tom Welles, an educated husband and father
who is summoned to a stately manor one night to meet with Mrs.
Christian (Myra Carter), the wealthy widow of a steel investor. She
felt at liberty to open her late husband's secret safe; inside it sat
a reel of eight millimeter film depicting a young woman's brutal
murder. Mrs. Christian needs to know if this "snuff" film is the real
thing; she hopes to preserve her husband's good name.
Welles' investigation takes him to the underbelly of Los Angeles. He
learns the (possibly) snuffed woman's name and last known address. He
also hooks up with a porn shop employee named Max California (Phoenix)
to ascertain what kind of mooncalfs would manufacture such depravity.
For a considerable amount of dough, the intelligent and bored Max
provides Welles with sufficient leads. So sufficient they may just get
Welles killed: Welles has stirred sleeping dogs Eddie Poole
(Gandolfini), a hothead producer, Dino Velvet (an over-the-top
Stormare), a crossbow-wielding director, and rubber-masked Machine
(Chris Bauer), a notorious star of S&M videos who lives for torture.
Because I have the unique critical perspective of someone who read the
screenplay before seeing the film, I cannot resist noting two crucial
differences between the written word and the final cut. In Walker's
5/06/97 draft, Max delivers a powerful monologue regarding the
desensitization experienced by hard-core porn watchers-he 
hypothesizes that the snuff film is the next logical evolutionary step
for the industry. It's a disheartening speech, but one that (further)
elevates 8MM beyond schlock. Schumacher chose to remove it for reasons
unknown. Walker also stated that we never see Machine's face, but
Schuamcher can't resist the urge and shows Bauer in mask-less 
close-up, thereby deflating the line "You were expecting a monster?"
Still, there is a lot to admire in 8MM, particularly the Cimmerian
lighting designs of cinematographer Robert Elswit and Canadian
composer Mychael Danna's melancholy, sitar-laced score. Schumacher and
his team have also crafted some puissant individual sequences;
although I realized I was watching the umpteenth variation on Taxi 
Driver, Welles' inevitable vigilante rampage is an unbearably sad
sight. (Aside: 8MM is also, at times, unbearably suspenseful.) The
politics of 8MM are vaguely right wing-its general attitude is
reminiscent of Schumacher's other decent picture, Falling Down-and
un-hip, but Welles' (un-PC) reactions to the vile stimuli around him
are honest and somewhat comforting. It's not that Welles becomes the
ultimate Boy Scout; on the contrary, he has a selfish need for
justice, a desire to "unsee" the horrors he has witnessed and cleanse
his soul.
A few things nagged at me as I watched 8MM in the darkened theatre:
Catherine Keener, unparalleled at portraying icy career women (most
recently in Your Friends and Neighbors), is miscast as Cage's
housewife, though it's nice to see her find work in studio pictures at
last; the pacing is off-the first half could use tightening; and Max
California's abrupt exit from the film is a directorial misstep.
Overall, however, Schumacher proves that he's capable of crafting an
absorbing film so long as the source material is not generated by
Akiva Goldsman. 8MM's best scene is shown briefly in the trailer: with
only the clickety-clackety motor of the projector on the soundtrack,
Welles sits in a blackened room, viewing a grainy, possibly faked
murder of a teenage runaway, overcome by grief and terror. And I
stared back at him, sharing his pain, thankful I'm not a sick puppy.
Neither is Schumacher.

Title
Review for Insider, The (1999)
THE INSIDER ***˝ (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, Diane Venora
screenplay by Eric Roth and Michael Mann, based on the article "The
Man Who Knew Too Much" by Marie Brenner
directed by Michael Mann
"60 Minutes" segment producer Lowell Bergman (Pacino) has contacted
Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe) hoping he'll be able to interpret an
innocuous book of scientific data on the fire hazzards of smoking.
Wigand, a chemist who was recently sent packing by cigarette
manufacturer Brown & Williamson, incorrectly presumes from Bergman's
call that a newshound is after him to break a confidentiality
agreement he signed as part of a severance package. Wigand promptly
faxes a message back that reads "Can't talk. Won't talk. Don't want
to." 
Director Michael Mann's nervous camera seems to stop dead when Bergman
realizes that his would-be interpretor has let some sort of cat out of
the bag. Pacino doesn't overemphasize the moment-a satisfied grin
flits across his face and then he's back in business mode. (After all,
Bergman at this point is a detective without a mystery.) They first
worked together on Heat, Pacino and Mann, and they make a great team.
Mann leaves Pacino's visage only out of necessity, and in return,
Pacino always gives us something to look at. 
The brilliant Crowe extends Mann the same courtesy. Jeffrey Wigand is
introduced to us as a husband and loving father of few words. (B&W
officially dismissed him for poor communication skills.) But a
disgruntled nerd lurks beneath the surface, a man prone to hard
drinking and violent outbursts. Crowe doesn't call attention to any
shift in personality-when Jeffrey's rage first reveals itself to us,
during a meeting with his former superiors, it's as if we, not Crowe,
were the ones initially repressing Wigand's dark side. And though he
changed his hair and diet to play the gray, pudgy doctor, Crowe (hulky
Bud White of L.A. Confidential) is an unavoidably imposing physical
presence, which adds another layer of tension to his scenes with
Pacino-volatile Wigand could mop the floor with Bergman. 
Wigand and Bergman team up when B&W's unwarranted pressure tactics
drive the former to blow the whistle. (They've seen him talking to
journalists; they assume the worst.) Countless threats of litigation
and murder later, Wigand sits down for veteran TV personality Mike
Wallace and discloses the cold hard truth: that he had been hired to
make "nicotine delivery devices" more addictive. Their interview is a
powerful sequence, one of many. 
Before the piece on corruption in the tobacco industry has aired, CBS
attorneys advise the "60 Minutes" crew to edit out Wigand's
contribution. As a third party exposing Jeffrey's secrets-breaking the
confidentiality agreement on his behalf-they face a lawsuit so great
that Big Tobacoo' (the seven biggies of the industry) could wind up
owning the network. For the first time in the show's history, or at
least in Lowell's fourteen year history with the show, senior producer
Don Hewitt (Phillip Baker Hall) backs down from a fight, and Wallace
joins him-he's too old and tired to stay perched on the soapbox. This
plot point is the real Mike Wallace's point of contention with The
Insider, a docudrama: he fears the film portrays him as spineless. It
does, but it might also be true.
Bergman, on the other hand, comes off as that rare media species who
glows with integrity. He's as concerned about his new friend Jeffrey's
personal sacrifice going unrewarded as he is the story's impact being
softened. (An altered version will simply warn the public that
cigarettes are bad for you-not exactly the sort of groundbreaking item
that brought "60 Minutes" to fame.) If Lowell is too saintly, in the
end, at least Pacino makes quiet confidence and old-fashioned values
as compelling as those traits that win Oscars: brooding, anger,
remorse, the fidgets-Jeffrey's qualities. Though both actors are
award-worthy, I suspect that Crowe's performance will be the one to
capture the Academy's imagination if any of The Insider's do. 
Mann has become a less rigid filmmaker over the years. As co-creator
of "Miami Vice", he practically pioneered the pastels and art deco
aesthetic of the mid-eighties; back then, his shooting style was often
as sterile as his set design. The tide turned with The Last of the
Mohicans-we were no longer voyeurs, we were participants thrown into
battle and swept up in period romance. 1995's Heat, in which his
characters slam "dead-tech post-modern bullshit" architecture,
confirmed that Mann had evolved (no pun intended) into a more
elaborate visualist. (His love of synth music has remained intact over
the years, God bless him: ex-Dead Can Dance frontwoman Lisa Gerrard
and synthesist Pieter Bourke provide The Insider with a dreamy,
emotionally satisfying score.) 
The Insider's cinematography, by Dante Spinotti, is beautifully gritty
and experimental-one memorable shot follows Crowe so closely that his
head threatens to knock the lens. Several unfocused reaction takes
feel as if they were captured on the fly. Perhaps and Mann and his
team were inspired by the work of Wong Kar-Wei (whose freeform
Chungking Express The Insider often resembles in visual terms) or
Dogma 95 (the ideal co-developed by Breaking the Waves' director Lars
Von Trier that prohibits the use of unnatural lighting, Steadicams,
and the like). Whatever the case, the film bears the most
issue-oriented screenplay Mann's worked from yet; had he Hollywood-ed
up the presentation, it might have enhanced the story's preachiness
for the worse. 
At last, the importance of Dr. Wigand's ballsy confession has been
acknowledged; The Insider is great moviemaking.

Review for Sleepers (1996)
(For more purple prose check out FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504 I now include a section
where YOU the surfer can recommend movies to ME and other
netheads. Have a freakin' good time.)
Kevin Bacon, Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patric, Brad Pitt
written & directed by Barry Levinson
With a weak script at its core, SLEEPERS is akin to the world's
greatest chefs making toast. Based on the supposedly non-fictional
book by Lorenzo Carcaterras (it's difficult to believe, for starters,
that Carcaterras and his friends look like Patric and Pitt), the film
offers very little in the way of tension or drama, and even resorts to
such tired devices as (flat, obvious) narration to make sense of the
complicated--but by no means involving-- plot. This is despite a
wealth of talent before and behind the camera.
Hell's Kitchen is the setting for the story, in which a group of four
mischief-prone boys accidentally injure a bystander when one of their
pranks goes awry. Said boys are then sent to a reformatory, where they
pay for their mistake in the form of Bacon's perverted guard, who
sexually tortures them repeatedly during their stay. Fourteen years
later, two of his victims discover Bacon at a bar and gun him
down. It's up to Patric and Pitt, who have grown up to become a
reporter and a lawyer, respectively, to help their childhood amigos
win the court case that follows.
The best thing one can say about SLEEPERS is that it features some
nice performances by DeNiro as Father Bob, the neighbourhood priest,
and Dustin Hoffman as a washed-up alcoholic lawyer, as well as a few
well-crafted individual scenes.  Levinson (RAIN MAN, DISCLOSURE) pays
no attention to detail in terms of the eighties sequences, in which
everyone wears stylish 1996 clothing. But that's a moot point compared
to the script's central problem: we don't care about any of these
people, or whether they triumph in the end, because their
personalities are interchangeable and ultimately unappealing. The
pacing is terrible; if Levinson insisted on making a film this long
(two-and-a-half hours) he should have spent the time developing the
characters instead of showing us redundant flashbacks and silly scenes
which further complicate the plot.
Molestation and pedophilia are very serious issues that have been
fashioned here into a story as perfunctory and pointless as a TV
movie-of-the-week. While "Sleepers" in the film are defined as people
who have been waiting to get revenge, the title more aptly describes
director and crew during the making of the film. It's bad enough that
these wonderful chefs made toast. They burned it.

Review for Hilary and Jackie (1998)
HILARY AND JACKIE *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( wchamber@netcom.ca )
(Happy New Year! from Film Freak Central -
http://filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Emily Watson, Rachel Griffiths, David Morrissey, Jim Frain
screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce
directed by Anand Tucker
1998 may go down as the year of the Disease Movie. This month alone,
Susan Sarandon gets cancer in Stepmom,  and half the cast of Patch
Adams has leukemia by the time the closing credits roll. Last fall,
Meryl Streep contracted cancer in One True Thing. Hilary and Jackie
also co-stars a disease: multiple sclerosis, which attacks cellist
Jacqueline Du Pré in her prime. But the film is very much unlike the
sanctimonious, movie-of-the-week affliction melodramas currently
scoring at the box office. Death, you see, is anything but romantic;
it doesn't happen on cue; and it does not transform a person into a
saint. Hilary and Jackie acknowledges these cold, hard facts.
Hilary and Jackie Du Pré are sisters growing up in 1950s Sussex
County, England. Both are encouraged by their  overbearing mother to
practice music, but Hilary is the favoured daughter, having appeared
on local television with her flute. Jackie becomes obsessed with
achieving her sister's level of achievement, and practices her cello
night and day. Eventually, she actually ties with Hilary at a local
talent competition. Fame and fortune seek Jackie out; while Jackie
tours Europe, Hilary finds a mate in an amateur conducter named Kiffer
Finzi (Morrissey), much to Jackie's chagrin.
Hilary, as the filmmakers would have it, is entirely selfless,
abandoning her instrument at a young age so as not to interfere with
Jackie's desire for success. Jackie, on the other hand, is a
monster-despite the fact that she has a mate of her own (Frain, as
famed pianist Daniel Barenboim), she demands sexual favours from
Hilary's husband; Hilary allows Jackie to take advantage of her
generosity.
The story is divided into two halves: "Hilary" follows Hilary from
childhood to domesticity. In scene after scene, she lets Jackie walk
all over her out of an inherent sisterly devotion, then cowers away to
a corner to cry silently about it. Griffiths, who played Jude's
conniving first wife in Jude, demonstrates great range as the nice'
sister, a woman who essentially gives up whatever makes her feel
special out of guilt. The movie wisely avoids pitting her against
Jackie in a big shouting match-much of her pain remains unresolved at
the finish. The "Jackie" half essentially tells the "Hilary" story
from the opposite viewpoint; some, but not all, of Jackie's callous
actions are justified in this section. (For example: In "Hilary," the
Du Pré family are disappointed to open a package from travelling
Jackie that contains only her laundry, while in "Jackie," it is
explained that Jackie has no access to a washing facility, and sends
her clothes home in desperation.) Jackie resents Hilary for her
decidedly unhectic lifestyle; her cello is a crutch, something she
can't abandon. (Indeed, she tries to, but neither a night of harsh
weather nor an attempt to leave it behind in a cab end the
relationship Jackie has with her instrument. It is as resilient as
Hilary.) That resentment does not pass as the disease begins to ravage
her body, and this is the movie's strong point. When Jackie makes a
cruel joke regarding Kiffer's infidelity-while lying in a hospital
bed-we can see the heartbreak in Hilary's eyes.
Watson's performance is certainly impressive (though her
unidentifiable accent sometimes distracts), but we should not overlook
Boyce's relentless screenplay, which allows Jackie to remain immature
and rapacious. (That Jacqueline Du Pré is a bona fide historical
figure sort of makes daring Hilary and Jackie this year's Raging Bull:
at the heart of the film is a fascinating jerk.) Boyce's script is not
impeccable. Though more unified than his last produced work, Welcome
To Sarajevo, his beach-set bookends don't pay off, and the male
characters-particularly the third Du Pré sibling, their brother-are
vaguely drawn.
Tucker's fluid camera and candy-coloured interiors tend to gloss over
the story's flaws. (Tucker has little flair for subtlety-the film has
been assembled in such a way that you're always aware of what will
become a motif the first time it appears on screen, such as Jackie's
tendency to "raspberry.") Understand that I'm strongly recommending 
Hilary and Jackie on the basis of its central performances and its
frequently courageous writing. The real disease that Jackie suffers
from, the movie posits, is envy. The competitive spirit attacks Du Pré
like a cancer at a young age, and a terminal illness simultaneously
punishes her for it (her battle with MS lasted sixteen years) and
liberates her from its grip.

Review for Faculty, The (1998)
THE FACULTY ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( wchamber@netcom.ca )
[For more purple prose, visit Film Freak Central -
http://filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Clea DuVall, Jordana Brewster
screenplay by Kevin Williamson
directed by Robert Rodriguez
Before Kevin Williamson came along, could anyone other than film
geeks/freaks name a living, working screenwriter? His name on a
movie's credits (sometimes before the title) is a signal to teenagers
that they're in for some post-Gen X irony-his screenplays assume
everyone born after 1980 grew up in a video store. (Often, as he's 
cribbing a plot, he'll refer to the source-the Breakfast Club episode
of "Dawson's Creek", for example.) Williamson is, in some circles,
even hipper than Quentin Tarantino is.
T2's Robert Patrick stars as a pent-up high school football coach
whose body is taken over by a parasitic alien; he proceeds to
contaminate virtually the entire faculty-most amusingly,
Ain't-It-Cool-News webmaster Harry Knowles (!) in his screen debut as
the Teacher Most In Need of a Treadmill. A group of rambunctious 
whippersnappers uncover this secret early on. Together, they search
for places to hide and a defense against their newfound enemies.
Said group of archetypal-make that stereotypical-teen heroes are as
follows: Delilah (Brewster), the head cheerleader and school beauty;
Stan (Shawn Hatosy), ex-captain of the football team and ex-boyfriend
of Delilah-a jock with a yearning for learning; Casey (Wood), the
underappreciated school nerd; Marybeth (Laura Harris), the naive new
girl in school; Zeke (Hartnett), the rebel without a comb, an
underachieving student who sells homemade drugs out of the trunk of
his car; and Stokeley (DuVall-be still my beating heart), the weirdo
gothic brainer who pretends she's a lesbian so guys will leave her
alone. Did I just describe the cast of The Breakfast Club? Here,
Williamson takes it a step further, as the characters look to the text
of Jack Finney's Invasion of the Body Snatchers for a solution to
their dilemma.
The real problem is that Rodriguez (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn) is
such an efficient director (three staff members are snatched within
the first five minutes of the film) that (the nonetheless enjoyable)
The Faculty rarely has a chance to breathe. Relationships are pared
down to their essentials; oftentimes, two characters are conversing
(and snooping together) who were not friends a scene before. Marybeth
gravitates to Stokeley immediately-why? Unlike The Breakfast Club (or
any of the Body Snatchers films, for that matter), there is little
reason all these characters would unite. Also, as in most movies of
this type, it seems a dartboard was used to select who will become an
alien and who won't. (Aside, some entries for Roger Ebert's Movie
Glossary: when testing a group of people to see which person is
harbouring a secret alien identity, the last one tested will turn out
to be the monster; in an attempt to body snatch the male protagonist,
a female villain will appear totally nude before him and invite him
closer.)
There is mild subtext to Williamson's screenplay (which was polished
off by David Wechter and Bruce Kimmel)-The Faculty at time plays like
an effects-laden "Just Say No!" commercial. Which is a great message, 
except that drugs defeat these aliens-perhaps Rodriguez and co. are
commenting on the merits of detox? The beauty of all three Body
Snatchers movies is how emblematic of their respective periods they
are (1956: McCarthyism; 1978: the Me Generation; 1993: the military
state); in 1999, there is more to say about the threat of widespread
mind control than what's laid out here. Today's teenagers and
twentysomething folks (myself included) have been spoonfed so much pop
culture-we're all talking like the characters on "Friends"-that I
doubt they'd notice if our teachers and parents lost their identities,
too.

Review for Me, Myself & Irene (2000)
(Film, DVD, and books about movies reviews. Essays. Contests.
http://filmfreakcentral.net
Bring a friend.)
starring Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger, Chris Cooper, Michael Bowman
screenplay by Peter Farrelly & Mike Cerrone & Bobby Farrelly
directed by The Farrelly Brothers
Memo to the Farrelly Brothers (There's Something About Mary, Kingpin):
comedies don't need plot, they need jokes. While watching Me, Myself &
Irene, I thought back to a bit from that show of shows, "The Simpsons",
in which papa Homer wails "Be funny!" as he attacks the television
during an especially lame program. The film's dense (in every sense of
the word) screenplay, an unseemly love letter to Rhode Island (the
Farrellys' birthplace), is beneath Jim Carrey, who is given precisely
two notes to play that he has dwelled upon enough already.
Charlie (Carrey), a Rhode Island state trooper, has let people walk all
over him for years; his bottled hostility has finally come uncorked and
manifested itself in the form of a second personality by the name of
Hank, a swaggering, Clint Eastwood-type with zero powers of repression.
The police force puts him on medication, then asks him to escort a cutie
pie criminal (Renee Zellweger, still wincing) from Rhode Island to
Messena, where her arrest warrant awaits.
We expect that their trip to Messena will comprise the bulk of the
story, and that along the way Charlie will lose or forget to take his
pills and hulk out. Despite the odds, he and Irene will fall in love.
But Me, Myself & Irene needlessly goes and gets itself a villain--worse,
one with an entirely incomprehensible motive. Chris Cooper, an actor not
famed for his comic gifts, is embarrassingly earnest as the heavy.
Even prior to Cooper's entrance, the theatre begins to smell like flop
sweat. Carrey's patented fearlessness provokes a couple of belly laughs
early on, but his performance, a sort of Jekyll & Hyde revue of his
Truman Show and Cable Guy personas, grows old fast. Contributing to this
over-familiarity is a climax that effectively duplicates Liar, Liar's
hilarious bathroom brawl between Carrey and himself. (And yet the
Farrellys snipped a moment in which Carrey had sex with a watermelon
because it too closely resembled American Pie's pastry rape.)
Everything about Me, Myself & Irene lacks edge, including the gross-out
gags (the second best of which the filmmakers have the nerve to
apologize for in a quick, closing credits take) and shockingly unfunny
narration (whose tediousness is highlighted by the brothers' tendency to
allow for hypothetically lengthy giggles with slow-paced editing).
Stay through to the bitter end for a mildly amusing post-script.

Title
Review for Deep Impact (1998)
Starring Tea Leoni, Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvall, Elijah Wood
Written by Bruce Joel Rubin and Michael Tolkin
Directed by Mimi Leder
I thought the "competing projects" trend had reached its zenith in
1992 when two overwrought Christopher Columbus movies reached the
screens. The fact that both of them died quickly at the box office
didn't deter the studios from financing separate films about
volcanoes and track-star Prefontaine. Now, Deep Impact is the first
asteroid picture out of the gate - July brings us Armageddon - and
it's certainly no embarrassment to the end of the world'
genre.
Freeman is the President of the United States, bearer of bad news: a
comet the size of Mt. Everest is careening towards Earth, and unless a
team of astronauts can throw it off course, the world as we know it
will end. In three separate stories, we see how this information
deeply impacts' U.S.  citizens. Leoni is an MSNBC reporter who
first cracks the story and hopes that her divorced parents will
reunite before certain doom. Duvall is a veteran astronaut who
accompanies green pilots on the impossible mission. (These are the
best scenes in the film, but the idea that these young astronauts
shun, rather than look up to, Duvall is questionable-false
conflict.) And Wood is a teenage astronomer whom, essentially,
discovered the deadly rock and has it named after him; he wants to use
his fame to bring his girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski, a dead ringer for
Helen Hunt) and her family underground with him, where 800 000 people
have been randomly selected to live during and after the possible
devastation.
After the boring The Peacemaker, Leder's debut, I was not looking
forward to Deep Impact, but she brings an energy to the proceedings
here that she previously employed on the adrenalized series "E.R." She
handles the material with sensitivity, though she skimps on how the
public copes during the year leading up to destruction. As well, by
following three stories focusing on less-than-average people (a
reporter, an astronaut, and a famed-astronomer), a perspective is
skewed-these are characters with a constant inside track to
scientific progress, also presumably more rational than typical John
Doe. I also didn't buy Wood and Sobieski-they seemed more like
brother-and-sister than high-schoolers in crush.
Yet the gripping moments in Deep Impact almost compensate for its
flaws.  I really enjoyed the landing-on-the-comet
sequence-Armageddon will have its work cut out. Freeman and Duvall
are outstanding, as is Vanessa Redgrave as Leoni's mother. In
addition, whenever the film slowed down-a scene in which Duvall
reads "Moby Dick" to fellow teammate Ron Eldard is downright
leisurely-it hints at a bigger, meatier movie that might be on the
cutting room floor. One thing's for sure: the climax will have a
deep impact on anyone who envisions environmental eradication when
Freeman makes his first speech-nightmarish in spectacle, it's
possibly worse, and more terrifyingly beautiful, than you could ever
imagine.

Title
Review for Arlington Road (1999)
ARLINGTON ROAD ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (arlington@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis
screenplay by Ehren Kruger
directed by Mark Pellington
Wrote Josh Young, in issue #493 of "Entertainment Weekly": "With
studios now viewing the mid-level, Oscar-nominated directors as a
luxury they can no longer afford, established auteurs...are facing
increasingly stiff competition from slick young music-video turks
who'll work for a mere pittance." From its galling opening sequence, I
wondered what Arlington Road would look like had it been sired by
someone more established than the director of Pearl Jam's "Jeremy"
clip. Pellington is so mindful of the image' that writer Kruger's
plotting eventually drops off the tightrope of credibility. Could a
veteran filmmaker, comparable in status to the late Alan J. Pakula,
swindle us more successfully with the same screenplay? 
Bridges, who consistently rises above the material, is Michael
Faraday, a professor of anti-terrorism for Washington State. Faraday
one day rushes his neighbours' boy, Brady, to the hospital after
discovering him burnt, bleeding, and walking aimlessly down the
street, the victim of a firecracker mishap. This occasions him to
befriend Brady's parents, the Langs (Robbins, weaker than usual, and
Cusack, who steals the show), and for a while, Faraday appreciates
their company, as do his son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark), and
girlfriend, Brooke (Davis). (His FBI agent wife was killed three years
before in the line of duty.) 
Faraday is suspicious by nature, though, and when one or two of Oliver
Lang's anecdotes don't add up, he runs a background check on the
family man. His findings indicate a checkered past for Oliver, but
does that mean the people across the street are involved in extremism?
The evidence that soon piles up-top-secret blueprints, phony
identities-does not suggest differently. 
This latest entry in the paranoia' genre at least presents an enemy
that isn't a shadow government. In its place: a nuclear family.
(Snicker.) Mr. Lang loves to work, Mrs. Lang loves to shop and cook
and hold parties, and the couple has toeheaded children. Faraday's gut
tells him that nobody's home life is this TV-perfect. (Think about it:
they even named one of their kids Brady.) 
Such cynicism bears the mark of an MTV-generation director. So does
the ungraceful editing-David Fincher (who helmed Seven and The Game
after years at video and commercial house Propaganda Films) excepted,
do Pellington and his peers think in strobes? Pellington's cutting
inspires panic rather than tension. He stages frenzied scenes that
whip us into a tizzy without much regard for structure and pace. That
the picture is more kinetic than absorbing also makes its script-holes
easier to spot. (Arlington Road's villains are psychic as well as
psychotic: they foretell Faraday's moves with dubious accuracy.) 
The film's most unnecessary sequence-it grinds the story to a halt-is
also the most self-consciously "provocative": we see children with
heavy artillery, blasting away at feds, most of whom die; we see a
mother shoot Mrs. Faraday in cold blood with one hand, clinging to her
newborn with the other. This is the mandatory nineties
flashback-Faraday reenacts for his students the day he became a widow.
The images just described belong in a more serious picture. 
After all, Arlington Road is only self-important. It has nothing
substantial or enlightening to say on the subject of extremism, though
the children in jeopardy angle does push one's buttons. Unlike The
Parallax View's analogous climax, which may have inspired Kruger,
Arlington Road's grim finish is overwrought-it says more about the
studios' new tolerance for unhappy endings than what it purports to
comment on, America's want for scapegoats.

Title
Review for Payback (1999)
PAYBACK *˝ (out of four) 
-a review by Bill Chambers ( payback@filmfreakcentral.net )
(Come with me to the casbah--Film Freak Central:
http://filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Mel Gibson, Gregg Henry, Maria Bello, Kris Kristofferson
screenplay by Brian Helgeland and Terry Hayes, based on the novel "The
Hunter" by Richard Stark
directed by Brian Helgeland
Ladies and gentlemen, Payback is the most expensive episode of "The
Equalizer" I've ever seen. 
Gibson plays Porter, a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife
(Deborah Kara Unger, in an all-too-brief cameo) and partner (Henry)
after a successful heist. As a morgue attendant sets about removing
the bullets from Porter's back, Porter miraculously springs back to
life. He makes it his mission, as a walking dead man without a
conscience, to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his
share of the loot. (In a running gag, Porter demands $70 000, but
everybody mishears him and assumes he's after the entire $130 000
haul.) In his travels (or travails), Porter encounters several other
one-named villainous cretins like Fairfax (James Coburn as a
white-haired, millionaire thief) and Carter (Kristofferson, as a
brown-haired, millionaire thief-the kingpin of the obligatory
"operation"). 
Helgeland's film (which was recut by Mel the Producer) is devoid of an
imperative dime store charm. The novelty of seeing a big movie star
mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly: a) because the
bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs, and b) because
Mel's schtick doesn't evolve from act one-he's The Terminator
stranded in a plot without a sci-fi hook to keep us interested after
the initial sadistic thrill is gone. Payback should have been called
Playback: it's a 102-minute loop of the same short sequence. (Mel: "I
want my money." Anonymous Villain: "No." Mel shoots gun. Anonymous
villain dies. Mel meets up with his hooker friend (Bello). Second
verse, same as the first.) It's not Porter's single-mindedness that
robs the film of snap, crackle, and pop; as a character who has
already "died" once, he has nothing to lose and so much to gain. The
movie lacks danger. The only thing Porter is in jeopardy of is putting
the audience to sleep.
Payback has a gritty, metallic look to it that also becomes
monotonous; its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of
those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of England every couple
of months. (Director of photography Ericson Core should have been
fired early on for lighting Bello, so va-va-va-voom in Permanant
Midnight, to look like a potato in a Gregg Allman wig.) 
To analyze such mediocrity is to grant Payback far more attention than
it deserves. Perhaps only someone as experienced with
antagonists-as-protagonists as Tarantino-look what he did with the
similar hero-less botched-robbery tale Reservoir Dogs-could have
pulled off this material (a loose remake of John Boorman's Point
Blank). The movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction
(all women are femme fatales; even the cops are in on it, etc.) and
crosses them with the conventions of cheesy TV crime melodramas (death
is never in the cards for the main character, etc.) but transcends
neither. 

Title
Review for Fight Club (1999)
FIGHT CLUB *** (out of four) 
-a review by Bill Chambers (fight@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf
screenplay by Jim Uhls, based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk
directed by David Fincher
Some movie rags have reported that Fight Club's release date was
bumped from July to October to distance it from the Columbine
shootings. If that's true (director David Fincher says he just needed
more time to fine tune the editing), isn't Fox taking a step backward
by attaching to all Fight Club prints the trailer for Light it Up, a
film about a high school kid who tires of the dreaded "system" and
therefore takes his classmates hostage? Fight Club is very violent,
but Light it Up looks sensationalistic.  
Fight Club explores instead of exploiting. It never stops presenting
high-falutin' ideas. In some ways, the film is too existential to be
incendiary-you don't feel riled up by the closing credits, you feel
worn out, exhausted from playing headgames. 
The story is told through the eyes of Norton's nameless narrator (the
movie refers to him as Jack at times, so I will do the same here), a
flunky for an unidentified automaker by day, an insomniac always. Jack
spends entire evenings sifting through Ikea catalogues and staring
hopelessly at TV infomercials. He tells his physician he's miserable,
dying inside, but the doctor responds that if he really wants to know
about pain, he should meet with victims of testicular cancer. 
Jack actually visits a support group for such people, and their
stories cause him to weep uncontrollably. At last, feelings. A good
cry helps him sleep like a baby; soon, he becomes an eager tourist of
like meetings, but Marla (Carter), another phony who has begun making
the support group rounds for "free cake and coffee," interrupts his
good time. Maybe her beauty distracts him, or maybe he just can't deal
with his own lie reflected back, but Jack is made positively irate by
Marla's presence on his turf. 
He takes a break from the 12-step world for company trips, and on one
plane ride he meets Tyler Durden (Pitt-has he ever been this
magnetic?), a soap salesman with the gift of gab. They exchange
business cards, and when Jack returns home to find his apartment
bombed out (the stove's pilot light was left on), he calls Tyler.
Three pitchers of beer later, Jack has a place to stay. 
Tyler introduces him to a seedier life. In Jack's new digs, the
electricity must be turned off during a rainstorm. The shower runs
brown water. The staircase could collapse at any moment. But this is
to his delight: for once, he's not slave to his stuff-expensive
furnishings and appliances. (Tyler tells him, "We don't own things,
the things own us.") 
Tyler offers Jack another release through fighting. What starts out as
a few innocuous swings at one another in a parking lot turns into an
underground sensation, with various disillusioned men meeting one
night of the week in the basement of a dive to scrap. (Tyler, in
essence, extols the virtues of nihilism.) Marla disrupts Jack's
happiness again, though, when she worms her way back into his life
through a sexual relationship with Tyler. 
After only three films (Alien3, Se7en, The Game), Fincher has
developed a distinct style-there is a consistent tone running through
his filmography which could be weakly characterized as "bleak".
Certainly, his works are linked by visual motifs, such as the most
piercing flashlights this side of Spielberg, dank locales, flash
frames, and low angles. (His technique is a bit more playful this time
around; his acknowledgment of the medium itself in one scene is
downright postmodern.) Fight Club also recalls The Game in its second
half as Jack's reality changes and he no longer knows who is
trustworthy. 
But Fincher's past examinations of identity crisis (consider also
Se7en's villain) were emotionally hard-hitting, and while Fight Club
should be applauded for going out on a philosophical limb (much is
made of Jack and Tyler's yin yang dynamic, as symbolized by Jack's
table, and how violence will turn you into a drone as much as sitting
under the fluorescent lights in a cubicle might), it is unmoving.
Cynicism gets in the way at the start, when we're asked to laugh at
truly pitiable characters, including Meat Loaf's sympathetic cancer
survivor (the camera keeps lingering on his large, feminine breasts).
(Other jokes go over better.) When the narrative shifts gears to
Marla's subplot, we learn that she's a burnout (hardly the femme
fatale the ads would have you believe), and little else. She exists to
inform us about Jack, so we vest little interest in their
relationship. 
By film's end, so many concepts and plot twists have been thrown our
way that we're left dizzy at best. The final shot is a feast for the
eyes and ears, but Fincher denies us what Jack wants and periodically
achieves: catharsis. Fight Club is a darkly comic work of crazed
genius (I'd call it cinematic pop art), but its punches aim for the
head, not the heart.

Title
Review for Vita č bella, La (1997)
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (LA VITA Č BELLA) **** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
[For past reviews, bi-weekly trivia, etc., visit
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/ ]
starring Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio Cantarini, Giustino
Durano
screenplay by Roberto Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami
directed by Roberto Benigni
At last May's Cannes' awards ceremony, hyphenate Benigni-whose LIFE IS
BEAUTIFUL had just won the Grand Jury Prize-jumped from his seat, bowed
at jury president Martin Scorsese's feet, and danced around the stage
with tears in his eyes. It was a rare moment of humour at the stuffy,
elitist festival, and his reaction instantly disarmed a deadly serious
audience. In short, for a few brief moments he turned Cannes into
something it arguably had never been before: funny and sweet. His film
pulls off a similar magic trick: LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is a bittersweet
comedy that takes place (mostly) in a concentration camp.
Benigni stars as Guido, a clever and warm Jewish-Italian waiter who
relentlessly pursues "princess" Dora (Braschi) until she can no longer
resist him; within a few years, they are married and with child, the
inquisitive Giosué (Cantarini). But not long after Guido also realizes
his dream of opening a bookstore is he herded, along with his son and
uncle (Durano), to the camps. (Loving Dora, whose heritage allows her to
stay behind, joins them anyway.)
Guido wants to protect Giosué from the horrible truth, so he tells his
son that they are players of a complex game: the winner gets to ride in
a tank! (I loved the moment when Guido voluntarily mistranslates a
barking soldier's orders just so he can establish a set of "rules": no
talking, hide from the mean-looking men in uniforms, and don't ask for
sandwiches.) The boy's eventual suspicions force Guido to cover up his
lies with more lies: one brilliant sequence has Giosué disguised as a
German boy so he can enjoy a big fancy dinner at which Guido has been
asked to wait tables-Giosué has no idea how close he comes to being
killed after accidentally applauding his meal in Italian.
The first third of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is very whimsical; nothing prepares
us for its narrative's left turn. Benigni moves with the grace of Fred
Astaire, can take a pratfall like Buster Keaton, and at times his verbal
pitter-patter is a one-man Abbott and Costello routine; Benigni is the
current clown prince of cinema. (Is it any wonder Blake Edwards tried to
revive the Pink Pather series with Benigni as the son of Inspector
Clouseau?) It is thanks to Benigni's benign performance (his eyes
project nothing but sincerity) that not one second of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL
is maudlin or cloying; that said, I can't imagine a person unmoved by
the film's ending. Guido is a completely unselfish man who simply
utilizes his gifts to make the best of the worst situation. He does what
many a father would do, and the climax drives that point home.
Before the haunting LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL took home its Cannes award (it
also recently won the Toronto International Film Festival's Audience
Award), there was speculation that its subject matter might stir up
controversy. By now, I'm sure the unanimously positive reaction to the
film has quelled the Jewish community's (among others) fears; LIFE IS
BEAUTIFUL does not make light of the holocaust whatsoever. Instead, it
embraces the bravery of its victims, and educates its audience through
truly accessible characters.

Title
Review for Ice Storm, The (1997)
starring Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, Christina Ricci, Sigourney Weaver,
Tobey Maguire
written by James Schamus, based on Rick Moody's novel
directed by Ang Lee
Allow me, for a few sentences, to slam PLAYING GOD, the new David
Duchovny vehicle, for there is a relative purpose. Both PLAYING GOD
and THE ICE STORM begin with narration, but the only the latter gets
it right. In GOD, Duchovny blandly sets up the tale over the opening
titles in voice over, telling us that he's a doctor, that he's had his
license suspended because of a drug addiction, that he's going to the
nightclub we're craning down on to score some drugs, and that
sometimes life throws curve balls. What follows is this: a scene in
which David Duchovny buys drugs; a scene in which Duchovny is thrown a
curve ball (he performs emergency surgery in the nightclub); a scene
in which Duchovny does drugs; and a flashback in which Duchovny screws
up an operation. So, if we were going to see all of that, anyway, why
did first time hack Andy Wilson choose to have his lead spell it out
for us? The answer, dare I venture, lies within the hearts of bad
directors, who believe the audiences are as stupid as themselves.
THE ICE STORM, on the other, begins with young actor Tobey Maguire
sitting on an empty, stopped train reading a comic book, at which
point his voice over kicks in.  Poetically, he compares family life to
"The Fantastic Four", without giving away a single moment of what
we're about to see. So there, the most tired, lazy device in motion
pictures doesn't have to be tired and lazy; narration can tell us what
the picture's about without telegraphing the plot.
Many such moments in THE ICE STORM are poetic. The story takes place
in 1973, at the sunset of the sexual revolution. Kline plays the
harried husband of Allen (who is excellent as a frigid wife and mother
again, but it's time to stretch those acting muscles) and father of
two (Ricci and Maguire). While he spends his days in the bed of the
also- cheating neighbour Weaver, his children begin to adopt similar
behaviour. Ricci is a sexually adventurous fourteen-year-old who
flirts with both of Weaver's sons (Adam Hann-Bird and Elijah
Wood). His son is away at private school hatching a plan to bed the
class beauty before his studlier roommate does.
Their actions are motivated by more than their libido, however. There
is a shared desperation for communication and contact among them,
paralyzed by their own unhappiness in the "perfect" suburban
neighbourhood. Despite its subject matter, THE ICE STORM never lapses
into satire nor does it mock its characters, even as it gently pokes
fun at their various predicaments. Suburbia in most films, like EDWARD
SCISSORHANDS or WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, is portrayed as a white
picket fence surrounding a dozen Addams families. THE ICE STORM is
less eager to impress us with quirky kinfolk; it places the two
neighbouring families under a microscope and asks us to perform our
own examinations.
So subtly portrayed are these characters, so evenly directed is this
film, that I found myself appreciating the experience of watching it,
even if I wasn't bedazzled by it at the moment.  This is the kind of
film that gets under your skin; the next morning it was all I could
think about. Even the downplayed tragedy of the ending--the effects of
the titular storm-- seemed twice as powerful the next day.
THE ICE STORM upstages all movies about dysfunctional families because
it's unself- conscious. Witty without being jokey, sad without being
blatently tearjerking, this is the sort of film that may be so
realistic and unforgiving audiences will stay away in droves.

Review for Limey, The (1999)
THE LIMEY *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (limey@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Terrence Stamp, Peter Fonda, Lesley Ann Warren, Luis Guzman
screenplay by Lem Dobbs
directed by Steven Soderbergh
If your story's villain isn't particularly heinous, give him/her a tic
or habit; at the very least, annoy us. The Limey's bad guy, a record
producer who goes by the lone title Valentine (Fonda), is always
inspecting his teeth and checking his gums with a Sulca brush.
(Irritatingly so.) He likes to show off his pearly whites. 
Wilson (Stamp), a "limey", wants to wipe that smile off his face. Upon
release from an English prison, Wilson ventures to California in
pursuit of Valentine, his daughter Jenny's killer. He's a Cockney
shark out for vengeance, matter-of-fact tough and unafraid. The movie
began for me when the sixty-something Wilson took out a factory full
of thugs with his pistol-after they beat him up. The Limey is about an
absentee father's ("I watched her grow up...in increments," he tells a
friend) search for redemption through violence. He will deny his own
physical pain until his task is finished.
When he first arrives in L.A., Wilson hooks up with Ed (Luis Guzmán),
the man who informed him, through letters to his cellblock, of Jenny's
demise. (Ed, an ex-con himself, met her in an acting class.) In a
refreshing change of pace, Valentine's henchmen leave Ed alone-no
surprise visits in the middle of the night, no car bombs, no
kidnapping Ed's loved ones... That wimpy Valentine is a bundle of
nerves when he finds out about Wilson also impressed me. "Oh man, I'm
screwed," he wails to Avery, his head of security (Barry Newman).
Avery and Wilson are about the same age; it'll be an interesting
fight.
The plot avoids Death Wish parallels at every turn. The filmmakers
even manage some wry commentary on moviemaking that doesn't feel
imposed upon the material. (Can a California-set tale avoid mention of
Hollywood?) The obvious culture clash between Wilson and the
L.A.-types (Bill Duke's policeman responds to one of Wilson's frantic
monologues, "The one thing I don't understand is every motherfucking
thing you just said") is handled coolly-without overplaying it,
Soderbergh lets us know that we've never seen a character like Wilson
in a film like this before.
Soderbergh got carried away in the editing room, however. Imagine an
entire motion picture structured the way his brilliant, dual-timeline
love scene montage was in Out of Sight. I was distracted to the point
of contention at several points in The Limey by cinematic technique.
(Sometimes, four or five scenes are happening at once, though the
narrative magically remains coherent.) I must write that Stamp's
mesmerizing performance eventually drew me back in, every time. I
guess I prefer so-called invisible cutting.  
I was rooting for the cold yet sympathetic Wilson, perhaps because he
speaks just like my grandfather. (Though I pitied poor, just plain
pathetic Valentine.) Stamp wraps his lips around every syllable, drops
letters from the beginnings or the ends of words, and has a whole
dictionary of unfamiliar slang. (For a sampling, visit the film's
official website by clicking here.) 
With ingenuity, Soderbergh integrates footage of Stamp for flashback
purposes from an early Ken Loach effort called Poor Cow. Stamp seems
so genuine as Wilson that we feel as if we've never seen him act
before, that these snippets of a 1967 drama are photographed memories
of the character in his youth.

Review for I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998)
I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER *1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(Enter the I REALLY DO STILL POSITIVELY KNOW WHAT YOU DID TWO SUMMERS
BEFORE LAST SUMMER contest at Film Freak Central!
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers
Mind the furniture!)
It seems like I'm reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly
basis now. Scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on
burying into the ground again-the serial killers in these new slasher
movies have nothing on Sony and Miramax in the "relentless"
department. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is a terrible film
in many respects, but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad Urban
Legend, it's Citizen Hook. 
Jennifer Love-Hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager Julie
James-who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie
by...waking up. She lives in fear of Ben Willis, the vengeful
fisherman-victim of a hit and run by Julie and her pals. Paranoid and
beat, she accepts a free trip to the Bahamas from her friend Karla
(Norwood), winner of the local radio station's 4th of July getaway
giveaway. Bikini-ready Julie invites boyfriend Ray (Prinze, Jr.),
who-and here's the movie's biggest mystery-TURNS HER DOWN, but changes
his mind and plans to surprise her before take-off. Until he gets a
roadside visit from Captain Hell-liner himself, that is. Unaware of
this and feeling shunned, Julie goes on vacation, anyway, with Karla,
Karla's boyfriend (Pfeiffer), and Will (Matthew Settle), a real
boy-next-door type who's sweet on Julie. 
To make a long story short-I can't believe it took a paragraph to
describe the set-up for this gratuitous sequel-the trip is a disaster.
Not only is it storm season, not only is the desk clerk (The
Frighteners' Jeffrey Combs) a jerk, not only are the few island
residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the
resourceful Willis one-by-one, but the Karaoke machine isn't working
properly! (You think killing is hard? Try reprogramming a LaserDisc so
that Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive" now contains the lyric "I still
know what you did last summer!") All is not lost-Ray is on his way to
save the day, and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for
Julie and co. 
This picture is really about breasts: two of them. Julie, like a good
horror heroine, never does up her shirt to the collar, always wears
white in the rain, and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden
desire to tan. Based on the hormonal charge I got out of the movie, I
can't imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next
to me-he gets Jennifer Love-Hewitt, and my generation got Heather
Langenkamp! Lucky bastard. 
I didn't like I Know What You Did Last Summer and I can't say I liked
this continuation any more or less. The pacing in both films is
languid-how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor
character development? I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has a
better sense of humour than the first one, though, and at least it
explains away Willis's random selection of victims. (I don't think the
hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what Julie did
last summer.) Director Cannon (Judge Dredd) is a competent filmmaker
but not a particularly imaginative one-if there is a part three (what
on Earth would they call it?), and the fun denouement suggests there
will be, here's my suggestion: hire a filmmaker with flair, someone
who can really energize this stillborn series-someone who won't rely
on so many shock notes. And let that person run wild with the camera.
(Aside: if Blandy [sic] must appear in the next one, try to keep the
number of times she says "baby" to a minimum. Thanks in advance.) 

Title
Review for Dogma (1999)
DOGMA *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Linda Fiorentino, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris Rock
written and directed by Kevin Smith
Linda Fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded
turn in the cable pic The Last Seduction, and her being cast as
Dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable. She's still in fine
form as Bethany, an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith. One
night, a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in Bethany's
bedroom. He is Metatron (Alan Rickman), the voice of God, and he needs
her help: she must stop two fallen angels from entering a New Jersey
church-the fate of the universe depends on it. God would do it
Him/Herself, but He/She is...missing, having taken up human form
somewhere on Earth never to be heard from again.
Bethany is joined on her road trip to the Garden State by the
"prophets" Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith, doing
double-duty), the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of
Smith's films thus far. At some point, Rock drops naked out of the sky
as Rufus, the undocumented (and very black) "thirteenth apostle", and
offers his assistance, as does divine stripper Serendipity (Salma
Hayek). It's a wild ride.
They're in pursuit of Loki and Bartleby (Damon and Affleck,
respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been), who
were banished from heaven to Wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic
loophole that will enable their return. Loki decides to wreak havoc
along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the
pearly gates. At one point, he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits
with an angry combination of words and bullets. It's a nasty, guiltily
enjoyable little scene that asks, "How corrupt are you?".
Wings of Desire this ain't.
Since debuting with Clerks, Smith has grown as a director,
particularly in terms of working with actors. (Chris Rock is this
film's only weak link-between jokes, he's wooden.) His no-frills
visual style hasn't changed much over the years, though (Dogma's
widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations), nor
has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one
caustic, hilarious speech after another. Dogma chips
away at big religious issues-namely, the hypocrisy that accompanies
any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately, but a few
of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition. As well, the
verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever.
Any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time
maintaining momentum (Hurlyburly, anyone?), and eventually Dogma's
pacing goes slack. A long diatribe from Bartleby late in the game, in
which he laments the destiny of celestial beings, comes at a point
when we've heard enough. Because his change of heart (Bartleby is
initially the good cop to Loki's bad) drives the climax, said rant is
given a great deal of screen time. Sure, Affleck deserved a big moment
(Damon steals their scenes together prior), but it ultimately makes
the film and us feel bloated.
Like Tarantino, Smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad
indie filmmaker. Dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch
of movies, including Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, with Silent
Bob doing his best Harrison Ford, and Weird Science-a shit demon
attacks our heroes! Smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour: his
dexterous maneuvering between the satirical (a Cardinal played by
George Carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan
"Catholicism Wow!") and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of
comedy will leave Dogma feeling malnourished. I bust(ed?) a gut on
several occasions. Proceedings also get off on the right foot with the
opening with the funniest disclaimer ever.
It's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease, for to read it,
one actually has to see Dogma. The prerelease ballyhoo is in the
tradition of The Last Temptation of Christ's, Martin Scorsese's
1988 adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis' controversial novel, in that it
is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and
heresy. There's a famous anecdote about Fletch director Michael
Ritchie inviting picketers of The Last Temptation of Christ into a
screening on his dime, just so they could know for certain what they
were rallying against. (Not one of them had watched it.) Every single
person refused.
Smith and Scorsese have a lot in common, and so do the two films in
question, because both Smith's Bethany and Scorsese's Jesus are hollow
shells without their faith. In fact, Dogma's denouement (which follows
a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait) is a Catholic love-in, a
veritable recruitment poster. (I felt sentimental about a religion I
don't belong to. Now that's powerful filmmaking.) Smith is nothing if
not sincere about his own devotion to God, and that spirituality
shines through. It's enough to make me forgive Dogma for its editorial
sins.
My religion is movies. When the Catholic League beats on Dogma
for imaginary crimes against a doctrine, in a roundabout way they're
attacking what I live for: freedom of expression through celluloid. I
therefore feel that, although I'm no Bible-thumper, I'm at least as
qualified to criticize Dogma as William Donohue and his followers.

Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
THE PHANTOM MENACE **˝ (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( starwars@filmfreakcentral.net )
(For more critiques you'll disagree with, visit Film Freak Central:
http://filmfreakcentral.net
Bring a friend!)
starring Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd
written and directed by George Lucas
I want this review of Star Wars: Episode 1  The Phantom Menace to
stand out from the pack you've been reading, so I will forgo my
typical essay-style approach and discuss the film in bits and pieces.
I can't promise not to spoil anything, but I will do my best to avoid
giving too much away.
Menace takes us back three or four decades before the original Star
Wars (A New Hope to us dweebs). It is the story of Qui-Gon Jinn, a
rebellious Jedi master who becomes, along with his pupil Obi-Wan
Kenobi, embroiled in a trade war. The plot seems vaguely modeled on
The Last of The Mohicans': Qui-Gon plays reluctant guard to nobility
(including Queen Amidala) as he treks a path to freedom; his band is
pursued by the Magua-esque Darth Maul, a bloodthirsty aide to the
Trade Federation. The similarities to James Fenimore Cooper's tale end
at the point when Qui-Gon stops on Tattooine for vessel repairs and
discovers a preternatural little slaveboy possessed of rare mental and
physical gifts. Qui-Gon swears the kid,  Anakin Skywalker, is "the
chosen one," the future Jedi who will bring balance to the force. He
even stakes his (shaky) reputation on it before the Council, which is
headed by Yoda and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson in a cameo).
Qui-Gon, who stands tall, walks swiftly and speaks softly, is the most
compelling new presence in the Star Wars universe. Liam Neeson's
performance recalls the authority of Alec Guiness in the later films,
which is most appropriate, given that Guiness portrayed the mature
Obi-Wan-it's now as if Qui-Gon's self-confidence rubbed off on Obi-Wan
more than any other aspect of his training. Lloyd also shines,
especially in his scenes with Yoda and company; he has a sweet and
innocent face, but there's a trace enough of mischief in his narrow
eyes to leave no doubt this cherubic munchkin will one day submit to
his darkest urges. Jar Jar Binks ("Stomp" dancer Ahmed Best), the
rabbit-eared, six-foot reptile (part of a race called the Gungan) who
follows Qui-Gon around like a loyal servant (and talks like the
stereotypical plantation worker, circa 1800s, an attribute sure to
rankle those members of the black population who already feel
misrepresented in the original trilogy), sporadically amuses but
mostly annoys, especially with his inept soldier schtick during the
climactic battle between the Gungan and hordes of Battle Droids.
(While I'm on the subject of droids, C-3PO and R2-D2 make curiously
perfunctory appearances in The Phantom Menace-though they normally
supply the comic relief, only Jar Jar's theatrics are mined for laughs
this time around.)
Also of note are Portman, McGregor, and Ian McDiarmid. The former
plays surely the most beautiful queen in any galaxy-with or without
the Kabuki make-up, she glows like a young Audrey Hepburn, but
Princess Leia she's not. Amidala is ballsy but lacks the sauciness
that endeared Leia to little girls (and, yes, little boys) across the
world. McGregor is marginally more successful as the eager Obi-Wan,
but he is more or less a walking action figure, someone who asks a lot
of questions mostly for the sake of nudging us into the next sequence.
Finally, McDiarmid, as Senator Palpatine, brought a smile to my face
whenever he was on screen; whether by virtue of some fine acting or
the knowledge that Palpatine eventually becomes the dreaded Emperor, I
cannot say.
Perhaps the most disappointing character in Menace is Darth Maul. Fans
have hitched their wagon to the wrong train, it seems (Maul was the
most popular costume at the midnight premiere, and products bearing
his likeness are the best selling Menace merchandise so far), for Maul
is no less robotic than the machines who fight for his cause. His
entire persona is summed up by his double-bladed lightsaber: cool at
first, silly upon reflection.
Lucas didn't want to make another Star Wars movie until CGI equipment
caught up with his imagination. Indeed, Menace is
brimming-overstuffed-with special effects whose detail is impressive.
Yet there's nothing sparklingly original about them, especially
concerning the animated beings. Star Wars and Star Trek share a common
flaw in their creature design. As weird as the bodies and skins get,
the aliens of both galaxies usually have humanoid faces: two eyes, a
nose, and a mouth. Lucas also continues a trend begun in his
refurbished editions of episodes 4, 5, and 6: the monsters of Episode
1 are clownish or juvenile (the appearance of a small Greedo-type
recalls Jim Henson's "Muppet Babies") and, dare I say it, uniquely
synthetic. While the technology now allows for a group of
computer-generated Gungans to flop around like so many Stephen
Fetchits, I still find digital flesh, ninety percent of the time,
thoroughly unconvincing. (The wisest directorial decision Lucas made
was to  have Yoda return in all his foam rubber glory, replete with
strategically placed props to disguise puppeteer Frank Oz.)
More successful are the CGI cityscapes of Couriscant and Naboo, as
well as the many interiors and exteriors of ships. In fact, most of,
if not all, of the non-creature F/X work is breathtaking enough to
give pause to the most jaded viewers.
The myriad explosions and close-calls and laser blasts do tend to
overwhelm Menace's narrative, but it's safe to say that Lucas is a
solid enough filmmaker that he pulls off the Pandemonium with much
more grace than we're accustomed to seeing in summer pictures of this
sort. Yes, we're dealing with a different George Lucas than the one
who made Star Wars back in 1977-that director had budgetary
restrictions imposed on him that really taxed his imagination. The
trash compactor  sequence in Episode IV, so basic it could easily be
duplicated by enterprising teenaged videomakers, holds more suspense
than any similar moment in Menace. ('90s Lucas is also the parent of a
preschooler, and therefore eager to please all ages.) Sometimes, less
is more. Why mince words? Less is always more. That's also why a
simple breathing appartus used by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan for an
underwater jaunt in Menace fascinates more than the complicated
machinery on display, because it's the kind of goofy prop one might
find in schlocky B-movie serials, one of Lucas' obvious inspirations.
I'm tempted to say The Phantom Menace is uninspired, but it's not. I'm
tempted to say it's uninvolving, but it's far from that. The movie is
burdened with having to lay the groundwork not only for two
hypothetical movies, but a completed series of beloved films, and the
best scenes in Menace (the Jedi Council conferences; Obi-Wan's big
number) indicate that episodes two and three will be more stimulating
affairs. I'd have to say it's a better picture than Return of the
Jedi, but falls into the same third-act trap of juxtaposing a terrific
swordfight with boring, slapstick scenes of combat.
Ultimately, I'd like to see The Phantom Menace again, because there is
so much to drink in. If I have some advice for Lucas it is this: for
the sequel (read: second prequel), write and write and write until
you've defined your characters, because (as any true fan will agree)
it was the rock-solid personalities of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker,
Princess Leia, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2-and the chemsitry between
them-that endeared the Star Wars trilogy to audiences, not nifty
production values.

Review for Bully (2001)
-a review by Bill Chambers | bill@filmfreakcentral.net
***For more film, DVD and books about movie reviews, plus annual coverage 
of The Toronto International Film Festival, visit _Film Freak Central_ - 
http://filmfreakcentral.net  | Now with search engine***
An authority figure speaks the defining line of dialogue in _Bully_, Larry 
Clark's quasi-sequel to his own hotly contested _Kids_ "I don't know what 
you're up to. I don't think I want to know." Often accused, even with only 
three motion pictures under his belt, of over-sensationalizing already 
sensationalistic material, Clark is hardly the next Oliver Stone; he is 
something of an interfering observer, but not a conspiracy proselytizer 
running with scissors down the hallway. Where Stone drew slave parallels to 
football in _Any Given Sunday_ by intercutting clips from _Ben-Hur_, Clark 
makes more organic shock statements. He can be tactless, sure. Can't we all?
The scene from _Bully_ that's causing a ruckus features the flip single 
mother played by Bijou Phillips on the phone in a salon while getting a 
pedicure. As her conversation winds down, we get a leering close-up of her 
crotch. As the vantage point of the pedicurist, it's not an entirely 
illogical insert, and with Phillips sitting there spread-eagle, the shot 
has overtones of the hetero male audience's telepathic projection. If Larry 
Clark were younger (he's 58), cleaner (he spent a lot of the 
post-production time on his _Another Day in Paradise_ in rehab), and not a 
professional voyeur of teenagers (numerous acclaimed photo essays about the 
youth scene got him a movie career), _Bully_ would've turned out different, 
but do his age and experiences mean he's a dirty old man or on to us and 
exposing our hypocritical indignation? If hatchling _American Pie_ 
directors the Weitz brothers were Clark's age, they probably still would've 
emerged unscathed from showing Shannon Elizabeth nude for the duration of a 
genre-cushioned sequence that is, I dare say, less forgivable than _Bully_ 
at its most button-pushing. Think about it a guy asks a girl (Elizabeth) 
whose English isn't so good over to his house and, knowing that she'll need 
to change clothing once there, surreptitiously videotapes her getting 
undressed and enables his friends to watch via the Internet--and we're cued 
to laugh.
What continues to appal me about _Bully_ is but a by-product of the film 
its raw depiction of sex has overshadowed an incendiary act of violence 
around which everything else orbits. That I am forced to address a glimpse 
of pubic hair ahead of manslaughter officially confirms the reversal of 
western society's hedonistic poles, and casts a doubtful shadow over my own 
sexually curious teen years. I encountered no more over-the-top knee-jerk 
reaction than these odious reader comments that Dave Poland published last 
Wednesday
"'_Bully_' is perverted for no reason I could figure out except to satisfy 
Mr. Clark's old man obsession with young people's bodies. He seems to leer 
on the actors for no reason at all and even the younger, often shirtless, 
boys like Marty's brother came across as victims of some kind of unseemly 
voyeurism and I felt dirty for being a part of it. I'm about as far away 
from being a prude as you can [sic] but this movie just felt wrong."
_Bully_ takes place in Florida, in the middle of summer. To this 
self-declared non-prude (David nicknamed him "Not Fester") I ask, what 
would a boy who is anything but shirtless be doing in Florida on a hot 
summer's day? Because DVD commentary on _Another Day in Paradise_ indicates 
that Steven Spielberg is the bane of Clark's existence, I wonder how 
squirmy the idiotic Not Fester got when a gaggle of half-naked 
pre-adolescents ogled Haley Joel Osment in Spielberg's recent A.I. 
Artificial Intelligence. Not Fester's common alloy of anatomical shame and 
political paranoia will soon castrate artistic expression altogether.
Based on a true story, though muted, in some way, by homogenizing the races 
of the actual participants, _Bully_ stars the alluring Seth Green-David 
Spade fusion Nick Stahl in the title role as the abusive, college-bound 
best friend of spacey surfer Marty (the frequently touching Brad Renfro, a 
co-producer). Marty's girlfriend, Lisa (ex-Macaulay Culkin Rachel Miner), 
grows tired of the perennially looming black cloud that is Stahl's Bobby 
and rallies the troops to kill him; she's also pregnant with either Marty 
or Bobby's child (the latter would be by rape), and seems to believe that 
Bobby's death would rule him out as the biological father. The 
protagonists' relentless, veracious witlessness is hopefully more 
unsettling than the film's explicit nature; in the case of the stoners, we 
sense a façade, and wonder if they ever inhale. (Michael Pitt's performance 
is one rife with subtext in that regard, but also so off-putting as to 
discourage repeat viewings.) Like Clark's _Kids_, the crackling 
conversation piece _Bully_ will serve parents better than it does their 
offspring because one can't see the forest through the trees. Have I 
mentioned that Bobby, however repellent, is the film's most sympathetic 
character? Go with an open mind.

Review for Rushmore (1998)
Max Fischer, a fifteen year old student of Rushmore Academy, puts down
his newspaper and makes his way to the chalkboard, at which point he
deftly answers an impossible mathematical puzzle. His classmates applaud
his genius.
And then Max wakes up, having dozed off during a school assembly. A new
lecturer is introduced-Herman Blume, a low-key tycoon whose bizarre but
inspired speech prevents Max from falling back to sleep. Blume will
become his idol, and everywhere I was convinced Rushmore was going from
that obvious opening sequence the filmmakers avoid like the plague. The
movie is anything but predictable, and nothing less than brilliant, a
comic masterpiece that would win Best Picture in a perfect world.
Max's grades are dropping, but he dedicates himself to extracurricular
activities-over fifty of them, in fact. (His favourite is Drama Club;
his plays are hysterically funny in their earnestness.) Rushmore is not
so much an educational institution to Max as an outlet for his
gregarious and impetuous nature. No action better demonstrates this than
his relentless pursuit of teacher Miss Rosemary Cross (radiant Williams,
permitted use of her British accent again after playing The Postman's
American girlfriend); with the assistance of steel investor Blume, Max
plans to erect a marina and dedicate it to his love interest. Rosemary
is a few years Max's senior, and a widower to boot-she barely entertains
the dreamer's affections, eventually growing to prefer the company of
Blume.
The film features a colourful bouquet of supporting characters, from
Max's trusty peewee messenger (Mason Gamble) to Seymour Cassel as Max's
barber father. (Max attends Rushmore on scholarship.) One of the real
revelations here is Murray, who has not had a part this worthy of his
talents since Groundhog Day. His comedy here is so subtle-as the
manic-depressive multi-millionaire Herman, he conveys hate for his dumb
sons with a glance, love for Rosemary with almost that same look, and
his devotion to Max-despite his age, he's tightly part of Max's circle
of friends/assistants-is endearing. One scene in particular, which could
be interpreted as Blume's suicide attempt, is inimitably riotous-his
unfiltered cyncism on display again at last.
Not to give Schwartzman the short-shrift. Where did this guy come from?
Schwartzman's performance is so pitch-perfect I wondered if Rushmore had
been written for this unknown, Hollywood's Best Kept Secret. (The answer
is, "no," according to director Anderson.) Further research uncovered
that Schwartzman is the son of Talia Shire (Rocky's Adrian-and sister to
Francis Coppola). No other member of Schwartzman's legendary family has
hit it so thoroughly out of the park the first time at bat. He has none
of DiCaprio's androgyny, Renfro's handsomeness, or Taylor-Thomas's
smugness holding him back-meet the anti-teen idol, and revel in this
young actor's inspiring debut.
Congratulations to Anderson, Wilson (who can be seen as the blonde guy
in Armageddon), and co. for crafting a surprisingly confident, utterly
unique comedy that's thrilling in its inventiveness and heart-warming in
its sweetness of tone. (Though I was disappointed by their previous
effort, the aimless Bottle Rocket, both movies demonstrate what hopeless
romantics Anderson and Wilson are.) If there's an adjective I've missed,
feel free to add it-just thinking about Rushmore reconfirms my faith in
modern cinema.

Review for Lethal Weapon 4 (1998)
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers
New address. Same old attitude. Don't forget to recommend a film,
read the journal, or send me some of that nasty HATE MAIL.)
In the first Lethal Weapon, Mel Gibson's character Martin Riggs would
break into "Three Stooges" routines and
handcuff himself to suicidal jumpers-these were actions meant to
characterize an insane, unstable human being.
They called him a "lethal weapon"; he had a death wish for both anyone
who crossed him and, most importantly, for
himself. 1998 brings us LETHAL WEAPON 4 and the plot itself has become
something of a Three Stooges routine,
with Gibson, Glover (as Roger "Too Old For This Shit" Murtaugh) and
Pesci (as opportunistic Leo Getz) doing
everything but bashing each other with sledge hammers and "nyuk
nyuk"-ing. It is precisely for this reason that
some will dismiss or dislike LETHAL WEAPON 4, while others will find
comfort in its familiarity and congenial
tone.
While fishing one night, said lethal trio encounter a slave ship;
naturally, a gunfight ensues, with Triad members
protecting their boatload of Chinese immigrants. Riggs and
Murtaugh-promoted to police captains this time
around-eventually uncover a secret: Chinese families are being traded as
slaves in some sort of underground
operation in Los Angeles' Chinatown district. Murtaugh elects to hide
one of the families at his house until the case
is solved, which triggers a chain reaction of violence. Wah Sing Ku (Jet
Li) pursues Murtaugh and his stolen family;
Ku employs lightning-fast Martial Arts moves as well as a team of
shameless yes-men who strike at the captains in
water, on land, and in water again. Meanwhile, Murtaugh's daughter is
pregnant (Murtaugh doesn't know the baby
belongs to Lee Butters (Rock), a detective who gamely joins the
investigation), as is Gibson's girlfriend (Rene
Russo, kicking up a storm as she did in the last instalment, even whilst
bearing a child).
Jet Li moves with such speed and grace his movements almost provoke
laughter in the fight scenes: since Riggs
and Murtaugh are no match for Ku, the hand-to-hand combat plays like
slapstick. I was reminded of that Bugs
Bunny cartoon in which Bugs gets into a ring with a heavyweight boxer
(or is it wrestler?) and wins because he
better understands the laws of cartoon physics; likewise, Gibson and
Glover exercise enough movie-logic-and
they have the benefit of three prequels under their belt-to put up a
good fight. The action scenes (which also
include Riggs riding a coffee table-yes, coffee table-along the L.A.
Freeway as he is dragged by a truck) are
thrilling and inventive and satisfyingly ludicrous, but they seem like
an afterthought. Whenever the banter runs on
too long, something blows up. This isn't a problem, really, since the
banter is relaxed, cute, and, despite the
presence of much profanity, harmless. Gone is the dark heart of Lethal
Weapon 2; director Donner has turned the
franchise into something of a Sunday dinner-is it any wonder he included
photos of the cast and crew goofing
around off-camera as part of the end-credit sequence? Rock makes a nice
addition to the cast, but Pesci has worn
out his welcome. He's a terrific actor, but his performance has
degenerated over three movies into a one-note
impersonation of his original portrayal of Leo Getz. He has a nice
moment at the end of the picture, delivering a
sweet monologue, but it's too little, too late. Jet Li, on the other
hand, is a charismatic presence. I hope his
inevitable journey through the Hollywood machine lands him a film in
which he has a worthy opponent and a decent
screenplay supporting him.
Some critics have complained that LETHAL WEAPON 4 is completely
extraneous, that it has nothing to say. Did
this series ever have something to say? I for one fell in with its tone
and rolled with it-the worst scene in this movie
is better than the best scene in, say, Armageddon or Godzilla. Yet I'm
not exactly thrilled with the prospect of
LETHAL WEAPON 5; everyone involved really is getting too old for this
shit.

Title
Review for General, The (1998)
After a screening of The General, I was approached by a journalist from
Ireland who told me how much his people loathed professional thief
Martin Cahill. Boorman's take on Cahill's life is sympathetic, but it
hardly glorifies the crook's existence. (The more powerful Cahill
becomes, the more he acts like a shut-in.) According to said journalist,
it might upset certain moviegoers in his homeland for its humane
treatment of Cahill, but after considering the film carefully, they'll
conclude the same thing he did: there just isn't any other way to tell
the story.
The picture opens with an innovative flashback technique: Cahill
(Gleeson) gets up in the morning, goes to his car, and before he can
pull out into the street, he is shot by a stranger-at which point the
images literally start moving in reverse; the bullet is ushered back
into the barrel of the gun, and we are transported to a time when Cahill
was a young lad (here portrayed ably The Butcher Boy's Eamonn Owens-talk
about type-casting) who robbed local markets to feed his hungry family.
Later, in a reformatory, a priest attempts to molest him-adolescent
Cahill defends himself, and is punished with slaps from the pious
pedophile. (For the rest of the film, whenever confronting figures of
authority, Cahill shields his face with his hands, skulking into a fetal
position as if trying to slide right out of his skin.)
Despite the constant threat of imprisonment from Police Inspector Ned
Kenny (Voight), Cahill does little to correct his rebellious ways. He is
married to the loving Francis (Kennedy) but openly carries on an affair
with her sister, Tina (Angeline Ball)-he even fathers a boy with her.
Meanwhile, he and his gang of affable hoods move from petty larceny to a
jewelry store heist and the theft of a priceless Vermeer painting. (His
innocent appreciation of art would disturb collectors, as he treats said
piece like a carnival poster.) Throughout, Cahill's disposition remains
the same: non-chalant, sometimes arrogant, but he never forgets his
roots. (A T-shirt adorned with cartoon pigs remains his preferred attire
even with millions in gold bricks at his disposal.)
The General was shot in black and white, and it's unforgiving in its
physical observation of these characters' craggy, lived-in faces. Seamus
Deasy's cinematography glamourizes Cahill and co. no more than Boorman's
script. Cahill was not Pretty Boy Floyd, after all; the possible key to
his adult behaviour is revealed when the townspeople applaud young
Martin's antics: here's a man who just wants to feel like a hero to a
community, no matter how small that community becomes. He fancies
himself a modern day Robin Hood-stealing from the rich but for the sake
of theatrics and not any sort of noble cause. Father to one, husband to
two, gang leader, and number one threat to Kenny's ego, Cahill was
ultimately just a son of a bitch who got carried away-few people had the
guts to rein him in. I grew to like Cahill the movie character as I
suspect I would grow to like many an outlaw in real life, because of his
conviction. Gleeson's performance is a marvel, the sort of seamless,
un-showy turn that goes largely unrewarded by the populace. By all
accounts, his impersonation of Cahill's ticks and mannerisms are
pinpoint accurate.
Deliverance aside, Boorman had until now not made a truly complete and
humane film. (Is it any coincidence that he and Voight, the star of
Deliverance, reunited for what might prove to be Boorman's best work?)
Perhaps all those years of editing Britain's "Projections" anthologies
have made him a more thoughtful filmmaker. Towards the end of the film,
Cahill and his son have the kind of moment many a Hollywood crime drama
wouldn't think to include-The General is like a pastiche of those bits
between killings that all too often hit the cutting room floor.

Title
Review for Simple Plan, A (1998)
Scott Smith's novel A Simple Plan was overrated, a humourless
modern-day, snowbound gloss on "Macbeth" with an unsatisfying ending.
How surprising it is, then, that Smith's own screenplay adaptation of
the same material is a rich and emotional modern-day, snowbound gloss on
"Macbeth". Raimi, creator of such frenetic cult films as Evil Dead, Evil
Dead 2, and Darkman, strapped himself in a strait-jacket to direct A
Simple Plan, a leisurely-paced thriller that has much in common with
friend Joel Coen's restrained Fargo.
It is a quiet winter in a small Midwestern town. Lou (Briscoe) and
brothers Hank (Paxton) and Jacob (Thornton) Mitchell happen upon a
crashed airplane during a hunting trip. The pilot is already a feast for
the vultures, and a bag of money sits unclaimed on the floor beside him.
The three men decide to take the money-$4.4 million-and keep their
discovery a secret; they will split the money only after the spring
thaw, once the plane is recovered by authorities and any inquiries about
the money have been dismissed. The trouble is, Jacob and Lou are close
to destitute and willing to break the pact, and Hank's own very pregnant
and very greedy wife (Fonda) finds out about the loot, too.
Even if you've read the book, A Simple Plan offers many surprises. (The
movie's climax is much stronger.) An obvious and tired maguffin, the old
briefcase full of money routine, seems fresh and original here. That's
because this time out, the people who after the dough are genuine
sympathetic sadsacks-candidates for an episode of Springer. Danny
Boyle's Shallow Grave featured a similar set-up (albeit within the cosy
confines of a London flat), but his characters were morally bankrupt
from the get-go-they mistreated each other out of pure, undiluted
avarice. A Simple Plan's trio of thieves lead generally miserable lives;
if they can get past their initial hunger for the cash, they might just
have a chance at saving themselves from a life of disconsolation.
I give: the best reason to see A Simple Plan is the performance of Billy
Bob "Sling Blade" Thornton as the anemic, tormented Jacob. For about the
first third of the film, a goofy-looking Thornton functions as little
more than a punchline, cinematic punctuation to get a laugh from the
audience. Yet as the plot thickens, Thornton comes to life in one of the
most memorable supporting performances in recent years; gradually,
Thornton peels back the layers, and we get the sense that Jacob is the
less-educated but clearly smarter of the siblings. Watch the sequence
when Jacob begins to imitate Hank, mercilessly insulting him in the
process; his motivation for doing so is eventually made clear, but
Thornton never once winks' at the audience. I haven't believed a
character like this in a good long while.
Actually, Raimi yields terrific work from all his principals, and his
directorial presence is felt, if not explicitly seen (with the exception
of one gleefully gratuitous, totally shocking signature camera move). I
mentioned earlier that it recalls Fargo, and I mean in spirit, not in
tone. Both films are dark-hearted, and they share a love of the locale;
Rami's film is (surprisingly) much less jokey and less satirical. (I
loved Fargo, but it's more witty than moving.) A Simple Plan is a
less-than-mainstream suspense movie that really pays off on its
promises. Its bleakness is uninviting but worth the trek to the theatre.

Title
Review for Bowfinger (1999)
BOWFINGER *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bowfinger@filmfreakcentral.net)
(For screen, DVD, and reviews, plus cool contests, visit:
Film Freak Central - http://filmfreakcentral.net
Bring a date.)
Steve Martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking
a few years back; he spent this time writing essays and short stories
for "The New Yorker," several of which wound up in his hilarious
hardback compilation, Pure Drivel (1998). Much of the book spares
tinseltown from mockery, although he does riff on the racist comments
made by Marlon Brando during a Larry King interview, in a fine chapter
called "In Search of the Wily Filipino." Now, as writer and star of
Bowfinger, he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a
career in the cinema, perhaps finally venting the frustrations
('everything being made now is crap') that led to his brief retirement
from Hollywood.
Martin stars as Bobby Bowfinger, a Roger Corman-wannabe on the cusp of
fifty and desperate for some success as a producer, quality of the
projects be damned. His accountant (Adam Alexi-Malle) proposes a movie
called "Chubby Rain," about aliens who travel to Earth in raindrops
slightly fatter than regular raindrops. Bowfinger latches onto the
idea immediately, and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear
in the film, based on the lie that America's top box office draw, Kit
Ramsey (Murphy), has agreed to star.
Ramsey, of course, wants nothing to do with such low-grade material,
so Bowfinger, on the thinking that action stars need to run, not
speak, decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously. He sends
his cast members (who aren't in on it, either; they are told Ramsey
hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars) to
Ramsey's table at restaurants, asks them to follow him in parking
lots, etc., spouting script dialogue, all the while shooting the
outcome from a great distance. The paranoid Ramsey flees the scene
nearly every time.
Ramsey is a member of Mind Head, a cultish self-help organization
apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities. (As if that's not
familiar enough, Mind Head guru Terry Stricter (Terence Stamp) has
been dressed and combed to resemble L. Ron Hubbard, founder of
Scientology.) When he goes to Mind Head with tales of caucasian
strangers appearing from nowhere to babble "white code" in his face,
they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him
off to a retreat, requiring Bowfinger to find a stand-in.
Murphy will probably win more fans as Jiff, Ramsey's adorable,
ignoramus double, than as Kit, but it is his portrayal of the latter
that took courage. Always surrounded by an entourage, suffering from a
racial inferiority complex, Murphy plays right into the tabloid image
of himself. Furthermore, consider the enemies he'll make of popular
Scientologists. Pacing Stricter's neutral-coloured office as if on an
amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer, Ramsey is asked
to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly. Murphy's scenes with
Stamp are exactly what I imagine of a John Travolta "clearing."
Not that Murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick; Bowfinger is
Steve Martin's invention. His script is surprisingly clever as satire,
given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck, as is the entire Los
Angeles film industry. (The Griffin Mill-types take quite a beating,
in the form of Robert Downey Jr. as bigwig Jerry Renfro.) Martin's
decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder's point of view is
what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a
group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture. As
expected, there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs, such as
Martin's crew of Mexican border-jumpers, who gain unexpected
appreciation for the classics from reading "Cahiers Du Cinema," or
Martin's nonsensical explanation to Dave, his loyal cinematographer
(Jamie Kennedy), that every movie, in the end, has a budget of
two-thousand dollars (!). Most of Bowfinger is universally funny,
however; I defy any viewer to keep a straight face when Christine
Baranski, one of our brightest comediennes, is on screen.
Bowfinger's main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial
aftermath. We're also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of
Kit Ramsey would redeem "Chubby Rain," Z-grade entertainment that
would make Ed Wood blush. (This aspect of Bowfinger has much in common
with the ludicrous Oscar sequence in Oz's last directorial effort, the
poorly conceived In & Out.) These are significant enough weaknesses
that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece.
As I mentioned at the start of this review, Bowfinger offers solid
reasons not to do what Heather Graham's character Daisy does: hop a
bus to Hollywood in search of stardom. That said, it offers one
fantastic reason to get on that bus: the sense of community between
filmmakers who gel is awesome. Martin gets sentimental by story's end
as he did in L.A. Story, and how could he not? For those who can hack
it, the movies might be the greatest business in the world.

Title
Review for Beach, The (2000)
starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume
Canet
screenplay by John Hodge, based on the book by Alex Garland
directed by Danny Boyle
When we meet Richard, the U.S.-born narrator-hero of The Beach, he has
succumbed to the idea that finding adventure necessitates getting the
hell out of his homeland... drinking snake's blood and sleeping with
roaches play pleasantly into his romantic notions of danger. As he roams
the steamy streets of Bangkok in search of the next
hedonistic-masochistic delight, Richard appears oblivious to the
American infiltration of Asian culture ("The Simpsons" episodes on TV,
the constant bubblegum music sounding from ghetto blasters, etc.). The
Beach is about how we as earthlings can't escape western civilization,
and the futility of trying.
Richard is kept awake one night in his hotel by the sounds of lovemaking
(his attractive neighbour, with whom he has become infatuated, is
getting some from her boyfriend) and by the Scottish-inflected ravings
of Daffy (Robert Carlyle), a mysterious rabble-rouser who tears away at
the mesh screen of Richard's window to offer the tourist drugs and
chit-chat. Daffy recounts the pleasures of a beach he once inhabited,
part of a sun-bleached mass as yet undefiled by tourists. The following
morning, Richard discovers the suicidal storyteller's corpse along with
a hand-drawn map to the secret isle, and he enlists an eager Etienne
(Canet) and Francoise (Ledoyen), the couple next door, to join him in
retracing Daffy's path to paradise.
Said mass, it turns out, is guarded by gun-toting farmers fiercely
protective of their cannibas crops-so much for smoking pot all day, one
of Richard's loftier ambitions. The ensuing chase climaxes with the
three travelers coming to the edge of a cliff and diving off, into a
blue lagoon-the entrance to the world of their dreams. Out of harm's
way, they discover a group of European expats living in harmony,
officially seduced by the beach's white resplendence. (These villagers
have a deal with the farmers above: no more trespassers, live in peace.)
English Sal (Swinton), the casually appointed matriarch of this
microcosm, is cursorily welcoming of Richard and his friends.
Plainspoken and bossy, she assigns chores and whatnot to her people that
will keep them thriving (Richard proves himself an expert fisherman);
Swinton, who gives the film's most vibrant performance, gets to the
ruthless core of Sal quickly-she could be playing a tiger, lording over
the forest. We get the feeling that The Beach will build to a
confrontation between Richard and Sal, because her eyes are always
surveying, with a mixture of lust and venom, his very American power to
influence.
Downtime, and there is an awful lot of it, is spent by Richard drinking
in the atmosphere (handsomely captured by Seven cinematographer Darius
Khondji) and pining for the taken Francoise. And why wouldn't he? She's
gorgeous-cloning experts would be wise to sample Virginie Ledoyen's DNA
(as well as DiCaprio's, for that matter). Sadly, there's no compelling
reason for them to stay attracted to one another after an inevitable
consummation occurs. They're not very interesting as individuals-Richard
is a stock backpacker and Francoise the adorable French innocent-but as
lovers, they're totally blank pages, stuck with the label of "couple"
because relationships based solely on casual sex don't exist in the
foreground of expensive movies.
The Beach is conventional in other respects; it settles down into
something vaguely formulaic the same way Boyle's biggest hit-to-date,
Trainspotting, does after a few mindbending mock-hallucinations. There
are trippy detours throughout, most memorably when Richard pictures
himself in a cheesy videogame (battling a tiger, natch), but for the
most part, The Beach treads structural ground that was first laid by
"Lord of the Flies" and "The Mosquito Coast". A sequence in which
Richard loses his mind could be snipped without recourse, and its
omission would mean one less encumbering cliché.
Fortunately, the film's ideology is separate from the aforementioned
jungle dramas (and their screen counterparts). Director Danny Boyle,
screenwriter John Hodge (adapting a book by twentysomething Alex
Garland), and producer Andrew MacDonald, recovering nicely from A Life
Less Ordinary, have decided that utopia and the western world need not,
or cannot, be mutually exclusive. It is understood, when Richard and Sal
travel to the mainland for provisions with a grocery list of personal
requests from the islanders (for toothbrushes, dish gloves, Game Boys,
etc.), that we survivors of the twentieth century are too dependent on
stuff, i.e. the comforts of home, to enjoy "paradise" as only nature
intended.
And while it is Richard who throws the beach's societal balance out of
whack, by dumbly holding the door open for dopehead tourists, the
filmmakers don't turn his arrival at Fort Sal into an Ugly American
scenario. Instead, Richard is an invigorating presence to those denizens
in need of reminding why this secluded lifestyle is the cat's meow. (The
character is too inoffensively drawn, but also competently portrayed by
DiCaprio.) The Beach's most insightful moment is a single shot of our
green planet as made up of microchips. United by technology, our globe
is shrinking; the tech revolution may seem suffocating, its
oft-forgotten goal is to liberate the human being from feeling anything
but free.

Title
Review for Sleepy Hollow (1999)
SLEEPY HOLLOW ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael
Gambon
screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker, based on The Legend of Sleepy Hollow
by Washington Irving
directed by Tim Burton
Googly eyes that spring forth from a ghoulish figure. A burning
windmill. Ornate choir music. Jeffrey Jones. Sleepy Hollow is Tim
Burton's Greatest Hits. The trouble with most compilation albums is that
they're superficial, a bunch of songs with only one context:
retrospection. If this latest gloomfest from Burton doesn't make you
yearn for the days when you were witnessing his directorial flourishes
for the first time, we saw different films. While the setting is hollow,
the storytelling is shallow.
Washington Irving's classic tale has been retooled to the sensibilities
of Burton and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker (of Se7en). Schoolteacher
Ichabod Crane (Depp) is now a New York City police constable sent
upstate with his wild detecting contraptions (he's a pioneer of
forensics) to investigate a series of decapitations in the community of
Sleepy Hollow. The town's magistrates have pegged The Headless Horseman,
a vengeful ghost, as the killer, but Crane, whose spell-dabbling mother
(Lisa Marie) was tortured to death by puritans, prefers to put his faith
in logic over the superrnatural.
With "Murder She Wrote" or "Scooby Doo Mysteries" instead of Irving's
text as its template, the remainder of the plot feels like filler. Crane
flirts with Katrina (Ricci, in a yellow wig-Burton apparently shares a
blonde hair fetish with Hitchcock), the winsome daughter of landlord
Baltus Van Tassel (Gambon). Katrina's hand has already been promised to
Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien in a role that thankfully doesn't tax
his limited range), which, according to the principles of gothic
literature, means one third of the triangle will have to be dispatched.
Then there's the orphan (Marc Pickering) who tags along with Crane as a
sort of junior Watson, squashing spiders for his wimpy mentor and
shielding him from harm.
Burton and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have concocted some
psychotically pretty images that visually distinguish this
interpretation of ...Sleepy Hollow from all the others, especially in
scenes featuring Christopher Walken, who leaves a lasting impression as
the Horseman. (Don't worry, I haven't ruined anything.) The actor's
unearthly physical presence has been noted in the past, but here, with
snarls for dialogue and a mouthful of pointy teeth, he achieves
heretofore-unexplored levels of camp. His performance lacks the tragic
elements of the most memorable movie monsters, but the very sight of him
defibrilates a movie mired in Hammer cliches and (with one exception,
involving a duel) derivative action sequences.
Yes, yes, I know, those unmotivated bolts of lightning, shots of people
darting awake from a nightmare in a cold sweat, melodramatic line
readings, and fog-drenched, minimalist sets are Burton's way of paying
tribute to the horror pictures he loved as a youth (Hammer mainstay
Christopher Lee even has a cameo), but the effect is muffled by a
self-consciously B-grade and critically underdeveloped script, not to
mention a budget that could've funded fifty or sixty Vincent Price
flicks. Ichabod and Katrina's cursory romance has been spared the
imagination that went into the special effects (which are spectacular),
and the resolution, which follows a carriage race climax that falls
short of thrilling (not enough complications), is a real head-scratcher.
(The filmmakers skip a necessary step in the plotting.)
I referred to some of Burton's other work in the opening paragraph-in
order: Pee Wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice; Frankenweenie (a short);
his entire catalogue; and Beetlejuice and Ed Wood. Burton's Sleepy
Hollow is stitched together from spare parts like some cinematic
Frankenstein, and it's unwieldy. This is the third time he and Depp have
collaborated on a project (after Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands),
annihilating that old adage about charm-their previous unions were much
more fruitful. Depp really disappoints; he emasculates Ichabod, but the
character's cowardice lacks shading. The problem is not that we wind up
rooting for the Headless Horseman, it's that we never root for Crane.
Burton's career is on a downswing-his last effort, Mars Attacks, was
another unsuccessful hommage. His work of late is most signifcantly
characterized by its thematic emptiness-if only, in fishing through his
old bag of tricks, he had pulled up the emotional grandeur of Edward
Scissorhands or Ed Wood, films that spoke volumes about alienation and
passion. It is Burton who loses his head in the dark, dull Sleepy
Hollow. Or, at least, his knack.

Review for Armageddon (1998)
ARMAGEDDON *1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers
(Film, DVD, LD reviews! A section where YOU can recommend movies!
Fabric softener! All in one!
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers
New address. New attitude. Same purple prose.)
starring Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck
written by Jonathan Hensleigh and J.J.  Abrams
directed by Michael Bay
It rocks-actually, lots of rocks fly at us or from us, in slow or
fast motion, at several points in the film. They seem like dangerous
rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just
propelling forward, and when they land-once in a while, when we
need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to
destroy the Chrysler building and the like. (Nary a mention of these
apocalyptic events is made after they occur.) They also just might be
the most interesting element of ARMAGEDDON, a steroid user's answer
to Deep Impact.
Bruce Willis stars as Harry Stamper, a famed oil-driller commissioned
by the White House and NASA to stop a giant asteroid before it travels
beyond "zero barrier" and destroys our planet. Why an oil driller?
They require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a
nuclear missile into said asteroid. (In one unintentionally (?)
hilarious sequence, NASA asks Harry to inspect a deep-core driller
they built based on his blueprints; it is poorly constructed-Harry
criticizes almost every aspect of it. We trust NASA to build space
shuttles?) Harry assembles the obligatory "ragtag" bunch of "cowboys",
including a blond guy, a fat guy, a black guy, a wiseass, and the man
who is sleeping with his daughter (Affleck). Once they reach space, we
experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps
the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has
something to do with it; I cannot count the number of times they
almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes. Whether or not
they save the day, I will not reveal. Nor will you care.
I will say this: you know you're in trouble when Deep Impact dwarfs
your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope. Willis has barely a
chance to come alive; ditto for Affleck.  Their big scenes are mostly
reserved for the third act, in a last minute-and futile-attempt
to inject warmth into the material. Steve Buscemi's
character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic. "Rockhound",
as he's called, is sarcastic and foolish, so they tape him to a
chair, where he spends most of the film. So why did they bring him up
there to begin with? Rather, why write him into the film?-give his
almost-witty one-liners to serious Willis, who scowls and mopes and
demonstrates psychotic tendencies: at one point he chases after
Affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter, firing often and
causing significant damage to his oil rig. I'm guessing he
qualifies under NASA guidelines as someone unfit for space travel, at
least in my world where the sky is blue. Liv Tyler is pretty and
humourless, as always; suspiciously, four of her father's band's
("Aerosmith") songs grace the soundtrack. Director Michael Bay lays
the visual and sound effects on thick, like ketchup, eventually
drowning the movie on-screen. (The middle hour is a non-sensical,
pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain.) Whenever
someone dies in this movie, a crew member inevitably yells out "We
lost (insert dead person's last name here)!" I must admit that not
once could I distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one,
and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets
provided little assistance, as their skin was often covered in fake
blood.
ARMAGEDDON is not as terrible movie as Godzilla. It looks nicer, and
has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework. It has a
vivid soundmix. But at almost two-and-a-half hours, I could not
believe how little actually happened over the course of the story. The
love story has been played up in the ads, perhaps hoping to catch
people before they recover from Titanic-fever. Bollocks! The lovers in
the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude
sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of Liv
Tyler tearing up while Ben Affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler.
Remember a little film called Jaws? In this film, three
independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in
pursuit of a deadly shark. They didn't much like each other at
first; eventually, they started to respect one another. One of
Jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-Ahabs drinking and singing
songs and telling stories. This is the sort of male-bonding foreign to
Bay or his producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, who throw too many characters
into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that
the world is about to end. Not once do we get the feeling that these
characters are even acquaintances-I'd be surprised if these
actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before "action"
was called. A male friend who loved the film suggested to me that
perhaps I cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their
souls, who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of
chest-beating bravery. To this, I will respond that the boys in
ARMAGEDDON are neither heroic, nor brave, nor smart, even: this team
couldn't build a birdhouse. And if I get no respect for disliking a
movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a
movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card
authors-I've never been a prouder wimp my whole life.

Review for Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)
           -a review by Bill Chambers ( wchamber@netcom.ca )
 (Merry Christmas from Film Freak Central! http://filmfreakcentral.net )
Everything about this ninth Trek movie seems on the cheap, from the
Roger Corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad
campaign (the poster is nearly identical to that of Star Trek VI: The
Undiscovered Country). But Piller's not-quite-half-baked screenplay
should ultimately claim responsibility for Insurrection's failure. I'm
about to give the same advice to Rick Berman and co. as I've given to
the financiers of James Bond movies: it's time to breathe life into this
workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director. (While
we're at it, put that visor back on LaForge!)
For three hundred years, the Ba'ku species (who look just like humans)
have lived on a ringed-planet that might as well be called the Fountain
of Youth. Six hundred of them occupy the Briar Patch, the area affected
by metaphasic radition, a positive energy that reverses the aging
process in the elderly. But evil Ru'afo (this is probably Abraham's last
stop before performing "Amadeus" at a dinner theatre near you), leader
of the Son'a (who look just like burn victims after reconstructive
surgery), wants to relocate the Ba'ku and movie his people onto the
Briar Patch in their place, in order to replenish his dying breed. The
Federation is all for this, but Picard feels this is a direct violation
of the Prime Directive: to not interfere with the development of an
alien race. (Never mind that the Ba'ku didn't exactly evolve-they went
wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world.)
Every time Frakes gives an interview lately, he seems to top whatever
ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment. He has
called it a comedy, a thinking man's picture, a throwback to the old
series, and, most grievously, he has likened it to a John Ford western.
(I presume that's some John Ford he went to school with, not the
director of The Searchers.) He has also gone on record as saying
Paramount recut the film from his version. That's no excuse-someone
generated this footage. Muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the
least of its problems; Star Trek: Insurrection appears to have been
beamed in from the planet Plotholia. Consider such curiosities...
Picard's love interest, Anij (Donna Murphy), can slow things down by
staring at them (such as a waterfall or falling rocks)-her scientific
explanation for this? "Don't ask." Worf gets a pimple (he's
re-experiencing Klingon puberty thanks to the time-defying atmosphere),
LaForge regains his eyesight (trust me, Levar Burton's real eyes are
scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in First Contact) and Troi
brags about her firm boobs, but Picard remains as bald as an android's
butt.
Most suspiciously, what exactly is the problem with letting this
endangered race have a little fun in the sun? The filmmakers cloud the
issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts, and they also
turn Ru'afo into a completely power-mad superfreak, just so the
characters will have something to do in the climax. (And if you've seen
Return of the Jedi, you've seen the ending of this movie.) Didn't Picard
himself previously disobey the Prime Directive when he prevented the
Borg from assimilating millions?
Frakes lucked out with First Contact, and repeat viewings of that film
reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of Insurrection: he
has no sense of comic timing, and he mines for acting chemistry where
none exists. (Take a look at the painful "Troi gets drunk" scene in FC
and you'll get the general idea of Insurrection's unsuccessfully jokey
and hollow tone.) Even the worst Shatner and co. Treks, like The Final
Frontier, maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless, charming
comaraderie between Kirk, Spock, and Bones.
Neither First Contact nor Insurrection has any idea what to do with
Crusher (Gates McFadden, whom I must say maintains a fabulous physique),
Troi, or LaForge. And all three Next Generation films spend too much
time on Data, who is the franchise's answer to Urkel. Need a cheap
laugh? Have Data say something sexual, or start singing, or lift up a
four hundred pound boulder as if it's the hunk of styrofoam it really
is. Here's my proposed title for number 10: Data Star Data Trek: Data
Data Data Data Data. In this movie, Data will become preoccupied with
learning to blow his nose, while Crusher and Troi watch silently from
500 yards away and LaForge points his sinister gaze at the android in
doubly robotic observation.
Star Trek: Insurrection had one nice, eerie, silent moment that hints at
a better, darker film. I'm not saying all of them should be Star Trek
II: The Wrath of Khan, but this one boldly went where no movie should go
again.

Title
Review for Dark Crystal, The (1982)
THE DARK CRYSTAL **** (out of four)
"Another world, Another time... In the age of wonder."
-a review by Bill Chambers
(Shampoo + conditioner in ONE website!
Film Freak Central-
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504
Check out my idiotic film journal, and don't forget to
recommend a movie in the 'Can't Miss' section.)
When Jim Henson passed away, he left behind diverse legions of fans
and a company whose ultimate success, it now seems, hinged on his
input. Jim Henson Productions and The Creature Shop are still thriving
financially, but as the last two Muppet films (or that silly
computer-generated monkey from Lost In Space) demonstrate, the thrill
and genius are gone. I'm not sure THE DARK CRYSTAL, made today, would
generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe-filled
response.
An all-powerful crystal has cracked, causing the leaders of the green
world to split apart into two beings: the big, gentle Mystics, and the
vulture-like Skeksis. The Mystics send Jen, a naive Gelfling boy, on a
mission to find the shard that cracked away, which must be reinserted
into the crystal before the Skeksis become eternal rulers, before the
great "conjunction" of three suns. Along the way, Jen encounters and
teams up with the only other Gelfling alive, the Rebecca DeMornay-like
Kira, an ogre-witch named Aughra, who removes her eyes to look at
things, and a spastic-but-friendly, tumbleweed-like animal named
Fizzgig.
Much of the beauty in THE DARK CRYSTAL, which is a simple tale (though
it does not condescend to any viewer), lies in its art direction and
creature design. The puppeteering is phenomenal--observe the scenes in
which Jen plays his flute, or the landwalker chase--but I must stress
that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but
vanish in the opening moments of the picture, a delicately-narrated
(by John Baddeley), absorbing prologue. The voice work in the film, by
Muppet regulars and irregulars, is tone-perfect. As well, Trevor
Jones' score should not be discounted: it contributes to the film
almost as an unseen character. I suppose, due to the complexity
involved in executing a movie of this nature, that it couldn't be
helped, but I wish the film was longer.  Jen and Kira have
wonderful...well, chemistry, and more scenes of them quietly
conversing would have been appreciated.
THE DARK CRYSTAL has a very small cult following. The weaker Labyrinth
is probably better-known, which is upsetting. A friend of mine related
a story to me that Henson was pressured into planting humans among
Labyrinth's creatures due to the financial failure of people-less THE
DARK CRYSTAL. That film never quite found its footing; it played like
an acid-trip episode of "The Muppet Show" with David Bowie as
guest-host, borrowing from Tolkien and pandering to Tolkien's
fan-base. (I suppose I just made Labyrinth sound appetizing to a
certain sector of the public.) THE DARK CRYSTAL deserved (and still
deserves) a bigger audience. It's the best kind of children's
entertainment: elegant, fantastical, and courageously un-hip. Brian
Henson, fortunate son, keep looking back at this, your father's
masterpiece.

Review for Sphere (1998)
(For more lame-ass reviews visit my scum-hearted website:
FILM FREAK CENTRAL!
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504
Lots to read, and a special section where you can tell me (and others)
what to see. Visit it, you damn filthy apes!)
starring Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson, Liev
Schrieber
screenplay by Stephen Hauser and Paul Attanasio, based on Michael
Crichton's novel
directed by Barry Levinson
I have a bit of a history with Sphere. In May of 1996, I began writing
a screenplay
adaptation of Crichton's novel with the naive hope that nice letters
to Mr. Levinson would
coax him into taking a look at it. After scripting 96 pages, I broke
my arm, couldn't type
for a while... I also hadn't received any word back from Barry Baby
after firing off two
notices. I wasn't aware that he had already put his assistant/script
reader to work at it. In
the end it was great practice--I was teaching myself the art of
adaptation. Still, Mr.
Baltimore could have mailed me a form letter, a polite screw you.
And now, vindication: the movie is just a damn mess.
Hoffman stars as Norman, a psychologist summoned to the bottom of the
ocean to
investigate a 300 year old spacecraft as part of the "ULF", a team he
proposed during the
Bush administration when asked to write a report on dealing with the
possibility of alien
contact. He is joined by Stone as Beth, a neurotic biochemist,
Schrieber as Ted, a neurotic
astrophysicist, and Jackson as Harry, a curiously un-neurotic
mathematician. What they
discover (along with Peter Coyote as the obligatory military hard-ass)
in their exploration
is that ship may not be alien at all but, in fact, American. And they
encounter the titular
sphere, a shiny golden ball-bearing the size of a house that reflects
people only as they are
about to get sucked into it. When this happens to one (or two, or
three) of them, all hell
breaks loose. Soon the proverbial giant squid attacks the ship.
Surprisingly, the first third of the film does the novel justice: the
pacing is good and the
dynamic between the characters is quickly established. Now, I try
always to judge a film
adaptation and its source material separately, mostly due to my not
being well-read and
having no basis for comparison. But in this case, I must. Levinson and
his writers make a
wrongheaded left turn in the plot away from the Crichton novel at the
end of act one, a
misjudgment that ultimately robs the climax of what could have been a
visually delightful
and enlightening revelation. In other words, the filmmakers play their
big card too early in
a throwaway moment that is only the first of several head-scratching
bits to come.
The acting is strong, Jackson in particular, and they're basically
working from nothing; one
would be hard pressed to determine what these characters' occupations
are if they entered
the cinema after the opening sequences. The art direction and
cinematography are
generally lazy; we've seen these steaming pipes and rusted catwalks
before. Did the
engineers of the spaceship refer back to '80's science fiction films
before designing their vessel?
The movie also, unfortunately, accentuates the book's flaws,
logic-holes that one looks
over in a page-turner. I don't want to discuss them here, now, lest I
give away the (goofy,
curious) ending, which stays true to the novel in many ways. One could
do worse than
spend a night at Sphere, but it proves that the not-bad Wag The Dog,
last month's
Levinson picture, was a blip on the radar. His career is headed the
way of Sphere's
spaceship.

Title
Review for Pleasantville (1998)
PLEASANTVILLE **1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(Visit my review archive, play some movie trivia, and more!
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers/ )
starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels
written and directed by Gary Ross
PLEASANTVILLE is a kind of inverted Truman Show: its two protagonists
are aware they are stuck in a TV show, but everybody around them isn't.
This is a film that in its own peculiar way lectures against
conformity-life without individuality as a (here, literally and
figuratively) black and white world.
Maguire (The Ice Storm) stars as David, the World's Biggest
"Pleasantville" (a fictitious "Father Knows Best"-like family values
sitcom from the fifties) fan. One lonely Friday night, at the start of a
"Pleasantville" marathon, he and his rebellious sister Jennifer
(Witherspoon) are zapped into the program by a mysterious TV repairman
(Don Knotts-whose cameo garnered loud applause at the recent Toronto
International Film Festival premiere). The siblings must live out the
lives of characters Bud and Mary Sue Parker, son and daughter of
housewife Betty (Allen) and office man George (Fargo's William H. Macy).
David knows every episode by heart, so he finds it easy to blend in;
careless Jennifer is intent on taking Pleasantville by storm: within
hours of her arrival she steals a basketball player's virginity and
lectures her naive mother about the birds and the bees. Her impulsive
actions trigger a most unusual effect on the gray landscape: flowers,
trees, even people begin to look more vibrant than usual. At first,
Maguire scrambles to undo Witherspoon's mistakes', but when the love
bug bites him unsuspectingly, he joins the Pleasantville revolution.
Ross's (co-screenwriter of Big) beautifully-photographed (by John
Lindley) and scored (by Randy Newman) directorial debut is a flawed but
fascinating motion picure that recalls the fantasies of Robert Zemeckis
(Back To The Future, Forrest Gump). The movie demonstrates how a
mini-society can be corrupted by, frankly, the introduction of
free-spirited sex. Those who discover passion in Pleasantville turn to
colour; the town's traditionalist mayor Big Bob (the late J.T. Walsh)
outlaws "coloured people", resulting in street riots and political
protests. But the movie wants to have its cake and eat it, too: David
gives an impassioned, convincing speech that champions self-exploration
and experimentation.
PLEASANTVILLE's most problematic character is Macy's: as a chauvanistic
father and husband utterly dependent on his wife's homecare (he doesn't
even know how to heat up leftovers), we actually feel sorry for him when
she ditches him for golly-gee soda shop owner Daniels. It's not George's
fault he is a prototypical man-of-the-house fifties TV character. Ross
simultaneously resents and sympathizes with him. (The ending feels a bit
rushed, glossing over exactly what will become of George and others like
him.)
PLEASANTVILLE touches on giant issues (racism, book burning) but is a
bit too PG-13 "pleasant" in its execution. I was never quite sure what
Ross was trying to say, but his film is a finely acted,
thought-provoking experience nonetheless.

Title
Review for American Pie (1999)
AMERICAN PIE *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (pie@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Jason Biggs, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Chris Klein, Tara Reid
screenplay by Adam Herz
directed by Paul Weitz
American Pie acknowledges a cold, hard fact that most movies don't: it
is very difficult to get laid. Its four virgin heroes are Jim (Biggs),
a chronic masturbator, Kev (Nicholas), who desperately wants to
deflower his girlfriend (Reid), Oz (Klein), a lacrosse player whose
approach requires some fine tuning, and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), a
germphobe (his crass nickname is hilarious, but I won't spoil it here)
who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member. 
Jim, Kev, Oz and Finch attend a high school in suburban Michigan full
of so many impossibly beautiful women it's no wonder they're horny all
the time. After a party at their studly friend Stifler's (Seann
William Scott, in the film's sharpest performance) house leaves them
sexually unsatisfied, the quartet make a pact: to "lose it" by
graduation-specifically, prom night, which is only a few weeks away. 
American Pie is in the tradition of Bachelor Party or Revenge of the
Nerds. Almost every conversation these characters have revolves around
makin' whoopee. All women are there to be ogled. (Alyson Hannigan's
perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch.)
Situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and/or amuse its core
audience, adolescent boys. (To arouse: Nadia's (Shannon Elizabeth)
Internet striptease-an unexpectedly raucous (and guiltily pleasurable)
sequence. To amuse: Jim's lusty encounter with a hot apple pie.) 
What differentiates American Pie from those dirty eighties comedies,
aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids*, is a cast
that's light years more appealing than that of, say, Just One of the
Guys. Two more standouts: Klein and "SCTV"'s Eugene Levy. Klein plays
a kind-hearted athlete for the second time in a row, after Alexander
Payne's underappreciated Election. I hope to see more of this warm
actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon. Levy's is the most
crowd-pleasing performance, and indeed, it's nice to see him back on
the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive
brow.
American Pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents
_would_ let you watch growing up. It skillfully employs a broad mix of
pop tunes, much like John Hughes' movies did, and even pays homage to
The Breakfast Club a couple of times, most evidently when the prom
band covers Simple Minds' "Don't You (Forget About Me)." 
The picture ultimately has a healthy, if obligatory, attitude towards
safe sex-even at their most libidinous, American Pie's protagonists
first whip out a condom. The filmmakers prove that socially
responsible raunch is possible. 
For its familiarity and for its charming leads, I recommend American
Pie, but the buzz on this film had me expecting something...fresher.
As far as the New Teen Cinema goes, it's at the top of the heap. 
*Don't say I didn't warn you about the party scene.

Title
Review for Hurlyburly (1998)
HURLYBURLY *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( fonzie@filmfreakcentral.net )
(Film Freak Central - the next best thing to watching movies.
http://filmfreakcentral.net )
starring Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright Penn, Chazz Palminteri
screenplay by David Rabe, based on his play
directed by Anthony Drazan
The word "hurlyburly" describes the thought patterns of Eddie the
Cokehead to a tee. As played by Sean Penn, hypersensitive Eddie is
like the wind-up toy that always threatens to stroll right off the
tabletop. Eddie just doesn't let things go-at first his behaviour
smacks of self-absorption. As the movie progresses, we come to
understand Eddie as a kind of existential Sherlock Holmes, desperate
to get to the bottom of, quite literally, everything. Hurlyburly is
about how a place like Hollywood can eat a person like Eddie alive.
Eddie, with his pencil-thin mustache and lazily gelled hair, is a
player high enough on the food chain to afford a big, sterile Beverly
Hills pad and enough cocaine to keep him buzzed all day. (He snorts in
place of morning coffee.) He shares his home with Mickey (Spacey), a
slick, bleach-blonde smoothie who is dating the woman (Wright Penn) 
Eddie had his sights set on. (Eventually Mickey, feeling not so much
shame or guilt as defeat and frustration, breaks up with the woman,
Darlene, and encourages her to hook up with Eddie.) Further stressing
Eddie out is Phil (Palminteri), a hulky, ticking time bomb who grows
more violent and more needy as his marriage corrodes. Phil is a 
stray pitbull our hero can't shake...and deep down, Eddie doesn't want
to lose him, because Phil's hostility makes Eddie look rational by
comparison. Meanwhile, a teenage runaway (The Piano's Anna Paquin,
unfortunately the film's weakest link) is staying at their house, a
"gift" from friend Artie (Garry Shandling), who spotted her on an 
elevator.
Hurlyburly does not shed its stagebound roots-no more than a handful
of scenes unfold outside of Eddie and Mickey's place, and towards the
end of the film one senses that Drazan is struggling to maintain some
visual interest in the central location. But the cast is mesmerizing
enough to compensate; these performances are grand and theatrical and,
thanks to the advantages of the close up, paradoxically intimate-our
eyes and ears are peeled throughout. Spacey, effectively typecast,
plays apathetic Mickey with confidence. (The quintessential Spacey 
moment comes during an exchange towards the end of the picture: Eddie:
"You have no feelings!" Mickey: "No, I have my own feelings, not
yours.") Palminteri as Phil annoys and frightens in balanced doses,
just as he should. However, the picture belongs to Penn, as the addict
whose brain is too big for his heart. Five and ten minute chunks 
of Hurlyburly pass with no one speaking but Eddie, who delivers
stupefacient monologues that invariably end in tears. Penn doesn't
earn our sympathies-instead, he wins something closer to pity. Your
enjoyment of the film will hinge on whether or not you can stomach two
solid hours of Sean Penn.
Which leads me to my next point: as enthralling as all this human
drama frequently is, Hurlyburly overstays its welcome. Perhaps that's
because there's very little order to the story's structure; when
Bonnie, a stripper (Meg Ryan, flexing atrophied acting muscles), shows
up in what I'll call act two, it seems for no other reason than
boredom on the part of Rabe. Such is the nature of the filmed play, I
suppose, but Drazan could have edited a tighter film. Without the
benefit of the play's intermission, the travails of Eddie and his
cruisers are thoroughly exhausting.

Title
Review for Entrapment (1999)
ENTRAPMENT **˝ (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( entrapment@filmfreakcentral.net )
(Visit Film Freak Central for your cinematic fixin's:
http://filmfreakcentral.net
Clothing optional.)
starring Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames, Will Patton
screenplay by Ron Bass and William Broyles, Jr.
directed by Jon Amiel
Sean Connery is permitted use of his native accent in Entrapment (or,
as Connery pronounces it, Entchraphmint) while theWelsh Zeta-Jones is
not. Her character's exotic beauty and worldly ways are at odds with
her bland, midwest dialect. It doesn't help that Zeta-Jones is no
Meryl Streep when it comes to vocal gymnastics. But then, most (men,
at least) aren't likely to notice that Zeta-Jones' lips are even
moving as they watch Entrapment; slinking between security devices
like a hungry feline (she's a cat-burglar, har har), Zeta-Jones is
adept at real gymnastics. Her impeccable physique takes centre stage
in a film that elevates thievery into performance art.
Connery plays Mac, an infamous robber baron who takes Zeta-Jones, as
rookie thief Virginia Baker ("Gin"), under his wing. She wants to
steal a priceless Chinese mask; as Connery proves quickly, she's
flexible but not as cunning as he is. I should mention at this point
that Gin is a double agent, if you will: she's working for the
treasury to bring Mac down. Her tutelage is a ruse.
Or is it? Twenty minutes into Entrapment, I determined just what kind
of movie it is: the type that throws red herring after red herring at
the audience, peeling away story layers like pieces of a Chinese box.
Yet the experience of watching Entrapment is not nearly as frustrating
as sitting through the similarly plotted Wild Things, a film that 
unwrapped its bandages only to reveal the invisible man. (Entrapment,
unlike Wild Things, is not out to deconstruct a genre; for all its
twists and turns, it is a conventional, mainstream picture.) One
element of Entrapment does remain pleasantly constant throughout, and
that is the bizarre tango between Connery and Zeta-Jones. Whatever 
their motivations, it's clear that they're smitten with one another
from their first scene together. (Aside: note the phallic imagery the
first time Mac meets Gin-she is naked in this scene, and his gun
provides an amusing and subtle gag.) While their romance doesn't quite
conjure memories of such old-fashioned pairings as Cary Grant and 
Grace Kelly, the two actors achieve a level of intimacy that Eastwood
could not with any of his young, female co-stars from the recent True
Crime. (I mention Eastwood-who is close in age and stature to
Connery-only to emphasize the May-December nineties trend; sometimes
it works, sometimes it doesn't, though the time is nigh for both men
to admit their age on screen, as Beatty did in Bulworth.) Entrapment
also features a freakish performance from Canadian actor Maury
Chaykin, who invests his bit part (as a Confuscious-quoting guru to 
burglars) with a ferocious energy that recalls early Nicolas Cage.
Jon Amiel has had a spotty career (his Copycat is a series of missed
or botched opportunities). Entrapment is directed efficiently but only
the set pieces show real visual flair. I felt the break-and-enter
sequences in DePalma's Mission: Impossible were the best things about
it; Entrapment's are similarly thrilling. For the Chinese Mask number
(which left me breathless), the filmmakers may have created a new
sport: laser ballet. I also enjoyed the extensive training before the
second heist: movies of this ilk rarely acknowledge the rehearsals
that take place before the main events.

Title
Review for Tarzan (1999)
TARZAN ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( tarzan@filmfreakcentral.net )
starring the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Brian
Blessed
screenplay by Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker, Noni White,
based on 'Tarzan Of The Apes" by Edgar Rice Burroughs
directed by Chris Buck and Kevin Lima
Parody him, give him a syndicated television series, put a tuxedo on
him, it doesn't matter: to paraphrase Led  Zeppelin, Tarzan remains
the same; he's a simplistic tribute to primeval man. The basic story
of a baby abandoned in the jungle who is raised by apes has been
filmed more times than any other, if only because Burrough's book is
in the public domain. Now that Disney has appropriated the character
for use in its annual summer cartoon, I'm not even sure I can type
"Tarzan" without the Registered Trademark symbol. And just because
they've animated him doesn't mean they've liberated him: Disney's
swift, agile Tarzan is, personality-wise, as yawn inducing as previous
incarnations. The movie itself is an uneasy hybrid of conflicting
formulas. 
Tarzan commences with a rousing sequence that depicts the parallel
lives of Tarzan's parents and parents-to-be. Shipwrecked, Tarzan's
human mother and father build a treehouse, and successfully tend to
their baby until disaster strikes in the form of a hungry leopard.
Kala (Close), a mother gorilla whose new child was similarly devoured,
discovers Tarzan squirming in a cradle and adopts him instantly; her
husband,  Kerchak (Lance Henriksen), refuses to acknowledge the boy as
a son based solely on his human appearance. The years pass, and Tarzan
learns to negotiate the forest like his ape protectors. Then he
encounters Jane (Driver), who is on expedition with her father and a
big game hunter named Clayton (Blessed); they are three people who
look more like him than anyone else in the jungle, so he suffers a
brief but potent crisis of identity. 
Two gaping plot holes occurred to me as I watched Tarzan '99. First,
let me establish that Tarzan and his primate friends speak English for
our sake, but it's understood that they're babbling variations of
"Oo-oo-ee-ee-ah-ah" to each other. So why is Tarzan able to introduce
himself to Jane as "Tarzan"? 
Then there's the issue of Clayton. Everybody's inexplicably surprised
when he betrays his escorts and sets trap for the gorillas. If the
Snidely Whiplash-moustache and double-barreled shotgun were not clues
enough, surely the fact that he excitedly asked Tarzan over and over
again "Where are the gorillas?" was a bold sign that he had ulterior
motives for being in Africa. 
The film rehashes the The Lion King's irritating time-compression
technique: Tarzan's formative years are skipped entirely with a lap
dissolve of preteen Tarzan to adult Tarzan-the film misses its only
opportunity to be innovative by dismissing his maturation. What would
adolescence be like for Tarzan? If one was raised by apes, would(n't)
one develop a sexual attraction to some of them? The film hints at a
burgeoning romance between Tarzan and Turk, a girlla, that is
interrupted by the arrival of Jane, but if Turk has more than platonic
feelings, they remain as subtext. 
Such depth, not to mention a beastiality subplot, would be out of
place in a Disney film, anyway. After said opening, Tarzan goes bland.
(This includes Phil Collins' song score, which is elevator music for
the wild.) It answers questions of racism and gun control with a big
smiley face. It preaches against poaching only slightly more
effectively than last year's lame remake of Mighty Joe Young. It
provides unnecessary, obnoxious sidekicks for our hero in the form of
the aforementioned Turk (Rosie O'Donnell in a grating vocal
performance) and an aw-shucks elephant named Tantor (Wayne Knight). It
offers not a single moment of surprise in its climax. None of this
quite meshes with the conventions of Burrough's Tarzan tales-I can't
determine which recipe has been shoehorned into the other. (Does it
occur to children weaned on the new Disney movies that they're
watching the same story over and over again? Pocahontas, Mulan, and
Tarzan fit into the same rigid paradigm, yet they're respectively
based on an American legend, Chinese folklore, and a beloved modern
mythology.) 
One aspect of this Tarzan does enthrall. I'm talking about its
resplendent design, of course, a seamless blend of digital and
traditional animation techniques-the two are most complementary during
the "Deep Canvas" action scenes, which will undoubtedly be diminished
on the small screen. (They are perhaps reason enough to see Tarzan at
the cinema.) Tarzan soars through the trees like a surfer coasting on
an imaginary wave (indeed, his liquid movements were modeled after one
animator's skateboarding kid). If only he defied our expectations as
well as gravity.

Review for Kiss the Girls (1997)
starring Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Cary Elwes, Jay O. Sanders
screenplay by David Klass, based on the novel by James Patterson
directed by Gary Fleder
(If you like this review, and you must have more, visit
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504
It's getting better.)
Morgan Freeman teamed with Brad Pitt in the best movie of 1995, David
Fincher's neo-noir Se7en. (I can't believe I just used a bullshit term
like "neo-noir".) Just two years later, America's Best Actor is
headlining another serial killer chiller thriller, but in Kiss The
Girls, he takes an unfortunate step backwards from shock to schlock.
Freeman stars as Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist who points out,
presumably for police terminology-challenged audience members, that
his job is to figure out "the how's and why's." When his niece is
kidnapped in North Carolina's Research Triangle by a deranged killer
who calls himself Casanova, Cross assists the small-town homicide
detectives in tracking down the murderer's whereabouts. Assisting
Cross is Kate, the woman who got away (Judd), a doctor who, like each
of the victims, is young and gorgeous, but not as weak.
By the third scene, the screenplay isn't working: why, exactly, did
the filmmakers choose to have Cross travel from Washington to North
Carolina instead of setting the case in his hometown, since the shift
in location does little to slow down his investigation? More
ridiculous contrivances abound. At one point, Cross believes he has
discovered the killer's identity, and he decides to tail him for an
evening. All evidence then has it that this is their guy. So, they
stake out his home, armed with guns. Who does? A S.W.A.T. team,
perhaps? No, just Cross and two police officers, with the perky Kate
waiting in the car. Casanova is one of the most wanted men in America;
the F.B.I. have been trying to capture him for months, yet it never
occurs to Cross and company to call for back-up. The outcome is both
tragic and idiotic.
Most unbelievably is that the hick cops (no pun intended) and the
F.B.I. are always waiting for the next body to show up. Why? Because
the dead women always appear in the same place, a nice little Miller's
Crossing-y section of a forest. So why aren't any of them patrolling
this area instead of twiddling their thumbs? Worse, they can't find
Casanova's hideout; how many dungeons can there be in these woodlands?
The characters are as lazily conceived as the plot. Can we please have
a moratorium on will-they-or-won't-they black man-white woman
relationships, a la The Pelican Brief? Had this film featured Harrison
Ford in the role of Cross, you can bet your eight-fifty he'd have
bedded Kate by the end of act two. Cross, we assume, is intelligent,
authoritative and wise, but only because Morgan Freeman is playing
him. Ashley Judd, an agreeable screen presence, unfortunately lacks
Freeman's worldliness, so Kate remains a nice but bland girl-next-door
type who goes kickboxing after work.
Director Fleder made the little seen but delightful Things To Do In
Denver When You're Dead. Kiss The Girls does shine at times, too:
Freeman's first scene, in which he talks a suicidal woman out of
shooting herself, is a great way to introduce his character. And the
opening credit sequence is outstanding (though it continues a
dispiriting trend, a la Mimic, of having opening titles more involving
and inventive than any scenes in the film that follows them). Fleder
has some visual flair, but so what? Kiss The Girls is littered with
overblown, over-directed scenes, too many supporting characters, too
many plot holes... Denver was pretty well written: witty, sad and
scary. It's clear that Fleder is a craftsman, only as strong as his
script.
Ah, but Morgan Freeman... why he would be attracted to this material,
especially so soon after appearing in the defining masterpiece of the
genre, is curious. But he does more than just make Kiss The Girls
watchable whenever he's on screen; he makes it compelling, and he
deserves better.

Review for State and Main (2000)
STATE AND MAIN ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Alec Baldwin, Charles Durning, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy
written and directed by David Mamet
I've always found it odd that movies about moviemaking tend to come from 
young directors, who haven't any perspective on the profession yet. To 
point the camera back at Hollywood at all is an exercise in 
self-indulgence, but the results are generally more satisfying when it's an 
old hand behind that camera. (Every year at the Toronto International Film 
Festival, I must sit through two or three debut films that are about the 
biz, and none of them ever hold a candle to Robert Altman's career abstract 
The Player.) Playwright, script doctor and highbrow filmmaker David Mamet 
skewers the pre-production stage of big-budget features in his latest 
motion picture State and Main, and while it's more insightful than most of 
its kin about the screenwriter's place in the food chain (no surprise 
there), I can't help but think its last line, "Cue the dead horse," should 
have been the first, because Mamet beats one from the get-go.
The setting for this screwball-ish comedy is a Vermont hamlet in which "The 
Old Mill" will soon be shot--though not before the project is renamed: 
turns out the town's old mill, the very reason they set up shop there, 
burned down decades ago. (Like many of State and Main's ironies, this plot 
development hopes we were born yesterday; that the film's title setting 
would be overlooked during the initial location scout is maddeningly 
illogical.) The start date is also threatened by one star's (Alec Baldwin) 
paedophilic fling and another's (Sarah Jessica Parker) refusal to perform a 
nude scene; in the meantime, a local woman (Rebecca Pidgeon) becomes muse 
to the insecure screenwriter (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a theatre vet. 
Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, vacillates between robotic and just plain terrible, 
as always--she has the glassy-eyed stare of someone being fed her lines 
off-screen. Aside from nepotism, Mamet is guilty of leaving several story 
strands flapping in the breeze, and I can't believe that his years of 
experience with such ripe targets as Brian DePalma amounted to this. In the 
end, State and Main so much resembles the cinema-obsessed work regularly 
generated by naive film school graduates that it might be more prudent to 
call it brilliant parody. (--- For more first-run, DVD, and

Title
Review for Mighty Joe Young (1998)
The most absurd remake of 1998? It's a toss up between Gus Van Sant's
Psycho and Mighty Joe Young, the new Disney picture based on the old RKO
picture. (I knew I was in trouble when a polished, computer-generated
version of that famous RKO logo appeared before the head credits.) There
is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie,
period. (Witness the quick deaths of Buddy, Born To Be Wild and Congo.)
And while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable, it's also an
assembly line product through and through, lacking the charm and
unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it.
Theron is Jill Young: as a young girl in the wilds of Africa, she
befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by
poachers. That baby gorilla (nicknamed Joe) grows to immense
proportions, and adult Jill basically bides her time looking after him,
playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers. Enter
conservationist Greg (Paxton), who convinces Jill to move with Joe to
California, where they can protect him better in a controlled
environment. Joe is restless at first; no sooner does he finally settle
in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in L.A., plotting
Joe's demise. Suffice it to say, the movie could have been called "Joe:
Ape In The City."
Theron (so good in Devil's Advocate) and Paxton (so good in the recent A
Simple Plan) are fine actors, but not fine enough to transcend the
material, a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of Superman IV
and Mercury Rising. The plot arguably borrows more from Steven
Spielberg's The Lost World than the 1949 original, with the
computer-generated T-Rex-I mean, Joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets
for an encore; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this
final third, with Jill shouting, "Look, Joe's headed for the movie
theatre!" followed by a shot of Joe scaling Mann's Chinese Theater; a
moment later, Jill shouts again something like "Look, Joe's headed for
an amusement park!" And what do you know, there's Joe at the Pallisades
carnival, scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers.
The seams of last-minute edits to Mighty Joe Young show-unrelated scenes
are patched together with quick dissolves. The movie sure feels uneven,
regardless: act two is underdeveloped, while a little of Joe smashing
cars in act three goes a long, long way. Underwood (Tremors, Speechless)
was perhaps not the director for the job; even the plentiful, untamed
landscape looks dull in his hands. (Capturing the beauty of nature
requires more than his point and shoot style.)
I did enjoy certain sequences, especially the demoliton of a black-tie
dinner sequence; and the prologue, however implausible, is touching. (As
a tyke, Joe acts just like E.T.) Rick Baker's make-up effects and
puppetry are outstanding, the real star of the show-yet, for all its
technical flawlessness, the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to
love. (His facial expressions are variations on a scowl.) To be fair, I
saw Mighty Joe Young in a cinema packed with wailing children-it's a
wonder I was able to decipher the dialogue. It's certainly not a film
for very young kids-intense fighting scenes may scare them, while any
time Joe's not on camera may bore them to tears. (Note: older boys are
more likely to be dazzled by Theron's colourful array of tank tops.) I
suspect bland Mighty Joe Young is passable entertainment for a family
outing, but they sure don't make em like they used to.

Title
Review for Gattaca (1997)
starring Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, Jude Law
written and directed by Andrew Niccol
How I wanted to love Gattaca. From its bizzare opening credit
sequence, in which we see nail clippings and stubble fall to a neon
blue ground in slow motion, we know we're in store for unusual
Hollywood fare. But as with many directorial debuts (Niccol was given
a chance to direct based on the originality of his screenplay),
Gattaca falls short not in ambition but in execution.
Hawke stars as Vincent, a custodian in "the not so distant future",
who dreams of becoming an astronaut. High hopes, indeed, for in this
future births are genetically manipulated to help conceive "perfect"
children, and our naturally birthed hero has both myopia and a heart
condition which prevent him from becoming anything more than a
second-class citizen. "In the future, discrimination has come down to
a science," he intones in (seemingly endless) narration.
Enter Jerome (Law), a "valid" citizen recently left paralyzed from a
car accident. He'll assist Vincent by donating his perfect blood and
perfect urine for a price, a price which the desperate janitor gladly
accepts. A few months later, Vincent, now calling himself Jerome, is
an eager executive of the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, welcome in
the rooms he was once only allowed to sweep. But when the Mission
Director's murder coincides with "Jerome"'s promotion to astronaut,
Vincent worries in the act of investigation his true identity may be
uncovered.
To his credit, Niccol sets about telling his complex story in a simple
manner, with emphasis on emotions and not science. But said story is
also repetitive, clicheed, and a romantic subplot between Vincent and
Irene (Thurman) is oddly unerotic and unsentimental. Yes, they're
essentially clones, but they're not robots! It doesn't help that Uma
Thurman is weightless as an actress, upstaged by her own beauty.  The
most effective performance comes from Law, who in a few broad strokes
creates a realistic, sympathetic, tragic figure worthy of a better
film.
And, while no plot string is left untied, there are too many endings
and pat resolutions. More often than not lately I find myself wanting
a film to finish twenty minutes before it does (Ransom is a perfect
recent example), and Gattaca is no exception. Though I will have fond
memories of Michael Nyman's lovely score, some of the production
design, and the performances of Ethan Hawke and Jude Law, I will
always recall Gattaca as having, like its main character, too many
flaws to be taken seriously.

Title
Review for Truman Show, The (1998)
THE TRUMAN SHOW ***1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(By now, most of you know how much my site SUCKS.
Come visit this train wreck of a webpage, anyway:
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers
Some cool new features, plus a Little Shop of Horrors (1986) rare
DVD auction until June 12th.)
starring Jim Carrey, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Natasha McElhone
screenplay by Andrew Niccol
directed by Peter Weir
Weir is well-respected in Hollywood for turning scripts with difficult
subject-matter into deceptively simple, powerful films, The Mosquito
Coast (utopia) and Fearless (post-traumatic stress disorder) among
them. In The Truman Show, Weir essentially breathes life into the
now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from
the inside-out. It certainly helps that he has an underrated performer
in top-form playing the title character, Truman Burbank.
By now you must be aware of the premise: unbeknownst to him, Truman
(Carrey) is the star of his own TV series, a 24-7 peep-show in which
he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations;
people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his
genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants. `Seahaven', his
hometown, and the show itself, are the brainchild of Christof
(Harris), who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon,
directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras.  For 30
years, Truman suspects nothing-`We accept the reality we're
given,' poses Christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny
town and visit a long lost love in `Fiji' (McElhone, who was
actually an actress fired by Christof for trying to break the
confidentiality agreement) overwhelms him. Thus, Christof and his team
suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of
Seahaven intact, lest Truman discover the world outside and put an end
to the highly-rated program.
In a few broad strokes, Weir creates a convincing second-reality, and
he has the good sense not to bring Christof into the picture until
almost three-quarters through. This allows us to comprehend and accept
Truman's world before we contextualize it. For all his madness,
Christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship,
and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it.
Truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be,
well, so darn nice; like a sibling (or, perhaps more appropriately, a
caged animal in an interactive zoo), they want to see him succeed. The
surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight
screenplay and a sympathetic Carrey-he really is an everyman here,
abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible, wide-eyed
bewilderment. Cinematically, The Truman Show is impeccable, stylishly
photographed by Peter Biziou and littered with symbolic images. As
well, it employs Wojciech Kilar's piece "Zycie za zycie'
masterfully and beautifully. If the film has any flaws, one may find
them in Laura Linney's characterization as Meryl, Truman's
"wife" (I doubt that Betty Crocker impersonation would fool anyone),
and in a subplot involving Truman's `father', which feels
curiously incomplete.
There are a few stupendous sequences, and the film pulls off a
wonderful trick: we become Truman's audience as much as the loyal
viewers in the film. They wear buttons asking `How will it end?'
I couldn't wait to know myself, though I didn't exactly want it
to end, for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most
complex-summer picture in years.

Title
Review for Replacements, The (2000)
THE REPLACEMENTS ZERO STARS (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Brooke Langton, Jack Warden
screenplay by Vincent McKewin
directed by Howard Deutch
Did the makers of The Replacements realize that Major League had already 
been reinvented as a football movie, under the title Necessary Roughness ? 
(So indiscreetly, in fact, that the former's sunglasses-wearing baseball 
logo became a sunglasses-wearing football one.) Given how many other motion 
pictures The Replacements, which appears to have been edited in a blender, 
openly (and badly) plagiarizes, I'm sure the answer is "yes." "But," they'd 
very possibly tell you, "our movie has Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman; 
theirs had Sinbad and Kathy Ireland."
"But," I'd very possibly reply, "your movie is from the director of The 
Great Outdoors, theirs The Man with One Red Shoe." In this example, Reeves 
and Hackman are nothing more than marketing advantages.
Reeves' casting does the product itself no favours; I never thought I'd 
find myself writing that he's too interesting an actor for Shane Falco, a 
character whose sole defining trait is his non-sports-related job of 
scraping barnacles from docked boats. When he leaves this task, to fill in 
for the Washington Sentinels' picketing quarterback (also white, natch), it 
seems to suck the life out of him; Falco observes the law of comedy 
screenwriting that says the leading man, unless a former stand-up, shalt 
not be granted the same funny dialogue and wacky affectations of his 
co-stars because he already has the looks.
This maxim is also common to producer Jerry Bruckheimer's schlocky 
actioners, which may as well be official comedies. (See Nicolas Cage in 
Gone in Sixty Seconds.) I searched for his name in The Replacements ' 
closing credits and was shocked by its absence; the film's requisite 
recruiting montage, once a staple of the sports genre and since co-opted by 
Bruckheimer, could be substituted by that of Armageddon and few outside the 
know would catch the switcheroo.
As the retired football coach returning to the field during a player's 
strike on a lost coin toss, Hackman handpicks the substitute team in a 
scene replete with headshots that could just as easily have unfolded in a 
casting agency. He rounds up, in no special order: a Sumo wrestler; an 
aggro SWAT cop (Swingers' Jon Favreau, discovering his inner ham); a gentle 
deaf guy; a college-football leaguer (Keanu); a Welsh soccer pro (Notting 
Hill 's Rhys Ifans); a Born-again; a grumpy convict; twin thugs; and, but 
of course, a Gloria Gaynor-loving sprinter (wiry Orlando Jones). These bad 
news bores are unfairly asked to win two out of three games. That they'll 
manage this, albeit with 'side-splitting' difficulty, is presumed (why 
break formula in the climax, of all places?); ergo, after they lost their 
first match, I wondered why a theatre should bother projecting the 
remaining reels at all.
It's not as if The Replacements is entertaining enough to supersede the 
foreordained, unless your idea of fun is not one but three prostitutions of 
Gaynor's "I Will Survive", or a nervous vomit sequence (if you saw Any 
Given Sunday, what you're now experiencing is called déjŕ vu ). The jokes 
are fusty and/or unpleasant--the filmmakers treat us like a Jerry Springer 
audience, cuing us to laugh dirisively at the sight of overweight dancers 
and whatnot. (Golden oldies include the love interest (Brooke Langton, 
redeemingly sexy) who drives so recklessly it scares Falco, a note-for-note 
update of a much wittier aside from Annie Hall.)
The Replacements also wears its moral heart on the wrong sleeve, and in 
doing so, actually perpetuates more clichés. We learn that football is for 
heroes, but cheerleading is a dishonourable trade--the head of the 
cheerleading squad must also ply in a more legitimate profession, as a 
barkeep in her deceased father's establishment, thus permitting moments in 
which she bonds with Falco by fondly fingering old photographs. And, as 
unsympathetic as I am to the demands of "spoiled multimillionaires" 
(McKewin's term for striking athletes), the film's promotion of 
union-busting shook me up a bit--I'm not warm to the idea of a young, dumb 
and full of come target demographic getting their socio-political 
discussion from big-studio bilge. (--- For more first-run, DVD, and

Review for Man in the Iron Mask, The (1998)
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK ** (out of four)
-by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(For more purple prose check out
FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504
I now include a section where YOU the surfer can recommend movies to
ME and other netheads. Have a freakin' good time.)
starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gabriel
Byrne, Gerard Depardieu
based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas
written and directed by Randall Wallace
DiCaprio is a wonderful screen presence, possessed of an androgynous
beauty; he would have been at home in a silent film, for his cat's
eyes telegraph everything he's feeling. He's also very much a product
of the nineties: the only reason he worked in Titanic is because Jack
Dawson was a man out of his element, a bad boy hipster on a ship full
of snobs. Put frilly clothes on Leo and ask him to portray a historic
Frenchman, and said eyes suddenly convey confusion. He is an actor out
of his element as Rimbaud in Total Eclipse and, now, as King Louis XIV
in The Man In The Iron Mask.
The film begins with heinous King Louis ordering the slaughter of
Jesuit traitors to D'Artangan (Byrne), his loyal Captain of the Royal
Guard. Then Louis falls in lust with the engaged Christine, and orders
the slaughter of her fiancee. This leads Athos (Malkovich), the father
of the dead fiancee, on a rampage. He reteams with ex-Musketeers
Aramis (Irons) and Porthos (Depardieu), and they concoct a revenge
plan: the release of Phillipe, Louis's secret identical twin, who has
been kept for years in a dungeon, his face shielded by an iron mask. A
switcheroo is performed, with harrowing results.
DiCaprio is not the only weak link in the chain. Malkovich's
performance feels phoned-in, Judith Godreche as Christine is
unremarkable, and the remaining members of the cast are forced to
repeat "All for one and one for all" ad nauseum. Randall Wallace's
adaptation is problematic: the dialogue lacks flavour, wit,
intelligence, and period nuances. As a debut director, he brings
nothing unique to the table cinematically; picture a high school play
enacted on Masterpiece Theater. There are a handful of decent moments,
and Depardieu stands out as the womanizing, suicidal Porthos. He's
also the only male Francophone to be found in a story that takes place
entirely in France.
It's a shame DiCaprio had to follow up the biggest film in history
with The Man In The Iron Mask. Perhaps working with this stellar cast
convinced him it might work. The film, despite being miles ahead in
quality of Disney's recent Musketeers picture (Charlie Sheen, we
hardly knew you were gone), is simply not the grand, powerful epic it
wants to be.  Diverting, yes, but I think the next time I crave The
Three Musketeers, I'll stick with the chocolate bar.

Review for Armageddon (1998)
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers
New address. Same old attitude. Don't forget to recommend a film,
read the journal, or send me some of that nasty HATE MAIL.)
It rocks-actually, lots of rocks fly at us or from us, in slow or fast
motion, at several points in the film. They seem
like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead
of just propelling forward, and when they
land-once in a while, when we need a break from the space sequences-they
cause damage enough to destroy the
Chrysler building and the like. (Nary a mention of these apocalyptic
events is made after they occur.) They also just
might be the most interesting element of ARMAGEDDON, a steroid user's
answer to Deep Impact.
Bruce Willis stars as Harry Stamper, a famed oil-driller commissioned by
the White House and NASA to stop a
giant asteroid before it travels beyond "zero barrier" and destroys our
planet. Why an oil driller? They require
someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile
into said asteroid. (In one unintentionally (?)
hilarious sequence, NASA asks Harry to inspect a deep-core driller they
built based on his own blueprints; it is poorly
constructed-Harry criticizes almost every aspect of it. We trust NASA to
build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids?) Harry
assembles the obligatory "ragtag" bunch of "cowboys", including a blond
guy, a fat guy, a black guy, a wiseass, and the man who is sleeping with
his daughter (Affleck). Once they reach space, we experience sequence
after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent
a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to
do with it; I cannot count the number of times they almost fail the
mission on all my fingers and toes. Whether or not
they save the day, I will not reveal. Nor will you care.
I will say this: you know you're in trouble when Deep Impact dwarfs your
asteroid movie in terms of emotion and
scope. Willis has barely a chance to come alive; ditto for Affleck.
Their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third
act, in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the
material. Steve Buscemi's character-the
wiseass-is exceptionally problematic. "Rockhound", as he's called, is
sarcastic and foolish, so they tape him to a
chair, where he spends most of the film. So why did they bring him up
there to begin with? Rather, why write him
into the film?-give his almost-witty one-liners to serious Willis, who
scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic
tendencies: at one point he chases after Affleck with his shotgun for
screwing his daughter, firing often and causing
significant damage to his oil rig. I'm guessing he qualifies under NASA
guidelines as someone unfit for space travel,
at least in my world where the sky is blue. Liv Tyler is pretty and
humourless, as always; suspiciously, four of her
father's band's ("Aerosmith") songs grace the soundtrack. Director
Michael Bay lays the visual and sound effects
on thick, like ketchup, eventually drowning the movie on-screen. (The
middle hour is a non-sensical, pyrotechnic
assault on the average primate's brain.) Whenever someone dies in this
movie, a crew member inevitably yells out
"We lost (insert dead person's last name here)!" I must admit that not
once could I distinguish a dead
oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one, and close-ups of the corpses'
faces beneath cracked helmets provided little
assistance, as their skin was often covered in fake blood.
ARMAGEDDON is not as terrible movie as Godzilla. It looks nicer, and has
fewer plot-holes within its equally
ludicrous framework. It has a vivid soundmix. But at almost
two-and-a-half hours, I could not believe how little
actually happened over the course of the story. The love story has been
played up in the ads, perhaps hoping to
catch people before they recover from Titanic-fever. Bollocks! The
lovers in the film are miles apart
throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace
them with obligatory shots of Liv Tyler
tearing up while Ben Affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler.
Remember a little film called Jaws? In this film, three
independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a
fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark. They didn't much like each
other at first; eventually, they started to
respect one another. One of Jaws' great scenes involved the
would-be-Ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling
stories. This is the sort of male-bonding foreign to Bay or his
producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, who throw too many
characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds
that the world is about to end. Not once do
we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-I'd be
surprised if these actors bothered to
introduce themselves to one another before "action" was called. A male
friend who loved the film suggested to me
that perhaps I cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their
souls, who believe in dying macho concepts like
heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery. To this, I will respond
that the boys in ARMAGEDDON are neither
heroic, nor brave, nor smart, even: this team couldn't build a
birdhouse. And if I get no respect for disliking a movie
with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie
written by a team of body-builders and greeting card
authors-I've never been a prouder wimp my whole life.

Review for Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)
NOSFERATU: THE FIRST VAMPIRE ***1/2 (out of four)
-by Bill Chambers (wchamber@netcom.ca)
(Life is harsh; your website shouldn't be.
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/7504
aka FILM FREAK CENTRAL)
starring Max Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, Greta Schroder, John Gottowt
written by Henrik Galeen
directed by F.W. Murnau
Available in an all new video edition from Arrow Entertainment
($29.95), with an introduction by David Carradine, written &
produced by Wayne J. Keeley
F. W. Murnau's career ended sadly and prematurely. The German director
of such classics as "Sunrise" and "The Last Laugh"
died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make American
pictures at Paramount. Murnau was reportedly a giant man,
well over six feet, a towering figure probably incapable of anything
but a grand entrance. Which brings us to "Nosferatu: A
Symphony of Horror": surely he felt a kinship with his title
character, the looming vampire embodied by intimidating Max
Schreck; in one of the most indelible images in film history, silent
or otherwise, Schreck rises from his grave, gnarled hands
outstretched, and he's so big that part of his head is cropped by the
top of the frame.
The plot of "Nosferatu..." is lifted--unauthorized--from Bram Stoker's
"Dracula". The British Hutter is an eager real estate man
assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with Count
Orlock of Transylvania. He leaves behind girlfriend Emily,
only to discover Orlock's secret--he's a bloodsucker--and struggle to
return to England before the nosferatu reaches his lady
love. In addition to Schreck's performance, the cinematography and
effects are outstanding.
Arrow Video's digitally remastered version of the classic is something
of a mixed-coffin. The cover art features a red-tinted,
hairy, goateed vampire staring straight at you, his fanged mouth
agape, while the bodies of two sexy, writhing women entice you
below. Trouble is, Murnau's monster is pale-faced, bald, pointy-eared,
and non-goateed, and there isn't a single sexy, writhing
woman to be found in his movie. This sort of misleading packaging
makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of
ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been
extracted. Additionally, notifying the viewer that this is in
fact Murnau's film seems like afterthought since his name and the
genuine title are written in small print below our goateed
vampire.
That said, a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself.
The original elements are not in the best
condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so
we're still dealing with a slightly washed out, scratched,
jittering image. But at least the day and night scenes are tinted
sepia and blue, respectively, especially helpful to an audience who
may question Nosferatu's waltzing around during what seems like
sunlight (it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties).
The title cards have been redone, and they are legible, accurate, and
digitally altered to flicker--a very nice touch. (Even the
opening copyright warning flickers!) The score has been replaced by
music from Type O Negative, a hard-rock group,
arguably gothic, and their songs underscore the film nicely--
certainly the coolest video a band can ask for. When our
hero, Hutter, first steps onto the doomed carriage to Count Orlock's
castle, we hear a well-timed "Now you're dead!" from
lead singer Peter Steele.
David Carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host; he fiddles with
a blade and cane while introducing the film. After the
feature, which runs about 63 minutes, is included a new music video
from Type O Negative, the black-and-white fang-fest
"Black No. 1". Of course, "Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror" is the
main attraction, and while my latest viewing raised
questions (Why is the woman called Emily in the title cards but
"Mina"--as Bram Stoker called her--in Hutter's letters?, for
instance), it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and
been stolen from. Coppola's 1992 "Bram Stoker's Dracula"
owes a great stylistic debt to Murnau's masterpiece, but the one thing
it couldn't thieve was the original's abstract charms. This
latest incarnation from Arrow will probably- -like the rescored
"Metropolis" a few years back--turn a silent film into more
palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks.

Title
Review for Alien: Resurrection (1997)
starring Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, J.E. Freeman
written by Joss Whedon
directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet
The title has a double meaning. In this fourth installment of the
series, not only do producers David Giler and Walter Hill revive their
beloved Ellen Ripley (Weaver), who met her fate last time around, but
they attempt to resurrect the franchise itself: the financial unsuccess
of Alien3 was thought to have killed it.
You can't keep a good monster down. Unfortunately. What was a wonderful,
complete trilogy is now a quadrology that ends with the promise of more,
and if this resurrection is any indication, I'm talking about a series
in decline.
The premise is this: Ripley is revived through genetic cloning on a
military ship. A band of ne'er-do-wells arrive on said ship for a cargo
transfer. One of them, Call (Ryder), fears Ripley when they meet, for
she is aware that the clone is part-alien. What she is not aware of are
the twelve aliens also aboard the vessel-military doctors are trying to
teach the monsters good manners. Must I write that the experiment goes
awry?
Jeunet, famed French director of `Delicatessan', has tried to combine
the spirits of the second and third films. `Resurrection' is artfully
made, aesthetically pretty like David Fincher(`Seven')'s part three, and
it contains some rousing gun play and chase sequences, as in James
Cameron's `Aliens'. But I get the sense that Jeunet's language
difference presented great problems in his assessment of the script,
which is half-baked and desperately familiar. For example, he casts
several colourful-looking people in supporting roles only to hand them
the kind of dialogue you'd hear in `Independence Day'. They're unique
ducks in the same shooting gallery we've been to three times before. And
the alien logic has worn thin-I never did understand which one was
laying eggs, or why this was happening since the script went to great
pains explaining that the queen now had a womb.
Turn off the sound and one is left with a stunning motion picture, a two
hour Romantic painting. The effects are impressive, and there is one
dazzling, showstopping setpiece (involving swimming aliens). But great
art direction does not equal great filmmaking, and therein lies the
problem: the most basic movie element--the screenplay--is still the most
important, and `Alien: Resurrection' made me nostalgic for the original
trilogy, which is not what a sequel should do.

Review for Chocolate War, The (1988)
THE CHOCOLATE WAR ***1/2 (out of four)

FILM FREAK CENTRAL

New address. New attitude. Same crappy writing.)
starring Ilan-Mitchell Smith, Wally Ward, John Glover, Adam Baldwin
based on the novel by Robert Cormier
written and directed by Keith Gordon
The Chocolate War was my favourite book in high school-an expansion of
Catcher in the Rye's first chapters, or Dead Poet's Society with sharper
teeth, take your pick-so for years I feared the film version. Last week,
I hunkered down before the set to bite the bullet at last; no matter how
deviant the movie was, I could forever cling to the memory of that first
read in tenth grade. The opening moments of Gordon's movie (he played
the psycho-nerd in John Carpenter's weak Christine) put me at ease. This
1988 adaptation is not letter-faithful, but it does preserve the tone of
its source material.
Smith stars as Jerry Renault, the new kid at Trinity, an all-boys
Catholic school; he is fresh food for the Vigils, an underground student
organization whose sole purpose is to drive teachers and students batty
with complex practical jokes. Publicly represented by the snake-charming
Archie (Ward, née Langham, who played Phil the head writer on "The Larry
Sanders Show" and is barely recognizable here), the Vigils convince
Jerry to refuse participation in the school's annual fundraiser-a
chocolate sale-for ten days. At the end of his "mission," however, Jerry
continues to say "no," causing much consternation for terrible Brother
Leon (Glover), who reluctantly enlists the Vigils to help change Jerry's
mind. Jerry, you see, has become a rebellious symbol at the school;
overall sales have declined at a time when Trinity desperately needs the
extra funds.
THE CHOCOLATE WAR is extremely low budget, perhaps to Gordon's
advantage; often several chapters of the book are compressed into
spontaneous, poetic montages. At times, his camerawork and direction of
actors recalls the unpredictability of Cassavettes. Glover is pure
malevolence, and Ward is outstanding--Gordon's revision of the novel
wisely plants Archie at the forefront: Archie becomes a tragic figure
all his own, an insecure weasel as powerless as Jerry, really. Just as
we can't stop the inevitable death of our loved ones, we can't puppeteer
those around us, either. THE CHOCOLATE WAR's religious setting is
appropriate: by learning about God, perhaps the students and teachers
can learn to be God. (The boxes of the chocolates
even resemble bibles.) With this concept in mind, the movie's ending,
which is quite a departure from the book, is more dramatically
appropriate, logical, and truthful. And pitiful. Only Jerry is
problematic: his introversion on paper was somewhat painful to behold,
and his anti-conformity cathartic, but cinematically the character walks
a fine line between shy and dull.
With a new-wave soundtrack featuring the likes of Yaz and Peter Gabriel,
The Chocolate War is a hipper, meaner take on separate school life than
most like pictures. It's also a multi-layered film this short review
cannot do justice. I needn't have put off seeing it this long.

Do I ever shut up?)
starring David Schwimmer, Jason Lee, Mili Avital, Bonnie Hunt
written by James Frey & Doug Ellin
directed by Doug Ellin
Post-Chasing Amy, a slew of love-triangle movies: this month we have
Kissing A Fool, co-starring Amy's own Lee, and April brings us The
Object of My Affection, which may as well be titled Chasing Allan, for
it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay
roommate. (To be absolutely Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon about it, that
film stars Schwimmer's Friend Jennifer Aniston.) If only Kevin Smith
could write them all...
Schwimmer stars as womanizing Chicago sportscaster Max, who falls in
love with his best friend Jay (Lee)'s book editor Samantha (Avital) a
mere twenty-four hours after meeting her. They are soon engaged, and
Max, because of his own raging libido, grows suspicious of Samantha's
fidelity. He convinces Jay to flirt with Samantha during the
development of his book, to "test her". The trouble is, Jay might be
secretly in love with her.
To stretch this flat, sitcom premise to feature length, the plot is
framed by a climactic wedding, at which Bonnie Hunt recounts the
triangular tale--the events leading up to the nuptials--to an annoying
fat man and his silly girlfriend.  Hunt has the best comic timing of
anyone in the film; Schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly
humorous dialogue; and Lee, poor Lee, is miscast. So hysterically
funny in Chasing Amy, here he is forced to repress his comic
instincts: to swear, to yell, to talk about oral sex... The script's
idea of a character trait is to stress that Jay is a "sensitive man",
and then show him drinking Pepto Bismol when he's stewing over his
girl trouble. As for Avital, an Israeli actress, she is warm and
sweet, but we don't know anything about her character other than that
it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious
things. She also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful Kari
Wuhrer, who plays Schwimmer's assistant and personal temptress,
turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on Vertigo.
There are a handful, a smattering, of good scenes in Kissing A Fool. I
enjoyed a moment in a comedy club, during which Jay gets up and asks
"Has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to
kill her?" over and over until he's booted off stage.  There are also
a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that's
on the page. Kissing A Fool is never as clever as the Thursday night
joke-machine Friends that spawned Schwimmer's movie career, so save
yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to
back.

Review for In & Out (1997)
starring Kevin Kline, Matt Dillon, Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck
screenplay by Paul Rudnick
directed by Frank Oz
Kline stars as Howard Brackett, a dedicated high school teacher
engaged to the lovely Emily (Cusack). One of his past students,
Cameron Drake (Dillon), is up for an Academy Award, for a film about a
homosexual army soldier titled "To Serve and Protect". Brackett is
happy as a clam, until Drake wins and outs his favourite teacher
before the world. Over the next three days, Brackett has to decide
whether or not to deny the charge and carry on a charade by marrying
his fiancee, or take the advice of gay newscaster Selleck, and jump
from the closet.
Rudnick, an openly gay screenwriter, is frequently a razor sharp wit,
and no character, straight or gay, is spared. Take supermodel Shalom
Harlow (an Oshawa, Ontario, Canada native, and once a schoolmate of
mine!), who, as Drake's waif-girlfriend, doesn't want to leave her
house at one point because she still has to "shower and vomit." Or
Wilfred Brimley, as Brackett's father, who loves his son
unconditionally, even if he "got drunk, climbed the clock tower with a
shotgun and took out the whole town." But amusing as it is--there are
a great many belly laughs--the picture feels curiously cold, and the
mechanics of the plot curiously manufactured, as if it were a bad
script with a good dialogue doctor.  The Oscar ceremony is virtually
laughless, if only because it's the most off-target recreation of the
event this side of The Bodyguard. I realize that realism may not have
been the goal of this sequence, but aren't imitations and impressions
funnier when they're dead-on?
Kevin Kline is terrific, as always; Dillon's character starts out
bitingly mean--is he doing Brad Pitt?--and then goes disappointingly
soft. Selleck is good--Magnum P.I. fans everywhere will no doubt be
shocked by a certain standout scene--in a TV-ready sort of
way. Director Oz, who has in his lifetime voiced Fozzie Bear, Yoda,
and directed the brilliant Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, has a good sense
of pace, and his comic timing is often spot-on, but he lacks the edge
to make a truly cynical movie, and so the proceedings are best
described as wishy-washy.

Title
Review for Cider House Rules, The (1999)
THE CIDER HOUSE RULES *** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (bill@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Tobey Maguire, Michael Caine, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo
screenplay by John Irving, based on his novel
directed by Lasse Hallström
If, occasionally during The Cider House Rules, one corner of the screen
curled up and peeled away like a turning page to reveal the next scene,
the wipe would seem entirely natural. I haven't encountered a movie that
so resembles the experience of reading a good paperback this year, no
doubt because John Irving wrote the tearjerking The Cider House Rules as
a book first and a screenplay second.
"Annie" it's not: at a depression-era New England orphanage-cum-abortion
clinic, Dr. Wilbur Larch (Caine) has successfully preened one of the
abandoned kids, Homer Wells (Maguire), into both his professional equal
and an upstanding young man, an example for the other boys and girls to
follow.
After spending twenty-some-odd years in Larch's care, Homer justly
develops wanderlust, and he leaps at the opportunity to fly the coop
with a beautiful patient, Candy (Theron), and Wally, her soldier mate
(Paul Rudd). Larch is deeply offended by his surrogate son's decision,
and reveals an X-ray indicating Homer's bad heart, which will stop
working if he gets overexcited, but neither scare tactics nor loyalty
can prevent the inevitable: true to his namesake, Homer will have his
odyssey.
It suits Maguire that he must remain calm and somewhat idle at all times
in The Cider House Rules, since the actor's greatest feature is a pair
of observant eyes. Before leaving for war, Wally finds Homer a new job
at a cider house, where he will be the only white employee among migrant
blacks. For those who haven't correctly presumed, Candy falls for Homer
in her boyfriend's absence, and thus begins a passionate love affair
between them. The story contains other "meanwhile"s; we are kept abreast
of Larch's frustrating situation with the bureaucrats who want to tamper
with his operation as well as that of a sick orphan named Fuzzy. The
latter constitutes a shameless subplot (right down to the adorable
child's name) born of the Chaplin tradition.
Caine is winning as the ether-addicted doctor, though his American
accent takes some getting used to. (The filmmakers have added a line or
two about why Larch sometimes sounds English.) I appreciated Larch's
selfishness, and Caine's willingness to play prickly. The incandescent
Theron is probably the weakest of the ensemble, through no fault of her
own-Candy is drawn as blandly wholesome (abortion notwithstanding), and
her indecision (Am I in love with Homer or Wally?) is aggravating.
Both Maguire and Lindo, as Mr. Rose, the boss of the cider house, are
exemplary. Lindo's initial smiley authority complements Maguire's
preternatural stillness-Mr. Rose goes through a transformation, at least
in our eyes, that I won't reveal here, which Lindo handles with finesse.
Just when the film is becoming a little too precious, Mr. Rose provides
welcome conflict, and without becoming a full-fledged villain. Lindo has
been blessed with what is, say I, the movie's most memorable scene, a
breathy, heartrending apologia.
Swede helmer Hallström (My Life as a Dog) hasn't strayed far from his
1993 effort, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, in stylistic terms: apart from
obvious period differences (Grape takes place in the modern era), the
two films share timeless images, as well as gentility. Just four
pictures after his American career suffered a false start with the
unengaging weepie Once Around, Hallström has Hollywood Oscar contenders
licked. Though not formulaic, The Cider House Rules is in the mode of
old-fashioned crowd-pleasers, passionate tales of self-discovery set
against a historical backdrop. If only Hallström had not relied on
Rachel Portman's syrupy and intrusive score, which confirms too often
that we're watching melodrama.
The Cider House Rules retained a novelistic structure in the adaptation:
its peaks feel like chapter breaks. Much is covered over the course of
two hours-and-fifteen minutes, including pro-choice (the movie argues in
favour of it with worst case scenarios, which may ruffle a few
feathers), young love, and race relations. (It's a brilliant conceit,
really: Homer's passivity not only spares the audience the arguments
that typically ensue between on-screen adulterers, it also immediately
puts his oppressed co-workers at ease-they don't consider him a threat,
despite his skin colour.) Each of these issues is carefully handled,
though the episodic nature of the plotting inevitably means that some
resolutions are more satisfying than others.
Where The Cider House Rules most brings to mind a John Irving read is in
its aftereffects. When the first closing credit appeared, I experienced
three stages of post-partum. First, elation-what a finish! Then came
relief-the film is so stuffed it leaves you a little bloated. Then came
a profound sense of displacement: I hadn't realized how seductive its
world was. Hallström has married delicate, spare visuals and solid
performances to Irving's low key yet enthralling narrative. The outcome
is a grandly satisfying mainstream entertainment with few shortcomings.

Title
Review for American Psycho (2000)
starring Christian Bale, Chloë Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto
screenplay by Guinevere Turner, based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis
directed by Mary Harron
It is the late 1980s, and creature-of-habit Patrick Bateman (Christian
Bale, in a perversely mesmerizing performance), a Master of the
Universe, has it all. He works at the prestigious Manhattan firm of
Pierce and Pierce, smokes expensive cigars, and inhabits a bleach-white
apartment, which used to signify wealth. What's a man who has everything
to do?
Murder, he wrote. Of course we knew that Bret Easton Ellis' sanguinary
satire American Psycho, a novel I devoured many years ago, would be
toned down in its translation to the silver screen. Unfortunately,
director Mary Harron and screenwriter Guinevere Turner have also
de-fanged the non-violent remainder of Ellis' free-floating narrative
and given it a Hollywood horseshit ending.
Such neutering was partially uncontrollable: on the page, first person
descriptions of title character Patrick Bateman's obsessively regimented
life read like a series of product placements, and everything down to
shampoo became a status symbol; Harron could not obtain permission to
mention various brands, and thus Patrick's materialism is no longer so
relentless.
But other changes are less reasonable, such as the by now prerequisite
twist ending, which castrates the film by reducing the Ted Bundy-ish
Bateman to a live-action Milton, the subservient office drone who would
wait until a co-worker was just out of earshot before making ridiculous
threats on his life in a series of Mike Judge cartoons.
The script's new, Fight Club-esque climactic scenario is an empty
gesture of atonement--Harron and Turner have glibly apologized for the
concept itself, literalising a snippet of Patrick's voice-over: "There
is no real me." They've also homogenized Wall Street; while the film
nicely plays up the interchangeable identities of its power-brokers
(they're distinguishable only by their business cards), it doesn't
emphasize their rock star existence. (I recall only one instance of
heavy drug use among the inner circle, whereas Ellis has Patrick
pill-popping every third line to tune his behaviour like a radio.)
I normally don't harp on the differences between a book and its
cinematic adaptation, but we're not dealing with a mass-market
bestseller here. The only reason to shoot American Psycho is to say you
did, not to start a franchise or mount a star vehicle. Harron's American
Psycho is more interested in toying with our desire to see it (witness
the clichéd opening sequence in which we are misled to believe that
raspberry sauce is actually dripping blood) than shedding some light on
the era of conspicuous consumption. (Or, at least, Ellis' take on it.)
The one great, arguably feminist aspect that Harron and Turner have
brought to the project is a sense of paranoid fantasy: the movie
occasionally steps outside of Patrick's P.O.V., which Ellis never did,
to illuminate the fear of his victims.
___
BY THE WAY...
Because I live in Ontario, Canada, I viewed the uncut version of
American Psycho. Harron was forced to trim about one minute of rather
tame kink from a three-way sex scene in order to avoid the stigmatic
NC-17 rating, just another demonstration of the Motion Picture
Association of America's bass ackwards agenda: Patrick butchering a
homeless man and chasing a woman with chainsaw were deemed fit for mass
consumption without any alterations.

Title
Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN **** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers; wchamber@netcom.ca
starring Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Matt Damon
screenplay by Robert Rodat
directed by Steven Spielberg
In this fictional but truthful picture, Tom Hanks stars as Captain
Miller; his squadron has just survived D-Day at Omaha Beach when they
are reassigned. Essentially a P.R. move from the head office, Miller and
his seven men must search for a missing paratrooper, one Private James
Francis Ryan-whose three brothers have been killed in action-and send
him home to his distraught mother. The search leads them across French
battlefields... I suppose it's not giving away too much to say that they
eventually locate Ryan (Damon) and discover their moral duty as soldiers
in an active war surpasses the exact definition of their mission.
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is possibly the most violent movie I have ever seen.
At least, it seemed that way because of its connection to history and,
in the second half of the film, my emotional attachment to the
characters. In addition to Miller, we have Sgt. Horvath (Sizemore), who
collects dirt from the various places he's travelled; New Yorker Pvt.
Reiben (Burns), eager to impress with attitude; gentle T/4 Medic Wade
(Giovanni Ribisi), whom at one point recopies a letter for a dead
soldier so that it is not mailed-out bloodstained; lone-Jew Pvt. Mellish
(Adam Goldberg), for whom the war has obviously become deeply personal;
Cpl. Upham (Jeremy Davies), a gun-shy translator fluent in French and
German; God-fearing Pvt. Jackson (Barry Pepper) and Pvt. Caprazo (Vin
Diesel), both exemplary servicemen.
I have just done what the filmmakers basically resist: breaking the
squadron down into genre types. The soldiers remain ordinary human
beings in unpredictable circumstances to the bitter end, by turns
cowardly, certifiable, happy, melancholy, etc. If one of them dies, we
feel as sad as if another of them dies. Like combat, such deaths are
always shocking and instantaneous. Spielberg's latest film doesn't just
have a generic, you-are-there feeling: his camera zigzags like a scared
LIFE photographer trapped in the heat of the action, racing behind the
troops, falling into the sea, dizzily lingering on some gruesome
carnage, like the man who is searching for his missing arm, or the boy
who takes off his shot helmet in relief only to be killed seconds later.
The layered story places its anti-violent and anti-war sentiments
clearly up-front: the only way to hammer home the horror of armed
conflict is to display it uncensored. At one point, Reiben asks, Why
risk the eight of us for one guy?' and the irony was not lost on me:
nobody questions the validity of their involvement in WWII, a P.R. move
at its heart, also.
Which is why I'm only hesitant about the final shot of the movie: an
American flag flapping in the breeze. Proudly? That's open to debate; I
never felt SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was particularly patriotic, to its
credit. This is a smaller story than "America's War Effort". I'll
unabashedly admit it reduced me to tears. If it takes a popular
entertainment to put into context for so many young people what has
mostly been relegated to dryly-written textbooks, thank goodness it is
one of integrity and catharsis.

Review for Snake Eyes (1998)
SNAKE EYES ** (out of four)

FILM FREAK CENTRAL
http://www.geocities.com/~billchambers
New address. New attitude. Same crappy writing.)
starring Nicolas Cage, Gary Sinise, Carla Gugino, Stan Shaw
screenplay by David Koepp
directed by Brian DePalma
What a strange life! A mere seven hours after returning from Orillia's
CasinoRama (I actually came out ahead!), I was off to see a movie
basically about, as the title suggests, gambling: SNAKE EYES. This is
also the second film (after The Gingerbread Man) I've sat through this
week in which a raging hurricane provides a backdrop for the
shenanigans.
SNAKE EYES' plot is deceptively simple; don't let multiple-viewpoints
trick you into believing this assassination tale is more complex than
the average episode of "Vega$." A major casino/hotel: Homicide Detective
Rick Santoro (Cage) excitedly attends a big heavyweight showdown-fighter
Lincoln Tyler(Shaw)'s championship title is on the line-with his best
bud, Major Kevin Dunne (Sinise), a Washington sycophant assigned to
protect the Secretary of Defense, Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani), who
has a second row seat. A gorgeous, big-breasted redhead is suspiciously
situated nearby-when Dunne tries to check her ticket, she takes off. He
follows. Pow! Bam! Oomph! In Dunne's place sits a gorgeous, big-breasted
blonde (Gugino); as she quietly converses with Kirkland, Tyler is
knocked down for the first time in his career, and sniper shots are
fired at the crowd. An assassin is immediately caught, but not before
Kirkland has been killed and the mysterious blonde (who is actually a
brunette, and blind without her newly-crushed specs) escapes in a
stampede. Santoro, a gambling sleazebag with a checkered past, begins an
investigation, relishing the opportunity to gain some respect. His
detective work mostly consists of screaming at people until they become
so annoyed they talk. (It's as if he's envious of the boxers, who get to
pummel one another into submission.)
SNAKE EYES has numerous flaws, perhaps countless. For starters, Cage is
not playing a character here: his personality shifts from scene to
scene, even moment to moment, but this time out he's not playing a drunk
(Leaving Las Vegas) or a psychopath (Face/Off); he's an actor paddling
without a raft in a toneless performance. As for all that hooey about
"believe everything but your eyes," SNAKE EYES reveals its major baddies
early on, but flashbacks and long-winded exposition continue: we're
shown the solution to the puzzle and then asked to suffer through the
construction of the puzzle. Start at the conclusion of SNAKE EYES and
work backwards and the result is pretty much the same, a film
intricately but not intelligently structured. Characters who figured
heavily into the conspiratorial equation vanish without explanation
throughout the story. (And no, the hurricane has almost nothing to do
with the climax, but implausibility does.)
DePalma's virtuoso style (my apologies for resorting to such a worn out
praise) is a character in its own right here, and it is because of his
mastery of technique (rather, mastery of someone's-Hitchock's?
Godard's?-technique) that SNAKE EYES is a thousand-times more enjoyable
than it has any right to be. The opening set-piece is brilliantly
crafted, a long take that bests all his previous attempts (by now,
watching a DePalma movie includes the anticipation of his next edit-try
it as a drinking game) by snaking around corridors, through hotel rooms,
up and down stairwells, and finally, into the arena. SteadiCams were
invented for filmmakers like DePalma and cinematographers like SNAKE
EYES' Stephen H. Burum. DePalma also employs nifty split-screen
effects-his use of two simultaneous frames in one particular sequence is
terrific. DePalma may be the only MovieBrat whose seventies
sensibilities have remained utterly at his disposal. (I also liked how
he showed very little of the fight-the majority of the seven-round
battle happens off-camera; Dolby-ized punches clue us in to the action.)
The outcome of SNAKE EYES is a curious one. I find it hard to dismiss,
based on the director's aesthetic garnishes, for lack of a better word.
The movie is better than the sum of its parts, I guess, and it clicked
along pleasantly. But the script is weightless, and it's a shame DePalma
had to use up all these talented resources for the sake of screwing
around and exercising his filmmaking biceps.

Title
Review for Sweet Hereafter, The (1997)
starring Ian Holm, Sarah Polley, Bruce Greenwood, Tom McCamus
written by Atom Egoyan, based on the novel by Russell Banks
directed by Atom Egoyan
No filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as Atom Egoyan. I'm
referring, specifically, to the narrative form. In The Sweet
Hereafter, Egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his
Exotica or The Adjuster. Said story, of a fatal school bus accident in
the small town of Sam Dent, British Columbia, that shatters the morale
of the locals, is told in a most unstraightforward manner.
When the film opens, the accident has already happened, and Stephens
(the wonderful Holm), a polite ambulance-chaser, has arrived with the
promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really
occurred that fateful morning.  Throughout, we get to meet the parents
of the dead, broken souls who follow Stephens like "The Pied Piper"
(passages of which are read during the film). But there is one living
passenger, the paralyzed Nicole (Polley), whose dark secrets of a life
before the accident may affect her decision to testify.
We finally do see the accident, about three quarters into the film,
which is a stunning visual effect. A horrific long take that shows the
bus sliding, then stopping, then collapsing into a frozen lake, is the
best digital trickery in any movie this year and, perhaps, ever, in a
motion picture.
The fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied Stephens on an
airplane, traveling to meet his HIV-positive runaway daughter, as well
as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led
pre-accident.
I have a problem not with the story or story structure, but with
Egoyan's heavy- handedness behind the camera. For the first hour or
so, I can quite honestly say I was on the verge of tears; these are
miserable, miserable people. But that's just the problem: so anguished
are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while, when a lot of
sadness becomes too much. Also, a subplot involving incest rings
untrue. Perhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in
such a tasteful manner. There are two characters who are father and
daughter; when they first appeared I thought they were lovers. I was
half-right.
Nevertheless it's worth-seeing. The delightful critic Geoff Pevere
recently wrote that "American films are about action, Canadian films
are about consequences," hence a recent wave of films about the
effects of shock and death from Toronto directors, including Crash and
Kissed. The Sweet Hereafter is much better than either of these two
films, simply because it's not boring or, in the case of Kissed,
afraid of its own material (necrophilia). Egoyan is a fine, fine,
postmodern storyteller, whose work is entertaining, edgy and smart, if
a bit too intellectual at times. Though I harped on the weightiness of
the material, I was always absorbed, engrossed, and surprised by The
Sweet Hereafter.

Review for Rear Window (1954)
Just days before the death of Jimmy Stewart, inspired by a half-baked
A & E Biography of Alfred Hitchcock, I decided to give Rear Window a
second glance. History has been kind to Hitch's fifties pictures: just
look at the resurgence of Vertigo, which was a box office and critical
bomb in 1958. But unlike that film, repeated viewings of Rear Window
reveal it to be somewhat shallow and lacking the stylistic flourishes
that have helped some of his other beloved pictures stand the test of
time.
Stewart stars as Jeff, a photographer with a broken leg who has one
week left before release from his "plaster cocoon". With nothing but
the view from his window to wile away the hours, he begins to follow
the stories of his neighbours' lives: there's the sexy woman who likes
to dance in her underwear; the elderly lady who seems lonely and lost;
the happy Newleyweds; and the husband and wife who always argue. Jeff
sees nothing wrong with his preoccupation: voyeurism as
time-killer. Then the real excitement kicks in: the angry husband's
wife suddenly disappears, and he may or may not be disposing of her
body piece by piece using suitcases and trunks.
Grace Kelly costars as Jeff's glamourpuss girlfriend; their bickering
is dated, but Kelly's first appearance in the film--she plants a kiss
on Stewart's forehead in slow motion-- remains one of the most
sensual, memorable entrances in movie history.
Rear Window is a talky film, not unlike Hitchcock's experimental,
underpraised Rope.  Characters chew endlessly over motives, hash out
theories, and generally blather on like so many egomaniacs, though the
dialogue is more often than not engaging.  Hitchcock really triumphs
in two areas: a setpiece involving Kelly's character sneaking into the
apartment across the street, which is essentially the climax, is
wholly suspenseful. And he somehow manages to tie up every single
sub-sub-plot in a satisfying manner.
Mixed emotions, to be sure, but definitely worthy of your attention.

Title
Review for Permanent Midnight (1998)
PERMANENT MIDNIGHT *1/2 (out of four)
 starring Ben Stiller, Elizabeth Hurley, Maria Bello, Janeane Garofalo
screenplay by David Veloz, based on the novel by Jerry Stahl
directed by David Veloz
PERMANENT MIDNIGHT is a pretty bad movie, though it took me a few days to conclude this. The
film is more masturbatory than bleak, with its main character intent on confounding us with his
stupidity. (He has a $6000 a week drug habit.) Ultimately, as adapted by Veloz, Jerry Stahl
comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve; you are
less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself.
Ben Stiller plays Stahl, a young author who arrives in L.A. with ambition and a nasty drug
habit. He eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called Mr. Chompers (a
thinly veiled stand-in for "ALF": Chompers looks just like ALF except he's blue), marries a
producer (Hurley) so she can get a green card, and hooks up with a Spanish mother (Liz Torres),
who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons. Insert proverbial downward spiral here.
PERMANENT MIDNIGHT is structured mostly as a flashback, with recovering addict Bello meeting
Stiller (at a fastfood restaurant, where Stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab), taking
him back to a hotel, and between bouts of serious screwing, listening to his life story. I've
spent the last week trying to figure out why Stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly
gorgeous Hurley attractive-worse, I've been trying to figure out why Hurley DID find Stiller
attractive. As Stahl, Stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect (post-There's
Something About Mary) of either the actor or a comedy writer. What separates Stahl from the
hundreds of other Hollywood punk-junkies, it seems, is that Stahl wrote a book about his
idiocy. Watch Stahl shoot heroin next to a baby! Watch Stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with
smack-fueled babble! Stiller gives a technically flawless performance: the film could double as
a documentary on how to be a junkie. But PERMANENT MIDNIGHT is mostly soulless. When the movie
poses the question Will Stahl be saved? and then answers it in the form of Bello's character
(basically a shrink in black panties), could a person care less? In the film version of his
autobiography of the same name, Stahl doesn't need saving, he needs someone who will sit there
and listen to him go on about himself. If you learn anything about the other characters in this
movie, it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant Hollywood-types known to man. (Stahl
also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs. Is this
Hollywood...California?)
I learned very little about the entertainment business from PERMANENT MIDNIGHT and a whole lot
about an egotistical lunkhead. Of course you know that Stahl triumphed because he lived to talk
about his problems. So, basically, his drug habit got him a book deal, a movie based on his
life, and now he's apparently collaborating with Stiller on future projects. So much for the
moral of that story. TEMPORARY MIDNIGHT is more like it.

Title
Review for Suicide Kings (1997)
starring Christopher Walken, Jay Mohr, Dennis Leary, Sean Patrick
Flannery
written and directed by Peter O'Fallon
Walken stars as a mobster who is kidnapped and held for ransom by four
bratty rich kids.  It seems that a woman has also been kidnapped--she
is the sister of one of them (E.T.'s Henry Thomas) and the girlfriend
of another (Flannery)--and the asking price is $2 million, which said
snots are unable to cough up alone. They even cut off Walken's finger
to show they mean business, because they are desperate to save the
woman's life.
Suicide Kings is a terrible film. Walken aside, there isn't a single
appealing cast member. O'Fallon creates characters that are functional
types without any resonance. In an amusingly unironic scene, Walken
plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their
personalities to a tee--it's as if he was reading the summary sheet
for a casting director.
The plot is another issue entirely. O'Fallon is someone whom I'm
betting has seen Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects too many times,
for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence
they never return (do we really need the scene where Dennis Leary
beats up an abusive father with a toaster, which is entirely unrelated
to both the story and Leary's character, or the numerous anecdotal
sequences?), but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess, filled
with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses...  By the fourth
big revelation/twist, I had completely tuned out, wondering what on
Earth attracted these actors to the material.
Recently a peer, a fellow young filmmaker, informed me that he had an
idea for a movie about four guys, the mob, and the FBI. It occurred to
me then what's wrong with indies like Suicide Kings: I suspect
O'Fallon has never met a mobster, is not a rich man, doesn't deliver
endless "clever" monologues to his friends about his favourite types
of boots... In short, these guys are just riffing on other movies, and
in doing that, making the same film over and over and over
again. Tarantino found his niche and now hundreds of GenXers with
movie cameras are trying to find Tarantino's niche instead of carving
their own.  -Reviewed at the Toronto International Film Festival

Title
Review for Haunting, The (1999)
THE HAUNTING * (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (haunting@filmfreakcentral.net)
starring Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson
screenplay by David Self, based on The Haunting of Hill House by
Shirley Jackson
directed by Jan De Bont
"Some houses are born bad," goes The Haunting's tag line, to which I
must add, "Some movies, too." Nothing short of hiring a new cast, a
more literate screenwriter, and a new director could have saved this
tragically misguided adaptation of Jackson's meritorious novel. The
Haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy, and its
seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound
effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into
submission-the film is like a Rube Goldberg contraption rigged to
shout "boo."
Fragile Nell (Taylor), bisexual Theo (Zeta-Jones), and smiley Luke
(Wilson) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed
Hill House for an extended study on sleep disorders, hosted by
Professor  Marrow (Neeson). Marrow's secretly gathering data on their
respective paranoid responses to his recount of Hill House's bleak
history. He's not prepared for the very real apparitions that
terrorize the crew, Nell especially, who has some ancestral connection
to the manor's previous inhabitants.
Taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead. For
starters, her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even
the early scenes, when we're introduced to the mansion and all its
fun-house trappings. Her character is supposed to be depressed, having
tended to an unloving mother for too many years, but Taylor plays Nell
as supernaturally lame, alternately grouchy, mopey, wiggy and
pathetic, and I kept wondering why the other characters didn't just
ditch this bitch.
As for the obscenely photogenic Zeta-Jones, she breezes through her
scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her.
Unfortunately, she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue
the screenplay has to offer. Theo's assessment of the house? "I love
it! Sort of Charles Foster Kane meets The Munsters." Who on Earth
would say that in place of "Citizen Kane meets The Munsters"?
(Furthermore, would you gladly spend a single night in a house
befitting that description?)
Both actresses fare better than Neeson, who looks embarrassed to be a
part of this ensemble (and for good reason), and his character is the
most bland. As Luke puts it, Dr. Marrow pulls the old "academic bait
and switch" on his subjects, but he breaks down and confesses to this
the second he's accused. Later, he risks his life by climbing a
crumbling stairwell to save Nell (it's amusing to hear Neeson shout
"Nell" repeatedly, given his starring role in the 1994 Jodie Foster
vehicle of the same name). Why was this nice, helpful, and redemptive
researcher so absent of ethics at the start?
The Haunting was well designed by Eugenio Zanetti. His sets are
obsessively detailed, and even before the CGI kicks in, they seem
alive, never quite still. I do have one beef with this aspect of the
production: the real life mansion used in exterior shots,
Nottinghamshire's Harlaxton Manor, is so vast that one has trouble
believing that Nell and company, no matter how much running away they
do from ghosts and goblins, always finish up in locations that were
established in act one, as if all the action has been confined to one
wing of Hill House.
Eighty million dollars was spent on The Haunting, and despite a
powerhouse box office debut, I doubt it will recoup its costs
(including marketing) domestically. Thank Jan De Bont for that:
proving for the third time that Speed was a fluke, in that it was
actually enjoyable, De Bont has served up another ride, sans thrill.
His images, well-lit though they are, have an unmistakable been
there-done that quality; in fact, whole sequences, not to mention the
cloaked, airy ghoul who owns the climax, feel lifted from a much
smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers
back, Peter Jackson's The Frighteners. I don't mean to suggest De Bont
is a plagiarist, I mean to suggest that he's a hack, having found no
new ways to give us chills.
