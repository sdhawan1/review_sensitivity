Title
Review for Double Jeopardy (1999)
*1/2 out of four
This is your definitive "Hollywood" movie, extremely predictable, following the
basic formula (a horrible ending), overzealous writing (meaning the writing was
bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting, therefore
making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space) and
if Tommy Lee Jones and his lovable wise-ass character (of which we've seen
before in The Fugitive and quite frankly, wasn't used enough here), I'm afraid
the film would have been completely unbearable.
In this film, Ashley Judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing
her husband while out sailing for a weekend. While in jail she finds out that
her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her. Over money
(how original). While in jail she works out, exercises and basically does her
best to get into near perfect condition. 
Now she has learned about a law titled "double jeopardy" stating that if she
serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law
could not touch her (although there has been talk that this is not the way the
actual law works). Now her PO (Parole Officer), and a bunch of cops are chasing
after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims.
Skipping over to the acting: the fact that Judd is more of a looker than an
actress (no offense, she has been good [Simon Birch] and even very good to
great [Kiss the Girls] at times, in the past  and I believe may have the
potential to be better... but she's terribly unconvincing in this and her
performance seems stale and unsatisfying) doesn't really add to the movie at
all; just takes away. As I'd said, Jones was fine, although he did not have
much to work with. He was much more of a supporting character. Which is fine,
and he handled it well; especially considering the material he had to work
with.
I feel this film had alot going for it. Originality not being an issue. The
acting was the only thing (as I said) keeping it alive. The plot seemed pretty
intriguing and could have been as well if applied better. The action scenes
were well made (however sometimes out of place). I was just left unsatisfied in
the long run.
So basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely
over-thought, the plot has certainly been done before (generally speaking), the
movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the
plot, and is basically a film that was ALMOST saved by Tommy Lee Jones, who if
he had some more screentime, could perhaps have earned the film a higher
rating; in my book, anyway. Keep this in mind, If you're in the mood for a good
action film -- rent The Fugitive.     D+

Title
Review for Three Kings (1999)
* * * * out of four
Yes, you counted those stars right, I just came home from seeing this film and
I have to say it was amazing. Because the acting was very good? Yes. Because
the directing was different and intriguing? Why not. But mostly because it made
a powerful political statement and used it well in the film. 
It was a different film, it had so much to it. I could sit here for a while and
type in how it was hilarious sometimes yet still managed to move me
emotionally, but I'd rather move on to the reasons that made it, in my opinion,
a great movie.
Alot of it was intense, meaningful images and situations. For those of you who
saw it, an example would be when they made Wahlberg drink the oil. Only because
of what it said about our involvement in the war (it will make more sense if
you've seen it). 
Many of the sequences had some nice camerawork, and I've heard it (the
camerawork) compared to that you'd see in an MTV music video and such, but if
that were true it would mean that the camerawork was all wrong for the films
ideas. But it really wasn't. It fit so well 
It wasn't awkward, even considering it was a part in a war film (even though it
took place after the war had ended). It didn't seem at all out of place. It
added to the scene in most cases, sometimes it was just fun to look at (i.e.,
the sky moving fast in the background). 
This film was much more than I'd expected walking in. In many ways it was bold
at what it spoke of. About how we told them to rise up against Sadam Hussein
and that we'd defend them, when in actuality we did not come through. In this
film we don't see massacres, we see single people being slaughtered. We see
horrible things becoming of people and being done to them, sometimes to
characters we've come to know. Alot of the images will stick in my head for
while, and probably will for other viewers of this brilliant film.
Sometimes a film can add in comedy, but this films comedy didn't feel like
comic relief, it felt as if it were a part of the film and in many ways
essential to the characters and plot itself. To sum this up, Three Kings is a
spectacular achievement and this years best film I've seen to date, it includes
alot more depth than the trailers give it credit. I highly recommend this film.
Expect more than the previews offer.     A+

Title
Review for Runaway Bride (1999)
* *1/2 out of five
The Runaway Bride is one of those films that comes along that seems as if it
too very little thought to come up with; and probably did. But somehow you
still like the characters and the story itslef. Also you realize it's fault,
which come in abundance as well. Overall this is a split decision (positive or
negative review in general) and I am going to have to go towards a negative
response.
In this movie Miss Roberts plys a women who seemingly looks at marriage as a
contact sport. She leads those men up to the altar and then throws the final
punch and runs off (hence the title). Once the big-time journalist (for USA
Today) Ike Graham from the "big city" hears about this he writes a demeaning
article for which he is fired. In order to redeem himself and perhaps get his
job back he goes to the small hometown of Maggie Carpenter (Roberts) and
promises to stay for her next wedding and write an article that is completely
truthful. Maybe he'll even clear her name.
In this film, the cast of one of the greatest romantic comedies of the nineties
(Pretty Women), comes back to a project that is also about love and how it
isn't always perfect unless you're perfect for one another. Only this time the
idea is not as fresh and interesting instead dull and easily predictable.
While the characters are easily relatable and we may laugh now and then at a
cute or funny joke thrown in, sometimes those laughs are what I like to refer
to as 'pity laughs'. Although I amhappy to say this film didn't call for all
that many of those.
I will be the first to admit that I am an advid Julia Roberts fan. I even liked
My Best Friends Wedding. And the question that is the most important to be
asked by critics for this film is whether or not, in our opinion, Richard Gere
and Roberts believably fell in love again in The Runaway Bride. Sadly, my reply
is no.
But I cannot hoinestly blame that on the actors, I must shift the blame over to
the writers. Who had a cute idea for this but did not get enough into the two
lead characters and their deep personalities. There were a few scenes when we
do get some information on this but not enough to convince me that these two
characters, both with seperate and different mind sets, were in love with one
another.
To wrap this up instead of rambling on, I just barely give a negative opinion
on this. Because while it is cute and a movie that is great for a young
couple... it leaves you wondering whether it could have been better. Whether it
could have been more than it was. The acting helped the film and some of the
clever punchlines along the way made for a clever experience. Because this
could go either way, see it for yourself.     C

Title
Review for Boiler Room (2000)

Boiler Room, starring Giovanni Ribisi, Tom Everett Scott, Ben Affleck, Vin
Diesel, Nia Long, Nicky Katt, Scott Caan, Ron Rifkin and Jamie Kennedy. Rated R
for language and mild violence. Directed by Ben Younger. 2000.
   Most will agree that Boiler Room is an obvious combination of Wall Street
and Glengarry GlenRoss.  The film even mentions the two on several occasions. 
And while the obvious is that this isn't as equally good as the other two
(especially the latter), it's a awkwardly balanced yet ultimately fun film that
uses some information already used in film before, in a new... unique fashion.
   Giovanni Ribisi (The Other Sister, The Mod Squad) starts off as a young man
living in the slumps, running an illegal casino out of his apartment, who is
given the opportunity to work as a trainee to become a stock broker at a nearly
invisible (yet very succesful) business place. I have seen him in many
different roles, from comedy as Phoebe's "long-lost" brother on "Friends" to a
mentally challenged man in love in The Other Sister. It's interesting to watch
him seemingly challege his abilites, and, with exception, he proves himself to
have much potential as a rising star in Hollywood.
   His performance here is one of the hilights of the film, even as it declines
in entertaining appeal, even as the film strays into an all-too conspiracy
territory that feels very forced. That being said, I'd like to elaborate.
Watching the trailers for Boiler Room, I interpreted it as a comedy.  Perhaps
this is a lone, rush judgment on my part. But regardless, it is much better
described as a thriller with a bundle of comic relief. 
   Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting, DOGMA), who's role in this is commonly
compared to that of Alec Baldwin's in the infamous Glengarry GlenRoss (though
in complexity, there's no likeness), provides a few of the film's highest
points as the rough, 27-year-old veteran of the job. Being a, quote-un-quote,
"senior citizen" in the office. He sprays dialogue and wit about in his few on
screen moments ("Anyone who says money is the root of all evil, doesn't f**king
have it."), his dialogue being the film's best scripted sequences. He utters
his lines as steadily as water flowing from a faucet. Smooth and effective, in
essence.
   In the first portion of the film (action prior to the first major
revelation) is found to contain interesting camera angles edited in an arousing
to the senses sort of way. I'd credit the editors for this facet.  Cutting
extremely fast back and forth between countless objects, though not a new idea,
is used in a fascinating atmosphere around the film's overall tone. Also, the
use of constant rap music adds a certain MTV, pop-culture tone to it, also
creating a more fast-paced and exciting texture.
   Though little can be said for the plot. Little originality here. Though this
doesn't neccesarily hurt the film too much, but it quite obviously it does not
help. Going from comedy to thriller is a steep step and one hard to handle.
Generally speaking.
   When watching the film there will be times where you feel some dialogues are
forced into the scene to attempt to add an impact, at other times you'll be
bored. But for the most part, and at most times, you'll be reasonably
interested in the action at hand and will be enjoying yourself. That's what
this film is. An enjoyable movie going experience. Nothing great. Nothing
classic or memorable. Simply an arguably good time with a cool punchline.

Title
Review for Blue Streak (1999)
* * *1/2 out of four
   I got the chance to catch a sneak preview of this film before it was
released back a few weeks ago, along with The Runaway Bride ?(review already
posted). I'll admit that this film was poorly advertised. The previews made it
look pretty bad, but I am surprised and in many ways glad to say that Blue
Streak was an excellent comedy.
   In this film Lawrence plays a jewel thief, who, during the opening heist,
finds his driver gone and one of his accomplices has turned on him. Then he
must find a place to hide the precious tennis-ball sized jewel he'd just
stolen. He finds a nearby building being constructed across the street and
hides it in the heating duct just as the cops find him. He is then put away for
two years (I believe) only to find out, once he is released, that the building
is now a branch of the LAPD.
   In order to get his jewel he'll, through the help of his "prop-master"
uncle, pass himself off as a cop. But then everything gets out-of-hand, he is
mistaken for the new lead detective and through every illegal and forceful
tactic he uses, gains more respect from his colleagues. 
   Yeah, it may seem typical -- and in many ways it is. The plot has been done
before (in general aspects) but was handled in a fresh and intriguing manner.
Martin Lawrence is by far one of the better comedic actors out there today. His
style is slick, cool and to-the-point. And he's a good actor as well. Not just
comedically. I could honestly see him in the future doing drama... but I would
not suggest it; he's too damn funny for that.
   Blue Streak was a film that was fast-paced, straight to the jokes, and
believe this: Lawrence is clean! Now, if you've seen or are a fan of some of
his earlier projects such as Bad Boys and Nothin' to Lose (both films I'd
highly recommend to you if you want a good laugh that won't make you feel
guilty about it in the end) which had continuous and constant language. Proves
that all Lawrence needs to be funny is his abilities.
   If there is anything to expect in a Martin Lawrence film, it is that it'll
be cool. He's got that quality to his acting. And if there is anything in this
film that can be construed as such, it was the action sequences. Some call them
"out of place," I call 'em fun. Well-made, exciting action. Whether it's
essential or not it certainly adds to the entertainment values involved in the
film and while some of the camerawork was flawed and a tad over-dramatic, in
some cases it worked. Although freeze-frames and frame-by-frame went out a
while back, the method in which it's introduced is both attracting and amusing.
That is a great topic sentence to sum up my overall feelings of the movie,
minorly flawed in a good way.
   Many have compared this film to other good films like Beverly Hills Cop and
the Lethal Weapon series. But not in a pleasant way, they call it a rip-off. My
response to this: Absolutely, and I loved every minute of it!     A-

Title
Review for Scream 3 (2000)

Scream 3, starring Neve Cambell, Courtney Cox Arquette and David Arquette. With
Liev Schreiber and Carrie Fisher. Rated R for violence, gore and profanity.
Directed by Wes Craven. 2000.
   Well, it's been a little adventure... watching the Scream flicks evolve and
generate it's stir over the course of the past five-or-so years.  Overall, as a
moviegoing experience, it was satisfying.  Scream brought back an entire genre,
and to a new generation.  Bringing forth both the good (The Faculty), the bad
(Urban Legend) and the ugly (I Still Know What You Did Last Summer). Along with
some loose ends in between. Though, not one exceeded the influence or even
entertainment value of it's predecessor
   The first was an excellent movie.  It had a dark satirization of the horror
genre that many a moviegoer appreciated very much.  Taking stabs at not only
the over-the-top content, but also some hilarious irony towards pop culture as
two characters discuss their relationship in relation to film ratings; "Could
you settle for a PG-13 relationship?"
   The problem with the second, the one I liked the least, was it seemed to
take itself more seriously than the others.  It was trying too hard and seemed
to get lost and become, as itself, part of the genre which it was formerly
poking fun at.  The ending was less than appealing, and the characters were
extremely flat in most cases.  But, it had it's moments also.
   As for the third (and supposedly final) sequel... aside from it's shockingly
disappointing ending and the fact that they kill off the best actor (not
necessarily character) during the opening, it was fairly better than decent. 
It provided some humor, although more in the form of slapstick, as opposed to
satire.
   Scream 3 is flawed, very much so. But, generally, an ending in a film of
this type can literally make or break the film.  And in this case, while not
breaking fully in half, it fractures in nonetheless. And I'm still in awe at
how completely gutless and amateurish the ending was.  Everything is wrapped up
in a "neat little package" and everyone (who's still alive) lives oh so happily
ever after.  C'mon, dare to be interesting. Ehren Kruger, who also wrote
Arlington Road (for which he won the prestigious Nicholl Screenwriting
fellowship award for acheivment in screenwriting) and the soon-coming Reindeer
Games with Ben Affleck and Gary Sinise, writes, and while Williamson, the
original writer of the first two, is no brilliant mind, we loose the series'
style (even knowing I disliked the second).
   Kevin Williamson's scripts seem like they were written on a plane trip from
Hollywood to Los Angeles, but they are always engrossing.  A good waste of
time, in most cases.  Though, to my surprise, Williamson supposedly nominated
Kruger for the job, and while he won praise and did win a very prestigious
award for achievements in screenwriting for Road, I feel, well, disappointed at
the simplicity of the picture,
   As for Williamson's works, The Faculty is merely a reminiscent of a typical
50's drive-in horror flick, Teaching Mrs. Tingle was pretty enjoyable even
though definitively "campy," and the Scream series has a heavy cult following
now.  He can write a good reminiscent of a certain genre.  I'm pretty sure he
could have improved the ending.  Even if as a cheap surprise ending (i.e.: I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer).
   Scream 3, at times, does break back into the satire of the original.  Not
too often does it, but when it does, it does so well.  Direct comedy towards
trilogies, stereotypes-of, etc., though not as impressively as it had in the
original.
   In general, I'd recommend it.  For a good time.  If you're going there for
any other reason you'll be disappointed.  Very typical and nothing
extraordinarily new or groundbreaking appears.  Rather predictable and
tolerably cheesy, as well as consisting of some seemingly forced performances. 
But I'd rather see this over the second any day. It's worth the money,
regardless of the flaws (which come plentiful). My advice: wait for video, get
all three and stay up 'til three in the morning watching them.
