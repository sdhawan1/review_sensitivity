Review for Faithful (1996)
'TILL DEATH DO US PART' COMEDY MISSES ITS MARK
There's something extremely unsatisfying about a movie that keeps its
fingers on your pulse, but fails to push the right buttons. And FAITHFUL is
a one of those movies that has its moments, but never quite takes off as a
whole.
Actor Chazz Palminteri's comic thriller is an inspired tale of a wife who
discovers that her husband has hired a hitman to dispose of her on their
twentieth wedding anniversary. From its tantaliser of an opening, FAITHFUL
throws up witty one-liners, sexual tension between repressed housewife
Margaret and broodingly neurotic gunman Tony, as well as a potentially
compelling debate on whether it's possible to remain faithful to the same
person all your life.
For example, Margaret asks Tony, in the desperate curiosity of one about to
die, whether he's ever slept with a whore. He replies, haughtily, "I only
sleep with whores."
The key to Palminteri's script is the dialogue between Margaret and Tony,
which deftly juggles that fine line between irreverent and seriousness. And
director Paul Mazursky (ENEMIES, A LOVE STORY) gives the dialogue
considerable attention, producing some classy moments. Cher turns in an
excellent performance as Margaret, bringing to it inimitable comic timing
and an unexpected poignance. Palminteri reprises his familiar hitman role,
though with less panache than as the memorable Cheech in BULLETS OVER
BROADWAY. And both play up the sexual tension to the hilt.
But the movie tries to be a bit too clever. The numerous flashbacks and
cuts to Margaret's husband Jack are distracting and often ineffectual; Ryan
O'Neal does nothing for the role of Jack with his wooden, humourless mug,
and the flashbacks only serve to draw us away from the immediacy of the
Margaret-Tony interplay.  Worse of the lot are the cheesy slow-mo shots of
Jack's mistress sashaying about.
The biggest culprit of the 'trying-too-hard' syndrome is the movie's
attempt to moralize, it's insistence on Making A Point. Like the
wide-angled shots of Jack and Margaret's opulent mansion; read: money can't
buy happiness. Or the constant rehashing of the 'faithfulness' theme--why
can't men be faithful, why women shouldn't bother to be faithful--which
gets to be about as annoying as a fly buzzing about your head.
Like the intense, tough-talking Tony who can't bring himself to pull a
trigger on any woman, FAITHFUL has a lot behind it, but manages to shoot
itself in the foot. Which is why, despite its potential, despite actors the
calibre of Cher and Palminteri, FAITHFUL won't win any critical acclaim. A
pity.
Clarissa Oon has no qualms about being faithful--to her dog.

Review for Denise Calls Up (1995)
Ever feel you're spending your whole life on the Net (ouch!), eating,
breathing and excreting web sites ? That your most meaningful
relationships are being formed on the Net? That you get your best sex
on the Net ?
If first-time director Hal Salwen could shoot an entire movie of
characters typing at their computers, he would. As it is, he settles
for characters talking on the phone. DENISE CALLS UP is a movie for
and about the electronic generation, where characters are too caught
up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their
relationships and fantasies on the phone. It's a satire - and a
sometimes funny one - about how we let handphones, call-waiting and
answering machines run our lives.
The problem: DENISE CALLS UP is a movie about an idea. A darn good
one, but still an 80 minute-long idea. And despite Salwen's attempt at
plots and sub-plots, despite some genuinely funny moments, you can
predict the movie's outcome within the first fifteen minutes. You get
the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the
phone why they all couldn't make it for a party - nobody is going to
be meeting anybody in this film, they would rather be talking on the
phone.
Here's Salwen's plot: while all the characters are in a dysfunctional,
telefixated limbo, loud quirky stranger Denise calls up Martin to
announce that she is pregnant with his child, courtesy of the sperm he
donated to the local bank. As Martin progresses from slamming the
phone on her to long phone conversations over the baby's name, his
friends - and his friends' friends - get involved, courtesy of
call-waiting and double-lines.
In the tigher and more tantalizing sub-plot, Barbara and Jerry are set
up on a blind date that neither turns up for. Both profess to have too
complicated schedules to ever meet, but they get it going over the
phone. With repeated phone sex comes a glitch; what if the other
person is simply faking it?
DENISE CALLS UP scores with some inspired moments. Mousy Barbara
metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless, everyone shares the
excitement of Denise's delivery through a conference call to her
handphone, and Barbara's best friend Gale is killed in a car accident
while taling animatedly into another friend's answering machine. (As
Gale's overly-chatty aunt recounts, her cordless was knicked into her
ear and lodged in her brain.)
But these moments are not enough to sustain the movie. The pace sags,
the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the
telephone-touters. And the ending is literally a non-event as
expected, everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party Frank
throws in Gale's memory despite promising over the phone that they
will. We get the point.
The movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly-'90s statement
until they have it coming out of your ears. Pun intended. There's even
a on the movie's web site where you can win cellular phones (as if we
haven't had enough of these things already). Watch the movie only if
you find it philosophy compelling enough for a earful.
THE FLYING INKPOT's rating system:
* Wait for the video.
** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
*** Pretty good, bring a friend.
**** Amazing, potent stuff.
***** Perfection. See it twice.
