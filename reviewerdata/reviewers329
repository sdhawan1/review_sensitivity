Review for U-571 (2000)
U-571 is a submarine war movie in almost all senses, but I couldn't help 
thinking of it as a warped science fiction movie. Space movie elements most 
have seen before are abundant here. The crew who sometimes doesn't get along, 
the ship/submarine that's not suited for flying/moving through water and 
needs repairs, the captain shouting off random commands to crew members that 
the audience doesn't understand, etc. During one point near the middle, 
Matthew McConaughey even says, "Make it so" a famous line often uttered by 
Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) in recent Star Trek movies and the Star 
Trek: The Next Generation television series. My mind drifted away with 
thoughts like these for the entire movie, yet it was easy to keep up with the 
events happening onscreen. U-571 takes some simple plot concepts and milks 
them for all they are worth. At times this makes for an entertaining action 
film thatâs easy to follow. At other times it's downright cheesy.
An American group of submariners led by Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew 
McConaughey) sneak onto a German submarine hoping to capture the Enigma 
cipher machine that would enable the American army to understand coded German 
radio communications. The group kills most of the crew inside and beats the 
ship up pretty bad, but soon their own ship gets blown up. This forces the 
American crew of nine to stay on the enemy submarine and pose as Germans when 
a German re-supply sub comes to help them. The crew, which includes Chief 
Klough (Harvey Keitel) and Tank (Dave Power), must work together to evade 
German ships in hostile waters. 
There is a lot to like about this movie. Some action sequences are 
spectacular. One particular scene where water explodes out of the ocean in a 
perfectly timed pattern is nothing short of amazing. The sound is also 
astounding. Remarkable care to the sound effects for this movie make it an 
easy contender for Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing at the Oscars. 
The sound really tests the theaterâs speaker system. Walking out of the 
movie, I became very surprised. I could still hear! Another nice thing about 
this movie is that the German characters actually speak in German. Instead of 
conversing in English with German accents, there are subtitles as they talk 
on the screen. These people are actually speaking in their native language. 
This is quite a surprise in a mainstream Hollywood action production.
The problem with U-571 is that it lacks appeal. The lead characters 
(McConaughey, Keitel, Paxton, and more) are always grimy, their faces soaked 
with sweat. I don't need to see Harvey Keitel or Bill Paxton with combed over 
hair ever again. It's hard to look at Matthew McConaughey and not see him 
naked playing bongo drums. The crew (which also features the Chris Rock of 
the 1940s) isn't very likable, and there was no chance to pick a favorite or 
choose someone to root for. U-571 is also under the crosshairs regarding its 
accuracy. In reality, the British actually captured the Enigma machine and 
many small details (mostly regarding the operation of a submarine) get 
overlooked. Some WWII veterans have said it's the, "Funniest movie they've 
ever seen." The ending of the movie made me groan with displeasure. It was 
just too unbelievable.
U-571 can't decide whether it wants to be Saving Private Ryan or Titanic, and 
it fails at both. Too many elements were implausible, and some good action 
doesn't make up for the actors and plotline. This submarine sinks without a 
doubt.

Review for Pretty Woman (1990)
Prompted by the recent Runaway Bride, (a diaster all it's own) I decided to
rent Pretty Woman to see what got this tepid film made. It all flashed before
my eyes, it was the world's first glimpse into the world of cutesy Julia
movies. A fun, inventive romantic comedy that starts and ends just like it
should.
Edward Lewis (Gere) buys companies, takes them apart, and sells them bit by
bit. He meets Vivian (Roberts) on Hollywood Way when he asks her for directions
to Beverly Hills. Asking her what her name is, she says "What do you want it to
be?" Needing to take a load off, he hires her for the night. Taking a liking to
her, he then hires her for a whole week.
But he needs to clean Vivian up. Buying her dresses and having her learn table
manners to attend various dinners so she can appear as his date soon becomes
his prime concern. He begins to fall in love with her, but it takes awhile for
her to return his affections. Vivian also helps him see through buying another
family owned company by bringing out the more emotional side of him.
Pretty Woman is extremely cute. Cute is the only world for it. I also liked the
fact that prostitutes are portrayed as people that need help (much in the same
way that African-American gangsters were showcased in Slam.) The film turns in
fine performances by it's two leads, but also from Hector Elizondo as the hotel
manager, and Laura San Giacomo as Julia's prostituting pal. Despite minor
cliches and problems, the fun romantic comedy Pretty Woman still gets ***
stars.
The Young-Uns: The title character is a prostitute and there is some sexual
discussion as well as bad attitudes towards her. There is also some mild
language. Good Age: 12 & Up

Review for Me, Myself & Irene (2000)
rated R
116 minutes
20th Century Fox
starring Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger, Chris Cooper, and Robert Forster
written by Mike Cerrone, Bobby Farrelly, and Peter Farrelly
directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly
Perfect casting has never been a problem for Jim Carrey. Who else could have 
made The Mask believable and fun? What type of person would Truman Burbank 
have been without him? He has approached all of his latest roles with energy, 
and there is no exception here. Whatever material the Farrelly brothers hand 
him, whether itâ^Ŕ^Ůs golden laugh-out-loud comedy or gross-out trash, he 
delivers it with vigor. Perhaps he is a little too full of energy for his 
own, and this movie's good. This is the role Carrey seemed born to play and 
he fits it perfectly. He is so good itâ^Ŕ^Ůs scary. The script, however, is 
frightening for other reasons. 
Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey) is a peaceable Rhode Island state trooper 
that's constantly taken advantage of by everyone around him. His wife sleeps 
with an African American midget on their wedding day, and later produces 
three large, black genius sons. He doesnâ^Ŕ^Ůt seem to care the whole town is 
laughing at him behind his back. After a day of unusually tough verbal abuse, 
Charlie cracks revealing Hank. Hank is the complete opposite of Charlie. Hank 
likes to fight, is less than a gentleman to women, and wreaks havoc wherever 
he goes. Doctors determine that Charlie has schizophrenia, and give him 
medication to control the problem. Irene (Renee Zellweger), a golf course 
manager, is a young woman that gets sent to jail unawares of her boyfriendâ^Ŕ^Ůs 
illegal conduct he has involved her in. Charlie must escort her to a New York 
jail. Before leaving, Charlie forgets to grab his medication. As both of his 
personalities begin to fall for Irene, Charlie must win the battle between 
Hank and himself before he loses Irene for good.
The Farrelly brothers are famous for their work on Dumb and Dumber and 
Thereâ^Ŕ^Ůs Something About Mary. In interviews they have tried to evaporate 
their title of the gross-out kings of comedy by saying things like, â^Ŕ^ÜWhat is 
gross? We do everything only to be funny.â^Ŕ^Ý Not to be too graphic, but I do 
not find a thirty second shot of a chicken shoved up a manâ^Ŕ^Ůs behind at all 
humorous. This type of shocking humor is copious. As the film continues, it 
becomes so abundant that it just isn't funny anymore. An early scene 
involving a cow that just will not die will have animal activists screaming, 
and will have everyone else screaming with laughter. Charlieâ^Ŕ^Ůs three black 
sons (flawlessly performed by Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, and Jerod 
Mixon) are the only things regularly funny in this movie. The rest crosses 
the line of good taste too often. The Farrelly brothers have the wrong 
approach to making people laugh. When they did the hair-raising hair gel 
scene in Mary, it was outrageous because it came out of nowhere. With this 
movie, we expect the gross humor. Therefore, it isnâ^Ŕ^Ůt nearly as hilarious or 
shocking when performed. 
The romance fails too. Perhaps the offscreen chemistry between Carrey and 
Zellweger is good, but their onscreen work is horrible. Irene doesnâ^Ŕ^Ůt match 
the Charlie/Hank character, and the screenplay robs Zellweger of any comic 
opportunities. She tries to be her usual exuberant and shining female 
character, but the script works against her. Supporting performances from 
Robert Forster and American Beautyâ^Ŕ^Ůs Chris Cooper do nothing to help the 
film. Me, Myself & Irene is about a half hour too long for all of the above 
reasons. The romance moves along at an unhurried pace, while the comedy wants 
to move faster.
Even if the Farrellyâ^Ŕ^Ůs borrow much from their two previous films, they do one 
thing here that is genuinely interesting and original. Stay for the credits, 
and youâ^Ŕ^Ůll see the name of every single extra that worked on the film, as 
well as a picture of the place they appeared in the movie. This is certainly 
an intriguing concept, one that is far more interesting than this shocking, 
yet bland movie.

Review for Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961)
Ah, Audrey Hepburn, one of the cinema's greatest stars, she's never been
shining brighter than here. Holly Golighty (Hepburn) is an eccentric woman who
lives in an apartment building where she annoys Mr. Yunioshi (Mickey Rooney) by
pushing his buzzer when she loses her key. 
Moving in upstairs is Paul Varjak (Peppard) whom Holly instantly begins to call
Fred (as he looks somewhat like her beloved brother.) Paul is not sweet and
innocent, he's having an affair with 2-E (Patricia Neal) and wants to end it
because he's falling in love.
Every great romantic moment after 1961 in the movies had to take at least one
or two things from Breakfast at Tiffany's. Whether it be modern classics like
Notting Hill and My Best Friend's Wedding or older hits. But the movie oozes so
much cuteness (almost as if you were walking into a Sanrio store) that there's
no way you can resist it. Now I always like to make my reviews for the classics
short enough so that no one gets mad at me and says, "Why did you diss my
favorite movie of all time? What is wrong with you?" I simply can't go on
enough on how much I loved this movie, it's a fun romantic classic. Go to an
older video store, go and rent it now.
ADDITIONAL NOTE: Go, go to Suncoast and buy it now.

Title
Review for Charlie Chan at the Circus (1936)
Two or three times a year, all of the good people at AMC decide to dig through
the film's of the 1930s and have a Charlie Chan film festival. On my first
viewing of a Chan film (I believe that there are 38 total) I instantly fell in
love with the interesting characters, fun plotlines, and mysterious mysteries.
For all readers who don't know, Charlie Chan was a Chinese detective who
starred in several extremely popular films from the late 1920s to the mid
1940s. The actor who played him (there were two of them Warner Oland from
Sweden and Sidney Toler from Missouri) was never Chinese. Charlie Chan would
always be involved with, investigate, and solve a murder in just over an hour.
These are exciting films and I hope you enjoy my review of this one.
Charlie Chan (Oland) the famous Chinese detective is at the circus with his
large (16 children to be exact) family. Before the show, they meet the amazing
Tiny (Olive Brasno) and Tim (George Brasno) they are both the littlest people
on earth. During the show, one of the two men they run it is killed in the
wagon that holds most of the production's money. Charlie doesn't want to
investigate at first, but are convinced that they need their help after Tiny
and Tim beg for it. Their first assumption is that they believe it is an
escaped ape, who someone let out of it's cage, but as the pieces come together,
Charlie begins to think that something else actually happened to the man.
The film is classic Chan, it follows all of the main plot points of all the
rest of the Charlie Chan movies. Charlie does however come up with more
interesting similees (Mind like parachute - only function when open) than
usual. I really like Keye Luke as the number one son. Even if he is annoying,
you can't help but liking him as he goes along trying to be just like his
famous father. But this movie doesn't have the same level of charm as some of
the other pictures. I also don't think that the circus was a good place to have
it be set, as nothing really seems to happen that is that much circus related.
It's not as exciting as some of the others films and this film is also very
talky. But no one can refuse a 70 minute movie like this, it's fun and
entertaining, and it gets ** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: Besides the fact that someone is murdered and that there is a
scary gorilla, there is nothing that would frighten young children in the film.
Good Age 6 & Up

Title
Review for Haunting, The (1999)
The 1963 thriller The Haunting (based on the book by Shirley Jackson) was a
psychological thriller that creeped deep within the crevices of the human
brain, exploring mental terror and ghostly happenings, seeing the film remade
is frightening. No, it's not because of the movie, but the fact that all of
that is lost.
Doctor David Marrow (Liam Neeson) has gathered three insomniacs in the creepy
Hill House, where no one lives closer than town. So no one will be able to help
them, at night, in the dark (or so tells Mrs. Dudley, the housekeeper.) What he
tells them is a study to help them is actually his own five year study into
fear. For what reason he does this, it's uncertain, but it's a pretty flimsy
premise that doesn't work very well.
Theo, (Zeta-Jones) Eleanor, (Taylor) and Luke (Owen Wilson) are the lucky
patients. Eleanor begins receiving frightening visions, someone writes 'WELCOME
HOME ELEANOR' on a wall in blood, she begins seeing bloody footprints, and
spies a body hanging from the greenhouse rafters. At first the group believes
that she is in this for the attention, but they soon find that it is something
completely different.
The film is sort of an anti-Blair Witch, the first three fourths of the film
don't show what is after the people in the house, and it's a great effect.
Almost as great as the special effects which could have dominated the film, but
remain suprisingly restrained until the end. Of course, the good old computer
animators had to spoil everything and show us who the villain is, what he looks
like, his hair color, hobbies, etc. It is kind of fun to see the plot unfold,
but it becomes predictable very quickly.
While the film has some good moments (including an excellent performance from
Taylor, who was a good choice, even if most of the audience has probably never
heard of her) the film still remains incredibly flawed. Flashy special effects
and a good cast can't really help The Haunting (especially for those that saw
the original) and for that I give it ** 1/2 stars.

Title
Review for Mystery Men (1999)
Mystery Men was supposed to be one of the biggest box office draws of the
summer. It had a hip cast, (get this cast list: Hank Azaria, Janeane Garofalo,
William H. Macy, Kel Mitchell, Paul Reubens, Ben Stiller, Wes Studi, Greg
Kinnear, Lena Olin, Geoffrey Rush, Tom Waits, Eddie Izzard, and Pras just to
name a few) an interesting premise, and great special effects, but somewhere in
the midst, someone had forgotten about the script.
Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) is losing his superhero pop deal with Pepsi,
he's almost wiped out all of the crime in the city and is losing publicity
fast. What he needs is one of his old evil villains to battle with, the only
one still alive is Cassanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) and he releases him
immediately. But Cassanova is smart, and soon captures Amazing and holds him in
his mansion of evil.
Enter Mr. Furious, (Stiller) the Shoveler, (H. Macy) and the Blue Raja, (Hank
Azaria) they are your b-movie type superheros. They go around each night and
try to protect the citizens of Champion City from extreme evil. When their idol
Captain Amazing is captured, they soon make it their quest to rescue him before
the entire city is blown to a pulp. They hold superhero auditions for more
people to join their gang and go to an old carnival where a man sells lots of
weird weapons.
That's exactly what Mystery Men is, the film has some extremely inventive
situations but smothers them in stupid, unfunny dialog. The performances are
surprisingly mediocre with only Rush and Garofolo standing out from the crowd.
It's also full of characters that we are supposed to find amusing that come off
more annoying than funny. Universal put $68 million into the picture, and so
far it's only made about $25 million, and it's probably not going to make $35
million either. While well cast, Mystery Men can't make the cut, so it gets
**1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains a scene of someone's eyeballs and face being
disoriented and burning (it's not that bad) it also contains some gross humor
and language. Good Age: 9 & Up

Title
Review for Detroit Rock City (1999)
In the wake of the Columbine shootings, there have been many discussions on the
effects that movies have on our young society. The ratings system is obviously
not well kept, allowing films like American Pie, South Park: Bigger Longer and
Uncut, and Eyes Wide Shut to pass with R ratings.  Our television is also
becoming more and more violence dominated, with shows like Pyromaniacs Caught
on Tape and Buxom Blondes and Their Hotels airing on network television
nightly. Alternative and hard rock bands are ranking high on the charts
replacing all of the regular sugar choked pop that normally reigns supreme. But
what about one of the most outrageous bands of all time? KISS, (Gene Simmons
serves as head producer) tries to resurrect their career in this movie by
trying to bring out a state of teenage rebellion, but let's get back to the
young society subject.
Some politicians are damning every group possible (the gay community,
Hollywood, Oliver Stone) for destroying family values, they want a better
movie, TV, and music rating system, some are even suggesting that concerts be
rated. There is one simple answer to all of these issues, not exploiting any
person on the face of the planet to this film. This should indeed be labeled
with a fair warning of the idiotic badness (OK, bad and boring word, I admit
it) for all the crude humor and the lessons in everything but the ways to run a
family.
Four members of the band Mystery are hanging out in their pad in the seventies
and are getting high and playing some good old- fashioned rock and roll. They
are all devoted to KISS, they punish anyone who likes disco, and escape the
high school security guard on a regular basis. When one of their mothers
discovers her son Sam is listening to the devil, ("Don't you know what KISS
stands for?" she asks, "Knights In Satan's Service.") She is even more shocked
to find tickets to see the devil in the flesh and torches her son's tickets in
an instant. 
But not all hope is lost, one of the boys wins front row tickets in a local
call in radio station and they decide to break into St. Bernard's boarding
school where Sam in being held and go to the KISS concert. On their way they
lose their tickets again and the film follows each of their adventures while
trying to score the passes. 
If I'm correct, they are hundreds and hundreds of people that help contribute
and see over a film. The around $8 million budget didn't make any of those
hundreds of people make a better film. This is a horrible piece of trash is
only occasionally funny because of the amount of risks that it's willing to
take for a laugh. In fact, Edward Furlong is so devoted to KISS, he decides to
try and win a male stripping contest and ends up throwing up an entire pitcher
of alcohol. The more the film pushes the envelope, the more I found the film
belonging to the catergory of "Never After Columbine." But it was released
afterwards, luckily to a small audience that does not have to undergo the pain
and anguish that I experienced. Since this review is nice and cheery, and says
great things about the movie, I'm sure that you'll want to see it, Detroit Rock
City gets * 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains very strong language, constant drug and
alcohol use, horrible attitudes, violence, lots of sex scenes, and brief
nudity. Good Age: 16 & Up

Review for Sous le sable (2000)
Damn those trailers. Had it not been for the advertising of this film, which
reveals far too much about its contents, I would have been glued to `Under the
Sand'. As it is, the film retains some value, thanks to an excellent performance
by Charlotte Rampling, and a more mature Francois Ozon in the director's
chair.
Marie (Charlotte Rampling) and her husband Jean (Bruno Cremer) lounge on the
beach. She takes a nap while he goes for a swim. When Marie wakes up, Jean is
nowhere to be found. She contacts authorities, but they can't find him either.
Did he disappear to start a new life? Was he killed by accident? Did he commit
suicide? Marie still asks herself these questions a year later, and in order to
move on with her life, she must find some answers. 
It's a fine premise, and this little movie uses it to the limit. The film moves
at a leisurely pace, a bit slow, but relaxing. It's a very visual story, and you
can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles. This is mostly
thanks to the excellent camera work by Antoine Heberle and Jeanne Lapoirie, who
shot the film in a dreamy haze, and the lead performance by Rampling.
Rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of Marie, you connect with her
character instantly, despite that she's delusional. The scenes where she
interacts with her husband, who she still believes is alive, are heartbreaking.
She can't quite get over him. They've been married for twenty-five years. The
other actors, particularly Jacques Nolot, are excellent too.
The sex in the film is rather unneeded, but compared to Ozon's `Criminal
Lovers', it's the Disney Channel. 
Likely to cause some discussion afterwards, `Under the Sand' is a fine movie
going experience. While it's hard to recommend as entertainment, it's a fine
adult alternative about how we deal with loss. Ozon seems to ask what you would
do, and that's certainly a hard question to answer.

Review for Topsy-Turvy (1999)
A well made period piece is often a tough sell for audiences. Most of these
films are highly dramatic and offer little in the areas of excitement or humor.
Mike Leigh's new film Topsy-Turvy which explores Gilbert and Sullivan in a
career slump breaks all of those rules. Blending a mix of colorful sets, great
music, genuinely funny scenes and dialog, and wonderful performances, this
movie keeps you interested for it's entire 160 minute length.
Famed playwright composer duo Gilbert (Broadbent) and Sullivan (Corduner) have
just opened their latest production, Princess Ida, at the Savoy theater in
England. The audience immediately proclaims it another hit, but the newspaper
theater critic says otherwise. This critic says he sees no progress in artistic
development coming from them, and says he cannot recommend the play. Sullivan
feels the same way, he's tired of using the same music again and again and
wants to write a grand opera, one so fantastic it will blow people away. 
But there are concerns as to their future. The contract with the Savoy says
that they must produce a new play when asked, and while Gilbert has one already
written, Sullivan refuses to compose for he believes it's a rehash of what's
been done before. Gilbert is hard set in a writer's block and doesn't know what
to do. All of this changes when Gilbert is dragged by his wife to a local
Japanese exhibition. He is appalled and intrigued at the same time about the
native way of life there. This inspires him to write a grand play, The Mikado,
a play sure to woo Sullivan back and draw large audiences. But at what price
will it take to get the play onstage?
Another wonderful film that shows the lives of the actor. Offering much more
behind the scenes process than All About My Mother did, it really gives us an
idea of how much work went into these plays. The script was written with these
scenes in mind, and original musical composer Carl Davis (Sullivan himself is
also credited) adds some enchanting music to go along with them. This gives the
film an upbeat pace, despite many of it's sad undertones. The star of the film
has to be the woman (who's name escapes me) who researched the time period for
the film. There are many great touches that really give us a feel for the era,
including a very humorous scene in which Gilbert uses a telephone, which were
just being introduced in their time. Leigh does a wonderful job of shifting the
focus throughout the movie. For the first hour we are drawn into Sullivan's
problems and by the 100 minute mark, we have nicely switched over to Gilbert's
troubles. Other examples of this include the plights of various Savoy players
who've been in all the plays the two created. Much of the humor is bittersweet,
and really keeps this thing chugging along. While the length is an issue for
some, so many of the scenes are carefully selected that you never get bored
with redundant information. The only scene I thought was unneeded was an early
scene where Sullivan watches two bare breasted women perform some type of
mini-musical. If this scene had been removed, it easily could have achieved a
PG-13 rating. And you haven't seen anything until you see Gilbert pretending to
be a Japanese Samurai warrior.
All of the actors (and actors playing actors) really bring their characters to
life. Towards the end, I found myself forgetting that this was a movie, that
while fact based, was not entirely true. I felt like I was there, watching the
entire thing happen. Another great film to add to Mike Leigh's filmography, and
another great film that might change the way period pieces are made. This is
fun, energetic, and at times exciting, bravo Gilbert and Sullivan, I give you a
standing ovation.

Title
Review for Deep Blue Sea (1999)
Hot on the heels of Lake Placid, which was more of a campy horror comedy than
deadly animal horror movie, Deep Blue Sea comes to sweep us away with yet
another gory creature feature.
Dr. Susan McAlester (Burrows) is a scientist whose father died of Alzheimer's,
she is very close to discovering the cure from inside a shark's brain. She
works at the huge Aquatica, an above and underground research lab that houses
three testing sharks. One day when Carter (Thomas Jane) is out feeding the
sharp-toothed animals they try to hunt him down, but swim backwards when they
can't. This is met with shocking discovery as sharks can't swim backwards, the
only way they could is if something slipped them something, but of course,
that's against company policy.
A storm blows out all communications on the island and the group (along with
Samuel L. Jackson) is caught inside the ship. Susan is up to foul play by
giving the sharks more protein than they need, thus making them smarter. The
sharks begin to chase and chomp everyone around, and it's an exciting rush. 
LL Cool J appears as a cook, he's quite good and he steals most of the scenes
he's in. It proves that there could be room for him in Hollywood as an actor.
Finally there is someone in one of these movies that never gives up, and comes
up with creative ways of getting away from the bad guy. Burrows also makes a
good female lead and this should get her more star attention. Since there are
no big actors, the film is more suspenseful than the standard horror/sci-fi
flick, whereas in other movies ("OK, everyone except Jamie Lee Curtis or
Sigourney Weaver get killed, etc.) where it's predictable who will live and who
will die, it's all a mystery here.
People that liked Lake Placid that come to this one expecting the same laughs
won't get what they are looking for. On the other hand, those expecting Lake
Placid to be scary will find what they were looking for here.
In other words, if you want a thriller that doesn't require a lot of thinking,
go see Deep Blue Sea, it gets my ** 1/2 stars of choice.

Title
Review for Summer Catch (2001)
One thing's for sure, `Summer Catch' sucks. It takes the cake as the worst
Freddie Prinze Jr. movie, remarkably taking the title from the horrendous `Down
to You'. But the fun you'll have mocking this movie, if you decide to spend
ill-fated money on it, is almost worth a matinee. Everyone is pretty much at
fault for the failure of this film, but the script in particular is just
shockingly awful. 
Ryan (Prinze Jr.) is a pitcher for the Cape Cod team of a prestigious New
England baseball league. Ryan is a hopeful local boy, and is under pressure to
impress the big league scouts at the games. His family is less than supportive
of him, he makes some rather interesting friends, and he has quite the short
temper.
But it wouldn't be a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie without a love interest. So in
comes Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel), the daughter of a very rich family in town
for the summer. Ryan mows their grass, and the two are instantly attracted to
one another when they meet. Her father (Bruce Davison), disapproves of Ryan.
Together, they may just make it through the summer, and prove everyone wrong. 
That's got to sound just a tad familiar to someone. It's amazing that this film
was ever greenlit at all. Prize's star wattage was what probably closed the
deal. I still cling to the hope that someday Freddie will start taking projects
like `The House of Yes' again, but with the role of Fred in 2002's `Scooby-Doo'
coming up, it doesn't seem likely. Why Prinze doesn't mind being typecast
continually in these teen romantic comedies, no one knows. 
`Summer Catch' has a problem with not being very interesting. The script focuses
too much on the romance element, and overlooks the character development and
exciting baseball opportunities of the script. Some of the characters, like
Ryan's dad (Fred Ward), and a rival pitcher, are just so blatantly and
stereotypically evil you can't help but laugh. The baseball scenes are sleep
inducing, and don't even have the schmaltzy quality of an underdog Disney sports
movie. 
Prinze works with what he's given, but Biel is dreadful as a lead. She, however,
is also given the worst dialogue of the film. Still, her character changes
personalities about five times just to make the audience laugh. When she utters
the line, `Let's be together!' near the end of the film, I was in tears of
laughter. 
And so was the rest of the audience. At about the halfway point, where it was
most obvious things weren't getting any better, the laughter started. By the
climax, most of the packed house was about to lose it. It's so easy to snicker
at the film, that it becomes a sort of grand event. An interactive movie going
experience like no other. Releasing this movie must embarrass Warner Bros. 
Although I would never recommend paying money for this film, if you sneak in for
a double feature after seeing another movie, or have someone else pay for your
ticket, you'll be delighted by the sheer stupidity and utter lack of quality
that is `Summer Catch'. It's a summer movie that should disappear faster than a
well-thrown fastball.

Review for Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)
Gone in 60 Seconds is the ultimate guilty pleasure of the summer. It starts 
off as a promising action film, full of genuine suspense and excitement. As 
the movie progresses, it gets increasingly stupid to the point where it's so 
bad and inane that it's good. Throughout the film, the same phony human 
emotion becomes adopted by all the actors, but it's the emotions and 
relationships that keep the film interesting. No character goes beyond wading 
pool level in depth, and that's a very good thing. Director Dominic Sena 
realizes this is an action movie, and he doesn't disappoint. Instead of 
trying to reinvent the genre or use slow motion until it just becomes silly 
(Mission: Impossible 2 anyone?) he takes the best stuff from things we've 
seen before, and makes it into a fun, exciting, and pleasing film.
Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) is a retired car thief whose younger brother 
Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) attempts to follow in his footsteps. Kip screws up his 
first car heist leading the police right to him and his boss. His boss, an 
evil guy with an English accent, wants Memphis to steal fifty specific cars 
from the Long Beach area in three days. If all the cars don't get delivered 
in time, he will kill Kip. So Memphis and a bunch of his old (now mostly 
clean) car thief buddies work together planning the operation. Some of his 
friends include former girlfriend Sway (Angelina Jolie), and an auto mechanic 
named Otto (Robert Duvall). Kip and his younger friends also join the crew. 
Detective Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) is about the same age as Memphis, 
and is eager to put him behind bars. Not putting him in jail already is 
something he regrets. Castlebeck and his younger partner Detective Drycoff 
(Timothy Olyphant) pursue Memphis and the gang for most of the film.
One constant element of humor in this movie is the clash between the older 
and younger generations. Memphis and Otto are more cautious about their 
actions and easily spot undercover cops. Unlike some of Kip's pals (including 
Tumbler played by Scott Caan) they are always aware of their surroundings. 
The older guys certainly donât discuss the latest masturbation techniques, or 
steal cars full of heroin. Memphis comes up with inventive ways to evade 
police and gangs, while the youths prefer confrontation. However, one 
hilarious scene does involves one of the older men attacking a bad car 
hijacker claiming he needs to get a role model. If this doesn't sound like 
your type of humor, this movie isn't for you. This movie will please action 
fans, but I think lots of other less action-oriented people may get 
surprised. I certainly was, and apparently the crowd was too. They were 
hooting and hollering and clapped loudly several times. I admire that 
Angelina Jolie doesn't get used as just a sex object in the film. Sway just 
likes hanging with the guys, and not once does she sleep with anyone. While 
the sexual aspect of her character is definitely there, she doesn't appear in 
much of the movie anyway. Nicolas Cage's nasal tone has never been more 
appealing, and I like the range shown by Giovanni Ribisi in this movie.
The action scenes are at the heart of this movie. The mood gets well set; 
everything is dark and grainy. The only constant source of light for the 
characters comes from fiery explosions, car headlights, or police lights. 
There is one skill everyone in the movie possesses; these people can drive. 
During one amazing car chase, Memphis does a spectacular job of navigating 
himself through the streets. The fast pace never stops, and I thought this 
scene to be the highlight of the film. The cast assembled includes some great 
actors who throw almost all their skills away for good old-fashioned movie 
fun. There really don't need to be as many characters as there were. Frances 
Fisher shows up for some reason in the beginning and end, and there were some 
scenes (like giving a dog laxatives so he would "release" the keys he 
swallowed) that don't need to be there.  Regardless, this is still an 
entertaining time. Some Mission: Impossible and James Bond music pops up, and 
similar Bond-esque stunts occur. Gone in 60 Seconds could also promote 
awareness about how easy it is for car thieves to steal your car. It may 
encourage people to be safer about where they park, and security measures 
they use. Coming out of the screening, I got handed a helpful guide with ten 
ways to protect your car from car thieves. 
There are more than eighty people listed under the stunts section of the 
credits. If this doesn't give you an idea about what type of movie this is, I 
don't know what will.

Review for 20 Dates (1998)
There are so many people that live their lives wanting to become a filmmaker or
do something in the film related business. Every year they enter our nation's
film schools with the high hopes that they too may one day make a movie that
will be loved and adored by millions, then make a billion dollars, earn
themselves a lifelong career, and start dating a supermodel. But seriously, how
often does this type of thing really happen? 20 Dates is supposed to be a movie
about a guy that goes on twenty different dates in LA and secretly films them
to show what real life dating is like. However, I actually found the film to be
much more of the man's quest to make his first ever Hollywood movie.
Myles Berkowitz is an aspiring filmmaker who's come up with a brilliant idea.
He's going to film 20 dates with 20 different women to see what dating and love
is really like, instead of what we are usually shown in the movies. His first
problem is funding, on what are supposedly secretly taped conversations Myles
and Elie Samaha, who's forking over the $60,000 to make the picture will only
do it if he can hire actresses to go out with him. Myles sees this as trying to
kill his artistic vision, but he's the producer so sooner or later he will have
to agree.
As the film (and a restraining order from a woman who didn't want to be filmed)
go by Elie wants more nudity and more sex in the film and refuses to fund it
unless Tia Carrere is in the picture. This troubles Myles because he's just
met, Elizabeth, he's crazy for her and she seems to be marraige material. So
Myles faces a choice, should he finish the dates and start his movie career, or
should he stay with possibly the only woman that he will ever truly love?
Yawn...
For trying to be edgy and interesting, and being unlike regular love stories,
this film certainly is what's it's trying not to be. None of the dates Myles
takes out are all that interesting and as for Myles himself, he's so god dang
self-involved that I hated him at about the 10 minute point. An interesting
concept with a bad result, 20 Dates gets * 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: Strong language, brief images of strippers in strip clubs, and
lots of talk about putting sex and nudity into the picture make up the most
worrysome content. Good Age: 14 & Up

Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
NOTE: Throughout this review I will designate parts of the film that deserve
Oscar nominations with a @.
I think that if any of us have learned a lesson from all of the movies that
have come out during this past year it's that too much hype is a bad thing.
Star Wars - Episode I: The Phantom Menace was hyped since last November for
being one of the biggest motion picture events ever. The film turned out to be
just a bad marketing scam designed to continue the cash flow to George Lucas's
bank account. How about Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me? While the sequel
to the hit original was funny, it was also packed full of bathroom humor that
was gross and un-appealing. Or for an even better example, how about The Blair
Witch Project, a little film that was supposed to be one of the scariest ever
that barely even brought out a fright. The next heavily hyped film is American
Beauty, being praised as the best film of the year with millions of Oscar
nominations coming it's way. I was hesitant at first, but finally I'm here to
review a film that lives up to it's hype.
Lester Burnham (Spacey @) is living in a middle class neighborhood with his
control freak wife Carolyn, (Bening @) she's a real estate agent who is
competing with Buddy Kane, (Peter Gallagher) the "King" of real estate. Lester
finds his life boring, his teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch @) hates him, his
job is leaving him un-satisfied, and he's beginning to have some type of an
identity crisis. That all changes when he sees Jane's friend Angela, (Mena
Suvari @) he wants her and will do anything to get her.
So he begins working out in the garage to impress her. Lifting weights and
smoking the drugs that are supplied by his next door neighbor Ricky (Wes Bently
@) who Jane soon falls in love with. Ricky films every he sees with a digital
camera he bought with his drug money. As Lester finds what he wants in life,
his family begins to fall apart, Carolyn gets the "royal treatment" from Buddy
Kane, and Jane hates him even more because he's in love with Angela. 
But it's not only the excellent acting and witty screenplay (@) that make
American Beauty what it is, it's the message that it contains. Here is a film
so wonderful that it truly deserves to be seen by every American. If this isn't
a Best Picture (@) winner, I don't know what is. Everything about American
Beauty is interesting and I could easily see this film again and again. The
film does however have one flaw, yes, I'm perfectly aware that this is an edgy,
and experimental film, but it has a little too much sex and a little too much
drug use. Both of these things prevents people like me from seeing the picture,
but I'm sure it's good that they are there. So go and see this film now,
whatever junk you were considering to go see, drop it. You must see this film
now. What are you still reading this for? It's like your not even listening to
me...you must stop reading now. Go to the theater and view American Beauty
which gets **** stars.
The Young-Uns: Ouch, this great film features loads of objectionable content.
Lots and lots of sex talk occurs along with a sex scene and two long views of
two different character's breasts. Drug use also rates as a high, people smoke
pot in at least six scenes. Violence also rates as an extreme because of a
bloody shooting and a man beating up his son. Also, bad attitudes fill up the
entire picture. Good Age: 17 & Up

Title
Review for Innocence (2000)
Young love, it's a subject drenched with nostalgia and sentimentality, but 
what about old love? Can a relationship flourish if its participants are 73? 
Yes, and no
It has been nearly fifty years since Andreas (Tingwell) and Claire (Blake) 
had their love affair in post-war Belgium. Since then, Claire has married 
John (Norris), and Andreas's spouse has passed on. Andreas, still feeling 
what he believes is love, writes a letter to Claire after the half century 
they spent apart. He wants to see her again, and while she is reluctant at 
first, she too cannot deny the passion that lingers between her and Andreas. 
Claire's marriage to John, of course, complicates matters. 
While Innocence has played the festival circuit as a quietly affecting drama, 
it is actually a long-drawn-out, slow comedic tragedy that is always in 
danger of falling apart. The film teeters at its beginning, where Andreas, 
for seemingly no particular reason, writes a letter to his old love. This 
happens over the opening credits, accompanied by images of the couple in 
their early years. Everything was the way it should be back then. Director 
Paul Cox chooses to intercut random shots of the young Andreas and Claire 
together throughout the film. This happens until he eventually gave me the 
feeling that these people were trying to relive their teenage years, rather 
than share a contemporary, yet old-fashioned relationship. Claire remarks at 
least five times, "Don't act that way. It's like I'm seventeen again." All 
three main characters over-analyze their situations to obscene standards, and 
use lots of big words. It is, indeed, like watching an episode of Dawson's 
Creek with much, much older actors. More unnecessary scenes and dialogue pile 
up as it goes on. This should have been much tighter.
Cox should be thankful for his actors. They save the entire movie and nearly 
make the whole thing believable and enjoyable. Charles Tingwell, Julia Blake, 
and Terry Norris all give excellent performances. There is a sense of truth 
in their work that evades the rest of the picture. Innocence is, like The 
Straight Story, a reminder that there are many aged actors overflowing with 
talent that aren't getting any work in Hollywood today. Congratulations are 
also in order for Tony Clark, the film's cinematographer. 
Age might play a big factor in whether or not you enjoy Innocence. The film 
will certainly appeal to an older demographic, who will probably appreciate 
it more than I did. Innocence doesn't lose all innocence completely, but 
there wasn't enough here for me.

Title
Review for Timecode (2000)
I believe it's unfair to call Time Code an actual movie. The word experience 
is a better fit. The Time Code experience involves the screen being split 
into four different images, each with a different character focus, as they 
all play at the same time. The sound gets turned up on the one Figgis wants 
you to watch. One could describe it as watching four different shows on MTV 
all at once. The story relies heavily on this split screen factor and this is 
a very visual film with little complicated dialog. It has to be. Even with a 
slightly complicated plot, this movie would have been even more of a frenzy 
of annoying pointless images than it was. Essentially, a frenzy of annoying 
images describes the film well. This film is a foray into the different and 
the unusual, but carries little meaning. While Figgis has created a 
groundbreaking filmmaking approach, he seems concentrated on making sure the 
audience can handle it, rather than keep an interesting storyline going. It 
has been a long time since a movie has challenged you in such a way as this 
one does, but I felt it could have been even more challening if trust was put 
in the audience. Time Code dares to go freeform, and encourages the viewer to 
look at these characters and their surroundings with lightning fast 
comprehension before moving onto the next frame. Like any new method to come 
onto the film scene, it will take time to master, but consider Time Code the 
beginning of a new era in film.
The movie was shot entirely in one afternoon last November using hand-held 
cameras. There are no edits. Everything is real time. There is no set plot 
structure either. While Figgis gave his actors basic character outlines, he 
decided it would be much more interesting if the film was almost entirely 
improvisational. This is both an attraction and a detraction.  There are 
times when you sense the actors come up with things right off the top of 
their heads, and those parts of the film are exciting and fun. Character 
reactions are a key part of this movie that centers around Red Mullet 
Productions (both the producers and setting for this film) during auditions 
for a new movie. In the upper left corner Rose (Wild Wild West recovering 
Salma Hayek) is going to the audition with Lauren (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Rose 
and Lauren are lovers, and the latter suspects infidelity. In the upper 
right, Emma (Saffron Burrows, Figgis's wife) consults her psychiatrist about 
her husband Alex (Stellan Skarsgard) whom she suspects is cheating on her. 
Alex is indeed cheating on her, and he occupies the lower right frame. 
Finally, in the bottom left is an aspiring actress that comes to audition for 
the lead role at Red Mullet.
After this basic setup, the camera roams free. Characters pop up in two 
different frames at once, or switch frames entirely. It's interesting to see 
how this effect gets used. One scene that I found bizarre involved Alex and 
an anonymous female having sex behind a movie screen. The screen was being 
used to show actresses moaning loudly from sexual pleasure during an audition 
for a group of executives. Another common element that unites the characters 
is the frequent bothersome earthquakes. Much care must have been taken into 
the timing to make the illusion of an earthquake appear in all four parts at 
the same time. These tremors that connect the characters continuously 
reminded me of the character connecting amphibians from the end of Magnolia. 
The ensemble cast that includes Steven Weber, Holly Hunter, Julian Sands, 
Leslie Mann, and Laurie Metcalf, as well as the actors mentioned above, have 
fun with their roles. It's no surprise though that the movie is inconsistent, 
but by the hour mark, I found myself comfortably able to grasp all that was 
going on. Time Code is almost interactive. It allows people to get a 
different experience of the movie each time they see it. The themes are the 
same though. Woe, jealousy, and betrayal all occupy different parts of the 
screen often. Everyone is cheating on everyone, and all the women are 
lesbians. Late in the film a young female independent filmmaker comes forward 
with an idea of new age filmmaking. "The end of editing is upon us!" she 
preaches. "Imagine a movie with four different images all running at the same 
time." Alex blows this idea off, and cannot control his laughter at the 
proposal. He tells her what a load of crap he thinks it is. She takes the 
criticism surprisingly well, and replies with a thank you stating he's the 
only honest person she has ever met in Los Angeles. By the time it reaches 
the conclusion, the facade of quality and honesty in Time Code is gone. It 
was then I realized the emptiness that ran through this movie. While Time 
Code is definitely worth seeing for the very original concept it presents, 
there's no hiding that little actual material lies under its surface.

Title
Review for Butcher Boy, The (1997)
What happens when you get angry? Many people suppress their anger, and hold 
all of their feelings inside until everything eventually comes bursting out. 
Others let their wrath run wild, not really caring what damage is done as 
long as they feel better. Me, Myself & Irene, starring Jim Carrey, recently 
examined this idea. However, that was a comedy. The Butcher Boy is a drama. 
Little Francie Brady (Eamonn Owens) is an uncontrollable brat. His father 
(Stephen Rea) is a drunk who has a less than friendly relationship with his 
mother (Aisling Oâ^Ŕ^ŮSullivan). The two are always fighting in front of their 
child and the mother tries to hang herself within the first ten minutes of 
the movie. Francieâ^Ŕ^Ůs only friend is Joe (Alan Boyle). Joe treats Francie 
well, and fulfills his needs for companionship. Through a series of events 
(mostly involving another child named Phillip that Francie picks on) Joe 
begins to realize Francie is a rude and cruel person. He tries to distance 
himself from Francie as much as he can, and starts hanging out with Phillip. 
Wanting Joe as his own, Francie seeks revenge. He does horrible things to 
Phillip and his home. In his attempt to win Joeâ^Ŕ^Ůs friendship, Francie will go 
to extreme measures. How extreme he gets may shock you.
The reason this film requires such a long plot summary is because this is a 
very complicated movie. The film looks at anger and how itâ^Ŕ^Ůs handled by 
several people with insight. Ultimately, it reaches the idea that most anger 
stems out of confusion. Confusion plagues Francie Brady. The movie seems like 
it's told in first person, but is really told in third.  Some imaginative 
dream sequences only add to the puzzlement. In one scene, Francie and Joe are 
the last remaining humans after an apocalypse. In a strange attempt to link 
Communism and the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis with confusion, everyone 
in town turns into a pig. The remaining creatures all turn into aliens that 
look like something from an Ed Wood movie. Even stranger is the Virgin Mary. 
She appears to Francie and offers him advice. She also frequently uses the 
f-word. 
Director Neil Jordan did an exhaustive search of the world for someone to 
play Francie, and he found the perfect person. Eamonn Owens is brilliant in 
his first role. He never seems to worry whether youâ^Ŕ^Ůll like his character or 
not, and he meets everything with an extensive set of emotions and often 
understanding. Alan Boyle is good too. They both capture the sense of freedom 
and change many people experience in their youth. Their performances help a 
movie where the adult acting is lackluster.
When Francie commits his disturbing final act, I could feel what was going 
through his mind. The Butcher Boy is a dark drama that brings its viewer 
deeper into childhood insanity than many will ever want to be. 

Title
Review for Kyua (1997)
"Cure" by itself is confusing. It's awfully slow, and takes a while for 
payoff, if such an ending can really be called that. The story follows a 
detective who is investigating a series of murders where the victims have Xs 
slashed into their throats, usually by their best friends. When the 
mysterious amnesiac the police think has planted hypnotic suggestions into 
the murder's brains comes in for interrogation, things become only more 
difficult. As the investigation continues, our detective hero finds himself 
entangled in the mastermind's web of thought, and finds his feelings about 
his amnesiac wife souring. 
Got all that? Seattle International Film Festival 2001's emerging master 
Kiyoshi Kurosawa (no relation to Akira) peppers his story with long, gazing 
shots that have little to do with what's going on, and then inserts important 
plot points in quick flashes. The result is a lumbering thriller that winds 
you up on its little finger, and then lets you off with absolutely no reward, 
and certainly no purpose. This is just another violent, action/gangster film 
from Japan. 
After the film in a question and answer session, Kurosawa explained what was 
going on. I wondered if we had just seen the same film. While moody and 
atmospheric, the filmmaker's job to accurately convey the story he imagined 
fails. Kurosawa is emerging, but he's hardly a master. Avoid this one.

Review for Can't Hardly Wait (1998)
Can't Hardly Wait is supposed to bring back the teen comedy, the days where
virginity was discussed in detention, where Sean Penn was a skateboard dude,
where angry vice-principals tracked you down on your sick days. While the film
does some of this, it's really putting a modern twist on what we have seen over
and over again.
The setting is perfect, the Girl Who's Party It Is (an aptly named character
along with creative ones such as Boy Who Steals Everything and Ready To Have
Sex Girl) holds a bash on Graduation night with her parents away from home,
it's a must-come event and every member of the student body will be there.
Enter our hero, Preston (Embry) he's been lovestruck by Prom Queen Amanda 
(Jennifer Love Hewitt, who seems to be content not running from Ben Willis) and
decides to finally tell her how he feels. Love adopts her quiet, popular girl
role of the recently dumped (by a full-of-himself jock named Mike played by
Peter Facinelli) well, but she adds tones of drama that aren't needed.
Accompanying him is Denise (Ambrose, who's great, what else has she been in?)
she's goth outcast without the makeup who gets stuck in a bathroom with Kenny
(Seth Green) a white homeboy, obsessed with being black. Also in for the ride
is William (Charlie Korsmo) school nerd who attempts to gain revenge against
Mike by taking Polaroids of him with one of his friends in a naked embrace.
Great cameos are also present, with Jerry O'Connell, Selma Blair, Melissa Joan
Hart (who could have been more in the movie to give it more of a satire feel)
and Jenna Elfman as a stripper. Yes, you heard me correctly, Jenna Elfman is a
stripper. I have awarded this film the Consistency (please tell me I spelled
that right) award of 1998. It's a film that you'll discover something new about
after every repeated viewing. However it is a tad contrived, and just a bit
predictable. But the film embraces it's spirit making this light-hearted
romantic comedy a sure one to go see.  

Title
Review for Titan A.E. (2000)
Cale is a young man with muscles to spare. His father invented the Titan, a 
machine that would create an entirely new planet where humans could live. An 
evil alien race called the Drej destroyed earth, afraid of what might happen 
if the Titan worked. Even though they speak in subtitles, it is obvious the 
Drej mean business. Many years later, Korso, a spaceship captain, has found 
Cale, for whom he has been searching the galaxy. It turns out Cale's father 
left a map to the secret location of the Titan in a ring his dad gave him as 
a young child. So he joins the Korso and his crew, which also includes an 
attractive woman named Akima. The two strike up a relationship during the 
search for the Titan. The Drej are never close behind, especially since 
someone on the ship is a Drej spy. It is a classic race against time with 
limited resources as humanity's last hope attempts to foil bad guys and 
create a new planet for mankind.
Titan A.E. (A.E. stands for After Earth) never fails at being visually 
appealing. All characters were hand drawn, but are put into computer 
generated backgrounds. The result does look a bit awkward, yet it works 
surprisingly well. The movie would not have been as fantastic with hand drawn 
backgrounds. Likewise, computer created characters would have seemed strange. 
The finale, which takes place in a large belt of floating ice orbs, looks 
incredible. The script sets up many chances for interesting alien species 
too. Each seems to come from an animal of the earth. A space professor looks 
strangely like a turtle on two legs, and Stith (voiced by Janeane Garofalo) 
is a strange kangaroo mutation with large grasshopper legs. Yes, you read 
that correctly. Janeane Garofalo voices an alien. That's the first problem 
with the movie. It is painfully apparent who the voices are. Normally this 
would not be a problem, but the voices fit clumsily with the characters. 
Rather than watching Cale and seeing him as a distinct person, Matt Damon's 
face keeps coming up. The same goes for Drew Barrymore's Asian Akima. Even if 
the directors were casting against type, it feels strange. I said to myself, 
"Wow! That alien sounds just like Nathan Lane!" This is not a good thing.
The script may be the reason so much attention goes to the voices. The 
derivative text is an accumulation of patches from different science fiction 
films. Even so, it never fails to be entertaining. It has the same quality of 
a bad Nickelodeon cartoon. You know what is going to happen, but you enjoy it 
anyway. A few twists seem forcefully added into the string of events. These 
plot turns are never very exciting though. With three minds coming together 
for the screenplay, it should have been better. Especially since Joss Whedon, 
creator and writer of the smart television program Buffy The Vampire Slayer, 
was on the team. The story always seems focused on the big picture, and never 
stops to add in a joke or two. The soundtrack is also a blunder. Rock songs 
like Creed's overplayed "Higher" accompany most action and non-action scenes. 
Random tracks seem added just to get a good list of artists on the 
soundtrack.  
This movie is stupid and cheesy in ways only a sci-fi movie can be. It tries 
to mix traditional stuff of the genre with supposed new material, and will 
probably succeed with young males, the main audience for science fiction. The 
images presented are of high quality, generic screenplay aside. Titan A.E. 
always seems rushed to reach its conclusion, but the trip there is fun and 
exciting.

Title
Review for Road Trip (2000)
In some of my recent reviews I have talked about the expected audiences for
movies. If examples like this would happen more often, I would easily be able
to write an essay on the subject, my thesis would be that the movie is the
audience. Likewise, the audience is the movie. During the press screening of
Road Trip that I attended, a local radio station had also given away several
tickets to that show. DJs from the station proceeded to throw everything from
gum, Frisbees, Cds, posters, keychains, and yes, even condoms at us from the
front and the back of the theater, before and after the movie. This gave me a
strong impression of the movie before it even began. The sexually charged film
is a masterpiece for its frat boy audience. The audience indeed laughed their
heads off. I admit that most of the time I was laughing along with them. The
talking dog, the grandpa who uses Viagra, and the talking penis. All at the
time were very funny. However, Road Trip is one of those comedies that, in
retrospect, you can't think of why you laughed it at all. It does a great job
of keeping us interested in the rebellious actions and anarchism happening on
screen; but just hours later, all I had left was an empty feeling. Maybe it's
because it isn't really summer yet. Perhaps I'm still expecting some artistic
value in a movie. However, it could be that the characters are just as hollow
as my feeling of the movie was.
Josh Porter (Meyer, who starred in the excellent teen movie Dancer, Texas Pop.
81) is in a long distance relationship with Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard). He goes
to Ithaca in New York and she does to the University of Austin. One night, Josh
has sex with Beth (Amy Smart) who insists on filming themselves while they make
love. Somehow, the tape of the two's rendezvous gets mailed to Tiffany, so Josh
and three of his buddies must drive to Austin and intercept the tape before it
reaches Tiffanyâs eyes. This is a setup for the usual R-rated teenage movie
fodder that includes the essential elements like drug use, explosions, and
virginity shattering sex. Each of the four main characters is supposedly
different, we get traits to associate them with, but they are really just the
same horny college guy. Thus, we get left with the female characters to watch.
One of which is an idiot (Tiffany), while the other (Beth), begins to doubt her
expectations of a relationship from her night of sexual passion. On a bus, she
asks the woman next to her if there is any hope for a solid relationship in the
world. Yes, the woman replies. She also adds that it comes with batteries. 
With so many indistinguishable characters, where does the film find it's real
comedy? The answer is also the casting director's greatest triumph; the triumph
is Tom Green. Green, who has become well known as the gross-out king on his
show that currently airs on MTV, breathes some much needed life into this
movie. He does not participate in the road trip, but does have some fun with a
friend's snake whom he tries, unsuccessfully, to force feed a mouse. He tells
the snake to, "Unleash the fury" with no avail and his unpredictable and
annoying actions (the reasons I never watch his show) are right at home in this
movie. Seann William Scott (who also starred in the similarly themed, but far
superior American Pie) proves once again (as if Final Destination wasn't
enough) that there isn't a good acting bone in his body. Meyer and Smart have
both been in better movies, and the rest of the cast is relatively unknown. The
thing I found most disappointing about Road Trip though, was its conclusion.
There wasn't really a climax to any of the events of the previous 85 minutes.
The only climaxes occurring in this movie came from the genitalia of the
characters. At least five different femaleâs breasts and a scene of brief
full frontal nudity later, I could tell the film succeeded with its intended
crowd. The shopping complex I attended the screening at was closed that evening
because they were hosting the after movie party for the opening night of the
Seattle International Film Festival. Something interesting happened while I was
paying for parking. A young couple, both wearing a wardrobe consisting of
entirely genuine, all black leather, were talking about the artistic meaning of
the movie they just attended in front of me. In the line next to me, a fortyish
man with a large beer gut was partying with teenagers half his age as they
passed around the condoms, Road Trip posters, and radio station bumper stickers
distributed earlier. I was in no way drawn to this movie, but as I looked at
the couple in front of me again, and then back to the adolescents, I couldn't
help but smile.

Review for Astronaut's Wife, The (1999)
There are times when you just seem to disagree with what everyone else has said
about a movie. I’m sure out there (somewhere) there are people who loved Wild
Wild West, or thought Jawbreaker was a funny movie, there may even be some
people who enjoyed Idle Hands. But if I am  the major supporter of one film
this year that everyone else hated its got to be The Astronaut’s Wife. While
certainly got a quality thriller in the spiritual and life-changing meaning
sense, it still delivers what it set out to do in the first place, be a good
summer movie.
Spencer Armacost (Depp) is an astronaut whose wife is worried about him when he
goes out on his next expedition into space. While in orbit, Spencer and another
astronaut get cut off from all communications for nearly two minutes. They
manage to make it out alive and are regarded as heroes when they return to
earth.  But his wife Jillian (Theron), a school teacher, seems to notice some
differences in him after he lands. He takes a high class job in New York
without even telling her, and the other man he was up in space with dies. Not
to mention his wife electrocutes herself in the shower. 
Jillian soon learns that she is to be the mother of two bouncing baby boys.
Twins that look eerily like little alien bodies. Spencer gets to be stranger
and stranger, sometimes he doesn’t call if he’s coming home late and he
always seems to be listening to different frequencies on the radio. We all know
something is wrong, but we can’t quite figure out what. Then a NASA scientist
shows up at her door with some of the medical records and documents on Spencer
before he got on the spaceship and after. All of the newer ones seem slightly
altered then the ones he signed before getting on the ship. Poor Jillian begins
to think that her Spencer is no longer human and some type of alien creature
has taken the place of her former husband. The idea is confirmed when we learn
that Spencer is stalking the scientist and beats her when she tries taking
pills to kill the baby. 
Yes, I am fully aware that this sounds like an extremely cheap rip-off of
Rosemary’s Baby, but it’s not. There aren't any evil aliens with ray guns
that try to take over the solar system, the film mostly deals with the suspense
and wonder of Spencer's true identity. The suspense is drawn out just about as
far as it can, the film is EXTREMELY slow for the first thirty or forty minutes
until things get rolling. Theron is great, while slightly unbelievable as a
pregnant woman (she still retains her thin frame) she adds a lot of emotion
that you probably don’t expect from seeing the trailers. Johnny doesn’t get
to do much in this picture, and the only word I could come up with for his
acting ability would be retrained. The ending is kind of a disappointment, it
easily could have been made so that we wonder what happens to the her two sons.
Still, the film shot well, has some clever twists and turns, and has some
pretty tense moments. If only Jillian could have been able to discover for
herself what was happening to her husband instead of someone else telling her.
I think it would have been much scarier that way. A good movie in the midst of
August junk, The Astronaut’s Wife gets *** stars.
The Young-Uns: Tense moments, and death by electrocution occurs near the
beginning and end of the film. A man also rapes his wife and there is some
language. Good Age 14 & Up

Review for Life and Times of Hank Greenberg, The (1998)
Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron. These players most often get thought of
when people look at prominent baseball figures from the 1930s and 1940s.
However, another great slugger of the time often gets overlooked. Hank
Greenberg, the first Jewish baseball player to not change his name to a
Christian one usually gets forgotten. Those who remember him are most likely
baseball buffs, or former residents of the Detroit area. Director Aviva Kempner
wanted to change that. After Greenberg's death in 1986, Kempner began a 12 year
struggle for funding, filming, and spreading awareness of this film. Her hard
work is evident. The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg is a wonderful
documentary. It's just long enough to keep it from getting boring, it has a
good amount of humor, and the interviews and cross-references are mini-marvels.
Hank Greenberg first stepped to the plate in 1934 when he got signed to the
Detroit Tigers. Throughout the season, especially when the pennant race heated
up, he has the constant target of anti-Semitic remarks from people in the
crowd. Baseball was America's game, and some believed Jews shouldn't be allowed
to play it. Greenberg gained popularity by hitting most often one or two home
runs a game, and leading his team to the pennant. For so many people though, he
was much more than a baseball player. He was a Jewish icon, a sign of hope. A
voice speaking to all Jews in America that said they could be just as
successful as the "true" Americans. In one interview a fan describes his school
days when they used to listen to baseball games on the radio during class.
Whenever Greenberg came up to the plate all the other kids would look at him,
perhaps thinking he knew whether he would hit a home run or not. Indeed he was
a sense of pride for people he hadn't even met. While Hank Greenberg was a very
tall (6'4'') and gawky man, he was not a very religious one. He rarely attended
synagogue, and played on Rosh Hoshanah, but decided not to play on Yom Kippur.
Despite this, he was still considered a religious symbol of hope. The film also
chronicles his experience in the military, as well as his final seasons with
the Tigers, and his one year playing on the Pittsburgh Pirates.
I really enjoyed The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg, mostly because of its
humor and subject matter. I personally have never had a large interest in
baseball, but I found the movie entertaining because I knew very little about
the man before seeing it. It's enjoyable because we are supposed to take the
film in a light sense. All fans (mostly famous Jews including Walter Matthau,
Carl Levin, and Alan M. Dershowitz) celebrate their experience with and
memories of him with zeal. The film opens and closes with another treat, the
Marx Brothers singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" in Yiddish. While we don't
get a heavy focus on racism and anti-Semitism, Kempner expects the audience to
comprehend what this man had to go through without making the racism factor
seem overwrought. In the last minutes of the movie, Hank Greenberg meets Jackie
Robinson who at that time got taunted much more than when Greenberg first
started. The two talked long after their game, and Jackie Robinson later
described Greenberg as, "Nothing but class." Itâs a kind, simple, and
somewhat sweet way to end the film. The movie is about a man and his fans with
an undeniable passion for baseball, but the film paints a larger picture. It
shows us an America on the verge of change. Well done Ms. Kempner, your twelve
years of labor are well worth it.

Review for Dancer, Texas Pop. 81 (1998)
Dancer, Texas Pop. 81 is moviemaking gem. Yes, it does belong in the barrel of
teen films with good looking stars, but that's about it. Instead of filling our
heads with stupid romances that we don't care about, and proms we will never
attend, we are treated to a great 97 minute character study. 
Four guys have had a solemn vow since the fifth grade that they would leave
their tiny Texas town of Dancer when they graduated from high school to go to
LA, get jobs, and be together. But soon their plans change.
Terrell Lee's (Peter Facinelli) father in the oil business and he wants him to
run it, even though his son doesn't want to. He forbids him to go to LA and
makes him stay. When Terrell Lee firsts tells the group this, they view it as
betrayal, but then they also stop to think about what they will be leaving
behind. What if they don't get jobs? What if they have everything they've ever
needed right in front of them?
John's (Eddie Mills) dad has that 18 years and out policy, he doesn't want him
to go to college, in fact, it seems as if he doesn't care about him at all.
John is an excellent rancher and is faced with a big decision. Squirrel (Embry)
has a new mother figure around that's trying to help him tame his wild and
drunk dad, and Keller (Meyer) begins to see the flaws in the plans he made.
Another great thing about this movie is the fact the the parents are in
control, aren't shut out of their child's lives, and aren't incredibly naive to
the problems and things that teens are exposed to.
All four actors are wonderful in their roles, especially Embry, as the goofy
Squirrel, he was a charming character that I liked and cared about. Meyer,
Embry, and Facinelli (all of them also appear in Can't Hardly Wait) show fine
promise as young actors in the future. The film could easily have a sequel
showing what happens to the different boys if it have been more popular.
Finding actual people in teen movies is hard. But there is not one stupid or
stereotypical character to be found in this film, that's why I liked it so
much, and that's why I give all of the 81 people that live in Dancer, Texas ***
1/2 stars.

Title
Review for Genghis Blues (1999)
There is not one other film this year that will give off the same amount of
emotions that Genghis Blues does. At first, it's tone is rather comedic, it
follows the story of a blind man's (Paul Pena) journey to Tuva, a country just
north of Mongolia, to enter the throat singing championships. Throat singing is
manipulating the human voice into singing two notes at once, and Paul's
nickname is earthquake for a reason
He is greeted by everyone. Being one of the first Americans ever to want to
visit Tuva, he spends most of the film traveling the countryside and singing in
the contest. He experiences his first sheep slaughtering, a bath in a holy
river, and delicious Tuvan vodka. His times there are very happy, but things
begin to go bad. Running out of his depression medication, the crew in forced
to have some shipped directly to them (which isn't very easy.) This let's us
see Paul's more vulnerable side, and it's extremely sad.
But the film is so much more than that. Have you ever seen a film that can be
sad, uplifting, depressing, and trimuphant all at the same time? No, you
haven't. In Paul's home of San Francisco he is just a stupid blind man who's
only place he can go by himself is the local mini-mart. They tell of a time
where Paul was asked directions while a man took a $400 dollor check out of his
hand. 
But in Tuva he is a god. And his memories there is something that people can
never take away from him. Genghis Blues appeared at the Seattle International
Film Festival and has begun a two week run in Seattle. I'm not sure if it will
be released elsewhere, but if it does, I highly recommend that you see this
wonderful movie. This is a true triumph of human emotion. Genghis Blues gets
*** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains a sheep slaughtering scene (it's not that bad)
and some mild language. Good Age: 9 & Up

Title
Review for Big Momma's House (2000)
Whether you see Big Momma’s House or watch Lawrence’s 1999 film Blue Streak, 
you will have seen the other movie. The two films contain the same lame 
comedy and rely on Lawrence's charm and energy to perk things up. While 
Streak was tolerable, House is rarely satisfactory. There are few genuine 
laughs from the script by Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer. The mostly juvenile 
humor found here belongs in an Adam Sandler movie. 
Malcolm (Martin Lawrence) is an undercover cop, and a master of disguise. His 
latest case involves a man who robbed a bank. His bank teller girlfriend 
Shelly (Nia Long) may or may not have been in on it. When the man is released 
from prison, Shelly flees her home bringing her son Trent (Jascha Washington) 
along with her. She decides to visit her obese mother, known to most as Big 
Momma. Since Momma has left town, Malcolm sees an excellent opportunity. He 
disguises himself as Big Momma, hoping Shelly will eventually crack and tell 
him everything she knows, including her boyfriend's whereabouts. Several 
problems arise with this plan including Malcolm’s poor cooking ability, 
keeping the undercover project a secret, and delivering a baby. Further 
problems arise when Malcolm begins to fall in love with Shelly and the real 
Big Momma returns home. Anything that could possibly go wrong does. The 
script squeezes out any available laughs. No matter how hackneyed or cheap 
they may be. 
There is plenty to giggle at in this movie for elementary school students. 
The movie contains everything your average 4th grader would laugh at. 
Overweight persons, feces, and flatulence are all present. A few chuckles 
escaped my lips, but most gags did not qualify for anything more than an 
amused smile. No matter how inane it gets, the humor is bearable. Big Momma’s 
House never fails at being (or trying to be) funny. The main problem is a 
dreadful story. After an outline of events, the script literally stops. There 
are sixty or so minutes in between where nothing feels fake or scripted. 
Lawrence's comic experiments fill this period of the movie. His energy is 
vital for navigating through a screenplay littered with every southern cliché 
you can think of (fried chicken, a spirited church ceremony, etc.) 
Implausibility is everywhere. Any person with the slightest intelligence 
would realize that Malcolm’s Big Momma is actually a man. Clues are present 
in lots of places, but the characters are clueless. Even worse than some of 
the humor and the implausibility is when Momma morphs into a romance in its 
final minutes. The film certainly does not work as one. It made me wonder why 
Hollywood does not turn scripts from nine and ten year-olds into movies. Most 
of these films would be of a much higher quality and have far more depth than 
this one.
Martin Lawrence exhibits a level of animation common in his movies. He just 
needs better material to work with. The beautiful Nia Long was surprisingly 
dull. She is stuck in what essentially is a one-man movie and does not do 
much. Other supporting performances are easily forgettable and seem 
restrained. The filmmakers were obviously trying to make this movie appeal to 
a young audience, as is apparent from Big Momma’s PG-13 rating. However, the 
film would be better suited as a loud, bawdy, and rude foulmouthed comedy. 
One can only hope that Nutty Professor II: The Klumps will be better.
There is nothing alive in this movie. The screenplay and acting both fall 
short, and the ending of the film is a horrendous and unbelievable happy 
conclusion. The premise gets very tiring and never reaches the guilty 
pleasure zone like Blue Streak did. Lawrence almost saves the lackluster 
humor, but achieves only modest success. This movie might appeal to kids or 
teens, but it did not delight or entertain me.

Title
Review for American Pie (1999)
First of all, let me explain why this movie will do so well. Should I go see a
terrorist thriller or see a movie where a boy gets freaky with some apple pie?
Should I see a western action movie where I see Salma Hayek bear her rear, or a
movie where a foreign exchange student bears her enlarged chest? 
American Pie is like this in many ways, possibly the most outrageous movie this
year, it has several plot holes, but other good stuff to pull itself out of
them. Jim, (Biggs) Finch, (Eddie Kay Thomas) Kevin, (Ian Nicholas) and Oz
(Chris Klein) vow not to keep their penises "flaccid and unused" and thus they
begin their conquets to end their virginity. Jim goes after a foreign exchange
student (Shannon Elizabeth) and broadcasts his experiences over the internet.
Finch has Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) spread rumors about how great he was in bed.
Oz tries to score on the girls in the choir by putting on a sensitive side that
he ends up liking, and Kevin's having trouble with the "l" word.
But what American Pie really does is assualt us with countless sexual gags and
dialog that becomes overwhelming. Whereas, There's Something About Mary
(obviously a major inspiration) centered on love and romance (no matter how
sick and twisted it may be) this attacks us with the same stuff over, and over,
until it decides in it's final minutes to change. Yes, this change comes way
too late and it came off to me as an easy way to end the film. American Pie's
message is that sex isn't everything...but if that's true...what was all the
80-minute masturbation, oral sex, and porno magazines about?

Title
Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
Julia Roberts has been digging herself into a very deep hole, beginning with
the release of My Best Friend's Wedding in 1997. She was cast in the lead role
again and again in the same type of dreamy romance movies, her recent credits
include Stepmom, Notting Hill, and Runaway Bride. After Bride, I was beginning
to get pretty tired of her. It just seemed like she was playing the same person
repeatedly. She has done a marvelous job of digging herself out of the hole
that I mentioned earlier. While she still retains much of the regular Julia
charm, she's able to use it in another way, and the results are a great
comedy/drama that many will enjoy.
Erin Brockovich, (Roberts) a woman with three kids, an interesting assortment
of plunging neckline outfits, and little money, is desperate for a job. When
misfortune leads her to a law office she begs for a job on a whim, right after
her claim is settled. Ed Masry (an amazing Finney) is the head of the small
legal firm. Erin convinces him she will do a good job, and she's hired.
Soon after they hire her, she notices a real estate file that looks suspicious
to her. She investigates the files she finds, which concern chemicals a Pacific
Gas and Electric factory have let get into the water of the small California
town of Hinkley. People in the town are dying of a large variety of illnesses
and everyone has some type of disease or another. For some reason, no one
really seems to do anything about it. They aren't wealthy enough to take care
of their families, and this could go on forever if someone doesn't do
something. Erin discovers that there is an extremely high amount of a deadly
chemical in the water for the town and is determined to help the residents
bring PG&E corporate down. Due to her low knowledge of legal expertise, her and
Masry must team up, in order to win the fight.
Winning performances here from Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. The two have
dazzling chemistry and their is much humor in their developing friendship. The
two make a great team, and writer Susannah Grant (who has also written the
screenplay for the upcoming Sandra Bullock film "28 Days") gives Julia some
great one-liners. It's really fun to see Erin jostle with the big time law
firms. Don't think this movie is all comedy though. It would be appropriately
suited in the dramedy category. The scenes of Erin's struggle with men and her
new love George (Eckhart) are the other part of the movie. The film doesn't get
too crowded, despite it's dramatic and humorous counterparts. Director Steven
Soderbergh (director of two superb pictures, "Out of Sight" and "The Limey")
use the slow fade to death, which makes the film's story appear to be in
chapters, a welcome thing that helps us keep track of the time this movie
covers.
A welcome addition to the Julia Roberts film library, this true story is a fun
drama that will probably appeal to young teenagers and up. Besides the heavy
use of the f-word this would be a good movie to take your kids to. At times
Erin's strife feels too easy, at times too hard, but by the end of the movie,
you'll be rooting for her. The real Erin Brockovich is in the movie, look for
her in the diner scene as a waitress named Julia. What fun, I can't wait to see
what Roberts does next. And maybe if the movie catches on, we'll even see a
line of Erin Brockovich clothing, now wouldn't that be interesting.

Title
Review for Road to El Dorado, The (2000)
In recent years the animation genre has greatly improved. Computers are leading
the way into a new dimension of thinking about animation. Witness the deep,
luscious jungles of Tarzan, or the amazing computer work in Toy Story 2. There
have also been animated films aimed at adults (like Antz, Princess Mononoke,
and South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut) that have seen success at the box
office. But for every Iron Giant, there must be a Pokemon: The First Movie.
While the images of The Road To El Dorado are beautiful, it's missing what an
animated kids movie needs most: A good story, humor, and memorable characters.
This movie is most likely to quickly fade away, just like the golden sun of the
city.
It's 16th century Spain, and Miguel (Branagh) and Tulio (Kline) are con men
trying to escape from Pamplona city guards. They stow away on a ship with the
mighty Cortez and are washed up on the island where El Dorado is. The two
journey through the forests and jungles until they reach the magical place. It
is marvelous indeed. Gold lines everything in sight, the two are in heaven. Due
to several natural occurrences and misunderstandings, the two men are mistaken
as gods and are worshipped by all of the people. They are hailed with gold and
riches, if they keep this up, who knows how much gold they could rack up? The
two decide to stay for several days,  rack up all the gold they can, and head
back to Spain. Soon sexy villager Chel (Perez) is also in on the con game. A
crazy priest (Assante) who believes that the gods deserve sacrifices also comes
into the picture, he's just one of the many badly motivated people in this
film, which is littered with potential bad guys. All of this builds up to a
predictable and inevitable conclusion.
The major rave I can give to the movie is the astounding animation. The hues
are vibrant and exciting, they really bring this movie to life. It's too bad
there wasn't a decent story to back this thing up. I found no real interest in
the two main characters, or their situation throughout the entire movie. Miguel
and Tulio have little chemistry or appeal and the most interesting character (a
horse with human emotions and no lines) kept catching my interest rather than
the human characters. Character and plot structure are so lackluster that, if
not for the bright colors, I could have easily fallen asleep amid the boring
middle of the film. I think the real clincher for me on this movie would be the
songs. They are so out of place and so easily forgettable that while trying to
recollect a single lyric from any one of them after the movie, I came up with
nothing. This is really a disappointment, considering the songs were written by
Tim Rice and Elton John who did marvelous work on The Lion King. The theme may
also worry some parents, the two leads lie, cheat, and steal...and usually get
away with it.
My only theory as to the creation of this film was that Jeffrey Katzenberg is
trying to prove to Disney that Dreamworks has just the same amount of
technology behind their animation studios as the mouse ears do. But Disney
films (and others like The Iron Giant) know that in order for a family animated
movie to be good, it must capture the imaginations of children and maybe even
some of the adults who accompany them. There is little sign of this here, the
visuals are there, but the inspiration, and sense of wonder are lacking. The
Road is rocky and unpaved, and certainly not filled with gold.

Title
Review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)
Director: Ron Howard
Writers: Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman
Cast: Jim Carrey, Jeffrey Tambor, Taylor Momsen, Christine Baranski
Rated PG, 102 minutes
Though the vicious halls of elementary school are known as breeding grounds 
for cruel treatment, no teasing was as mean or strangely inane as what our 
green fiend experienced in his childhood. It turns out the reason the boy got 
so fed up with Christmas in the first place was because he lacked shaving 
skills. Darn those razor blades! Oh yes, you heard me correctly. The young 
Grinch (Jim Carrey) once attended school with sweetheart Martha May Who-vier 
(Christine Baranski) and future major of Whoville (Jeffrey Tambor). The 
little major thinks Martha's his girl, and convinces his classmates the 
Grinch is hairy, ugly, and stupid, but Martha May's turned off by his mean 
ways. The Grinch tries his hand at a razor blade to remove the unwanted hair, 
and appeal to Martha. He gets cuts all over his face, and is subjected to 
public mockery the next day, so he furiously flees town to a nearby mountain 
and disappears forever. He still induces fear in the townspeople. 
Why take such a long time to explain this small plot detail? Because it's 
filler, and that's exactly what most of this movie is. Except for a few 
inspired new moments, this holiday family film really doesn't deserve the 
title of "Dr. Seuss's The Grinch", "Dr. Seuss's The Grinch...Sort Of" is more 
accurate.
Years after the shearing incident, the town of Whoville is preparing for the 
Whobilation, a grand town anniversary coinciding with Christmas. The Major 
keeps citizens in order, hoping the Grinch won-t swarm down from his alp lair 
to foil activities. He does his share to encourage anti-Grinch propaganda, 
but is the emerald guy really so bad? One child, Little Cindy Lou-Who (Taylor 
Momsen) wants to find out. Confused by the true meaning of Christmas, she 
seeks for good in the Grinch's two-sizes-too-small heart. What she finds will 
only surprise you if you've watched no television around Christmas since 1966 
or read no books as a child.
But that's treating the movie too seriously and cynically. If one looks past 
extra patches of story, the result is quite magical. Production values are 
high and simply gorgeous with lush detail throughout the crazy world of 
Whoville. Every building has some kooky feature, and all characters a strange 
characteristic. You know it's a showy, flimsy film set, but it convinces as a 
city. In this year's Best Makeup Oscar category, makeup artist Rick Baker 
looks to be competing against himself. Whether his work in "Nutty Professor 
II: The Klumps", or the masterful job he does here will win is unsure. 
Regardless, he makes the movie much better than it could have been. Carrey 
contorts inside his extremely painful suit of lime-dyed yak hair and numerous 
face pieces with charming vigor. It makes for the year's most unique 
performance. He finds a suiting role better than his dual job in "Me, Myself 
& Irene". With no big contenders this year, "The Grinch" could finally mean 
an Oscar nomination for its star. The Whos look awesome too. They have long 
animal snouts, and each 90 some Who has completely different facial features. 
Watching a special on E! (I'm not quite above watching that network), and 
seeing every step taken to get the movie to feel and appear just right, it's 
downright amazing what they did. 
Jim Carrey sings the original Grinch song with panache and no voice 
alteration other than the mouthpiece he already wears for the role. Among 
other treats include the Grinch doing a dead-on imitation of a director 
(presumably Ron Howard). Anthony Hopkins's key speaking role as the narrator 
gets handled with care and grace, an excellent choice.
Yet there's that extra story. It sticks out like a jagged icicle waiting for 
Sharon Stone's ice pick. Seuss's wife, who gave Howard rights for the film 
after waiting out for near eternity, had some control over the film. She 
demanded certain bathroom humor scenes be removed, a thankful thing. She 
apparently, however, had no power over the overall story. And what happens? 
The message gets muddled. 
Watch the original 1966 television program before seeing the film to remind 
yourself as to the intention of its brilliant late author. After that, see 
the film. Despite its flaws, this is something you must see.
Early in the film Little Cindy's mother Betty Lou Who (Molly Shannon) is 
competing with Martha May in a Christmas light contest. Stringing bright 
lights as fast as possible with severe difficulty, Betty stops for a moment 
to talk with Martha about her fairly unadorned home display. Martha shows her 
a large Christmas light machine gun that shoots and staples illuminators to 
her house with stylish ease. Betty looks on, horrified. It's a classic moment 
in a film that could have been so.

Review for Dîner de cons, Le (1998)
If there has been a better comedy of errors this year than I'd reccomend it be
shown with this delightful French import from the director of La Cage aux
Folles. It could be a laugh all day film festival, because that's exactly what
this movie is. What seems like the French "Bean" turns out to be an even more
hilarious romp. This movie will have you laughing for days after, and I'm glad
I'm able to share this review with you.
A man is on a train with Francois Pignon (Villeret) when he begins to pull out
pictures of different things he has built out of matches. Guess how many
matches it took? He asks, 364,422! Pierre is charmed, because he's found an
idiot for his friend Pierre Brochant (Lhermitte.) Every Wednesday they invite
an idiot to have dinner in order to make fun of him all evening. Tonight it's
his turn, and before now, he was idiotless. Plus, this guy is in a class of his
own.
Pierre cracks his back while playing golf, the doctor tells him not to go to
the dinner for his better health but since his idiot is the cream of the crop
he attempts to go anyway. Then his wife Christine (Alexandra Vandernoot)
decides to leave him for his cruelty for others. He thinks he's gone to the man
he stole her from, then decides she's at a local love club. But in order get
the phone number there they have to call a tax auditor. The idiot worsens
Pierre's back problems and screws up any of his chances of getting back
together with his wife. A complex plot is soon laid out in the household.
Another film from Veber that is full to the brim with original comic ideas.
Name one comedy that takes happens in one place, in a foreign language, and
that is incredibly funny. One of the best parts about The Dinner Game (besides
that cool looking animation that showcases the titles and credits for the film)
is the fact that while it's called The Dinner Game, there is no dinner or no
game at all. The film's comedy owes almost everything to Villeret, he's someone
you can just look at and laugh. When the film is remade in the US (with Robin
Williams as the idiot) it will probably lose all of the charm and the wit that
is featured here. The supporting cast is good, but it's obvious who's in the
center of attention. So, go see The Dinner Game while you can, this funny,
original, and interesting French comedy gets *** 1/2 stars.

Title
Review for Double Jeopardy (1999)
Now as much as I like independent movies, you know, all those movies that
feature plausible storylines and actual ideas, I couldn't help liking this
movie. Now this didn't just start with the movie, the first time I saw the
trailer with Wild Wild West I was excited about it. While not legally accurate,
this fun idea of a woman being framed and then trying to track down the man
that framed her instantly caught my attention. This is no original film, mind
you, but it is a whole lot of fun.
Libby Parsons (Judd, destined to become a great actress) is thrilled when her
husband buys her a new sailboat, she loves it of course, and after a romantic
evening they go to bed. But when she awakens she finds blood all over
everything, and she finds a bloody knife on the deck, and picks it up right
when the coastguard is coming to arrest her. Nick, (Bruce Greenwood) her
husband, left her $2 million in insurance money, the jury sees this as a motive
for killing him and she is put in prison.
It turns out Nick isn't dead at all, he's kidnapped her son and is now living
in San Francisco with her best friend. But then someone gives her a holiday
present, it's called double jeopardy. It says that any person cannot be brought
to justice on the same crime twice. While this is not actually legally
accurate, the crime would have to be commited in the same location for it to be
legal, it's a great set up and the film has fun with it. When she's put on
parole and commits a crime, her parole officer (Lee Jones) must track her down
as she tries to kill the man that framed her. This begins a thrilling chase
through the Mardi Gras season in New Orleans.
Double Jeopardy is too unbelieveable, even for a Hollywood film. Seriously,
anyone who fires a gun that close to themselves (I'm making a point without
giving away any plot points) would be deaf for the rest of the movie. But if
you can push aside anything you know about law you should have a good time.
Tommy Lee Jones doesn't do much for the film, and actually doesn't have that
big of a role. Ashley Judd is great as Libby, an excellent casting choice, now
if only there was a way to make a sequel. Fun, exciting, and suspenseful,
Double Jeopardy gets *** stars.

Review for Close Shave, A (1995)
The countless numbers of short films that play at your local film festival are
endless. They are not just the hardest pick for your office's Oscar pool. There
are many ideas that can be expressed in just forty-five, thirty, or even
fifteen minutes. The sad thing is that non-festival goers will probably not
have a chance to see any of these films. Despite the occasional Spike & Mike
festival or the new short film websites that are popping up everywhere on the
Internet, these (sometimes) masterpieces don't get much play. That's why it's
amazing when a thirty minute short about the strange relationship between a man
and his dog, and the adventures they go on, became a huge hit. The first two
Wallace and Gromit films (The Wrong Trousers and A Grand Day Out) were big
successes. The Wrong Trousers even grabbed the Oscar for best Animated Short. A
Close Shave is the latest release from Aardman Animations, an Australian
animation company headed by Nick Park (the director of this movie). Aardman is
the front runner (some would say pioneer) in bringing animation to the
mainstream film audience. With the series' recent success, it's not hard to
seek this lovable pair out on video. In fact, I suggest you do so immediately.
Wallace lives in a cozy house somewhere in England with his dog Gromit. Wallace
is an inventor and has all sorts of different gadgets in his house. (For
instance, when he wakes up in the morning, Gromit pulls a rope and his rises
until he drops through the floor into his chair. He is then dressed by a
machine, and gets his toast delivered directly to his awaiting plate.) The
running gag of all these movies is that Gromit is smarter than his master. He
is a literally a person with feelings and sophistication. His favorite
magazines include Technology for Dogs and he always reads the newspaper instead
of fetching it. The duo have regular jobs as window washers and one day they
are invited to clean Wendolene's, the owner of the townâs wool shop, windows.
Wallace falls in love almost instantly, but Gromit has other troubles.
Wendolene has a mean and evil dog named Preston who seems to control her every
move. There is a wool shortage in the city, and the wool has to be rationed,
yet Wendolene has plenty of it. Could she and the dog be stealing sheep to make
wool? You'll have to watch the incredibly funning conclusion to find out.
Every moment of A Close Shave is filled with extremely funny sight gags, many
of which are priceless and will not be forgotten. One of the things I like
about these movies is that the characters are so darn likable that you always
know who to root for, even if you are laughing at them in the process. All of
the animal characters behave in a human manner giving the film an unneeded
comic touch. There is so much funny stuff here that it seems impossible to add
anything more to this wild roller coaster ride. I also enjoy the replay value
that this film has. I own all three shorts (this is by far my favorite) and I
constantly find myself watching them again and again, and I still laugh. Go to
your local video store now and seek Wallace and Gromit out, you'll thank me
after it's over. This short animation masterpiece gets **** stars.
The Young-Uns: There is one scary scene near the end involving a vicious dog,
(I won't say which one) but otherwise there's nothing in the film that's
harmful. Good Age: 4 and up

Review for Lola rennt (1998)
"The ball is round and the game lasts for 90 minutes, everything else is
theroy." A soccer ball is kicked up into the air, and it's what begins this
madcap, incredibly original tale of fast-paced running and love. Lola (Potente)
has 20 minutes to deliver the 100,000 marks that her boyfriend, Manni
(Bleibtreu) has left on the subway. If he does not deliver them to his gangster
boss on time, he will be killed. The movie plays out in three different ways
each of them are special in their own way.
One: Thinking of the people in her life that have a lot of money, Lola sprints
to her father's bank and interrupts a private meeting there.
Two: Lola attemps to rob the bank (definately the best of the three) to get her
money.
Three: Lola tries her luck at the casino.
The best parts of the movie come in fast photos of the people she passes by on
the street. For instance, after banging into a women walking with a stroller
the screen lights up in flashes that show her stealing the child from the real
parents. Other flashes into the future include love between two bank workers, a
lotto winner, and an unfortunate thief. One and Two are followed with great
scenes filmed at an odd angle in red light that show Lola and Manni in bed
together talking about the outcome of what happened in that particular
20-minute rush. The film also gets my award for the best soundtrack so far this
year. It has plenty of cool techno beats that the Go soundtrack needed. What
chances does this soon-to-be art-house fave have at the Best Foreign Film
Oscar? Not much, but it's still enough to make Run Lola Run the best Foreign
film (and perhaps independent film) so far this year.

Title
Review for Soapdish (1991)
Daytime soap operas are always fun to watch because they easily can be made fun
of. Endless plot twists and script changes have to be made every single day on
the set of these shows which sometimes last over thirty or forty years. This is
the setting for the film Soapdish, sort of a soap opera within a soap opera.
It’s the story of the fictional soap opera The Sun Also Sets, and what goes
on behind the scenes when someone tries to sabotage the show. The wild of the
zany antics of the characters may be a little unbelievable, but it’s look at
the television and daytime programming industry is not. 
Celeste Talbert (Field) plays Maggie, the female lead on a long-running popular
soap opera called The Sun Also Sets. The night that she wins the Daytime Emmy,
her husband leaves her for his former wife.  This sends Celeste into a
breakdown and she becomes increasingly stressed and ecstatic. Montana Moorehead
(Cathy Moriarty who steals the show) is an evil, jealous bitch who wants to be
queen of the soaps, but she can’t because Celeste is standing in her way. She
seduces the show’s producer named David (Robert Downey Jr.) into cutting her
out of the show. Determined to get his hands on her David hires a man who was
beheaded years ago on the show that Celeste absolutely hated. Jeffrey Anderson
(Kevin Kline, great as always) was the lead in Death of a Salesman at a Florida
dinner theater for the elderly. Despite her bitter hate for him, Celeste soon
finds herself utterly attracted to the man she had written off the show. 
As the plot on the soap opera unfolds, so does the real life soap opera.
Balloon deliverer Lori Craven (Shue) is cast as a mute homeless girl who turns
out to be Maggie’s daughter but also seems to have some sort of real life
bond with the actress. From there the plot twists and turns until reaching its
final conclusion that the whole television world will be watching. True
identities are revealed, dark secrets emerge, and love conquers all. It’s
just like your regular old daytime soap opera.
Everyone here seems to be playing it over the top and they do it remarkably
well. Sally Field is great as the aging soap actress who’s looking for
someone to love her. The rest of the supporting cast is also great with Kevin
Kline and Robert Downey Jr. sparkling the brightest. There are several scenes
in this movie that I liked. My favorite is probably when the show’s writer
(Whoopi Goldberg being serious, yes, you read me correctly, being serious)
stages a fake celebrity sighting in the mall. Many lines are very funny and
everyone plays well off of each other’s characters. Garry Marshall also makes
an appearance as a TV executive who is drawn to what’s happening on the
television show. This is a great film that shows us what might really happen on
the set of a soap.  There are some minor problems though. The film is too long
(even at 97 minutes), and there always seems to be a bit too much going on for
us to be able to grasp it all in one sitting. They also never mention the fact
that any other soap operas might also be competition for ratings. A great
rental, the fun Soapdish gets *** stars.
The Young-Uns: There is some brief language as well as some sensuality. Good

Review for Traffic (2000)
2000  USA/Germany
Director: Steven Soderbergh
Starring: Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle,
Dennis Quaid, Erika Christensen, Miguel Ferrer, Topher Grace, Amy Irving,
Benjamin Bratt, Albert Finney, Majandra Delfino, Luis Guzman
Something disturbing happened on my way out of `Traffic'. After viewing a two
and a half-hour film on the various sides of the drug war in America, many
fellow audience patrons immediately took out a cigarette and began to smoke
away. That this heavy film, wrought with message and style, had absolutely no
impact on them is beyond comprehension. It seems Steven Soderbergh has created a
work of true questions and limited answers. It's a challenging piece that does
what Spike Lee did to racism in `Bamboozled', only this time the focus is drugs.
However poignant, people think these issues don't apply to them, but they do in
far too many ways.
Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is about to become America's new drug czar,
unbeknownst to his teenage daughter's drug addiction. Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez
(Benicio Del Toro) is a good-hearted Tijuana cop, seemingly the only one not
accepting backroom bribes. Helena Ayala's (Catherine Zeta-Jones) husband Carlos
is on trial for smuggling illegal drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border. Two
police officers in a van (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) are monitoring her every
move. This covers about half of the intricate stories held together by the ever
character-growing script that centers on the competition between two Tijuana
cartels. It's like a trapeze act on tightropes with the performers in clown
makeup juggling bowling pins that are on fire. There's a chance of falling every
second, but just a few minutes with Steven Soderbergh will eliminate all doubts
of plummeting to the three-ring ground. As anyone who saw his 1999 film `The
Limey' could tell you, holding up multiple characters through complicated time
changes is what Soderbergh does best, and it's what makes him a sensational
filmmaker. 
With it's length and tough subject matter, `Traffic' does get a little
depressing, but it seems a desired effect. The cinematography, one of the
highest standpoints of the film, creates a world of suffering through simple
filters. Each segment with a character is either in morbid blue, bleak yellow,
or limited color. This helps to create a gritty feeling that heightens to the
end. It nearly becomes nonfiction in style.
What's so great about `Traffic' is the acting and casting. Besides the
aforementioned actors, the cast also includes Dennis Quaid, Erika Christensen,
Miguel Ferrer, Topher Grace, Amy Irving, Benjamin Bratt, Albert Finney, and
Majandra Delfino, to name a few. This is easily the year's best-assembled group
of actors. Soderbergh discovers things about each one of his players, and allows
them freedom to experiment with their talents. Just one performance is off key,
that being Dennis Quaid's turn as a conniving `friend' of Carlos and Helena. The
womanizing role fits him, but for some reason, there's no energy to his work. 
With ensemble pictures such as these, the question is normally, `Who's going to
get nominated?' There's only one easy answer, Benicio Del Toro. This underused
actor, who just jumpstarted his career with two other thematically related gang
movies `The Way of the Gun' and `Snatch', is beyond perfection. His mostly
Spanish-speaking role aches with the lifelong difficulties of his character.
Beyond him, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas, who by the way share no
screentime together, have the best chance. 
Though better off a statement than a movie, `Traffic' certainly raises questions
that haven't appeared before now. It feels like a documentary, but it also feels
like an elaborate, fanciful fairytale. As if this only applies to a small number
of people near the border, or that the drug war won't take decades to fight. It
will take decades, and it will apply to everyone. `Traffic' is the perfect
icebreaker and introduction to these issues that have no apparent solution or
end.
And another cigarette is lit. And another joint is smoked.

Review for Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. (1999)
Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.
Fred A. Leuchter Jr., a man who improved the electric chair, gallows, and the 
lethal injection machine in the 1980s, should not expect his research to 
concern a large audience. After all, only those receiving capital punishment 
would ever get to experience his work. So maybe Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall 
of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. is supposed to educate its audience about his 
progress in the field. We certainly learn more about the before and after of 
the electrocution process than most will ever need to know. Leuchter is so 
straightforward when he explains why two shocks of electricity must be used, 
or lists everything that could go wrong with a hanging that his graphic 
statements are never short of sickening. He is dismayed there is no interest 
in making executions more humane. Looking for any way possible to increase 
awareness of his research, Leuchter agreed to travel to Poland to investigate 
sites thought to have been gas chambers during the Holocaust for Ernst 
Zundel. Zundel published a pamphlet claiming the Holocaust was a hoax, and 
was brought to court in Canada for printing something he knew was false. 
After some rather amateurish investigation, Fred believes there was no way 
any type of gas chamber could have existed. One gets an even better sense of 
this disturbing man as the film goes on from interviews with his wife and 
others.
This is probably one of the closest attempts to making a documentary horror 
film ever. Fred A. Leuchter Jr. is one of the most interesting subjects to 
come along in a while. When he drones on (sounding amazingly like Woody 
Allen) about why a lethal injection machine is totally different from an 
electric chair he sent chills down my spine. Even scarier is the thought that 
this man is an actual person. His odd appearance, Austin Powers yellow teeth, 
and bizarre coffee addiction makes him even creepier. Errol Morris has an 
exciting visual style that is defined, but never glossy. The movie is always 
attention grabbing for its entire ninety-one minute running time.  
Mr. Death certainly raises questions of free speech. Regardless how many Jews 
disappeared from the planet, Zundel’s trial does raise questions that could 
perhaps be relevant to other cases or situations. Queries also arise about 
the accuracy of Fred’s research. Not only is seeing him illegally rummaging 
through piles of rubble surrounding Holocaust ruins disrespectful, it is 
downright frightening. In one interview the scientist who tested Leuchter’s 
samples of walls and soil from Poland for traces of cyanide reveals he 
probably did the tests wrong. Since cyanide only leaves traces about the size 
of a tenth of a human hair, it is uncertain whether or not the negative 
results are accurate. Looking into his eyes as he admits to probably 
performing the wrong procedures is daunting. These scientific errors could 
happen to you.
This is not an entirely great film, but certainly a unique one that looks at 
death and persons who do not believe in the Holocaust with care and a sense 
of fairness. This is a rare documentary because it examines both sides of the 
issue. Take a journey with Fred A. Leuchter Jr. and you will be disturbed and 
entertained in a way different to anything you’ve experienced before.

Title
Review for Vie ręvée des anges, La (1998)
Being entertained is the purpose that all of us go to the movies. The motion
pictures that fill the screens in your local multiplex shows great adventures
and wonderful romance about five times a day for your viewing pleasure.
Thatâs why it is a rare thing when a film comes along that threatens to be a
movie about the normal (or not normal it is up for you to decide) lives that
people live. We are not talking about only people in America but all around the
world. The French import The Dreamlife of Angels by first time directed Erick
Zonca is just this type of tale. Nothing fancy, no elaborate anything, but
still full of raw, pure emotion. Films like these are rarely, (if ever), made
in the United States. How will US audiences take a movie that wonât excite
them or make them feel happy coming out of the theater? That seems like a
question for this movieâs box office and word of mouth to answer.
Isa (Bouchez) has just begun working at a sewing factory in Lille when she
meets Marie. Marie isnât the type of person to open up to anyone, let alone a
stranger, but the two begin to form a bond of friendship. She invites her to
move into the flat that she is watching over for a mother and daughter who are
in a coma. The girls run about the streets looking for their ideal man and a
good sum of money. 
Isa is obviously much more sensitive and has a much greater amount of empathy
than Marie and begins to visit the girl whom the flat belongs to in the
hospital. One day when Marie tries to shoplift a leather jacket out of a store,
a rich club owner named Chris (Gregoire Colin) rescues her from the police.
Marie fancies Chris until she discovers that he is really a jerk and then rapes
her as payment for the leather jacket. Distancing herself from Isa, she
continues to see the man that has blinded her with feelings of love. The girls
find themselves distancing from one another as their friendship turns into
hatred. 
The Dreamlife of Angels could be re-titled âWhy You Should Go To College and
Get A Good Job.â? The girls do many things in desperation of getting money and
their lives are anything but dreamy. Most of the events showcased in the film
range somewhere between sad, extremely depressing, or just plain horrible. The
acting, on the other hand, is superb, Elodie Bouchez is wonderful as Isa and
has some very emotion scenes that showcase her acting talent. Natacha Regnier
is good as Marie and she does an excellent job with her tough girl attitude
that occupies most of her character. Some of this Dreamlife looks like it was
shot with a home video camera, but it turns out to be OK because the filming
doesnât matter as much as the character development does. The film is
sluggish (the 113 minute running time could easily be shortened to about 95
minutes) and slow in many parts. So I cannot quite recommend it if you are
looking for a fun little movie to watch on a Saturday night. But for those that
are looking for a film with a message that is (somewhat) hard to get, (I am
sure that there are some people like that out there somewhere) rent The
Dreamlife of Angels, it gets ** stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains a sex scene with graphic movement. There are
three separate shots featuring bare breasts, a couple is shown in bed after
sex, and there is some strong language. The film is also drenched with
emotional tension. Good Age 15 & Up

Review for Boys and Girls (2000)
Director Robert Iscove and star Freddie Prinze Jr. both appeared last year in 
the similarly themed She's All That. In that film, Prinze's jock character 
was trying to win a bet by turning an outcast into the prom queen, only to 
fall in love with her. Boys and Girls takes place in college, the next step 
after high school, but some main elements are very much the same. Luckily, 
both films retain a romantic charm that makes them work. Some would attribute 
this to popular teen romance movie star Freddie Prinze Jr. Freddie did make 
movies like Down To You and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer work, but 
Boys and Girls owes its thanks to a marvelous supporting cast. These 
characters are where the film's real comedy comes from, and it makes the 
movie seem like less of a rehash. 
Ryan (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Jennifer (Claire Forlani) have been running 
into each other at different points in their lives. One time they get seated 
on a plane together, another incident years later has them meeting up after a 
football game when her boyfriend runs over his mascot costume. The two are 
gawky and more than a little strange. As luck would have it, they end up 
going to the same college, where they discover the other hasn't changed a 
bit. Ryan must still have a plan for everything and is very uptight. Jennifer 
is free-spirited and still scared of commitment. Their differences turn out 
to form a friendship and they start spending a lot of time with each other. 
Their roommates Hunter (Jason Biggs) who is always trying to score with the 
ladies, and Amy (Amanda Detmer) who is always talking about or talking with 
her therapist, join the circle of friends. Jennifer's convinced her and Ryan 
are just friends, and the two date other people. Ryan's brainy, 
straightforward, and very funny girlfriend Megan (The Blair Witch Project's 
Heather Donahue) and a guitarist are among them. However, Ryan and Jennifer 
can't hold their passion in much longer. 
All of the actors are quite charming in their roles. Freddie Prinze Jr. does 
nothing new, but Claire Forlani finally gets the lead role she's been looking 
for. Both Forlani and Detmer get a chance at laughs they didn't get with 
their last movies, and they succeed. Hunter and Megan are the real comic 
characters though. Hunter makes up so many lies about himself to women, 
hoping it will quickly lead to sex for the night. His tactics, attitude, and 
actions are never short of ridiculous. Megan only appears in a few scenes, 
but was a standout character. Heather Donahue brings her control freak 
by-the-rules Megan to life, and steals the show. My favorite part of the 
movie is when Megan first approaches Ryan and directly asks him out. As she 
says once or twice, "I'm a laser. I know what I want and I go straight for 
it." The soundtrack for the film is very good, and there is a great scene 
where Jennifer takes Ryan out to a club where they dance to âCar Washâ? by 
Rolls Royce. While dancing, they actually are being washed with soap and 
water by the club's plumbing system. This strange modern musical number was 
also a feature of She's All That. 
The appealing actors can't make up for a large amount of very stupid and 
rather pointless lines. At times the lines get convincingly said, at other 
times not, and the movie never reaches a huge level of reality. Jennifer 
complains late in the film about movies like Sixteen Candles, and how they 
never show the relationship six months later when everything is starting to 
fall apart. Despite these comments, this movie does the same thing. I had to 
ask myself how long this relationship could possibly last, but for now it 
makes for an entertaining romance that is sure to please teenagers and adults 
alike.

Review for Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The (1999)
The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc
The story of Joan of Arc is an often told one. Why? That was the question this
movie seemed to keep asking me. Why is this story such a popular one when it
deals with such heavy themes as Jesus, war, and death? During and after I
viewed The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc I got very depressed. The movie
was neither enjoyable nor good, even in the historical epic sense. I think it's
unfair that Columbia did not pass out doses of Prozac for free with each
rental. While this movie is forgettable in an instant, it would really help
someone heal emotionally from this awful film going experience.
Joan (Jovovich) is a peasant girl who has been very religious her entire life.
At a young age she begins to receive messages from whom she believes to be God.
Only later is his message clear. Convinced God wants her to save France from
England during the Hundred Years War, she proceeds to the capitol to ask
Charles the Dauphin (Malkovich) for an army. She tells him he will soon become
king of France. So Charles gives her an army that days later goes into battle
under her command. Soon after this battle, Charles does gets crowned king, and
doesn't need Joan anymore. She's later captured by the Burgundians who put her
to trial in England. Then a new character appears, The Conscience. Dustin
Hoffman is Joan's conscience who gets her convinced that her actions derive
from madness and not from God. If you paid any attention at all in history
class, you can guess how the movie ends.
I'm never a fan of really gritty films and this is certainly one of the them.
The violence is outrageously graphic and it's supposed to show the pain and
suffering of the armymen. The film succeeds brilliantly at this. The whole
movie is a violent, depressing, lifeless, and unoriginal lump. It is however
one that does a good job of not seeming that long. Modern war movies are
traditionally long and this is no exception. The time seemed to fly by until
the seventy minute mark when the film came to a grinding halt for me. Several
times I thought of turning it off, but I hanged onto the hope that it might get
a bit better. I was wrong. Laughably bad acting is present everywhere. Milla
Jovovich cannot act and is best suited to her smaller, more flashy, less line
role in Besson's great last film The Fifth Element. John Malkovich (Is he the
same actor who was so good as himself in Being John Malkovich?) is surprisingly
horrid, Faye Dunaway does nothing but show off medieval headpieces, and Dustin
Hoffman is unforgivable. While the text at the beginning of the film is way too
small to read on a television screen, if I could have read it, I wished it
would have said the following warning:
Save yourself! Save yourself! Jump off a building! Run your nails down a
blackboard! Hit yourself over the head with a frying pan! Do anything to get
away from this movie!

Review for Pitch Black (2000)
The entire science fiction genre has been beaten to death again and again and
again. There's nowhere to go with this type of movie, except head into the
direction of The Matrix, one of the few movies that has breathed life into this
flailing category for many years. However, some recent films made too early to
be influenced by The Matrix are still sticking to the formula. Witness the
disaster that was Supernova. But when a film like Pitch Black comes along, that
has just enough (and for this type of movie that's barely a drop) of
originality to fuel it off the ground it makes you feel that sometimes, just
rarely, they can get it right. They've obviously been paying attention to the
movies of the past. While this still does feel like yet another version of
Alien (how can a sci-fi movie today not try to be?) it manages to break free
from the mold.
Fry (Mitchell) is forced to crash land a spaceship on a deserted planet. Almost
everyone on the passenger ship dies, but some are awakened from cryogenic
slumber. These handful set foot on a desert-like planet which they later
discover has three different suns. They also discover an alarmingly high amount
of bodies hidden in the basement of a sealed building. When one of the
passengers is attacked by something hidden beneath the planet's surface they
fear the worst. Especially when they find out that a triple eclipse in going to
occur, spreading the planet with "pitch black" darkness.
Strange, bony, and silver evil bat-like things come crawling, swooping, and
lurking in the night to feed on human blood. They have one weakness, light
makes their skin dissolve. There are other dangers as well. The film's most fun
twist is the extremely muscular Riddick (An awesome Diesel, who looks to be one
of our major upcoming actors) he was a murderer imprisoned on the ship, and now
he's free to join the group of survivors. He shaves his head with a huge knife
and plays mind games with some of the crew. He also possesses a special talent
which will aid to the group's survival. Fry and Riddick take command to try and
save themselves and others from the monsters. Should Riddick be trusted? Is he
just trying to save himself? Is he more dangerous than what's attacking them?
These questions keep the film alive for it's second half.
There are several ideas in this movie that I found very interesting. The first
had to be the beginning of the film which was shot obviously by hand and is
very jerky, making the process of the crash more exciting. The second must go
to the idea of placing different color filters on the camera while each
different sun on the planet is up. In the first thirty minutes or so, we are
treated to the entire movie in an orange tint or a blue one. Kudos to the
casting director as well, Vin Diesel is perfectly cast, as is Radha Mitchell.
Though well cast, the acting is what you would expect for a sci-fi movie. There
isn't much Oscar stuff here, but Diesel gives it a surprising amount of effort.
The bad acting isn't entirely the actor's fault though. Of the ten remaining
people on the planet, we only get to know about three of them. The amazingly
underdeveloped other seven characters we never really know anything about, and
that makes us care less about who makes a stupid mistake, and is eaten to death
by the creatures of the night. This greatly impairs the building of tension
that the movie tries so hard for near the end. Speaking of those creatures,
they look pretty cool themselves. While it's rare that we ever get a full on
glance of them (that helps the film keep it's excitement) the brief glimpses we
get to see are pretty cool. Writer's block is apparent in snippets of the film.
There is an awfully slow middle where nothing really happens, and the ending is
kind of abrupt. But it doesn't take away from the entire experience. Obviously
a male film, despite the amazing lack of nudity, and most of the time cleavage.
Of the seventy or so people at my screening no more than five of the attendees
were women. But this picture would be most enjoyable for anyone who's looking
for some cheese. This is one to see in the theaters, as a video experience will
take away much of the mood and atmosphere of the movie. But this is not an epic
film (or an entirely good one), so please, take my advice, go to a matinee.

Review for Ressources humaines (1999)
Director: Laurent Cantet
Writers: Laurent Cantet, Gilles Marchand
Cast: Jalil Lespert, Jean-Claude Vallod, Chantal Barre
Not Rated, 100 minutes
Some areas of the earth are just naturally bleak. These places where color 
seems nonexistent and life is pretty much the boring same are a favorite 
setting for movies, especially for the French. A place like this is the 
perfect environment for which to talk for an entire picture. This seems to be 
Laurent Cantet's idea for a perfect production. The location of "Human 
Resources" is most certainly less than cheerful, as is life for the people 
there. The provincial town has a few dejected joys, but activity mainly 
centers around a factory in town. The factory is one of many that some giant 
corporation has in towns like these, but something radical is about to 
happen. 
Franck (Jalil Lespert) returns from studying business in Paris to this place 
of doom. His father (Jean-Claude Vallod) has been working at the local 
factory, that puts workers under very harsh conditions, for thirty years. 
Franck takes an internship there in the human resources department. Here he 
learns the darker side of the establishment, and how poorly upper management 
treats employees. When Franck puts together a survey asking for the opinions 
of lowly personnel, it's twisted by the boss into something negative for the 
slaves of mechanism oppression. So Franck and a union leader must stand up 
for the rights of the working townspeople, while Franck himself must work out 
some issues with his estranged father. 
Using non-professionals, Cantet has created an intelligent work of 
simplicity. At times it seems better suited as a play, it's that much of an 
actor's piece. With the obvious lack of lighting and technicals, the film 
even teeters into Dogme 95 territory. The camera work is quick, plain, and 
clean, and the script's the obvious leader here. With excellent pace, it 
provides room for some comfortable improvisation, and has a clear goal. Most 
importantly, it knows when it's about to become boring. Kudos go to director 
Cantet and Gilles Marchand for this great screenplay.
When the camera first sees Franck's father working away at his station, the 
work seems OK. He puts a small nut onto a large piece of metal that gets 
welded on a revolving machine. It was only until I realized he had been 
performing this task for the last thirty years did any of the movie sink in. 
This measly operation, and small others, were all a large group of people had 
to do for their entire lives. They have no fun family get-togethers, and no 
wild drinking parties. The very existence of life rises and falls with the 
machine. Life in the offices is no better. Nearly every wall in the building 
is glass to eliminate privacy and increase productivity. Someone is always 
watching.
When right to work gets taken away, there is nothing to fill the void. 
Mistreatment and corruption squandered; the message of "Human Resources" is 
loud and clear. People are aimless and without purpose when they have no 
work, and when unions get bypassed, there is nowhere to turn. Continuing in a 
universal cycle, this happens all over the world. Only when that realization 
comes to pass does this wonderful, important, and depressing film blare all 
with an unflinching certainty. Not one moment seems fake or unreal. This is 
an actual family with real problems, and there are no actors. That is truly 
the mark of quality.

Title
Review for Aladdin (1992)
Watching the same film as a child, and then watching it again when you’re
older is a totally different experience. I can’t tell you how many times
I’ve watched this film when I was 6 or 7, but the grand total has to be
somewhere between 30 or 40. Aladdin was another warped Disney fairytale that
has been brought to life with great songs, flashy animation and effects, and
lots of funny characters and gags. This is one of the finer examples of Disney
animation because it was made during the golden age. In my opinion the golden
age started in 1991, when Beauty and the Beast premiered, to 1994 when The Lion
King came out. I think this is when Disney’s animators where releasing their
finest work. I can officially say that I now know all of the words that
confused me as a child, and have a new appreciation for this classic
children’s film. 
Aladdin is a street rat in the city of Agrabah who has a pet monkey named Abu.
He dreams of becoming rich and living in a beautiful palace, much like that of
the sultan’s. Princess Jasmine (the first Disney character in the long line
of female heroines to have jet black hair) is legally contracted to marry a
prince by the age of 21. She refuses all suitors because if she marries, she
wants to marry for love. When Jasmine runs away from the palace to discover
life on her own, and the two of them meet, they instantly fall in love. Then
the sultan’s evil chief advisor named Jafar kidnaps Aladdin because he’s
the only one who can enter a cave where a magic lamp has been for millions of
years. When Aladdin goes in after it, the cave collapses on itself and Abu and
Aladdin are trapped inside with a magic flying carpet.
That all changes when he rubs the lamp he was supposed to retrieve, instantly
the crazy blue genie (Robin Williams at his best) pops out and tells him he has
three wishes. Aladdin wishes to be a prince so he can win over the heart of
Jasmine, but this gets in the way of Jafar’s plan to become sultan. Will the
genie earn his freedom? Will Jafar take over the kingdom? Will Aladdin’s true
identity be revealed to Jasmine and the rest of the kingdom? These are all
questions that will be answered, even if your child may not get the main plot
of the movie.
This is Disney at it’s best. Williams comes up with several very funny bits
(transforming into Groucho Marx, Jack Nicholson, and Julius Caesar, among
others) that make the film different from typical Disney fair. The songs are
also very well written, and the animation the accompanies them is very fitting
to the lyrics of the song. Your child’s favorite will probably be Abu or Iago
(Jafar’s parrot) but almost all of the characters are instantly likable. The
plot does have some problems (Whatever happened to the narrator? Why is the
sultan so dumb?) but they will either be unnoticed or just barely recognized by
you or any of your kids. The ending is a bit abrupt, but I still think that
this is a great film for your entire family to watch again and again. I think
that they should re-release it for its 10 year anniversary in 2002 for
generations to come. Wacky, fun, and great animation are what Aladdin is all
about, so this Disney classic gets *** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: Jafar turns into a scary snake and there are lots of Arabian
belly-dancers. Otherwise, the film is aimed right at the kiddies and they
should enjoy it. Good Age: 3 & Up

Review for Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, The (1999)
The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland (G) ***
Starring Mandy Patinkin, Vanessa L. Williams
Directed by Gary Halvorson
A Review by Frankie Paiva
Everyone in the world must be avoiding the good children’s movies. If the
failure of The Iron Giant, a terrific film about the relationship between a boy
and his pet robot wasn’t proof than the flop that Columbia Pictures
experienced with this should be proof enough. After Muppets From Space bombed,
and The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland didn’t do that well, all of us are
left to wonder what is to become of Sesame Street and the Muppets which many of
us have grown up with and still love and adore. At least this film stays true
to it’s original formula, Elmo is aimed 100% directly, on target at kids.
This isn’t to say it’s like the recent Rugrats movie, a huge success that
sickened parents, this one will actually (gasp) have the adults in the audience
having fun with their children. Plus the interaction with the audience (much
like that of the enormously popular Blues Clues) helps to form a bond between
movie and audience. This is a fun family film and I’m glad to give you this
review.
Elmo loves and adores his fuzzy blue blanket more than anything in the world.
He loves it so much he doesn’t want to share it with his friend Zoe, while
they are in a struggle over who gets the blanket, it gets caught by a blast of
wind and flies through the air, eventually landing in Oscar’s garbage can.
When Elmo goes to retrieve it, he and the blanket are sucked into a vortex that
magically sends them to Grouchland, a place where everything yucky and smelly
reigns supreme.
In Grouchland there is an evil person named Huxley (Patinkin) who steals
everything he can from all of the people who live in the area. However, no one
in Grouchland is willing to do anything about it because working together to do
anything is considered bad. Grouchland is basically the opposite of everything
they teach you on Sesame Street. When good-hearted Elmo discovers Huxley has
his blanket, he immediately goes to his dreaded castle to retrieve it. But not
without being sidetracked and chased by the evil villain’s henchmen. 
All of the characters you know and love make an appearance hear. Even classic
cast members Bob McGrath and Sonia Manzano make an appearance. Vanessa L.
Williams does a musical number as the Queen of Trash, her song, which is all
about how beauty is everywhere, it just depends on your point of view, eerily
sums up the message of American Beauty. But it’s really Bert and Ernie that
steal the show. Everytime a major point of action occurs Ernie is there to tell
the frightened Bert (and perhaps audience) that everything is going to be OK. I
really enjoyed watching The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, even though I am
12. The makers of the film stuck with the original Street formula and didn’t
screw it up at all (even if the songs sounds a little like those of The Lion
King.) If you’re looking for a fun family film that the whole family will
like, take the kiddies to see The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, which gets
*** stars.
The Young-Uns: The film is aimed directly as young ones and has no
objectionable content. Good For All Ages

Review for Knight's Tale, A (2001)
Just avoid it. It's that simple. `A Knight's Tale' is a new medieval jousting
comedy/drama that molds itself into whatever the story requires, with little
regard for plausibility, time, reason, or feeling. The movie is like a young
child that's just discovered clay. It is juvenile, and severely lacking in form,
content, and consistency.
That said, Heath Ledger is awfully good as William Thatcher, a squire who takes
over his dead master's position in of-noble-blood-only jousting matches across
Europe. William has trained since childhood, and has the skills and sheer gut
for competition. He just needs some practice. As he rises to prominence, he
gains a rival (Rufus Sewell), and goes after the heart of a fair maiden (Shannyn
Sossamon). Also showing up are two annoying actors, Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk as
`humorous' sidekicks. 
The film opens with a crowd of bloodthirsty jousting patrons hungrily awaiting
carnage, and simultaneously clapping and singing along with Queen's `We Will
Rock You'. The modern rock hit fun continues throughout, with Thin Lizzy, David
Bowie, and Heart eventually getting in on the action. The scoring gives the film
a modern effect it doesn't need. Just when writer/director Brian Helgeland
manages to get his production back on track, he derails with another song. Let's
give them Eric Clapton and sword fighting! No! Let's do Robbie Williams and
medieval slaughter!
It doesn't help that jousting really isn't that exciting, and Helgeland doesn't
attempt to make it so. He does, at least, explain the rules of the game, which
are helpful to the non-history-oriented, but to this 21st-century eye, the game
just comes off as silly. Thousands of years from now, I'm sure the creatures
living on Earth will think the same thing of beach volleyball.
After supporting roles in two other Columbia productions, `10 Things I Hate
About You' and `The Patriot', Heath Ledger gets his first starring role. He does
his best, and brings a mix of boyish charm and ruggedness often associated with
the likes of Matt Damon or fellow countryman Russell Crowe. The other
performances are passable, never quite meeting satisfactory.
`A Knight's Tale' tries desperately to be a younger, hipper version of
`Gladiator', and it fails. It doesn't matter that the story veers nowhere, and
the supporting actors need medical help, but that Helgeland has no, even vague,
point to this whole mess. Add that the film is almost never entertaining or
funny, and its quality, even as airplane entertainment, becomes highly
questionable.
But what about Heath Ledger, the smiling, good-looking Australian star? Well, he
has better things ahead of him, hopefully. He's talented, and gives this summer
movie masses of deceiving credibility. Better luck next time.

Review for East Is East (1999)
Culture clash, you aren't human if you haven't experienced it. For members of 
the Khan family it's the regular routine. Dad George, (Puri) believes that 
even though his children are of mixed Pakistani and English descent, that 
they will follow every rule and traditional custom as if they were living in 
Pakistan. This is very hard to enforce, because it's the early 1970s, his 
family lives in a Manchester suburb, and six of his seven children want 
little to do with him or Pakistan. Maneer Khan is the son George wishes the 
other five boys were. A traditional Muslim, he sees his fathers ways as a 
sanctuary from pop culture. While not as religious as Maneer, Abdul Khan is 
another good son. He's very prim, always showing up in a suit, and says very 
little. Saleem Khan is an aspiring sculptor who tricks his dad into thinking 
he's going to college to become an engineer. Tariq Kahn is the rebellious 
badboy who is dating the dimwitted girl next door and frequently attends the 
forbidden discos. Sajid Khan is the youngest Khan who just got circumcised, 
and always wears a parka no matter what the weather is like. Meenah Khan, the 
only girl in the family, and she loves to play soccer on the streets. 
Finally, their mother Ella Khan (Bassett) loves her husband, but also wants 
the children to have lives of their own. There is actually one more Khan 
named Nazir. George arranged a traditional Pakistani marriage for the boy 
(where both the bride and the groom have not met until the ceremony takes 
place) who runs from the altar and disgraces the family. George forces the 
family to refer to Nazir as "dead."
This unique bunch could produce a bounty of humor, and at times it does. A 
lot of this movie is very, very funny. However, it is also very, very sad. 
George is so set in Pakistani ways that he frequently beats his wife and 
children when they disobey him or Pakistan. He spouts off insults, calling 
them illegitimate children, female dogs, etc. In today's times he would get 
sent to jail instantly. Georges actions detract from the film because editing 
is not this movie's greatest marvel. A scene of George continuously beating 
his wife is put in between two funny scenes involving the sexual preference 
of Nazir. One thing I absolutely will not forget about this movie though, are 
the two brides George tries to set Abdul and Tariq up with late in the film. 
There is no real way to describe them, they have no actual lines, but they 
alone are worth the price of admission. Performances are very good in this 
movie. Om Puri and Linda Bassett are effective in both the dramatic and 
comedic sequences. All the Khan children are excellent as well. Bit players 
also make up a large part of the movie. A young woman in love with Saleem, an 
anxious dalmation, and a little boy who is Sajids friend are all memorable. 
If you listen very closely to the last few lines of the movie, I bet you'll 
be rolling in the aisles. While the film tries to leave you with a humorous 
intention, that still doesn't overshadow the domestic abuse subplot. The 
movie got too disjointed between the two for my tastes, and I left the 
theater thinking the movie was just OK. My opinion later changed to a 
slightly more positive one, but it's still only enough to mildly recommend 
this movie. So is this, "A comedy with attitude from a house with no 
latitude?" The film's tagline promises us that, but it's far from the truth. 
Despite great performances from a relatively unknown cast, and some very 
funny material, East Is East is much better off as the comedy the posters 
promote, not the drama that lies beneath.

Title
Review for Wild Wild West (1999)
Imagine putting both Addams family movies together, adding a heap of sexual
innuendo, and placing the effects of Men in Black on top of it. Now imagine
taking the dry wit out of all these movies, adding an extreme amount of
violence, ethnical slurs, and push-up bras. 
Wild Wild West, a new creation of Barry Sonnenfeld, director of Get Shorty and
Men in Black tries to make it work...it doesn't. Exactly whose fault it is is
yet to be determined, so let me just give you an outline. 
James West (Smith, who still fits the superhero role nicely, but he's horribly
miscast) is teamed up with effects specialist Artemus Gordon (Kline, who puts
on that fancy-pants know-it-all thing that worked in In & Out, but not here) to
save president Grant from an 80-foot tarantula created by Arliss Loveless
(Kenneth Branagh, who, I'm ashamed to say, should stick with Helena Bonham
Carter and Shakespeare) he's using to take over the entire US government
turning the Northwest into Loveliss Land. 
Now this could be an original premise, but the film is so darned contrived that
you know Will Smith will win in the end. Whereas, Arlington Road (a better
action/paranoia thriller by about, oh, ** or *** stars) had a suprising
explosive ending that you couldn't see coming until the very end, this one's
obvious at about the 30-minute point.
I believe that the filmmakers realized this, so they decided to make the film
more fun by adding cool gadgets, heaps of jokes about breasts, tons of violence
(an extreme amount for a PG-13 movie) and racial and ethnic slurs that sound
like their coming from episodes of Jerry Springer and American History X. 
This film is not for children and parents should be very cautious about taking
them to it. I actually believe that a child would benefit much more from seeing
South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, Arlington Road, or maybe even American
Pie. Thus, I give Wild Wild West (the worst movie of the year so far along with
Virus) * 1/2 stars.

Title
Review for Castle, The (1997/I)
Are you a fan of those little English comedies that are filled with good humor,
charming characters, and interesting plotlines? Well this movie has it all for
you...the sweet, innocent Kerrigan family who resides next to the local airport
is being evicted. The airport wants to expand, but dad Darryl (Caton) isn't
willing to give up without a fight.
He hires Dennis Denuto (Tiriel Mora, one of those people with a familiar face
that you swear you've seen before) a sort of divorce lawyer to handle the case
for him and bring it to court. Dennis is not exactly the world's best lawyer
and loses the case when the judge asks him what his legal documents behind his
accusations are, he replies The Constitution, all of it. 
The film is filled with all kinds of these sweet characters, loving, naive
people who react and take action without influence from the outside world.
While I will admit the film is funny (certainly not like or as much as Waking
Ned Devine which recently was released on video) and the running time is short,
(so as the Kerrigan's quirkiness does not lose it's appeal) I can't really
figure out how much I liked this film, but it made me feel good walking out of
the theater, and for that I give it ** 1/2 stars.

Title
Review for Chicken Run (2000)
In the tradition of Toy Story 2, Chicken Run is an animated movie for anyone 
and everyone. Not only do sharp wit, droll one-liners, and hidden inside 
jokes get marvelously packaged into one, Chicken Run is also a remarkable 
looking film. This is one of the few films made with stop motion animation, 
more commonly known as claymation. Veteran animation studio Aardman 
Animations, who created all three of the Wallace and Gromit shorts as well as 
the Academy Award winning short Creature Comforts is behind this movie. 
Director and Aardman head Nick Park (director of the three Wallace and Gromit 
shorts) brings the animals to life. The screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick does 
borrow heavily from several claymation and computer animated movies, but is 
full of brilliant humor. There is a perfect balance of jokes for adults and 
kids, and it's likely to please both audiences. 
Ginger is the ambitious leader of a group of hens. She focuses on getting the 
entire group out of Mrs. Tweedy's egg farm. Mrs. Tweedy is an evil individual 
with a dim-witted husband who always believes the chickens are organizing an 
escape. She ignores her spouse, and often gets angry with him and the 
minuscule profits she's making on the farm. Seeking more money, she orders a 
chicken pie machine and begins to fatten up the chickens. There may be hope 
for the chickens in their time of need though. Rocky the Rooster is a flying 
chicken from the circus. Through several misunderstandings and lies the hens 
believe he can teach them how to fly the coop, so to speak. In actuality, 
Rocky flies because he gets shot out of a cannon. However, he soon has the 
hens doing flying exercises and tries to get them to take off in the air. How 
much longer can he keep up the charade without the others finding out, before 
they all end up as pies?
The comic actions of these chickens as they deploy their genius escape plans 
are ineffable. Chicken Run is really a wonder to behold, a movie you really 
have to see for yourself. The jokes are that funny and unexpected. One of my 
favorite lines occurs when Rocky first meets the hens and tells them he's 
from America, the land of the free. This prompts Mac, the scientific and 
brainy chicken to say, "You mean Scotland!" Another highlight is a 
half-witted hen who views laying several eggs a day only to get killed later 
as a living. There's also two hilarious rats that try to sell a variety of 
small items (like a set of thimbles as a tea set or a shuttlecock as a 
two-way hat) to the flock. All the voices are excellent. Mel Gibson plays the 
perfect womanizing rooster, and Julia Sawalha and Lynn Ferguson are energetic 
and exciting in their roles.
For all of the little touches in Chicken Run, the main plot is rather 
derivative. Elements from all three Wallace and Gromit shorts appear. Another 
large chunk of this movie seems to be from the 1998 computer animated feature 
A Bug's Life. Many movies get spoofed, but just as many movies get copied 
from. The familiarity felt with scenes like Rocky and Ginger getting caught 
in the chicken pie machine (similar to Wallace and Gromit getting caught in a 
dog food machine) hurt my overall enjoyment of the movie. It felt like I'd 
seen this material before. A feeling not felt throughout the rest of the 
movie.
Every chicken in this movie acts like a human, that's one of its many charms. 
You will find people you know resembling these characters. Despite the human 
resemblance, the chickens are never stereotypes of human characters seen in 
other movies. This is a movie intended to get taken lightly. Never before has 
any animated movie kept me needing more like this one has. Chicken Run is 
pure fun that will delight all ages. The crazy antics are unparalleled from 
any other comedy this year. 
Will we be seeing a Chicken Run 2 in the near future? I sure hope so.

Title
Review for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001)
There's an unwritten screenwriting rule that you should never write about your
own life because people aren't interested. Luckily, Cameron Crowe completely
ignored this idea. Unfortunately, Kevin Smith did not. `Jay and Silent Bob
Strike Back' is the world's biggest in-joke, a culmination to Smith's last four
pictures, `Clerks', `Mallrats', `Chasing Amy', and `Dogma'. It is a satire that
constantly winks at the audience, but leaves it's funniest moments to subtlety
The film doesn't work on an intelligent level unless you've seen the above four
films, and know all about Kevin Smith's battles (bumping heads with `Magnolia'
director Paul Thomas Anderson, ABC airing his TV show only for legal reasons) as
an independent filmmaker. It's a pretty big assumption that we want to get
involved with his ego, but Smith takes us there anyway. It makes for sheer
brilliance hiding under a whole lot of mediocrity. 
The plot, so to speak, follows Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob's (Smith) road
trip from Jersey to Hollywood. They're trying to stop Hollywood from making a
movie for which they are obviously the source material. (If that isn't irony,
what is?) Along the way, they get involved with some very attractive `animal
activists' who aren't who they appear to be, Jay falls in love, and joints are
passed. 
A wide variety of celebrities make cameo appearances in the film, mostly
spoofing themselves. Carrie Fisher, George Carlin, Jason Biggs, Shannon Doherty,
Chris Rock, Matt Damon, and  James Van Der Beek are just a few of the many
surprises. Ben Affleck (looking quite dazed), Shannon Elizabeth, and Will
Ferrell are all effective in small roles. 
One must really wonder what type of audience Smith was trying to reach with this
film. There's no future for this production as a film, since the references are
far too current to last more than a year or two, and the stupid humor wasn't
appealing because the film has a bitter core. The film is largely a cleverly
disguised tirade about the studio system. It hits many things on the mark, but
there isn't the same endearing quality that `Dude, Where's My Car?' or `American
Pie' have. We simply don't care about the characters.
Sadly, the film aims its crosshairs on places other than Hollywood. A large
majority of the humor is homophobic, and would be quite degrading and offensive
to anyone with an open mind, Smith's usual crowd. Whether the jokes are meant to
be taken seriously (as religious groups joke the jokes in `Dogma'), is in
question, but there's just too much negative material to ignore. Then there's
the humor that's just plain stupid, overdone, and unfunny.
But for all the bad jokes, there are some great ones. I laughed uncontrollably
around ten times, mostly at places where the rest of the audience didn't. 
When Silent Bob finally talks in the second half of the movie, the audience at
my screening cheered. It was a Marcel Marceau in `Silent Movie' for the
generation of 2001. 
Smith can do better. Don't see the movie if you don't know all about him, or
don't see many movies. You'll just be presented with some rather vulgar humor,
and there are better movies for that. For those more film-inclined, it's an
exclusive party, but a lame one at that.

Review for Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999)
The Thomas Crown Affair cannot escape. There will be a countless amount of
people that will compare it to the old original and say, wow, that was so much
better. There will also be people that compare to it the recent Entrapment and
say, wow, it's so much better than that stupid. insepid piece of trash. And
that's where The Thomas Crown Affair falls, right about in the middle. While
much more plausible and slick than Entrapment, it fails to have that classic
crime caper feel the original had.
The rich Thomas Crown (Brosnan who's character is basically Bond without the
gunfire) enjoys the breathtaking thrill of stealing. He steals a $100 million
dollar Monet in a very slick and sophisticated way, using a method of
distraction. But Catherine, (Russo who can still strut her stuff) an insurance
investigator, knows he did it. She begins to investigate the case and finds
herself falling in love.
So begins an erotic game of cat and mouse. The bond between Catherine and
Brosnan begins to form and her love for him goes beyond getting the back the
painting. While the chemistry is good, I really didn't think that most of this
stuff could have happened, but this is a highly-styleized (I really hope that
is an actual word and that I spelled it correctly) Hollywood film, so you won't
notice anyway. 
Add in some stunning clothing and you've got The Thomas Crown Affair. Much like
Entrapment, but with more sex (also, a wonderful thing, the two main characters
are actually each other's age!) and romance. It's also a bit slow and features
an annoying Denis Leary character, and topless scenes. But it's still not as
good as the original. But I still think that you would like this fun
crime/romance story that gets *** stars
The Young-Uns: This film contains two sex scenes and three scenes where Rene
Russo appears topless. While none of them are explicit, I'd say the good age is
around 13 or 14.

Review for Being John Malkovich (1999)
Over the past couple of months there have been many comedies that poke fun at
movies, Hollywood, and celebrities. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut was a
brilliant satire on the MPAA and how movies affect our children. The Muse was a
great comedy about a writer losing inspiration to write in the rough town
called Hollywood. Finally, Bowfinger was a movie all about a group of people
trying to make it big in Hollywood by putting a big star in their film. None of
these films go anywhere near the fun that is Being John Malkovich. Throughout
the film one can’t help wondering how writer Charlie Kaufman came up with
these endless plot twists and classic funny moments. Finally we have been shown
a movie that makes fun of the celebrities that we know and love.
Craig Schwartz (Cusack escaping his usual cute boyishness type of role) is an
out of work puppeteer who’s desperately failing in his career. So he decides
to take a job filing at Lestercorp, a company that is on the 7 1/2 floor of a
local office building. All of the ceilings where he works are only 5 feet high.
The owner of the company, Dr. Lester (Orson Bean) thinks he has a speech
problem and that no one can hear him. Because of this, he always seems to be
telling everyone his sexual fantasies in gory, graphic detail. The biggest
surprise of them all is yet to come.
Do you know who John Malkovich is? Some people don't, some people do. John
Malkovich is the popular actor who has appeared in several films including Con
Air, In The Line of Fire, and Dangerous Liaisons. He also certainly didn’t
star in a movie in which he was an art thief. (Inside joke that you will get
after seeing the movie.) What does this have to do with the movie you ask? Read
on...When Craig moves a file cabinet out from the wall to pick up something he
dropped he discovers a small wooden door. If you open the door, and crawl down
a long dark brain-like cave you will become John Malkovich for 15 minutes at a
time. Then you are dropped from the sky into a ditch on the side of the New
Jersey turnpike. Seeing this as a way to get a bitchy co-worker (Catherine
Keener) who absolutely detests him, to like him, he shows his secret to her.
Craig doesn't seem at all troubled about his attraction to her because he's
beginning to think that his wife loves animals more than she loves him. 
I can only set up the basic plot because I want you to go and see this
masterpiece for our time on your own. In fact, you must go now to the theater
and see this film precisely after you read this review. That is not a
suggestion, that is a command. Diaz is great (I love her frizzy hair) as the
confused wife who is having questions about her sexual identity. Catherine
Keener is also funny playing a character somewhat like Karen from the
television show Will & Grace. The real standout though is John Malkovich
himself, not only is the fact that he agreed to do this amazing he takes on the
different aspects of the people inside of him very well. This is an amazing
experience that cannot possibly be described in any shape way or form. So stop
listening to me, go to the theater now and see the most original film of the
year, and certainly one that will make my top ten list. The masterpiece Being
John Malkovich gets **** stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains two sex scenes, (nothing extremely explicit)
countless sexual references and some language. Good Age 14 & Up

Title
Review for Skulls, The (2000)
What's the quickest way to sink a movie? You could give Craig T. Nelson 
awkward, burly facial hair for one. Yet there are faster ways. Efficiently 
emulating John Pogue's tedious script for the latest insipid work of Neal H. 
Moritz and company would work. Moritz's production crew brought you last 
year's infamous "Cruel Intentions". Both share ridiculous premises and 
unsatisfying conclusions. What else is there to say? The focus of intrigue 
shifts from rampant sex in this one, and there's no Sarah Michelle Gellar or 
Ryan Phillippe to somewhat save things. Despite cute smiles, Joshua Jackson 
and Paul Walker do not carry this movie, and with the job going to incapable 
supporting actors and director, it's an endless 106-minute work of continuing 
stupidity and boredom. 
Rather than treat these "characters" with actual human names very much 
contrary to their fake emotions, names will not be included in this summary.
An annoyingly ambitious high school guy (Joshua Jackson) meets a gym-head 
boxer from a prestigious family (Paul Walker) at a famous university. 
Punching Bag's father (Craig T. Nelson) is the head of a campus secret 
society called the Skulls, which provides seemingly limitless opportunities 
for its exclusive pick of members. It's the country's largest male clique. 
After some luck in bizarre initiation ceremonies, Red Gloves and Irksome 
Scholar become best friends and even "skull-mates". Oh yes, skull-mates. 
Together they reap benefits of membership which include, but are not limited 
to sports cars, blank checks, rising grades, and bevies of whores. Somehow, 
no young dumb character figures out that heaps of dirty dealings are going on 
behind the scenes. Only when a close friend is murdered do the duo and other 
new Skulls come to their senses and wonder about the group's moral 
activities. Danger engulfs the friends. Will one man honor his father and the 
club, or his friend? Will the other stick with the popular people, or obey 
his conscience? Is there any escape from this dreadful plot?
Director Rob Cohen could have saved half of this with a simple, shameless 
exploitation of his main actors. A cheerfully bad Hollywood teen sex escapade 
hadn't happened since, well, "Cruel Intentions". The actors serve as nothing 
more than eye candy (with "Popular's" Leslie Bibb filling the brainless 
female role) since the actors have miniscule talents. The lengths to keep 
this PG-13 get annoying. Then again, a more adult version of "Skulls" would 
completely lose its target audience. This is the perfect video pick for that 
plucky teenage girl whose brain has received long-term abuse from abrasive 
foreign lip-glosses that you know. No other group of thinking, breathing 
human beings should give wide praise for this thing. Unless they, of course, 
are under the influence of some illegal substance smuggled across the border. 
An example of possible adult praise: "Wow! That suggestively sweaty young man 
looks positively like he's reading a cue card." And that's trying hard.
Does this seem a little mean-spirited? Well then it's accurate. With 
skull-banging inane dialogue, vapid performances, plodding pace, and stark 
predictability this is easily the stinker of the season. It leaves a mood of 
disappointment, because like most bad movies, it could have been great. This 
piece triggers much anger from within for the California film gods. A movie 
is all in the execution, as most know. Too bad someone didn't kill this one 
in time. 
One almost expects Gillian Anderson's character from "The X-Files" to show up 
as a bad pun, but alas, no. Christopher McDonald does show up for added pain 
in viewing though.

Review for Twilight (1998)
"Doesn't it bother you that people like Catherine Hayward and Jack Ames can
prance right through life with everyone else, guys like you and me left to pick
up the pieces?" Asks Raymond Hope (James Garner) to Harry Ross. (Newman) They
are discussing Susan Sarandon and Gene Hackman and the sudden disappearance of
Susan's former husband in Twilight, a supposed nostalgic piece of the old 40s
crime dramas. Yes it bothers me! Especially since the audience is asked to pick
up the pieces of this horrible modernized detective story.
Harry is being interviewed about his past in a jail cell, he begins to tell the
tale of how we got involved with the Ames family. He was referred by Raymond
just after his alcoholism destroyed his life. This begins is a mindless chase
over a $10,000 payment of something that happened in Mexico that's full of
stereotypical characters and bad acting to reach a final conclusion. The actual
parts of the film that lead to the finale (if you can even call it that) take
no more than ten or fifteen minutes.
So, what else is offered to make this a 96 minute movie you ask. The nostalgia
forties piece gets a modern dose of sex and violence. For instance, Stockard
Channing is the only female character, whose breasts, we do not see! James
Garner is the only one not having sex. And Gene Hackman is the only person who
hasn't shot anyone! If this sounds like a piece of filth, it is. 
The use of Gloria as a subplot is also a very weak excuse to pile on the
violence. Even when she clubs him over the head, puts a gun to his face, and
later tries to demand more money and kill him again. A couple of minutes before
she dies (yes I'm giving away the plot, but trust me, you won't care anyway)
she is suddenly made into a complex character with feelings that we are all
supposed to grieve for.
This isn't to mention the fact over overwhelming cheese. Whereas in Dead Men
Don't Wear Plaid (yes that was a comedy but I'm on a roll here) the cheese was
used effectively and the actors were aware of it, this is supposed to come on
as real drama. 
Let me make this review shorter for you: If you enjoy inflicting pain on
yourself, over and over again while constantly swearing and making crude sexual
comments while baring your chest, than this is the film for you. If not, don't
see Twilight, the film gets my * star.

Title
Review for Love Stinks (1999)
Attending Love Stinks more than a month before it actually opens, I am actually
here with my first movie review (imagine me, 12, and seeing a special
screening!) before a movie opens. Luckily, I saw Love Stinks, a film that
reminds us just how funny well-used bathroom humor can be.
Seth Winnick (Stewart, Harry from 3rd Rock From the Sun) is a writer for a new
sitcom called Jesse & Rebecca. He meets Chelsea (Wilson) at his fellow writer's
wedding. Instantly overcome with love he brings to the planetarium to dance
under the stars, and their romance begins. She redecorates his apartment and
makes him get allergy shots to live with her beloved cat, but she soon becomes
more and more controlling. 
But what Chelsea is really after is someone to marry. On Valentine's Day Seth
says he might marry her in a year, and she settles for it. But when I comes
around that time next year, he doesn't propose. She sues him for palimony and
begins ruining his life, he does the same to her. Throwing her cat off a pier
(could that be a inspiration from There's Something About Mary popping up
again?) and inviting over the sexy bimbo she asked him not to cast on his show.
Yes, the film contains a lot of bathroom humor. However, (I am ashamed to say)
that most of it is pretty darn funny. Another nice thing about Love Stinks is
the way that the story is told in flashbacks. Stewart gives a fine performance,
although his character seems very Harry-ized (read 2nd paragraph) and I wonder
if he can do any other types of acting. Also performing well is Tyra Banks, in
her movie debut, she adds a different touch to some of the scenes.
Looking for an intelligent and witty sophisticated film? Not one ounce is to be
found here, but if your just looking to laugh regularly in a darkened theater
for 90 minutes or so, see Love Stinks which gets ** 1/2 stars.

Title
Review for East Is East (1999)
Culture clash, you aren't human if you haven't experienced it. For members of 
the Khan family it's the regular routine. Dad George, (Puri) believes that 
even though his children are of mixed Pakistani and English descent, that 
they will follow every rule and traditional custom as if they were living in 
Pakistan. This is very hard to enforce, because it's the early 1970s, his 
family lives in a Manchester suburb, and six of his seven children want 
little to do with him or Pakistan. Maneer Khan is the son George wishes the 
other five boys were. A traditional Muslim, he sees his fathers ways as a 
sanctuary from pop culture. While not as religious as Maneer, Abdul Khan is 
another good son. He's very prim, always showing up in a suit, and says very 
little. Saleem Khan is an aspiring sculptor who tricks his dad into thinking 
he's going to college to become an engineer. Tariq Kahn is the rebellious 
badboy who is dating the dimwitted girl next door and frequently attends the 
forbidden discos. Sajid Khan is the youngest Khan who just got circumcised, 
and always wears a parka no matter what the weather is like. Meenah Khan, the 
only girl in the family, and she loves to play soccer on the streets. 
Finally, their mother Ella Khan (Bassett) loves her husband, but also wants 
the children to have lives of their own. There is actually one more Khan 
named Nazir. George arranged a traditional Pakistani marriage for the boy 
(where both the bride and the groom have not met until the ceremony takes 
place) who runs from the altar and disgraces the family. George forces the 
family to refer to Nazir as "dead."
This unique bunch could produce a bounty of humor, and at times it does. A 
lot of this movie is very, very funny. However, it is also very, very sad. 
George is so set in Pakistani ways that he frequently beats his wife and 
children when they disobey him or Pakistan. He spouts off insults, calling 
them illegitimate children, female dogs, etc. In today's times he would get 
sent to jail instantly. Georges actions detract from the film because editing 
is not this movie's greatest marvel. A scene of George continuously beating 
his wife is put in between two funny scenes involving the sexual preference 
of Nazir. One thing I absolutely will not forget about this movie though, are 
the two brides George tries to set Abdul and Tariq up with late in the film. 
There is no real way to describe them, they have no actual lines, but they 
alone are worth the price of admission. Performances are very good in this 
movie. Om Puri and Linda Bassett are effective in both the dramatic and 
comedic sequences. All the Khan children are excellent as well. Bit players 
also make up a large part of the movie. A young woman in love with Saleem, an 
anxious dalmation, and a little boy who is Sajids friend are all memorable. 
If you listen very closely to the last few lines of the movie, I bet you'll 
be rolling in the aisles. While the film tries to leave you with a humorous 
intention, that still doesn't overshadow the domestic abuse subplot. The 
movie got too disjointed between the two for my tastes, and I left the 
theater thinking the movie was just OK. My opinion later changed to a 
slightly more positive one, but it's still only enough to mildly recommend 
this movie. So is this, "A comedy with attitude from a house with no 
latitude?" The film's tagline promises us that, but it's far from the truth. 
Despite great performances from a relatively unknown cast, and some very 
funny material, East Is East is much better off as the comedy the posters 
promote, not the drama that lies beneath.

Title
Review for Heartbreakers (2001)
Cleavage goes a long way. It's how a mother-daughter con team consisting of Max
(Sigourney Weaver) and Paige (Jennifer Love Hewitt) get their way with rich men.
Through careful selection, the two move from town to town exploiting innocent
creeps for big moola. Max seduces and marries them. Paige seduces and tempts
them. Soon after comes a large settlement. Their biggest and final challenge
lies ahead in Palm Beach. The two must work fast to reach an IRS deadline, as
Max has been less than prompt with the past eight year's worth of tax returns.
Simultaneously working a near-death, hacking tobacco tycoon (Gene Hackman), and
a young, potentially wealthy beach bar owner (Jason Lee), the duo move toward
the last con, with Paige's need for independence from her wacky mother growing
stronger by the day.
About that cleavage again, there certainly is plenty of it. By the halfway
point, the top halves of both breast sets should be quite familiar to the
audience. So should respective neighbors like the inner thighs and behind. The
flaunting sexuality is for the goggle-eyes of men, but these ladies are in
control of the entire species. It's their own lives where they lose course. They
conquer any obstacle because they are brilliant con-women. It's a hoot to watch
all the different ways Paige and Max will avoid paying for things like a meal or
a hotel stay. Conning is second nature to them, a great way to live life.
`Heartbreakers' is a comedy that's content to browse and poke its nose into
several genres of its pleasing. It doesn't work as the romance it tries to
become, but suits itself as one of the finer situation comedies in recent
memory. The last good-hearted comedy that didn't mock or make fun of its
characters was `Bring it On'. The film evokes just as many laughs with
sophistication, but lacks the same fast-paced editing.
At 123 minutes long, `Heartbreakers' is in major need of a chop down. It isn't
very succinct, and tends to lag. It has a problem with taking too long to set-up
locations and motivations, which doesn't work when it wants to pull the rug from
the audience's feet.
Sigourney and Jennifer are very believable as family. They look nothing like
each other, but their talents fill in the bond. After a long absence, and a very
bad TV movie, Jennifer Love Hewitt shows a high level of skill. Hewitt is often
miscast, despite her gifts. I suggest she have a serious talk with her agent
immediately. Sigourney Weaver shows she still has flair to burn, and that
`Alien: Resurrection' was just a serious case of bad judgment.
You will laugh and have a good time at `Heartbreakers'. It is a very funny movie
with some great scenes, and the actors have a blast with their roles. There
comes, though, when some inconsistency just can't be overlooked. As an example,
gay men and police have apparently no existence in this film's world. 
It's the perfect rental, and a good date movie. See it, smile, and inhale the
feeling of thoughtless fun at the movies. Just don't expect all your needs
fulfilled.
Disclaimer: I may have missed several plot details and jokes in `Heartbreakers'
because this film marks the first time I was physically attacked during a movie.
Isn't life wonderful?

Review for Toy Story 2 (1999)
There has always been a constant battle over whether sequels really have the
potential to become great films that surpass their originals. While not a
sequel, (it was actually a prequel if you wish to get literal), Star Wars -
Episode I: The Phantom Menace didn't even come close to its three originals.
There was no heart, no substance, and no real meaning to anything that went on
in the movie. Not to mention the acting was horrendous. Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me wasn't very good either. It was full of bathroom humor and
extremely stupid gags that were unfunny and distasteful. I think that we should
both agree never to mention I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. But every
once in a while a movie comes along that is not only better than the original,
it surpasses the original film tremendously. The last film that comes to mind
to do this was Scream 2, and the same type of thing has been introduced in Toy
Story 2. In the first movie, they were doing a trial and error picture, seeing
if the audience and the general public would like what the movie had to offer.
Once they learned that they did, the sequel contained even more of the original
material, and a couple of new surprises. When talking about Toy Story 2, the
only word I can come up with is, "Wow!" This is one of the best movies of the
year, is beautifully animated, and (Gasp!) will be enjoyed by all members of
the family. 
Woody is trying to save a dust-filled toy named Wheezy from being sold at the
family garage sale. He accidentally gets stuck in a 25 cents box and is found
by a vintage toy collector who steals him to complete his vintage cowboy
collection. It turns out that Woody used to have his own show in the 1950s. He
was extremely popular and had a numerous amount of merchandise made with his
picture on it. "Iâm a yo-yo! I used to be a yo-yo!" Woody exclaims. But there
is bad news, the entire collection of Woody's Round-Up toys are being sent to a
toy museum in Japan, and Woody doesn't want to leave his home.
So itâs up to Buzz, Rex, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, and Slinky to venture across
town and find him so that he can return home before Andy gets back from his
vacation. They meet various challenges on the way, including Barbie dolls, a
dangerous highway crossing, and a visit to the Al's Toy Barn. Will they get to
Woody on time? Or will he be lost overseas forever?
The geniuses at Pixar have done it again. The animation in the film is
breathtaking. Each frame is brightly colored and vibrant, each new scene
creates a realistic looking setting, and the facial expressions on the toys and
people are amazing. There are plenty of hidden jokes and gags from previous
Pixar productions. Watchful viewers will notice A Bug's Life calendar in Andy's
room, as well as Bug Life toys in the Al's Toy Barn scene. If you've seen A
Bug's Life, or like animation, will be quick to notice that the man who fixes
up Woody is the same man who played chess with himself in the animated short
Geri's Game. Geri's Game was screened last year before A Bug's Life. The script
helps the film greatly, it never ventures far from its original formula, and is
chock full of all of the zany characters that you love. You'll get to see a lot
more of the supporting characters too. Much unlike last year's Babe: Pig in the
City, even when the characters go out for a big adventure, they never lose
their loving heart. Extreme laughter is to be found around the theater from
grandparent to teenager, which is one of the things that makes the film so
special. It's an extremely rare thing to find a film that the entire family can
watch (and all enjoy) together. So go and see Toy Story 2 (which is breaking
box office records) now, you'll love it. This great sequel (I'm ready for a
third one!) gets *** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains just one slightly frightening scene involving
a fight between two characters. Good Age: 2 & Up

Review for Lost Highway (1997)
Lost Highway, the most recent Lynch opus makes it's way into theaters just two
months after Scream, which markets itself as a scary movie. Compared to this,
it's Care Bear fare. 
Saxaphone player Fred Madison (Pullman) and wife Renee (Arquette) start
receiving videotapes of their house, and of them sleeping in bed. They are set
on the front porch, unmarked, showing more every night. This continues until
they receive a video showing Fred killing his wife, who has mysteriously
disappeared. Fred is put in jail, and much to the guard's surprise the next
morning, someone else has replaced him in his cell. 
Mechanic Pete Dayton (Balthazar Getty) is his replacement, and we get to see
the story of him, how he makes a new friend in mob boss (Robert Loggia) who not
only is linked to a guy that makes porn movies (starring Marilyn Manson in a
cameo.) He introduces him to Alice (Arquette again) who strangely looks like
Renee. 
Sound like a soap opera? Not really...the chilling aspect is eyebrowless Robert
Blake (who sort of has this white clown makeup on) who tells Fred that he is at
his house while he is talking to him at a party. Also, the use of silence is
wonderful and had me jumping even when the TV turned on or the phone rang.
The video features a preview for a video all about David Lynch, and it's my
guess that some of the bizarre strangeness of this movie could find explanation
there. But until we find the key to open Lynch-world this is just a weird
violence-high film noir.
ADDITIONAL NOTE: I have been hearing rumors of a rerelease in February of 2000,
if this is true, I highly advise you to go see this film in theater for an even
more chilling experience.

Review for Bowfinger (1999)
Bowfinger can only be compared (since I do love comparing two films with some
of the same plot sequences) with the recent The Muse, which also took a fun
look at the thing that we call Hollywood. But this comedy seems a little duller
than The Muse was, it's more of a spoof on all of those B-movies you see in
that dusty corner of the neighborhood video store.
Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) is a movie producer, he works out of a dump that he
calls Bowfinger International Pictures in the cheap section of Hollywood. When
a member of his troupe of actors comes up with a wonderful action script, (it's
called Chubby Rain, and it's about aliens that come down to Earth to fry us all
to a crisp in the rain, thus making it chubby) but no movie executive will
produce it unless big time action star Kit Ramsey (Murphy) is attached.
So the entire crew just goes up to Kit and says their lines about aliens and
such. This works out perfectly because Kit is paranoid that aliens are coming
to take over the Earth, when they finally drive him over the edge (and into a
mental hospital) they must find someone that looks like him to play the part of
Kit.
Finally, a summer comedy has something that all of the other ones lacked, a
good script. Martin has come up with some of the funniest plot sequences and
one-liners that I've seen in a long time. Topping it off is Heather Graham, she
knows exactly how to get around in Hollywood, and her character makes a
surprise twist in the end. Performances are all great, especially Murphy, Kit
Ramsey talks a mile a minute (much in the same way of Chris Tucker) and it's
really fun to watch what he does with the role. Also making a wonderful turn in
Christine Baranski as a theater veteran that thinks she's a top notch actress.
So if you want to laugh, go see Bowfinger, which gets *** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains some language and passionate make out scenes.

Review for Next Best Thing, The (2000)
How many times have you saw a well-known model or music star try their hand 
at acting? It happens quite often, and usually has disastrous results. Even 
though Madonna has made several film appearances, I still don't find her that 
good of an actress. This picture will probably do nothing to forward her (or 
Rupert Everett's for that matter) acting career. The material presented here 
is just way too soapy and extremely sad to do anything good for the two of 
them, or anything good for the audience.
Abbie (Madonna) is one hip forty year-old chick. She has her own yoga studio, 
friends, and a good life, but she wants more. Her husband Kevin (Michael 
Vartan from Never Been Kissed), is leaving her and she's afraid that she lost 
her only remaining chance to have a baby. Her biological clock is ticking. 
Seeking support and refuge, she spends the night at Robert's (Rupert Everett) 
house, her gay best friend. During a wild night, they consume one too many 
drinks, and the two of them have sex. Abbie discovers that she's pregnant and 
they decide to raise the baby together.
Things go well with their son Sam (Malcolm Stumpf) for several years. Then 
Abbie meets Ben (Bratt), a charming businessman from New York who decides to 
take a yoga class when he gets wrong directions to a gym. He asks her out for 
dinner and while at first Robert seems excited for Abbie, he starts doing all 
he can to sabotage the relationship. Since Abbie and Robert never married, he 
never had legal rights to the child, but when Ben proposes, what does that 
mean for the future of him and Sam?
I have divided this film into two halves. The film changes pace very quickly, 
just when things get going someone has to stop the thing for some added and 
unneeded drama. What starts out as a mildly funny comedy turns itself into a 
vicious custody battle drama, and to tell you the truth, none of it is all 
that interesting. I was drawn to Robert from the beginning, and he gives the 
audience someone to root for, but Abbie is a complete mystery. She's 
uninteresting from the start, and especially gets annoying when she starts 
caring more about herself, than about her child. The performances are pretty 
bad, considering Everett and Lynn Redgrave is in the cast. Madonna is god 
awful for beyond reasons I could list in this review, Bratt does nothing but 
look good and smile, and Everett is surprisingly duller than usual. The 
script does little to help, and shifts genres too quickly as I mentioned 
before. The movie does make great use of Don McLean's song "American Pie," 
it's featured twice in the movie, and Madonna did a cover of it for the 
credits. It is probably the only highlight of the movie.
This is just another Hollywood drama that goes all out to make people cry. 
I'm sure it will succeed. For people looking for a little happiness that the 
film's marketing promotes, you're better off renting Everett's An Ideal 
Husband. He's much more charming and funny in that picture, and the 
supporting cast is all there as well. This movie is in no way good, fun, or 
interesting, and it's not the next best thing to any of those either.

Review for Rosemary's Baby (1968)
Reading Entertainment Weekly (also known as "The Bible") I discover that I had
not seen the 10th scariest movie of all time. This caused me to rush to the
video store to rent Rosemary's Baby (Blockbuster actually had a movie over 20
years old!) which can't really be put into a catergory, unless raped mother
conspiracy thriller is a genre. 
Rosemary Woodhouse (Farrow) and her husband Guy (Cassavetes) move into an old
apartment building where several people have died of witchcraft over the years.
Guy is an out-of-work actor (Rosemary always answers "What has he been it?"
with "He's been in two plays and has done lots of TV and radio.") he's willing
to do anything to make it big, including summoning the devil.
This he does, turns out almost everyone (including Ruth Gordon who won an
Oscar) in the apartment building is a member of a Satan-loving cult. They
massacre babies and feed their blood and flesh (pleasant) to the devil himself.
Guy gets his big break after Rosemary has a dream that she is raped by the
devil (a dark and disturbing scene) she is to bear his only child.
As the plot unfolds Rosemary is led through countless twists and turns each one
of them more shocking than the next. While I can't say that I enjoyed the
ending, I do commend the director for not ever showing us the child of Satan.
For that, and for the fact that this 136 minute long movie wasn't hard to sit
through, I give it *** stars.

Title
Review for I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998)
I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (R) * 1/2
Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy Norwood
Directed by Danny Cannon
A Review by Frankie Paiva
Obviously, the hook-handed Ben Willis is at it again, this time it's on an
island in the Bahamas where the lush surroundings are just bound to turn
deadly.
In the middle of summertime, Julie James (Hewitt) and her friend Karla
(Norwood) are called up by the local radio station. They have to guess the
capital of Brazil to go on their dream vacation, scrambling around the kitchen,
they find a bag of coffee that says it was produced in Rio. They guess that,
and their vacation begins.
Karla brings along Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer) and reluctant Julie is forced into
bringing Will (Matthew Settle) because her old boyfriend Ray (Freddie Prinze
Jr.) has to work. Apparently Julie still can't get over the fact that they cut
off Ben Willis's hand and threw him into the water to drown in the last movie
but, "they never found the body!" Oh my! What shocking horror! 
The capital of Brazil isn't Rio, it's Brazilia, Ben has set them up. He's once
again on a vengance gig, back for more action this time killing everyone in
sight. I mean, come on, does the housekeeper or the bartender have any idea
what Julie did last summer? And what happened to all the people that were on
the island?
This film is greatly lacking Kevin Williamson, who brought spark and witty
dialouge to the original. Sarah Michelle Gellar is also not here, couldn't she
have been resurrected from the dead in a demonic ritual or something? This film
is so predictable, and it even surpasses the number of cliches that Scream
mentions and features. I don't care how little Hewitt has on for most of the
film, so I give it * 1/2 stars.

Title
Review for Pecker (1998)
John Waters has been known to make comic masterpieces. Well, perhaps not
masterpieces, but he's still known to make movies that are pretty darn funny,
and this film is no exception. It's sort of a documentary of people who live
their lives a little differently from our own, what becomes of it, and how it's
viewed by the outside world.
Pecker (Furlong, a very wise casting choice) is obsessed with taking photos of
everything around him. In the opening scene, he goes through an entire roll of
film while sitting on the bus. His girlfriend is Shelly, (Ricci) she runs a
laundromat and poses often for his work. He also knows a thief named Matt,
(Brad Sexton III) and he films him stealing things from the supermarket. 
One day when Pecker (known for the way he eats, like a bird) has displayed some
of his work in the sub shop that he works at, a New York art gallery owner
(Lili Taylor) walks in and is overcome with enthusiasm, because she's found a
new talent. The art world is set on fire with Pecker's visions of small town
life, but their interests and influences, soon find his way of life becoming
more and more like theirs.
The film is very, very funny. Only mastermind Waters could dream up an old
woman that gives a voice to her statue of the Virgin Mary, (if this is giving
you major question marks or if you have other inquiries just rent it) not to
mention a young girl that snorts sugar and vegetables like drugs. Other
characters like this are present to give the film even more wackiness than
recent comedies.
Pecker does have some problems though. There are countless sex and nudity
scenes (strip clubs, angry lesbian strippers, etc.) there aren't really needed
and warrant the film a higher rating than it deserves. Most of the film feels
implausible, and some dialog and situations seem forced. Performances are good
all around with Furlong (who is shaped up to become a big actor) and Brad
Sexton III leading the pack. Do you enjoy funny movies? Of course you do! So
see Pecker, which gets ***1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains female nudity and several scenes in a gay
strip club with lots of men in thongs. The film also contains several bad
attitudes towards people and authorities. Good Age: 15 & Up

Title
Review for Stir of Echoes (1999)
Bad things happen in big cities. So many films have been telling us this in the
past year, and for the Witzky family, there's no exception. While drunk at a
neighborhood party Tom Witzky (Bacon) dares his sister Lisa (Douglas) to
hypnotize him, thinking that all hypnotism is a hoax. He learns that it is very
real. After waking up from his trance, Lisa refers to him as one of the, "Lucky
8%" the people who can really be intensely under a spell. After the party
things begin to happen. Tom begins receiving sudden flashes of images that he
can make no sense of. The one he's the most obsessive about is a pale teenage
girl who he thought he saw sitting on his couch. Even worse, Tom's son Jake has
been talking to an invisible girl he calls Samantha, it appears the two of them
are thinking and conversing with the same person. And while it at party, Tom
learns that Lisa said he needed to be more open-minded. Who knows what that
could have done?
More images come, and the more that appear, the more Tom is compelled to find
an answer to them. His search for answers includes digging up his entire
backyard, jackhammering his entire basement, and creating a large hole in the
house's beautiful wood floor. All of this horrifies his wife Maggie (Erbe), who
isn't sure how much more of this she can take.
This is a thriller that effectively stirs up some suspense, while many scenes
in the film are more than slightly outrageous, the sudden flash of images is
fun and exciting and keeps the moviegoer guessing. It stays that way for a
while, until the movie reaches it's conclusion, and wraps itself up so neat and
tidy that nothing is left unexplained or to the imagination, one of the keys to
a great thriller. Acting is surprisingly first rate with Kevin Bacon, Kathryn
Erbe, and young Zachary David Cope giving above average performances. The only
real thing that bugged me about the picture was that Maggie stayed with her
husband for almost the entire time. Nothing entirely plausible happens, yet she
seems to take it all in without too much of a panic. The soundtrack is also
notable and sets some of the gritty tone for the film. Finally a movie that
gets close to the amount of thrills it wants to achieve. Not many echoes
stirring here, but there's a whole lot of mystery, a whole lot of confusion,
and a whole lot of fun.

Title
Review for Flawless (1999)
There is one man in Hollywood that I have always feared. Joel Schumacher,
director of such films as Batman Forever, A Time To Kill, Batman and Robin, and
8MM. I have yet to see a recent (like in the past twenty years) good movie
coming from the man. That's why I was extremely surprised when I viewed
Flawless, the adult Thanksgiving alternative to Toy Story 2. After watching the
film, I noticed the director of the picture, Joel Schumacher. If you see this
and any of the four movies I've mentioned above, you can easily see why I was
surprised that this film contained a marginal amount of quality. I'll spare you
from saying that Flawless is anything but (as so many other critics have) but I
will say that the film's performances lift it up much higher than expected.
Walt Koontz (De Niro) is an ex-cop who lives in the bad side (Is there a good
one?) of Brooklyn. One night in his apartment building, he hears a shot from
another room and immediately goes up to investigate. Walt gets caught up in a
fight, gets shot and has a stroke. He stutters a lot and is barely able to
speak. He finds his past life that was already slipping away falling away from
him even more as he realizes that he's getting older and isn't what he used to
be.
But there may be help. Rusty (Hoffman) is a transvestite who lives one floor
up. Before the accident, homophobic Walt would usually engage in a battle of
insults with his neighbor, but now he/she may be the source of his recovery.
Rusty offers to give him singing lessons so that his embarrassing stutter might
go away. The two begin to form an unlikely bond as another plot emerges.
Apparently there has been some stolen drug money (at least Joel is keeping
parts of his roots) and a big crime boss thinks that someone in the apartment
next to Rusty has it. This part of the plot certainly isn't very interesting,
and is kind of a cheap way to add to the running time.
De Niro was obviously picked for his ability to play characters with
disabilities with amazing ease. Walt is much like his character who awoke from
a coma in Awakenings. Hoffman, known for playing a variety of characters, (his
film credits include Magnolia, Happiness, and Boogie Nights) is great. He fully
embodies his drag queen character without putting in too many of the
traditional clichés. Besides these two factors though, the film doesn't have
much going for it. Much of the film is shot without attention to visual detail
and the plot has a tendency to be gritty and depressing. The drug money subplot
is what really destroys the film, making for a wild ending that doesn't belong
with the rest of the film. Perhaps if they would have used the footage during
the credits (stay for them, it's pretty funny) for the ending everyone would
have gone out of the theater smiling. The performances in Flawless are great,
but the script (written by, who else? Joel Schumacher) and the plot aren't.
Acting is enough to lift Flawless up, and it gets my *** stars.
The Young-Uns: Besides one character being a drag queen, we see several scenes
featuring him and his other homosexual friends, for those concerned about such
things. There is also some not very graphic violence and lots of f-words. Good

Review for South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)
You'll hear a lot of people say this, and I'm here to tell you it's 100% true.
There hasn't been a movie so dead on not only in it's comedy, but in current
events since Wag The Dog in 1997. Kenny, Cartman, Stan, and Kyle sneak into an
R-rated movie starring Candian comedians Terrance and Phillip who's main
concern is singing the audience songs about having sex with everything
imaginable (donkeys, uncles, mothers, etc.) this strikes a chord with the crude
3rd graders who begins quoting lines from the film. Several (hard) pokes at the
MPAA, anyone of an ethnical race or religion, and Canada (who gets poked the
hardest, which caused me to wonder if they'd re-edit the film to show "Blame
the United States" for Canadian viewers.) follow to ensure a wild comic ride
that reminded me of Election on swearing steroids. 
Is the film for kids? Nah, it's full of plenty homosexual jabs, profanity,
murders and pokes at celebrities (Winona Ryder and ping-pong balls! An unlucky
Bill Gates!) and other extreme and objectionable material to set off thousands
of concerned parents and activists. As Kyle's mother (who is the head of
M.A.C., Mothers Against Canada) says that these movies corrupt our youth,
there's another point (proven in the musical number "Kyle's Mom's A Bitch")
that the outcome of the children "affected" by this film depends on the
impressionability (if that's even a word) of the viewer. It all starts at home,
and this message is loud and through this movie that, while crude for some, is
controversial, political, and funny all at the same time.

Title
Review for Big Sleep, The (1946)
Sometimes, when I'm really bored and I don't know of anything else that I want
to see, I'll just choose a movie that I've never heard of (except if it's like
Minors & Whips or Barely Legal IIV) and rent it just for the heck of it. Now
this method may not seem the best to you, the review reader, but I find it as
an easy way to select movies. That's how I came across The Big Sleep, I did not
learn until after viewing the film that is an everlasting legend. 
Philip Marlowe (do I really need to tell you who plays him?) is assigned to
cover up some family business, old man Sternwood is being blackmailed and wants
to know who's blackmailing him (or something like that, I'd have to see the
film again to be sure.) One of his lovely daughters, Carmen (Martha Vickers) is
high on something while a man is murdered. He must protect the drug addict
while dealing with her sister Vivian (Bacall) who is somehow connected. In the
meantime, other people get murdered, and he begins to fall in love with Vivian.
Marlowe's investigations eventually bring him to the casino of Eddie Mars (John
Ridgely) who becomes one of his prime suspects in the case. 
A groundbreaking film in the amount of violence that is used and the way the
film is shot. Now I'm no expert in classic film, but to me, it contains a lot
more violence than any film I've seen made in or before 1946. Scenes between
Bogart and Bacall are exciting and fun to watch. The case is also interesting
and entertains while it unfolds. Classic cinema that should be getting more
rents at the video store. In my opinion the film though, (or course it's my
opinion, this is my review!) it's still not as good as The Maltese Falcon, but
I still give it *** stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains several people being shot, kicked, punched,
etc. The film also contains drug use and quite a bit of alcohol. Good Age: 9 &
Up

Review for Todo sobre mi madre (1999)
All About My Mother (Todo sobre mi madre) (R) 
Starring Cecilia Roth, Penelope Cruz, and Eloy Azorin
Directed by Pedro Almodovar
Running Time: 105 Minutes
Released by Sony Pictures Classics
Reviewed by Frankie Paiva
There are only a selected handful of films that manage to be funny, yet be
extremely sad at the exact same moment in time. All About My Mother is one of
those films. The movie, which is filled with beautiful scenery and gorgeous
settings, has this ability to affect you by printing haunting images onto your
brain, and making sure they stay there.
Manuela (Roth) takes her son Esteban (Azorin) to a touring production of "A
Streetcar Named Desire" for his birthday. He is delighted by the show and
decides to wait outside in the rain to ask one of the lead actresses for her
autograph. He is determined to get it, and he runs after her when she speeds
away in a taxi. At an intersection, he is run over by a car and killed. He
died, never knowing who his father really was, and Manuela was going to tell
him all about his dad that night as his birthday present. 
The grief stricken Manuela decides to go back to Barcelona to meet up with
his father, but there is a catch. Not only does the dad not know he has a son,
he also happens to be a transsexual who know goes by the name of Lola, and is
contributing to the spread of AIDS across the city. She rents an apartment, and
while in town, takes in a pregnant nun with a foreboding mother and helps her
through her pregnancy. She also meets up with her friend Agrado (Antonia San
Juan), who I believe was supposed to be a woman playing a woman but in this
movie it's kind of hard to be sure. These three women soon begin a rapidly
growing bond of friendship, a bond that is later shared with the lead actress
from Streetcar, who is currently in town for the show. Each of these four women
have problems, and each one of them will have help to deal with them.
It's hard to think of where to begin with this film. For starters, the
cinematography and camera work is superb. The use of color is remarkable and
adds life to and electricity that seeps throughout the entire picture. But not
everything is vibrant and rosy. The film also has some chilling moments, and a
particular scene involving Manuela circling a field full of hookers offering
themselves to, and being raped by men is (in my opinion) the most haunting and
depressing scene of any film this year. The film's main theme is death and
disease, and the pain caused by both, but much of the abundant humor
overshadows the dark undertones. There is an amazing monologue that Agrado
delivers about her life late in the film, that is so funny and hilarious, you
can download it on the AAMM website. 
There are many great performances in the film, Cecilia Roth shines as the
vulnerable, but strong heroine of the movie and San Juan is just beyond belief
as
Agrado. But the real star of the film is director Pedro Almodovar, everything
in the film looks amazing and all of the scenes are well thought out. This may
finally be his chance to be noticed by the mainstream audience, as the film is
likely to pick up this year's Best Foreign Film Oscar. An overall good film,
almost all of the testosterone in the audience will be lost, but it will still
be enjoyable for both genders. If you are looking for a great movie to see,
find the theater near you playing All About My Mother.
Overall Grade: B+                        Rated R for for sexuality including
strong sexual dialogue, language, and some drug content
The Young-Uns: While the film would be OK for older teens, they will probably
be bored. Good Age: 15 and up

Review for Muse, The (1999)
Steven Phillips (Brooks) is sitting in a posh restaurant with a young studio
executive that says he's lost his edge. "What can I do to fix it?" Brooks asks,
but he says it's beyond fixing. "But I just got the Humanitarian Award!" he
fires back, "Oh come on, everyone gets that." The Muse is a perfect example of
the way that young Hollywood stars and executives are shaping what type of
movies that we see in the next millennium. It also shows what this young
movement does to the aging workers who've been there awhile.
When Steven sees a mysterious woman getting into a cab when he comes to ask his
friend Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges) for advice he at first begins to think that
he is having an affair. But in his desperation, Jack feels sorry for him and
tells him that she is a muse. A muse is a child of Zeus and is supposed to
inspire all creativity. (Just a little update for those of us who didn't pay
attention in history.) Steven decides to consult the muse, (Stone) who turns to
want more than anybody in Hollywood are paying for their services.
Decked out in a Four Seasons suite, she makes him be at her beck and call, in
exchange he's starting to form an idea about a Jim Carrey comedy in a water
park. She also helps inspire Steven's wife Laura (Andie McDowell) to become the
next Mrs. Fields. She two investigators of a local mentor hospital show up at
the front door looking for her...they begin to wonder.
The film turns in a great performance by Stone. Her wackiness reminded me of
some of her craziness scenes in Casino. Albert Brooks also turns in a fine
screenplay that constantly moving and funny. But the film also raises the idea
of what will happen when the Sarah Michelle Gellar's of today turn 30? What
will happen to the industry then? If your looking for a fun film to see, go out
and see The Muse which gets *** stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains a brief view of Sharon Stone's butt. Good Age

Title
Review for Virgin Suicides, The (1999)
The Virgin Suicides is a great film because it asks the audience to interpret 
character interactions and the overall meaning of the film. At its closing, I 
felt like seeing it again to examine the relationships between everyone more 
closely. One would really have to see this movie again in order to fully take 
in its drama and purpose. This gorgeous, dreamy film is definitely worth a 
second viewing.
Mr. Lisbon (James Woods) and Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) live in an 
alternate universe that isn't quite explainable. Each of their five 
daughters, Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Bonnie (Chelse 
Swain), Mary (A.J. Cook), and Therese (Leslie Hayman) get kept in the house 
under close watch at all times. They cannot go out with anyone, or 
participate in social events outside of school. This of course drives the 
local boys crazy. They often dream of conquering the unconquerable Lisbon 
sisters. Everything changes when Cecilia, the youngest of the sisters at only 
thirteen, attempts suicide. Her psychiatrist (a short appearance from Danny 
Devito) suggests they throw a party, and give her more chances to interact 
with males her own age. The boy's sexuality gets further awakened as they try 
to comprehend and become a part of the girlâs world they get introduced to. 
As the film continues, the girls begin to decide their fates and the boys 
love for them becomes even greater.
There is a reason this movie's title is The Virgin Suicides. Anyone looking 
for even remotely happy or exciting entertainment should look elsewhere. This 
is a very heavy film, but one that doesn't lose interest, and isn't too slow. 
The topic of teen suicide gets handled with the greatest of care. The movie 
takes place in the 1970s when teen suicide wasn't as big of an issue as it is 
today. Reactions to the suicides by neighbors, reporters, and teenagers are 
an interesting addition that shows speculation on the Lisbon sisters isnât 
just a teenage guy thing. The surprising lack of grief for the lost sister 
shows what a different family this is. âThe girls walked into school like 
nothing had happened.â? says the narrator.
Since the movie gets told almost entirely in flashback by the boys, (the 
narrator is Giovanni Ribisi) we get just as confused about what's going on in 
the Lisbon household as they were. The reasons why Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are so 
strict with their children never get fully explained. Mr. Lisbon frequently 
tunes in and out of a conversation, and often rattles on about the great 
flying machines, and how they won us the war. Mrs. Lisbon insists the girls 
go to church so that they can absorb the Catholic faith. Both parents are a 
little out of it. The beauty of the girls and some wonderful shots from 
director Sofia Coppola make this a stunning and dreamlike fantasy. A fantasy 
that ends in an inevitable shocking horror.
The acting is superb. Kirsten Dunst has never been more appealing, and she's 
a standout from the other Lisbon girls. James Woods and Kathleen Turner are 
also very good as the two parents. They perfectly convey their feelings while 
still making us wonder what's going on in their heads. Hopefully this movie 
will make parents think about talking and listening to their children more. 
Maybe if the parents had listened or done something different, nothing would 
have happened. 
The awkwardness and confusion felt by the boys is what this movie is all 
about. No matter where they are today, whether it's in drug rehab, still 
living in the same town, or thousands of miles away, no boy living at that 
time in that place will ever forget the Lisbon sisters. The thought of 
conquering the unconquerable as mentioned earlier still exists in their mind. 
The love, mystery, and bewilderment of their universe linger as well. They 
can't forget the sisters, neither can I.

Review for Scary Movie 2 (2001)
2001 - USA 
Director: Keenen Ivory Wayans 
Starring: Anna Faris, Christopher Masterson, Tim Curry, Marlon Wayans, Regina 
Hall, Shawn Wayans, Kathleen Robertson, James Woods, Chris Elliott, Tori 
Spelling, David Cross 
The original Scary Movie was released under the radar last year and astounded 
analysts and its studio, Dimension Films, with its high box office gross. The 
film spoofed classic horror films using `Scream' as an outline, with plenty 
of disgusting and raw scatological humor. Scary Movie placed number three on 
my worst five films of the year list for 2000, but since the film earned $157 
million domestically, and because life is unfair, a sequel was inevitable. 
The surprise is that it really isn't that bad. The sequel is far more clever 
than the first, this time adding political references and current events into 
the mix. There's a nice balance between Firestone tire and Nike TV ad jokes, 
and a clown being choked to death by a phallus jokes. The film is fun 
overkill. 
Anna Faris (who, in a bizarre side note, was born and raised in the small 
Seattle suburb of Edmonds, Washington where this author resides) reprises the 
role of Cindy Campbell. Her horny psychology professor (Tim Curry, who else?) 
stages some type of psychological experiment for her and all her friends from 
the original Scary Movie, who all happen to go to the same college. The 
experiment involves spending the weekend in a haunted mansion. Things, of 
course, go terribly and hilariously wrong. 
Not that the plot really matters. The film moves from one joke to another so 
quickly it's really a string of punch lines rather than a story. This is 
forgivable because the material is very funny... but there's a problem. 
If you haven't kept up on popular culture lately, you're likely to miss many 
of the jokes. A very clever spoof of Save the Last Dance flew by even the 
teenagers at my packed screening, as did a Rocky send-up. Other films are so 
cleverly woven into the plot that one viewing isn't nearly enough to spot 
them all. Less obvious jokes spoof films like The Game, The Amityville Horror 
, Urban Legend, and Hollow Man. All that and a character named Jamie Lee 
Curtisto. 
One of the biggest problems with Scary Movie was that it had to adhere so 
closely to the storyline of Scream. Scary Movie 2 is a combination of House 
on Haunted Hill and The Haunting, but even that's a loose structure. 
This gives the actors time to roam around, and the result is a more relaxed 
pace. Regina Hall gives a funny performance that goes against the premise 
that African-Americans always die first in horror movies. Christopher 
Masterson and Faris have good chemistry, but the film really belongs to Chris 
Elliott. As Hanson, the house's caretaker with a deformed, odd-looking left 
hand, and less than appealing facial features, he is completely wonderful and 
over-the-top. Tori Spelling is criminally underused. She gets to have wild 
sex with the invisible man, but not much else. I was waiting for a `90210' 
gag or her dad to pop out from somewhere. 
The biggest surprise of all may be that Scary Movie 2 seems tamer than the 
original. Oh sure there's abundant sex humor, but America has become less 
taboo about these issues since the original's release. Whether tamer or more 
outrageous, there's plenty of laughs here for a normal person to have a great 
time, and a Joe-Lieberman-person to start fuming.

Review for Waiting for Guffman (1996)
The often confused genre of mockumentary, basically a scripted documentary is
often not understood by every Hollywood director. The concept of having
interviews with the characters, but forgetting not to give big glamour shots
and regular filmed footage has often been forgotten in films like Drop Dead
Gorgeous. But this is a fine display of what a true mockumentary should be.
Quirky, fun, and entertaining this story of a small town putting on a play of
it’s history is sure to entertain many, while still staying true to it’s
genre.
Corky St. Clair (Guest) is a gay director that has written an original
screenplay about the history of the little Missouri town called Blaine. Blaine
is one of those Fargo-type towns where every knows everybody else, and
everybody has the same mid-west accent. The auditions are the first major part
of a play, Corky is impressed by the town’s dentist, Dr. Allan Pearl (Levy) a
man who wears very, very big glasses and is equally stunned by the duo of
Sheila and Ron Albertson (Catherine O’Hara and Fred Willard) the man and wife
who can really sing. The production has six main players, with Parker Posey
(imagine an independent film without her) as a Dairy Queen worker round out the
bunch.
When a New York critic named Mr. Guffman (hence the film’s title) promises to
come and review it they get even more excited. But the production runs into
various problems, Corky insists on having the proper funding to take the show
to Broadway, one of the actors is taken out of the play at last minute, and he
can’t get Dr. Pearl to take off those darn glasses.
Why is it that everyone in a small town is so weird and quirky? For once if
Hollywood could make a movie that didn’t showcase them in this way. Not to
say that it isn’t enjoyable, this film is loaded with inside jokes and fun
characters. I especially liked Eugene Levy as the town dentist who ends up
singing songs to the elderly in Hebrew. But after a while some of the people in
this film just seem to be there to be annoying. Seriously, this people must
have some connection to the outside world. Waiting For Guffman also stays true
to the formula never cutting away to do something super and fantastic and
letting the characters interact and respond with the audience. If your looking
for a little quirky fun I suggest you rent Waiting For Guffman, which gets ***
stars.

Title
Review for Payback (1999)
There is only so much star power that you can handle. Several films base their
success on their main star, thinking that they will be a big draw whether or
not the film is any good. I think that this must have been what was on the
minds of the people who created Payback, a new Mel Gibson thriller that
doesn’t really thrill. The public seems to trust Mel when it comes to making
good action movies, after this I wonder if anyone will. What starts out as an
ultra-violent revenge movie ends as an ultra-violent revenge movie with not
much difference in between.
Porter (Gibson, who’s right for the role but can’t pull it off) was
betrayed by his partner and his wife when they all stole $135,000. They leave
him for dead in a parking lot. But Porter is alive and (depending on your point
of view) well, he plans to seek them out, retrieve his $70,000, and get some
good old fashioned revenge. But in order to find the guy, who know works for a
drug lord, he’ll have to kill a bunch of people and a bunch of people will
have to seriously hurt him and all of them do it as if their having fun.
Somehow, (I don’t really get this) they must plan the ultimate plan to get
away from the two corrupt cops that are following them and escape from an evil
guy (Kris Kristofferson) who’s son they kidnap. Will Mel Gibson die? Or will
he overcome the bad guys? Seriously, does anyone not know the answer to those
questions?
Payback is an example of what is wrong with out culture. The film is extremely
violent, but the thing that bothered me is that plenty of that violence
didn’t seem to be occurring for a reason. Another depressing factor of the
film was that everything was shot when it was really cloudy or with no light,
there isn’t one scene in the movie that has an lighting at all. Plus Lucy
Liu’s character, a hooker that’s into S&M isn’t interesting even though
there’s several moments where she could be. She’s basically the only woman
in this that kills a lot of people. I also see no reason why the female
characters were in this film at all because they didn’t bare their chests,
which in this type of movie, seems like the only important thing they could do.
The film played to me as kind of an old detective story, you can kind of sense
Gibson doing a Humphrey Bogart thing as he narrates a lot of the story. But
this film is way too much like Twilight, starring Paul Newman, to be any good.
Female Gibson fans will be treated to only a brief glimpse of his chest in the
shower, this is definitely a guy movie. So, if your looking to see a bunch of
people get killed, punched, have their feet hit with hammers and whips,
spanked, and shot, see Payback which gets * star.
The Young-Uns: Bloody and brutal violence and shooting accompany almost every
scene. S&M sex scenes, heavy smoking, and language also occur. Good Age 17 & Up

Review for Sweet Hereafter, The (1997)
Has there ever been a film so spectacular and so wonderful that you have ever
been afraid to write a review for it? A picture show with a story so
fantastically woven into a great motion picture experience? If the slightest
word could set off someone or do disrespect to the film? This is exactly the
way I feel about The Sweet Hereafter which has just joined my Top 5 favorite
films of all time.
Mitchell Stephens (Holm) is a lawyer who has gone to a snowy town where
fourteen kids have died in a bus crash. He suggests that something was wrong
with the bus, and wants to file a claims suit for the damages experienced by
the families. He interviews various parents and victims of the crash including
Nicole (Polley) who has been confined to a wheelchair. 
But Mitchell soons finds these problems connecting to what's happening in his
life with his troubled daughter. He learns certain lessons here that can help
him towards bettering the life of his family. He also has to deal with people
who are living in the past and cannot move on.
But it's not just the great screenplay (which was Oscar nominated) and the
great characters that appear that make this film what it is. It's the way the
film is shot. For some scenes, Egoyan fills the screen with people's mouth
quivering as they talk to one another, and rather then letting the film start
with the bus crash and have all of the conversations follow it, the film tells
the story is a weird sort of way, flashing back between after the accident,
before the accident, and the present day. 
The film has robbed of all of the two Oscars it got nominated for. Where was
the Best Picture nomination? Where were the Supporting Actress and Best Actor
nods? Who cares about Titanic? I cried much more often in this than I did in
that. You need to see this film now! This instant! Go! Go to Blockbuster and
see The Sweet Hereafter which gets **** stars.

Title
Review for Shaft (2000)
Considering that casting director Ilene Starger rounded up a great cast 
including all of the names above, Dan Hedaya, and Richard Roundtree I really 
expected more from this movie. Shaft certainly kicks butt, but there are too 
many underdeveloped characters around him. The plot is very weak, twisting 
itself in all possible ways to attain more onscreen violence. Strong violence 
may have been a trademark of blaxploitation movies of the 1970s, but it 
doesn't need to be here. While most assaults are only worth mild cringes, 
Shaft works more as a modern action flick than a gritty ode to the original 
Shaft, Superfly, and all those Pam Grier movies. Too bad it takes the latter 
road.
John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) nephew of the original Shaft (Richard 
Roundtree in a cameo) is a police detective turned private eye. When a racist 
killing happens outside a night club, he's determined to bring the hateful 
perpetrator Walter Willaims (Christian Bale) to justice. Walter flees to 
Europe. Two years days later Shaft joins up with a narcotics team headed by 
Carmen (Vanessa L. Williams). Since the suspect has returned from a very long 
trip to Switzerland, the case gets resumed. Together the group searches for 
the scared witness who saw it all (Toni Collette). Peoples (Jeffrey Wright) 
is a drug dealer that will have an effect on everyone. He gets involved with 
two corrupt cops from the narcotics team. He also gets paid to kill the 
witness. The greed and betrayals that ensue ensure a machine gun happy good 
time.
With such a flimsy plot this movie relies almost entirely on Samuel L. 
Jackson's lead performance. Luckily, it is a very good one. At fifty-one, 
Jackson can still beat the bad guys with graceful ease. His ultra-cool 
persona gets perfectly completed with black leather everything and a blinding 
shining bald head. Shaft is one big bad "motherlover." One couldn't say that 
for the rest of the cast. While Busta Rhymes and Jeffrey Wright make 
impressions, there's no real reason Vanessa L. Williams needed to be in this 
at all. The same goes for Christian Bale whose performance was flat. Toni 
Collette, who was great in Muriel's Wedding and The Sixth Sense tries to make 
something out of her thankless role. Any scene without Shaft seems boring and 
stupid, but the scenes with him are marvelous. David Arnold's score along 
with the Shaft theme from Issac Hayes really heighten the experience. Getting 
louder at appropriate periods of action, it's the only consistently good 
thing here. The fast pace of events comes to a grinding halt a third of the 
way into the movie. Ninety-eight minutes isn’t too long, but the film seemed 
considerably longer than it was. To top it off there is virtually no sex in 
this remake. What happened to the private dick with all the chicks? The 
minuscule amount of sex that occurs involves Shaft uttering pickup lines 
like, "It's my duty to please that booty." Every line like this seems forced 
and uncomfortable from Jackson. 
Usual action movie clichés are present. It’s pretty unlikely that of the at 
least two hundred bullets fired at Shaft and crew, not one hits its intended 
target. Our hero seems invincible. Perhaps shots of Shaft slowly walking down 
a dark alley with his long black leather coat fluttering in the wind are 
purposely reminiscent of Batman. Regardless, they definitely best portray the 
man’s image. If anything, this movie has a slam bang unexpected ending. One 
the audience and I didn’t see coming. If more gasps like this got worked into 
the plot structure, the movie would be much more enjoyable. A stronger script 
providing better chances for better acting would also have made this far 
superior. I couldn't help feeling cheated by Shaft. It wasn't nearly as fun 
as it could have been.

Title
Review for Stuart Little (1999)
There are so many elements that must come together to make a family film. You
have to get things that will appeal to the young audience, so that they can
laugh and enjoy themselves. It's even more of a challenge for most filmmakers
to include stuff that adults will get, and find funny as well. There are even
some way out there directors and writers that will even include plot elements
to keep teenagers interested. One of the recent films to do this was Toy Story
2. Blending sophisticated humor for adults with stuff that will entertain the
kiddies, it topped itself with its unique computer animation, and instantly
became a hit. While a smaller success story, this is essentially the same thing
that happens with Stuart Little, except maybe the teenager factor. Around
Christmas time we usually get attacked with bad family films covered in cheesy
and sympathetic ooze, (cough Bicentennial Man cough) but this film just manages
to reach above that for something new.
Mr. (Hugh Laurie) and Mrs. (Davis) Little have decided to get their son George
(Lipnicki, the cute kid from Jerry Maguire) a new baby brother. They go to the
adoption agency and are thrilled by the amount of wonderful children who live
there. A special person catches their eye, a talking mouse named Stuart (voiced
by Michael J. Fox) tells them things about the children and how couples always
come in and talk to the children. Once you've met with the children you want to
adopt, you'll just know which one to choose. This strikes them by surprise, (A
talking mouse?) but they just know that it has to be him. 
So after some trouble with the adoption agency they get Stuart home. From the
beginning George was very excited to meet his new baby brother, but he's
extremely disappointed when his parents bring home someone who he says slightly
resembles a mouse. (Wouldn't you be?) Like all family films, there is an event
or situation that happens to make George love and form a bond with Stuart. (I
won't tell what happens, but if you are one of the freaks that haven't read the
book like me it's still pretty obvious what it is.) Just as this relationship
begins there is trouble in the household. Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane), the
family's cat, cannot stand living in a house with a mouse as a member of the
family. When a local cat spreads the word around the neighborhood that he lives
with a mouse he isn't eating, he decides to do something about it. What will
happen to our famed rodent hero? You'll have to dish out $7.50 to find out.
The seamless blend of computer animation and live action is the first amazing
thing to behold in Stuart  Little. The human actors interact well with their
computer counterparts and they all give good performances. Geena Davis makes
her comeback mark showing that (in the right picture) she can act well. Stuart
is computer animated, but most of the rest of the animal cast are the real
thing. The training with the cats (especially in the final scene) shows that
this film obviously had some serious animal trainers on hand. The animal's
world is like our world in many ways. There are people willing to do anything
for money, crime boss cats working for the feline Mafia, and loners who pick
off of what others do. There are some of the usual clichĂŠs, (there is no way
to escape them in a family film) but they are easy to ignore. 
Voice casting was very well done and thought out. Fox is perfect as Stuart and
while he says oh dear one too many times, he makes his character fun and
interesting. A brilliant casting move was done in Nathan Lane (who starred in
the nowhere near same plot, but rodent themed Mousehunt) as Snowbell the cat.
Most of Snowbell's jokes are unfunny and all come from other movies we've seen
before, but Lane manages to make them funny again. Other voices include Steve
Zahn, Jennifer Tilly, David Alan Grier, and Chazz Palminteri.
Since it was originally a book, how is the script you ask? We all know that
books turned into movies are almost always a disastrous experience. There is
good news here. Does the name M. Night Shyamalan strike any bells? If not, he's
the director and writer of last summer's scary ghost hit The Sixth Sense. Some
of the story is jumbled on its way to the big screen though. It's never quite
explained how Mr. and Mrs. Little think nothing out of the ordinary of a
talking mouse, and lots of other characters view it as nothing new. So I had to
ask myself, if Stuart can talk to humans, couldn't Snowbell? But that's
probably too much to ask for a children's movie.  
While I will admit that I have never read the book, (Is it my fault I liked
reading Berenstain Bear books when I was little?) the original Stuart was
published by E.B. White (famed author of Charlotteâs Web) sometime around
1974 (that was the earliest publishing date I could find, I'm sorry if I'm
wrong). It's surprising that it took so long for this children's classic to be
made into a full length feature film. If it had been made earlier however, it
probably wouldn't have been as cute, and it wouldn't have been nearly as much
fun.
Overall Grade: B          Rated PG for brief language
The Young-Uns: Despite some mild language, this film is aimed directly at them.

Title
Review for I Shot Andy Warhol (1996)
Lili Taylor nabbed one of her first lead roles in this true life drama about
Valerie Jean Solanas, the woman who shot Andy Warhol in 1968. But the film is
more of a showcase to the ways of the 60s and the influence that Warhol and
other artists had on the people at that time. 
Valerie Jean Solanas (Taylor) is a lesbian feminist who as written a book
called SCUM Manifesto, a book (which is now a classic) about the way that men
(like disease, or so she says) have been ruling here for the millions of years
before us. She tries to sell it on the street, and is thrilled when her drag
queen friend is invited to Andy Warhol's pad. This is her chance to sell him
not only on the book, but on some plays that she has been writing.
But Andy is just like all of the other men out there. When a publisher signs
her to a fraud contract and a friend puts her on a television show discussing
homosexuality where the host makes fun of her, she begins to think that Andy is
all behind it. He's been constantly ignoring and making fun of her and she
doesn't like it. Her increasing rage is about to bring on the deadliest of
consequences. 
Lili Taylor gives the performance of her career (at least so far) she puts
every ounce that she can into this character and it's a great treat to watch.
Flaws are abound however, most of the film is boring and needs something
interesting to be put on the screen and the story was told harsher than it
needs to be. Still, the film does a good job of examining the inner rage that
overcame the woman and her actions thereafter. If your looking for a cool 60s
noir piece, rent I Shot Andy Warhol, which gets *** stars.
The Young-Uns: The main character is lesbian and we see one lesbian encounter.
She is also a prostitute and we see two (not very explicit) sex scenes of her
servicing her customers. It also contains strong language and drug use. Good

Title
Review for Small Time Crooks (2000)
Ray (Woody Allen) is a hapless criminal who hatches the idea to rob a bank 
with a couple of his buddies. His brilliant idea involves buying a run-down 
pizza joint next to the bank, and turning it into a cookie selling business. 
Ray's wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman, playing one person, and one person only) 
would watch, sell, and bake the merchandise. At the same time, the men would 
work downstairs on digging a tunnel that should eventually pop up into the 
bank vault. Ray's very surprised when the plan fails, but is even more 
shocked when the cookies become a major success. People line up for hours 
just to taste them. Soon they have a multi-million dollar corporation on 
their hands.
Their company, Sunset Cookies, becomes a household name and an American 
cookie favorite. As we learn from a very funny mock episode of 60 Minutes 
featuring Steve Croft, each player in the bank robbery now has a part in the 
company. One man is in charge of transportation, and another head of safety. 
It appears Ray and Frenchy have the life and wealth they always dreamed of, 
but Frenchy wants more. To her, being rich isn't about the money, but about 
having class. It's things like books, food, wine, and a good vocabulary that 
matter to her. So she hires a scholar named David (Hugh Grant) to teach her 
the finer things in life. The couple begins to grow apart. Ray starts 
spending time with Frenchy's dimwitted sister May (Elaine May) doing things 
that echo their old life, and Frenchy thinks it's time to re-evaluate their 
marriage.
This film's packed full of wit and humor. The wisecracking Frenchy has some 
great lines and is a good match for Allen's style of deadpan comedy. One of 
my favorite scenes is a dinner party that Frenchy attends. She believes that 
memorizing the dictionary one letter section at a time is the best way to 
increase her vocabulary. During the party, she attempts to impress people 
with her sophisticated terminology using phrases like, "Her ambidextrous 
acrobatics were deserving of applause." She also insists on being called 
Frances instead of Frenchy. Woody Allen does a great job in his role. I truly 
believe that his best movies include him playing a character, and not 
himself. Woody gets to wear shorts in the movie, perhaps giving us more of 
his scraggly self then we wanted to see. Shorts notwithstanding, the guy 
stills makes great movies at 64 after writing forty films, and directing over 
thirty. He is a comic genius of our time. Another character I loved was May. 
Elaine May makes her dense role as Frenchy's slow cousin the hit of the 
movie. May never quite catches onto things, but is easy to love. She 
definitely steals the show. Also making good use of their small roles are 
Hugh Grant, who does his usual posh English gentleman thing while Elaine 
Strich recovers marvelously from the recent Screwed. The trailers prominently 
display Michael Rapaport and Jon Lovitz in key roles, but in actuality they 
are only bit characters. Regardless of how much screen time they get, all of 
the actors have staggering chemistry while on screen.
Woody Allen has created a movie that is sharp, smart, and clever. This 
amiable comedy succeeds in making the audience laugh. Adults will rejoice 
with the material presented. Kids may not fully understand the humor, but 
Small Time Crooks is perfectly appropriate for them too. Crooks becomes 
slightly contrived near its ending, but never to the point where it becomes 
too predictable. Small Time Crooks is a comedy about finding our place in 
society topped off with the traditional old jazz tunes that only Woody could 
select. This movie manages to be risible without being raunchy or disgusting. 
The film is a treat, and the perfect summer comedy alternative for adults.

Title
Review for Arlington Road (1999)
I don't care how early we are into the year, there will be nothing like this
movie until the new millennium. Finally, a film has come along that challenges
the traditional action/suspense genre and gives new meanings to the words
paranoia and suspense.
Michael Faraday (Bridges) teaches a domestic terrorism class at the local
college, it's his way of remembering his wife who died by accident in a
confused shootout at a house in the woods. After helping the next door
neighbor's boy to the hospital (in a frightening and brilliantly executed
opening sequence) he realizes that he doesn't even know the people who have
been living across the street for a year.
Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Robbins & Joan Cusack) are the creepy neighbors, the
boys begin to bond but paranoid Michael senses something odd about them. He
begins to hunt around to see who Oliver really is, much to the objections of
girlfriend Hope Davis, and discovers he was charged for trying to blow up a
building when he was 15. He also discovers a hidden blueprint behind a painting
in their house.
Will Oliver strike again? As paranoia mounts, he is driven into insanity with
nowhere to turn.
This film uses blackouts extremely well, and I just can't get over how original
and disturbing the ending was. To know that their actually are people out there
like that is enough to frighten a heck lot more than anything else at the
cinema. Arlington Road belongs in the Top 10 Best Films of the Year and earns
my outstanding **** stars.

Title
Review for Quest for Camelot (1998)
I challenge any film reviewer to find an animated film that is more sickeningly
bad, predictable, and stupidly sappy than this one. The winner (if one finds a
film worse than this) will receive the chance to remove this movie from all
video shelves across America.
Kayley (Jessalyn Gilsig) has always dreamed of becoming a knight of the round
table just like her father Sir Lionel (Gabriel Bryne) so when the evil Ruber
(Gary Oldman, who's character is scarier than he is) has his Griffin steal
Excalibur, he plans to rule all, but the Griffin drops it in the "Forbidden
Forest."
Kayley runs away from her mother (Jane Seymour) to find the famed sword where
she meets up with a blind man (Elwes) who has magically lived his entire life
in the forest alone with a falcon that helps him see.
Throw in a two-headed wisecracking dragon and you've got probably one of the
worst family films ever made. Never mind that the animation is pretty, and
Kayley always remains pretty and clean throughout the entire movie, this is
just plain bad material (that doesn't deserve this long of a review) and for
that I give it a paltry * 1/2 stars.

Title
Review for Mr. Rice's Secret (2000)
David Bowie isn't exactly the person you would expect to be appearing in a 
family film. Even stranger is that he's in a film having to do with such 
serious material like death, fear of death, and growing up with Hodgkin's 
disease. The surprising secret is that Bowie is the best part of the movie. 
While given first billing, he's in no more than ten minutes of the picture, 
but his voice, messages, and spirit live on in the main character. That 
character is Owen Walters (Bill Switzer) a nearly friendless young boy with 
Hodgkin's disease. The two spend a lot of time together. Owen looks for 
support, care, and advice in Mr. Rice when his parents aren't providing it. 
I'd be running to this guy too. The parents (played by Teryl Rothery and 
Garwin Standford) apparently love their son very much. However, all these 
clueless two ever do is make their child's situation worse by not encouraging 
him or answering his questions. They are unawares to the feelings their child 
is experiencing. Other characters include the stereotypical fat and stupid 
bully (Jason Anderson), and a leukemia suffering boy (Richard de Klerk) who 
is more accepting of his condition than Owen is. Together these people could 
make quite a tedious tense family drama, and at many times they do. Helping 
things move along though is the pursuit of treasure. When Mr. Rice dies, he 
leaves behind a decoder ring and code so Owen can find his secret. Soon Owen 
is digging up dead bodies, breaking into houses, and discovering lost keys 
that could all lead to Mr. Rice's secret. It's quite plain what the secret is 
early on in the film, but the journey is exciting and I was waiting to see 
what Owen would do with it.
Despite some somewhat solid performances, particularly from its lead, there 
isn't a huge reason to see Mr. Rice's Secret. There isn’t a reason to see it 
with the kids either. This certainly isn't a family film, even though it's 
marketed as one. The themes of death will be too heavy and boring for most 
children and the film contains an awful lot of unneeded swearing and a very 
brief sexual image. The problem is simple. I counted at least ten noticeable 
clichés I had all seen in, at minimum, five other movies. Thinking back, it's 
hard to recall a part of Mr. Rice's Secret that seemed original, witty, or 
unique. Cliché ridden movies are not always bad, but the emotion exhibited by 
the actors is faker than Cher's body. Last year, October Sky managed to be 
entertaining and sad even though it too was cliché ridden. However, that 
movie had much better actors. This isn't to say director Nicholas Kendall 
doesn't pull some things off. One character has a very funny stuttering punk 
brother, and there is a great close-up shot of ants feeding on a rotten apple 
in one frightening scene. There is also a very funny discussion about how 
authority figures (like parents) are meant to get lied to. Even so, I doubt 
parents want their children learning that you can dig up graves in the middle 
of the night and get away with it. They probably wouldn't want kids to 
blackmail their siblings, or know you can always sneak out your bedroom 
window without ever getting caught either. Additionally, we must not forget 
the most important lesson of all. Whenever you punch a fat person in the 
stomach, they always cry.
I do appreciate the attempt to capture young boy's friendships and their true 
meaning, but this movie is just a depressing sham. The difficulties Owen must 
face never rise above the after-school special drama level, and when I 
figured out the ending about thirty minutes into the movie that didn't help 
either. I got continuously reminded of an Aesop fable the entire time, 
thinking that each scene was there to teach me a lesson, and they do. Perhaps 
the film will be an inspiration to children with Hodgkin's, leukemia, or 
other types of life threatening diseases. It shows that you can succeed, have 
friends, and triumph in life if you are only willing to try and prove 
yourself. The actors tried, and almost flourished. Mr. Rice's Secret isn't a 
guilty pleasure; it's more of a guilty emotional enjoyment. Even if I knew 
what was going to happen, I still left with a feeling of happiness. There 
just wasn't enough real emotion or material happening in the story to get 
this thing off its feet, or for me to rise up and cheer.

Review for African Queen, The (1951)
Classics rarely translate through the generations. What may have been a
spectacular journey into the unknown for audiences in the 30s and 40s might
have seemed different for those in the 60s and 70s. But whatâs really
frustrating (to me personally as a movie critic) is to not be able to see what
all of the praise was about in the first place. This is how I feel about The
African Queen, one of the later Humphrey Bogart movies, and (in my opinion,
donât sue me or anything) not one of his best. While Iâm sure that it
played with a much different reaction when it was first released in theaters in
1951, this is a film that (for me) has failed to translate itself for my
generation.
Charlie Allnut (Bogart, definitely at a change of pace from his detective movie
work) is captain of a boat that delivers mail to African colonies during World
War I. One this particular day heâs delivering to a brother and sister who
run a church for the Africans and try and convert them to Christianity. Rose
Sayer (Hepburn) is uptight and religious, quite accustomed to her nice, clean
way of life. When troops (I believe German) attack the camp she is forced to
flee and join Charlie as they sail down the river. She comes up with an idea to
attack an enemy warship that Charlie eventually goes along with.
All the usual sorts of plot cliches happen, at first they are afraid and argue
with each other, then they start to fall in love. There are many challenges to
greet them along the way. Rapids, leeches, enemy posts, itâs like the
filmmakers went through a list of all the possible dangers and checked them off
one by one. Will they survive the horrible journey? Or will the boat sink and
the two of them be gone forever? Almost all of the goings-on seemed predictable
to me.
I think that I have a much different view of the film than anyone viewing it
around the original time that it came out would. The cinematography is just
beautiful. The entire movie was filmed on location in Africa and the shots of
alligators jumping into the river and flamingos hopping in the water make up
some of the best parts of the movie. I also think that the film was sort of
making a point by saying that women could go on adventures and survive right
along with the men. An interesting side fact (that proves my point), the
filmâs tagline is, âThe Greatest Adventure Man Ever Lived...With A
Woman!â? But for all of the praise surrounding it, (Iâm really in trouble
this time. Number 77 on the greatest films of all time list on IMDB and I
didnât like it.) I didnât think that anything really happened in the story,
and therefore I didnât find the film very interesting at all. While Katherine
Hepburn does give a convincing performance, I didnât think that the film was
up to par with what it could have been. Obviously I have a different view than
when original audiences viewed it. Few people knew much about Africa then, and
not many people had ever been on such a grand adventure. Despite this, I still
canât give The African Queen too much credit, so it gets ** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains some slightly scary scenes involving rapids
and thunderstorms. There is also quite a bit of drinking and a gross scene that
has to do with leeches. Good Age 12 & Up

Review for Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001)
Murphy is a comic genius. He adds fun and flavor to each one of his projects, 
which certainly wouldn't be the same without him. Whether playing an entire 
obese family in The Klumps, or a talking donkey in Shrek, the man is just 
all-out hilarious. He's been trapped before in bad films Holy Man and the 
original Dr. Dolittle, but always bounces back. This time he reprises the 
role of the animal-talking doctor, and is, of course, funny. In this witty 
sequel, however, he has some backup. Most of it comes from a talking bear. 
Dr. Dolittle has become a worldwide sensation. Pet owners swamp his home with 
their ailing animals, and he's opened a successful veterinary clinic. His new 
fame has led him to drift away from his wife Lisa (Kristen Wilson) and newly 
sixteen daughter Charisse (Raven-Symone). Dolittle has to reintroduce a 
circus bear living in captivity named Archie (voice of Steve Zahn) to the 
wild, and make him appealing to forest bear Ava (voice of Lisa Kudrow). The 
bears are endangered species, and if they mated, it would stop a logging 
company from tearing down the forest. Reintroduction has never been 
accomplished, but it's a challenge the doctor will take, with the help of 
many other forest animals. 
Other voices include Michael Rapaport, Norm Macdonald, Isaac Hayes, Mike 
Epps, and Jacob Vargas. Each vocal performance is unique, and everyone is 
quite good. The highest praise, however, must go to the animal trainers. 
These animals actually look like they're saying the lines in the script. 
Whatever they did, it works. 
The jokes come fast, and are perfectly appropriate for kids. This makes it a 
summer rarity, in that both adults and kids will like it. It is far better 
than the one-joke Cats & Dogs. Also noteworthy is the refreshing family 
subplot to the story. Dolittle must balance his work with his family, and the 
scenes between him and Raven-Symone are quite touching. They feel real. 
Though no one will be a better person because of this film, certainly no one 
will be bored. This is a solidly entertaining comedy for everyone. It's a 
film you'd expect around Thanksgiving rather than summer. Murphy's 
high-energy performance makes this one to see. I'd be up for a third one.

Review for Wood, The (1999)
To begin with, I certainly felt out of place sitting in the audience at The
Wood, a movie that not only is good, but will pleasantly surprise you. Not only
is there not one Caucasian cast member, (not even in a cameo) I was also part
of the minority of the five white people sitting in my auditorium. 
Slim, (Richard T. Jones) Roland, (Taye Diggs) and Mike (Omar Epps) are all
gathered at a wedding that Roland is supposed to be at. He's at an old
girlfriend's house, drunk as ever, having second thoughts about giving up his
old wild lifestyle to settle down with one woman. 
This begins a whole set of flashbacks that are intervened nicely from the 80s
to present day. While it's not quite plausible how the flashbacks begin, it's a
cute way to make a movie, and they pull it to it's fullest extent. Young Mike
(Nelson, who steals the show) has just moved from North Carolina and has his
eyes set on Alicia (Malinda Williams) while his buddies try to rack up
telephone numbers. Despite the fact that Alicia's brother (De'aundre Bonds) is
an abusive gang member. Amazingly, it manages to do this without too many
racial stereotypes.
Another nice thing about The Wood is that you feel like your a part of the
movie. In beginning sequences Mike talks right into the camera and acknowledges
that we are there, watching everything that's happening to the characters.
While this isn't anything original or inventive, it does add a nice touch. It
also has several gags that seem taken right out of a toned down American Pie,
so for that, and the fact that I was taken aback by how good it was. The Wood
earns my *** stars.

Title
Review for Mumford (1999)
There are many different types of Hollywood productions. Some are loud and
noisy, filling the screen with images of violence and heroes saving big
breasted women. Others show comedies that have to do mainly with all of the
character's (possibly) budding sexuality and how it's related with the real
world. These are simply the type of movies that studios like to make. So when a
modest film like Mumford comes around, it should be a great oppurtunity to
spread the word about a quiet, no flashly effects, funny, Hollywood film.
A psychiatrist named Mumford (Dean) moves to a town called Mumford where he is
instantly greeted with plenty of patients with lots of interesting problems. He
enjoys listening to people and hearing what they have to say. Now it just so
happens (like in most movies) that the people in this small town are very
eccentric and very strange. Mumford is called on various outings to try and
help people all of the little city. But the two resident doctors of the town
begin not to take a liking of him and think it's interesting that everyone who
could confirm his graduation from school have tragically died.
Then he meets Sofie (Davis, playing somewhat of an extension of her character
in Next Stop, Wonderland) in one second, he instantly falls in love. Now
falling in love with a patient is a bad thing, especially if her mother is a
bitchy Jane Adams, but there is another twist. It turns out Mumford isn't even
a psychiatrist at all. He just thought it would be a good way to get away from
his former life. I won't give you the full story, but basically he used to be
on drugs and was sent to a rehab center run by monks. When they think that he
has magically disappeared they run a segment looking for him on Unsolved
Mysteries. So what should he do? Face what he has done? Or go into hiding once
again?
And so Hollywood once again regains my trust that they can produce a quality
feature film. Mumford is very modest, very quiet, and nothing really seems to
happen but I still found myself enjoying it immensely. The ensemble cast (Ted
Danson, Jane Adams, Jason Lee, Alfre Woodard, and others) are great. Especially
Ted Danson whose six minute scene has him as a cigar smoking jerk whose
concerned about his wife. Dean has an interesting smile, which could possibly
become a trademark if he becomes a big star. Of course I have to congratulate
Hope Davis, has she ever been bad in a movie? While not outstandingly great,
Mumford is fun, and it gets *** stars.
The Young-Uns: Three views of breasts and naked female androids, plus medium
language make up the film's bad content. Good Age 13 & Up

Title
Review for Beach, The (2000)
Leo has been in the spotlight for too long since the release of Titanic on
December 17, 1997. While he was enjoying his fame, the spotlight must have
gotten brighter and blinded him in the eyes and brain making him take bad
career choices. His first post-Titanic role was in 1998 with the Woody Allen
dud Celebrity where he played (what else?) a selfish movie star. He doesn't do
much better here. In interviews DiCaprio says he's interested in expanding his
horizons and getting the more intriguing and challenging roles. He's done a
fine job, too bad he couldn't pull if off. At all.
Richard (Leo! himself) is an American traveling in Thailand and wants to be
anything but a tourist. Seeing as there's no use in staying at a fancy hotel,
he rents a room in the back of a souvenir shop that features some of the slums
of the city. Daffy (Carlyle in a very small role) is a crazed drunk who tells
Richard about a mystical island with the perfect beach through the vent in the
top of his room. The next morning he finds Daffy who has slit his wrists, blood
is spurted all over his guest room, but there is a black map tacked onto his
door. So Richard invites a French couple who he heard having sex the previous
evening to come to the island with him for an adventure. 
After a long swim, and some careful navigation through a field, they find a
tropical paradise. Everyone that lives there is scantily clad, they all have
perfect bodies, and they smoke weed all day. Soon Leo begins a love affair (or
in this movie's idea of love, a sex affair) with Francoise (Ledoyen), the
female of the French couple that have split up. But everyone knows that there
can't be a movie where no trouble lies in paradise. There is one rule for
living on the island, since fields of growing drugs sit on the other half of
the land mass, the farmers there demand that no new people come to live there,
so that the secret doesn't get out. You can never, ever, ever tell anyone about
this place. Before Richard left for the beach, he copied the map Daffy gave him
and gave it to two junkies at his hotel, and when he goes back to the city he
meets them again, and finds out they plan to for a visit. Big mistake.
There are several implausibilites that are in this film. The first has to be
that all members of the island, whether it be the evil Thai druglords or
Francoise, all speak perfect English. Another problem deals with a shark attack
when someone was swimming near the beach, and don't even get me started on the
Leo 64 video game sequence. The movie is filled with countless amounts of
uneeded material and dialog. Only about half of the film's two hour running
time has anything to do with how the film ends, and it's message to the youth
of America (it's obvious audience). This makes it a bore to sit through,
specifically when Leo decends into some type of madness in the second half. Oh,
and did I mention, everyone there has enough clothes to last them their entire
stay.
Even movies with a bad plot and redundant scenes can sometimes be saved by
great acting. There's none of that to be found here though. Richard changes
moods too quickly, one time he's brooding about his life and is depressed, the
next he's a pathological liar who is trying to save himself from danger.
Besides, we don't see Leo do much except for that squint he always uses. The
chemistry between him and Ledoyen is nowhere to be found and the two aren't
very interesting as people, or as lovers, for us to care much about them. In
fact, almost all of the characters are surprisingly dull and the adapted script
by John Hodge doesn't let them reach the potential that they could have been.
The only marginally good performance comes from Robert Carlyle who makes us
sort of like the creepy Daffy, while still being on our edge. But never mind
him, he's only on screen for five minutes, this is Leo's picture. The ending is
also happens to be remarkably snooze worthy and is an uninventive way to end
the film. The only good thing this movie does, is to encourage hardcore Leo
fans to see it again and again. Leo is shirtless for almost the entire duration
of the picture, and it's a great treat, but not if you're a guy like me. The
soundtrack is also kind of cool, but I'd hate to give the movie more credit
than it deserves. Leo, you're a good actor, next time, if you're still around,
please be in a good movie, and keep your shirt on too.

Title
Review for Three Kings (1999)
I am constantly talking about hype. You know, the stuff that Hollywood sends
out to all of the people who see a movie. It's called marketing, it's called
milking the heck out of everything the critics say, and it's about aiming
towards an audience and offering them something (supposedly) new. So any film
that might break away from the Hollywood formula (and there are so few of them)
it is immediately loved and cherished...at least it's supposed to be. Three
Kings is a film that made me think, what's wrong with me? They is a majorly
critically acclaimed film and is said to be one of the early Oscar
contenders...but I didn't really like it that much. For all of the gloss and
glamour I was left to wonder what this movie would have done without so much
critical hype.
It's the end of the Gulf War. Treaties have been signed, and troops sent back.
There's an air of celebration in the air. But when Troy Barlow (Wahlberg) finds
a map in a guy's butt that leads to a place that has millions in Kuwait gold,
and he shows the map to Archie Gates (Clooney) who wants to retire in style,
the war isn't over for any of them. Teamed up with Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and
dim-witted Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) they set out to recover the gold and use it
for their own purposes. 
But when they break into a bunker where the gold is, their consciences catch up
with them. Iraqi troops come in and slaughter most of the people, they also
begin to attack the Americans. The group decides to help all of the people they
can, get then out of Iraq, and help them cross the Iranian border so that they
can be free of Sadaam. But getting there won't be easy.
Another movie (American Beauty being the other) that is a depressing Oscar
contender. I think that the cinematography and art direction both deserve
Oscars. But as for the rest of this edgy film, (perhaps a screenplay nod) I
didn't see any other big wins. Sure the way the film was shot was awesome and
totally cool (OK, I know those aren't the best descriptive words) but no one
stood out to me as being Academy material. The film does however paint a
portrait of what is wrong with war, and why we shouldn't have any more wars
because of all the pain and suffering people endure. While some people may say
that this film is too violent, I think that almost every scene of violence was
there for a reason. If we could just get to the root of hate, the world would
be a better place. So if your looking for an interesting look into the Gulf War
(I recomend you refresh yourself on what happened by looking it up on the
Internet before you go) Three Kings is the one, but for me, it only gets ** 1/2
stars.
The Young-Uns: The film is probably too violent for most people, it is a war
movie after all. Language and a sex scene also appear. You should also have an
understanding of the Gulf War. Good Age 15 & Up

Title
Review for Omega Code, The (1999)
Never before in my life have I seen a movie worse than The Omega Code. This 
may sound like a strong statement, but it is completely true. So many things 
went awry with the first movie funded by TBN (the Trinity Broadcasting 
Network) that I seriously could sit here all day listing them. 
Gillen Lane (Casper Van Dien) is a self-motivation and religious guru who 
lost his faith when he was ten. His mother died in a car crash when he was at 
that age and since then he's been trying to improve people's lives by 
teaching them to believe in themselves rather than a higher power. His ideas 
interest Stone Alexander (Michael York) a wealthy, but corrupt businessman 
who uses his work to promote peace in Jerusalem and other Middle Eastern 
countries to hide his work on cracking the bible code. Gillen and Alexander 
are both intrigued by this code. When the bible gets viewed in 3-D certain 
patterns emerge that predict the future. Hitler, the assassination of John F. 
Kennedy, and the death of Princess Diana were apparently all foretold by the 
bible. Whoever has control of the code and knows what's going to happen next 
can therefore claim themselves to be God. So Gillen must keep the code safe 
from double-crossing executives, bodyguards, and reporters. Along the way his 
faith may come back. 
The main problem with The Omega Code is that it tries too hard to be two 
different types of movies. It wants to preach the lord, and spread the word 
of Jesus to African countries we've never heard of. However, the religious 
message gets overshadowed by all of the action. Writers Stephan Blinn and 
Hollis Barton tried to make this entertaining, but try not to groan when 
Gillen says things like, "I’ve got to do it! It’s my child!" Try not to 
laugh when a man runs away from a big Amish-like shooter guy with a long 
beard. Scenes like these are laughably bad. So is the acting. Casper Van Dien 
still shows no hope of good acting skills. Rather than this being amusing, as 
it was in Starship Troopers, it's just really annoying. Michael York is also 
surprisingly bad. The Omega Code is so utterly predictable it's scary. Gillen 
isn’t smart enough to figure out that almost no one is on his side. The movie 
also treats the audience this way. Whether you see one movie a year or one 
hundred, it's very likely you've seen all of this before. Fifth graders are 
producing better stories with better dialog than this. Sitting through five 
hours of TBN and watching modern-day Tammy Faye Bakkers bawl it out is by far 
a less severe punishment. 
There was one joyous moment for me that involved this movie. That moment was 
when I returned the tape to the video store.

Title
Review for Babettes gćstebud (1987)
This is not an unseen movie. Thousands, even millions have watched it. Feast 
grossed just under 4.4 million dollars in the United States alone. Most of 
this revenue comes from its theatrical run, not its video release because Babe
tte's Feast is something most screenwriters avoid. It's a tough sell, and 
there's no hook to go along with it. Unlike the theater, if you rented the 
movie, and wanted to turn it off, you could. There's nothing unique you could 
convey to your friends about the story in under two sentences either. Despite 
this, Babette's Feast is an elegant, simple film. A wonderful and 
heartwarming experience awaits those who are patient enough for it to find 
its footing and unfold.
Martina (Birgitte Federspiel) and Philippa (Bodil Kjer) are the daughters of 
a long dead minister (Pouel Kern). They carry on their father's religious 
sect even though they've had several opportunities to leave their remote 
village. Through flashbacks we learn that young Martina (Vibeke Hastrup) and 
young Philippa (Hanne Stensgaard) were beautiful and kind young women who 
drove all the young men in town wild. They drove old ones, including French 
opera singer Achille Papin (Jean-Philippe Lafont), crazy too. Years later, 
Papin has aged even more, but remembers the women and their generosity. He 
sends Babette (Stephane Audran), a French refugee and cook, to them. Babette 
beseeches the two to let her stay, and eventually the sisters agree. It's 
back to the present. Martina and Philippa want to honor their father's 100th 
birthday. Since she has recently come into good fortune, Babette offers to 
cook a real French dinner for the celebration. The feast of a lifetime 
conflicts with the guest's conservative beliefs, and by the end they will all 
be changed. 
The only major problem with the movie is one common to older foreign films. 
The subtitles are the traditional yellow, but they're in a large and 
difficult to read font. If a character says more than two lines of dialogue, 
it ends up filling the bottom third of the screen. To compensate, the words 
move very quickly, often too fast to read. This is really a shame because 
there is some beautiful framing. Parts of the movie, especially the 
beginning, are just gorgeous. The scenery is constantly changing and we get a 
good view of the character surroundings every time. There's also some very 
enjoyable singing.
The flashback format works for the movie, and it never gets confusing. 
Gabriel Axel wisely takes the background information from Isak Dinesen's 
novel and uses it to his advantage. He makes sure we know the people onscreen 
before they get put into an awkward situation. The performances are 
excellent, and I particularly like Audran and Lafont. Audran makes Babette an 
almost mysterious individual who always seems like she knows something or has 
something to say that she's not divulging. Lafont portrays a tender Achille 
Papin, a famous man who doesn't seem like he wants celebrity. While it 
languishes a bit, Babette's Feast is never boring. There's always something 
going on that's entertaining regardless of what it sounds like from the video 
box.

Title
Review for Cité des enfants perdus, La (1995)
I am constantly intrigued by how different films are in all of the countries
around the world. The entire universe is bursting with talent and the most
gifted filmmakers may not live on this continent. Several recent imports have
supported this theory, but the statement also holds true for a handful of video
releases. This is the case with The City of Lost Children. The City of Lost
Children is one of those movies that is so incredibly strange, so extremely
bizarre, that it takes two or three viewings to fully grasp the plot and the
ending. Some of the most amazing art and set direction as well as
cinematography is present here from the directors of the cannibal film
Delicatessen. From the beginning of the film to the very last frame we are
assaulted with astoundingly beautiful images that make up for the lack of a
comprehensible storyline. If you don't get what the film is about, don't worry,
just read my summary carefully again.
Krank (Daniel Emilfork) is a professor who is tormented because he cannot
dream. He has assembled a laboratory in the middle of the ocean to test
children and sees if he can figure out what makes them dream. He has many blind
henchmen who steal children for him so that they can be tested. He is assisted
by a group of wacky brothers (who are all clones of each other) and by his wife
who he accidentally shrunk into a midget. 
One day Denree (Joseph Lucien), a little boy, is stolen by Krank and sent to
his laboratory. Denree's huge big brother (Perlman), who is a circus strongman,
tries to go after him and get him back. On his journey, he makes friends with
Miette. She is a girl who is the head of a group of children who steals jewels
and other valuables for a pair of conjoined twins who run a city orphanage. The
two begin to form an unlikely bond (as it's what always happens in films) and
the two are faced with several life or death situations. There's a subplot
involving which one of Krank's clones is the original copy, and that leads to
an interesting set of events near the ending. This turn of events will take
more than a couple of viewings to get. Sound complicated? It is. But aren't all
films from foreign countries?
The visual world that envelops you in The City of Lost Children is amazing.
This is helped by an extremely original (if hard to get) script that was
written by Gilles Adrien and Jean-Pierre Jeunet. It's at quite a different pace
then most French films, and definitely at a different tone than anything from
Delicatessen. However, despite some creepy performances (Genevieve Brunet and
Odile Mallet are perfection in their affecting Siamese twin role) and a
wonderful sense of atmosphere, there isn't much left in the film. Ron Perlman
plays the lead character without any showing acting ability whatsoever. From
the beginning of the film we instantly do not like him and thus make it hard
for us to care about anything that happens to him throughout the rest of the
movie. Miette is also a weak link. Young Vittet is good in the role, but she's
so tough and self dependent that it's hard to find what she sees in him. A nice
movie to look and marvel at, but lacking in story and likable characters, The
City of Lost Children gets *** stars.
ADDITIONAL NOTE: If you rent the film, make sure that you get the subtitled and
not the dubbed version. The dubbed version has voices that are very hard to
understand and takes away from the unique performances in the film.
The Young-Uns: Two acts of violence are almost seen. (For instance, a man is
shown holding a knife in front of another man's eye with the intent on stabbing
him, but the camera cuts away and all we hear is a scream.) Besides the fact
that it's extremely bizarre, there is also some brief drug use. Good Age: 14 &

Review for King Cobra (1999)
I have a weakness. There is something about watching (and renting) a movie that
you know is going to be bad to begin with and then watching it for the pure
pleasure of laughing at the bad acting, the poorly written script, and the
inane plot sequences. King Cobra is a straight to video release that markets
itself as "Thirty feet of pure terror!" with a mutated snake mix of Eastern
Diamondback and a cobra. King Cobra is everything that it promises to be: bad,
stupid, silly, cliched, etc., etc., etc. To help you through this review, I
will be listing the amount of cliches that we've all seen in other movies.
During a freak laboratory explosion (cliche #1) a extremely dangerous species
of snake (cliche #2) escapes to a peaceful small town (cliche #3.) Breeding
with one of the snakes there, (cliche #4) as it begins to reek a new kind of
terror (cliche #5) and bite everyone in sight (cliche #6.) So it's up to the
town's good looking doctor (cliche #7) to save everyone from the snake.
The film even features the biggest creature feature cliche of all: "Oh darling,
let's make sweet, passionate love in the forest. I hear something that sounds
like rattling, let's go. OK, I'm sure your right, it's nothing to worry about.
Even though the last three people to hear snakes rattling died of snake venom I
still want to make sweet, passionate love in the forest." (cliche #8.)
The film is full of all of these fun cliches, and it's fun to see where it
turns. The film does have some suprising twists though, Pat Morita (obviously
doing this film for the work) turns up late in the picture as a snake expert
that has to inject hinself with snake venom monthly to make his blood an
anti-venom and poor Erik Estrada makes an extremely bad and embarrassing cameo
as the town's homosexual Richard Simmons type fitness guru. King Cobra also
features some good special effects and some effective jump scenes that are
surprising in the midst of this otherwise horrible production. So if your
looking for a fun film to watch and make fun of, rent King Cobra which gets **
stars.

is spurted all over his guest room, but there is a black map tacked onto his
door. So Richard invites a French couple who he heard having sex the previous
evening to come to the island with him for an adventure. 
After a long swim, and some careful navigation through a field, they find a
tropical paradise. Everyone that lives there is scantily clad, they all have
perfect bodies, and they smoke weed all day. Soon Leo begins a love affair (or
in this movie's idea of love, a sex affair) with Francoise (Ledoyen), the
female of the French couple that have split up. But everyone knows that there
can't be a movie where no trouble lies in paradise. There is one rule for
living on the island, since fields of growing drugs sit on the other half of
the land mass, the farmers there demand that no new people come to live there,
so that the secret doesn't get out. You can never, ever, ever tell anyone about
this place. Before Richard left for the beach, he copied the map Daffy gave him
and gave it to two junkies at his hotel, and when he goes back to the city he
meets them again, and finds out they plan to for a visit. Big mistake.
There are several implausibilites that are in this film. The first has to be
that all members of the island, whether it be the evil Thai druglords or
Francoise, all speak perfect English. Another problem deals with a shark attack
when someone was swimming near the beach, and don't even get me started on the
Leo 64 video game sequence. The movie is filled with countless amounts of
uneeded material and dialog. Only about half of the film's two hour running
time has anything to do with how the film ends, and it's message to the youth
of America (it's obvious audience). This makes it a bore to sit through,
specifically when Leo decends into some type of madness in the second half. Oh,
and did I mention, everyone there has enough clothes to last them their entire
stay.
Even movies with a bad plot and redundant scenes can sometimes be saved by
great acting. There's none of that to be found here though. Richard changes
moods too quickly, one time he's brooding about his life and is depressed, the
next he's a pathological liar who is trying to save himself from danger.
Besides, we don't see Leo do much except for that squint he always uses. The
chemistry between him and Ledoyen is nowhere to be found and the two aren't
very interesting as people, or as lovers, for us to care much about them. In
fact, almost all of the characters are surprisingly dull and the adapted script
by John Hodge doesn't let them reach the potential that they could have been.
The only marginally good performance comes from Robert Carlyle who makes us
sort of like the creepy Daffy, while still being on our edge. But never mind
him, he's only on screen for five minutes, this is Leo's picture. The ending is
also happens to be remarkably snooze worthy and is an uninventive way to end
the film. The only good thing this movie does, is to encourage hardcore Leo
fans to see it again and again. Leo is shirtless for almost the entire duration
of the picture, and it's a great treat, but not if you're a guy like me. The
soundtrack is also kind of cool, but I'd hate to give the movie more credit
than it deserves. Leo, you're a good actor, next time, if you're still around,
please be in a good movie, and keep your shirt on too.

Review for Mission: Impossible II (2000)
Mission: Impossible 2 opens with a thrilling plane crash that employs the 
classic use of masks from the television show and last movie. It gave me high 
hopes for a thrilling sequel, but when the movie approached its conclusion, I 
realized it had cheated me out of any real human emotion. The occasional, 
"That was cool!" escaped my lips, but as the film droned on, even those got 
fewer and farther in between. This is the problem at the core of this 
mission. The characters are virtually cardboard cutouts with the amazing 
ability to walk, talk, develop toned muscles, and wear outfits with maximum 
cleavage. They're like those cardboard standups you find at party stores of 
Marilyn Monroe and James Dean, and their reactions are just the same. 
Our hero, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), gets assigned to stop a virus that causes 
rapid cell destruction, killing anyone injected with it after twenty hours. 
He must get thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton, little known to most, unless you 
saw Beloved or Besieged) to join the impossible team. Within fifteen minutes 
of the movie's running time the two have already slept together. He woos Nyah 
(no pun intended) with lines like, "Damn you're beautiful." The team, which 
also includes Luther Stickell, Ving Rhames's character from the last movie, 
must stop the virus from getting into the hands of evil agent Ambrose 
(Dougray Scott). Ambrose wants to buy stock in the company with virus's 
antidote. Then he would cause an outbreak of the disease, making his stock 
skyrocket to millions of dollars. The commercials for this movie should have 
foreshadowed the long and usually bloody action scenes that follow. All of 
these scenes involve Tom and his bulging muscles with Thandie looking 
doe-eyed, helpless, and dependent on Tom for her every need and desire. Also 
popping up for a couple of scenes is Anthony Hopkins who I think is just 
starting to get pretty darn annoying.
While the above plot outline may not sound complex, the plot the movie 
presents you with is. Like too many action and horror movies, the characters 
grasp things too quickly as if someone were explaining to them what had just 
happened, and how to fix it. Often, this loses the audience. A couple of 
times in the movie, a Russian doctor tells Hunt that their situation isn't 
that complicated. All I was thinking about shouting back to the screen was, 
"Yes! It is!" Other things I contemplated shouting mainly involved the 
stupidity of the characters and the cheesy dialogue uttered. Another problem 
with this sequel (and to a lesser degree the previous film) is that it really 
has nothing to do with the original Mission: Impossible television show. I 
watched a couple of old episodes of the program after seeing this movie, and 
I couldn't find any resemblance between the two at all. This is basically a 
big stupid action movie operating under the show's name, music, and mask use. 
The masks are overdone as well, to the point where they just get too 
predictable. Also missing is the use of cool, complicated gadgets. The team 
uses a variety of high tech devices like digital cameras and GPS tracking 
systems. Both of which got introduced at least two years ago and have already 
become integrated into the more techno savvy homes in America. Did the team 
lose the pack of exploding gum? 
To be honest, Mission: Impossible 2 isn't an entirely bad film. There are 
some effective stunts, especially near the end, that obviously originate from 
famous action director John Woo. However, by the time the film got to the 
level of action expected, I was too mindless from the previous proceedings to 
care. It's really disappointing when talented actors like these can't pull a 
movie off. Tom Cruise proved he can still act with his Oscar nomination for 
Magnolia, but that film gets forgotten quickly. Likewise, Thandie Newton, who 
I loved in Besieged, ends up looking like a three year-old baby doll. 
So buy the biggest popcorn available, and get that extra large drink. They'll 
be your only reliable companions through the world of stupidity that is 
Mission: Impossible 2.

Title
Review for Mononoke Hime (1997)
Japanese anime is a world of film that has been limited to obscure video store
shelves for far too long. The stunning detail that is in each cell of animation
cannot possibly be appreciated, or given the proper gratitude, by watching an
anime film on video. Recently, one of the first anime films to be released in a
while Perfect Blue was released into theaters. It did very good business and
opened the door right up for this animation classic. Princess Mononoke
(Mononoke Hime in Japan) was the biggest grossing animated film of all time in
Japan. Now with the help of English actors for the voices, it’s ready to set
sail across the ocean for the viewing pleasure of everyone who enjoys anime or
cinema in general. 
Ashitaka is a warrior who has been put under a curse by the forest God. It
leaves an ugly looking purple gash on his arm that will continue to grow until
it envelops his entire body, and then it will kill him. The elderly woman of
the village says that if he goes to the forest of the forest Gods that he may
be able to have the curse lifted. So off he goes riding into the forest until
he reaches the pool of the forest God. Nearby there is a mining colony called
Irontown led by Lady Eboshi. She wants to hunt and kill the forest God because
all of the animals that she kills and all of the trees that she cuts down are
being re-planted by people of the forest. If she kills him, all forest Gods
will become mortal again and will be easily killed.
He also meets Princess Mononoke. She lives with an extremely large wolf pack
and is trying to save the forest. Her destiny is to kill Lady Eboshi to save
the forest and all of the animals living in it. A tribe of boars also enters
the picture when they decide to charge and kill Lady Eboshi and her men. 
Princess Mononoke is worth seeing three or four times just to look at the
beautifully drawn animation. No detail was spared, in scenes where Ashitake
runs through the forest all of the shadows of the trees and branches are
perfectly laid out to where they would be in real life. The forest God is
quirky and cool looking and you don't even want to get me started about what it
looks like when people are engulfed with hate. The expressions on the
characters' faces make up for the usual lack of good dubbing. What a bad job it
is! Many people I talked to thought (and I agree with them) that while watching
the film, it’s painfully obvious which American celebrities are doing the
voices. Why not have Japanese people do the voices for the English version of
the film? It would sound a lot better and more authentic. While the storyline
sounds complicated, it’s not that hard to get. Besides, if you get lost there
is always the animation to look at. Mononoke has a great message, and the
premise of trying to balance nature with production to work together to form a
better economy is a great lesson. Especially for some construction workers who
treat trees as things that exist only for them to chop down. The ending is also
slightly confusing, but I won’t give anything else away. If you are fortunate
enough to have Princess Mononoke to be at a theater near you, go and see it. If
not, rent it on video and watch it on a really big screen. This animation
classic gets **** stars.
The Young-Uns: Several soldiers get either their arms or heads chopped off, but
it’s usually shown at a distance. (Remember this film is animated) there is
also some very scary looking boars and some mild language. Good Age 12 & Up

Review for Evil Dead, The (1982)
Stephen King said The Evil Dead was, "The most ferociously original horror 
movie I have ever seen." The author supported this film, and helped it to 
become the cult classic it is now. Two sequels, Evil Dead II and Army of 
Darkness followed in later years. So what does the original have going for 
it, besides a rave from a horror novelist? It has nothing, nothing at all. 
It's just a by-the-numbers horror picture. The type a Scream movie destroys 
with delicious malice.
A group of teens head out to a remote cabin in the mountains. Their plans for 
endless midnight orgies and marijuana highs get put on hold by their 
lodging's creepy aura. After some investigation, they find the cottage used 
to be a lab for a scary professor. He discovered the Book of the Dead, a 
publication that puts a curse on whoever reads it. The only way to break the 
hex is by dismembering the victim. Our hero, Ash (Bruce Campbell), reads the 
book, unaware of its power. Soon his friends are turning into zombies and 
chasing him through the house. It seems doubtful Ash has what it takes to 
stay alive, and cut up his former pals.
This is a movie that puts recent supposedly violent flicks like The Cell to 
shame. If you cannot handle a large, continuous amount of gore, this is not 
for you. The blood is extremely frequent and bursts out often. Prepare to see 
pencils, knives, clocks, chainsaws, trees, and more all used as weapons of 
destruction. Just because the carnage is excessive doesn't mean it's 
realistic. From first to last frame this is obviously a student film. The 
blood often looks like badly colored water. Clay gets employed near the end 
for beheadings, flesh explosions, and other bodily mishaps. Prepare not to 
eat oatmeal for a long time. Prepare to never look at trees the same way 
again. Despite the bloodshed, there is some nice composition in the first 
half an hour or so. After which the cinematography tries to follow two simple 
questions. Can the camera get closer? and Can we make it seem bloodier? 
Head out into the woods with some of the worst actors and least intelligent 
human beings ever. Overused, supposedly ominous music is your guide through 
the forest of an '80s Blair Witch. This overly gross gorefest is slightly 
scary about once, somewhere between zombie one's face being blown off and 
zombie two's foot being severed. It is occasionally good for a laugh, but 
director Sam Raimi tries too hard. 
The sequels fared much better than this movie, which many consider inferior. 
Yet I really had to ask myself whether I would survive two more Evil Dead 
movies. My unsettled stomach screams no.

Review for Plata quemada (2000)
2000 - Argentina 
Director: Marcelo Pińeyro 
Starring: Eduardo Noriega, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Pablo Echarri, Leticia Brédice 
Burnt Money is the perfect festival film. It will show once or twice, and 
then no one, thankfully, will ever have to hear from it again. This film from 
the Seattle International Film Festival 2001's Emerging Masters series is 
easily one of the year's worst. Billed as a gay `Bonnie and Clyde', this 
gritty film from director Marcelo Pińeyro has its only highlight in a 
well-designed title sequence. 
Two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader, whose 
plan they screwed up, angry. This causes the gang leader to send his boys out 
to get the gay guys, one of whom may not actually be gay. Hiding out in a 
prostitute's apartment, the two men must fight off police and gang members in 
a very long showdown for the movie's conclusion. If caught, they risk losing 
all the money, and their love. As an added emotional bonus, one of the gay 
men is dying. 
Or something like that. Everything that happens is so quick and confusing I 
was completely lost. Clarity isn't exactly this movie's striving virtue, so 
it was a little hard to pick up. Not much could have really happened though. 
The main events in this long two-hour film are explicit homosexual and 
heterosexual sex, graphic drug use, extreme violence, and strong language. 
Lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there's a reason, but 
there's no purpose to anything in this film. Most of the sex and violence 
scenes come off as silly, while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous 
and depressing. It appears Pińeyro (who co-wrote with Marcelo Figueras, from 
a novel by Ricardo Piglia) purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for 
his own amusement. He makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible, makes 
them snort cocaine, gives them guns and condoms, and lets them go. 
Burnt Money is pointless. The performances are bad. It tries to thrill and 
shock, but only causes boredom. God forbid it will ever get a distributor. 
Another disappointing film from this year's so-called Emerging Masters 
series. Pass on by.

Review for Arachnophobia (1990)
The back of the video box for Arachnophobia is deceiving. It markets itself as
a horror movie with a comedic side and it's anything but that. What begins as a
cool idea for a horror movie (out in the tropical rainforest) trying to find
old species of spiders and other creepy crawlies (OK, I admit that word is
extremely hokey.) But once the film gets off to it's interesting start, and the
story is set up, it's all down hill from there.
Ross (Daniels in one of his non-comedic roles) and Molly (Jane Kozak) have just
moved to a lovely small town in California from San Francisco. But he's
frightened when his wife shows him a huge spider web in their barn because he's
an arachnophobic, someone who is afraid of spiders. He's destined to become the
local doctor when the town's current doctor retires, but when he decides not to
throw in the towel yet, his job is insecure. When a throws a party for everyone
in the town and someone is killed shortly thereafter he begins to wonder.
Naturally the spiders take over, killing and sucking the blood of all of the
surrounding areas from their house. A spider from South America and a domestic
house spider have bred a whole new deadly species who's headquarters is in
Ross's barn. It takes them more than three fourths of the movie to figure this
out, but the movie shows you the solution in minutes.
While having it's creepy moments, Arachnophobia isn't that scary. Hollywood has
once again easily taken something that's almost harmless and turned it into the
evil villain. Everyone in the film realizes that they are in a cheesy movie and
they pretty much play it to the limit. The film isn't funny at all (but the
video package won't tell you that.) If you enjoy a film that will have you
checking your bed, shower, or other household appliances for weeks, rent
Arachnophobia which gets * 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains some brief graphic spider bites and related
goo and gore. It also contains some language. Good Age: 10 & Up, if they can
handle spiders

Title
Review for Ghosts of Mississippi (1996)
The creepy Byron de la Beckwith (played extremely well by James Woods who got
an Oscar nomination) kills civil rights leader Medger Evers in his own
driveway, that was in 1963. When he is put on trial he faces an all white, all
male jury, of course he doesn't get convicted (he was put on trial twice)
because the judge is the toughest and most racist judge in all of Mississippi.
Then, for some reason, his widow Myrlie Evers (Goldberg) decides that she wants
to re-open the case after all this time, it's 1989 now, and most people could
care less. But she soon forms a bond with Bobby DeLaughter (Baldwin) a lawyer
who pursues the case for over five years. His job is to track down witnesses
(most of them dead) and keep the case going even if no real evidence is found.
When he first views the case as, "the case we'll work on in his spare time" is
soon grows to become his obsession because "is it ever too late to do the right
thing?" He eventually gathers up enough evidence (with the help of William H.
Macy, god, is he like in every movie ever made or what?) and conjures up a new
trial.
The movie stretches on for too long, do you really need to see him find the KKK
members from long ago sitting in denim on a huge bale of hay? What about the
uneeded romance between him and a hospital worker? I suppose that this is
essential to painting a picture for what it was like long ago, but after a
while it gets boring. It could have easily been cute to about 95 or 105
minutes, which would have made it much more of a pleasureable experience. 
This isn't to say the movie isn't great. I was chilled and disgusted every time
Woods appeared on the screen. I would have loved to see more of his
performance. Goldberg is also good, it's amazing that she can still act after
appearing in so many stupid, screwball comedies. Plus the film is rated PG-13
so younger teens can see it, yes they will be bored out of their minds, but I
hope some parents force it upon their children to see this movie. It's a great
movie (and like the back of the video says) "that every American should see."
Overall, the movie is a long (but moving) experience, and I give it *** stars.

Title
Review for Iron Giant, The (1999)
Being released on the same weekend as five other new movies The Iron Giant is
and will become one of the best films you are not likely to see. It's a shame
that such a critically acclaimed movie can't do well at the box office, but the
public likes it's mainstream trash.
Hogarth Hughes is an adventurous young boy living in Rockwell, a cozy seaside
town in Maine. It's 1957 and Sputnik has just been sent into orbit by the
Russians, so when a crazed drunk is out on his boat and sees what he calls a
metal monster the townspeople joke around with him at first. When cars start
getting eaten, and power lines destroyed, the people begin to wonder.
When Kent Mansley (a government agent) comes to investigate he discovers
Hogarth's fake gun near the power plant and questions him about it, he says he
doesn't know anything but Mansley figures he knows more than he's letting on.
The truth is, Hogarth is hiding the robot at the local scrapyard where Dean
McCoppin, the owner, is keeping him hidden in a shed. He's beginning to form a
bond with the metal man and doesn't want to see him hurt. When Kent discovers
that there is a robot, he is scared it's from another country and is going to
annihilate us all, and he sends for reinforcements.
While bearing the strong resemblance to E.T., the film is still in a class of
it's own. Finally, an animated film with no songs, no fake love stories, and no
stupid sidekicks. Instead this is a wonderful film with a good message,
(putting in the fact that guns actually kill people is a great message for a
children's film) plus the film is filled with lots of gags and jokes aimed
directly at adults too. 
The film has received horrible box office earnings, and is likely to be put
with other critically loved comedies such as Rushmore, Election, Go, and Dick.
This is a magical film that can be viewed again and again. So what are you
waiting for? Go out and see this film now! Don't delay, call MoviePhone and get
tickets for The Iron Giant, which gets *** 1/2 stars.

Title
Review for Santitos (1997)
Watching Santitos is an uncomfortable experience because it is actually two 
radically different movies melded together. On one hand, it plays as a weepy 
drama about a mother losing her child, and her eventual recuperation. On the 
other, it is a Spanish Ealing comedy that comes complete with wrestling and 
prostitution elements. The big coincidence is that both films feature the 
same actors, and the screenplays written by the same writer. The director is 
identical as well. Separately, the duo might make for interesting shorts, but 
together they are a clunky mess that lumbers from start to finish.
Esperanza (Heredia) loses her only daughter, Blanca, to an unusual fatal 
virus. Doctors demand the teenage girl's body be sealed forever so the 
disease doesn't spread. After Blanca's death, Esperanza goes into a state of 
shock. She believes that her child isn't dead at all because Saint Jude 
appears to her in a dirty oven window and tells her so. This leads her to 
wonder, what if the doctors are lying? She never did see the body. Some way 
or another, this incoming information leads Esperanza into believing her 
daughter got kidnapped by men, who sold Blanca into prostitution in Tijuana. 
So she follows the supposed path of her daughter's travels. In desperation, 
Esperanza becomes a prostitute herself while continuing her adventure of 
hope. By the time she reaches Los Angeles to search, the film's ending 
becomes quite apparent. 
Although made in 1997, the plot for this movie sounds suspiciously like that 
of Nurse Betty's. A woman's only loved one dies, and her shock leads her to 
do outrageous things. It recalls major portions of several movies from the 
past few months. That this film was the inspiration for all of them is highly 
doubtful.
The unevenness starts with the script. A bunch of great, but unrelated story 
ideas make up the screenplay, and many of the scenes are very funny. It's not 
so much the dialogue that's the problem. It's more like the sequence of 
events. Character development is too sporadic, which is the same problem with 
the cinematography. Too many elements just appear to move the movie along. 
Esperanza just happens to pass by a wall with a colorful mural of the Virgin 
Mary on it. The benches of her hometown are, naturally, always perfectly 
color-coordinated. Late into the film, we also discover that Esperanza has a 
passion for wrestling. Who knew?
Editing is the next problem. This film is in Spanish, yet director Alejandro 
Springall choose an editor that didn't speak a word of the language. Not a 
good idea because this movie relies on moving from location to location with 
ease. Instead, the journey between locales is rocky. 
All of this is really a shame since Dolores Heredia gives such a good lead 
performance. She runs between every base the script requires her to cover 
with grace and skill. The fish out of water stuff that's common in small 
British comedies doesn't work for this movie, but she almost makes it work. 
Screenwriter Maria Amparo Escandon just can't stop. She has to ruin her main 
character, and the movie's sweetness by placing Esperanza in highly sexual 
and violent situations. An old brothel owner, whose gender is unidentifiable, 
is supposedly prime comic fodder. Just wait and see what he or she does in 
the room he or she forbids everyone in the joint from visiting. 
The final moments reveal a truly horrifying portion of this movie. Male 
guests can watch Esperanza changing and preparing herself through a camera in 
a Los Angeles brothel. The owner claims the invasion of privacy turns 
customers on. The Big Brother-esque moment gives the only truly genuine 
feeling in the film. 
This is a rare foreign movie in that you can tune it out easily, with little 
confusion about what's happening when you return. A sometimes hilarious film 
that's too disjointed for actual enjoyment, Santitos sours with an aftertaste 
of falsity and silliness.

Title
Review for Grass (1999)
This one-sided documentary is about marijuana's introduction and use in the 
United States in the 1990s. Brought over the border by Mexicans in the early 
part of the century, it was a joy for many. You could smoke it and escape 
your life, troubles, and problems. The stuff soon became so common you could 
find it on the side of the road. The government used marijuana as an excuse 
not to like Mexico. The Bureau of Narcotics formed shortly after some 
marijuana users turned violent. The head of the bureau launched several 
campaigns hoping to make marijuana as frowned upon as possible. More laws, 
restrictions, and programs popped up as time went on. Parents and worried 
officials wanted this stuff controlled. Several people thought it unfair that 
the government was creating laws that put innocent civilians who were just 
trying to relax in jail. Why should something enjoyable for most be illegal 
in the eyes of the law? The previous inquiry morphs into different forms as 
time and the film go on.
If I lived in the world that Grass presents, I would be an advocate to 
legalize marijuana too. This is certainly a bias documentary. The movie 
covers about eighty years of the drug, but skips over the 1980s and 1990s in 
approximately five minutes. It seems Grass covers only the periods where 
people lived in ignorance about the downsides from using the drug. There was 
always plenty of speculation from non-users about what would happen if a 
person took marijuana in the early days. A few of their fears were dispelled 
(or confirmed) after the first solid scientific research study on marijuana 
in the 1970s. Some of the best moments of the film are the official truths of 
the time. The truth, as issued by the government and accepted by non-users, 
flashes before each decade. Through the years, the government stopped saying 
marijuana would lead you to kill people, and started linking it as a 
stepping-stone to heroin abuse. 
If anything, Grass is certainly a lot of fun. Clips from movies like Reefer 
Madness really heighten the experience. Cheech & Chong show up, as does Cab 
Calloway and Sonny Bono. Even Elvis Presleyâs public service announcement 
discouraging drug use is included. There are some fantastic graphics and 
computer animated sequences that really help the movie. Whenever a law passes 
that is against marijuana, a disaster diagram (erupting volcanoes, spinning 
tornadoes, etc.) comes onscreen along with the name of the bill and the word, 
"PASSED." These types of pictures are always colorful and humorous. They 
capture the screw the government attitude adapted by most of the film.
Grass is essentially a piece of harmless propaganda. Hidden messages about 
legalizing marijuana lie under its surface. Most adults will not be 
susceptible to these, but it may influence some teens. It figures that Woody 
Harrelson narrates this film when one considers his work in attempting to 
legalize the Indian weed. Hypocrisy is present on both sides of the argument. 
One government official goes on about how bad drug addiction is while he 
continuously smokes a cigarette. Director Ron Mann never chooses to look at 
the devastating effects of the narcotic. Even so, the material presented is 
very interesting, and was certainly something I would not have pursued 
otherwise, and like some of the best documentaries, there are plenty of 
opportunities to laugh. 
Unless you can personally relate to Grass's subject, it is likely to have 
little impact. This picture certainly does not break any new ground, and 
rarely rises above the amusing level. If it were more thought provoking than 
rebellious, it would be much better. This easily forgettable movie entertains 
while its playing, but never reaches a high. It leaves little to take with 
you or remember. 

Title
Review for Red Dirt (1999)
Despite careful consideration I have still not decided whether Karen Black is 
more eccentric as her character in this movie, or in person. The mentally ill 
woman she portrays is certainly unique. She has her quirks, but most of them 
are strangely charming, or don't seem to matter. Later discussion led me to 
believe Ms. Black got a large amount of sugar to consume during the movie. 
Regardless, her Aunt Summer is the only thing that keeps this movie going. 
Without her, this movie would be a dreary mess with no purpose whatsoever. 
Scenes sans Aunt Summer made me want to fall asleep, the phrase, "wake me 
when it's over" comes to mind. Red Dirt is way too slow to be much of 
anything, and I saw no real point in it being made. While director and writer 
Tag Purvis is homosexual, the movie isn't autobiographical, so what was its 
purpose? Before I continue, let me tell you the dismal world these people 
live in. 
Griffith (Dan Montgomery) and Emily (Aleksa Palladino) are two teenage 
cousins living in Pine Apple, Mississippi. The fact that they are cousins 
doesn't stop them from leisurely completing daily activities nude or 
discourages them from taking frequent tumbles in the hay. Their mothers might 
be their sisters, and their sisters might be their mothers. The whole concept 
doesn't bother them a bit. Living with the two is crazy Aunt Summer (the 
aforementioned Karen Black) who paces the house daily and knits while 
listening to old music on her record player. Griffith is responsible for 
Summer while Emily shows little interest in her or in Lynn Thomas (Peg 
O'Keef) the woman who is supposedly their real mother. Handsome wayfarer Lee 
Todd (Walton Goggins) comes into town and rents out a nearby cottage, 
Griffith and Lee soon become friends. As the film progresses, it gradually 
becomes clear that Griffith and Lee are forming a romantic relationship. This 
sets off Emily who begins to spend more time with Aunt Summer. All characters 
must face the horrors of their way of life and the town they live in. The 
question becomes whether Griffith and Lee will live (as best put by an 
audience member) gayily ever after.
The subject matter of repressed homosexuality and teenage confusion are 
anything but light. However, the film only features them when it wants to. 
Scenes that show up to extend the running time happen often. It's obvious 
that Griffith and Lee like each other from the beginning. Near the middle of 
the film I was mentally goading the two on, wishing they would just kiss and 
get it over with. Aunt Summer is the only person confused for a reason. 
Perhaps this isn't fair to the characters. It's scientifically proven that we 
accept the world we are born into, and I can see why Griffith gets so 
distressed by, and later rejects his sexual preference. While more apparent 
in novels like To Kill A Mockingbird, the idea that the American south is an 
entirely different world within a vastly different country doesn't get 
presented well. Lackluster performances are all around. Aleksa Palladino (who 
played a somewhat similar role in The Adventures of Sebastian Cole), and 
Karen Black are only slightly better than their castmates. Dan Montgomery's 
mediocre Griffith becomes annoying and nude scene after nude scene I couldn't 
help wondering if the actor got chosen for his body rather than his acting 
skills.
Red Dirt does manage to be quite a beautiful movie. Purvis's writing chops 
arenât perfect, but the man does have a keen visual eye. There are some 
gorgeous shots that are simply stunning. Purvis would most likely do wonders 
with the right material, but this is just too depressing and boring to be 
anything worth recommending. 
I think the answer to my question about Karen Black just popped up. If I had 
to work on such a somber movie for a few months, I'd be taking some sugar too.

Review for Blazing Saddles (1974)
What may be funny to one generation may not be funny to the get one. This goes
for several old films that had current humor that made fun of politics and
events going on at the time. I also imagine that this will happen with several
of the comedies that are being released in the 90s. The thing that's really
interesting is to see how our country has progressed over the years, how things
and attitudes towards people change, and how this is reflected in modern film.
This was the feeling that I got while watching Blazing Saddles, a film that,
when released 1974 probably didn't open to any protest or controversy, but
today would cause great destruction and cause much debate. Black people, the
gay community, women, Indians, there aren't very many people that this film
misses in offending. With all of the offending material should it still be
considered a classic? That's up for you to decide...
Hedley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) is the a wealthy man who wants the area
surrounding the town of Rock Ridge. He wants it because new train tracks are
being put in that area and he wants to cash in on the benefits of having his
own businesses at the train station. His trouble comes in thinking up a way to
scare the people living in Rock Ridge out of town. He can't come up with
anything good until the governor helps him, and the two come up with a
brilliant plan. So he sends a black sheriff named Bart (referred to as nothing
but the n-word here) thinking that all of the townspeople will be so horrified
that they will move far, far away. He's not accepted very well, but some of the
townspeople soon begin to gain his trust. Bart is just too clever to fall for
any of the schemes that Hedley uses to try and get the land. 
When they receive word that Lamarr is rounding up all of the thieves,
cutthroats, and plunderers he can find to form an army and destroy Rock Ridge,
they must come up with a plan. All of the members of the army are pretty stupid
and they easily escape, but not without a few twists and turns. The ending is
so bizarre that you may have to watch it two, even three times to fully grasp
what happens in the end. 
This film is a fine example of how America has changed its beliefs about people
who are different in the past 25 years. It's amazing to think that blacks,
women, homosexuals, and Native Americans were poked so hard at, and so brutally
abused just 25 years ago. Even my parents (who viewed the film with me) were
surprised at some of the things they said and did. On a lighter note, much of
the comedy (while very dark, or very offending) is pretty funny. Gene Wilder
makes an appearance as The Waco Kid, whose hands are quicker than lightning,
and Mel Brooks plays his usual crazy assorted characters. The plot however
wears thin near the end, and the madcap ending isn't very satisfying. While
some will consider it a classic, I don't think it's anywhere near Brooks' best
work. The offending, but funny Blazing Saddles gets ** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains lots of sexual comments including two women
who pretty much give themselves up to any man. The film is filled to the brim
with racism, homophobia, and misogyny. Some language and mild violence also
occur. Good Age: 13 & Up, but only if they know the way the characters treat
each other is not the way to treat someone today.

Title
Review for Twin Falls Idaho (1999)
Twin Falls Idaho is certainly deserving of its private section at the video 
store. There has never been a movie quite like this one. It is a drama, but a 
unique one that will only settle right with a certain audience. Nothing is 
more unusual or extraordinary than the two stars who created this film. Blake 
(Mark Polish) and Francis (Michael Polish) are conjoined twins. Since 
conjoined (or Siamese) babies rarely live long, it is amazing that Blake and 
Francis have made it to their mid-twenties. They live a life where they must 
depend on each other for everything. The mere sight of them sends most people 
running and screaming into their world of normalcy and ignorance. Penny 
(Michele Hicks) is a prostitute that at first runs away when meeting Blake 
and Francis. Soon her conscience catches up with her, and she begins caring 
for the two. There is a growing attraction between Blake and Penny, and the 
two soon fall in love. Francis, however, despises Penny. The tragedy 
continues as Francis's situation worsens. One twin usually provides the life 
support for another, and Blake has always given his brother a strong heart. 
Despite this, Francis is getting weaker and weaker. This leaves Blake with a 
decision. He could die with his brother as he promised, or participate in 
separation surgery and spend the rest of his life with the woman he loves.
That is certainly a dramatic plot if I have ever seen one. One inconsiderate, 
stereotypical gay character aside, there is a drought of needed comedy. 
Nothing was there to lighten things up in the slightest. At first the 
haunting musical score and dreary plot are endurable. Michael and Mark Polish 
are dexterous as filmmakers and actors. Each has a remarkable range of 
emotions, and show true skill. I cannot wait to see what they do next. 
Newcomer Michele Hicks turns in a great performance as well. Her Penny is 
always believable and  mostly pure. The visual style of the movie fits well 
with the subject matter. The camera seems permanently tinted with dark blues, 
greens, and black. These colors also fill most of the images onscreen and set 
the somber mood. The script, written by the brothers, falters. Its first half 
is agreeable, after that point it gets increasingly gloomy. It keeps going 
downhill until it becomes what is essentially a well-acted soap opera. This 
is very bleak stuff. Add an ending that lacks closure, and you have a movie 
with an inferior second half that outweighs its superior first half. 
Before viewing this slow and disheartening movie, try taking a dose of Prozac 
mixed with caffeine. This statement should not indicate this is a bad film, 
just one that conjures up assorted feelings depending on the mood of the 
viewer. Twin Falls Idaho is unique in so many ways. It is also very 
depressing, and reminds us to be thankful for the simplest things we take for 
granted. The movie is a mixed bag. Some should move on, while it is 
recommendable for others.

Title
Review for Judy Berlin (1999)
One of the characters in Judy Berlin describes a movie he is planning to make.
It's going to be about the town he grew up in, and it's not going to have a
plot. All of the people, their actions, and all of the things in the town will
make up the movie, and they will be interesting just because they exist in real
life. Quite an ambitious plan for a film. It's what director Eric Mendelsohn
does with his marvelous little black and white movie. Plotlines are very loose
in Judy Berlin, and indeed the characters actions are sometimes meaningless,
but they are always interesting. The entire movie is so surreal that it will
captivate you, and might even make you think. 
On the day of a solar eclipse, Judy Berlin (Edie Falco from The Sopranos) a
geeky, but goodhearted woman with braces is planning to leave for Los Angeles
to became an actress. She meets old high school crush David Gold (Aaron
Harnick) and the two spend the day looking back and forward at the past,
present, and future. David's mother Alice (the late Madeline Khan in her last
performance) roams her home street with her housekeeper pretending to be an
astronaut during the eclipse. Judy's mother Sue (Barbara Barrie) is a preschool
teacher watching the eclipse with her students, earlier she is frightened by a
former sweet old teacher who is losing her memory. She also seems interested in
David's father Arthur, even though he's married. All of the character's are in
some way related, and their plights (whether large or small) make for one of
the most fascinating, entertaining, and best pictures of the year. While others
will dislike the movie, possibly because it isn't really about anything, (and
they're right), I really felt drawn to the situation.
The superb screenplay written by director Mendelsohn really propels this movie.
It captures those strange moments of life when you're on your edge, or someone
surprises you, and finds humor in them. David discovers a different old friend
that hasn't changed since high school, and Alice visits a woman across the
street who claims she called her in an angry rage, but she doesn't remember a
thing. Both Berlins are gentle and vulnerable, indeed the movie seems sprinkled
with some type of sweetness that is almost nonexistent in modern day film. The
fact that Judy Berlin is a very small, and a (most likely) narrow audience
movie, will put it in few theaters. The Shooting Gallery adopted it as it's
opening film in their annual festival, but the movie isn't likely to get any
more of a release. Hopefully video will be a place for this movie to blossom.
It's really a shame though. The black and white is more suited for the big
screen. The contrast of colors in the images (attempted or not) is striking, a
large group of stills from the film would make a stunning collection of black
and white photography. Every one of the actors does a marvelous job, there is
so much talent in the performers, that it's just one of the many reasons to see
this movie two or three times. An honestly endearing film that transports us to
a mix between a real and fantasy world. I can't quite explain it, but this
movie struck such a chord with me that I'm ready to name it one of the best
pictures in several years. This movie about nothing, is certainly something.
Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail said, "All of these little nothings have meant more
to me than all the somethings before." If she were describing this movie, she
would be very, very right.

Title
Review for Blue Streak (1999)
For being an early fall movie, Blue Streak strikes quite a few resemblances.
Obviously, there's the Beverly Hills Cop factor, which seems to supply most of
the action plot, and fast-talking bad-mouthed African-Americans to this movie.
Then there's Rush Hour who teamed up the unlikely pair of Chris Tucker (Martin
Lawrence in this picture) and Luke Wilson (an interesting choice.) While the
movie leans heavily on the success of these pictures, it isn't as funny or no
where near as good as the other two.
Miles Logan (Lawrence, jumpstarting his career again and making a big comeback)
is a jewel thief who happens to hide his rock while being chased by the police
in the third floor of a soon-to-be-constructed building. When he is released
from jail two years later, he discovers that the building he hid it in is now
the Los Angeles police department. When trying to sneak in as a pizza delivery
man doesn't work, he hires a friend to make him a fake badge so he can go in
and retrieve his prize.
But when he tries to enter the vent (where he hid it) through the ladies
restroom, he accidentially captures a criminal that was about to escape. The
chief notices his skills immediately and soon makes him the head of burglary.
Teaming him up with Carlson, (Wilson) a cop who he's supposed to help (he
recently got promoted) he must fight crime on the streets.
Eventually one things leads to another and Miles has to get his diamond from a
big package of heroin that an evil drug lord has. Will he save the day? Will he
get caught? These are all shocking questions...
You might as well just watch the trailer for Blue Streak, it shows everything
that's funny and action-packed in the movie. The rest is full of stupid scenes
that we're supposed to laugh at that are too much like the two films that I
mention earlier. The film's ending is not exactly a stroke of genius either.
Lawrence is good, I especially liked him as the pizza delivery man, and I'm
sure that he'll be appearing in more comedies soon. As for the rest of the cast
(including the usually good Wilson,) they are cast aside as this is obviously
Martin's picture. Just a so-so rating for Blue Streak, which gets ** stars.

action and innuendo. Good Age: 13 & Up

Review for Enemy at the Gates (2001)
2001  Germany/Ireland/UK/USA
Director: Jean-Jacques Annaud
Starring: Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris, Ron Perlman, Bob
Hoskins
In `Enemy at the Gates', Jude Law is a gifted Russian sniper made hero by a
political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) who uses him in a propaganda
newspaper to raise the hopes of the soldiers and people of Stalingrad. It's
World War II, and the Russian-German standoff in town could determine the
outcome of things for the motherland. Law's Vassili is the Russian's top pawn to
victory. Lots of war stuff happens. An older, German version of Jude's character
played by Ed Harris shows up halfway into the proceedings. He's equally
talented, and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other.
They constantly switch roles, as the war fades far into the background. The cast
also includes the terrific Rachel Weisz as a love interest for both Vassili and
Danilov
The set-up is decent, and so are the production values. Boasting a wide range of
grimy locales, greasy hair, and tattered costumes, the art direction prospers.
The actors, however, suffer the problem Matt Damon had in `Saving Private Ryan'.
Either their eyes, teeth, skin, or a combination of other features looked too
white and clean. With dirt and blood all around, the blinding teeth or bright
eyes of these actors divert attention from the action. That said, the players
are mostly good in their roles, although I don't think Ed Harris was really
trying. Maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one-notedom.
While the film is technically about snipers, there are far too many predictable
sniping scenes. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud expects us to view each tense
situation with Jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting, but
after about the sixth time, in which we realize that Jude is not going to die,
it's relatively pointless. We get that he's talented, okay, let's move on.
That's the problem with `Enemy at the Gates'; it just doesn't know when to stop.
Witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere.
Reestablishing his title as the most beautiful (and often talented) man on film,
Jude Law carries the movie. Without him, this costly production would have gone
into the ground. The story and acting are of good quality, but there's never a
sense of authenticity or reality. Something about this war movie is undeniably
modern, and it loses its feeling. Strange enough, the screenplay is based on the
true story of a real Russian sniper.

Review for Keeping the Faith (2000)
Turning a funny joke or situation into a movie often turns into a failure.
Recent Saturday Night Live movies (Superstar, A Night At The Roxbury) that were
based on short, 5 to 10 minute skits were painfully boring and unfunny. Most
people have heard the, "A priest and a rabbi walk into a bar" jokes, and some
are mildly amused, but this joke is stretched over a two hour plus movie
canvas. How long could the joke possibly last? Surprisingly, it sustains the
running time, and remains worthy of attention, even if the film is too long. 
Brian, the priest (Norton, also making his directorial debut with this film),
and the rabbi Jake (Stiller, of Mystery Men and There's Something About Mary),
are excited when old middle school friend Anna (Dharma and Greg's Jenna
Elfman), is coming to visit them in New York. Both of them had crushes on her
in middle school. Her flame rekindles itself in both men.  Jake, whose been on
one too many blind dates set up for him by women from his congregation quickly
falls for Anna the moment she steps off the plane. Brian feels passionate about
someone for the first time since he became a priest. Anna is a workaholic who
states that she has a relationship with her phone ("We just have this vibe
together") and is very charismatic and flirtatious with the two of them. She
wants to continue the friendly relations between them, even if Jake and Brian's
hearts say otherwise. Anna falls in love with one of them, but which one, and
how that affects the other, you'll have to see for yourself. That's it. The
story is pretty simple, and the priest is the only one who ever walks into a
bar. 
There is very little in Keeping The Faith to offend either one of the religions
featured. The movie tries hard to be inoffensive and appealing and does a great
job at both. This is truly, as Norton described in an interview, "A movie I
could take my grandma to." But would grandma stay awake? At 127 minutes Faith
clocks in at an unusually long running time for a romantic comedy, and the
movie really suffers from being that long. A half hour could have easily been
shaved off of the movie, which would have made it much more enjoyable. It
wouldn't seem nearly as slow when it gradually turns from a comedy to a full
out romance at about the half way mark. That said, the movie stays alive thanks
to great performances from it's three lead actors. Edward Norton proves time
and time again that he is a great actor with an amazing amount of versatility
and talent, Ben Stiller makes a good comeback from last year's unfunny
disappointment Mystery Men, and Jenna Elfman shows off more skill than her
Dharma role will probably ever let her. Also worth mentioning are Anne Bancroft
as Jake's overbearing mother and the over the top Ken Leung, who appears in two
scenes as a karaoke machine salesman and is the movie's biggest treat. There
are also some nice shots of New York City. Much of the humor is genuinely
funny, while a few jokes fall flat, the physical comedy found in recent films
isn't here. A good date movie that mixes comedy and romance into an enjoyable
fable about modern day love and religion. Even though it is pretty hokey, this
movie is still lots of fun.

Title
Review for Wayne's World (1992)
Wayne's World, the popular Myers/Carvey skit was from Saturday Night Live was
turned into a phenomenon when it was released in 1992. It spawned a sequel,
merchandising, and had several very memorable lines. But despite being funny, I
still don't think Wayne's World is that good of a movie.
Wayne (Myers) and Garth (Carvey) are two happening punk rock dudes that host a
weekly television show where they make fun of inventions and talk about what
makes them hot from their basement. When evil television executive Benjamin
Oliver (Rob Lowe) sees the show, he decides to exploit it and make it the next
big hit. Then Wayne meets Cassandra (Tia Carrare) the girl of his dreams who is
also being hit on by Benjamin. Garth must deal with the fact that Wayne has met
his first true love and that he's not his only friend anymore.
As the show gets picked up. Wayne and Garth find their show being changed way
too much. A sponsor from Noah's Arkade comes on to talk about their new video
games, and the title song is totally re-done. This is against the punk rocker
way, so Wayne, Garth, Cassandra, and others, must unite to beat the snobby
executives.
Yes, the film is very, very, funny. It features several memorable scenes (the
multiple endings being my favorite) and funny moments. But Wayne's World
doesn't have much else going for it. Alice Cooper also makes an appearance in
one of the funniest scenes in the movie. Looking for a laugh? You'll find it
here in the shallow Wayne's World, which gets ** 1/2 stars.

bad attitudes by almost every member of the cast. Good Age: 9 & Up

Title
Review for Pink Panther, The (1963)
The moment the famous Pink Panther theme comes on, the mood is perfectly set. 
This screwball comedy featuring the memorable Inspector Clouseau (played by 
Peter Sellers) whose bumbling detective work is less than extraordinary, is 
what most remember best about the film. However, some key scenes and other 
characters sometimes get forgotten. The real main character of the movie is 
Sir Charles Litton (David Niven). Litton is a playboy who also happens to be 
an elusive thief that steals precious diamonds, leaving a white glove behind 
at each crime scene. He's come to a ski resort to steal the Pink Panther; a 
jewel belonging to Princess Dala (Claudia Cardinale), named for the panther 
shaped imperfection in the middle of the stone. Clouseau is oblivious to the 
fact that his wife Simone (Capucine) is having an affair with Litton, and 
that the thief is right under his nose. Also present is a young Robert Wagner 
who portrays George Litton, Charles's nephew. These characters get thrown 
into a complex set of comedic situations that are laugh out loud hilarious. 
The scenes are funny not only for their slapstick physical comedy elements, 
but for the sheer idiocy of the characters and their actions. During some 
points of the movie, one might wonder how stupid Clouseau could possibly be, 
but his dumbness is always appealing, and never annoying. This whole movie's 
basis is fun. 
The reason The Pink Panther is probably so memorable is because of the great 
cast. Sellers is masterful as the Inspector and his performance evokes the 
classic comic genius of Charlie Chaplin. David Niven has fun with his role as 
a jewel thief, and I love how things heat up when his nephew (also an 
aspiring jewel thief) joins in on the fun. Princess Dala is innocent and 
funny, Cardinale makes her a character that is always interesting to watch. 
There have been recent rumors of a remake of this movie with Kevin Spacey 
taking the role of Clouseau. It would be interesting to see Spacey tackle 
this type of comedy. Catherine Zeta-Jones might fit well into the role of 
Dala. However, I don't see any real reason to remake this film. I was 
fortunate enough to see The Pink Panther at the Seattle International Film 
Festival on a big screen (where all comedies belong) with a new 35 MM print. 
The audience (including some very young children) laughed their heads off the 
entire time. The humor has stayed strong for thirty-seven years and is better 
suited to a rerelease. You could also go to a video store and rent one of the 
film's eight sequels.
>From the beautiful fireworks heavy conclusion, to the wacky gorilla costume 
sequences, this film is pure enjoyment. Not only is this a great film for 
those who have seen it and don't remember it well; it's a good movie to share 
with your children. The rich colors, classic humor, and good clean fun are 
what make this movie wonderful.

Title
Review for Titus (1999)
There are some people who absolutely cannot understand Shakespeare. You either
fully grasp what is going on, you kind of get the picture, or you don't know
what the heck is going on. Unfortunately, I am a member of the third group. The
language in these type of films loses me completely, and while I was somewhat
able to identify the situations and main storylines for this film, it would be
lying if I didn't say I had several problems understanding the film and it's
message. (If it had one). It's a pretty bad thing to lose your audience for 162
minutes, even those who do know what's going on. But with the way this film
sets itself up, and the time period (if there actually is one) they are
supposed to be in makes it even more confusing for the common moviegoer.
Titus (Hopkins, who just can't seem to find good roles for himself) has
returned from battle and is faced with Tamora, (Lange) a mother of three sons
one day in his courtroom. He orders Tamora's oldest son killed, much to her
pleads of mercy. At some type of political election days later the charismatic
Saturninis (Cumming) revs up the crowd with a promising speech and pronounces
himself king (or something of the sort) in front of Titus. He plans to marry
Titus's only daughter, Lavinia. But refuses Saturninis's advances, and runs off
with the man she truly loves. So he must seek another bride. Tamora, feeling
the need for revenge for the death of her son, is willing to be wed.
And that's about where it all went downhill for me. Apparently Tamora is
sleeping with a black guard/prophet/something with weird marks on his face.
When they are discovered making out in the forest, by Lavinia and her lover,
Tamora's two remaining sons kill the man that Lavinia loved and Tamora tells
them to do what they'd like with her. They cut off both of her hands and tongue
and replace her former hands with branches. It is then that the games begin,
it's Titus vs. Saturninis and Tamora.
It has been a constant thing in films for as long as I can remember to worry
more about the look of the film, then the script of the film itself. It's never
been more apparent here. Director Taymor (who also directs the hit Broadway
version of The Lion King) packs her film so full of visual style that sometimes
it's too much to take. The film is up for a Best Costume Oscar, which it
rightly deserves. But there isn't much else going for this picture. The film
begins with a boy playing with action figures in his kitchen and suddenly turns
into a battleground for Titus's soldiers. The film seems to go in and out of
different periods of time. It's also very MTV for a Shakespeare play. While I'm
told this is one of his very early works, and probably the most mediocre of his
plays, I still doubt that Chrion and Demetrius (Tamora's sons) would listen to
rock music, hump the air whenever they dance, play pool, or suddenly turn into
rape and death, revenge's partners in a scheme to get Titus killed. (Don't
ask). And another thing, could someone please explain to me why the kid playing
with the action figures in the beginning of the film suddenly gets bigger,
becomes Titus's assistant, and starts speaking Shakespeare?
The marketing for this film happens is extremely misleading. The posters depict
the film as some type of historical saga with battles and a love story. In
fact, the trailer does this too. Do not be fooled. It was exactly the opposite
of what I was lead to believe. My major complaint in the film though, didn't
need any understanding at all. The entire picture was so horrifically violent,
and full of so many sexual images, that I'm surprised that the MPAA let it go
with an R rating.  There's nudity from every single member of the main cast,
sometimes you just see a character's butt, other times it's full frontal
nudity. Even though the film's dark subject, revenge, does deal with death and
pain, I really doubt the film needed to show a midnight orgy between countless
amounts of men and women. Since I didn't have a watch to keep checking, I must
have thought at least one hundred times, "When is this going to end?!" The only
other noteworthy thing here is an extremely strange type of ode to Hannibal
Lecter, Hopkins famous character from The Silence of the Lambs near the end,
but by then you'll probably just be wondering how much more of this you will
have to endure. Where did everyone find such an array of weapons? Why don't
people die when their hands are cut off? When is this supposed to take place?
Why were they using plastic? Don't ask these questions, this film won't answer
them. 

Title
Review for Blair Witch Project, The (1999)
The Blair Witch Project (R) ** 1/2
Starring Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard
Directed by Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez
A Review by Frankie Paiva
If there is one film this summer (or any summer for that matter) besides Star
Wars could possibly create more hype than this film I would give it a prize.
What started out as a $35,000 dollar horror movie that could cover the fake
Blair Witch, would turn into a phenomenon. Early buzz out of Sundance had
people calling it the scariest film of all time, Artisan signed it that night
for 1 million, and the launch of the Blair Witch site began. 
Generating a cult months before the movie opens rarely happens, but do to the
fantastic webpage (www.blairwitch.com) which features all of the fake
mythology, it had people hanging on the edge, waiting for the film to be
released. "The film cannot possibly live up to all of the hype that's been
surrounding it." That was a quote from George Lucas about Star Wars, and it's
true here too.
You know the story, three student filmmakers Heather, (Donahue) Michael,
(Michael Williams) and Josh (Leonard) are out to shoot a documentary about the
Blair Witch. Townspeople say she was old Ellie Keyward, accused of witchcraft
she was banished in the 1800s. Every fourty years after that, mysterious things
would happen. Disemboweled fisherman showed up at the river, children started
going missing, and an old man says he was killing children because an old witch
told him so. 
They of course get lost and start hearing weird noises at night. One of the
crew goes missing, and what are all of those strange symbols that they keep
finding all over the forest?
The film does not live up to it's hype. I (and the 25 or so people that I've
talked with that saw it) all agree that is wasn't scary at all. What is hyped
to be the scariest film of all time didn't really inflict one twinge of pure
terror. The camera technique is interesting though, if not sickening, and I'd
like to see more films made that way. However do make sure to get a good
night's rest before seeing the film, the camera shaking didn't make me sick at
all, but it really made me sleepy. No, it's not "Scary as Hell" or is it "An
Instant Classic" but I still reccomend you see Blair Witch which gets ** 1/2
stars.

Review for Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999)
Whoever thinks that this type of film will appeal to teenagers is obviously
wrong. Teaching Mrs. Tingle opened to mediocre box office and mostly bad
reviews. And yes, there is a very good reason why.
Leigh Ann Watson (Holmes) is a straight-A student, she's hoping to become
valedictorian and get a scholarship to college but her plans have to pass by
one person. The teacher from hell, Mrs. Tingle. (Mirren) She enjoys being mean
to everyone just for the sake of being mean. She uses long and confusing words
often to criticize and poke fun at her students. Leigh Ann is trailing a rich
snobby girl by one point and Tingle's C doesn't help. When Luke (Barry Watson)
brings the answers to the final exam to her and her best friend Jo Lynn (Marisa
Coughlan) they are confronted with their morals. But when Mrs. Tingle catches
them, she can't wait to break out the scandal.
When they appear at her front door to tell her tell are sorry, one thing leads
to another and they eventually have her hands tied to the side of a bed and
have decided to blackmail her with incriminating photos. This begins a bunch of
mind games that set off the trio and make them even more determined to make her
pay. Also included is an embarrassing role for Jeffrey Tambor (and right after
Muppets From Space too) and a crossbow that keeps firing in all the wrong
places. 
With all of the controversy surrounding this film and Columbine, it's not
surprising the film did bad. While it's not really all that violent (the bad
attitudes between teachers and students should rank the highest amond parental
concerns) there really was no reason to call it Killing Mrs. Tingle in the
first place.
Mirren rounds out a well-cast cast. As the bitchy Tingle she has a chance to
flex a different kind of acting. Marisa Coughlan also does an uneeded, but
funny spoof of The Exorcist (it got her the part) and steals a lot of scenes.
The rest of the cast (including WB veterans Holmes and Watson) don't turn in
the same calibur performances. Since the film is set to appeal to my audience,
I obviously liked it more than the average movie critic, so Teaching Mrs.
Tingle gets ** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains extremely bad attitudes towards people and
authorities. It also contains some violence and a passionate make-out scene.

Review for Best in Show (2000)
Director: Christopher Guest
Writers: Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy
Cast: Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, 
Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard
Rated PG-13, 89 minutes
Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest) is preparing his bloodhound to sniff out 
the faults in his fellow canine competitors. Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene 
Levy and Catherine O'Hara) are getting their terrier ready for battle. Sheri 
Ann Ward Cabot (Jennifer Coolidge) and her hired trainer hope their poodle 
will win a third consecutive blue ribbon. Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) 
and Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean) are a gay couple who pamper their 
animal, and hope for victory. Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael 
Hitchcock) have high hopes for success with their dog. What's gotten all of 
these people and others all worked up? The Mayflower Dog Show of course! It's 
the world's most fabulous event for pooches and their owners alike. The tough 
rivalry and judges send some of the humans into states of insanity, while 
others feel less pressure. Calling this group of people quirky is an 
understatement. Using nearly the exact same cast from Guest's previous 
picture, "Waiting for Guffman," "Best in Show" tries for a similar triumph, 
but this judge says the picture is stale.
After "Guffman," plus previously co-writing and co-starring in "This Is 
Spinal Tap," there are few roads Guest can take for further creative 
achievement, especially in the mockumentary genre. Rather than experiment 
with something new, the director and co-writer decided to repeat himself. 
That was a mistake because this production almost negatively affects his past 
work. If someone sees this, and then goes to rent "Guff," the disappointment 
continues. Since it feels like the people of Blaine, Missouri agreed to 
appear in another film, it's rather a situation of which movie you see first. 
Either of them works wonderfully for the first spot, but watch the other sour 
in second. 
This isn't to say there's a lack of material, or that nothing is funny. 
Jennifer Coolidge is marvelous as an Anna Nicole Smith-like woman with a 
hidden sexual preference and an eccentric taste in clothing. She must have 
spent millions on a long necklace that outlines her large breasts in gleaming 
diamond fashion. While no Corky St. Clair, Guest's performance as Harlan 
Pepper is quite good. The problem is that both of these persons get little 
screen time. The most time goes to the surprisingly lackluster Eugene Levy. 
The running gag is that his wife has slept with every man they encounter on 
their drive to the show. It works, yet he's overused. I finally understand 
why people find Parker Posey annoying. Her way over-the-top bit here as a 
control freak catalog and Starbucks lover was just plain irritating. At least 
Fred Willard never lets up the enthusiasm as a dog show commentator who asks 
irksome questions to his posh British colleague. Willard's comments and ideas 
to improve the show are the high point here. The gay couple has little flair, 
and they misfire horribly. There needs to be one sane person here to balance 
it out. 
The animal and its owner(s?) that do win the title prize weren't my first or 
second choice, yet there's little mystery or tension as to who the winner(s?) 
is(are?) early on. 
While far superior, "Best in Show" shares a remarkably similar problem with 
"Scary Movie." The actors act like they know they're in a satire. That never 
works! You can see the snickering in their faces. Only when a person doesn't 
believe they're being watched can they fully be themselves, and, therefore, 
provide prime comedy. "Scary" was awfully cruel with the beings onscreen, 
something "Show," thankfully, does not do. 
At 89 minutes, this movie is entirely too long. The film tends to repeat 
itself, and the pet pampering gets annoying. There's no apparent reason 
behind all of this love and affection, besides some faux human nature. The 
dogs get treated like little children. And how do the dogs turn out? They 
emerge unscathed from this semi-humorous film that touches, but never delves 
into the many chances for humor that it covers. The real competitions are 
much more fun to watch. This doesn't reach the potential possible of canine 
mockery. Guest should go back to the drawing boards, or maybe back to Blaine.

Title
Review for Varsity Blues (1999)
Many a film have been showing us the different aspect's of what high schools
are in all different parts of the U.S. Whether is be four guys trying to loose
their virginity, the ugly duckling turning into a swan, or the longtime love of
Dawson and Joey, filmmakers are finding more ways to showcase this four year
portion of our lives. 
But this is West Canaan, Texas. Football rules all, the coach is evil, and the
police are stupid. Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) star quarterback for the Coyotes
(he has a huge billboard that says that in front of his house) is being pushed
by the venomous coach Kilmer (Voight, who's performance here should go right
next to his in Anaconda) to play even though he's letting off scar tissue by
the minute. He permanently damages his leg during the middle of the game.
The replacement is Johnathan Moxon (Van Der Beek) he's more interested in
reading Slaughterhouse Five than he is looking through the football plays. He
has a couple of plays of his own and he decides to try them out, besides he's
not going to play football ever again anyway. Kilmer doesn't like the fact that
he's not listening to him and tries to jeopardize his scholarship to Brown. It
all leads up to the big game, will they win, will they lose? (Yawn..).
The movie starts out as if it could be a well-drawn out thoughtful look at high
school sports, however this couldn't happen because MTV Productions is on the
label and the director is the co-creator of Kenan & Kel and All That. So they
fill in the cracks with countless scenes of uneeded nudity and profanity. While
the first half provides incredible insight, the second is a predictable sports
movie. So for that I give it *** stars.

Title
Review for Mickey Blue Eyes (1999)
Those looking for a nice, cute, and funny romantic comedy can stop right here.
Mickey Blue Eyes is another movie that examines the Mafia with a comic flair,
the first film of these kind being Analyze This. Since this film is PG-13, we
miss out on a lot of the things that made Analyze This a great movie. (Heavy
use of the f-word, shootings, etc.)  Not to mention that this film centers
itself on being a romance rather than just a funny comedy.
Michael Felgate (Grant doing his usual bumbling English thing that has served
him so well in the past) is an auctioneer who thinks that he’s finally found
the love of his life. He’s known Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn) only three
months, but plans to pop the question to her at dinner. He does, and she’s
horrified, she says that he can’t marry her, even though she loves him. She
runs away. Michael goes searching after her for a reason.
It turns out that Gina’s father is Frank Vitale (Caan) who is the head of a
local crime family. Gina says that no matter how you resist, they will somehow
get you to join their crew, and she doesn’t want that to happen to him. But
sooner or later it does. Michael is forced to auction off a terrifying painting
created by one of the Mafia men, only to have it bought back by the same men of
organized crime. This money laundering scheme is just the beginning. Soon
Michael is disposing of dead bodies, auctioning off even more interesting
paintings, and is posing as a thug from Kansas City named Mickey Blue Eyes
(hence the film’s title).
Everyone in the film plays well off one another. James Caan goes throughout the
entire picture looking as if he’s slightly lost, but still does a good job in
the movie. Jeanne Tripplehorn has a throw away role as the woman who will still
forgive Michael after all he’s done. But Hugh Grant (who was in Notting Hill
with Julia Roberts and other English productions) is the star of the show, and
his antics (surprisingly) can carry an entire picture. Joe Viterelli (who
appeared in a very similar role in Analyze This) also has a great supporting
performance.
This is a very simple film that takes it’s premise and twists it every
possible way that it can. For this reason, I think that it can never get more
than a B+, but I still enjoyed it. Much of the humor just keeps getting crazier
and crazier, and while we’ve seen most of the stuff here before, (the film is
nowhere near groundbreaking), the movie is still a whole lot of fun. Rent
Mickey Blue Eyes tonight, and enjoy a couple of laughs.
Overall Grade: B                 Rated PG-13 for brief strong language, some
violence and sensuality.
The Young-Uns: This film contains two f-words and some other language. There is
also a heavy focus on lying and shooting people. There are also  some shooting
scenes, but they won’t be hard for anyone to handle. Good Age: 12 and up

Review for Steel (1997)
Ah, the family classic Kazaam, starring that ever popular Shaquille O'Neal,
once a big basketball star. Space Jam was a hit with Michael Jordan, why not
have other players act? That ever popular movie about Shaq being a genie in a
bottle made $18 million, and it's time to do a sequel.
(NOTE ON ABOVE PARAGRAPH: Anyone reading the above paragraph and thought that I
was actually serious should seek medical help immediately by going to
www.shrink.com) 
How many times does it take those dumb studio executives to figure out that
something doesn't work? If O'Neal's movie premiere, Kazaam, which made the
Internet Movie Database's Top 10 Worst Films of the 90s than why make another
movie starring this tall basketball hero? What is an extremely poor rehash (it
almost gets the same treatment that this summer's other comic book to screen
dissapointment Spawn got) of a great old comic book, turns into a violent,
cheesy, and inane chase through a city of bad guys.
The evil Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson) purposefully shoots fellow officer Susan
Sparks (Gish) with an overpowered weapon right in front of John Henry Irons
(O'Neal, his name is Henry Irons and Steel, get it?) on the testing field. He's
some type of psychotic maniac and plans to reek hell on the world by letting
everyone feel his pain. When Susan becomes confined to a wheelchair, John helps
her on her road to recovery. 
But all is not well, Burke has decided to sell the powerful weapons on the
black market and hires unknowingly naive young African-Americans to sell them
for him. But, (and I hope your sitting down) my god, he's captured John's baby
brother! This prompts him to turn into a superhuman metal man with a cool suit
and plenty of interesting gadgets.
An action film easily more forgettable than Batman & Robin. At least Batman had
some flashly effects and cool scenes. This film is filled with countless scenes
that are so bad, it almost appears as if some of the actors are holding back
their laughter. Another thing that makes it bad is the fact that we a supposed
to actually care for all of these characters when they are placed into danger,
even though we know that they cannot possibly die because this is a run-of-the
mill action flick. This is another film to see if you enjoy inflicting pain on
yourself, and I give it * star.
The Young-Uns: This film contains lots of violence and showcases it as a way of
solving problems, it glorifies this is many ways. However, it's not as nearly
as violent as many other action films your child's already seen. Good Age:
11-12
ADDITIONAL NOTE: This film also made the Internet Movie Database's Top 10 Worst
Films of the 90s.

Title
Review for Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain, The (1995)
Few of us will ever know the feeling of loving something so much that you will
do anything and everything to protect it. Such warm, gentle emotion is rarely
the subject of feature films, but Miramax has taken a change with Englishman. A
loving, affectionate portrait of the love a Welsh village has for its mountain
is the type of thing that should be filling the modern motion picture screen.
Yes, this is another one of those quirky, quiet, and subtle English comedies,
but it’s one that everyone should enjoy.
George (Ian McNeice) and Reginald (Grant) are cartographers (people who make
maps) that come to a small Welsh village to measure their great mountain. The
two men are very out of place in this type of community and no one really seems
to like them. This dislike of them increases when the town learns that in order
to be classified as a mountain on the British maps, their mountain (or is it a
hill?) has to be at least one thousand feet high. The first reading doesn't
please the townspeople, it’s just under a thousand feet high.
Devising a plan the local pub owner, Morgan the Goat (Meaney), decides to screw
up the cartographer's car so that they can’t go anywhere, he also hires a
woman to pretend that she fancies Reginald. This all happens while the rest of
the townspeople bring dirt up in buckets and pails so that they can build on
the fourteen or so extra feet that is needed for their beloved treasure. Morgan
fights with the town’s reverend about whether or not the people will work on
the Sunday of church to rebuild the mountain. He won’t let him, so how will
they get it done before they leave the next day? Will the townspeople be able
to have the first mountain in Wales?
This movie is so cute and full of little details that you can’t help but
liking it. It’s these little details that keep the film running ninety-four
minutes without the presence of a very solid plot. Hugh Grant gives his usual
bumbling English performance and Ian McNeice is funny, especially after he
drinks way too much gin. The really fun parts of the movie are seeing how they
try to delay the two individuals from leaving the town so that they can measure
the mountain again. For instance, the local train station says that all
passenger trains are flooded, yet the coal trains can still go right through.
The answer? They have different tracks of course. I also don’t quite think
that the love story between Reginald and Betty works very well. They both seem
awkward and not showing off their best acting abilities in those scenes. While
it’s obvious that the title is too long, I had some trouble coming up with
alternative ones. The Englishman? The Hill? One Thousand Feet? Nah, none of
them fit the film’s fun, quirky atmosphere. A great movie to rent (a must for
English comedy lovers if they haven’t seen it already) The Englishman Who
Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain gets *** stars.
The Young-Uns: I can’t say that most young children will get this movie, but
there is a some mild language and plenty of drinking. Good Age 9 & Up

Title
Review for Big Kahuna, The (1999)
Plays that become movies usually have a different feel than normal pictures. 
Few rise above the play on film point, and most often those who see it 
onstage like it the best. The strange Parker Posey comedy The House of Yes 
comes to mind when thinking of the unsatisfactory play to film movie cooked 
up by several independent studios. The Big Kahuna is the same in lots of 
ways. It takes away any chance for visual originality and instead puts the 
movie on the shoulders of the actors. Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and Peter 
Facinelli brilliantly play the main characters. Add Roger Rueff’s smart 
adaptation of his play to the mixture. The result is a comedy turned drama 
that asks serious questions and forces the audience to think. It never dips 
below the satisfactory mark.
Larry (Kevin Spacey), Phil (Danny DeVito), and Bob (Peter Facinelli) 
represent an industrial lubricant sales company. They are attending a 
convention in a Kansas hotel. Larry is an individual who is not afraid to be 
frank when talking to people. He often voices his opinion loudly and says 
what’s on his mind. Phil is an alcoholic who is starting to lose interest in 
the lubricant business. He is Larry’s best friend and acts in a middle child 
way. He rarely participates in Larry’s oral sparring matches and tries to 
promote peace with himself and others. Bob is a young, devout Baptist whose 
religious and traditional ways clash with Larry’s beliefs. All three are 
hoping to catch the grand kahuna. A deal with a company so big, it would put 
their tiny business on the map. As the search for the kahuna goes on, the 
characters begin to search inside themselves for answers to their confusion 
about life, mortality, and the heavens.
It may take place almost entirely in a hospitality suite, but The Big Kahuna 
is never boring or familiar. Things are constantly changing for the trio and 
the script moves around as well. What starts as a wickedly sharp comedy ends 
as a solemn and meaningful drama. There is not as much tension as the recent 
one room drama Deterrence, and in the end that is a better thing. The film 
always moves along in a relaxed and comfortable way. Kevin Spacey is 
marvelous as fast-talking Larry. His performance reminds one that he is not 
only a great leading man, but a creative character actor as well. Danny 
DeVito makes a wonderful recovery from Drowning Mona and Screwed. His 
redemption here gives hope for his next movies. Peter Facinelli is excellent 
as well. While he has been bad in bad movies (like Can’t Hardly Wait or 
Supernova) he shows the excellent promise here that he exhibited in Dancer, 
Texas Pop. 81. When the actors work together, they create a fantastic 
chemistry unseen in recent movies.
The questions asked and advice given from character to character is 
unparalleled. Among the subjects examined are life, death, fidelity, and God. 
Everything has such an air of truth to it. A character will handle and often 
defend their position when met with a judgement of himself in a real way. 
Nothing ever feels fake, and the depth that’s reached is astonishing.
This is a verbal movie of conflicting views. Despite being a tad slow near 
its end, it is always interesting and perfectly fits its short running time. 
The acting is superb, and the script well written. The Big Kahuna should be a 
pleasing surprise for adults. It has the rare qualities of being smart, 
poignant, and reality based. This is a true wonder indeed.

Title
Review for Nurse Betty (2000)
Rarely is any movie such a director and actor triumph. The overall theme of Nu
rse Betty is taking risks, traveling the open road, and discovering the 
person you really are. This applies to both the characters in the movie, and 
the actors playing them. For director Neil LaBute, this film shows he's 
equally skilled at directing material that isn't his own. Screenwriters James 
Flamberg and John C. Richards get a chance to show off their superior wit and 
skill. The screenplay also provides a comic breath of fresh air for each of 
the lead actors. This thing is just ablaze with talent.
Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives in the small town of Fair Oaks, Kansas 
with her abusive dimwit husband Del (Aaron Eckhart). Betty's life revolves 
around a hospital soap opera called A Reason to Love that stars George McCord 
(Greg Kinnear) as dashing lead doctor David Ravell. In addition to committing 
adultery, Del's involved in a drug deal with Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and 
Wesley (Chris Rock). One night Del invites the men home for a business 
discussion. He is unaware that Betty is watching a tape of her favorite show 
in the next room. Since Del hasn't delivered some promised heroin, Charlie 
and Wesley assume he's keeping it for himself. So they kill him, and Betty 
witnesses the whole thing. She goes into a state of shock. When she hears Dr. 
Ravell on television saying, "There must be something special out there for 
me," Betty assumes he must be talking about her. She heads to Los Angeles in 
hopes of finding her "ex-fiancee," and starts accepting the show as truth. 
What she doesn't know is that her car has that missing heroin in the trunk. 
It's about time that Renee Zellweger received a good comic role. Both The 
Bachelor and Me, Myself & Irene saw her humor opportunities limited by a bad 
leading man. This film hands her many chances to shine, and she gives a 
brilliant performance. The whole picture rides on her shoulders, and she 
makes a very good leading lady. Thank casting directors Heidi Levitt and 
Monika Mikkelsen for the appearance of Morgan Freeman. Like Steve Martin, he 
is one of America's most outstanding, but underused actors. The job he does 
here, and the chemistry he has with the Chris Rock character, steals the 
whole movie. Rock is good too, if a bit familiar. They are best when 
together. Greg Kinnear, after a string of flops, shows why he became such a 
big actor. His biting work exemplifies some of Hollywood's crueler 
personalities. 
The screenplay has a steady pace and creates room for small, memorable 
characters. At the same time, it generates outrageously hilarious scenes that 
are just priceless. Betty is a perfectly established persona, and since 
everyone in the film is so quirky no individual's actions seem random and 
without meaning. Movement between the various locales is surprisingly fluid 
thanks to dexterous directing and editing. However, all things are not 
completely rosy in Fair Oaks or Los Angeles. There is quite a bit of violence 
that doesn't fit the tone of the movie. While nothing overly graphic takes 
place, the scalping and shoot-outs didn't need to be as bloody as they were. 
The film dips ever-so-briefly into some sex humor that's not required. Beyond 
that material, few jokes ever fail.
Everything about this movie is different. That may be why USA Films is 
releasing Nurse Betty, which is at its heart an independent film, to 
multiplexes. They're probably trying to create another comedy sleeper like 
last year's Being John Malkovich, which they also released. This movie isn't 
quite that unique, but is considerably less dark, and no less inspired. See 
this movie, tell a friend about it, and have a good time. It is the antidote 
to a summer of boring and predictable flicks.

Title
Review for Buena Vista Social Club (1999)
Recently, there have been a couple of films that bring us into a world of music
that we have never heard before. Genghis Blues followed the story of a blind
man who's visit to Tuva, for the throat-singing championships was funny and
heartfelt. The Buena Vista Social Club is a touching look into the world of
aging Cuban musicians, and the poor country that they live in.
The Buena Vista Social Club is a large group of Cuban music makers. Each of
them have very special lives that the film documents. The main singer (Ferrer)
lives in a small rundown apartment and is best friend's with the woman he sings
with. He's hesitant when someone asks him to record an album, but he eventually
does it. The piano player had arthritis and hadn't even owned a piano in over
ten years before he joined the club. The guitar player has always wanted to do
a record on Cuban musicians.
The film documents the different, touching lives that these people live, and
focuses mainly on their talent. A great deal of performances of different songs
are included in the film, whose Grammy winning soundtrack is making a comeback
for Cuban music. But another thing the film shows is how nice of a place Cuba
really could be. The desolate streets and hot climates could easily be made
into a huge tourist vacation. I know that this review is very short, but there
isn't much that I can say about the film, because there really aren't any basic
plotlines. If your looking for an interesting little documentary, I suggest you
go see The Buena Vista Social Club, which gets *** stars.
The Young-Uns: The film is rated G, but some younger kids won't understand
what's going on. Good Age 10 & Up

Review for Instinct (1999)
There are some actors that you just look at and will automatically see them as
the famous character they play. Fran Drescher will forever will the Nanny, Bob
Denver will always be Gilligan, and Don Knotts lives forever as Barney Fife.
All these people are television actors who appear on their show, week after
week playing the same character, so it is hard for this to translate into
celebrities who appear in movies. Anthony Hopkins on the other hand apparently
wants us to always think of him as a crazed madman behind bars. This is the
only reason I could come up with for him to take the leading role in Instinct,
a new movie that re-defines cliched and painful. It does not matter if the
prison inmates are tough praying on the few weak ones, or that the guards give
new meaning to police brutality. You could probably withstand all of the above
material on a good bucket of popcorn and a very large soda. But the movie can't
even be even fun and smart on a summer movie level, and fails miserably to make
us excited or scared in any way.
Dr. Theo Calder is a young psychologist who is very high in the areas of
self-confidence and self-assurance. He wants to begin seeing a crazed scientist
who recently was transported from a prison in Africa to one in the states.
Ethan Powell (Hopkins, playing the role of Hannibal Lecter’s non-cannibal
cousin) was a scientist who disappeared in the forests of Africa in 1994. He
lived in the forest with the gorillas he studies for two years before killing
two park rangers and injuring two more while trying to protect his gorilla
family. In the first interview Theo learns some problems that may hinder the
investigation of Ethan. One, he doesn't speak to anyone at all. Two, he hasn't
experienced human interaction in so long he responds to almost everything with
violent outbursts. Three, the doctors at the prison just don't care. How
dramatic, how thrilling, how (inserting snoring sounds here). 
Eventually he does get the man to finally utter a few words, but the
psychiatrist soon finds himself to be the one who’s being taught a lesson.
There’s some message about how no human actually has control, they just think
they do, that is what Powell teaches him. Dr. Calder soon expands his horizons
as a realizes that is may not be the people in the prison, but the prison
itself. The problems with the inmates must live with are guards that are not
fair to them and treat them with harshly and violently. Plus, oh my God!
everyone in the prison is not being treated with proper respect.
OK, let us take a poll: Who would ever really care about what happens to any of
the people in this movie? See it and if you don’t come out disgusted then I
will personally pay for your next outing to the cinema. (NOTE: The preceding
sentence was just to prove a point that this movie is bad, I will not pay for
your next movie so don’t e-mail me asking for money.) The acting in the film
is just horrible. Hopkins does nothing in the role that he is accustomed to,
and Cuba has some keen intellectual ability to pick bad roles that will make
him lose his star status. This is not entirely the actor’s faults though. The
script could easily have been written better if the proper time was taken with
it. The soapy emotion that floats up near the end of the film also doesn’t
make any sense with all of the happenings in the beginning of the picture. The
setting is uninteresting and the story has too many side plots that they do
nothing with which just seem to be there to add to the running time. You could
rip up all of the copies (with gloves on so as not to burn your fingers) of
this movie at your local video store. You could warn people who try to rent it,
or you could make a big bonfire and burn all of the copies in the neighborhood.
Whatever you can do to help make sure that no one on earth will ever have to
experience this film (I believe) would be greatly appreciated by the American
public. So if you haven’t gotten the message yet, avoid Instinct, which gets 
1/2 a *.

Review for Sixth Sense, The (1999)
An announcement to the world, I have finally seen The Sixth Sense. At first I
didn't want to go, it just didn't sound like that appealing of a movie. Then
one of my friend's told me to go see it, but they like Adam Sandler, so I
dismissed their comment at first. Then my parent's friend went to go see it,
and they loved it. Then my dad's boss said that he and his wife loved it, so
naturally we had to go. And boy was I surprised. Anyone that does not want to
see this movie because it promises to be and scary, and really isn't (there are
only so many Lake Placid's, Deep Blue Sea's, and Blair Witch Project's that you
can see) should suspend all disbelief and go and see this film now. Anyone that
can make up another stupid excuse such as, but I'd rather go to Hooters, or
let's rent a movie instead, should come to their senses (the seventh sense
perhaps?) and see this film immediately.
Malcolm Crowe (Willis, excellent in a non-action film role) is a child
psychologist who is shot by one of his former patients that still believes he
is a freak. A year after he recovers from the shooting, he is assigned his
first new case. Cole Sear (Joel Osment, who I'll be rooting for at the Oscars)
is a disturbed child that is constantly plagued by these horrific visions and
receives multiple stab wounds without ever really getting hurt. Malcom is
frightened as he finds this child to be more and more like the person that shot
him.
So when Cole tells him that he can see dead people (OK, I realize that I am
giving away a major plot point, but all of the ads include those words so I
might as well anyway) he doesn't believe him at first, but as time goes by, be
begins to believe in the supernatural.
Great performances from the entire cast, especially Haley Joel Osment (all you
people that say young people today can't act or win Oscars have been proven
wrong! Heck, if a guy who doesn't speak English can win for being in a truly
magical film, a kid can win for acting in a hella spooky one) and Toni Collette
as his mother. Bruce Willis also belongs on the nomination list, (but will
probably be forgotten with other should be nominees like director Tom Tykwer
and Dan Hedaya in "Dick." If my first paragraph hasn't convinced you to see the
film yet, there are also wild sex scenes that show graphic nudity from all
members of the Dawson's Creek cast, (heck, why not use false statements and
fake advertising to promote a product, it's been done before) and the film is
scarier than Blair Witch (true.) What are you waiting for? Go, now, to the
theater and see The Sixth Sense, which gets *** 1/2 stars.
ADDITIONAL NOTE: If the surprise twist at the end doesn't give you a heart
attack, I think that only the nachos they serve at the refreshment counter
will.
The Young-Uns: The film contains some very chilling scenes of dead people,
vomiting, and poisioning. Good Age: 12-13 & Up

Title
Review for Wing Commander (1999)
There are many things that weâve learned from computers. There are also many
ways in which computers are helping people live their lives today. E-mail,
instant messages, and 3-D heavy games are now a part of everyday life for most
people in the country. Game designers have come out with some pretty classic
games such as Starcraft, Warcraft, EverQuest, and Wing Commander in the past
couple of years. While Starcraft might make a good movie, Wing Commander
doesnât. The only thing I can come up with is that 20th Century Fox must have
gotten together and said, âWe have a lot of computers. So letâs make a
movie based off of a computer game, include bad computer generated effects, and
make the characters have the dimension of their PC game counterparts.â?
Thatâs the only thing I can possibly think of that they must have been
thinking because this film is easily one of the worst movies of the year.
Christopher Blair (Prinze Jr.) has an encrypted CD with information pertaining
to the destruction of a ship by the evil Kilrahti, an alien race that wasnât
to be dominant of the entire galaxy. Kilrathi are strange looking wolf-type
creatures who walk around in rooms with lots of fog and speak in techno font
subtitles. When Blair and his friend Todd Marshall (Matthew Lillard, who once
again proves that he cannot act) get assigned to help beat the Kilrathi, they
become a fighter on the ship.
So a bunch of space stuff that doesnât really have any significance happens,
and then more of it happens, and then more until we really donât care much
about whatâs happening on screen. Most of the shots are of bad computer
created ships leaving, taking off, and firing, always hitting their target.
Then for some reason, Freddie has to leave his girl behind when she has to
eject from her space plane. This of course is right before he has to make the
jump that determines what happens in the end of the movie. (You will ask
yourself why he has to do this, you will also ask yourself why you ever wanted
to see this movie.) So he's up there in space worried and wondering whether his
love will be dead or alive when he comes home. I know, I just gave away what
happens in the end, but trust me, you wonât care.
The film contains horrible acting by everyone, there isn't one single
exception, none, zero, nada. This isnât to say itâs entirely the castâs
fault, Matthew Lillard is giving some pretty bad lines, and Freddie Prinze
doesnât have much to do. I think that I found the most compelling and
interesting character to be Mr. Obutu, (Hugh Quarshie) an African-American ship
navigator person, and thatâs only because of his name. The effects arenât
very good at all, and the action scenes donât build any suspense, so we
donât really care about the characters. Besides, the script is filled with so
many stereotypes (the captain who doesnât believe everyone else, the
good-hearted bad girl) that you know whatâs going to happen from about the 35
minute point. If you love the game you will be EXTREMELY disappointed. Heck, if
you saw it in the theaters, at least the new Star Wars trailer was shown before
it. That might make the experience a bit less painful. But if you consider
renting it on video, (what the heck is wrong with you?!) I seriously recommend
that you seek help because Wing Commander gets 1/2 a *.

Title
Review for Felicia's Journey (1999)
Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob Hoskins) is a sort of modern Norman Bates. His 
strange obsession with his French cook mother (Arsinee Khanjian) leads him to 
pursue, videotape, and possibly kill young women, usually prostitutes, 
searching for answers in their difficult lives. Hilditch is very lonely, not 
to mention a little crazy, but he tries to be appealing. He's admired by his 
co-workers, the only friends he has. He apparently hopes the girls will stay 
forever, providing him with everlasting companionship. Felicia (Elaine 
Cassidy) is his latest young acquaintance. She is looking for her Irish 
boyfriend who says he works at a lawnmower factory in town. It turns out he 
may have joined the British Army and used the lawnmowers as a cover-up. 
Felicia relies on Hilditch for guidance and lodging since she has little 
money. She almost gives up all hope of finding Johnny, but Joseph tries to 
keep her optimistic and with him for his own personal purposes. The tension 
builds as Felicia may or may not meet the same fate as the previous young 
women.
With one exception, the acting was very good. Elaine Cassidy was never 
satisfactory, but was manageable. Bob Hoskins turns in a masterful 
performance as Hilditch, and Arsinee Khanjian succeeds in flashback scenes. 
Claire Benedict plays a small, but important role as a traveling bible 
saleswoman. She perfectly captures the essence of all Jehovah's Witnesses 
that have ever come to your door. Her marvelous performance got overlooked 
for an Oscar nomination. A wonderful score and soundtrack accompany the 
actors. During the frequent long periods of silence, Egoyan lets the music 
speak for his characters. Malcolm Vaughn's songs add to the unbearable 
intensity. 
Despite being tense, Felicia's Journey has its downsides. The movie is 
remarkably slow and was very tiring. Dramatic build-up is probably the reason 
for lots of unneeded scenes. Too much of the movie is confusing. Felicia and 
Hilditch's actions always seem scripted. Since we never learn a huge amount 
about these people, it's tough to comprehend their motivations. The film 
obviously takes place in England, but the time period is uncertain. 
Hilditch’s old car model and home appliances suggest the 1950s or ‘60s. 
Felicia’s wardrobe, including platform sandals, suggests otherwise. It’s 
even harder to understand the perplexing ending. This mystery is actually 
entertaining for a while. The intriguing Hilditch is quite fascinating until 
his secrets get revealed. Around the same time the movie comes to a grinding 
halt. Another viewing would perhaps help to clear any of my confusion. 
However, another viewing would also put me to sleep.
Sadly, the boring moments outnumber the exciting ones. The material isn't 
enough to build an entire movie on, even though the cast and director try 
hard. This was a personal disappointment for me because Egoyan's 1997 film 
The Sweet Hereafter is one of my all-time favorite movies. Felicia's Journey 
is tiresome, hollow, and better suited as an eighty to ninety minute film. 
Superior performances don't save the poor script.

Title
Review for Happy, Texas (1999)
This is a madcap comedy that simply does not deliver. While the premise of 
two escaped convicts stealing a motor home only to find out they are supposed 
to be gay beauty pageant directors sounds promising, the outcome is dismal. 
The script isn't nearly as full of life as it might seem, and the actors do 
nothing to make their characters more vibrant and exciting. This is really a 
shame considering the cast assembled for this small production. 
Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) portray 
the two convicts. They arrive in Happy, Texas where citizens are counting on 
them to help the town's girls win the Little Miss Fresh Squeezed beauty 
pageant. While in town, they come up with the idea to rob the bank after 
harvest checks are deposited. The bank is heavily unguarded. Joe McClintock 
(Ally Walker, formerly of NBC's The Profiler) runs the bank, and Harry 
figures the easiest way to get into the bank is to become close friends with 
Joe. Wayne gets left with the girls to teach and is aided by Ms. Schaefer 
(Illena Douglas), the girl's teacher. Thrown into the mix is Chappy (William 
H. Macy) the town's closeted gay sheriff who takes an interest in Harry. He's 
clueless to the fact that Harry is a wanted man, even though he's received 
several notices about him. 
The film is about the relationships between the characters, as each one of 
them is falling in and out of love. The love they feel for each other 
(particularly in Wayne and Ms. Schaefer's case) seems to come out of nowhere, 
and never reaches any level of believability. Macy is very funny as the gay 
sheriff, and he's the only member of the cast that seems to be having any 
fun. In probably the only truly funny scene of the movie, he takes Harry to a 
gay cowboy bar 2 1/2 hours from town. The awkwardness between the two in this 
scene is the movie's highlight. The memorable Chappy aside, there is no real 
reason to see Happy, Texas. Jeremy Northam who lately has been appearing in 
period films (The Winslow Boy, An Ideal Husband) seems uncomfortable with 
this modern comedic role. The rest of the cast does nothing with their roles, 
and the acting (and plot) get worse and worse as the movie goes on. Happy, 
Texas isn't helped by the bad makeup work and lack of good sound dubbing. 
Scenes where Wayne hits a man over the head with a dead armadillo, or runs 
out of a building with a real flaming baton appear contrived and stupid, and 
I was wondering when the movie was finally going to end. Chappy alone cannot 
save Happy, Texas, which is too lifeless, laughless, and boring for its own 
good.

Title
Review for Shanghai Noon (2000)
One reason I think Jackie Chan is such a hit with American audiences is 
because his movies are so much fun. Known internationally as a martial arts 
master, he first appeared in the states with Operation Condor, First Strike, 
and Rumble in the Bronx. More recently, his first American film, Rush Hour, 
grossed over $100 million at the box office. This was mostly due to its 
mixture of comedy and nonstop action. Chan's latest, Shanghai Noon, does not 
deviate from the humorous action setup that worked so well before. This is 
basically Rush Hour with spurs and ten gallon hats. While this may seem like 
a disappointing thing at first, it turns out not to be. Shanghai Noon is the 
continuation of a movie I never really wanted to end, and by the time the 
film closed, I was asking for more.
Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is an Imperial Guard who gets sent to America to 
recover Princess Pei Pei (Ally McBeal's Lucy Liu) whom the Emperor believes 
was kidnapped. She actually went voluntarily, and gets tricked into working 
with a large group of Chinese immigrants on a railroad in present day Nevada. 
Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) is the talkative leader of a group of bandits who 
make the mistake of robbing the train that Wong is on. About five thrilling 
action scenes later, O'Bannon and Wong decide to team up together to rescue 
the Princess, and return her to China.  Many adventures involving a variety 
of villains and a variety of weapons ensue that will test the two friends' 
trust for each other.
Shanghai Noon is probably the funniest movie released so far this year, and 
is easily Chan's best. The fish out of water and radically different buddy 
plotline works magically again. As the chatty and sensitive O'Bannon, Owen 
Wilson shows much more potential than his previous efforts in Armageddon and 
The Haunting. He provides a nice alternative to the annoying Chris Tucker. 
Much of the film's humor derives from racial differences. When a Western 
couple is debating why Wong is wearing a dress (it's actually his Imperial 
uniform) they decide he must be one of those Jews. Similar jokes involving 
the Chinese, Native Americans, and African Americans are also present. 
However, the film is lighthearted, and the jokes aren't nearly as shocking as 
those of, say, Blazing Saddles. In addition to some offensive humor, there 
are a barrelful of clichés we've all seen before. These too get effectively 
covered up by the film's fast paced action and excitement. Jackie Chan 
retains his usual charm, and when you see Wong fighting a number of Crow 
Indians or a saloon of men with his bare hands, you know you are watching 
classic Chan. Pei Pei gets to kick some butt too. Lucy Liu, who will star in 
the kung fu heavy Charlie's Angels, proves she's no damsel in distress. It's 
nice to see a female character tangle with the guys. This movie has the 
perfect balance of comedy and action, but one must wonder how long this 
racial divide blockbuster action picture formula can last. I'm not sure 
exactly whose idea it was to open Noon the same week as Mission: Impossible 
2, but it is a worthy competitor. It is not only a better bang for your buck 
action flick, it achieves humor that is impossible to find in M:I-2. After 
the film ends, watch for the usual outakes, a token, and often best part of a 
Chan film. This movie embodies what summer really should be, lots and lots of 
fun.

Title
Review for Inspector Gadget (1999)
Inspector Gadget is another one of my favorite cartoons. Rugrats and Doug have
been made into movies, why not this classic series? However, Disney decides to
take the production another way. This Inspector Gadget is a live action super
crime fighting machine. He's always in control, he's not stupid, and the whole
Mission Impossible bit from the TV show is completely lost.
Broderick is a security guard one night when Brenda (Joely Fisher) and her
father have been working on creating a fully robotic anamatronic crime fighting
machine, Claw (Rupert Everett) breaks in to steal their prototype foot and they
break into a chase. Broderick is sent to intensive care, but not before hitting
Claw's hand with a bowling ball.
Claw then proceeds, (with the help of mad scientist Andy Dick) to create a
clone of Gadget.  He's decked out with guns and other killing machines, his
mission is to destroy the original Gadget. Claw's idea is to make everyone in
the world pay for his killing machines so he can become rich. Add a couple of
bad spoofs and you've got another bad Disney movie.
Plus, this movie loses all sight of the original cartoon. It throws in a
miscast Michelle Trachtenberg as Penny, D.L. Hughley as a talking car, and
Dabney Coleman as the chief of police. There however is enough content here to
make this movie watchable, the gadgets are pretty cool, and some of the humor
is funny, (the was extremely surprised to find no fart and poop jokes) this is
mostly credited to Cheri Oteri who plays the town's glamorous, if not
dim-witted major.
So why would I give this movie ** stars you ask? Stay for the credits! There
are two scenes, one in particular (where we get to hear Brain talk) that make
up (at least for me) almost the entire movie. If your kids drag you to it, it
won't be that painful, but I still give it ** stars.

Title
Review for Final Destination (2000)
I'm not quite sure where to begin with this movie. First of all, I must say
that this film is bad, a tepid piece of trash really defines it well. Yet I
found myself somewhat drawn to the characters and their situation. This was
probably due to a script that (while stupid and cliched) is also fun, fast
paced, and exciting. Some of the moments where the writing shines through
(there are few of them) are mildly enjoyable, as are some several special
touches that will reward the horror movie junkie.
Alex (Sawa, who appeared in the even worse Idle Hands) is very sacred of
flying. He and a large group of classmates are heading to Paris for a week.
Before takeoff he has a nightmare in which the plane blows up in midair. He
awakens and screams that the plane is going to crash and gets himself, five
other students, and a teacher kicked off the plane. The plane does indeed crash
moments later, and there are no survivors. This is when Alex discovers his
skill (so to speak). He can see or tell when people are going to die. When
teens who got kicked off the plane begin mysteriously dying by strange causes,
he sinks deeper and deeper into paranoia. He eventually believes that death
itself is chasing after them, and there is no way to escape their fate. But
who's next on death's list?
One of the things that really bothered me about this movie was the use of
violence. The idea of death coming after teens instead of a masked serial
killer is original, but the ways of death are way too drawn out, implausible,
and gory. More than half of the blood could have been saved, and the movie
would still achieve the R rating it appeared the filmmakers were looking for.
Too many things just happen, and ideas about what is going on are grasped too
quickly by the characters and it takes away a feeling of mystery. The question
becomes not who the killer is, but how they will escape the killer. This movie
also comes out at a bad time. It's release comes just after several highly
publicized plane crashes. In particular, one that crashed while heading to
Paris with students on board.
One usually expects shaky performances from teen movies, but these are in a
whole new class. Seann William Scott (American Pie) and Kerr Smith (Jack on
Dawson's Creek) have given two of the worst performances I've witnessed in a
very, very long time. Ali Larter and Devon Sawa stand out as untalented actors
too. Larter really shows her chops while performing such gut wrenching scenes
as listening to a CD on a CD player, frantically trying to start a car, and
doing her best to look bewildered. Acting God Devon Sawa really shows us raw,
human emotion in such scenes as rolling down a hill, and looking through the
latest issue of Penthouse. If things couldn't get any worse, then Tony Todd (of
the original Candyman, apparently thrown in here for kicks) will really excite
you as a mortician named Bludworth who appears in one scene, and is never quite
explained. Other inside jokes include a character with the last name Hitchcock,
a woman listening to a John Denver record, and popping up for no apparent
reason, a poster for 1998's wickedly funny John Waters' film Pecker. It hangs
content on Alex's wall in the beginnings scenes of the movie. It's about the
only thing in this movie that isn't slapped with blood...or mediocrity.

Title
Review for Tigger Movie, The (2000)
Hollywood has no courtesy to the older actors of their previous time. It seems
that countless films today feature an entire cast under 30 or treat old people
as the running joke, both of these have happened in a handful of films from the
past year. When older actors (or actors over 40) do get really good roles, it's
usually in a small independent picture that will be playing in the dark and
scary section of town in a small theater where you would never dare to go at
night. So let's broaden that phrase, Hollywood has no respect for people in
general. Not to mention animals. Which is why I was very concerned walking into
The Tigger Movie, one of Disney's Thanksgiving to June animated features (much
like The Goofy Movie) that is designed to hold us down until the big Disney
animated opus comes out in June. If Pooh and the gang were treated as a
throwaway film, imagine what that could do to disgrace the entire set of
classic featurettes and the future of the franchise. Fans of Pooh's earlier
adventures (kids and adults alike) will find plenty to be excited about, as
there are only a few things that have changed.
Tigger is feeling energetic, but alas, there is no one to bounce with. While
trying to find a bouncing partner, he interrupts the rest of the gang who are
trying to move a boulder off of Eeyore's house and they inform him that they
can't bounce with him because they are not Tiggers and can't keep up. Feeling
lonely he begins thinking. With the help of one of the six fabulous musical
numbers, he decides that there must be a Tigger family out there somewhere in
the Hundred Acre Wood. A suggestion of a Tigger family tree from Owl is all he
needs to go bounding off into the forest leaving the rest of his friends
behind.
There seems to be a very low chance of finding other Tiggers, so Roo (who tags
along with Tigger in almost all of his daily bouncing and non-bouncing
activities) gets the gang together and they decide on a plan. They will write a
letter to Tigger, pretending to be Tigger's family. This only complicates
things, Tigger thinks the letter says they will be coming to visit him tomorrow
and soon they are painting stripes on themselves and trying to dress up Eeyore
as one of Tigger's relatives.
Not a very complicated plot, but it's not a very complicated movie. The
original drawings of the Hundred Acre Wood were copied with the greatest of
skill and the result is remarkable. The beautiful forest that these creatures
live in always manages to be a feast for the eyes throughout the entire movie.
But there is also a rather large use of actual animation, drawn by actual
hands, in the characters as well. While some sequences are obviously digitally
animated, most of the rough black lines that outline the original cartoons are
still there, as well as a humorous change to the title sequence. Jim Cummings,
who's been Pooh and Tigger on the TV show and in the made-for-video movies does
a great job with his two characters, but the rest of the cast falls short. Even
Eeyore (who makes more amusing comments than ever before) seems to have lost
some of his depressed touch. The film also brings out Roo as a major character,
Roo wants Tigger to be his big brother and his constant idolizing (it's almost
worship) of him is the only thing that bugged me about the movie. Everything
also manages to keep fairly un-modernized while a funny song regarding the
family of Tiggers (that includes a homage to Marilyn Monroe) is sure to please
adults, there isn't much else going on. I kept waiting for Christopher Robin to
say, "Hold on, I have to go check my e-mail." Or, "Let's go play Pokemon
instead." But he didn't.
This one is definitely not suited for a video rental, it's rich colors are
grrreat and it may be the only time you ever see the gang on the big screen.
It's message is easy for children to grasp and kept the kids (and the EXTREMELY
NOISY teenage girls behind me) interested. But if you do need to go to
Blockbuster (or you are searching through your huge closet of movies you own)
take the time to see the original three Pooh featurettes, I bet you won't see
much of a difference. While I know it's cliched to say this, Walt would be
proud.

Title
Review for Ghost and Mr. Chicken, The (1965)
The always over-the-top underrated Don Knotts kicked off his first of a string
of family films with this delightful comedy with a dash of horror.
Luther Heggs (Knotts) is a bug-eyed type-setter for the local newspaper, he's
always dreamed of becoming a first-class reporter but newspaper manager Ollie
(Skip Homeier) makes fun of him and won't let him write any stories. Luther is
driving along when a man is hit over the head in front of the town's spooky old
Simmons mansion that everyone says is haunted.
Convinced that they can scare him away from the paper for good, Ollie and
George Beckett (Dick Sargent) decide to let him write a story, what's the catch
you ask? He has to write it about his overnite stay in the Simmons house. Much
to his horror he finds that things go bump in the night, the organ plays by
itself, and a pair of garden shears are stabbed in the neck of a bleeding
portrait. He writes of his experiences and the town declares him a hero.
Finding it unsuitable against the family name, Nicholas Simmons (Philip Ober)
challenges Luther to prove what he saw. Of course, the same things never happen
again, and he can't prove the secret passageway that he found. Nicholas is
trying to bulldoze the house because he wants to cover up the family's secret
past.
The film is classic Knotts, the movie sets him up well and he's wonderful as
usual. Sadly the film is flawed, most of the character's motivations and
thoughts are pretty obvious from the beginning. Most non-Knotts dialouge is
boring and weak. Plus, the trailer (which appears before the movie) shows
almost every second of Luther's confrontation in the spooked house. 
But I am a fan of Knotts, where the geeky wide-eyed man gets the girl. The film
is funny, but predictable, and not original, so it gets *** stars.

Title
Review for Adventures of Sebastian Cole, The (1998)
There are two fantastic and wonderfully original characters at the heart of
this movie. The first is Sebastian Cole, (played well by Adrian Grenier who
made this before appearing in teen flick Drive Me Crazy) he's a rebellious teen
in the 80s who has to live with a family full of his mother's ex-husbands. One
morning, Sebastian's stepfather Henry (Gregg) announces to the family that he
plans to become a woman. This sets off Sebastian's sister and mother,
especially, who drags him along with her to a boarding school in England.
Henry/soon-to-be Henrietta is the second fascinating character in the film. The
two leads are both so endearing that the movie will quickly suck you in until
it's conclusion. Sebastian moves back to live with Henrietta and he begins what
he calls his adventures. All of them are designed to help him become a writer
in his later years. Some of these adventures include riding his bike everyday
down the school hall, buying a motorcycle, having an on-again off-again
relationship with a girl named Mary, and seeing what happens when you drink
half a bottle of Vodka in one gulp. When Henrietta asks him why he's trying to
get himself into trouble, Sebastian replies, "Because I need something to write
about." 
This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, mainly because of the
disjointed storyline (meant to symbolize the confusion of the teen years) and
it's intriguing characters. There are some very funny scenes, particularly
Sebastian's demonstration of karate, and Sebastian's grandfather who doesn't
quite know the right thing to say at the right time. Clark Gregg has done an
incredible job with his small role in this movie. Everytime he is on screen you
can just look into his eyes and see that he has good intentions behind them. He
always looks like there's an emotional bubble in him just about to burst. And
just like another recent transgender character (Philip Seymour Hoffman in
Flawless) I actually believed he wanted to be a woman. I wish that there would
have been more of him in the movie. Grenier makes a good debut, and if he shows
the promise he has shown here in other pictures, he should become a leading
young actor. The camera work in the movie is very simple, there's nothing too
fancy, but it suits the movie, and allows the human emotion to sink in. It's
also enjoyable that most of the film is script driven. This little seen
festival film has just arrived on video and I urge you to give it a try. It is
a worthwhile way to spend your time and money. I hope that you enjoy this
movie, which I believe gets pretty darn close to perfectly depicting the
loneliness, confusion, anger, and happiness of teenage life in it's true form.

Review for Start the Revolution Without Me (1970)
Shining in such classics as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Young
Frankenstein, Gene Wilder is easily a big pull for renting a comedy movie.
There's just something different (and funny) about his voice, his face, and his
physical humor. That's how Start The Revolution Without Me grabbed me off the
comedy shelf, and I'm here to help you through not letting that happen to you.
Philippe (Wilder) and Pierre (Sutherland) are rich French gentlemen. They have
to make some type of agreement on a treaty and are traveling to France to do
just that. When they dock, they do battle with a group of homeless pirates (or
something of the sort) that Claude (Wilder again) and Charles (Sutherland
again) are a part of. Claude and Philippe were separated at birth, the same
with Pierre and Charles. So, naturally, the two get mixed up and are mistaken
for the other two.
When Claude is taken to the king's palace and asked by the king's servant the
kill the queen, the two have to escape and are sent into a madcap run around
the house (?) avoiding a maniac, a nymphomaniac, (?) and the rest of the king's
servants. They somehow start a war with the homeless pirates again that
Philippe and Pierre are now (unwillingly) a part of, and they go to battle.
I think that I laughed exactly twice in Start The Revolution Without Me. The
film obviously has some problems, the main one being that Wilder (and the
script) go way over-the-top with the stupid quota on this one. It takes the
fact that the twins are mixed up as the film's 100 minute joke. It also doesn't
really help seeing what Donald Sutherland looked like when he was younger
either. (I actually do feel very sorry for him.) But the worst thing is that
the film breaks an alltime rule. Any film with Orson Welles is either good or
funny. Horribly broken here as he appears for commentry before the film and as
part of the film's extremely strange ending. (That amazingly ends like some
film with hair gel and a dog.) 
This is a member of the film's that you could see if you enjoy inflicting pain
on yourself club (FTYCSIYEIPOYC is what I call it, and I do review so many of
them.) So Start The Revolution Without Me gets * star.
The Young-Uns: The film contains some sexual references and the end has lots of
gun battle. Also, some young children may be confused by what is going on. Good

Review for eXistenZ (1999)
Freakish, out there science fiction films seem to be a trend. While some of
these movies are good (The Matrix), there are also ones that have their
downsides (The Thirteen Floor). Released around the same time, eXistenZ (that's
pronounced X-SEH-STENZ) is the most unique of all. Alternate universes have
never been more interesting. The movie does such a good job of blending reality
with a game that the line is almost impossible to trace. Get ready for a wild
ride, worthy of several multiple viewings.
Allegra Gellar (Leigh whose wardrobe is less then spectacular) is the world's
greatest game designer. During a test for her new game eXistenZ, something does
horribly wrong, an assassin shoots her and her game pod. She flees with
security guard Ted Pikul (Law) and the two go into hiding. Ted hasn't had the
operation for a bioport, a small hole in your back that you fit the game pod's
chord into. They need to get him one so that Allegra can play eXistenZ with
him, and make sure the only copy of her precious creation wasn't damaged by the
aforementioned assassin. They are transported into the game with new
identities, constantly going in and out of reality and the imaginary. In the
game, they begin working at a game pod manufacturing plant, Ted chops up
various parts of lizards for the pods, and Allegra is a scientist who assembles
them. This is just the beginning of a wild chase through multiple realities,
true identities, and one horrific game called eXistenZ.
This movie really packs a punch. Everything in the movie looks great (except
for Jennifer's horrific hair) and multiple dimension travel is made somewhat
believable. The performances are above what is expected for a science fiction
film. Jude Law is an excellent actor who is good in this movie despite it's
strange premise. He's really showing quite an acting range. Poor Jennifer Jason
Leigh, she can't do much in this movie, and her performance is the main letdown
of the film. Willem DaFoe and Sarah Polley also make impressions in small
roles. The sexual innuendo is interesting too. The gaming pods can't quite be
described in words, think of them as squirming pink things that look like
tumors. Also notice how the umbilical like chords reach into the backs of the
game players. This has to be one of the weirdest films to come along in a while
and it's limited theatrical release makes it a must rent video. I urge you to
rent this great film, that asks the question...

Title
Review for Scary Movie 2 (2001)
2001 - USA 
Director: Keenen Ivory Wayans 
Starring: Anna Faris, Christopher Masterson, Tim Curry, Marlon Wayans, Regina 
Hall, Shawn Wayans, Kathleen Robertson, James Woods, Chris Elliott, Tori 
Spelling, David Cross 
The original Scary Movie was released under the radar last year and astounded 
analysts and its studio, Dimension Films, with its high box office gross. The 
film spoofed classic horror films using `Scream' as an outline, with plenty 
of disgusting and raw scatological humor. Scary Movie placed number three on 
my worst five films of the year list for 2000, but since the film earned $157 
million domestically, and because life is unfair, a sequel was inevitable. 
The surprise is that it really isn't that bad. The sequel is far more clever 
than the first, this time adding political references and current events into 
the mix. There's a nice balance between Firestone tire and Nike TV ad jokes, 
and a clown being choked to death by a phallus jokes. The film is fun 
overkill. 
Anna Faris (who, in a bizarre side note, was born and raised in the small 
Seattle suburb of Edmonds, Washington where this author resides) reprises the 
role of Cindy Campbell. Her horny psychology professor (Tim Curry, who else?) 
stages some type of psychological experiment for her and all her friends from 
the original Scary Movie, who all happen to go to the same college. The 
experiment involves spending the weekend in a haunted mansion. Things, of 
course, go terribly and hilariously wrong. 
Not that the plot really matters. The film moves from one joke to another so 
quickly it's really a string of punch lines rather than a story. This is 
forgivable because the material is very funny... but there's a problem. 
If you haven't kept up on popular culture lately, you're likely to miss many 
of the jokes. A very clever spoof of Save the Last Dance flew by even the 
teenagers at my packed screening, as did a Rocky send-up. Other films are so 
cleverly woven into the plot that one viewing isn't nearly enough to spot 
them all. Less obvious jokes spoof films like The Game, The Amityville Horror 
, Urban Legend, and Hollow Man. All that and a character named Jamie Lee 
Curtisto. 
One of the biggest problems with Scary Movie was that it had to adhere so 
closely to the storyline of Scream. Scary Movie 2 is a combination of House 
on Haunted Hill and The Haunting, but even that's a loose structure. 
This gives the actors time to roam around, and the result is a more relaxed 
pace. Regina Hall gives a funny performance that goes against the premise 
that African-Americans always die first in horror movies. Christopher 
Masterson and Faris have good chemistry, but the film really belongs to Chris 
Elliott. As Hanson, the house's caretaker with a deformed, odd-looking left 
hand, and less than appealing facial features, he is completely wonderful and 
over-the-top. Tori Spelling is criminally underused. She gets to have wild 
sex with the invisible man, but not much else. I was waiting for a `90210' 
gag or her dad to pop out from somewhere. 
The biggest surprise of all may be that Scary Movie 2 seems tamer than the 
original. Oh sure there's abundant sex humor, but America has become less 
taboo about these issues since the original's release. Whether tamer or more 
outrageous, there's plenty of laughs here for a normal person to have a great 
time, and a Joe-Lieberman-person to start fuming.

Review for Into the Deep (1994)
The thrill of the big picture, the awesome sound, and the cool 3-D glasses, the
crystal clear image, boring narrator, and 3-D images. All of these factors make
an IMAX movie. Now whether or not they make a good IMAX movie is debateable.
IMAX has never really been about great movies, I mean come on, no one actually
goes to the IMAX to see a movie that is critically acclaimed. It's all about
the entertainment value and quality, it's an event. Everyone goes because they
want to see a movie that's twice the size of what they normally see. Into The
Deep is a new 3-D IMAX movie that is anything but what I listed above, except
for the boring narrator. If is hasn't hit your town yet I suggest you avoid it.
This 35-minute film ventures down deep into the ocean to uncover a world that
is quite unknown to man. A beautiful kelp forest climbs to the surface in
startling 3-D, a lobster grows a new shell, squid mating season, these are just
some of the images that are presented. But for being a heavily-hyped 3-D film,
I didn't feel that the film really needed to be in 3-D at all. Nothing at all
stood out from the screen that often to make wearing those heavy and awkward
glasses worthwhile. As for the film itself, camera technique aside, it's easily
one of the more boring films you will ever see. The whole concept of
entertaining the audience is lost. Instead we get treated to the traditional
woman with an English/Austrailian accent narrating our journey. While I don't
recomend Into the Deep, I still think that some of the pictures in it are worth
seeing. The squid mating thing is cool and the millions of fish that surround
the camera crew in the end are neat as well. But it's too short (35 minutes is
relatively short for an IMAX movie) and it resolves itself rather quickly. One
minute we are learning about sea urchins and then they are wrapping it up
giving us some all humans are connected to the ocean junk. You can go see Into
The Deep, it's not up to me, but be warned, it gets ** stars and isn't
something that's worth the $7 you'll pay.
The Young-Uns: Besides a brief appearence of a 3-D shark that might scare some
younger children, some talk about a male fertilizing a female fish's eggs, and
a look at squid mating, this film isn't very troublesome in the way of
content.. Good Age 6 & Up

Title
Review for What Lies Beneath (2000)
What Lies Beneath tries to be two different movies. At times it is a taut 
adult thriller with plenty of jolts, sure to make many people jump in their 
seats. Other moments are standard horror flick material filled with fake 
shocks and predictable conclusions. When the movie starts getting easy to 
foresee, it is still thrilling. This is the type of movie where one event 
impacts the next one. Seemingly trivial lines and occurrences influence most 
of the characters' actions. Only the attentive viewer will get rewarded. The 
prizes here are many, and worth waiting for.
Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer) lives in a beautiful New England home with her 
husband Norman (Harrison Ford). Their only daughter just went away to 
college, so they are enjoying some peace, quiet, and more time with each 
other. One day when Claire is working in her garden, she hears her new next 
door neighbor in hysterics. Becoming increasingly paranoid, Claire begins 
spying on the couple and their home. The husband is more than a little 
frightening, and Claire thinks she saw him put his wifeâ^Ŕ^Ůs body in the back of 
a car trunk. Shortly after, Claire receives her first visit from the spirit. 
Someone or something not of this world is trying to contact her. Getting 
increasingly distant from her husband, she begins searching for an answer to 
the ghost and what he or she wants. Piece by piece, the clues come together 
to form a horrifying conclusion.
To those who have not seen this movie, it sounds very similar to M. Night 
Shyamalanâ^Ŕ^Ůs The Sixth Sense. It is not. What Lies Beneath has more 
similarities with Stir of Echoes, the Kevin Bacon thriller released last 
September. The plotline is strikingly similar, and both movies clean up and 
answer all questions quite nicely. In addition, there is the obvious Rear 
Window element that works for the film. The unneeded fake frights, like a 
scratching noise that reveals itself to be only a dog, and people that bump 
into each other in badly lit rooms, come straight from Halloween: H20. These 
hurt the film somewhat.
There is a suspenseful music overkill. The score tries to be haunting, but 
works only when accentuating the thrills onscreen. Whenever the audience 
should shriek, a loud twang almost instructs them to do so. I would have 
screamed without the music. There hasnâ^Ŕ^Ůt been any movie so far this year 
thatâ^Ŕ^Ůs this exciting or scary. 1998â^Ŕ^Ůs A Perfect Murder with Michael Douglas 
and Gwyneth Paltrow comes to mind as the last grown-up thriller this good. 
While the film runs a bit long, and frequently confuses being slow with being 
mysterious, itâ^Ŕ^Ůs still a good time. Michelle Pfeiffer reminds us why she is a 
star. Her performance is excellent. Harrison Ford is particularly good as 
well, especially since he hasnâ^Ŕ^Ůt gotten any good roles lately.
Director Robert Zemeckis has been very secretive about this movie. No one can 
interview him, and he refuses to give away anything about the plot. He has a 
great reason for this. The trailer for this film shows way too much of the 
mystery that unfolds, and really spoils the fun. Anyone who hasnâ^Ŕ^Ůt seen the 
trailer should turn off any TV ads or close your eyes and ears during the 
preview at the movies. The experience will be more enjoyable. Zemeckis also 
comes up with some very inventive camera angles. Instead of just focusing on 
a characterâ^Ŕ^Ůs face, he looks at their shoulders, stomach, and toes. This 
isnâ^Ŕ^Ůt just a thriller either. Some great lines get sandwiched in between the 
screams.
A thriller that really thrills with its comedy and story, but never its 
creativity. Excellent performances make What Lies Beneath above average. This 
is an ideal adult escape during this action film filled summer.

Title
Review for Sleepy Hollow (1999)
Throughtout movie history, there have been some very simple rules that almost
all films abide by. Sequels are never as good as the first movie, Demi Moore is
stupid and cannot act, and anything starting with the words I Know or I Still
Know will be bad. There are some exceptions with these rules, Toy Story 2 and
Scream 2 were far better than their originals and I Know What You Did Last
Summer wasn't that incredibly bad. (The jury is still out on Demi Moore's
acting ability and will probably be for quite some time.) The ultimate rule of
all is that when a book gets turned into a movie, the book is always better.
All of us have seen countless novels adapted to the screen that were major
disappointments. Even worse is seeing a trailer for a movie, thinking it looks
absolutely awesome, and then seeing it, only to find out it's a dud. The last
two sentences I've written above do a great job of describing Sleepy Hollow,
the new Tim Burton film that is turning out to be a Thanksgiving hit. While
none of us should really expect that much from any holiday production (Tim
Burton and Johnny Depp bring the expectancy of quality up a notch), the film
doesn't even deliver the thrills and shrieks that parade madly around in the
film's trailer. Elements add up to become something that isn't very fun to
watch at all, not to mention extremely gory.
Ichabod Crane (Depp, who's great and gives the film a much needed dose of
humor) is a constable from New York. He believes in using proper and up to date
(the setting is the late 1790s after all) scientific methods to find criminals
and thieves. He detests the usual torture methods that are used by the court.
He is sent to the north called Sleepy Hollow. Recently, several people have
been found dead in the forest surrounding the town. All of the victims have had
their heads chopped off and the heads are nowhere to be found. The townspeople
believe that the murderer the Headless Horseman, who was actually a man who
died almost exactly five years ago. This is preposterous to Ichabod who views
the legend simply as an old myth until he sees the headless villain on his
mighty black steed one night in the woods.
Searching for clues on how to put him back into his grave for good, he consults
different members of the town including the wealthy Van Tassel family. He also
takes a liking to their daughter Katrina, played by Christina Ricci. He also
talks with various priests and noblemen. The clues begin to add up as Ichabod
discovers why the horseman is alive, and how to make him stop.
Sleepy Hollow is very beautiful. The town itself is beautifully constructed and
the light fog that always seems to be hovering over the ground gives the film a
unique sense of atmosphere. Tim Burton does a great job with the camera and
pays attention to the smallest detail. But besides the wondrous visual beauty
(and a great performance from Depp) I couldn't find much else to like in this
film. All of the scary scenes that are shown in the previews are all that is
scary in the entire movie. The marketing (once again) does a horrible thing by
giving away key points and dramatic special effect moments in the film. The
supporting cast isn't so hot, Christina Ricci is god awful and most other
characters are there for the horseman to kill. The film is also senselessly
violent (much, much more than it needs to be) and contains one too many
beheadings for its own good. The most ideal way to view Sleepy Hollow would be
to watch the preview over and over again. It shows all of the beautiful moments
in the film, as well as the only scary ones, and doesnât show any of the
blood and guts the real movie has. Falling somewhere between OK and good,
Sleepy Hollow gets my ** 1/2 stars.
The Young-Uns: There are at least 10 extremely graphic decapitations, as well
as some other violence and plenty of blood. There is also a brief sex scene
that doesnât show much. Good Age: 16 & Up

Review for Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)
Receiving recomendations from friends is always a risky thing. You know that
they really want you to see the film, but somewhere in the back of your mind
you brush them off because they liked Wild Wild West or got hyped up about
Detroit Rock City. This is the place where Grosse Point Blank rested for such a
long time. I however did finally rent it. Now I'm not quite sure how to
describe this movie, it's pretty strange, a unique experience, but I'll try.
Martin Blank (Cusack) goes to his high school reunion to relieve stress that's
caused by him being a professional hitman. He wants to go back to the town of
Grosse Point (hence the film's title) to try and regain the affections of the
girl he stood up on prom night (Driver.) He doesn't really want to go (his
psychiatrist told him too) and begins to suspect something when a man place a
bomb in an Utlimart to try and kill him.  
Another big hitman (Dan Aykroyd) has come to town to try and convince Martin to
join a hitman's union. When he refuses he becomes angered and hires someone to
kill him. Not to mention that Martin has someone that he's assigned to kill
that lives in the town. As for the reunion, it's pretty dull, at least until
Martin goes and checks his locker.
Quite an interesting plotline and quite an interesting experience. Cusack and
Driver made a cute couple, there both very good. An interesting mix in
supporting cast as well, especially Joan Cusack (the movie is all in the
family) as Martin's secretary. There are plenty of sharp hits and pokes that go
to all sorts of people, especially jabs at professional killers and high school
reunions. The end was a little strange and I didn't really feel that what
happened resolved the conflicts brought up in the picutre. There is also a lot
of un-needed scenes which add to the film's running time. A little too violent
and a little too witty for it's own good, Grosse Point Blank gets *** stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains strong (often bloody) violence, a recurring
theme of killing people, and language. Good Age: 14 & Up

Title
Review for Apt Pupil (1998)
Very dark, very disturbing, very good performances. These are all words used to
describe Apt Pupil, a new film based on a novel by Stephen King.
It begins as a quiet obsession, Todd Bowden (Renfro, who is extremely good)
wants to know more and more about the Holocaust, so much more in fact, that he
dusts the fingerprints off the mailbox of a man he thinks is a former Nazi
general. When he confronts the man, Kurt Dussander (McKellen, who is equally,
if not more excellent) he makes him tell him everything about what he did or he
will turn him in to the police. (The story's in gory, graphic detail too, and
with questions like, "How did it feel?")
When Todd buys him an old commander's uniform for Christmas and makes him wear
it and march around in it, he begins to discover the pure evil that had creeped
into the men's brains. As Todd's grades begin to slip, he finds the tables
turning, but the two remain friends until something happens. (I could tell you
but I want you to be as shocked as I was.) That makes then have a confrontation
with the law. 
The film is very, very good but the senseless (OK, maybe it's not senseless but
the film is already depressing and it doesn't need any more violence than it
already has) violence started making me like the film less and less. Yes, I do
realize that this film is about the horrors of the Holocaust, but (being a
twelve year-old) I just wasn't ready for some of the images that appeared on
the screen. The also extremely disturbing (but well deserved) ending still
makes me shiver.
Once again, this isn't to say it's not good (I swear I shook at least three
times, not to mention the haunting musical score that kept creeping into my
head afterwards) but it's also a violent film that could never (in no way
possible) have been made after Columbine. For that, and because I'm shaking as
I write this review now, I give Apt Pupil ** stars.
The Young-Uns: The film contains lots of violence (some against animals and
most of the killings are accompanied by opera music) and some swearing. There
are a lot of naked teenage boys in a locker room scene, and at least three
extremely frightening scenes (and or nightmares) occur. For that, I do not
recommend this film for anyone under 15.

Title
Review for Hi-Lo Country, The (1998)
The modern use of the western movie, and the western genre has almost
evaporated. Even Cowgirls Get the Blues and Wild Wild West are some of the most
recent entries, both of them were bad, and this one is coming right along to
join them. What starts out like a promising desert film (Martin Scorsese is one
of the producers) turns into boring drech.
Pete Calder (Crudup, who was Steve Prefontaine in Without Limits) is new to
Hi-Lo, New Mexico. He's here to start his cattle business and quickly makes
friends with, oh, the western version of Woody Harrelson (and, what a surprise,
he's played by Woody Harrelson) his name is Big Boy and he's in the same
business. The two men constantly go to the bar, and celebrate the death of a
man that they beat in poker.
When Mona (Patricia Arquette) crosses through both of their lives, they are
both lovestruck and each of them begin their own private affairs. The men
struggle to keep their bonds alive while they are constantly drunk, herding
cattle, and making crude sexual references. (If this doesn't sound like a
classic western you're right.) The film follows the two men's lives until one
character dies, by the time we get there, we don't really care.
There are three problems in The Hi-Lo Country. One, Harrelson seems to have his
role written exactly for him. Rather than seeing Harrelson's Big Boy character
when I looked on the screen, I saw Woody Harrelson playing the same type of
Woody-ized character that he always plays. This also goes for Arquette, who's
role seems Patricia-ized for her and reminded me constantly of her Alice
character in Lost Highway. Two, the film is boring. So boring in fact, that I
believe my minutes of film to yawn ratio is 6:2. Three, The film plays in no
particular order, showing us a handful of random events that don't have any
meaning to what happens in the conclusion. Add some sappy drama, and you've got
another bad western, The Hi-Lo Country gets *  1/2 stars.

Title
Review for Croupier (1998)
When I saw Croupier, there were no coming attractions. While I saw the movie in
a perfectly respectable Loews Cineplex theater with three screens, no studios
thought that their money would get put to good use by placing a trailer before
this film. This could be a sign that expectations were low in regard to how
much of an audience this movie would receive. More likely though, it's a sign
that little movies like these are often the best films out there. While some
smaller movies get the mainstream quota achieved by hits like Life Is
Beautiful, Being John Malkovich, and The Blair Witch Project there are others
that remain doomed to the film festival. Adopted by The Shooting Gallery as
their fifth film in this year's lineup of six, Croupier is an intense film noir
piece worthy of your attention. The scheduled two week run does shame to a
movie that should play for longer for all to see and experience.
Clive Owen plays Jack Manfred. Jack is a struggling writer who takes a job as a
croupier in a casino after his father suggests it to him. Jack is currently in
a relationship with Marion (McKee), who doesn't like his new job. Life as a
croupier is a depressing one. Jack watches people lose their money night after
night. Another croupier winds down after work with drinks at a local prostitute
heavy bar. âThe job will kill you if you donât.â? he says. Even though
strict rules issued by the casino forbid it, Jack soon begins sleeping with a
co-worker named Bella (Hardie). Jack breaks another rule when he begins seeing
Jani de Villiers (Kingston), a gambler from South Africa who catches his
interest. He soon falls in love with her, but Jani has ulterior motives to
their relationship. She asks Jack to take part in a hiest to rob the casino,
offering him quite a deal of money to do so. 
All the classic detective movie elements are here. There are many voice-overs,
there is a woman with a secret, and the characters smoke a lot and drink a lot.
Indeed everything needed is here but the detective. While Croupier is certainly
not a mystery, it does a brilliant job of almost turning itself into one in the
last few minutes. Questions we weren't really asking get answered, and it's a
nice touch to end the film with. Clive Owen is terrific as the lead character
and makes his sullen, emotionless view of the world an interesting outlook. You
have no doubt the casino he works in is real. The filmmakers did a remarkable
job of making you feel that somewhere this casino really does exist. Everything
seems so dark and gloomy in this world. At times, I felt black and white would
have been more appropriate to this movie than color. Either way, it would still
be thrilling. The lights, the noise, the people, everything that might annoy
one in a regular casino is here to set a unique atmosphere. The cheaters and
obsessive gamblers Jack encounters in the casino seemed to me a metaphor of the
characters in the movie. All of the them are trying to cheat at something or
are permanently downcast with nowhere to turn. Croupier is not rated. If
submitted, it would get rated R for sexual situations including graphic nudity,
language, and some violence. Several unneeded breasts are present. Then again,
maybe this too is a suggested way that gamblers escape from their troubles. Not
only is Croupier a high quality drama, but it made me think about what leads
people to become obsessive gamblers. The movie doesn't come up with an answer.
Then again, maybe there isn't one.

Review for Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, The (2000)
In the spotty two film history of Jay Wardâs animated television shows making 
their way to the big screen, along comes Rocky and Bullwinkle. The duo is 
probably the most popular of his creations, but these two have something 
George of the Jungle and Dudley Do-Right donât. When the program aired during 
the 1960s, there was always a political aspect to it. Winking, nudging, and 
in conclusion suggesting that a dimwitted moose and above average flying 
squirrel could beat the Russians was never completely through the back door. 
Since the Russian paranoia in the states has subsided, what purpose would the 
creatures serve today? To satirize Hollywood of course! Their mission is 
pretty much the same, but technology has changed everything. Keeping the 
original cheap wordplay intact, this new movie smacks all former cartoon 
characters into '90s reality, a time of influential entertainment, improved 
communication, and an evil villain to bring to justice.
Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo) get pulled out of reruns. 
Their leader, aptly named Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro), also pops up in 
the real world. He comes up with a brilliant scheme. He buys all of the 
television stations in the United States so he can broadcast his own network, 
Really Bad TV, across the nation. After watching just a few short minutes, 
viewers become stupefied and settle into a hypnotic trance. When the majority 
of Americans are under his spell, Fearless Leader will force them to vote for 
him as president. Naturally, the only people that can save the day are Rocky 
and Bullwinkle. They too get pulled out of reruns. Teaming up with FBI agent 
Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo), Moose and Squirrel travel the countryside to 
stop the evil television station. With Bullwinkleâs mental capacity, Karenâs 
identity issues, and Rocky past his prime the adventure is a rough one.  
The greatest pleasures of this movie are the cameos. Randy Quaid, Janeane 
Garofolo, Carl Reiner, Jonathan Winters, Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and 
Whoopi Goldberg all make appearances.  Piper Perabo fits her character well. 
Jason Alexander and Rene Russo are deliciously evil as Boris and Natasha. The 
chemistry between them is great. Robert De Niro hams it up to hilarious 
extremes, and he even spoofs his famous, âYou talkinâ to me?â? scene from 
Taxi Driver. Keith Scott is satisfactory as the narrator and new Bullwinkle. 
While he doesnât have the blundering Bullwinkle tone of the late Bill Scott, 
his lines are really funny. The wonderful June Foray is still the voice of 
Rocky. 
The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle runs into difficulties in its 
presentation. Boris, Natasha, and Fearless leader are actual people. Rocky 
and Bullwinkle must settle for being awkward computer animated images. Why is 
that? One character raises this question during the movie, but receives no 
answer. Complete animation would mean the loss of already animated and 
excellent human performances. An actual live moose and squirrel would just be 
bizarre. Another problem I always have with Jay Ward movies is the way 
characters interact and converse with the narrator. He's just another 
character rather than being omnipotent. This was amusing in George of the 
Jungle, made Dudley Do-Right worse, and works only occasionally here.
Now Iâm forgetting the context of the story. This is a live action cartoon 
with lots of witty or so bad itâs funny lines. It succeeds at what a movie 
should do, entertain. Even though some of the jokes fall flat, this should be 
an enjoyable time for kids, and a nostalgia trip for baby boomers. Despite 
its many flaws, this is 88 minutes of pure fun.

Review for Dudley Do-Right (1999)
There are many types of children's films. Some are designed to entertain the
parent while enchanting the child as well, some are targeted straight for the
kiddies and avoid any chance of good entertainment for adults, and there are
some (much like Dudley Do-Right) that manage to turn off both groups because
it's incredibly bad. Sticking straighter to the formula than I thought
possible, Brendan Fraser returns as a 60s cartoon character in the worst remake
of the year.
Dudley (Fraser) has always dreamed of being a Canadian Mountie, the dim-witted
fellow finally gets his wish and begins to govern the sweet mountain town of
Semi-Happy Valley. When Snidley Whiplash (Molina) decides to dump gold that he
stole from a bank, into the town stream and declare a gold rush to help bring
profit to the town, Dudley must step forward and save the day. It's also a
quest for his true love, somehow Nell (Sarah Jessica Parker) has fallen into
the wrong man's arms and it's Dudley's duty to save her.
Confused as Whiplash changes his role from good guy to bad guy (?) Dudley turns
into a bad guy because as the narrator points out, good guys can do bad things
to capture bad people (?.) It all leads to a final showdown between the
Mounties and the Whiplash bunch.
First of all, the film as a star vehicle for Brendan Fraser does not work. Both
him and Sarah Jessica Parker have less screen time than Snidley Whiplash
combined and Dudley says no more than 200 words. The narrator is also annoying,
constantly interacting with the characters (ala George of the Jungle anyone?)
and making stupid comments. The film also manages to be flat out not funny,
none of the jokes made even the nine year old with her Beanie Babies next to me
laugh. Now I could go on and on about how America is being shoveled this
mainstream trash and how the public eats it up, but I'll save some time for us
all by giving Dudley Do-Right no stars whatsoever.
ADDITIONAL NOTE: There is one portion of the film, 8 seconds to be exact that
contains a joke worth seeing, I will now save you the $7.50 admission ticket:
"Scientists report today that Canadian bacon is actually ham."  
The Young-Uns: The film is aimed right at kids and contains mild language and
some bare male chests. Good Age: 5-11

Review for Lake Placid (1999)
Creature features are always popular, take one part cliched script, add two
parts awesome special effects, and one cup of stars and you've got a success.
Obviously this is usually never true, but in Lake Placid, it works.
A deputy is bit in half right before the sheriff (Brendan Gleeson) in the
town's lake by a giant crocodile. The top of the man is taken to the morgue
where they discover a tooth hidden among the flesh and carnage. Kelly (Fonda)
has just been dumped by her boss for another co-worker, when news of the tooth
is delivered he sends her down so he can have some private time with his new
friend. 
Two other characters show up, game warden Jack Wells (Pullman) who constantly
has a macho smile and denim wardrobe about him and mythology professor Oliver
Platt who views crocodiles as godly and loves to take swims with them. 
Lake Placid will keep you laughing more than anything else, the two minorly
frightening scenes of the film aren't that exciting so they fill it with humor,
a wise choice. A good choice especially with Betty White as Mrs. Delores
Bickerman a SSU (seriously screwed up) woman who feeds her cattle (and her
husband) to the crocodile. Finally, Hollywood has made a movie so hilariously
bad and totally outrageous that you can enjoy it. Come along for one heck of a
bad movie that's bad enough to be good, which earns my *** stars.
