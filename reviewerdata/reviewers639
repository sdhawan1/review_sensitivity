Rating : *** out of *****
The problem with watching a movie where well-known actors appear in
drag is that invariably the movie just becomes a vehicle for said
actors trying to stretch the comic buck of the dressing-up thing for
as much as they can. Remember TO WONG FOO, THANKS FO R EVERYTHING,
JULIE NEWMAR? Acting, even by Hollywood standards, is at a serious
premium here at BIRDCAGE.
But then again, that's obviously not the reason why one would go to
watch this movie. It's a comedy, or at least that's what it's billed
as. Adapted from the french movie LA CAGE AUX FOLLES or "The Cage of
Madmen," this movie doesn't live up to the origin al. Isn't it funny
how so many good movies from France lose something when they get
Hollywoodised? (A little qualifier would be THE ASSASSIN, but that's
only because they copied the whole movie line for line, and Brigette
Fonda is kinda cute). Clearly the french title loses something with my
translation and the Hollywood version actually sounds nicer, but hey,
I could just be a poor translator.
The story revolves around the lives of two families, the
Goldmans and the Keeleys. Robin Williams and Nathan Lane play Armand
and Albert Goldman, owners of the eponymous Birdcage, a drag
nightclub, while Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest are Senator and Mrs
Keeley, believers in the sort of conservatism that would have made
them burn the Puritans at the stake for Caligari-like decadence.
The two families collide when their children Val and Barbara decide to
get married. Barbara needs to convince her Senator Dad that the
marriage is the right thing despite the fact that she's only 18. He is
initially reluctant as he's too busy planning his re-election.
Circumstances change and he's led to believe that the only way to
salvage his political career is to be seen doing something with a
"feel-good" factor, and there's hardly anything more likely to tug the
heartstrings of the public than a good 'ol-fashioned wedding. Val
panics and enlists the help of his dads in an attempt to make them
look like a normal family for one day as the Keeleys come to visit.
What results is embarassingly obvious and really, the audience just
laughs because it feels obliged to. Nothing original happens in this
movie and Robin Williams shows once again that he's a cotton candy
actor: any good feelings about him disappear strai ght after walking
under the exit sign. What's worse in this movie is that he's abysmally
insipid throughout. He's an actor who's realized that him trying to
act really isn't all that commercially viable (be honest: anyone could
have done DEAD POETS' SOCIE TY; and THE FISHER KING, who understood
that??). Reversion back to Mork-mode was inevitable. Doing that
properly may have at least salvaged something of this mess. He's so
boring in this movie that he actually makes Nathan Lane look good.
Yeah sure, you'v e probably seen the shots of the movie and heard the
touting of Nathan Lane stealing the show. Well, it isn't so much a
case of him stealing the show as everyone else throwing it at him. His
drag impersonation is laboured and definitely gets on the nerves
quickly. That scene with Williams trying to teach Lane "How To Be a
Man" was definitely a 10 on the cheesy scale.
That's not all. Like father like son and here, Val (Dan Futterman)
feels some genetic need to emulate Williams' perfomance. He maintains
this unfazable look through all the tribulations his character is
supposed to be going through. Anyone else would have done a decent
portrayal of a young man whose life is about to come apart. This is
obviously below Val and one suspects that he's incapable of doing
anything but look cool. He certainly looks like he'll be more
comfortable in a "Top Gun" sort of movie tha n a funny-farm drag
misadventure.
Scraping the bottom of the barrel, we get a couple of plus points. You
get a little look at Miami's South Beach where the film is set and we
get to see Gene Hackman's finest hour in the last minute of the movie.
Be warned though: Don't watch this movie un less you're prepared to
not think about it ever after. It's the stuff nightmares are made of.

Boy, what a great movie!! Keanu Reeves and Morgan
Freeman acting together, the director of THE FUGITIVE (Andrew Davis)
back again to give us another thriller, and the beautiful Rachel
STEALING BEAUTY Weisz thrown in to boot. How could this not be a
blockbuster? All die-hard Keanu Reeves fans, read on. 
Ol "Much Ado About Nothing" plays Eddie Kasalivich, a machinist studying
at the University of Chicago. To help pay for the rent, he takes on this
job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the
university. By happy coincidence, he also happens to stumble on the
solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key
to performing this feat of miracle physics. This project holds great
promise: taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is
put in. A potential solution to the Earth's energy problems without the
pollution cost. Surely nobody could have any problems with that?
Morgan Freeman is Paul Shannon, the project's sponsor. He works for a
very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project
leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public. He
figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the
project are released too quickly. So he murders the project leader,
blows up the project (great but short scene here, sort of like a mini
ID4 city-devastation thing) and tries to simulate the experiment at some
other hi-tech hush-hush location. Unfortunately, our intrepid machinist
and an English physicist (Weisz) manage to get away and now follows a
Fugitive-like chase using a  not too dissimilar rehash of that movie
script.
This movie is just dying for a comparison with "The Fugitive". Both
movies use Chicago as the main city and since the place doesn't change
much, I guess we can't really blame the setting for the paucity of
atmosphere. The trouble here is that where THE FUGITIVE had Harrison
Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, CHAIN REACTION only has Keanu Reeves and Fred
Ward. Credit to them, but we aren't really given much of a chance to
empathise with the characters. Where Ford was able to work within the
confines of the movie to evoke sympathy, Eddie Kasalivich just doesn9t
seem very believeable and Reeves' character is never given the time to
develop. It might have been a better investment in film to give the
characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences, which
frankly, get quite boring after a while.
Harrison Ford was "the man against the world." He was alone in a world
where he didn't know who to trust and it came across real well. In CHAIN
REACTION, Keanu Reeves isn't alone. Now that would be fine if the
fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some
paranoia, vulnerability and confusion. We don't get this. We get him
thinking he's still in SPEED, only now our Sandra Bullock has an English
accent, probably doesn't drive a bus, and hardly contributes anything to
the movie.
The producers here probably thought, "Hey, what if Keanu
and Rachel don't hit it off too well? Let's rope in that Morgan to help
us out." Well, Keanu and Rachel didn't hit it off well on the screen,
and most unfortunately, Morgan Freeman doesn't help much either. The
only thing we come to really know of Paul Shannon is that he always has
a full load of cigars in his cigar holder.  It's not really his fault.
Once again, Andrew Davis just doesn't take the time to build his
characters. Someone must have convinced him that this time round, cinema
dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken.
