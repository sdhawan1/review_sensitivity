Title
Review for From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)
        I am not a regualr contributor to this group, more a lurker
who has enjoyed hearing the well formed opinions of others
while trying to pick a movie to see or rent. However, since
I am probably among the first to see this movie, having gone
to a sneak preview on wednesday, I decided to share my thoughts.
Let me warn you folks that my inexperienced style may accidently
release a spoiler or two, so ignore my review if you wish to
remain unspoiled.
This movie a collaboration between two of the hottest young
movie making talents making movies Richard Rodriguez directing,
Tarrantino writing has enormous promise. It does not let one down.
The satire in this movie is often enough to make a person want to
collapse from irony. Such as when we see a news report on our protagonists
(played by George Clooney and Tarrantino) giving a running death total.
The simultaneous shot at critics of movie violence and TV news
is two-bird-with-one-stone writing that we have come to expect
from Tarrantino.
Mostly, I would describe this movie as a hip 90s update of
the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Except that I was ambivelent toward
TCM and I very much liked this movie.
I do have a few nitpicks. The dialogue was sparse and minimalist.
I expected more, particularly a few good soliloquies from Tarrantino,
though one could make the case that many parts of this movie are
his soliloquies on the state of the world. In addition, at the very end
of the movie we learn the topless bar is apparently part of an
ancient temple. We never got a chance to explore the depths of the
place, and one wonders what still might be lurking in there,
perhaps good fodder for a sequel.
